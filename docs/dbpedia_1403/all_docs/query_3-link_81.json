If you, your organization, community group, or company are interested in using the Berks Community Television platform to spread your message and tell your story – we want to meet you!\n\nBCTV programming broadcasts on our local cable channels and streams 24/7 on bctv.org and YouTube. Individual programs are also uploaded to the BCTV YouTube channel for convenient on-demand viewing and sharing.\n\nQ. How do I produce my program for BCTV?\n\nA. BCTV offers a fully operational television studio and staff for producers to book and take advantage of – including multiple cameras, microphones, green screen capabilities, and more. If equipped to do so, producers can also create their own programming outside of our studio and submit it to BCTV for platforming.\n\nQ. How frequently would I produce my program?\n\nA. There are two types of TV programs currently offered by BCTV – regularly scheduled and one-time specials. One-time specials are single programs that only require one taping session and are not episodic. Regularly scheduled programs are episodic and require the producer to meet a consistent production schedule which they can choose upon proposing their program (quarterly, bi-monthly, or monthly).\n\nQ. Where is the BCTV studio located?\n\nA. The BCTV studio is located in beautiful downtown Reading at 401 Penn Street, Reading, PA inside the Alvernia University CollegeTowne campus. Enter CollegeTown at the building’s main entrance on Penn Street, sign in at the front desk, and BCTV is located on the first floor in Suite 162.\n\nQ. Where should I park when visiting BCTV?\n\nA. Guests of BCTV may park in the Chiarelli Plaza Garage. We can validate your parking for this garage only. Please know your vehicle’s license plate number so that BCTV staff can assist you with validation. Paid parking is also available at meters, other garages, and on the street locally at your own expense. Parking locations, meter times, and pricing can be found at www.readingparking.com.\n\nGetting Started\n\nSo you’ve got an idea for a program on BCTV and you’re ready to start production. Great! The first step is to propose your program using the form below. Once submitted, your program proposal will be received by our Programming Director and reviewed internally by a volunteer committee. Once your request has been reviewed, you will be contacted with any further questions and to schedule the necessary dates and times for production."
