It has a long and illustrious history that dates back more than a century.\n\nSoccer is mostly a European sport in the eyes of the general public. Firstly, the ancient Greeks and Romans each had their ball games. Also, the origins of modern soccer may be traced back to Britain, and the sport has been played there since at least the seventh century. Eventually, soccer was widely adopted throughout Europe thanks in large part to the efforts of the British.\n\nCurrently, the greatest players, managers, and teams in the world now compete in the European top five leagues. Meanwhile, the UEFA Champions League is typically heralded as the most popular soccer competition in the world, and its winners are praised as the best worldwide.\n\nBut despite the European prominence and supremacy, South American competitions have contributed to the sport’s development worldwide. As an early adopter, South America has been instrumental in defining international soccer tournaments.\n\nBirth of South American tradition\n\nThe Copa America stands as the longest-running international soccer tournament that is still in existence. The continental tournament has left an indelible imprint on the sport during its 107-year history. It has served as a stage for iconic performances, thrilling matchups, and historic events. In addition, it was a stage upon which the greatest players in South American history could be honored.\n\nIts origins can be traced back to 1910 when it commenced as the Copa Centenario Revolucion de Mayo, evolving into the Campeonato Sudamericano de Football (the South American Championship) in 1916. Eventually, in 1975, it assumed its current and cherished form as the Copa America.\n\nArgentina held the inaugural tournament to commemorate a century after the May Revolution, which had begun the country’s battle for independence from Spain. Although they invited Brazil, Uruguay, and Chile to their celebration, Brazil declined to attend. Argentina and Uruguay reached the final, where the hosts won 4-1. Even though Conmebol doesn’t include this as part of the Copa America’s official history, it was the first time more than two teams competed for a trophy in South America.\n\nOfficially formed in 1916 following the trial run in 1910, the inaugural incarnation of the cup comprised four teams and was staged in Argentina. Because of the tournament’s round-robin format, Uruguay emerged victorious after playing to a scoreless tie with Argentina in the championship game.\n\nIn 1918, the tournament had to be postponed because of the Spanish flu and resumed the following year in Brazil. Participation dropped after World War II because of conflicts between the Argentine and Uruguayan FAs and a lack of regularity in hosting the event.\n\nWhich teams participate in it?\n\nThe ten South American countries and CONMEBOL members represented in this tournament are Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. However, throughout its inception, the South American governing body has tried numerous methods to arrange the event.\n\nSince the tournament often features 12 teams, CONMEBOL has permitted members of other soccer governing bodies to invite two teams from foreign federations. In the past, they have included Mexico, Costa Rica, the United States, Honduras, Jamaica, and Japan.\n\nGrowing pains and expansions\n\nThe number of teams competing and the tournament’s prominence abroad both increased throughout the years. Paraguay and Peru joined in 1921, and Bolivia joined the competition the following year, expanding it to include additional South American countries.\n\nHowever, due to economic problems and political tensions, the tournament was not organized regularly, with considerable intervals between certain editions. It was not until 1975 that Copa America became a regular biannual tournament.\n\nIn 1975, ten teams from around South America competed in the competition, demonstrating the region’s wide variety. The tournament’s format and rules have developed to include group stages, knockout rounds, and penalty shootouts to select the victor.\n\nIn many respects, the rules and exceptions impacting Copa America might appear to be continually shifting, especially to spectators from outside of South America. To align with the European summer tournament schedule, CONMEBOL has shifted the event’s timing many times.\n\nThe South American soccer season begins in June, unlike in Europe, where it begins in August, hence the Copa America did not take place over a single month until the mid-1980s. There has been a rise in the number of players relocating to Europe, prompting tournament organizers to shift the dates of the competition to June or July.\n\nThe frequency with which the competition is played has also been altered by the rules implemented by CONMEBOL. Up to 2001 January, Copa America was typically held every two years. As of 2001, the competition has been staged every three to four years to avoid scheduling conflicts with the World Cup.\n\nDespite this, there have been exemptions, such as for the 2016 tournament that celebrated the event’s centennial. From the edition in 2024 forward, the Copa America will return to its traditional quadrennial schedule.\n\nWho has won it the most?\n\nSome countries have performed admirably year after year at the Copa America. The Uruguayan national team has won 15 Copa America championships, making them the most successful in the tournament’s history. Their early success set the tone for the rest of their soccer heritage, and they have remained a formidable opponent throughout the competition.\n\nArgentina has also been a dominant force in the World Cup, winning the championship 14 times and creating greats like Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi. Having such devoted fans and a constant rivalry with Brazil only boosts the tournament’s appeal.\n\nThe Brazilian national team has captured the championship 9 times, with an amazing history of success in both Copa America and the FIFA World Cup. The tournament will never be the same after Pelé, Zico, and Ronaldo infused the game with their brilliance.\n\nIn addition, Chile‘s ascension to soccer prominence in South America was on display in its back-to-back wins in Copa America in 2015 and 2016. The national team’s toughness and teamwork were vital to their success throughout this time.\n\nWhat was so significant about Copa America Centenario?\n\nThe Copa America Centenario was a landmark event since it commemorated 100 years since the first ever international soccer competition was played. In 2016, this unique edition united the top South American national teams while introducing a new layer of international competition by including teams from North America.\n\nBut, the importance of the Copa America Centenario extends beyond commemorating the tournament’s centenary. This event was planned with great care to be one for the record books. The organizers did this by admitting six extra teams from North America, increasing the total number of competitors to 16.\n\nAlso, for the first time, the Copa America was played in a country outside of South America, as the United States played host. This choice was important in itself, since it opened up the competition to a new and diversified fan base, with matches played in numerous locations around the United States.\n\nOne of the deepest significances of the Copa America Centenario was the blending of North and South American soccer cultures. As a result of the participation of the United States, Mexico, Costa Rica, and other countries, the tournament provided spectators with thrilling matches that had never been seen before. It was an opportunity for these teams to battle at the top level and test their mettle against some of the finest from South America.\n\nIn addition, the competition served as a unifying force for the countries of the Americas. The continent-wide interest in the Copa America Centenario demonstrated the power of soccer to unite people regardless of their location or language. It highlighted the power of sport in bringing people together.\n\nSeveral teams from North America were able to make an impact in the tournament thanks to the new structure. While Jamaica only advanced to the quarterfinals, the United States advanced to the semis. These results not only displayed the development of soccer in these countries but also provided a welcome dose of unexpected drama to the event.\n\nWhen and where will next Copa America take place?\n\nIn 2024, the Copa America will return to the United States for the second time. The tournament starts June 20 and concludes July 14, spanning 25 days of intense competition.\n\nThis edition features 16 participating teams, 10 from CONMEBOL and 6 from CONCACAF as guests. The six CONCACAF national teams joining this prestigious event were determined through the 2023-24 CONCACAF Nations League, with the third edition of this competition having started in September 2023.\n\nThe United States, Mexico, Panama, and Jamaica are joined by the two winners of CONCACAF playoff matches: Canada and Costa Rica.\n\nCopa America TV schedule: More resources for soccer fans\n\nCourtesy of World Soccer Talk, download a complimentary copy of The Ultimate Soccer TV And Streaming Guide, which features where to watch all of the leagues from around the world on US TV and streaming.\n\nTo find out when soccer games are on, download the free Soccer TV Schedules App which includes listings of all of the live soccer matches available in the United States (available on Apple iOS devices and Android devices).\n\nIf you have questions about the Copa America TV schedule, post your comments below.\n\nPhoto: IMAGO / Pacific Press Agency"
