        "text": "TV begins with a video camera. The camera records the pictures and sound of a TV program. It changes the pictures and sound into electric signals. A TV set receives the signals and turns them back into pictures and sound.\n\nThe TV Signal\n\nA standard TV camera changes the pictures into an electric signal called the video signal. The video signal carries the pictures in the form of tiny dots called pixels. The camera’s microphone changes the sound into another electric signal, called the audio signal. The video and audio signals together form the TV signal.\n\nDigital TV, or DTV, is a newer way of handling TV signals. A digital TV signal carries pictures and sound as a number code, like a computer does. A digital signal can carry more information than a standard signal can, which creates better pictures and sound. High definition TV, or HDTV, is a high-quality form of digital TV.\n\nA TV signal can reach a TV set in several ways. Local TV stations use antennas to send, or broadcast, signals through the air as radio waves. Cable TV stations send signals through underground cables. Satellites, or spacecraft, traveling high above Earth can send signals to special antennas called satellite dishes. A signal can also come from a VCR, DVD player, or DVR (digital video recorder) connected to the TV set. VCRs, DVRs, and some DVD players can record a TV signal coming into the TV and then play it back later.\n\nDisplay\n\nA standard TV set turns the video signal into beams of tiny particles called electrons. It shoots these beams at the back of the screen through a picture tube. The beams “paint” the pixels on the screen in a series of rows to form the picture. The TV set sends the audio signal to loudspeakers, which reproduce the sound.\n\nLCD and plasma TVs form the picture differently. They do not use a picture tube and electron beams. Because they do not hold a picture tube, LCD and plasma TVs are much thinner and lighter than standard TVs. They can even hang on a wall.\n\nLCD stands for liquid crystal display. Liquid crystal is a substance that flows like a liquid but has some tiny solid parts, too. The display sends light and electric current through the liquid crystal. The electric current causes the solid parts to move around. They block or let light through in a certain way to make the picture on the screen.\n\nA plasma display has tiny colored lights containing a gas called plasma. Electric current sent through the plasma causes it to give off light, which makes the picture."
