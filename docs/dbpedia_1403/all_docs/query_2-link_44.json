        "text": "Directly control your camera using the intuitive touchscreen of the Shinobi 7, designed to give you fast access to the most critical camera features. Focus on the image while you make dynamic adjustments to iris, white balance, shutter angle and ND.\n\nWith the optional Atomos USB-C to serial cable, support is available out the box for the Z Cam E2 series camera, providing direct control of all menu configurations. The additional USB and RJ45 control ports on the Shinobi 7 also provide support for future developments, as more options are added for touch screen camera control.\n\nShinobi 7 comes with our acclaimed AtomOS platform and is packed with scopes and simple one-touch operations. Shinobi includes monitoring tools for focus, framing & exposure, including Focus Peaking, 4:1 / 2:1 / 1:1 Zoom, Zebra, False Color, Frame Guides, SMPTE Safe Area, Waveform, RGB parade, vectorscope, a new multi-view ‘Analysis’ view and a flexible 3D and 1D LUT, Profile and Preset support (upload .cube files via SD Card) and options for anamorphic desqueeze monitoring.\n\nIn addition to Shinobi 7’s Log to HDR conversions, you can also use your own custom 3D LUT to feed downstream to other devices or live feed. Load up to eight custom LUTs at any time via the SD Card Slot and instantly select between them. When using selfie mode, the large display acts as a confidence monitor that allows you to ’bake-in’ a LUT to your camera input, to achieve the desired look for your piece to camera.\n\nWith support for up to 4Kp60 via the HDMI inputs and the ability to cross-convert between 4K HDMI and 3G SDI, the Shinobi 7 fits into many different video workflows. You can, for example, cross-convert and downscale from 4K HDMI into 2K SDI out and add a LUT to the output at the same time."
