I was very fortunate to visit all of the main studios (TC1-TC11) at BBC Television Centre in the years before its closure in March 2013. Getting access to Studio 7 was particularly fascinating. Later in the day, one of the few remaining BBC News at Six bulletins was broadcast from that desk. February 2013.
