Whether it’s creating a chest-pounding dance mix or a gut-wrenching sound effect for a movie, you will harness the power of sound in artistic, creative ways in George Fox’s audio production concentration of the cinematic arts major.

As part of our program, you’ll record in our 5.1 surround-sound recording studio complete with hidden Foley pits, using cutting-edge digital devices as well as warm old-school ribbon mics and tube preamps. We believe you learn best when you get your hands on the equipment and go to work.

As a new audio student, you’ll get to sit down at a console full of glowing LEDs that look like the cockpit of a 747, and you’ll master it amazingly quickly! By graduation, you’ll be equipped to produce great sound, from recording rock bands to mixing featuring films. In fact, we’ve had graduates of our program cut sound for Z Nation and Larson Sound Studios in L.A.
