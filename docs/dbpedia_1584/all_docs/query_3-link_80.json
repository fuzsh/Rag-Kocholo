        "text": "\"Part of Your World\" (also known as \"Part of that World\") is a song written and composed by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman for Disney's 1989 animated feature film The Little Mermaid. It serves as the leitmotif of Ariel and the film as the whole.\n\nSummary[]\n\nIt's first heard in the opening titles and again in the end credits.\n\nIt is sung by Ariel (Jodi Benson), the title character, while in her secret grotto, which holds all of her treasures, most of which are human objects. It reveals how she dreams of leaving her ocean world behind and becoming a human to be with Prince Eric. Ariel imagines what it would be like to live in the human world with him, and she yearns to see the prince happy with her. Ariel also expresses her curiosity about being part of his world and fascination with his everyday life. She is determined to make her dream a reality, imagining that someday she will be part of the human world and with the prince she loves. While singing, she is unknowingly being watched by Sebastian, who had been tasked with watching over Ariel by King Triton.\n\nAfter rescuing and falling in love with Eric, a human, Ariel reprises the song, during which she shows an even greater drive to live life upon land.\n\nIt is later sung by Ursula, disguised as Vanessa, when she hypnotizes Eric.\n\nIn the Live Action Version, Part of Your World is served as the first song of the live action film.\n\nLyrics[]\n\nFirst[]\n\nOriginally, the song was going to have more specific lyrics on the objects in Ariel's grotto, but then it was decided that since Scuttle was her provider of information, she wouldn't really know the names of these objects.\n\nThis version of the song was used in the Disney's Sing-Along Songs video Circle of Life.\n\nA shorter version using the final verse from the reprise was featured in Mickey's PhilharMagic.\n\nReprise[]\n\nBefore the finalized version was made, an alternate version of the reprise was made into a Demo sung by Alan Menken. In this version, Ariel sings of how much she longs to be with Eric but realizes that they can't be together and gives him a kiss before diving back under the waves.\n\nThis version was removed due to the filmmakers having written Ariel as being so lovesick after the storm that it was considered inappropriate for the song to be so tragic.\n\nThe comic adaptation of the Little Mermaid took a different route with the lyrics of this song. Snippets of it can follow the melody of the original, but it is mostly new.\n\nIn 2023 film, additional lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda, called Part Of Your World Reprise II.\n\nFinale[]\n\nThe final version of the song played during Ariel and Eric's wedding day after the defeat of Ursula. Ariel meets with her father to say goodbye one last time. She and him hug, and she whispers the words, \"I love you, Daddy.\" After which the chorus begins.\n\nAlan Menken and Howard Ashman developed another demo, possibly earlier than the storyboarded version. In this demo, judging from the build-up of the music Ariel is slowly coming out of the water. She also approaches the beginning of the song in a more inquisitive manner than both the chorus and storyboarded versions.\n\nVideos[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nJodi Benson's favorite moment from The Little Mermaid was when she recorded the song \"Part of Your World\". She sang the song in the dark to get that \"under the sea\" feeling.\n\nThe part where Ariel reaches through the hole in the roof was the final shot to be completed for the film. It took four tries to get its optical effects right.\n\nThe song was nearly cut because Jeffrey Katzenberg felt that it was \"boring\", as well as being too far over the heads of the children for whom it was intended. It was only through the insistence of Howard Ashman and Glen Keane that it was included in the movie.\n\nAlan Menken and Howard Ashman discovered that the song shared contextual and rhythmic similarities with another one of their songs: \"Somewhere That's Green\" from Little Shop of Horrors, leading them to humorously call it \"Somewhere That's Dry\".\n\nIn early prints of the Diamond Edition release, after Ariel sings \"Out of the sea...\", the next two shots of her floating back down and Flounder's sad face when she sang \"Wish I could be...\" were swapped. This had been fixed for later printings of the Diamond Edition and remained fixed for the Signature Collection release.\n\nDuring the finale, Sebastian and Chef Louis were originally going to become friends, but Jeffery Katzenberg preferred them as enemies, and asked for the scene to be changed where Chef Louis gets his comeuppance.\n\nA music video of the song featuring scenes from the movie and live action recordings of Jodi Benson was released in 1997 to promote the rerelease of The Little Mermaid soundtrack\n\nIt was also featured during the entire end credits of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection release of The Little Mermaid also to promote the soundtrack's rerelease.\n\nThis was the first proper Disney chorus since Robin Hood in 1973 and the filmmakers stated in the DVD commentary that they were unsure of using a Disney chorus out of the fear that it would be deemed \"cheesy\". This chorus would be repeated for the majority of the renaissance until The Hunchback of Notre Dame in 1996.\n\nThe Swedish dub features Sissel Kyrkjebø, the Swedish voice of Ariel, singing over the top of the chorus, as Ariel, holding her final note through the choirs vocalizing until Eric and Ariel kiss.\n\nThe title character in The Timekeeper references the song, saying, \"Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?\"\n\nJodi Benson sang the song when she received her Disney Legend award in 2011.\n\nWhen filming reference for the scene where Ariel rises from the rocks, Glen Keane would act out the scene as a way to give Sherri Lynn Stoner an idea of how the scene should play out.\n\nThe scene where Ariel sings the last verses of the song (in particular her causing a wave to crash behind her) was parodied in The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning with Marina Del Rey, who adopts a similar pose, only to be slammed down by the wave before threatening Scuttle.\n\nA Muzak version of part of the song was heard while Giselle observes a fish tank in Enchanted, just before interacting with Sam, a character portrayed by Jodi Benson herself.\n\nA brief allusion to the original tale was made in the lyrics nearing the end, as Ariel says \"When's it my turn? Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore up above?\" (in the original tale, mermaids were allowed to go up to the surface at age 15).\n\nIn The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea, it is sung at the end by country singer Chely Wright.\n\nThe song's tune was also played at the end of the movie when Melody used the trident to dissolve the wall between the sea and the castle so everyone can be together again just before they sang \"Here on the Land and Sea\".\n\nFor Kingdom Hearts II, it was sung by Ariel twice. The first time was when she rescued Eric, and the second was in a minigame.\n\nIt is featured in the Once Upon a Time episode \"Poor Unfortunate Soul\", sung by Ursula.\n\nIn Zootopia, a parody of the song is seen on Judy Hopps' music player playlist under the name \"Part of Your Wool\".\n\nIn Ralph Breaks the Internet, Ariel briefly sings a parody of the song when talking with Vanellope about wearing a shirt.\n\n\"Of all the thingamabobs in this entire world. I never thought I'd get to wear a real... What's it called again? Oh yeah, shirt! [singing] I once had a dream that I might wear a shirt...\"\n\nIn the DuckTales episode \"The Lost Harp of Mervana!\", Webby directly references the song by saying, \"Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?\"\n\nIn 2021, Apple Inc. used the song in a commercial.\n\nAn instrumental of the song is featured as the opening for the theme of The Little Mermaid TV series, followed by \"Under the Sea\", \"Kiss the Girl\", \"Under the Sea\" again, then once more, \"Part of Your World\" and ending with \"Under the Sea\" once more.\n\nIn the 2022 Disney+ film Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers while not physically sung, the song was alluded during the scene where Jimmy the Polar Bear is planning to capture Flounder, he holds up a fork and tells him, \"How about this? Isn't it neat?\" (indirect reference to one of Ariel's lines during the song) just as he offers the fork to Jimmy and says, \"Come on, fellas. This is a genuine Dinglehopper,\" just before Jimmy captures him.\n\nIn Disenchanted, during the song \"Perfect\", Morgan Philip sits atop a wagon in a pose similar to Ariel as water splashes behind her from a woman with a bucket in homage to the final shot from the reprise of the song.\n\nThe song was also included in the Mickey's Fun Songs volume, Beach Party at Walt Disney World after the girls of the Fun Songs Kids encounter Ariel (played by Jodi Benson like in the movie) on the rock, but the first part of the first verse was removed.\n\n[]\n\nPart of Your World on Wikipedia\n\nMedia Films: The Little Mermaid (video/soundtrack) • The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea (video) • The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning (video) • The Little Mermaid (2023) (video/soundtrack)\n\nShows: The Little Mermaid (videography) • A Poem Is... • The Wonderful World of Disney: The Little Mermaid Live!
