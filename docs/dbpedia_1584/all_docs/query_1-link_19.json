        "text": "Experience Joy\n\nOn-Campus Events\n\nWhoever said college was all work and no play? Certainly nobody at George Fox! Our Student Involvement team, headed up by students, hosts an on-campus event for students every weekend, so there’s never a shortage of things to do!\n\nHere are just a few of the regular events that make campus life at Fox such a blast:\n\nI’ve worked with Student Activities for two years now, and it has completely changed the course of my college experience. I’ve really loved helping plan crazy events (up to 15 a semester!) and market them to the school, which is valuable experience for a future career.\n\nPublications\n\nLove to write? Take photos? Check out our student publications. The Crescent, our student newspaper, keeps the student body informed of what’s happening, while The Student Collective serves as a yearbook, packed with profiles, photos and fun memories from the year. And, for you creative writing lovers, we offer an outlet for your poetry and prose in The Wineskin."
