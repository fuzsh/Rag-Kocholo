        "text": "Equally influenced by R. Kelly and Barry White, Louisiana’s Tucka James is an R&B singer who can deliver “pillow talk” songs that recall the grooves of the 70’s, 80’s, and 2010’s. He kicked off his career in 2007, singing lead vocals with Keith Frank & the Soileau Zydeco Band. He introduced his solo career in 2008, along with his nickname “the King of Swing.” He soon became a regional Louisiana favorite, and opened gigs for Mystikal and Lenny Williams. His Love Rehab album landed in 2009 with songs like “Sex on My Mind” and “Myspace Love.” Forever King followed in 2011, then in 2015 he released Love Rehab 2. For more information on Tucka, visit www.tuckajames.com and follow @TUCKA on Facebook and @tuckakingofswing on Instagram.\n\nBursting onto the Southern Soul scene with his signature party-centric sound filled with R&B flair, King George has quickly become a fan-favorite. Based out of Hopkins, SC, King George exploded on the Southern Soul scene and rose quickly to headliner status on The Blues Is Alright Tour this past Spring 2023. His highly anticipated album, Juke Joint Music was released in 2022 after launching onto the music scene via YouTube in 2020. For old-school music lovers, King George’s music is the perfect combination of R&B, soul, and funk that is sure to get anyone to do a little two-step.

He is known for his soulful sound of music in the Blues/Southern Soul genre; however, he did not start out that way. Pokey Bear began his career as a rap music artist, but after doing it for a while decided to try other styles. His venture off into other styles of music would lead him to be the soulful singer that he is today. He was first recognized in music for his first two projects produced by Beat Flippa. Particularly his songs entitled “They Call me Pokey” and “Side Piece,” The song “Side Piece” happened as a result of a hook that was written by Heavy in which he asked Pokey to write lyrics to. He has worked with artists such as Tyree Neal, Adrian Bagher, Ms. Pat, Veronica Raelle, and Cupid. For more information on Pokey Bear, follow @Big Pokey Bear-JSP on Facebook and @bigpokeybearjsp on Instagram.\n\nBlues guitarist, vocalist, songwriter, producer and entertainer……just a few of the titles that describe the phenomenon of Theodis Ealey. This Mississippi native first picked up an instrument when his older brother, “Y” “Z” Ealey first taught him how to play at the age of four. Ichiban Records, a respected blues label in Atlanta, recognized Theodis’ multiple talents and immediately signed him to a deal in 1991. Over the next six years, Theodis and Ichiban Records would enjoy four very successful albums. The “Bluesman Lover” made lemonade out of lemons when Ichiban Records eventually closed its doors. Seizing the moment, Theodis Ealey used this opportunity to create his new label home, IFGAM Records. The 2004 “Stand Up In It” project was a runaway success as the #1 Single on Billboard’s Hot R&B/Hip Hop Singles Sales Chart for five consecutive weeks, debuting at #5 on Billboard’s Blues Album Chart and #69 on Billboard’s R&B/Hip Hop Charts. For more information on Theodis Ealey, visit TheodisEaley.com and follow @Theodis Ealey Official on Facebook, @theodisealey on Instagram and @theodisealey on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nJawonn Smith, better known by his stage name J-Wonn, is a soul singer that hails from Jackson, MS and has built a name for himself following the release of his hit single “I Got This Record.” His love of Blues came from growing up around his mother and grandmother, who would often sing around the house. At the age of 13, J-Wonn began writing music of his own and went on to write for many Blues and Soul singers. One of his proudest writing credits came from penning a track for the legendary soul artist Lenny Williams. During high school, he was a member of a hip hop group that also included elements of R&B. The group gained an artist development deal and it helped Smith to learn a lot about navigating the music industry. It also gave him an opportunity to grow as an artist. J-Wonn’s latest single entitled “Move On” is available on all digital & video platforms. J-Wonn followed up “I Got This Record” with several other hits that were in continuous rotation on Southern Soul radio stations across the Southeast region. He has also won several awards from various outlets including Best Entertainer, Artist of the Year and Best New Single. He finished working on his second full-length album The Legacy which had led to collaborations with a wide range of different artists and an expansion of his brand of J-Wonn’s world to new ears. His latest single entitled “Move On” was also released on video on his VEVO channel. For more information on J-Wonn, please visit www.J-WONN.com and follow @jwonn on Facebook.\n\nHailing from the Mississippi Delta, West's voice carries the weight of generations of blues legends and the passion of her own experiences. With a mesmerizing stage presence and a voice that's equal parts gravel and honey, West Love has earned a reputation as a modern-day blues torchbearer. She weaves tales of love, loss, and life's struggles into every note, evoking raw emotions that resonate deep within the listener's soul. West's distinctive guitar skills, inspired by the greats like Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters, complement her evocative vocals, creating a sound that's both timeless and contemporary.
