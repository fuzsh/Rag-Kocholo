        "text": "Convincement as Event\n\nIn its peculiar Quaker usage, the word “convincement” referred to a revolutionary event in which a person was convicted of sinfulness and raised into spiritual life by the light and power of Christ within. I use the word “event” here in a peculiar sense as well: with Alain Badiou’s philosophy in mind, I intend it to refer to the disruptive emergence of an element that had been excluded or repressed in the construction of a society’s standard worldview. “An Event happens when the excluded part appears on the social scene, suddenly and drastically. It ruptures the appearance of normality, and opens a space to rethink reality …. An Event is something akin to a rip in the fabric … of the social order. It is traumatic for the mainstream, and exhilaratingly transformative for participants.” In George Fox’s convincement, that which was structurally excluded from normative Christianity—namely, the biblical teaching of the present availability of the power and wisdom of God in the human psyche —re-emerged, breaking apart that structure from the center. It was a revolutionary event for Fox, for his early followers, and for their society.\n\nIn what is probably the best-known passage in his journal, Fox provides an account of that event, which he places in 1647. Like a narrative in scripture, the story, even if its historicity is uncertain, dramatizes and communicates religious experience and teaching in a memorable way. As we will see, it also helps Fox construct a “textual self” as divinely-ordained father and leader of God’s people.\n\nThe story is like scripture also in that it serves as a screen for the projection of readers’ presuppositions. Its assertions that “There is one, even Christ Jesus, that can speak to thy condition” and “this I knew experimentally” are appropriated today by competing Quaker ideologies that bear little resemblance to the subversive religion that followed on Fox’s convincement. But that religion was already being normalized during his lifetime: influential Quakers such as William Penn, Robert Barclay, and Thomas Ellwood (the editor of Fox’s journal) revised it for respectability within the tradition it had sought to upend. All of that and more has colored readings of the convincement narrative. In this analysis, I have attempted to set aside such influences in hope of better understanding Fox’s report. In so doing, I have found that what Fox describes is a set of Bible-based cognitions carrying powerful affective impact and leading him to believe that God’s kingdom would be fulfilled in and through him.\n\n▼\n\nGood Soil for the Seed: Fox’s Condition\n\nThe convincement narrative is the climax of a series of revelatory insights that Fox often calls “openings”—applications of scripture to the conditions he perceived within and around him. The following, which echoes phrases from 1 John 3:14 (“We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.”) and 1 John 5:1 (”Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.”), is typical of them:\n\nAbout the beginning of the year 1646 … a consideration arose in me, how it was said that all Christians are believers, both Protestants and Papists; and the Lord opened to me that, if all were believers, then they were all born of God, and passed from death to life, and that none were true believers but such ….\n\nAs that passage illustrates, Fox’s thought and experience were structured by his reading of the Bible. The following lines from 1 John 2, in which the potentially disruptive “excluded part” may be perceived by the reader who is prepared to question Christianity’s traditional paradigm, are particularly relevant to our investigation:\n\nLittle children, it is the last time [Gk. eschatē hōra]: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us. But ye have an unction [i.e., anointing] from the Holy One, and ye know all things. … (vv. 18-20)\n\nThese things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you. But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him. (vv. 26-27)\n\nThe concern about eschatology (“the last time”; the final days), warning about seductive antichrists, and doctrine of the inward anointing (Gk. chrisma; cf. christos) were at the heart of Fox’s developing religion. An incident from 1646, the year before the convincement event, illustrates the passage’s influence. Fox reports that when he disappointed his relatives by refusing to go to hear a priest with them, he “showed them by the scriptures [that] there was an anointing within man to teach him, and that the Lord would teach his people himself.” He had already tried to put the doctrine of the inward anointing into practice in his own life; still writing of 1646, for example, he says, “So neither them, nor any of the dissenting people could I join with; but was as a stranger to all, relying wholly upon the Lord Jesus Christ.” On the surface, that could be a one-sentence summary of what he will later present, seemingly as a new realization, in the convincement narrative. But there’s much beneath the surface. Fox’s remarks leading up to that narrative help to illuminate his state of mind at the time.\n\n… the apostates [i.e., defectors] from the life in which the prophets and apostles were, have got their words, the holy scriptures, in a form, but not in the life nor spirit that gave them forth [cf. 2 Tim. 3:5]. So they all lie in confusion, and … to fulfill the law and command of Christ in his power and spirit, … that they say they cannot do; but to fulfill the lusts of the flesh, that they can do with delight [i.e., they are misusing scripture to “plead for”—excuse—sin]. [Emphasis added.]\n\nAfter that complaint about the churches, Fox picks up his story, in which he and we will learn the surprising meaning of the phenomenon he has just described. He presents himself as having fasted and dwelt in solitude as did John the Baptist—and Jesus in the desert, who also was tempted (as Fox has previously noted in his journal ) before beginning his public ministry. Like the “suffering servant” of Isaiah 53, whom Christian theology sees as a prefigurement of Christ, Fox was “a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.” But he felt “the workings of the Lord” within. Writing now of 1647, he says,\n\n… my troubles continued, and I was often under great temptations. I fasted much, walked abroad in solitary places many days, and often took my bible, and sat in hollow trees and lonesome places till night came on; and frequently in the night walked mournfully about by myself: for I was a man of sorrows in the time of the first workings of the Lord in me. … I kept much as a stranger, seeking heavenly wisdom, and getting knowledge from the Lord; and was brought off from outward things, to rely on the Lord alone.\n\nFox’s distress about the apostasy of the churches was compounding his temptation and depression. He had repeatedly consulted Christian teachers, but he’d found their words impotent and their lives sinful. Christianity as professed and practiced was powerless to deliver him or others from the power of evil within, and no one could tell him why that was so or how it could be changed; consequently, he was fearful and near despair. That was his condition. But he had also been cast into the arms of solitude, scripture, and deepening insight.\n\n▼\n\nThe Annunciation\n\nThe narrative then builds quickly to the event, beginning as follows:\n\nBut as I had forsaken the priests, so I left the separate preachers also, and those called the most experienced people; for I saw there was none among them that could speak to my condition. And when all my hopes in them and in all men were gone, so that I had nothing outwardly to help me, nor could tell what to do; then, Oh! then I heard a voice which said, “There is one, even Christ Jesus, that can speak to thy condition.”\n\nThe audition marks the culmination of his being “brought off from outward things, to rely on the Lord [i.e., the inward anointing] alone.” From scripture, Fox has already known what the voice tells him, but until now he has failed to realize its radical import. Only at the edge of despair does his mind yield up the repressed, saving truth: the churches have suppressed and supplanted the living Christ, and Fox, by seeking spiritual knowledge from human beings, has abetted their deception. God, he believes, is now bringing all of that to an end through a revelation of cosmic significance. Fox is experiencing the parousia of Christ, what may be called the Second Coming, as a disruptive inward event, an event that will change him and, through him, the world. This is, indeed, “the last time.” The voice is directing him to “Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God” (1 Cor. 1:24b) at work in his psyche, judging, purifying, and empowering him to bring down the antichrists. Fox is ecstatic:\n\nAnd when I heard it, my heart did leap for joy.\n\nThat statement brings to mind some biblical passages with eschatological implications.\n\nPsalm 118 includes these apt verses:\n\nIt is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man. … I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me and art become my salvation. The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner. This is the Lord’s doing; it is marvellous in our eyes. This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it. (vv. 8, 21-24)\n\nIn the scriptures, the “day of the Lord” refers to the coming of God or Christ in judgment, a catastrophic time when, according to Joel 2, “whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be delivered”; further, “it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions ….” In John 8:56, Jesus says, “Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it and was glad.” George Fox, rejoicing to experience the day of the Lord inwardly, will also be the father of a great people on whom God will pour out his spirit.\n\nIn Luke’s story of Mary’s visit to her cousin Elizabeth, who would be the mother of John the Baptist, Elizabeth says, “as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy” (Lk. 1:44). Like the embryonic John in that story, the nascent prophet in Fox’s heart who will direct people to the living Messiah feels the joy of seeing that the fulfillment of the ancient hopes is at hand.\n\nThat fulfillment entails the defeat of God’s enemies. Isaiah 66:13-16 combines God’s comforting of his servants with his movement against his adversaries.\n\nAs one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem. And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the Lord shall be known toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies. For, behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh: and the slain of the Lord shall be many.\n\nAs we will see, Fox will later quote from that last sentence in summarizing his experience and mission.\n\nDuring the time before the ultimate fulfillment of God’s promises, even the just will suffer. In the Sermon on the Plain, Jesus tells his followers that they should rejoice under the coming persecution:\n\nBlessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s sake. Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets. (Lk. 6:22-23)\n\nFox’s thought is deeply colored by such eschatological images.\n\nIt is understandable that some contemporary Quakers, repressing the eschatological nature of Fox’s revelation, present his joy as a response to the presence of God or Christ. That reflects the modern notion that Quakerism is a religion which establishes the existence and immanence of God (or, more abstractly, “the Divine”) by subjective means: as William Wistar Comfort described it, “a portable and verifiable religion based on personal experience.” But that misreads Fox’s account. As seen in the passages about 1646 quoted above, that God is present and can guide him directly is not a new experience for Fox. Indeed, he has long known that inward phenomenon. He tells us in his journal that God was already speaking to him in 1643, when Fox was nineteen years old, and he implies that God had spoken to him at least since he was eleven. (In giving those reports, Fox tacitly acknowledges that, as he will say explicitly later on, even continual direct experience of God does not preclude apostasy. )\n\nNote, too, that he does not attribute the words “There is one …” to Christ; their source is left to the surmise of the reader (who should note the difference from Paul’s reported Damascus road experience, in which Jesus speaks of himself in the first person: see Acts 9:1-9). Indeed, Fox does not identify the source at all. However, the narrative’s explicit reference to Isaiah 43:13, which we will discuss in the next section, connects the voice’s assertion to God’s declaration in Is. 43:11: “I, even I, am the Lord, and beside me there is no saviour.” And that would call to mind passages such as Acts 4:12, “Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.” It appears, then, that Fox is describing an “opening,” an insight regarding the meaning and proper application of scripture. In any case, it is not simply another “experience of direct unmediated encounter with the Divine” that makes Fox’s heart leap. Rather, as his text tells us, his joy arises in response to a message conveyed by a voice in his mind; that is, to a cognitive insight, a scripture-mediated revelation in words.\n\nWe see further indication of that as the revelation unfolds. (Please note that, although I have split the narrative in order to facilitate analysis, the following sentences should not be isolated in thought from what precedes them in Fox’s text. The narrative is a unity.)\n\nThen the Lord let me see why there was none upon the earth that could speak to my condition, namely, that I might give him all the glory. For all are concluded under sin, and shut up in unbelief, as I had been, that Jesus Christ might have pre-eminence, who enlightens, and gives grace, faith, and power.\n\nWe have noted the Lord’s pronouncement in Isaiah 43 that “beside me there is no savior.” Prior to that, in 42:8, he said, “I am the Lord, … and my glory I will not give to another.” Scripture insists that God is the sole source of spiritual knowledge and power, and “neither is there salvation in any other”: the glory of deliverance is his alone. But the churches have tried to usurp God’s prerogative.\n\nHad Providence not ensured that he could be helped by no human being, Fox sees, he may have become a follower of a humanly-devised system, diverted from the direct inward judgment and guidance of Christ by “dark inventions of fallen man” and remaining “concluded under sin, and shut up in unbelief.” The latter phrase combines Gal. 3:22a, “But the scripture has confined [sunekleisen: shut up; enclosed] all under sin,” and Romans 11:32a, “For God hath concluded [sunekleisen] them all in unbelief.” As we have seen, Fox had earlier discerned that “if all were believers, then they were all born of God, and passed from death to life; and that none were true believers but such.” Now reborn, he sees that the church’s lack of true belief and practice has been God’s doing: while allowing Antichrist to present an ersatz, external Christ, God has hardened Christians’ hearts and minds against Truth.\n\nAll has happened, Fox sees, according to God’s plan of salvation. What Paul wrote of those who did not accept his proclamation, Fox would apply to the church in its various forms—those who, contrary to what they profess, “stand against Christ as the Jews did.” Here are Paul’s statements in context:\n\nBut the scripture has confined all under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe. But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. (Gal. 3:22-23)\n\nFor as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief: even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy. For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all. (Rom. 11:30-32)\n\nPaul’s words would seem to be addressed directly to George Fox. As life experience and scripture illuminate each other, Fox sees that the Christian churches are apostates and impostors, all of them “concluded under sin, and shut up in unbelief.” He sees, too, that the true church, the actual body of Christ in this world, is to be restored through the mercy of his mission. The content of the revelation is, then, threefold: Fox is freed from the sin of seeking wisdom from human beings as the living Christ is affirmed as the only teacher; his insights about the churches are resolved into a vision of God’s plan and its imminent fulfillment; and his reception of those revelations implies a commission as eschatological prophet.\n\nHis faith now fully invested in Christ alone, Fox can say, “all are concluded under sin, and shut up in unbelief, as I had been” (emphasis added). Trusting solely in the inward anointing, he knows the Truth—the living power and wisdom of God within—and the Truth is disenclosing him, setting him free from false belief, sin, and despair. That process will take some time to reach completion, but the decisive breakthrough, the evental moment, has occurred.\n\n▼\n\nExperimental Knowledge\n\nFox concludes the account with a triumphant exclamation:\n\nThus when God doth work, who shall let it? and this I knew experimentally.\n\nTwo of those words, “let” and “experimentally,” are used there in ways that will be unfamiliar to most readers in the twenty-first century. Both will need explication. We’ll begin with the latter.\n\nThe word “experimentally” raises questions of signification and syntactical reference. In other words, to which concept or concepts does it point, and to which element or elements of Fox’s story does it connect the concept(s)?\n\nFirst, the signification. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, in Fox’s day the word “experimental” could mean “coming within the range of experience”; “based on or derived from experience as opposed to mere testimony or conjecture”; “related to experiment”; and, in a specifically religious sense, referring to “practical experience of the influence of religion on the powers and operations of the soul.” I think that each of those senses is harbored, to a greater or lesser degree, in Fox’s use of the term, but that the religious sense is paramount.\n\nIn Blown By the Spirit, David R. Como states that the “use of the language of ‘experiment’ to distinguish the cold, formal knowledge of scripture from a heartfelt, experiential, and effectual knowledge” was among the “ubiquitous godly tropes” employed by Puritans and others in Fox’s time, as was the belief that “only such ‘experimental’ knowledge could save.”\n\nAll orthodox puritans held that for the word [i.e., the Bible] to be effectual, the stories and letters of scripture needed to have a powerful effect on the listener’s heart. This was typically called “experimental” knowledge, and … it was central to puritan practical divinity, a cornerstone of what Thomas Hooker called “heart religion.”\n\nFox knew scripture very well and sought to follow it strictly, as we can readily discern in such positions as his refusal to accept human teachers, respect persons, swear oaths, or use “carnal weapons.” He found, however, that scripture, regarded by others as the word of God, in fact pointed away from itself to Christ the living Word. And it taught that the Word, who enlightens everyone, lives in his people. Taking scripture to heart, then, led Fox to Christ the light, wisdom, and power of God active in his psyche.\n\nHaving originally inspired scripture, Christ was now interpreting it inwardly, as he had outwardly for the disciples on the road to Emmaus (Lk. 24:13-32). Although Fox’s reading of scripture and his negative experiences with Christianity had led him to deny human teachers, he had been unable to maintain that stance until the knowledge became experimental—until, having failed to find salvific power and wisdom through human interpreters, he acknowledged his error and submitted himself to the one who opened scripture’s true meaning for the present time. “For though I read the scriptures that spake of Christ and of God,” he wrote, “yet I knew him not but by revelation, as he who hath the key did open, and as the Father of life drew me to his son by his spirit.” His convincement narrative recapitulates that of the Emmaus road disciples: Christ himself opened for them the meaning of scripture, how it pointed to him and thereby explained their life experience, but they were unable to recognize him as their living teacher until he had done that; then “their eyes were opened.” That revelatory process had “a powerful effect on the listener’s heart”: “And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?”\n\nFox uses the term “experimentally” himself just the one time in the eight volumes of his collected works, but we have instances of its use by other early Friends in which its meaning is clear from the context. The following example is from a different George Fox, known as “the Younger”:\n\n… wait in that Life which maketh you sensible of your condition, and you will feel the pure operation of the Word, smiting as a hammer, which will break your hard hearts into tenderness; Yea, you will feel them dissolved, melted, and changed, by the Power of the Word, as ye believe and wait in the same; and then you will know experimentally that the Word of the Lord is as a Hammer, and as a Sword, and as a Fire, and as Fuller’s soap; for you will feel it breaking and cutting down, burning up, and washing out all the hard, fruitless, defiling nature; … Now as you come to feel this within, you come to witness his Baptism with the Holy Spirit and with Fire; … And here Christ’s work comes truly to be known, which is to destroy the Devil and his Works, to blot out Transgression, to take away Sin, to cause the old things to pass away, and to make all things new.\n\nCompare that passage to this from the influential preacher John Everard, an immediate precursor of the Quakers:\n\nHave you suffered such Contradiction between the flesh and and the Spirit that these Wars and Terrors and Rumours of Wars have struck through the very Soul of you, that you have felt it as bitter as Gall, as bitter as Bitterness itself? For saith our Lord, Luke. 21, 22: “These be the Days of VENGEANCE, that all Things which are written may be fulfilled” …. This Work being gone through, you may be sure the Child is born to You, and To You a Son is given, else not. Tell me of what you will, of Education and good Nature, and the still Work of God’s Spirit, but I say unto you, except this Work be done in you, so that you can speak of the Work thereof experimentally, you do but be Fool[s] and extremely delude your own Souls.\n\nThe use of “experimentally” among Friends appears to have been consistent with then-contemporary religious usage.\n\nWe can characterize the elder Fox’s use of the term, then, as primarily religious but as not excluding other senses in the OED’s definition. It is evident from his account that he received knowledge, grace, and power through two means, the first serving as preparation for the second, and both reflecting the interpenetration of life experience and scripture. Considered as a process, Fox’s breakthrough was “based on or derived from experience” and even “related to experiment” —his repeated but futile attempts to obtain spiritual power and wisdom from human beings, illumined by his inspired understanding of biblical passages. More importantly, it involved “practical experience of the influence of religion on the powers and operations of the soul”—his scripture-derived, cognitive-emotional experience of being convicted of sin and turned to Christ the power and wisdom within, enlightened about God’s plan and its present unfolding, and commissioned as apostle. He could indeed “speak of the Work thereof experimentally.”\n\nThe syntactical reference of Fox’s “experimentally” has become obscured by selective quotation. For example, the convincement narrative is sometimes presented in a condensed form in which “And when I heard it, my heart did leap for joy” is directly followed, through the magic of the ellipsis, by the reference to experimental knowledge. That gives the impression that Fox’s “experimentally” refers only to the voice directing him to Christ, or perhaps to Christ himself speaking to him. But why would Fox tell his readers that the experience of hearing a voice was experiential? And if he intended to do that, why not insert that redundancy immediately after the account of the audition, rather than interpose a few sentences (for later Friends to omit)? The presence of the ellipsis—that is, the absence of Fox’s intervening words—not only breaks but also rewrites the text, alerting the critical reader to a possible repression of discomfiting content.\n\nRestoring the elided material, recalling the term’s meaning in the culture, and attending to Fox’s syntax, to the direction of his thought, and to his references to scripture, we see that the phrase “and this I knew experimentally,” while not excluding reference to the entire story, points specifically to its immediate antecedent, “Thus when God doth work, who shall let it?” That question is heavy with scriptural—and eschatological and missional—significance.\n\n“Let” there means “hinder,” “obstruct,” or “prevent” (as the disciples on the Emmaus road were initially prevented from recognizing the living Christ ). Fox is referring to Isaiah 43:13b, “There is none that can deliver [i.e., rescue] out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?” A little later, in verse 19, God declares, “Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it?” The divine, inward work of his convincement event, Fox believes, is the beginning of God’s eschatological “new thing”: as he and others would put it in the 1660 Peace Declaration, “that by the Word of God’s power and its effectual operation in the hearts of men, the kingdoms of this world may become the kingdoms of the Lord.” (“Word of God” refers, of course, not to scripture but to Christ the Logos.) And that new work, as Fox now knows from experience, shall not be prevented.\n\n“Let” meaning “hinder” or “prevent” appears in the Christian scriptures in a passage in Second Thessalonians that was crucial for the early Quaker experience. The passage is dense, but it can lead us to important insights of our own.\n\nNow we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and [by] our gathering together unto him, that ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled … as that the day of Christ is at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means: for [that day shall not come], except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed [apokaluphthē], the son of perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.\n\nRemember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things? And now ye know what withholdeth [katechon: letteth], that he might be revealed in his time. For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way. And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming: even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. (2 Thes. 2:1-10, paragraphing added)\n\nThe “falling away” is the 1,600-year apostasy of Christianity. The “man of sin” is the Antichrist, who, both within human beings and without, has usurped the place of God as revealer of truth and even object of worship. The epistle avers that the reign of “the man of sin” is part of the divine plan and that he will be “revealed,” unmasked, at the time appointed for the fulfillment of God’s promises. In the meantime, “the mystery of iniquity” has obtained, as “he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.” But now, through this evental revelation, he has been unmasked and taken out of the way in George Fox’s mind and heart. And through Fox’s proclamation and that of those who heed him, that eschatological event will spread over the world.\n\nOne of those who would heed Fox’s message was a Friend named Elizabeth Bathurst. Her An Expostulatory Appeal to the Professors of Christianity contains a remarkably apposite passage:\n\nSome said Lo here, and others said, Lo there is he whom thy Soul desireth: but alas! when I went out to seek him there, I could neither see his Shape, nor hear his Voice; then used I to retire into my Chamber to supplicate him in secret, whose Presence I could not meet with in those Public Assemblies; But yet still I looked for that at a distance (viz.) the Appearance of the Son of God, which was to have been had nearer at hand: sometimes searching over the Records of Scripture, if there I could have found him substantially, whom my Soul greatly desired to see: Oh but there I found him not, although I daily read the Reports which his Ancient Primitive Servants have left there upon record, concerning how they witnessed him, by virtue of the effectual working of his mighty Power in them; but what was this to me? Whilst I knew him not myself Experimentally working down Sin and Iniquity in me, and removing that that did let, and would let till it was taken out of the way, that so his own Righteous Scepter might bear rule over me. [Emphasis added.]\n\nThrough such “practical experience of the influence of religion on the powers and operations of the soul,” Fox and his followers believed, would come the full realization of the Kingdom of God in the world as “that that did let … was taken out of the way.”\n\n▼\n\nSummary: “The time is coming and now is.”\n\nThrough his scripture-mediated convincement, George Fox knows experimentally, not simply that a voice has spoken, but that the power of the now-unmasked “man of sin” is broken as Fox begins to yield to the Christ-power in his psyche. Further, he reads that event as a sign that the eschaton, the Reign of God, is coming to fulfillment: the day of the Lord has dawned; the Kingdom is come in power. Now that the mystery of iniquity has been opened, the reign of Antichrist will end as Fox exposes him, turning people away from the man of sin to the life-giving power of the authentic Christ within, the “hidden man of the heart” (1 Pet. 3:4).\n\nIn his “exhortation and warning to the pope, and all kings and rulers in Europe” of 1654, Fox summarizes his insight and proclamation. He describes the experimental element as feeling the power of God in one’s mind, an expression that should confound attempts to frame his religion as exclusively affective or cognitive. The exhortation’s eschatological urgency is striking, as the following excerpt illustrates.\n\n[T]he mighty day of the Lord is come and coming upon all wickedness, ungodliness, and unrighteousness of men, [the Lord] who will plead with all flesh by fire and by sword [Isa. 66:16]. And the truth, the crown of glory, and the sceptre of righteousness over all shall be exalted; which shall answer that of God in every one upon the earth, though they be [far] from it. Christ is come a light into the world, and doth enlighten every one that cometh into the world, that all through him might believe. He that feeleth the light that Christ hath enlightened him withal, he feeleth Christ in his mind, and [he feeleth] the cross of Christ, which is the power of God; he shall not need to have a cross of wood or stone to put him in mind of Christ, or of his cross, which is the power of God manifest in the inward parts.\n\nWith Fox’s convincement event, the final work of God has begun, and no one, not even the heretofore powerful Antichrist embodied in the Christian churches, “shall let it.” Indeed, the end is at hand for “the priests, … the separate preachers also, and those called the most experienced people” as well as for “the man of sin” in the heart. Christ, the divine Light within all, is come to judge and teach his people inwardly, and now, at this kairos—the appointed time for the fulfillment of God’s redemptive work—the exposed Antichrist he “shall destroy with the brightness of his coming.” And God is sending George Fox to tell everyone so. There is one, even George Fox, that can speak to their condition.\n\n◊"
