        "text": "Have you ever read This Is How We Do It? Matt Lamothe interviewed seven kids around the world and illustrated their lives — from what they ate for breakfast to what games they played. My kids were FASCINATED and would beg to stay up late to read more. Well, I’m happy to say that Matt just published another book…\n\nWe were lucky enough to get an early copy of All About U.S.: A Look at the Lives of 50 Real Kids from Across the United States, and my boys have already pored over it 100 times. Our favorite spread might be this one of a family in Maine. How dreamy does that look?\n\nThe family in Alaska was also very intriguing — and they ride snow machines!\n\nMatt interviews children from a diverse group of families — in terms of race, income, hobbies, number of siblings, family structure, you name it — so you see lots of different ways that kids grow up in America.\n\nAmelia from Iowa gets to help her dad fly a plane!\n\nEleven-year-old Betsy gets in trouble for reading while driving her power chair.\n\nI’ve always loved seeing the many ways people live in this world — which is why we did our Parenting Around the World series for so many years — and I can tell my kids are just as hooked. We’re planning to buy a stack of copies for birthday presents for friends and family over the next year!\n\nWhat kids’ books have you been enjoying lately?\n\nP.S. A foolproof birthday present (for $1) and three words that changed how I parent.\n\nMore to Love\n\n10 fun links, including a new romantic comedy and the unicorn of swimsuits.\n\nAfter my divorce, I realized I was capable of so much more than I had thought...\n\nAnd a cool approach to vacation meals.\n\nFrom a swear-y cake to a murder mystery."
