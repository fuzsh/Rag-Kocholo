After having been raised with a purely secular worldview and having witnessed firsthand much evil and suffering, Ty was completely opposed to the idea of a Supreme Being. “If a God exists at all,” he reasoned, “wouldn’t He have to be cruel to have made a world like ours?” Ty’s conversion as a teenager was founded upon the answer to that question. Since then Ty has given his life to the joyous task of sharing God’s good character in public seminars as well as through print and video media.

Each sermon, small group, and meeting I lead are a reflection of the gift of grace, God’s power.“\n\nShe is passionate about helping people create space in their lives to become deeply rooted in the love of God and serve the world from their passion and giftedness. She is the author of the Deep Calling Discipleship Series and a children’s book titled, God Loves Me and All My Feelings.\n\nShe writes “My understanding of God has come as I have lived this life journey. The things I’ve experienced and the presence of God in the midst of those experiences has changed me.

She loves working for the Lord and feels honored every time He chooses to use her, and believes she is nothing without her God. Roger and Kathy’s Family includes four adult children Yessenia, Deisy, Vanessa, Jonathan, and two granddaughters, Sara and Maya.\n\nNoah Washington is known as one who has never met a stranger. And for as much as he enjoys making people laugh, he also feels called to help them push past their comfort zones. His concern for those who struggle to settle into the fullness of their lives runs deep. That’s why he founded Inspiring Purpose© with a mission to help them live more intentionally as individuals and in their relationships. As Associate Pastor of the Emmanuel Brinklow Seventh-day Adventist Church in Ashton, MD; Dr. Washington, is focused on maintaining active worship and outreach experiences that bring people closer to God.
