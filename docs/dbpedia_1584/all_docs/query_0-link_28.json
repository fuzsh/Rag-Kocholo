        "text": "I Can't Stand The RainAnn Peebles\n\nAnn Peebles' \"I Can't Stand The Rain\" originated from a comment made by the singer to her husband, Don Bryant, when they were preparing to head out to a blues show and it began tipping down with rain.\n\nThe FlameCheap Trick\n\nCheap Trick hated the ballad \"The Flame\" but recorded it because they needed a hit, and the song delivered, going to #1.\n\nWhere Did Our Love GoThe Supremes\n\nHolland-Dozier-Holland originally wrote \"Where Did Our Love Go\" with The Marvelettes in mind, but they turned it down. Marvelettes lead singer Gladys Horton sang in a lower key than Diana Ross, so when The Supremes came to record the tune, Ross was forced to sing in a lower, breathier style than she was used to.\n\nTake It EasyEagles\n\nThe Eagles' first single, \"Take It Easy,\" was written by Jackson Browne, who was living in the apartment below Glenn Frey when he wrote it.\n\nSadeness (Part One)Enigma\n\nThe song \"Sadeness\" by Enigma (the one with the chanting monks), got its name from the French novelist Marquis de Sade, who believed sex had to be painful in order to be pleasurable - thus the word \"sadism.\"\n\n\"Private Eyes\" - The Story Behind the SongSong Writing\n\nHow a goofy detective movie, a disenchanted director and an unlikely songwriter led to one of the biggest hits in pop history.\n\nThe Untold Story Of Fiona Apple's Extraordinary MachineSong Writing\n\nFiona's highly-anticipated third album almost didn't make it. Here's how it finally came together after two years and a leak."
