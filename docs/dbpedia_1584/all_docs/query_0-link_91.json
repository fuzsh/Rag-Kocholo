        "text": "From Dolly to Taylor, the best country love songs ever recorded.\n\n\"Ninety-nine percent of the world's lovers are not with their first choice,\" Willie Nelson once said. \"That's what makes the jukebox play.\" It's a quote that sums up the appeal of songs about heartbreak, loneliness and, yes, being in love (for better or worse). It's the kind of wisdom we've come to expect from the genius who wrote \"Crazy,\" one of the greatest songs ever — and, it so happens, one of the most played jukebox hits in history.\n\nBut, thankfully, not all country songs about love deal in misery. Country music also has its fair share of wedding songs (Dan + Shay's \"Speechless,\" George Strait's \"I Cross My Heart\"), songs about first loves (Taylor Swift's \"Love Story,\" Trisha Yearwood's \"She's in Love With the Boy\") and tunes about lifelong love (Alan Jackson's \"Remember When\").\n\nWhether you're looking for a tune about falling in love with your soulmate, looking back on a life with your spouse or the bittersweet feeling of learning to let go of an ex — it's all here. No matter where you are in life, there's a country love song for you. Here are the 50 best country love songs of all time.\n\n1 of 50\n\n\"Forever After All,\" Luke Combs\n\nBefore his more recent pivot from beer-drinking songs to musical prayers of thanks for his growing family, Luke Combs previewed country Casanova material to come with what's still one of the most sentimental songs in his catalog.\n\n— Addie Moore\n\n2 of 50\n\n\"Love is the Foundation,\" Loretta Lynn\n\nThe title track of her 1973 album, Loretta Lynn's version of \"Love is the Foundation\" holds up against her more obvious classics. Songwriter William Cody Hall penned a chorus for the ages: \"And does it have to be right to be called love / When he gives me more loving / Than a lifetime of looking could ever find.\"\n\n— Addie Moore\n\n3 of 50\n\n\"Late to the Party,\" Kacey Musgraves\n\nAlong with Josh Osborne and Brandy Clark, Kacey Musgraves wrote one of the sweetest country love songs of the 21st century. It tells the tale of two lovers who don't mind being late to a gathering, so long as they're together throughout the night.\n\n— Addie Moore\n\n4 of 50\n\n\"I Need You,\" Tim McGraw and Faith Hill\n\nThis duet was performed by real-life married couple and country artists Tim McGraw and Faith Hill. It was written by David Lee and Tony Lane and made its debut in 2017. It charted its highest at No. 50 on the Billboard Hot 100 and earned two Grammy nominations in the country categories. This love ballad focuses on the idea of leaning into a longtime partner when all odds seem to be against them. It carries themes of Southern life and uses unique metaphors that underscore the significance each partner holds for the other. The passion between McGraw and Hill sets this performance apart and is one of the best duets to come out of the 2010s.\n\n— Ariel Garcia\n\n5 of 50\n\n\"Die A Happy Man,\" Thomas Rhett\n\nNowadays, few tell heartfelt love songs more frequently than Thomas Rhett. Typically, he looks to his own life with high school sweetheart-turned-spouse, Lauren Akins, and their four daughters. Few sound sweeter than this, a 2015 hit that remains Rhett's best song.\n\n— Addie Moore\n\n6 of 50\n\n\"Need You Now,\" Lady A\n\nRecorded in 2009, \"Need You Now\" won four Grammy awards and made Lady A into country music superstars.\n\n— Bobbie Jean Sawyer\n\n7 of 50\n\n\"Amazed,\" Lonestar\n\nCountry radio in 1999 was all about \"Amazed\" by Lonestar. The song — written by Aimee Mayo, Chris Lindsey and Marv Green — became a smash hit for the band and is still one of the most played country wedding songs.\n\n— Bobbie Jean Sawyer\n\n8 of 50\n\n\"I Love You,\" Martina McBride\n\nNo list of country love songs would be complete without Martina McBride's late '90s pop country gem, which was featured on the 1999 soundtrack for \"Runaway Bride.\"\n\n— Bobbie Jean Sawyer\n\n9 of 50\n\n\"When I Said I Do,\" Clint Black and Lisa Hartman Black\n\nClint Black joined the ranks of George and Tammy and Tim and Faith when he recorded the duet \"When I Said I Do\" with his wife, Lisa Hartman Black, in 1999.\n\n— Bobbie Jean Sawyer\n\n10 of 50\n\n\"Kiss an Angel Good Mornin',\" Charley Pride\n\nThe signature song of country icon Charley Pride, \"Kiss an Angel Good Mornin'\" does as well as any song from any genre at summing up the sweet and sensual elements of a happy, lasting marriage.\n\n— Addie Moore\n\n11 of 50\n\n\"Young Love (Strong Love),\" The Judds\n\nThe Judds' acoustic guitar-driven, blood harmony-filled songs offer a song for any season of a fan's life. Here, Naomi and Wynonna describe a feasible fairy tale in which two young lovers forge ties that'll survive the ups and downs of the life they'll soon share.\n\n— Addie Moore\n\n12 of 50\n\n\"I'd Love to Lay You Down,\" Conway Twitty\n\nThough it's more lustful than most of our other choices, this No. 1 hit from 1980 is among the more romantic selections in Conway Twitty's catalog.\n\n— Addie Moore\n\n13 of 50\n\n\"Two Sparrows in a Hurricane,\" Tanya Tucker\n\nWhen it comes to country love songs about lifelong love, it doesn't get better than Tanya Tucker's \"Two Sparrows in a Hurricane,\" which follows a couple as they navigate life's ups and downs from teenage love to old age.\n\n— Bobbie Jean Sawyer\n\n14 of 50\n\n\"You Had Me From Hello,\" Kenny Chesney\n\nKenny Chesney's third and final No. 1 of the '90s deserves consideration as one of that hallowed decade's best love songs. It was an instant \"our song\" selection for country fans, whether they were in wedding planning mode or nearing their golden anniversary.\n\n— Addie Moore\n\n15 of 50\n\n\"You're My Best Friend,\" Don Williams\n\nOne of the best storytellers and smoothest bass-baritone vocalists in country music history, Don Williams sang of the type of mutual respect and deep friendship at the core of any lasting relationship.\n\n— Addie Moore\n\n16 of 50\n\n\"Your Man,\" Josh Turner\n\nWith 10 words — \"Baby lock the door and turn the lights down low\" — Josh Turner carried Conway Twitty's torch into the 21st century with a deep baritone and the sultry lyrics of \"Your Man.\"\n\n— Bobbie Jean Sawyer\n\n17 of 50\n\n\"Speechless,\" Dan + Shay\n\nSnap-along pop country never sounded more helplessly romantic than it does on one of Dan + Shay's signature hits. It's Exhibit A in the case for Dan + Shay being country music's best love balladeers since the heyday of Kenny Rogers.\n\n— Addie Moore\n\n18 of 50\n\n\"God Gave Me You,\" Blake Shelton\n\nBlake Shelton's romantic side has shown over the years through such songs as 2017's \"I'll Name the Dogs\" and, of course, the Gwen Stefani duet \"Happy Anywhere.\" Our pick dates back to 2011, and it's the swoon-worthy song of praise \"God Gave Me You.\"\n\n— Addie Moore\n\n19 of 50\n\n\"Mama He's Crazy,\" The Judds\n\nEveryone wants to meet a love they can introduce to mama. The Judds' 1984 hit, \"Mama He's Crazy\" became the second No. 1 country hit for the mother-daughter duo.\n\n— Bobbie Jean Sawyer\n\n20 of 50\n\n\"Little Moments,\" Brad Paisley\n\nBrad Paisley's \"Little Moments\" ignores grandiose gestures and focuses on the snapshot moments of a relationship that are truly special.\n\n— Bobbie Jean Sawyer\n\n21 of 50\n\n\"It's Your Love,\" Tim McGraw and Faith Hill\n\nTim McGraw and Faith Hill released their steamy duet \"It's Your Love\" in 1997. The song was the first in a series of duets the couple would release throughout their careers. The song must have been a good omen, since the couple have now been married for over 20 years.\n\n— Bobbie Jean Sawyer\n\n22 of 50\n\n\"Remember When,\" Alan Jackson\n\nSometimes, the most meaningful love songs aren't about newfound love, but a lasting love that's withstood years of ups and downs. Such is the case with Alan Jackson's \"Remember When,\" a tribute to his lasting love with his wife, Denise.\n\n— Bobbie Jean Sawyer\n\n23 of 50\n\n\"I Swear,\" John Michael Montgomery\n\nReleased in 1994, John Michael Montgomery's \"I Swear\" became a No. 1 hit on the country charts. But the song was so beloved that the pop group All-4-One covered the song and had a smash hit on the pop charts that same year.\n\n— Bobbie Jean Sawyer\n\n24 of 50\n\n\"Strawberry Wine,\" Deana Carter\n\nDeana Carter summed up the bittersweet nostalgia of first love when she sang \"I still remember when thirty was old and my biggest fear was September, when he had to go.\"\n\n\"Strawberry Wine,\" penned by Matraca Berg and Gary Harrison, was featured on Carter's 1996 album Did I Shave My Legs for This?\n\n— Bobbie Jean Sawyer\n\n25 of 50\n\n\"Together Again,\" Buck Owens\n\nAlong with definitive country band the Buckaroos, Buck Owens set the standard with this weepy-yet-romantic tune from 1964. Though there's better country love songs lyrically, Tom Brumley's steel guitar accompaniment on \"Together Again\" may forever be unmatched.\n\n— Addie Moore\n\n26 of 50\n\n\"Deeper Than the Holler,\" Randy Travis\n\nAs the first verse of \"Deeper Than the Holler\" explains, Randy Travis doesn't relate to saccharine pop songwriters' greeting card-ready cliches. He doesn't need to, because he can sum up true love just as effectively in rural terms.\n\n— Addie Moore\n\n27 of 50\n\n\"The Chair,\" George Strait\n\nOne of the best story-songs of its time, George Strait's 1985 hit \"The Chair\" has one of the best nervously botched pickup lines in any song: \"Can I drink you a buy?\"\n\n— Addie Moore\n\n28 of 50\n\n\"The Bones,\" Maren Morris\n\nThe comparison of lasting love to a house built on a strong foundation is hardly new. That said, few have used the trope better than Maren Morris did when co-writing this No. 1 from 2019. It got its flowers from the industry, winning both Song of the Year and Single of the Year at the 2020 CMA Awards, as well as Song of the Year at the 2021 ACM Awards.\n\n— Addie Moore\n\n29 of 50\n\n\"I Love the Way You Love Me,\" John Michael Montgomery\n\nThis track from John Michael Montgomery's 1992 debut album Life's a Dance became his first No. 1 single and won the ACM Song of the Year in 1993. Written by Victoria Shaw and Chuck Cannon, the song explores and admires the quirks and habits of a partner that help get the singer out of their comfort zone, deepening the appreciation they feel for their significant other. The lyrics describe appreciation for various aspects of their partner: \"And I like the way your eyes dance when you laugh / And how you enjoy your two hour bath...\" It's a song that celebrates two lovers who have a deep appreciation for one another and the way their love is expressed and reciprocated.\n\n— Ariel Garcia\n\n30 of 50\n\n\"Crazy,\" Patsy Cline\n\nWidely regarded as one of the best country songs ever written, \"Crazy\" — penned by Willie Nelson — became Patsy Cline's signature song when she recorded it in 1961.\n\n— Bobbie Jean Sawyer\n\n31 of 50\n\n\"My Favorite Memory,\" Merle Haggard\n\nMerle Haggard makes our list with a 1981 selection that's in the same mold as some of Willie Nelson's most sentimental material. It's among the many romantic selections by a great American poet and foundational country singer.\n\n— Addie Moore\n\n32 of 50\n\n\"Feels So Right,\" Alabama\n\nThe cousins in legendary country band Alabama turned down their amps for \"Feels So Right\" so Randy Owen could croon a Kenny Rogers-caliber love ballad. Comparable sentimental tunes in Alabama's catalog include \"Close Enough to Perfect.\"\n\n— Addie Moore\n\n33 of 50\n\n\"Islands in the Stream,\" Kenny Rogers & Dolly Parton\n\nSince its release in 1983, \"Islands in the Stream\" has gone down as one of the best duets in all of country music. Although it was originally written by the BeeGees for Diana Ross, it was rewritten as a duet and partnered Kenny Rogers with Dolly Parton. It was the first single off of Rogers' album Eyes That See In The Dark and quickly became each artist's second hit single after Rogers' \"Lady\" and Parton's \"9 to 5.\" By 1984, the song took the No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 spot from \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" by Bonnie Tyler, which was released the same year. The rest was country music history.\n\n— Ariel Garcia\n\n34 of 50\n\n\"Bless the Broken Road,\" Rascal Flatts\n\nAlthough it has been recorded by several different artists including the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, this song was made most famous by Rascal Flatts and has gone down as one of the best country love songs of all time. \"Bless the Broken Road\" makes the listener take an inventory of the past and remember all the things that happened that led them to where they are or who they are with now. It earned Rascal Flatts several music awards including a Grammy for Best Country Song. With lead singer Gary LeVox's powerhouse vocals, this is one of those timeless classics that you can belt out alongside your lover on a romantic road trip.\n\n— Ariel Garcia\n\n35 of 50\n\n\"If Tomorrow Never Comes,\" Garth Brooks\n\n\"If Tomorrow Never Comes\" is the song that is credited with kickstarting Garth Brooks' career. After he was heard performing it in a cafe, Brooks caught the attention of Capitol Records, and he went on to be extremely successful in the country music space. It was his first No. 1 hit single and continues to be one of the most provocative love songs in the genre. The song transcends the barriers of just romantic love, making it applicable to just about anyone special in your life. \"If Tomorrow Never Comes\" is an anthem that encourages the listener to appreciate what they have before it's gone, as tomorrow is never promised.\n\n— Ariel Garcia\n\n36 of 50\n\n\"How Do I Live Without You,\" Trisha Yearwood\n\nThis classic love song was written by Diane Warren and initially performed by LeAnn Rimes for her album You Light Up My Life: Inspirational Songs. It became the center of controversy after a version by Trisha Yearwood was featured in the film \"Con Air\" and both versions were released to radio on the same day in 1997. It's Yearwood's version, however, that has gone down as one of the best country love songs of all time — although both artists brought their own unique flair to it. The tune explores themes of love, loss and passionate romance. When Yearwood sings, \"Without you there'd be no sun in my sky / There would be no love in my life / There'd be no world left for me...\" her vocal delivery conveys the love and longing that makes this song hit like an arrow to the heart.\n\n— Ariel Garcia\n\n37 of 50\n\n\"All Your'n,\" Tyler Childers\n\n\"All Your'n\" is probably one of the more recognizable songs to come from Tyler Childers' catalog. Released in 2019, the bluegrass-flavored song quickly became a fan favorite. The tune expresses an unwavering love for a partner despite conflicts and challenges that may come with life on the road. Although \"All Your'n\" never made the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and came in at No. 46 on Hot Country Songs chart, it remains one of the most recognizable singles by Childers despite its lack of recognition on mainstream radio. The song pays tribute to a history marked by hardship, endurance and pure affection. The lyrics provide insight into the foundational perspective Childers evolved for his lover when he says, \"The goddess in my Days Inn pen / The muse I ain't refusing / The part of me that ain't around / I'm always talking to...\". This song is ideal for dedicating to a significant other who's been there for you through it all.\n\n— Ariel Garcia\n\n38 of 50\n\n\"Cover Me Up,\" Jason Isbell\n\nThis moving love song was written by Jason Isbell and was originally featured as the opening track on his 2013 album Southeastern. It's well known that Isbell penned the song for his wife at the time, Amanda Shires, as she stuck beside him throughout his journey to sobriety. The song is a raw and vulnerable expression that holds layers of emotional depth. Isbell's original release gained critical acclaim, and the song was covered by Morgan Wallen in 2019. Wallen's rendition received the most commercial success. It has also been covered by Rodney Atkins and Zac Brown Band, further showing how integral this song has become in the country genre.\n\n— Ariel Garcia\n\n39 of 50\n\n\"Butterflies,\" Kacey Musgraves\n\n\"Butterflies\" was one of two singles (with \"Space Cowboy\") released together from Kacey Musgraves' Grammy Award-winning album Golden Hour. Co-written by Musgraves, Natalie Hemby and Luke Laird, the slow-tempo tune perfectly captures that feeling of infatuation with a new romantic interest. The song was written shortly after Musgraves met her now-ex-husband and fellow singer-songwriter, Ruston Kelly. The inspiration, paired with the dynamic butterfly metaphor and the song's gentle instrumentation, makes for a unique listening experience. The music, lyrics and Musgraves' vocal delivery convey a whimsical, dream-like feeling that perfectly relates to the idea of new love. It's an ideal addition to any Valentine's Day, anniversary or date night playlist.\n\n— Ariel Garcia\n\n40 of 50\n\n\"She's in Love With the Boy,\" Trisha Yearwood\n\nAh, forbidden love. It's been the subject of countless plays, books, movies and, of course, one of the greatest '90s country songs ever: Trisha Yearwood's \"She's in Love With the Boy.\" This tale of Katie and Tommy is the stuff of small-town legend: The two characters (along with Katie's overprotective father and understanding mother) feel like folks you know from your own home town — a reminder of the universal experience of young love.\n\n— Bobbie Jean Sawyer\n\n41 of 50\n\n\"Love Story,\" Taylor Swift\n\nTrisha Yearwood's \"She's in Love with the Boy\" walked so Taylor Swift's \"Love Story\" could run. This countrified take on Romeo and Juliet was the lead single from Swift's sophomore album Fearless and became an all-time anthem for couples who defied the odds.\n\n— Bobbie Jean Sawyer\n\n42 of 50\n\n\"Tennessee Whiskey,\" Chris Stapleton\n\nLong before Chris Stapleton taught it to practically every cover band, Dean Dillon and Linda Hargrove co-write \"Tennessee Whiskey\" deserved consideration as an all-time great country love song. Both David Allan Coe and George Jones tried to immortalize it, but clearly, this now-timeless tune was ahead of its time.\n\n— Addie Moore\n\n43 of 50\n\n\"Ring of Fire,\" Johnny Cash\n\nWritten by June Carter Cash and Merle Kilgore, \"Ring of Fire\" is one of Johnny Cash's most memorable hits and a reminder of the powerful impact of romantic love.\n\n— Bobbie Jean Sawyer\n\n44 of 50\n\n\"Whenever You Come Around,\" Vince Gill\n\nSometimes, the greatest love songs stem from unrequited love. Vince Gill's 1994 hit \"Whenever You Come Around\" is about a man who can't find the words — or perhaps the courage — to tell someone how he feels.\n\n— Bobbie Jean Sawyer\n\n45 of 50\n\n\"Forever and Ever, Amen,\" Randy Travis\n\nRandy Travis' \"Forever and Ever, Amen\" has stood the test of time as one of country music's most endearing love songs. As plain-spoken and true as only a country song can be, \"Forever and Ever, Amen\" can be considered one of the greatest country love songs ever written.\n\n— Bobbie Jean Sawyer\n\n46 of 50\n\n\"Cowboy Take Me Away,\" The Chicks\n\n\"Cowboy Take Me Away\" was co-written by The Chicks' fiddler, Martie Maguire, for her sister (and fellow bandmate) Emily's wedding. The song, an ode to getting away from it all with someone you love, went to No. 1 in 1999.\n\n— Bobbie Jean Sawyer\n\n47 of 50\n\n\"When You Say Nothing At All,\" Keith Whitley\n\nWritten by country hit-makers Paul Overstreet and Don Schlitz, \"When You Say Nothing at All\" was a No. 1 hit for Keith Whitley in 1988. After Whitley's tragic death, Alison Krauss and Union Station recorded the song for a Whitley tribute album. Krauss's tender vocals took the song back the Top 10 in 1995.\n\n— Bobbie Jean Sawyer\n\n50 of 50\n\n\"I Will Always Love You,\" Dolly Parton\n\nThe greatest country music love song wasn't written about a romantic love story. Dolly Parton wrote \"I Will Always Love You\" for her dear friend Porter Wagoner upon her exit from \"The Porter Wagoner Show.\" From then on, the song took on a life of its own. It was a No. 1 hit for Parton in 1974, then again in 1982 when she re-recorded it for \"The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas.\" (She's the first singer to score a No. 1 hit twice for the same song.)\n\nTen years later, Whitney Houston had the best-selling single by a woman in music history with her cover of the song. But even without the massive chart success, \"I Will Always Love You\" — a song about pure, selfless love — would still be the best country love song ever written.\n\n— Bobbie Jean Sawyer\n\nThis article was originally published in 2017.
