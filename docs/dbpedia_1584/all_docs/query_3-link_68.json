        "text": "Twenty-five years ago — on February 23, 1999 — Sleater-Kinney’s album TheHot Rock was released. The title track, \"The Hot Rock,\" is a reference to the 1972 action-comedy film of the same name directed by Peter Yates and starring Robert Redford and George Segal.\n\nSleater-Kinney’s album and song is but one example of the cross-disciplinary influences between music and film. Specifically for today, we’re thinking about songs that reference movies, whether in titles, lyrics, or both. Maybe a film title gets mentioned, or a memorable quote from a film is recast as a song lyric, or well-known characters find their ways into the narrative of a song.\n\nSo for today’s 9:30 Coffee Break, what songs that reference movies do you want to hear?\n\nRespond with your song ideas in the comments below.\n\nHave an idea for a Coffee Break topic?
