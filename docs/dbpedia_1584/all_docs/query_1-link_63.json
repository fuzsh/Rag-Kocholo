        "text": "Mac McAnally\n\nGuitar/Vocals\n\nFor his new album, Once in a Lifetime, Mac McAnally is indeed doing something he's never done before. To reflect the intimacy of his concerts, he arranged most of the material around guitar and percussion – yet he acknowledges that several of its tracks outgrew that simple set-up. And while many of the songs are new, he chose to include a few originals dating back to the early 2000s that seemed like a good fit.\n\nSo, with 12 songs pulled from different decades and musical directions, what ultimately ties all these tracks together? Simply put, it is McAnally's ability to see the silver lining, a perspective he's carried on his journey from being a shy, small-town kid from Mississippi, to working as a teenage studio musician in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, to be coming one of Nashville’s most respected (and self-effacing) singer-songwriters. Once in a Lifetime captures every aspect of his musical vision.\n\n\"I generally write whatever comes to me,\" he says. \"I'm not somebody who sits down and says, 'I need to write a hit song,' or this or that kind of song. I just follow whatever floats through my head.\"\n\nWhile writing \"Alive and in Between,\" McAnally drew upon childhood memories of Belmont, Mississippi, where his father was a school administrator and his mother played piano in the Baptist church. The song emerged from an art project, where novels were given to songwriters and visual artists, who would then create a piece based on their response to the book. In McAnally’s case, Harrison Scott Key’s memoir, The World’s Largest Man, sparked vivid snapshots from his own youth. McAnally translated those images into verses, then added a cool guitar riff he's been using for years while tuning or changing strings.\n\n\"The author came from the same part of the country as me and it woke up a bunch of stuff about my childhood – what it was like hanging with my dad, going to the drugstore, talking about football, politics, and religion,\" he says. \"That opened up that part of my brain that I haven’' been down into for a while.\"\n\nOne of the most uplifting songs on Once in a Lifetime is \"Almost All Good,\" where he's aware of challenging times but doesn’t let them cloud his vision. Propelled by EricDarken's percussion, McAnally accompanies himself on guitar–with the lively rhythms adding a joyful spirit to the track. And this is not mere strumming, as McAnally has won a record-setting 10 trophies as Musician of the Year from the Country Music Association.\n\n\"All the way back tothe beginning, my songwriting has been built around my guitar-playing because I’m not a very confident singer,\" he says. \"I was always trying to make a guitar part sound like a whole arrangement. There’s usually a bass part as a counterpoint in the main guitarpart–but I’m not a fancy guitar player. I don’t take a lot of solos. Part of what’s allowed me to work so long in the business is that of all the bands I was in, I've never really wanted a solo. I would sit and play rhythm forever.\"\n\nMcAnally notes that he typically sees three kinds of people at his shows: Those who have followed his career since his 1977 debut album; those who recognize him as the guitarist in Jimmy Buffett’s Coral Reefer Band; and those who remember his notable credits in countrymusic. The latter category is particularly impressive, with songs cut by Alabama (“Old Flame”), Kenny Chesney (“Back Where I Come From”), Sawyer Brown (“All These Years”), Shenandoah(“Two Dozen Roses”) and many others.\n\nUndoubtedly, Once in a Lifetime will satisfy all of those fans. “First Sign of Trouble” and “That’s Why They Call It Falling” are as quirky and quick-witted as the ‘70s output that made fans of Jimmy Buffett, Randy Newman, and John Prine (all of whom became friends and mentors). “Just Like It Matters” has that lonesome, real-life storytelling of classic country, while “Just Right” keeps the island vibe alive. In fact, it was written and recorded in Key West while Buffett was making his record; the Coral Reefer Band joined in the session,too.\n\n\"I'm interested in all kinds of music,” he says. “There's obviously some Buffett influence on a few of the things and I've been playing country music and gospel music all my life, so there’s that influence, too.\"\n\nAs for the title track, its cheerful message and buoyant melody wouldn’t be out of place on today’s country radio. McAnally and Nashville singer-songwriter Drake White composed it shortly after bumping into each other at a local breakfast spot. They casually chatted about getting together to write. Asked if he was enjoying himself these days, McAnally replied, \"Yeah,every day. Every day is once in a lifetime.\" White immediately replied, \"We need to get togetherto write THAT!\" White lends his vocal to the inspiring track, too.\n\nTurning conversations into song is one of McAnally’s greatest gifts, one that led to his induction into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2007. Two of the songs from Once in a Lifetime come from that era. He co-wrote “Good Guys Win” for the 2006 film, Hoot, and felt like its optimistic tone needed to be heard in this divided time. In addition, the bluegrass-flavored “Brand New Broken Heart” comes from a 2007 demo session of a tune he recorded with his fellow studio musicians, but never got around to pitching.\n\nHowever, a couple of tracks come from an even earlier time. Co-written and recorded by Jimmy Buffett in 1989, “Changing Channels” is one of the album’s most poetic moments – and a cut that McAnally’s fans have been requesting for decades. Meanwhile, he covers “Norwegian Wood” with just percussion, vocals and octave mandolin, in a sincere homage to the Beatles. “It’s just me celebrating how great they are,” he says.\n\nThe thoughtful lyrics of “The Better Part of Living” – and Once in a Lifetime as a whole – can perhaps be traced back to a phrase McAnally remembers from his childhood, when his mother would tell him to “make some use of yourself” on his way out the door. McAnally still adheres to that philosophy today. Asked about the experience of listening to these assorted songs that have now become an album, he modestly replies, \"I see a guy trying to be a good representation of a human being. I hope there’s something in what I do that in some way can make someone else’s life a little bit better, too. That’s really what I’m shooting for.\"\n\nOfficial Website\n\nNadirah Shakoor\n\nVocals\n\nI was born in San Antonio, raised in Los Angeles and I now reside in Atlanta. My maternal Grandfather was a singer as was my own Father so music has always been a big part of my life. When I was a little girl my parents would have me sing for their friends who would pay me a dime or sometimes even a quarter. I absolutely loved to sing and having others to sing for thrilled me to no end.\n\nIn our home on any given day music could be heard. If it wasn't the radio, or the record player, one of My Father's singing groups would be rehearsing in the living room. The voices and music of Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions, Diana Ross and the Supremes, Dionne Warwick, The Temptations, Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Donny Hathaway and the likes were my earliest musical influences.\n\nWhen I was 5 years old I made the declaration to my Mother that I wanted to be just like Diana Ross. I now know how blessed I am to have parents that supported and encouraged my musical interest from the very beginning. I also realize the significance of knowing at such a young age what I wanted. Of course I have had many other jobs since then but I have never veered too far off my musical path.\n\nIn the early eighties I was working as a loan processor, I was also recently divorced with a young child. One fateful day I received an offer to go on the road with a major recording artist for 3 months. I was excited but I was reluctant to quit my job for something that would only last 3 months. This was a defining moment in my life. No longer could I continue to treat music as a hobby only doing it part time.\n\nI made the decision to step out on faith and use my God given talent to make a living for my Son and I. It hasn't always been easy but I am very grateful that to this day I have not had to look back. I have been earning a living with music only for over twenty years now. I encourage anyone reading these words to go after your dreams with all your heart and never ever ever give up!\n\nAfter that first tour I continued to audition around Los Angeles and do studio sessions. My resume soon included tours with Howard Hewet, Paula Abdul, Al Jarreau, Janet Jackson and others as a back-up vocalist. At the same time I was involved with various bands of my own many times with other family members.. We did shows around town, recorded demos and set our sights on the ever elusive major record deal.\n\nIn 1992 while working outdoors, my Father was shot and killed by a stray bullet. I was devastated, we all were. About two weeks later I dreamed that I was out with friends and needed to stop home to check my answering machine. On it was a message to me from my Father, letting me know that he was okay and reminding me that I had work to do. Another defining moment for me I shook off the depression and wrapped myself in a cloak of my Father's love and belief in me and continued my journey. 3 months later I auditioned for the hip hop group Arrested Development and after working with them a year while still living in L.A. they asked me to relocate to their base, Atlanta. That was a wonderful time in my career. I loved the positive messages in their music and they way they related to our African heritage. I loved the fact that the group consisted of young men, women and an elder working side by side to bring a spiritual message to the days youth. I loved working barefoot too :) and I knew my Daddy would be proud.\n\n3 years later the group disbanded I found myself away from my family with a mortgage, a 10 year old son and no job. I made some calls and got 3 leads: The first was another popular hip hop group looking to replace their singer temporarily for an Australian tour leaving in 2 weeks. The second was to go on the road with Yanni to sing one song per show. The third was to go on the road with a jazz singer named Jimmy Buffett. I knew the hip hop gig was only temporary so that was out. The Yanni gig was paying really well but I knew I would have been bored out of my mind doing just one song a night. I'd had some jazz experience with Al Jarreau so I turned down two and went for the jazz gig. Imagine my surprise when I received the collection of Jimmy Buffett CDs and discovered it was not what I thought! Talk about a culture shock I was actually scared. Crying, I called my Mother and said \" I don't know if I can do this, I am an R & B singer with dredlocks and two rings in my nose who likes to perform barefoot! I won't fit in! She calmly reminded me that I needed a job and that if it wasn't meant to be I would find out soon enough. I worked through my fear and commenced to learning my parts. As I got more familiar with Jimmy's music I heard Caribbean influences, some Pop, folk, country, Rock and even a couple jazzy ballads. I paid attention to his lyrics and found myself thoroughly entertained and impressed by his story telling. I got a call from Jimmy's Saxaphonist, Amy Lee also an Atlanta resident. She'd called to welcome me to the Coral Reefer Band of which she had been a member for some time. Amy was so nice and reassuring I knew it would be okay. 13 years later and counting I now consider The Coral Reefer Band to be my family and I am proud to be a member. I have the utmost respect and love for each and every one of the CRB as multi talented artists and as really good people.\n\nIt's been a great journey so far and getting better every day. I just finished recording a new CD on Mailboat Records, honoring Jimmy Buffett, the music and the man. \"Nod to the Storyteller\" is scheduled for an October 14 release. My Mom, my brothers, aunts, uncles, cousins, co-workers and friends will celebrate the release at Margaritaville in Las Vegas on October 24, 2008. It's gonna be a fun affair that you don't want to miss. If you can make it please come celebrate with us.\n\nOfficial Website"
