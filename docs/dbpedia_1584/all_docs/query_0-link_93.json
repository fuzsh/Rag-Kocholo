        "text": "Last big workout… DONE AND DONE. Andrew had a donut for me at the end of my run. He is just the absolute best.\n\nLook how nice Utah has been to us! Yesterday’s weather was absolutely perfect. The snow has waited to come until we are in our taper and no longer doing crazy workouts. I started out yesterday with a long sleeve top on and arm sleeves. With each interval it just kept getting warmer and I finished with just a tank and shorts.\n\nThe workout sure did a number on my hair ha! I don’t know what happened but I had a lot of snarls by the end.\n\nWe did a 3 mile warm-up and then did the same workout we did 10 days before St. George this last training cycle. I averaged 5:26 for my mile repeats (ten of them… partly flat, mostly down) yesterday and that is 5 seconds faster per mile than I did right before the St. George Marathon. Those first 3 felt awful. I was worried I was really considering quitting then and there but with each one my body started to feel better. I am SO grateful for different team members coming to the workout to pace us (they aren’t training for a race but just came to help us which was so nice) and support us along the way. My 9th interval was my fastest too (5:21) wahoo!\n\nMy legs were crazy tired for the last interval but the workout built my confidence to see an improvement in my times especially because I wasn’t feeling great in the beginning!\n\nHere are just a few more pictures from our day:\n\nSometimes the 7 year old needs more naps than the 1 year old now.\n\nAdmiring the Christmas lights Andrew put up yesterday!\n\n——————————————————————————————————-\n\nTWO WEEKS UNTIL CIM! I cannot believe the race has come up this fast (even though some weeks felt like we were in slow motion with our training) and I am more than ready to taper. We have a total of 5 miles of speed over the next 13 days before the race and that definitely sounds doable after the last few months.\n\nI am going to be sleeping like a champ, eating all of the nutrients, drinking water and thinking all of the positive thoughts for the next two weeks.\n\nMonday: 9 miles @ 9:01 average pace\n\nTuesday: 8:05 miles @ 8:54 average pace\n\nWednesday: 6.5 miles with 1.2 miles of intense climbing up followed by a mile easy and then one mile fast (5:31).\n\nThursday: 3 miles @ 8:22 and it really felt weird to run a lot shorter than normal on a Thursday.\n\nFriday: Off!\n\nSaturday: 19.75 miles @ 7:24 average (Andrew was there to pick me up and I was tired so that is why I didn’t finish at 20 ha).\n\nSunday: Off!\n\n46.3 miles for the week!\n\n——————————————————————————————————-\n\nWhat was your best run last week? Worst run?\n\nWhat do you have going on today?\n\nAbsolute favorite donut right now?\n\n-Old Fashioned have my heart at the moment.\n\nI have a NEW HRG BABY post! Talking about this last week of pregnancy and my plans for breastfeeding. Check it out HERE!!!\n\n—————————————————————————–\n\nWhile I was on my run yesterday I was thinking about my running pet peeves and I thought I would share them with you today. Andrew also has a few of them to share!\n\n*When you accidentally hit the lap button during a race on accident. I HATE when I do this because then my watch is totally off on when I hit each mile etc.\n\n*When there is a long line at the porta potty in the middle of your race. This happened at our last race and we just wanted to get in and go on with our race.\n\n*When you run through an invisible (okay, slightly visible) cloud of bugs.\n\n*When your shoes are untied during a race= the worst. When your shoes are untied during a run = it takes too much energy to bend over to tie them. Rocks in the shoe are equally annoying.\n\n*A huge diesel drives by you and you get to experience the lovely black cloud that it leaves behind.\n\n*When someone takes your treadmill when you take a break to use the restroom at the gym… Even if you have all of your stuff on it and there are 4 other treadmills wide open! Yes, this did happen to me at our hotel last weekend. I had to go ask him if it was okay if I grabbed all of my stuff off of the treadmill ha.\n\n*You are running on a trail and there is another runner and you just keep going back and forth passing each other… it gets me all nervous and wanting to just ask them if we can just run together:)\n\n*You put your music on shuffle and for some reason it goes into the mode of playing ‘all of the songs you don’t want to hear in a row.’\n\n*When my phone dies while running because it is too cold outside… HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET MY SELFIES AND PODCASTS?!\n\n*You are so thirsty and looking forward to the drinking fountain up ahead (it’s all you can think about) and you get to the drinking fountain only for it to be broken.\n\n*You almost step on a snake (or other scary animal) because then for the rest of the run your heart rate is 180 bpm.\n\n*A bike whizzes right next to me when running and they are going so fast that you almost feel like you are going to fall over.\n\nAndrew’s list:\n\n*Chafed nipples (I have never personally had this happen and I don’t even want to imagine the pain that goes along with this).\n\n*When you trip on the sidewalk (he looked at me and laughed as he said this… he never has but I seem to do this often;)\n\n*When the person you are running with doesn’t stop talking and you are feeling like you might die and can’t reply to anything they are saying (I think the situation he is referring to is when he is running with me… this may have happened at our last half-marathon;)\n\n——————————————————–\n\nI’m not sure what’s going on here. Either my watch is broken and showing this 9:22 pace way too often or my body is beyond happy to be sticking at that exact pace most days each week.\n\nI was doing better with my strength training last week and as of today, I have done zero strength training this week. I had my mat out and weights out ready to put in some work but ended up just laying there eating fruit out of a bowl. Andrew walked into the kitchen and was very confused by what I was doing. TODAY IS THE DAY… I’m going to do some strength training but yesterday sure felt nice to just hang out on the ground eating pineapple.\n\nWe made it out for a quick errand, Brooke in her pajamas still and me in my running clothes. We are quite the fashionistas around here.\n\nIt’s back and it tastes better than EVER. When I first introduced my grapes and cottage cheese combo I think I scared a lot of people by it but over time people have realized how good it is. I have received many texts and emails about someone finally trying it and saying how good it tastes. I forgot about it for a while until it sounded so good yesterday. Welcome back CCG (cottage cheese grapes).\n\nA) I need to clean my sunglasses. B) I had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for lunch followed by a corn on the cob (with as much butter and salt as possible) as Andrew drove us to our Dr. appointment.\n\nWe had a doctor appointment yesterday. The kids beg to come… not sure if that is because they want to see the baby or because they know they have a bucket of suckers there.\n\nPS WE FOUND OUT OUR BABY’S SEX yesterday afternoon!!! We are super excited to tell you but we wanted to make sure to get ahold of everyone in our family first to tell them! We will share it tomorrow morning:)\n\nWe did our Thursday night family night yesterday instead of today (I’ll be gone tonight).\n\nMy dessert last night included tortilla chips and salsa. My favorite current dessert (even though at 10 pm I tried to talk Andrew into waking up the kids so that we could go to J-Dawgs for hot dogs).\n\nI hope your Thursday is a great one!\n\n—————————————————————————–\n\nPS don’t forget to check out my new HRG Baby post. I would love any advice from you on this topic!\n\n—————————————————————————–\n\nLast chance to guess… do you think we are having a BOY OR A GIRL!?! Share your biggest running (or working out pet peeves)… I love reading your answers! What is the most annoying thing that has happened to you during a race? Any cottage cheese lovers out there? What do you eat it with? Ever tried it with grapes?\n\nTurns out having a baby is a little bit of work and you don’t have all of the time in the world like you used to (for example this summer when I had no job and no life) and so I didn’t post in the afternoon, get ready for a full report of the day.\n\nBrooke really likes the night life and so we hung out most of the night and before I knew it it was 7 a.m. and we were on our way to drop off Billy at school.\n\nSometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. In this case it meant driving through McDonalds for some egg mcmuffins that hit the spot in the 2.3 bites it took me to inhale it.\n\nMy mom and I did a total of 41 errands (pretty sure I would have just slept and cuddled all day if it wasn’t for my mom helping me so much) and one of the things we did was go to Brooke’s first pediatrician appointment. She is clearly so happy to be in the picture with me. Fun fact: Brooke has taken more baths this week than I have showers this month… hmmm something might need to change. 2nd fun fact: stretchy leggings are all that will be worn for the remainder of 2012.\n\nHow awesome would that be to have those bowls just chillin in your fridge all day ready for you to top all of your meals with?\n\nHere is where life gets really exciting. We are finally staying at our new place. It is perfection (small but perfect). I love every little thing about it and our first meal at our countertop couldn’t have tasted better. I had the same tacos that I got on Tuesday but they weren’t as pretty so I will spare you the close-up shot.\n\nWe are going to go get real plates today but until then we will be paper plating it. Have you ever had Costco rotisserie chicken? You will love it if you like chicken.\n\nWe ate really early and so that constitutes that you should have three dinners spaced out throughout the evening.\n\n—————————————————————————–\n\nWhat are you up to today?\n\nLast candy that you ate?\n\nDo you have a tv show that you have watched a million times that you never get sick of?\n\n-Friends, Scrubs and King of Queens.\n\nI GOT TO RUN WITH FRIENDS yesterday and it made our 7.26 miles (@ 8:37 average pace) fly by. I met my friend, in the middle, during college and thanks to social media, we have been able to keep in touch since then. When I saw that she was in town I told her we needed to run together and catch up. I am so glad we were able to get in some miles together. Her sister-in-law was also able to come with us. She has a half-marathon next month! I have missed running with people so much so this was the best way to start the week.\n\nI got home before the kids were awake (and I found Beretta on the couch she is not supposed to be on… she is sneaky) so I was able to get in some stretching before it was go time! I’m telling you, these freezer Kodiakcake waffles are a fan favorite around here.\n\nI went with a protein shake yesterday for breakfast because I love getting a million berry seeds caught in my teeth;)\n\nA morning selfie with part of the gang.\n\nAlong with some important conversations.\n\nOnce Skye went down for her nap (Andrew was home doing school), Brooke and I left to go get my hair done. My good friend did it and I went a bit darker and got a trim while Brooke played with my friend’s kids!\n\nLunch was simple (turkey sandwich with peppers, spinach, mustard, bbq sauce and on Dave’s Killer Bread) and eaten on the couch without spilling somehow…\n\nFollowed by a bunch of these chips! Has anyone tried these? They are delicious.\n\nSkye hung out and blew bubbles while I ate.\n\nBrooke had gymnastics for a bit and her ponytail with short hair almost lasted the entire time.\n\nAfter gymnastics there were many meltdowns that occurred but that is part of parenting so let’s talk about this goodness instead. Andrew and I officially meal-planned for the week which is exciting and he made Grilled Lime Salmon w/ Avocado-Mango Salsa and Coconut Rice (minus the coconut rice part because we accidentally bought chocolate coconut water instead of the normal stuff). If you love salmon, try this recipe asap… and if you love happiness, try this salsa asap.\n\nThe usual night time routine.\n\nNetflix & Laundry.\n\n——————————————————————————————————————————————-\n\nA few random things to talk about because randomness is my strength in life:\n\n*If you need me at night (before my 9 o’clock bedtime;), you can find me here. Getting some stretching in while watching a show. I am finding that the older I get, the more I need to stretch to keep my running going.\n\n*Andrew has been practicing doing braids on Brooke’s hair. He is determined to be able to do Skye and Brooke’s hair over the years.\n\n*Megan has a new challenge for April and it is a plank challenge… I’m doing it if you want to join! I’m doing side planks for my challenge:)\n\n*I’ve shared Gwen’s episodes before but she has a new one about her awesome 10k PR! I love watching her training/racing/routine/perspective/life with a little one and I cannot wait to see what she does in the marathon!\n\n*WE OFFICIALLY REGISTERED for a marathon. Both Andrew and I will be running the St. George Marathon this year and I’m really excited. It will be two years since my last marathon so I’m excited to reintroduce my body to the pain train that is involved with the 26.2 miles on October 6th. I have 6 months and 2 days to get ready for this and plenty of half-marathons along the way.\n\n*Andrew’s phone stresses me out.\n\n*Last night was crazy windy so go ahead and cross all of your fingers that the wind disappears for my run this morning.\n\n*Another great podcast to listen to! I loved what Molly said about training for Boston, “I think I just changed my mindset, the point is getting used to being tired… embrace it and figure out how to deal with it… Every time I’m tired, this is good practice for the last 10k of the marathon.” I’ll be remembering this when I am tired during my hard workout tomorrow. I’m going to embrace it!\n\n——————————————————————————————————————————————-\n\nWhat races are you currently registered for?! Do you prefer signing up for a race asap, signing up right before race day or somewhere in the middle?\n\nSeafood… yum or nope? Favorite type of seafood?\n\nWhat does your email inbox look like? Do you have a bunch of unopened mail or would that drive you crazy?\n\nWhat is your workout today?"
