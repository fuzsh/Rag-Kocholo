        "text": "The 20th Century Fox Fanfare is a musical piece played to accompany the 20th Century Fox logo when it was displayed during the opening of the movie studio's feature films. The fanfare has been played before the first six Star Wars films, appearing in each episode of the original and prequel trilogies.\n\nHistory\n\nThe 20th Century Fox fanfare was composed in 1933 by Alfred Newman, a longtime head of Fox's music department from 1940 to 1960. In 1953, an extended version was created for CinemaScope films, and debuted on the film River of No Return.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1970s, the 20th Century Fox logo had all but been phased out. However, George Lucas enjoyed the logo and Alfred Newman music so much that he insisted it be used for his Star Wars films. The fanfare and logo have, since then, enjoyed a rebirth in usage.\n\nWhen John Williams signed onto the Star Wars project, one of his first moves was to compose the Main Title to Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope in the same key as the 20th Century Fox fanfare. He has said before that it was truly meant as another extension of the fanfare, and it has since been adopted by Star Wars film score buffs as part and parcel of the scores to Star Wars.\n\nWhen Sony released the original trilogy Special Edition scores, and the Ultimate Edition score to Episode I, each set included a recording of the 20th Century Fox fanfare.\n\nWhen the films were released digitally in April 2015 by The Walt Disney Company, the Fox opening, as well as the fanfare, were absent, disappointing some fans.[2] The Fox logo and fanfare was subsequently reinstated for the Disney+ and Ultra HD Blu-ray release.[3]\n\nUsage in Star Wars\n\nStar Wars: Episode IV A New Hope utilizes the original 1954 CinemaScope Extension recording by Alfred Newman from River of No Return.\n\nStar Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back utilizes a new recording by John Williams for the film. This version was used in all of the later Star Wars films as well.\n\nStar Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace Ultimate Edition soundtrack includes a newly recorded fanfare, also used on the original version of Return of the Jedi.\n\nSources\n\nStar Wars: Episode IV A New Hope\n\nStar Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back\n\nStar Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi\n\nStar Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace\n\nStar Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones\n\nStar Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith\n\nStar Wars: A Musical Journey: Episodes I-VI\n\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars\n\nNotes and references\n\n20th Century Fox Fanfare on Wikipedia\n\nThemes and leitmotifs\n\nIntroduced in Episode IV Main Title (Luke) · Rebel Fanfare · Imperials · the Force · Leia\n\nDeath Star · Jawas · \"Here They Come!\" · \"The Throne Room\" Introduced in Episode V The Imperial March · Han and Leia · droids · dark side\n\nwalkers · Yoda · Boba Fett · Lando Introduced in Episode VI Jabba · revelation · Ewoks · Luke and Leia · the Emperor · trap\n\n\"The Forest Battle\" · tension · mystery Introduced in Shadows of the Empire and Rogue Squadron Prince Xizor · Dash Rendar · Rogue Squadron Introduced in Episode I droid march · Duel of the Fates · Qui-Gon · Jar Jar · Darth Maul · Anakin · Shmi · funeral Introduced in Episode II conspiracy · Across the Stars · \"The Meadow Picnic\" · descent · Palpatine's machinations Introduced in Episode III General Grievous · Sith mystery · lament · \"Battle of the Heroes\" Introduced in Knights of the Old Republic I and II Revan · Bastila Shan · Kreia · Sith Triumvirate · Nar Shaddaa · Korriban Introduced in Clone Wars and Empire at War Advanced Recon Commandoes · Zann Consortium Introduced in The Force Unleashed and The Old Republic The Force Unleashed · Rahm Kota · Juno Eclipse · Redemption · the Commander\n\nValkorion · Aryn Leneer · Darth Krovos · Legacy of the Sith Introduced in The Clone Wars, Rebels, and The Bad Batch Admiral Yularen · clones · Ahsoka Tano · Plo Koon · Padmé Amidala\n\nSavage Opress · the Force (mystery) · Satine Kryze · Bad Batch\n\nRebels · Ezra Bridger · Sabine Wren · Hera Syndulla · the Grand Inquisitor · \"Glory of the Empire\" · Maul · Thrawn · Omega Introduced in Anthology Series Galactic Empire · Jyn Erso · hope · Guardians of the Whills · messenger · Rogue One\n\nHan Solo · Beckett's gang · Han and Qi'ra · \"Empire Recruitment\" · Enfys Nest · L3-37 Introduced in Episode VII Kylo Ren · Rey · Poe Dameron · March of the Resistance · Snoke · \"Jedi Steps\" Introduced in Episode VIII Rose · desperation · Luke in exile Introduced in Episode IX friendship · victory · \"Anthem of Evil\" · Knights of Ren · heroics Introduced in Battlefront II, Jedi: Fallen Order, and Squadrons Iden Versio · Cal Kestis · Second Sister · Eno Cordova · Main Theme Introduced in The Freemaker Adventures, LEGO Holiday Special, and Visions \"Main Title\" (Freemakers) · connection · Ronin · Am · Karre Introduced in Galaxy's Edge, Outlaws Symphonic Suite · Tara · \"Pinteeka Dub\" · \"Age of Jedi\" · Kay Vess Introduced in The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Andor Din Djarin (Main Title) · Grogu · Gideon · Bo-Katan Kryze · Boba Fett II\n\nThe Book of Boba Fett · Obi-Wan Kenobi · Main Title Theme Introduced in Tales of the Jedi and Ahsoka ronin · Baylan Skoll · Shin Hati · Morgan Elsbeth · New Republic See also: Songs\n\n[edit]"
