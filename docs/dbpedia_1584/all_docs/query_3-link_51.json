Lloyd: Penguin Book of English Folk Songs Mike Yates: Travellerâs Joy\n\nW. Bolton of Southport, Lancashire, sang The Golden Vanity in 1906 to Ann Gilchrist [VWML RoudFS/S146425] . In some versions of this widespread and well-known ballad with many versions, the enemy is Turkish, Spanish or French. Fundamentally, it is a story of betrayal and rarely does it have a happy ending. Sometimes the boy drowns and his ghost returns to sink his own ship. Mr Bolton explained that the “black bear skin” was the cabin boyâs covering at night; he wished to wear it as a disguise in the water. Version have been reported from Wiltshire and Cornwall, some cite the hero as being Sir Walter Raleigh.\n\nThe Carter Family of Virginia recorded Sinking in the Lonesome Sea in May 1935. This was included in 2015 on the 3 CD anthology of British songs in the USA, My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean.\n\nHorton Baker of Chilhowie, Virginia, sang The Turkish Rebelee to Herbert Halpert in 1939. This recording was included in 1978 on the Blue Ridge Institute album in their Virginia Traditions series, Ballads From British Tradition.\n\nDodie Chalmers of Turriff, Aberdeenshire, sang The Golden Victory to SÃ©amus Ennis on 16 July 1952. This BBC recording was included in 2012 on the anthology Good People, Take Warning (The Voice of the People Volume 23).\n\nPaul Clayton sang The Turkish Revelee in 1956 on his Tradition album Whaling and Sailing Songs From the Days of Moby Dick. He noted:\n\nThis ballad, commonly called The Golden Vanity, was known more often to sailors as Lowlands Low. The song has often been connected with Sir Walter Raleigh because of an old broadside text which mentions him as the deceitful captain. The ballad probably originated about the middle of the 17th century when the Barbary pirates (known as Turks) raided shipping in the English Channel and even looted coastal towns. I learned The Turkish Revelee from Horton Barker, one of Virginiaâs finest traditional singers.\n\nA.L. Lloyd sang The Golden Vanity in 1956 on Volume III of his and Ewan MacCollâs anthology of Child ballads, The English and Scottish Popular Ballads. Lloyd also later included it in his Penguin Book of English Folk Songs.\n\nEwan MacColl sang the Scottish version The Sweet Kumadee and Peggy Seeger sang the American The Golden Vanity in 1957 on their Riverside album Matching Songs of the British Isles and America. Kenneth S. Goldstein noted:\n\nThe earliest known text of this still-favourite ballad is a broadside from the Pepysian collection dating back to the last hall of the 17th century. In that version, the villain-captain is played by Sir Walter Raleigh, but in later texts ballad singers have deleted all references to him. Details of the ballad vary greatly, and aside from the usual havoc wreaked by oral tradition on names and places, an unusual amount of variation exists in the emotional contexts of the ballad ending. In some versions, the cabin-boy hero is amply rewarded (as in MacCollâs Scottish version) ; in others he is left to drown, or is pulled aboard too late and dies on deck. Some few texts even have the cabin-boy take his revenge by returning (in ghost form) and sinking the ship. The ballad was widely current in England, Scotland and America. The tune and one verse of MacCollâs version were learned from his mother, with additional stanzas collated from various printed sources. Miss Seegerâs American version was learned from the singing of her brother, the well-known folksinger Pete Seeger.\n\nEwan MacColl also sang The Sweet Kumadee (The Sweet Trinity) in 1964 both on his Folkways album The English and Scottish Popular Ballads: Vol. 2 and on his and A.L. Lloydâs Topic album English and Scottish Folk Ballads. The latter track was included in 2003 on his anthology The Definitive Collection. And the London Critics Group including MacColl sang Sweet Trinity in April 1968 at the Teatro Lirico in Milan, Italy; The concertâs recording was released in 1970 on their album on the Italian Albatros label, Living Folk.\n\nJohn MacDonald, aged 10 at the time, and John Reid, both of Birnam, sang The Golden Vanity in 1955 recordings (SA1955.049.6 resp. SA1955.044.A1). These were included in 2011 on the Greentrax album Songs and Ballads From Perthshire Field Recordings of the 1950s (Scottish Tradition 24).\n\nBill Cameron of St. Maryâs, Isles of Scilly, sang The Golden Vanity to Peter Kennedy on 21 November 1956. This BBC recording was included on the anthology The Child Ballads 2 (The Folk Songs of Britain Volume 5; Caedmon 1961; Topic 1968).\n\nSam Larner of Winterton, Norfolk, sang The Golden Fenidier in ca 1959-60 to Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger. This recording was included in 2014 on his Musical Tradition anthology Cruising Round Yarmouth. Rod Stradling noted:\n\nThis is obviously a fairly complete version of The Golden Vanity, which was a far more popular song than Iâd ever realised, with some 503 Roud entries—admittedly, more that half of these relate to books, and another quarter to broadside and other printed publications—still, 124 sound recordings isnât bad!\n\nIt may seem surprising that such a slim story should have such wide popular appeal, but it appears amongst both the Pepys and Roxburghe ballads, and has remained popular from the late-17th century right up to Mike Yatesâ 2001 collection from Duncan Williamson. Maybe the very singable refrain has helped—and the fact that we all learned it at primary school?\n\nAlmeda Riddle sang Merry Golden Tree to Alan Lomax and Shirley Collins at Greers Ferry, Arkansas, in October 1959. This recording was included in 1997 on the Rounder anthology Ozark Frontier (Southern Journey Volume 7).\n\nJean Ritchie sang The Merry Golden Tree on her 1960 Folkways album British Traditional Ballads in the Southern Mountains, Volume 1, which was reissued in 2003 on her Smithsonian Folkways album Ballads From her Appalachian Family Tradition. The song is also included with the title Lonesome Sea in her 1965 book Folk Songs of the Southern Appalachians, p. 74. Kenneth S. Goldstein noted on the Folkways album:\n\nThe earliest known text to this favourite ballad is a broadside version from the Pepysian collection dating back to the last half of the 17th century. In that version, the villain-captain is Sir Walter Raleigh, but in later texts ballad singers have deleted all references to him. There seems to be no actual historical event, concerning Walter Raleigh or any other naval figure, to which this ballad is connected.\n\nDetails of the ballad vary greatly in the many versions collected since Child. Aside from the usual havoc wreaked by oral circulation on names and places, an unusual amount of variation exists in the emotional contents of the balladâs ending. In some versions, the cabin-boy hero is amply rewarded for his ship-wrecking activity, in others he is left to drown, or is pulled aboard too late and dies on deck. Some few texts end with the cabin-boy taking his revenge by returning in ghost form and sinking the ship.\n\nJean Ritchieâs version, learned from her mother, corresponds to Coffinâs story type A, certainly the most common form for the ballad in American tradition.\n\nFrank Proffitt of Watauga County, North Carlina, sang Lowland Low to Anne and Frank Warner in 1961. This recording was included in 2000 on the Appleseed anthology of field recordings by the Warners, Her Bright Smile Haunts Me Still (The Warner Collection Volume I).\n\nPaddy Bell sang The Golden Vanity, accompanied by Martin Carthy on guitar, in 1965 on her album Paddie Herself. The albumâs liner notes commented:\n\nThe cabin boy of The Golden Vanity ranks alongside John Henry as one of the indestructible folk heroes. This is a very early ballad, known originally as Sir Walter Raleigh Sailing in the Lowlands, and, as such it was collected by Samuel Pepys. Paddie ignores the Scottish version of the song which gives the boy a happy ending.\n\nThe Halliard sang Sailing for the Lowlands Low in 1967 on their Saga album Itâs the Irish in Me.\n\nGordon McIntyre sang The Golden Vanity on the 1968 album Soldiers and Sailors (Folksingers of Australia Volume 2). He noted:\n\nIn some versions of this widely-known ballad the enemy is Turkish or French or, as in this case, Spanish, but rarely does it end happily. This one, collected by A.G. Gilchrist from W. Bolton of Lancashire, who explained the ‘black bear skin’ was the cabin boyâs covering at night and that he wished to wear it as a disguise from the enemy.\n\nRosemary Hardman sang The Golden Vanity on her 1969 Folk Heritage album Queen of Hearts, which was recorded live at the Bate Hall Hotel in Macclesfield on 29 December 1968. She noted:\n\nMany versions of this sea song are to be found throughout the country. Some record a happy ending with the cabin boy being saved, but more often as here he meets an untimely doom, in some cases returning to haunt the ship. It is interesting to note that a 17th century broadside version of this song has as its subject Sir Walter Raleigh and can be found in the Child ballad collection along with two other variants including The Sweet Trinity. Motherwell records the song as The Turkish Galley. The tune used here is probably the best known of all, but the chorus has undergone a complete change from that set down in my original source of the song (Broadwood).\n\nThe Union Folk sang The Golden Vanity in 1969 on their Traditional Sound album A Basketful of Oysters.\n\nTony Rose recorded The Golden Vanitee in 1970 for his first album, Young Hunting. He sang a slightly shorter version live at Eagle Tavern, New York, in 1981, leaving out the last but one verse. This recording was included in 2008 on his posthumous CD Exe. Tony Rose noted on the original album:\n\nThis version of the Golden Vanitee, as taken from Stan Hugillâs Shanties From the Seven Seas, is a particularly detailed one, with perhaps an unexpected element of humour here and there.\n\nMartin Simpson sang Golden Vanity in 1976 as the title track of his Trailer album, Golden Vanity.\n\nJohnny Doughty sang The Golden Vanity at home in Brighton, Sussex, in Summer 1976 to Mike Yates. This recording was published a year later on his 1977 Topic album of traditional songs from the Sussex Coast, Round Rye Bay for More, and in 1996 on the Topic celebration anthology of English traditional music, Hidden English. Mike Yates noted on the original album:\n\nSir Walter Rawleigh has built a ship in the Netherlands,\n\nSir Walter Rawleigh has built a ship in the Netherlands,\n\nAnd it is called the Sweet Trinity,\n\nAnd was taken by the false gallaly,\n\nSailing in the Lowlands.\n\nSo begins a blackletter broadside, “shewing how the famous ship called the Sweet Trinity was taken by a false Gally, and how it was again restored by the craft of a little sea-boy, who sunk the Gally,” that was printed during the period 1682-85 by Joshua Conyers, “at the Black-Raven, the 1st shop in Fetter-lane, next Holborn.”\n\nThe history books appear to have missed this particular episode in Raleighâs life—no doubt because it was a flight of Conyersâ, or some other unknown printerâs, imagination; a simple attempt to increase sales by the addition of a romantic and well-known name to an otherwise commonplace tale. Whatever the origin, the ballad certainly caught the popular imagination with the result that more than a hundred sets have been collected throughout England, Scotland, America and Australia. Johnnyâs final couplet is, to my knowledge, unique to his version.\n\nIan Manuel sang The Sweet Kumadie on his 1977 Topic album of Scots traditional songs, The Dales of Caledonia.\n\nThe Packmen sang Golden Vanity on their 1978 Fellside album The Packmenâs Blue Record.\n\nCrows sang The Lonesome Sea in 1981 on their eponymous Dinglesâ album Crows.\n\nLizzie Higgins sang The Golden Victory on a bonus track of the digital download reissue of her 1985 Lismor album What a Voice.\n\nStan Hugill and Stormalong John sang The Golden Vanitee on their 1989 album A Salty Fore Topman.\n\nCyril Tawney sang The Merry Golden Tree in 1992 on his Neptune Tapes cassette Little Boy Billee. This track was also included in 2007 on his anthology The Song Goes On.\n\nThe Gaugers sang The Sweet Kumadee in 1994 on their City of Aberdeen Libraries cassette Awa wi the Rovin Sailor. In 1999 the album was also released as a Sleepytown CD.\n\nJez Lowe (vocals, guitar) and Linda Adams (concertina) recorded The Golden Vanity in 1994 for the Fellside CD A Selection from The Penguin Book of English Folk Songs. This track was also included in 2020 on his Fellside anthology The Jez Lowe Fellside Collection.\n\nGraham Moore sang Golden Vanity on his 1995 album Tom Paineâs Bones.\n\nSteeleye Span recorded The Golden Vanity in 1995 during their Time recording sessions. However, it did not appear on this album but was later released on the two Park Records samplers The Best of British Folk Rock and A Stroll Through the Park, and in 2015 on Catch Up—The Essential Steeleye Span.\n\nMartin Carthy and John Kirkpatrick sang this song as The Old Virginia Lowlands in 1998 on Brass Monkeyâs third album Sound and Rumour. Martin Carthy noted:\n\nThe Old Virginia Lowlands is from one of Stan Hugillâs books. Itâs a version of The Golden Vanity from Stanâs family, and must be one of the few versions which is not just a historical curiosity, but a real live, feet-on-the-ground story of real betrayal of real people.\n\nSandra Kerr, Nancy Kerr and James Fagan sang Sir Walter Raleigh in 1999 on their Fellside album Scalene. They noted:\n\nA roaring version of The Golden Vanity, this ballad is from Kidsonâs Yorkshire collection, Traditional Tunes. In a broadside text owned by Samuel Pepys, which appears to be a near relative to the one we sing, the captain throws the young cabin boy overboard as his reward for sinking the enemy ship. This gross injustice used to disturb a younger James when his dear parents Bob and Marg would sing him to sleep with it, so he was pleased to learn this version in which the hero at the very least escapes and perhaps goes on to sink his own deceiving captain.\n\nBrian Peters & Gordon Tyrrall sang The Green Willow Tree in 2000 on their CD The Moving Moon. In 2008, Brian Peters sang The Golden Vanity on his CD Songs of Trial and Triumph. And in 2013 he and Jeff Davis sang The Green Willow Tree, a version collected by Cecil Sharp from Polly Patrick of Manchester, Clay Co., KY, on 24 August 1917, on their CD Sharpâs Appalachian Harvest. Brian Peters noted on his second album:\n\nThere are dozens of versions of The Golden Vanity, with predictable variations in the names of the two ships (in the North American set I recorded with Gordon Tyrrall, for instance, the Turkish Revelry is attacker and Green Willow Tree the victim of unprovoked aggression). This one was collected in 1928 by James Madison Carpenter, whose search for ballads, shanties, mummers plays and what-have-you took him the length of Britain in his jalopy. In Cardiff docks he met a seaman, Richard Warner, who sang him this version of the ballad—Iâve not tampered with it, and particularly liked the line “Oh no you foolish youngster”, which may be unique to this version. Iâm not sure what “dazzled out her lights” means, come to that.\n\nBill Whaley and Dave Fletcher sang an English version of The Golden Vanity and Martyn Wyndham-Read an Australian version on the Fellside album of English traditional songs and their Australian variants, Song Links.\n\nDuncan Williamson sang The Golden Vanity on the 2002 Kyloe album of Mike Yates recordings of songs, stories and ballads from Scottish travellers, Travellersâ Tales, Volume 2.\n\nJohn Roberts sang The Golden Vanity in 2004 at the 25th Annual Sea Music Festival at Mystic Seaport. He also sang The Weeping Willow Tree on his 2007 album Sea Fever where he noted:\n\nThe Weeping Willow Tree was given to the Vermont collector Helen Hartness Flanders by Lena Bourne ‘Grammy’ Fish of E. Jaffrey, NH. Since this version of The Golden Vanity has a twist in the tail, folklorists have suggested that Mrs. Fish rewrote the ending. I learned it from my dear friend the late Margaret MacArthur of Marlboro, VT.\n\nEmma Williamson sang The Golden Vanity in 2004 at “Folk on the Pier” which celebrated 200 years of Cromerâs lifeboats. It was issued on their CD Someone Was Calling.\n\nBob Fox sang Golden Vanity in 2006 on his Topic CD The Blast.\n\nLoudon Wainwright III sang Turkish Revelry in 2006 on Hal Willnerâs album of pirate ballads, sea songs and chanteys, Rogueâs Gallery.\n\nThe Askew Sisters sang The Old Virginia Lowlands in 2007 on their WildGoose CD All in a Garden Green. They commented in their liner notes:\n\nThis version of The Golden Vanity is originally from Stan Hugillâs great book Shanties From the Seven Seas where itâs called the Five Gallon Jar. We first heard it from the singing of Brass Monkey. It is rumoured to have been based on a ballad from the seventeenth century about the conduct of Sir Walter Raleigh, who was less popular in his time than modern legend portrays.\n\nSara Grey sang The Merry Willow Tree at the Fife Traditional Singing Festival, Collessie, Fife in May 2008. This recording was included in the following year on the festival anthology Grand to Be a Working Man (Old Songs & Bothy Ballads Volume 5). She also sang The Merry Willow Tree in 2013 on her Fellside CD Down in Old Dolores where she noted:\n\nAlso known as The Sweet Trinity, The Lowlands Low and The Golden Vanity. Recorded by John Quincy Wolf, Jr. and is in the John Quincy Wolf Folklore Collection, Lyon College, Batesville, Arkansas. This is one of my favourite versions from the singing of Almeda Riddle of Timbo, AR.\n\nA broadside of 1682-85, in which Sir Walter Raleigh plays the ungrateful captain, seems to have been the ultimate ancestor of the abundant traditional copies of this ballad found in the British Isles and America. Sir Walter has dropped out entirely; the shipâs name now appears variously as Golden Tree, Golden China Tree, Golden Willow Tree, Golden Erilee. Most traditional versions persist with the melancholy ending in which the cabin boy is cheated of his earned reward, but many American singers sentimentalise the conclusion, bestowing the captainâs daughter, wealth and other honours on the hero.\n\nBenji Kirkpatrick sang The Green Willow Tree in 2008 on Faustusâ eponymous Navigator CD, Faustus. They noted:\n\nCompiled from many versions of the story from both sides of the Atlantic, known variously as The Golden Vanity, The Sweet Trinity etc. According to a ballad printed in the 1680s, the captain in the story was no less than Sir Walter Raleigh.\n\nThis video shows Faustus at Dent Folk Festival 2009:\n\nMarilyn Tucker and Paul Wilson sang The Golden Vanity in 2008 on their WildGoose CD of traditional songs from Devon and Cornwall from the collection of Sabine Baring-Gould, Dead Maidâs Land. They noted:\n\nThe ballads offer a special opportunity for singers to develop and change the song in live performance, adding verses, modifying tunes while the kernel of the story remains. James Olverâs version [VWML SBG/3/1/307, collected in 1889 in Launceston, Cornwall] provided the departure point for this treatment of this ballad.\n\nKatherine Campbell printed George F. Duncanâs Ye Gowden Vanitie, as collected by James B. Duncan on 2 May 1908, in her 2008 book of songs from the Greig-Duncan Folk Song Collection, Songs From North-East Scotland, and sang it on the included CD.\n\nLori Watson and Rule of Three sang Golden Vanity in 2009 on her CD Pleasureâs Coin.\n\nFinest Kind sang Lowland Low on their 2010 album For Honour & for Gain. They noted:\n\nA gallant cabin boyâs betrayal by his captain provides the story for this grand old ballad, Child 286. In each version, the ship has a different name—Golden Vanity, Merry Willow Tree, Sweet Trinity—breadcrumbs for the folklorist to follow. Why the ship was fighting a “Turkish” enemy in the Lowland sea (off Holland, presumably) is anybodyâs guess. Perhaps their nationality was originally “Spanish”. Or maybe they were Barbary pirates on their way to Iceland. Or maybe—well, it doesnât matter: the true bad guy was back on the heroâs ship.\n\nShelley [Posen]Â learned his version from the great Ottawa Valley singer, Loy Gavan.\n\nTim Laycock sang The Bold Granadee on his 2010 CD of folk songs and tunes from Dorset, Sea Strands, followed by the tune Jackâs Alive. He noted:\n\nRobert and Henry Hammond collected Bold Granadee from Charles Greening of Nettlecombe, West Dorset in May 1906 [VWML HAM/3/19/12] . The song is of course the Golden Vanity, but I love the succinct and pithy lyrics of Mr Greeningâs version of the story. It seemed unfair to kill off Jack so early in the CD, so Jackâs Alive comes from the manuscript tune book of Benjamin Rose (1796-1877), farmer, alehouse keeper and musician of Belchalwell in the Blackmore Vale area of Dorset.\n\nThe Outside Track sang The Turkish Revery in 2010 on their CD Curious Things Given Wings. They noted:\n\nWe added this pirate song to “arrrh” repertoire after Norah [Rendell] learned it from guitarist and singer, DÃ¡ithÃ­ Sproule, who found it in his motherâs Burl Ives LP.\n\nAlasdair Roberts recorded The Golden Vanity, from the singing of Duncan Williamson, for his 2010 CD Too Long in This Condition. This video shows him in 2017 at the Kinning Park Complex in Glasgow, Scotland, accompanied by Stevie Jones on bass:\n\nSarah Morgan sang The Golden Willow Tree accompanied by Jeff Gillett, live in front of an invited audience at The White Lion, Wherwell, Hampshire, in February 2012. The concertâs recording was released in the same year on their Forest Track album The Flowers and the Wine. Some years later, in 2018, Jeff Gillett sang The Golden Willow Tree on Mischief Afootâs eponymous WildGoose album Mischief Afoot. He noted:\n\nAn American version of The Golden Vanity which I learned during the all-too brief time that I was working with Sarah Morgan. I describe it, as she did, as a delightful little song about Turk-bashing: but itâs all right, because the Turks in question were obviously all evil people, given to sinful occupations like playing cards. Doug Bailey suggests that the name of the Turkish ship (somewhat improbably, the ReveillÃ©) might be a corruption of ‘razee’, which is a two deck ship cut down to make a very powerful one deck ship, very popular with the Turkish navy and pirate vessels.\n\nSam Kelly sang The Golden Vanity in 2015 on his CD The Lost Boys.\n\nThe Macmath Collective sang The Golden Vanitee on their 2015 CD Macmath: The Silent Page.\n\nAndy Turner learned The Golden Vanity from Everymanâs Book of British Ballads, edited by Roy Palmer. He sang Johnny Doughtyâs version of this song as the 25 July 2015 entry of his project A Folk Song a Week.\n\nLankum sang The Turkish Reveille on their 2017 CD Between the Earth and Sky.\n\nMatt Quinn learned The Golden Vanity from the singing of Johnny Doughty and recorded it for his 2017 CD The Brighton Line. He commented:\n\nMike Yates recorded this song in 1976 in Johnnyâs home. Versions of this song appear all over the world, sometimes called The Old Virginia Lowlands or The Sweet Trinity.\n\nCotwolds folk trio, Mischief Afoot sang The Golden Willow Tree in 2018 on their eponymous WildGoose CD Mischief Afoot. Jeff Gillett noted:\n\nAn American version of The Golden Vanity which I learned during the all-too brief time that I was working with Sarah Morgan. I describe it, as she did, as a delightful little song about Turk-bashing: but itâs all right, because the Turks in question were obviously all evil people, given to sinful occupations like playing cards. Doug Bailey suggests that the name of the Turkish ship (somewhat improbably, the Reveille) might be a corruption of ‘razee’, which is a two deck ship cut down to make a very powerful one deck ship, very popular with the Turkish navy and for pirate vessels.\n\nIona Fyfe sang The Golden Vanity on her 2019 EP Dark Turn of Mind. She noted:\n\nThe Golden Vanity is an oikotypical ballad which has been collected in Aberdeenshire, the Scottish Borders, England, Ireland, Canada and the Appalachians. The ballad dates back to 1685 when it was published in the Pepysian Collection at Magdalene College, Cambridge under the title The Ballad of Sir Walter Rauleigh His Lamentation or Sir Walter Raleigh Sailing In The Lowlands (1635). In later texts, no reference to Sir Walter Raleigh can be found. Tristram Potter Coffin states: “In America, Sir Walter Raleigh is no longer connected with the song, the ships have Golden Vanity and Turkish Revelee names which names which may vary with historical circumstances, and a more positive ending.”\n\nThe captain declares the ship is in peril and has come under threat by another vessel, usually French, Turkish or Spanish. The shipâs cabin boy offers to sink the foreign vessel, in return for rewards such as gold and the Captainâs daughterâs hand in marriage. The cabin boy successfully swims and sinks the enemy by boring holes in the ships side, then returns to The Golden Vanity. In some variants, the boy is rewarded and in others he is shot and drowned or taken aboard the ship too late and dies on deck. In select texts, he drowns and returns as a ghost to exact revenge and sinks the ship.\n\nThe Golden Vanity, otherwise known as The Sweet Trinity or Golden Willow Tree, features in Volume 5 [of] Francis James Childâs The English and Scottish Popular Ballads. The ballad has long been procured in the North East of Scotland and features in Volume 1 of the celebrated Greig-Duncan Folk Song Collection. Reverend James Duncan and Gavin Greig collected Ye Gouden Vanitie from a manuscript written and sent by George F. Duncan on 2 May 1908 and is comprised of verses with an “eek-eedle-ee and the Lowlands low” refrain. George states: “I have a notion I have heard mother sing it. It is not entirely the same as any printed copy I have seen. I should have said that the music had come through Christieâs hands.” Version C is titled The Lowlands So Low and was collected from John Calder. “Bell Robertson traces the ballad back through her mother to the early years of the last century.” Versions found in the Greig-Duncan are all in the Doric vernacular. William Christie states in Volume 1 of his Traditional Ballad Airs that the air “was noted from the singing of a native in Buchan. It was long well known and may still be known to some in the three northern Counties of Scotland.”\n\nThe ballad is found in the Missouri State Max Hunter Folksong Collection Archive. The ballad features in John Ordâs Bothy Songs and Ballads as well as Gavin Greigâs Folk-Song of the North-East—which reinforce the notion that the ballad was ever-present in the ballad heartland of Aberdeenshire as well as in several countries. Several versions of the ballad feature on Tobar an Dualchais—Kist of Riches online archive from contributors such as John Strachan (SA1952.026), Willie Mathieson (SA1952.008) and Lizzie Higgins (SA1970.022) and Jeannie Roberton (SA1957.44) The ballad was collected by Alan Bruford in Fetlar, Shetland in 1970 from Catherine Mary Anderson (SA1970.245).\n\nLowlands Low was printed as a broadside for the Poetâs Box in Glasgow in 1877, with an earlier Bodleian Broadside printed in London between 1849 and 1862. It also features in Fordâs Vagabond Songs and Ballads of Scotland. Duncan Williamson recorded The Golden Vanity on Travellersâ Tales, Volume 2, Songs, Stories and Ballads From Scottish Travellers in 2002. Ewan MacColl recorded The Sweet Kumadee on his 1964 Folkways release The English and Scottish Popular Ballads Volume 2.\n\nJean Ritchie recorded the ballad on her 1961 Folkways album, British Traditional Ballads in the Southern Mountains, Volume 1. Jeanâs version, which she learned the from her mother, corresponds with Story Type A found in Tristram Potter Coffinâs The British Traditional Ballad in North America. The refrain “As she sailed upon the low, and lonesome low, She sailed upon the lonesome sea” seems to be typical of variants of the ballads recorded and collected in the Ozarks and Appalachian mountains and references The Merry Golden Tree, Weeping Willow Tree, or Green Willow Tree as the ship.\n\nThe version featured on my Dark Turn of Mind EP is an amalgamation of verses from the text featured as Version A in Cecil Sharpâs English Folk Songs From the Southern Appalachians and from Version B of Childâs Popular Ballads. Coffin states: “The Sweet Trinity in this country (America) does not really follow any of the Child versions textually, although there is on the whole a closer resemblance to Child B and C than to Child A.” The Golden Vanity is one of many classical ballads which ably showcases the global universalism of ballads.\n\nThis video shows Jodie Beaton singing The Gouden Vanity at A Puckle Muckle

North country,\n\nAnd the name of the ship was The Sweet Kumadee.\n\nShe was built oâ the pine and the bay oak tree,\n\nAnd she sailed on the lowlands, lowlands,\n\nAnd she sailed on the lowlands low.\n\nWe hadna been sailing a league but barely three,\n\nWhen the lookout man he sighted a French gaudie,\n\nAnd he said: “Weâll aâ be sent to the bottom oâ the sea\n\nAs we sail on the lowlands low.”\n\nThen oot and spakâ our cabin-boy and oot spakâ he,\n\nSaying: “Captain, o captain, what will ye giâe to me,\n\nIf I swim along the side oâ the French gaudie,\n\nAnd sink her in the lowlands, lowlands,\n\nAnd sink her in the lowlands, low?”\n\n“Itâs I will giâe ye gold and I will giâe ye fee,\n\nAnd my eldest dochter, your bride for to be,\n\nIf yeâll swim along the side oâ the French gaudie,\n\nAnd sink her in the lowlands, lowlands,\n\nAnd sink her in the lowlands low.”\n\n“Yeâll row me into an auld bullâs skin,\n\nYeâll takâ me to the side and there yeâll throw me in,\n\nWiâ my instruments about me to the gaudie, I will swim,\n\nAnd Iâll sink her in the lowlands, lowlands,\n\nIâll sink her in the lowlands low.”\n\nThe boy bent his back and away swam he,\n\nHe swam till he camâ to the French gaudie.\n\nWiâ his instruments about him, he started to makâ free,\n\nTo sink her in the lowlands, lowlands,\n\nTo sink her in the lowlands low.\n\nSome were at the cairds and some were at the dice,\n\nFour and twenty holes he has pierced in her side,\n\nUntil the salt water it flashed before their eyes,\n\nAnd they sank in the lowlands, lowlands,\n\nThey sank in the lowlands low.\n\n“O captain, o captain, be as good as your word,\n\nYouâll throw me a rope and yeâll puâ me on board;\n\nThe gaudie she lies at the bottom of the road,\n\nSheâs lying in the lowlands, lowlands,\n\nSheâs lying in the lowlands low.”\n\n“I winna throw a rope or puâ ye on board,\n\nYe can swim till ye sink, just as true as my word,\n\nYe can swim till ye sink to the bottom of the road,\n\nYe can sink in the lowlands, lowlands,\n\nYe can sink in the lowlands low.”\n\n“Yeâll throw me a rope and yeâll puâ me frae the sea,\n\nOr Iâll swim to the side oâ your Sweet Kumadee,\n\nAnd Iâll send her to the bottom like the French gaudie,\n\nThatâs lying on the lowlands, lowlands,\n\nSheâs lying on the lowlands low.”\n\nHeâs thrown to him a rope and theyâve puâd him frae the sea,\n\nAnd heâs giâen to him the gowd and heâs giâen to him the fee;\n\nAnd his eldest dochter his bride for to be,\n\nAs they sailed on the lowlands, lowlands,\n\nAs they sailed on the lowlands, low.\n\nSam Larner sings The Golden Fenidier\n\nThere once sailed a ship from the North âMerikee,\n\nThe name she went by was The Golden Fenidier,\n\nShe was then overtaken by a Turkish pirate ship,\n\nAnd he sank her in the lowlands, lowlands, lowlands,\n\nAnd he sank her in the lowlands low.\n\nNow the first one on deck was the little cabin boy,\n\nSaying, “Captain, whatâll you give me if the ship I do destroy?”\n\n“I will give to you my silver and my daughter for your bride,\n\nIf you sink her in the lowlands, lowlands, lowlands,”\n\nAnd he sank her in the lowlands low.\n\nHe then jumped overboard with an auger in his hand,\n\nHe swam right around that Turkish pirate ship,\n\nAnd he bore a hole through and he let the water in,\n\nAnd he sank her in the lowlands, lowlands, lowlands\n\nAnd he sank her in the lowlands low.\n\nHe then swam back to his own Fenidier,\n\nSaying, “Captain, pick me up, I am drifting in despair.”\n\nSaying, “Captain, pick me up, I am drifting in despair.\n\nI am drifting in the lowlands, lowlands, lowlands\n\nI am drifting in the lowlands low.”\n\nHe then swam round the starboard part the ship,\n\nSaying, “Shipmates, pick me up, I am sinking in despair.”\n\nSaying, “Shipmates, pick me up, I am sinking in despair.\n\nI am sinking in the low…”\n\nSpoken: Thatâs how that go.\n\nLook how that go.\n\nThey pulled him oâer the side and they laid him on the deck there,\n\nAnd he gasped, and he died in despair.\n\nAnd they wrapped him in a hammock that was just about his size,\n\nAnd they laid him in the lowlands, lowlands, lowlands\n\nAnd they lowered him in the lowlands low.\n\nSpoken: Now look about there, look.\n\nTony Rose sings The Golden Vanitee\n\nAnd there once was a captain who was boasting on the quay:\n\n“Oh I have a ship and a gallant ship is she.\n\nOf all the ships I know she is the best for me\n\nAnd sheâs sailing in the lowlands low.”\n\nChorus (after each verse, repeating its last line):\n\nIn the lowlands, lowlands,\n\nSheâs sailing in the lowlands low\n\n“Well I had her built in the North Country\n\nAnd I had her christened the Golden Vanitee.\n\nI armed her and I manned her and I sent her off to sea\n\nAnd sheâs sailing in the lowlands low.”\n\nOh well then up stepped a sailor who has just returned from sea:\n\n“Oh I was aboard of the Golden Vanitee\n\nWhen we was held in chase by a Spanish piratee\n\nAnd we sank âem in the lowlands low.”\n\nOh well, we had aboard us a little cabin boy\n\nWho said, “What will you give me if the galley I destroy?”\n\n“Iâll give to you my daughter, she is my pride and joy,\n\nIf you sink them in the lowlands low.”\n\nSo the boy bared his breast and he plunged into the tide.\n\nHe swam until he came to the rascal pirateâs side;\n\nHe climbed on board, he went below, by none was he espied,\n\nAnd he sank âem in the lowlands low.”\n\nOh well he bore her with his auger, he bore her once or twice,\n\nAnd some was playing cards and some was playing dice.\n\nBut when he let the water in, it dazzled at their eyes\n\nAnd he sank âem in the lowlands low.”\n\nOh yes, some was playing cards and some was playing dice,\n\nAnd some was in their hammocks a-sportinâ with their wives.\n\nBut when he let the water in, it pulled out all their lives,\n\nAnd he sank them in the lowlands low.\n\nSo then the cabin boy he swam unto the larboard side\n\nSaying, “Captain, take me up for I am drowning in the tide.”\n\n“Iâll shoot you and Iâll kill you if you claim my child as bride,\n\nAnd Iâll sink you in the lowlands low.”\n\nSo then the cabin boy he swam unto the starboard side\n\nSaying, “Messmates, take me up for I am drifting with the tide.”\n\nThey took him up so quickly but when on deck, he died,\n\nAnd they buried him in the lowlands low.\n\nOh yes, they took him up so quickly but when on deck, he died,\n\nAnd they sewed him in his hammock that was so strong and wide.\n\nThey said a short prayer over him and dropped him in the tide\n\nAnd they sailed from the lowlands low.\n\nWell hereâs a curse onto the Captain wherever he may be\n\nFor taking that poor cabin boy so far away to sea;\n\nFor taking that poor cabin boy so far away to sea\n\nAnd to leave him in the lowlands low.\n\nJohnny Doughty sings The Golden Vanity\n\nA fair ship is mine called the Golden Vanity\n\nAnd she sails just now by the north country.\n\nBut I fear that sheâll be taken by a Spanish gallalee\n\nAs we sailed by the lowlands low.\n\nChorus (after each verse, repeating its last line):\n\nBy the lowlands low,\n\nAs we sailed by the lowlands low.\n\n“What will you give to me?” asked the little cabin boy,\n\n“If I venture to that Spanish ship, the ship that doth annoy?\n\nI will wreck the gallalee, you may peace of mind enjoy\n\nAs we sail by the lowlands low.”\n\nThe Captain said, “Now with you my lad Iâll share\n\nAll my treasure and my wealth, you shall have my daughter fair,\n\nIf this Spanish ship you nobly sink and ease me of my care\n\nAs we sail by the lowlands low.”\n\nThen boldly the lad did he leap into the sea\n\nAnd an auger very sharp and thin he carried carefully.\n\nAnd he swam the mighty billows âtil he reached the gallalee\n\nWhere she sank by the lowlands low.\n\nThen back to the ship the little hero hied\n\nAnd he begged the crew to haul him up upon the larboard side.\n\n“You can sink for me, you little dog!” the ungrateful Captain cried\n\nAs we sail by the lowlands low.\n\nWas there ever half a tale so sad\n\nAs this tale of the sea\n\nWhere we sailed by the lowlands low?\n\nJez Lowe sings The Golden Vanity\n\nItâs Iâve got a ship in the north country,\n\nDown in the Lowlands low,\n\nAnd I fear she may be took by the Spanish enemy,\n\nAs she sails in the Lowland sea,\n\nAs she sails in the Lowland low.\n\nAnd up then stepped a little cabin boy,\n\nDown in the Lowlands low,\n\nSaying: “What will you give me if I do them destroy\n\nAnd sink them in the Lowland sea\n\nAnd sink them in the Lowlands low?”\n\n“Oh, Iâll give you silver and likewise gold,\n\nDown in the Lowlands low,\n\nAnd my only daughter for to be your bride,\n\nIf youâll sink them in the Lowland sea,\n\nIf youâll sink them in the Lowlands low.”\n\n“Oh wrap me up in my black bear skin,\n\nDown in the Lowlands low,\n\nAnd heave me overboard for to sink or to swim,\n\nAnd Iâll sink them in the Lowland sea\n\nIâll sink them in the Lowlands low.”\n\nNow some were playing cards and others playing dice,\n\nDown in the Lowlands low,\n\nAnd the boy he had an auger, bored two holes at once,\n\nAnd he sunk them in the Lowland sea,\n\nAnd he sunk them in the Lowlands low.”\n\nHe leaned upon his breast and he swam back again,\n\nDown in the Lowlands low,\n\nSaying “Master, take me up, for Iâm sure I will be slain,\n\nAnd Iâve sunk them in the Lowland sea,\n\nAnd Iâve sunk them in the Lowlands low.”\n\n“Oh, Iâll not take you up,” the master he cried,\n\nDown in the Lowlands low,\n\n“But Iâll shoot you and Iâll kill you and send you with the tide,\n\nAnd Iâll drown you in the Lowland sea,\n\nAnd Iâll drown you in the Lowlands low.”\n\nHe leaned upon his breast and swam round the larboard side,\n\nDown in the Lowlands low,\n\n“Oh messmates, take me up for I fear I will been slain,\n\nAnd Iâve sunk her in the Lowland sea,\n\nAnd Iâve sunk her in the Lowlands low.”\n\nHis messmates took him up, and on the deck he died,\n\nDown in the Lowlands low,\n\nAnd they wrapped him up in an old cowâs hide,\n\nAnd they sunk him in the Lowland sea,\n\nAnd sunk him in the Lowlands low.\n\nSteeleye Span sing The Golden Vanity\n\nI know a ship in the north country\n\nDown in the Lowlands low,\n\nAnd I fear she may be took by the Spanish enemy,\n\nDown in the Lowland sea\n\nUp on the deck stepped a little cabin boy,\n\nDown in the Lowlands low,\n\nSaying: “What will you give me if I do them destroy\n\nAnd sink them in the Lowland sea?”\n\n“Oh, Iâll give you silver and I will give you gold,\n\nDown in the Lowlands low,\n\nAnd my only daughter for to be your bride,\n\nIf you sink them in the Lowland sea,\n\nSink them in the Lowlands low.”\n\nChorus:\n\nLowlands low,\n\nLowland sea\n\n“Oh wrap me up in my black bear skin,\n\nDown in the Lowlands low,\n\nAnd throw me overboard for to sink or to swim,\n\nDown in the Lowland sea.”\n\nNow some were playing cards and others playing dice,\n\nDown in the Lowlands low,\n\nAnd the boy he had an auger and he bored two holes at once,\n\nAnd he sunk them in the Lowland sea.\n\nHe leaned upon his breast and he swam back again,\n\nDown in the Lowlands low,\n\nSaying “Master, take me up, for I fear I will be slain,\n\nAnd I sunk them in the Lowlands low,\n\nI sunk them in the Lowland sea.”\n\nChorus\n\n“Oh, Iâll not take you up,” the master he cried,\n\nDown in the Lowlands low,\n\n“But Iâll shoot you and Iâll kill you and Iâll send you with the tide,\n\nAnd Iâll drown you in the Lowland sea”\n\nHe leaned upon his breast and he swam to the larboard side,\n\nDown

Virginia Lowlands\n\nOnce there was a skipper, he was boasting on the quay,\n\nSaying: “I have a ship, and a gallant ship is she,\n\nOh I have a ship, and a gallant ship is she.\n\nOf all the ships

sailing ship was fashioned to sail the southern seas\n\nDown in the Lowlands low,\n\nShe was handsome, she was tall, and as trim as trim could be\n\nThe name of the ship was the Weeping Willow Tree\n\nThis ship built in the Lowlands, Lowlands low,\n\nBorn to ride the waves, hi, ho.\n\nHer crew were hearty seamen, as brave as brave could be\n\nLads from the Lowlands low,\n\nHer decks were broad and wide, and as white as white could be\n\nAnd on her sail was printed a weeping willow tree\n\nIn this ship built in the Lowlands, Lowlands low,\n\nBorn to ride the waves, hi, ho.\n\nThis worthy ship was chosen to sail the Spanish Main\n\nFar from the Lowlands low,\n\nOur captain he was shrewd, he was also proud and vain\n\nAnd he hoped by his shrewd dealings a fortune for to gain\n\nIn this ship built in the Lowlands, Lowlands low,\n\nBorn to ride the waves, hi, ho.\n\nAs our ship was sailing all on the southern seas\n\nFar from the Lowlands low,\n\nWe met a Spanish ship called the Royal Castilee\n\nAnd they jeered at the crew of the Weeping Willow Tree\n\nThis ship built in the Lowlands, Lowlands low,\n\nBorn to ride the waves, hi, ho.\n\nThe captain called his cabin boy, as he had done before,\n\nA lad from the Lowlands low,\n\nHe said, Boy, you can swim, and your stroke is swift and sure\n\nThat sassy Spanish ship, sheâll never reach the shore\n\nYouâll sink her in the ocean low, low, low,\n\nYouâll sink her in the ocean low.\n\nIn your hand youâll take an augur, and swim to her side\n\nFor weâre from the Lowlands low,\n\nAnd there youâll bore a hole, and youâll bore it deep and wide\n\nFor five hundred pounds in gold and to be first mate besides\n\nYouâll sink her in the ocean low, low, low,\n\nYouâll sink her in the ocean low.\n\nSo that was the end of the Royal Castilee\n\nShe sank in the ocean low,\n\nHer lofty sails so high and her haughty air so free\n\nThey were buried in the depths of the raging southern sea\n\nWe sunk her in the ocean low, low, low,\n\nWe sunk her in the ocean low.\n\nThe cabin boy exclaimed, Sir, I now demand my fee\n\nYou knave from the Lowlands low,\n\nFive hundred pounds in gold you now must give to me\n\nAnd I also am first mate of the Weeping Willow Tree\n\nThis ship built in the Lowlands, Lowlands low,\n\nBorn to ride the waves, hi, ho.\n\nYouâll get no gold from me, boy, for causing this wreck\n\nYou thief from the Lowlands low,\n\nAnd he took the cabin boy by the nap of the neck\n\nAnd he threw him overboard from the Weeping Willowâs deck\n\nHe threw him in the ocean low, low, low,\n\nHe threw him in the ocean low.\n\nAh, but he still carried the augur as he had done before\n\nThe lad from the Lowlands low,\n\nHis heart was full of vengeance and his stroke was swift and sure\n\nInstead of boring one hole, he bored twenty-four\n\nIn that ship built in the Lowlands, Lowlands low,\n\nBorn to ride the waves, hi, ho.\n\nThis ship was two hundred leagues from the shore\n\nFar from the Lowlands low,\n\nThe captain and his crew they never reached the shore\n\nAnd the wilds seemed to say, Fare thee well for evermore\n\nTo that ship built in the Lowlands, Lowlands low,\n\nBorn to ride the waves, hi, ho.\n\nBut one brave hearty seaman escaped the raging sea\n\nâTwas the lad from the Lowlands low,\n\nHe was picked up by a ship, so it has been told to me\n\nAnd he told to us the tale of the Weeping Willow Tree\n\nThat ship built in the Lowlands, Lowlands low,\n\nBorn to ride the waves, hi, ho.\n\nSandra Kerr, Nancy Kerr and James Fagan sing Sir Walter Raleigh\n\nSir Walter Raleigh has built a ship\n\nIn the Netherlands\n\nAnd it is called the Sweet Trinity\n\nAnd was taken by the false galilee\n\nSailing in the Lowlands low\n\n“Oh is there never a seaman bold\n\nWho will go and take the false galilee\n\nAnd so redeem the Sweet Trinity.”\n\nThen up and spoke the little shipâs boy,\n\n“Oh master, master what will you give me?\n\nAnd I will take the false galilee.”\n\n“Well, Iâll give you gold and Iâll give you fee,\n\nIâll give you gold and Iâll give you fee\n\nAnd my eldest daughter your wife she shall be.”\n\nWell, he set his breast and away he did swim,\n\nHe set his breast and away he did swim\n\nUntil he came to the false galilee.\n\nWell, some were at cards and some were at dice,\n\nWell, some were at cards and some were at dice\n\nUntil the salt water flashed in their eyes.\n\nWell, he set his breast and away he did swim,\n\nHe set his breast and away he did swim\n\nUntil he came to his own ship again.\n\n“Well, you promised me gold and you promised me fee,\n\nYou promised me gold and you promised me fee\n\nAnd your eldest daughter my wife she must be.”\n\n“Well, I promised you gold and I promised you fee,\n\nI promised you gold and I promised you fee\n\nBut my eldest daughter your wife shall never be.”\n\n“Oh, fare you well you deceiving lord,\n\nOh, fare you well you deceiving lord\n\nSince you have not been true to your word.”\n\nBrian Peters sings The Golden Vanity\n\nNow there was a bonny ship in the North country,\n\nThe name that she went under was the Golden Vanity.\n\nI fear she will be taken by the Turkish privateer\n\nAs she sails along the lowlands low,\n\nAs she sails along the lowlands low.\n\nChorus (after each verse):\n\nIn the lowlands, in the lowlands,\n\nAs she sails along the lowlands low\n\nNow the first that come on deck was the little cabin boy,\n\n“Captain, whatâll you give to me if I do them destroy?”\n\n“Iâll give you gold and silver, my daughter for your bride\n\nIf youâll sink them in the Lowlands low,\n\nIf youâll sink them in the Lowlands low.”\n\nSo the captain held the keel light, and overboard he goes,\n\nHe swam âtil he came to the Turkish privateer.\n\nHeâs let the water in and heâs dazzled out her lights\n\nAnd he sank her in the lowands low,\n\nAnd he sank her in the lowands low.\n\nSo itâs back to the ship so quickly he swam,\n\n“Captain, captain, pick me up my work Iâve bravely done.\n\nCaptain, pick me up, for Iâm sinking in the sea,\n\nIâm sinking in the lowlands low,\n\nAnd Iâm sinking in the lowlands low.”\n\n“Pick you up, pick you up?” The captain said he,\n\n“Oh no, you foolish youngster, that will never be.\n\nFor Iâm going to send you after the Turkish Ivory\n\nAnd Iâll sink you in the lowlands low,\n\nAnd Iâll sink you in the lowlands low.”\n\nSo he swam around the ship all to the starboard side,\n\n“Shipmates, shipmate, pick me up, Iâm sinking in the tide,\n\nShipmates, pick me up, for Iâm sinking in the sea,\n\nIâm sinking in the lowlands low,\n\nAnd Iâm sinking in the lowlands low.\n\nSo his shipmates picked him up, and on the deck he died,\n\nThey sewed him in his hammock, which was both long and wide.\n\nThey sewed him in his hammock and they threw him oâer the side\n\nAnd they sank him in the lowlands low,\n\nAnd they sank him in the lowlands low.\n\nFaustus sing The Green Willow Tree\n\nThere was a ship that sailed on the north country,\n\nShe went by the name of the Green Willow Tree.\n\nIâm afraid sheâll be taken by the enemy\n\nAs she sails on the lowlands low.\n\nShe hadnât sailed far out upon the lowlands sea\n\nWhen the lookout cried, “Here comes the enemy!”\n\nAnd the name of the ship was the Golden Silveree,\n\nAnd they sailed on the lowlands low.\n\nThen up to the captain steps the cabin boy.\n\n“What will you give me if her I could destroy?”\n\n“You can have my only daughter for your wedded joy\n\nIf you sink her in the lowlands low.”\n\nHe says to the captain, “An auger give to me,\n\nAnd for your daughterâs hand I will sink the enemy.”\n\nThen he swam through the billows to the Golden Silveree\n\nFor to sink her in the lowlands low,\n\nSink her in the lowlands low.\n\nHe pulled out the auger, then he swam down to bore.\n\nHe made nine holes in the bottom of the floor.\n\nThe crew hadnât a notion of what they had in store,\n\nBut they sailed on the lowlands low.\n\nWell some were playing cards and some were playing dice,\n\nSome were stood around and giving good advice\n\nWhen in came the juice and it rose up past their eyes,\n\nAnd they sank into the lowlands low,\n\nAnd they sank into the lowlands low.\n\n“Oh captain, oh captain, take me back on board.\n\nIâve done as I vowed, now I claim my reward.\n\nBe unto me just as good as your word,\n\nFor Iâve sunk her in the lowlands low.”\n\nWell up speaks the captain, “My word I will not keep.\n\nFor though you are brave your life to me is cheap.\n\nYou cannot have my daughter—instead forever sleep:\n\nFor Iâll sink you in the lowlands low,\n\nIâll sink you in the lowlands low.”\n\nThey gagged him, they bound him, they took him to the side,\n\nAnd then they wrapped him up in an old cowâs hide,\n\nThey threw him overboard to go down with the tide.\n\nAnd they sank him in the lowlands low,\n\nAnd they sank him in the lowlands low,\n\nLowlands low, lowlands low, lowlands low.\n\nIona Fyfe sings The Golden Vanity\n\nThere was a gallant ship, and a gallant ship was she\n\nAnd the name of the ship was the Golden Vanity\n\nSailinâ on the low, the lowlands low\n\nShe sailed upon the lowlands low\n\nShe hadnât sailed a league, a league but only three,\n\nWhen she was overtaken by a Spanish gallee\n\nSailinâ on the low, the lowlands low\n\nShe sailed upon the lowlands low\n\nUp spoke the captain, and up spoke he\n\nOh whoâll sink for me that Spanish gallee\n\nSailinâ on the low, the lowlands low\n\nShe sailed upon the lowlands low\n\nUp and spoke, a little cabin boy\n\nSayinâ what will you give me, if I will them destroy\n\nIâll sink her in the low, the lowlands low\n\nIâll sink her in the lowlands low\n\nI will give you gold, and Iâll give you a fee\n\nI will give to you my daughter aye and married you shall be\n\nSailinâ on the low, the lowlands low\n\nShe sailed upon the lowlands low\n\nHe bent to his breast and away swum he,\n\nHe swum and sunk the ship of the Spanish gallee\n\nSome were playing cards and some were playing dice\n\nAnd the boy he had an auger and he bore three holes at twice\n\nSailinâ on the low, the lowlands low\n\nShe sailed upon the lowlands low\n\nHe bent to his breast, and back swum he\n\nRight back to the ship of the Golden Vanity\n\nNow throw me up a rope, and take me on my board\n\nFor I have been aye true, aye an true unto my word\n\nI sunk her in the low, the lowlands low\n\nI sunk her in the lowlands low\n\nIâll not take you up, the captain he replied,\n\nBut Iâll shoot you, and Iâll drown you and Iâll send you with the tide\n\nSailinâ on the low, the lowlands low\n\nShe sailed upon the lowlands low\n\nHe turned upon his back, and down went he,\n\nDown, down, down to the bottom of the sea\n\nSailinâ on the low, the lowlands low\n\nShe sailed upon the lowlands low\n\nSailinâ on the low, the lowlands low\n\nShe sailed upon the lowlands low\n\nJodie Beaton sings The Gouden Vanity\n\nThere wis a gallant ship and a gallant ship wis she\n\nEek-eedle-ee and the Lowlands low\n\nAnd she was caed the Gouden Vanity\n\nAs we sailed in the Lowlands Low\n\nShe hadna sailed a league, a league but only three\n\nFan she fell in wi a French gallee\n\nThen up spak the captain and up spak he\n\nOh faâll sink for me yon French gallee\n\nThen up spak the cabin boy and up spak he\n\nFit will ye gie tae me gin I sink the French gallee\n\nThen up spak the captain and up spak he\n\nIâll gie ye lands and hooses in the North countrie\n\nThen roll me up in a black bullâs skin\n\nAnd throw me ower-board so I can sink or swim\n\nThen a-doon and a-doon and a-doon sank he\n\nAnd he swam up tae the French gallee\n\nNow some were playing cairds and some were playing dice\n\nFan he wis borin holes in the galleeâs side\n\nThen aroon and aroon and aroon went she\n\nAnd she went doon tae the bottom o the sea\n\nThrow me a rope and haul me up on board\n\nAnd prove untae me as good as your word"
