        "text": "After announcing the first leg of the summer “Celebration Tour”, legendary rock musician John Fogerty is adding even more dates to the summer run, including a stop at Pine Knob Music Theatre on Sunday, August 4 at 6:50 p.m. Joining in the party as special guests are fellow ‘bad to the bone’ music icons, George Thorogood & The Destroyers and rock band, Hearty Har. Pine Knob Music Theatre is presented by Proud Partners United Wholesale Mortgage, Trinity Health and Ally.\n\nThis highly anticipated tour marks a significant milestone as it's the first time Fogerty is performing his songs since acquiring ownership of his extensive song catalog. Kicking off on June 2 in South Carolina, this exhilarating journey will weave it across the whole country before winding up on September 11 at the Utah State Fair in Salt Lake City.\n\nOf touring for the first time with good friend Thorogood, Fogerty said, “George and I have done shows together before but for years we’ve talked about doing a full tour together. This summer we decided time is short, we better do this now!”\n\nWith George Thorogood echoing, “Celebrating the music of John Fogerty at the same time we celebrate our 50th Anniversary is just about as good as it can get. I’m looking forward to being out there with my friend, John!\"\n\nAs founder of Creedence Clearwater Revival, Fogerty’s career spans 50 years and he is hailed as one of the most influential musicians in rock history. As the writer, singer and producer of numerous classic hits including “Born on the Bayou,” “Green River,” “Proud Mary,” and “Bad Moon Rising,” Fogerty has been honored as one of the 100 Greatest Guitarists, 100 Greatest Songwriters, and 100 Greatest Singers by Rolling Stone. Earning induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Baseball Hall of Fame, he is also a New York Times best-selling author for his memoir, Fortunate Son: My Life, My Music. In January 2023 he regained control over his works, acquiring majority interest of his worldwide publishing rights from Concord. Currently on a worldwide “Celebration Tour,” Fogerty is now performing his classic songs, with his two sons, for the first time since owning his catalog of songs which have resonated with fans for over five decades.\n\nOn the evening of December 1, 1973 at The University of Delaware’s Lane Hall, a guitarist, a drummer, and their rhythm guitarist set up on the small bandstand. Though the three-piece band had barely rehearsed, guitarist George Thorogood and drummer Jeff Simon had been bashing out covers of songs they loved – including “No Particular Place To Go,” “Madison Blues” and “One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer” – in suburban Wilmington basements since they were teens. The Lane Hall audience was wary at first. “Then it was like somebody flipped a switch,” Simon recalls. “Everybody hit the dance floor all at once.” Thorogood adds, “We had the place rockin’, from that very first show, Jeff and I knew we were onto something.” Five decades, 15 million albums and more than 8,000 performances later, few bands can still rock the house like George Thorogood & Destroyers. And for Thorogood, Simon, and long-time Destroyers Bill Blough, Jim Suhler and Buddy Leach, their Bad All Over The World – 50 Years of Rock Tour will be a celebration like no other.\n\nLed by brothers Shane Fogerty (guitar/vocals) and Tyler Fogerty (guitar/vocals), the Los Angeles rock band Hearty Har formed in 2012 and quickly became known for their exciting and raucous live shows. Backed by Jesse Wilson (bass), Richard Millsap (drums), Nick Stratton (guitar) and Douglas Lamothe (keys), the band blends modern psychedelia with classic garage rock and roll. Imagine a neon lightning bolt extending from the stage and reaching deep into your heart, down to your feet, then through the ground to the Earth's core. Now you have an idea of Hearty Har's live show.\n\n“We are incredibly excited to join John Fogerty and George Thorogood on tour! Hearty Har will open up every show with our own blend of rock and roll, and then join John as his backing band,” explains the band. “Get ready to rock out with us all summer!”\n\nThe Celebration Tour Dates HERE\n\nConnect with John Fogerty\n\nTwitter | Facebook | Instagram\n\nConnect with George Thorogood\n\nTwitter | Facebook | Instagram"
