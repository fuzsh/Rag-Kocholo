The Pirate (French: La Pirate) is a 1984 French drama film directed by Jacques Doillon. It was entered in the 1984 Cannes Film Festival.

Alma (Jane Birkin) and her husband (Andrew Birkin, Jane Birkin’s real life brother) return home one evening to be confronted by Carole (Maruschka Detmers), Alma’s one time lover. Carole abducts Alma and takes her to a hotel where they are joined by an unnamed friend of Carole, an eccentric man claiming to be a private detective and eventually by Alma’s husband. The five protagonists must face off to resolve their problems.

La Pirate, Jacques Doillon’s complex and controversial emotional drama, was ill-received by critics on it’s release but it retains a raw power that keeps it relevant today. The film does little to spare audience sensibilities dropping them in the middle of of a story that seems to have been ongoing for a period of time and confronting them with some harrowing performances.
