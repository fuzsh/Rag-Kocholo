In the ensuing emotional torrent, Alma allows herself to be abducted by Carole and taken to a hotel, pursued by a young girl - an unnamed friend of Carole - and an eccentric bystander posing as a private detective. Before Alma and Carole can resolve their situation, Alma's husband Andrew appears on the scene and, in a mad frenzy, attempts to reclaim his wife…",

        "text": "Complication start to arise in their passion of love, a decision has to be made. But the conflict for Alma is that she loves both her husband and her lover Carole. Alma stands in between playing the victim of their love and abandonment. It is certain for moments that Alma wants to be with Carole, but Alma's husband stands to claim her.\n\nLa Pirate obscures in every moment between these five characters revolving around Alma to make the decision. We are never really sorted out about the characters, instead we are put in like them in the center to figure out. Carole says to Alma that she should so go back to her husband as she can't ask her to…\n\nA romantic farce by Doillon, so: varying registers of general unpleasantness, an extratextual salaciousness (Jane Birkin’s husband is played by…her brother, though this compounds the developing issues of ownership), plenty of knockabout pledges of in/fidelity, and as an added bonus, a drunken vacillation between English and French that only renders everything all the more destabilizing; “I didn’t come here to kiss you. I came to bash your teeth in.”\n\nThe specifics of this particular love triangle—made a pentagon with two observers whose purpose for participation is even more inscrutable—are largely in the past, the film working entirely in the present tense, so that only the characters themselves are cognizant of the necessary details. However, things open up once you remember…\n\nDoillon’s claustrophobic five-hander of doomed love and erotic indecision carried out at a hysterical fever pitch of nearly unbroken intensity. Something of Zulawski’s exploded passions in the way love plays out as an enormously physical battle of wills, violence and tenderness offered in turn by the very same hands, Birkin’s unhappy wife trapped by her desperate yearning for both. “I didn’t come to kiss you. I came to knock your teeth out!” The film’s so intensely focused on emotional purity, that there’s a strange sort of lack of consistency to the characters’ identities, especially regarding the bumbling detective and the preternaturally wise young girl witnessing and frequently commenting upon the unhinged proceedings; it matters less who any specific person happens…"
