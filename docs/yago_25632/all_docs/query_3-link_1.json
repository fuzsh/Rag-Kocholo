        "text": "Jacques Doillon (born 15 March 1944 in Paris, France) is a French film director. He has a habit of giving lead roles to inexperienced young actresses in his films on family life and women. Some actresses to break through are Fanny Bastien, Sandrine Bonnaire, Judith Godr√®che, Marianne Denicourt and Charlotte Gainsbourg and Juliette Binoche. His 1990 film La vengeance d'une femme was entered into the 40th Berlin International Film Festival. The following year, his film Le Petit Criminel won an Honourable Mention at the 41st Berlin International Film Festival. In 1993, his film Le Jeune Werther won the Blue Angel Award at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival."
