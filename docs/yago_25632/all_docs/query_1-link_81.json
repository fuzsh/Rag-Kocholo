        "text": "Famous because\n\nAvailable on general release in a few days, Gigola is the first film written and directed by Laure Charpentier (from her novel of the same name, published and censored in 1972). Lou Doillon stars as George, known as Gigola. A figure straight out of 1960s Pigalle, an eccentric character on the margins of society, she’s a dandyish tomboy in the midst of the heady Parisian nightlife. It’s a sensitive role which portrays a woman acting like a boy, as well as a moving depiction of female homosexuality. In February Doillon can be seen at the theatre, in two different shows: L’image, from a short story by Samuel Beckett, and a reading of “L‘une“, both wwwd by Arthur Nauzyciel.\n\nZoom\n\nShe was born into showbusiness, with a director father, Jacques Doillon, and a famous singer/actress/icon mother, Jane Birkin. She had her first acting role when very young, in 1987, in Agnès Varda’s Kung Fu; in 1998 she appeared in “Trop (peu) d’amour”, a film directed by her father. Since then she’s been managing her career herself and has several strings to her bow: a muse, model, film and theatre actress, she switches between the different disciplines that together enrich her personality.\n\nPersonal style\n\nNatural, energetic and enthusiastic, with a dash of rock lifted by her own innate elegance. Super Arty Active.\n\nHair\n\nLong, brown et natural.\n\nIn public\n\n“Depends when, and where. I never plan in advance, its always in balance with my “mood of the day”, and the reason why I am going out.\n\nWhether I fell strong or frail, womanly or masculine, serious or on the contrary, if I want to make people smile. That’s why I never “impose” on myself a look, and that I have so much fun creating a person every time.”\n\nIn private\n\n“Pretty much the same! I have to re invent myself all the time, but I guess that I “tune” it down… I don’t like to impose on my friends and family a look that is too noticeable, and become a “walking statement”, or at least not in my country. That’s why I like to travel. Far away, I can put on a “costume” and be someone else. every day.”\n\nShoes and bags\n\n“I have a collection of bags and shoes, but I nearly always wear the same. I never know what I’ll end up doing in the day, so I tend to go for practicality: a big bag, to carry books, diary’s, markers, ipad, toys etc… And a good pair of shoes, that will take me home, even if I don’t find a cab!”\n\nJewellery\n\n“I sadly lose most of my jewellery, except for precious ones that I don’t wear, or the Jewellery that’s not mine! I always have rings, necklaces and ear rings, but I don’t take them off, or at least, till they fall of. I don’t spend a lot of time getting ready in the morning, so if I don’t sleep with it, I’ll forget to put it on.”\n\nFashion tips\n\n“Find your own, they’ll always be better than other peoples… Know yourself, have fun re inventing everyday, there are no limits to your imagination. Nothing is sexier than confidence in your own style. It’s only for you, forget about what the ‘others” may or may not think.”\n\nStyle icons\n\n“Little Edie Bouvier, because she represents every thing I wrote about in Fashion Tips…. dressing up for yourself, re inventing.”\n\nFavourite items in clothing\n\n“Sentimental Vintage… But I don’t have Favourites”\n\nFavourite designers\n\nI don’t have favourites, There are people I love, people I wear, people I respect, and they are not always the same…Yves Saint Laurent for his “woman”, Martin Magiela for his vision, Karl Lagerfeld for his culture and curiosity, John Galliano for his creativity, Olivier Theyskens for his cuts, Marc Jacobs for his 70’s nostalgia, Alexandre Macqueen for his dreams…. I could go on for hours.”\n\nFavourite music\n\n“None, and All… Goes from Nick Drake, Leonard Cohen, Kate Bush, Patty Smith, Bod Dylan, David Bowie to Bright Eyes, Grizzly Bears, M.I.A, Siouxsie and The Banshees, Daniel Johnson, Jeffrey Lewis, Moldy Peaches.”\n\nFavourite movies\n\n“Arg, I hate these Favourite questions… Les diaboliques Cluzot, Vertigo Hitchcock, Elephant Man Lynch, La commune Watkins, La drolesse Doillon, The apartment Wilder, All About Eve could go on, and on.”\n\nFavourite actress\n\nHirley MacClain, Bette Davis, Gena Rowlands, Ann Bancroft, Juliette Lewis, Valeria Bruni, Catherine Deneuve, Suzanne Sarandon, Meryl Streep, Simone signore, Helen Mirren, Katharine Hepburn, Helen Hunt, Juliette Binoche.\n\nFavourite books\n\n“Thousands, thats my hell… Its what I do most, so lets give only Italian ones….! Curzio Malaparte La pelle, Svevo La coscienza di Zeno, Italo Calvino (all), Dino Buzzati (short stories), Dante Hell.”"
