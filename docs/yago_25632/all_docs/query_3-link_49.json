        "text": "It is the story of a film director who decided to suddenly fire the main actor of his next film in the middle of shooting. He then decided to take the place of this actor himself and immediately changed the scene to be filmed. It would be a sex scene. He instructed the main actress to undress for the purpose of the script. He would kiss her several times on the pretext that the scene required it. The scene would be filmed more than forty times. Everything took place in front of the director’s partner.\n\n“All of a sudden, he decides that there is a love scene, a sex scene between him and me,” the actress told France Inter, a French public radio channel, on February 8. “And we do 45 takes. I take off my jumper, I’m bare-chested, he gropes me and French-kisses me.”\n\nWhen asked if she was abused by the director, the actress said yes. The movie director was, at the time, in a relationship with British actress and singer Jane Birkin, who was on set as an assistant.\n\nThe director, who doubled as an actor, was 44 years old when the events took place. The main actress was a 15-year-old girl. His name was Jacques Doillon. Her name was Judith Godrèche. There was a 28-year gap between them. She was a minor and had been in a relationship, since she was 14, with another equally old French filmmaker, Benoit Jacquot. Jacquot was 40 years old, so 25 years older than the minor girl. Years after the events, she has just filed a complaint for “rape of a minor” against the two men. She is now 51. Doillon is 79, while Jacquot is 77. Doillon denies the facts. Jacquot said that the relationship with Godrèche, was consensual. Police opened an investigation.\n\nHere is another story of a man who visited a harras in North Korea. He was accompanied by a TV crew and a translator for the needs of a documentary. He made multiple misogynistic and insulting remarks while addressing women.\n\n“You’re going to take a nice shower, you’re going to think of me,” the man said to his guide who was a woman. “Her little p***y,” he added. While visiting the stud farm, the man is heard uttering obscene remarks about women: “Women love to ride horses,” he says. “Their p***y rubs against the pommel of the saddle. They’re big sluts.”\n\nThe man even went so far as to “sexualize” an 11-year-old young girl. “If it (the horse) gallops, she will have an orgasm,” he said about the little girl who was horseback riding. He continued while looking at her: “That’s my girl, keep going!”\n\nA little later, the man was filmed weighing himself. “124, darling!”, he exclaimed to his translator, who was a woman. “Wait, and now I’m not erect! When erect, it’s 126.” All this while getting closer to her, who literally found her back pressed against the wall.\n\nThe man in question is Gérard Depardieu, a colossal French actor. He is now 78 years old. The degrading comments, which aired on France 2, a French TV channel, last December, were made in 2018 in the midst of the #MeToo wave in the United States and show that Depardieu must have felt untouchable to utter such words.\n\nDepardieu and Doillon are representatives of the New Wave, the generation of French cinema which emerged in the 1950s. This French auteur cinema has overturned everything in its path, to the point that its filmmakers are among the intellectual figures revered at festivals and by a large part of the press. I remember that when I took the journalism school exams in France, there were no tests without questions relating to the New Wave or a representative from this cinematographic movement. The filmmakers of the New Wave and their champions have achieved the status of being untouchable in the name of French cultural exceptionalism.\n\nDepardieu is accused of sexual misconduct by many actresses, as is Doillon. Both reject the accusations. Depardieu, Doillon and Jacquot are not the only ones. In recent months, accusations of sexual misconduct have been leveled against other French directors by a number of actresses. The video about Depardieu resembles the Donald Trump Access Hollywood Tape, obtained by the Washington Post in October 2016. In that video, then-presidential candidate Trump and Billy Bush, a television host, make lewd remarks about women.\n\nThe French response to what appears to be the trial of sexism and sexual violence reveals a troubling element of our French cultural exceptionalism which has served until now to hide detestable secrets and to excuse misogynistic behavior and sexual predation. There is a huge cultural divide. There are those who defend the accused. This is the case with French President Emmanuel Macron, who believes that Depardieu “makes France proud.” And there are those who denounce those who condone intolerable actions and the violence which crushes thousands of women.\n\nWe French see ourselves as Casanovas. This means that love and sex are our playing field. In other words, it is like saying that we play in our home base when it comes to sexuality and love. We brag about surveys which conclude that the French are the best lovers. These surveys are regularly the subject of press articles and subjects of debate, exuding self-congratulation. In 2015, a study by the extramarital dating site AshleyMadison.com found that French men are considered the best lovers in Europe.\n\nWe French like to say that we have mastered the art of seduction like gastronomy, wine and champagne. Seduction is French, we believe. Seduction is inherent to the French way of life. It is as much a part of the love game as it is of the sexual dance. It induces libertinism, we think. So, it’s not a taboo. The codes of this French national sport vary: they range from glances to smiles, attentiveness, diligence, humor and sweet little words. Basically, we use a wide repertoire to seduce the one we like.\n\nThe problem is that we are convinced that it always works. We think that the object of our desire, attention or assiduity will eventually give in. We are convinced that they will say yes. It is inconceivable that we would be turned down. It’s always been like this. The motto is “try your luck.” He or she will eventually say yes. We therefore think we are irresistible. In every Frenchman there is a bit of the famous Italian adventurer Giacomo Casanova, if we don’t think we are Casanovas ourselves. Casanova lived during several periods of his life in Paris, where he perfected his role as a gentleman.\n\nLike this Italian heartbreaker, we experience every rejection (in Casanova’s case it was each breakup) as a failure. To the point that until #MeToo, it was commonly accepted that when a woman said no to you, you had to insist because deep down she was testing you by not saying yes immediately. She wanted to see if you cared enough about her. She wanted to see whether you were really serious or she wanted to be difficult by showing you that she was not an easy woman. So there was a sort of secret code. At no time did we emphasize consent.\n\nAlmost 15 years ago, I changed departments at Agence France-Presse (AFP) in Paris. As is often the case when you are the new kid, you are invited for a coffee or a drink by your managers and colleagues to help you adapt quickly. There are some people you already know but there are others who are complete strangers to you. And in a company with more than 1,500 journalists around the world, it happens that people only know you by your name. During these gatherings, I learned that a former colleague in the department had been the subject of an assiduous and unsolicited courtship on the part of an eminent government minister. This colleague had just left AFP.\n\nI won’t name the individual, because it’s not my place to tell someone else’s story. In addition, I did not witness the events. What I am writing about is based on stories from colleagues who had worked with her and who were there at the time. Several people have told me what happened and their versions are similar. I spoke some time ago on LinkedIn with the former colleague to whom this happened, but I never mentioned the incident out of respect.\n\nThis former colleague worked in my new department. As is often the case at AFP in France, different government ministries are attached to different AFP departments, depending on the issues. There are journalists who are also responsible for covering a specific government minister, their ministry and related issues. The minister in question was covered by my new department. France is a country where the government is almost everywhere. Private sector employees ask the government to intervene in the event of layoffs in their company or when the strategy does not take their interests into account. Government ministers have power and do not hesitate to make it known to journalists.\n\nThe former colleague, who had to cover this powerful minister, found herself to be the object of his unsolicited advances. He had bouquets of flowers delivered to her at the office and called her regularly. Although my former colleague had repelled his advances, the minister did not let go. Frustrated, my colleague complained to the head of the department who in turn took the matter to the CEO. It was the latter, according to my colleagues’ accounts, who managed to put an end to this sexual harassment. He must have passed the word to the minister that he had to stop immediately.\n\nThe harassment to which our colleague was subjected immediately stopped. But this former colleague was not the first woman to whom this powerful government minister had paid such assiduous and unwelcome courtship. His nicknames were “heartbreaker,” “ womanizer,” and “ladies’ man.” These are rather laudatory qualifiers. There are many men who admire those who are called “ladies’ men,” and “womanizer.”\n\nMost of my former colleagues who told me about the sexual harassment they had witnessed ended up saying: “this guy goes crazy when he sees a skirt” or “he loses all control as soon as he sees a skirt.” At the time, these comments did not alarm me any more than my colleagues. Yet they reflect the fact that the government minister had no self-control, which would eventually push him to harass women. His behavior had even become a well-kept secret at AFP. Young female journalists were being warned by their colleagues to stay away from him. Let’s not forget that he had enormous power. But neither I nor the others saw it as a toxic behavior that could harm women. No one thought that his behavior was problematic and that what he was doing was breaking the law. We didn’t have today’s reading at the time. We didn’t have the same lens.\n\nThe female colleagues who told me what their former colleague had experienced said this of the eminent government minister: “he is filthy.” Another said to me: “he’s a jerk.” “Filthy” or “jerk” are adjectives that many French women used when describing a guy who didn’t know how to take a no for an answer. He would continue to insist when they kept rejecting his advances or did it even when they had repeated many times that they were not interested. They also used these adjectives to describe guys who used salacious and sexual remarks all the time and guys who crossed the line.\n\nFor a long time, a woman who denounced unwanted advances was called names in the name of the game of seduction. One of the arguments of the defenders of Depardieu, Doillon and others is that they are thrown to the wolves due to the puritanism or prudishness imported from the United States. Except that if we ask the following questions to the same people, I’m not sure they would keep their support to the actor.\n\n If you were the father, uncle, brother, cousin, sister, mother, aunt or grandparent of this little 11-year-old girl sexualized by Depardieu, how would you feel?\n\n If you were the father, uncle, brother, cousin, sister, mother, aunt or grandparent of this 15-year-old girl who thought she was going to make a film with an actor who was replaced at the last minute by a director who immediately imposed a sex scene on her and rubbed against her, how would you feel?\n\nI don’t think it’s a story of prudishness or puritanism but of judgment. The problem is that in France there is a refusal of introspection. We have decided that everything is perfect at home; that we are unique and different. The slightest change is seen as giving in to the American culture. We like to see ourselves as defenders against the Americanization of the world. There is no doubt that Depardieu’s images and comments would have outraged millions of people in the United States. It is true that Depardieu and others are presumed innocent, but we cannot ignore the testimonies of the victims.\n\nThis same culture of libertinism or tolerance of sexual misconduct has also led to putting an asterisk on the professional advancement of women. In France, when a man is promoted or occupies an important position, it is natural. But when a woman is promoted or lands an important job, we talk about “couch promotion” or “bed promotion.” A vulgar expression which implies that she owes her success to the fact that she slept with a powerful manager; she allegedly granted sexual favors in exchange for job advancement.\n\nThis anathema, this insult had been attached to a friend of mine, who was appointed government minister by former president Jacques Chirac in 2002. She suffered the daily contempt and mocking comments from her male colleagues and the president’s court. The worst part was that some people often tried to grope her during official receptions, believing that she was loose and that they had the right to help themselves. Although she tried to protest, the damage was done. She had confided to me and another friend who had agreed to join her team, that fellow male ministers called her “a whore” and interrupted her every time she tried to speak at the council of ministers. They regularly commented on her clothing with saucy adjectives. “It shows off your beautiful little ass” was one of the so-called compliments that came up most often with inquisitive looks that always made her uncomfortable.\n\nOnce, my friend and I asked her why she wouldn’t go public or talk about it to the president.\n\n “It will make things worse,” she replied. “They will say that I provoked them because I wear skirts or that I am frigid. What do you think the president will do?”\n\nShe seemed to be telling us that it was the whole culture that the country needed to examine if it wanted to change things. It’s okay for the game of seduction, but it should be a game where both parties have a say. When one party ignores you or says no, the game should end. If the other party continues, it is no longer a game of seduction but it is something that should be punishable by law. The problem is that the right way of looking at sexual harassment and predatory behavior is presented by the people whose actions are tolerated and by their supporters as giving in to the Americanization of the culture in the name of wokeism. In looking at this as an American cultural invasion, they are missing the point. They say it would amount to sanitizing male-female relationships or declaring all men to be sexual predators, sexual maniacs or sexually depraved. It is the French exceptionalism and the French culture that are being threatened, they trumpet. And it hits home in a country which has always been suspicious of globalization. A globalization whose figurehead is the United States.\n\nIt is sad to say it, but in France, it will take many years for #MeToo to produce a real catharsis as was the case in the United States and other parts of the world."
