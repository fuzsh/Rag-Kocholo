        "text": "French director, born in Antibes in 1960.\n\nA fan of genre and B-grade films, as a teenager, he created a fanzine dedicated to his passion: Rhesus Zero. In the late ‘70s, he attended the IDHEC then founded Starfix, a magazine of reference for genre cinema. In the late ‘80s, Christophe Gans joined producer Samuel Haddida’s team, for which he developed several scripts, including The Drowned, which he directed as part of the medley of animated sketches, Necronomicon. Two years later, he created HK Magazine devoted to Asian cinema. His first feature film was the renowned Crying Freeman, an adaptation of the famous manga by Kazuo Koike and Ryoichi Ikegami. In 2001, he directed Brotherhood of the Wolf, which was a huge box-office hit. He then left to shoot Silent Hill in the United States, adapted from the cult videogame of the same name. Back in France, he produced a new adaptation of the tale Beauty and the Beast."
