        "text": "When one thinks of #transgression in #cinema, names like John Waters, Bruce LaBruce, Da Michael Haneke, Kenneth Anger, early Pedro Almodóvar and Lars von Trier come to mind. Transgression—that is, the #subversion of social conventions, the attack on viewer #comfort and the questioning of the #statusquo—has traditionally been linked to the most underground cinema that “goes beyond all limits set or prescribed by taste, morality or any other traditional value system shackling the minds of men.” That is to say, transgressing has traditionally meant eating dog poop in the street, showing blood and gore, not shying away from explicit sex and confronting the viewer with uncomfortable moral dilemmas. But there is another kind of transgression that is subtler, less aggressive and perhaps, sometimes, more effective. Take, for example, #GuessWhosComingtoDinner, an eminently commercial comedy in which Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy played one of the parents of an interracial couple in 1967, a few months after marriage between people of different races was legalized in 17 states in the United States. Many intellectuals and critics attacked the film for turning the black protagonist into a perfect son-in-law (played by Sidney Poitier), as if only by being the best at everything could he be accepted by the white family. But Stanley Kramer’s film, clearly a #romanticcomedy, was a box-office smash in the country, even in the South, where Hollywood studios took it for granted that any production with black main character. When it comes to #RedWhiteandRoyalBlue, the film details the enemies-to-lovers relationship between the son of the first female President of the US, and the grandson of the British King. Where is the transgression? Some argue it's the film's sex scenes: wild, spirited and slightly racy at one moment, and profoundly earnest and vulnerable in another. Seeing gay sex in unapologetically “schmaltzy” rom-com can be seen quietly radical. Especially since the film became one of top three most-watched romantic comedies of all time on Amazon Prime. Yet perhaps the biggest transgression lies in the #idealism of the film’s none-too-obvious discourse. “Our present idealism is our future reality. It can be,” director Matthew Lopez said in an interview. “I think the only way to create a better world is to first imagine it.” In a world where violence, horror, injustice or grotesqueness do not cause us dread or discomfort because they are constantly before our eyes, on social media, in the news, in the morning magazines, on the streets we walk down, maybe what is really transgressive right now is simply the opposite: kindness, tolerance, freedom—in short, idealism, that is, the ability to dream of a better world. And Red, White and Royal Blue does just that. #nicecore #romance #LGBTQ+ #popculture #optimism #representation #masculinity\n\nImage Source : X Saira Banu’s picture in towel went viral When we talk about beautiful actresses in Bollywood, Saira Banu’s name is also included in this list. Saira Banu, who started her film career at the age of just 16, did many great films in her career and ruled Bollywood for many decades. At the same time, her beauty was discussed more than her acting. Saira’s beauty was discussed far and wide. Even Dilip Kumar could not stop himself after seeing her immense beauty. But today we are going to show you such a picture of Saira Banu, in which you will not be able to take your eyes off her boldness. <!-- /8323530/Khabar_Desktop_VDO_1X1 --> Saira was seen in a towel Actually, a picture of Saira Bano is making a lot of headlines on social media right now, in which she is seen with Dharmendra. This picture of both of them is from the film ‘Pocket Maar’, in which both are seen giving romantic poses. However, the thing that caught the attention of the fans the most in this picture is the actress being seen in a towel. Till now people had seen actresses like Kajol-Katrina in towels, but as soon as this picture of Saira came out, people were shocked. This picture of Saira is about 50 years old, so seeing the actress in a towel like this years ago is surprising the fans. However, people are liking this picture of the actress a lot. Saira’s beauty is worth seeing in this picture too. About Saira Let us tell you that Saira first appeared on the big screen in the year 1961 in the film ‘Junglee’ opposite Shammi Kapoor. The film was very successful and with this her career also got a good start. For this film, Saira was also nominated for the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. After this, Saira Banu gave many consecutive hit films in her career. Now Saira Banu has taken a break from the world of acting years ago. But she remains connected with fans through social media.

Speculations ensued, with humorous rumors suggesting that the woman was Kim Soo-hyun’s mother, hinting at a potential connection between the co-stars. However, the truth behind the photo reveals a different story. The woman in question is actress Zhang Tian-ai, who collaborated with Kim Soo-hyun on a film project titled “Cherry Blossom” during his early career days. Zhang Tian-ai’s appearance alongside Kim Soo-Hyun in this photo led to amusing misconceptions, especially given their similar visuals at that time. Kim Soo-Hyun and Zhang Tian-ai in “Cherry Blossom” (Credits: Kbizoom) Contrary to the fanciful rumors, Zhang Tian-ai’s journey in the entertainment industry took her back to China, where she pursued acting and furthered her career as a commercial actress. While the photo captured a moment from Kim Soo-hyun’s earlier years as an aspiring actor, its recent resurgence sparked lighthearted speculation in the online community. Kim Soo-Hyun and Kim Ji-Won are a couple in “Queen of Tears” (Credits: tvN) Although the photo may have created an optical illusion, drawing comparisons between Zhang Tian-ai and Kim Ji-won, it’s clear that the resemblance was a coincidence. Zhang Tian-ai’s evolution as an actress and her distinct career path highlight the intriguing stories that emerge from the entertainment world’s interconnected relationships.

At least, until recently. Star of his generation, immensely popular face thanks to Burnt Silver, The Aura, Paulina, The Mountain Range, Truman or his television work, his first approach to writing, with the series I’m your fan, left a bitter aftertaste. With Blondi, which premieres today, Friday, in Spain, began writing the story with Laura Paredes (Trenque Lauquen), thinking of starring in it, and after the pandemic he decided to also direct it. He could have stopped there. But Javier Milei won the Argentine presidential elections and Fonzi has undertaken a campaign against the far right with the best weapon he masters: cinema. And that is why he will get behind the cameras again to shoot his second feature film, We are Bethlehem, about one of the most distressing and media-covered cases in Argentina: the one that led to the imprisonment of a woman who had suffered a spontaneous abortion in 2014. More information Blondi, the protagonist, became a mother at 15. She tried to have an illegal abortion and it went wrong, and now she has a deep friendship with her son, Mirko. She is a cool mother, a lover of disco The Velvet Underground & Nico, who smokes his own herbs and is now suffering because Mirko is becoming independent. Fonzi is as much a hurricane as his character: “The film is born from an image in a novel of a mother and son alone in the world. Blondi It is a militant film. Because it talks about women, about single mothers, who mother alone, without fathers present. We show new ways of being a mother, not that perfect motherhood pressured by the system, but a new one that comes to bring relief to mothers. There are many things about being a mother from other generations that are becoming obsolete. It is much better today to build a closeness with your children, to have them tell you things, rather than being the authority in the house. Blondi is good one day, bad the next. She doesn’t hide it. Something that we should all teach, because that way those children are better prepared for frustration.” Dolores Fonzi and Rita Cortese, in ‘Blondi’. Fonzi defends a cocktail of social, feminist and political activism. “The moment requires it. Because for me everything is very bad. The world is a disaster. Being a militant in the street is very good. Being a seasoned militant, exposing one’s body in the street, seems necessary to me. And my way of putting my body on the line is by making films.” And for this reason, his second film will be “even more of a struggle than “Blondi”. The filmmaker does not hide her disagreement with Milei. “You recently came to Spain to collect a medal, right?” True, from the hands of the president of the Community of Madrid. “In other words, we all live in the same bag of cats.” And she...\n\n\"Gone With The Wind\" premiered on this day in 1939 (in Atlanta, Georgia, to be exact). It was based on Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel. The movie became the highest-grossing film of its time. If one were to compare it to any other movie that has been released to this point in time and were to do so on a per capita basis adjusted for inflation, it almost certainly remains the highest-grossing film of all time. \"Gone With The Wind\" is a romantic tale about the American South during the Civil War. It has since fallen into disfavor because it is \"a romantic tale about the American South during the Civil War.\" In 2020, HBO briefly removed \"Gone with the Wind\" from its streaming service. This created a public controversy leading to its return to the streaming platform at a later date. When it did return, it contained a \"trigger warning\" as well as an explanation of its historical context. Today's perspective suggests that it contained racial stereotypes. It almost certainly did. The book was written in 1936 and the movie was produced in 1939. Times have changed. Real Jim Crow laws were in place back then, not to be confused with the more recent, politically contrived ones. On that note, the movie actually created a racial breakthrough based on its art rather than the social awareness that was to arrive decades later. Hattie McDaniel won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her stellar performance in the movie. She thereby became the first Black actress to win an Oscar. It's worth noting that Ms. McDaniel won her Academy Award 24 years before the next Black actor, Sidney Poitier, won for Best Actor... 43 years before Louis Gossett, Jr. won for Best Supporting Actor... 51 years before Whoopi Goldberg duplicated Ms. McDaniel's feat for Best Actress... and 62 years before Halle Berry captured the Oscar for Best Actress. For such a racially insensitive time as compared to our current point of view, it is amazing that the movie underscored the talent of an actress who portrayed a stereotype in the contemporary 1939 movie. Today, academic elites tell us that \"context\" matters... even when it comes to calling for the extermination of Jews. While I disagree with its application in that case, perhaps we should also consider \"context\" when we judge the past rather than imposing today's standards, particularly when it comes to matters that are far less consequential... like old movies. Think about how easy it is to judge others without paying deference to the times during which they lived. By all means, tear down their statues, expunge their names from the history books, and vilify who they were and what they did... without any context. Just remember, you will have taught future generations to judge you the same way. Please feel free to disagree. As Rhett Butler might say, \"Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.\" #movies #judgment #context #history #perspective\n\nONE DOC A DAY: Day 23 - Four Daughters Ever since Joshua Oppenheimer’s The Act of Killing proved the Academy loves a meta-doc, a steady stream of filmmakers have tried to repeat its trick, using re-enactment to take a more lateral approach to storytelling. Whether by having people re-enact versions of their own trauma to achieve some kind of catharsis, or having actors restage scenes to consider new angles, Four Daughters is a curious combination of the two. This is the story of Olfa and her daughters, two of whom are absent, having been ‘devoured by the wolf’. Olfa’s understanding is that like Rose from Titanic, she’ll tell her story while actors interpret it. But it’s not that straightforward: Olfa’s eldest daughters will be played by actresses, who will re-enact scenes with herself and the real daughters; another actress will portray Olfa, stepping in when the scenes become too upsetting, but sometimes appearing beside her too. It sounds confusing because it is. We meander through the story in disjointed, sometimes surreal scenes, cut with interviews: the family grows up against the backdrop of the Tunisian revolution; the unhappy parents are distant, bordering on abusive, but the sisters’ close bond is their sanctuary. Then the encroaching influence of the Islamic State engenders the creeping radicalisation of the eldest girls until they’re gone. The story is often hard to grasp. Scenes shift midway through: fact and drama collide in a way that’s difficult to delineate. But to what end? Oppenheimer’s films inspired interrogations of national trauma and collective forgetting: their re-enactments forced the retrieval of wilfully lost memories, shaming the perpetrators of genocide in a totally unique way. Not all re-enactments need to spark a national reckoning to be impactful, but they need a purpose which elevates them beyond gimmick. There’s a fine line between powerful and pretentious. While Four Daughters was often fascinating - Olfa pitted against her brilliantly empowered daughters, and the generational divides they laugh about but which clearly cut deep - I wasn’t clear what the re-enactments were aiming for. Perhaps they revealed a truth only perceptible to those removed from it, as Olfa’s double offered her own interpretations of her behaviour? Or were they holding Olfa to account, forcing an acceptance of responsibility? Whether anyone arrived at a deeper understanding of why things happened is debatable. What impact can re-enacting trauma have on those for whom it was so formative? Judging by this experiment, a profound one: the youngest daughter is visibly riven with grief and inner conflict over her divided loyalties and love for those who’ve wronged her. The elder takes to her role with such intensity that the actor playing her hated stepfather has to step away as she wields a knife. ‘He shouldn’t be scared’, she tells the director, ‘film or not, I’ve moved on from this’. You worry this process will move her right back.\n\nImage Source : Preity Zinta is making a comeback with this film Preity Zinta, who started her career with the film ‘Dil Se’, is a well-known name of Bollywood.
