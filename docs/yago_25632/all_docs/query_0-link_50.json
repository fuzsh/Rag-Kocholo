        "text": "Also notching up a Venice Film Festival award for J.M. Coetzee drama Dust (1985), she went on to act for arthouse heavyweights including Jacques Rivette (Love on the Ground, 1984), Jean-Luc Godard (Keep Your Right Up, 1987) and Agnès Varda (Kung-Fu Master, 1987). Birkin maintained this form into the 90s, with films by Bertrand Tavernier (These Foolish Things, 1990), James Ivory (A Soldier’s Daughter Never Cries, 1998) and Alain Resnais (Same Old Song, 1997) asserting her worth, alongside further work for Rivette and Varda.\n\nShe continued making music, releasing often underrated albums of original material and songs by Gainsbourg (they remained friends after breaking up). Tired of her pin-up image, she began performing live at the age of 40, cutting her hair off and cutting loose. ‘It was,’ she’d say, ‘fantastic.’\n\nIn later life, Birkin multi-tasked impressively, campaigning for women’s and LGBTQ rights, writing plays, directing (2007 family drama Boxes) and publishing (Munkey Diaries 1957-1982). She consolidated her iconic standing playing herself in Hong Sang-soo’s Nobody’s Daughter Haewon (2013), though suffered from ill health in recent years, including a minor stroke in 2021. In 2020, she released her final album, Oh! Pardon tu Dormais…, a sometimes heartbreaking set of reflections on her losses. ‘Catch me if you can,’ she sang, ‘I’m almost gone from view.’ But not forgotten."
