        "text": "Nineteen ninety-seven as a movie year ended, happily, with more bangs than whimpers as James Cameron’s Titanic , particularly, provided a rare example of something big and expensive being also good and moving. I should have mentioned in my review the magic whistle that is blown at a crucial moment not only as a cry for help, but also as the eternally loving response to a plea of one’s beloved from beyond the watery depths of the North Atlantic. Be that as it may, Curtis Hanson’s L.A. Confidential remains for me the best picture of 1997. In fact, L.A. Confidential marks the first occasion during my 30-year membership in the New York Film Critics Circle in which my taste coincided with the collective wisdom of my colleagues, not only in New York, but also in Los Angeles and Boston, as well as at the National Board of Review.

I found this not to be the case, but then I paid little attention to such glorious first-week breakout hits as Starship Troopers, Mortal Kombat: Annihilation and Flubber .

Miranda Otto, Love Serenade.\n\n3. Alison Elliott, The Wings of the Dove.\n\nBest supporting actress:\n\n1. Gloria Stuart, Titanic.\n\n2. Sarah Polley, The Sweet Hereafter.\n\n3.

Linus Roache, The Wings of the Dove.\n\nBest supporting actor:\n\n1. Rupert Everett, My Best Friend’s Wedding.\n\n2. Jude Law, Gattaca.\n\n3. J. T. Walsh, Breakdown.\n\nOther notable female performances, in no particular order, were: Hope Davis, Anne Meara, Parker Posey, The Daytrippers ; Rebecca Frith, Love Serenade ; Deborah Kara Unger, Holly Hunter, Rosanna Arquette in Crash ; Garance Clavel, When the Cat’s Away ; Chloe Ferguson, The Quiet Room ; Minnie Driver, Grosse Pointe Blank and Good Will Hunting ; Sandrine Kiberlain, To Have (or Not) and Beaumarchais the Scoundrel; Mira Sorvino, Lisa Kudrow, Janeane Garofalo, Romy and Michele’s High School Reunion; Victoria Thivisol, Ponette ; Gong Li, Temptress Moon; Judi Dench, Mrs. Brown; Julia Roberts, Cameron Diaz, My Best Friend’s Wedding; Kim Basinger, L.A.

Confidential ; Philippe Noiret, Thierry Lhermitte, Ripoux Contre Ripoux ; Albert Finney, Ben Chaplin, Washington Square ; Burt Reynolds, Mark Wahlberg, Don Cheadle, Alfred Molina, Boogie Nights ; Samuel Jackson, Eve’s Bayou and Jackie Brown ; Robert De Niro, Jackie Brown and Cop Land ; Stellan Skarsgard, Amistad and Good Will Hunting ; Robert Forster, Michael Keaton, Jackie Brown ; Bill Murray, The Man Who Knew Too Little .\n\nMatt Damon, The Rainmaker and Good Will Hunting ; Danny DeVito, Jon Voight, Mickey Rourke, Roy Scheider, Danny Glover, Johnny Whitworth, Randy Travis, Andrew Shue, The Rainmaker ; Morgan Freeman, Matthew McConaughey, Anthony Hopkins, Djimon Hounsou, Nigel Hawthorne, David Paymer, Amistad ; Robin Williams, Casey Affleck, Cole Hauser, George Plimpton, Good Will Hunting ; Jack Nicholson, Greg Kinnear, Cuba Gooding Jr., As Good as It Gets ; Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro, Wag the Dog ; James Spader in Critical Care and Crash ; Albert Brooks in Critical Care ; Georges Du Fresne, Ma Vie en Rose; Philip Baker Hall, John C.

One bit of wisdom I have acquired over a year of being raked over the coals for my rave reviews and praised to the skies for my pans is this: Sneer and the world sneers with you, cheer and you cheer alone."
