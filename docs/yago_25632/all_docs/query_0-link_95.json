        "text": "Paris: Jane Birkin, the British-French singer, actress and style icon who was catapulted to fame by her tumultuous relationship with singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, has died, a close source said on Sunday. She was 76.\n\nBirkin had been suffering from health problems in recent years that had forced her to cancel concerts.\n\nThe cause of death and other details were not immediately available.\n\nBirkin catapulted to fame through her turbulent relationship with legendary singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg and her heavily accented French.\n\nWith her flared jeans, mini dresses and messy bangs, Birkin was a fashion icon in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1984, Hermes named one of its handbags after her, which remains a sought-after status symbol.\n\nMacron hails Birkin as 'complete artist'\n\nFrance's President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday hailed Jane Birkin as a \"complete artist\" and an \"icon\" after the French-British singer and actor's death at 76.\n\n\"Because she embodied freedom, because she sang the most beautiful words in our language, Jane Birkin was a French icon. A complete artist,\" Macron said on Twitter.\n\nStyle icon\n\nThe daughter of an actress and a naval officer, Birkin married James Bond composer John Barry, with whom she had a daughter, Kate. The marriage lasted three years.\n\nShe moved to France after meeting Gainsbourg on the set of a romantic comedy in which he was her co-star.\n\nThey had a daughter, Charlotte, who became a hugely successful actress and singer.\n\nThe musical and romantic relationship between Gainsbourg and Birkin was famously tempestuous.\n\nDuring one of their raging rows, Birkin tossed herself into the River Seine after throwing a custard pie in Gainsbourg's face.\n\nShe blazed her own trail after walking out on France's favourite bad boy in 1980.\n\nIn her around 70 films she has worked with leading French directors including Bertrand Tavernier, Jean-Luc Godard, Alain Resnais, James Ivory and Agnes Varda.\n\nBut she remained forever associated with Gainsbourg, who continued to write songs for her after their split, including \"Les dessous chics\" about lingerie being used to try to cover up a relationship on the rocks.\n\n\"It's the most beautiful song about separation you could ever have,\" Birkin told AFP in a 2018 interview.\n\nHer oldest daughter, Kate Barry, a photographer, died in an apparent suicide in 2013.\n\nBirkin is survived by her daughter with Gainsbourg, Charlotte, and her daughter Lou Doillon, a singer, whom she had during a 13-year relationship with French director Jacques Doillon.\n\nKey dates in the life of British-born actress and singer Jane Birkin, who spent most of her life in France:\n\n- December 14, 1946: Born in London, her mother an actress.\n\n- 1965: Aged 17, marries James Bond composer John Barry with whom she has a daughter, Kate.
