        "text": "French director, born in Paris in 1952.\n\nAfter studies in humanities (he thought of becoming a teacher), Jacques Audiard turned to cinema. He started out as an assistant on Roman Polanski’s The Tenant and Patrice Chéreau’s Judith Therpauve. He then worked as an editor, before becoming a renowned scriptwriter. He turned to directing in 1994 with See How They Fall. The film, starring Jean-Louis Trintignant and Mathieu Kassovitz, won the César for Best First Film. His second film, A Self Made Hero, was adapted from the novel by Jean-François Deniau. Four films followed (Read My Lips, The Beat That My Heart Skipped, A Prophet, and Rust and Bone) which each obtained numerous international prizes and were met with wide audience acclaim. Dheepan, his latest film, won the Palme d’Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival."
