        "text": "21/08/2012 - The winner of the 2011 Cesar for Best Actress is to star in Doillon’s next film beside James Thiérrée\n\nAccording to our information, this June and July Jacques Doillon (photo) finished filming his 27th feature, Mes séances de lutte (lit. “My fighting sessions”), in the utmost secrecy. His cast included Sara Forestier (awarded the 2011 Cesar for Best Actress for The Names of Love , to be out in cinemas on December 12 in Télégaucho, and currently on the set of Suzanne) and Swiss actor James Thiérrée (recently noted for his performance in Tony Gatlif’s Freedom ).\n\nJacques Doillon described the film’s screenplay, that he wrote himself, to Cineuropa as being about \"the relationship of a couple who feel that they have to physically confront each other, not without sensuality, to find themselves and to return to each other. A form of struggle sets in. What starts as improvisation slowly becomes a codified ritual. Each fights with their own weapons. He perhaps puts his finger on something that has stopped them from living correctly, while she perhaps finds something for her amusement. How will this imaginative confrontation set in a countryside house end?\"\n\nJacques Doillon, who among other films made The Little Gangster (1990), was selected three times to compete in Venice (in 1987 with Comedy!, in 1996 with Ponette, and in 2003 with Raja which then won Best Actress) and twice for Cannes (in 1979 with The Hussy and in 1984 with The Pirate). Nominated for a Louis-Delluc Award in 2008 for Just Anybody , he is also about to release Un enfant de toi (lit. “A child with you” - read more - 4A4 Productions). KMBO Distribution will be distribute the film in France during the last three months of the year.\n\nProduced by the filmmaker’s own production company, Doillon et Cie, Mes séances de lutte has been pre-acquired by Canal+, and has received a €430,000 advance on receipts from the National Film and Moving Image Centre (CNC) as well as the support of Backup Films. Sophie Dulac will handle the film's distribution in France and Doc & Film International will handle its international sales.\n\n(Translated from French)"
