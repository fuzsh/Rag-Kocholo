        "text": "Films\n\nPonette (Jacques Doillon, 6pm, FilmFour\n\nPonette is a four-year-old girl whose mother has just died. Her father (Xavier Beauvois) has to go away on business, so the girl is left in the country with her aunt and children to slowly come to terms with death and absence. A touching, perceptive film: Victoire Thivisol, aged four, got Venice's best actress award.\n\nRide With The Devil (Ang Lee, 1999) 8pm, Sky Premier\n\nThe American civil war may not seem a natural subject for the director of Sense And Sensibility and The Ice Storm, but Lee creates a compelling mix of the epic and the intimate. It concerns two friends - Skeet Ulrich's Jack, Tobey Maguire's Jake - who join a band of Confederate Bushwhackers, guerrillas who ambush Union forces. This is similar territory to The Outlaw Josey Wales, and the action is breathlessly exciting; but Lee focuses more on the relationships: Jack's involvement with a young widow (played by singer, Jewel); and Jake's deepening friendship with former slave Daniel (Jeffrey Wright). A beautiful and incisive portrait of men at war.\n\nThe Godfather Part 2 (Francis Coppola, 1974) 10pm, Sky Cinema\n\nBest of the Godfathers, and the first sequel to win a best film Oscar. It follows the career of Al Pacino's Michael Corleone, now establishing himself as most ruthless of the mafia dons, and interweaves the roaring-20s story of his father Vito's arrival in New York, and how he became a man of respect. Robert De Niro is spellbinding as Vito, in another opera of bloody violence and dark nights of the soul.\n\nSummer Of Sam (Spike Lee, 1999) 10.20pm, Sky Premier\n\nIt's summer in the city of New York, 1977, and serial killer David Berkowitz, the \"Son of Sam\", is on the prowl. Lee expertly cranks up the heat, the fear and sense of panic: vigilante gangs bring near hysteria to the streets. But for all the hectic ambience, it's hard to believe in his central characters: troubled couple John Leguizamo and Mira Sorvino, and punk Adrien Brody, just back from England.\n\nPlaying God (Andy Wilson, 1997) 12.50am, Sky Premier\n\nArresting but silly drama starring X-Files investigator David Duchovny as a drug-addled, struck-off surgeon who gets the chance to work again, courtesy of gangster Timothy Hutton, who wants someone to patch up his henchmen. Debut director Wilson barely summons the nasty edge of his small-screen Cracker, but the dialogue is snappy and in the hip cast are Angelina Jolie and Peter Stormare."
