        "text": "The daughter of Jane Birkin and director Jacques Doillon — as well as the half-sister of Charlotte Gainsbourg — Lou Doillon worked as an actress and model before embarking on a musical career in the 2010s. Born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, Doillon began acting as a child, making her film debut in Kung-Fu Master at age six and working steadily in European cinema after appearing in her father’s 1998 film Trop (Peu) d’Amour. Her unique beauty also made her a French fashion icon, and she represented Givenchy as their face and muse.\n\nBy the mid-2000s, however, Doillon’s passion for singing and writing songs led her to work with American pianist Christopher Brenner, with whom she wrote “The Girl Is Gone,” a song that appeared on a picture disc included with a 2007 issue of Visionaire Magazine. Her musical career really began to take shape in the 2010s, when she was urged by Etienne Daho to release an album of the songs she had written. In 2012, the ICU EP arrived, followed by the full-length Places, which featured contributions from Daho and Philippe Zdar. The following year, the album earned Doillon a French Grammy for Best Female Artist, making her the first person to win that award for a debut release in decades. For her second album, she collaborated with Timber Timbre’s Taylor Kirk as co-producer. Lay Low, which delivered more smoky, intimate songs, was released in Europe in 2015 and in the U.S. in early 2016.\n\nLou Doillon is available for corporate events, private shows, milestone celebrations (birthday, anniversary), fundraisers, festivals, and more."
