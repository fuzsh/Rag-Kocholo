        "text": "Assembled on the roof of the Battery Parking Garage south of the 9/11 Memorial, the twin beams reach up to four miles into the sky and are comprised of eighty-eight 7,000-watt xenon lightbulbs positioned into two 48-foot squares, echoing the shape and orientation of the Twin Towers. The installation can also be viewed from a 60-mile radius around lower Manhattan.\n\nTribute in Light was conceived by several artists and designers who were then brought together under the auspices of the Municipal Art Society and Creative Time: John Bennett, Gustavo Boneverdi, Richard Nash Gould, Julian LaVerdiere, and Paul Myoda, with lighting consultant Paul Marantz.\n\nTribute in Light is produced by Michael Ahern Production Services.\n\nThis project is supported by a Market New York grant from Empire State Development and I LOVE NY/New York State's Division of Tourism, awarded through the Regional Economic Development Council initiative.\n\nAs an extension of Tribute in Light, for the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 attacks, we are once again partnering with New York City Tourism + Conventions and buildings throughout the city who will light up their facades and rooftops in sky blue. “Tribute in Lights” is a unique but simple gesture of collective remembrance that illuminates the city each year on the evening of September 11 from dusk until dawn.\n\nParticipants on the 23rd anniversary will include ConEdison, the Empire State Building, Bloomberg L.P., One World Trade Center, Niagara Falls, Empire State Plaza, State Fairground – Main Gate & Expo Center, Albany International Airport Gateway, Lake Placid Olympic Center, MTA LIRR – East End Gateway at Penn Station, Moynihan Train Hall, Walkway Over the Hudson State Historic Park, The H. Carl McCall SUNY Building, State Education Building, Alfred E. Smith State Office Building, and bridges throughout the state including the Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge, Kosciuszko Bridge, “Franklin D. Roosevelt” Mid-Hudson Bridge, and the Fairport Lift Bridge over the Erie Canal.\n\nTo confirm your participation, please complete the form at the bottom of this page."
