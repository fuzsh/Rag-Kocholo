Reasons to be Cheerful in Aberdeenshire No. 2\n4. Mary&#39;s Sang\n5. Miniature 2: Union St. at 4.30am\n6. Smile\n7. Do Nothing Till You Hear From Me\n8. That&#39;s Life\n\nFeaturing &#39;The Blue Lamp Suite&#39; by Richard Ingham and a further three tracks, this album was recorded in the Blue Lamp just before lockdown. Thanks to Aberdeen City Council Creative Fund for enabling us to commission the suite and record this album. Huge thanks to the dearly missed Sandy Brown, who sadly passed away recently and is missed by all throughout Scotland in the jazz and wider musical community.\r\n\r\nWe dedicate this album to Sandy. In honour and memory of Sandy all proceeds from sales of this album will go to Friends of ANCHOR - www.friendsofanchor.org - based at Foresterhill Health Campus, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. The charity&#39;s aim is to provide the best possible treatment, care and support to cancer patients. Thank you for your support and any donations that you can give in Sandy&#39;s memory. We hope that you will enjoy our music too!",
