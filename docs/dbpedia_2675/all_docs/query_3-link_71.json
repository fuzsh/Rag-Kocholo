The band has performed at many events, commissioned new music and recorded an album, the proceeds of which are going to the Friends of Anchor, a local cancer charity.\n\nGetting involved\n\nIf you play a big band instrument or you sing, and you’d like to join us, then we would love to see you. We would particularly welcome trumpets and trombones!\n\nFor further information, please contact Pauline via the details on our website."
