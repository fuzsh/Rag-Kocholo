        "text": "It was practically a ritual: When a person in Indianapolis would die — a very rich and very eccentric person, very often a hoarder — the call would go out to Earl Cornwell.\n\nCornwell would arrive at the deceased's place of residence, assess the possessions gathered over a lifetime, catalog the cache, arrange it and later, with his folksy patter and bang of a gavel, liquidate it.\n\nThe founder, chief auctioneer and preternatural force behind Earl's Auction Co., Cornwell cleared away thousands of average estates since opening his shop in 1956. \"I can't think of nothing we ain't sold,\" he told The Indianapolis Star in 2000, \"except machine guns.\"\n\nBut his special niche was the big, high-toned and freaky.\n\nCornwell died July 17 at age 92 after suffering a stroke a week earlier. He was buried Friday in Bethel Cemetery in Indianapolis.\n\n\"The 'House of Blue Lights' is what put Earl on the map,\" said Jim Marsh, 86, a retired auctioneer and for years Cornwell's rival for high-end Hoosier estate liquidation. \"That really got his business going.\"\n\n► Watch out! Check out how huge this Brown County rattlesnake is\n\n► Remembrance: 'Grateful city' remembers IMPD Deputy Chief Jim Waters, a beloved friend, dedicated officer with the gift of gab\n\nThe \"House of Blue Lights\" was what people called the secluded, supposedly spooky mansion in the 6700 block of Fall Creek Boulevard that was owned by millionaire Skiles Test. The grounds were strung with blue Christmas lights, hence the name. Test had more than 100 cats and dogs and his own pet cemetery with headstones and brass nameplates. His swimming pool was 80 feet long and 14 feet deep. He bought things in bulk, and so in addition to millionaire baubles such as diamond rings, a grand piano and oriental rugs, his heirs needed to unload an enormous surplus of everyday stuff — spare plumbing and electrical parts by the thousand, case after case of canned food, 300 bottles of aspirin, three cases of Pepto-Bismol and so on.\n\nTest died March 18, 1964 at age 74, and over a three-day period in May of that year, Cornwell pulled off an amazing feat. An astounding 50,000 people attended the auction, which Cornwell claimed was a record for auction attendance.\n\nIn 1966, Marsh aced out Cornwell for the J.K. Lilly business. But in 1973, Cornwell got Alex Krannert, the widow of Victor Krannert, a founder of Inland Container Corp. Alex Krannert had died of injuries suffered when fire swept through the house on her remote, wooded property at 4350 W. 52nd St., which contained among other things a mausoleum for the embalmed remains of a Doberman pinscher.\n\n\"Mrs. Krannert bought only the finest,\" Cornwell, a skilled promoter, trumpeted in the Indianapolis Star in advance of the sale, referring to a gold serving set, a fainting couch upholstered with horse hair, 14 barrels of cut glass, music boxes and so on. \"We're expecting the largest crowd that's probably ever been assembled in Pike Township.\"\n\nThe one-day sale drew some 20,000 people and grossed more money than the Test sale, Cornwell said at the time.\n\nEarl E. Cornwell was born in 1924 on a farm on Possum Holler Road outside the Southern Indiana town of Salem. After serving in World War II, he enrolled in the Davis School of Auctioneering in Morgantown and went into business. He opened Earl's Auction in a decrepit school building (\"tramps was a-sleeping in it,\" Cornwell recalled in a 2000 Star interview. \"Abandoned is what it was.\") in the then-rural 5200 block of Lafayette Road. How rural? The area was known as Snacks Crossing.\n\nHe married, had three children and joined the Elks and the Masons.\n\nHis auction style was certainly a performance but it was atypical, said his auctioneer son, Earl Cornwell Jr., who runs the family business with his auctioneer sister, Tammy Caito. (The new Cornwells last year took a page out of the patriarch's book by liquidating the astonishing amount of stuff accumulated by Nancy Irsay, the widow of Colts' owner Robert Irsay.)\n\n\"My dad preceded the days of sound amplification,\" said Earl Jr. \"I never heard him go into the traditional chant. His method was more that he would personalize it somehow. He'd say, 'Fifty dollars from the lady with the hat.'\"\n\nBesides his salesmanship, Cornwell had a strong work ethic. \"I saw him at one sale start at 9 a.m. and literally still be selling at midnight without going to the bathroom or eating,\" his son said. \"I said, 'Dad!' and he said, 'Try getting up at 4 a.m. and milking cows.' He'd lived through the Depression.\"\n\n► More, much more: The Strange Case of Marjorie Jackson\n\n► More on Irsay auction: So many things, she couldn't get to them all\n\n► More unusual Indianapolis history: That time Dad ate 102 White Castles\n\nCornwell's crowning achievement may have been the auction at Marjorie Jackson's house, 6493 Spring Mill Road, on June 22, 1977. Jackson was the widow of grocery store scion and millionaire investor Chester Jackson. Mistrustful of banks, she kept her millions of dollars in cash at home, in trash bags. Word got out. Burglars broke into her house, took her money and killed her.\n\nCornwell got the call. \"It was a very big deal,\" said his son. \"I was a freshman in high school. People were jumping the fence. There was talk there was money still lying around the house.\"\n\nThe auction was attended by 10,000 people, despite a steady rain. Jackson did not have children, and so Cornwell was charged with clearing out absolutely everything: gold jewelry, a wide selection of mink outerwear like a cape, full-length coats and several hats. \"And here is one with Marjorie Jackson's name in it,\" Cornwell told the bidders, as his wife, Grace, modeled yet another mink coat.\n\nCornwell coaxed $14,000 for a Cadillac sedan, $1,000 more than Jackson had paid for it a year before.\n\nHe didn't stop at the fancy things, but continued with the small stuff like throw rugs ($300), ordinary dresser drawers that once might have contained cash ($35), feathers from Jackson's dead parrot, Boyd ($15).\n\n\"Earl did a big business that day,\" said Donna Shea, who was there. \"He sold everything. He sold Marjorie Jackson's bloomers. I remember him holding them up. Earl was indomitable.\"\n\nCornwell was about to offer up Jackson's gold-inlaid false teeth, but her lawyer stopped him because, the lawyer said, the teeth were needed as evidence in a civil dispute as a dentist had billed Jackson's estate $200,000 for the teeth."
