        "text": "I first saw \"The Blue Lamp\" when I was a youngster at the Mile End Empire cinema in East London. At that time I thought it was a really good film. However, I saw it again recently on television.\n\nIt is still a good film. It takes place in post-war London. It was a time of severe austerity, rationing and people just making do. However, it was a time of public order and most crime was petty. Most men has done military service and women had been marshaled into war work and accepted discipline easily . The youth movements, play centers, and a large network of youth clubs kept teenagers busy and out of trouble and military conscription looked after the older male teens. There was a\"teddy boy\" problem but it was easily contained and minimal. Unlike today, people could walk the streets and feel safe and there were no no-go areas in London. Furthermore,football teams such as Arsenal, Spurs and Chelsea attracted large gates of over50-60,000 and there was never any crowd trouble. The metropolitan police was at the grounds to play music at half time and that's about all they did. The \"Blue Lamp\" does however,highlight a few policing problems. There was a serious working class resentment against the police. There was a feeling that many police officers had \"done well\" out of the war through contacts with the black market. Other police officers they thought had had a good war by being exempt from military service. Also it was thought that the police ware harassing people for petty things (the barrow boy for example). This resentment is shown in the film by the little girl who finds the murder weapon and does not want to talk to the police about it. She is not shy but says that her father says \" all coppers are .....\" The police interfere in peoples lives. A seventeen year old is picked up for leaving home and given a \"talking to\" even though she is old enough to get married and is holding down a job. Many of these police officers are not from London and do not know the community or its culture. One is from Wales and another Andy is from Maidstone. It is apparent that the police do not really have the consent of the people they are policing. The George Dixon character has been a police officer too long and is somewhat cynical about the job. His murder by psychotic killer played wonderfully by Dirk Bogarde shows the dangers faced by an unarmed police force. Lastly, I don't really understand why the B.B.C. resurrected George Dixon from the grave when they already had a \"beat copper\" series on the radio called P.C. 49. This radio series was very popular and there was a cartoon strip spin- off which appeared in \"The Eagle\" comic. Also there were two successful films made: \"The Adventures of P.C. 49 and \"A Case for P.C. 49.\" It could have easily been adapted for television.\n\n17 out of 24 found this helpful.
