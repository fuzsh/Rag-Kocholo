        "text": "The Lampie tends to be less busy during the holidays, as SCaT tutelage isn’t running then, hence fewer players turn up. It took a while to get going last night (wasn’t in full swing until about 11!). And the Atholl Highlanders was played twice in the space of twenty minutes! Oh no! Na, it’s a great tune. Try and make it if you can.\n\nSad to report that this session appears to have bit the dust, due to poor attendance. If you do come to Aberdeen and are looking for a few tunes, please contact me through a private message here, and I’ll see what can be done.\n\nThanks to those of you who did drop in past over the years.\n\nKenny.\n\nYou got there before me , Bren. Very sad - and unexpected - news. Sandy allowed us to disrupt the peace in his pub on Monday nights for I don’t know how many years now, and the Blue Lamp has been the home of Aberdeen Folk Club for several years now as well. The Aberdeen jazz community are going to miss him as well.\n\nI’m sure I speak for all the regulars from our Monday nights in sending condolences to Sandy’s family. RIP.\n\nHoping we can all meet up again to play some music, and sink a few beers, in memory of Sandy.\n\nSandy’s grandson has made it clear that the Monday session was one of his priorities on reopening and it’s been going great so far.\n\n(With some distinguished guests on Monday 8th Nov.)\n\nAs of last week, the pub has also started opening every day of the week.\n\nSessions everywhere seem to have been reborn with new energy.\n\nLong may it continue.\n\nAfter “hosting” this session for maybe more than 10 years - it was very handy following on from the “SC&T” Monday flute class - I hadn’t been in since just before Covid hit, so maybe 3 1/2 years ago. The session is definitely still going, as of Sept. 2023, starting after 9.00pm. Out of the 15 or so players there, there was no accompanying instruments at all, something I don’t ever recall seeing before in any session that size in Scotland. Usually there are too many. There was a distinct preponderence of jigs over any other tune type, even reels. It was disappointing to me that, although it was good to see some musical friends I hadn’t encountered in years, there was no “new blood”, apart from one of the players who hadn’t been to the session in previous years. To be honest, not much of the repertoire seemed to have changed, either. Anyway, it is what it is. If you’re in Aberdeen on a Monday night, drop in.\n\nI have doubts about the future of this session after dropping in last week [ end of July 2024 ]. Since I was last there, maybe 2 months ago, both a large TV screen and a dartboard have been introduced to the area where the session used to take place. The usual session “host” couldn’t make it, and only 2 players turned up apart from myself and another flute player. This may not always be the case. If I hear any news, good or bad, I will update."
