        "text": "This slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nThursday night at the Blue Lamp was the place to be for some really great music. Sweden’s The Concretes made their way to the Blue Lamp and shared the stage with Florida’s Million Young. Both groups will be on tour for a few shows together and both made their way to Sacramento for the first time.\n\nBefore the show started I was able to talk to members of Million Young. Mike Diaz, Lee Mazurk, Eric Rizzo and David Stephen make up the group. They were outside the Blue Lamp along with one of their friends who now lives in San Francisco.\n\nI took some of their time before the show began and asked them a few questions. Million Young volunteered Mike Diaz to be their spokesman but after a bit they all took turns talking about the tour.\n\nThey indicated they were from Coral Springs, Florida. ”We’ve been touring with the Concretes for a few days now. We’ve played a few dates with them.” Mike said. When I asked if they would be touring with the Concretes for the entire tour Mike indicated they would tour with them just for the West Coast states.\n\nMike Diaz started the band and was a one-man band for about a year. He said, “About 6 months ago we all just started playing together. We played together with some bands in High School. We’ve known each other for a while.” When asked if they’ve been to Sacramento before, “No we haven’t this is our first time in California.” was the response.\n\nThursday was a perfect day to be in Sacramento and I passed that on to Million Young. One of them said, “Oh yeah it was miserable the last two days. In Portland and Seattle it rained a lot.” They were happy to enjoy some California sunshine reminding them of Florida weather.\n\nI asked about their discography and Mike said, “We have 2 EPs and we’ve just put out a full length album in February. It’s called Replicants.” Million Young members were very personable and seem to get along.\n\nSometimes, when trying to get a short interview, you have to pin down a band member to get them to answer a couple of questions. These guys were more than willing to answer questions and give their opinions. It was a pleasure getting them to chat.\n\nAs they took the stage, those that came to watch a great show were not disappointed. The crowd had steadily grown and started moving towards the stage.\n\nI was a little thrown off track when I heard Mike Diaz start off their set. An electronically altered voice began the set. I was not expecting that and became quickly captivated by their sound. From the start of their show, Million Young, engrossed the audience and brought the crowd closer to the stage.\n\nTheir sound was a little hard to pinpoint but I think that’s where their musical strength lies. Electronic, Indie, soothing melodies both musical and vocal also define their sound. Audience members moved along with the music as Million Young played their set.\n\nAfter two EP’s (Sunndreamm and Be So True) they released a full length album. Replicants has been out since the middle of February. Several of those compositions were played live at the Blue Lamp. The lineup has changed in the past but Mike Diaz has been at the center of Million Young. Lee Mazurk, Eric Rizzo and David Stephen currently make up the rest of the band.\n\nMillion Young delighted the audience and made new fans and friends on Thursday night. Either after the end of the evening’s show or the following morning Million Young was going to drive down to Los Angeles. The Troubadour was their next destination. Log on to their website to hear some of their compositions and follow their progress you won’t be disappointed.\n\nThe Concretes were the headline act and they took the stage a few minutes after Million Young cleared off their equipment. The stage appeared crowded with 6 Concretes members on stage with their instruments and Lisa Milberg taking the microphone. Lisa came to the stage covered by what looked like a Native American throw-blanket. She warmed up after a few minutes and lost the blanket.\n\nThe Concretes have been around since 1995 with several members leaving or being replaced. The crew that made it to Sacramento was missing two members who recently had babies. Their usual 8 members were reduced to 6 for the Blue Lamp show.\n\nThe Concretes played several songs from their latest release “WYWH” (Wish You Were Here). Catchy songs such “Good Evening, Crack in the Paint, My Ways, All Day” and others were played by the Stockholm based band. Good Evening started off their set and the audience moved to the slow disco tune. Their tunes seemed to make the audience move as soon as it started and those that knew the lyrics sang along.\n\nThe Concretes were formed in 1995 and their first American release came in 2004. The Concrete’s self-titled album released a couple of singles that brought the Concretes to an international audience (Say Something New and You Can’t Hurry Love). Since then three other albums were released before last year’s WYWH.\n\nThere will undoubtedly be comparisons made between the current Concretes line-up and that of the Concretes with lead singer Victoria Bergsman. The band’s sound still has a Pop sound to it but, in my opinion, it has evolved for the better. Their current tour should bring more fans into their camp.\n\nTheir current tour began in Oslo Norway on February 19 and has already grown to incorporate more shows. After their tour takes them through various dates in California they will go to Mexico City by next weekend.\n\nThe songs performed were delightfully played. Lisa’s enchanting voice was well complemented by the band that seemed to be crammed on stage. The audience moved with the beat in unison and many moved within a couple of feet of the stage.\n\n“We are the Concretes; this is our first time in Sacramento.” Lisa said after their second song. As the fans cheered on she continued “and we like you a lot”. As she spoke in her Swedish accent the audience reacted with cheers, support and applause.\n\nAs the Concretes moved from one song to another it became apparent that the show was quickly coming to an unwanted end. As they finished their last song the Concretes left their audience wanting more. The Concretes ended up singing many songs from their WYWH album. Fans of the band enjoyed a great performance and many stayed around to talk to the band members.\n\nI had asked Lisa before their performance began if I could ask her or someone from the band a couple of questions. After the show I was able to talk to her as she enjoyed a smoke outside the Blue Lamp.\n\nI had noticed during the performance that she was being backed up by 5 musicians I knew there were 8 members all together and I asked her about that. “We have been the Concretes forever but then we’ve had some members come and go and we are actually 8 in the band. When we tour we are very rarely 8, we’re usually 6 sometimes less sometimes more.” said Lisa in her charming Swedish accent.\n\nLisa gave me the first names of the members who were on stage. “Dante played drums, Jon plays guitar and he’s not usually with us but he’s playing guitar because our regular guitarist is not with us he’s having a baby. There’s Per, he plays organ and we have Ludvig and he plays keys. Fritjof plays bass and he’s not usually in the band either but our bass player also had a baby.” As she laughed she said, “There’s a lot of babies.” She finished saying, “then there’s me, Lisa and I sing and that’s it.”\n\nI asked about their current tour and at that time some fans brought CDs they had just purchased for her autograph. Lisa interacted with everyone, was very friendly and seemed to be genuinely happy to talk to anyone that approached her.\n\n“We started our tour in San Francisco,” Lisa replied when I asked where they started their West Coast tour and that leg of their tour started on February 25. “We then went to Portland, Seattle and Vancouver and then we drove all the way from Vancouver to here.” Lisa went on to say.\n\nI asked if they were driving to the Troubadour (their next show) in L.A. “We’re going to drive a little bit tonight and then we’ll finish the drive tomorrow. We’re trying to beat traffic.” After a few more stops in Southern California they’ll end their current tour and I asked Lisa about that. “We’re going to end up in Mexico City. We’re just doing the one show there but I’m sticking around for a few days to get some sun. I’m thinking about maybe also buying some embroideries and piñatas and tequila. I love Mexico and love very much Mexican food.” I asked her if they had eaten in Sacramento and they had. “We had dinner here in Sacramento. We had Tex Wasabi which was barbecue and sushi in the same place. That was fun but weird and rather nice.” I had to tell her that earlier in the day I had some Korean tacos and that she could probably find them in L.A. “\n\nThe Concretes were a delight to listen to and the Sacramento audience made a good impression. Lisa Milberg ended by saying “I thought the crowd was very nice.” With that I thanked her for visiting Sacramento and wished them success as they continue their tour."
