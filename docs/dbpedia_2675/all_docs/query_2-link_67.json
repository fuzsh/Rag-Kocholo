        "text": "1. The light show appears when charged particles from the sun are dragged into the atmosphere by the earth’s magnetic field and collide with nitrogen and oxygen atoms. This collision releases flashes of coloured lights – which we see as the northern lights.\n\n2. The colour of the light depends on the type of atoms involved in the collision.\n\n3. Aurora borealis isn’t the only light show the world offers. The southern hemisphere has its own version, called aurora australis – the southern lights."
