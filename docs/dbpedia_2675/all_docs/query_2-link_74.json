        "text": "So i've had this app for a really long time, and everything's been completely fine, it's actually been a pretty good app to use, but a few issues. Whenever you had changed the LED lights on the walls, it would also go along and change the ones in the room next door simultaneously. This was fine though, because it could be easily changed with the remote that came with the lights, but it was still a bit annoying. To add to that, around a week ago I accidentally unplugged my lights from the wall, but when I plugged them back in I noticed that my LED lights had disconnected from the app. I was really confused, and tried to fix it on my own, but to no avail. It seems like when you disconnected my lights from the wall, your unable to reconnect it to the app, even with uninstalling it and reinstalling. So the problem still hasn't been fixed and I still can't use the app for specific colors, but I decided to write this review incase anyone else has similar problems.\n\nHad the under glow kit for nearly about a month. Worked flawlessly up until the most recent App Update. I noticed that the longer strip (1/4 LED strips) on my driver side no longer want to turn off when switching it from the app. I have to flip on the ignition key forward on/off and cycle it until doesnât shuts off. When I am able to switch it off, the driver side LED strip takes a a second or two to completely shut off. When changing colors on the streaming or certain effects, the colors would run and cycle all the way down up until it gets near the end toward the back. LEDâs work, colors work, but itâs like it gets stuck. Iâm certain itâs not due to improper installation as it once worked for nearly 1 Month use. I love the lights but hate that the app does this update, I wish there could be a way to revert to the old version and not have automatic updates like you can toggle as a switch as you do with your pc. Please fix this issue devs.\n\nI've had these lights for 3 years and they still work well. Only problem is that feautures on the app that I used to be able to use don't work anymore. To change the color i have to go into custom and create a color. The wheel doesnt work, I cant set up any systems anymore, and I can't connect it to music. All I can do is pick a color and its brightness. The white gradient wheel does work, just not the rainbow one. Quality lights, don't recomend if each light being slightly different shades from each other bugs you. Personally I think Its beautiful that way and also is the cost of having a full color range. I just really wish I could get the features back and it's slightly annoying having them there but not work anymore."
