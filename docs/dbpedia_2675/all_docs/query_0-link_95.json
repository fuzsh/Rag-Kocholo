        "text": "I am cleaning and archiving hundreds of multicam MP4’s from my hard drive, and I stumbled across this one. We never posted it at the time, then I forgot about it. This is a special show with Kepi, B-Face AND Roy McDonald from the Muffs doing a full band set! Great set full of Kepi and Ghoulies classics.\n\nOn a side note, I was going to ask Roy about The Muffs and when they were going to tour, but I got busy filming MTX… Kim passed away a couple weeks after this show. It was probably for the best that I missed him.\n\nThis show was mixed before I had the ability to matrix my own audio, or rebelance it in Izotope… the mix is “OK”, but it could have been better. Oh well.\n\nRecorded by: Shayne Stacy\n\nEquipment used: Canon HFG40 x2, Gopro Hero4 Silver x3.\n\nSoundboard audio via Sony PCM-M10 through the soundboard.\n\nMotorcycle is a new band with Chris Sabatoni from The Croissants, Kortnee Barnett Angel on bass, and Sarah Sintaku on drums.\n\nI missed the first song because I was talking to friends, and right when I got my camera going, the next song was a false start. Don’t hold that against them, they are really good!\n\nRecorded by: Shayne Stacy\n\nEquipment Used: Canon HFG40 & Rode Videomic Pro Stereo\n\nIt was nice to see the Mean Jeans in a bigger room. They have only played smaller places in Sac before. I thought that I pushed the soundboard remix a little too hard and caused some distortion, but this sounds pretty clean.\n\nRecorded by: Shayne Stacy\n\nEquipment: Canon HFG40 x2, Gopro hero4 silver x3\n\nVideo Enhancement/denoise in Adobe Premiere Elements\n\nAudio remix in Izotope RX7\n\nEdit by Tromster\n\nMy wife & I went on another date night to the Verbal Abuse & MDC show. Jesse Davis was there with a few of his cameras so I took the night off. I contributed the soundboard audio to the mix. Here’s 2 songs from that show.\n\nRecorded by: Jesse Davis (+ 1 other camera guy)\n\nEquipment used: 4 camera edit. Sound Matrix is 2 sony mics, 1 realistic, a zoom h4n, and stereo soundboard by shayne stacy.\n\nEdit by: Jesse Davis\n\nWith Ben & Gabi announcing the sale of the Blue Lamp, I thought it would be nice to remind people of the good times there. Thanks to you both & AJ & Chris for putting up with empty shows for so long.\n\nOK, on to this show. Flipper was NOT empty. In fact, the show was sold out. It was a killer show, and I really want to thank Stephen for giving permission to film- very nice of you.\n\nHere are the details: Recorded by: Shayne Stacy\n\nVideo Equipment used: Canon HFG40 x2, Gopro Hero4 silver x3(enhanced in adobe permiere + neat video)\n\nAudio Equipment used: Sony PCM-M10 through the soundboard + Rode Videomic Pro Stereo audience\n\nAudio Matrix: Shayne Stacy (my first one ever!)\n\nEdit by: Tromster\n\nSound engineer: Andrew Scott\n\nI have seen Frack about 5 times now and this was their best set I have seen. You could tell that they were pretty happy to be opening the sold-out Flipper show. The new songs sound great, while keeping in the best of the older ones. Features the crowd pleasing Rise Above cover, like you’ve never heard before!\n\nRecorded by: Shayne Stacy\n\nEquipment used: Canon HF G40 & Rode Videomic Pro Stereo\n\nI’ve had this new role at my old job that has been super demanding. I had conference calls scheduled late on the same night that The Authorities played Blue Lamp. I wasn’t going to let that stop me. I took the call in the car while parked outside the venue, then ran in and scrambled to set 5 cameras up before they started. It came out pretty good considering the circumstances.\n\nThis is the era of Blue Lamp lighting that had cycling colors, which would overexpose the video in parts, and be so dark it was hard to see in others. It was still not too bad.\n\nRecorded by: Shayne Stacy\n\nEquipment used: Canon HFG40 x2, Gopro Hero 4 Silver x3\n\nAudio equipment: Rode Videomic Pro stereo on HFG40 + Sony M10 through the soundboard, matrixed in Sony Sound Forge\n\nVideo noise reduction in Adobe premiere/neat video\n\nEdit by tromster"
