        "text": "When are the Tower’s lights turned on?\n\nEvery evening, the Eiffel Tower adorns itself in gold and sparkles the first five minutes of every hour, while the beacon shines across Paris.\n\nThe Tower’s golden lighting and beacon turn on when night falls.\n\nThe sparkles are lit up for five minutes at the start of each hour starting from nightfall, until the monument closes.\n\nWhether you’re visiting the Tower or walking nearby the monument at night, it’s an unmissable experience, typically Parisian and oh so magical! The Eiffel Tower’s lights at night are made up of three components: the golden lighting, the sparkles and the beacon. To find out when the Tower will light up in the evening, first you need to know what time the sun will set. The spotlights in the golden lighting system are turned on at nightfall, using sensors. This takes under ten minutes.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower’s beacon lights up and starts to rotate at the same time as the golden lighting.\n\nThen, the sparkles are lit up on top of the golden lighting, for five minutes at the start of every hour once the monument’s lighting is turned on. For example, if night falls at 8.35 pm, the lights will turn on during the ten minutes that follow and the first sparkles will take place at 9.00 pm.\n\nAdmire a video of the Eiffel Tower lit up and sparkling\n\nWhen are the Eiffel Tower’s lights turned off?\n\nWhen the Eiffel Tower closes at 11.45pm, the lights are switched off completely from 11.45pm (lights and beacon): the final sparkles will therefore take place at 11.00 pm. The exception is during the summer months and French holiday periods, when the Eiffel Tower closes its doors at 12.45 am: the sparkles are on each hour until 1.00 am. At 1am, though the Tower’s golden lighting and beacon are turned off, the monument continues to sparkle for a few minutes. Don’t miss out on this exceptional show!\n\nWhere can you see the best views of the Tower lit up?\n\nOur number-one advice is to visit the Eiffel Tower in the evening. You will enjoy an exceptional experience in a unique atmosphere, bathed in the monument’s golden lighting, particularly in the stairs. To make the most of the sparkles, head to the second floor and look up, admiring the sparkling spire of the monument. A magical atmosphere captivates the entire Tower. You’ll lose yourself in the collective excitement created by the lights! And if the beacon intrigues you, head to the top to discover how it works, once again by simply looking up.\n\nIf you’re not at the Tower, the advantage is that you can see the Tower lit up from many places in Paris and the Paris region! Trocadéro esplanade and Champ de Mars remain unbeatable spots to watch the show of the Eiffel Tower lights turning on at night.\n\nHow does the Eiffel Tower’s golden lighting work?\n\nThe lighting system was inaugurated on December 31, 1985 and designed by lighting engineer Pierre Bideau. It features 336 spotlights, fitted with yellow-orange high-pressure sodium bulbs.\n\nThese lights were met with unanimous international success and launched a new wave of initiatives to showcase monuments at night-time, in Paris and major cities in France and around the world.\n\nThe beams of light, aimed from bottom to top, illuminate the Eiffel Tower from inside its structure. Replacing the 1,290 spotlights in service since 1958, which previously lit up the Tower from the exterior, they highlight the monument’s delicate metal structure and light up various parts of the Tower for visitors coming at night, until the monument closes to the public. Beyond their aesthetic impact, these lights are also necessary for the Tower to operate safely.\n\nHow do the Eiffel Tower’s beacon and sparkles work?\n\nAt midnight on December 31, 1999, the entire world discovered the Tower’s beacon and sparkles.\n\nThe beacon, two beams of light with 50-mile range, is made up of four motorized marine-style floodlights. They are computer-piloted, using specific software and a programmable robotic system that controls their movements. Performing a 90° rotation, they are synchronized to form a cross-shaped double beam pivoting 360°. They have 6000W xenon bulbs, chosen for their lifespan of approximately 1,200 hours. The lighting heads are over-ventilated to avoid any risk of overheating, and a heating system is activated when the temperature drops below 32°F while the lights are off. The beacon evokes Gustav Eiffel’s beacon, representing a symbolic and universal guide.\n\nAs for the sparkles, which were also created by Pierre Bideau, 20,000 low-power 6W bulbs were installed on the four sides of the Tower, which turn on randomly in short bursts. The sparkles are lit up for five minutes exactly at the beginning of each hour, starting from nightfall, until the monument closes.\n\nSpecial moments in the Tower’s lighting history\n\nThroughout the course of its existence, the Eiffel Tower has been host to lighting effects of a festive nature. Through continual renewal of its sources of artificial illumination, the Tower has benefited from the latest innovations in lighting equipment from the very beginning – from gas to electricity, incandescent lamps to neon, passing from sodium to high-pressure, and most recently LEDs.\n\nGenerally speaking, the Tower’s usual lighting systems were not designed for special lights (colors, flags, messages), so such installations require external means of lighting used for each occasion.\n\nThe monument has been illuminated since its opening in 1889, during the World Exhibition, when 10,000 gaslights lined the trusses and platforms. Two floodlights at the top lit up the monuments of Paris. The red-white-blue beacon at the top was the most powerful in the world. Around 1900, the lights switched to electric, and 5,000 lightbulbs outlined the Tower’s decorative arches and edges.\n\nA giant, 20-foot clock installed on the second floor showed the time in luminous digits, from 1907 on. From 1925 to 1936, André Citroën funded the installation of a luminous wonderland, with 250,000 colored lightbulbs. It was a particularly effective illuminated advertising campaign: the name Citroën written on three sides could be seen from 25 miles away in all directions.\n\nBetween 1933 and 1934, a 50-foot diameter clock returned, telling the time using hands formed by beams of light. It was added to the Citroën lights, placed in the “E” of Citroën.\n\nFor the 1937 Exposition des Arts et Techniques, a huge light made from 6 miles of fluorescent tubes was installed underneath the first floor. Thirty marine floodlights covered the Tower in white light."
