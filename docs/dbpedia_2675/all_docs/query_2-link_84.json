        "text": "What did you miss?\n\nTV viewers were excited as the BBC's Blue Lights returned for a second series, but a few couldn't help noticing that the show looked a little... blue.\n\nThe drama's new run started on Monday (April 15), picking up with constables Grace (Siân Brooke), Annie (Katherine Devlin) and Tommy (Nathan Braniff). It started with a bang, as a terrifying public order training exercise saw some of the team trapped in a police van as a mob surrounded them and petrol bombed the vehicle.\n\nBut while fans were gripped by the action, some picked up on the fact that there was an overriding blue tone to the Belfast-set show.\n\nWhat, how, and why?\n\nA few posted messages on X saying that everyone's eyes were very blue and questioning whether that was really the case or if it had been added in.\n\nOne fan noted that lots of the stars' eyes were a \"deep\" shade of blue. Another viewer asked: “Has every one of the actors in Blue Lights got beautifully over exaggerated blue eyes or is it just me?”\n\nSomeone else questioned whether the cast were all wearing contact lenses. “As nearly all the cast have piercing blue eyes,” they explained. \"Their eyes are an Irish kind of shade of blue,\" remarked someone else.\n\nAnother person said: \"Good to see Blue Lights back, but the colourist and stylist have gone completely OTT by colouring clothes, eyes, walls, doors, cars, badges, gloves, all dark tones… basically everything, blue.\" \"This is a drama, not an ad for Pepsi,\" they added.\n\nSomeone else quipped: “Everything blue but the lights!”\n\nAnother said they were impressed by the colour theme, posting: \"Loving Blue Lights and the iridescent blue motif running throughout the scenes.\"\n\nBlue Lights viewers struggling to not binge show\n\nThe show was a huge hit after its first series aired in 2023, with viewers declaring it \"incredible\" and calling it the new Line Of Duty.\n\nFans have been eagerly waiting for season two and as it got under way many said they were tempted to binge watch all the episodes, but were trying hard to resist in order to draw it out.\n\nOne posted on X: \"Now for the hard decision. Binge or watch it weekly?!\" \"Part of me really wishes it wasn’t all on iPlayer as I’m not strong enough to not binge watch it!\" admitted someone else.\n\nOne fan commented: \"The addictiveness of the binge is once again all too real.\" \"Have had to restrain myself from binge watching Blue Lights,\" said somebody else, confessing: \"Not sure how long I can hold out.\"\n\nAnother joked: \"Note to self - don’t binge watch Blue Lights, don’t binge watch Blue Lights - even though it’s absolutely BRILLIANT.\"\n\nRead more: Blue Lights"
