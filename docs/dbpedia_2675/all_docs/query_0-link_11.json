He was in charge of rationing and, like the dog, was accused of stealing food from the people.\n\nThe original Blue Lamp was transferred to the new Paddington Green Police Station and stands there today. It has recently been restored.\n\nThe producers obtained full cooperation from the Metropolitan Police (the first movie to do so) and were, therefore, able to use the real-life Paddington Green Police Station and New Scotland Yard for their location work."
