        "text": "The color blue elicits different emotions and reactions in people. Some associate blue with sadness while others see it as a sign of hope and oneness. Nationally, many use different colored lights on their porches to show support for certain awareness campaigns.\n\nBut what are these campaigns and when do they take place?\n\nWhile there are numerous awareness days that claim the use of blue lights, the few we'll be going over are: World Autism Awareness, which takes place on April 2nd, and Awareness for Law Enforcement, which is celebrated multiple times throughout the year. Below we will jump into the history behind these special days.\n\nThe History Behind Blue Porch Lights\n\nLaw Enforcement\n\nThe first recognized blue porch light was used by Dolly Craig in 1989 in remembrance of her son-in-law, a law enforcement officer from Pennsylvania who was killed in the line of duty. Dolly shared her story with COPS (Concerns Of Police Survivors) who were immediately enthused by the idea. Project Blue light started shortly after this time as a special way of remembering fallen loved ones.\n\nSince then the movement has grown nationally and spread to cover law enforcement in general.\n\nAutism Awareness\n\nAnother reason to light your porch blue is for Autism Awareness month which takes place every April. It is estimated that 1 in 36 American children experience some form of autism.\n\nAutism Speaks started the Light it Up Blue Campaign in 2010 to raise awareness and support for Autism. Many national landmarks and sites take part in this campaign by using blue light decorations.\n\nTo learn more about Autism, follow this link.\n\nTo learn more about the Light it up Blue campaign, read our other blog on this subject.\n\nWhen Do you Shine a Blue Light?\n\nAs Project Blue Light has grown nationally many have started showing support for law enforcement by displaying blue lights at certain times of the year.\n\nThe initial day for honoring fallen law enforcement is October 13. However, you may see a glowing blue light on May 15th which falls under National Police week or on January 9th which is recognized as National Law Enforcement Day throughout the US.\n\nGenerally, blue lights can be lit for the entire month of April to show support for Autism Awareness. For the light it up Blue Campaign on World Autism Awareness Day specifically you are encouraged, every April 2nd, to don something blue and grab a light to shine on your porch\n\nWhy Blue?\n\nMany view a blue light as a sign of peace. It would make sense then in honor of both active and fallen law enforcement to encourage others with this kind of light.\n\nAnother possible reason for this is that it is the color of many police officer’s uniforms and the flashing blue and red lights on top of police cars.\n\nFor Autism Awareness, one explanation is that blue was chosen because it is speculated that the blue sky has a calming effect on children with autism.\n\nMore Reasons for Blue Porch Lights\n\nWhile Law Enforcement and Autism Awareness are the two most common reasons you may notice this blue glow on front stoops there are others as well. You can show your support for Alopecia Areata Awareness, a disease which can cause hair loss and is common in children, by displaying a blue porch light.\n\nAdditionally, this kind of bulb can be decorated with to symbolize awareness against human trafficking and many use them to stand for the prevention of suicide.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhether you would like to show encouragement for Law Enforcement, Autism or the other causes listed above there are many ways to do so. Buying a brilliant blue bulb and lighting up your porch is one way to spread encouragement during the months of April, May, January and October, although cool blue porch lights are fun at any time of the year.\n\nFor some neat blue bulb options click below:"
