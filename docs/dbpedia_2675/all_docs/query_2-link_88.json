        "text": "Replacement lampshades can revitalize your living space!\n\nTable lamps, floor lamps and even chandeliers can be rejuvenated with a new lamp shade.\n\nWhether your lamp has a shade already, or not, we'll help you learn:\n\nhow to measure a lamp shade\n\nwhat types of lampshades are available\n\nhow to match the style of the shade to your lamp\n\nLet's get started.\n\nChapter 1 What is a lamp shade?\n\nLamp shades have been used with lamps and chandeliers to shield and direct the light in our homes for many years.\n\nA lamp \"shade\" usually covers all or part of a light bulb, to serve a few purposes:\n\nTo protect your eyes from harsh glare\n\nTo direct the light in a certain direction for practical purposes\n\nTo diffuse and soften the light\n\nTo provide a decorative accent, enhancing the theme of a room\n\nRead on to understand the parts of a lamp shade.\n\nLamp shade parts\n\nLampshades have the following parts:\n\nA lampshade barrier or covering which blocks, directs, and filters the light, often made of fabric, paper or other materials\n\nAn opening at the top and bottom to allow light and heat to escape\n\nA frame to maintain the shape of the lamp shade\n\nA fitter such as a spider fitter to connect the lampshade to the lamp\n\nA shape designed to be both decorative and to direct the light in a particular shape or focus\n\nDecorative elements such as patterns, textures, crystals and tassels.\n\nSome shades include a hard-back lining to prevent light escaping through the sides of the shade.\n\nLampshades attach to a lamp with a fitter\n\nA lamp shade's frame will feature fitter parts which extend inward to connect with the lamp base. A lamp most often features a harp fitter which rises up from below the lamp socket and provides a platform on which the lampshade can sit, secured by a finial.\n\nChapter 2 Measuring a lamp shade\n\nMeasuring a lampshade isn't a simple as \"width, height and depth\".\n\nMany lamps shades have slanted sides which need a length measurement.\n\nOval and rectangular shades may have a different width and depth.\n\nThe shade might have rounded corners or an unusual shape.\n\nBut there is a way to measure a lamp shade which takes into account various sizes and shapes.\n\nLet's take a closer look.\n\nHow to measure a lamp shade\n\nMeasuring a lampshade will help you to find the right size shade for your lamp. Follow these tips for correct measuring.\n\nMeasure a lamp shade using a straight ruler or taught tape measure, measuring only in inches. You will need three measurements:\n\nThe width across the top, which should be measured from the outside edge of the top rim, to the outside edge of the top rim on the opposite side. Make sure the ruler passes through the \"center\" of the shade to ensure you are reading the maximum distance between the two sides.\n\nThe width across the bottom, which should be measured from the outside edge of the bottom rim, to the outside edge of the bottom rim on the opposite side. Ensure you measure \"through\" the center of the shade so that you are reading the maximum distance from edge to edge.\n\nThe height, measured on a slant, should be measured in a straight line regardless of whether the shade has straight, vertical, sloped or curved edges in profile. Measure from the outside edge of the top of the shade, to the outside edge of the bottom of the shade. It's okay for this to be diagonal when the top of the shade is smaller than the bottom.\n\nNote: Do not measure the \"vertical\" height. Always measure the slant from the outside edge of the top rim to the outside of the bottom rim, even if the sides of the lampshade are actually vertical.\n\nMeasuring for Oval and Rectangular lampshades\n\nFor oval or rectangular shades, please note there will be two additional measurements, due to the fact that the shade is wider than it is front-to-back.\n\nThe width from left to right, as measured for the top and bottom as described above.\n\nThe depth from the front of the shade to the back of the shade, which should be measured for both the top and the bottom of the shade, passing through the center of the shade in a straight line. Measure from the outside of the rim as before to the rim on the opposite side.\n\nWhat size shade you need for a lamp base\n\nWhen you don't actually have an existing shade to measure, and only have the base of the lamp, you'll need to estimate what size your replacement lamp shadeshould be.\n\nIn general, the taller the lamp is, the larger the shade will be needed, to maintain a sense of proportion. A large lamp shade on a small table lamp won't look right. And a small lampshade on a large table lamp won't look right.\n\nBe sure you have 2-3 inch separation from bulb to shade, especially for higher wattage bulbs. Be sure the top opening is wide enough to vent the heat. Compact Fluorescent bulbs are great for most lamps because they burn cooler, but you may need larger harp since CFL's are taller than standard light bulbs.\n\nMeasuring lamp shades for table lamps\n\nMost table lamps take a shade with a bottom diameter of 16\" or less, unless the table lamp is especially tall. \"Mini\" table lamps will need a much smaller shade.\n\nMeasure the lamp's height from the bottom of the base to just below the bulb socket. Try to find a lampshade with a bottom width approximately equal to this measurement.\n\nA second factor to consider is the height, which will be somewhat affected by the shape. Consider first the shape which would be best suited to the style of lamp, because for example the height of a drum lampshade will be different to the height of an empire lamp shade.\n\nYou'll then need to consider the height of the shade. There is usually a small \"drop\" from the top of the shade down to where it rests on the lamp base's fitter. This drop may be more significant for a tall cylinder or drum shade.\n\nA good height for lamp shades for table lamps is about 3/4 of the width of the shade, or 3/4 the height of the base up to the socket.\n\nYou'll want to make sure that when the lampshade is positioned on the lamp, it will be tall enough to cover the top of the lamp fitter, and also hide the hardware, socket and part of the neck of the lamp base. When you view the lamp from the side you shouldn't see the hardware parts.\n\nMeasuring lamp shades for floor lamps\n\nFloor lamps take a shade with a bottom diameter of 16\" or 18\" or larger. Similar rules apply as for table lamp shades, where the shade needs to be tall enough to cover the hardware so that you don't see the lamp socket or fitter from the side.\n\nAlso consider that because a floor lamp is much taller, it will tend to look better with a lampshade that has less of a slope to the sides, either a drum shade or something closer to a lamp shade with vertical sides. The shade also will generally be larger than that of a table lamp to keep in proportion to the base.\n\nAdjusting the vertical position of a shade\n\nIf shade looks good, but vertical positioning is the only problem, the shade can be raised or lowered by using a different size harp fitter, or a shade riser. A taller harp will allow the shade to be mounted higher up, or indeed lower down, so that you can center it and cover the hardware. A shade riser is a small adapter which extends the threaded pole on top of the harp fitter.\n\nSizing lampshades for a chandelier\n\nLampshades for a chandelier are typically much smaller than regular shades, usually in the range of 4 to 7 inches across the bottom. You'll need to make sure there is some room around the light bulb to allow for heat to flow out of the shade without presenting a safety hazard.\n\nMini chandelier shades are specifically designed for use with a chandelier. Most are designed to clip directly onto the outside of a light bulb, since the mini chandelier lampshades are relatively light weight.\n\nChapter 3 How to choose a style of lamp shade\n\nLamp shades come in a variety of shapes, sizes, colors and styles. Usually you'll be trying to pick out a shade because:\n\nYou only have a lamp base and have no idea what shade it needs\n\nYou have an existing shade but want to replace it\n\nYou want to change the style or size of an existing shade\n\nThere are some simple rules to follow to choose an appropriate style of lampshade.\n\nRead on to learn how.\n\nHow to Match a Shade Shape to a Lamp Base\n\nThe shape of the base of your lamp has a great deal to do with the appropriate shape for its lampshade. A well-chosen shade should complement the base's profile, drawing upon shapes and angles in order for the shade to be a `continuation` of the design theme.\n\nDifferent shaped lamp bases call for different shade shapes that are ideally suited to them. Consider these lamp shades for table lamps.\n\nA base featuring a curved profile is complemented by a curved bell shade. You can see here the pattern of a curve ending in a platform is repeated from the base to the shade, albeit inverted. Bell shades match well to a curved base profile.\n\nA barrel, drum lamp shade or cone-style lamp base is reflected well by a rounded drum/cylinder shade. Rounded/cylindrical bases tend to work better with rounded shades than square shades.\n\nSometimes shapes are directly repeated in the base as in the shade. Here, trapezium shapes occur multiple times and the shade is an extension of the base's design theme. Since the base's view from above/below is a square, the square shade works well.\n\nBases with a square or rectangular profile do well complemented with a rectangular shade. Since these angular shapes tend to be more modern, a square/rectangular shade is a good match.\n\nSometimes the shape of the shade may reflect the shape of only a portion of the base. Here, trapezium/pyramid shapes are repeated in the shade and the foot of the base, as well as in the patterning of the shade itself.\n\nProportions of shade and base should be reasonably similar. Here an unusually tall/thin lamp base is well complemented by an unusually flat/thin drum lamp shade, continuing the theme of elegance. Also very narrow lamp bases look good with a drum or rectangle shade.\n\nWhile both lamp base and shade here are circular, since the base features a bold shape, the shade chosen is also a boldly contrasting shape. Use a partly contradictory or balancing shape of shade for added drama. Notice the shade is still round and the base is still round when viewed from above or below.\n\nWhile this lamp base bends outward, the shade bends inward. Both elements thus feature a curved surface, but they work together to form a balance. This also produces a flowing visual line from the bottom of the lamp to the top. Notice also the need for a square-style shade due to the base's square sides.\n\nDeciding which lamp shade shape would match your base\n\nWhen you are missing the old shade from your lamp, and with only the base to work with, here are some guidelines for choosing a new replacement shade. If your lamp already has a shade which you are replacing, you could look for a similar shape and style, or consider these rules for choosing something fresh.\n\nStep 1: Look for the patterns in your lamp base when viewed from the side. Is it curvy? Is it very angular? Cone-like? Highly rounded? Rectangular? This gives you a clue about what the shape of the shade might be, unless you plan to go with a strongly contrasting profile\n\nStep 2: Consider the shape of your base when viewed from above or below. If it is square-looking, you are better off with a shade which also looks square when viewed from above or below. Remember that how the base and shade look from the side can be quite different to how it looks from above/below.\n\nStep 3: Consider the proportions of the base. Is it very narrow, or quite wide? Now take that sense of proportion and rotate it 90 degrees to the left or right. If your lamp base is quite tall and narrow, you would do well with a 'flat' shade. If your lamp base is quite wide, you would do well with a taller/thicker shade.\n\nStep 4: A shade should make the base look better without competing with it for attention. Decide if the lamp base will be the \"star-of-the- show\", or \"best-supporting actor\". If your base is really unique, choose a simple shade to draw attention to the special features of the lamp. If the base is simpler, the shade could stand out more both in color and shape.\n\nA properly fitted lampshade will match or compliment the lamp base in Size, Proportions, Shape, Style, and Color. Larger lamp bases will also require larger shades. The goal is to match to style, \"mood\" and design of the base, otherwise, your lamp might look like it `doesn't go together`.\n\nFloor Lamp Tip: Floor lamps are much taller than table lamps, typically a drum shade or `floor shade` with a slight slant usually looks best. Or if the base is somewhat curved then a bell shade may be suitable. Generally empire or coolie shades are less popular for floor lamps because they may tend not to be tall enough to balance the size of the base. Floor shades are also generally larger in order to keep within the proportions of the taller base.\n\nMatching with your furniture\n\nAs an extension of your lamp, consider the furniture it sits on or is near to. What shapes do you see there? What are the proportions like, as a whole and for individual parts?\n\nRectangular furniture: is likely to be best complemented by a more angular or rectangular shade\n\nSculptured rounded furniture: is likely to match best with a more rounded shade especially if the furniture has rounded corners\n\nProportions: Is the furniture wide and flat or tall and narrow? Consider how your lamp may complement or balance the shape\n\nDecor: Consider the rest of your room's theme. Think about the textures and colors and shapes that your lamp could tie into. Is there a strong color that you'd like to match or contrast with?\n\nChapter 4 How to attach a lamp shade\n\nA lamp shade needs to be attached to a lamp base and secured into place. This is usually done by:\n\nWire arms at the center of the shade frame sit on top of a \"lamp harp\", secured by a finial (a spider fitter)\n\nWire arms at the center of the shade drop down below the bulb and sit on the socket (an uno fitter)\n\nChoosing the right type and size of fitter for your lamp and shade is important.\n\nHere's how you can attach the shade.\n\nWhat is a fitter?\n\nA \"fitter\" is simply the way the shade connects to your lamp. Most lamps have \"spider\" fitters. Other common fitters include UNO or clip-on fitters. Check your existing lamp against the diagram and descriptions below to determine what type of fitter you need:\n\nHarp and Spider Fitters\n\nIf your lamp has a harp you will need a shade with a spider fitter.\n\nThe spider fitter is part of the lampshade itself. It sits on top of the harp and is secured by a finial.\n\nIf your new shade is not EXACTLY the same size as your old shade, a new harp may be all you need for a perfect fit.\n\nHarps typically vary from 7” to 12” and they affect the vertical position of your lampshade.\n\nIf you do not have a harp but wish to use a shade with a spider fitter you must also purchase a harp. Harps are made in different sizes, which affects the vertical position of the lampshade. The most common finial thread size for harps is 1/4\"-27.\n\nReflector Bowl Spider Fitters\n\nIf your lamp has a reflector bowl inside the shade, a reflector spider fitter may be needed to secure its position. These fitters feature grooves in the spider arms for the secure positioning of reflector bowl. Reflector bowls are not sold as part of the lamp shade - they are usually shipped with the lamp base.\n\nUNO Fitters\n\nIf your lamp requires an UNO fitter you must purchase a lamp shade that has an UNO fitter. The UNO fitter is built-in to the lampshade. There are two types of UNO fitters:\n\nSlip-UNO fitters\n\nSit on the socket and are held in place by the bulb.\n\nThreaded-UNO fitters\n\nTypically for down-bridge lamps and feature a screw thread for installation above the downward-facing bulb.\n\nClip-on Fitters\n\nClip-on lamp shades are typically for chandeliers. The clip fitter is built into the lamp shade and clips over a standard medium or candelabra bulb.\n\nChoosing the Right Drop Size\n\nShades with a spider-type or UNO-type fitter usually have some distance between the top edge of the shade down to the center of the fitter. This makes the fitting less visible when viewing the lamp from the side but does raise the position of the shade by the drop distance.\n\nShades with spider-type fitters typically feature a 1/2 to 1-inch drop.\n\nShades with a Slip-UNO fitter have several inches of the drop which varies per-shade since the fitter has to drop down to below the bulb.\n\nThreaded-UNO fitter shades typically feature a drop of 1 to 2 inches so as to conceal electrical attachments above the shade.\n\nA tall cylindrical lampshade will likely have a deeper drop than a regular shade, to accommodate the extended proportions and reach down to the lamp harp.\n\nLeaving room for Bulb Heat\n\nLight bulbs produce heat, no matter their wattage. If your new shade is too close to the bulb, it could discolor the shade or worse: start a fire! Here's how to avoid these problems and choose the right shade\n\nIf using a 40 or 60 Watt incandescent bulb, leave at least 1-2 inches between the bulb and the shade\n\nIf using a 75 or 100 Watt incandescent bulb, leave at least 2-3 inches between the bulb and the shade\n\nIf using a 150 Watt incandescent bulb or higher, leave at least 3-4 inches between the bulb and the shade\n\nIf using a compact fluorescent bulb, it will run cooler and requires less space - leave at least 1-2 inches around the bulb to be safe.\n\nIf using an LED bulb, it will run much cooler and requires even less space - leave at least 1-2 inches around the bulb just to be sure.\n\nNever exceed the maximum wattage. This could not only cause the shade to catch fire but could also cause an electrical fire.\n\nIf you are unsure about a replacement shade, choose a shade close in size and shape to your original shade\n\nBe sure the top of the shade is open to vent the heat. Never cover the top of your shade with a cloth or other material, especially with hotter bulbs, as it may cause the shade to overheat and the shade or cover may ignite. Remove the plastic from your new shade once you know you will keep it, as plastic can be prone to overheating as well.\n\nChapter 5 How to buy lamp shades online\n\nLamp shades can be easily ordered online and ship to your home or business safely.\n\nYou'll want to look for a source which:\n\nHas a good selection of sizes and styles\n\nHas good quality shade materials\n\nHas reasonable prices\n\nWe'll help you understand how much a lampshade typically costs and where you can find lamp shades online.\n\nHere's the lowdown.\n\nHow much do replacement lamp shades cost?\n\nBuying a new lamp shade for table lamps, floor lamps or light fixtures doesn't have to be expensive. After all, you probably already spent enough on the original lamp or light and would just like to add a lampshade or replace a missing or damaged one.\n\nReplacement lamp shades for regular-sized lamps typically range from $20 to $50, mostly depending on size. Large lamp shades tend to be more expensive. Small lamp shade for chandeliers and other mini lampshades cost much less, usually around $10 to $15.\n\nAt LampsUSA we've made significant efforts to reduce the price of lamp shades, in particular by manufacturing our own shades and reducing shipping costs.

Consult the section of this guide regarding how to measure a lamp shade for tips on what size shade you'll need depending on your lamp base size.\n\nGenerally you'll want to get an idea of the right \"size\" of lampshade you need first before you consider the shape or color, otherwise it won't have appropriate proportions and will look too big or small.\n\nOnce you have an idea of the size you may need, consider the shape of the lamp base to help you decide what kind of lamp shade to look for. See our section on How to match the shade shape to the lamp base for simple tips about matching the lamp shade shape to the style of the base. While it may be easy to just throw a typical empire shade onto your lamp, it will look better when the shape of the lampshade complements or balances or brings out the shape of the base.\n\nChapter 6 The practical benefits of lamp shades\n\nLamp shades do more than just sit there.\n\nThey actually provide a variety of services:\n\nProtect your eyes from glare from light bulbs\n\nDiffuse and color and soften light in the room\n\nFunnel heat away from the bulb\n\nShape and focus light for practical uses\n\nLet's take a deeper look at how different kinds of lampshades can be used for different purposes.\n\nHere we go.\n\nThe benefits of a replacement lamp shade\n\nLampshades provide a number of benefits for your room and for the people in your room.\n\nShields your eyes from the harsh glare of a light bulb\n\nDirects and focuses light in a way that you find most useful - e.g. as ambient light, or for reading purposes\n\nProvides a decorative element to complement your interior design and room theme\n\nFunnels heat away from the bulb\n\nAdds a color accent to your room\n\nWorks together with a lamp base or light fixture to position light where you need it\n\nFilters and diffuses or reflects light to change the mood of a room between soft and strong\n\nThe Practical Uses of Different Lampshades\n\nDifferent types of lampshades serve a different purpose. Besides shielding your eyes from the glare of a light bulb, their shape is not purely for decorative reasons. The correct shade greatly affects the kind of light the lamp gives off, as well as where that light is directed.\n\nDifferent types of lamp shades correlate to different functions for practical purposes, be it sitting nearby, at a distance, or as an ambient light source. If you are not as concerned about how the lamp assists you in your daily activities, you may prefer to make a choice purely for decorative reasons.\n\nEmpire lamp shades for table lamp provide a spread of light for a bedside desk as well as for reading in bed.\n\nA bell shade atop a floor lamp provides a maximum area of illumination for sitting beneath to read.\n\nA drum lamp shade on this pendant light, radiating strong and focused light downward over a dining table as well as illuminating the room with ambient light via the ceiling.\n\nBell lamp shades for table lamps provide a local spread of light for nearby seating.\n\nA pair of floor lamps with flat drum lamp shades prove strong ambient and local light for a softer mood.\n\nThe opaque drum lamp shade on this lamp provides a decorative, less functional ambient light over a narrow side-table.\n\nChapter 7 How lamp shades emit light\n\nNot all lampshades are alike. They come in a variety of different shapes for different purposes.\n\nThe shape of the shade and its material has a lot to do with:\n\nHow much the light spreads out above and below\n\nWhether light diffuses through the sides of the shade\n\nHow focused the light is in a local area\n\nThe decorative appearance of the shade\n\nIt's worth considering how your shade will light up an area.\n\nLet's take a look.\n\nHow Home Lamp Shades Affect the Light\n\nLight emits from different shaped shades in different ways, which affects how far the light is useful and for what purposes. Light emitting from the top of the shade produces a reflected ambient light bouncing off the ceiling, while light emitting below produces a more focused light surrounding furniture.\n\nAdditional light shines through the sides of the shade itself, whereby a white or light-colored shade allows the most light to pass through. Darker-colored shades and hardback shades tend to block more of the light.\n\nDrum lamp shades provide an medium spread of light from both ends\n\nAn empire shade provides most light from the bottom, the least from the top\n\nA bell shade provides a balance between light from the top and a wide spread of light from the bottom\n\nLight from Drum or Cylinder Lamp Shades\n\nDrum or cylinder lamp shades focus most of the light directly out through the top and bottom\n\nMay or may not emit light through the sides of the shade, depending on if it is hard-back/lined or not\n\nTaller cylinder shades create an even narrower funnel of light\n\nShallow drum shades can produce quite a wide spread of light depending on the angle between the bulb and the edges of the shade\n\nEmit roughly the same amount of light through the top and bottom, providing focused and ambient light\n\nIdeal over a table or on a tall floor lamp, or as a less functional table lamp\n\nLight from Empire or Coolie Lamp Shades\n\nWithempire shades, a flared bottom emits the most light, less from the top\n\nMaximizes the spread of light output through the bottom to the surrounding area\n\nStill covers the bulb enough to shield your eyes, but less suitable on a tall floor lamp since you may see the bulb when seated\n\nSince the light is more spread out, it is more diffused, meaning the intensity of light in any given point on furniture etc may be less\n\nWhile this shape produces more diffused light below, its amount is increased by having a narrower opening at the top\n\nLight from Bell Lamp Shades\n\nAbell shade attempts to keep more ambient light emitting from the top of the shade while also emphasizing light from the bottom\n\nA good tradeoff between a drum/cylinder shade and an empire/coolie shade\n\nUsually emits some light through the sides of the shade since bell shades are less often lined/hard-back due to difficulty of construction\n\nDiffuses light from the bottom by spreading the light out, possibly even more than an empire shade, making it more ambient while also reflecting ambient light from the ceiling\n\nThe combination of a non-lined bell shade emitting light through the sides of the shade, as well as a large amount of ambient light produced above and below, makes the bell shade in general a more ambient light source\n\nOther light sources in the room\n\nAlso consider also what other sources of light are in the room - if you have bright light from a main light fixture, your lamps may provide accent lighting, or mood lighting when used alone.\n\nIf you need them to be a primary light source for sitting and reading, opt for a more flared shape of shade such as empire/coolie, provided it complements the style of the base. Also consider a hard-backed shade for increasing the light output from below the shade.\n\nChapter 8 Soft and hard-backed lamp shades\n\nOften light will shine through the sides of a lamp shade if the material is not solid enough. This may or may not be desirable.\n\nShades can be lined with a soft or hard \"backing\" which:\n\nDiffuses light as it passes through, or\n\nBlocks light from passing through, directly all light out through the ends of the shade\n\nA hard-backed shade can focus maximum light out from below or above the shade\n\nKeep reading to learn more.\n\nA gold-lined black drum lamp shade reflects light within the shade and tints it a golden color.\n\nHard-backed lamp shades\n\nHard-backed Lampshades hold their shape either due to a hard lining or with the use of a metal framework. A `hard-backed` shade is typically lined with plastic or or other materials designed to prevent light from passing through the sides of the shade. The hard lining allows the shape of the shade to be quite firm and less likely to change over time. The firm backing is glued into place behind a more attractive outer material.\n\nBenefits of a hard-back shade\n\nMore of the light has to be reflected away from the interior surface (which is typically white or gold)\n\nMore of it will pass out through the top and bottom of the shade\n\nA hardback shade can maximize the amount of light emitted above and below the shade\n\nBrightens the overall perceived light output\n\nHelpful when the wattage of the bulb is quite high and the light is bright, to shield your eyes when viewing the lamp from the side, yet harnessing the light output from below\n\nUseful when you are using the surrounding light output for practical purposes, such as reading or other activities.\n\nRequire less supportive hardware in order to maintain the shape of the shade\n\nReflective surface may be tinted gold which will influence the color of the light output, making it warmer\n\nA hard-back shade reflects maximum light from beneath the shade while shielding your eyes.\n\nSide-Effects of a hard-back shade\n\nLight is blocked from passing through the sides of the shade\n\nThe shade itself does not appear to illuminate as much when the lamp is switched on.\n\nReflective surface, if tinted gold, will change the color of the light, which may be undesirable\n\nMay cost a little more to ship to you since the shade has to ship fully assembled to maintain its shape\n\nFocuses light strongly so does not provide as much diffused ambient light, but a hard-backed drum shade can maximize ambient lighting\n\nSoft-Back Lamp Shades\n\nA soft-back shade does not have a firm lining, although it may still potentially be lined. The lining, however, would be flexible, such as a linen or paper, and so does not provide support for maintaining the shape of the lampshade. As a result, soft-back or `un-backed` shades require additional vertical supports between the bottom and top of the shade to maintain shape.\n\nThis soft-backed drum lamp shade emits light through the shade itself, for a softer light, and reveals a textured pattern in the shade material.\n\nBenefits of a softer shade\n\nAllows light to pass through the sides of the shade\n\nThe shades are usually lighter in color to allow more light to escape\n\nThe closer the shade is to white the less it will absorb parts of the light spectrum, and thus allows more light to pass through\n\nA softer shade illuminates the room partly through a diffused light passing through the shade itself, and so less light bounces around inside the shade to be emitted from the top and bottom, resulting in a softer light\n\nWell suited for general ambient illumination as well as some focused light below the shade, thus multi-purpose\n\nGiven it is structured by a metal framework, that framework can bedesigned to be collapsible, which may reduce shipping costs\n\nAllows for the use of attractive textures and patterns or multiple colors which show up as the light emanates through the shade material\n\nPermits the use of interesting materials which might not be as effective when the shade does not emit light through the sides, such as paper, linen, certain fabrics or textured materials\n\nSide-Effects of a softer shade\n\nMetal supports can tend to show up as shadows or darkened areas showing through the shade when the light is switched on\n\nMetal structure blocks the light a little and has some potential to become distorted if damaged\n\nThe presence of the metal frame may cause a slight local distortion in the shape of the shade, since fabrics and other materials may tend to dip inward in-between the supports\n\nWhile the metal framework around the top and bottom of the shade maintain a perfect shape, toward the center of the shade the shape may be slightly less than perfect\n\nSince light passes through the shade, the bulb can at least partly be seen and there may be some degree of brightness when viewing from the side\n\nGenerally not so common in darker colors, since the aim it so allow light to pass through and light is blocked more as the material absorbs color\n\nChapter 9 Popular lampshade shapes\n\nA variety of lamp-shade shapes are available to suit any lamp, although the design of the lamp base may influence which shade looks best.\n\nLamp shade shapes include:\n\nCylinder (tall), Drums (wide)\n\nBell (curved), Empire (straight-edged) and Coolie (flattened)\n\nSquare, Rectangular and Oval shades\n\nWe will explore the various types of lamp shades available.\n\nLet's get started.\n\nLearn about the types of lamp shades with this video\n\nNow let's take a look at the main lamp shade shapes, so you can get an idea of what may be available or which shape might suit your lamp or light fixture.\n\nCylinder lamp shades\n\nCylinder-shaped lamp shades are taller than they are wide, with vertical straight sides. These tall shades are best for unusually tall lamp bases, or floor lamps. They funnel equal amounts of light out of the top and bottom without spreading the light outwards, producing a large amount of ambient reflected light.\n\nBecause they are so much taller than wide, their proportions look good on narrow lamp bases. Their very open-ended nature maximizes the amount of light output.\n\nDrum lamp shades\n\nDrum-shaped shades are similar to cylinder shades except they are flatter, typically wider than they are tall, similar to a musical drum. Drum shades look good on a variety of table lamps and floor lamps, but also can be suited to pendant light fixtures. With vertical sides, maximum light emits through the top and bottom of the drum shade producing ambient reflected light in the room.\n\nWhen used in an overhead pendant it provides ample light output for visual clarity. On a table lamp the drum shade gives a contemporary, modern look. A drum shade is well suited to a lamp base with wide proportions. Being open-ended allows a maximum amount of light to be released through both ends of the shade.\n\nFloor-Lamp lamp shades\n\nFloor lamps typically require a slightly larger shade than table lamps. Also due to the height of the lamp, they tend to look better with a drum or floor-style shade. A floor shade is almost a drum shade, except the sides are slightly slanted. This shape complements the proportions of the floor lamp.\n\nA floor shade distributes light out through the bottom with a slight spread, illuminating a larger area around the lamp base. Similarly, the top of the floor shade is less open, slightly restricting the amount of ambient reflected light shining out through the top. Often a floor lamp is located near to a seating area and thus provides a cone of light which can extend at least partly across the furniture. Floor lamps, in general, provide a large amount of light close to functional spaces.\n\nEmpire lamp shades\n\nEmpire-shaped lampshades strike a balance between slanted sides and visually-appealing proportions. These straight-sided shades are found commonly on many table lamps and some floor lamps. The narrower opening at the top is still large enough to vent heat from the light bulb, yet allows the bottom of the shade to flare more in order to spread light outwards.\n\nThis wider cone of light illuminates a wider area beneath and to the sides of the lamp, providing a hotspot of local light ideal for reading and other activities. Since most of the light is cast downwards, there is less ambient light reflected off the ceiling and more light spread outward near to seating areas or top of furniture. Empire shades are popular lamp shades for table lamps.\n\nCoolie lamp shades\n\nA coolie lamp shade features a very wide spread of light, since the top of the shade is very narrow and the bottom very open. The sides of the coolie shade are heavily slanted. Coolie shades tend to be flatter (less height) due to the proportions of the shape.\n\nThe coolie shade restricts ambient light emitting from the top of the shade, while maximizing the amount of light spreading out from the bottom. The shape of the shade also directs the light to spread as widely as possible to the sides of the shade for maximum coverage. This can be useful when your lamp is serving to illuminate tasks or projects or for reading.\n\nBell-curved lamp shades\n\nThe bell shade is very popular and provides an elegant, relaxed shape. The sides of the shade curve inwards producing a shape that resembles a `bell`. The flare at the bottom helps to distribute light outwards for maximum coverage, while the top of the shade remains quite wide to help facilitate the escape of heat and ambient light.\n\nThe bell shade is well suited to table lamps with a more curved base shape. Empire lampshades are popular lamp shade for table lamps to use.\n\nOval lamp shades\n\nWith an oval-shaped shade, looking down on the shade from above reveals an oval shape rather than a perfect circle. The shade wider than it is deep, front-to-back. An oval or flatter style of lamp base goes well with it. It can help to situate a lamp on a narrower piece of furniture closer to a wall without extruding into the room, helping to ensure the lamp will not be knocked over by passers by.\n\nOval shades are less common but look good when their shape complements the shape of the base. An oval shade may have an oval profile from the top, while having any of the other shapes when viewed from the side, such as an oval bell, an oval empire, an oval drum etc.\n\nSquare lamp shades\n\nSquare and rectangle-shaped shades complement a lamp base which is very rectangular in appearance. Suited mainly to contemporary modern lamps, they work well with floor lamps and table lamps. The rectangular shade has flat edges rather than circular edges, and thus produces corners. Some varieties of square shade also feature a 'cut corner' as a decorative modification to its shape.\n\nSquare or rectangular shades are most obvious when viewed from above or at an angle, but from the side may feature a bell shape (pagoda), drum shape, or empire shape. Rectangular or square shades with a very narrow or no opening in the top may be thought of as a pyramid shade.\n\nHexagonal and Octagonal lamp shades\n\nUnusual-shaped shades include Hexagon and Octagon Lampshades, with 6 or 8 flat sides. A little more extreme than simply a cut-cornered square shade, these shades feature equal-length edges around the top and bottom of the shade.\n\nThis design is more for visual appeal and functions similarly to most other shades depending on the side profile of the shape. These could be bell or empire or drum shades which, when viewed from above or below, reveal a hexagonal or octagonal shape. These shape shades are much less commonplace than most other types.\n\nTiffany stained glass lamp shades\n\nLouis Tiffany created the Tiffany Lamp, featuring metal or soldered structures with hundreds of pieces of colored glass. These intricate designs produce a heavy, long-lasting attractive shade. Tiffany shades come in all kinds of shapes and sizes and designs. Since the shade can be constructed piece-by-piece, they often exhibit unusual shapes and beautiful colors not found in typical lamp shades.\n\nUsually a tiffany shade is specifically designed to match a fit to a particular lamp base, so finding a replacement usually entails contacting the manufacturer of the original lamp. Tiffany shades tend to also be quite expensive, although for a reason - their magnificent beauty when lit makes them a family treasure. Tiffany shades can be found on floor lamps, accent lamps, desk lamps, table lamps, and even a wide variety of tiffany light fixtures.\n\nArt-Glass lamp shades\n\nArt-glass is a special kind of toughened glass designed to be lighter and less fragile than real or tiffany glass. Lamps with an art-glass shade make a bold statement. Commonly a single piece of art glass is used in a very unique hand-crafted shape. Since art-glass can be molded into endless shapes, it can be manipulated to resemble flowers, animals or even traditional shade shapes with unusual edge designs.\n\nIn addition to the shape, art-glass shades feature extraordinary patterns of vibrant color, with swirls of multiple hues mixed in. While art-glass lamps are readily available, finding replacement glass shades is less simple - usually through contacting the manufacturer of the original lamp, since each piece is so uniquely specific to the lamp itself.\n\nMini Chandelier lamp shades\n\nChandelier light fixtures feature multiple arms extending outward with individual light bulbs at the ends. Rather than be blinded by dazzling light, the bulbs are typically shielded with small lamp shades. These small lamp shades are just large enough to cover the light bulb with little extra.\n\nChandelier shades come in as many varieties of shape and design and color as for lamps. A typical chandelier may feature 4 to 6 or even 9 bulbs, and so replacing a complete set of ceiling light shades can give your chandelier a completely new look.\n\nChapter 10 Popular lampshade colors\n\nWhile lamp shades come in almost every color, certain colors are more popular than others.\n\nIn particular these colors are best-suited to most lamps and room decor:\n\nWhite, Off-White or Eggshell\n\nBlack\n\nBeige, Tan or Brown\n\nLet's dive into the various lamp shade colors and find out what color may be right for your lamp.\n\nHere's the breakdown.\n\nCommon Lampshade Colors\n\nLampshades feature a wide spectrum of colors to suit almost any lamp base and environment. You will likely want to complement the base of the lamp by choosing a lamp shade color that is either understated (as to let the lamp base be featured), or to make the shade a focal point (e.g. with a more understated base). It's also possible to strike a balance between the two components, for example picking up colors in the base to bring out with the shade - similar to how you bring out the color of your eyes.\n\nBlack Lamp Shades\n\nA black lamp shade can allow a lamp to be understated but also gives your lamp and air of sophistication, and can also be quite a modern look. Sleek black shades might match your black furniture or act as a balance against white or brightly colored elements in the room. Explore some black lamp shades.\n\nWhite Lamp Shades\n\nA white lamp shade similarly can give your lamp a look of elegance and sophistication especially allowing the lamp base to be featured if it is colorful or interesting. White shades are clean and purifying, and may reflect upon white elements in the room or act as a canvas for other colors you wish to feature. Explore some examples of white lamp shades.\n\nCream Lamp Shades\n\nCream lamp shades are a classic. Not so pure as to be white, but somewhat softened and warming. A cream lamp shade will match well to many lamp base designs and colors especially more classically or traditionally styled lamps. Sometimes cream includes off-white or egg-shell which are more neutral or reddish tones. Explore some examples of cream lamp shades.\n\nBeige Lamp Shades\n\nBeige is all the rage. A beige lamp shade suits many modern homes where beige and browns provide a soft, comforting and nurturing environment. Beige shades can complement well with brown furniture or perhaps a beige couch. Often a beige lamp shade will complement a fancy decorated lamp base well. Explore some examples of beige lamp shades.\n\nBrown Lamp Shades\n\nBrown lamp shades add a darker, comforting warmth to a room. A brown shade can complement a more decorative lamp base of many colors or a more plain design. With a brown shade, you can pick up on the browns in your furniture or textiles in the room. Explore some examples of brown lamp shades.\n\nGray Lamp Shades\n\nA gray lamp shade is unusual but may strike a modern compromise between elegance and understated charm. If your lamp base is silver or clear or perhaps strongly colors, a gray shade can provide a neutral accent allowing the lamp base to be featured. See some examples of gray or silver lamp shades.\n\nRed Lamp Shades\n\nBelieve it or not, red lamp shades are one of the most searched-for colors on the internet. A red shade would likely highlight warmer tones in a lamp base or be a striking statement against an understated lamp base. Red shades might just highlight your favorite color ro pick up red or warm accents in the room. Explore some examples of red lamp shades.\n\nOrange Lamp Shades & Yellow Lamp Shades\n\nOrange or yellow lamp shades are not typically as popular as a color choice, since yellow tends to be quite a bright color which will stand out in a room. You'd probably pick an orange lamp shade or yellow lamp shade if it particularly matched the lamp in some way or is part of your room's color scheme. Explore some examples of orange and yellow lamp shades.\n\nGreen Lamp Shades\n\nGreen lamp shades also are one of the less popular colors for a lamp, mainly because green is quite a distinct color and tends not to be featured in lamp bases. Green shades may however complement a green or earth-toned or natural theme in your room and could complement a natural-toned lamp base well. Explore some examples of green lamp shades.\n\nBlue Lamp Shades\n\nAdd a blue lamp shade to your table lamp or floor lamp and you're instantly into making a cool statement. Blue is actually one of the most searched-for- colors of lampshades online, perhaps due to the relative rarity of blue coloring in nature in general. A blue shade will likely look quite contemporary and give your lamp a deliberate, designer look. Pair it with a lamp with blue in the base or perhaps white or black. Explore some examples of blue lamp shades.\n\nPurple Lamp Shades and Pink Lamp Shades\n\nYes, pink is in. And purple too. Pink lamp shade are quite sought after and perhaps this is due to the fact that many people replacing lampshades are women. It may be a stereotype, but yes, women do seem to like to buy pink shades. And some men too, of course. A pink shade would look great on a white or gray or perhaps red or pink lamp base. Perhaps a pink or purple lamp shadewould look great in a girls' bedroom. Explore some examples of pink lamp shades and purple lamp shades.\n\nChapter 11 Lamp Shade Glossary of Terms\n\nKnowing what all the parts of a lamp shade are can be confusing.\n\nSuch terms as parchment, gallery and fitter can seem meaningless until you see it spelled out.\n\nTo follow is an extensive list of common terms used to describe parts of lamp shades.\n\nRead on.\n\nGlossary (Alphabetical)\n\nCoolie Shade\n\nSimple designed straight-sided shades that usually feature a bottom width 3-4 times larger than the top, resulting in a shade that emits most of the light from the bottom.\n\nDrop\n\nDistance from the top of the shade to the center of the fitter.\n\nDrum/Cylinder Shades\n\nDrum and cylinder shades typically feature vertical or near-vertical sides and differ mainly in their proportions. Drum shades tend to be wider and cylinder shades tend to be taller. In some cases the difference between them is hard to distinguish - a tall drum shade may be similar to a short cylinder shade.\n\nEmpire Shades\n\nSimple designed straight-sided shade that usually feature a bottom about twice as wide as the top.\n\nFaux Leather\n\nAn artificial shade fabric with a texture similar to leather often accented with real or faux leather stitching.\n\nFinial\n\nAn ornamental decoration made of ceramic, metal, stone, crystal, wood, etc. used to securely fasten the lampshade to the harp. Finials often attach to a 1/4\"-27 thread.\n\nFitters\n\nThe metal structure that attaches the shade to the lamp base. The most common type is the Spider Fitter which resembles a spoked wheel and connects to a harp with a finial. A Clip-On Fitter features metal loops allowing the shade to attach on top of the bulb. Larger clip-on shades are designed to attach directly to a standard Edison bulb, while smaller chandelier shades have smaller loops to fit a candelabra bulb. An Uno Fitter is designed with a larger center opening which fits snugly into the socket. Slip Uno Fitters feature a large drop and rest on the socket of a table lamp. Threaded Uno Fitters actually screw on to the socket so it can hang downward, typically on down-bridge floor lamps.\n\nFlecks/Nubbly texture\n\nA feature of the thread used to make a lamp shade, where sections of the thread are thicker or more frayed than others. When woven into a lamp shade this produces areas that are a different texture or color. This added dimension of texture is usually most visible when the light is shining through the shade. The degree of flecks ranges greatly from subtle to eccentric. Some shades will feature a second thread for the purposes of adding texture and dimension. Silk and Shantung shades often feature natural flecks or nubbly areas.\n\nFloor/Empire/Coolie Shades\n\nSlope-sided shades of varying degrees. Floor shades feature steep sides. Empire shades feature a medium slope and are typically in proportion for table lamps. Coolie shades feature the most gradual slope with a smaller top diameter and wider base, ideal for particular styles of lamps.\n\nFrame\n\nThe metal structure of a lamp shade which maintains its shape and extends toward the center of the shade in the form of a fitter. The fitter is a part of the frame and in many cases is the only visible part of the frame. The frame is often outlined covered by a trim. Some lamps ship with a collapsible-frame shade where the vertical struts collapse and can be locked in place upon installation, re-expanding the shade.\n\nGallery\n\nA vertical/flat band around the top and/or bottom edge of a lamp shade. This can take the form of tassels, beads, crystals, loops, braids, rope, lace or an extension of the main shade. The gallery is usually vertical and sometimes moves freely, but at rest forms a band around the shade, as if a `viewing gallery` or `decorative wall` around the shade. Sometimes a shade will feature a gallery or band around the top of the shade.\n\nGimp\n\nA form of braid used to accent the edges of a lampshade. The gimp may also be referred to as braiding, rope, cord or other decorative terms. Popular gimp styles feature a figure eight pattern.\n\nHardback\n\nA stiff backing applied to the inner surface of a lamp shade to keep its shape over time. During the creation of a hardback lampshade, the fabric is laminated over a stiff but bendable backing material, typically a plastic such as a styrene. The hard backing helps the shade to keep its form, prevents drooping or warping, and extends the life of the shade. With a hardback shade it often becomes unnecessary to use extra metal framework running between the top and bottom of the shade, since the backing maintains the shape. This removes the shadows or blocks to light caused by the presence of vertical framework showing through the shade.\n\nHarp\n\nA vertical U-Shaped metal support used to attach the shade to the lamp base. Harps are typically 6-12” high. Changing the size of the harp often helps your shade fit better. Harp threads are often 1/4\"-27.\n\nJacquard\n\nA leaf-like scroll pattern that is printed or embossed into a fabric, used to make a lampshade. `Jacquard` is a classic design having been used for many centuries. Jacquard shades feature leafy-scrolling patterns.\n\nLamp Base\n\nThe actual body, typically made of crystal, brass, ceramic, resin, stone, etc. The base is wired with a socket and cord.\n\nLampshade\n\nDecorative covering, usually fabric, used to diffuse and direct the light from the bulb. A properly chosen shade will enhance the base and bring out its best features without competing with it for attention. (The life of the party can also use it as a hat late on a wild evening.)\n\nLining\n\nAn additional surface applied to the inside of a lamp shade, used to filter or reflect light. A reflective lining such as gold or silver helps to reflect light away from the shade surface and focuses it out of the top and bottom. This keeps the outer appearance of the shade the same color and tone as when the light is off. This is useful for dark or black shades that you want to stay dark-looking even when the lamp is on. It also prevents the shade from absorbing some of the light, increasing overall light output. A reflective lining also hides the appearance of a bright-spot from the light bulb, as seen through the shade. Other types of lining include plastic, linen and other fabrics, each with its own degree of diffusing and reflecting light. Some linings allow some light through while also increasing the output through the top and bottom of the shade.\n\nPiping/Ribbing\n\nVertical pipes of material running up the outside edge of a lamp shade. Piping is a hollow pipe made of fabric, usually flattened and applied to the shade surface, but sometimes also made from braids or solid tubes. The piping accentuates the shape of the shade particularly in areas that are flat and void of features. A shade with piping typically features several pipes arranged evenly around the shade, or spaced attractively. Piping can conceal joins in the underlying shade surface and can create surface tension to help maintain the shape of a shade over time.\n\nPleated\n\nWhere the shade fabric folds back on itself creating a pleat. There are many forms of pleating creating different patterns, pleat sizes, edging and shapes. Sometimes the top and bottom of the side of the shade is stitched into place creating flat pleats, while the pleats may also proceed all the way to the top and bottom creating a sawtooth edge. Pleats can form straight lines or fan designs.\n\nReflector Bowl\n\nAn open-top bowl usually in the shape of a hemisphere and often made of frosted, opaque or colored glass. It sits on the socket along with the harp and causes the light to be deflected, diffused and reflected upwards. The glass is usually frosted/opaque to diffuse the light through the sides of the shade and to direct most of the light toward the ceiling for indirect lighting. It also disguises the bright center of the light bulb to reduce glare and present a more `even` light. Ridges on the reflector spider fitter allows the top of the shade be centered over the bowl and kept from slipping. Reflector bowls usually come with the lamp base.\n\nRiser\n\nA small metal cylinder used to raise the shade. Usually, 1-2”, a riser screws into the top of the harp and the shade sits on the riser and the finial screws on top of the riser. Risers are an alternative to changing the harp to properly fit your shade.\n\nScalloped\n\nThe variegated contour of the top and/or bottom edge of a lamp shade. The shape of the scallop suggests the shade material is draped and hanging. Scalloped edges are often offset by fancy trims, tassels, and beads.\n\nShantung\n\nA heavy lamp shade fabric with a rough nubby surface, made of spun wild silk, rayon or cotton. Non-silk shantung is intended to be an imitation of silk.\n\nSlant Height\n\nThe measurement from the outermost tip of the top edge of a lamp shade, to the outermost tip of the bottom edge, on a diagonal and in a straight line. We use the slant height to describe the `height` (length of the side) of the shade. The slant height is easily measured outside the shade, even when the shade is installed, and should be measured in a straight line regardless of any curvature in the shape of the shade. Bell shades are just as easily measured, measuring in a straight line from top to bottom, ignoring the curved surface. (Since most shades do not have vertical sides, it is difficult to get an accurate vertical measurement, usually requires the shade to be removed from the lamp. It is easier and more intuitive to measure the outside of the shade on the slant from top to bottom.)\n\nSquare/Rectangular/Hexagonal/Oval Shades\n\nThe shape of a lamp shade when viewed from above or below is typically a circle, but can be other shapes. Oval shades are popular and are wider than they are deep, requiring two diameter measurements for both the top and the bottom to describe their shape. An oval shade adds an extra dimension to your lamp. Shades are also found with square perimeters, rectangles, hexagons, indented/cut-corners and many other styles.\n\nSocket\n\nMetal receptacle at the top of the lamp base that holds the bulb and usually contains the switch. A slip-UNO fitter or a harp generally sits beneath the socket.\n\nTrim\n\nThe way that a lampshade is finished and the surface contained around the top and bottom edges of the shade. The trim creates a more pleasing profile, conceals the edges of the main shade materials, highlights the shape of the shade and buffers the edges of the shade against knocks or damage. The trim also hides the metal frame of the lampshade which runs around the edges of the shade. Some shades such as certain types of pleated shades may not have any trim at all, to show off their jagged edges.\n\nChapter 12 What to do next\n\nNow that you have a better idea of what type of shade is right for you, you're ready to start looking at some actual lamp shades.\n\nTake a look at our collection of lamp shades to see if we have the right shade for you.
