        "text": "We love a good police drama (still thinking about Line of Duty tbh), and our latest obsession is series two of BBC's Blue Lights. The six-part drama is set in Belfast, and follows the lives of three probationary police officers taking on the tough task of being a response officer.\n\nSeries one dropped last April, and we've waited patiently to binge watch season two which is all available on iPlayer FYI. And given we may or may not have raced all the way to the end of the series, we, and many other viewers, are desperate to know if there will be another season of this tense police drama.\n\nSo is Blue Lights getting a season three? Here's all the exciting details you need to know.\n\nIs there going to be a season 3 of Blue Lights?\n\nGood news guys, a third and fourth season of Blue Lights has already been confirmed!\n\nBefore series two began earlier this month, back in February 2024, the BBC confirmed we'd be getting two more series of the show. Just like seasons one and two, both seasons three and four will have six episodes each.\n\nThe series writers Declan Lawn and Adam Patterson expressed their delight at two further series, saying: \"We’re thrilled that the BBC is committing to Blue Lights in this way. From the beginning, we wanted to write a show that had scale and ambition in its storytelling, and this decision gives us everything we need to do that. Thanks to the BBC, to Two Cities/STV and Gallagher Films, and to our brilliant cast and crew. But most of all thanks to our audience who have responded so powerfully to the show. Time for us to get to work!”\n\nWho will be in the cast of Blue Lights season 3?\n\nRight now, the official cast for seasons three and four of Blue Lights are yet to be confirmed. Depending on how season two wraps up, we'd at least expect the main cast members to return.\n\nSo at the very least we'd expect a season three cast to include Siân Brooke as Grace Elli, Katherine Devlin as Annie Conlon and Nathan Braniff as Tommy Foster. But we'll be sure to update you when we get more info.\n\nWhen does Blue Lights season 3 begin filming?\n\nAs of yet there's been no official word on when the next season will go into production. However, if we look at the past seasons we can get a better idea.\n\nAfter season two was confirmed to be going ahead in April 2023, filming then began in the summer of 2023 and the show landed on the BBC this April 2024.\n\nGiven this timeline, we can probably expect season three to begin filming in the next few months, with a hopeful April 2025 release date.\n\nBlue Lights seasons one to two are available on BBC iPlayer now"
