The lights will always flicker when it is near.\n\nWhenever this happens, find a hiding spot!\n\nKicked out by Hide\n\nWhat a predicament... You died to Rush, because you couldn't hide. Remember, you only have to hide once Rush is near. First Greenhouse Death\n\nYou died to Rush... In the Greenhouse, there are no lights that can flicker.\n\nTherefore, you can only rely on sound.\n\nSecond Greenhouse Death\n\nYou died to Rush... In these rooms, there are no lights that can flicker.\n\nListen closely for Rush and stay near hiding spots.\n\nTrapped by Snare\n\nWhat a predicament... You died to Rush, because you were stuck. That was Snare who trapped you. You'll need a light source to scan for them. Hide You died to Hide...

It lurks in dark rooms.\n\nIt will almost never attack you if you're holding a light source.\n\nHowever, if you suspect that it is around, look for it and stare it down.\n\nSeek Obstacles\n\nYou were caught by Seek... The obstacles have crawlspaces. Crouch into them! My lights shall guide you. First Death\n\nYou seem to have gotten lost, and died to Seek... Look both ways before you progress! Second Death\n\nYou died to Seek again... Remember. Look both ways very quickly!\n\nI know it may seem hard but trust me, you will get the hang of this!\n\nFake doors never have a sign. Remember this as you check the doors!\n\nThird Death\n\nYou seem to have gotten lost again... You must look both ways very quickly.\n\nIf you do not see the real door on neither the left or right, it must be the door ahead.\n\nEnd Hallway\n\nYou almost made it! Don't waste any time. You'll need it all! Hands\n\nYou were almost there! Stay away from the hands next time. Fallen Chandeliers\n\nYou almost made it! Stay away from the fallen chandeliers. They will burn you.

Ambush and Hide prove to be a tricky duo.\n\nRemember; you don't have to hide when Ambush is away!\n\nSecond time kicked out by Hide\n\nYou couldn't hide from Ambush again. I know it may seem difficult, but trust me, you will get the hang of this! You will need to hop in and out of your hiding spot. Figure First Death\n\nYou died to who you call the Figure... It cannot see, but it will use sounds and vibrations to its advantage. Second Death\n\nYou died to the Figure again... It may be blind, but its other senses far surpass yours.\n\nIf you have to walk near it, do so while crouching!\n\nThird Death\n\nYou died to the Figure yet again.
