        "text": "Featuring ‘The Blue Lamp Suite’ by Richard Ingham and a further three tracks, this album was recorded in the Blue Lamp just before lockdown. Thanks to Aberdeen City Council Creative Fund for enabling us to commission the suite and record this album. Huge thanks to the dearly missed Sandy Brown, who sadly passed away recently and is missed by all throughout Scotland in the jazz and wider musical community."
