        "text": "The Blue Lamp celebrated its 70th Anniversary in November 2019. For this entire period, it has been in the ownership of the Brown family.\n\n​\n\nFor much of our life, The Blue Lamp has been a focal point and hub for Aberdeen’s folk music scene (as well as for many other genres, cultural events and clubs).\n\nIt is a true folk bar; a no-pretence bar of the people. Resting gently just on the edge of the city centre, it’s a place where the lost can be found and those that find it can get lost in the music.\n\n​\n\nThe 70-year-old public bar (and small function room upstairs which opened in the 1960s) has played host to live music (formal and sessions) for most of its life. The “big room” opened in 1989, now having hosted thousands of live music events over 30 years and you would be hard pushed to find any prominent Scottish folk musician who has not performed, session-ed, heard-of or had a drink and a joke within its walls.\n\n​\n\nBeyond the folk and trad scene – including one of the longest running folk clubs in Scotland – the Blue Lamp is home to Jazz Scotland (Aberdeen). The extensive list of musicians, groups, bands, ceilidhs, promoters, festivals, clubs, University societies, comedy nights and charity events is too long to name in its entirety.\n\n​\n\nThe richness of its cultural offering draws and engages local, national, and international musicians and audiences.\n\n​\n\n​We serve a fine array of Beers, Wines, Spirits and Cocktails in an atmospheric, Candle lit, environment.\n\n​\n\nNot only do we play host to live music and comedy shows, we are available to hire for all kinds of functions. Whether that be retirement parties, wakes, birthday parties, rehearsals, quizzes, charity nights, wedding receptions, student events, filming, and many more. Get in touch to find out how we can assist you!"
