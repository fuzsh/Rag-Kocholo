For this entire period, it has been in the ownership of the Brown family.\n\nFor much of our life, The Blue Lamp has been a focal point and hub for Aberdeen’s folk music scene, but beyond the folk and trad scene – including one of the longest running folk clubs in Scotland – the Blue Lamp is home to Jazz Scotland (Aberdeen). The extensive list of musicians, groups, bands, ceilidhs, promoters, festivals, clubs, University societies, comedy nights and charity events is too long to name in its entirety.\n\n​\n\nWe serve a fine array of Beers, Wines, Spirits and Cocktails in an atmospheric, Candle lit, environment.\n\n​"
