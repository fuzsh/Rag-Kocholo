        "text": "What Can a Wood's Lamp Exam Diagnose?\n\nA Wood's lamp can diagnose a variety of conditions, including:\n\nTinea capitis. Tinea capitis is a fungal infection that causes areas of baldness and scaling. The fungal species that cause tinea capitis look blue-green or dull blue under the Wood's lamp. Fungal infections caused by other species don't show up.Â\n\nVitiligo. Vitiligo is a skin disease where the skin loses its color in patches. Melanin produces skin color. Vitiligo occurs in areas where cells that produce melanin die or stop functioning. A Wood's lamp can identify affected areas in light-skinned people. These areas will have sharper borders under black light and will look bright blue-white or yellow-green.Â\n\nRingworm. Like tinea capitis, ringworm, or tinea corporis, is a skin infection caused by a fungus. It's a red, itchy, circular rash that gets its name from its appearance. There are no worms involved.\n\nPorphyria. Porphyria is a group of eight inherited disorders that affect the skin and nervous system. People with porphyria that affects the skin are often sensitive to sunlight and may have abrasions and blisters on their skin. Under a Wood's lamp, porphyria shows up as red-pink.Â\n\nPigment disorders. A Wood's lamp can detect other changes in your skin's pigmentation besides vitiligo. Hypopigmentation, or loss of pigmentation, can be difficult to see in fair-skinned people. Under a Wood's lamp, areas of hypopigmentation have sharper borders and show up as bright blue-white. Hyperpigmentation, which has more melanin than normal, also shows up with sharper borders under a Wood's lamp because areas with more melanin absorb more light.Â\n\nPityrosporum folliculitis. This is an infection of the hair follicles caused by yeast. It's normally on the upper back and chest. Because it can look like acne, it can be difficult to diagnose. Under a Wood's lamp, it will look yellow-green.Â"
