It was because she wanted a focus for her store, and tales of crime and intrigue are a “safe harbour” for her.\n\nPopular interest in mystery isn’t anything new, and Hollingshead-Rumsey has the first-edition Agatha Christies and late 19th century copies of Strand Magazine to prove it.\n\nBut she does think there’s a renewed interest in the genre. She attributes some of that to recent translations that have made stories by international authors available in English for the first time, citing works from Germany, South Africa and across Scandinavia. And when a book series gets made into a television show, it buoys interest in the original texts.\n\nShe also suspects there’s an escapist element — a desire to see goodness prevail in the aftermath of evildoings.\n\n“Yes there’s terrible, horrific things that happen, but in the end justice is done, and that I think helps people get through some difficult times,” she said.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Sometimes people need that when there’s questionable things going on in the world.”\n\nHollingshead-Rumsey said when she fulfilled her dream of opening a bookstore in an era of Amazon, she wasn’t particularly apprehensive about the move.\n\n“I’d like to say that I was, and that I gave it a lot of thought, but no I just barrelled ahead,” she said.\n\nShe said the strength of a local bookshop is in the experience it offers: it’s a place for “book people” to meet, to exchange recommendations, and to form community.\n\nThough she carries some new books, about 90 per cent of her stock is used. She likes to recommend books by local authors, but she has acquired much of her collection on her travels, picking up one or two titles at a time. Sometimes she’ll purchase a collection from someone who is downsizing, or from the estate of a mystery-lover who has since died.\n\nHollingshead-Rumsey has a passion for museums, and likes to treat her store like a gallery, interspersing curiosities with the books. A special stash of pulp fiction, with colourful and sometimes lurid cover art, is cheekily displayed in a closet, and a throne that her grandfather used to keep in his downtown photo studio found a home in one of the shop’s corners.\n\nHer favourite part about running the shop is helping people who come in with lists of their favourites find new things to read, and she loves learning about new authors from her customers. Her personal favourite type of mystery is the classic British police procedural, but even she needs a palate cleanser now and then, and so she turns to “cozies.”\n\n“Those are kinder, gentler mysteries. They always say the murder takes place, the peril takes place, offstage, and then it’s simply the figuring out thereafter,” she said.\n\npparsons@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/paigeeparsons\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
