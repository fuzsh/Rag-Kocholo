The blue lamp of the title is a blue Tiffany lamp that Stevie's mothergave her. I think this song is a tribute to that unconditional parentallove that puts up with all the attitude and defiance of the child andcontinues in spite of it. In the first verse, Stevie talks about when timeswere hard, and she couldn't find light anywhere else, that "blue light"was still there, representing the constant of her mother's love.

In the second verse, sheadmits that when she first got the lamp, shedidn't appreciate it...she"was too proud" - she didn't need hermother's love, she could make iton her own, her mother shouldgive a gift like that to an idealized "Christmas angel." Shedidn'trealize she needed a "guardian" - and with all the stuff that guardianhas to put up with, if she was "wiser [she] would get out" and just quit.It would be less painful that way, but that doesn't matter to her mother,she'll always be there for her.

Hollywood is full of stars and big oldhouses, but they don't offer truehappiness. Her mother gave her the"freedom" to be herself, and thelight will continue to shine - "thelove remains."

Note: The entire section from "downstairs, the big old house is mine" to "the stars still laugh and they cry and they shine" is repeated in Welcome to the Room....Sara.
