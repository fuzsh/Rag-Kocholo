        "text": "Are you looking for the perfect place in Pennsylvania for your next tv/film production or photo shoot? Buffalo Bill’s House offers a rare opportunity for on-location filming in the real home used in the Academy Award winning film, “The Silence of the Lambs”. This three-story Queen Anne Victorian was the home of cinematic serial killer Buffalo Bill in the film “The Silence of the Lambs”. It’s situated on two acres of level land along the Youghiogheny River, which is located in the town of Perryopolis, about 30 miles south of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn addition, the original hardwood floors, woodwork, pocket doors and fireplaces are in pristine condition, dating back to 1910 when the home was built. With over 2300 square feet of quaint space throughout the home, there is a perfect location for your scene around every corner! The oversized three car detached garage has endless filming possibilities and was once the Layton General Store & Post Office. In addition, you’ll find a rare 1941 Chessie train caboose on our property.\n\nOther filming highlights include the wraparound lemonade front porch, custom built gazebo, the fully functional train tracks opposite the Youghiogheny River, and a secluded pond that border’s the property."
