        "text": "Toronto, the city of TV-filming hotspots\n\nBy Alyssa Bravo\n\nThe on-going COVID-19 pandemic has forced many of us to stay home but fortunately, we have several forms of entertainment at our disposal to keep us at bay. Whether it be through cable, a streaming service, or even Blu-ray/DVD boxsets, many of us have turned to binge-watching TV shows, both old and new. As surprising as it may sound, a number of popular TV shows were actually filmed locally. There are different factors as to why American film and television producers opt to shoot in Toronto. Perhaps it has to do with the city’s diverse mix of cityscapes and rural skylines, or maybe it’s simply due to monetary reasons. Either way, viewers will have fun spotting these familiar locations. Here is a list of some TV shows you probably didn’t know were filmed in Toronto:\n\n1) Hannibal (2013-2015)\n\nThis psychological horror series is based on Thomas Harris’ novels Red Dragon, Hannibal, and Hannibal Rising, starring the eponymous character of Dr. Hannibal Lecter. The series follows FBI special investigator Will Graham as he uncovers crimes of serial killers and the development of his relationship with Hannibal Lecter. Although the series takes place in numerous cities around the United States, most of it was filmed in Toronto. The University of Toronto’s Scarborough campus was used as a stand-in for Hannibal’s FBI headquarters. The show also features scenes filmed inside Roy Thomson Hall and the Art Gallery of Ontario.\n\nThe Art Gallery of Ontario’s Walker Court in an episode of Hannibal.\n\nThe trailer for season 1 showcases some Toronto locations.\n\n5) The Boys (2019-present)\n\nNetflix isn’t the only streaming service making its way to Toronto. The Boys is a Prime Video original series based on the comic book series of the same name by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson. This show explores a team of vigilantes as they challenge famous superheroes who frequently abuse their abilities and fame. Set in New York City much like other big superhero franchises, The Boys is actually filmed in Toronto, locations in the York Region, and in Oshawa. Viewers will recognize Yonge-Dundas Square substituting for New York’s Time Square and characters can be seen on the Toronto Transit Commission’s Line 2. Additionally, Oshawa’s Parkwood Estate and the Meridian Arts Centre make a few cameo appearances on the show."
