        "text": "Starting off on the Passaic River (off of Route 21), you will find the raised bridge which was part of the final climactic scenes of Annie. It was here that Aileen Quinn as little orphan Annie held on for dear life running from her \"fake\" parents.\n\nWhen you reach downtown, look up! Thanks to the rich architecture of Newark's many historic districts and iconic structures, downtown has set the scene for many movies and even Eminem's \"Not Afraid\" video. Newark was front and center for Newark Dancing and Just Another Day was shot off of Avon Avenue.\n\nJust two blocks away, a part of the same James Street Historic District, a block of Halsey Street was transformed to look like 1950's Chicago in Cadillac Records.\n\nOld school Cadillacs lined the street, extras in period clothing walked the sidewalks, and storefronts were converted into record shops, recording studios, and men's stores\n\nAdrian Brody, Jeffrey Wright, and Columbus Short were on the scene on Halsey.\n\nA few blocks away, take a step inside Newark City Hall with its golden dome, stone floors, and broad columns where Morgan Freeman can be spotted in the movie. The building was transformed into a makeshift infirmary with cots lining the hallway and vagrants burning fires.\n\nFrom City Hall, travel to the Ironbound on Ferry Street and you will run right into St. Stephen's Church at the intersection of Ferry Street and Wilson Avenue. It was here that you could have seen Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise filming the remake of War of the Worlds.\n\nRelive the scene and end the tour, by grabbing a table at Andros Diner (across the street) where the film crew grabbed coffee and mastermind meetings were held, and imagine how the steeple on the church was blown to smithereens by alien laser beams.\n\nOther quick shots of Newark can be seen in the 2004 comedy; Harold and Kumar go to White Castle and the 2014 film, Gimme Shelter. Seth Rogen and Barbara Streisand shook things up at Newark Liberty International Airport for The Guilt Trip (2012)."
