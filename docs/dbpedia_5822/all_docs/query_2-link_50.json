        "text": "@michellefortephotography\n\nStart your second day at the National Museum of Natural History, which serves as Diana’s office in Wonder Woman: 1984. While working as a cultural anthropologist and archaeologist, Diana secretly uses her superpowers to activate the Dreamstone that makes wishes come true. While the museum does not currently have wish-granting crystals on display, it does have a large collection of gemstones that date as far back as the 1500s.\n\nAfter the museum, head over to the place Diana calls home: the Watergate Hotel. Of course, the hotel also happened to be at the center of the greatest political scandal in U.S. history, which is magnificently covered in the legendary film All The President’s Men (the movie features additional DC locations throughout; see if you can spot them). Dig into the hotel’s fascinating and scandalous history, admire its beautiful architecture and check out its lively rooftop bar.\n\nOnce you’re ready to continue, walk over to the Shops at Georgetown Park, also known as the Georgetown metro station in No Way Out. Don’t be fooled by the movie -- there is no metro in Georgetown, but the shopping center where the scene was filmed is certainly there, right at the heart of one of DC’s trendiest neighborhoods. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 1995 smash hit, True Lies, also used Georgetown as a location. Take a peaceful stroll along the waterfront and enjoy an afternoon snack at one of the many cafes and restaurants.\n\nRunning up the Exorcist Stairs in Georgetown - Fitness-related breaks for meetings and conventions in Washington, DC\n\nAs the sun goes down, prepare for a dark and spooky evening visiting sites from the ultimate horror flick, The Exorcist. Marvel at the intricate architecture on the Georgetown University campus and spot some of the most iconic buildings, such as the Dahlgren Chapel and Healy Hall. Then, head to the infamous stairs on Prospect Street over which Father Miller tumbles and falls to his death. From the top of the staircase, be sure to spot the original MacNeil house from which he jumps!\n\n@scor3p.o\n\nAfter learning about the history of flight, make your way to Union Station, DC’s central transportation hub and a shooting location for the hit 2001 film, Hannibal (the sequel of The Silence of the Lambs). In the movie, the Beaux-Arts architecture of the Station makes it look more like a shopping mall than a train station. Don’t be disappointed that there is not a carousel there; although it was central to the scene where Hannibal stalks Clarice Starling, it was likely added in post-production.\n\nSpend your evening discovering National Treasure … shooting locations. First, stop by the Edgar Hoover Building, where Benjamin and Riley determine that the Declaration of Independence is in danger. Then, explore the National Archives Museum. Browse through some of their exciting historical exhibits and visit the Rotunda Room where our nation’s most important documents live … but definitely do not try to steal the Declaration of Independence. Finally, finish your National Treasure tour at the Library of Congress, where Riley tries to prove that the Declaration can’t be stolen. Be sure to check out the spectacular Main Reading Room and enjoy some quiet time to end your DC adventure."
