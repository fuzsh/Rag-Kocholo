Justin Tipping’s debut feature, Kicks, will open the U.S. narrative section, telling the story of a 15-year-old boy in the East Bay setting out to retrieve his stolen sneakers. The short film anthology Madly is the opening film in the international narrative competition, comprised of shorts directed by Gael García Bernal, Mia Wasikowska, Sebastian Silva, Anurag Kashyap, Sion Sono, and Natasha Khan, each exploring a different facet of contemporary love.\n\nBill and Turner Ross’ doc, Contemporary Color, chronicling a color guard event at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center, will open the documentary competition, while Chris Prynoski’s R-rated animated comedy, Nerdland, will kick off the Viewpoints category. Nerdland stars Paul Rudd and Patton Oswalt as two Hollywood unknowns desperate to become famous, with cameos from Hannibal Buress, Laraine Newman, Mike Judge, Molly Shannon, Kate Micucci, and Riki Lindhome.\n\nComedian Demetri Martin will make his directorial debut in Dean, which stars Martin as an illustrator who, still reeling from his mother’s death, tries to keep his father (Kevin Kline) from selling his childhood home while falling in love with a woman from Los Angeles (Gillian Jacobs). Other festival highlights include Equals, Drake Doremus’ sci-fi romance starring Nicholas Hoult and Kristen Stewart, and High-Rise, the Tom Hiddleston-starring adaptation of J.G. Ballard’s novel.\n\nIn all, the festival revealed 55 of the total 101 feature-length films, and the rest of the slate will be announced March 8. The entire 2016 lineup includes films from 32 countries, with 77 world premieres.
