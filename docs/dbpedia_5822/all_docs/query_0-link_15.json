        "text": "(1904–72). American director Edgar G. Ulmer was known as a supreme stylist of the B-film. His movies, many of which were shot in a week and made on a small budget, included The Black Cat (1934) and Detour (1945).\n\nEdgar George Ulmer was born on September 17, 1904, in Olmütz, Moravia, Austria-Hungary (now Olomouc, Czech Republic). He studied architecture while designing sets in Vienna. Theatrical director Max Reinhardt hired the teenage Ulmer to design his stage productions, and in the early 1920s he traveled with Reinhardt to New York, New York. During this time he also signed on with Universal as a set designer. He later went to Germany, where he served as an assistant director on F.W. Murnau’s The Last Laugh (1924) and Faust (1926). When Murnau went to Hollywood, California, in 1927 to make Sunrise, Ulmer followed; he also worked as a designer on City Girl (1930) and Tabu (1931). During this period Ulmer spent time in Berlin, where he codirected (with Robert Siodmak) the pseudodocumentary Menschen am Sonntag (1930; People on Sunday).\n\nIn 1933 Ulmer directed Damaged Lives, about a couple nearly destroyed by venereal disease. It was a commercial success despite having been banned in a number of U.S. cities. The next year Ulmer directed for Universal The Black Cat, a classic horror film inspired by an Edgar Allan Poe short story. It was the first movie to pair Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Barely an hour long, the film featured striking sets designed by Ulmer, who would create the sets for a number of his later productions.\n\nUlmer would not make another major studio film for more than 10 years. He had begun an affair with Shirley Kassler Alexander, the wife of Universal chief Carl Laemmle’s nephew, and was subsequently blackballed. (The couple later married.) Ulmer, freed from the constraints of major studios, would go on to demonstrate his ability to overcome low budgets and tight shooting schedules to craft engrossing and well-made films.\n\nAfter working as a set designer for Frank Borzage’s Little Man, What Now? (1934), Ulmer initially directed a number of low-profile projects. Using the pseudonym John Warner, he made the western Thunder over Texas (1934). He later directed several Yiddish-language dramas shot in and around New York City and a variety of public-health documentaries, including Goodbye, Mr. Germ (1940), about tuberculosis. Moon over Harlem (1939) was a crime drama with an African American cast that featured jazz saxophonist Sidney Bechet.\n\nIn 1942 Ulmer began working for Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC), which specialized in cheaply made B-films. His first film for PRC was the hour-long drama Tomorrow We Live. Ulmer was particularly busy in 1943, directing the comedy My Son, the Hero; Girls in Chains, about a recently fired teacher who struggles to improve conditions in a women’s reformatory; Isle of Forgotten Sins, a pearl-diving adventure; and Jive Junction, a musical about a high-school student (Dickie Moore) who organizes an all-girl swing band. The following year Ulmer made one of his best films, Bluebeard. The horror thriller featured John Carradine as a puppeteer and painter in 1800s Paris, France, who murders his female models.\n\nIn 1945 Ulmer directed the film noir Strange Illusion, the murder mystery Club Havana, and the classic noir Detour. The latter, which Ulmer claimed to have shot in just six days, featured Tom Neal as an unemployed musician hitchhiking to California. He is picked up by a genial businessman, but when the driver dies, Roberts decides to keep the car until he has reached Los Angeles, California. Along the way he picks up a conniving woman (Ann Savage), who forces him to continue the ploy in order to collect the dead man’s inheritance.\n\nIn 1946 Ulmer directed The Wife of Monte Cristo, an extension of the Alexandre Dumas tale, and Her Sister’s Secret, a melodrama about an unmarried woman (Nancy Coleman) who asks her married sister (Margaret Lindsay) to adopt her baby. That same year Ulmer worked at a major studio when he was hired to direct the film noir The Strange Woman at United Artists (UA). Hedy Lamarr starred as a woman in 1820s Maine who plots to have her wealthy husband killed. Carnegie Hall (1947) was a UA musical featuring appearances by such classical music giants as Artur Rubinstein, Jascha Heifetz, Lily Pons, Risë Stevens, and Leopold Stokowski.\n\nIn 1948 Ulmer directed Ruthless, a low-budget noir, with Zachary Scott as a financier who uses and abuses those around him. Next was I pirati di Capri (1949; The Pirates of Capri or The Masked Pirate), a low-budget swashbuckler starring Louis Hayward. Ulmer then made St. Benny the Dip (1951), a minor comedy about con men disguised as priests in New York City. The Man from Planet X (1951) was an evocative science-fiction B-film set on a Scottish island. Reportedly made in under a week, this cult favorite is one of the first movies about alien invaders. Less successful was the comedy Babes in Bagdad (1952), with stars Paulette Goddard and Gypsy Rose Lee."
