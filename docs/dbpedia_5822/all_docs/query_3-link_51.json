        "text": "All of this opulence, together with extravagant set-pieces that go past grisly to grotesque (and then, in the climax, on to goony), can't compensate for the halting pace of a patchy script.\n\nFull Review | Jul 15, 2023\n\nHopkins turns up the hamminess, as though his entire performance is rooted in the same instinct that inspired him to slither after his famous Chianti speech.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | Feb 17, 2022\n\nScott does justice to The Silence of the Lambs and the character of Hannibal in general, even without a few key pieces, and despite toning Harris's novel down plenty.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | May 6, 2019\n\nPart of the appeal of the Hannibal Lecter novels and films is the complexity of the principal character, who is at once a reprehensible murderer and a moral force for justice.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 6/10 | May 6, 2019\n\nHannibal doesn't seem to be about anything but its own swank decadence. Hopkins, with his reedy voice and effete airs, is still quite delicious in the part that won him an Oscar. But 10 years later, Lecter has become more camp than terrifying.\n\nFull Review | Mar 6, 2018\n\nThe story line of Hannibal is far less interesting than Silence of the Lambs and lacks the emotional subtlety of its predecessor. However, Hannibal is visually and aurally sumptuous, powered by Hans Zimmer's lovely score and brimming with flashy imagery.\n\nFull Review | Jan 18, 2018\n\nThe near-impossible taks and insurmountable problems have been handled by Scott in a proficient if unexciting way. Aware that he can't possibly meet viewers' expectations, Scott has made a different film, more florid, baroque, and tongue-in-cheek.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: B- | Oct 10, 2006\n\nThere are moments of a good movie buried amongst this over the top thriller. But these moments are all too rare.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1/4 | Sep 30, 2005"
