        "text": "Performativity is at times a crucial component of serial murder. A specific positioning of the body and accompanying scenarios, settings, props or costumes all serve to boast, to leave a mark and to communicate the murderer’s twisted message to the onlookers. Such theatricality of serial crime made it one of the favourite themes for popular culture. The latest example is “Hannibal” (2013- ), a television series created by Bryan Fuller for NBC. It is loosely based on the novels by Thomas Harris and the accompanying films. The characteristic feature of the series is the grotesqueness of the murders: female bodies pierced by antlers; a throat cut open to shove a violin bridge through; a human totem on the beach made of old and new pieces of victims – the list is long and appalling. In this book chapter the extremely bizarre nature of the presented crimes and their function are discussed. The performativity theory is used to look at how the murders, with their outlandish and extreme brutality, become metonymy for creating one’s identity. The serial killers in the show attempt to establish their own unique identity through their signature bizarre crimes; yet, these crimes are constantly repeated with a twist by Hannibal, who in this way both steals the other killers' identity and establishes his own. The series seems to illustrate the nature of identity as performative, unstable and changeable, especially in the light of the clash between sanity and insanity, which is one of the leitmotifs of the series. The main character of the show, Will Graham, is a forensic consultant whose greatest talent, through observation, is to momentarily \"become\" the murderer in order to understand the perpetrator's hidden agendas. This gift – again, stealing the murderer’s identity – leads him to the brink of madness, where he doubts who he is and what he is capable of. Paradoxically, Hannibal, the psychopath who eats his victims, is Will’s psychologist, whom Will believes to be the epitome of sanity. Thus, the shocking aspects of the show illustrate the core questions posed by it: what is identity, if it can be blurred by madness, be stolen, imposed or pretended?"
