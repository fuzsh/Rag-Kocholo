        "text": "If there is one destination that finds a place on every traveler’s bucket list, it would definitely be Europe. From romantic escapades to adventure-filled destinations to laid-back towns to picturesque villages, the varied terrain in Europe is simply unmatched and offers a special something to everyone, including spooky spots! Yes, you heard that right. There is another less explored side to Europe which will make you go numb. If you are one of those persons who loves going on a horrific journey, then buckle up. You are in for an exhilarating ride. Here’s Pickyourtrail, presenting you with some of the creepy places in Europe that will send a chill down your spine.\n\n10 Most Creepiest Spots in Europe\n\nMoosham Castle, Salzburg, Austria\n\nThe Vodnjan Mummies, Vodnjan, Croatia\n\nMiranda Castle, Celles, Belgium\n\nSedlec Ossuary, Kutna Hora, Czech Republic\n\nKayaköy, Muğla Province, Turkey\n\nThe Catacombs of Palermo, Sicily, Italy\n\nEdinburgh Castle, Edinburgh, Scotland\n\nHill of Crosses, Siauliai, Lithuania\n\nHoia Baciu Forest, Transylvania, Romania\n\nLangham Hotel, Marylebone, London\n\n1. Moosham Castle, Salzburg, Austria\n\nPerched atop a small hill amidst the lush greenery, Moosham Castle looks like just another medieval castle in broad daylight but has a gruesome past and is one of the most creepy places in Europe. Over 100’s of witches were beheaded within the walls of the castle and had to go through ghastly torture techniques which included cutting their hands off and branding them with hot iron rods. Visitors and staffs recount instances of being touched, phantom footsteps, and feeling someone’s breath on their neck.\n\n2. The Vodnjan Mummies, Vodnjan, Croatia\n\nWhen you hear about mummies, the first thing that comes to our minds would be Egypt. But, do you know Croatia also has its share of mummies? Bodies of six Saints within the Church of St.Blaise to be precise. Weird right, I know! But, do you know what is even more interesting? For some strange reason, the bodies failed to decompose and they lie stiff as a wood making it one of the most spookiest places in Europe. Adding to the creepy aura is also a CD which explains the life and the death of the Saints.\n\n3. Miranda Castle, Celles, Belgium\n\nOnce a lavish fairy-tale castle, Miranda Castle now is a ghost hunter’s paradise and is one of the most haunted places in Europe. Built in the 19th century during the French Revolution, Miranda Castle was taken over by the National Railway Company of Belgium as an orphanage for sickly children until the late 1970’s. Today the Miranda Castle is completely abandoned. As you explore the ruins of the castle, you will feel the mood of the forgotten souls and their dreams seeping through your bones. Notably, few scenes of the famous American series Hannibal were shot here.\n\n4. Sedlec Ossuary, Kutna Hora, Czech Republic\n\nDecorated with over 40,000 human skeletons, Sedlec Ossuary also called as Bone Church is one of the most unusual chapels you will ever see and is one of the most scary and haunted places in Europe. Set right beneath the Cemetery Church of all Saints, Sedlec Ossuary looks pleasant on the outside and resembles your average old Gothic medieval church. But, totally a different scenario inside. Long story short – Once the Abbot of the Sedlec Monastery scattered a jar of ‘Holy Soil’ across the Sedlec Cemetery and soon everyone desired to be buried there. And, thus all the skeletons!\n\n5. Kayaköy, Muğla Province, Turkey\n\nPreviously a bustling town, Kayaköy is now an empty ghost town except for a few tour groups and road vendors selling out handmade stuff. Located in the south of Fethiye in southwestern Turkey, the town of Kayaköy was inhabited by about 2,000 residents during 1900. Subsequent wars and violence around the region triggered thousands of residents to flee from the town. Stripped to dust, an approximate of 350 homes sit there empty and roofless making it one of the most creepy places in Europe.\n\n6. The Catacombs of Palermo, Sicily, Italy\n\nHave you ever seen a well-dressed Mummy? Hanging on the walls & shelves and lying in the open coffin, nearly 8,000 corpses inside the Catacombs of Palermo are dressed in their very best. The Burial Catacombs of Palermo serve as a historical as well as a macabre tourist attraction. The deceased hands are stretched out in a way that the family visiting them can hold their hands in prayer. Definitely one of the most creepy places in Europe!\n\n7. Edinburgh Castle, Edinburgh, Scotland\n\nDominating the skyline of Scotland, the historic fortress of Edinburgh is one of the world’s most famous destinations and is also ironically one of the world’s most haunted places in Europe. From witch trails to torture to imprisonment to murder, Edinburgh Castle has seen it all. Staffs and tourists visiting Edinburgh have reported repeated drop in temperatures, strange sightings, and the feeling of being touched.\n\n8. Hill of Crosses, Siauliai, Lithuania\n\nCross is said to bring back hope right? But, the eerie way it is placed in the Hill of Crosses brings in an odd feeling and is hence one of most spookiest places in Europe. It all started with the relatives of the rebels leaving crosses to commemorate the fallen souls. Now, the Hill of Crosses contains more than 200,000 crosses, carvings, & shrines and is a pilgrimage site for the Catholics. Hill of Crosses is regarded as the site where Jesus performs miracles.\n\n9. Hoia Baciu Forest, Transylvania, Romania\n\nRemember seeing the animated movie, Transylvania with all the Dracula and the zombies? Oh, how much fun! Hoia Baciu Forest in Transylvania is totally the opposite of it and is one of the most creepy places in Europe. Often referred to as the ‘Bermuda Triangle of Romania’, the mysterious woods of Hoia Baciu Forest is home to UFO sightings, unusual disappearances, and famous ghost stories. Completely serene with a coat of green, explore the dense woods of Hoia Baciu Forest and unravel the paranormal activities for yourself.\n\n10. Langham Hotel, Marylebone, London\n\nVisited by some of the greats, including Oscar Wilde, Mark Twain, and Sir Arthur Conon Doyle, Langham Hotel in London is one of the spookiest hotels in Europe to stay at. Wondering which is the most haunted room in this hotel? It is room 333. Yes, double it & you get the devil’s number. Freaky coincidence. If you are planning to stay here, watch out for a man in military attire, the ghost of Napoleon III, the ghostly butler, and the man in the Victorian evening wear. Uff, so many ghosts to dodge!\n\nWant to discover these creepy places in Europe?
