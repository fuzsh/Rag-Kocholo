Several of the films above were based on books, but there are many more set in our mountains. However, not all movies based on books about WNC were shot in the region.\n\nCold Mountain (2003)\n\nBased on a true family story of the author’s, this book and film tell the tale of William Pinkney Inman. Inman was conscripted from his home in WNC into the Confederate army during the Civil War, but deserted to return to his love, Ada. Even though much of the film takes place in the Blue Ridge Mountains, the film was primarily shot in Romania.\n\nGenius (2016)\n\n“Genius” is the story of Maxwell Perkins, editor to famed authors F. Scott Fitzgerald and Thomas Wolfe, Asheville’s native son. While star Jude Law visited town during research for the film, production took place in the UK and Czech Republic. It was a missed opportunity to showcase scenic Riverside Cemetery, if you ask us.\n\nThe Longest Ride (2015)\n\nBased on a Nicholas Sparks novel, characters in this story visit Black Mountain College in their youth and engage with many artists who studied there. The movie was filmed in North Carolina, but production did not make it to WNC for any of the scenes.\n\nMemphis Belle (1990)\n\nThis Matthew Modine action film is loosely based on the memoir of Col. Robert K. Morgan, who once flew his B-17 bomber between Asheville’s city and county buildings. Despite a prime opportunity to recreate that scene in town, the film was shot exclusively in the UK. (Side note: Col. Morgan worked for NAI Beverly-Hanks for many years before retiring.)\n\nSerena (2014)\n\nBased on Ron Rash’s novel, Serena is the tale of a timber magnate whose life is complicated when he marries a young woman named Serena. Despite taking place in the mountains of North Carolina, the film was shot almost exclusively in the Czech Republic.\n\nTravel the WNC Movie Trail\n\nAre you interested in recreating a little movie magic?
