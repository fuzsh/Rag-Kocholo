        "text": "The Hannibal Directive was a highly classified military order used by the Israeli army. It was created in 1986 by three top army commanders and outlined the measures to be taken in the event that an Israeli soldier was captured during combat. The order’s intention was to prevent the enemy from escaping with the captured soldier, even if it meant putting the soldier’s life and the lives of civilians at risk. The Hannibal Directive was last implemented during the 2014 Gaza War, also known as Operation Protective Edge, during which over 2,000 Palestinians and 72 Israelis were killed.\n\nOn August 1, 2014, the Israeli Army invoked the Hannibal Directive at Rafah in southern Gaza to prevent Hamas fighters from fleeing with a captured Israeli officer. The intense action that followed resulted in the deaths of at least 135 civilians, 75 of whom were children. Amnesty International and other NGOs have labelled the events of that day, referred to as “Black Friday,” as a war crime.\n\nThis documentary is exploring the secret history of the Hannibal Directive, including its origins, recent use, and implications. The film, made amidst the ongoing controversy surrounding the doctrine’s morality and application, features interviews with former Israeli soldiers, reservists, and civilians who were divided on whether the policy, which resulted in the deaths of numerous innocent civilians, could ever be justified. The order was eventually quietly revoked by the Israeli military in June 2016.\n\nThe Seventh Million is a thought-provoking documentary series. It is based on a book by Israeli historian Tom Segev. The film, directed by Benny Brunner and written by Segev, examines some of the most sensitive and previously undisclosed chapters of Israeli history. It explores the Zionist leadership’s ambiguous response to the Holocaust as it was occurring and the challenges that the new state of Israel faced in dealing with the trauma of the Holocaust. The film also portrays the often-negative reception of Holocaust survivors in pre-Israel Palestine and in the new state of Israel, where they were frequently ignored or scorned by a society focused on heroism and the creation of a “new man.”\n\nA key moment in Israel’s coming to terms with the legacy of the Holocaust was the Eichmann trial in the early 1960s, which was broadcast live on Israeli radio. The trial served not only as a form of group therapy for the entire nation but also as a turning point in the Israeli attitude towards Holocaust survivors, who were finally able to share their stories publicly.\n\nSegev’s narration is supplemented by a range of interesting and compelling archival footage, dramatic location shooting, and visits to Holocaust memorial sites in Israel and Poland. The film also features interviews with well-known Israeli writers who witnessed many of the events depicted in the film, providing a counterpoint to Segev’s arguments and creating an engaging dialectic.\n\nOverall, “The Seventh Million” provides valuable context for understanding the profound impact of the Holocaust on the Israeli psyche. It takes a critical look at the complex relationship between the Holocaust and Israel’s cultural and political identity in the first 50 years following this devastating event in Jewish history."
