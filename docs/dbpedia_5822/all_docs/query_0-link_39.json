        "text": "While the competition categories of Sundance often bring in a share of new talent, the premieres in narrative and documentary often thrive on recognition, whether the actor/filmmaker is a festival alumni, or a simply big star. In a category that’s previously given the world “Boyhood,” “Wiener-Dog” and “Manchester by the Sea,” many projects with notable stars and reputable directors can be found here.\n\nIn this year’s batch, narrative premieres of curious note include the latest from “A Bigger Splash'” director Luca Guadagnino (“Call Me By Your Name”), “The One I Love” director Charlie McDowell (“The Discovery,” starring Jason Segel and Rooney Mara), an ensemble comedy that puts Katie Aselton, Toni Collette, Bridget Everett and Molly Shannon in the same scenes (“Fun Mom Night”), a true story starring Jack Black about a ponzi-scheming polka king (“The Polka King”) and much more.\n\nThe same effect of recognition applies for the festival’s premiere docs, which include a lot of recognizable names in filmmakers. Evgeny Afineevsky (director of 2015’s “Winter on Fire”), Barbara Kopple (“Miss Sharon Jones!” most recently) and Stanley Nelson (2015’s “The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution“) are just a few names that make the premiere lineup intriguing with the promise of newly challenging subjects.\n\nOf course, a key part of Sundance is the unusual fare to be found in its Midnight lineup, which offers some eye-catching films right off the bat: “78/52” takes a deep look at the famous shower scene in “Psycho”; “The Little Hours” has “Joshy” writer/director Jeff Baena tackling a medieval convent in Tuscany with a cast that includes Alison Brie, Dave Franco and Aubrey Plaza; horror anthology “XX” is an all-women affair, with four female directors including Karyn Kusama at helm.\n\nThere’s much more after those three categories, including Spotlight titles and Special Events, the latter which will include the heavily anticipated world premieres of series “Shots Fired” and “TIME: The Khalief Browder Story.” A complete listing of the newly announced titles (straight from the press release) can be found below.\n\nPREMIERES\n\nBeatriz at Dinner / U.S.A.
