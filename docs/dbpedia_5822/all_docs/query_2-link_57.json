Sometimes, you’ll notice a place you’ve visited before featured in the film, and you get a little excited about it. How often do you get to see the city you live in up on the screen? There have actually been quite a few movies filmed in or near Manassas, and other cities in Virginia.\n\nMovies Filmed In Manassas\n\nSome movies that have scenes shot in Manassas, Virginia include:\n\nMy Son John (1952)\n\nDeep Impact (1998) – Filmed in Manassas & Arlington, Virginia\n\nRules of Engagement (2000)\n\nBelow the Beltway (2007) Filmed in Manassas & Vienna, Virginia\n\nThe Taking (2013) – Filmed in Manassas & Stafford, Virginia\n\nA Split Personality (2013)\n\nDiary of a Serial Killer (2013) – Filmed in Manassas and many other areas all over Virginia\n\nThe majority of the listed movies are either science fiction, drama, action, or comedy, but The Taking, and A Split Personality are both horror films.\n\nDocumentaries Filmed in Manassas\n\nThere have been two documentaries filmed in Manassas, which are titled:\n\nThe Blue and the Gray (1935) – Filmed in Manassas and many other areas all over Virginia\n\nThe Gettysburg Address (2017)\n\nThere have also been quite a few short films, a few mini-series, and a TV series that was called The Broken Continent (2013).\n\nFamous Movies Filmed Around Virginia\n\nSome very noteworthy movies have been filmed outside of Manassas in other areas of Virginia. Some of these include:\n\nDirty Dancing (1987) – Filmed at the Mountain Lake Resort in Pembroke, Virginia\n\nHannibal (2001) – Richmond, Virginia was one of many filming locations\n\nEvan Almighty (2007) – Numerous Virginia Cities\n\nTransformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2007): Udvar-Hazy Center in Fairfax\n\nVirginia’s beauty has proven to be a hot spot for filmmakers for quite a few years, and will probably continue to be for years to come. Its history provides endless possibilities – from documentaries and dramas to horror and action films. So next time you settle in to see a movie, be sure to keep an eye out for places in your city!"
