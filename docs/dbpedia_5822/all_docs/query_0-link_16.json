        "text": "The political reconciliation with Austria in 1867 gave a huge boost to the economy and the arts, including the spread and development of the newest form of entertainment: film. Half a year after the first screening in Paris, films were being shown in Budapest, with the Hungar ian premiere of the new technology held in April 1896. The birth of Hungarian film was in 1901,when dance recordings were made as an illustration of a performance. By the time the First World War broke out, dozens of short and long films had been made, and by that time the number of film studios was already significant. The first films were made by journalists and photographers, the best known of whom were perhaps Sir Alexander Korda, Michael Curtiz, Lajos Bíró, and Ferenc Molnár, who later took an active part in world film production.\n\nThe aftermath of the First World War resulted in a massive economic and artistic depres sion that led to an exodus of our filmmakers. Besides Europe, America attracted the most Hungarian talent, and since then, Hungarian names have regularly appeared in the head lines of foreign films. The Second World War was followed by an era in which communist propaganda feature films became increasingly eclipsed by valuable creative film.\n\nSince the regime change of 1989-90, Hungarian film has been about finding its path, the desire to create, and the accurate representa tion of Hungary’s history, which re-experienced the taste of freedom in this era. The creators who are still active today have found their own voices primarily through arthouse movies, some of which have been so successful that they have made their direc tors’ names popular beyond our borders.\n\nDuring the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy (1867-1918), the German language played a prominent role in the life of the country, so German crews often made their films in Hungary.\n\nMoreover, during the First World War, a separate Hungarian-Austrian Film Company operated in Cluj-Napoca in Transylvania. In the 1920s, thanks to the large-scale technical develop - ments of the Hunnia Film Studio, several German films were shot in Hungary, but the international popularity of the Hungarian film industry reached its peak in the early 1930s. Dozens of films were made in Budapest at the time, which, in addition to Hungarian, were made simultaneously in French, German, and Romanian.\n\nIn 1941, with the help of Hungary, the first Bulgarian sound film was made in a studio in Budapest, and cooperation between nations did not stop during the years of communism either. After the Hungarian Uprising of 1956, co-production activity revived, so in the coming decades several films were made with the participation of French, Romanian, Czechoslovakian, West German, and American partners. Purely foreign productions working in Hungarian studios and external venues appeared in Hungary in the 1980s, before the change of regime.\n\nThe number of such contract works jumped significantly in the 1990s, and the Hungarian film industry consciously set about serving a full\n\nFACTORIES\n\nFrom the outside, the clinker brick buildings of the Óbuda Stocking Factory give the impression of a completely deserted area, but these could be the factories of a Hanseatic city or a medieval fortress, just like the brick build- ing of the Globus factory in Kőbánya looks like an old, inaccessible castle. The Csepel Works, on the other hand, is a huge industrial estate with halls, factory chimneys, neon lighting, vast ironworks and a Socialist heritage, but you can also find a classic, fin-de-siècle red-brick building and a sawmill. Moreover, the greatest wonder here is the futuristic industrial water-treatment plant, which might even be in Chernobyl. The thick striped, domed towers of the Óbuda Gas Factory also feel out of a fairy-tale world.\n\nHOUSING ESTATES, COMMUNITIES\n\nA Socialist or fin-de-siècle atmosphere is superbly rendered by various estates. The Százados Road Art Colony is hidden amid\n\nshady trees, its sculptures and easels scattered throughout the Art Nouveau buildings of the garden suburbs. The MÁVAG Colony evokes a closed and abandoned world from a bygone era, the Kerepesi Road housing estate is Socialist-Realism itself, while the Óbuda experimental housing estate is the home of various explorations into form and concrete. The suburban Wekerle estate, with its folksy Art-Nouveau houses, is an example of a cute fairy-tale town.\n\nABANDONED, DYSTOPIAN SITES\n\nA city that is constantly on the move should not want for sites that are temporarily or permanently abandoned. The Art Nouveau and Modern buildings of the North Pest Hospital are rendered quite mystical by the light filtering through the broken windows, while standing under the glass dome of the main building feels just like a post-war world.\n\nToday, it is pretty creepy to wander between the crumbling walls and empty autopsy tables of the Lipótmezei sanatorium, abandoned for years. In corridors with ceilings five metres high, pipes protrude from the walls and childish graffiti greets any wanderer. One of the most special places in the capital is the frame of the Hungarian Szentföld Church in Hűvösvölgy, whose semi-finished concrete wreath rises strangely above the woodland villas. Originally, the space between the reinforced concrete columns would have been a sacred building uniting copies of the most important pilgrimage sites in the Holy Land. Today, it is filled with crumbling walls, ruined furniture and factory machines, a winding staircase and a smell much closer to a post-apocalyptic world than the Holy Land.\n\nADRIA PALACE\n\nThe Adria Palace was one of the most magnificent buildings of the turn of the century but is now falling to pieces. This neo-Baroque palace, designed by the star architect of the era, Artúr Meinig, was unveiled in 1902 and operated as a naval building before becoming a ghostly castle on Szabadság Square. The icy atmosphere is interrupted in some places by memories of its old splendour: the main staircase carved in marble, the fresco depicting the goddess of the Adriatic, Venetian mirrors and huge carved wooden doors.\n\nTHE MOST BEAUTIFUL STAIRCASES\n\nBudapest is full of hidden treasures, often to be discovered behind closed doors. These in- clude mysterious spiral staircases, such as the one decorated with frescos and an illuminated dome at the Várkert Bazaar, while those at the Gerlóczy Café, 8 Dalszínház Street and 13 Kossuth Lajos Square exude the atmosphere of the apartment buildings of Paris. The spiral staircases of the Ybl Palace display the elegant bourgeois world of the late 19th century.�\n\nAQUINCUM\n\nYou only need to head out to Óbuda to sense the atmosphere of Ancient Rome, as here you may discover a whole part of the city where soldiers and citizens once strolled around the 1st century AD.\n\nMONASTIC REMAINS\n\nScenes from chivalric novels and romantic horror stories may well have been set in the dawn mist around the remains of Franciscan and Dominican monasteries on Margaret Island. The remnants of a Gothic church façade, a monastery cemetery and a graveyard chapel are attractively obscured amid the foliage of the trees.\n\nGOTHIC\n\nMatthias Church – The Castle District has one of the most famous churches in Budapest, whose construction began in 1015 after Hungary adopted Christianity. It was rebuilt in Gothic style in the 14th century and still provides one of the finest examples, with its stone-traced windows, buttresses, sculptures and reliefs. Beneath the pointed arches are gold leaf and 600 square metres of murals and oak doors, while Zsolnay tiling creates the colourful cavalcade of the roof. Habsburg Emperor Franz Joseph and Empress Elisabeth were crowned here.\n\nBAROQUE\n\nBuda Castle – The iconic landmark of Budapest cityscape is the huge green domed palace rising on Castle Hill, rebuilt in Baroque style when Buda was recaptured in 1686. Around the interiors, instead of the atmosphere of Versailles, you see examples of Hungarian Socialist-Realism, but every detail of the façade shows the elegance of Baroque.\n\n�TURKISH\n\nOne positive aspect of 150 years of Turkish occupation is the Ottoman architecture that has remained here in the city, enriching Budapest’s built heritage. The Király, Rudas, Rác and Veli bej Baths are particularly outstanding, their cupola-domed, coral-coloured pool areas illuminated by shafts of light passing through the skylights. Equally notable is Gül Baba türbe, a Turkish chapel tomb atop a cascading rose garden.\n\nCLASSICIST\n\nIn the 19th century, clear and simple floor plans, strict proportions, horizontal layouts, columns and tympanums were the most important architectural features, with several attractive examples to be found in Budapest. The Hungarian National Museum is one of the most beautiful Classicist buildings in the capital, the walls and ceilings of its staircase decorated with frescos by Károly Lotz. The monumental snow-white building of the Ludovika Academy and the Sándor Palace not only preserve the atmosphere of the 1800s on their façade but also within, amid gilded ornamentation and damask-clad walls.\n\nROMANTICISM\n\nOne of the most attractive buildings in Budapest is Unger House, which embodies Romanticism, but also Byzantine, Neo-Gothic and Moorish styles, where the inner courtyard, guarded by stone dragons, is still paved with original wooden block flooring. The most beautiful building along the Danube Promenade on the Pest side is the Pesti Vigadó, alsobuilt in Romanticist style, with its interior of shining marble, sparkling gilded chandeliers and amazing wood-coffered ceiling.\n\nHISTORICIST\n\nThe atmosphere of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the city awash with cultural, economic and technological development, is reflected in the Historicist style, providing the most defining image of Budapest. Stretching sublimely along the banks of the Danube, the stone-laced, vaulted, neo-Gothic Parliament is one of the most beautiful buildings in the capital. The symbols of neo-Renaissance are easily found, too. The recently renovated Opera House was first modelled on Italian Renaissance palaces, its frescos, putti, marble\n\ncolumns, arches and gold ornamentation a favoured setting for balls. On the left bank of the Danube, the colonnades of the Várkert Bazaar and its wonderful rose garden are the epitome of fin-de-siècle ambience, women preferring to stroll with their companions beneath embroidered parasols and hats. The age of the emperors, on the other hand, is best reflected in the gilded ballrooms and salons of the Wenckheim Palace or the Károlyi-Csekonics Palace, with their ceramic stoves and huge Venetian glass mirrors.�\n\nART NOUVEAU\n\nTurquoise Zsolnay tiling, majolica and stained glass lend the Gellért Baths, built at the foot of Gellért Hill, the atmosphere of a magical water world, while the crenellated façade of the Royal Postal Savings Bank, dotted with motifs of folk art and diligent bees, provides another beautiful example of Art Nouveau architecture in the capital. On the other hand, the Kőrössy Villa, resplendent with windows created by stainedglass master Miksa Róth, lush ornamentation, peacocks and allegorical figures, is one of the finest examples of frothier French Art Nouveau. Designed by Ödön Lechner, the grand master of Art Nouveau, the Museum of Applied Arts is another of the capital’s most beautiful buildings,\n\nits ceramic Zsolnay tiles, colourful majolica, florals, tendrils and serpentine patterns offering a special blend of Hindu, Islamic and Hungarian architecture. The elegant Gresham Palace near the Chain Bridge is an ornate example of Central-European Art Nouveau, designed by the finest craftsmen in Hungary, whose handiwork is preserved by countless examples of stained glass, colourful mosaics and imposing wrought iron. With its turquoise domes, eosin-glazed depictions of animals, the Elephant House at Budapest Zoo, bearing the hallmarks of Indian and African art, is another important Art Nouveau building in town, while the Institute for the Blind also combines Far-Eastern influences with Hungarian motifs. Its Nador Hall still preserves its original furniture and decoration, together with the largest stained-glass window in Hungary.\n\nMOORISH NOTES\n\nArt Nouveau loved to use Oriental motifs, and the synagogue architecture of Budapest is full of Moorish notes. Gold, red and blue colours, columns, domes, wooden coffering, laced rose windows and many more details typify the city’s synagogues, which in themselves exude something quite elusive, a mystical atmosphere. The largest synagogue in Europe is the one on Dohány Street which, with its iconic towers, somewhat resembles a medieval Arab fortress. Above the octagonal interior of the Rumbach Sebestyén Street Synagogue is a tall and ornate dome supported by slender iron columns and Alhambra-like capitals. The most closed-off, however, is Kazinczy Street Synagogue which, with its sandy façade and relative unadornment, alludes to a community that lives by strict rules. This austerity is only interrupted by the crenellations reminiscent of the Torah and the azure tone of the interior.\n\nART DECO\n\nThe masterpiece of Hungarian Art Deco is clearly an industrial complex built in the late 1930s, the Kelenföld Power Plant, which is meant to symbolise man’s victory in every detail. Here, space seems endless in every direction, with clean shapes, switches and glass everywhere. Floors of glass squares, spiral staircases, fading lamps, 55 tired green colours and a translucent glass roof make this building iconic, its interior overpoweringly daunting. A dystopian atmosphere of tension, chaos and power can equally be felt at the former ELMŰ transformer house of clinker brick on Markó Street, which is not without a certain geometry, and, alongside, the pink, tower-like apartment building on Honvéd Street. Both are beautiful examples of Art Deco in Budapest.\n\nBAUHAUS\n\nThe finest Hungarian Bauhaus architecture is located in a narrow street in the Pasarét district of Buda. At the Napraforgó Street Estate, new, groundbreaking single-storey villas are lined in a row, all clean and functional, each embodying quality and finesse in their use and choice of materials. Between the wars, the best Hungarian architectural design was used for this estate, and walking down the street is both a breath of fresh air and a journey back in time to the everydaylife of Buda citizens in the 1930s. The legendary, celestial Bauhaus houses on Pozsonyi Road known as Dunapark not only contain impressive staircases but with their pleasant proportions, simple design and elegant use of materials, 56 are examples of modern apartment-building construction. Rounded arches, spiral staircases, marble and glass slats abound. The famous Piston House on Margit Boulevard was also built as a luxury apartment building in the late 1930s,\n\nits special feature being its lift with moving glass cylinders. Budapest’s first open-air lido, the Palatinus on Margaret Island, is also the world’s only lido built in Bauhaus style. This sleek, minimalist, snow-white building, with its subtle alternation of solid and pierced surfaces, curved railings and columns, evokes contemporary luxury.\n\nLATE MODERN, BRUTALIST\n\nHuge concrete monsters, strange shapes, rugged walls and glass fragments, all the hallmarks of Brutalist architecture, can be found all over Budapest. The reinforced concrete OKISZ headquarters in the depths of the Zugló villa district shows the exciting play of Late-Modern architecture with its lively, retracted façade. It also has a working paternoster. The two intertwined parts of the Southern Railway Station are also playful, and the t�inted glass, copper railings, marbled spaces and concrete decorative elements running through this travel palace whisk you straight back to the Socialist era.\n\nThe number of concrete constructions in Budapest is also enriched by the Late Modern Buda Arboretum building, which is already crumbling here and there, though the walls overgrown with ivy have a special charm. You only need look at the grey concrete block of the Farkasréti All Saints’ Parish Church for the sharp peaks of this skyscraper to send shivers down your spine.\n\nSOCIALIST-REALIST\n\nThe obligatory trend of the fifties is Socialist in content, and the National or Socialist style in form, which strangely mixes the features of Classicist architecture, in arcades, colonnades and tympanums, with popular motifs such as a mother bathing her child, a farmer scything wheat or a worker in a factory. The best examples of this in Budapest are the Kerepesi Road housing estate, the Gubacsi Road housing estate, the main building of the Moholy-Nagy University of Art & Design (MOME), with its thick columns, and the Pannónia Film Studio.\n\nCONTEMPORARY\n\nOne of the coolest investments in contemporary architecture, its non plus ultra, are the ten stations of Metro line 4, where you see spiralling coloured mosaics, concrete webbing and striking industrial forms weaving through the huge hall areas. At the Zugliget campus of the Moholy-Nagy University of Art & Design (MOME), they erected super-modern buildings which, with their immaculate whiteness, exposed concrete walls, spacious and bright spaces, seem like high-tech centres for American research laboratories. The dazzling interior of the MÜPA cultural complex is accompanied by a simple and timeless façade,\n\na bright and airy space, and elegant shapes, while the solid wall of light grey is broken by slender columns and huge glass windows. The Piarist Centre on Március 15 Square is a special building in every way, as it mixes neo-Baroque strength with the layers of the 21st century. Here, a coloured concrete box divided into strips has been placed in the hall, hiding a theatre hall. The House of Hungarian Music in City Park is one of the most outstanding buildings of recent years. Its spaces are overgrown with deciduous trees, its glass walls render it translucent, and its perforated roof is held in place by slender columns.�\n\n�When it comes to venues, instead of crowded multiplex cinemas, Budapest can offer you picturesque classical and movie theatres like the art nouveau Uránia. MÜPA, the Palace of the Arts, is one of the most modern Hungarian cultural institutions, special because it is a venue that is equally suited to several branches of art at the same time.\n\nBudapest is not only famous for amazing architecture, immensely rich cultural life and buzzing gastronomy: movies also play a very important role in the life of the city. Stars tend to love Budapest beyond work and prefer to extend their stay after the wrap as well.\n\nThe Hungarian motion picture industry has undergone a spectacular development process in recent decades. Film production has been continuous in Hungary since 1901, expertise is growing, filmmakers pass on their knowledge and experience from generation to generation, their enthusiasm is relentless, and nothing can stop them.\n\nSince 2016, the amount spent on film production in Hungary has exceeded USD 400 million every year, mostly from the international market. Thanks to the supportive attitude of the government, our excellent producers and the trust of our foreign partners, even the pandemic could not break the upward trend.\n\nIn connection with Hungarian motion picture, we usually talk about directors, actors and, at best, cinematographers, while there are about twenty thousand experienced professionals, enthusiastic people working in the field who represent the highest quality. Over the past ten years, the Hungarian film industry has developed enormously; Budapest is currently the most popular filming location in continental Europe.\n\nBy establishing the necessary conditions and ensuring the smooth running of administration, the team of the National Film Institute will do their best in the various fields to promote film production in Hungary.\n\nThe deposit account managed by the NFI is a secure and predictable source of tax benefits; and thanks to the efficient administration and a great working relationship with the National Film Office, we contribute to the conclusion of several grant agreements every year.\n\nOur national Location Office offers filmmakers assistance in managing the use of public spaces and state-owned real estate for filming purposes. We process hundreds of applications each year and, to the best of our ability, help with authorizations for filming, bringing significant revenue to local governments; not to mention making parts of our beautiful built environment world-famous in as many film roles as possible.\n\nOur Filmlab is the post-production studio with the longest history in Hungary. It has been providing a full range of post-production services for over 60 years, harmoniously combining traditional film development with digital technology. Thanks to continuous improvements, it provides services with the most modern tools.\n\nThe success of the Hungarian film industry is evidenced by the recent shortage of studio capacity, to which we were able to respond with an expansion with the largest state involvement ever, thanks to the support of the government. As a result of the development, the NFI Studios in Fót, which almost all filmmakers have visited since the 1970s, is expanding fivefold and awaits filmmakers from all over the world with the usual expertise and fresh enthusiasm.\n\nThe basic goal of our training department is to secure the pipeline of experts in the entire sector. We consult regularly with the players of the film industry to evaluate their needs.\n\nBased on this we support training institutions, organize our own trainings and introduce career orientation initiatives.\n\nThe formation of Mid Atlantic Films in 2005 was born from a vision that Hungary should regain its prominence on the international film stage.

Hungary's rich history and urban landscapes added depth and intrigue to the storytelling, enhancing its global appeal.\n\nProton Cinema is a Budapest-based independent film production company, founded by producer Viktória Petrányi and director Kornél Mundruczó, who have been friends and co-creators since university. The company was launched after the founders’ first feature successes, which brought together a well-working team and have gained several international prizes ever since.

Its central building was built in 1937 and declared an industrial monument. MABÉOSZ, the head- quarters of the Hungarian Stamp Collectors’ Association was another important location of Turbulent Skies. The building, with its large-scale spaces and timeless atmosphere is a location in which many film creators can immediately imagine their visions taking shape.\n\nThe Good Traitor (2020) – During the production of The Good Traitor, Proton Cinema had the chance to re-create the White House in Hungary.\n\nHidden: Förstfödd (2019 – 2020) – Hidden had several interesting and spectacular locations, special Hungarian features, including the former Dreher brewery.
