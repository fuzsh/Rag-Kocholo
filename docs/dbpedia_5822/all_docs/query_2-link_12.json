        "text": "You are here:\n\nHome\n\nBlog\n\nCategories: Lifestyle\n\nFlorence for film lovers\n\nA real-life journey through Florentine movie sets.\n\nEach charming street of Florence leads you to another dramatic backdrop and stunning setting, making it no surprise that the Renaissance city is regularly chosen by big names and Hollywood stars to realize their cinematic dreams. Cast an eye on the city we love as it’s portrayed by world-renowned directors, with our round-up of popular films set in Florence.\n\nGet inspiration for your next trip, by following the camera along centuries-old alleys, spotting the sites that have made the big screen and taking part in your own movie magic.\n\nA Room with a View (1985)\n\nThis love story has brought starry-eyed visitors to Florence ever since the novel’s original publication in 1908, with E.M. Forster penning the tale that was a perfect fit for the big screen, expertly done James Ivory by 1985. Carriages and petticoats abound, as we follow Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham Carter) and George Emerson (Julian Sands) in the discovery of the city’s rich cultural heritage. Follow in their footsteps to piazza della Signoria and the Loggia dei Lanzi (location for the famous fainting damsel scene!) before venturing towards the Santa Croce Basilica to admire Giotto’s frescoes in the Peruzzi Chapel. Come back around to see the original “room with a view” in Hotel degli Orafi, that was once the Hotel-Pensione Quisisana e Ponte Vecchio, taking time to gaze out at the view below, much like Lucy.\n\nHannibal (2001)\n\nOn to something much less romantic: this creepy thriller featuring Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins doesn’t necessarily paint the prettiest picture of Florence, but you’ll still enjoy the snapshots of familiar spots in amongst the gore. The sequel to The Silence of the Lambs (1991) sees Hannibal the cannibal hiding out in Florence, stealthily making his way amongst the sites which still manage to appear magical in spite of the terrifying figure in their midst! San Niccolò is the setting for Dr. Lecter’s apartment, filmed in Palazzo Capponi alle Rovinate (via de’ Bardi 36).\n\nHeading towards the river, give a glance to the green areas below the Uffizi Gallery, where shots of Florentine rowers (and more!) were filmed. The Santa Maria Novella pharmacy also makes an appearance, with eagle-eyed Florence lovers lapping up the brief relief from the horror. Hannibal purchases almond soap for the protagonist, Clarice, but that’s not enough to scare us off adoring their scented goods!\n\nInferno (2016)\n\nDan Brown fans will have been waiting for this reference! The much-loved thriller writer wrote a page-turner inspired by Florentine’s literary genius, Dante Alighieri, and his Divine Comedy that was divided into three tomes: Paradiso, Purgatorio and Inferno. Brown takes us straight to hell with another classic Langdon mystery that kicks off in Florence. Ron Howard’s 2016 adaptation of the book offers some breathtaking panoramic shots of the city as Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) runs from one historic treasure to another. Langdon and Sienna Brooks (Felicity Jones) take the Vasari Corridor to reach Palazzo Vecchio, where some of the movie’s most riveting scenes were shot.\n\nLocated in the heart of Florence in piazza della Signoria, the Salone dei Cinquecento is undoubtedly one of the most marvellous sights to behold in the city, with its ceiling providing a fabulous backdrop for one of the most fast-paced and suspenseful scenes. You’ll also find Dante’s funerary mask among its halls (usually in the Quartiere dei Priori), which plays a central role in the film’s storyline. In the Oltrarno, you won’t want to miss the Boboli Gardens, where drones are dodged and police evaded by sneaking into the Buontalenti Grotto.\n\nTea with Mussolini (1999)\n\nFranco Zeffirelli’s British-Italian flick from 1999 features stars like Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Lily Tomlin, Joan Plowright and Cher in the emotional story of a young Italian boy raised among a circle of British and American women living in Italy before and during the Second World War.\n\nFlorence and San Gimignano are the sites for some spectacular scenes, with the Cinecittà Studios in Rome (Latium) providing the backdrop for other shots. Set in 1930s fascist Italy, adolescent Luca (Charlie Lucas) has just lost his mother, and is sent by his callous father to be taken care of by British expatriate Mary Wallace (Joan Plowright). Mary and her cultured friends keep a watchful eye over the boy, before everything takes a turn with the declaration of war on Mussolini. Keep an eye out for the Duomo, the English Cemetery and the Uffizi Gallery, with stints to Siena and San Gimignano too.\n\nPortrait of a lady (1996)\n\n?Jane Campion’s dazzling film features a young Nicole Kidman in the main role, taking Henry James’ 1881 novel as its inspiration. Telling the story of the American Isabel, we follow the saga about her inheritance and arrival in late 19th century Florence. The Santa Maria del Fiore church in piazza del Duomo is where some of the scenes play out, with John Malcovich playing the adventurer Gilbert Osmond. While Florence doesn’t feature as frequently here as in the other films, it’s still a joy to see the city’s main symbol appear on screen with an award-winning cast in its midst.\n\nAn honorary mention goes to Netflix’s recent rom-com, Love & Gelato. The story details a young American woman searching for herself and her origins in Rome, with scenes in Florence’s fair city amping up the romance with shots of the medieval streets and stunning views as the two protagonists Lina and Lorenzo sashay around the city."
