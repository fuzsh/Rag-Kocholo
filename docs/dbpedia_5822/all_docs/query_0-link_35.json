        "text": "Ron Perlman is a classically-trained actor who has appeared in countless stage plays, feature films and television productions.\n\nRonald N. Perlman was born April 13, 1950 in Washington Heights, Manhattan, New York. His mother, Dorothy (Rosen), is retired from the City Clerk's Office. His father, Bertram \"Bert\" Perlman, now deceased, was a repairman and a drummer. His parents were both from Jewish families (from Hungary, Germany and Poland).\n\nWith a career spanning over three decades, Perlman has worked alongside such diverse actors as Marlon Brando, Sean Connery, Dominique Pinon, Brad Dourif, Ed Harris, John Hurt, Jude Law, Christina Ricci, Federico Luppi, Sigourney Weaver, Michael Wincott and Elijah Wood to name a few.\n\nWhile he has never been a bankable star, Perlman has always had a large fan-base. He started out strong as Amoukar, one of the tribesmen in Jean-Jacques Annaud's Academy Award-winning film Am Anfang war das Feuer (1981), for which he earned a Genie Award nomination. Perlman teamed up with Annaud again, this time as a hunchback named Salvatore in Der Name der Rose (1986). His first real breakthrough came later when he landed the role of the noble lion-man Vincent, opposite Linda Hamilton on the fantasy series Die Sch√∂ne und das Biest (1987). His work in this role earned him not only a Golden Globe Award but an underground fan following. Sadly the series was canceled in its third season shortly after Hamilton's character's death.\n\nAfter that, he spent time doing supporting work on television and independent films such as Guillermo del Toro's debut Cronos (1992) (where a lifelong friendship and collaboration between the director and Perlman would blossom) as Angel and his first lead role as One in Jean-Pierre Jeunet's surreal Die Stadt der verlorenen Kinder (1995). His first real big role in a mainstream film came when Jeunet wanted him for the brutish Johner in his first Hollywood outing Alien - Die Wiedergeburt (1997). Perlman has also used his distinctive voice to his advantage, appearing in many animated films/series, commercials and he is a video game fan favorite because of his work on such games as the Fallout series.\n\nIt was not until much later he received worldwide fame when his good friend Guillermo del Toro helped him land the title role in the big-budget comic book movie Hellboy (2004). Del Toro fought the studio for four years because they wanted a more secure name, but he stood his ground and in 2004, after almost 25 years in and out of obscurity, Perlman became a household name and a sought out actor. Perlman has had one of the most offbeat careers in film, playing everything from a prehistoric ape-man to an aging transsexual and will always be a rarity in Hollywood.\n\nOther notable roles include the cunning Norman Arbuthnot in Last Supper - Die Henkersmahlzeit (1995), sniper expert Koulikov in Duell: Enemy at the Gates (2001), vampire leader Reinhardt in Blade II (2002), his reprisal of Hellboy in Hellboy 2 - Die goldene Armee (2008) and biker chief Clarence Morrow on the popular series Sons of Anarchy (2008).\n\nHe currently resides in Los Angeles, California with his wife, Opal, and their two children, Blake and Brandon.\n\nOne of stage, screen and TV's finest transatlantic talents, slight, gravel-voiced, pasty-looking John Vincent Hurt was born on January 22, 1940, in Shirebrook, a coal mining village, in Derbyshire, England. The youngest child of Phyllis (Massey), an engineer and one-time actress, and Reverend Arnould Herbert Hurt, an Anglican clergyman and mathematician, his quiet shyness betrayed an early passion for acting. First enrolled at the Grimsby Art School and St. Martin's School of Art, his focus invariably turned from painting to acting.\n\nAccepted into the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1960, John made his stage debut in \"Infanticide in the House of Fred Ginger\" followed by \"The Dwarfs.\" Elsewhere, he continued to build upon his 60's theatrical career with theatre roles in \"Chips with Everything\" at the Vaudeville, the title role in \"Hamp\" at the Edinburgh Festival, \"Inadmissible Evidence\" at Wyndham's and \"Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs\" at the Garrick. His movie debut occurred that same year with a supporting role in the \"angry young man\" British drama The Wild and the Willing (1962), followed by small roles in Appuntamento in Riviera (1962), Ein Mann zu jeder Jahreszeit (1966) and Nur eine Frau an Bord (1967).\n\nA somber, freckled, ravaged-looking gent, Hurt found his more compelling early work in offbeat theatrical characterizations with notable roles such as Malcolm in \"Macbeth\" (1967), Octavius in \"Man and Superman\" (1969), Peter in \"Ride a Cock Horse\" (1972), Mike in '\"The Caretaker\" (1972) and Ben in \"The Dumb Waiter\" (1973). At the same time he gained more prominence in a spray of film and support roles such as a junior officer in Bevor der Winter kommt (1968), the title highwayman in Dave - zuhaus in allen Betten (1969), a morose little brother in In Search of Gregory (1969), a dim, murderous truck driver in John Christie, der Frauenw√ºrger von London (1971), a skirt-chasing, penguin-studying biologist in Mr. Forbush and the Penguins (1971), the unappetizing son of a baron in Der Rattenf√§nger von Hameln (1972) and a repeat of his title stage role as Little Malcolm and His Struggle Against the Eunuchs (1974).\n\nHurt shot to international stardom, however, on TV where he was allowed to display his true, fearless range. He reaped widespread acclaim for his embodiment of the tormented gay writer and raconteur Quentin Crisp in the landmark television play Wie man sein Leben lebt (1975), adapted from Crisp's autobiography. Hurt's bold, unabashed approach on the flamboyant and controversial gent who dared to be different was rewarded with the BAFTA (British TV Award). This triumph led to the equally fascinating success as the cruel and crazed Roman emperor Caligula in the epic television masterpiece Ich, Claudius, Kaiser & Gott (1976), followed by another compelling interpretation as murderous student Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment (1979).\n\nA resurgence occurred on film as a result. Among other unsurpassed portraits on his unique pallet, the chameleon in him displayed a polar side as the gentle, pathetically disfigured title role in Der Elefantenmensch (1980), and as a tortured Turkish prison inmate who befriends Brad Davis in the intense drama 12 Uhr nachts - Midnight Express (1978) earning Oscar nominations for both. Mainstream box-office films were offered as well as art films. He made the most of his role as a crew member whose body becomes host to an unearthly predator in Alien: Das unheimliche Wesen aus einer fremden Welt (1979). With this new rush of fame came a few misguided ventures as well that were generally unworthy of his talent. Such brilliant work as his steeple chase jockey in Sein gr√∂√üter Sieg (1984) or kidnapper in The Hit - Die Profi-Killer (1984) was occasionally offset by such drivel as the comedy misfire Zwei irre Typen auf hei√üer Spur (1982) with Ryan O'Neal in which Hurt looked enervated and embarrassed. For the most part, the craggy-faced actor continued to draw extraordinary notices. Tops on the list includes his prurient governmental gadfly who triggers the Christine Keeler political sex scandal in the aptly-titled Scandal (1989); the cultivated gay writer aroused and obsessed with struggling \"pretty-boy\" actor Jason Priestley in Leben und Tod auf Long Island (1997); and the Catholic priest embroiled in the Rwanda atrocities in Shooting Dogs (2005).\n\nLatter parts of memorable interpretations included Dr. Iannis in Corellis Mandoline (2001), the recurring role of the benign wand-maker Mr. Ollivander in Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen (2001) and Harry Potter und die Heiligt√ºmer des Todes - Teil 1 (2010), the tyrannical dictator Adam Sutler in V wie Vendetta (2005) and the voice of The Dragon in Merlin - Die neuen Abenteuer (2008). Among Hurt's final film appearances were as a terminally ill screenwriter in That Good Night (2017) and a lesser role in the mystery thriller Die Damaskus Verschw√∂rung - Spion zwischen den Fronten (2017). Hurt's voice was also tapped into animated features and documentaries, often serving as narrator. He also returned to the theatre performing in such shows as \"The Seagull\", \"A Month in the Country\" (1994), \"Afterplay\" (2002) and \"Krapp's Last Tape\", the latter for which he received the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award.\n\nA recovered alcoholic who married four times, Hurt was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by the Queen in 2004, and Knight Bachelor of the Order of the British Empire in 2015. That same year (2015) he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. In July of 2016, he was forced to bow out of the father role of Billy Rice in a then-upcoming London stage production of \"The Entertainer\" opposite Kenneth Branagh due to ill health that he described as an \"intestinal ailment\". Hurt died several months later at his home in Cromer, Norfolk, England on January 15, 2017, three days after his 77th birthday.\n\nKarel Roden is an internationally known actor who was most recently seen in the United States in director Jaume Collet-Serra's \"Orphan,\" starring Vera Farmiga and Peter Sarsgaard, and in Guy Ritchie's \"RocknRolla,\" opposite Gerard Butler, Tom Wilkinson and Thandie Newton. His work can also be seen in such films as the hit comedy \"Mr. Bean's Vacation,\" starring Rowan Atkinson; Wayne Kramer's \"Running Scared,\" opposite Paul Walker and Vera Farmiga; Paul Greengrass' wildly successful \"The Bourne Supremacy,\" the second film in the franchise starring Matt Damon; Guillermo del Toro's comics-based action thrillers \"Hellboy\" and \"Blade II\"; \"Bulletproof Monk,\" starring Chow Yun-Fat and Seann William Scott; and \"15 Minutes,\" starring Robert De Niro and Edward Burns.\n\nRoden has been nominated several times and recently won a prestigious Czech Lion Award for Best Actor for his work in the film \"Guard No. 47,\" produced in his native country, the Czech Republic. He has acted in numerous Czech films, including \"Jm√©nem kr√°le\"; \"The Eye\"; \"Holka Ferrari Dino\"; \"Bathory\"; \"Little Girl Blue\"; \"Bestiar\"; \"Vaterland - Loveck√Ω den√≠k\"; and \"Wild Flowers.\" Roden has also acted in a variety of films produced throughout Europe, including France's \"Largo Winch,\" from director J√©r√¥me Salle and starring Kristin Scott Thomas; Spain's \"The Abandoned,\" Poland's \"Summer Love\"; and the UK's \"Shut Up and Shoot Me\" and \"The Last Drop.\" He appeared as himself in Jan Nemec's documentary \"Late Night Talks with Mother.\"\n\nOn the small screen, Roden has appeared in the US series \"The Philanthropist,\" the UK series \"MI-5\" and \"The Scarlet Pimpernel,\" and in countless Czech productions, including the series \"Trapasy\" and the telepic \"A Christmas Tale.\"\n\nA graduate of the Prague Dramatic Academy of Fine Arts, Roden hails from a long tradition of Czech actors: his younger brother, Marian, is also an actor, and both men followed in the footsteps of their father and grandfather. Roden's upcoming films include the horror thriller \"Andrassy Street 60.,\" opposite Talia Shire and Barry Corbin; the German period drama \"Habermann\"; and \"Alois Nebel,\" an animated feature from the Czech Republic.\n\nNorman Reedus was born in Hollywood, Florida. He is of Italian, English, Scottish and Irish descent. He is an accomplished photographer with several books of his photography published and continues to do art shows in galleries all around the world every year. His first novel was published in 2022 and was on the New York Times best seller list as well as the Los Angeles Times best seller list titled \"The Ravaged\". Reedus has a production company named Bigbaldhead, Inc. With his producing partner Amanda Verdon as well as a first look deal with AMC studios.\n\nNorman's first movie as an actor was Guillermo del Toro's horror thriller Mimic - Angriff der Killerinsekten (1997), where he played the character Jeremy. He has also played roles in the movies Floating (1997), Six Ways to Sunday (1997), T√∂dliche Ger√ºchte (2000), Blade II (2002) and Deuces Wild - Wild in den Stra√üen (2002). He also starred in the movies Red Canyon (2008), Robert Redford's Die Lincoln Verschw√∂rung (2010), and John Hillcoat's Triple 9 (2016). Norman played the role of Murphy MacManus in the movie Der blutige Pfad Gottes (1999) opposite Sean Patrick Flanery and Willem Dafoe. He later reprised the role in the sequel Der blutige Pfad Gottes 2 (2009).\n\nHis directorial debut happened in 2005 for the multi-awarded short film on Miles Davis I Thought of You (2006).\n\nAs of 2010, he stars as Daryl Dixon on the AMC television series The Walking Dead (2010). The character was not originally in the comic book series of the same name, but was created specifically for Reedus by Frank Darabont. The Walking Dead comic creator Robert Kirkman has stated he feels \"absolutely blessed [Reedus] has honored the show with his presence, and the way he has come in and taken over that role and defined Daryl Dixon. A great deal of Norman's portrayal of the character in the first season inspired all the writers to do what we did with him in the second season. We love writing him and end up doing cool stuff with him.\"\n\nLuke Goss started his acting career playing 'Danny Zuko' in the smash hit musical Grease, on London's West End, and later toured with the production throughout the United Kingdom. He established himself as a screen actor in 2002 with performances in two very different features: David Goyer's independent drama ZigZag, with John Leguizamo, Oliver Platt, Natasha Lyonne and Wesley Snipes; and Guillermo Del Toro's supernatural action feature Blade II, with Snipes and Ron Perlman. The following year, he starred in the title role of the critically acclaimed British gangster film Charlie, and in the role of the monster in the Emmy Award-winning Hallmark miniseries Frankenstein, with Donald Sutherland and William Hurt. In 2005, Goss traveled to India to play the role of King Xerxes in the Biblical epic One Night With The King, opposite Omar Sharif and Peter O'Toole, firmly establishing him as a versatile actor. He then went on to star in The Man, with Samuel L. Jackson and Eugene Levy; Mercenary, with Steven Seagal; Bone Dry, with Lance Henriksen; Unearthed, with Emmanuelle Vaugier; Deep Winter, with Michael Madsen; and Shanghai Baby, with Bai Ling. 2008 reunited Goss with Guillermo Del Toro in Universals Hellboy II: The Golden Army, the sequel that opened in the number one spot at the U.S. box office. The role earned Goss 2 MTV Movie Award nominations. He had the starring role in Tekken, a sci-fi feature thriller based on the popular video and arcade game. He has completed filming his first role for Network Television in JJ Abrams \"Fringe\". Luke has also played leading roles in Across The Line, Blood Out, and has taken over Universals Death Race franchise, firmly establishing him as a leading man.\n\nHe was born in Lewisham, London, to Carol (Read) and Alan Goss.\n\nMar√≠a Bel√©n Rueda Garc√≠a-Porrero (born March 16, 1965) is a Spanish actress. She is best known for her roles as Luc√≠a in the TV series Los Serrano (2003); as Julia in Das Meer in mir (2004), for which she won a Goya Award; and as Laura in Das Waisenhaus (2007), for which she received another Goya Award nomination. Most recently she played the lead role in the movie Julia's Eyes (2010).\n\nRueda was born in Madrid. Her father was a civil engineer and her mother was a ballet instructor. She is the second of three children; her siblings are named Mar√≠a Jes√∫s (Chus) and Alfonso. She and her family moved to San Juan, Alicante when she was a child. When Rueda was 18 years old she moved to Madrid to study architecture, but she left the university when she met an Italian man whom she later married.\n\nRueda returned to Madrid and worked as a salesperson and a model until she became a TV presenter. After that she worked as an actress on television, including the show Los Serrano (2003), and eventually acted in films. She won a Goya Award in 2004 for her role as Julia in Das Meer in mir (2004). She received another Goya nomination for her role in the 2007 film, Das Waisenhaus (2007). Rueda played the lead role of the Spanish thriller Julia's Eyes (2010), which was produced by Guillermo del Toro. She also starred in Oriol Paulo's thriller The Body - Die Leiche (2012).\n\nRetired Canadian professional wrestler turned actor. Trained under Bret Hart, Leo Burke and Stephen Petitpas. Debuted in 1989 as the Acadian Giant for Atlantic Grand Prix Wrestling. Competed for years in Canada, Japan and South Korea, using the name Goliath El Gigante. Arrived in the U.S. in 1997 as the Interrogator of the Truth Commission, a team with the gimmick of a South African white supremacist paramilitary group, with the name being a reference to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The Truth Commission (The Interrogator and Recon (Barry Buchanan)) were 3x USWA (United States Wrestling Association in Memphis) World Tag Team Champions. The Truth Commission (Interrogator, Recon, Sniper [Luc Poirier] and manager the Commandant (Robin Smith) debuted in WWE as heels (Smith was replaced by the Jackyl (Don Callis) in September). After the Jackyl took over the group, they evolved into more of a commando cult. Maillet was reintroduced on the December 8, 1997 \"WWF Raw Is War\" as Kurrgan, a name taken from Highlander: Es kann nur einen geben (1986). Kurrgan and the Jackyl broke away from the Truth Commission, effectively ending the group. Kurrgan was built up as a monster heel, crushing his opponents with his claw hold the Paralyzer. He entered the 1998 Royal Rumble at #12. He eliminated Headbanger Mosh and Steve Blackman, and it took five guys, 8-Ball, Bradshaw, Ken Shamrock, Phineas I. Godwinn and the Rock, to eliminate him. He disappeared for a few months until he returned as a member of the Jackyl's new stable the Oddities on the June 15th \"WWF Raw is War.\" After the Jackyl was replaced by Sable (Rena Lesnar) and the Insane Clown Posse joined the group, Kurrgan became a face (good guy) for the first time in his U.S. career. The Oddities by the end of 1998 were reduced to Kurrgan, Golga (John Tenta), the Giant Silva (Paulo Silva) and George 'The Animal' Steele and were jobbed out (lost all their matches) on the weekend B-shows \"WWF Jakked\" and \"WWF Sunday Night Heat\" and were all released in early 1999. Continued to compete in Canada and elsewhere before retiring and focusing on acting. He is also a former 2x ECCW (Extreme Canadian Championship Wrestling in British Columbia, Canada) Heavyweight Champion.\n\nMira Katherine Sorvino was born on September 28, 1967 in Manhattan. She is the daughter of Lorraine Davis, an actress turned drama therapist, and veteran character actor Paul Sorvino. Her father's family were Italian immigrants. The young Sorvino was intelligent, an avid reader and an exceptional scholar. Her father discouraged her from becoming an actor, as he knew how the industry often chews up young stars. She attended Harvard, majoring in Chinese, graduating magna cum laude in 1989, largely on the strength of her thesis, a Hoopes Prize-winning thesis on racial conflict in China, written and researched during the year spent in Beijing, which helped her fluency in Mandarin Chinese.\n\nHowever, she showed interest in a career in acting from an early age, and moved to New York City to try her hand in the City's film industry, waitressing, auditioning and working at the Tribeca production company of Robert De Niro. She succeeded in getting a little television work in the early 1990s, but got her first film job in the independent gangster movie Unter Freunden (1993), on which she worked her way up the ladder behind the camera to eventually associate-produce the film, and, more importantly, was eventually cast as the female lead. The indie production was well-received, and Sorvino's performance attracted enough buzz to get her cast in two more movies, one a more prominent indie, Barcelona (1994), the other her first Hollywood feature, Quiz Show (1994), and her skillful performances brought her yet more attention.\n\nAn exceptionally poised and articulate young woman, she may have seemed inappropriate to play a crazy hooker, but Woody Allen took the chance, and her magnificent performance as the female lead in his Geliebte Aphrodite (1995) proved her range as a performer and earned her an Oscar (at the tender age of 29) for Best Supporting Actress. Since winning the Oscar, Sorvino has continued to take a wide range of roles, including another stretch as Marilyn Monroe in Marilyn - Ihr Leben (1996), co-starring with another very intelligent and skilled young actress, Ashley Judd. Forays into action and horror, such as Mimic - Angriff der Killerinsekten (1997) and The Replacement Killers - Die Ersatzkiller (1998) show that Sorvino is not above being playful in the film roles she chooses.\n\nHowever, what forever cemented her role in popular culture was her performance as charmingly silly California beach girl Romy White in Romy und Michele (1997), in which she and co-star Lisa Kudrow utter one hilarious absurdity after another.\n\nMira Sorvino married Christopher Backus on June 11, 2004, and the couple have four children.\n\nRugged features and a natural charm have worked for Josh Brolin, the son of actor James Brolin. He has played roles as a policeman, a hunter, and the President of the United States.\n\nBrolin was born February 12, 1968 in Santa Monica, California, to Jane Cameron (Agee), a Texas-born wildlife activist, and James Brolin. Josh was not interested at first in the lifestyle of the entertainment business, in light of his parents' divorce, and both of them being actors. However, during junior year in high school, he took an acting class to see what it was like. He played Stanley in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and became hooked. His first major screen role was as the older brother in the film Die Goonies (1985), based on a story by Steven Spielberg. He then immediately moved on to work on television, taking roles on such series as Pilot (1987) and Die jungen Reiter (1989). \"Private Eye\" was a chance for Brolin to play a detective. \"The Young Riders\" was set just before the Civil War, and was co-directed by Brolin's father, James Brolin.\n\nAfter Die jungen Reiter (1989), Brolin moved back to the big screen, with mediocre success. He played a supporting role in Roadflower (1994), but the film was not a success. He followed up with the crime film Killer Cops - M√∂rder in Uniform (1996), the romantic film Das Rosenbett (1996), the thriller film Freeze - Alptraum Nachtwache (1997), and appeared with his father in Brothers in Arms (1997). However, nothing truly stuck out, especially not the box office flop Mod Squad - Cops auf Zeit (1999). The 2000s initially brought no significant change in Brolin's career. He appeared in the independent film Slow Burn - In der Hitze der W√ºste (2000), the sci-if thriller Hollow Man - Unsichtbare Gefahr (2000) and starred on the television series Mister Sterling (2003). In 2004, he married actress Diane Lane but later divorced in 2013.\n\nIt was not until 2007 that Brolin received much acclaim for his films. He took a supporting role in the Quentin Tarantino-written Grindhouse (2007) which was a two-part film accounting two horror stories. He also played two policemen that year: corrupt officer Nick Trupo in the crime epic American Gangster (2007), and an honest police chief in the emotional drama Im Tal von Elah (2007) which starred Tommy Lee Jones and was directed by Paul Haggis. However, it was his involvement in No Country for Old Men (2007) that truly pushed him into the limelight. The film, directed by the Coen brothers, was about a man (Brolin) who finds a satchel containing two million dollars in cash. He is pursued by an unstoppable assassin (Javier Bardem, who won an Oscar for his work) and his friend, a local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones). The film won four Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director.\n\nBrolin found high-profile work the next year, being cast as Supervisor Dan White in the film Milk (2008). His performance as the weak and bitter politician earned him an Oscar nomination, and Brolin received more praise for his fascinating portrayal of George W. Bush in the Oliver Stone film W.: Ein missverstandenes Leben (2008). Despite the mediocre success of W.: Ein missverstandenes Leben (2008), he was recognized as the best part of the film, and Milk (2008) was another triumph, critically and commercially.\n\nBrolin then acted in the smaller comedy Women in Trouble (2009) before landing a number of large roles in 2010. The first of these was the film based on the comic book figure Jonah Hex (2010). The film was a box office flop and critically panned, but Brolin also forged a second collaboration with legendary director Oliver Stone for Wall Street: Geld schl√§ft nicht (2010). Brolin played a large role alongside such young stars as Carey Mulligan and Shia LaBeouf, and older thespians such as Michael Douglas, Eli Wallach, and Frank Langella. Brolin's character was Bretton James, a top banker in the film, and also the film's chief antagonist. Brolin also appeared in Woody Allen's London-based film Ich sehe den Mann deiner Tr√§ume (2010) and a second collaboration with the Coen Brothers, which was a remake of Der Marshal (1969).\n\nDespite his earlier mediocre success and fame, Brolin has maintained a choosiness in his films and, recently, these choices have paid off profoundly. Hopefully, he continues this streak of good fortune that his talents have finally given him.\n\nGiancarlo Giannini is an Oscar-nominated Italian actor, director and multilingual dubber who made an international reputation for his leading roles in Italian films as well as for his mastery of a variety of languages and dialects.\n\nHe was born August 1, 1942, in La Spezia, Italy. For 10 years he lived and studied in Naples, earning a degree in electronics. At 18 he enrolled in the Academy of Dramatic Art D'Amico in Rome and made his stage acting debut there. His credits included performances in contemporary Italian plays as well, as in Italian productions of William Shakespeare's plays \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"A Midsummer's Night Dream\". In 1965 he made his television debut starring as David Copperfield in the TV miniseries made by RAI ,the Italian national TV company. He made his big-screen debut in Libido (1965), a Freudian psychological thriller. Since 1966 he has been in a successful collaboration with legendary Italian director Lina Wertm√ºller, who made several award-winning films with Giannini as a male lead. He appears as peasant Tonino who prepares to assassinate dictator Benito Mussolini in Liebe und Anarchie (1973), as a sailor in the irony-laden comedy Hingerissen von einem ungew√∂hnlichen Schicksal im azurblauen Meer im August (1974), and as a concentration-camp survivor in the Oscar-nominated Sieben Sch√∂nheiten (1975). He also starred as a Jewish musician arrested by the Nazis in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's masterpiece Lili Marleen (1981).\n\nGiannini also made a reputation for dubbing international stars in films released on the Italian market, such as Jack Nicholson, Al Pacino, Michael Douglas, Dustin Hoffman, G√©rard Depardieu, and Ian McKellen, among others. He received a compliment from Stanley Kubrick for his dubbing of Nicholson in Shining (1980). Giannini's fluency in English and his mastery of dialects has brought him a number of supporting roles in Hollywood productions, such as Dem Himmel so nah (1995), Hannibal (2001), Darkness (2002), and Mann unter Feuer (2004), among many others. He appears as Rene Mathis in the 21st James Bond film Casino Royale (2006), and reprises the role in the sequel, James Bond 007: Ein Quantum Trost (2008).\n\nAcademy Award-winning actor F. Murray Abraham was born on October 24, 1939 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and raised in El Paso, Texas. His father, Fred Abraham, was a Syrian (Antiochian Orthodox Christian) immigrant. His mother, Josephine (Stello) Abraham, was the daughter of Italian immigrants. Born with the first name \"Murray\", he added an \"F.\" to distinguish his stage name.\n\nPrimarily a stage actor, Abraham made his screen debut as an usher in George C. Scott's comedy Der verkehrte Sherlock Holmes (1971). By the mid-1970s, Murray had steady employment as an actor, doing commercials and voice-over work. He can be seen as one of the undercover police officers along with Al Pacino in Sidney Lumet's Serpico (1973), and in television roles including the villain in one third-season episode of Einsatz in Manhattan (1973). His film work of those years also included the roles of a cabdriver in Das Nervenb√ºndel (1975), a mechanic in Die Sunny-Boys (1975), and a police officer in Alle M√§nner des Pr√§sidenten (1976).\n\nBeyond these small roles, Abraham continued to do commercials and voice-over work for income. But in 1978, he decided to give them up. Frustrated with the lack of substantial roles, Abraham said, \"No one was taking my acting seriously. I figured if I didn't do it, then I'd have no right to the dreams I've always had\". His wife, Kate Hannan, went to work as an assistant and Abraham became a \"house husband\". He described, \"I cooked and cleaned and took care of the kids. It was very rough on my macho idea of life. But it was the best thing that ever happened to me\". Abraham appeared as drug dealer Omar Su√°rez alongside Pacino again in the gangster film Scarface (1983). He also gained visibility voicing a talking bunch of grapes in a series of television commercials for Fruit of the Loom underwear.\n\nIn 1985, he was honored with as Academy Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for the acclaimed role of envious composer Antonio Salieri in Amadeus (1984), an award for which Tom Hulce, playing Mozart in that movie, had also been nominated. He was also honored with a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama, among other awards, and his role in the film, is still considered to be his most iconic as the film's director Milos Forman inspired the work of the role with Abraham's wide range of qualities as a great stage and film actor.\n\nAfter Amadeus, he next appeared in Der Name der Rose (1986), in which he played Bernardo Gui, nemesis to Sir Sean Connery as William of Baskerville. In the DVD audio commentary, his director on the film, Jean-Jacques Annaud, described Abraham as an \"egomaniac\" on the set, who considered himself more important than Sean Connery, since Connery did not have an Oscar. That said, the film was a critical success. Abraham had tired of appearing as villains and wanted to return to his background in comedy, as he also explained to People Weekly magazine in an interview he gave at the time of its release.\n\nJulian Richings was born and raised in Oxford, England, and is one of three boys. All pursued careers in professional theatre: his older brother is a set designer, and his younger brother is a lighting designer. After graduating from the University of Exeter Drama Department in 1977, he performed extensively in theatres throughout the UK. In 1980 he toured internationally in a highly acclaimed adaptation of James Joyce's Ulysses with resident spells in New York, Chicago, Toronto and Grotowski's Teatr Laboritorium in Wroclaw, Poland. Julian settled in North America in 1984 and became an established presence in Toronto's theatre and film scene, assuming roles in three landmark independent films; The Red Violin, Cube and Hard Core Logo. The latter, directed by Bruce McDonald in 1996, is ranked among the greatest Canadian films of all time, in which Julian played the bitter punk legend Bucky Haight. He continued to work frequently with Bruce McDonald and reprised the role in Hard Core Logo 2 almost fifteen years later. Julian worked with Special Effects legend Stan Winston on Wrong Turn (2003) and applied his physical theatre skills to create the terrifying role of Three Finger. Although he only appeared in the original movie, five subsequent films were made in what became a highly successful horror franchise. He has since become a familiar figure in horror and genre films, collaborating with indie trailblazers Foresight Features and Black Fawn Films. With Vortex Productions, he starred in Anything For Jackson, for which he received a BITS (Blood In The Snow) Award. He has also appeared in Robert Eggers' The Witch and Ari Aster's Beau Is Afraid for A24 films and the blockbusters X-Men 3, Man of Steel, and Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief. In Percy Jackson, he is the only actor to have appeared in both the movie (as Charon) and the Disney series (Crusty). Among his hundreds of television appearances, Julian is perhaps best known for recurring roles in Stephen King's Kingdom Hospital (Otto), Patriot (Peter Ichabod) and perhaps most significantly as the Grim Reaper in Supernatural (Death). Over the years, due to his portrayals of various vampires, creatures and aliens, together with many a spectacular onscreen demise, Julian has enjoyed collaborating with special effects teams worldwide, spending many hours in makeup and prosthetics. At one particularly busy phase of his career, his severed head was prominently displayed on the walls of half a dozen special effects shops across North America. Julian is always happy to meet fans, share his many stories from working in the industry for almost fifty years, and simply discuss his love of performing. He has become a favourite guest at ComicCons and Fan Conventions.\n\nWesley Trent Snipes was born in Orlando, Florida, to Marian (Long), a teacher's assistant, and SMSGT Wesley Rudolph Snipes, an aircraft engineer. He grew up on the streets of the South Bronx in New York City, where he very early decided that dance and the theatre were to be his career. He attended the High School for the Performing Arts (popularized in Fame - Der Weg zum Ruhm (1980)). But dreams of the musical theater (and maybe a few commercials) faded when his mother moved to Orlando, Florida before he could graduate. Fortune would have it that he along with two friends and his \"Drama class\" teachers Mr. S Porro and K. Rugerio, would start a bus-n-truck theatre company (Struttin Street Stuff) be instrumental in his high schools (Jones High) induction into the International Thespian Society, Orlando Chapter and help lay the foundation for what would become Dr. Phillips High Schools theatre arts program. Musical theatre rooted Snipes performed song-n-dance, puppetry, and acrobatics in city parks, dinner clubs, and performing arts centers around central Florida. As a recipient of a Victor Borge Scholarship, Snipes left Orlando and entered the world-renowned professional theatre arts program at SUNY Purchase in New York, now Purchase College, where he honed his theatrical performance and martial arts skills. Graduating with a BFA, he went on to co-star in a few soap operas and nighttime dramas, peppered in between critical acclaim performances Broadway. It was there in a Broadway theater An agent saw him on stage and invited him to audition for his first feature film role.\n\nGoldie Hawn American Wildcats (1986). Athletic roles such as that gave way to dramatic roles such as that gave way to tough guy roles as in New Jack City (1991), and to the action hero in Passagier 57 (1992). Wesley feels that at least with the Hollywood heavyweights he must be doing something right - Sylvester Stallone, Robert De Niro, Dennis Hopper and Sean Connery all had veto power over casting and all approved his role. Wesley also founded Amen Ra Films Production Company, and is a Multi System Combat Arts Black Belt Holder IT Technologist & VC.\n\nKris Kristofferson was born in Brownsville, Texas, to Mary Ann (Ashbrook) and Lars Henry Kristofferson. His paternal grandparents were Swedish, and his father was a United States Air Force general who pushed his son to a military career. Kris was a Golden Gloves boxer and went to Pomona College in California. From there, he earned a Rhodes scholarship to study literature at Oxford University. He ultimately joined the United States Army and achieved the rank of captain. He became a helicopter pilot, which served him well later. In 1965, he resigned his commission to pursue songwriting. He had just been assigned to become a teacher at USMA West Point. He got a job sweeping floors in Nashville studios. There he met Johnny Cash, who initially took some of his songs but ignored them. He was also working as a commercial helicopter pilot at the time. He got Cash's attention when he landed his helicopter in Cash's yard and gave him some more tapes. Cash then recorded Kristofferson's \"Sunday Morning Coming Down\", which was voted the 1970 Song of the Year by the Country Music Association. Kris was noted for his heavy boozing. He lost his helicopter pilot job when he passed out at the controls, and his drinking ruined his marriage to singer Rita Coolidge, when he was reaching a bottle and half of Jack Daniels daily. He gave up alcohol in 1976. His acting career nose-dived after making Heaven's Gate - Das Tor zum Himmel (1980). In recent years, he has made a comeback with his musical and acting careers. He does say that he prefers his music, but says his children are his true legacy."
