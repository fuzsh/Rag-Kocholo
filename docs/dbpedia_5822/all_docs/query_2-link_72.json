        "meta_description": "..Famed for its beautiful countryside and quintessential medieval towns, it comes as no surprise that Tuscany has been used as the backdrop for many movies, both Italian and international. The appeal is understandable; thousands of tourists come to Tuscan every year to witness the scenes so often captured in the movies for themselves. It is the fusion of nature combined with slight touches of man made structures perfectly mixed that continues to make the Tuscan countryside a top tourist destination year after year. It is this same appeal that continues to draw directors to shoot their movies here. Hundreds, if not thousands of movies have been shot in Tuscany, from the Technicolor movies of the fifties to the more recent films such as The Gladiator and Life is Beautiful that have received international acclaim… The following list of movies is just a small representation of what is out there, but they capture the essence of Tuscany and certainly celebrate the beauty found around every corner in this unique and exquisite area. Contact us for a customized itinerary to visit some of these unforgettable locations…!",
