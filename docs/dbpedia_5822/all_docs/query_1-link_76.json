        "text": "Post by hugobolso on\n\nForeign Language actors that surprsingly said no to Hollywood.-\n\n90 years ago was this was common, because most of the foreign language stars didn't speak English or have a heavy accent, and were afraid of being typecasted in servants or exotic roles, where in their countries they offered the best roles for the same or even more money.-\n\nHollywood wanted for huge stars like Mexican Maria Felix or Argentine Actress-Singer Libertad Lamarque both decline were easily replaced by Kathy Jurado and Carmen Miranda, but these actresses mostly had supporting roles.\n\nThe best decade for foreign actors were the 50s and 60s, them the Hollywood System collapsed,and was hard for a foreign language actor making a large and profitable Hollywood career. The biggest French starts like Adjani or Huppert, return quickly from their short Americane Adventure. Things get better in the 90s thanks to Miramax, Antonio Banderas, Penelope Cruz, Javier Bardem, Marion Cotillard, Salma Hayek become Oscar winners or nominees and had a long Hollywood career. Others like Franca Potente, Daniel Brühl, Ziyi Zhang, Diane Krugger, Michelle Yeoh, Diego Luna, Gael García Bernal.Rodrigo Santoro are Hollywood stars.-\n\nBut today, is easier for foreign actors, because most had learned english, or at least understand, or Hollywood provides good vocal coaches, to speak english phonetically.\n\nSo now at days should be unusual that worldwide beloved are saying no to Hollywood, but isn't.-\n\nSo should be great if you can name actors and actresses, that you think should have a great Hollywood career, and why you think they are stay saying no.-\n\nPost by hugobolso on\n\nProbably the actor that surprise me never ever made Hollywood films, was italian actor Kim Rossi Stuart.\n\nHis father Giacomo, a former athlete, was one of the first italian actors from the Actor's Studios, his mother was¿ an scottish woman (Kim Grandma), and work in several Hollywood movies from big budget films to horror lowbudget ones in coproduction between US and Italy. His mother was a top model of German and Dutch descent .-\n\nSo clearly Kim has no trouble with English language, and with that DNA it wasn't a surprise that started in films and TV at a young age, also one of his first film was as an extra In the Name of the Rose, an European Co-production staring Sean Connery, F. Murray Abram and Chritian Slater.\n\nHis next films and TV proyects were italian ones, but filmed for US Markets, some even shooted in US with hollywood stars or US and English actors (Briggite Nielsen, Janet Agren).\n\nOne of this was the highly succesful italian version of Karate Kid, I Il ragazzo dal kimono d'oro (Karate Warrior) that made him a huge star before his 18 birthday. His karate skill were poor, but the teen actor was tall, handsome and with blue eyes and an enigmatic face, and could act extremely well for his age.-\n\nHe had everything to be the next Cannon star. OK, today sounds like a joke, but Jean Claude Van Damme, Chuck Norris started there.\n\nBut he prefered made supporting roles any kind of italian series and miniseries of very different quality (from the big budget all cast Garibaldi to the Softcore comic adaptation of Valentina, and the Mob Drama Il Ricatto) until he had the main role of Prince Romualdo, in Lamberto Bava's Fantaghiro TV, a sword and sourcery fantasy TV movies about the warrior princess Fantaghiro (Alessandra Martines), that become It's Wonderful Life/The Wizard of Oz of Italian Christmas Movies.\n\nAfter that he had several leading or coleading roles in TV and Films, that exploted his sex symbol statu, and eclipsed his famous father. He died In 1994, a time in which Kim decide that only would work in quality films, TV Series and theatre and soon paid off nationally and internationally, in 1994 made no skin in 1996 was the youth lead of Beyond the Clouds Michelangelo Antonioni and Wim Wenders.\n\nThe next role was Julien Sorel in the French television film The Red and the Black (Le Rouge et le Noir) in 1997, based upon the novel of the same name by Stendhal, staring Carole Buquet and future french lady Juliette Govroche.\n\nThen was Jesus, and finally in 2002,probably his more famous film in America. The infamous Pinochio staring Roberto Benigni, however Kim Rossi Stuart received critical acclaim as Lucingolo, in fact he stealed the show there.-\n\nIn between he made a lot of Shakespeare on italian theatre (King Lear, Hamlet, MacBeth), also more modern plays like God in Il Visitor with trully rave reviews.-\n\nWith the new millenium, he made films much more mature roles with Charlotte Rampling (Le chiavi di casa/The Keys of the House), he was awarded for his directing debut in Anche Libero Va Benne, but were the politiziacco/Mob films directed by Michel Placido Romanzo Criminale and Vallanzasca that made him popular in the extint IMDB boards.\n\nAfter that he made very few but prestige (maybe too qualite) movies and tv series.-\n\nSo the big question, and maybe an italian guy or girl could answer, is how a such complete actor, that has everything that an american director dreams, never made a Hollywood movie.\n\nRaoul Bova, and Pierfrancesco Favino that are around KRS age have an interestig Hollywood career, Bova have the look, Favino the talent, and Rossi Stuart both.-\n\nthe next italian generation Riccardo Scamarcio and Elio Germano also made Hollywood movies, and right now are among bussiest Netflix actors.\n\nSeveral actresses like Valeria Golino, Maria Grazzia Cucinotta, Monica Bellucci, Giovanna Mezzagiorno, Violante Placido, Valentina Cervi also around KRS age also made Hollywood films with different luck, but all worked with Oscar winners and nominees actors.-\n\nI think it's a pitty that none in Hollywood offered a role in an A Hollywood movie, or maybe he was offered but he rejected, still a pitty.\n\nHe could portray the Suave european, as an answer of the rough Javier Bardem.-\n\nIf his English is good, he even could take every rol that Micheal Fassbender turns down.-\n\nStill he looks very happy with his trully stunning wife Illaria Spada and his two children.-\n\nPost by hugobolso on\n\nJulia Jentch.\n\nGermany films rocked at the begining of the new millenium, with great movies and specially great acting vehicles for young people.\n\nFranka Potente become a huge european star after Run, Lola, Run, and for a brief shot of time, was Hollywood next best thing, Hollywood darling.\n\nBut not just Potente, an almost unknown german actress named Diane Kruger got most wanted Hollywood rol. Helen of\n\nTroy in Troy, after it, even when the movie and her performance receive mixed reviews,\n\nKruger career exploted in Hollywood and France!!! The National Treasure films were highly succeful, and was one of Tarantino leading in inglorious Bastards\n\nShe even was nominated a SAG awards, and won best actress in Cannes. She had long relatioship with leding actors (Cannet, Jackson, Reedus).-\n\nAlexandra Maria Lara (German-Rumanian), Mrs. Sam Riley, is a much more low profile actress, but after the Downfall she made important films Hollywood films with A directors like Ron Howard or Francis Ford Coppola.\n\nAnd finally German-Turkish Sibill Kekilli, who started in hardcore films, then was an awarded german actress, and finally a GOT Star.-\n\nFor unknown reasons Julia Jentsch hasn't the same love. And her case is even stranger than Kim Rossi Stuart.-\n\nAfter teenage and juvenil roles in 2004 her career took of with the Edukators staring Daniel Brühl, Brühl was at the time (and probably still is) the most requested european actor, the film was a smash hit, a film for the new german youth, and Jentsch received not just rave reviews but also the role of her lifetime after it. The last Days of Julia Scholl the last day, she received the silver lion in Berlin and the European Film for best actress. The film also received an Academy Award Nomination for best Foreign film.-\n\nBased on a true story of a pacifist antinazi student who was executed by the 3 Reich. Is Jentsch perfomace the trully standout, as the stony activist, a marvelous, maybe right now try to don't share emotions is the common thing on films, but this stoic performance was a surprise in 2005.-\n\nSpecially a very different one from the Edukators.\n\nWith such success and recognition, she should have a huge career in Hollywood or Europe. After all, Run, Lola, Run wasn't Oscar nominated, or received a huge award, Kruger was still consider more a beauty than an actress, and Lara was still in a low profile.\n\nBut nothing happened, not even in the big European countries UK, France, Italy and Spain in that order.\n\nShe won a couple of german award for her next film a czech one named the King of England directed by Jiří Menzel. And then just TV movies, miniseries, and theatres, usually not even in the leading rol.\n\nEven in Germany, she had a very tiny rol in the family film Kokowääh 2, directed by Germay box office champion Til Schweiger, staring Til and his daughter.-\n\nIn the last couple of year apparently she had a reborn in Germany, she started to receive critical acclaim and awards first on tv and then on films, specially with the controversial subject 24 weeks.-\n\nBut I'm not German, I don't know if the German cinema, is as strong, as was in the first years of the new millenium, not even know if Jentsch is a star there, or maybe just an obscure actress, that made a couple of popular films.-\n\nWe can argue that she isn't as big as Brühl because he is a man, but several actress of her age (not just the Hollywood starlest named previously), have at least an interesting career on Hollywood or not German Europe.-\n\nSo should be nice, if someone could tell us a little more about this still young actress, that I thought she would be the next foreign it girl.-\n\nPost by MsMovieStar on\n\nOh honey, Carmen Miranda's story is really tragic. I believe she would have been a much happier person if she had stayed in Brazil where she was already a big star.\n\nShe was seduced by $$$$$ and brought over to the US, where she went from being a respected performer into being viewed as an 'exotic novelty act' in Hollywood and forced into playing the same roles over and over again (Fox found early on that she was a huge money earner for them). By 1945 she was the highest paid performer in the US. During the war years she was utilised the government for the good neighbour policy and pushed into playing various Latin American roles (Cubans, Argentines, etc) which resulted in her being vilified in those countries as the Brazilian identity is very distinct. Back in Brazil she was attacked for having become 'too American'. Her personal life was a mess when she married a man who exploited her further and treated her badly. She couldn't divorce him as her Catholic family would not have approved, despite how unhappy she was. She was also an actress who was caught up in the Studio uppers & downers, alcohol & cigarettes cycle that was so typical of the 1940s & 50s stars. It all resulted in a huge nervous breakdown that almost destroyed her and she was brought back to Rio to recover. She returned to work in the US but died shortly after of a heart attack, burnt out at 46 years old.\n\nBy all accounts, she was a lovely person, much loved by her co stars, who felt it was her duty as an entertainer to smile through it all. Maybe she would have been better off if she had said no to Hollywood.\n\nPost by hugobolso on\n\nThis made me think of (birthday-boy today) Kang Ho Song and his comments.... Two years ago he said: \"I've had some proposals from big Hollywood productions, but I've said no to all of them.\" He said it again in another interview and added: \"I think in such films I would disappear.\"\n\nSo I guess here it's one that isn't surprising - altho as one of the world's greatest actors, I think he'd excel at anything despite the language jump (he came to mind first when we were fake casting Knives Out 2). One that is surprising - stealing who pacinoyes might've picked here - Adele Haenel - why exactly hasn't she made the jump yet? and she'd work I think. She can play to period or now, she can be hilarious or kick your ass - it's very easy imagining her into roles - action star? horror lead? romance? I'll have what she's having.\n\nWho they are?\n\nI have a vague idea of who Adele Haenel is, but not clue who Kang Ho Song is.\n\nPost by hugobolso on\n\nRicardo Darin (1957) Argentine actor\n\nLa Carpa del Amor, a dumb saccarine commedy musical somewhere in between the Brady Bunch and Porkys\n\nRicardo Darin probably the best known and more awarded latin american actor in the last 20 years.\n\nHe started as a child start in TV and theatre, then he become a heartrobe (with Susana Gimenez 12 years seniors was the hottest couple during the early 80s) in TV ad Films, a TV comedian, and finally at 42 become a stablished leading actor in Argentina and Spain since 9 Queens in films. Before that film, he had leading roles in silly teenage comedies, and supporting roles in serious roles. At the same time he had critical and financial success in theatres too (ART).-\n\nNine Queens his ressurection as an actor\n\nWith 9 Queens, he started a serial of box office and critical acclaimed films including Son of the Bride (Academy Nominee best foreign film), The Aura, XXY, The Secret of their Eyes (Academy winner Best Foreign Nominee), Wild Tales (Academy Nominee Best foreign nominee), Truman (goya Award best actor), Everybody Knowns (with Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem, directed by Asghar Farhadi)\n\nEl Secreto de Sus Ojos. Academy Award Winner film, with Guillermo Francella, both are the box office champions at Argentina Box Office\n\nHowever he never made a Hollywood movie, maybe because he had blue eyes, and pale skin, too caucasic for being cast in a sterotype latino guy. Also he refused to be a mexican drug dealer in Man on Fire (2004).-\n\nWild Tales, probably his most famous film\n\nHowever he doesn't need Hollywood, as Hollywood need him, because he is probably the most succesful hispanic actor at box office, his films usually have than 1 millions viewers in Argentina, and also are usually in the Top 20 of Argentina, Spain and Uruguay at box office.-\n\nEverybody knows, his last success at box office with Penelope Cruz, both were attached for another film, suspended by the Covid-19 Pandemic"
