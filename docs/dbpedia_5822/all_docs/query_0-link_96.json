        "text": "An adult animated feature with a starry cast of comic voice actors, a world premiere with James Franco and directing efforts from Gael Garcia Bernal and Mia Wasikowska are among the movies on tap for the 2016 Tribeca Film Festival.\n\nThe 15th annual New York festival has unveiled about half the films on its 101-feature lineup, with 55 titles in total making up the competition slates and the Viewpoints section of programming.\n\nAmong the movies announced Wednesday are 43 world premieres, including “Nerdland,” Chris Prynoski’s R-rated cartoon comedy about fame with a cast led by Paul Rudd and Patton Oswalt, opening the Viewpoints section; Ian Olds’ “The Fixer,” a thriller in the U.S. narrative competition that stars Franco and Melissa Leo; and “Madly,” the opener of the international narrative competition and an anthology of love stories with shorts directed by Bernal and Wasikovska, among others.\n\nFor the first time this year, the narrative competition titles have been split into U.S. and international categories, a move that programmers said allows them greater breadth in their selections for each. The competition for documentaries — a genre for which Tribeca has become known as a significant launching pad — includes opener “Contemporary Color,” Bill Ross and Turner Ross’ concert documentary about a David Byrne concert that paired pop performers with color guard teams; Jenny Gage’s New York teen tale “All this Panic”; Andreas Johnsen’s edible insect doc “BUGS”; and Ted Braun’s Herbalife expose “Betting on Zero.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nOther outings from notable names on the slate include Demetri Martin’s directorial debut, “Dean,” in which Martin stars with Gillian Jacobs and Kevin Kline; Christopher Smith’s “Detour,” with Bel Powley in the cast; the U.S. premiere of Kristin Stewart-Nicholas Hoult sci-fi romance “Equals”; and “High-Rise,” the J.G. Ballard adaptation with Tom Hiddleston.\n\nThe 15th edition of the festival, founded in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 in an effort to revitalize lower Manhattan, will continue a trend that has seen the festival expand over the last several years to incorporate storytelling beyond the bigscreen. “As a relatively young festival, we’ve been able to be flexible and forward-thinking about supporting independent filmmaking and storytelling,” said festival director Genna Terranova. “I think you’ll see that the growth in the personality of the festival, in the breadth of it, reflects what’s going on in storytelling and media right now.”\n\nThe 15th anniversary also offered programmers the opportunity to look back on the films and talent the festival has nurtured over the years. Recent Independent Spirit Award winner “King Jack” premiered at the festival last year, and “Whiplash” creator Damian Chazelle’s first outing, “Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench,” bowed there in 2009. The documentary that provided the basis for “The Fixer,” also directed by Olds, made its U.S. debut in Tribeca the same year.\n\nThe 2016 Tribeca Film Festival opens April 13 with Met Gala documentary “The First Monday in May.” Further titles on the year’s slate are due to be announced March 8.\n\nThe complete list of announced features follows.\n\nUS Narrative Competition\n\nOpening Film\n\nKicks, directed by Justin Tipping, written by Justin Tipping and Josh Beirne-Golden.
