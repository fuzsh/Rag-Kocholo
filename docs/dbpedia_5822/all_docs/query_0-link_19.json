        "text": "Kino Lorber will release the Republic Pictures Horror Collection (1944-1946) Blu-ray set later this year. Republic didn’t do much horror stuff, but when they did, the results were usually pretty great.\n\nThe Lady And The Monster (1944)\n\nDirected by George Sherman\n\nStarring Erich von Stroheim, Vera Ralston, Richard Arlen\n\nThis adaptation of Curt Siodmak’s novel Donovan’s Brain stars the great director Erich von Stroheim and the Czech skater Vera Ralston, the girlfriend of Herbert J. Yates, the head of Republic. George Sherman directed, with John Alton behind the camera. How could this not be terrific? Rest assured, folks, it is.\n\nThe Phantom Speaks (1945)\n\nDirected by John English\n\nStarring Richard Arlen, Stanley Ridges, Lynne Roberts\n\nA killer is executed and his spirit possesses a scientist and the killings continue. A reporter (Richard Arlen) and the police don’t make the connection.\n\nJohn English directed a number of serials (paired with William Witney) and B Westerns for Republic and quite a few Gene Autry pictures at Columbia before heading into TV.\n\nThe Catman Of Paris (1946)\n\nDirected by Lesley Selander\n\nStarring Carl Esmond, Lenore Aubert, Adele Mara, Douglass Dumbrille, Gerald Mohr, Fritz Feld, John Dehner, Anthony Caruso\n\nThe Catman Of Paris (1946) was directed by Lesley Selander, one of the best B directors of them all, and it’s got Adele Mara and Douglass Dumbrille in it — what more do you need to know?\n\nThere’s a “were-cat” clawing people to death in the streets of Paris, and the author (Carl Esmond) of a popular book about a “cat man” is suspected of being responsible.\n\nValley Of The Zombies (1946)\n\nDirected by Philip Ford\n\nStarring Robert Livingston, Lorna Gray, Ian Keith, Thomas E. Jackson\n\nJohn Ford’s nephew directs a zombie movie that doesn’t have any zombies in it. Ian Keith needs frequent blood transfusions and that blood has to come from somewhere — eventually the police start looking into it. Some talk of voodoo is about as close to zombie-ness as it gets.\n\nRobert Livingston played The Lone Ranger in the Republic serial The Lone Ranger Rides Again (1939). Adrian Booth was in everything from a Three Stooges short to Republic serials to The Man They Could Not Hang (1938) with Boris Karloff to William Elliott pictures like The Last Bandit (1949) — even Mr. Smith Goes To Washington (1939).\n\nThis thing’s gonna be great.\n\nA few days ago, over on 50 Westerns From The 50s, I posted a list of the Westerns released on DVD and Blu-Rays by Olive Films. Turns out a number of us are looking to fill some gaps in our collections — before they’re either gone or going for crazy collectors’ prices. And now, here’s a list of some of their other titles. This is by no means everything — just the stuff that falls within the scope of this blog.\n\nSome of these titles have already been re-issued (or are on the way) by other companies. But some may never see the light of day again, given the current state of physical media. From a couple of Republic serials to a handful of Regalscope pictures, there are some real jewels here.\n\nAs very special thanks (again) to Laura from Laura’s Miscellaneous Musings, who was a HUGE help with bringing this together.\n\nBetty Boop, Vols. 1-4\n\nSabotage (1939)\n\nS.O.S. Tidal Wave (1939)\n\nLady From Louisiana (1941)\n\nA Man Betrayed (1941)\n\nOne Of Our Aircraft Is Missing (1942)\n\nFlying Tigers (1942)\n\nLady For A Night (1942)\n\nJohnny Come Lately (1943)\n\nStrangers In The Night (1944)\n\nVoodoo Man (1944)\n\nFighting Seabees (1944)\n\nThe Return Of The Ape Man (1944)\n\nThe Strange Affair Of Uncle Harry (1945)\n\nFlame Of Barbary Coast (1945)\n\nThe Vampire’s Ghost (1945)\n\nThe Dark Mirror (1946)\n\nThe Private Affairs Of Bel Ami (1946)\n\nAppointment With Crime (1946)\n\nCopacabana (1947)\n\nRuthless (1948)\n\nSo This Is New York (1948)\n\nForce Of Evil (1948)\n\nMr. Peabody And The Mermaid (1948)\n\nWake Of The Red Witch (1948)\n\nSands Of Iwo Jima (1949)\n\nThe Red Menace (1949)\n\nThe Kid From Cleveland (1949)\n\nLove Happy (1949)\n\nThe File On Thelma Jordon (1950)\n\nAppointment With Danger (1950)\n\nNo Man of Her Own (1950)\n\nThe Lawless (1950)\n\nCaptain Carey U.S.A.

Olive Films put some terrific movies in our hot little hands. It’s a shame they didn’t make it. This proves the point that’s been made over and over on this blog — if we don’t support the companies that put these things out, they won’t be putting them out anymore. Okay, now I’ll climb down from my soapbox and put The Return Of Dracula back on.\n\nDirected by Lesley Selander\n\nOriginal Screen Play by Sherman L. Lowe\n\nPhotography: Reggie Lanning\n\nFilm Editor: Harry Keller\n\nMusic Score: Dale Butts\n\nSpecial Effects: Howard & Theodore Lydecker\n\nCast: Carl Esmond (Charles Regnier), Lenore Aubert (Marie Audet), Adele Mara (Marguerite Duval), Douglass Dumbrille (Henry Borchard), Gerald Mohr (Inspector Severen), Fritz Feld (Prefect of Police), Francis Pierlot (Paul Audet), Georges Renavent (Guillard), Francis McDonald (Devereaux), Maurice Cass (Paul de Roche), Alphonse Martell (Maurice Cocaignac), Paul Marion (Jules), John Dehner (Georges), Anthony Caruso (Raoul)\n\nRepublic Pictures didn’t make many horror movies — their specialties were B Westerns and serials, but when they did go the spooky route, the results were typically pretty interesting. Case in point: 1944’s The Lady And The Monster starring Vera Ralston and Eric von Stroheim, based on Curt Siodmak’s Donovan’s Brain.\n\nThe Catman Of Paris (1946) is fascinating. It plays as if Republic decided to enter Val Lewton and Universal territory. Lewton had done Cat People in 1942 and Universal’s second The Black Cat came out in 1941 — and they’d release The Cat Creeps a month after Republic let The Catman Of Paris out of his cage. But this being a Republic picture, you can count on a few of the studio’s trademarks: a saloon-type brawl and a two-carriage chase down a pretty familiar-looking chase road.\n\nThere’s a myth or legend (or is it real?) about a murderous Catman, and the famed author Charles Regnier (Carl Esmond) has written a controversial new book about it. Next thing you know, people start turning up dead, viciously clawed as if by a cat. All while Charles starts suffering terrible headaches and blacking out every so often.\n\nWhen Charles’ fiancé (Adele Mara) is killed the night he calls off their wedding, the cops start looking for him. Charles’ new love Marie (Lenore Aubert) and his trusted friend Henry (Douglass Dumbrille) try to shield him as the cops (Gerald Mohr and Fritz Feld) close in and Charles becomes convinced he really is the dreaded Catman.\n\nLesley Selander was a great B director, usually of Western and action pictures. He made a rare foray into horror with The Catman Of Paris, and he keeps things moving at a brisk pace, with help from editor Harry Keller, especially in the fight and chase sequences. (He’d also do a single sci-fi movie, 1951’s Flight To Mars.)\n\nThe cast boasts some great character actors from the Republic staple. Adela Mara was under contract at Republic — she’d been in Selander’s The Vampire’s Ghost (1945) and The Invisible Informer (with Gerald Mohr) in 1945. Douglass Dumbrille worked everywhere, but was a fairly common sight in a Republic picture.\n\nLenore Aubert, of course, is known for playing Dr. Sandra Mornay, Bela Lugosi’s assistant, in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948). John Dehner and Anthony Caruso give French accents a try and take part in the brawl.\n\nIt often played paired one of Republic’s other horror pictures, Valley Of The Zombies (1946).\n\nFor fans of all things Republic, Imprint’s Blu-Ray of The Catman Of Paris is really something to celebrate. First, it’s always a treat when a Republic picture turns up in high definition these days. The Republic library resides with Paramount these days, and while they’ve done some really nice work on the materials, not many of them are making their way to DVD or Blu-Ray. The picture here is sharp as a tack (thanks to a 4K scan). The material has some dust and changeover cues here and there, which I like as they make me nostalgic for the days of collecting and running actual film.\n\nThere’s a commentary and video essay, but the jewel of the extras is the feature-length documentary The Republic Pictures Story from 1991. It’s excellent, allowing me to retire my old laserdisc copy.\n\nImprint does excellent work, always, and The Catman Of Paris is no exception. Highly, highly recommended. And here’s hoping they can drag more Republics out of the Paramount vault.\n\nDirected by Lesley Selander\n\nScreenplay by Arthur Strawn\n\nProduced by Walter Mirisch\n\nCinematography: Harry Neumann\n\nFilm Editor: Richard V. Heermance\n\nMusic by Marlin Skiles\n\nCast: Marguerite Chapman (Alita), Cameron Mitchell (Steve Abbott), Arthur Franz (Dr. Jim Barker), Virginia Huston (Carol Stafford), John Litel (Dr. Lane), Morris Ankrum (Ikron)\n\n__________\n\nIf there’s a recipe for cooking up a perfect 50s B movie, you can bet it was used to whip up Flight To Mars (1951). Let’s see. You’ve got the great B director Lesley Selander. There’s Cameron Mitchell, Arthur Franz and Morris Ankrum in the cast. There’s the lovely Martian maiden (Marguerite Chapman) in her interstellar miniskirt. And it’s all in Cinecolor from the fine folks at Monogram Pictures.\n\nA team of American scientists, accompanied by a newspaperman (Cameron Mitchell), take a rocket ride to Mars. (Mitchell smokes through much of the flight.) Once they crash on the Red Planet, the seemingly-friendly people of Mars start plotting to imprison the Earthlings and use their damaged rocket to plan the Martian migration to Earth. You see, Mars is running low on the crucial element Corium…\n\nThere’s an element of hope in 50s science fiction that find very attractive, and Flight To Mars has it in spades. In movies like this, you can “trust the science” (and scientists) without a trace of irony or sarcasm.\n\nFlight To Mars, with its “Mars N Miniskirts” theme (Marguerite Chapman looks great in her Martian attire), is part of a rich cinema heritage. There’s also Abbott & Costello Go To Mars (1953), Cat-Women Of The Moon (1953, with Marie Windsor), Devil Girl From Mars (1954), World Without End (1955), Fire Maidens From Outer Space (1956), Queen Of Outer Space (1957) and Invasion Of The Star Creatures (1962). That’d make a helluva weekend retrospective, wouldn’t it?\n\nThere’s a strong tie between Flight To Mars and both World Without End and Queen Of Outer Space — both use rocket footage from this one, severely cropped for CinemaScope. All three were released by Monogram or Allied Artisits — same company, different names.\n\nProducer Walter Mirisch was trying to take things up a notch at Monogram, and it’s obvious they splurged a bit (relatively speaking) on Flight To Mars.\n\nThere are the effects and Cinecolor, of course. A cast with a few name actors in it. Some interesting sets for the underground Martian city, complete with a Herman Miller ball clock (designed by George Nelson). And a handful of nice matte paintings (certainly inspired by 1936’s Things To Come).\n\nBut you’ll still see some of the usual Poverty Row tricks — the cast is tiny, the sets are often reconfigured to create new spaces, and for a movie about space flight, there’s very little space actually seen. And it was all shot in just five days!\n\nThe Film Detective treated Flight To Mars to a 4K restoration from the picture’s original 35mm Cinecolor separation negatives. On the whole, it looks wonderful. The Cinecolor is terrific, given the process’s odd, limited color palette. Some scenes are sharper than others, with the Mars portion of the movie looking best. The grain’s a bit clunky in some scenes, but I’m so glad nobody tried to process it away. Never thought I’d see it look like this. The sound is quite nice, with more range than you’d expect. There are a couple of nice documentaries from Ballyhoo, a commentary from Justin Humphreys and an essay by Don Stradley.\n\nI adore Monogram Pictures Corporation and have a real soft spot for many of their movies, no matter how good they actually are. I love Flight To Mars — and what The Film Detective has done with it. Highly, highly recommended.\n\nImprint has announced their upcoming Silver Screams Cinema Collection, six pictures (complete with extras) on three Blu-Ray discs. You might dismiss this as a bit of a random, grab bag assortment of old horror movies. But that downplays all the cool stuff that’s in here — some Republic stuff, one of Bela Lugosi’s Monogram Nine and a couple of Regalscope pictures. You get:\n\nThe Phantom Speaks (1945)\n\nDirected by John English\n\nStarring Richard Arlen, Stanley Ridges, Lynne Roberts, Tom Powers\n\nThe Vampire’s Ghost (1945)\n\nDirected by Lesley Selander\n\nStarring John Abbott, Charles Gordon, Peggy Stewart, Grant Withers, Emmett Vogan, Adele Mara\n\nValley Of The Zombies (1946)\n\nDirected by Philip Ford\n\nStarring Robert Livingston, Lorna Gray, Ian Keith, Thomas E. Jackson\n\nReturn Of The Ape Man (1946)\n\nDirected by Philip Rosen\n\nStarring Bela Lugosi, John Carradine, George Zucco, Frank Moran, Judith Gibson\n\nShe Devil (1957)\n\nDirected by Kurt Neumann\n\nStarring Mari Blanchard, Jack Kelly, Albert Dekker\n\nUnknown Terror (1957)\n\nDirected by Charles Marquis Warren\n\nStarring John Howard, Mala Powers, Paul Richards, May Wynn\n\nTo me, the real jewel here is the last film, Unknown Terror, a pretty solid Regalscope picture. You won’t find this one in widescreen anywhere else, and having it in high definition is an added treat. It’s a pretty good example of the ultra-cheap Regal films. It concerns mutants and rampant fungus — and has a good part for the lovely Mala Powers.\n\nImprint always does really nice work, so you can count on this set being top-notch. Recommended.\n\nDirected by Lesley Selander\n\nStarring Marguerite Chapman, Cameron Mitchell, Arthur Franz, Virginia Huston, John Litel, Morris Ankrum\n\nThe same year (1951) that Kenneth Tobey and Margaret Sheridan locked horns with The Thing From Another World, Cameron Mitchell went on a Flight To Mars and discovered chicks in shiny mini skirts. Which vision of life from other planets would you prefer?\n\nBefore you answer that, consider that in Flight To Mars, once the American scientists land on the Red Planet, the seemingly-friendly people of Mars start plotting to imprison the Earthlings and use their ship to plan their migration to Earth. You see, Mars is running low on the crucial element Corium…\n\nAll you need to know in order to put this one atop your Want List is that it’s from Lesley Selander and Monogram, there are the usual Martian women in the aforementioned mini skirts (in Cinecolor!) and that Morris Ankrum is a Martian leader named Ikorn. You’re all set to pre-order this little jewel, aren’t you?\n\nOh, and remember that Monogram (now called Allied Artists) would crop the spaceship effects for ‘Scope for World Without End (1956). That picture would add mutants and giant spiders to the Mars-and-miniskirts plot.\n\nWarner Archive brought us a beautiful (and complete) restoration of The Thing a couple years ago. And now The Film Detective is giving Flight To Mars similar treatment. We’ve got to wait till July, but they’re promising a 4K restoration from original 35mm Cinecolor Separation Negatives — and a healthy batch of extras. From the two-color Technicolor of The Mystery Of The Wax Museum (1933) to some of the Trucolor Republics from Kino Lorber, we’ve seen some amazing results from these cheaper, more limited color processes. Flight To Mars should look otherworldly. This is my kind of mind-rotting nonsense! Highly recommended.\n\nDirected by Lesley Selander\n\nScreen Play by Royal K. Cole\n\nOriginal Story by Robert Leslie Bellem\n\nAdditional Dialogue by Albert DeMond\n\nDirector Of Photography: Reggie Lanning\n\nCast: William Marshall (Dan Turner), Adele Mara (Sylvia Duane), Ricardo Cortez (Ziggy Cranston), Grant Withers (Inspector Donaldson), Stephanie Bachelor (Carla), Richard Fraser (Antoine le Blanc), Roy Barcroft (Spice Kellaway), George J. Lewis (Blue Chip Winslow), Robert J. Wilke\n\n__________\n\nThis is an entry in The Republic Pictures Blogathon, a celebration of the studio’s incredible talent roster, wonderful output and lasting legacy.\n\nFor starters, in this quirky, fun Noir we get not one but two Femme Fatales: slinky, mysterious Stephanie Batchelor and Republic’s regular sweetie Adele Mara.\n\nL.A showbiz tycoon (Ricardo Cortez) with a gambling addiction, is slipped a Shanghai-ball by a tomato (as the script would have it) and becomes involved in a shakedown, murder and blackmail.\n\nTo sort out this mess, he hires a New York gumshoe (William Marshall, who certainly puts the “hard” in hard-nosed). No sooner has Marshall arrived on the scene when Cortez is framed for another murder. Marshall not only has to contend with gambling syndicate goons, but also a police chief (Grant Withers) who resents this East Coast interloper on his patch.\n\nStylishly shot by Reggie Lanning, we get a barrage of one-liners from serial expert Royal Cole. The fast pacing is what we’ve come to expect from Lesley Selander. There is a car chase and three slug-fests….the final one is a real doozy. With the constant flow of hardboiled dialogue, the audience is given another mystery to decipher: was the film intended as a parody of private eye flicks? The cast plays it pretty much straight.\n\nMy favorite one-liners:\n\nWithers (on first encountering Adele Mara): “Who’s this bright young tomato”\n\nMarshall: “She’s this years entry for mis-information.”\n\nIt gets better:\n\nWithers (after Marshall bursts into his office): “I have a desk clerk to announce visitors, that includes shamuses and other vermin.”\n\nMarshall:” Is this a bureau of homicide or insecticide?”\n\nMarshall’s favorite tipple is a dry Martini without the olive… it takes up too much room in the glass. He’s endearingly unlikeable in this film, but apparently was not too likable in real life. According to imdb, when Marshall was directing Adventures Of Captain Fabian (1951), Errol Flynn got so fed up with Marshall’s bombastic attitude, he stormed off the set. Marshall had to complete the film using Flynn’s stunt double. The picture was a critical and commercial flop, and Marshall didn’t directed another film until The Phantom Planet (1961), a cult favorite. Marshall was married several times. Three of his wives were actresses: Michele Morgan, Micheline Presle and Ginger Rogers.\n\nOddly enough, Lesley Selander never directed a Republic A movie, while other Republic B directors — such as Joseph Kane, R.G. Springsteen and William Witney — moved up to A Westerns starring the likes of Rod Cameron, Forrest Tucker, William Elliott, John Payne, Sterling Hayden and John Derek. Joseph Kane was more than Republic’s top contract director; he was their “rock.” When bona fide A list stars were enticed over to Republic, Kane directed their vehicles: Fred MacMurray in Fair Wind To Java (1953) and Barbara Stanwyk in The Maverick Queen (1956). At that time, Selander also moved up to higher budgets, mainly for Allied Artists and Bel-Air — who released their films through United Artists. Selander also got the occasional major studio gig — he did The Raiders (1952) for Universal and Tall Man Riding (1955) for Warner Brothers. As the Fifties moved on, Republic struggled and reverted more or less to a B Movie outfit. Trucolor was more or less dispensed with and fewer Westerns were made. They made more and more B Crime Thrillers and the then popular J.D.Movies. From Kane we got fare like The Man Who Died Twice (1958) and The Crooked Circle (1957). Springsteen gave us I Cover The Underworld (1955) and When Gangland Strikes (1956), and Witney contributed City Of Shadows (1955), Juvenile Jungle (1958) and Young And Wild (1958). Selander returned to the fold for a couple of these later quickies: Taming Sutton’s Gal and The Wayward Girl (both 1957).\n\nMost of these later Republics had the attraction of being filmed in widescreen Naturama. They’re impossible to see in that ratio today. Even sadder, no-one seems interested in releasing them. Those final Republic B’s (which included several good Westerns like The Lawless Eighties and Hell’s Crossroads) are trapped in the vaults, along with most of the other great titles in the Republic catalog. How long these films will remain unreleased remains to be seen.\n\n__________\n\nJohn Knight calls himself “a ‘Muswell Hillbilly’ by birth, now retired and living on the Isle Of Wight.
