        "text": "If you ask me, the fine folks at Imprint can go ahead and lay claim to Blu-Ray Set Of The Year with their upcoming Tales Of Adventure, Collection 4 — a mammoth assemblage of Republic’s sci-fi serials.\n\nKing Of The Rocket Men (1949) (HD)\n\nDirected Fred C. Brannon\n\nStarring Tristram Coffin, Mae Clarke, Don Haggerty, House Peters, Jr., I. Stanford Jolley\n\nFlying Disc Man From Mars (1950) (HD)\n\nDirected by Fred C. Brannon\n\nStarring Walter Reed, Lois Collier, Grego ry Gaye, James Craven\n\nThe Invisible Monster (1950) (HD)\n\nDirected by Fred C. Brannon\n\nStarring Richard Webb and Aline Towne\n\nRadar Men From The Moon (1952) (HD)\n\nDirected by Fred C. Brannon\n\nStarring George Wallace, Aline Towne, Roy Barcroft, Clayton Moore\n\nZombies Of The Stratosphere (1952) (SD)\n\nDirected by Fred C. Brannon\n\nStarring Judd Holdren, Aline Towne, Wilson Wood, Lane Bradford, Stanley Waxman, Leonard Nimoy\n\nMysterious Doctor Satan (1940) (SD)\n\nDirected by William Witney & John English\n\nStarring Edward Ciannelli, Robert Wilcox, William Newell, C. Montague Shaw\n\nCommando Cody: Sky Marshal Of The Universe (1953) (HD)\n\nDirected by Harry Keller, Franklin Adreon, Fred C. Brannon\n\nStarring Judd Holdren, Aline Towne, Gregory Gaye, William Schallert\n\nThere are plenty of commentaries, the feature versions of several of these things, a video essay and a feature-length documentary on Republic serials. Eight discs, almost 2,000 minutes long — limited to 1,500 copies. I cannot wait for this thing!\n\nThanks to Steve Bowen.\n\nKino Lorber will release the Republic Pictures Horror Collection (1944-1946) Blu-ray set later this year. Republic didn’t do much horror stuff, but when they did, the results were usually pretty great.\n\nThe Lady And The Monster (1944)\n\nDirected by George Sherman\n\nStarring Erich von Stroheim, Vera Ralston, Richard Arlen\n\nThis adaptation of Curt Siodmak’s novel Donovan’s Brain stars the great director Erich von Stroheim and the Czech skater Vera Ralston, the girlfriend of Herbert J. Yates, the head of Republic. George Sherman directed, with John Alton behind the camera. How could this not be terrific? Rest assured, folks, it is.\n\nThe Phantom Speaks (1945)\n\nDirected by John English\n\nStarring Richard Arlen, Stanley Ridges, Lynne Roberts\n\nA killer is executed and his spirit possesses a scientist and the killings continue. A reporter (Richard Arlen) and the police don’t make the connection.\n\nJohn English directed a number of serials (paired with William Witney) and B Westerns for Republic and quite a few Gene Autry pictures at Columbia before heading into TV.\n\nThe Catman Of Paris (1946)\n\nDirected by Lesley Selander\n\nStarring Carl Esmond, Lenore Aubert, Adele Mara, Douglass Dumbrille, Gerald Mohr, Fritz Feld, John Dehner, Anthony Caruso\n\nThe Catman Of Paris (1946) was directed by Lesley Selander, one of the best B directors of them all, and it’s got Adele Mara and Douglass Dumbrille in it — what more do you need to know?\n\nThere’s a “were-cat” clawing people to death in the streets of Paris, and the author (Carl Esmond) of a popular book about a “cat man” is suspected of being responsible.\n\nValley Of The Zombies (1946)\n\nDirected by Philip Ford\n\nStarring Robert Livingston, Lorna Gray, Ian Keith, Thomas E. Jackson\n\nJohn Ford’s nephew directs a zombie movie that doesn’t have any zombies in it. Ian Keith needs frequent blood transfusions and that blood has to come from somewhere — eventually the police start looking into it. Some talk of voodoo is about as close to zombie-ness as it gets.\n\nRobert Livingston played The Lone Ranger in the Republic serial The Lone Ranger Rides Again (1939). Adrian Booth was in everything from a Three Stooges short to Republic serials to The Man They Could Not Hang (1938) with Boris Karloff to William Elliott pictures like The Last Bandit (1949) — even Mr. Smith Goes To Washington (1939).\n\nThis thing’s gonna be great.\n\nThis latest volume in Kino Lorber’s terrific Blu-Ray series veers off in a great direction, stepping away from Universal International and adding a Republic and an Allied Artist picture to the mix. All three noirs here come from 1955.\n\nCity Of Shadows\n\nDirected by William Witney\n\nStarring Victor McLaglen, John Baer, Kathleen Crowley, Anthony Caruso, Frank Ferguson\n\nA mid-50s Republic picture with Victor McLaglen as a hood running slot machines and Frank Ferguson as a DA — do movies get more perfect than this? Direction from William Witney and Reggie Lanning behind the camera help put it over the edge. 70 minutes of B-movie heaven.\n\nCrashout\n\nDirected by Lewis R. Foster\n\nStarring William Bendix, Arthur Kennedy, Luther Adler, William Talman, Gene Evans, Marshall Thompson, Gloria Talbott\n\nThis time we get William Bendix as the head of a group of convicts who pull off a big prison break, Arthur Kennedy as the only con with a semblance of morals and William Talman as a murderous religious fanatic. Russell Metty shot it a few years before he tackled Touch Of Evil (1958).\n\nFinger Man\n\nDirected by Harold Schuster\n\nStarring Frank Lovejoy, Forrest Tucker, Peggie Castle, Timothy Carey\n\nWho cares what this movie’s about — it’s got Peggie Castle and Timothy Carey in it! Frank Lovejoy’s a crook who accepts a deal with the cops to bring down Dutch Becker (Forrest Tucker), who’s moll is Castle and who’s creepiest thug is Carey. Director Harold Schuster made some great little movies, including the severely underrated Western The Dragoon Wells Massacre (1958).\n\nKino Lorber’s noir sets have been terrific so far, and this one gets my vote for the best so far. Highly, highly recommended!\n\nImprint’s done it again. With their Tales Of Adventure, Collection Two, you get three Republic jungle pictures, along with two major-studio things featuring the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, Janet Leigh, Victor Mature and Dana Andrews.\n\nAngel On The Amazon (1948, AKA Drums Along The Amazon)\n\nDirected by John H. Auer\n\nStarring George Brent, Vera Ralston, Brian Aherne, Constance Bennett\n\nHerbert J. Yates, the boss at Republic, was Czech figure-skater girlfriend a movie star. (It didn’t really work.) Here, she’s a mysterious woman who rescues the survivors of a plane crash deep in the jungle.\n\nDaughter Of The Jungle (1949)\n\nDirected by George Blair\n\nStarring Lois Hall, James Cardwell, William Wright, Sheldon Leonard\n\nThis time, a plane crashes in Africa, not the Amazon, and Lois Hall and her dad come to the rescue. The lovely Lois Hall is shamefully overlooked and under-represented on DVD and Blu-Ray. She was in some really cool stuff, ranging from Johnny Mack Brown Westerns at Monogram to Sam Katzman serials at Columbia to The Lone Ranger.\n\nFair Wind To Java (1953)\n\nDirected by Joseph Kane\n\nStarring Fred MacMurray, Vera Ralston, Victor McLaglen, Paul Fix\n\nHerbert Yates paired Vera Ralston with all sorts of stars in his efforts to make her a star — this time it was Fred MacMurray’s turn. This was a pretty big protduction by Republic standards, and he Lydecker Brothers have a field day (in Trucolor!), with model pirate ships and a fake volcano (built at Mono Lake).\n\nElephant Walk (1954)\n\nDirected by William Dieterle\n\nStarring Elizabeth Taylor, Dana Andrews, Peter Finch, Abraham Sofaer\n\nThis story of stampeding elephants and a tea plantation was to have starred Laurence Olivier and Vivian Leigh. She had to pull out and Olivier went with her. They say you can see her in some long shots — and if this looks as good as Imprint’s stuff usually does, you’ll be able to see for yourself!\n\nSafari (1956)\n\nDirected by Terence Young\n\nStarring Victor Mature, Janet Leigh, Roland Culver, John Justin, Earl Cameron\n\nHere, a pre-Bond Terence Young takes Victor Mature and Janet Leigh (and a CinemaScope lens) to Kenya, where they take on everything from the Mau Mau to alligators.\n\nIf you haven’t figured it out by now, this set is gonna be terrific. The Lydeckers alone make it must! Stacked with extras and highly recommended.\n\nA few days ago, over on 50 Westerns From The 50s, I posted a list of the Westerns released on DVD and Blu-Rays by Olive Films. Turns out a number of us are looking to fill some gaps in our collections — before they’re either gone or going for crazy collectors’ prices. And now, here’s a list of some of their other titles. This is by no means everything — just the stuff that falls within the scope of this blog.\n\nSome of these titles have already been re-issued (or are on the way) by other companies. But some may never see the light of day again, given the current state of physical media. From a couple of Republic serials to a handful of Regalscope pictures, there are some real jewels here.\n\nAs very special thanks (again) to Laura from Laura’s Miscellaneous Musings, who was a HUGE help with bringing this together.\n\nBetty Boop, Vols. 1-4\n\nSabotage (1939)\n\nS.O.S.

Olive Films put some terrific movies in our hot little hands. It’s a shame they didn’t make it. This proves the point that’s been made over and over on this blog — if we don’t support the companies that put these things out, they won’t be putting them out anymore. Okay, now I’ll climb down from my soapbox and put The Return Of Dracula back on.\n\nDirected by Lesley Selander\n\nOriginal Screen Play by Sherman L. Lowe\n\nPhotography: Reggie Lanning\n\nFilm Editor: Harry Keller\n\nMusic Score: Dale Butts\n\nSpecial Effects: Howard & Theodore Lydecker\n\nCast: Carl Esmond (Charles Regnier), Lenore Aubert (Marie Audet), Adele Mara (Marguerite Duval), Douglass Dumbrille (Henry Borchard), Gerald Mohr (Inspector Severen), Fritz Feld (Prefect of Police), Francis Pierlot (Paul Audet), Georges Renavent (Guillard), Francis McDonald (Devereaux), Maurice Cass (Paul de Roche), Alphonse Martell (Maurice Cocaignac), Paul Marion (Jules), John Dehner (Georges), Anthony Caruso (Raoul)\n\nRepublic Pictures didn’t make many horror movies — their specialties were B Westerns and serials, but when they did go the spooky route, the results were typically pretty interesting. Case in point: 1944’s The Lady And The Monster starring Vera Ralston and Eric von Stroheim, based on Curt Siodmak’s Donovan’s Brain.\n\nThe Catman Of Paris (1946) is fascinating. It plays as if Republic decided to enter Val Lewton and Universal territory. Lewton had done Cat People in 1942 and Universal’s second The Black Cat came out in 1941 — and they’d release The Cat Creeps a month after Republic let The Catman Of Paris out of his cage. But this being a Republic picture, you can count on a few of the studio’s trademarks: a saloon-type brawl and a two-carriage chase down a pretty familiar-looking chase road.\n\nThere’s a myth or legend (or is it real?) about a murderous Catman, and the famed author Charles Regnier (Carl Esmond) has written a controversial new book about it. Next thing you know, people start turning up dead, viciously clawed as if by a cat. All while Charles starts suffering terrible headaches and blacking out every so often.\n\nWhen Charles’ fiancé (Adele Mara) is killed the night he calls off their wedding, the cops start looking for him. Charles’ new love Marie (Lenore Aubert) and his trusted friend Henry (Douglass Dumbrille) try to shield him as the cops (Gerald Mohr and Fritz Feld) close in and Charles becomes convinced he really is the dreaded Catman.\n\nLesley Selander was a great B director, usually of Western and action pictures. He made a rare foray into horror with The Catman Of Paris, and he keeps things moving at a brisk pace, with help from editor Harry Keller, especially in the fight and chase sequences. (He’d also do a single sci-fi movie, 1951’s Flight To Mars.)\n\nThe cast boasts some great character actors from the Republic staple. Adela Mara was under contract at Republic — she’d been in Selander’s The Vampire’s Ghost (1945) and The Invisible Informer (with Gerald Mohr) in 1945. Douglass Dumbrille worked everywhere, but was a fairly common sight in a Republic picture.\n\nLenore Aubert, of course, is known for playing Dr. Sandra Mornay, Bela Lugosi’s assistant, in Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948). John Dehner and Anthony Caruso give French accents a try and take part in the brawl.\n\nIt often played paired one of Republic’s other horror pictures, Valley Of The Zombies (1946).\n\nFor fans of all things Republic, Imprint’s Blu-Ray of The Catman Of Paris is really something to celebrate. First, it’s always a treat when a Republic picture turns up in high definition these days. The Republic library resides with Paramount these days, and while they’ve done some really nice work on the materials, not many of them are making their way to DVD or Blu-Ray. The picture here is sharp as a tack (thanks to a 4K scan). The material has some dust and changeover cues here and there, which I like as they make me nostalgic for the days of collecting and running actual film.\n\nThere’s a commentary and video essay, but the jewel of the extras is the feature-length documentary The Republic Pictures Story from 1991. It’s excellent, allowing me to retire my old laserdisc copy.\n\nImprint does excellent work, always, and The Catman Of Paris is no exception. Highly, highly recommended. And here’s hoping they can drag more Republics out of the Paramount vault."
