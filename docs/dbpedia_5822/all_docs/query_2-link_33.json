        "text": "Here in the Caribbean, we're blessed with almost limitless options to enjoy miles of sandy beaches, rivers, picturesque mountain terrain, a wide array of flora and fauna that can't be found anywhere else.\n\nWhile we have access to all these and countless other experiences, there are many who save, plan and travel to enjoy what Caribbean nationals often take for granted.\n\nThen there are those who catch glimpses of what the region has to offer, from a distance.\n\nHere we've compiled a list of movies that were filmed in the Caribbean.\n\nHow Stella Got Her Groove Back\n\nThis film is an adaptation of the novel written by Terri McMillan and features African American acting heavyweights like Angela Bassett (Stella), Whoopi Goldberg, Loretta Levine, Regina King and Taye Diggs who made his acting debut. The movie follows Stella, an overworked stockbroker who is reminded of the importance of truly living, during a trip to Jamaica.\n\nNo – Jamaica\n\nDid you know that bits of the very first Bond movie were filmed in Jamaica? The Iconic scene Honey rider emerged from the beach was shot at the Laughing Waters Beach in front of Dunn River Falls.\n\nSeveral other Bond movies were shot in different parts of the Caribbean including Thunderball, License to Kill, Casino Royale, Live and Let Die, GoldenEye and Die Another Day.\n\nThe silence of the Lambs – The Bahamas\n\nWhile it wasn't an especially prominent scene, The Bahamas was briefly featured in The Silence Of The Lambs. it’s not all that prominent, the Caribbean does make a cameo appearance in the hugely successful Silence of the Lambs movie. The main character, Hannibal Lecter retired at a home in The Bahamas towards the end of the movie.\n\nSplash- The Bahamas\n\nReleased in 1984, this romantic comedy sees Tom Hanks jump into the ocean in pursuit of a beautiful mermaid only to be pulled from the water. He encountered the ethereal creature again years later at Gorda Cay in The Bahamas.\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption- US Virgin Islands\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption primarily takes place in the grim surroundings of Shawshank Prison but ends on a high note on the shores of Zihuatanejo, Mexico. At least one scene was shot at Sandy Point, a beach on the coast of St. Croix, in the US Virgin Islands, which is a popular hatching ground for turtles!\n\nHelp!- The Bahamas\n\nThe Beatles’ second movie took the Fab Four to various exotic locations, such as the Austrian Alps, and New Providence Island and Paradise Island, in the Bahamas.\n\nMiami Vice- Dominican Republic\n\nMany scenes from this movie were shot in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe Godfather Part II- Dominican Republic\n\nIn part two of this iconic series, Michael Corleone travels to Cuba, just as the Batista regime is falling and Castro is rising to power. Because of the US embargo against the country, the \"Cuba\" scenes were shot in the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn (PRT 1) US Virgin Islands\n\nBella and Jacob travel to the Virgin Islands for their honeymoon at the end of the fourth Twilight movie.\n\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean\n\nFrom St. Vincent and the Grenadines to Dominica and Puerto Rico, the films have been shot in a number of real-life Caribbean locations.\n\nCool Runnings\n\nThis movie follows a bobsled team from Jamaica as they journey to the 1988 winter Olympics. The team trained in the Caribbean heat for a sport that \"chills them to their bones.\"\n\nIsland In The Sun\n\nReleased in 1957, this was one of the first movies to be filmed in Grenada and Barbados. The movie is an adaptation of Alec Waugh's novel and reveals the very blatant classism and deep-rooted racism meted out to Caribbean natives at the hands of British colonisers.\n\nOther movies that were filmed in the Caribbean include:\n\nSimeon- Martinique (1992)\n\nGuava Island- Cuba\n\nThe Tamarind Seed- Barbados (1974)\n\n7 Days in Havana- Cuba\n\nCocktail- Jamaica (1988)\n\nHow many of these movies have you seen?"
