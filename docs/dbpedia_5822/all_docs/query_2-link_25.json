        "text": "Filmmakers will be wrapping up final scenes of the highly anticipated sequel to \"Silence of the Lambs\" this week at the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, N.C.\n\n\"Hannibal\" stars Academy Award-winner Anthony Hopkins and Academy Award-nominee Julianne Moore. A few scenes for the movie were filmed last week at Biltmore. A majority of the film has already been shot in Florence, Italy; Richmond, Va., and Washington, D.C. The production team searched the country for the perfect house for some important scenes before settling on the Biltmore Estate. \"We looked at several big houses around the country,\" said Rob Harris, the movie's publicist. \"But the Biltmore Estate is the biggest and the grandest.\" George Vanderbilt's 1895 250-room house is situated on 125,000 acres of forest, park and gardens. Harris said the actors and production staff have enjoyed their stay in Asheville. \"It's even prettier than I remembered,\" said Harris, an Upstate New York native. \"We're here for too short of a time.\" The Biltmore's library and tapestry room plus the grounds have been transformed to represent character Mason Verger's home. Verger, the sixth victim of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, is seeking revenge against the cannibal who disfigured him. He will use FBI agent Clarice Starling as bait to lure Lecter to his home. One room includes a canopy bed draped with white sheets. In another room, a banquet table will be used in a party scene. \"The place looks pretty different,\" said estate spokeswoman Elizabeth Sims. \"They also are going to be filming on other locations on the property.\" Large, horned deer now decorate the estate's front porch. \"We've shot movies here before, and we are glad they are here,\" Sins said. The MGM-Universal film's script is a tightly guarded secret, although Harris did say that it stays pretty close to Thomas Harris' novel. While there was no casting call, local actors were used in several non-speaking roles. Rob Harris said the film will be completed in a couple of days and will then be headed to the editing room. The film will be released in February. The original film, \"Silence of the Lambs,\" grossed $131 million domestically and $119 million internationally. It also earned five Academy Awards including Best Picture. Although the set will be closed, Biltmore will remain open to the public this week during the filming.\n\nJose Franco can be reached at jose.franco@shj.com or 582-4511, Ext. 7212."
