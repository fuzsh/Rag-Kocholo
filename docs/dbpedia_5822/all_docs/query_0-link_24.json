        "text": "The repeated use of the ‘Goldberg’ Variations in the Hannibal Lecter saga offers a route into the complexities of cinema's appropriation of Western art music. To an extent, the affiliation of Bach with a cannibalistic serial killer rehearses the notion of ‘classical music’ as socially and culturally other. Yet at the same time, from its first appearance in a memorable scene in The Silence of the Lambs (1991), the music is tied to the workings of a mass-media phenomenon. This becomes evident in the sequel, Hannibal (2001), where the ‘Goldberg’ Aria, used as title song, crossing in and out of the diegesis and mixed with sound effects, becomes part of the development of the character into a media franchise, of the romanticizing of his masculinity and the spectacularization of his violence. Thus, in the process of capitalizing on Lecter's success, the saga at once insists on classical music's otherness and blurs its difference from film music.\n\n1 I am using the term mass culture as descriptive of the global strategies of cultural production epitomized by Hollywood ‘event’ movies, that is, cultural products that are pitched at the widest possible audience (as opposed to niche markets and specialized-taste communities) through the help of technologies of mass production and distribution, forms of pervasive advertising and statistical analysis. A famous discussion of Hollywood as a paradigm of mass culture is found in Andreas Huyssen, Modernism, Mass Culture, Postmodernism (Bloomington, IN, 1986). In keeping with Huyssen's influential work, my intention here is not to essentialize the Great Divide, but rather to discuss in detail how the use of Western art music in a Hollywood production can both exploit and blur the dichotomy between high art and mass entertainment. Elsewhere, I have discussed the relationship between the Western art canon and the cultural divide with a focus on ‘cannibalistic’ musical borrowings. See my ‘The Case Against Nyman Revisited: “Affirmative” and “Critical” Evidence in Michael Nyman's Appropriation of Mozart’, Radical Musicology, 1 (2006), 84 pars (11–32), <http://www.radical-musicology.org.uk> (accessed 23 March 2010).\n\n3 For a discussion of this trope and particularly of cinema's tendency to distinguish the villain on the grounds of a weak masculinity, see Harriet Hawkins, Classics and Trash: Traditions and Taboos in High Literature and Popular Modern Genres (Toronto, 1990), 13ff., and Philippa Gates, Detecting Men: Masculinity and the Hollywood Detective Story (Albany, NY, 2006), 253–81. For a discussion of the specific affiliation of villainy with intellectualism and its relation to notions of American national identity, see both Gates, Detecting Men, 254ff., and Linnie Blake, ‘Whoever Fights Monsters: Serial Killers, the FBI, and America's Last Frontier’, The Devil Himself: Villainy in Detective Fiction and Film, ed. Stacy Gillis and Philippa Gates (Westport, CT, 2002), 197–210.\n\n6 To date, Harris has published four novels featuring the character of Hannibal Lecter: Red Dragon (1981), The Silence of the Lambs (1988), Hannibal (1999) and Hannibal Rising (2007). These have provided the material for five films: Michael Mann's Manhunter (1986), a first adaptation of Harris's Red Dragon; Jonathan Demme's The Silence of the Lambs (1991); Ridley Scott's Hannibal (2001); Brett Ratner's Red Dragon (2002), a second adaptation of Harris's first novel; and Peter Webber's Hannibal Rising (2007). Since Demme's The Silence of the Lambs, all the films use Bach's music even where, as in the case of Harris's Red Dragon and Hannibal Rising, the music does not feature in the book.\n\n10 Dyer, ‘Three Questions about Serial Killing’, 112. Thomas Fahy goes further in linking the variations to Lecter's violence, suggesting that ‘like the highly repetitive nature of the Variations and the reprise of the Aria, which both suggest an endless loop, this film presents violence as an ongoing cycle in modern society’. Thomas Fahy, ‘Killer Culture: Classical Music and the Art of Killing in Silence of the Lambs and Se7en’, Journal of Popular Culture, 37 (2003), 28–42 (p. 33).\n\n11 Fahy makes the point that ‘the highly structured form of the piece parallel[s] Hannibal Lecter's cold meticulous nature’. Dyer, ‘Three Questions about Serial Killing’, 112. Thomas Fahy goes further in linking the variations to Lecter's violence, suggesting that ‘like the highly repetitive nature of the Variations and the reprise of the Aria, which both suggest an endless loop, this film presents violence as an ongoing cycle in modern society’. Thomas Fahy, ‘Killer Culture: Classical Music and the Art of Killing in Silence of the Lambs and Se7en’, Journal of Popular Culture, 37 (2003)., 32.\n\n15 For an in-depth analysis of how Gould was labelled a genius from the beginning of his public career and of how visual media insisted on drawing attention to his mannerisms and contributed to turning Gould into a ‘mass-mediated figure in the public domain’, see Graham Carr, ‘Visualising “The Sound of Genius”: Glenn Gould and the Culture of Celebrity in the 1950s’, Journal of Canadian Studies, 40/3 (2006), 5–42.\n\n16 For an in-depth analysis of how Gould was labelled a genius from the beginning of his public career and of how visual media insisted on drawing attention to his mannerisms and contributed to turning Gould into a ‘mass-mediated figure in the public domain’, see Graham Carr, ‘Visualising “The Sound of Genius”: Glenn Gould and the Culture of Celebrity in the 1950s’, Journal of Canadian Studies, 40/3 (2006)., 19–26. For a selected sample of Gould's iconography, see also Glenn Gould: A Life in Pictures, ed. Malcom Lester (Toronto, 2007).\n\n21 This influence has taken many shapes. Gould has acted as sound adviser (for George Roy Hill's Slaughterhouse Five (1971), which features his piano recordings of the Harpsichord Concertos in F minor and D major, as well as a selection of movements from the ‘Goldberg’ Variations), has served as inspiration for actors (in Harvey Keitel's performance of a troubled young pianist in Fingers (1978)), and has been the performer chosen for a number of American films ranging from Mike Hodges's The Terminal Man (1974) to Nights in Rodanthe (2008). During the last two decades, in keeping with his rising posthumous fame, Gould's cinematic incidence has increased. His Bach recordings feature in Unbreakable (2000), Int. Trailer. Night (2002), Solaris (2003) and When Will I Be Loved? (2004). Outside American cinema, he has been the primary subject of cinematic focus in François Girard's Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould (1993) and has appeared as a cartoon character playing Bach in The Triplets of Belleville (2003). About the posthumous, 1990s rise in Gould's popularity, see Bazzana, Wondrous Strange, 2–14. About Keitel's modelling of a ‘“Gouldian” approach to the piano’, see James Toback's audio commentary to the Warner Home Video DVD of Fingers (1979), T6299. For a discussion of the relationship between Gould and visual media, with a particular focus on questions of gender, see Julie Brown, ‘Channeling Gould: Masculinities from Television to New Hollywood’, Music in Television, ed. James Deaville (London, 2011), 183–97.\n\n22 The Aria's marginal relationship to the dominant discourse of Bach's music is powerfully encapsulated in the musicological controversy about its authenticity. Doubts about the Aria's authorship were famously raised by Bach scholar Frederick Neumann; see his ‘Bach: Progressive or Conservative and the Authorship of the Goldberg Aria’, Musical Quarterly, 71 (1985), 281–94. For Neumann, ‘The Aria is a galant piece, but it is quite certainly not by Bach.’ Neumann's argument was part of his rebuttal of an influential article by Robert Marshall which used the ‘Goldberg’ Variations, and in particular the Aria, as part of a reassessment of Bach's relationship to the pre-classical or galant style. Of course what concerns us here is not the issue of authorship per se, but the fact that the Aria, as a galant piece, has been constructed against the trope of Bach's ‘brain music’ and ‘pure theoretical speculation’. Various authors have remarked on the piece's unusual nature and its kinship to the empfindsamer Stil of C. P. E. Bach. See for example David Schulenberg, The Keyboard Music of J. S. Bach (New York and London, 2006), 377, and Richard Jones, ‘The Keyboard Works: Bach as Teacher and Virtuoso’, The Cambridge Companion to Bach, ed. John Butt (Cambridge, 1997), 136–53 (p. 148).\n\n26 In Carroll's terms, this would make Lecter a ‘figure of fusion’, a figure that compounds ‘disjointed or conflicting categories in an integral, spatio-temporally unified individual’. Carroll, The Philosophy of Horror, 44. Along these theoretical lines, Lecter's monstrosity has been discussed in terms of ‘liminality’ and ‘boundary-breaking’, ‘oxymoronic implosion of definitions’ and ‘pollution of the moral environment’. See respectively Messent, ‘American Gothic’, 13–14; Barry Taylor, ‘The Violence of the Event: Hannibal Lecter in the Lyotardian Sublime’, Postmodern Surroundings, ed. Steven Earnshaw (Amsterdam, 1994), 215–30 (p. 219); and Philip L. Simpson, Psycho-Paths: Tracking the Serial Killer through Contemporary American Film and Fiction (Carbondale, IL, 2000), 10.\n\n36 In her discussion of this scene, Robynn Stilwell similarly highlights the coexistence of contrasting interpretative frameworks, focusing on the complex patterns of empathy and anempathy at play in the scene. Building on her considerations, I am arguing that these patterns are organized in a precise temporal trajectory, and that their unfolding is accompanied by a shift in paradigms of listening and conceptions of music. See Robynn Stilwell, ‘The Fantastical Gap between Diegetic and Nondiegetic’, Beyond the Soundtrack: Representing Music in Cinema, ed. Daniel Goldmark, Lawrence Kramer and Richard Leppert (Berkeley, CA, 2007), 184–202 (pp. 190–3).\n\n54 Within the context of action film, Robynn Stilwell has shown how even in movies such as Die Hard (1988), which seemingly reinforce the stereotypical polarization of ‘brute force and native cunning […] versus intellectual sophistication’, the music can open up alternative interpretative possibilities, potentially undercutting and subverting the protagonists’ roles, and allowing the viewer to read against the grain of the text's dominant voice. See Robynn Stilwell, ‘“I just put a drone under him …”: Collage and Subversion in the Score of “Die Hard”’, Music and Letters, 78 (1997), 551–80. What I am suggesting here is that in the Hannibal saga, with the conspicuous absence of a male hero and the elevation of the serial killer to media franchise, the possibility of cheering for Lecter becomes central to the films’ mechanism of distribution and consumption. In this sense, Hannibal can be seen to lead to extreme consequences an ambivalence always potentially present in cinema's long-standing flirtation with the figure of the murderer.\n\n75 The money shot, as Linda Williams puts it, is ‘a shot whose name derives from mainstream film industry slang for the film image that costs the most money to produce’. Williams famously discusses the shot and its seeking for ‘maximum visibility’ in her cultural analysis of the porn industry. See Linda Williams, Hard Core: Power, Pleasure, and the ‘Frenzy of the Visible’ (Berkeley, CA, 1999), 95."
