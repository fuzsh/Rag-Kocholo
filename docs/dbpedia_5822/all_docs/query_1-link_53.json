        "text": "By Lynn Venhaus\n\nA glorious, glamorous, and grand gem of a good-time show, “Anything Goes” celebrates everything I love about musical theater – big splashy dance numbers, sophisticated songs, light-hearted comedy and dreamy romance.\n\nAnd it’s everything Muny audiences have become fond of over the years, reminding us why this 106-year-old institution is a source of civic pride and family tradition in St. Louis.\n\nWith inspired choreography by Jared Grimes, sharp-witted direction by Marcia Milgrom Dodge, sumptuous musical direction by Ben Whiteley, and many shining standouts in a beguiling cast, its charms are limitless.\n\nWhile Cole Porter’s beloved breezy romp has been a crowd-pleasing show five times before, since its local 1940 debut, this fresh interpretation is a spectacular introduction – or re-introduction – to one of the all-time greats of the American theatre.\n\nIt’s been 25 years since it was here. “You’re the Top,” “Friendship” and “I Get a Kick Out of You” remind us of Porter’s legendary wit and cultural impact. And that showstopping title song that closes out Act One? That’s the pinnacle every creator strives for, and Muny magic made Grimes’ vision happen with lots of happy feet and sweat equity. Kudos to sound designers John Shivers and David Patridge for the rat-a-tats and more.\n\nSimply put, the laugh-out-loud experience made people happy – smiles abounded, and a spring was in our step as we exited for the last time this summer of 2024. Talk about a jovial way to chase the blues away!\n\nNot only did the weather provide a beautiful night for the season’s frisky finale, but even the super blue moon cooperated with a special moonglow. It was if we were all aboard the S.S. American, a luxury ocean liner bound for London, forgetting our troubles and being whisked away to a time of technicolor Hollywood musicals filmed on an MGM lot.\n\nThe escapist setting – as reinforced through stunning hues of azure, blue, aqua and turquoise – is 1934, post-Great Depression and post-Prohibition. It is also a period where headline-hogging criminals were treated as celebrities (Public Enemies!), and evangelists were also media darlings. Hence, some barbed social satire zingers.\n\nThe creative team’s impeccable attention to detail might be the most impressive takeaway of the evening. Each artisan’s handiwork is indelibly noted in the clever construction on every crevice of that expansive stage.\n\nThis classic’s vitality was showcased in everything from Rob Denton’s resplendent lighting design — a thunder-and-lightning storm! — to Tristan Raines’ luxe costume design, with innovative video designer Kylee Loera’s exquisite art deco nods meshing splendidly with award-winning Edward E. Haynes Jr.’s transporting scenic design.\n\nAn extraordinary ensemble broadly delivered high-seas hijinks with the zesty cheekiness of the Marx Brothers and the grace of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, balancing lush vocals with peppy dance routines and snappy repartee. Grimes’ steps seemed to have an extra flair added to the choreography, which was striking in execution. Another special nod to production stage manager Kelsey Tippins for the show’s zippy flow.\n\nThe performers couldn’t be more endearing — as if you’re watching a marathon on Turner Classic Movies, only it exhilarates like only live theater can produce.\n\nCredit is overdue for the casting choices by associate artistic director Michael Baxter, who worked closely with the Telsey office (Jimmy Larkin and Alex Cortinas), and artistic director and executive producer Mike Isaacson, because these are noteworthy smart decisions, everyone well-suited for the roles from chorus to principals.\n\nThe refurbished book by Timothy Crouse and John Weidman keeps the wacky framework first established by P.G. Wodehouse and Guy Bolton in 1934 and revised by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse in 1962 but erases problematic cultural stereotypes without missing a beat.\n\nTimothy Crouse, an American journalist and writer, wrote the new book that was used in the acclaimed 1987 (Patti LuPone) and 2011 (Sutton Foster) revivals that both won Tony Awards. The Muny is using his 1987 Lincoln Center version. He is the son of playwright Russel Crouse.\n\nDodge, who imbued a vintage vibe like mashing up “A Night at the Opera,’ “Duck Soup” and “The Court Jester,” leaned into the comic chaos of mistaken identities and pesky entanglements. The performers obliged with quick-witted quips, silly slapstick and actual belly laughs. (Hilarity ensued with Moonface Martin and a missing dog “Cheeky” – you just must see it.)\n\nNewcomer Kevin Chamberlin’s Moonface impressed mightily as his considerable comic gifts became apparent. A three-time Tony nominee, he has a long list of film and television credits, including as the butler Bertram on the Disney Channel’s sitcom “Jessie.”\n\nHe was a terrific scene partner for Adrianna Hicks, who sparkled as gun moll Erma. Making a vivacious debut, she was exuberant in her solo “Buddie, Beware.” Hicks played Sugar in “Some Like It Hot” and Aragon” in “Six” on Broadway.\n\nKimberly Immanuel personified sweet and conflicted Hope Harcourt, a debutante who has fallen for Billy Crocker, who is trying to be respectable working on Wall Street but is something of a rake. She’s an elegant dancer and polished in delivering ballads.\n\nImmanuel paired beautifully with romantic hero Jay Armstrong Johnson, who has vividly brought to life iconic roles at the Muny like Jack Kelly in 2017’s “Newsies,” Barnaby Tucker in 2014’s “Hello, Dolly!” and Billy Lawlor in 2016’s “42nd Street.”\n\nHis accomplished dancing, singing and acting skills illustrated Billy Crocker’s personality well, not unlike what you expect in Gene Kelly.\n\nTheir “Easy to Love” and “All Through the Night” were wistful and touching, while “It’s De-Lovely” showed off a merry side.\n\nWhile the talent has multiple triple threats, perhaps the performer making the most of his stage time was a delightful George Abud as Sir Evelyn Oakleigh, a stuffed shirt royal who quickly warms up to American customs. His befuddled but gallant Oakleigh is reminiscent of both Danny Kaye and British comic actor Terry Thomas.\n\nAnchoring this crisp and snappy group was Jeanna de Waal as the saucy and cosmopolitan nightclub singer-evangelist Reno Sweeney. She could belt, she could swagger, she could wisecrack – and she could spellbind with dazzling tap-dancing moves.\n\nLast seen in the title role of “Mary Poppins” here in 2022, she revealed new strengths. And looked mighty fine in designer Kelley Jordan’s stylish blonde wig and Raines’ glittery garb. She looked and moved like Carole Lombard.\n\nFan favorites Lara Teeter wildly exaggerated inebriated Ivy League businessman Elisha J. Whitney and Ann Harada was swift in feigning outrage and nimble physicality as the social climbing socialite Mrs. Evangeline Harcourt.\n\nEric Jordan Young, a dandy Cogsworth in last summer’s “Disney’s Beauty and the Beast,” was the ship’s captain, recalling Gavin MacLeod’s Captain Stubing on “The Love Boat.”\n\nKristen Grace Brown, Candace Hatakeyama, Bethany Ann Tesarck and Danielle Jackman strutted superbly as Reno’s Angels – Purity, Chastity, Charity and Virtue, as did Carina-Kay Louchiey as trumpet blower Gabriel.\n\nAs the lively scallywags Spit and Dippy, Spencer Jones and Joe Capstick were a memorable addition.\n\nPortraying sailors and other roles were C.K. Edwards, Michael Harp, Colin Bradbury, John Manzari, Cole Newburg, Lamont Brown, Alaman Diadhiou, Ryan Lambert, and Alex Hayden Miller. Lauralyn McLelland was tasked with playing “Woman in Bathchair.”\n\n“Anything Goes” is both the icing and the cherry on top of an outstanding Muny season that’s been marked by an overwhelming sense of joy and community in every musical this 106th season.\n\nAs everyone bid adieu in a bittersweet farewell, a rousing curtain call summed up what’s singular about the Muny: it’s a communal feeling that can’t be duplicated and only happens under the stars, right here in St. Louis.\n\nThe Muny presents Cole Porter’s “Anything Goes” Aug. 19 – 25 at 8:15 p.m. nightly on the outdoor stage at Forest Park.

She writes features and news for Belleville News-Democrat and contributes to St. Louis magazine and other publications.\n\nShe is a Rotten Tomatoes-approved film critic, currently reviews films for Webster-Kirkwood Times and KTRS Radio, covers entertainment for PopLifeSTL.com and co-hosts podcast PopLifeSTL.com…Presents.\n\nShe is a member of Critics Choice Association, where she serves on the women’s and marketing committees; Alliance of Women Film Journalists; and on the board of the St. Louis Film Critics Association. She is a founding and board member of the St. Louis Theater Circle.\n\nShe is retired from teaching journalism/media as an adjunct college instructor.\n\nBy Lynn Venhaus\n\nNeither original nor groundbreaking, “Blink Twice” is a logic-free revenge tale that fails to convince in its twist-filled horror-suspense scenario.\n\nPopulated by pretty people playing vapid characters that are woefully underdeveloped, the film’s intent is a good one, but it is so poorly executed that by the time you understand what’s going on, it still leaves gaping holes in any kind of realistic plot.\n\nWhen tech billionaire Slater King (Channing Tatum) meets catering waitress Frida (Naomi Ackie) at his fundraising gala, sparks fly. He invites her to join him and his friends for a fantasy vacation on his private island.\n\nNo worries on not having underwear or toothbrushes, all is provided at this extravagant luxe resort – the women will all be wearing the same white sarongs and swimsuits. And same perfume. Hmmm…\n\nWhat “King” does or how he made his billions is vague, as are his reasons for stepping away from the business (eluding to a #MeToo incident but no specifics). The film is always light on specifics.\n\nThe sketchy, skimpy plot involves some scientific know-how, so is that one of his skills? Don’t ask too many questions, because we’re just supposed to watch, not understand – or be drawn in by any sort of character revelation.\n\nDebut director Zoe Kravitz, who wrote the screenplay with E. T. Feigenbaum, has opted for a trouble-in-paradise story that quickly wears out its welcome. In trying to emulate “Get Out” and “Promising Young Woman,” this mystery-thriller reminds us how very special Jordan Peele and Emerald Fennell’s Oscar-winning original screenplays were (key word ‘original’).\n\nLacking that game-changing acuity, Kravitz has created a tropical paradise setting a la “White Lotus” – or “The Menu,” with nods to the “Knives Out” franchise. However, it does look beautiful and enticing, and the director, a savvy actress, favors close-ups amply provided by cinematographer Adam Newport-Berry.\n\nIt’s 24/7 party people, an endless parade of fun in the sun, where champagne flows non-stop and wild nights involve drug-taking (“with intention”!?!). Until it’s not – like a bad hangover that keeps pounding away. There are nasty-looking snakes slithering around the island – a metaphor, perhaps?\n\nWhen the reality check takes place – and no spoilers here – the conclusion feels unearned. Head-scratching plot twists abound.\n\nNaomi Ackie, who was terrific as Whitney Houston in the 2022 biopic “I Wanna Dance with Somebody,” is the sweet but transparently ambitious waitress with stars-in-her-eyes, tantalized by the reckless abandonment she’s a part of, along with best friend Alia Shawkat as Jess (a fine turn).\n\nShe befriends the snobby and cynical reality TV star Sarah – feistily played by Adria Arjona – and they become an army in the darkness. (I will say that’s believable, for sisterhoods happen in the strangest places.)\n\nGeena Davis is Slater’s scatterbrained sister Stacy who is always carrying an armful of red giftbags and mumbling things. Hmmm…Her ditzy presence is odd and unexplained, as is Kyle MacLachlan as Slater’s therapist. He has an air of mystery – and deviousness – but that’s not explored either.\n\nThe male cast plays mostly characters who work for Slater. There’s the tech whiz kid Lucas, portrayed by Levon Hawke (son of Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman, brother to actress Maya); Simon Rex embodies chef Cody who takes great delight in preparing Michelin-starred restaurant cuisine for the guests; Haley Joel Osment is a nondescript Tom, a pleasant-enough go-along; and Christian Slater is Vic, not really sure of his status but he seems like a right-hand man.\n\nThings don’t add up, tables turn, things fall apart. End of story. Or is it? So much is crammed into the final third act that it’s dizzying – and ludicrous — in its so-called resolutions, but they don’t wrap up plot points raised or add any more reasoning to characters that are hard to accept, let alone connect to in any way. Hedonism is not enough of a reason to watch.\n\nCue the “Twilight Zone” theme song. Again, reminding us of much better movies and social satires aimed at the ruling class and their conspicuous entitlement, not to mention casual disregard to treat people as human beings.\n\n“Blink Twice” is all surface glamour turned grisly, a stunning picture-postcard of a film that is ultimately unsatisfying if you are looking for more than girls gone wild, and kicks gone wrong.\n\n“Blink Twice” is a 2024 horror-mystery-thriller directed by Zoe Kravitz and starring Channing Tatum, Naomi Ackie, Alia Shawkat, Christian Slater, Haley Joel Osment, Simon Rex, Geena Davis, Adria Arjoni, and Levon Hawke.

His latest role as Gooper, the resentful and ruthless son of Big Daddy, who schemes to control his family’s fortune, in “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,” is a fine example of his commitment to a character.\n\nDisplaying a big chip on his shoulder because his handsome and athletic brother Brick was favored by his parents, White is smooth and shrewd in the supporting role.\n\nThis delectable story of big drama, big money and big lies, presented by the Tennessee Williams Festival St. Louis Aug. 8 – 18, is a Southern Gothic excursion into an American dysfunctional family, 1950s style, that won a Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1955, and Williams considered it his favorite.\n\nWhite is thrilled to be in this ensemble.\n\n“Simply put, ‘Cat’ is one of the greatest American plays by one of the greatest American playwrights, and it’s just an honor to be part of it,” White said. “We have a fantastic cast, and we are being led by director Michael Wilson, who is a renowned Tennessee Williams expert…It has been an honor and a pleasure to work with this team.”\n\nWhite’s love for the material is evident, and he has previously been part of the Tennessee Williams Festival St. Louis, from its first year, performing in “The Rooming House Plays” in 2016, and in “Small Craft Warnings” in 2017.\n\nThroughout his career, he has moved easily between hero and villain roles, showing his versatility, and becoming a reliable fixture of the professional regional theater community. He is a member of Actors’ Equity Association and SAG-AFTRA.\n\nRelishing a unique opportunity to play the most evil villain of them all, he won a St. Louis Theater Circle Award as an arrogant calculating Satan in “The Last Days of Judas Iscariot,” presented by Mustard Seed Theatre in 2018.\n\nHe has been nominated four other times, his first nod for playing Felix Turner, the doomed New York Times fashion reporter and activist Ned Weeks’ lover who succumbs to AIDS, in “The Normal Heart” at HotCity Theatre in 2014, which also won the award for outstanding production of a drama.\n\nHis other nominations show his impressive range. Earning three nominations in a row, he played a brash guy whose encounter with a stranger on a walk leads to more conversations in “The Kiss” at Upstream Theatre in 2015; Daisy’s exasperated son Boolie in “Driving Miss Daisy” at the New Jewish Theatre in 2016; and recognized as a conflicted fundamentalist Christian minister in the puppet comedy “Hand to God” at St. Louis Actors’ Studio in 2022.\n\nEarlier this year, he stood out in dual roles in The Black Repertory Theatre’s “Hold On!” as hot-headed intolerant bigots Alabama Gov. George Wallace and Dallas County Sheriff Jim Clark. The play was about the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 after the Selma to Montgomery March organized by civil rights activists.\n\nHe has played a cruel racist before, as impresario Stephen Price in “The African Company Presents Richard III” at the Black Rep in 2022, and as a Hitler apologist in Neil LaBute’s one-act “The Fourth Reich” that was presented in 2018 during the LaBute New Theater Festival and off-Broadway in January 2019. (He’s been a frequent contributor in the LaBute Festival).\n\nHis work in “Hold On!” was in January, soon after delighting audiences as a seasoned radio announcer in The Repertory Theatre’s triumphant comeback “It’s a Wonderful Life! – A Live Radio Play” in December.\n\nWith his mellifluous voice, he played Freddie Filmore and amusingly delivered commercials for Schnucks, Crown Candy Kitchen, Ted Drewes, and other St. Louis notables.\n\nThis fall, he returns to The Rep in their season opener, the classic mystery “Dial M for Murder.” He will play the eccentric but thorough Inspector Hubbard. In announcing the cast, they described him as a “Rep favorite.”\n\nThe play, to be directed by Melissa Rain Anderson, who deftly helmed “The Play That Goes Wrong” in 2019, will run Sept. 18 – Oct. 13 at the Loretto-Hilton Center on the campus of Webster University.\n\nHe joins the cast that includes Jenelle Chu as Margot, Jordan Coughtry as her former tennis pro husband Tony, Jayson Heil as their friend Max, Ethan Dunne Stewart as police officer Thompson and David Diaz Weynand as Lesgate, Tony’s old schoolmate.\n\nFrederick Knott’s play, which inspired Alfred Hitchcock’s 1954 cinematic thriller, combines passion, blackmail and revenge into an edge-of-your-seat murder mystery when a gold-digging husband’s perfect crime misfires, trapping all parties in a sinister and dangerous web of lies.\n\nHe is home on The Rep’s mainstage, for he appeared as the Ghost of Christmas Future in “A Christmas Carol” and as Mrs. Bennett’s brother Mr. Gardiner in “Pride and Prejudice.”\n\nHe has also performed in other regional theaters around the country, including Houston and Arkansas. He appeared on an episode of “Chicago Fire” in 2015, and has acted in locally shot films, including “Finch,” “Penitentia,” “Cringe” and “Belleville.”\n\nFor White, keeping busy in an industry in flux is gratifying. When he’s not working on stage or off, he’s husband to Wendy and dad to daughters Payton and Cassidy.\n\nTake Ten Q & A with Eric Dean White\n\n1.Why did you choose your profession/pursue the arts?\n\n“That’s a very good question and I ask myself that all the time. It’s almost absurd in a way how difficult it is to work professionally in any form of the arts. The rejection and inconsistency of work takes its toll on you. But the simple fact is I love it and maybe more importantly, I’m fascinated by it. Plus, people keep hiring me, so I keep saying yes!”\n\n2. How would your friends describe you?\n\n“Eric Dean White? Never heard of him.”\n\n3. How do you like to spend your spare time?\n\n“What is this “spare time” you speak of?”\n\n4. What is your current obsession?\n\n(This was asked before it concluded). “The 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris! Specifically, men’s and women’s soccer and women’s gymnastics.”\n\n5. What would people be surprised to find out about you?\n\n“I’m extremely sensitive to — and irritated by — certain sounds and noises. Often to the point that I have to leave the room.”\n\n6. Can you share one of your most defining moments in life?\n\n“Meeting Wendy.”\n\n7. Who do you admire most?\n\n“I’m hesitant to place too much admiration on individual people. I’m very moved by acts of selflessness and grace — especially when no one is watching.”\n\n8. What is at the top of your bucket list?\n\n“I’d like to travel more in the coming years. Haven’t been able to do much of that as of late.”\n\n9. How were you affected by the pandemic years, and anything you would like to share about what got you through and any lesson learned during the isolation periods? Any reflections on how the arts were affected? And what it means to move forward?\n\n“The pandemic was terrible for the live arts. There is no way to sugar coat it. I’m not sure if we will ever get back to where we were before the pandemic. There is very little interest in public funding of the arts via state and federal governments and corporate funding has also dried up. I don’t know what the path forward is. There are arts leaders much smarter than me doing all they can to try and figure out a path forward. I wish them luck. I encourage individuals to buy tickets to see live theatre and other performances.”\n\n10. What is your favorite thing to do in St. Louis?\n\n“I love going to Cardinals, St. Louis City SC and Blues games. I love going to all of our parks and museums. I love all the various art, food and cultural festivals we have. Oh – and St. Louis has a fantastic theatre and music scene!”\n\nMore About Eric Dean White:\n\nAge: 49\n\nBirthplace: Sikeston, Missouri\n\nCurrent location: St. Louis (City),\n\nFamily: One wife, two daughters, one pit bull\n\nEducation: Studied marketing at the University of Missouri and acting at The American Academy of Dramatic Arts (New York City campus)\n\nDay job: Visitor and Member Services at the Saint Louis Art Museum\n\nFirst play or movie you were involved in or made: I didn’t do any acting of any kind until I was about 24 years old.

Now be transported to those days through the lens of a young Tennessee Willams in a smart, thoughtful and charming presentation, “Life Upon the Wicked Stage.”\n\nWhen the future Pulitzer-Prize winning playwright was finding his place in the world, as an aspiring writer in St. Louis, he was drawn to the moving pictures of the 1920s and 1930s. With stars in his eyes and a vivid imagination, he wrote short stories and one-acts where he wondered what it would be like to be famous and in show business.\n\nThreading songs of vaudeville together in a stylish program featuring his theatrical slice-of-life one-acts “In Our Profession,” “The Magic Tower” and “The Fat Man’s Wife,” the Tennessee Williams Festival has taken a novel approach to storytelling while spotlighting Grand Center as a vibrant part of the St. Louis arts community.\n\nThis pitch-perfect cast is under the astute direction of Brian Hohlfeld, who helmed the masterful “The Glass Menagerie” in 2021 and excelled in radio play presentations “Something Spoken.”\n\nThey are convincing in taking us back to a golden era: Julie Layton, Gary Wayne Barker, Dominic DeCicco, Julia Crump and Donna Weinsting appear like characters out of “Stage Door,” with lovely vintage outfits expertly assembled by costume designer Teresa Doggett.\n\nDuring the past nine years, the festival has been built around a theme or location specific to Williams’ life in St. Louis and other influences on his world-renowned career. Dreamer Tom Williams must have felt at home among the avant-garde artists and smoky jazz clubs in midtown, identifying with the hopes and restlessness of showbiz folks.\n\nOne of the most enriching aspects of this unique local festival is showcasing his lesser-known one-act plays, and we can witness an artist developing his voice, and this collection is splendid.\n\nThat impact of the popular entertainment of his youth, and his desire to be a part of the glamorous life, is evident in these richly textured depictions staged simply in an intimate retro setting.\n\nIn these three curated one-acts, he has fashioned erudite backstage dramas about the nomadic life of touring performers, its toll on private lives, and a more jaded look at those with long-established careers.\n\nIn this trio, Julie Layton’s remarkable portrayals as Annabelle, during phases of the character’s life as an actress, is the person that connects them all. (Poetic license used in keeping the same female protagonist, but it works well).\n\nAs she slips into this woman’s particular periods with ease, she deftly conveys different emotional needs as the role dictates. Layton was part of two very popular festival works, the St. Louis Theater Circle Award-winner “A Lovely Sunday for Creve Coeur” and “Will Mr. Merriwether Return from Memphis?” in 2017, along with an earlier appearance as Annabelle in “The Rooming House Plays.”\n\nIn “In Our Profession,” Layton is a ditzy, needy ingenue who clings to an older gentleman, an exasperated Richard superbly embodied by Barker, who is not prepared for Anabelle’s overstepping her boundaries by pushing him to marry her after only one night together in St. Louis.\n\nShe sees him as a ticket to stability, her chance to get off the road. He tries to free himself from her clutches. Dominic DeCicco is his naïve neighbor Paul, whom she takes an immediately liking to, which complicates her plans. If only her desire for escape was that easy.\n\nIn the middle one, “The Magic Tower,” Annabelle is a lovesick newlywed who is married to a struggling starving artist, Jim, sweetly played by DeCicco. She’d like to shut out the world with a fantasy life in their dismal studio apartment but reality intrudes.\n\nWeinsting is their landlord Mrs. Fallon, trying to collect overdue rent, and two friends also stop by with a proposal of their own — Crump is her chorus-girl pal Babe and Barker is Mitch, who is part of the touring company she left. Will she come down to earth?\n\nIn the final work, “The Fat Man’s Wife,” Annabelle comes full circle as a cynical former actress who married a prominent producer, Joe (Barker). It’s New Year’s Eve, 1938, and she embodies a sophisticated Lauren Bacall-type, whose flirtation with a promising young playwright Dennis (DeCicco) during a party, spills over to a quarrel at home.\n\nThe hotshot stops by to try to convince her to run away with him while her husband is having a clandestine tryst. Will she opt for a tantalizing unknown adventure or her routine life of luxury?\n\nThis is the strongest of the three and all displays Williams’ keen psychological insight into dashed hopes and dreams, and mismtched couplings. They each offer fascinating different perspectives about gypsy entertainers and the uncertainties they face.\n\nThe Curtain Call Lounge, which is operated by the Fox Theatre next door, is a savvy venue choice, for with its bygone era décor, it harkens back to that time when vaudeville and moving pictures were still flourishing on that Grand Boulevard strip.\n\nWith a natural vocal delivery, Crump and Weinsting sing standards, with Weinsting distinctly presenting the showstopper “I’m Still Here,” Stephen Sondheim’s 1971 classic from “Follies” about the resilience of longtime chanteuses and their rollercoaster ride in show business.\n\nBoth Crump and Weinsting were part of the TWStL’s first season’s triumphant “The Rooming House Plays” in 2016 and Crump notably has made an impression in “You Lied to Me About Centralia,” “The Rose Tattoo,” and “Stairs to the Roof.”\n\nSongs include “Skylark,” “My Blue Heaven,” “Side by Side,” “Pennies from Heaven” and “Some of These Days,” with esteemed music director Tom Clear accompanying on piano.\n\nSpencer Lawton keeps things on point as the stage manager, and the entire effort revitalizes Williams’ earlier works in a most appealing way. The attractive production elements endear and the performances are irresistible.\n\nThis is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon seeing the legendary playwright develop his unmistakable style right here in St. Louis, which will hopefully deepen appreciation for his considerable gifts.\n\nThe Tennessee Williams Festival St. Louis presents “Life Upon the Wicked Stage” in eight performances, at 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays, Aug. 10 and 17 and Aug. 11 and 18 at the Curtain Call Lounge, 521 N. Grand Blvd 63108. The bar is open during performances. Tickets are available through MetroTix. Parking is available at a discount in the Fox Garage (mention the festival for the sale price).

Face huggers? Chest busters? You got it.\n\nThe “Romulus” sequel does feel aimed at young viewers new to the franchise, so if you are a longtime fan seeking something fresh and different, “Romulus” may disappoint.\n\nSince Ridley Scott blazed a trail with his terrifying “Alien” science fiction-action-horror film in 1979, three sequels and two prequels have broadened the franchise built on space travelers’ suspenseful encounters with an extraterrestrial species.\n\nThese grotesque ooze-dripping creatures called “Xenomorphs” look like a large head atop a giant insect-reptile hybrid spin on the “Creature from the Black Lagoon,” and they remain as terrifying now as when the original just teased the look as the creepy invader of the Nostromo.\n\nFun fact: Swiss artist H.R. Giger known for his biomechanical style, created the adult form ‘Alien,’ inspired by his painting “Necronom IV,” and won an Oscar in 1980 for being part of the visual effects team.\n\nThe image is still the frightening gold standard. Director Fede Alvarez goes much bigger, ramping up the gore and the goo. He focuses on repetitive graphic depictions of these hostile lifeforms in all their stages of growth, multiplying them, showing their gnarly sharp teeth in close-ups and face-to-face encounters.\n\nScott returns as a producer, after directing two prequels “Prometheus” (2012) and “Alien: Covenant” (2017), handing off directing duties to Alvarez, who displayed strong horror-genre skills with “Don’t Breathe” (2016) and “Evil Dead” (2013), a remake of Sam Raimi’s classic 1981 film.\n\n“Romulus” takes place between the original’s time and the 1986 sequel “Aliens,” so it’s about mid-22nd century. The story follows a grungy group of intergalactic colonists who want to raid a space station for valuables, but instead discover it is infested with hideous invasive creatures who begin hunting them. Blood spurts, body parts are severed, and the classic Agatha Christie template “And Then There Were None,” kicks into high gear.\n\nCinematographer Galo Olivares has created an atmosphere that is dystopian-future bleak, and everything’s grimy and dark – and claustrophobic. The young adults have been working at the Jackson Star Colony Mine, on a planet with no sunlight, and it’s a miserable prison-like existence. No wonder they want to escape for space travel.\n\nYou surmise as soon as they enter what they think is an abandoned out-of-service spaceship that it’s a bad idea, and most of these savvy techies/space cowboys will either become a host to the endoparasitoids, or shredded to smithereens, suffering elaborate grisly deaths.\n\nWhile the visuals dominate, there isn’t much character depth in the screenplay by Alvarez and his “Don’t Breathe” writing partner Rodo Sayagues. Instead, they emphasize scare tactics and dangerous situations that the cast must either flee from or figure out a better way for survival.\n\nThe movie takes too long to set up, is confusing, and doesn’t quite know how to stick the landing. So, it’s hard to connect with any of them other than the two leads, Rain (Cailee Spaeny) and Andy (David Jonsson), a synthetic android she considers her brother.\n\nThe roles are physically demanding because everyone is in fight and flight mode 24/7 and running a lot. Aileen Wu is Navarro, Spike Fearn is her boyfriend Bjorn, Archie Renaux is Tyler and Isabela Merced is his younger sister Kay. Ian Holm, who was in the first movie as Ash, reappears here digitally as an android, but as Rook (note: Holm died in 2020).\n\nIn addition to the life-threatening creatures overwhelming the colonists, we are reminded that the megacorporation Weyland-Yutani Corporation is always up to no good. They care more about profits than people, and have been a manipulative villain thread through the series.\n\nSpaeny, who made a splash last year as the title role in Sofia Coppola’s “Priscilla” and this year in “Civil War,” is in the Ellen Ripley mold of rising to the occasion and becoming the tough and determined heroine. Rain is resourceful, resilient, and compassionate – all the qualities that make for a good protagonist.\n\nJonsson, who played Gus in the HBO series “Industry,” has the more nuanced, difficult role, and he stands out as the most compelling – switching personalities from a docile, guileless, glitchy “synth” to a smart android who suspiciously knows more than he divulges.\n\nThe third act goes on for far too long, and even though the film is 2 hours, it feels longer. Just when you think it’s over, not so fast, and there is one plot twist that’s not just ridiculous, but disgusting and disturbing.\n\nOne of the film’s most admirable qualities is that, like “Godzilla Minus One,” they went old-school with the visual effects. Instead of making mostly a heavy green-screen movie, Alvarez employed members of the special effects crew from the 1986 “Aliens” to work on the creatures. They developed animatronics, miniatures and used ‘a guy in a suit’ wherever possible.\n\nThe Alien franchise has also spawned video games, a television show “Alien: Earth,” and a crossover series “Alien vs. Predator,” so its staying power is undeniable.\n\nBuried underneath the repulsive monsters and the gruesome situations is a story that needed further investigation. It would have boosted the likability to provide character backstories, and not just rely on nostalgia for what’s gone on before as the driving force.\n\n“Alien: Romulus” is a 2024 science fiction-actor-horror movie directed by Fede Alvarez and starring Caely Spaeny, David Jonsson, Archie Renaux, Spike Fearn, Isabela Merced, Aileen Wu and Ian Holm. It is rated R for bloody violent content and language, and the runtime is 1 hour, 59 minutes. It opened in theatres Aug. 16.

You feel the joy.\n\nIn an exciting and much-anticipated Muny premiere, this 2009 Tony-winning musical bursts with high-spirited performances and exuberant, inventive choreography that combines salsa, hip-hop, jazz, ballet and Afro-Cuban moves.\n\nUsing all the exceptional production tools available at America’s largest outdoor theater, this “In the Heights” will wow the unfamiliar and satisfy its devotees. You can feel a connection form as the show unfolds for the first time in this environment.\n\nWhile honoring his Latin heritage and traditions, creative force of nature Lin-Manuel Miranda’s inspirational scenario, lyrics and music about people chasing their dreams related in such a universal way that it ushered in a directional change in music theater storytelling.\n\nMiranda, who went on to worldwide acclaim with the cultural phenomenon “Hamilton” and the smash hit Disney film “Encanto,” conceived the musical while still in college, wrote the songs, and originated the lead role, but the book was written by Quiara Alegria Hudes.\n\nHudes has included strong women characters, which is rare and impactful. Miranda was the first composer to put hip-hop lyrics in a Broadway show — and the youngest to win the Tony for Best Music Score in 2009 (the show was nominated for 13 awards), and his influence continues to grow. He breaks barriers, and the Muny is mindful of marking historic milestones too.\n\nSet in the Washington Heights neighborhood in New York City, where he grew up, the story takes place over three days during a blistering summer heat wave in the barrio. This is a neighborhood on the brink of change – businesses face economic uncertainty, tensions rise.\n\nThis ultimately jubilant celebration of Latin heritage and identity includes family ties to the Caribbean islands, Dominican Republic, Cuba, Puerto Rico and Mexico, and a highlight is when the cast displays flags from their characters’ countries of origin.\n\nIn the vigorous opening title number, we are introduced to the personalities and places that are woven together in this corner of the world. The Muny has been transformed by the colorful sights and sounds as the characters deal with everyday realities hoping for a better day.\n\nIn a warm, welcoming debut, Benji Santiago endears as lovable hard-working Usnavi de la Vega, who operates the corner bodega. A community hub, he sells coffee, sodas, snacks and lottery tickets while he dreams of moving to somewhere tropical where he thinks he can find happiness. When his store is notified a winning lottery ticket has been sold, things may change.\n\nUsnavi describes himself as “a streetlight, chillin’ in the heat/ I illuminate the stories of the people on the street!”\n\nThe appealing young performer is nimble in guiding the action as we move from store to Rosario’s car service to Daniela’s beauty salon, homes, balconies and the bustling streets – on a nifty gritty grid design by Arnel Sancianco that captured the distinct ambiance and sleekly used the asset that is the monstrous turntable for deft transitions. He was the set designer for last year’s “Rent” and the year before’s “The Color Purple.”\n\nUsnavi’s devotion to his family and friends is evident throughout, even when he’s grumbling. Santiago masterfully anchored this show that seems to be perpetually in motion, and he is joined by an equally dynamic ensemble, all but two new to the Muny..\n\nNancy Ticotin is a sensational Abuela Claudia, Usnavi’s beloved confidante, who is heart-tugging in “Paciencia y Fe (Patience and Faith)” and “Hundreds of Stories.” She’s everybody’s ‘grandma,’ dispensing love and advice.\n\nAriana Burks as sweet Nina, a standout student who feels she has let everyone down by dropping out of a prestigious college, gains sympathy by explaining her sad situation in “Respira (Breathe).” She is soulful in her tender ballad “Everything I Know” (tissue time) that’s a tribute to Abuela Claudia.\n\nIn a romantic arc, she pairs well with earnest Benny, and Alex Joseph Grayson is likeable from his introduction number “Benny’s Dispatch.” They are affecting in “When You’re Home,” which maps out their long-distance relationship, and the Act Two opener “Sunrise.” And Burks robustly leads the group in “When the Sun Goes Down.”\n\nAlysia Velez is a memorable Vanessa, Usnavi’s crush who is striving for a better life and planning to move to Manhattan. She’s an ebullient presence with Usnavi and Sonny in the charming “It Won’t Be Long Now” that addresses aspirations while they go through daily tasks, and has fun in the “Champagne” duet with Usnavi.\n\nMartin Sola and Karmine Alers are strong in portraying Kevin and Camila Rosario, who are Nina’s parents and own the limo service. They both have knockout numbers – he “Inutil(Useless)” and “Atencion,” and she pours out her soul in “Enough” and “Siempre (Always).” The ballads help define the characters’ uncertainty and hopes. The pair were in the Muny’s dazzling “On Your Feet!” in 2021, and Sola, who played Gloria Estefan’s father Jose, originated the role on Broadway.\n\nWhile poignant moments, such as the sad, sentimental “Alabanza (Praise),” and the calamitous “Blackout” that ends first act, bring everyone together, so do the animated dance numbers “The Club” and “Carnaval del Barrio,” and the catchy earworm “96,000.”\n\nSeveral amusing characters each have moments to shine – including the vivacious hairstylists Daniela (Darilyn Castillo) and Carla (Marlene Fernandez), who join Vanessa in “No Mi Diga (You Don’t Say!)” and lead the raucous “Carnaval” number.\n\nMiguel Gil is delightful as Usnavi’s goofy cousin Sonny, so are Eddie Martin Morales as the Piragua Guy and U.J. Mangune as Graffiti Pete.\n\nWilliam Carlos Angulo, serving as director and choreographer, has achieved a laudable synergy, creating a swirling kaleidoscope of movement and rhythm, performed with contagious joie de vivre.\n\nAngulo, who has previously choreographed three Muny shows – the electrifying “On Your Feet!”, “Legally Blonde” and “Little Shop of Horrors,” shows his mettle in managing such a big-deal premiere. He has authentically represented three generations with spry staging and engaging characterizations.\n\nThe high-energy numbers alternate with the more intimate scenes of relationship conflicts and resolutions for people at crossroads, and he finds a suitable balance.\n\nHis collaboration with associate choreographer Shani Talmor, a world-renowned performer and choreographer, is ingenious. Special shout-outs to dance captain Emily Madigan, production stage manager Jhanae K-C Bonnick, and assistant stage managers Hope Michelson, Kentrell Jamison and Alycia Martin for their brisk navigation skills.\n\nThe ensemble kept the tempo lively, bringing the heat and the heart: Marissa Barragán, Angelica Maria Beliard, Ixchel Cuellar, Ralphie Rivera De Jesús, Adriel Flete, Reyna Guerra, Emily Madigan, Sebastian Martinez, Eddie Martin Morales, José J. Muñoz, Matthew Rivera, Kiana Coryn Rodriguez, Francisco Javier Thurston and Alora Tonielle. They were joined by the Muny youth and teen ensembles.\n\nMusic Director Roberto Sinha’s dexterous conducting of the 25-piece orchestra added a brightness to the pulsating score, which is a hybrid of Latin, urban, hip-hop and salsa beats. They elevated the music’s rich texture.\n\nThe Muny’s outdoor setting was ideal for this modern story, with brilliant bursts of fireworks for the July 4th celebration enthralling. The creative team leaned into this new landscape, and Rob Denton’s lighting design, affecting shades of day and night, and Leon Dobkowski’s bright and bold costume design expertly reflected the location’s contemporary outfits. Kelley Jordan’s wig design was unobtrusive. John Shivers and David Patridge’s layered sound design included the cacophony of the urban tableau.\n\nMuch has been said about the themes of community in each of the Muny’s shows this season, and you feel the audience embrace that connection in “In the Heights.” After the isolation of the pandemic, and struggles in a dark time, the urge to find comfort and examples of our humanity is tangible.\n\nWhen I first saw this on its national tour at the Fox Theatre in November 2009, I was struck by its universality, the unique new voice in the creative genius that is Lin-Manuel Miranda, and its ability to create deeper meanings through its emotional connection. I still feel this way, after seeing other regional professional theaters undertake it, and Miranda’s subsequent extraordinary works. It’s been on my list for each Muny season survey for years, and was ecstatic to learn of its inclusion this year.\n\nThe timing is right, the message is clear, and the wave of hope and dreams it inspires makes it a special experience.\n\nTo get that many people in an audience unified is remarkable, and you could feel the uplift in real time during the performance. For 15 years, “In the Heights” has reinforced the enduring theme “There’s no place like home.” And whatever that means individually and collectively vibrantly echoed through Forest Park on Saturday.\n\nThe Muny presents “In the Heights” at 8:15 p.m. nightly, Aug. 9-15, on the outdoor stage in Forest Park. The musical is 2 hours and 23 minutes, with one 15-minute intermission. Tickets are on sale at muny.org, by calling MetroTix at (314) 534-1111 or at the Muny Box Office in Forest Park.\n\nLynn (Zipfel) Venhaus has had a continuous byline in St. Louis metro region publications since 1978.
