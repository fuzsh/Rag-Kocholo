        "text": "-“The Grand Budapest Hotel”\n\nAs someone who started his career as a screenwriter, movies with good visuals are always inspiring learning tools. I tend to write ok, but shoot terribly. Cinematography is my weakest suit in filmmaking, and I long to improve it anyhow . Here is my Top 10 list of movies with outstanding visual endeavor.\n\n10. The Revenant (2015)\n\nIt has probably been the first movie since “The Good, The Bad and The Ugly“, where Extreme Close Ups are the major composition throughout the running time. In this cinematic era where close ups are very selectively used, they dared to go for the opposite. Close Ups & Tracking Shots create claustrophobic feeling despite the spacious locations. I’m even guessing The Revenant might be the beginning of the counter-culture movement. -Is the late 10’s going to be the era of close ups?\n\n9. Birdman (2014)\n\n“Uninterrupted Shot” -enough said for this film. I was between this and “Boogie Nights” that also achieved the same type of shots, but if we are going for the consistency, Birdman would be my prior pick. The camera travels through the auditorium, the backstage, the city, under the bed-sheet and up in the sky. I personally found it fun to point out the moments where they cut and joined the footage in order to make the entire thing look uninterrupted.\n\n8. The Fall (2006)\n\nThe film was shot at 13 World Heritages from 24 countries. The production design makes the most of the cinematographic quality. One might say it’s anti-creativity approach since it’s earned by the location rather than the camera skills. Nevertheless, it’s stunning anyway.\n\n7. A Space Odyssey (1968)\n\nStanley Kubrik at his best. It’s a series of simple static, panning, tilting, dolly shots, and the compositions mesmerize. Despite the weak narrative, you are eventually kept til the end because something is always told by the visual.\n\n6. Samsara (2011)\n\nA great mise-en-scene. Every shot is “interesting” because there is something or someone you can point a camera at in it. As well as around-the-world journal feature, it delivers a certain message.\n\n5. Hero (2002)\n\nAstonishing use of the colours. There is always the key subject with the brightest colour, and the surrounding is decorated by the similar tone. What I like about the action scenes is the limited amount of jump cuts. Wide shots and blocking/choreography predominantly show.\n\n4. The Wizard of Oz (1939)\n\nOrganic, warm cinematography. The yellow-brick-road lead lines, green emerald city and the characters side by side… It’s competent in every aspect -the composition, the colour, the camera movement and the production design.\n\n3. Amelie (2001)\n\nLike the picture above, there are often objects with accentuated colour in the shots. It’s never easy to combine the three primary colours (red, green, blue) because it’s against the nature, but Amelie manages to make the combination of these contrasting colours look naturally gorgeous. Also, the smooth tracking shots are not only beautiful, but also have the beginnings, the middles and the ends story-telling wise.\n\n2. The City of Lost Children (1995)\n\nI haven’t seen any movies that use more Dutch Tilt than “The City of Lost Children”. Many of the scenes are shot by the un-horizontally placed camera, creating dynamic diagonal lines, and they look really interesting. They also know how to light the scenes. There are always dramatic shadows on the key subjects. It’s the kind of cinematography that drags you into the bizarre world.\n\n1. Sangaile (2015)\n\nYou probably don’t know this movie, right? It’s an independent work from Lithuania. It’s unbelievably beautiful. So many things to note, but one of them is that there are depth layers everywhere in the shots -even close ups- they capture the eyes, the nose, the lips and the boobs from smart angles and achieve the three-dimensional look. Just for the sake of cinematography, I recommend you to watch it.\n\nWhen we talk about films, it’s definitely not just Hollywood movies we are talking about. Italian Noir, Soviet Montage, French New Wave, Hong Kong Cinema, Czech New Wave and yet-to-be-named cinema movement that is happening somewhere in the world today… Let’s get exposed to the diverse selection. Here is my list of Top 11 foreign language films of all time. Excuse the odd number but I couldn’t leave one out.\n\n11. “Kolya” -1996 (Czech Republic)\n\nStrange encounter and reluctant interaction. The plot revolves around the solid setting. The language barrier between the characters and the social context make the story extra touching. The cryptic, ambiguous closing shot is my favorite.\n\n10. “Phoenix” -2015 (Germany)\n\nSo close, yet far. It beautifully hurts. The protagonist, Nelly’s every action and reaction to her husband is realistic. The acting strongly convinces the fact she is a woman, a victim and a wife.\n\n9. Persona -1966 (Sweden)\n\nIt’s fairly predictable, but the twist is not the film wants to accentuate the most. It’s a profound presentation of the depth psychology -it’s not just the plot, but also the shot order and repetitive scenes are expert in that field of study.\n\n8. “City of God” -2002 (Brazil)\n\nViolent, yet light hearted tone mesmerizes, utterly. Despite the biographical delivery and journalistic approach to the story, it’s entertaining because of the perfect pacing of the shots and the scenes.\n\n7. “The Mirror” -1975 (Russia)\n\nPotentially one of the most cryptic film in the history. You will have to watch several times or more to fully understand what they truly want to convey. The iconic uninterrupted shot has been the big inspiration for the cinematography in later time.\n\n6. “The Secret Behind Their Eyes” -2002 (Argentina)\n\nGreat use of timeline. We are exposed to the events that are outside the running time one by one as things happen within the running time. Every screenwriter should watch this film.\n\n5. “Au Revoir, Les Enfants” -1987 (France)\n\nThe story couldn’t have been any better if they were not adolescents. It is extra powerful because it happens just before the coming of age.\n\n4. “Seven Samurai” -1954 (Japan)\n\nWhat does it to mean to be righteous? There are countless movies where a hero saves the citizens, but these seven guys are the most empathetic towards to mere individuals. The astonishing compositions of the shots are tremendous cinematographic endeavor.\n\n3. “Tsotsi” -2005 (South Africa)\n\nI like how the baby perfectly functions as “a character” without dialogue or actions. The human-heart that is still left in a cold-blooded criminal is largely influenced after the chance encounter.\n\n2. “The Lives of Others” -2008 (Germany)\n\nThe greatest character arc I’ve ever seen. The two main characters never interact in the movie, -one influenced, one oblivious. The ending is heart-warming.\n\n1. “Dogtooth” -2009 (Greece)\n\nPowerful and unnerving. In the mad world that is unaware of itself, the inevitable human instincts awaken, -“Curiosity” and “Independence”. There are many settings and motives that remain unrevealed, but they are not significant to the central message.\n\nSo, no matter how great the protagonist is, it will be boring if the bad guy standing in his way is not so powerful or “bad” enough. Villains are the enrichment to the conflict and the plot. They provide the heroes tasks to overcome and test their worth. The criteria to make this list are charisma, abilities, motive, authenticity, uniqueness and how evil they are.\n\n10. Norman Bates –“Psycho” (1960)\n\nThis classic villain is utterly horrifying. We authentically fear him because he is perfectly normal looking, and actually has human-like motives behind his psychopathic act. It really feels like he could be anywhere around the corner down your street.\n\n9. Harvey Dent –“The Dark Night” (2008)\n\nHarvey might not be the most evil, powerful, or charismatic of all. It is not his grotesque appearance that deserves a mention, neither. He makes the list because he does a lot to the plot and the story. He symbolizes Batman’s flaws and imperfection since he is the outcome of his failure to rescue Rachael. This good-guy-gone-bad villain makes the hero question himself and creates the inner-conflict.\n\n8. Alex –“A Clockwork Orange” (1971)\n\nAs all his other droogs may agree, this protagonist, and a villain of the masterpiece is not to be forgotten if we are to talk about evils. Alex is an authentic villain of the world we live in. He is the byproduct of the demeaning control the society tries to take over the adolescents. He directly communicates the central message of the film through his character arc.\n\n7. Jack Torrance –“Shining” (1980)\n\nAnother pick from Kubrick’s work. Gradual, convincing progress of turning from a father to a monster is simply unnerving. Alongside Kubrick’s presentation method of dragging us into the story and making us feel being chased, he really is a remarkable villain.\n\n6. John Doe –“Seven” (1995)\n\nWe cannot leave out an intelligent, smart-arse villain on the list. There are a number of them that came across my mind. One of the nominations was Jigsaw from Saw who creates a whole lot of amusement park, but my pick in prior is this devout man who plans the shit out of the crimes. He accomplishes what he believes in his own way. One of the best villain-winning movies.\n\n5. Hannibal Lecter –“The Silence of The Lambs” (1991)\n\nGenerally, we only fear unknown. There is no other movie where we are extremely intimate with the villain from the beginning. The protagonist, Starling fears him from the close range, in the situation where he cannot harm her. There is something unconventionally horrendous about him, yet charming at the same time, helping and celebrating Starling as she achieves her task.\n\n6. Villagers –“Dogville” (2003)\n\nSome villains are the presentation of how a normal citizen could easily turn into an evil, for instance, Harvey as I mentioned earlier. The villagers from Dogville is the most direct approach to this idea. The film discusses the apathy of ethics and it’s sadly convincing.\n\n5. Tommy DeVito –“Good Fellas” (1990)\n\nProbably the most lovable antagonist. He is cruel, unforgiving and heartless, yet witty and charming. He is such a self-driven villain. -He is always up for it, always waiting for someone to say a wrong thing so he can kick off.\n\n4. Captain Vidal –“Pan’s Labyrinth” (2006)\n\nIf we are strictly going for cruelty and cold-blood criteria, Captain Vidal is definitely one of the greatest. Characters like Lil Z from City of God are equally ruthless, but illustrated in the light-hearted tone. The evil Spanish General is excellent at creating tension, constantly threatening the heroine, Ofelia and everyone around him.\n\n3. Penny Wise -“It” (1990)\n\nThis iconic figure is horrifying since he is non-existent. He is deeply psychological. We subconsciously finds him unbeatable and inevitable because he is “a concept”. Penny Wise is something people tend to not overcome. He is a representation of fear.\n\n2. Joker –“Dark Knight” (2008)\n\nHonestly, I haven’t seen any villains that are better than Heath Ledger’s Joker. I hate to have the same opinion as the vast majority, but I just can’t leave him out of the list. Rather than the setting or the written dialogue, the fantastic acting makes the most of this outstanding Joker, starting from the little fidgeting with fingers and the unique voice. He is not the most powerful but he is the maddest.\n\n1. Jareth -“Labyrinth” (1986)\n\nAn honorable mention given the recent heartbreaking news. There will never be any other handsome villain who is good at singing and babysitting. Rest in peace, David Bowie.\n\n-Starling from The Silence of The Lambs. Will she make the list?\n\nWhen we watch a movie, a good protagonist is one of the crucial factors that keeps us till the end and makes us emotionally invest in the story. There are so many criteria I had to take into consideration to make this list: bravery, pro-activity,character arc, physical attraction, hilarity… but these are the protagonists I personally found memorable, charming and engaging.\n\n10. Zen -“Chocolate” (2008)\n\nA young protagonist with a solid motive. But’aye, let’s forget about the narrative side. Her stunt skill is just mind-blowing. The action scenes were entirely shot without wires or CG. The baby-faced Thai heroine deserves a tribute for the physical endeavor.\n\n9. Candy -“Candy” (1968)\n\nWe often like the protagonists because they are competent for fighting for something, or because they still fight despite their incompetence. However, when it comes to Candy, we love her because she doesn’t even think of doing anything. She just gets stripped by everyone and it is simply awesome to watch. My special credits go for the naive objectified heroine.\n\n8. Trump -“City Lights” (1931)\n\nThere are numerous movies that center the underdogs from not-so-blessed backgrounds. Starting with Cinderella or Aladdin who fall in love with someone from difference social class, or the kid from Slumdog Millionaire who rises through the officially-established battles, but on the top of those under-class heros is probably The Trump from City Light. Comically, yet recklessly strove actions are the timeless inspiration.\n\n7. Raphael -“Trash” (2014)\n\nThis brave-hearted adolescent relentlessly fights for the tangible MacGuffin in the story. As well as his audacity for doing anything that takes to reach it, he is also aware of the positive impact it will have on the society after accomplishing the goal. He is also up against an overwhelmingly powerful antagonist -the authority.\n\n6. Susanna –“Girl, Interrupted” (1999)\n\nI haven’t seen any better stories with a learner. She is always changing as the story progresses. She learns something, then unlearns, she learns another something and then unlearns again. It really feels like we are going through a lot with her in the movie. At the end, she also teaches things she learnt to someone who hasn’t.\n\n5. Cooper –“Spy” (2015)\n\nA great approach to Melissa McCarthy’s character. While her foreseen comedic essence from the other films is preciously kept, she is also capable and competent of doing things. Susan Cooper rocks at where she is supposed to, and slips terribly at where we want some larf. She makes the list also because she adds a lot of things to the scenes that the plot or the written dialogue can’t add by itself.\n\n4. Blondie –“The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly” (1966)\n\nNot overly righteous, not particularly ambitious, and not forcefully hero-ised. He doesn’t speak a lot of words but we all want to know where he is heading to. “Blondie” is the way he is addressed but his real name never reveals in the movie. He is the “coolest nobody” you ever see, and being “nobody” is exactly why he is cool.\n\n3. Borat –“Borat” (2008)\n\nAbsolutely phenomenal protagonist of the century. “A journalist from Kazakhstan”, -a rather obscure setting is what drives him as a character. The way he portrays himself is the sarcastically illustrated figure of how the Americans portray strangers. We laugh as the USA lets “Borat” perfectly function as the intended character.\n\n2. Carrie –“Carrie” (1976)\n\nThe protagonist is usually a protagonist because we know how we are supposed to see him or her. -It is not the case with Carrie. She is an innocent young girl who deserves a pity. We emotionally invest in her until the certain scene, -well, we are still kind of on her side when the film is over, but she just doesn’t treat us in the way expected. She leaves you speechless as you don’t know what to feel about her in the end.\n\n1. Lawrence –“Lawrence of Arabia” (1962)\n\nHe is the number one protagonist of all time according to me. There are plenty of movies where a Western protagonist abruptly becomes a hero in the exotic land. “Lawrence of Arabia” is never one of those lame, bias stories. Lawrence is portrayed as a mere human being before being protrayed a hero. He has impact on Arabia, and more importantly, Arabia has impact on him. He has his flaws, gets exposed to his deepest fear, struggles with himself then grows up.\n\nThere you have it. Do you agree with my list.? Have your say if you like."
