        "text": "While the Hannibal television show (2013-2015) was ultimately cancelled, it has since become a major cult classic and has been long recognised by critics as one of the best television shows in recent history. Fans of the show are of the especially passionate variety and if you are among their number and considering a villa in Florence for your next vacation, then you may be interested in learning about the filming locations that were featured in season 3, much of which takes place in the city.\n\nHere is a breakdown of some of the main filming locations in Florence that were used in the show:\n\nPalazzo Medici Riccardi – one of the key spots featured in the show, this impressive palazzo and former home to the famous Medici family is where Hannibal works under an assumed identity. This spot is also where Inspector Pazzi meets his grisly demise before being hung outside a window of the building. When Jack Crawford arrives upon the scene, he and Hannibal fight, with Jack pushing him out the same window. Hannibal hangs onto Pazzi’s body, allowing him to drop to the ground safely below and staggers away before Jack can catch him. The street below the villa is where Jack stands after the fight as the emergency services are at work and meets Will Graham\n\nThe gardens of the property are also where we see the scene in which Hannibal, having taken on the identity of Dr Fell after killing him, is discovered by Antony Dimmond (who will soon after also be killed).\n\nHannibal’s house - Interior scenes of Hannibal and Bedelia living at a palazzo in the city were filmed on a sound stage and so, sadly, cannot be visited. Many of the interior scenes in the show were filmed on sound stages, in general, while the exterior shots were filmed on location in Florence\n\nUffizi Gallery – another important location, the Uffizi is where Botticelli’s Primavera can be found. This is where the young Hannibal came to sketch the work and where Hannibal and Will have an intense conversation before Will is shot by Chiyoh and Hannibal escapes.\n\nVera Dal 1926 – unfortunately does not actually exist but many other historic foodie shops can be found around the city and we highly recommend seeking them out and delving into the truly incredible culinary scene of the city if you have booked a vacation rental in Florence - you can still try and replicate Bedelia's order of, \"due bottiglie di Bâtard-Montrachet e tartufi bianchi, per favore\" (if you have the budget!). We also do see Bedelia walk through the Piazza della Repubblica as well as past the Duomo while she is on her shopping excursions to Vera Dal 1926, both of which are very much real and gorgeous and worth exploring. As the Duomo is one of Florence’s most important and striking landmarks, it will probably already be on your itinerary but it also happens to feature strongly in shots of Florence throughout the show.\n\nPiazza di Santa Maria Novella – This piazza, meanwhile, is one through which we follow Hannibal as he stumbles home after his fight with Jack.\n\nPonte Santa Trinita – Is another spot that Hannibal passes through after his fight and is also where Jack had previously spread the ashes of his deceased wife, Bella.\n\nPiazza di San Lorenzo – another stunning piazza in front of another beautiful church, this is where Pazzi makes a phone call at a public payphone before he is killed.\n\nIf you really want to follow the characters of the show around exactly, there has also been a handy itinerary made by a fan on Google Maps that you can follow here. So, book your holiday rental in Florence today and come walk the same streets as your favourite friendly neighbourhood cannibal."
