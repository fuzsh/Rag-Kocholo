        "text": "Hannibal is a 2001 film, directed by Ridley Scott, adapted from the Thomas Harris novel of the same name. Set ten years after The Silence of the Lambs, we find that one of Hannibal Lecter's surviving victims, the wealthy Mason Verger, is out to torture and kill him. The films begins in Italy and moves to the United States; one of the final scenes shocked audiences and critics alike.\n\nCast\n\nAnthony Hopkins – Hannibal Lecter\n\nJulianne Moore – Clarice Starling\n\nGary Oldman – Mason Verger\n\nRay Liotta – Paul Krendler\n\nFrankie Faison – Barney\n\nGiancarlo Giannini – Pazzi\n\nFrancesca Neri – Allegra Pazzi\n\nZeljko Ivanek – Dr. Cordell Doemling\n\nHazelle Goodman – Evelda Drumgo\n\nDavid Andrews – FBI Agent Pearsall\n\nFrancis Guinan – FBI Director Noonan\n\nJames Opher – DEA Agent Eldridge\n\nEnrico Lo Verso – Gnocco\n\nIvano Marescotti – Carlo\n\nFabrizio Gifuni – Matteo\n\nAlex Corrado – Piero\n\nMarco Greco – Tommaso\n\nRobert Rietty – Sogliato\n\nTerry Serpico – Officer Bolton\n\nBoyd Kestner – Special Agent Burke\n\nPeter Shaw – Special Agent Brigham\n\nKent Linville – FBI Mail Boy\n\nDon McManus – Asst.

One of the people killed by Starling was a female drug dealer, Evelda Drumgo, who is HIV positive and was holding a child at the time she was shot. (Drumgo shoots Starling with a submachine gun; Starling is saved by her bulletproof vest.) Following a hearing on her conduct she is sent to interview Mason Verger, having learned that he has information regarding Hannibal Lecter.\n\nMason Verger--a faceless millionaire mostly confined to a bed-- tells his story – he was under a court order to have therapy sessions with Lecter after being convicted of child sex abuse charges. During a social call, Dr. Lecter suggested that Mr. Verger inhale amyl nitrite fumes (\"poppers\"); once Verger was high, Lecter also suggested that Verger rip his own face off with a glass shard and then hang himself. Verger later recounts that \"it seemed like a good idea at the time\". Lecter fed the remains of Verger's face to Verger's dogs.\n\nMeanwhile in Florence, Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi is investigating the disappearance of a library curator. Here he meets Dr. Fell, the interim curator, whom he discovers is none other than Dr. Lecter. Inspector Pazzi turns this information over to Verger for a reward, who prepares his revenge. After a discussion at the library, Dr. Lecter murders Pazzi by disemboweling and hanging him from the Palazzo Vecchio, a fate that Pazzi's ancestor, Francesco Di Pazzi, suffered 500 years before. Lecter escapes to America.\n\nStarling learns that Justice Department employee Paul Krendler is also working with Verger, using Starling as bait to lure Dr. Lecter out of hiding. Lecter is captured by Verger's henchmen and is taken to a barn, where he is anxiously awaited by several large, man-eating boars. Starling tries to rescue Lecter and is shot by Verger's bodyguards; Lecter, however, has already freed himself of his confines and has been awaiting the last moment to escape. After saving Starling by killing Verger's bodyguards, Lecter convinces Verger's doctor that Verger doesn't deserve to live. Verger's doctor feeds him to the boars, with the assurance that Lecter will take the blame for the crime.\n\nIn the climax of the film, Lecter takes the wounded Starling to a lake-front house and performs surgery on her to remove the bullet. When she awakens, she finds that Lecter has dressed her in a cocktail gown. She comes downstairs, calling the police on the way, and discovers that she's in Paul Krendler's house. Lecter, incensed that Krendler tried to get Starling fired, has kidnapped and lobotomized him. As Starling watches in horror, Lecter removes the top of Krendler's skull and feeds him a small portion of his own brain after it has been sauteéd in butter and herbs.\n\nStarling tries to apprehend Lecter, but is only successful in handcuffing him to herself. Lecter offers Starling the chance to run away with him, asking if there is any possibility that she would ever love him. Starling says no, which is the answer that Lecter had expected. Informing her \"this is really going to hurt,\" he chops off his own hand with a meat cleaver and escapes.\n\nIn the final scene of the film, we see Lecter on a plane full of Asian people, with a small boy asking if he can have a taste of the meal Lecter brought along with him – Krendler's brains. Impressed with the boy's refusal to eat airline food, Lecter happily obliges.\n\nTrivia\n\nFrankie Faison is the only person to appear in all four Hannibal Lecter films, having played Lt. Fisk in Manhunter and Barney, the orderly from Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs. The character Barney has a more significant role in the book than he does in the films.\n\nDue to the length of the novel, a significant portion was left out of the film – In the book, Verger runs an orphanage, from which he culls children to verbally abuse as a substitute for his no longer being able to abuse them sexually. He also has a lesbian sister, Margot, whom he raped when they were children. When she discovered her sexual orientation, their father disowned her. As she herself is sterile due to steroid abuse, Verger exerts some control over her by promising her a sperm sample with which to impregnate her lover, who could then inherit the Verger fortune. At the end of the book, Margot and Starling both help Lecter escape during a shootout between Starling and Verger's guards. Margot, at Lecter's advice, stimulates Mason to ejaculate with a cattle prod, and then kills him by ramming a Moray eel down his throat. Following up on the fate of Krendler in the book, the crooked FBI official experiences a grisly fate when Lecter shoots him with an arrow. The book's now infamous ending has Lecter presenting Starling with the exhumed bones of her father, which he \"brings to life\" by hypnotising Starling, allowing her to say goodbye. This forges an odd alliance between Starling and Lecter, culminating in their becoming lovers and escaping to Argentina. At the end of the novel, Barney (the hospital orderly) sighted Clarice and Hannibal at the Opera house of Buenos Aires. A controversial reaction to the ending led the screenwriters to remove this ending from the film. Another reason was that Jodie Foster refused to appear in the film unless the ending was changed; by the time the re-write was done, she had moved on to another project.\n\nThe scenes set in Starling's apartment were filmed in a house on Grove Ave. in Richmond, Virginia. Also, some scenes were set at Biltmore House.\n\nIn the brain eating scene near the end of the film, the piece of brain Ray Liotta eats is actually a piece of cooked chicken.\n\nThe infamous brain eating scene was shot twice, once using Ray Liotta, and once using an animatronic of Ray Liotta. The best looking segments of both scenes were then edited together. Liotta maintains that, upon seeing the film, he could not tell when he was actually onscreen and when it was the animatronic. Animatronics were also used for the baby that Starling washes after the fish market shootout scene.\n\nWhen Jodie Foster declined to reprise the role of Clarice Starling, Julianne Moore beat Gillian Anderson, Cate Blanchett and Helen Hunt for the role.\n\nAfter Thomas Harris finished writing the novel, he sent copies to The Silence of the Lambs principals Jonathan Demme, Jodie Foster, Ted Tally, and Anthony Hopkins for approval. The screenplay was rewritten no less than 15 times because of dissatisfaction by Demme and Foster over new character elements. In the end, neither Demme nor Foster remained with the production.\n\nMason's mansion is actually the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina.\n\nKrendler's lake house with the boat dock is the same house used in the What About Bob?\n\nRay Liotta actually ate dark chicken meat during the \"brain-eating scene\".\n\nDuring the brain-eating sequence there is a small boar's-head trophy mounted on the wall just above and behind Ray Liotta; another reference to the pig massacre scene.\n\nA special animatronic puppet of Ray Liotta was used for some parts of the brain-eating scene. Liotta himself has said that he's not sure exactly which shots are actually him or the puppet.\n\nThe outdoor opera, Dante's \"La vita nuova\", which Dr. Lecter and Mr. Pazzi see in Florence, was especially composed for the movie. Composer Patrick Cassidy did not stop at the three minute part as performed in the movie, but composed an entire opera.\n\nSome of the places where the movie was filmed include places where filming hardly ever is allowed. Author Thomas Harris, while doing research for his book, got in contact with the heir of the Palazzo Capponi. For the movie this same heir allowed Ridley Scott to film the Capponi Library.\n\nThe first shot of Florence after the movie starts is the same scene as depicted in the drawing on Hannibal's cell wall Hannibal describes to Clarice in The Silence of the Lambs – the Duomo, as seen from the Belvedere, in Florence, Italy.\n\nDr. Lecter's Florentine alias, Dr. Fell, is taken from a rhyming epigram by 17th century English satirist Thomas Brown: \"I do not love thee, Dr. Fell; The reason why I cannot tell. But this alone I know full well: I do not love thee, Dr. Fell.\" The alias is also a reference to the \"Silence of the Lambs\" book where J.Gump, a.k.a. Buffalo Bill, lived in Fell Street.\n\nThe music during the opening credits is \"Aria da Capo\" from Johann Sebastian Bach's Goldberg Variations, a tape of which was playing while Lecter killed the two guards in Tennessee in The Silence of the Lambs .\n\nGiancarlo Giannini (Inspector Pazzi) was in the film Cervellini fritti impanati (1996), which translates as \"Fried Crumbed Brains\".\n\nA poster can be seen near a newsstand for Gladiator, also directed by Ridley Scott.\n\nThere is a vegetarian cookbook on top of the fridge in the \"dinner scene\" toward the end of the movie. It's visible when Hannibal pushes Clarice against the fridge.\n\nIn Florence, where part of the movie was shot, it is possible to buy a sort of tourist guide called: \"Hannibal Lecter. Visit the places of the city where he was.\"\n\nIn the opening credits of the film you can make out the face of Anthony Hopkins being formed by pigeons until the end of the credits when you can clearly see his face.\n\nActualNorth CarolinaState Troopers were used for the filming. They can be seen both in the search of the Verger home and driving their cruisers.\n\nHannibal asks Pazzi about being demoted from the Il Mostro case. Il Mostro was a serial killer about whom Hannibal gives clues to Pazzi. This was a subplot that was filmed but never used as it was thought to be too complicated.\n\nThis film was publicized as having the highest body count in a movie\n\nKeep watching after the credits.\n\nThe film was first rated \"Not under 16\" in Germany. But after some test-screenings, many youth organizations and parents criticized the rating and called for a re-rating. After this re-rating by the FSK (the MPAA in Germany), it now is rated \"Not under 18\". Similarly, in Australia the film originally received an MA15+ classification but it was changed a week after released to R18+ due to protests.\n\nIn the scene in the Italian police station, the soccer match on TV is from England and involves Aston Villa. Their player Julian Joachim is seen in close-up.\n\nAccording to the film's cinematographer John Mathieson, three separate endings were filmed. The filmmakers, unsure as to whether the ending of Thomas Harris' novel would work for the movie, filmed three versions: one for Harris, one for producer Dino De Laurentiis, and one for director Ridley Scott.\n\nHannibal Lecter faces can be seen after the shooting in the fish market, on the close-up of the blood and glass-shards.\n\nThe baby that Clarice Starling washes blood off – just after the shootout sequence – is animatronic.\n\nAfter Jodie Foster and Jonathan Demme dropped out, Anthony Hopkins was very reluctant in returning to play Lecter, and producers considered Tim Roth as a replacement.\n\nMason Verger's mansion is also seen in Ri¢hie Ri¢h as the RichMansion.\n\nThe Verger role was originally offered to Christopher Reeve, who declined the part.\n\nThe dollar serial numbers are the same for at least three bills: G16134024A.\n\nSeveral of the extras in the movie and some minor roles in the Florence scenes were recruited by Anthony Hopkins. He also helped to secure some locales for shooting.\n\nGary Oldman (Mason Verger) originally wanted to share star billing alongside' Anthony Hopkins' and Julianne Moore. When the producers denied him this, he declined to have any billing at all and, in the original theatrical release, remained uncredited at the film's opening and closing credits. In the VHS and DVD releases, however, his name has been added to the closing credits.\n\nDavid Mamet's adaptation of the novel was changed entirely by Steven Zaillian. But Mamet still retained a co-writer credit, in accordance with WGA regulations.\n\nThe 500lb man-eating hogs featured in Hannibal were selected by Ridley Scott from audition of over 6,000 other hogs. They were purchased from a farmer, Chaloem Pasak, who lives north of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.\n\nOriginally, a teaser poster released in the UK had a picture of Lecter with a \"skin mask\" covering the right side of his face, ala the infamous escape scene in The Silence of the Lambs. The poster was quickly pulled from advertisement, as it was seen as being \"too shocking and disturbing\" for the public.\n\nContinuity Error: Hannibal Lecter's left fingers, holding a cigarette, while waiting for Rinaldo Pazzi to leaf through the suitcase inventory.\n\nContinuity Error: When Lecter writes his first letter to Clarice, he licks the envelope to seal it. However, when we see it on her desk before she opens it, the only thing keeping it shut is the seal wax in the centre.\n\nContinuity Error: When Lecter fights with Pazzi they are standing between the projector and the screen, but you can still see the whole slide. It looks as if the projector has been moved out of the way and the shadow we see is cast by another light source.\n\nError: The voiceover \"reading\" Hannibal's letter to Clarice is very different from the written version we see.\n\nContinuity Error: The sky changes from dusk to dark and back again several times while the cars drive to the house.\n\nError: Clarice relinquishes her badge and gun in front of Richmond, Virginia's beautiful skyline (standing in for Washington, D.C.).\n\nContinuity Error: Dr. Lecter signs M.D. very small on the letter, but when Clarice is reading it, M.D. is written very large.\n\nContinuity Error: The right side of the van following Clarice from her house is damaged with a headlight that does not match the undamaged, left side. Later, as the van is seen before crashing into items, the damage is missing and the headlight matches the other side.\n\nContinuity Error: The clock on the wall when Hannibal dines with Paul and Clarice.\n\nError: The typeface on Lecter's copy of the Washington Post is different from what the Post uses for their headlines and text.\n\nContinuity Error: When Lecter closes the fridge door on Agent Starling's hair, a reflection of Agent Krendler is seen briefly where he not only has no tea towel on his head, but also has a complete head.\n\nError: On many of the close-up shots of Mason Verger, the actor's top lip is separated from the top lip of his makeup. This is especially obvious on the low shots looking up at his face.\n\nError: When Hannibal is reading newspaper headlines propped up on his piano, one of them purports to be from Washington, D.C. However, the headline uses the British phrasing, \"Drugs Bust,\" instead of the American \"Drug Bust,\" giving away the true source of the printed prop.\n\nError: On the surround audio track, as heard in cinemas, the drug bust features sounds of gunfire that don't correspond with where the shooters are standing. Also, at least once the camera angle changes and the sound effects remain in the same place.\n\nContinuity Error: The web site Pazzi accesses about Lecter begins with \"In 1992...\" Later shots show the same text beginning with \"In 1990...\"\n\nContinuity Error: When Mason Verger's Italian pig breeders have the swine devour a mannequin, in one shot a pig deforms the mannequin's face with its giant fangs; in the next shot, the mannequin's head is intact and reinflated with no evidence of the prior abuse that should have left it permanently concave.\n\nError: Inspector Pazzi's cellphone is switched off in the library, when Lecter takes it and talks to Clarice. Although it is on vibrate mode, the LCD display is blank.\n\nContinuity Error: When Clarice is handing in her gun and badge, her earrings change from studs to hoops and back again.\n\nError: North CarolinaState Troopers search Mason's mansion. The North Carolina Highway Patrol does not search houses for suspects. The Buncombe County Sheriff's Office would have searched Mason's mansion.\n\nContinuity Error: There are several instances while Starling is listening to the recorded conversations from The Silence of the Lambs where the recordings differ from what was said in the movie. In addition some of the recorded conversations never occurred. Also the conversations were supposedly recorded by the doctor in charge of the institution but the conversation that occurred outside the institution while Hannibal was in the cage is still on tape even though the doctor could not have possibly recorded it since he didn't know it was going to happen and stopped it as soon as he found out.\n\nError: When Clarice is getting interviewed by the board, and Krendler is first introduced, they pan to a shot of the floor and you can clearly see the actor's mark, which a man later steps into.\n\nContinuity Error: When Clarice awakes in Hannibal's custody, a set of car keys is on the table. Clarice drives an early 90s Ford Mustang, Hannibal drives a Ford Econoline, and Krendler drives an Porsche Boxter, but the keys on the table have a General Motors key fob.\n\nError: When Pazzi approaches the library to visit Hannibal and retrieve the suitcases, a group of monks are seen waiting for the camera to reach them in order to start walking down the stairs.\n\nError: When Clarice is talking to Mason at his home, when the camera cuts back to Clarice her mouth is shut, but the voice keeps on talking for about 3 seconds.\n\nContinuity Error: When Francesco is on the pay phone, the same woman walks by twice. It is the woman in the green sweater.\n\nError: When Hannibal gives Dante's Sonett to Allegra Pazzi and says, \"...this might amuse you,\" his mouth doesn't match the words.\n\nContinuity Error: The blood and shattered windshield at the beginning of the film disappear and reappear between shots.\n\nError: When Krendler picks up the faked postcard from Lecter, we can see the handwritten text. The last line reads \"Sounds like him to me.\" This last is clearly a part of the dialogue and was not intended for the text of the postcard.\n\nError: Immediately after Lecter begins to subdue Pazzi, their shadows are shown against the screen upon which Lecter was displaying his slides for his presentation. Since the projector at the back of the room was the source of the image on the screen, their shadows should have hidden the underlying portions of the image but those portions are clearly still visible, probably from a rear-screen projector.\n\nContinuity Error: Mason Verger is referred to by Clarice as Hannibal Lecter's only surviving victim. However, FBI Agent Will Graham was also attacked by Lecter.\n\nError: The phone number of the Geneva lawyer is four digits too short to be a Swiss phone number.\n\nError: The recorded phone number in Geneva begins with \"004123\". This is incorrect, as Geneva's area code is 22, hence the number should begin with \"004122\"\n\nContinuity Error: When Lecter picks up the piece of glass from the broken mirror to give to Verger, he does so with a handkerchief, presumably to avoid leaving fingerprints, but when he hands it to Verger, he does so with a bare hand.\n\nError: When Mason Verger falls into the pit, the pigs do not come to him immediately. In an attempt to draw their attention, the trainers use a clearly visible broom handle, tapping it against the floor in the lower right hand corner of the screen.\n\nContinuity Error: When Clarice meets up with Barney the fan in the window when is on during their conversation. Later during that same conversation Barney walks over to it and it is off. He flips it on.\n\nContinuity Error: At dinner, Clarice grabs the butter knife, but in a later shot when the camera is focused on Hannibal/Paul, she grabs it again before attempting to attack Hannibal as he approaches her with wine.\n\nContinuity Error: During the scene where Pazzi and Benetti are watching the debate, Benetti offers Pazzi a cigarette, Pazzi declines and Benetti starts smoking. In the next shot Pazzi is the one smoking while Benetti has no cigarette.\n\nAfter the credits, we hear Lecter say \"Ta ta, H.\", the closing line of the post-script in his letter to Clarice.\n\nAs the opening credits end, Hannibal's face can be seen in the formation of pigeons on the ground before they fly away.\n\nAfter fading to black, the alternate ending features a new voiceover--\n\nHannibal: Clarice, would you ever say to me, \"Stop. If you really love me you'll stop?\"\n\nClarice: Not in a thousand years.\n\nHannibal: Not in a thousand years? That's my girl.\n\nTrailers feature a scene not in the finished film: Starling exploring the now-abandoned asylum where she first met Dr. Lecter in Silence of the Lambs.\n\nIn the scene where Starling and Lecter are talking near the merry-go-round, Lecter's face is split by a mirror. In the trailer, he says \"You naughty girl\" but this isn't in the final film.\n\nIn the trailer, Lecter says to Clarice \"I need some action, Clarice\" in his letter. This is not in the final film. There are also some shots of lector in the trailer that are not in the movie, most notably, when he mails the letter to clarice. In the trailer, we see him walking away from the mailbox.\n\nA longer 3+ hour cut of the film was purchased by CBS for a network TV run beginning in 2003. Ridley Scott is quoted as having initially cut a 3 hour version of the film that test screened, and that this cut will be made into a two night miniseries for CBS when they screen the film in 2003.\n\nAmong scenes removed from the final cut that may show up in the television version is a time filler in which Lecter picks up Krendler's dog and talks to it while going over flower arrangements for his party.\n\nGerman video distributor BMG Video released two seperate DVD-editions of the film: one is the uncut FSK18 version in a double DVD set with massive extras, the other edition is a single DVD and includes only the film in a shortened (ca. 1,5 min.) FSK16 version. This edition carries the note \"Cut version\".\n\nIn the DVD Behind The Scenes featurette we see Hannibal actually cutting into Krendler's brain during the climactic scene, whereas in the released version only Clarice's reaction is shown.\n\nOver half an hour of footage was deleted from the film, including totally new scenes and alternate versions of scenes already in the movie. These scenes include:\n\nA different version of Clarice watching Brigham's funeral on TV. Here, she doesn't cry, but rather just sits staring at the screen. Another FBI agent comes to visit Clarice with all of Brigham's personal belongings, saying that his parents don't want them, and Clarice asks if she can have them.\n\nA new scene where Starling visits the abandoned asylum where Hannibal Lecter was held. At the door she meets the janitor, a shy young boy who flirts with Starling but refuses to go into the basement because of asthma. Starling goes down into the basement, where she searches old patient files, and finds a vagrant old man huddled in Lecter's old cell screaming for Jesus. Later, we see Starling on Ebay searching for Hannibal Lecter items, among which are X-rays and Lecter's Mercedes.\n\nA new scene where Starling gets a follow up on the X-rays she got from Barney and Mason. An FBI specialist tells her that Mason's X-ray is several years old, and that Barney's X-Ray of Lecter's broken arm is the most recent.\n\nAn alternate version of the scene where Lecter writes a letter to Starling. We see Lecter going to pick up the scent for the envelope, where Pazzi spies on him and, in turn, Lecter spies on Pazzi. The letter itself is worded differently, but still contains the lines about Starling's parents. Here, we learn that Jack Crawford, Starling's old boss from the FBI, died of a disease. Hannibal assures Starling in his letter that he observed a moment-and no more-of silence. We also see Lecter sealing the letter with ink, and dropping the letter off at a mailbox, with Pazzi watching him. The entire scene is accompanied by music composed and played by Anthony Hopkins.\n\nA scene where Pazzi gets FBI passwords from a secret agent holed up in a building in Italy.\n\nAn ignored subplot about Pazzi and a brother-sister gypsy pickpocket team. The sister was a girl named Romula, who Pazzi saw steal a man's wallet. This was the only sequence filmed, which was scrapped in favor of just leaving in the brother as the thug Pazzi sends after Lecter.\n\nAn entire subplot about Pazzi working on Il Mostro, a real unsolved Italian serial killer case in which an unknown man stalked and killed young couples kissing in their cars. It features an alternate version of the scene where Lecter first meets Pazzi--now there is a leering janitor waxing the floor in the next room. Pazzi talks at great lengths with Lecter about Il Mostro, and Lecter gives him information regarding the case, most notably that the killer is posing his victim's corpses like classic paintings. Pazzi follows this lead, which gets him put back on Il Mostro after being removed to investigate Dr. Fell. Later, when he goes to retrieve luggage from Lecter, we have an alternate version of Pazzi in Lecter's living room, with more talk about Il Mostro. All of these sequences feature the janitor from the museum. Finally, we are given an alternate version of Lecter attacking Pazzi. The dialogue is slightly different, and there are several shots of the janitor watching. Here, Pazzi's intestines and bowels don't fall onto the spotlights, and the tourists videotaping the tower laugh instead of scream. Lecter turns around and waves at the tourists, and then walks away. Meanwhile, we see several shots of security looking at Pazzi's body on security cameras as Lecter passes by the Janitor, who had been watching the whole thing from behind it a curtain: He is Il Mostro.\n\nA deleted scene in which Barney drives through Mason's plantation. Originally, the movie was supposed to open with the fish market shootout, and the meeting with Mason was to come later. When the meeting was moved to the opening, the scene was Barney in his car was cut: It features him going past security and men reaping vegatables. The box containing Lecter's restraint mask is visible in several shots on the seat beside Barney. Lastly, Barney comes across the man-eating boars in a pen and drives away from them.\n\nA brief shot of Lecter sleeping on an airplane with his head shaved. He has a nightmare and wakes up almost screaming. This came from the book, in which Lecter had flashbacks to WWII, when his two-year-old sister was killed in a snowbound concentration camp in Austria and eaten for food by starving Nazis.\n\nScenes of Lecter shopping for his party. He goes to a kitchen store, and catches a tabloid show talking about Starling. A humorous bit is included in which Lecter gets angry because the TV commentator addresses him as \"madman Hannibal Lecter,\" and he corrects her by whispering at the TV \"Doctor Lecter!\" A clerk then comes in and directs Lecter to where he can buy steakknives. Lecter then finishes watching the program, where he sees an interview with Krendler.\n\nAn extended version of Clarice in the woods. She runs for a longer period, and shots of her feet on the ground are intercut with Lecter's feet. After the part where the scene would've ended in the final cut, we see Lecter standing by Starling's car on a hilltop. He breaks the lock and gets in, smelling her steering wheel and then running his tongue across it. He gets out, but leaves his sun glasses on the horn.\n\nAn alternate ending: Here, Starling doesn't handcuff Lecter, and he runs his tongue over her lips after they kiss. Starling gets her hair free from the refrigerator, gets her gun, and runs out to the woods after Lecter. She finds the boat drifting and draws her gun on it, but it's empty and she smirks for a moment before she's surrounded by police who have her drop her weapon. A spotlight hits Starling and she yells \"Clarice Starling! FBI!\" The scene then cuts to Starling watching the fireworks over the lake, as in the original. Here, though, instead of cutting to the plane, we see Lecter walking up to a gas station and getting into a van. He waves at some kids and their mothers waving sparklers, and drives off. This goes to a wideshot of the plane cabin, showing most of the passengers and waitresses to be Oriental (implying Lecter is headed to Japan, Korea, China, etc.) The wide shot cuts to the young boy coming out of the bathroom and finding Lecter with his food. They have the same conversation as in the finished version, but only up until the boy asks for food. Here, Lecter asks the boy if his mother ever warned him about taking food from strangers. The boy says she has, but Lecter smiles and says that it doesn't matter since the boy's mother is asleep. Lecter then feeds several forkfulls of the brains to the boy before the screen freezes, with the back of the boy's head superimposed over half of Lecter's face. Commentary by the director says that the scene as it is viewed here was meant to be symbolic, showing Lecter corrupting the boy."
