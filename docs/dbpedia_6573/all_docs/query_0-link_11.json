        "text": "This is the page where I posted my DVD reviews. There will be no further updates to this page after the June 7th reviews. Take a look back through the old ones, and thanks for reading!!\n\n——-\n\n6-9-11\n\n1) True Grit\n\nPlot– A young girl recruits a tough U.S. Marshall to track down the man who killed her father. (imdb.com)\n\nWritten and Directed by– Ethan Coen, Joel Coen (Blood Simple., Crimewave, Raising Arizona, Miller’s Crossing, Barton Fink, The Hudsucker Proxy, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, The Naked Man, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, The Man Who Wasn’t There, Intolerable Cruelty, The Ladykillers, No Country for Old Men, Burn After Reading, A Serious Man)\n\nStarring– Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, Hailee Steinfeld, Josh Brolin, Barry Pepper\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– With the Coen Brothers still soaring above the atmosphere on the wings of their magnificent Oscar-winning film “No Country For Old Men,” it seemed they had reached an entirely different strata in their already genius storytelling, style and presentation. This was the perfect project for them to take on, and generally speaking, any John Wayne movie deserves to be remade with real actors. The Coens had everything at their disposal, and if I was told that they would somehow manage to miss the mark, I would have never believed it. Even though critics and the Academy decided to shower this film with praise, it turned out to be highly disappointing. The film began with a barrage of religious messages and symbolism that were much too simple and obvious for the story. The Coens have made a habit of brilliantly using music to enhance the already thick moods in their films (“No Country for Old Men” had no music), but this film’s soundtrack was quite poor. Flowery, overly chipper and badly placed, the music was a constant reminder of how off the mark the Coen Brothers’ direction was. One of the Coens’ strongest directorial abilities comes from their ability to direct complex and heavily emotional sequences with stark simplicity that cuts to the core of the human condition. Their direction in this film felt empty and overly plain, reminiscent of a talented actor phoning in a romantic comedy performance they accepted for yacht money. While the screenplay was not as disappointing as their direction, it suffered from inconsistencies and other problems. The Coens have always had great success writing dialogue, and this film featured great conversations between characters that helped establish stretches of wit, intelligence and biting sarcasm that brought the characters to life. In the film’s final third however, the Coens attempted to force inspirational and motivational themes on the audience, which is something Clint “The Overrated One” Eastwood constantly does. By far this inconsistent film’s strongest feature was acting. Jeff Bridges was excellent in his tough as nails character. His menacing stare and forceful screen presence was outstanding, though it would have been even more powerful if the Coens had directed the film consistently. Matt Damon was also excellent in his quasi-polished and sarcastic supporting role which served as a nice compliment to Bridges’ raw performance. Surprisingly, the best performance of this film came from Hailee Steinfeld, whose remarkable co-starring showing stole the spotlight from Bidges and Damon. Her presence, delivery and personality were absolutely remarkable, and the unwavering command and dedication she displayed were the film’s most powerful qualities. This film was a highly disappointing work from a cast and crew with so much talent, but Steinfeld’s memorable performance was a must-see in a film that failed to do much else.\n\n2) Just Go with It\n\nPlot– A guy convinces a mother of two to pose as his soon-to-be-divorced wife in order to woo the woman of his dreams. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Dennis Dugan (Problem Child, Brain Donors, Happy Gilmore, Beverly Hills Ninja, Big Daddy, Saving Silverman, National Security, The Benchwarmers, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, You Don’t Mess with the Zohan, Grown Ups)\n\nWritten by– Allan Loeb (Things We Lost in the Fire, 21, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, The Switch, The Dilemma), Timothy Dowling (Role Models)\n\nStarring– Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston, Brooklyn Decker, Nick Swardson, Nicole Kidman, Bailee Madison, Rachel Specter\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– With Dennis Dugan and Adam Sandler at the helm, this project had every reason to be a complete failure. To my complete surprise, it actually turned out to be a legitimately funny movie. The film gained considerable strength from its dialogue, which was driven by wit and sarcasm, yet it carried an entirely natural feel. At times Sandler’s humor felt a tad childish (isn’t it always?) but it was never forced, delivered laughs, and the frequent feel of improvisation added personality. I also found good chemistry with the supporting players, as Jennifer Aniston and Nick Swardson were quite good in their roles. I was shocked to see Nicole Kidman’s name on the cast list, but even though this project is entirely atypical of her resume and talents, she did a fine job with a highly predictable character. Brooklyn Decker was simply hired to be a beautiful woman, and given that she has no real acting experience, her performance could have been a lot worse. Her character, however, was completely unbelievable. The film had plenty of legitimately funny scenes and ideas at its disposal, but for some reason, Dugan and co-writers Allan Loeb and Timothy Dowling simply gave up with 30 minutes of screentime left. The final half hour became a cheesy and conventional Hollywood romantic comedy filled with clichés and a couple of regrettable plot choices. Still, the overall result was quite surprising indeed. The film wasn’t Shakespeare, but it delivered plenty of comedy in a relaxed and enjoyable way, and made great use of the personalities and creativity of the cast. I’d give this one a try- you could do a whole lot worse.\n\n3) Sanctum\n\nPlot– A diving team experiences a life-threatening crisis during an expedition to an unexplored cave system. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Alister Grierson (Kokoda)\n\nWritten by– John Garvin, Andrew Wight\n\nStarring– Rhys Wakefield, Allison Cratchley, Christopher Baker, Ioan Gruffudd, Richard Roxburgh, Alice Parkinson, Dan Wyllie\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– Though this film excelled in technical areas, its writing, acting, score and attitude were entirely second-rate. With James Cameron producing you knew that Hollywood themes and clichés would be in full effect, and they definitely were. This should have been a gritty suspense movie, but no doubt Cameron’s influence turned it into a heavily clichéd and mostly forgettable movie. Hollywood corniness could be felt right away as John Garvin and Andrew Wight’s screenplay created tired and predictable character dynamics. True to Hollywood blockbuster form, the film contained far too much music, and David Hirschfelder’s score was quite exaggerated and poor overall. The film’s main success was its underwater photography, which was a fantastic technical achievement. Alister Grierson was able to use the film’s 3D theatrical presentation very well, and his camerawork was quite solid overall. The use of lighting and sound were excellent also, which was a good thing because this movie’s technical excellence was the only thing that made it remotely watchable. Acting was extremely poor to say the least. Rhys Wakefield, Ioan Gruffudd and Richard Roxburgh were the film’s main performers, and they overplayed their parts to a severe and cringe-worthy degree. Hirschfelder’s terrible score found creative ways to loudly celebrate their worst on-screen moments. The screenplay was quite predictable, throwing around with regularity lazy disaster movie clichés and elementary character development. Even so, the film was able to achieve suspense in many of the right places as its technical achievements saved it from total failure. I’m not sure this film really works without its 3D theatrical presentation, and overall it’s not something I would recommend watching unless you could do so for free. Nevertheless it is a prime example of how standard Hollywood conventions (and horrendous acting) can spoil a perfectly good setting and direction.\n\n——-\n\n6-2-11\n\n1) Drive Angry 3D\n\nPlot– A felon breaks out of hell for one last chance at redemption: to prevent the cult who murdered his daughter from sacrificing her baby in three days’ time. He’s aided by a young waitress (Heard) and her ex-boyfriend’s muscle car, and together the duo will have to face down the leader of the cult, the police, and a killer known as “The Accountant” — who wants to return him to the Devil. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Patrick Lussier (Dracula 2000, White Noise 2: The Light, My Bloody Valentine 3D)\n\nWritten by– Todd Farmer (Jason X, The Messengers, My Bloody Valentine 3D), Patrick Lussier\n\nStarring– Nicolas Cage, Amber Heard, William Fichtner, Katy Mixon, Billy Burke, David Morse, Christina Campbell, Pruitt Taylor Vince\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– This movie was indeed every bit as stupid as its premise and title would suggest. One of the worst movies of 2011 in many categories, this trashy and idiotic project was firing on all cylinders. Patrick Lussier wasted no time embracing the high level of stupidity of the writing and characters, and carried this through from beginning to end. Lussier was clearly attempting to make a slick, cool, stylish and funny action movie. His goal appeared to be some kind of mix between the uniquely exaggerated feel of “Sin City,” and the action-comedy content of “Mr. & Mrs. Smith,” but Lussier doesn’t have 5% of the skill or vision to pull that off. The result was a movie that was as idiotic as they come, filled with pointless sex scenes, badly constructed action sequences with possibly the worst gunfights ever conceived, and even failed 3D gimmicks for its theatrical presentation. What is there to say about Nicolas Cage? The man has Oscar caliber skill when he elects to use it, but he makes so many terrible decisions that it gets harder and harder to defend him. As anyone could have predicted, his performance in this movie was horrendous. He played his laughably stupid character with a fake layer of Lussier’s attempted coolness and overwhelming corniness to such a degree that it almost seemed as though he was trying to give the worst performance of his career. There is nothing left to say about this ultra-trashy movie other than to avoid it at all costs!\n\n——-\n\n5-26-11\n\n1) I Am Number Four\n\nPlot– Nine alien teens come to Earth after their planet is destroyed by an enemy species. But soon discover that their enemy is now after them on Earth. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– D.J. Caruso (The Salton Sea, Taking Lives, Two for the Money, Disturbia)\n\nWritten by– Alfred Gough (Double Tap, Made Men, Shanghai Noon, Showtime, Shanghai Knights, Spider-Man 2, Herbie Fully Loaded, The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor), Miles Millar (Double Tap, Made Men, Shanghai Noon, Showtime, Shanghai Knights, Spider-Man 2, Herbie Fully Loaded, The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor), Marti Noxon (Just a Little Harmless Sex)\n\nStarring– Alex Pettyfer, Timothy Olyphant, Dianna Agron, Dianna Agron, Kevin Durand, Callan McAuliffe, Jake Abel\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– This is an example of a movie that could have been decent, but its teen Hollywood corniness ruined any chance for success. Alex Pettyfer led the way with a dull and uninspired leading performance that contributed nothing good to the overall outcome of the movie. I felt sorry for Timothy Olyphant, who was the only legitimate actor in the movie and clearly has more talent than the entire cast combined. His performance was the only consistently positive aspect of the movie, which was filled with either transparent and week teen actors, or exaggerated and terribly overacted bad guy characters led by Kevin Durand. Alfred Gough, Miles Millar and Marti Noxon don’t have any good films in their resumes, and this screenplay is a great reason why. Filled with corny and completely unnecessary high school characters, a cheesy romantic subplot, exaggerated villains and periods of slowness, it was easy to see why there was very little substance to this movie. D.J. Caruso’s direction was quite poor as well. Caruso began the film with a good pace, but ruined it early with MTV-style direction that placed pop music over every cutscene in the first third of the movie. Caruso was unable to keep the film at a consistent pace, constantly allowing it to either slow to a crawl or grow extremely corny with highly exaggerated and overdone action sequences. Overall, this was an amateurish attempt by Hollywood to extract money from a teen demographic, and it didn’t do that very well either.\n\n2) Gnomeo and Juliet\n\nPlot– An animated version of Romeo and Juliet. With gnomes.\n\nWritten and Directed by– Kelly Asbury (Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, Shrek 2)\n\nVoices of– James McAvoy, Emily Blunt, Maggie Smith, Jason Statham, Michael Caine, Patrick Stewart, Julie Walters, Matt Lucas, Jim Cummings, Stephen Merchant, Ashley Jensen, Hulk Hogan, Dolly Parton, Ozzy Osbourne\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– Quite obviously this was a bad idea, but the result was actually a lot more well-meaning than one might expect. If this movie looked corny to anyone, that’s because it was. Almost all aspects of Kelly Asbury’s writing and direction were extremely corny and overdone, as the film was filled with lots of commotion and standard kid’s movie antics. However there was quite a bit of creativity here as well, after all it’s not as though you can sarcastically say, “Great, another gnome movie…” Asbury’s writing was exaggerated as one would expect, but it was also quite clever, combining a decent wit with slightly less watered down Romeo and Juliet references than other kid’s movies. The film benefited from outstanding 3D CGI which was used as creatively and inventively as any Pixar production. Vocal performances were also pretty solid overall, with James McAvoy and Emily Blunt delivering great results from their title roles. The majority of the supporting performances were strong enough to help the film along as well. Though this isn’t a movie I’d recommend to anyone just for the hell of it, if you’re an adult who wants something G-rated to watch with your kids, I promise you won’t be bored.\n\n——-\n\n5-19-11\n\n1) The Mechanic\n\nPlot– An elite assassin takes on an apprentice who has a connection to one of his earlier targets. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Simon West (Con Air, The General’s Daughter, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, When a Stranger Calls)\n\nWritten by– Richard Wenk (Vamp, Just the Ticket, 16 Blocks), Lewis John Carlino (Seconds, The Fox, The Brotherhood, The Mechanic, A Reflection of Fear, Crazy Joe, The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea, I Never Promised You a Rose Garden, The Great Santini, Resurrection, Haunted Summer)\n\nStarring– Jason Statham, Ben Foster, Donald Sutherland, Tony Goldwyn\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– The truth is, there wasn’t much of a reason to have any optimism going into this movie. After all, Jason Statham has taken a once promising career and ruined it with one cheesy action performance after another; why would this film be any different? Statham’s character was a total cliché, and he definitely overplayed the “strong and silent” dynamic. The film had its share of Hollywood action clichés as well, and director Simon West made no effort to camouflage them. What surprised me most was how well the film ended up working. Ben Foster, a vessel of pure energy and raw intensity, delivered a strong performance. He played well off of Statham and wound up generating a character dynamic that was worth watching. Though West’s direction was far from perfect, he created a nicely stylized atmosphere which made the film feel more intense at times than one would expect. Richard Wenk and Lewis John Carlino didn’t have to work very hard on the screenplay. Not only is it a remake of Carlino’s 1972 film (starring Charles Bronson and his mustache), but there wasn’t much of a plot to begin with. Though predictable at every turn, West’s action sequences were very well choreographed and the movie wasted no time with superfluous scenes or unnecessary dialogue. Its blunt, straightforward style made this movie, which appeared to have no potential for success, into a highly watchable guilty pleasure that accomplished everything it set out to do. Give this one a try and you’ll probably enjoy it.\n\n2) The Rite\n\nPlot– A thriller centered on a disillusioned American seminary student who attends exorcism school at the Vatican, and his encounter with demonic forces. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Mikael Håfström (Derailed, 1408)\n\nWritten by– Michael Petroni (The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys, Queen of the Damned, Till Human Voices Wake Us, Boys Own Story, Possession, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader)\n\nStarring– Colin O’Donoghue, Anthony Hopkins, Ciarán Hinds, Alice Braga, Rutger Hauer, Toby Jones\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– Every positive quality that this movie contains can be countered with a negative one, making the film cancel itself out in the end. Colin O’Donoghue is an unassuming actor well suited for the lead of this film. His demeanor and presence felt natural and low key for the horror genre which was a fine casting decision. All eyes are on Anthony Hopkins of course, and he did not disappoint. Hopkins gave a forceful, lightning quick and chilling performance which grew more and more intense as the film developed. Mikael Håfström has done good work in the past, and his direction of this film had good ideas, but carried plenty of problems too. Håfström, and the film as a whole, benefited tremendously from filming on location in Rome and Budapest. The atmosphere was one of old fashioned authenticity with creepy castles, old villages and a generally antique feel. Håfström was able to create intensity at times, and built the film to get darker as it went along, however he and writer Michael Petroni wasted too much time. The film’s romantic subplot was useless and should have been removed entirely. Though he included some good surreal imagery, Håfström’s direction turned lackadaisical in places, never allowing for a consistent pace. Petroni’s screenplay was in need of tightening through much of the film, and he followed a conventional and predictable story structure. In actuality this could have been a legitimately good movie if it had been thought through properly, but the end result was entirely average.\n\n3) The Roommate\n\nPlot– College student Sara finds her safety jeopardized after she’s assigned to a dorm room with a new roommate, Rebecca, who becomes increasingly obsessed with her. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Christian E. Christiansen\n\nWritten by– Sonny Mallhi\n\nStarring– Minka Kelly, Leighton Meester, Cam Gigandet, Alyson Michalka, Matt Lanter, Billy Zane\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– I will begin by saying how much I like this plot. After all, a psychotic, stalker roommate is something that does happen, and that realism makes any story better. However that is the extent of the good things I can say about this alleged movie, which turned a great plot into one of the year’s worst and most idiotic exercises in futility. The film began with typical college party clichés and went downhill from there. Minka Kelly will be 31 years old on June 24th. How she came to play an 18-year-old college freshman is beyond me, but the obvious age gap made her look ridiculous in the part. Her transparent, overly fluffy performance did not help either. Leighton Meester at least looked the part, but Sonny Mallhi’s horrendous excuse for a screenplay made her character totally absurd. Mallhi filled the movie with exaggerated superficial teen characters who were as empty as Christian E. Christiansen’s direction. Even though the plot had potential, Mallhi and Christiansen never created a single scene worth watching. This was a highly dull, predictable and ridiculous movie for a variety of reasons, such as Meester’s character being a psychotic stalker for no apparent reason. The film was quite dull and highly predictable as Christiansen’s clunky camerawork sloppily captured idiotic characters, terrible performances, a laughable climax and an awkward age disparity with the lead actress. Avoid this trash at all costs!\n\n——-\n\n5-12-11\n\n1) No Strings Attached\n\nPlot– A comedy centered on casual friends Adam and Emma as they try to keep their relationship strictly physical. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Ivan Reitman (Stripes, Ghost Busters, Twins, Ghostbusters II, Kindergarten Cop, Dave, Junior, Fathers’ Day, Six Days Seven Nights, Evolution, My Super Ex-Girlfriend)\n\nWritten by– Elizabeth Meriwether\n\nStarring– Natalie Portman, Ashton Kutcher, Kevin Kline, Cary Elwes, Greta Gerwig, Lake Bell, Olivia Thirlby, Ludacris\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– In the end this was a formulaic romantic comedy that could easily pass as a guilty pleasure. Elizabeth Meriwether’s screenplay was the film’s strongest feature. She wrote dialogue very well and created cleverness, humor and sarcastic wit throughout most of the movie. Though much of her structure was standard for the genre, her blunt and often no-frills conversations made the film feel very realistic. Natalie Portman clearly has far more talent than this film required, but her performance was enthusiastic, filled with personality and carried a level of offbeat cleverness we haven’t seen from her in a while. Unfortunately, Ashton Kutcher underperformed yet again in his role, never capitalizing on the countless chances he was given by Meriwether and Portman to develop his character. Kevin Kline offered a colorful supporting performance which helped to offset Kutcher to some degree. Until the final third, the film was moving along quite nicely. It was a likable movie that carried mature humor farther than most comedies, and featured believable characters as well. I’ve never been a fan of Ivan Reitman’s direction, and the corniness and predictability of the film’s Hollywood ending definitely had his name on it. Despite its predictability, this was an enjoyable and legitimately funny movie that probably deserves a bit more credit than the average fare.\n\n——-\n\n5-5-11\n\n1) The Green Hornet\n\nPlot– A newspaper publisher by day and masked crime fighter by night, The Green Hornet and his martial arts expert sidekick, Kato, fight crime while trying to keep their true identities a secret. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Michel Gondry (Human Nature, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Science of Sleep, Be Kind Rewind)\n\nWritten by– Seth Rogen (Superbad, Drillbit Taylor, Pineapple Express), Evan Goldberg (Superbad, Pineapple Express)\n\nStarring– Seth Rogen, Jay Chou, Christoph Waltz, Cameron Diaz, Tom Wilkinson, David Harbour, Edward Furlong\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– Perhaps the most curious storyline of this film was Michele Gondry as director. Gondry is a visual genius and his unique ability to capture bizarre, imaginative exchanges between odd characters makes him a one-of-a-kind filmmaker. His participation in this film was perhaps the strangest choice of his career, and sadly there wasn’t a moment in the movie in which any of Gondry’s talents were present. The film got off to a rough start which was glazed in Hollywood corniness and action movie clichés. After 15 minutes or so the film settled down, shifting into a more clever, offbeat comedy emphasizing the fantastic chemistry between Seth Rogen and Jay Chou. Rogen and Chou fit their parts well, and provided enjoyable and suitably clever performances. Rogen played a lazy and spoiled rich kid very well and created plenty of conversationally based humor with his attitude and speech pattern. Chou’s facial expressions and timing were razor-sharp, and he played nicely with Rogan’s personality. Cameron Diaz provided a surprisingly quick and witty supporting role, while Christophe Waltz did well with his bad guy role, adding slightly more personality than roles of this type usually carry. While Rogen and Evan Goldberg’s screenplay did contain some clever comedy and well written characters, the plot was highly predictable. The film featured quite a few over the top action sequences, especially near the end, and felt corny at times. Despite some inconsistencies and the film’s Hollywood corniness, this was an enjoyable guilty pleasure summer action movie that provided plenty of entertainment.\n\n2) The Dilemma\n\nPlot– A comedy centered on a guy who struggles with whether or not to tell his best friend that his wife is having an affair. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Ron Howard (Angels & Demons, Frost/Nixon, The Da Vinci Code, Cinderella Man, The Missing, A Beautiful Mind, How the Grinch Stole Christmas, Edtv, Ransom, Apollo 13, The Paper, Far and Away, Backdraft, Parenthood, Willow, Gung Ho, Cocoon, Splash, Night Shift, Grand Theft Auto)\n\nWritten by– Allan Loeb (Things We Lost in the Fire, 21, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, The Switch)\n\nStarring– Vince Vaughn, Kevin James, Winona Ryder, Jennifer Connelly, Channing Tatum, Queen Latifah, Amy Morton\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– Ron Howard’s directorial resume contains many notable films, but he has demonstrated a consistent inability to succeed in the comedy genre. With this film Howard had every possible opportunity to direct a truly outstanding comedy, but despite so many good qualities the film still found a way to end up in mediocrity. Vince Vaughn and Kevin James had great chemistry in a very well cast film. The emphasis of the screenplay was dialogue, and James and Vaughn delivered plenty of laughs in quick exchanges. Allan Loeb and Howard established well-written characters who were intelligently created and multidimensional. The plot was interesting and the screenplay was a fine blend of humor and mature realism. Unfortunately the second half of the film lagged considerably, slowing the pace to a crawl, eliminating all comedy and actually turning somewhat corny near the end. With the screenplay unable to finish what it started, the performances impressively found ways to remain the film’s best feature. Along with strong showings from James and Vaughn, Wynona Rider, Jennifer Connelly and others turned in convincing and well developed supporting roles. It was obvious that Howard was aiming for a mature and realistic comedy about friendship and romantic relationships. He was able to achieve this, but he lost sight of the film’s pace in the second half and screenplay inconsistencies prevented the movie from reaching its full potential.\n\n——-\n\n4-28-11\n\nNo DVDs released this week, unless you count Season 14 of South Park…\n\n——-\n\n4-22-11\n\n1) The King’s Speech\n\nPlot– A chronicle of King George VI’s effort to overcome his nervous stammer with the assistance of speech therapist Lionel Logue. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Tom Hooper (Red Dust, The Damned United)\n\nWritten by– David Seidler (Tucker: The Man and His Dream, Time to Say Goodbye?, Quest for Camelot, The King and I)\n\nStarring– Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter, Guy Pearce, Michael Gambon, Geoffrey Rush, Timothy Spall, Jennifer Ehle\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– This was an excellent film which left nothing to be desired. In fact it was 2010’s sixth best movie, which is not too shabby. Goaded on by critics and lavished with awards, it was not the most deserving nominee in any of the major categories which it won. Now the film carries the unfortunate stigma of becoming yet another heavily over-awarded Oscar winner. Despite this fact, the film was, as I said, very well done indeed. As you’d expect from a film depicting the British upper class, the performances were highly delicate and nuanced. Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush were fantastic in roles that required considerable skill, instinct and intelligence. Firth’s performance was closed off and inaccessible, yet also highly vulnerable and surprising, fitted with layer upon layer of psychology to dissect. Rush displayed charisma and wit, and delivered an increased energy level that kept Firth on his toes. Tom Hooper’s direction was elegant yet distinctly modern, as he seemed to abandon the forced opulence with which British royalty has been portrayed in similar projects. Though he didn’t do anything else particularly noteworthy with his direction, he crafted the film with a highly accessible feel that paved the way for David Seidler’s screenplay to take over. By far the writing was the film’s most impressive attribute. Though the plot may not seem terribly compelling, the dynamic between the characters was written quite well, and Firth and Rush were fascinating to watch together. Seidler sifted through numerous levels of psychological issues, including them in a highly clever screenplay filled with wit, charm, intelligence, richly constructed dialogue and forcefully compelling characters that never stopped evolving. Overall this film was genuinely compelling and quite well-made from start to finish. It succeeded on the strength of Seidler’s masterful screenplay and perfectly constructed performances, and is indeed a must-see.\n\n2) The Way Back\n\nPlot– A young military officer leads an escape from a hellish gulag in Soviet-occupied Poland during WWII. Making a pact with six companions, the group embarks on a daring mission across Asia to hopeful safety in India. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Peter Weir (Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, The Truman Show, Fearless, Green Card, Dead Poets Society, The Mosquito Coast, Witness, The Year of Living Dangerously, Gallipoli, The Last Wave, Picnic at Hanging Rock, The Cars That Eat People)\n\nWritten by– Keith R. Clarke, Peter Weir (Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, Green Card, The Year of Living Dangerously, Gallipoli, The Last Wave, The Cars That Eat People)\n\nStarring– Jim Sturgess, Ed Harris, Colin Farrell, Saoirse Ronan, Mark Strong\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– Peter Weir has shown flashes of brilliance in a long and inconsistent career. Despite plenty of opportunities the Australian filmmaker could not find a way to make this into a complete film. Often times it isn’t how you start, but how you finish. Some films can overcome a slow or lackluster start and still achieve success with a strong second half, but as Weir found out with this movie, it’s much harder to overcome the opposite. The first half of the film was brilliantly crafted as Weir placed the audience in the harshest of environments. His direction made it possible to feel the elements attacking the characters, weaving a forceful, brutish narrative between intense and very well acted performances. Perhaps most impressive was Weir’s ability to interact with the film’s sweeping cinematography, creating a strange sense of beauty in a barren, lifeless wilderness filled with danger at every turn. The story wasted no time, focusing solely on the characters as they tried to battle the elements and keep their sanity. Jim Sturgess and Ed Harris gave strong, dedicated performances and carried the film nicely. The best showing however came from Colin Farrell, whose intensity and unpredictability would have improved the outcome of the film greatly had he been given more screentime. Sadly, Saoirse Ronan was severely underused and under-directed by Weir, thus she contributed very little to the film. At the halfway point the film hit a wall and was never able to climb over. Weir’s direction lost its bite and symbolism, and the screenplay lost its motivation to become frustratingly redundant. Weir and Keith R. Clarke apparently felt no need to develop the characters for the duration of the film, and despite its potential for emotional resonance, the second half of the film was bland, uninteresting and contained almost no forward momentum. The film grew less and less interesting with each scene, and Weir seemed as lost as the characters he was filming. Despite a strong cast and enormous potential, this movie was ultimately very disappointing.\n\n3) Gulliver’s Travels\n\nPlot– Shipwrecked slacker Lemuel Gulliver finds himself transported to an island in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle, where he’s a giant among the natives, the Lilliputians. Initially taken prisoner, Gulliver becomes a favorite of the court and schemes for a way in which the Lilliputians can outwit their rivals, the Blefuscudians. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Rob Letterman (Shark Tale, Monsters vs Aliens)\n\nWritten by– Joe Stillman (Shrek, Shrek 2, Planet 51), Nicholas Stoller (Writer of: Fun with Dick and Jane, Yes Man, Get Him to the Greek; Director of: Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Get Him to the Greek)\n\nStarring– Jack Black, Emily Blunt, Jason Segel, Amanda Peet, T.J. Miller, Romany Malco, Billy Connolly\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– There have been many adaptations of Jonathan Swift’s famous novel, and none of them have been particularly good. This movie didn’t have any real potential for success, and seconds into the opening credits it was clear what kind of poorly conceived Hollywood ride we were in for. Rob Letterman’s ultra corny presentation featured atrocious music and a forced Hollywood feel that was only outdone by the film’s ridiculous romantic subplot. The most curious contributor to this film was Nicholas Stoller, whose has shown consistent ability to be a smart and clever writer of well-rounded comedies. There was no sign of his intelligence in this most regrettable of movie choices, and let’s hope his involvement in this mess was a contractual obligation and not a delusion. Letterman’s direction was extremely forced and made the film very difficult to sit through, but the acting wasn’t much better. Jack Black has shown talent in some of his more serious films, but in this movie he clearly didn’t put forth a second of effort and showed no acting ability whatsoever. Jason Segel was the only one who gave a halfway decent showing, but his attempt at a British accent kept drifting in and out. Frankly I was just happy to see someone present the slightest amount of effort. This was a terrible kid’s action movie that displayed extreme levels of cheesiness, phoned in performances and a complete lack of any positive qualities – avoid at all costs!\n\n——-\n\n4-14-11\n\n1) Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I\n\nPlot– Harry, Hermione, and Ron set out from Hogwarts to find and destroy the Horcruxes — the secret to Voldemort’s power and immortality. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– David Yates (The Tichborne Claimant, The Girl in the Café, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince)\n\nWritten by– Steve Kloves (Racing with the Moon, The Fabulous Baker Boys, Flesh and Bone, Wonder Boys, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince)\n\nStarring– Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Ralph Fiennes, Bill Nighy, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman, Jason Isaacs, Bonnie Wright, Tom Felton, Maggie Smith, Rhys Ifans, Michael Gambon, Clémence Poésy, John Hurt, Miranda Richardson, Brendan Gleeson, Ciarán Hinds, David Thewlis, Robbie Coltrane, Warwick Davis, Timothy Spall, Jim Broadbent, Rade Serbedzija, Julie Walters, Imelda Staunton, David O’Hara\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– There hasn’t been anything resembling a plot or overarching purpose for this never-ending series since 2007, and dividing J.K. Rowling’s allegedly final Harry Potter book into two parts only accentuates this fact. At least this movie had roughly 45 minutes of plot, which is more than the last two films combined! It seems the overwhelming corniness that filled the early films is gone, and has been replaced with a darker atmosphere intended to create a mysterious and ominous aura. Unfortunately a total lack of storytelling ability, combined with an obvious effort to filibuster this series for more money made this movie as irrelevant as the previous three films, and as forgettable as the entire franchise. Steve Kloves and David Yates, whose names are quite familiar in this franchise by now, took the longest possible route to the most obvious and simple conclusion. The writing and direction wasted extreme amounts of time, leaving 65% of the film with no story or purpose to be found. Yates’ direction was visually strong, and if the film had a plot that carried beyond the first 45 minutes, his dark environment and well-formed effects would have been highly effective. Performances were less then great. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have always been the backbone of the series from an acting standpoint because supporting performances have been so consistently atrocious, but they have clearly outgrown these movies. The general boredom they showed in their bland and uninteresting performances was related to the lack of story, but also perhaps a reflection of the repetitive and aimless nature of the last few films. Thankfully the terrible performances of Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter and others had limited screentime in this offering. Despite consistently good visuals the film wasted far too much time and never felt like it was going anywhere. At this rate they’ll take Part 2 and break it into two parts, then each part will be divided into two more parts and so on, so that this cash cow can never be put out to pasture.\n\n2) Country Strong\n\nPlot– A drama centered on a rising country-music songwriter who sparks with a fallen star. Together, they mount his ascent and her comeback, which leads to romantic complications involving her husband/manager and a beauty queen-turned-singer. (imdb.com)\n\nWritten and Directed by– Shana Feste (The Greatest)\n\nStarring– Garrett Hedlund, Gwyneth Paltrow, Leighton Meester, Tim McGraw\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– This movie was obviously made in an effort to capitalize on any potential leftover popularity and critical good will from Jeff Bridges’ Oscar-winning film “Crazy Heart.” The result was probably not what the cast and crew expected. The problem with this film wasn’t a lack of sincerity. Shana Feste wrote and directed the film with emotion and created believable and dynamic characters. The trouble was, Feste failed to deviate from the standard music movie formula, leaving very little that hasn’t been done countless times before. Despite its tired and mostly predictable nature, excellent performances drove the first half of the film to success. Garrett Hedlund was outstanding, stealing the show from Gwyneth Paltrow, who most likely thought she would receive an Oscar nomination. Hedlund’s strength, resilience and natural screen presence took a very predictable and tired character to the next level, and his chemistry with Paltrow was strong as well. Paltrow’s performance shouldn’t be overlooked either, as her obvious dedication to her character and the film resulted in a very real, moving and superbly detailed showing. Curiously though, she became little more than a supporting player halfway through the film, which robbed the story of energy and momentum. While the first half was good, the second half slowed its pace tremendously, becoming a redundant and extremely drawn out attempt at romance. The actors did their best to remain heartfelt and committed to the story, and respectable supporting performances from Leighton Meester and Tim McGraw helped the cause, but Feste allowed the film to slow to a snail’s pace. Sadly, Feste created the perfect ending, but her inexperience as a filmmaker stunted its effectiveness with her handling of the movie’s middle portion. There are plenty of worse music films out there, but you’ve seen it all before, so this is one that can probably be skipped.\n\n——-\n\n4-7-11\n\n1) TRON: Legacy\n\nPlot– When Sam investigates a signal sent from his father’s old arcade, he’s pulled into the digital world where his dad, Kevin Flynn, has been trapped for 20 years. With father and son reunited, they team up with the warrior Quorra on a life-or-death journey across the cyber universe Kevin created. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Joseph Kosinski\n\nWritten by– Adam Horowitz, Edward Kitsis\n\nStarring– Jeff Bridges, Garrett Hedlund, Olivia Wilde, Michael Sheen, James Frain, Beau Garrett\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– There is always cause for concern when a sequel is released so long after its predecessor. It has been 18 years since the 1982 “TRON” was released, and while that is typically a bad sign of things to come, director Joseph Kosinski and “TRON” writer and director Steven Lisberger made sure this was not just another greedy Hollywood sequel. Having the original “TRON” filmmaker working in this production as a producer was a fruitful decision, and Lisberger no doubt was one of the biggest reasons why the lengthy time gap was used to the movie’s benefit. “TRON” was groundbreaking with its use of special effects, and while this film didn’t necessarily do anything new, its utilization of technology was second to none. Joseph Kosinski’s vision of the future was astounding. He provided a dark and visually stunning atmosphere with great camerawork and intense action sequences. Perhaps most impressive was his use of 3D as a part of the film’s plot. While most filmmakers can’t do a thing with 3D, Kosinski’s all-encompassing direction puts him behind only James Cameron’s “Avatar” for best use of 3D to date. There wouldn’t be “TRON” without Jeff Bridges, and his performance was versatile, intense and truly fantastic. His ability to connect himself so deeply to his performance in the first film was impressive given the near two decade gap between movies. Garrett Hedlund was also outstanding in a strong, decisive and well-developed showing. Hedlund is making a habit of good performances, and he was the only good thing about the otherwise forgettable “Country Strong.” Michael Sheen, on the other hand, was horrendous in his terribly forced and corny supporting role that seemed very out of place with the overall mood of the film. Though their writing was not without problems, Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis created a screenplay that told a deep and exciting story with rich and layered characters and plot elements. While the film delivered good intensity and a strong story, it slowed considerably in the second half. Though it never lost its epic feel and strong style, the story and characters became quite hung up on an overly thick layer of sentimentality that started to feel a bit forced after a while. The pace did pick up at the end, and while Horowitz and Kitsis created the perfect ending to an epic story, it was slightly drawn out. Despite a few shortcomings, this film was truly excellent and delivered more than anyone could have possibly imagined.\n\n1) The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\n\nPlot– Lucy and Edmund Pevensie return to Narnia with their cousin Eustace where they meet up with Prince Caspian for a trip across the sea aboard the royal ship The Dawn Treader. Along the way they encounter dragons, dwarves, merfolk, and a band of lost warriors before reaching the edge of the world. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Michael Apted (Agatha, Coal Miner’s Daughter, Continental Divide, Gorky Park, Firstborn, Class Action, Blink, Moving the Mountain, Nell, Extreme Measures, Inspirations, Me & Isaac Newton, The World Is Not Enough, Enigma, Enough, Amazing Grace)\n\nWritten by– Christopher Markus (The Life and Death of Peter Sellers, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, You Kill Me, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian), Stephen McFeely (The Life and Death of Peter Sellers, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, You Kill Me, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian), Michael Petroni (The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys, Queen of the Damned, Till Human Voices Wake Us, Boys Own Story, Possession)\n\nStarring– Ben Barnes, Skandar Keynes, Georgie Henley, Will Poulter, Laura Brent, Simon Pegg, Liam Neeson\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– This was a straightforward children’s adventure story which at times felt more like a religion class than an actual movie. Michael Apted’s direction exaggerated the kid’s fantasy element throughout much of the film. He included plenty of pointless silliness and longwinded side stories that had nothing to do with the main plot, which was weak at best. At least Apted managed to use the film’s 3D theatrical presentation with fair effectiveness, which is more than I can say about the majority of live action 3D films out there. Taking an overview of the film, it contained more passable acting than the majority of children’s action movies, though Will Poulter’s performance was so over-the-top aggravating (on purpose based on his character) that it made some of his scenes difficult to sit through. Georgie Henley and Ben Barnes look as though they have some growing up to do, but I like their potential for future projects. Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely and Michael Petroni wrote a screenplay in which they fully embraced the stereotypical kid’s fantasy characters and heavily overstated “good guys vs. bad guys.” Oddly enough, the film wasn’t as corny as you’d expect from a big budget Hollywood kid’s action movie, though it was so tired, predictable and obvious that there didn’t seem to be a non-financial or non-religious reason for making it. This has been done countless times, and the Narnia trilogy is certainly one we can do without.\n\n3) Little Fockers\n\nPlot– The Focker and the Byrnes families brace themselves for the arrival of a baby. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Paul Weitz (American Pie, Down to Earth, About a Boy, In Good Company, American Dreamz, Cirque du Freak: The Vampire’s Assistant)\n\nWritten by– John Hamburg (Safe Men, Meet the Parents, Zoolander, Along Came Polly, Meet the Fockers, I Love You, Man), Larry Stuckey\n\nStarring– Ben Stiller, Teri Polo, Robert De Niro, Jessica Alba, Dustin Hoffman, Harvey Keitel, Laura Dern, Barbra Streisand, Blythe Danner\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– “Meet the Parents” came out 11 years ago, and it was a surprising but enthusiastic success. Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro played off of one another with precise comedic timing, and the screenplay, while predictable, had strong material and plenty of cleverness to go around. A sequel was unnecessary, but not surprising considering the $166 million taken home by the first film. “Meet the Fockers,” while nowhere near as smart or clever as its predecessor, was entertaining, funny and truly well meaning. As for this latest meaningless page from the Focker family diary, it couldn’t possibly be any worse. The first clue to the film’s impending doom was its incessant immaturity. The first two films were aimed at “general audiences,” but the humor, themes and characters were mostly adult oriented. How this third movie, as unnecessary as it was, got turned into a kid’s movie is beyond me. Indeed, this film was as childish and corny as live action kid’s movies get. In fact, it had the exact same themes, plot and characters as “Shrek Forever After,” which shared its content with 90% of children’s movies. This entire misguided exercise felt like a bad sitcom with its cheesy situations, obvious and poorly written characters. There wasn’t a second of chuckle-worthy material in this movie, and its blatant stupidity made it very painful to sit through. Acting was awful across the board, as Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman and De Niro tried to repeat the same performances they gave in the previous films, only with a screenplay written for a 5-year-old’s mentality. Extreme exaggeration, immaturity, stupidity, predictability, corniness and pointlessness made this movie a torturous experience. Even if you LOVED the first two films, don’t make the mistake of thinking this flimsy kid’s movie will be just as good.\n\n——-\n\n3-31-11\n\n1) Black Swan\n\nPlot– While vying for the coveted lead roles in a production of Swan Lake, a veteran ballerina enters into a twisted friendship with a promising new dancer that threatens to consume her. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Darren Aronofsky (Director of: The Wrestler, The Fountain, Requiem for a Dream, Pi; Writer of: The Fountain, Below, Requiem for a Dream, Pi)\n\nWritten by– Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz, John J. McLaughlin (Man of the House)\n\nStarring– Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, Barbara Hershey, Winona Ryder, Janet Montgomery, Toby Hemingway\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– Darren Aronofsky has outdone himself with a film that will never let you look at a ballerina the same way again. However, no matter how well written and directed this film was, Natalie Portman absolutely stole the show with a breathtaking and haunting performance. Portman became completely consumed with her character both mentally and physically to play this role, and the intensity of her metamorphosis rivaled that of her character. Searing intensity was juxtaposed with fragile, delicate beauty and Portman’s ferocious ability to attack each and every scene created a performance that was almost too painful and real to stomach. Barbara Hershey had tremendous chemistry and raw energy with Portman, and the two played brilliantly off of one another. Hershey deserved an Oscar nomination for her chilling and forcefully crafted performance. Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel and Winona Ryder added outstanding supporting showings to a film that was filled by a small but fiery cast that made the most out of every scene. Though Portman was spectacular and highly deserving of her Oscar for Best Lead Actress, Aronofsky’s direction should not be overlooked. He put the audience right on the edge of the surreal and never let them go. His camerawork was edgy and ever so slightly off balance, yet the film carried a haunting, even forlorn sense of beauty left over from traditional adaptations of Swan Lake. The film thrives off of the unstable energy given out by its small cast of tortured characters, and Mark Heyman, Andres Heinz and John J. McLaughlin wrote them to perfection. Their screenplay perfectly captured vulnerability and instability, and they expertly blended the themes of Swan Lake into the obsession and delusion of troubled and highly vulnerable characters. The screenplay, Aronofsky’s direction and the performances found a way to uncomfortably trap the audience in the film’s unparalleled level of intensity and haunting surrealism. All of these elements forced intensity to build as the film evolved, exploding like an atom bomb with a mind-blowing climax and ending that will take the air right out of your lungs. This was filmmaking perfection, and its ability to envelop the audience with all that is haunting, surreal and passionate was a remarkable achievement. This was indeed one of the year’s best films, light years ahead of more heavily awarded films like “The King’s Speech” and “The Fighter.” Though it may be too intense for some, this is a unique film that cannot be missed.\n\n——-\n\n3-24-11\n\n1) Skyline\n\nPlot– A group of friends fight to survive as a mysterious light source causes people to vanish into the air. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Colin Strause (Aliens vs Predator: Requiem), Greg Strause (Aliens vs Predator: Requiem)\n\nWritten by– Joshua Cordes, Liam O’Donnell\n\nStarring– Eric Balfour, Donald Faison, Scottie Thompson, David Zayas, Brittany Daniel, Crystal Reed\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– Though the brothers Strause don’t have much filmmaking talent, this was a movie that appeared to be a step in the right direction after their ridiculous “Aliens vs Predator: Requiem” debacle. The result was shockingly bad. Opening with highly obvious foreshadowing in every aspect of the production, the Strauses still managed to offer a glimpse of impressive visuals and an entertaining plot that should have made a watchable guilty pleasure science fiction movie. This was the only positive aspect of this failure, and it didn’t last long. Joshua Cordes and Liam O’Donnell wrote a truly horrendous screenplay filled with idiotic characters who acted in ways that were both aggravatingly annoying and entirely nonsensical from any perspective. This film featured a group of the most idiotic characters I’ve seen in a long time, and they were brought to life by the flimsy performances of a talentless supporting cast. The only actor who showed anything positive was, quite surprisingly, Donald Faison, whose small but watchable performance managed to briefly inject energy into such an amateurish cast and crew. Cordes and O’Donnell inserted numerous idiotic and nonsensical plot twists into a film already riddled with obvious plot holes. To say this movie was filled with gaps in logic would be incorrect, as this would imply the presence of logic. To make matters even worse, the Strauses ramped up the corniness and pointless explosions in the second half, which made it even more unwatchable than it already was. Though the plot looks interesting for any science fiction fan, this is a remarkably bad movie that should be avoided at all costs!\n\n2) The Tourist\n\nPlot– Frank Taylor travels to Venice to recover from a recent break-up, though he soon finds himself engaged by the beautiful and mysterious Elise — who happens to be an Interpol agent with a dangerous connection to a fugitive criminal. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck\n\nWritten by– Julian Fellowes (Gosford Park, Piccadilly Jim, Vanity Fair, The Young Victoria), Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects, The Way of the Gun, Valkyrie), Jeffrey Nachmanoff (The Day After Tomorrow, Traitor)\n\nStarring– Johnny Depp, Angelina Jolie, Paul Bettany, Rufus Sewell, Timothy Dalton\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– There are many reasons why this film was the biggest disappointment of 2010. Armed with a top notch, A-list cast, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck had three capable, proven writers and a great plot at his disposal. How in the world did he screw it up so badly? The film began with James Newton Howard’s incessant overuse of music in absolutely every scene. Though it wasn’t all loud Hollywood fare, it was constantly in the background whether it was needed or not — and most of the time it was not. Von Donnersmarck is an inexperienced filmmaker, but a lack of experience is no excuse for his Eastwoodian absence of awareness. His direction reached for a constant feel of mystery, romance and elegance. The result was an unbearably dull, inauthentic and highly superficial Hollywood fluff piece that didn’t contain hardly anything watchable. Though von Donnersmarck’s direction was a bust, at least the acting was stellar, right? Wrong. Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie were atrocious. How could that be possible? Working from a screenplay written with such amateurism, Depp and Jolie were hung out to dry in the worst possible way. Depp in particular looked bored to death with every badly conceived scene he had to struggle through. Jolie, on the other hand, went in the other direction. She forced style and elegance as much as von Donnersmarck’s confused direction, and wound up looking downright foolish. As if things couldn’t get bad enough, the film tried to include numerous highly elaborate and overlong stunt sequences that managed to make things feel even cheesier than they already were. This film is indeed unwatchable, but I think it should be required viewing for aspiring filmmakers. Von Donnersmarck and company literally did everything wrong, and this movie should serve as a highly effective $100 million teaching tool. If not used for this purpose, this movie can cause lethargy, disappointment and frustration. Avoid at all costs!\n\n3) How Do You Know\n\nPlot– Feeling a bit past her prime at 27, former athlete Lisa Jorgenson finds herself in the middle of a love triangle, as a corporate guy in crisis competes with Lisa’s current, baseball-playing beau. (imdb.com)\n\nWritten and Directed by– James L. Brooks (Director: Terms of Endearment, Broadcast News, I’ll Do Anything, As Good as It Gets, Spanglish; Writer of: Starting Over, Terms of Endearment, Broadcast News, I’ll Do Anything, As Good as it Gets, Spanglish, The Simpsons Movie)\n\nStarring– Reese Witherspoon, Paul Rudd, Owen Wilson, Jack Nicholson\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– It seems James L. Brooks has done a bit of a disappearing act since his smash hit “As Good as it Gets.” Brooks’ movies are few and very far between, but those of us eagerly awaiting this one may be a bit disappointed. Looking at this film objectively though, it was actually very watchable overall if your expectations aren’t too high. The first thing to notice is the cast, and Brooks assembled a smart and talented group. Owen Wilson fit his part perfectly and provided a colorful and ever so slightly odd performance that nicely brought his quirky character to life. Reese Witherspoon and Paul Rudd gave believable performances, but didn’t show anything particularly special. Disappointingly, Jack Nicholson was barely in the film, and was unable to do much with his scant role. Brooks’ screenplay contained smart and lifelike characters who had good chemistry together. The film was written with a very natural and thoughtful air, as the characters were mostly introspective in their intelligent interactions with one another. Brooks inserted subtle comedy into a number of scenes, and while the film felt realistic, he never seemed able to push the characters or story to their full potential. While believable, it found a way to devolve into a cheesy and predictable Hollywood romance, filled with all of the clichés you see from most other run of the mill movies in the genre. The slowness, predictability and corniness that filled the final half hour provided the biggest disappointment of all, as it is not what we’ve come to expect from a filmmaker who spends so much time carefully writing and developing a film. The end result was a film that was mostly enjoyable, but perhaps too weak and timid for its own good.\n\n4) Yogi Bear\n\nPlot– A documentary filmmaker travels to Jellystone Park to shoot a project and soon crosses paths with Yogi Bear and his sidekick Boo-Boo. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Eric Brevig (Journey to the Center of the Earth)\n\nWritten by– Jeffrey Ventimilia (Surviving Christmas, Tooth Fairy), Joshua Sternin (Surviving Christmas, Tooth Fairy), Brad Copeland (Wild Hogs)\n\nVoices of– Dan Aykroyd, Justin Timberlake, Anna Faris, Christine Taylor, T.J. Miller, Tom Cavanagh\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– The popularity of Yogi Bear expired decades ago, so to make a Yogi movie now seems oddly out of place. Trailers made this look quite poor, and the crew didn’t make expectations any higher. Eric Brevig’s attempt at “Journey to the Center of the Earth” was a complete failure, and the three writers have three awful movies between them. Despite all of the negatives, Brevig and company managed to create a clever and surprisingly funny movie – that is, of course, until it fell apart at the halfway point. Dan Aykroyd was the perfect voice of Yogi, and he gave plenty of personality to the character. Justin Timberlake also gave a great co-starring vocal performance. I’ve said for years that Timberlake is supremely talented as an actor, and while the careful choices he made in his perfectly timed showing may be lost on the film’s young target audience, it serves as further proof that his range is expanding with each role he selects. Tom Cavanagh was also quite good in his live action performance. He was given the opportunity to display his usual quick wit because Jeffrey Ventimilia, Joshua Sternin and Brad Copeland wrote the first half of the film as a smart comedy with clever dialogue between characters. Brevig handled the mix of animation and live action nicely and even managed to incorporate successful slapstick sequences. The movie was obvious and predictable, but it still provided comedy and entertainment under difficult conditions. Unfortunately, as these films often do, it turned sour at the halfway mark, devolving into the cheesy, childish collage of bad stunts and corny kid’s movie messages. While it didn’t end well, the first half was quite impressive indeed, and I’ll take half of a good movie over a whole bad movie any day!\n\n——-\n\n3-17-11\n\n1) The Fighter\n\nPlot– A look at the early years of boxer “Irish” Micky Ward and his brother, Dick Eklund, who helped train to become a pro fighter. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– David O. Russell (Spanking the Monkey, Flirting with Disaster, Three Kings, I Heart Huckabees)\n\nWritten by– Scott Silver (Johns, The Mod Squad, 8 Mile), Paul Tamasy (Air Bud, Air Bud: Golden Receiver, Walking Across Egypt), Eric Johnson\n\nStarring– Mark Wahlberg, Christian Bale, Melissa Leo, Amy Adams, Jack McGee\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– It has been a long time since a truly outstanding sports movie was made. More to the point, I thought boxing movies were dead when critics universally ignored the Oscar-worthy Russell Crowe helmed “Cinderella Man.” Not only was this a great sports movie, but it was a truly excellent film more than worthy of the praise it has received. David O. Russell is an odd choice to direct a film of this type considering he has no experience whatsoever in the genre. His documentary style direction was highly effective in opening up the audience to the gritty world of the emotionally charged characters. Russell’s direction reached for realism and no-frills authenticity at every turn, resulting in a poignant movie from start to finish. Scott Silver, Paul Tamasy and Eric Johnson came together to write a moving and electric screenplay. They developed complex relationships, and grew detailed and layered psychological elements in all characters. The film possessed soulfulness as characters reflected on their lives, the mistakes they made and the opportunities that passed them by. The push and pull between the characters was exhilarating, and the film’s large collection of phenomenal performances helped the film reach another level. Mark Wahlberg led the way with an outstanding performance built on sweat, determination and a fire in his eyes that pierced the screen. When this movie came out I’m pretty sure no one expected Christian Bale to win an Oscar, but his transformation into his washed up, delusional character made him by far the best supporting actor of the year. Bale gave so much to the actors around him, and his combination of raw energy, contemplation and love for his brother showed yet again the epic range he possesses. Amy Adams and Melissa Leo were very strong as well, though Leo’s Oscar win was a bit of a stretch. If anything Adams was more deserving, but no one can deny that the collective power of this film’s actors wasn’t tightly bound with its success. Ultimately this film found a way to completely transcend the sports movie genre and become a truly unforgettable film.\n\n2) The Switch\n\nPlot– An unmarried 40-year-old woman turns to artificial means in order to become pregnant. Seven years later, she reunites with her best friend, who has been living with a secret: he replaced her preferred sperm sample with his own. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Josh Gordon (Blades of Glory), Will Speck (Blades of Glory)\n\nWritten by– Allan Loeb (Things We Lost in the Fire, 21, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps)\n\nStarring– Jennifer Aniston, Jason Bateman, Patrick Wilson, Juliette Lewis, Jeff Goldblum, Todd Louiso, Thomas Robinson\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– While this film’s trailers did not make it seem all that appetizing, there was reason to believe it could have been a sleeper success. Jason Bateman has the intelligence and pristine comedic timing to make almost anything funny, and directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck provided quite a few laughs in the random and highly bizarre “Blades of Glory.” Even though the film had some good quick humor early on, it ultimately fizzled out and became mostly forgettable. Allan Loeb’s writing contained a good mix of emotional sincerity and sarcastic humor which played very well into Bateman’s skill set. His screenplay was geared more toward intelligence and drama rather than comedy, which would have been fine had it been able to sustain interest and momentum from beginning to end. Gordon and Speck did very little with their direction to bring out either humor or the quirky personalities of the characters. The film’s performances were respectable overall, but quite surprisingly, child actor Thomas Robinson completely stole the show with an absolutely outstanding performance. His presence provided a shocking level of maturity, intelligent humor and comedic timing that only a seasoned actor like Bateman is supposed to be able to pull off. This was a well-meaning film that probably never intended to embrace the standard Hollywood relationship clichés that wound up defining it. Though the dramatic element of the film made the characters feel more realistic, it was simply too slow in its pacing and was unable to provide anything to fill those gaps. This is not a movie that I would recommend watching, but Thomas Robinson’s performance was so impressive for someone so young that it would be a shame to miss it.\n\n3) Hereafter\n\nPlot– A supernatural thriller centered on three people — a blue-collar American, a French journalist and a London school boy — who are touched by death in different ways. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Clint ‘The Overrated One’ Eastwood (Invictus, Gran Turino, Changeling, Flags of Our Fathers, Million Dollar Baby, Mystic River, Blood Work, Space Cowboys, True Crime, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Unforgiven, The Rookie, Bird, Firefox, The Outlaw Josey Wales)\n\nWritten by– Peter Morgan (Dear Rosie, Martha, Meet Frank, Daniel and Laurence, The Last King of Scotland, The Queen, The Other Boleyn Girl. Frost/Nixon)\n\nStarring– Matt Damon, Cécile De France, Bryce Dallas Howard, Jay Mohr, Richard Kind\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– Leave it to Clint Eastwood to take a promising idea with a great cast and run it into the ground. This is yet another example of Eastwood’s total inability to tell a story or accomplish even the simplest of filmmaking-related tasks. Right out of the gate the film took on a very scattered feel, and it only got worse from there. This was a very poorly written movie that had no sense of narrative structure, filling its unbearably long two hours with wandering, dull and overlong subplots crammed with useless information and characters that went nowhere. The main premise was quite intriguing, and Peter Morgan has experienced success as a writer, especially with his triumphant handling of “The Queen” and “Frost/Nixon.” With this screenplay it seemed that he had no idea what he was doing. Morgan found a way to focus on all of the wrong things, and before long he completely neutralized the potential of every interesting plot point. While this screenplay was quite poor, he was no doubt railroaded by Eastwood’s numerous directorial deficiencies. The monotonous and generally lackluster feel that is present in most Eastwood movies was in full force here, as it took over an hour of running time for something even mildly interesting to occur. The film dealt with supernatural themes, something Eastwood had never really dealt with in his lengthy career. His total inability to understand even basic themes relating to storytelling, mood, pace, camerawork and acting turned what should have been a supernatural thriller into a mind-numbing made-for-TV movie with no story. The only reason this movie was released in the United States at all was because of Matt Damon, who was billed as the star. Damon was barely present in the film, and though he was able to experience some success and believability in his scenes, they were too few and far between to make any impact whatsoever. The film’s main star was actually Cécile De France, who probably has more talent than her generally uninspired performance was able to show. Of course, being in a Clint Eastwood movie can bring any talented actor down to an amateur level. Ultimately there was nothing in this boring movie worth watching; chalk it up as another Eastwood failure.\n\n——-\n\n3-10-11\n\n1) The Next Three Days\n\nPlot– A married couple’s life is turned upside down when Lara Brennan is accused of murder. Three years into her sentence, Lara’s husband John is struggling to keep their family together and, realizing his wife’s deteriorating condition, he decides to break her out of prison. (imdb.com)\n\nWritten and Directed by– Paul Haggis (Director of: Red Hot, Crash, In the Valley of Elah; Writer of: Red Hot, Crash, Flags of Our Fathers, Million Dollar Baby, The Last Kiss, In the Valley of Elah, Quantum of Solace)\n\nStarring– Russell Crowe, Elizabeth Banks, Liam Neeson, Olivia Wilde, Brian Dennehy, Jonathan Tucker, Lennie James, RZA\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– Paul Haggis has had a difficult time following the brilliance of “Crash,” spending most of his time as a writer rather than building his career as a filmmaker. Though not an original story, his latest effort from showed a deliberate style and aggressive attention character development. The film was set up nicely, building a strong emotional core around the characters that was easy to be drawn into. One of the film’s most impressive features was Haggis’ ability to logically develop every one of the characters’ motivations. The film was engrossing not only for its action sequences, which were not necessarily the focal point. Rather, Haggis built such thick layers of growth into the plot and characters that watching them try to figure out what to do next became as absorbing as a car chase or shootout. Haggis’ dark and pensive direction also added plenty to the film, but Russell Crowe’s performance was an all-encompassing display of dedication, desperation, obsession and strength. Crowe’s attention to detail and the reaching effect of his simultaneously cerebral yet instinctive approach to his character created a performance that elevated an already great film to another level. Haggis did a wonderful job creating suspense and anticipation, even though he managed to change the mood of the film numerous times between character-driven drama, and a more action-oriented style. I think it’s hard to dislike a good prison break movie, even though there are relatively few of them made today. Many are filled with plot holes and turn out to be guilty pleasures more than anything else. This film, which is frustratingly underrated, can be regarded as a very high quality movie that is a must see for any fan of detail-driven suspense and great acting.\n\n2) Morning Glory\n\nPlot– A hotshot television producer is set the challenge of reviving a struggling morning show program, despite the constant feuding of its high-profile anchors. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Roger Michell (Persuasion, My Night with Reg, Titanic Town, Notting Hill, Changing Lanes, The Mother, Enduring Love, Venus)\n\nWritten by– Aline Brosh McKenna (Three to Tango, Laws of Attraction, The Devil Wears Prada, 27 Dresses)\n\nStarring– Rachel McAdams, The Harrison Ford, Diane Keaton, Patrick Wilson, Matt Malloy, Jeff Goldblum, John Pankow\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– This was an outstanding, well-rounded and highly underappreciated movie that left nothing to be desired. Writer Aline Brosh McKenna got lucky with the enormous success of “The Devil Wears Prada,” but her other films were formulaic, lazy Hollywood flops. That is why the high level of intelligence, strong character development and undeniable charm she incorporated into this script was such a shock. From the very beginning characters were established with personality and wit, providing realistic and entertaining personalities that thrived in a wide range of environments. McKenna’s screenplay defiantly brought out the best in Roger Michell’s pitch perfect direction. Michell has a varied resume, and the depth of his experience was brought out whimsy, sincerity, class and complete authenticity in a movie that could have very easily been little more than forgettable Hollywood fluff. In fact, Michell and McKenna created an environment that had plenty of strong humor as well as a sincere dramatic side. Though the writing and direction did well to bring out the best in the film’s rich plot and characters, this fantastic cast deserves a great deal of credit, as outstanding performances were found at every turn. Rachel McAdams delivered another high quality, multi-dimensional performance as the film’s lead. Her high energy level, intelligence, drive and quick wit resulted in a perfectly crafted role. The Harrison Ford, whose career essentially bottomed out after “The Fugitive,” may have missed the boat on comedy because not only does he possess impeccable comedic timing, but he also has an impressive command of his voice and facial expressions. Ford used all of these tools to deliver his first great performance in a very long time. Speaking of rebounds, Diane Keaton also turned in an excellent supporting showing. Aided by an eccentric character and a great chemistry with Ford, Keaton added yet another dimension to a cast not lacking in eccentric characters. Though it may have the appearance of a forgettable Hollywood romantic comedy, this was a truly great movie that deserves praise and recognition.\n\n——-\n\n3-3-11\n\n1) Love and Other Drugs\n\nPlot– A romantic comedy that skewers the pharmaceutical industry and is centered on relentlessly charming Viagra salesman Jamie Reidy and his romantic involvement with free-spirited Maggie Murdock. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Edward Zwick (Defiance, Blood Diamond, The Last Samurai, The Siege, Courage Under Fire, Legends of the Fall, Leaving Normal, Glory, About Last Night)\n\nWritten by– Charles Randolph (The Life of David Gale, The Interpreter), Edward Zwick (The Siege, The Last Samurai, Defiance), Marshall Herskovitz (The Last Samurai)\n\nStarring– Jake Gyllenhaal, Anne Hathaway, Judy Greer, Josh Gad, Hank Azaria, Oliver Platt, Gabriel Macht, George Segal\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– If you take a stroll through Edward Zwick’s resume you’ll quickly see that romantic comedy is not a genre with which he has a great deal of experience. His finely polished action-oriented style seems to have no place in a film like this, but the result proves that great acting, great writing and great characters bring out the best in any good filmmaker, regardless of previous experience. Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway had tremendous chemistry together and it was impossible not to connect with their personalities and intelligently written characters. Gyllenhaal’s quick delivery and dynamic persona constantly battled with Hathaway’s unpredictable, combative free spirit. Zwick, along with co-writers Charles Randolph and Marshall Herskovitz crafted a wonderful and highly layered screenplay. Characters were dynamic, detailed and lifelike, dialogue was smart and the story evolved wonderfully. Zwick’s direction managed moods very well, expertly interlacing comedy with serious and dark emotional scenes. The film had no shortage of colorful and interesting supporting characters, so it was no surprise that it reaped the benefits of enjoyable and well-crafted supporting performances from Josh Gad, Hank Azaria and Judy Greer. Zwick created a strong bond between the characters and the audience, making it impossible not to be engrossed in their lives. The film’s only shortcomings were its predictability down the stretch and an ending that was a bit too corny for such a mature and intelligent work. This was a heavily previewed film that wound up unjustly ignored by fans and critics, but it was truly a well-made movie that deserves to be seen.\n\n2) Faster\n\nPlot– An ex-con sets out to avenge his brother’s death after they were double-crossed during a heist years ago. During his campaign, however, he’s tracked by a veteran cop and an egocentric hit man. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– George Tillman Jr. (Writer of: Soul Food; Director of: Soul Food, Men of Honor, Notorious)\n\nWritten by– Tony Gayton (Athens, Ga. – Inside/Out, The Salton Sea, Murder by Numbers), Joe Gayton (Uncommon Valor, Warm Summer Rain, Shout, Bulletproof, Sweet Jane)\n\nStarring– Dwayne Johnson, Billy Bob Thornton, Maggie Grace, Carla Gugino, Tom Berenger, Jennifer Carpenter, Moon Bloodgood\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– Most of Dwayne Johnson’s movies fall under one of two categories – ultra-corny Hollywood kid’s movie or ultra-corny Hollywood action movie. While this film had the potential to be another addition to the latter, it actually turned out to be very solid and surprisingly well made. George Tillman Jr. is not a confidence-inspiring director. All three of his movies had too many problems to overcome, but this time he was able to effectively carve out a path for this movie. Tillman’s direction was methodical, but also had a stylish bluntness that allowed a highly simple screenplay to turn its collection of clichéd characters into a positive. Indeed we’ve seen these stereotypical characters a thousand times before, but Tillman’s ability to weave the film’s three storylines together and a complete lack of wasted time or embellishment provided the perfect blend of forceful action and excitement. Johnson was quite solid with his one-dimensional character, turning that simplicity into a performance that matched the grittiness of the direction. The same can be said about Billy Bob Thornton, who turned his highly clichéd character into a surprisingly excellent showing. Tillman’s style and vision went a long way, but unfortunately they seemed to quickly fade just as the film was reaching its climax, which revealed several highly predictable and elementary plot twists and proved to be somewhat of a letdown. Despite Tillman’s somewhat misguided handling of the ending, this was a very solid action film which achieved a gritty, strong-willed simplicity that many action films are unable to realize. Though not perfect, it was a highly watchable film that should provide solid entertainment.\n\n3) 127 Hours\n\nPlot– Mountain climber Aron Ralston becomes trapped under a boulder while canyoneering alone near Moab, Utah and resorts to desperate measures in order to survive. Based on a true story. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Danny Boyle (Shallow Grave, Trainspotting, A Life Less Ordinary, The Beach, 28 Days Later…, Millions, Sunshine, Slumdog Millionaire)\n\nWritten by– Danny Boyle, Simon Beaufoy (The Full Monty, Among Giants, The Darkest Light, Running Time, Blow Dry, This is Not a Love Song, Yasmin, Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day, Slumdog Millionaire)\n\nStarring– James Franco, Lizzy Caplan, Kate Mara, Amber Tamblyn, Clémence Poésy, Treat Williams, Kate Burton\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– Though critics have carried this film into slightly “overrated” territory, it is simply impossible to say enough about James Franco’s performance, which was hands down the best of 2010. Under no circumstances did Colin Firth deserve an Oscar more than he did, and his snub was disgraceful. Franco dove headfirst into a high energy character and the result was an astounding, otherworldly level of raw, unrelenting intensity. The chemistry between Danny Boyle and Franco was incredible. Boyle’s direction included plenty of his trademarked frenzy and chaos, but his ability to deposit the audience directly into the mind of the film’s lone character was even more impressive. Boyle has always been an experimental filmmaker, and his barrage of visual effects and inventive camerawork worked to perfection. Notably, he used close-ups better than I’ve seen a filmmaker do in a very long time, which brought the audience all too close to Franco’s emotionally explosive performance. Though its plot was highly tricky and admittedly not very attractive, it pulled the audience in immediately and didn’t let them go until close to the end. Franco and Boyle constantly increased the intensity, making the audience feel every bit of fear and desperation that Aron Ralston felt. At times the film even developed a dreamlike quality in which bright visuals were juxtaposed by a looming darkness that always brought things back to earth. For much of the film it seemed like Boyle could do no wrong, but his handling of the ending proved quite forced, obvious to the point of peachy, repetitive and perhaps even a bit corny for the intensity that preceded. It’s not a film you’ll watch more than once, but you’re not likely to forget it either.\n\n——-\n\n2-24-11\n\n1) Due Date\n\nPlot– High-strung father-to-be Peter Highman is forced to hitch a ride with aspiring actor Ethan Tremblay on a road trip in order to make it to his child’s birth on time. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Todd Phillips (The Hangover, School for Scoundrels, Starsky & Hutch, Old School, Bittersweet Motel, Road Trip)\n\nWritten by– Alan R. Cohen, Alan Freedland, Adam Sztykiel (Made of Honor), Todd Phillips (School for Scoundrels, Starsky & Hutch, Old School, Road Trip)\n\nStarring– Robert Downey Jr., Zach Galifianakis, Michelle Monaghan, Juliette Lewis, Jamie Foxx, Danny McBride, Alan Arkin, RZA\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– After the incredible success Todd Phillips enjoyed from “The Hangover,” I wondered if a hangover was actually in store for him. The odds were against it however with the supremely talented Robert Downey Jr at the helm, and a reunion with Zach Galifianakis. However this film achieved success in an entirely different way than “The Hangover.” Downey Jr. and Galifianakis were indeed a great “odd couple” pairing. Galifianakis sported his usual laid back while completely bizarre yet slightly effeminate style of comedic acting, and Downey Jr. provided a sharp-witted and highly sarcastic performance that was perfect for his “straight man” character. If you go into this film expecting enormous laughs like “The Hangover” or “Old School,” you’re going to be disappointed; the film had very little comedy to speak of. Phillips and co-writer Alan R. Cohen did a great job in the creation of these real and extremely lifelike characters. As a pair they complemented each other in a variety of ways, and the screenplay made them real people who were not just deliverers of cheap Hollywood gimmicks. In his direction it was clear Phillips was going for a much more realistic approach than some of his other films, and though it was lacking in comedy, it created a strong connection to the characters that continue to build and evolve throughout the film. It is very possible that Phillips was attempting to downplay comedy to such a large degree that he left an enormous amount of intelligent and creative comedy unrealized. The outstanding chemistry between Downey Jr. and Galifianakis carried the film quite well and over the course of this surprisingly deep road movie. Though no one expected it to be more of a drama than a comedy, it was still a very solid and intelligently made movie that proved quite enjoyable.\n\n2) Get Low\n\nPlot– In 1930s Tennessee, backwoods hermit Felix Bush decides to throw his own funeral … while he’s still alive. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Aaron Schneider\n\nWritten by– Chris Provenzano, C. Gaby Mitchell\n\nStarring– Robert Duvall, Bill Murray, Sissy Spacek, Lucas Black\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– When this tiny indie film earned a national summer release after wandering about in limited markets, everyone saw it as a surefire Oscar vehicle for Robert Duvall. Unfortunately the film simply had too many problems to overcome, and turned out to be entirely forgettable. Aaron Schneider opened the film with a dark mood juxtaposed by subdued off-kilter comedic moments. However it did not take long for the minimalistic story to feel slow, and this would only worsen as the film continued. There were periods of time when it seemed as though Duvall was going to save the film with a truly outstanding performance. His antisocial and seemingly emotionally absent character was buried under decades of guilt and pain, and Duvall showed presence, patience and impeccable decision-making. Bill Murray and Lucas Black also provided solid supporting performances in a movie that was very well acted overall. Unfortunately there wasn’t much else to enjoy other than the acting. After a promising start Schneider did nothing with the rest of the film, slowing things down to an almost nonexistent pace. The screenplay held plenty of psychological material but somehow found a way to become less and less interesting with each scene. This even railroaded Duvall’s performance near the end because the screenplay offered so little in the way of story or character development. Ultimately this film squandered tremendous potential with its failed minimalism and a one-track which plot simply could not sustain itself. Feel free to give this one a pass — you’re not missing anything.\n\n3) Megamind\n\nPlot– Megamind is the most brilliant super-villain the world has ever known, though after several unsuccessful attempts to conquer Metro City, a new foe sees him attempt — for the first time in his life — to use his powers for good. (imdb.com) Dir- Tom McGrath (Madagascar, Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa)\n\nDirected by– Tom McGrath (Writer and Director of: Madagascar, Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa)\n\nWritten by– Alan J. Schoolcraft, Brent Simons\n\nVoices of– Will Ferrell, Jonah Hill, Brad Pitt, Tina Fey, David Cross\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– This was a standard kid’s movie that never deviated from the themes, predictability and corniness that is present in the vast majority of films in this genre. The only noteworthy element of the film was the CGI, which was absolutely first rate. It even used 3D quite well which is a rare achievement indeed. The film contained a few scenes of clever comedy but there was just too much corniness and predictability to make it enjoyable. Vocal performances were forced all around, especially Will Ferrell who simply yelled in a monotone voice and seemed confused as to handle the majority of his scenes. Tina Fey was the only worthwhile performer in this cast, because no matter how bad things are around her, she has too much talent to look bad at anything. Much was made of Brad Pitt’s supposed co-starring role in this movie, but he was barely present. Obviously DreamWorks executives only use his name to sell tickets. Even though the film’s visuals were highly creative, every character’s eyes were WAY too big. Anyway just isn’t much to say about this predictable, corny and essentially forgettable kid’s movie.\n\n——-\n\n2-17-11\n\n1) Unstoppable\n\nPlot– A rail company frantically works to prevent an unmanned, half-mile-long freight train carrying combustible liquids and poisonous gas from wiping out a city. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Tony Scott (The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3, Déjà-Vu, Domino, Man of Fire, Spy Game, Enemy of the State, Crimson Tide, Top Gun)\n\nWritten by– Mark Bomback (The Night Caller, Godsend, Live Free or Die Hard, Deception, Race to Witch Mountain)\n\nStarring– Denzel Washington, Chris Pine, Rosario Dawson, Ethan Suplee, Kevin Dunn\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– Are you ready for an adrenaline rush? I hope so because there are not very many films that deliver non-stop intensity at such a breakneck pace. Tony Scott hit a four year rough patch in his career after his editing style took a turn for the incoherent and ruined the highly promising “Domino.” Then poor storytelling and directorial uncertainty proceeded to derail “Déjà Vu” and “The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3” remake. Scott is back, and with this movie there was no mistaking it. From the first scene Scott’s direction was crisp and decisive, and the story wasted no time. He packed the film with thick suspense and a level of intensity that frankly no one was expecting out of an excessively advertised Speed-esque Hollywood action movie. While Scott was delivering constant thrills, Denzel Washington and Chris Pine were developing a perfect one-two punch. These actors had outstanding chemistry, and their dedication to their characters did not go unnoticed. Both displayed a commanding star-like presence at different times throughout the film, and neither one could really be considered the official “star.” Scott and writer Mark Bomback did a great job with character development, allowing numerous reversals in attitude to help shape the story and provide it with a more well-rounded personality. The film’s lone black mark was a extremely ridiculous performance by Kevin Dillon of a completely idiotic and over-the-top sleazy character. Still there wasn’t much that could touch Scott’s frenetic, edge-of-your seat direction or the overall level of intensity this film achieved. This movie is a must see!\n\n2) You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger\n\nPlot– The passions, ambitions, and anxieties of two married couples — Alfie and Helena, and their daughter Sally and her husband Roy — lead the lovers into trouble and out of their minds. (imdb.com)\n\nWritten and Directed by– Woody Allen\n\nStarring– Anthony Hopkins, Naomi Watts, Josh Brolin, Antonio Banderas, Gemma Jones, Freida Pinto\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– Woody Allen’s European excursion continues to elevate his writing, direction, storytelling and an otherworldly ability to create detailed and lifelike characters. All the while, critics and fans continue to pay no attention to his great work, ignorantly passing it off as forgettable or mediocre. Woody crafted a wonderful screenplay for this film, filling it with colorful characters, all of whom were layered and remarkably well developed. Dialogue was smartly written and carried both familiarity and symbolism, a difficult combination indeed. Woody’s direction was both artistic and accessible, flawlessly interweaving classic character struggles with a lighthearted mood that made it feel all the more enjoyable. Performances were a treat as well with Josh Brolin, Anthony Hopkins and Naomi Watts giving memorable showings filled with personality and presence. Gemma Jones really stood out as the film’s most memorable performance. She embraced her character and presented a thoughtful and moving effort that was ridiculously snubbed for a worthy Best Supporting Actress nomination. Woody truly is a master of the ensemble cast, and his writing and direction always provides every actor with so many opportunities despite less screentime. This was an excellent offering from Woody Allen, and it, along with its creator, deserve a great deal more respect.\n\n3) Waiting for ‘Superman’\n\nPlot– A documentary on the state of public education in America. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Davis Guggenheim (An Inconvenient Truth, Gracie)\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– The education system is one with numerous problems- enough to fill at least a 10 part Ken Burns length documentary series. With lack of material not a concern Davis Guggenheim filled his film with a great deal of information, and covered the bureaucracy of the education system especially well. The trouble is, the vast majority of what was contained in the film is common knowledge. Whether you’ve heard about them on the news, read about them in the paper, heard someone else talking about them or experienced them yourself, the deficiencies in America’s education system aren’t mired in a Watergate-esque conspiracy. I liked how Guggenheim presented the film with a somewhat somber mood. He paced it very well with a solid narrative structure, and a constant barrage of information that touched on just about everything education-related. However Guggenheim made the terrible decision to break the flow of a serious documentary and make the end credits of the film just about as preachy and sappy as you can get, plus he included a terrible John Legend song to accentuate the cheesiness. Luckily the rest of the film wasn’t like that. Perhaps even worse was the fact that Guggenheim failed to present a single solution to any of the numerous issues presented in the film. The film serves as a well made documentary (sans John Legend) of what is wrong with America’s education system, but it completely missed its opportunity to travel beyond that.\n\n——-\n\n2-10-11\n\n1) Paranormal Activity 2\n\nPlot– A family becomes increasingly disturbed by a nightly demonic presence in their home. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Tod Williams (Writer/Director of: The Adventures of Sebastian Cole, The Door in the Floor)\n\nWritten by– Michael R. Perry\n\nStarring– Brian Boland, Molly Ephraim, Katie Featherston, Seth Ginsberg, Sprague Grayden, Vivis Cortez\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– Did we need a sequel to the highly overrated “Paranormal Activity?” Absolutely not. However looking at it strictly from a filmmaking standpoint, the film had the opportunity to improve in practically all areas. Shockingly that’s exactly what happened, though no one could have predicted this based on the way the film started. Despite including a lot more characters in the first 30 minutes or so, there were also many unnecessary scenes. Basically the movie just teetered on the verge of mildly interesting. As it turned out, Michael R. Perry introduced some good ideas during this time, though he would have been better served had he not taken him more than half of the film’s running time to get them going. Tod Williams is a much stronger filmmaker than the first film’s director, Oren Peli, and this directorial change began to pay dividends after the story picked up steam. Williams handled suspense wonderfully and was able to thoroughly engross the audience in the events that were happening to the entirely normal family depicted in the film. This family was played believably by a group of unknowns whose performances were also a reason the energy level was able to climb appropriately as the intensity grew. Overall Williams packed a great deal of scares and intensity into the second half of the film, turning it into the exciting, raw horror minimalism that people pretended the first film was. I loved the way this sequel was constructed because it actually made its predecessor completely irrelevant. Though the film began with the same slowness and lackadaisical attitude of its ridiculously overrated predecessor, it actually turned into a very respectable horror film.\n\n2) Life as We Know It\n\nPlot– Two single adults become caregivers to an orphaned girl when their mutual best friends die in an accident. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Greg Berlanti (The Broken Hearts Club: A Romantic Comedy)\n\nWritten by– Ian Deitchman, Kristin Rusk Robinson\n\nStarring– Katherine Heigl, Josh Duhamel, Josh Lucas, Melissa McCarthy, Jean Smart, Faizon Love\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– With the exception of “Knocked Up,” Katherine Heigl has shown no promise in her movie career, and this film is just another example of the lazy, Hollywood characters that she continues to play. While the trailers made this film look like nothing more than a collection of cheesy sitcom moments that we’ve seen thousands of times already, director Greg Berlanti did his very best to turn it into a believable romantic drama. Overall the film was mostly believable, and Ian Deitchman and Kristin Rusk Robinson did a very solid job of bringing out real emotions in the characters and the challenges they faced. As usual, Heigl showed nothing special in her performance, but along with a respectable showing from Josh Duhamel, the two were entirely believable. Though this movie was not filled to the brim with cheesy Hollywood romantic comedy antics, it did carry a fairly extensive collection of every baby related joke and situation you’ve ever seen. Even though the direction and writing aimed more towards reality then Hollywood fantasy, the characters were quite one-dimensional and the entire movie was very predictable from beginning to end. Overall it did not have any original ideas and felt pretty slow at times, but it meant well as a feel-good romance and should probably work effectively in that regard.\n\n3) My Soul to Take\n\nPlot– A serial killer returns to his hometown to stalk seven children who share the same birthday as the date he was allegedly put to rest. (imdb.com)\n\nWritten and Directed by– Wes Craven\n\nStarring– Max Thieriot, Emily Meade, John Magaro, Frank Grillo, Denzel Whitaker, Zena Grey, Jessica Hecht, Nick Lashaway\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– Wes Craven is an empty, talentless filmmaker. The man had a couple of good ideas several decades ago and even those films failed to reach their potential. This movie was an idiotic and childish waste of time that had absolutely nothing to offer. The corny, obvious third-grade level of writing that Craven has provided time and time again was on full display here. His screenplay was little more than a partial copy of “Nightmare on Elm St.” mixed with a cheesy kid’s ghost story. To round out the awfulness, Craven even managed to include numerous high school clichés and plenty of awful characters. His direction was clunky and uninspired, and there wasn’t a single worthwhile idea in the entire exercise. The plot was predictable even though it bounced around in so many childish directions, ultimately selecting the most idiotic and nonsensical conclusion. Performances ranged from bland to exaggerated, but not even stellar acting would have done any good. Avoid this trashy excuse for a movie (and Wes Craven for that matter) at all costs! Aren’t you excited for “Scream 4?”\n\n4) It’s Kind of a Funny Story\n\nPlot– A clinically depressed teenager gets a new start after he checks himself into an adult psychiatric ward, where he bonds with one patient and sparks with another. (imdb.com)\n\nWritten and Directed by– Anna Boden (Half Nelson, Sugar), Ryan Fleck (Half Nelson, Sugar)\n\nStarring– Keir Gilchrist, Zach Galifianakis, Emma Roberts, Lauren Graham, Zoë Kravitz, Jeremy Davies, Viola Davis, Jim Gaffigan\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– This film had a great deal of potential and actually found many ways to realize it for 60% of the running time; unfortunately the last 40% simply ran out of steam. Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck hit a homerun with the gritty and highly authentic emotional delivery of “Half Nelson,” and while this film’s story and characters were not nearly as harsh, their writing and direction created a thick and heavy emotional core that contained intelligence and cleverness while also adeptly injecting moments of levity into dark scenarios. Keir Gilchrist did a great job with his quiet and unassuming character. His performance was entirely believable, and despite the often confused and understated personality he presented, he quietly adapted to a wide range of scenarios and eccentric supporting characters. Zach Galifianakis gave a pitch perfect supporting role, as he delivered his expressions, mannerisms and personality with precise timing and achieved a full immersion into his character. Boden and Fleck developed the film extremely well, creating a strong sense of attachment to the characters and their environment. Their direction creatively captured the characters’ states of mind, problems and idiosyncrasies, but as the film drifted into the second half it seemed to lose the majority of its effectiveness in storytelling, character development and humor. The screenplay showed more areas that needed tightening, and Boden and Fleck allowed the film to wander until it essentially became entirely predictable and had abandoned all of its real emotions and psychological detail. Ultimately the film became little more than a predictable teen romance that you’ve seen hundreds of times. Gilchrist and Galifianakis were essentially hung out to dry, as were quality supporting performers such as Emma Roberts and Jeremy Davies. Even though this film did not finish what it started I believe it accomplished a good bit and probably deserves to be seen.\n\n5) You Again\n\nPlot– When Marni realizes her brother is about to marry the girl who bullied her in high school, she sets out to expose the fiancée’s true colors. (imdb.com)\n\nDirected by– Andy Fickman (She’s the Man, The Game Plan, Race to Witch Mountain)\n\nWritten by– Moe Jelline\n\nStarring– Kristen Bell, Odette Yustman, Sigourney Weaver, Betty White, Kristin Chenoweth, Jamie Lee Curtis, Cloris Leachman\n\nMovieguy’s Verdict– I have been waiting a long time to write this review.
