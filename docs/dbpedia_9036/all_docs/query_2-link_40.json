        "text": "HIGH POINT, N.C., March 11, 2014 – High Point University will host one of the most successful musical theatre composers in history, Broadway legend Charles Strouse, on its stage for a special evening of celebration. The showcase will be held at 7:30 p.m. March 25 in the Pauline Theatre of the Hayworth Fine Arts Center.\n\nThe event is free and open to the public, but reservations are required. To reserve tickets, email [email protected] or call 336-841-9209.\n\nBest known and cherished for the classics “Annie” and “Bye Bye Birdie,” Strouse will share personal stories, performances and tributes from his life and career onstage and in cinema. The evening will also include some of Strouse’s musical theatre scenes performed by HPU students.\n\n“Charles Strouse has touched the life of almost every American in the last half century,” says Scott MacLeod, assistant professor of music. “It is a tremendous opportunity for our students, faculty, staff and the High Point community alike to work with a true legend of the Broadway stage.”\n\nStrouse selected HPU junior Ashley Siebeneichen as his intern this past summer. Now Songwriters Hall of Fame member, along with his wife Barbara, is setting aside time to teach a series of workshops and master classes on the HPU campus leading up to the event on March 23-24.\n\nAccording to MacLeod, this is an experience that does not come along every day.\n\n“This is a rare opportunity for students and faculty alike to work with a living legend, and we are so honored to host the Strouses,” say MacLeod. “Charles is a wonderful entertainer and person, and I know that this is going to be an evening that students and community will remember for years to come.”\n\nStudents featured in the production participate in the “Musical Theatre Scenes” course on campus and come from a variety of majors and backgrounds. MacLeod is serving as music director and producer for the program, and is co-directing alongside Jay Putnam, assistant professor of theatre and local actor and director Michael Tourek.\n\nCara Hagan, instructor of dance, is choreographing; Matthew Emerson, assistant professor of theatre, is the scenic designer; and Ami Shupe, associate professor of theatre, is creating the costumes. Accompaniment for the event will be provided by Dr. Robert Hallquist, associate professor of music, along with other HPU music faculty."
