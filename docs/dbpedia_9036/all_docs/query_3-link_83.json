        "text": "Almost every single American and countless people around the world have heard the music of composer Charles Strouse. The word “legendary” is not too strong of a word to describe Mr. Strouse and his incredible melodies. An inductee of the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Theatre Hall of Fame, Strouse has written the scores for over 30 stage musicals including 14 for Broadway as well as 5 Hollywood films, 2 Orchestral works and an opera. His songs like “Tomorrow” (from Annie) and “Put On A Happy Face,” and “A Lot of Livin’ To Do” are recognizable in an instant.\n\nHere we find the composer speaking very candidly about his life and what it means to be an artist. The music of Charles Strouse has made a very positive mark on the world and the fact that the greatest performers in recorded music such as Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Tony Bennett, Harry Connick, Jr., Louis Armstrong, Nina Simone, and Duke Ellington have chosen to record and perform his songs is a testament to the quality of his work. One of his greatest songs of his would be “once Upon a Time” which has become something of a standard.\n\nThe music of Charles Strouse will always be heard and his name will forever be among the greatest composers of our time. It’s right here on The Paul Leslie Hour.\n\nSubscribe on any of the these platforms\n\nYou can also stream on Spotify:\n\n• RadioPublic • Stitcher • iTunes • Player FM •\n\n• Overcast • iHEARTRadio • CastBox • Acast •\n\nConsider sharing this interview on Social Media.\n\nLike us on Facebook Follow us on Instagram & Twitter."
