        "text": "It’s a hard knock life for “Annie” composer Charles Strouse who’s locked in a legal battle with his longtime collaborator over rights to Broadway hits like “Bye Bye Birdie” and “Applause.”\n\nStrouse, 88, says in court papers that lyricist Lee Adams, 91, first approached him about selling his rights to “Applause” and “Golden Boy” in 1979.\n\nStrouse paid Lee $52,000 in exchange for the copyright plus other royalties, according to his Manhattan civil suit.\n\nIn 1987 Lee came to Strouse again to cash in on his rights to “Bye Bye Birdie” and received $116,000 from Strouse, the suit says.\n\nNow Lee– using the lawyer who represented the duo in drafting the agreement– has started an arbitration hearing against his former collaborator claiming that he has a renewed interest in the music because ther 1979 and 1987 agreements have expired.\n\nStrouse says the attorney, Alvin Deutsch, should be barred from representing Lee because he has a conflict of interest.\n\nDeutsch did not return messages. Lee declined to comment."
