        "text": "What a great production. Fabulous orchestra, voices were marvelous, costumes ravishing …songs familiar to those of a certain age…Rosie (Ms. Rarick) a knockout and Niko Charney as Albert Peterson were beautifully matched in every way. Bright futures for them. Birdie played by Jacob Dueker was a believable teen idol with a glorious voice. Supporting cast did a fabulous job. Lighting sets, just perfect.\n\nI just came back from the matinee production, which was SUPERB! Astonishingly good direction, choreography, singing, acting, and musical direction. It’s one of the finest things I have seen at MSM!\n\nTerrific production of the much-loved musical. Fantastic direction/choreography by Katie Spelman. Strong voices, solid acting. A joyous 2.5 hours of escapism.\n\nAmazing show! Amazing cast and amazing acting! Kudos to Manhattan School of Music — terrific job!! Highly recommend this show! I’d go again!\n\nThis was an outstanding show! One of the best we have seen, including Broadway musicals!\n\nAMAZING, everything you want in a musical!!!\n\nRun to see it.\n\nAn absolute gem. Do not miss these performances. Cast was wonderful and music and dance fantastic. These students will be on Broadway soon!"
