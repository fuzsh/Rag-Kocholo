        "text": "The King’s College made history this past weekend by producing its first musical, A Pound In Your Pocket. The student-run organization, The King’s Players, has produced one musical in the past, but this is the first time such a production took place under the auspices of the school itself, with most of the creative team headed by professionals, allowing students to get hands-on training from experts in the field. The show itself is also history-making, as it was the New York City premier of the first musical ever written by famed Broadway team Charles Strouse and Lee Adams.\n\nIn 1958, just two years before their first big hit, Bye Bye Birdie, Strouse and Adams had just met and thought they would try adapting a radio play that was based on a Charles Dickens novel (The Old Curiosity Shop) into a musical. This first venture together had a short life in two regional theaters and despite positive reviews, it was buried in the archives once Bye Bye Birdie hit the scene to international acclaim.\n\nNow, six decades since its first two productions, composer Charles Strouse got to see his first musical performed again, with most of the cast made up of students of The King’s College. He shared some of his feelings with the audience during the curtain call on opening night: “This brings back a lot of memories of when I first worked with Lee Adams. I have so many feelings watching this. You all did such a wonderful job! I can’t believe this is a college production–it feels like a professional show!”\n\nChair of the King’s Media, Culture, and the Arts program Dr. Henry Bleattler described the experience of having Charles Strouse at the opening night as “just about the coolest thing imaginable.” He added, “He was so kind and generous–and pleased with our production. That’s something that can only happen in New York City!”\n\nKing’s senior Amanda Dash, who co-produced the show, commented that “producing a Charles Strouse show is an honor in itself, but producing his first show he ever wrote with him in the audience is something even greater.”\n\nStrouse returned for a talk-back with the audience after the Saturday matinee and shared moving comments about the vulnerability of being a composer, despite his success. “It hurts so much when you write something and someone doesn’t like it,” he said. “It’s hard to get over.”\n\nTwenty-five King’s students and alumni had an active role in putting the show together as cast members, design assistants, back stage crew members, props overseers, costume designer and assistants, and media and publicity designers. In the words of director Misti Wills, “the experience of creating A Pound in Your Pocket involved the very best collaboration the theater can offer. From cast to designers to backstage crew, it took a village to create a gorgeous production with excellence.”\n\nLeading lady Abbey Watt, playing the part of Small Servant, added, “Being able to play the role of Small Servant was such a gift. I learned so much about serving out of fear versus serving out of love, and the process of accepting redemption.”\n\nThe show was produced by Chair of the MCA Department Dr. Henry Bleattler, Lecturer of Musical Theater Virginia Hart Pike, and senior Amanda Dash, and was directed by Misti B. Wills with musical direction by Virginia Hart Pike. The creative team included scenic designer April Bartlett, lighting designer Dan Henry, costume designer Kayla Redd (King’s senior), and technical directer Evan Hernandez. The stage manager and assistant stage manager were The King’s Players’ executive team members Shaina Drew and Clara Trombitas. The cast consisted of King’s students Kaleb Batman, Rachel Kyle, Isabelle McCauley, Dorea Slagle, Brittin Ward, King’s alumna Dagmar Wetherill, and two guest artists, Justin Beard and Madison Jordan."
