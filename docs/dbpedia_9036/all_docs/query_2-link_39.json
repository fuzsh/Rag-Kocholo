        "text": "When a major Broadway composer such as Charles Strouse — whose credits include “Annie,” “Bye Bye Birdie” and “Applause” — attempts an original book musical, attention must be paid. But Strouse has overextended himself in undertaking not only the tunes but the lyrics and co-authorship of “You Never Know,” receiving its world preem at Providence’s Trinity Rep. He has created some warm, sophisticated melodies, and the production spotlights a multitalented discovery in leading man Ben Steinfeld. However, show’s book, co-written with playwright Rinne Groff, treads rather inelegantly over familiar showbiz turf with stock characters and illogical actions.\n\nEven a time-tripping doubling of real and fictional characters (think “City of Angels” without the wit) and an ill-fitting flash or two of social significance can’t breathe fresh life into this bittersweet valentine to the art of writing musicals. Where the current trend is to mock musical conventions, “You Never Know” embraces them with a sweet post-modern wink: The classic “I want” song here is called “All I Want Is Not to Want.” The big dance number is about a person who doesn’t want to dance. The ’40s-style dream ballet is done by a couple of rehearsal hall dancers.\n\nClearly the themes of the story are close to Strouse’s heart. Story centers on young songwriter Ben Shapiro (Steinfeld), whose grandfather never quite made it as a Broadway composer. Ben’s dad (Fred Sullivan Jr.) wants his son to follow in his lawyer footsteps and get off the path that ruled his own father’s failed life. But the pull to make music is a powerful one, and young Ben’s just gotta follow his dream. Music, dammit, is important after all.\n\nBen does it by renting a rehearsal room to present a “sing-through” of his grandfather’s unfinished musical about a struggling composer, insecure actress Ashley and her womanizing politico husband. But the turnout for the workshop is dismal. Just one enthusiastic singer, Abby (Haviland Stillwell), shows up, dragging along her own heel of a boyfriend, Paul (Gerritt VanderMeer). In the sing-through-must-go-on tradition, Abby rounds up a few more random participants (an actor waiting for an audition; a security guard).\n\nThe grandfather’s lost musical begins to come to life, with present-day characters finding their fictional counterparts in the 1948 story set in a swanky Miami resort. Rehearsal show morphs into the old boy’s show with parallel themes to his grandson’s professional angst.\n\nBen could be seen as pathetic, delusional or just wimpy, but Steinfeld, a third-year student at Trinity Rep/Brown U.’s consortium, wins the audience over with boyish charm, high energy and charisma to spare. It’s a terrific perf that power-boosts not only a show but also a fledgling career.\n\nStillwell sings well and is plenty plucky, but she is saddled with a confusing character in Abby/Ashley. VanderMeer has the cast’s best voice, but character of Paul is written and played as too transparently sinister.\n\nJay Montgomery as a rehearsal actor, Darryl Semira as a young Hispanic bellboy and Mauro Hantman as the security guard have their moments. But Julio Monge as the elderly version of the bellboy character has an awkward time playing “old,” and his number, “Clean Sweep,” opens the show on less than sure footing.\n\nKelly Crandall and Jason Lacayo are the elegant dancers upstairs who step into the unreality of the musical world and end up in a “dream ballet.”\n\nScript has too many questions for comfort. Lawyer dad has a remarkable act-two turnabout for little reason. A tag-along gal pal for boyfriend Paul doesn’t make any sense, except that her presence is needed in the 1940s musical (though she’s so slyly played by Rachel Warren, you almost buy it); and grandpop’s overall career is a bit of a mystery. (If he’s so little-known, why does he have a cult fan like Abby?)\n\nProduction needs a stern hand to shape up a slew of problems that should have been clarified by opening night.\n\nDirector Amanda Dehnert keeps action brisk and fluid. Designer David Jenkins creates a clever dual-leveled rehearsal hall setting with band and dancers on the second floor while the musical’s action takes place on the lower stage. Christopher d’Amboise delivers several wonderful dance numbers that prove there is great choreographic talent out there waiting for the right project. His “The ‘I-Don’t-Know-How-to-Dance’ Dance” is one of the most delightfully staged numbers seen in ages.\n\nStrouse remains a master of the sophisticated showtune, notably the elegant “Clean Sweep,” the satirical “Charity Party” and the lovely “Ashley,” though latter is hardly the musical payoff it has to be for the composer’s grandson. Strouse’s song “Music,” however, comes straight from the heart and stays with you long after the show.\n\nA few others come up short: “I Don’t Love You Anymore” is a pastiche number for a plummy soprano that feels out of date even in the ’40s milieu. “The Summons You Are Serving,” “Welcome to Washington” and “It’s My Time Now” are marginal songs that inevitably would be cut on the road to Broadway and replaced by better numbers.\n\nModest-size cast and low production demands also could make show attractive, especially with clarifying of the book and the addition of more comedy. More than a brush-up seems needed for big-street prospects, but hey, you never know."
