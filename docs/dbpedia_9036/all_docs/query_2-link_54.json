        "text": "Renowned Broadway composer Charles Strouse visited the campus of The King’s College on October 28, 2014 to conduct a masterclass with musical theater students.\n\nStrouse is best known for Annie and Bye Bye Birdie, among many others; Virginia Pike, a lecturer in music at the College, also serves as Strouse’s musical director. In February 2013, Strouse was recording a demo of a piece that he had written and looking for students to sing. Pike brought three musical theater students from King’s to the project (Ciara Curran ’16, Maggie O’Leary ’14, and Dagmar Wetherill ’15), who worked personally with Strouse throughout the recording. Last spring, Strouse also visited campus to speak to students in a class on musical theater.\n\nStrouse visited campus on October 28 to conduct the masterclass in Pike’s Musical Theater Studio class. The students learned songs he had written, and during the masterclass, four of them performed: Dorea Slagle ’17, Sarah Anderson ’18, Curran, and Wetherill. Strouse gave the students feedback on their performances while the class and other guests from the King’s community observered. “He gave each performer a specific note to work on that would better their future auditions and performances, while still being an encouraging and inspiring mentor,” said Slagle.\n\nWetherill said, “I was so excited when I found out I would be able to sing for Charles again . . . It’s really hard nowadays in the industry to find that type of honesty paired with the kindness and gentleness Charles brings. It was an incredible opportunity to work with someone who has such knowledge and experience and can tell you exactly how the song was and should be sung.”\n\nStrouse’s involvement with King’s has given students the incredible opportunity to learn from an Emmy and Tony-winning composer. “There is always a place for Charles Strouse at The King’s College,” said Dr. Harry Bleattler, Chair of the program in Media, Culture, and the Arts.\n\nGiven Strouse’s stature and deep involvement in theater world, the time he has taken to invest in students at King’s is highly valuable. Says Bleattler, “This is one of those unique opportunities that going to school in New York City allows. We are so grateful to Mr. Strouse for making himself available and giving our students access to his talent.”"
