I'm Terry Gross.\n\nThe songs from the Broadway musicals \"Bye, Bye Birdie,\" \"Annie,\" \"Applause\"\n\nand \"All American\" were composed by my guest, Charles Strouse. Some of his\n\ngreat but lesser-known songs will be revived later this month in a new\n\nproduction of his 1964 musical \"Golden Boy.\" It's part of the City Center\n\nEncore Series \"Great American Musicals in Concert.\" \"Golden Boy\" is based on\n\nthe 1937 play of the same name by Clifford Odets, who was also one of the\n\nwriters of the musical adaptation. The 1964 musical starred Sammy Davis Jr.\n\nas a young man who breaks out of Harlem by becoming a prize fighter. It was\n\ndirected by Arthur Penn, who went on to direct to the movie \"Bonnie and\n\nClyde.\"\n\nWe invited Charles Strouse to talk with us about the original Broadway\n\nproduction of \"Golden Boy.\" Let's start with one of the songs from the show,\n\n\"Night Song,\" sung by Sammy Davis. The lyricist is Lee Adams, who had also\n\ncollaborated with Charles Strouse on the 1960 musical \"Bye, Bye Birdie.\"\n\n(Soundbite of \"Night Song\")\n\nMr. SAMMY DAVIS Jr.: (Singing) Summer, not a bit of breeze. Neon signs are\n\nshining through the tired trees. Lovers walking to and fro, everyone has\n\nsomeone and a place to go. Listen, hear the cars go past. They don't even\n\nsee me flying by so fast. They are moving, going who knows where. Only thing\n\nI know is I'm not going there. Where do you go when you feel that your brain\n\nis on fire? Where do you go when you don't even know what it is you desire?\n\nListen, laughter everywhere...\n\nGROSS: Charles Strouse, welcome back to FRESH AIR. Is there a story behind\n\nwriting \"Night Song\"?\n\nMr. CHARLES STROUSE (Composer): A very intimate story, and that is I remember\n\nlying on the grass in the park looking up at the skyline in New York, saying,\n\n`I wish I could be there and I wish I had some friends.'\n\nGROSS: Wish you could be where?\n\nMr. STROUSE: Oh, way up on top.\n\nGROSS: Oh. So you were yearning while writing this song about yearning.\n\nMr. STROUSE: I was yearning, and I was remembering that period of my life\n\nvery strongly.\n\nGROSS: How were you first brought in to do the music for \"Golden Boy\"?\n\nMr. STROUSE: Well, it's really because of the producer, a man by the name of\n\nHillard Elkins, who was a real operator, and he somehow got Sammy Davis to\n\nagree to do it if Clifford Odets did it. And then he called Clifford and\n\nsaid, `Would you do it as a musical if Sammy Davis did it?' And then he\n\ncalled us and said, `Would you do it if Clifford Odets and Sammy Davis did\n\nit?' And we all said, `Gee, that would be great if, if, if.' And he was able\n\nto, in the manner of agents and producers, convince everybody that it was\n\ngoing to happen, and it did happen. Sammy also was very, very interested in\n\nbecoming a serious actor and had the build and the drawing power for this\n\nrole. It's always been a great star vehicle. And Sammy agreed to do it.\n\nBecause he was such a highly paid star, he did something which is very\n\nunusual. I don't know whether I would have accepted it today, but that is he\n\nmaintained legal approvals of every word and every note of music. And...\n\nGROSS: Wow. So you had to play all your music for Sammy Davis Jr. and get\n\nhis approval.\n\nMr. STROUSE: That's right. It was a strange part of my life. We followed\n\nhim all over the country, mainly Las Vegas, and would play songs for him after\n\nhis nightclub act and early in the morning after his golf game. And it was an\n\nunusual--yeah, I know. It was an unusual voyage for us, and not easy, because\n\nwe were on the road for almost six months, and a lot of changes. But I get\n\nahead of myself.\n\nGROSS: Well, let's get back to that in a moment, but first, again, in terms\n\nof how you were chosen, I wouldn't have thought that the first choice would\n\nbe, `Well, let's see, we're doing a musical about an African-American boxer,\n\nso let's get those guys who wrote the musical about the suburban teen-agers,\n\n\"Bye, Bye Birdie.\"'\n\nMr. STROUSE: Yeah, `Who are white.' Yeah. No, I think part of it was that,\n\nthat \"Birdie\" was a rock 'n' roll-based musical, the first one really, we\n\nlike to think, although it has, you know, a typical Broadway score in many\n\nother ways. But it was a rock 'n' roll show. So this sense of understanding\n\ncontemporary pop idioms would fall to us, in a way. And we were a little hot\n\nthen, and also we knew the producer; that helped. I think we were a good\n\nchoice, and for that reason, most of the other guys writing around that time\n\nwere not writing jazz as good as, say, Jerry Bach(ph) as a contemporary of\n\nmine, or John Kander. They were not jazz writers, whereas my background was\n\nin that, and my further background was as a piano player. I played for a lot\n\nof African-American acts and toured in the South and that kind of thing. So\n\nit was in my background. I think we were logical.\n\nGROSS: The musical \"Golden Boy\" is based on a 1937 Clifford Odets play.\n\nClifford Odets rewrote the play for the musical in the '60s. What was the\n\noriginal Clifford Odets story?\n\nMr. STROUSE: The original Clifford Odets story was about a poor Italian\n\nfamily during the Depression, and the young man, who had a career as an artist\n\nof some sort--he was a violinist, actually, in the original play--sacrifices\n\nthat to become a boxer, which is a source of income available to young\n\nathletes today. And then it was originally called \"The Manly Art,\"(ph) and it\n\nwas written by Clifford to actually save the finances of the group theater.\n\nHe wrote it quickly, great feverish, three, four weeks, and it became an\n\ninstant success and subsequently made stars of many people who played the\n\nrole, like William Holden, John Garfield in a revival. The thing that held\n\ntrue for a white athlete during the Depression held doubly true to us for a\n\nblack athlete today because, as we all know, many black athletes sacrificed\n\ntheir lives for those few years of giving their bodies to sport. And it was\n\nthat aspect of it that appealed to us, and obviously it appealed to Sammy\n\nDavis, too, who was one of the few people who was as dextrous and physical\n\nand, of course, sang as well as he did.\n\nGROSS: So the idea of an Italian young man who forsakes his love for violin\n\nin order to become a boxer is changed to the idea of an African-American in\n\nthe 1964 production.\n\nMr. STROUSE: That's correct.\n\nGROSS: And what does he forsake to become a boxer?\n\nMr. STROUSE: Well, you're touching on some of the inside stories. Sammy used\n\nto say--he would open the play as forsaking surgery only to find out that he\n\nwas forsaking piano the next night only to find out he wasn't forsaking\n\nanything except the love of his father. It got to be less of a raison d'etre\n\nwith a black performer giving up something than just the fact that he went\n\ninto this brutal world when his father was a very gentle man. And we felt\n\nthat the back story was that he gave up college, he gave up an education.\n\nGROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Charles Strouse, and his\n\nBroadway musicals include \"Bye, Bye Birdie\" and \"Annie.\" In 1964 he wrote the\n\nmusic for the songs for the musical \"Golden Boy,\" which starred Sammy Davis\n\nJr. Now that musical is being revived by City Center Encores later this month\n\nin New York.\n\nLet's play a song from the original cast production with Sammy Davis singing.\n\nAnd this is a song called \"I Want to be With You.\" Sammy Davis Jr., as the\n\nboxer, falls in love with a white woman in the 1964 version of \"Golden Boy.\"\n\nI'd like you to describe the context that the song is performed in the musical.\n\nMr. STROUSE: This particular scene, when they sing \"I Want to be With You,\"\n\ncaused us to receive a lot of venomous mail, particularly in Philadelphia,\n\nwhere we opened. As a matter of fact, after the show opened, Lee Adams and I\n\nhad to have bodyguards actually walk us to the hotel. We didn't think it was\n\nanything much. We just thought it was two people. I mean, we were aware one\n\nwas black and one was white, but we didn't think it would arouse people so.\n\nAnd this song, for me and Lee, was a particularly interesting one. Because I\n\nhave a serious music background, and yet I've played in jazz groups, and jazz\n\nis part of my nature, I tried very hard in this to combine any depth that I\n\nmight have as a composer with a feeling for jazz, and I felt in a certain way\n\nthat I had succeeded. I'm very proud of this song. But it was also because\n\nit was not only a passionate moment in the play, but I was aware it was a\n\npassionate moment where the lovers themselves, a la Romeo and Juliet, were\n\nreally leaping over a great hurdle. They weren't aware of it, or they were--I\n\nmean, nobody talks about that kind of thing in one way, but they leaped this\n\nhurdle, and so the song was a very important one for me where they were both\n\nfinally able to express their passion, as two people, for each other.\n\nGROSS: Well, let's hear the first part of this song, and this is Sammy Davis\n\nJr. from the original cast recording of \"Golden Boy.\"\n\n(Soundbite of \"I Want to be With You\")\n\nMr. DAVIS: (Singing) Lana, Lana and Joe, somehow it sounds so right. Somehow\n\nyou feel what I feel, too. I want to be with you. I want to be with you. I\n\nwant to be with you. After all the nights of wanting you, lying there loving\n\nyou, hating you, tonight I'm touching you, holding you. World, you're going\n\nto see, we'll make out somehow. Here's my girl and me. They can't hurt us\n\nnow. We're gonna have it all. I'll love you every day. Lana, life can be so\n\ngreat for us. Here's our chance, it's not too late for us. Grab it fast, or\n\nlife won't wait for us. I want to be with you.\n\nGROSS: Sammy Davis Jr. from the original cast recording of \"Golden Boy\" with\n\nmusic composed by my guest, Charles Strouse, lyrics by Lee Adams. And this\n\nmusical's being revived in New York later this month by City Center Encore.\n\nDid you get a sense of what it was like for Sammy Davis to be the subject of\n\ncontroversy in real life because he was married to Mai Britt, a white woman,\n\nand to, at the same time, be the subject of controversy because he was\n\nportraying on stage a black man in love with a white woman? You know, because\n\nit..\n\nMr. STROUSE: I...\n\nGROSS: Because it was going on in both, you know, in his stage life and his\n\nreal life.\n\nMr. STROUSE: Sure. I did have a real sense, particularly towards the end of\n\nour run after--no, it was before he went to London with the show. We both\n\nmarched in Selma, and I think we were both drunk and we kind of got to know\n\none another. I learned a lot about Sammy and his time in the US Army where he\n\nwas pummeled and other soldiers urinated on him. He had in him a great, great\n\ndeal of suffering, and he turned whatever hurt or anger into a desire, an\n\nintense desire, to be loved by everybody. And yet part of him also wanted to\n\nbe in that white world. It was a very--he was a most complex man.\n\nGROSS: My guest is composer Charles Strouse. His 1964 musical \"Golden Boy\"\n\nis being revived later this month in Manhattan. More after a break. This is\n\nFRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: The City Center Encore Series is reviving the 1964 musical \"Golden\n\nBoy\" later this month in Manhattan. My guest, Charles Strouse, wrote the\n\nmusic for the show. The original production stars Sammy Davis Jr. as a prize\n\nfighter from Harlem.\n\nSammy Davis Jr. was a club singer predominantly, you know, a recording artist\n\nand nightclub singer. And usually the kind of singing on Broadway,\n\nparticularly in the era before microphones were commonly used, the style on\n\nBroadway was an almost more classical style of singing where you're singing in\n\na big enough voice to fill the hall and, you know, there's more attention to\n\ndiction than a lot of nightclub singers might have and probably fewer\n\nliberties are taken because everything is much more choreographed and\n\norchestrated. Was there ever a tug-of-war between you and Sammy Davis Jr.\n\nabout the style that he should sing your songs in for the show?\n\nMr. STROUSE: Yes. Yes, there was. First of all, you're not right about the\n\namplification. They had these body mics then, and Sammy always used that.\n\nBut he did have the diction, he did have the strength, he did have the\n\nstamina. But we did have a tug-of-war, which I lost. In fact, the song you\n\nplayed there are a lot curls added to the line, and for...\n\nGROSS: Added by him?\n\nMr. STROUSE: By him, yeah. And I was quite serious, and maybe too serious,\n\nbecause my background is jazz, as well as serious music. But we did have a\n\ntug-of-war, and one which I can say I lost.\n\nGROSS: I'd like to hear what it was like when you had to follow Sammy Davis\n\nJr. around Vegas playing him demos of your new songs so he could give them his\n\napproval.\n\nMr. STROUSE: Well, we played the songs, and invariably Sammy was late. Lee\n\nAdams, in particular, was not a late owl, and he would say, `I'll meet you\n\nafter the show at 1 in the morning.' And we would be lucky sometimes if he\n\ngot there at 2:30, and then we would play the songs in front of the chorus\n\ngirls. He was constantly partying, Sammy. He smoked and drank, and he was\n\nalways partying. And we would play these songs in that atmosphere all the\n\ntime. And I must tell you, at that point in our lives, we were very timid,\n\nparticularly me, and I was the one that was playing it and seeing him. So we\n\ndid that, we met him at odd hours. Sometimes, I think I said at the\n\nbeginning, you know, after the shows he would go out and play eight, nine\n\nholes of golf or something, and then we would meet him in the steam room to\n\ndiscuss a scene.\n\nAnd the first time I met Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin and that whole bunch--i\n\nthink Joey Bishop was there too--we were all naked, which is an odd thing to\n\nadd to my composer's resume, but there were all kinds of odd incidents like\n\nthat.\n\nGROSS: So when you first met Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin and all those guys\n\nnaked in a steam room, were you also expected to demo your songs for Sammy\n\nDavis?\n\nMr. STROUSE: No, no. That was--this would be a part of Sammy that's typical\n\nof him, probably; partially meaningless to anybody else. He brought me down\n\nthere, he said he wanted to see me for a conference, and I remember one of the\n\nthings--you know, we all introduced ourselves around. Believe me, I was not\n\nas proud of my physique as they of theirs. And so I was--and he said, `This\n\nis my composer, Charles Strouse.' `Oh, hi, Charlie,' you know, `da, da, da,\n\nda, da.' And it was basically, in my opinion, looking back, that he wanted to\n\nshow them that he had a composer, a Broadway composer who had written \"Bye,\n\nBye Birdie\" that was his composer. And I remember asking him later, `I don't\n\nsay this is my actor, Sammy. Why do you say, \"This is my composer?\"' And\n\nthat was one of the times that he didn't argue the point with me, but I think\n\nhe saw the emptiness of having me down there, although, by the way, it's\n\nalways made an amusing story, and a true one. But that was the reason. No, I\n\ndidn't play a song in the steam room. We talked over a few things in the\n\nscene and one of the songs, you know, where he said, `I think that chorus\n\ncould be cut,' or `This could be longer,' but it was basically a kind of--his\n\nday in the sauna with the guys and, you know, I was the drop-in guest.\n\nGROSS: Composer Charles Strouse. His 1964 musical \"Golden Boy\" will be\n\nrevived March 21st through 24th as part of the City Center Encore Series in\n\nManhattan. Strouse will be back in the second half of the show. I'm Terry\n\nGross, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Credits)\n\nGROSS: Coming up, more with Charles Strouse about his musical \"Golden Boy.\"\n\nIt will be revived later this month. And Kevin Whitehead reviews a new\n\nreissue of the Ornette Coleman Trio recorded in 1965 at the Golden Circle Club\n\nin Stockholm.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with composer Charles\n\nStrouse. He wrote the songs for the musicals \"Bye Bye Birdie,\" \"Annie,\"\n\n\"Applause\" and \"All American.\" His 1964 musical, \"Golden Boy,\" is being\n\nrevived in a concert version later this month by the City Center Encore Series\n\nin Manhattan. The lyrics for the show's songs are by Lee Adams, who also\n\ncollaborated with Strouse on \"Bye Bye Birdie.\" The original production of\n\n\"Golden Boy\" starred Sammy Davis Jr. as a young man who works his way out of\n\nHarlem by becoming a prize fighter.\n\nLet's hear another song from \"Golden Boy,\" and this is called \"This Is The\n\nLife,\" and Billy Daniels sings it, and then it ends in a duet with Sammy Davis\n\nand Billy Daniels. Would you talk about writing the song and where it fits\n\ninto the show?\n\nMr. STROUSE: Well, in the original play, there was a character, he was a kind\n\nof gangster power-type character who was able to do the fighter Joe, Sammy,\n\nthe favors to get him into the elite world, get him the top fights and show\n\nhim a little money and power. It was originally played, by the way, in the\n\noriginal production, by Elia Kazan, and in this version, which was\n\nmusicalized, Billy Daniels was just perfect for the part. In the song, he\n\ntakes him to the High Life(ph) and introduces Joe Wellington, Sammy Davis, to\n\nthe High Life.\n\nGROSS: \"This Is The Life\" from the original cast recording of \"Golden Boy,\"\n\nand this song features Billy Daniels and Sammy Davis.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Golden Boy\" cast recording)\n\nMr. BILLY DANIELS: I live good. Come with me, Joe. Yes? No? Maybe?\n\nMr. SAMMY DAVIS Jr.: Show me.\n\nMr. DANIELS: Be my guest. (Singing) This is the life. Here's where the\n\nliving is. This is the life. Baby, you're there. This is the life. You've\n\nwaited long enough. Man, you've arrived. Breathe in that air. Autumn\n\nperfume, silver and candlelight. Children make way, Joe's here to stay. Come\n\njoin the club. Hear that sweet music start. This is the life, sweetheart.\n\nDon't be a square, Joe. Tell them bye-bye, get where the action is. Come\n\nhave some fun. I'll lead the way. This is the life, they've kept you in a\n\nbox. Break down the walls, come out and play. See all the lights, they're\n\nspelling Wellington. How sweet the song. Now you belong. Above the heap,\n\nthat's how it's got to be. This is the life, you'll see.\n\nMr. DAVIS: Can I be what I want to be?\n\nChorus: Yes, you can.\n\nMr. DAVIS: Can I get what I want to get?\n\nChorus: Yes, you can.\n\nMr. DAVIS: Can I have a car with a built-in bar?\n\nChorus: Color TV and a Playboy tee.\n\nMr. DAVIS: And a hundred shares of AT&T.\n\nChorus: Yes, you can.

Now you mentioned that\n\nSammy Davis had to approve all the songs. Did he like this one? Do you\n\nremember?\n\nMr. STROUSE: Yes, although what I do remember is another thing, and that is\n\nat the end of the song, I had carefully constructed what I thought was a very\n\nclever canon. That is an invitation. It's note quite a fugue, but it's an\n\ninvitation; one person sings one thing, another thing overlaps that, and then\n\nthe first thing comes in under that, and I couldn't wait to hear that. And\n\nboth Sammy and Billy were too impatient, as the kind of entertainers they\n\nwere, to learn it, and they just kind of jammed it at the end, and I suppose\n\nit worked. I always felt a little bit disappointed, because I had done a\n\nclever thing and it just sounded now like a write-out of some sort. I\n\nremember that, but that was the kind of--both disappointment and maybe\n\nimprovement--I don't know--that was made in the show all the time that--you\n\nknow, you get into the subject of how do you write a musical? You don't write\n\nthem. They're kind of invented sometimes, sometimes by the people who should\n\ninvent them and sometimes by a performer whose personality properly overwhelms\n\nthe material. It's sometimes a hard decision for me to make.\n\nGROSS: My guest is composer Charles Strouse. His 1964 musical, \"Golden Boy,\"\n\nis being revived later this month in Manhattan. We'll talk more after a\n\nbreak. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: The City Center Encore Series is reviving the 1964 musical \"Golden\n\nBoy\" later this month in Manhattan. My guest, Charles Strause, wrote the\n\nmusic for the show. The original production starred Sammy Davis Jr. as a\n\nprize fighter from Harlem.\n\nNow one of the things you had to do, writing the songs for \"Golden Boy,\" was\n\nto write songs about being black, to write songs about growing up in Harlem.\n\nDid you feel at all like in an uncomfortable position writing about that? Not\n\nthat you knew what it was like to be a teen-age girl who was on the telephone\n\nall the time, like in \"Bye Bye Birdie,\" so it's not like you were used to\n\nwriting from your personal experience. But this, I imagine, had certain\n\nchallenges.\n\nMr. STROUSE: It did, and, yet, I would say loneliness and poverty was not out\n\nof my life, particularly. And I had, as I started to mention before,\n\nworked--when I got out of college, I was one of the, you know, white piano\n\nplayers who could read music and had played jazz. I played in jazz groups.\n\nSo I ended up accompanying a lot of African-American performers in the South.\n\nI worked with Butterfly McQueen for about five months touring the South, and a\n\nwoman by the name of Sally Blair, a wonderful singer whose career just\n\nstopped. I don't know. And many others. And had, in my touring with them in\n\nthe South, been spat upon and called `Nigger lover,' refused accommodations in\n\nany hotel. So I had a pretty good identification. Also, I'm a product of New\n\nYork City public schools, although they were not heavily black. I had friends\n\nand, as I say, played in jazz groups.\n\nSo, no, it wasn't. I was lonely and I can remember sitting in Central Park\n\nlooking up at the Essex House and feeling `the world's going on without me and\n\nI don't have anybody,' and we wrote a song like that called \"Night Song\" for\n\nSammy, and I'm proud to say that some black friends, you know, have said to\n\nme, `You know, we really caught a feeling there of being lonesome on a\n\ntenement fire escape in Harlem.' I was very aware of it. So, no, I did not\n\nfeel uncomfortable in that respect. The music for \"Don't Forget 127th\n\nStreet,\" which has a very clever lyric by Lee, and very satirical about\n\nHarlem, I always felt, just between you and me, a little self-conscious that\n\nthe music I wrote for it was a little bit ricky-ticky white. And every time I\n\nhear it, I get a slight feeling going through me that it wasn't down enough in\n\nsome way. But that's me. It happens to be a very successful number in the\n\nshow, so the answer is no.\n\nGROSS: Well, it's one that several critics picked as among the best songs in\n\nthe show.\n\nMr. STROUSE: It's very successful commercially, and lyrically, and, I guess,\n\nmusically, at this point. This is something that's deep in me, as a composer,\n\nand maybe I couldn't have done it--anyway, that's what it is. But, as I say,\n\nother times, in all the other songs, I tried very, very strongly to be a black\n\ncomposer. I was very conscious of what it meant to be; though I didn't, you\n\nknow, experience the whip lashes.\n\nGROSS: Why don't we hear a minute of \"Don't Forget 127th Street,\" the song\n\nthat you were saying you're very self-conscious about now, so I hope I'm not\n\nmaking you too self-conscious.\n\nMr. STROUSE: A little self-conscious, not very. I mean, I just felt as\n\nthough that it was not as black as I could have made it.\n\nGROSS: OK. Here it goes.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Don't Forget 127th Street\")\n\nUnidentified Man #1: And when you're downtown sipping champagne with your\n\nhigh-class white friends, don't forget this glorious environment which molded\n\nyour character. Don't forget your roots.\n\n(Singing) Don't forget 127th Street.\n\nChorus: Don't forget your happy Harlem home. Don't forget 127th Street.\n\nUnidentified Man #1: (Singing) Nosiree, there's no slum like your own.\n\nUnidentified Man #2: (Singing) I remember winter evenings at that window,\n\nwatching those evictions in the snow.\n\nChorus: Oh, no, Joe, don't forget 127th Street...\n\nUnidentified Man #1: A little bit of heaven.\n\nChorus: ...wherever you may go.\n\nUnidentified Man #1: (Singing) Don't forget the cultural life on this here\n\nstreet.\n\nChorus: Richer than the outside world suspects.\n\nGROSS: It's \"Don't Forget 127th Street\" from the original cast recording of\n\n\"Golden Boy.\" My guest is the composer of the songs, Charles Strouse. Well,\n\nI like the song a lot, but I know what you mean. It sounds much more Broadway\n\nthan it sounds Harlem.\n\nMr. STROUSE: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nGROSS: And...\n\nMr. STROUSE: That was my feeling, but it was an instantaneous success, in\n\nspite of the fact it was one of the few songs that Clifford Odets and Lee and\n\nI argued about, because the play is extremely serious and sad because it's\n\nwhen Joe decides to become a career boxer, and he's going to go away on a road\n\ntour, and his father has just chastised him very, very severely, begged him\n\nnot to go, and so Joe is carrying this guilt about going against his father,\n\nwhom he reveres. And Clifford Odets said to us, `Look, you can't have a man\n\ntap dance right after that.' So he wanted the song out of the show, and we,\n\nof course, agreed. I mean, he was Clifford Odets, and it was Sammy who\n\ninsisted on that song, and it was a great, great show-stopper, and Sammy does,\n\nindeed, tap-dance...\n\nGROSS: Right, right.\n\nMr. STROUSE: ...and dances, and so the rules about musicals are made to be\n\nbroken.\n\nGROSS: Clifford Odets, who wrote \"Golden Boy,\" he wrote the original 1937\n\nplay and wrote the book for the musical, he died before--well, he died in the\n\nearly stages of the musical's production. What impact did it have on the show\n\nto have Odets die?\n\nMr. STROUSE: At the beginning, we thought it would have no effect, aside\n\nfrom the sadness we all felt. We were very close to Clifford. But as it\n\nturned out, Sammy, along the way, fired the director, and new playwrights were\n\nbrought in, and the one that was settled on was Bill Gibson, the noted\n\nAmerican playwright. Arthur Penn was brought in as director, and two shows\n\nwere now combined into one, and it was very difficult. We were playing two\n\nshows at one time, even though we were always sold out.\n\nGROSS: The Odets show and the Gibson show.\n\nMr. STROUSE: That's right. And they were totally different, and we kept the\n\nsame characters, but they were two different plays. People would enter and\n\nnever to appear again. Songs were reprised that were never heard before. To\n\nwork all of this out was very laborious and very expensive.\n\nGROSS: What are your memories of opening night on Broadway?\n\nMr. STROUSE: I was so frightened that I--this is a truth I don't like to\n\ntell. I said hello to Sammy, and hello to everybody, and wished them luck,\n\nand I went home and I bathed one of my children and had a chicken sandwich. I\n\nremember it quite well. Then, when I went back to the theater at the end of\n\nthe show, I lost all my telegrams. I had a bunch of telegrams from friends,\n\nand lost them. And I went through the garbage with my wife in the back of the\n\nMajestic Theater in the alley and never found them.\n\nGROSS: Why did you go home while the play was on? Why didn't you stay in the\n\ntheater?\n\nMr. STROUSE: I was scared--quick answer. I'm always scared. I'm getting\n\nover that.\n\nGROSS: What were the reviews like?\n\nMr. STROUSE: The reviews were very good. They were very good, particularly\n\nfor the book, I would say. That's my recollection. The show was a success,\n\nran for two years, and--which is considered a successful run, and then it\n\nplayed in London for, I think, a year and a half.\n\nGROSS: Will you go to the opening night of the revival of \"Golden Boy\" or are\n\nyou going to be...\n\nMr. STROUSE: Oh, yes. Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...being a chicken at home eating chicken?\n\nMr. STROUSE: Well put. Yes. No, I'm a different man.\n\nGROSS: You can take it?\n\nMr. STROUSE: I can take it.\n\nGROSS: Well, I can't let you go without asking this: Jay-Z, the rapper, had\n\na recording called \"Hard Knock Life,\" which used part of the song from \"Annie\"\n\nin it...\n\nMr. STROUSE: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: ...on his CD, \"Ghetto Anthem,\" which no one would think of any song\n\nfrom Annie as being part of a ghetto anthem, so that CD won 1999's Grammy for\n\nbest rap album. How did you find out that \"Hard Knock Life\" was going to be\n\nsampled for a rap record?\n\nMr. STROUSE: I found it out just through hearing it and my publisher. But\n\nI'll tell you something, he said something--I never met Jay-Z or, as Andrew\n\nLloyd Webber said in a phone call to me, he said, `Jay Zed recorded a song of\n\nyours.' I thought that was wonderful. And I dropped in Andrew's name, too.\n\nHe said something in the liner notes that he--it was gritty. He said it was\n\ngritty, and he felt that that was the way black people felt in the ghetto.\n\nAnd the fact is when we were working on \"Annie,\" it was the first song that I\n\nhad written the music for. Martin and I had never gotten--Martin Charnin and\n\nI had never gotten together. That was--we were old friends, but that was the\n\nfirst song we wrote, and I wanted that song to be gritty. I didn't want it to\n\nbe a fake. I wanted it to show these desperate times and these maltreated\n\ngirls, etc., etc.\n\nSo when he picked up on that, I was very proud of myself for that reason,\n\nalone. And he did use just about the whole song, so--but then it comes\n\nin--there's always a rap beat underneath, and then he comes in with some\n\nthings, which even though it went platinum four times--it was the biggest\n\nselling recording--single recording I ever had, I still don't understand what\n\nhe's saying or anything. It's a--well, it's interesting and it bothers me in\n\na way.\n\nI saw a rap retrospective just the other night on television where a lot of\n\nthe rappers spoke about what they were doing in these songs, and I didn't\n\nunderstand a great deal of what they were saying. I mean that, not as a joke,\n\nI just didn't understand the words, the diction, even when they were speaking.\n\nAnd I thought, `God is this--are we going to two different worlds?' And I\n\nguess the answer is, `Yes, we are.'\n\nGROSS: OK. One other \"Annie\" question. Did you ever think that the third\n\n\"Annie,\" Sarah Jessica Parker, would be Ms. \"Sex and the City\"?\n\nMr. STROUSE: No. Never.\n\nGROSS: Were you surprised to...\n\nMr. STROUSE: Never.\n\nGROSS: ...see her develop into that?\n\nMr. STROUSE: I knew Sarah Jessica when she was nine, before \"Annie,\" she was\n\nin a revue of mine at the Manhattan Theatre Club called \"By Strouse,\" and she\n\nwas nine years old, and then I brought her into \"Annie,\" and no. That's about\n\nas unlikely occurrence as--and you can fill in that blank. I don't know.\n\nGROSS: Well, Charles Strouse, good luck with the revival of \"Golden Boy.\"\n\nThank you so much...\n\nMr. STROUSE: Thank you.\n\nGROSS: ...for talking with us.\n\nMr. STROUSE: My pleasure, Terry.\n\nGROSS: Composer Charles Strouse. His 1964 musical, \"Golden Boy,\" will be\n\nrevived March 21st through 24th as part of the City Center Encore Series in\n\nManhattan.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Hard Knock Life\")\n\nMr. JAY-Z (Rapper): (Rapping) Take the bass line out.

During that time, he presented some chamber\n\nmusic in concert near London, the trio recorded the music to a French film and\n\nplayed in the clubs, concert halls and radio studios of several nations,\n\nincluding two weeks at the Golden Circle Club in Stockholm. Two volumes of\n\nrecordings they made at the Golden Circle are now on CD with over an hour of\n\nextra music. Jazz critic Kevin Whitehead says this is Ornette even skeptics\n\ncould love.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nKEVIN WHITEHEAD reporting:\n\nOrnette Coleman's \"European Echoes,\" a playful impression of an oompah band\n\nechoing across a town square. Folks have accused Coleman of breaking the\n\nrules of jazz, but he just bends them a bit. In many ways he's as traditional\n\nas Louis Armstrong or Charlie Parker. He loves a crying, bluesy sound, a\n\ncatchy improvised melody and a swinging rhythm section, and he radiates the\n\nsame kind of happy confidence. His 1965 Stockholm recordings are Exhibit A.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nWHITEHEAD: Ornette's earlier bands could ramble in a good way but this trio\n\nbarrels straight ahead. They were recorded at the end of two weeks at the\n\nGolden Circle Club and sound telepathically tight, even if bassist David\n\nIzenzon and drummer Charles Moffett didn't always get along. One was a\n\npractical joker, and the other trusting and gullible. Izenzon has excellent\n\ntiming and is handy with a bow, but the heart of the band is drummer Moffett,\n\nan old friend of Ornette's who'd played with him in rhythm-and-blues bands\n\nback home in Texas.\n\n(Soundbite of Ornette Coleman's \"Doughnuts\")\n\nWHITEHEAD: Ornette Coleman's \"Doughnuts.\" He could always write a nice tune,\n\nbut some of the trio pieces focus more on strong rhythm patterns and a flowing\n\nmelody line. Such numbers gave the drummer an even more pivotal role than\n\nusual, and Moffett rises to it, steering the group by playing thematic\n\nvariations on a snare drum. He and Ornette are so attuned to each other, they\n\naffect each other's breathing.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nWHITEHEAD: The Stockholm version of \"Doughnuts\" is released for the first\n\ntime in a new expanded version, the Golden Circle reports. The music we've\n\nheard so far comes from Volume I, which has a slight edge over Volume II.\n\nThat one has a piece showcasing Ornette's casual violin and trumpet; no\n\ncompetition for his saxophone. But either volume boasts over a half-hour of\n\nworthy bonus material, mostly alternate takes on a par with the original\n\nmasters. Ornette moved to Europe in 1965 because nothing much was happening\n\nfor him in New York. But when he came home in '66 he got something like a\n\nhero's welcome. The difference was, while he was away, these records had come\n\nout. They showed anyone with ears how good the trio was; also, how good it\n\nis, because this music sounds as fresh now as it did then.\n\nGROSS: Kevin Whitehead is a jazz critic based in Chicago. He reviewed the\n\n\"Ornette Coleman Trio at the Golden Circle, Volumes I & II\" on Blue Note. I'm\n\nTerry Gross.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\n(Credits)\n\nGROSS: On the next FRESH AIR, Ridley Scott. He's nominated for an Oscar for\n\ndirecting \"Black Hawk Down.\" And we talk with British journalist Martin\n\nMeredith, author of a new book about Zimbabwe's dictator Robert Mugabe.\n\nZimbabwe's presidential election is later this week."
