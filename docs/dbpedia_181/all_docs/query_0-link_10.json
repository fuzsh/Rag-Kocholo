        "text": "Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyse large amounts of natural language data. The goal is a computer capable of \"understanding\" the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them.NLP combines computational linguistics—rule-based modelling of human language—with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to ‘understand’ its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer’s intent and sentiment. Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation. This paper discusses on the various scope and challenges , current trends and future scopes of Natural Language Processing.\n\nAbstract — Natural language processing emerges as one of the hottest topic in field of Speech and language technology. Also Machine learning can comprehend how to perform important NLP tasks. This is often achievable and cost-effective where manual programming is not. This paper strives to Study NLP and ML and gives insights into the essential characteristics of both. It summarizes common NLP tasks in this comprehensive field, then provides a brief description of common machine learning approaches that are being used for different NLP tasks. Also this paper presents a review on various approaches to NLP and some related topics to NLP and ML. Keywords- Natural Language Processing, Machine learning, NLP, Ml. International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security (IJCSIS), Vol. 13, No. 9, September 2015 https://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/ ISSN 1947-5500\n\nThe seventeenth International Conference on Natural Language Processing (ICON-2020) will be held at IIT Patna, India during ​ December 18-21, 2020​ . The ICON Conference series is a forum for promoting interaction among researchers in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics (CL) in India and abroad. The main conference is on December 19-20, 2020​ . This will be preceded by one day of pre-conference tutorials on December 18, 2020,​ and one day of post-conference workshops on ​ December 21, 2020. Papers in ICON proceedings will be indexed in ACL Anthology. ACL Anthology is a digital archive of research papers in Computational Linguistics for major international conferences under the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), which is one of the most well-known associations for NLP and CL. The previous proceedings of ICON 2014, ICON 2015 and ICON 2016 can be found in ACL Anthology.\n\nThe most important reasons for examining “non-standard data” with CL methods are the facts that this data represents a great deal of language behavior and that it serves as an object of scientific study in linguistics as a whole. This is true of the syntax of non-native second-language learners, the accents of non-native speakers, and the vocabularies of different dialect speakers. Computational linguists have a good deal to offer to the various subfields of linguistics studying non-standard data. By automating steps in analysis we make the analyses replicable and also modifiable, we improve opportunities for comparing similar analyses, and perhaps most importantly, we enable the analyses of large amounts of data, providing more comprehensive views. The data itself can be tricky to work with, however, as scientists in other fields are often specialized in a single language or language pair, which means that their data will not be varied enough to support all the research questions o...\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence and getting lot of focus on research and development due to emergence of its applications. The research areas in focus are conversation systems, Language processing, Machine Translation, Deep learning. The researches in these areas lead to development of many tools to build industrial applications. Combining Deep Learning techniques with Natural Language Processing is finding lot of applications in domains such as Healthcare, Finance, Manufacturing, Education, Retail and customer service. This paper provides bird's view of advancement in research, development and application areas of Natural Language Processing. This paper captures21research focus areas, 22 development tools and 6 domains where Natural Language Processing are making rapid advancements.\n\nSemi-Automatic Framework for Generating RDF Dataset from Open Data -- Design for a Listening Learner Corpus for a Listenability Measurement Method -- The Effect of Automatic Tagging using Multilingual Metadata for Image Retrieval -- The NECTEC 2015 Thai Open-Domain Automatic Speech Recognition System -- Eye Region Detection in Fatigue Monitoring for the Military using AdaBoost Algorithm -- The Feature Extraction of ECG Signal in Myocardial Infarction Patients -- The Algorithm of Static Hand Gesture Recognition using Rule-Based Classification -- Medical Instructional Media in Human Body Systems using 3D Projection Mapping -- Development of Electromagnetic Wave Propagation in Microstrip Antenna using the Novel Finite Element Method -- Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy using Image Processing.\n\nNatural Language Processing plays a fundamental role in current AI research, as target of different scientific and industrial interests. At the same time, several AI achievements have shown their beneficial impact on applications in linguistic modelling, processing and generation. Especially the recent advancements in deep learning are drastically changing the landscape of NLP, where the continuous performance improvement on well established tasks is happening at an unprecedented speed. Therefore, Natural Language Processing is — still and once again — a rich research topic, whose cross-fertilization with AI spans a number of independent areas such as Cognitive Computing, Robotics as well as Human-Computer Interaction. For AI, Natural Languages are the research focus of paradigms and applications but, at the same time, they act as cornerstones of automation, autonomy and learnability for most intelligent tasks. Such tasks range from Computer Vision, to Planning and Social Behavior a..."
