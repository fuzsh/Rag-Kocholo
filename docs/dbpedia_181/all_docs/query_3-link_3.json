        "text": "Buy data Donate\n\nUpdates:\n\nUpdate 15 to the GEC, the successor to the FIPS standard, is dated 2014-03-31. It changes the spelling of one province from Tamanghasset to Tamanrasset. On 2014-10-29, ISO 3166-2 made the same spelling change. It appears that the -r- spelling is now more prevalent in English (and French).\n\nCountry overview:\n\nShort nameALGERIA ISO codeDZ FIPS codeAG LanguageArabic (ar) Time zone+1 CapitalAlgiers\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Algeria was a French colony. The borders, except near the Mediterranean coast, were ill-defined. The administrative division into departments and territories was based on French practice. During much of the colonial period, Algerian departments had a legal status which was supposedly equal to that of the European departments of France. Algeria became independent in 1962. Since then, it has re-organized twice. After the most recent change, in 1984, the new subdivisions were called wilayas. The southern border has been clearly defined, but the southern parts of the Tunisian and Moroccan borders are still in dispute.\n\nWhen Algeria was under French administration, the official division names were in French. With independence, Arabic was made the national language. Many place names were changed. However, the French language has continued to occupy an important position as a lingua franca, and place names have continued to be written in the Roman alphabet using French phonetics. In 2002-02, a constitutional amendment recognized Tamazigh (the written language of the largest Berber group) as a national language.\n\nOther names of country:\n\nArabic: al-Jumhuriya al-Jazairiya ad-Dimuqratiya ash-Shabiya (formal)\n\nDanish: Algeriet\n\nDutch: Algerije, Democratische Volksrepubliek Algerije (formal)\n\nEnglish: Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria (formal)\n\nFinnish: Algeria\n\nFrench: Algérie f, République f algérienne démocratique et populaire (formal)\n\nGerman: Algerien n, Algier n (obsolete)\n\nIcelandic: Alsír\n\nItalian: Algeria f\n\nNorwegian: Den demokratiske folkerepublikk Algerie (formal) (Bokmål), Den demokratiske folkerepublikken Algerie (formal) (Nynorsk), Algerie\n\nPortuguese: Argélia, República f Popular Democrática da Argélia f (formal)\n\nRussian: Алжирия, Алжирская Народная Демократическая Республика (formal)\n\nSpanish: Argelia f, República f Argelina Democrática y Popular (formal)\n\nSwedish: Algeriet\n\nTurkish: Cezayir Demokratik Halk Cumhuriyeti (formal)\n\nOrigin of name:\n\nArabic al-Jazairiya from capital city Algiers, which comes from Arabic al-jaza`ir: the islands, for four islands in the harbor (now connected to the mainland by jetties)\n\nPrimary subdivisions:\n\nAlgeria is divided into 48 wilayat (provinces; sing. wilaya).\n\nProvinceHASCISOFIPSPopulationArea(km.²)Area(mi.²) AdrarDZ.AR01AG34399,714464,900179,500 Aïn DeflaDZ.AD44AG35766,0134,2601,645 Aïn TémouchentDZ.AT46AG36371,2392,6301,015 AlgerDZ.AL16AG012,988,145273105 AnnabaDZ.AN23AG37609,4991,412545 BatnaDZ.BT05AG031,119,79112,0284,644 BécharDZ.BC08AG38270,061161,40062,300 BéjaïaDZ.BJ06AG18912,5773,3291,285 BiskraDZ.BS07AG19721,35621,6718,367 BlidaDZ.BL09AG201,002,9371,541595 Bordj Bou ArréridjDZ.BB34AG39628,4753,9201,514 BouiraDZ.BU10AG21695,5834,5171,744 BoumerdèsDZ.BM35AG40802,0831,558602 ChlefDZ.CH02AG411,002,0884,6511,796 ConstantineDZ.CO25AG04938,4752,288883 DjelfaDZ.DJ17AG221,092,18429,03511,210 El BayadhDZ.EB32AG42228,62470,53927,235 El OuedDZ.EO39AG43647,54880,00031,000 El TarfDZ.ET36AG44408,4142,9981,158 GhardaïaDZ.GR47AG45363,59886,10533,245 GuelmaDZ.GL24AG23482,4303,9111,510 IlliziDZ.IL33AG4652,333284,618109,892 JijelDZ.JJ18AG24636,9482,399926 KhenchelaDZ.KH40AG47386,6839,8113,788 LaghouatDZ.LG03AG25455,60225,0529,673 MascaraDZ.MC29AG26784,0735,9622,302 MédéaDZ.MD26AG06819,9328,7003,360 MilaDZ.ML43AG48766,8863,4081,316 MostaganemDZ.MG27AG07737,1182,269876 MsilaDZ.MS28AG27990,59118,4477,122 NaamaDZ.NA45AG49192,89130,64411,832 OranDZ.OR31AG091,454,0782,114816 OuarglaDZ.OG30AG50558,558270,030104,260 Oum el BouaghiDZ.OB04AG29621,6127,6382,949 RelizaneDZ.RE48AG51726,1804,8401,869 SaïdaDZ.SD20AG10330,6416,6312,560 SétifDZ.SF19AG121,489,9796,5042,511 Sidi Bel AbbèsDZ.SB22AG30604,7449,1513,533 SkikdaDZ.SK21AG31898,6804,1371,597 Souk AhrasDZ.SA41AG52438,1274,3601,683 TamanrassetDZ.TM11AG53176,637556,000214,700 TébessaDZ.TB12AG33648,70313,8785,358 TiaretDZ.TR14AG13846,82320,0877,756 TindoufDZ.TN37AG5449,149159,00061,400 TipazaDZ.TP42AG55591,0102,219857 TissemsiltDZ.TS38AG56294,4763,1511,217 Tizi OuzouDZ.TO15AG141,127,6072,9931,156 TlemcenDZ.TL13AG15949,1359,0183,482 48 provinces34,080,0302,381,741919,595\n\nStatus: These divisions are wilayat (provinces).\n\nHASC: Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes.\n\nISO: Province codes from ISO 3166-2.

Under French administration, the country was divided into départements (departments), which were subdivided into arrondissements, which in turn were subdivided into communes. (I use \"commune\" to translate the French \"commune,\" and \"municipality\" to translate the Arabic \"baladiyah,\" but they're essentially the same thing.)\n\nTerritorial extent:\n\nThe UN LOCODE page for Algeria lists locations in the country, some of them with their latitudes and longitudes, some with their ISO 3166-2 codes for their subdivisions.

Generally speaking, the civil territories were in the north along the coast, while the military territories were in the Sahara region.\n\n1845-04-24: By ordinance, Algeria was divided into three provinces. Their names were Alger (English: Algiers), Constantine, and Oran, after their capitals. Each province was further subdivided into three territories.\n\n1848-12-09: By French presidential decree, the civil territory in each province was elevated to a department of the same name, with a status nominally equal to the departments of European France. The departments were subdivided into arrondissements, communes, and districts (civilian commisariats). The military territory was divided into three provinces, with external capitals Alger, Constantine, and Oran. The provinces later became divisions. They were further divided into subdivisions, which in turn were divided into cercles (circles). The subdivisions were to the military territories as the arrondissements were to the civil territories, and the cercles were on a par with the districts.\n\n1870-10-24: By decree No. 134, the departments united the civil and military territories, strengthening the equivalence between arrondissements and subdivisions. There were five or six subdivisions. As time went by, the civil territories grew at the expense of the military territories. Certain parts of the military territory were organized as annexes. An annex was the area dominated by a fort, and was part of a cercle.\n\n1900: According to Jean-Jacques Sudre, in 1900, mentioning only \"clearly definable entities\", Algeria was divided into the entities shown in this table (dep = department, div = division, arr = arrondissement, sub = subdivision).\n\nPrimarySecondaryCercles Alger depAlger arr Médéa arr Miliana arr Orléansville arr Tizi-Ouzou arr Alger divLaghouat subEl Goléah *, Laghouat * Médéa subBoghar, Bou Saada, Djelfa * Constantine depBatna arr Bône arr Bougie arr Constantine arr Guelma arr Philippeville arr Sétif arr Constantine divBatna subBiskra *, Khenchela, Tebessa, Touggourt * Sétif sub(none) Oran depMascara arr Mostaganem arr Oran arr Sidi Bel Abbès arr Tlemcen arr Oran divAïn Sefra subAïn Sefra *, Geryville *, Mecheria *, Saïda Mascara subTiaret Tlemcen subMaghnia\n\n1902-12-24: Parts of the military territories - the cercles marked with an asterisk (*) above, with minor alterations - were consolidated into a unit called Territoires du Sud. As a result, Algeria was divided into three departments and one territory. The departments were divided into arrondissements, as shown below.\n\nDepartmentNo.Pop-1936Pop-1948Pop-1954Area(km.²)Arrondissements Alger912,240,9112,765,8983,103,20554,861Alger, Aumale, Blida, Médéa, Miliana, Orléansville, Tizi-Ouzou Constantine932,727,7663,108,1653,424,21787,578Batna, Bône, Bougie, Constantine, Guelma, Philippeville, Sétif Oran921,623,3561,990,7292,178,83567,262Mascara, Mostaganem, Oran, Sidi Bel Abbès, Tiaret, Tlemcen Territoires du Sud94642,651816,993822,4131,981,750 Total7,234,6848,681,7859,528,6702,191,451\n\nNo.: Department code, assigned in 1951.\n\nPop-1936: Source [8].\n\nPop-1948: 1948-10-31 census (source [9]).\n\nPop-1954: 1954-10-31 census (source [9]).\n\n1905-08-14: Territoires du Sud organized into four territories: Aïn Sefra, Ghardaia, Oasis (no capital), and Touggourt.\n\n1955-08-07: Bône department formed by taking the eastern arrondissements of Constantine department: Bône and Guelma. Twelve new arrondissements created, making a total of 32.\n\n1956-06-28: The three northern departments of 1955 were restored and given the status of igamies. (An igamie is the jurisdiction of an igame, which is an acronym for inspecteur général de l'administration en mission extraordinaire = administrative inspector general on special mission.) Each igamie was subdivided into four new departments. For details, see the table below. The departments were further subdivided into arrondissements.\n\n1957-01-10: The four territories joined a union called Organisation commune des régions sahariennes = Common Organization of Saharan Regions.\n\n1957-05-20: Thirty-four new arrondissements were created.\n\n1957-07-01: New department codes assigned to the thirteen departments.\n\n1957-08-07: Territoires du Sud (formerly department no. 9T) split into two departments. The western part, Aïn Sefra territory, became Saoura department; the eastern part, Ghardaïa, Oasis, and Touggourt territories, became Oasis department. (Details provided by Huang Qingqi.)\n\n1958-03-17: Saïda department created by taking parts of Oran, Saoura, and Tiaret departments. Aumale (department no. 9N) department created by taking Aumale, Bou-Saâdaa, Ouled-Djellal, and Tablata arrondissements from Médéa department. Bougie (9P) department created by taking Djidjelli arrondissement from Constantine department and Akbou, Bougie, Kerrata, Lafayette, and Sidi-Aïch arrondissements from Sétif department. Barika arrondissement transferred from Batna department to Sétif. Tébessa arrondissement transferred from Bône to Batna.\n\n1959-11-07: Aumale and Bougie departments abolished and restored to their original departments, except that Ouled-Djellal arrondissement from Aumale department merged with Barika arrondissement of Sétif department to become Barika arrondissement of Batna department. Tébessa arrondissement restored from Batna to Bône. Le Telagh arrondissement transferred from Saïda to Oran. This table shows the resulting subdivision of Algeria.
