A total of 85 faecal samples of domestic dogs were collected from six localities, including Birine, Sidi Ladjel, Dar Chioukh, Aïn Maâbed, Aïn El-Ibel and Djelfa city from province of Djelfa, Algeria. Samples were tested for presence of Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina and Ancylostoma caninum eggs by formol-ether concentration and flotation techniques. Microscopic examination revealed an infection rate of 9.4%, 15.3% and 1.15% for T. canis, T. leonina and A. caninum, respectively. Males were more frequently infected with T. leonina as compared to females, while, no difference was observed regarding T. canis and A. caninum. Prevalence of T. canis and T. leonina did not vary significantly with age ranges of dogs. In contrast, A. caninum seems to be more found in dogs aged of 6-12 months. Prevalence of the three species did not vary significantly in dogs without diarrhea and those with diarrhea. Through these preliminary findings, dogs from steppic region of Djelfa can play a potential role in the dissemination of these neglected zoonotic helminths, which may endanger health of peoples, particularly, pastoral community.
