        "text": "Years after his divorce from first wife Ali Landry, Mario Lopez has made some not-so-nice remarks saying he never even loved her.\n\nIn his new memoir, Just Between Us, Lopez discloses lots of new information about himself, including why he cheated on his model/actress wife back in 2004, admitting he didn’t love her. The ’90s teen idol was photographed being way too cozy with an unidentified woman during a bachelor party just weeks after his wedding to Landry.\n\nMario Lopez lands a bride and a TV deal\n\n“It was spring break… everybody was hanging out. That was a situation where I was not mature and man enough,” Lopez told Howard Stern in 2011, according to Us Weekly magazine. “I had no business being in that position.”\n\nNow, in his new tell-all book, Lopez is admitting that he was never in love with Landry during their short-lived relationship, which is what ultimately led him to stray so soon after they got married. The Saved by the Bell alum also revealed why he never told the whole story of what happened in his first and epically failed marriage.\n\nSpeediest celebrity breakups\n\n“I had never addressed certain relationships, especially the truth and the handling of what happened in my first marriage. I got inebriated and a little too friendly with a young lady,” Lopez wrote. “When it was time to return home, lightning hit me with the truth: I wasn’t in love. But I walked down the aisle [anyway].”\n\nWhile he definitely caused her big-time heartbreak back then, Landry has moved on and is now happily married with three children. Lopez is himself in a much happier marriage after he wed Courtney Mazza in 2012. The lovebirds have two children of their own, Gia, 4, and Dominic, 13 months."
