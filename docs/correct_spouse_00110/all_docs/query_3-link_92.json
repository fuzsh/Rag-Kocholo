        "text": "One would think that being together for a long time prior to marriage would guarantee that the relationship is solid. But that’s not always the case.\n\nI donât know about you, but it still catches me off guard that Brad and Angie have been together longer than Brad and Jen. Seems like only yesterday they were swearing that they werenât a couple and that Angie had nothing to do with Bradâs divorce. Then they were photographed togetherâa lotâand have been ever since. Maybe my sense of time is off because the media still treats Jennifer Aniston as a woman scorned (guys, sheâs OK, really).\n\nIn any case, the tabloids have been waiting for the Brangelina wedding since those early days and they finally got itânine years later. I considered the pair to be married long ago. Having children binds people to a greater degree than marriage itself. I found it absurd that the media made such a big deal about their engagement in April 2012. At that point they had been together for seven years and their childrenâs legal last names had been Jolie-Pitt since early 2006. They were unquestionably committed to each other and their family.\n\nAs their engagement crossed the two-year mark, however, I began to think that they had been together for so long that getting married might actually jeopardize their relationship. There is a unique relationship phenomena that happens to celebrities and civilians alike: A couple will be in a seemingly successful long-term relationship, then theyâll get married and things fall apart. A few examples:Â\n\nHelen Hunt & Hank Azaria – Together for five years. Married for 17Â months.\n\nMario Lopez & Ali Landry – Together for six years. Split two weeks after marriage.\n\nAxl Rose & Erin Everly – Together four years. Married for one month.\n\nBrooke Shields & Andre Agassi – Together four years. Married for two years.\n\nJewel & Ty Murray – Together for 10Â years. Married for six years.\n\nOne would think that being together for a long time prior to marriage would guarantee that the relationship is solid and separating is not in the cards. Is there something about marriage that changes a relationshipâfor better or worseâno matter how long a couple has been together? Or do people knowâon a subconscious levelâthat the relationship is rocky and think that marriage might fix it?\n\nResearch points to the latter. According to a study conducted by Jennifer Gauvain, a licensed clinical social worker and co-author of How Not to Marry the Wrong Guy: Is He âthe Oneâ or Should You Run?: A Guide to Living Happily Ever After, 30% of now divorced women say they knew they were making a mistake on their wedding day, and they went ahead anyway. Based on Gauvainâs research these are the most common reasons why:\n\n1. Weâve dated for so long, I donât want to waste all the time we have invested in the relationship.\n\n2. I donât want to be alone.\n\n3. Heâll change after we get married.\n\n4. It is too late, too embarrassing, and/or too expensive to call off the wedding.\n\n5. He is a really nice guy; I donât want to hurt his feelings.\n\nFor what weâre discussing here, no. 1 seems most plausible. It makes sense that someoneÂ wouldnât want to start all over after having been with one person for many years. Unfortunately, that doesnât mean the relationship is healthy or sustainable. I posted thoughts similar to these on Facebook and two commenters, both female, chimed in with, âYup! It happened to me.â\n\nThis isnât to say this is the case with Brad and Ang. By all appearances, they are a happy, beautiful couple who have plenty of talent and altruism to go around. If thereâs one thing, however, that celebrities are good at doing, itâs reminding us that appearances are rarely what they seem.\n\nSamara OâShea is the author ofÂ Loves Meâ¦Not: How to Survive (and Thrive!) in the Face of Unrequited Love.Â You can find her onÂ FacebookÂ andÂ Twitter.\n\nRelated Links:"
