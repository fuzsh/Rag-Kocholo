        "text": "Mario Lopez Admits To Cheating Before Wedding To Ali Landry\n\nMario Lopez has gone public about cheating on Ali Landry in 2004, days before their wedding. The marriage was annulled two weeks after the big day. “It was spring break….everybody was hanging out. That was a situation where I was not mature and man enough,” Lopez said of his bachelor party that apparently got out of control. Lopez also admits that he then decided to go forward with the wedding and deal with the situation later, but Landry eventually saw pictures of him with another woman and filed for divorce."
