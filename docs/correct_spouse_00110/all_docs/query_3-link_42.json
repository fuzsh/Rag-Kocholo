        "text": "Courtney Mazza and Mario Lopez have three kids together. Before she came along, the actor had no intention of settling down, but she changed his mind. Here are a few standout details about their relationship.\n\nCourtney Laine Mazza is known as an American actress, producer, and dancer, and she is also Mario Lopez's second wife. The pair have been married since December 1, 2012, and share three kids.\n\nBefore the two fell in love, the talented actor, who played A.C Slater in NBC's hit teen comedy series \"Saved by the Bell,\" was married to a woman named Ali Landry Monteverde. Their union lasted from April 24, 2004, until it was annulled on May 12, 2004, due to his infidelity.\n\nCourtney Laine Mazza and Mario Lopez attend Los Angeles Dodgers Foundation's annual Blue Diamond Gala on June 16, 2022, in Los Angeles, California. | Source: Getty Images\n\nWHO IS COURTNEY LAINE MAZZA?\n\nMazza is a triple-threat entertainer who has experience working on TV and movies. However, she also has a career on Broadway, where she has featured in a couple of projects, including \"Cry-Baby, \"The Little Mermaid,\" and \"A Chorus Line.\"\n\nOn TV, she is best known for starring in the series \"The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia,\" while her best-known role was in a movie called \"Pittsburgh.\"\n\nMazza also co-hosts a radio show with her husband where they talk about entertainment news and the latest happenings in pop culture.\n\nHer works on Broadway, TV and the big screens have earned her the Gene Kelly Award (GKA). She won the GKA award for Best Actress in \"Weird Romance\" (1996) and \"Violet\" (1999).\n\nMazza is also famous for appearing in \"Mario Lopez: Saved by the Baby,\" a reality show that followed her spouse's preparation to become a father for the first time.\n\nThe talented woman also has a following of more than 350,000 people on her Instagram page, where she shares pictures of her family as well as memes that her fans always find hilarious.\n\nShe also shares photos of herself attending sports events such as the Dodgers or the Super Bowl; she enjoys working out, loves her dog, and shares a lot of her day-to-day life, particularly her work.\n\nMazza regularly shares photos of her and her husband, who once quipped that he always calls his wife by her last name. \"I couldn't see myself ever being with someone named Courtney,\" he said.\n\nHOW DID COURTNEY LAINE MAZZA AND MARIO LOPEZ MEET?\n\nThe two lovebirds met in 2008 while he was doing a six-month run on a Broadway project titled \"A Chorus Line.\" The first time he saw her, she was on stage, so he walked up to her and tried to make small talk before asking her out.\n\nHer response was a no, but it turned out that she had only been playing hard to get. It worked, and when she eventually agreed to a date, the day did not go according to plan.\n\nHe had been at a dinner with Kate Couric, who had been in a chatty mood, so he had called Mazza to tell her he would be 20 minutes late, and she blew him off.\n\nFortunately, they rescheduled and hit things off until he had to return to LA while she stayed in New York working on another Broadway show.\n\nThey had to keep the relationship long-distance in the following months, but eventually, she said goodbye to Broadway and moved to LA to be with him.\n\nCOURTNEY LAINE MAZZA AND MARIO LOPEZ GOT MARRIED IN MEXICO\n\nLopez put a ring on Mazza's finger while they were in Mexico for Christmas celebrations in December 2011. He went down on one knee on the beach of Ixtapa Zihuatanejo, surrounded by family, friends, and cameras.\n\nLopez's Bachelor party was held in Las Vegas, and he was surprised when his bride-to-be gave him a sensual onstage performance with \"The Pussycat Dolls,\" wearing a tight black basque and fishnet stockings.\n\nTheir wedding was held in Punta Mita, Mexico, the following year and was attended by friends and family. Their daughter Gia, who had been two years old, was the flower girl.\n\nThe wedding cake was a work of art crafted by Buddy Valastro from \"Cake Boss,\" but the inspiration came from Mazza, who handled food and flowers.\n\nStars like Eva Longoria attended, and there were mariachis because of the importance Lopez places on his heritage. The pair chose not to have a registry, instead opting for donations.\n\nLopez took care of entertainment and ensured everything was perfect for the event. It was covered by a TLC special titled \"Mario & Courtney's Wedding Fiesta.\"\n\nSpeaking about what she likes about her husband, Mazza said his spontaneous and romantic nature. Her husband makes sure to keep the romance alive, even with their kids around, saying:\n\nâKids and jobs and everything else gets in the way, but you canât forget about each other.â\n\nHe said he manages to keep their marriage spicey by taking even the smallest moments to romance his wife and going on short trips together. Mazza keeps the romance fresh through her cooking, which her husband loves, especially when he comes home to a wholehearted meal.\n\nCOURTNEY LAINE MAZZA AND MARIO LOPEZ HAVE THREE CHILDREN\n\nMazza and Mario's first child was born on September 11, 2010, two years before their wedding, and she was named Gia. She is the couple's first and only daughter.\n\nHer parents expanded the family again on September 9, 2013, when they welcomed her brother Dominic via C-section, and he has since grown up to become an athletic boy just like his parents. Their third child was named Santino, born on July 8, 2019.\n\nSpeaking about his wife during pregnancy, the loving husband expressed gratitude for his wife's good health and positive attitude the whole way through. He stated:\n\nâI always try and make sure sheâs happy and comfortable when sheâs not pregnant, and even more so now.\"\n\nMore than that, he spoke about how gorgeous he finds Mazza when she is pregnant. He joked that if he could, he would keep her pregnant continuously... minus the babies.\n\nCOURTNEY MAZZA LIVES IN A LUXURY HOME\n\nIn Glendale, California, Lopez's 4,430 square feet house is alleged to be valued at $1,940,000, complete with four bedrooms and six bathrooms. This mansion, where Mazza and Lopez raise their children, has a Mediterranean aesthetic and a heart-stopping view of Glendale's downtown.\n\nTheir house sports arched windows and doorways, a fireplace and chandelier in their living room, a chef's kitchen, and many playrooms. With a pool, spa, and large patio, this house boasts a life of familial luxury.\n\nWHO IS COURTNEY MAZZA'S HUSBAND?\n\nMario Lopez is an actor, producer, and writer, born on October 10, 1973. He is well-known for playing A.C Slater for the late 1980s \"Saved by the Bell\" and has been nominated for and won numerous awards.\n\nIn 2020, he played in the reboot of \"Saved by the Bell,\" but his talents go further than acting; he chose to co-host \"Acess Hollywood,\" starting a radio show with his wife and taking on a lot of cameos.\n\nLopez is not immune to scandal, allegedly making transphobic comments on \"The Candace Owen's Show.\" He was also accused of sexual assault in the early 1990s and, as mentioned, cheated on his first wife.\n\nBEFORE COURTNEY LAINE MAZZA, MARIO LOPEZ WAS NOT READY TO SETTLE DOWN\n\nLopez's relationship with his first wife, Ali Landry, was reportedly a mistake that should not have advanced as far as marriage. He stated that even at the time, he felt uncertain about the upcoming wedding. However, Lopez felt everything had been arranged already, and it was too late to look back.\n\nIn his memoir, \"Just Between Us,\" he confessed that he was never indeed in love with her while they were together. His relationship with her ended when he was pictured in a compromising position with an unidentified woman, which reportedly happened at his bachelor party.\n\nThe picture made its way into the hands of his sister-in-law, and it consequently spelled doom for his relationship with Landry.\n\nThe actor now enjoys a fulfilled family life with his three kids, whom he adores, and his wife, who loves him as deeply as he loves her.\n\nncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwanBiZnqku9Srq6edqWK6osbZmmSiq12irrO1zmajqKiVr8Buv8ScpqecXay2b7TTpqM%3D"
