        "text": "Former Miss USA Ali Landry is promoting her new show, Hollywood Girls Night, in which she hangs out and has dinner and drinks with other female celebrities you sort-of recognize, like her co-host Allison Sweeney and guests either directly from “Dancing With The Stars” or that you’d expect to see on DWTS. I taped it and watched about 10 minutes before it bugged me and I switched it off. I’m also annoyed by other open-ended women’s talkshows like “The View” and “The Talk”. So it might be interesting if I gave it a chance.\n\nIn a new interview with Wendy Williams, (video is below) Ali finally opens up about her two week marriage to Mario Lopez in 2004. She explained that she was able to confirm Lopez’s infidelity with the help of a friend who helped her tap his phone. (It sounds like her friend just set up a forward from Mario’s phone to Ali’s phone.) Ali said that Mario denied that he cheated, even after she had evidence and confronted him, and that she’s never talked to him since. In the wake of her painful quickie marriage, she then took some time to re-explore her Catholic faith. Ali met her super hot now second husband, director Alejandro Monteverde, at a theology study class in L.A. She admitted to Wendy Williams that she didn’t have sex with Alejandro until they were married in 2006!\n\nAfter six years of dating, Ali Landry’s marriage to Mario Lopez ended in a matter of weeks when she discovered he had cheated.\n\nSo when it came time to get serious with now-husband Alejandro Monteverde, the Hollywood Girls Night star, 38, had one rule â abstinence.\n\n“Because of the situation I was in before, I was just treading lightly, and did not want to make any mistakes in this relationship,” Landry explains on an episode of The Wendy Williams Show airing Thursday. “We abstained from having sex until we got married.”\n\nHaving wed the director in 2006, Landry â now mom to daughter Estela, 4Â½, and son Marcelo, 5 months â says her experience with Lopez taught her to listen to her heart.\n\n“I had heard something right before the wedding. He swore that it was not true, but I had that feeling in my gut,” she says. “All of my family was flying in â it was a destination wedding â and I really should have put the brakes on it at that point, but I was afraid.”\n\nHer suspicions aroused, a friend of Landry’s offered up her phone-tapping skills.\n\n“I was like, ‘I don’t want to tap a phone! I can’t believe I’m doing this.’ So she did, and right after the honeymoon I started getting phone calls from these girls,” she recalls. “I confronted him and he still â to this day â denied it and never apologized. It was horrible.”\n\nTwo weeks after the wedding, Landry filed for an annulment of her marriage, which was soon granted. Crushed, the actress found herself seeking solace in religion â which led her to Monteverde.\n\n“I was so side-swiped by the whole thing … I never really got angry. I discovered a lot about myself and I’m a better woman because of it,” she notes. “I met my husband at a theology class in L.A. â who knew? He was the person I was meant to be with.”\n\n[From People]\n\nI wouldn’t be able to hold out that long, but it sounds like both of them were on the same page with their religious beliefs. Good for them. They’re so attractive and adorable together, and they look so much alike! Ali really dodged a bullet with Mario Lopez, and now she has a happy and contented family life."
