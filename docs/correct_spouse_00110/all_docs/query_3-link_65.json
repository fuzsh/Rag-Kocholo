        "text": "When celebrities divorce, the entire world is aware of when, why, and how they decided to end their relationship. Even more so when that life-long commitment lasts less than a year or even less than a month in some situations. Here’s a list of the 5 shortest celebrity marriages that made a mockery of love:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Britney Spears and Jason Alexander\n\nThis marriage lasted 55 hours in total. Yes, it’s been 55 hours. This record-breaking marriage ended barely two days after it was made official. The pop singer traveled to Vegas to marry her childhood pal after ringing in the new year in 2004. A court terminated their “joke” marriage hours later, and the story ends. In an interview with E!, she claimed, “It was me being silly, being rebellious, and not really taking the responsibility of what I was doing.”\n\n2. Carmen Electra and Dennis Rodman\n\nYou could be astonished to learn that Carmen Electra’s marriage to Dennis Rodman lasted barely 9 days. One of the shortest celebrity marriages, the couple barely made it through the first week of their relationship before breaking up. Carmen Electra told People, “My advice to anyone is not to get married in Vegas.” On November 14, 1998, the pair married in a Sin City-style wedding at the Little Chapel of the Flowers. Rodman was the one who applied for an annulment nine days later. He cited “fraud” and “unsound mind” as reasons for the divorce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Eddie Murphy and Tracey Edmonds\n\nOn New Year’s Day in Bora Bora, Eddie Murphy and Tracey Edmonds pledged their love for one another in a spiritual wedding. The pair had planned to make their marriage legal, but later released a statement saying that after much study and debate, they had unanimously decided that a formal ceremony was not essential to define their partnership further. They also said that though their recent union was indicative of their spiritual love, friendship, and respect for one another, they decided to remain friends.\n\n4. Ali Landry and Mario Lopez\n\nMario Lopez’s six whole years of dating clearly weren’t enough to groom him for marriage. Ali Landry found out soon after their 2004 Mexican wedding that her new husband had cheated on her. Let’s just say his bachelor party gave him a little too much pleasure. We can’t imagine how hurtful it was for her to learn that, especially given they’d only been married for a few days when the truth was revealed. It’s no wonder that two weeks later, the actress applied for an annulment, alleging “irreconcilable differences” and “fraud” as her reasons for divorce.\n\n5. Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries\n\nThis marriage (and subsequent divorce) was arguably one of the most discussed celebrity marriages of all time, but in case you missed it, here’s a recap. When NBA player Kris Humphries went down on one knee in May 2011, reality star Kim Kardashian said yes. In August of that year, they got hitched, and by Halloween, they were divorcing. Everyone assumed their 72-day wedding was a PR ploy staged by the Kardashians and E! Entertainment, but all parties have denied the allegations. In an official blog post, she stated, “First and foremost, I married for love. I can’t believe I even have to defend this. I would not have spent so much time on something just for a TV show.”"
