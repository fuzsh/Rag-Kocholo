        "text": "In a revealing interview with Wendy Williams, actress Ali Landry opened up about her marriage to Alejandro Monteverde. Landry told Williams that the couple practiced abstinence before they were married.\n\n\"Because of the situation I was in before, I was just treading lightly and did not want to make any mistakes in this relationship,\" she told Williams. \"We abstained from having sex until we got married.\"\n\nLandry talked about her former six-year relationship with Mario Lopez. The couple married in April 2004 and had the marriage annulled two weeks later over infidelity.\n\nGet Our Latest News for FREE\n\nSubscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know.\n\nShe revealed that before marrying Lopez, she had heard rumors of his infidelity.\n\n\"I had heard something right before the wedding. He swore that it was not true, but I had that feeling in my gut. All of my family were flying away – it was a destination wedding – and I really should have put the brakes on it at that point, but I was afraid,\" she confessed.\n\nThe former Miss USA told The Christian Post that since she had been in a relationship where \"he cheated on me,\" it \"caused me to reevaluate everything in my life.\"\n\n\"I was so sideswiped by the whole thing, the only place I got answers was I read the Bible like every single day,\" she also said on \"The Wendy Williams Show.\"\n\nShe further told CP that she began \"praying for my husband and met him during Bible study.\" Landry and Monteverde were married in April 2006 and are still currently married.\n\nLandry and Monteverde have two children together and are seeking to provide more Christian-based entertainment projects. Landry has just released \"Me Again\" on DVD, which stars Della Reese and David A.R. White. She spoke with The Christian Post about venturing into faith-based projects.\n\n\"I know that this is what I am meant to do; I am so happy and content,\" said Landry.\n\n\"My husband is doing the same thing with his production company; we want to speak to the masses,\" she told CP. \"We want to get our message out to everyone, not just the Christian market. That's what we're trying to do.\""
