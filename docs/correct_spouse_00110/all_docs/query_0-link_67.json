        "text": "Ali Landry appeared on The Wendy Williams Show yesterday and made a startling admission: She and husband Alejandro Monteverde waited until after they were married to have sex. How come?\n\nBecause the former Miss USA was burned so badly by her first husband, actor/host Mario Lopez.\n\n“I had heard something right before the wedding. He swore that it was not true, but I had that feeling in my gut,” Landry said of rumors that her then-fiance had been unfaithful, going on to explain she actually tapped Lopez’s phone to learn the truth.\n\nLandry filed for an annulment two weeks after confronting Lopez about his infidelity – “He still – to this day – denied it and never apologized. It was horrible,” she says – and eventually met Monteverde in a theology class.\n\nBut there were no bodily fluids exchanged until vows were exchanged.\n\n“Because of the situation I was in before, I was just treading lightly, and did not want to make any mistakes in this relationship,” Landry told Williams, adding of the father of her two kids: “He was the person I was meant to be with.”"
