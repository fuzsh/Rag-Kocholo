        "text": "Ali Landry is breaking her silence on the horrifying murders of her father-in-law and brother-in-law — and her words are devastating.\n\nMore: Ali Landry reveals how she busted Mario Lopez\n\nLandry and her husband, film producer Alejandro Gómez Monteverde, were left shell-shocked when Juan Manuel Gómez Fernández and Juan Manuel Gómez Monteverde were kidnapped and later found murdered in Mexico. A month after the pair’s bodies were found with severe head wounds, Landry has spoken out about the killings on social media.\n\n“I want to thank all of you for your love, support and prayers during this time of grief. Yes, the events surrounding my family were tragic and what has happened will profoundly affect our lives forever,” wrote Landry on WhoSay.\n\n“But my Father in Law was the kind of man that radiated pure joy and it was infectious. He loved and adored his family more than anything. He was a jokester, a great dancer, a crier (especially when he was talking about his sons:), and he lived his life in the present, appreciating each moment as a huge blessing. He was my husbands hero and like my second Dad (sic),” she continued, “My brother in law was such a hard working business owner. He was an incredible salsa dancer, he was fluent in Japanese and we all looked up to him. When things became dangerous in Tampico a few years ago he moved his family to Estonia, Guadalajara, and then Mcallan Texas just to keep them safe. He was a wonderful friend, an amazing husband, and a great father to his two beautiful children.\n\n“This is a painful time, and we are still processing it all,” Landry wrote. “What we have realized is that this journey through grief and loss is a marathon, not a sprint, and the only way to get through it is by the grace of God. We are determined not to allow this event to define them or our lives.\n\n“We want to remember the beauty, the innocence, and the light that they represented, and to continue their legacy and always put family first:) (sic),” she concluded. “Thank you again for caring for our family!!! Love Ali.”\n\nThe deaths of Fernandez and Monteverde have been linked to possible drug cartel activity, but no arrests have been made yet."
