He has appeared on several television series, in films, and on Broadway. He is known for his portrayal of A.C.

He has appeared in numerous projects since, including the third season of Dancing with the Stars and as host for the syndicated entertainment news magazine shows Extra and Access Hollywood. He has also hosted America's Best Dance Crew for MTV. In 2012, he co-hosted the second season of the American version of The X Factor with Khloé Kardashian, and was the sole host for the third and final season.\n\nLopez was born on October 10, 1973, in Chula Vista, California, the son of Elvira Soledad Trasviña and Mario Alberto López Pérez.[1][2][3] Lopez was raised in a Catholic family. His parents are both emigrants from Mexico. His father was born in Culiacán, Sinaloa, and his mother in Tijuana, Baja California.[3][4] His younger sister, Marissa, is married to former NFL Minnesota Vikings and Houston Texans linebacker Kailee Wong.\n\nLopez started dance education at age three, training in tap and jazz.[5] He also did tumbling, karate and wrestling at his local Boys and Girls Club when he was 7 years old.[6] He excelled at these as well as other activities in which his mother enrolled him.[7] During high school at Chula Vista High School, he was on the school's wrestling team at the weight class of 160 lb (73 kg). He placed 2nd in the San Diego Section competition and 7th in California his senior year. He graduated in 1991.\n\nCareer\n\nLopez was discovered by a talent agent at a dance recital when he was 10 years old. He initially worked in local advertisements and commercials before making TV appearances.[8]\n\nActing\n\nLopez began acting in 1984 when he appeared as younger brother Tomás in the short-lived ABC comedy series a.k.a.
