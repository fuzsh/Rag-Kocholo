        "text": "Book Buzz: Mario Lopez memoir coming this fall\n\nGet ready for some '90s nostalgia.\n\nSaved by the Bell alum and Extra host Mario Lopez is writing a memoir, due out Sept. 30 from Celebra. The book, titled Just Between Us, will look at Lopez's success and failures navigating the entertainment industry.\n\nHe'll also discuss his very public love life, from his short-lived marriage to Ali Landry to dating his Dancing with the Stars partner Karina Smirnoff to his marriage to Broadway dancer Courtney Mazza, with whom he welcomed his second child last fall.\n\n\"In Just Between Us, I share my most intimate stories and pivotal moments, some of the best and most important times of my life and the heartbreaking mistakes that still haunt me,\" Lopez, 40, said in a release. \"There are no do-overs in life, so I had to learn to pick myself up and move forward, never forgetting the hard-won lessons. I'm thrilled to share my story in this memoir, to reveal the memories I've held close to my heart for the first time.\"\n\nLopez has written four other books, two health and fitness titles and two children's books."
