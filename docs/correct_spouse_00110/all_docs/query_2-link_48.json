        "text": "So-called Doritos Girl Ali Landry has spoken out for the first time about her abrupt split from Mario Lopez, revealing that just two weeks after their wedding she tapped Lopez’s phone and discovered he was cheating.\n\nThe former Miss USA sat down for an interview with “The Wendy Williams Show” yesterday and described her shock at discovering Lopez’s alleged indiscretions. The two had dated for six years before tying the knot. Their marriage was annulled in 2004.\n\n“I never spoke about it after it happened,” said Landry. “That’s probably the most dramatic thing that ever happened to me in my life. It was absolutely horrible — now I have a husband and children — but it was terrible.”\n\nLandry says that, if she were doing it over again, she would do a better job of listening to her instincts.\n\n“I had heard something right before the wedding,” said Landry. “He swore that it was not true but I had that feeling in my gut. But all my family was flying away for our destination wedding and it was a big trip for them. I really should have put the brakes on it at that point, but I was afraid … One of girlfriends said, ‘If you really want to know, I know how to tap a phone.’ The craziest thing. I thought, ‘I don’t want to tap his phone. This is the man I’ve been with, I should trust him.'”\n\nLandry did it anyway and says that, after their honeymoon, she began noticing his calls from assorted woman.\n\n“I confronted him and he denied it,” said Landry. “He never apologized. Still to this day.”\n\nWhen Williams revealed that Lopez had told her he was friends with all his exes, Landry interjected, “That’s a lie.”\n\nLandry says that she hasn’t seen or spoken to Lopez since their split.\n\n“To me it’s not about putting the blame on him, it’s about how a woman can move on from a situation like that,” says Landry, explaining that she met her current husband, director Alejandro Monteverde, in a theology class as she was looking for answers following the Lopez debacle. “I am very grateful that happened because I would not be where I am today.”\n\nLandry says that she and Monteverde did not have sex until they were married.\n\n“Because of the situation I was in before, I was treading lightly and didn’t want to make any mistakes in this relationship,” she explains. “So we abstained from having sex until we got married.”\n\nLandry and Monteverde married in 2006. They now have two children together.\n\nLandry is currently hosting the show “Hollywood Girls Night,” which airs on the TV Guide Network Sundays at 9pm."
