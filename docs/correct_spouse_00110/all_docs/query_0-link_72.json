        "text": "Mario Lopez's fiancee, Courtney Mazza, better keep a close eye on her man. His ex-wife, former Doritos Girl Ali Landry, opened up for the first time about how the \"Extra\" host cheated on her repeatedly during their six-year relationship on \"The Wendy Williams Show\" on Thursday. Just before their 2004 wedding, Landry says she heard rumblings that Lopez may have strayed, but when she confronted him about it, she says, \"He swore that it was not true.\" Although she adds that she had \"a feeling in my gut\" he was lying, Landry went ahead with the wedding anyway because it was in Mexico and her family had already booked their travel. \"I really should have put the brakes on it at that point, but I was afraid.\"\n\nSince Lopez wasn't forthcoming with the truth, a friend of Landry's suggested former Miss USA find it out for herself by tapping his phone. Although she was reluctant at first, she went ahead and let her friend do it for her. \"And right after the honeymoon I started getting phone calls from these girls,\" she told Williams. \"I confronted him and he — still to this day — denied it and never apologized.\" Lopez also reportedly cheated on their honeymoon, just three days after they tied the knot, when he left his new wife at the hotel while he partied with a 20-year-old all night. Two weeks after their fairytale wedding, Landry, 38, filed for an annulment from the former \"Saved By the Bell\" actor, whom she met in 1998 when he hosted Miss Teen USA (she was a commentator), and she hasn't spoken to him since.\n\nBut the experience wasn't all bad. After leaving Lopez, Landry, now 38, turned to her religion and found solace in reading the Bible every day. She even joined a theology class in Los Angeles — where she ended up meeting her future husband, director Alejandro Monteverde, whom she wed in 2006. Landry also admitted to Williams that because of what she went through with Lopez, she abstained from sex with Monteverde until their wedding night. \"I was just treading lightly, and did not want to make any mistakes in this relationship,\" said the \"Hollywood Girls Night\" host, who now has two children, Estela, 4, and Marcelo, 5 months, with the \"Bella\" director. \"He was the person I was meant to be with.\"\n\nLopez, meanwhile, proposed to Mazza, a Broadway dancer, in January and the two have an 18-month-old daughter, named Gia.\n\nMore Celebrity Features on Yahoo!:\n\nJennifer Lopez: Boyfriend Casper Smart is a 'Good Egg'\n\nJennie Garth Opens Up About Peter Facinelli Divorce: 'It's the Right Thing'\n\nNeve Campbell is Pregnant -- See Her Bump"
