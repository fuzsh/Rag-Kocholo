        "text": "Pretty people, as any family attorney in Pasadena can tell you, usually have the ugliest divorces. But when model and Doritos commerical diva Ali Landry divorced '80s teen heartthrob Mario Lopez, nobody knew how ugly things really were. The pair kept the deatils of their breakup under wraps. Recently, Landry sat down with talk show host Wendy Williams for a frank conversation about her short-lived relationship with Lopez.\n\nLopez and Landry were married in a Catholic ceremony in front of 50 guests at the exclusive Las Alamandas resort outside Puerto Vallarta, Mexico on April 24, 2004. Two weeks later, Landry infamously filed for divorce. What happened in that short time frame had largely remained a mystery until now. Landry told Williams that days before they were set to walk down the aisle, she heard rumors that Lopez was cheating on her. \"I had heard something right before the wedding: He swore that it was not true, but I had that feeling in my gut,\" Landry, 38, said. \"All of my family was flying in, it was a destination wedding, and I really should have put the brakes on it at that point, but I was afraid.\" Landry said one of her girlfriends even suggested that she could tap Lopez's phone to track his whereabouts. Landry agreed but she did so with reservations. \"I was like, 'I don't want to tap a phone! I can't believe I'm doing this.' But she did, and \"right after the honeymoon I started getting phone calls from these girls,\" Landry told Williams. \"I confronted him and he still to this day, he denied it and never apologized: It was horrible.\" Lopez has gone on record as saying he has friendly relationships with all of his exes but Landry says, \"That's a lie.\" She added that they have not spoken since 2004."
