        "text": "THE exact reason actress and former Miss USA Ali Landry's marriage was annulled after two weeks has been revealed.\n\nHer then husband, actor Mario Lopez, has confessed that he cheated on her on his bachelor party.\n\nLopez and Landry, who was named one of People Magazine's \"50 Most Beautiful\" in 1999 after winning Miss USA in 1996, had been long-time lovers when they married in April 2004. The annulment came amid rumours of Lopez's rampant cheating.\n\nNow, almost seven years later, 37-year-old Lopez has spoken about a wild bachelor party weekend in Mexico.\n\n\"It was my bachelor party,\" Lopez told US radio host Howard Stern, saying that he had been \"bouncing around\" Mexico with his cousins.\n\n\"I had no business of being in that position,\" he said, offering that he \"messed around\" with another woman.\n\n\"It was spring break ... everybody was hanging out. That was a situation where I was not mature and man enough.\"\n\nBefore heading out for his big weekend, Lopez didn't tell then-fiancee Landry the whole truth.\n\n\"I said I was going to Cabo (San Lucas) ... to go marlin fishing,\" he said.\n\n\"Then my cousin surprised me and said 'No, ... we're going on this whirlwind tour: Cabo, Acapulco, all these places.'\"\n\nRather than telling Landry about the change of plans, Lopez said \"I figured at that point it was easier to ask for forgiveness (afterward). It's my bachelor party, we were going to have a good time. And we went, we had a good time.\"\n\nLopez was caught in an incriminating poolside photograph with another woman.\n\n\"We're partying, and somebody took a picture,\" he explained.\n\nLandry's sister eventually got a hold of that photo and shared it with her.\n\n\"I was wrong for obviously lying, and I shouldn't have been in that position,\" Lopez said.\n\nFinally, Landry confronted him.\n\n\"I dealt with all this drama, and then at that point just realise ... I finally got the balls to say 'Hey, listen I'm not ready for this, I'm sorry.'\n\n\"At that point,\" the star said, \"I was not ready to settle down. I wasn't man enough to know how to go about handling it. \"\n\nWhy did Lopez marry Landry in the first place, then?\n\n\"I think when you go out for a few years you either take it to another level or you break up, right?\" he said of Landry, whom he had been dating for six years.\n\n\"There was nothing glaringly wrong on paper: I thought, 'She's beautiful, she's a good girl, she comes from a great family, she'd make a great mom ... I confused cold feet with not being ready.\"\n\nOlder and wiser, Lopez is more settled down these days with Courtney Mazza, his girlfriend of over two years. They had a daughter, Gia, in September.\n\n\"It worked out well,\" he said. \"Thank god, because I got a great girl now.\""
