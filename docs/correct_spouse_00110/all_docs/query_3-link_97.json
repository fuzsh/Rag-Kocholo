        "text": "Hollywood celebrities rarely give insightful interviews. But on the newest episode of Unfolding Leadership with Lacey Leone McLaughlin, Favored.by founder and former Miss USA Ali Landry spills about what goes on in Hollywood, why she’s grateful ex-husband Mario Lopez cheated on her, and more.\n\nLandry opens up to the podcast’s host, top Hollywood executive coach Lacey Leone McLaughlin. When publicly traded companies need to teach a green executive how to manage subordinates or an entertainment conglomerate needs to moderate a genius but difficult creative executive, they often call McLaughlin. For over 20 years, McLaughlin has guided top leaders through challenging workplace scenarios. With her no-nonsense, compassionate approach, she has solidified herself as one of the world’s foremost executive coaches.\n\nMcLaughlin decided to create her new podcast, so business leaders would start having honest conversations in public. McLaughlin and Landry discuss:\n\nLandry’s Relationship with Mario Lopez\n\nLandry dated Lopez for years, and then all hell broke loose once they married. “Not even a week [after the wedding] I found out it was like a Tiger Woods situation,” Landry tells McLaughlin. “It was cheating across the board.” Today, Landry says she thanks God “every single day” that Lopez cheated. Divorcing Lopez inspired her to own her life. She started her own companies and began developing her entertainment products. “It changed me as a woman,” Landry says. “I am so much better because that happened.”\n\nWhy Landry Stopped Listening to Her Business Team\n\nEarlier in her career, Landry did whatever her manager and other team members told her to do. “I wanted to please,” Landry says. “I always felt misrepresented. In that situation, I did not feel like a leader.” Landry stopped listening to her team. Moving forward, she only signed up for projects that she believed would improve her and other women’s lives. Her career and personal life both improved.\n\nHow Landry Wants to Help Other Women’s Businesses\n\nStarting her business wasn’t enough for Landry. She’s taking her Hollywood, business, and life lessons and hoping to help other women. She speaks to McLaughlin about why she aims to help other women take control of their destinies through public speaking and a new book.\n\nYou can listen to McLaughlin’s fascinating conversation with Landry on Apple, Audible, Spotify, and YouTube. McLaughlin is available to speak for an interview at your convenience, and I would be happy to schedule an interview. To speak with McLaughlin, email Mitchell@BCCcommunications. com.\n\nSpread the love!"
