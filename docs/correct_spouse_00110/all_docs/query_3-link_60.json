        "text": "Celebrity marriages, known for their lavish ceremonies and iconic wedding dresses, are not immune to the trials and tribulations of maintaining a lasting bond. That fact is made apparent when you consider the shortest celebrity marriages — where unions between Hollywood stars ignited in a flash and fizzled out just as swiftly, leaving fans to speculate over what went wrong.\n\nWhile some of the longest celebrity marriages give us hope for long lasting relationships, you have to wonder what kinds of pressures and complexities couples living in the spotlight must face. Occasionally, their high-profile whirlwind romances end in annulments just months, days or even hours after saying \"I do.\"\n\nAs we delve into the narratives behind these headline-grabbing breakups, one common thread emerges: from A-list actors to pop sensations, the shortest marriages in Hollywood offer a poignant reminder that even in a world saturated with glitz and glamor, the quest for enduring love is a challenge that knows no bounds. That being said, here's our celebrity list of the shortest marriages ever.\n\nJason Alexander and Britney Spears' Marriage, 55 Hours\n\nWhat is the shortest celebrity marriage? Well, Jason Alexander and Britney Spears were married for only 55 hours, making it the shortest celebrity marriage that we know of.\n\nThe two childhood friends decided to tie the knot in Las Vegas, impulsively getting married at the Little White Wedding Chapel in January 2004. The marriage was annulled shortly after.\n\n\"They appeared to be extremely happy. They were laughing, but crying, too, during the ceremony. I thought it was a marriage that would last forever,\" chapel owner Charlotte Richards recalled in an interview with Rolling Stone.\n\nBut in an E! News interview from 2004, Spears said, \"It was me being silly, being rebellious, and not really taking the responsibility of what I was doing, you know? And after partying, you know, you really don't think about what you're doing. So it was one of those things that were really silly.\"\n\nIt was widely reported that Spears' management and family played a significant role in urging her to annul the marriage, as they were concerned about the potential impact on her career and public image.\n\nNicolas Cage and Erika Koike's Marriage, 4 days\n\nNicolas Cage's marriage to his fourth wife, Erika Koike, was a super short-lived union that ended almost as quickly as it began. The two got married on March 23, 2019, in Las Vegas, about a year after they started dating. However, Cage filed for an annulment just four days later, making it one of the shortest celebrity marriages in history.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding their abrupt divorce were shrouded in controversy. Cage filed for an annulment, citing that he and Koike were heavily intoxicated at the time of their wedding, which he claimed impaired their ability to make rational decisions. He also cited his wife's criminal history as one of the reasons he wants his marriage annulled, according to court documents obtained by The Blast.\n\nTracey Edmonds and Eddie Murphy's Marriage, 14 days\n\nIn January 2008, Tracey Edmonds and Eddie Murphy had a romantic ceremony on a private island in Bora Bora. It was later revealed that the ceremony held no legal weight because they hadn't obtained a marriage license in the United States.\n\nTwo weeks after the Bora Bora ceremony, they announced their separation. Since the marriage wasn't legally binding, they didn't have to go through the process of getting a divorce — they just had to call off any plans for a legal ceremony in the US.\n\nMario Lopez and Ali Landry's Marriage, 18 days\n\nMario Lopez and Ali Landry's marriage garnered considerable media attention thanks to its rapid unraveling. After six years of dating, the couple tied the knot with a lavish ceremony in Mexico on April 24, 2004. However, their short celebrity marriage came to an abrupt end just two weeks later when Landry filed for an annulment.\n\nThe reason for the dissolution of their relationship stemmed from reports of infidelity on Lopez's part — including during his bachelor party weekend in Mexico. He admits to doing so in his memoir Just Between Us. \"I got inebriated and a little too friendly with a young lady,\" Lopez writes. \"When it was time to return home, lightning hit me with the truth: I wasn't in love. But I walked down the aisle. Ali was hurt and angry, rightfully so.\"\n\nJeremy Thomas and Drew Barrymore's Marriage, 39 days\n\nAfter just six weeks of dating, Jeremy Thomas and Drew Barrymore tied the knot in March 1994 when Barrymore was just 19 years old. Thomas, who was 31 at the time, owned a bar in LA.\n\nThirty-nine days after their wedding, Barrymore filed for divorce and their marriage was officially dissolved in April 1994. The reasons behind their swift split were not extensively disclosed, but it was widely reported that the couple's personalities and lifestyles were incompatible — and because Barrymore was quite young when she said \"I do.\" Details aside, this stands as one of the shortest marriages in Hollywood.\n\nKris Humphries and Kim Kardashian's Marriage, 72 days\n\nAfter her marriage to Damon Thomas and before her nuptials to Kanye West, Kim Kardashian tied the knot with Kris Humphries on August 20, 2011. The extravagant ceremony was even televised as part of Kardashian's reality TV show, Keeping Up with the Kardashians. However, their marriage lasted only 72 days, as Kardashian filed for divorce on October 31, 2011, citing irreconcilable differences. (It's fair to say this short celebrity marriage is one of the most infamous in pop culture history.)\n\nThe nature of their marriage led to widespread speculation and criticism, with some accusing the couple of staging the wedding for publicity. Kardashian later explained that she had rushed into the marriage and realized it was a mistake on her honeymoon in Italy.\n\nLisa Marie Presley and Nicolas Cage's Marriage, 107 Days\n\nLisa Marie Presley and Nicolas Cage's wedding took place on August 10, 2002, during a ceremony held in Hawaii. This marriage was the third for Presley, the daughter of rock 'n' roll legend Elvis Presley, and the second for Cage.\n\nTheir relationship attracted significant media attention due to their high-profile status in the entertainment industry. However, their marriage lasted for only about three and a half months. Presley filed for divorce from Cage in November 2002, which was then finalized in May 2004.\n\nAmelia Warner and Colin Farrell's Marriage, 121 days\n\nThis short-lived celebrity marriage only lasted a matter of months. Amelia Warner and Colin Farrell wed in Tahiti during a secret ceremony in July 2001. However, their marriage quickly unraveled, and by November of the same year, they had already filed for divorce.\n\n\"Too fast, too young,\" Farrell said of his brief marriage to Warner, although the details of their separation have not been extensively discussed publicly by either of them.\n\nPamela Anderson and Kid Rock's Marriage, 122 days\n\nPamela Anderson and Kid Rock were married on July 29, 2006 in a picturesque ceremony aboard a yacht in Saint-Tropez, France. They filed for divorce in November 2006, less than four months after their wedding.\n\nAnderson's role in the movie Borat brought attention to their tumultuous union, particularly when he left her stranded at the film's premiere. That seemed like a tipping point for their relationship, though the exact reasons behind their divorce seem to have been a culmination of disagreements and incompatibilities.\n\nBradley Cooper and Jennifer Esposito's Marriage, 122 days\n\nBradley Cooper and Jennifer Esposito's marriage was relatively short-lived, lasting only for about four months. They married in December 2006, but on May 1, 2007, Esposito filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences.\n\nKenny Chesney and Renee Zellweger's Marriage, 128 days\n\nThe country music superstar and the Oscar-winning actress said \"I do\" in a private ceremony on the Caribbean island of St. John in May 2005. In September of the same year, they filed for an annulment, citing \"fraud\" as the reason for the dissolution of their marriage.\n\nThe use of that term in their annulment filing sparked intense speculation, leading to considerable media attention. However, both Chesney and Zellweger clarified that the term was a legal formality and not indicative of any wrongdoing or misconduct on either party's part.\n\nCarmen Electra and Dennis Rodman's Marriage, 129 days\n\nActress Carmen Electra and NBA star Dennis Rodman's brief marriage took place in November 1998. They took a spontaneous trip to Las Vegas, where they decided to swap vows at the iconic Little Chapel of the Flowers.\n\nThe short celebrity marriage nearly ended nine days later with an annulment, but they managed to make it work a little longer — at least until March 1999, when they officially filed for divorce.\n\nTom Green and Drew Barrymore's Marriage, 163 days\n\nDrew Barrymore and her second husband, Tom Green, first met in 1999. They announced their engagement in July 2000 and were married in a private ceremony on July 7, 2001.\n\nTheir marital bliss was fleeting, however, as they separated just a few months later in December 2001. The reasons for their split were not extensively elaborated upon by either party, but it appeared that the demands of their respective careers, coupled with the fast pace of their courtship, had taken a toll on their relationship.\n\nSophia Bush and Chad Michael Murray's Marriage, 163 days\n\nThe two actors, best known for their roles on the popular teen series One Tree Hill began dating in 2003 and quickly became one of Hollywood's hottest young couples. Their on-screen chemistry as Brooke Davis and Lucas Scott translated into a real-life romance, and they got engaged in May 2004.\n\nSophia Bush and Chad Michael Murray tied the knot on April 16, 2005, in a glamorous ceremony. But just five months later, in September 2005, Bush filed for an annulment, citing \"fraud\" as the reason for the dissolution of their marriage. The annulment was granted, and the couple's divorce was finalized in December 2006.\n\nColton Haynes and Jeff Leatham's Marriage, 193 days\n\nColton Haynes and Jeff Leatham embarked on a high-profile romance that culminated in a lavish wedding in October 2017. Their nuptials, held at a Palm Springs resort and attended by numerous celebrity guests, were marked by extravagant floral arrangements, opulent decorations and a ceremony officiated by Kris Jenner.\n\nTheir union took a dramatic turn shortly after their wedding when rumors of trouble in paradise began to circulate. In early 2018, Haynes filed for divorce from Leatham, just six months after saying \"I do.\"\n\nTom D'agostino and Luann de Lessep's Marriage, 216 days\n\nTom D'agostino and Luann de Lesseps were married on December 31, 2016, in a lavish New Year's Eve wedding in Palm Beach, Florida. Despite this, their marriage quickly ran into problems. Rumors of infidelity and disagreements about D'Agostino's behavior, particularly regarding his interactions with other women, started circulating even before their nuptials.\n\nTheir tumultuous relationship was a focal point on Bravo's reality TV series The Real Housewives of New York City, on which Lesseps was a cast member. The show captured various moments of conflict and tension between the couple. Seven months after their wedding, Lesseps announced their separation and filed for divorce in August 2017, making this one of the shortest celebrity marriages ever.\n\nCris Judd and Jennifer Lopez's Marriage, 218 days\n\nThis couple met in 2000 when Cris Judd was hired as a backup dancer for Jennifer Lopez's music video \"Love Don't Cost a Thing.\" Their professional relationship soon turned romantic, leading to a surprise wedding in September 2001 (just a few months after Lopez's breakup with Sean Combs).\n\nJudd and Lopez's relationship faced significant challenges from the start, and after less than a year of marriage, they announced their separation. The couple cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for their split.\n\nMiley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth's Marriage, roughly 240 days\n\nWhy did Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth break up? Well, the two first met while filming The Last Song in 2009 and began an on-again, off-again relationship throughout the decade that followed.\n\nThe couple got engaged for the first time in 2012 but called off the engagement a year later. They reconciled in 2015 and became engaged once again, and finally tied the knot on December 23, 2018, with an intimate wedding ceremony at their home in Tennessee.\n\nUnfortunately, this became another short-lived celebrity marriage; they announced their separation just eight months after their wedding, in August 2019. Neither Cyrus or Hemsworth made statements on why they broke up, but Hemsworth did post to Instagram with this caption: \"Hi all. Just a quick note to say that Miley and I have recently separated and I wish her nothing but health and happiness going forward. This is a private matter and I have not made, nor will I be making, any comments to any journalists or media outlets. Any reported quotes attributed to me are false. Peace and Love.\"\n\nJim Carrey and Lauren Holly's Marriage, 309 days\n\nActors Jim Carrey and Lauren Holly met while working on the film Dumb and Dumber, and they quickly developed a romantic relationship. They got married on September 23, 1996, in a private, mountain-top ceremony in Malibu, California.\n\nUnfortunately, their marriage faced challenges and after less than a year together, they decided to part ways. Jim Carrey and Lauren Holly filed for divorce in July 1997 and their divorce was finalized later that year in December.\n\nElisabeth Moss and Fred Armisen's Marriage, 312 days\n\nElisabeth Moss and Fred Armisen got married in October 2009, but by June 2010, they had separated, and their divorce was finalized in May 2011.\n\nIn interviews, Moss has hinted at the difficulties they faced as a couple, with the intense scrutiny of their relationship by the media adding further strain. She said, \"Looking back, I feel like I was really young, and at the time I didn't think that I was that young.\" She added, \"It was extremely traumatic and awful and horrible.\"\n\nOjani Noa and Jennifer Lopez's Marriage, 313 days\n\nOjani Noa and Jennifer Lopez were married in February 1997, just a year after Lopez's breakthrough role in the movie Selena. The marriage, which was Lopez's first, faced various challenges, including reported conflicts over Noa's desire to launch a career in the entertainment industry.\n\nTheir union lasted less than a year, with Lopez filing for divorce in January 1998. The settlement reportedly included a confidentiality agreement that prohibited Noa from discussing their relationship or marriage publicly. However, in the years that followed, Noa attempted to release a movie that allegedly contained private and intimate footage of Lopez, which prompted legal battles and restraining orders from Jennifer Lopez to prevent their publication.\n\nCorey Bohan and Audrina Patridge's Marriage, 319 days\n\nCorey Bohan and Audrina Patridge, known for their appearances on the reality TV show The Hills, began dating in 2008 and got engaged in November 2015. They tied the knot in a picturesque Hawaiian ceremony in November 2016.\n\nIn September 2017, Patridge filed for a restraining order against Bohan, alleging emotional abuse and claiming that he was increasingly hostile towards her. She also accused him of endangering their daughter, Kirra. The restraining order was granted, and Bohan was ordered to stay away from both Patridge and Kirra.\n\nTheir divorce was finalized in December 2018, with Patridge gaining full custody of their daughter.\n\nSophia Bush and Grant Hughe's Marriage, 381 days\n\nAfter a year-long engagement, Sophia Bush and Grant Hughes tied the knot on June 11, 2022 at the City County Clerk's Office in Tulsa, Oklahoma. But 16 days after celebrating their one year anniversary as a married couple, Bush filed for divorce from Hughes.\n\nA source told PEOPLE, \"Sophia and Grant were friends for 10 years and bonded during COVID through their love of community service,\" and that \"they continue to run their nonprofit together and remain good friends.\"\n\nBritney Spears and Sam Asghari's Marriage, 414 days\n\nBritney Spears and Sam Asghari started dating shortly after meeting on the set of her \"Slumber Party\" music video in 2016. They announced their engagement in September 2021 and held a ceremony inside Spears' Los Angeles home on June 9, 2022. Jason Alexander, who Spears was married to for a mere 55 hours back in 2004, actually tried to crash their wedding and was arrested."
