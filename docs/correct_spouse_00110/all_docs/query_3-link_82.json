        "text": "People Post\n\nShe annulled her first marriage just two weeks after the wedding because her husband had cheated, and Ali Landry wasn’ t about to make the same mistake a second time around.\n\nThe 38-year-old actress revealed that she waited until her wedding night to sleep with second spouse Alejandro Monteverde. The former Miss USA made the announcement last week on Wendy Williams’ talk show. She looked simple yet summery in blue jeans, green wedges, a white blazer and a lemon yellow shirt as she made her revelation. Mario Lopez’s ex-wife said: “Because of the situation I was in before, I was just treading lightly, and did not want to make any mistakes in this relationship. We abstained from having sex until we got married.” She cites her two-week marriage to Extra host Lopez as the catalyst for her decision to wait. She revealed: “I had heard something right before the wedding. (Mario) swore that it was not true, but I had that feeling in my gut. All of my family was flying in — it was a destination wedding — and I really should have put the brakes on it at that point, but I was afraid.” She says that a friend’s phone-tapping skills led her to realise Lopez was being unfaithful. “I was like, ‘I don’t want to tap a phone! I can’t believe I’m doing this.’ (But) she did, and right after the honeymoon I started getting phone calls from these girls. I confronted him and he still — to this day — denied it and never apologised. It was horrible.” She then sought solace in religion, which led her to Monteverde. The Hollywood Girls Night star said: “I met my husband at a theology class in LA — who knew? He was the person I was meant to be with.” The two wed in 2006 and have two children together, 4-year-old Estela and 5-month-old Marcelo.\n\n— Daily Mail\n\nPulling no punches!\n\nHer divorce from Russell Brand has dominated headlines, and the pairs’ individual reactions to the break-up have been documented at every painful turn.\n\nFollowing reports surfacing of Russell making a return to his former Lothario ways, Katy appears to have gone into army-mode, and a clip from her forthcoming video for the single Part Of Me shows an unfamiliar side of the star. Wearing full camouflage and face paint, Katy is seen being pulled to the ground and wrestling in the mud. At one point the Teenage Dream singer is seen struggling underwater with a fellow ‘soldier’. Katy is seen sporting tomboyish short dark hair, a departure from her usual colourful locks. Speculation had surrounded the singer’s new single Part of Me, which she performed at the Grammys and appeared to be about estranged husband Russell Brand. With lyrics like, “You can keep the diamond ring — it don’t mean nothing anyway,” many people believed that the song was aimed at the British comedian. However, the 27-year-old has insisted that the track was written years before she even married Russell and their on-going divorce proceedings have nothing to do with the song, despite their obvious relevance. Katy said: “I wrote Part of Me two years ago and I always knew that Part of Me was a special song. It feels like my life plays out with these songs. I feel like I’m in some kind of weird Truman Show where I’m like, ‘Why is this single appropriate now and it wouldn’t have been appropriate then?’ It’s just so crazy.”\n\n— Daily Mail\n\nKeith Richards apologises to Mick Jagger\n\nKeith Richards has apologised to bandmate Mick Jagger and admitted some parts of his autobiography L i f e “really offended” the singer.\n\nThe guitarist described the frontman as “unbearable” and revealed his nicknames for Jagger are ‘Brenda’ and ‘Your Majesty’ in the candid memoir published in 2010. Richards said: “He and I have had conversations over the last year of a kind we have not had for an extremely long time and that has been incredibly important to me. As far as the book goes, it was my story and it was very raw, as I meant it to be, but I know that some parts of it and some of the publicity really offended Mick and I regret that.” Referring to an early chance encounter with Jagger when the pair bonded over a love of the blues, Richards said: “What some of our detractors forget is that although we look like old codgers living an ocean apart we are still at bottom the boys on platform three at Dartford Station.” Speaking in New York for an interview to promote a new documentary about the band, Jagger said the pair had a period in the 1980s when they ‘were not communicating very well.’ He said: “I got very involved with the business side of the Stones, mainly because I felt no one else was interested, but it’s plain now from the book that Keith felt excluded, which is a pity. Time, I reckon, to move on.”\n\n— Daily Mail"
