Lopez was raised in a large Catholic family. His parents are both emigrants from Mexico, his father born in Culiacán, Sinaloa, and his mother in Tijuana, Territorio Norte de Baja California.[3][4] Lopez was a child prodigy and started to dance at age three, training in tap and jazz.[5] He also did tumbling, karate and wrestling at his local Boys and Girls Club when he was 7 years old,[6] which he excelled at as well as other things his mother put him in.[7] During his acting career, he was an amateur wrestler for Chula Vista at the weight class of 160 lbs, and was also in his high school wrestling team, placing 2nd in the San Diego Section and 7th in the state of California in his senior year while attending Chula Vista High School, where he graduated in 1991.\n\nCareer[]\n\nEarly career[]\n\nLopez was discovered by a talent agent at a dance recital when he was 10 years old. He got into local ads and commercials before making TV appearances.[8]\n\nActing[]\n\nLopez began acting in 1984 when he appeared as younger brother Tomás in the short-lived ABC comedy series a.k.a. Pablo.[9] That same year, he was cast as a drummer and dancer on Kids Incorporated for three seasons. In March 1987, he was cast as a guest star on the sitcom The Golden Girls as a Latino boy named Mario who faces deportation. He was cast in a small part in the movie Colors (1988) as Felipe's friend.

Slater in Peacock's sequel series, Saved by the Bell.[17] In December 2020, Lopez starred as Colonel Sanders in A Recipe for Seduction, a short film from Lifetime and KFC.[18][19]\n\nDancing with the Stars[]\n\nIn the fall of 2006, Lopez signed on as a contestant on the third season of Dancing with the Stars on ABC with professional partner and then-girlfriend Karina Smirnoff who was making her series debut. They finished in second place, losing to the team of Emmitt Smith and Cheryl Burke.\n\nHosting duties[]\n\nIn 1992, he hosted his first series on NBC, called Name Your Adventure.
