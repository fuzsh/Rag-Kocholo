        "text": "Ali Landry revealed Thursday that she and husband Alejandro Monteverde didn't have sex before their April 2006 wedding -- all because her ex-husband Mario Lopez had cheated on her.\n\nLandry told Wendy Williams that the infidelity -- which she learned about after tapping Lopez's phone line -- left her so scarred that she refused to bed her director husband prior to saying \"I do.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Because of the situation I was in before, I was just treading lightly, and did not want to make any mistakes in this relationship,\" the 38-year-old actress told Williams. \"We abstained from having sex until we got married.\"\n\nLandry and first-husband Lopez married in 2004 after six years of dating, but weeks into the marriage, Landry filed to annul the marriage amid tabloid reports that Lopez had cheated on her at his bachelor party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLopez's responses to the rumors have changed over time. In October 2006, the \"Extra\" host deemed the allegations \"definitely not true.\" But in February 2011, Lopez confessed to cheating on Landry days before their wedding, telling Howard Stern that he \"messed around\" with another woman.\n\nIn January 2012, Lopez announced his engagement to Courtney Mazza, the mother of his two-year-old daughter Gia.\n\nAdvertisement"
