        "text": "What Happens in Vegas\n\nCarmen Electra, a former Baywatch bombshell, and NBA star Dennis Rodman made the classic Vegas mistake and eloped after a drunken night out. At the ceremony, Rodman was apparently heavily intoxicated. The starlet and the basketball player were married for nine whole days before they filed for an annulment.\n\nRecently on Oprah, Carmen called Dennis a “gentle giant,” and talked about how their relationship was great when it was good, but “the worst” when it was bad. Carmen also expressed her feelings that “It’s too easy to get married in Vegas”, and “It’s too convenient.” The couple parted as friends.\n\nTexting Goodbye\n\nPop singer Katy Perry and actor and comedian Russell Brand had an extravagant wedding, even for celeb standards. The ceremony took place in India, and the couple flew their family and friends to join in a traditional Hindu wedding. But sadly, the romance was short-lived. Katy was touring when Russell scandalously let her know via text that he wanted a divorce. This was all filmed in real-time as part of Katy’s documentary film “Part of Me”.\n\nRussell then released his own documentary, where he claimed he had known that he might have to leave Katy in order to be happy. He had taken a trip to Africa and seen the living conditions there and came home realizing that the “vapid” pop star lifestyle didn’t suit him. The entire marriage lasted a little over a year.\n\nSweet Child Not Mine\n\nAxl Rose, lead singer of legendary 80’s rock n’ roll band Guns N’ Roses, was known for his turbulent relationships with women, and his time with Erin Everly, a model, and daughter of one of the Everly Brothers, fits into the same pattern. Despite the fact that Erin was the inspiration for the rock ballad “Sweet Child of Mine,” the couple had a stormy relationship.\n\nAxl and Erin dated off and on for four years and tied the knot in 1990, but Axl filed for divorce only four months later.\n\nOver Before It Even Began\n\nZsa Zsa Gabor was a famous and successful actress but she is also famous for having one of the shortest celebrity marriages in Hollywood history. Zsa Zsa was married an astounding nine times, seven of which ended in divorce. But her shortest marriage was actually annulled. Zsa Zsa wed character actor and attorney Felipe De Alba, in Mexico, in 1983, but the marriage was declared invalid after only one day!\n\nIt turns out that Zsa Zsa’s previous divorce had not been officially finalized. You really would expect an attorney to read all the fine print before tying the knot.\n\nA Compromising Photo\n\nActor and TV host Mario Lopez and model and actress Ali Landry dated for six years before deciding to settle down. The ceremony took place in 2004, in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Right after the wedding, Ali’s sister showed her a compromising photo of her new husband with another woman.\n\nAli confronted Mario and he admitted that his bachelor party had gotten wild and rowdy, and he had strayed. Mario reveals the whole story in his memoir “Just Between Us.” He felt that Ali looked “good on paper” but that he wasn’t really in love with her. Just two weeks after the marriage ceremony, Ali Landry filed for divorce.\n\nMarried Only for a Single Day\n\nActress Robin Givens is widely known for her first rocky and short-lived one-year marriage to boxer Mike Tyson. However, it was her second marriage that really had fans shocked!\n\nRobin wed her tennis instructor, Svetozar Marinkovic. Their marriage lasted only for a single day! Robin ended things only 24 hours after the ceremony, even if it took her a few months to officially file for divorce.\n\nThe Princess of Pop\n\nAnother Jackson superstar, Michael, Janet’s brother, had his own short marriage to another celebrity who had a few short marriages of her own under her belt. Michael Jackson married the late Lisa Marie Presley, Elvis’ daughter, in a secret ceremony in the Dominican Republic. The wedding took place only months after Lisa Marie’s previous divorce from musician Danny Keogh was finalized.\n\nTheir relationship lasted for less than two years. In the end, Lisa Marie petitioned for divorce in January 1996, on the grounds of irreconcilable differences. Later on, she was quoted as saying that she “wanted to save” Michael. Due to the location and the secrecy around the wedding, questions have been raised regarding its legitimacy.\n\nA Real Life 90210 Drama\n\nShannen Doherty has also had more than her share of short-lived marriages. Like most of us, she probably wanted her first marriage to last a lifetime. Unfortunately, her marriage to Ashley Hamilton, son of actor George Hamilton, only lasted for about six months. The couple wed on October 11, 1993, in the backyard of Shannen’s house.\n\nThe bride reportedly wore a white silk robe and was barefoot. The couple filed for divorce in April of the following year. After her marriage to Ashley went bad, Shannen went on to have a relationship with another celebrity with a bad reputation for making marriages last...\n\nBaywatch Bombshell and a Scandalous Star\n\nThe “Baywatch” bombshell, Pamela Anderson, wed Rick Salomon, widely known as the guy from Paris Hilton’s infamous sex tape, in October 2007. The wedding took place in Vegas and the marriage was over in less than ten weeks.\n\nPamela filed for divorce only two months after their Vegas nuptials. As has become familiar by now, her reasons were “irreconcilable differences.” Marriage really seems to highlight those, right? Surprisingly Pamela and Rick married again in 2014 and filed for divorce again in 2015. The reason? You guessed it, irreconcilable differences.\n\nHotel Heiress and The Businessman Strike Out\n\nNicky Hilton, celebutante and \"Hilton\" hotel heiress married businessman Todd Andrew Meister in August 2004. Todd is 13 years older than Nicky and she described him as more of a friend than anything else, which is probably why the pair filed for an annulment only a few months after the wedding.\n\nNicky has found love again with the heir of the famous and fabulously wealthy Rothschild Family. The happy couple is married are now expecting their third child together.\n\nQuickie Marriages Don't Last\n\nRick Salomon is undeniably an expert on short-term marriages. This shared experience could be what brought Rick and Shannen Doherty together. The pair married in 2002, but the honeymoon period didn’t last for too long. The couple decided to go their separate ways after only nine months.\n\nIt’s unclear which of Salomon’s relationships is the most outrageous. His infamous sex tape with Paris Hilton? His two marriages and divorces from Pamela Anderson? Or his nine-month marriage to Shannen Doherty?\n\nA Broken Marriage\n\nActor Charlie Sheen and model Donna Peele C met when they both starred in a cigarette commercial. Sheen was clearly smitten with her when he said, “She’s an angel sent from heaven to take me through the rest of my journey.” The couple tied the knot on Charlie’s birthday in 1995 after six weeks of dating (this should've been a red flag).\n\nThe marriage only lasted five months. When asked about the divorce, Sheen said, “You buy a bad car, it breaks down.” That guy is a real charmer!\n\nA Rebound Marriage\n\nCher, famous for her marriage and partnership with Sonny Bono, married singer Gregg Allman of the Allman Brothers only days after her divorce from Sonny came through, leaving behind many teary-eyed “I Got You Babe” fans. It seems like Cher didn’t know her new husband very well because only days after the wedding, the raven-haired singer decided to pull the plug.\n\nCher filed for divorce nine days after the wedding citing her husband’s problems with drugs and alcohol as the cause for the split.\n\nBarely Lasted the Honeymoon\n\nSinead O'Connor was famous for her failed marriages. Her fourth marriage to Barry Herridge is especially notable as it only lasted as long as the honeymoon.\n\nThe pair met online when Sinead was seeking suitors, and they seemed happy at the wedding, but their life as a married couple was only 16 days long.\n\nYoung Love Wasn't Enough\n\nOne of Janet Jackson's earliest scandals involved her childhood sweetheart James DeBarge. The pair eloped when she was just 18 years old!\n\nFor whatever reason, the marriage was short-lived. Janet and James divorced after only four months and the marriage was later annulled. Over the years there have been persistent rumors that the couple had a daughter and secretly gave her up for adoption.\n\nA Rock N’ Roll Wedding\n\nWhen a former Playmate and a rock country star decide to get married, it’s no wonder the whole thing turns into, as one wedding guest said, “a real rock n’ roll wedding.” The nuptials took place on a yacht and the bride wore a white string bikini and a sailor’s cap and the groom wore a white t-shirt and a dazed grin.\n\nUnfortunately, the couple could not make it work and on Thanksgiving of the same year, they both raced to the courthouse to file for divorce.\n\nToo Young for Marriage\n\nBritish actress Amelia Warner started seeing Irish actor Colin Farrell when she was only 18. At the time, Hollywood was rife with rumors that the couple was married. The pair did share a romantic beach-side ceremony in Tahiti and Colin had Amelia’s nickname Millie tattooed on his ring finger as a sign of commitment. Later on, both Colin and Amelia were quoted saying that the ceremony was lovely but they both knew that it was not a real wedding.\n\nEither way, despite the sweet love story, the relationship soon fell apart. Only six months after their pretend (or real, depending on who you ask) wedding, the pair split for good. Amelia later married “50 Shades of Grey” actor Jamie Dornan and they have two children.\n\n24-Hour Wedding Hotline\n\nWhile still a teenager, Drew Barrymore married 32-year-old Jeremy Thomas, a Los Angeles bar owner originally from Wales. At the time of the wedding, the two had only known each other for six weeks.\n\nThe couple was married only slightly longer than they dated. 19-year-old Drew and her beau used a 24-hour wedding hotline to find someone to officiate and came up with a minister/psychic/private investigator – probably not the best start for a marriage. The couple filed for divorce only 39 days later.\n\nA Stab in the Back\n\nSophia Bush and Chad Michael Murray met and fell in love on the set of the hit teen TV drama “One Tree Hill.” They got married by the sea, in Santa Monica, California in 2005. But just like their characters on TV, these two couldn’t seem to make it work. Rumors of Chad’s infidelity ran rampant (allegedly he had an affair with Paris Hilton), and Sophia filed for an annulment based on fraud.\n\nThe annulment wasn’t granted, and their divorce was finalized less than a year later. The entire marriage lasted only five months. Afterward, when Sophia was asked if she and Chad still talk, she replied, “My mother once said to me that if you don’t have anything nice to say, not to say anything at all.”\n\nA Terrible Husband\n\n\"The Handmaid's Tale\" and “Mad Men” star Elisabeth Moss has been very vocal about her 8-month unhappy and \"traumatizing\" marriage to \"SNL\" alum and comedian Fred Armisen.\n\nFred talked to Howard Stern about the one-year marriage and described himself as a “terrible husband.” And also answered “yes, there’s that” when questioned about his problems with monogamy. His response seems to give an indication as to why the marriage soured.\n\nThe Most Expensive Divorce Ever\n\nMusic superstar Janet Jackson and Qatari billionaire Wissam Al Mana married in secret in 2012. This was Jackson’s third marriage and the first in which she had a child. After Janet gave birth to their son, Eissa, in January 2017. The couple announced their separation just a few months later.\n\nIn an interesting coincidence, it is rumored that if their marriage lasted for five years, Janet was set to receive $100 million and another $100 for bearing a child.\n\nToo Goofy for Marriage\n\nFamous actress Drew Barrymore and somewhat famous actor and comedian Tom Green didn’t think getting married was serious business. Their original idea was to get married on the comedy show “Saturday Night Live.” Tom asked Drew to marry him in a skit at the start of the show and she said yes. Drew is known as kind of a free spirit and Tom is known for being strange, so the whole thing didn’t seem so out there.\n\nBy the time the end of the show came around, Drew had a change of heart and decided she didn’t want to get married on live television. The two were engaged for a year and finally eloped to the South Pacific in March 2001. After less than a year of marriage, Tom filed for divorce, stating that he “wished it could have worked out.”\n\nA Lavish Affair\n\nParis Hilton was not the first Hilton to know her way around a scandal. Her grandfather, hotel heir, and Hollywood playboy Conrad “Nicky” Hilton, married movie star legend Elizabeth Taylor when the actress was just 18 years old. MGM paid for the wedding and it was a lavish affair with 600 guests and many of Hollywood’s elite in attendance. The marriage fell apart in less than a year, which included a three-month-long European honeymoon.\n\nIn court, a young Liz threw all the blame on Nicky and accused him of being verbally abusive. Later she would say that the marriage had been a mistake and that she was “very naïve.” Taylor did not give up on love and went on to get married seven more times over the years.\n\nShameless Secret Wedding\n\nEmmy Rossum, of \"Shameless\" fame, has some wild secrets in her past. She wed music executive Justin Siegel when she was just 22 years old. The pair decided to pretend that they were dating, but keep their marriage a secret to keep it out of the public eye. Despite this tactic, or maybe because of it, the marriage was not built to last.\n\nAfter tying the knot on February 17, 2008, Justin filed for divorce just nineteen months later, on September 25, 2009, the reason being of course - irreconcilable differences.\n\nPractice Makes Perfect?\n\nEthel Merman is a classic Hollywood icon, widely known for starring in musical pictures that highlighted her impressive vocal range. The musical legend married her suitor, actor Ernest Borgnine, in 1964 in the garden of his house. Relationship problems are nothing new and celebrities had a hard time staying together even in the golden age of Hollywood. For Ethel, this was marriage number five and for Ernest number six!\n\nUnfortunately, this marriage didn’t last either. Only 32 days after they tied the knot, the couple petitioned for divorce, leaving Ernest Borgnine divorced six times over. Years later Borgnine jokingly talked about the marriage, “If you blinked, you missed it ...”\n\nPop Goes Your Marriage!\n\nWorld-famous pop icon Britney Spears and her non-famous friend, Jason Alexander, were married for an incredible 55 hours! Britney impulsively wed her childhood friend after a few drinks on a night out in Vegas. The marriage was promptly annulled.\n\nThe real issue was that the drunken duo hadn’t signed a prenup and Britney was worth millions. Britney refers to the marriage as a “joke that went too far.” Britney recently wed Sam Asghari, reportedly with an Iron-clad prenup! Unfortunately, Alexander crashed the wedding but was quickly whisked away by security!\n\nDon't Be Fooled by Big Rocks\n\nShe might still be Jenny from the block, but J-Lo has been around the block more than once. Though her marriage to Cris Judd was quite a quick affair, her first marriage lasted slightly longer. Jennifer married Cuban waiter Ojani Noa in 1997. The marriage lasted for 13 months and fell apart when Jennifer’s career started taking off. But still, a year is a long time in celebrity terms.\n\nOjani was very unhappy when the marriage ended. He has repeatedly threatened to release an intimate video from the couple’s Cuban honeymoon. That is an awful thing to do, but jealousy and heartbreak can make people act crazy.\n\nAin’t No Sunshine When She’s Gone\n\n\"SNL\" cast member and comedian Chris Kattan started dating model Sunshine Tutt after the two met at a birthday party. They were married in June of that year and were divorced after only two months!\n\nThe reason for the split was unclear, although there are allegations of cheating placed against both husband and wife. After the separation, Sunshine’s grandmother was quoted as saying she thought they were good together, even though she “never understood what she (Sunshine) saw in him, but that didn’t matter to us.” Way to stick it to him, grandma.\n\nA Bad Attempt at Humor\n\nMovie star Dennis Hopper has one of the strangest short marriage stories in the history of Hollywood. In the early ’70s, Dennis was living the hippie lifestyle in a compound in Taos. Singer Michelle Phillips of the Mamas and Papas came for a visit, and the two decided to get hitched then and there.\n\nWhen Dennis woke up the next morning the drug haze had worn off and he didn’t even recognize his new wife! The couple was married for eight days and when Michelle filed for divorce.\n\nIt Wasn’t Funny\n\nFamous comedian and actor Eddie Murphy married producer Tracey Edmonds on New Year’s Day 2008, in a sunset ceremony on a private island off Bora Bora in French Polynesia. Their married bliss was short-lived as the couple called the whole thing off just two weeks later.\n\nThe honeymoon was apparently no picnic with reports of Murphy raising his voice and embarrassing his new wife in public. When the couple returned to the states, they were happy that the ceremony wasn’t legally binding and went their separate ways.\n\nControlling and Unattractive\n\nActor and director Bradley Cooper and “NCIS” star Jennifer Esposito were married in the south of France in 2006, and Jennifer filed for divorce only four months later. They had dated for a year before getting engaged and got married two months later.\n\nJennifer released a tell-all book titled “Jennifer’s Way” in which she had a few choice words for her ex. She stated that she didn’t find Cooper to be very attractive, but that he was funny, cocky, arrogant, and fun to be around. She also called him a “master manipulator”, which made headlines in all the tabloids. Yikes!\n\nA Missed Step\n\nMulti-talented actress, dancer, and singer, Jennifer Lopez met Cris Judd when he was working as a backup dancer in her “Love Don’t Cost a Thing” music video. Cris, a professional dancer, and choreographer, danced his way into her heart and they were married only a few months after that first meeting. The couple’s timing may have been off because J-Lo had only recently ended her engagement to rapper and music producer Sean Combs.\n\nAfter only seven months the couple called it quits and filed for divorce. There are no hard feelings between them, and Jennifer has called Cris a “great guy”, and Cris, while talking to People magazine, said that Jen still “looks fantastic”, but their marriage “just didn’t work out.”\n\nNot Mad About You\n\nThis celebrity couple was together for five years before tying the knot, but their marriage was not as long as their courtship. Hollywood power couple Helen Hunt and Hank Azaria had a simple wedding with a traditional Jewish ceremony, at their California home on July 17, 1999.\n\nAlthough the couple had been together for years, it turned out that married life was not for them. After only a year of marriage, Hank moved out of their shared home. Six months later, Helen filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce was finalized on December 18, 2000, only a year and a half after the wedding.\n\nFrom a Cult Comedy to a Tragic Divorce\n\nComedian Jim Carrey and “NCIS” actress Lauren Holly shared a whirlwind marriage. The duo starred in the cult classic comedy film “Dumb and Dumber” and had such a great time together that they decided to get hitched. Unfortunately, the marriage was not a great success.\n\nThe couple wed on September 23, 1996, in an intimate mountain top ceremony, but less than one year later, in July 1997, Holly filed for divorce.\n\nCouldn't Keep Things at Bay\n\nThe relationship between the late Lisa Marie Presley, a singer and Elvis’ daughter, and Oscar-winning actor, Nicolas Cage, was dramatic right from the start. While sailing in Nick’s Yacht in July 2002, Lisa threw her $65,000 engagement ring into the ocean. They put the incident behind them and got married less than a month later in Hawaii.\n\nLisa looked beautiful in a traditional white dress but after only 102 days of marriage, Nick filed for divorce. The actor and singer didn’t have much in common and apparently couldn’t even decide on a place to live. Cage has since been heard saying that they should have never married in the first place.\n\nA Bogus Relationship?\n\nBeautiful reality star Kim Kardashian also had a relationship with an NBA player. Kim and Kris Humphries dated for less than a year before getting married in an extravagant televised wedding ceremony at a 20-million-dollar estate. Many people believed the wedding and the entire relationship were bogus and were just an excuse to get more publicity for Kim’s reality show, but both Kim and Kris claim that their love and marriage were the real deal.\n\nAfter a short and unhappy time (72 days to be exact) that can be viewed in detail on Kim’s reality show “Keeping Up with The Kardashians”, the couple decided to divorce. The marriage and divorce were wrapped up just in time for Kim to get engaged and marry famous singer Kanye West, who she has since filed for divorce from.\n\nAn Enormous Scandal\n\nRudolph Valentino was a famous silent movie star in Hollywood’s early days. Valentino and actress Jean Acker decided to get married after dating for only two months. Apparently, Acker quickly realized the impulsive marriage was a mistake. She even locked her new husband out of their hotel room on their wedding night and claimed that the marriage had never been consummated.\n\nValentino filed for divorce, but he didn’t even wait for it to be finalized before marrying costume designer Natacha Rambova. The second wedding led to an enormous scandal and Rudolph Valentino was even charged with bigamy. Jean Acker took the failed marriage in stride, and later had numerous relationships with female lovers.\n\nPetitioned for an Annulment\n\nDo you remember Aaliyah? The talented R&B singer whose career was cut tragically short when she died in a plane crash at the tender age of 22? Her talent and all too brief life have overshadowed a previous scandal involving singer R. Kelly. He and his protégé Aaliyah were married in a secret ceremony when Aaliyah was only 15.\n\nThe young singer claimed she was 18 on the marriage license. When her parents found out, they petitioned the court for an annulment claiming that the marriage was illegal and that Aaliyah was too young to consent. Afterward, the singer cut all ties with Kelly and refused to speak about him in interviews.\n\n\"F**king Disaster\"\n\nMiley Cyrus, the former Disney Darling turned pop star, and Liam Hemsworth, the Australian actor and less famous Hemsworth first met and fell in love in 2008 on the set of \"The Last Song.\"\n\nTheir young love blossomed into an 11-year rollercoaster romance. The perfect pop-culture pair EVENTUALLY tied the knot in 2018...Only to divorce a mere 9 months later. While it's still not entirely clear what broke -up the marriage, Miley has referred to the short-lived nuptials as a \"F**ing disaster.\"\n\nFour Month Marriage\n\nKenny Chesney and Renee Zellweger’s union was so short-lived that the bride literally forgot parts of it, commenting, “It’s a pretty big thing to forget, isn’t it?” The two first met at a tsunami relief fundraiser and got hitched not long after.\n\nUnfortunately, they ended up annulling their marriage four months after tying the knot. Chesney commented, “I didn’t have any clue as to what true marriage meant. I was so used to committing to one thing — music — and then I had to totally commit to a second thing — marriage.”\n\n6 Month Itch\n\nYou may know Colton Haynes from his role as Jackson Whittemore on \"Teen Wolf.\" You likely won't know Jeff Leatham, a florist, who popped the question, to which Haynes naturally said yes.\n\nThe couple tied the knot in 2017. Sadly, their relationship was short-lived. Fans noticed that Haynes had deleted all of his Instagram posts that featured Leathem, which is the modern marker of marriage troubles. Six months into their marriage, Haynes filed for divorce from Leatham.\n\nAudrina Patridge and Corey Bohan\n\n\"The Hills\" star Audrina Patridge and Australian BMX rider Corey Bohan began their rocky romance all the way back in 2008. The pair appeared to have more downs than ups over the years, including several public spats. Despite this, the two had a daughter together in 2016 and got hitched later that year.\n\nUnfortunately, they never made it to their first year wedding anniversary! Following ugly legal issues and ultimate divorce, Audrina proved to be better off alone. Fortunately, when it comes to co-parenting, \"The Hills\" star makes an effort to keep things \"kid-friendly.\"\n\nWiz-Wedding\n\nIn 2011, Model and activist Amber Rose and rapper Wiz Khalifa made their romance public with a splash...a \"Fader\" magazine photoshoot splash that is!\n\nRose and Khalifa said their I do's in 2013, the same year they had their son, Sebastian. However, their happy ending wasn't built to last.
