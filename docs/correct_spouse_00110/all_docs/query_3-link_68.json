        "text": "ACTOR Mario Lopez has been married to Courtney Laine Mazza since 2012.\n\nThe TV host will be taking over Al Roker's Rockefeller Christmas Tree Lighting duties this holiday season amid the 68-year-old's health battle.\n\nWho is Mario Lopez's wife, Courtney Laine Mazza?\n\nCourtney Laine Mazza is a dancer, actress, and producer.\n\nThe 40-year-old is best known for starring in the movie Pittsburgh and in the TV series, The Expanding Universe of Ashley Garcia.\n\nCourtney also co-hosts a radio show with her husband, Mario Lopez, where the two discuss pop culture and entertainment news.\n\nShe is relatively private about her personal life but does have a large following on Instagram - over 350k.\n\nThe actress often shares snippets of her marriage and home life with many fans complimenting her relationship with Mario.\n\nHow did Mario and Courtney meet and when did they get married?\n\nMario and Courtney met in the fall of 2008 when he was doing the Broadway production of A Chorus Line.\n\nThe two married four years later in a ceremony in Punta Mita among all their friends and family.\n\nTheir wedding was aired on TLC as a two-hour episode titled Mario & Courtney’s Wedding Fiesta, with their daughter Gia as the flower girl.\n\nMario revealed on his wedding day to PEOPLE magazine that he and Courtney could not wait to expand their family saying: “We’re working on that right after the wedding. We’ll wait for the guests to leave and then we’re getting right on that!”\n\nHow many kids does Mario Lopez have?\n\nMario and Courtney have three children: Gia, Dominic, and Santino Lopez.\n\nDuring quarantine, he revealed that they may have a fourth due to their active sex life.\n\nSpeaking to Page Six, he said: \"I will be very surprised if I don’t get another baby coming out of this.\n\n\"We keep busy in that department - but we also keep busy with the kids.\"\n\nMario went on to reveal how Courtney manages to get some time on her own away from him and the kids, explaining she \"finds different places to hide in the house.\"\n\nThe father of three shared a sweet picture of his children back in April playing at home captioned: \"These kids keep me sane during our 'Shelter In Place.' If lucky was a picture, this would be it... #LopezFamBam.\"\n\nHas Mario been married before?\n\nThe Saved by the Bell star was previously married to actress Ali Landry.\n\nThe two dated for six years and married in April of 2004 in a Catholic ceremony at the Las Alamandas resort outside Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.\n\nTheir marriage was annulled two weeks later, with Mario confessing on the Howard Stern show that he cheated on her during his bachelor party, according to Us Weekly.\n\n\"It was my bachelor party,\" Mario said, adding that he had been \"bouncing around\" Mexico with his cousins.\n\n\"I had no business of being in that position,\" he added.\n\nHe elaborated a bit on the fling saying: \"It was spring break….everybody was hanging out. That was a situation where I was not mature and man enough.\"\n\nThe star was caught by an onlooker poolside with the woman in question and leaked the photo, which his future wife’s sister got a hold of.\n\n\"I was wrong for obviously lying, and I shouldn't have been in that position,\" he said.\n\nFinally, Ali confronted him and Mario confessed he was not ready to be serious saying: \"I dealt with all this drama, and then at that point just realize…I finally got the balls to say 'Hey, listen I'm not ready for this, I'm sorry.'\"\n\nThe two went their separate ways and Mario moved on to date his Dancing With the Stars partner and professional dancer, Karina Smirnoff.\n\nMario and Karina ended things in 2008 and he then met Courtney."
