        "text": "What is Mario Lopez's Net Worth and Salary?\n\nMario Lopez is an American actor, television host, and spokesman who has a net worth of $35 million. Even decades after the show debuted, Mario Lopez is probably still best known for his portrayal of A.C. Slater on the popular 1990s television show, \"Saved by the Bell.\" His early foray into the entertainment industry began with local theater productions and television commercials, eventually leading to guest appearances on television shows. Lopez's breakthrough role as A.C. Slater catapulted him to fame, and he quickly became a beloved figure in American pop culture.\n\nAfter \"Saved by the Bell\" ended, Lopez continued his acting career, appearing in various television shows and movies. In the mid-2000s, he transitioned to hosting, eventually landing the role of host for the entertainment news show \"Extra.\" Lopez's charisma, charm, and warm personality made him a natural fit for hosting, and he has since enjoyed a successful career as a television personality. He hosted \"Extra\" for over a decade before jumping to \"Access Hollywood\" in July 2019. Mario has also hosted \"The X Factor,\" \"Dancing with the Stars,\" and various awards shows.\n\nOutside of his professional life, Lopez is a dedicated husband and father, often sharing his love for his family on social media. He is also a fitness enthusiast and author, having published several books on health, fitness, and his personal life experiences. He also hosts a radio show and appears in many infomercial-type endorsements.\n\nSalary\n\nAt the peak of his time hosting \"Extra,\" Mario's annual salary was $6 million. In July 2019, he left \"Extra\" for rival \"Access Hollywood\" and, in doing so, received a salary bump to $8 million per year.\n\nEarly Life\n\nMario Lopez Jr. was born on October 10th, 1973, in San Diego. Mario was raised in a Catholic Mexican family along with his younger sister. Described as a \"child prodigy,\" Mario displayed considerable talent as a young child, and he had learned tap and jazz dance styles by the age of 3. He also explored pursuits such as karate and wrestling at the age of 7.\n\nIt soon became clear that he excelled at virtually anything his parents encouraged him to do – including acting. While he was starting his career as a child actor, Mario Lopez also became a competitive wrestler. In his senior year of high school in 1991, Mario Lopez placed second in San Diego and seventh in California during wrestling championships.\n\nEarly Acting Career\n\nMario Lopez was quickly snapped up by an acting agent at the age of 10. His various talents – particularly in dance – made him an obvious choice for commercials and advertisements. Prior to achieving success in television, a young Mario Lopez booked countless commercial roles.\n\nAt age 11, Mario Lopez booked his first major acting role with a.k.a. Pablo. The comedic series was soon canceled, but Lopez went on to star in Youth Incorporated, showing off his drumming and dancing skills for three seasons. Another early role came in 1987 when he played a Latino boy in The Golden Girls. In '88, Mario Lopez appeared in the critically acclaimed film Colors as a member of a Hispanic gang.\n\nLopez's biggest role during this period came in 1989 when he booked the role of A.C. Slater in Saved by the Bell. Slater proved to be a popular character among fans of the show and Saved by the Bell reached millions of people around the world. Mario Lopez made his mark on the entertainment world during this period and appeared on the show for the next five years.\n\nAfter Saved by the Bell ended in 1993, Mario Lopez took a hiatus before returning to acting in 1997 with a television movie called \"Breaking the Surface: The Greg Louganis Story,\" in which he played Olympian Greg Louganis.\n\nHis next recurring television role came in 1998 with Pacific Blue, although the series was canceled two seasons later. In 2006, Mario Lopez experienced further success after booking the role of Dr. Christian Ramirez on the soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful.\n\nMuch of Mario Lopez's television career has been defined by notable guest-starring roles. Early in his career, he appeared on shows like Ressurection Blvd., Eve, and The Bad Girls Guide. He also made an impact with a guest-starring role on the fourth season of Nip/Tuck. In 2006, he made a memorable appearance on George Lopez as a police officer. In 2008, Mario Lopez made his Broadway debut in A Chorus Line, playing the role of Zach. He also briefly appeared in Sesame Street in 2012. In 2015, Lopez had the chance to reunite with his Saved by the Bell costars with a comedy sketch on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\nOutside of acting, Mario Lopez has experienced considerable success in the world of reality television. In 2006, he joined the third season of Dancing with the Stars, partnering with the professional dancer (and his girlfriend) Karina Smirnoff. The couple finished in second place. In 2010, Mario Lopez also started a reality show with his next girlfriend, Courtney Mazza. The show is called Mario Lopez: Saved by the Baby, and it follows the couple as they prepare for their first child.\n\nIn addition to acting and reality television, Mario Lopez has become quite successful as a host. As early as 1992 (before Saved by the Bell ended), he was hosting NBC's Name Your Adventure. From 1995 to 1996, he hosted Masters of the Maze. His next major hosting role came in 2002 when he took the reins of Pet Star for three years. Many viewers also remember Mario Lopez's role as a host for various Miss America beauty pageants.\n\nIn 2012, he hosted The X-Factor with Khloe Kardashian and was the sole host for the third and final season. That year, he also started hosting his own nationally syndicated radio show. Mario Lopez co-hosted The Wendy Williams Show, and until 2019, he was the host of Extra before moving instead to Access. Today, Mario Lopez hosts MTV's America's Best Dance Crew and Top Pop Group.\n\nWriting\n\nMario Lopez wrote a number of books over the course of his career. These include 2008's Mario Lopez Knockout Fitness, 2010's Extra Lean, and 2012's Extra Lean Family. Extra Lean became a New York Times Bestseller. As is evident from the titles of the books, they focus on weight loss and fitness. In 2011, Lopez also published a children's book called Mario and Baby Gia. The book focuses on his relationship with his daughter.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nMario Lopez first married actress Ali Landry in 2004, although their marriage was annulled shortly afterward. Lopez had allegedly been unfaithful to his fiancee during his bachelor party. From 2006 to 2008, he dated Karina Smirnoff – his dance partner on Dancing with the Stars.\n\nWhile performing in the Broadway production of A Chorus Line, Lopez met Courtney Mazza. In 2010, they had a daughter. In 2012, they married in Mexico. Since their marriage, the couple has had two more children, both boys.\n\nLopez is an amateur boxer and has a purple belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. In 2022, he helped revive Puerto Rican boy band Menudo as their new manager, and in 2023, they released their first single under Lopez, titled \"Mi Amore.\"\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn 1994, when he was just 21, Mario paid $240,000 for a modest home in Burbank, California. He sold this home for a bit over $1 million in mid-2022.\n\nIn 2004, Mario bought a second home in Burbank for $1.25 million. He sold this home in December 2022 for $2.09 million.\n\nFrom August 2010 until mid-2022, Mario's primary home was a Spanish-style home in Glendale, CA, which he acquired for $1.95 million. He listed this home for sale in August 2022 for $6.5 million. He also made it available to rent for $25,000 per month. In April 2023, he finally sold this property for $4.55 million.\n\nIn July 2022, Mario paid $9.4 million for a 9,000-square-foot mansion in the LA suburb of La Cañada Flintridge."
