(there are No words for him).\n\nTori left a short marriage with no kids, but HE left a wife of 12 years and a newborn (and has other kids). I am not saying one should stay in a loveless or unhappy marriage, you get one life and there is no gain in suffering, but on the other hand, we make choices. Kids are involved, and not being happy is awful and sad, but sometimes you just hit a tough patch...I guess unless you are totally out of love, I would say try to work on it. If someone cheated, or was abusive or had problems that endangered me or my kids, that is a deal breaker. But Tori just found her soulmate, so soon after having apparently gotten married because...did she not love the first guy? DId she not think HE was her soulmate? This marriage is not one for the record books in terms of longevity, unless there is some miracle afloat...\n\nmoon river\n\nBrilliant_Rock\n\nJoined\n\nJan 7, 2006\n\nMessages\n\n1,806\n\nMay 10, 2006\n\n#18\n\nDate: 5/10/2006 4:43:57 PM\n\nAuthor: LizzieC\n\nI''ll take that bet!

I saw some fast one on Access Hollywood yesterday - very private and on the beach, they looked gorgeous. I don''t know what mag they were pulled from.

They got married on the island of Wakaya in Fiji (just the two of them). I really wish I was at home so I could use my mom''s scanner!!
