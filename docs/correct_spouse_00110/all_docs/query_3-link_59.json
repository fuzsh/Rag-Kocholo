        "text": "Mario Lopez is a married man.\n\nThe X Factor host tied the knot Saturday afternoon with longtime love Courtney Mazza at the beachfront vacation home of pal Joe Francis in Punta Mita, Mexico.\n\nEva Longoria, one of Lopez's best friends, also walked down the aisle as a bridesmaid and his and Mazza's 2-year-old daughter, Gia, made for the most adorable flower girl donning a dress that matched Mama Mazza, E! News reports.\n\nMario Lopez strips down to his golden underwear\n\nA Catholic priest officiated the traditional ceremony at sunset, after which more than 150 guests kicked up their heels to fete the newlyweds.\n\nLopez was reportedly in charge of the entertainment (i.e. the music and dancing), while his bride-to-be was taking care of the food, cake and flowers (not to mention probably a zillion other little touches that her fiance may have failed to mention). Cake Boss star Buddy Valastro was enlisted to make the multilayered chocolate and red-velvet confection.\n\n\"I'm just a sidekick in it. My fiance is the star,\" Lopez told People of the literal wedding production (Mario & Courtney's Wedding Fiesta, which airs Dec. 8 on TLC). \"I just want the wedding itself to be fun, just a blast, everybody to party and have fun and to go all night.\"\n\nU.S. & World\n\nStories that affect your life across the U.S. and around the world.\n\nSounds like marriage is working out for Jessica Biel and Justin Timberlake\n\nThe celebratory weekend kicked off last night, meanwhile, with a \"white party\" on the beach, for which all the guests were asked to come in their finest white fiesta gear.\n\nLopez and Mazza announced their engagement in January, the groom-to-be having popped the question over their New Year's holiday in Ixtapa, Mexico.\n\nThis is the former \"Saved by the Bell\" star's second marriage, his first to Ali Landry lasting barely a month."
