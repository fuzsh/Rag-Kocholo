        "text": "Mario Lopez and former Miss USA, Ali Landry, were in a relationship for about six years only to tie the knot and split in the space of two weeks.\n\nLike many celebrity marriages, the very first marriage of the American actor, Lopez, and his celebrity ex-wife was short-lived.\n\nIt took about seven years for the actor to visit the past and finally open up about the reason his first marriage failed.\n\nMario Lopez & Ali Landry during \"White Oleander\" Premiere - Los Angeles at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, California | Photo: Getty Images\n\nTHE FIRST MARRIAGE\n\nIt's been almost two decades since \"Saved By The Bell\" star Mario Lopez walked down the aisle and said \"I do\" to his celebrity ex-wife, Ali Landry.\n\nWhile Ali had her doubts about the man she was about to marry right before the wedding, she was reluctant to call it quits because friends and family were already making their way to the venue from different parts of the world.\n\nActress/model Ali Landry arrives at People En Espanol's \"50 Most Beautiful\" gala, held at Skylight Studios in New York, NY, on Wednesday May 17, 2006 | Photo: Getty Images\n\nTwo weeks into the marriage, she found out that all her suspicions were true and so she walked out on the marriage.\n\n\"He's cheated on her for several years, and she just found out last week.\"\n\nApparently, Lopez was a ladies man, and at the time he got married to Ali, he wasn't ready to stay committed. He was never in love with her.\n\nAt his bachelor party, Lopez got too friendly with a young lady and was caught on camera in a compromising position with her.\n\nThe actor said after he had misbehaved at the party, it was when he was about to go home that he realized he wasn't in love with his ex-wife.\n\n\"I got inebriated and a little too friendly with a young lady. When it was time to return home, lightning hit me with the truth: I wasn't in love. But I walked down the aisle [anyway].\"\n\nHe admitted that he was wrong to have lied to his ex-wife and to have allowed himself be in the position he was in. He said it was a situation where he was not mature and man enough.\n\nHE HAS SINCE MOVED ON\n\nToday, Lopez has put his ladies man days behind him as he has settled down and raised a family with another woman.\n\nUnlike his first marriage, Lopez's current marriage, which stemmed from a relationship of three years, has lasted for eight years and only seems to be waxing stronger.\n\nHe is married to the actress and producer, Courtney Laine Mazza, whom he met on a Chorus Line on Broadway in New York.\n\nMario Lopez and pregnant Courtney on the red carpet I Image: Getty Images.\n\nBefore she said I do, Mario Lopez's wife was already the mother of his first child, whom they welcomed in September 2010.\n\nThey have since had more children as they welcomed their third child last year. Mario Lopez's kids are Gia, Dominic, and Santino Lopez.\n\nMARIO LOPEZ, SAVED BY THE BELL\n\nIn 1989, Lopez was cast to play the role of A.C. SLATER in the television Saturday morning NBC series \"Saved by the Bell.\"\n\nHis time on \"Saved by the Bell\" lasted for five years as the series ran for only four seasons and came to an end in 1993.\n\nMario and wife Courtney Lopez posing on the red carpet I Image: Getty Images.\n\nWhile working on the NBC series, he featured in other tv series, including \"Breaking the Surface: The Greg Louganis Story\" and \"Pacific Blue,\" among others.\n\nThe NBC series, however, was a massive hit and led to two spin-offs, \"Saved by the Bell: The College Years\" and \"Saved by the Bell: The New Class.\" Lopez was a core cast in both.\n\nMario and Courtney Lopez with their daughter Gia.

Network's \"Nip/Tuck\" and guest-starred in \"Sesame Street.\"\n\nIn 2010, he also started a reality show with his wife on VH1 called \"Mario Lopez: Saved by the Baby.\" More recently, in 2015, Lopez appeared in a \"Saved by the Bell\" sketch on \"The Tonight show\" starring Jimmy Fallon.\n\nncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpwcGlhaHqurdGipmakn6Wyu7%2BMn6Crq6RiuqK%2B0aKYoJ1dlrmqecuapZ2qqWK5b7TTpqM%3D"
