        "text": "By now we’ve heard about Mario Lopez’s infidelity while engaged to Doritos model Ali Landry. Lopez has long been accused of cheating on Landry, which is what lead to their quick divorce after only two weeks of marriage. Although in the beginning Lopez denied these allegations, years later he has come clean.\n\nOne marriage and two children later, the Extra host has a new perspective on why he cheated on his first wife. According to Yahoo, he wasn’t really in love with the model when they got hitched in 2004.\n\nRevealing in his new memoir, Just Between Us, the star is opening up about the whole relationship. Of meeting Landry as the 1998 Miss Teen USA pageant, he writes, “I thought this was the girl.”\n\nHe continues, “She was a model, so she always had good style, she knew how to dress. And she was Catholic, very driven, ambitious, hardworking — but also charming and innocent at the same time. I could have been looking at a lot of criteria that were more on the surface than not. But that was my bad.”\n\nLopez writes that he quickly saw her change due to the demands of the industry, and his dream girl turned into an image-obsessed model. How sweet.\n\n“The changes were subtle, but her interests sounded more materialistic and she seemed more preoccupied with image rather than substance, things I didn’t care about. Our conversations became less based on common interests and more about her pressuring me to be a certain way, dress a certain way, act a certain way.”\n\nThe two broke up but then quickly reunited. Lopez says that it was Landry that gave him the ultimatum that lead him to propose in the first place. He also wrote about the bachelor party where his infidelity took place. Lopez asserts that as soon as he acknowledged the situation he knew his real feelings towards Landry weren’t as they seemed.\n\n“Once I took responsibility for my feelings, acknowledging how I had so mishandled my decisions, lightning hit me with the truth: I wasn’t in love. The thoughts came streaming in, but it was too late. My misgivings reared their ugly heads and I knew I should have broken things off with her before I strayed.”\n\nAli Landry must have gotten a heads up about Lopez writing this revealing tell-all, because the model, who has been relatively quiet about the short marriage for a few years, opened up to Oprah about everything this past summer.\n\nThe Inquisitr reported that Landry revealed she had believed Lopez when he said he hadn’t cheated on her, despite what she was told.\n\n“All of my friends and family were flying down to this wedding in Mexico. So, I went through with the wedding.”"
