        "text": "The father-in-law and brother-in-law of actress and former Miss USA Ali Landry were found dead in Mexico, authorities report.\n\nJuan Manuel Gómez Fernández and Juan Manuel Gómez Monteverde, the father and brother of Landry's film director husband Alejandro Monteverde, were found on September 19 near the remote town of Pueblo Viejo, according to a statement from the state's attorney general. Landry's representatives declined to comment for this story.\n\nThe report says that Fernández and Monteverde had suffered brain trauma and had been dead for several days before the bodies were found and identified by relatives. Fernández and Monteverde had been reported kidnapped on September 4.\n\nAccording to the report, a vehicle allegedly used by the kidnappers was found, and an investigation by the attorney general's office is ongoing.\n\nAfter being crowned Miss USA representing Louisiana in 1996, Landry starred as the \"Doritos Girl\" in Doritos' famous 1998 Super Bowl commercial, and was briefly married to Mario Lopez in 2004. She has appeared in several TV shows and movies, including several films with her husband.\n\nColleagues of Monteverde, an acclaimed Mexican film director, have spoken out on social media against the tragic murders of his father and brother, as well as the drug-related violence gripping parts of South America.\n\nDavid Henrie, an actor in Monteverde's 2015 war drama Little Boy, posted his condolences on Instagram.\n\nEduardo Verastegui, a producer on the film, expressed his sympathy via Twitter.\n\n\"With a heart full of pain and sadness, I ask for prayers for my friend and brother Alejandro Gomez Monteverde and his family,\" his tweet read in Spanish.\n\nLandry and Alejandro Monteverde have not publicly commented on the incident. Earlier in the year, Monteverde posted a picture with his father on his Instagram."
