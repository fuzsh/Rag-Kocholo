I have so many fuzzy socks and cozy blankets that are calling to me.\n\nI have to admit that Other Lainey isn’t the only Lainey enjoying the Taylor Swift/Travis Kelce romance. I’m finding it entertaining and cute, despite my initial indifference. - (Lainey Gossip)\n\nRemember when Kevin James promoted his friend’s new movie? What was it called? Oh yeah! Sound of Freedom. If you are wondering what the connection is, Kevin James starred in the previous film from Sound of Freedom director Alejandro Monteverde. It was a faith-based movie called Little Boy, which is about — and we are not kidding here — a boy who, through the power of faith, prays for the atomic bombing of Hiroshima so that his father can come home. It is a heartwarming movie about MASS DEATH. As Rebecca Pahle wrote in her review: “It’s like when athletes attribute a victory to ‘God being on our side,’ assuming in the process that God reached down a cosmic middle finger to the other team, whom God apparently likes less. Except instead of one team losing a game, almost two hundred thousand people died.” Is this where we’re supposed to drop the Kevin James meme? (Pajiba)\n\nOh, and the wife of Alejandro Monteverde also appeared in an episode of Kevin Can Wait alongside Kevin James. Monteverde’s wife is actually Ali Landry, and in the episode, Kevin James’ character hits on Ali Landry’s character soon after the death of Kevin’s wife. Landry and Monteverde met, by the way, on the set of Monteverde’s first film, the anti-abortion movie Bella. Landry had just annulled her marriage to Mario Lopez two weeks after their wedding because she found out that Lopez cheated on her during his bachelor party. And yes, I fell down a rabbit hole this morning.\n\nOprah Winfrey, who cooks her own meals, cleans her own house(s), takes out her own trash, mows her own lawn(s), oh, no wait, does none of those things, thinks taking drugs like Ozempic to lose weight is “taking the easy way out.” - (Celebitchy)\n\nStacy and Clinton, who got me to love erggh tolerate endure my 25.5” inseam, have reunited! Happy tears! - (EW)\n\nIt’s not just you. LinkedIn has gotten really weird. - (Business Insider)\n\nDid I miss the news that Anthony Edwards and Mare Winningham secretly eloped in 2021 or did I see it at the time and completely and totally forget it? Either way, good for them; they look great! - (GFY)\n\nGoing to the doctor can be nerve-racking and leave you tongue-tied. Speaking up for yourself in a medical setting is a skill. Here’s what to know. - (VOX)\n\nThis answer to incompatible libidos is one I’ve never heard before and it stunned me! - (Scary Mommy)\n\nIt’s taken 27 years but there’s finally been an arrest and a murder charge for Tupac’s death. - (AP)\n\nNew ‘Little Prince’ Statue Sits Near Central Park and Gazes Up at the Stars - (Smithsonian Magazine)\n\nIt looks like it’s time to start donating to Texas abortion funds in a certain lawyer’s name. - (Jezebel)\n\nCalifornia will raise the minimum wage for fast-food workers to $20 an hour. - (Axios)"
