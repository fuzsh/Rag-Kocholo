        "text": "By RadarOnline.com Staff\n\nMario Lopez was not saved by the bell Thursday, as his ex-wife Ali Landry accused him of being both a liar and a cheater during an appearance on The Wendy Williams Show.\n\nLandry, a former beauty queen and Doritos girl, explained how her short-lived 2004 marriage to the child star-turned-Hollywood utility man crumbled like a three-day-old cake even before the “I do’s” were exchanged.\n\n\"I had heard something right before the wedding: He swore that it was not true, but I had that feeling in my gut,\" Landry, 38, said. \"All of my family was flying in, it was a destination wedding, and I really should have put the brakes on it at that point, but I was afraid.\"\n\nOf course, Landry famously had the union annulled after a mere two weeks. Lopez, who projects a nice guy image on-camera, says he’s still on good terms with his exes -- not so, says Landry.\n\nWatch The Video On RadarOnline.com\n\n“That’s a lie,” Landry said, adding she hasn’t spoken to him since she annulled their marriage two weeks after the wedding.\n\nLandry said her comments Thursday were not intended on degrading Lopez, but to show women they can be empowered after a tough time."
