        "text": "Big glamour on a school night! A bevy of celebrity kids stayed out late on Sunday evening, March 1, to attend the Hollywood premiere of Disneyâs Cinderella.\n\nHitting the red carpet without wife Courtney Mazza, Mario Lopez was on daddy duty at Hollywoodâs El Capitan Theatre. The Saved by the Bell alum, 41, held hands with his adorable 4-year-old daughter Gia on the red carpet. Wearing a princess dress and a crown, the little girl met the movieâs stars Lily James and Cate Blanchett.\n\nFather of two Lopez narrowly missed an awkward encounter at the movie premiere with his ex-wife Ali Landry. The former Miss USA, who was married to Lopez for two weeks in 2004 before the marriage was annulled, also attended the Cinderella premiere with her mini-me.\n\nLandry, 41, brought her eldest daughter Estela, 7, to the event. Looking gorgeous in a black tea-length dress, the beauty queen dressed her daughter in a Cinderella-worthy gown and tiara. Landry and her husband of nearly nine years, Alejandro Monteverde, also have younger sons Marcelo and Valentin.\n\nFrozenâs Josh Gad followed suit, bringing his little girl Ava to the movie. He and wife Ida Darvish recently added to their family with the 2014 birth of daughter Isabelle.\n\nIt was a family affair for Ian Ziering, who hit Hollywood with his wife Erin Kristine Ludwig and the coupleâs older daughter Mia, 3. The adorable little girl, who wore a Cinderella-inspired dress to the event, became a big sister in April 2013 with the birth of baby Penna Mae.\n\nThank You!\n\nYou have successfully subscribed.\n\nZieringâs Beverly Hills, 90210 costar Jason Priestley hit the town with his wife Naomi Lowde-Priestley with their son and daughter in tow. The makeup artist carried son Dashiell Orson, 4, on her back, while daughter Ava, 7, cozied up to her actor father.\n\nBusy Philipps had a girlsâ night at Cinderella, bringing her daughter Birdie, 6, and young pal to the El Capitan Theatre. The Cougar Town star left her husband Marc Silverstein and 18-month-old daughter Cricket back at home.\n\nJeremy Sisto and his wife Addie Lane had a ball on the red carpet with their two children. Dressed in rain boots and colorful outfits, daughter Charlie Ballerina, 4, and son Bastian Kick, 2, posed for photos with their parents.\n\nncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaKSaqpmkeq27z56xZpmcnnqtrc2dqbJln6m1pr6MrKuaqqNiwbDAxGaiopyjYsGwecKipZ2dopq5ra2MqamepZmav6Z5kWlobmpj"
