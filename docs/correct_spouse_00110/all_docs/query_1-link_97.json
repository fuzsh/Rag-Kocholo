        "text": "(CBS) Mario Lopez proposed to his longtime girlfriend Courtney Mazza over New Year's Eve weekend in Ixtapa, Mexico.\n\nPictures: Celebrity weddings and engagements\n\nPictures: Hollywood's short-lived marraiges\n\n\"We took a walk alone as the sun was setting,\" Lopez, 38, told Us Weekly. \"I told Courtney that I wanted the mother of my children to have their last name. She was silent at first from shock, then she leaped for joy and did a little jete!\"\n\nThe former \"Saved by the Bell\" star has been dating Mazza, a 28-year-old stage actress, since 2008. The couple, who met while performing in \"A Chorus Line\" on Broadway, has a 2-year-old daughter named Gia. They plan to exchange vows later this year in Mexico.\n\nLopez wed Ali Landry in 2004, but they annulled the marriage two weeks later."
