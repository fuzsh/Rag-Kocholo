Melbourne, Feb 14 (ANI): Actor Mario Lopez has revealed that he had sex with a woman on his bachelor party before marrying actress and former Miss USA, Ali Landry.

Their marriage was annulled after two weeks amid rumours of Lopez's rampant cheating.

Lopez and Landry had been long-time lovers when they married in April 2004.

Now, almost seven years later, 37-year-old actor has confessed that he cheated on her on his wild bachelor party weekend in Mexico.

"It was my bachelor party," the Daily Telegraph quoted Lopez as telling US radio, saying that he had been "bouncing around" Mexico with his cousins.

"I had no business of being in that position," he said, offering that he "messed around" with another woman.

"It was spring break ... everybody was hanging out. That was a situation where I was not mature and man enough," he said.

Before heading out for his big weekend, Lopez didn't tell then-fiancee Landry the whole truth.

"I said I was going to Cabo (San Lucas) ... to go marlin fishing," he said.

"Then my cousin surprised me and said 'No, ... we're going on this whirlwind tour: Cabo, Acapulco, all these places.'

"I figured at that point it was easier to ask for forgiveness (afterward). It's my bachelor party, we were going to have a good time. And we went, we had a good time," he said.

At the time Lopez was caught in an incriminating poolside photograph with another woman.

"We're partying, and somebody took a picture," he said.

But Landry's sister eventually got a hold of that photo and shared it with her.

"I was wrong for obviously lying, and I shouldn't have been in that position," Lopez added. (ANI)
