        "text": "A total of 351 HBCU men's basketball players have been drafted in NBA history, with Norfolk State's Kyle O'Quinn being the most recent selection during 2012's second round.\n\nHere is a complete history of HBCU players in the NBA draft (through 2022).\n\nThe first selection ever: West Virginia State's Earl Lloyd was the first HBCU men's basketball player drafted to the NBA and it was in the 1950 draft. Lloyd would become the first African-American player to play in an NBA game on Oct. 31, 1950. Since Lloyd's selection, a total of 351 HBCU products have been drafted to the NBA, with 132 players selected after the 1976 NBA-ABA merger. Since the NBA draft shortened to two rounds in 1989, 18 HBCU players have been selected. Sixty-seven HBCU players have been selected in the first two rounds of the NBA draft.\n\nThe first-rounders: 21 HBCU men's basketball players have been first-round selections. Winston-Salem State's Earl Monroe is the highest HBCU NBA draft selection ever, going second overall to the Baltimore Bullets in 1967. Jackson State's Purvis Short is the highest HBCU NBA draft selection post-merger, going fifth overall to the Golden State Warriors in 1978. Short is one of 10 HBCU first-round draft picks since 1976.\n\nNorth Carolina Central's Sam Jones was the first HBCU first round NBA draft pick, going eighth overall to the Boston Celtics in 1957. Tennessee State's Carlos Rogers is the most recent HBCU first round NBA draft pick, going 11th overall to the Seattle SuperSonics in 1994. 1961, 1975 and 1978 remain the only years that two HBCU players were drafted in the first round.\n\nHBCU first round NBA draft picks\n\nPICK PLAYER YEAR COLLEGE NBA TEAM 2 Earl Monroe 1967 Winston-Salem State Baltimore Bullets 3 Elmore Smith 1971 Kentucky State Buffalo Braves 3 Marvin Webster 1975 Morgan State Atlanta Hawks 3 Zelmo Beaty 1962 Prairie View A&M St. Louis Hawks 4 Dick Barnett 1959 Tennessee State Syracuse Nationals 5 Purvis Short 1978 Jackson State Golden State Warriors 6 Ben Warley 1961 Tennessee State Syracuse Nationals 7 Bennie Swain 1958 Texas Southern Boston Celtics 8 Sam Jones 1957 North Carolina Central Boston Celtics 8 Cleo Hill 1961 Winston-Salem State St. Louis Hawks 9 Gene Short 1975 Jackson State New York Knicks 9 Charles Oakley 1985 Virginia Union Cleveland Cavaliers 10 Lindsey Hunter 1993 Jackson State Detroit Pistons 11 Carlos Rogers 1994 Tennessee State Seattle SuperSonics 13 Travis Grant 1972 Kentucky State Los Angeles Lakers 14 Larry Wright 1976 Grambling State Washington Bullets 14 Mike Davis 1969 Virginia Union Baltimore Bullets 17 Kevin Loder 1981 Alabama State Kansas City Kings 20 Frankie Sanders 1978 Southern University San Antonio Spurs 21 Monti Davis 1980 Tennessee State Philadelphia 76ers 23 Earl Jones 1984 District of Columbia Los Angeles Lakers\n\nThe latest HBCU NBA draft selection: When the Detroit Pistons drafted Shaw's Ed Jenkins in the 19th round of the 1971 NBA draft, Jenkins became the latest selected HBCU player in NBA history going 237th overall.\n\nHBCU NBA draft selections by college: Tennessee State and Jackson State have had the most NBA draft picks with 23 selections each. Grambling State is second at 22.\n\nFifty-nine HBCUs have had a player taken in the NBA draft. From that group, Bishop and Saint Paul's (VA) are defunct HBCUs with former NBA draft picks. Coppin State and Delaware State are the only DI HBCUs that haven't had an NBA draft pick.\n\nOnly 26 HBCUs have ever had multiple players selected in the same draft. Only 10 HBCUs have done so since the 1976 merger. Since the draft cut down to two rounds in 1989, Mississippi Valley State is the only HBCU with multiple players selected in the same NBA draft. Shaw (1972), Jackson State (1970) and Tennessee State (1968) are the only HBCUs to ever have four players selected in the same NBA draft. Below are all the instances of HBCU with multiple players selected in the same draft.\n\n1993\n\nMississippi Valley State (2 players)\n\n1987\n\nWest Virginia State (2 players)\n\n1983\n\nChicago State (2 players)\n\nHampton (2 players)\n\n1982\n\nHoward (2 players)\n\nJackson State (2 players)\n\n1981\n\nHampton (2 players)\n\n1980\n\nAlcorn State (2 players)\n\n1979\n\nSouthern (2 players)\n\n1978\n\nSouthern (3 players)\n\n1977\n\nKentucky State (2 players)\n\nTexas Southern (2 players)\n\n1976\n\nAlcorn State (2 players)\n\nGrambling State (2 players)\n\n1975\n\nJackson State (2 players)\n\nKentucky State (2 players)\n\nNorth Carolina A&T (2 players)\n\n1974\n\nMaryland-Eastern Shore (3 players)\n\n1972\n\nJackson State (3 players)\n\nKentucky State (2 players)\n\nShaw (4 players)\n\nSouth Carolina State (2 players)\n\n1971\n\nAlcorn State (3 players)\n\nCheyney (2 players)\n\nKentucky State (2 players)\n\nNorfolk State (2 players)\n\nSavannah State (2 players)\n\nTennessee State (2 players)\n\n1970\n\nAlabama State (2 players)\n\nCheyney (2 players)\n\nDillard (2 players)\n\nFort Valley State (2 players)\n\nJackson State (4 players)\n\n1969\n\nAlcorn State (2 players)\n\nNorfolk State (3 players)\n\n1968\n\nAlbany State (GA) (2 players)\n\nCheyney (2 players)\n\nLincoln (MO) (2 players)\n\nNorth Carolina A&T (3 players)\n\nTennessee State (4 players)\n\n1967\n\nNorth Carolina A&T (2 players)\n\nSouth Carolina State (2 players)\n\nWinston-Salem State (2 players)\n\n1964\n\nNorth Carolina A&T (2 players)\n\nVirginia State (2 players)\n\n1961\n\nTennessee State (3 players)\n\nWinston-Salem State (2 players)\n\n1959\n\nTennessee State (2 players)\n\nBelow you can find a breakdown of HBCU players drafted by college and the highest HBCU draft selections by college.\n\nHBCU players drafted by college # OF PLAYERS DRAFTED HBCU 23 Tennessee State, Jackson State 22 Grambling State 19 North Carolina A&T 14 Winston-Salem State, Southern,\n\nNorfolk State, Alabama State 13 Kentucky State, Alcorn State 10 Cheyney 9 North Carolina Central 8 Virginia Union, Shaw,\n\nHampton, Albany State (GA) 7 Texas Southern, Dillard 6 Elizabeth City State 5 West Virginia State, South Carolina State,\n\nMississippi Valley State, Lincoln (MO), Howard,\n\nCentral State (OH), Arkansas-Pine Bluff 4 Virginia State, Tuskegee, Saint Augustine's,\n\nPrairie View A&M, Maryland-Eastern Shore,\n\nFlorida A&M, Chicago State, Bethune-Cookman 3 Wiley, Savannah State, Morgan State,\n\nLeMoyne-Owen, Johnson C.

The Philadelphia 76ers have drafted the second-most HBCU players as a franchise with 35, but has drafted the most HBCU players since moving to Philadelphia to become the 76ers at 29.\n\nTwenty-give out of the 30 current NBA franchises have drafted an HBCU player in their history. From that group, the Washington Wizards, Oklahoma City Thunder, Brooklyn Nets and Memphis Grizzlies haven't selected an HBCU player since renaming and/or relocating their teams.
