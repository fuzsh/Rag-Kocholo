        "text": "Overview\n\nGiraffes Can’t Dance, The Musical (January 29 – February 25, 2024) takes the stage as our first professional production of the New Year. Gerald the giraffe has a problem. All the other animals seem to know how to dance. The warthogs can waltz, the rhinos can rock ‘n’ roll, even the chimps can cha-cha! Gerald, with his long neck and skinny legs, thinks he cannot dance. That is, until he discovers that “sometimes when you’re different, you just need a different song.”\n\nBased on the bestselling picture book by Giles Andreae and Guy Parker-Rees, this new musical with original songs will transport you to Africa where you will encounter a cast of characters guaranteed to make you laugh- and think! Most of all, Gerald’s story will remind you that we all can dance when we find the music we love.\n\nBook and lyrics by Gloria Bond Cunie with music by Elton Bradman and Leela Oleszkiewicz."
