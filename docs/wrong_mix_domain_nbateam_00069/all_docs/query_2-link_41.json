        "text": "Congratulations are in order to one country artist and Michigan native because she got married over the weekend!\n\nCongrats to Jana Kramer! Michigan's own Jana Kramer and long-time boyfriend and fiancé, Allan Russell tied the knot over the weekend. Sadly, they didn't make it a \"Pure Michigan\" wedding, although that would have been cool. Instead, they opted for a small wedding abroad.\n\nCountry Musician and Actor Jana Kramer Gets Married\n\nJana and Allan got married in Scotland, and it seriously looks like the nuptials came straight out of a storybook.\n\nJana shared some pictures of the \"I Do's\" on her social media. Of course, she looks absolutely stunning. But don't miss that literal castle in the background!\n\nThe wedding was truly a family affair, as Jana and Allan's children from former relationships were not only in attendance but were part of the wedding in some fashion. The exception is Jana and Allan's shared son, Roman. He's only eight months old, so his only job was being adorable, and let's be honest, he nailed it.\n\nCongratulations to the happy couple!\n\nIt was about this time last year when we saw Jana and her family visit Mackinac Island. She notes what a full circle moment it is to have grown up going there, and now she's able to bring her own kiddos.\n\nWho knows... maybe Jana and Allan will decide to have some kind of reception in the good ole Mitten State when they come back from across the pond."
