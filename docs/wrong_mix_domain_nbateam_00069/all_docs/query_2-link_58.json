        "text": "http://youtu.be/w3V8x5WkJ6E\n\nThe NBA announced Wednesday that Bobcats guard Gerald Henderson has been issued a warning for flopping.\n\nHenderson's flop occurred with a little more than four minutes remaining in Charlotte's 89-82 road loss to Dallas on Tuesday night. With the Bobcats leading 60-51, Henderson received a dribble hand-off in the right corner with Monta Ellis guarding him. Ellis applied light pressure to Henderson's back with his left hand and forearm, and Henderson responded by launching himself forward in a manner that was inconsistent with the level of contact received. No foul was called on the play and Henderson was given a turnover after he fell to the ground out of bounds while possessing the ball.\n\nThis type of flop was specifically called out in the NBA’s official video introducing its flopping policy. In the video, Spurs guard Tony Parker was fouled on a drive but unnecessarily sent himself flying to the ground.\n\n“The highlighted offensive player will draw a legitimate defensive foul on the drive but he subsequently over-embellishes the contact by flailing his arms and spinning to the floor,” the video’s narrator explains. “This over-embellished action is inconsistent with the level of contact and the direction of the contact.”\n\nRELATED: The 10 most ridiculous flops of the 2012-13 season\n\nHenderson becomes the 12th player warned by the league for flopping this season, joining Wizards guard John Wall, Timberwolves forwards Kevin Love and Corey Brewer, Spurs guard Patty Mills, Bucks center Zaza Pachulia, Rockets guard James Harden, Knicks guard Iman Shumpert, Clippers guard Chris Paul, Cavaliers center Anderson Varejao, Celtics forward Jared Sullinger and Mavericks forward Dirk Nowitzki. No warnings were handed out during the preseason. Harden has also been fined $5,000 for a second violation.\n\nInstituted before the 2012-13 season, the NBA's anti-flopping system provides one free warning to players before they are subjected to a scaling set of monetary fines.\n\nViolation 1: Warning\n\nViolation 2: $5,000 fine\n\nViolation 3: $10,000 fine\n\nViolation 4: $15,000 fine\n\nViolation 5: $30,000 fine\n\nViolation 6: Subject to discipline reasonable under the circumstances, including an increased fine and/or suspension\n\nThe NBA assigned 24 flopping violations to 19 different players on 13 different teams during the 2012-13 regular season. Five players received two infractions each, earning fines totaling $25,000, with zero players getting dinged three or more times.\n\nDuring the 2013 playoffs, the NBA removed the free warning and began assessing fines. Although commissioner David Stern said that the league's current policy \"isn't enough\" to curb the practice, the league did not adopt any changes to the policy during the offseason.\n\nThe NBA defines flopping as \"any physical act that, following review, reasonably appears to be intended to cause the game officials to call a foul on another player\" with the “primary factor” in determining a flop being whether “a player’s physical reaction to contact with another player is inconsistent with what would reasonably be expected given the force or direction of the contact.”\n\nHenderson finished with 16 points (on 7-for-11 shooting) and three rebounds in 26 minutes."
