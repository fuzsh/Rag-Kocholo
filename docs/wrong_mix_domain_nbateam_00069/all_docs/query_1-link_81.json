        "text": "When I look back at Draft Night, the first word that comes to mind every time is gratitude. It‘s an honor to play in this league and I know I couldn‘t have done it without the support of my family and coaches.\n\nOne of the first things I did after I was drafted was send Coach K a small gift. It was a little globe paperweight, with a note thanking him for preparing me for the world. I can‘t return all the gifts he‘s given me through his coaching and commitment to help me develop ever since he started recruiting me. The paperweight was to show my appreciation because he had given me so much and been such an amazing influence. He changed my entire way of thinking and whole outlook. I went from thinking and acting young, to thinking strong and acting old during my time at Duke. And more importantly, I learned how to think confidently.\n\nOne of the main reasons I ended up in the 2009 NBA Draft and ready to make an impact as a pro player was a meeting I had with Coach during my junior year. We had lost at Michigan in December. I played okay. Not great. Coach sat me down privately in his office the next day and asked how things were going. I was a captain and he asked me how the guys were playing. I mentioned everybody but myself. He said, “Well G, you have explained our team but you haven‘t said how you are playing. And I don‘t think you are playing that hard. You aren‘t playing to the best of your ability.”\n\nHe then asked me what my goals were. I wanted to be ACC Player of the Year. First Team All-ACC. All-American. NBA Player. He said, “Well G, I don‘t think you are close on any of those. If I were a coach, GM or owner, I wouldn‘t draft you. What do you do that makes you an All-American? You aren‘t that. There‘s no reason to think that right now you could be an NBA 2-guard.” At the time, I understood what he was saying, but it pissed me off. I thought I was an NBA player. But I wasn‘t doing nearly enough, and he was right. But like I said — I was pissed. In my mind, I was like, “Alright. I‘m gonna show him. I‘m gonna show him an NBA player. He‘ll see.”\n\nI know he knew what he was doing. He knew anger was a good emotion for me. From then on, I started taking things way more seriously. I took everything very personally, including what he said to me that day. Even though I know he was right. And from that moment, I took off. I played well and became the Duke player I always wanted to be. Getting drafted to the league isn‘t the only dream. Being one of the best players at Duke is what you dream about too.\n\nBack then, it was guys like J-Will, JJ, Shelden, and Grant for me when I was younger. Those are the guys you wanted to be. Being in that kind of spot was what I always wanted. It took a lot of work and a meeting like that, but it was a beautiful time in my life. To get drafted, you can‘t skip steps.\n\nAnd as a player in general, you have to find out what makes you go. Coach K will help you. He‘s about relationships. Even the guys who are only here for one year — he still figures them out, connects with them early in the recruiting process, and gets them ready. It helps the team and it sets the stage for those guys.\n\nCoach K knows everybody is different. Anger may not be Jayson‘s Tatum thing. Whatever it is, Coach will find what gets you going. From there, it’s up to the player to develop a routine and be disciplined. That‘s how you stay consistent. Once you find your routine and consistency, you will feel ready and be capable of big things. You will be on a mission.\n\nFIND YOUR MISSION"
