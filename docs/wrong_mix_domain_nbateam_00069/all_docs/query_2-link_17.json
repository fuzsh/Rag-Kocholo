        "text": "Team USA basketball suffered a humiliating defeat recently, ending a 53-year unbeaten record in the process.\n\nTeam USA, boasting nine former NBA players, lost 81-67 to Cuba in the FIBA AmeriCup Qualifiers 2025 in a huge upset that represents the island country's first-ever victory against the US in any FIBA competition.\n\nThe Cuban team dominated from the outset with center Pedro Bombino leading the way with 19 points and five rebounds.\n\nThe relative basketball minnows secured the shock victory over a team jam-packed with former NBA talent.\n\nThe nine former NBA players on the USA team were Elfrid Payton Jr, Jordan Bell, Stanley Johnson, Gerald Hannahs, Deonte Burton, Jahmius Ramsey, Jeff Dowtin, Matthew Hurt and Gray.\n\nPayton Jr, who finished with five points against Cuba, will be familiar to most NBA fans having been drafted 10th overall by the Philadelphia 76ers in the 2014 draft.\n\nHe made the NBA All-Rookie First Team in 2015 and is best remembered for his four-year stint with the Orlando Magic between 2014-2018.\n\nAdditionally, Stanley Johnson (seven points vs Cuba) was drafted 8th overall by the Detroit Pistons in the 2015 draft, and later played for the Lakers.\n\nWhile Jordan Bell (four points vs Cuba) won an NBA championship in his rookie season with the Golden State Warriors who beat the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2018 NBA Finals.\n\nNBA G League players RaiQuan Gray and Jahmius Ramsey finished with 17 and 14 points respectively for Team USA.\n\nCuba's victory over Team USA is their first in the competition's history, marking the end of a streak spanning 53 years.\n\nThe enormity of the victory was not lost on the Cubans, with Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel tweeting: \"Historic, sensational, hopeful!\"\n\n\"Our people celebrate the victory of the Cuban basketball team over the United States in the 2025 Copa Am√©rica Qualifiers.\n\n\"Congratulations, guys.\n\n\"Since 1971, our team has not won against the Americans.\n\n\"If we can!\"\n\nTeam USA's loss comes just three days after they comfortably defeated Cuba 100-79 in their initial matchup.\n\nTeam USA slips to a 1-1 record in the competition with their next game scheduled against Puerto Rico on 22 November.\n\nThe stunning upset comes as the Team USA men's basketball roster starts to take shape for the 2024 Olympics in Paris.\n\nAccording to recent reports, NBA superstars LeBron James - who works out like a machine - Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Joel Embiid and Jayson Tatum are considered to be 'locks' for the team barring any injuries.\n\nBoston Celtics guard Jrue Holiday is also widely tipped be a member of the 12-man roster and could well fill 6th man role.\n\nHoliday was an integral part of Team USA who won gold at the delayed 2021 Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nThe defensive-minded guard is a two-time NBA All-Star, five-time All-Defensive team member and 2021 champion with the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nAnthony Edwards, Tyrese Haliburton, Anthony Davis and Bam Adebayo are also being strongly considered for the roster, which will be led by Warriors head coach Steve Kerr."
