        "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. — Nets general manager Billy King said in an interview on WFAN that he is talking to Gerald Green's agent about signing Green — whose second 10-day contract with the team expires after Saturday night's game — to a contract not only for the rest of this season, but next season as well.\n\n“This organization, man, has really blessed me,” Green said. “I’m just happy to even be a part of it. Obviously, I have to still talk to my agent, still talk with Billy. Nothing has been signed yet, but just to hear that from my agent, saying that the team wants me here, it’s just — it’s almost mind-blowing, for all I’ve been through. I’m just very excited, but I’ve still got to keep going, keep fighting, keep fighting to try to be better, to try to help better this team.”\n\nGreen fought hard for the Nets in tonight's 86-70 loss to the Orland Magic. He led them in scoring with 14 points, all of which came in the first half. DeShawn Stevenson, who will be relinquishing his starting spot to newcomer Gerald Wallace on Saturday night against the New Orleans Hornets, was the next highest scorer, with 11 points. He was 4-of-6 shooting — 3-of-5 from 3-point range, including a failed half-court lob pass to Jordan Williams on a fast break that went in the basket.\n\nWilliams was the only other Net to have double figures. He had 10 points and six rebounds.\n\n• Coach Avery Johnson said he informed Stevenson, the incumbent starting small forward, before the game that Wallace will take his place Saturday night.\n\n• Dwight Howard helps Orlando Magic trump Nets, 86-70, one day after trade deadline\n\n• Nets stories and columns\n\n• Nets photos\n\n• Nets videos\n\nStevenson said he’s okay with it, and his performance in his final start was no kind of statement about wanting to hold on to his role.\n\n“No statement for me — I’m too old for that,” Stevenson said with a laugh. “I’m used to the situation. I dealt with this in Dallas (last season). Coach came to me — we have a great relationship. I respect him. At the end of the day, I just want to win. I want to be on a winning team, and I think Gerald will help us. Whenever my name is called, I’m going to be out there and be a pro.”\n\n• With an extra roster spot available after the trade, and with Deron Williams and Jordan Farmar (groin) out, the Nets called up point guard Jerry Smith from their D-League affiliate in Springfield, Mass., and signed him to a 10-day contract. Smith had been with the team in training camp.\n\n“He’s somebody that I’ve been keeping an eye on since he came to training camp with us,” Johnson said. “We liked him a lot (and) we’re battling quite a few injuries at the point guard position. He’s been outstanding in the D-League, especially over the last 4-6 weeks.”"
