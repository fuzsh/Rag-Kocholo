        "text": "Jacksonville will make a pitch to bring the Orlando Magic's NBA Development League team to the Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena for the 2017-18 basketball season.\n\nThe city notified the Magic last week it would submit a proposal to bring the minor league franchise to town. The NBA team wouldn't reveal the other cities that also sent letters of intent.\n\nThe process involves providing necessary amenities for a 50-game season, Orlando CEO Alex Martins said.\n\n\"We have two primary goals: First, the proximity to the NBA club. We characterize that as two hours or less,\" Martins said. \"Second, we're looking to see who can meet the needs of the operations of the team, like a place to practice, a front office where we can work on the business points with the team.\"\n\nThe D-League has 19 franchises that serve as a \"research and development laboratory\" with one-on-one affiliations with NBA franchises, the league said. Most team are in the Northeast, Southwest and West.\n\nAccording to the D-League, 38 percent of the players on NBA rosters last season spent time on the minor league roster, including Miami Heat guard Gerald Green, San Antonio Spurs guard Danny Green, Charlotte Hornets guard Jeremy Lin and Heat center Hessan Whiteside.\n\nOrlando has a D-League team in Erie, Pa. But expansion to the Southeast prompted Orlando to look for an arena closer to home.\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets will start a D-League team at Greensboro, N.C., next year. Brooklyn will move a team to Long Island and the Chicago Bulls will bring their minor league team to nearby Hoffman Estates.\n\nWith Greensboro joining the league next year and the Miami Heat, New Orleans Pelicans and Atlanta Hawks all considering moves to the Southeast in 2017, Martins wanted to start the process to get the Magic minor league team to Florida.\n\n\"Having our D-League team closer to Orlando would give us the best opportunity to continue to develop our young players, while also extending the Magic brand in our region,\" Martins said.\n\nOther cities invited to submit proposals: Daytona Beach (Ocean Center), Estero (Germain Arena), Fort Myers (Lee Civic Center), Kissimmee (Silver Spurs Arena), Lakeland (Lakeland Civic Center) and Orlando (ESPN Wide World of Sports HP Field House and UCF's CFE Arena).\n\nMartins said the Magic would make a final decision by late summer.\n\nJacksonville's specific plans haven't been revealed and repeated calls for comments from the Sports and Entertainment office weren't returned.\n\nThe Jacksonville Giants currently play in the arena. The two-time ABA championship team is owned by local attorney Ron Sholes.\n\n\"Our goal is to see the D-League here in Jacksonville,\" Sholes said. \"This is a growing basketball area.\"\n\nMartins said Orlando is open to different ownership plans. One is for the Magic to own and operate their minor league team. Another is to find a local owner that will work with team officials in the front office.\n\nTen NBA franchises own and operate their D-League teams. The rest are hybrids.\n\n\"I know some [other D-League] teams run a hybrid operation,\" Sholes said. \"We would be interested in either case.\""
