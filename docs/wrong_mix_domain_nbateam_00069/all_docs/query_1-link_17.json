        "text": "The Philadelphia 76ers have agreed to terms with Trail Blazers guard Gerald Henderson on a two-year deal worth $18 million.\n\nThe two sides came to agreement on Tuesday. Henderson averaged 8.7 points in his first season with Portland. He spent the first six seasons of his career in Charlotte before being traded to the Trail Blazers, where he was a valuable two-way player that helped make them one of the surprising success stories of last season.\n\nHenderson grew up in the Philadelphia area before going to Duke.\n\nAlso Tuesday, the Blazers acquired point guard Shabazz Napier from the Orlando Magic for cash. Napier, 24, had fallen out of the Magic's rotation much like Maurice Harkless, who became a success story last season for the Blazers."
