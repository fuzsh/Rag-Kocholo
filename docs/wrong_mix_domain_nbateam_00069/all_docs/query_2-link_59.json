        "text": "June 30, 2010\n\nMANHATTAN, Kan. - Senior guard Denis Clemente was among six collegiate standouts invited to the Charlotte Bobcats' summer team that will begin preparations Thursday for the 2010 AirTran Airways Pro Summer League set for the RDV Sportsplex in Orlando, Fla., from July 5-9.\n\nThe 19-man squad includes current Bobcats Alexis Ajinca, Gerald Henderson and Derrick Brown and consists of players from other NBA teams, the NBA Developmental League and the international ranks. Clemente is joined on the team by fellow rookies Sherron Collins (Kansas), Marquis Gilstrap (Iowa State), Marcus Ginyard (North Carolina), Brandon Hazzard (Troy) and Tyren Johnson (Louisiana). Other notable players include former college standouts, Jerel McNeal (Marquette), Jeremy Pargo (Gonzaga) and P.J. Tucker (Tucker).\n\nThe 20-game event will include the Orlando Magic, New Jersey Nets, Philadelphia 76ers, Indiana Pacers, Oklahoma City Thunder, Utah Jazz and 2010 Eastern Conference Champion Boston Celtics. Charlotte assistant coach Dave Hanners will serve as head coach during the Bobcats' five games.\n\nThe Bobcats begin play on Monday, July 5 against Utah at 12 p.m. CT and follow up with a meeting against Oklahoma City on July 6 at 2 p.m. CT. Charlotte then plays Boston on July 7 at noon CT before a meeting with Philadelphia on July 8 at 6 p.m. CT. The squad concludes summer league play against host Orlando on July 9 at 1 p.m. CT. All games will be televised nationally on NBA TV.\n\nNamed a fourth team All-American by FOXSports.com, Clemente averaged 16.6 points per game as a senior in 2009-10 on 40.5 percent shooting (213-of-526), including 34.1 percent (88-of-258) from 3-point range, with 4.2 assists, 2.4 rebounds and 1.1 steals in 34.7 minutes per game. He led the team in three categories, including minutes (34.7), field goals (213) and assists (154), while he was second in scoring, double-figure scoring (34), 20-point games (11) and 3-point field goals (88). He finished in the school's Top 10 in six single-season categories, including tops in minutes played (1,284) and second in double-digit scoring games (34).\n\nA transfer from Miami (Fla.), Clemente became just the sixth player in school history to top 1,000 career points in a two-year career with 17 vs. Kansas on March 13. His 1,093 points rank 14th all-time in school history and third by a transfer behind Mitch Richmond (1,327; 1986-88) and Willie Murrell (1,112; 1962-64). He ranks sixth in school history in both 3-point field goals (147) and attempts (419).\n\nClemente helped K-State post one of its best seasons in school history in 2009-10, as the Wildcats tallied a school-record 29-8 overall record and advanced to the Elite Eight for the first time since 1988. The squad earned its highest final ranking in nearly 50 years when they concluded the year ranked No. 7 in both the Associated Press and ESPN/USA Today Coaches' polls. During his two seasons, Clemente helped K-State to 51 wins, including 20 in Big 12 play, and consecutive trips to the postseason."
