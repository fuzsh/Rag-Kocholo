        "text": "Johann R. Garwood (Morrow, OH | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2014)\n\nJoe Garwood, B.S. ‘78, grew up on a farm in southern Indiana, farming with his uncles while working with his father who was an independent oil producer. The independent spirit shown by his father, Francis, would guide Garwood through his professional career. “Simply put, Joe is an entrepreneur,” said his nominator, Bernie Engel, head of the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering. Garwood excelled during a 21-year career with DuPont’s Agricultural Products Division where he received DuPont’s highest marketing award: the Corporate Marketing Excellence Recognition ( CMER). But it was Garwood’s entrepreneurial spirit that led him to the private sector where he is involved in several businesses. Garwood is co-manager and director of corporate operations of their entities. “I’m very passionate about sharing the virtues of entrepreneurism with our students,” Garwood said. Why did you select Purdue as the place to continue your education? When I was 7 years old, my dad brought me to campus just to have a look around. He said, “One day you’ll be going to school here.” In high school, my guidance counselor encouraged me to apply to IU so I would have options. I never opened their response letter when it arrived at our house. Where was your favorite place on campus to study? Either in the student lounge in the ABE building or at the airport. I spent a lot of time in the lounge and I loved just hanging out at the airport. What do you miss most about your college days at Purdue? Most definitely, I miss all the people and the friendships I made there. Simply put: the people. When I talk to students today, I joke that I was on the fast track. It took me six years to get a four-year degree! But I wouldn’t trade a minute of it. When I wasn’t in class, farming, or selling Electrolux vacuums door to door, I was working for Don Rhine and Les Whaley in the ABE building. They were staff members who built or fixed everything in the ABE building. They were mentors when I needed it. They became family to me. Along with Dr. Krutz and Prof. Lien, they coached and encouraged me to buckle down and finish school so I’d have a multiple of choices for my future. What was the most difficult course you took at Purdue? What made it so difficult for you? IM 200 (Introduction to Accounting). At that time I couldn’t see myself having a need to know the material. I felt that kind of work should to be left to those who enjoyed it. I thought, “Why do they want me to learn this?” Ironically, today I find myself spending more time with our accountant than anyone else in the operation. What is the best advice you have ever given? To whom did you give the advice? You don’t know what you don’t know ... and it’s those things that can put you out of business. I have returned to campus many times to share life lessons with our students, particularly those interested in entrepreneurship (In November, Garwood was one of five alumni panelists participating the College of Agriculture’s Entrepreneurship Day). I talk a lot about the value of having good mentors; that you’ll need one long before you think you will. Most major problems can be prevented if you stay in counsel with your mentor. If you do run into a problem for the first time, it’s better to seek the advice of someone who knows how to handle it, rather than to try and resolve it on your own.\n\nYonas Gizaw (Cincinnati, OH | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2008)\n\nWhether the mission is a better-tasting potato chip or an environmentally friendly laundry detergent, success follows a proven sequence: Yonas Gizawanalyzes questions, addresses challenges, and formulates solutions.As a principal scientist for Procter and Gamble Co., a $68 billion company with more than twenty billion-dollar brand names, Gizaw leads the development of sustainable and renewable biopolymers for global laundry and fabric care categories.“These efforts mean consumers enjoy our products more — their fabrics feel and smell better — or a load of laundry requires only a half-cup of detergent rather than a full cup,” Gizaw explains.On corporate and global scales, the impact of new product formulationsmagnifies exponentially — often significantly reducing the amount of petroleum-based polymers used in detergents and softeners and replacing them with biodegradable, renewable formulations.In 2005, Gizaw received Procter &Gamble’s Innovation Award for are formulation of Downey Fabric Softener,a process that developed high performing biopolymers that serve asco-actives with the product’s traditional actives. This breakthrough saved millions of dollars for P&G and currently is modeled in Mexico, China, and Europe. Throughout his twelve-year career with Procter & Gamble, Gizaw has spiraled from a research scientist in the company snack and Beverage Technology Divisionto the Division’s senior research scientist. His current position combines a keen knack for integrating technology and business, with a passion for leadership and collaboration.“I’ve always sought the biggest challenge I can face,’ he says. “Solutions bring me the greatest satisfaction.”Resolutions have a lighter side as well. For the past eight years, Gizaw has volunteered as a Big Brother, relishing the friendships and successes of two fortunate young men.“Academic excellence at Purdue University, a leading university in carbohydrate research, extended to faculty willing to mentor beyond the call of duty. The people and surroundings were conducive to education and learning as a person.” Reginald Gomes (Distinguished Ag Alumni: 1992)\n\nDr. Gomes currently serves as Dean of College of Agriculture at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. He has distinguished himself as a scientist, educator, and administrator. Dr. Gomes was the first recipient of the Ohio Sigma Xi Research Award recognizing the state’s outstanding young scientist. He was also named a Fullbright Distinguished Traveling Professor to Zagreb University in Yugoslavia and a Fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.\n\nDr. Gomes is an accomplished teacher and researcher specializing in basic and applied research in biochemistry, endocrinology, and physiology of animal reproduction. He was co-editor of the four-volume treatise, The Testis, and a four-volume Proceeding of the Tenth International Congress on Animal Reproduction and Artificial Insemination. He has also authored or co-authored nearly 16 book chapters and more than 90 scientific journals articles and abstracts.\n\nDr. Gomes was the first Head of the combined Department of Animal Sciences at the University of Illinois. Dr. Gomes was named Dean of the College of Agriculture in 1989 and is responsible for all aspects of the University’s agricultural programs in the State of Illinois. He was a member of the 1988 Illinois delegation that elevated Egerton College in Kenya to full University status. He has also been instrumental in negotiation agreements between the University of Illinois and institutions in Egypt and the People’s Republic of China.\n\nZarrell T.G.

Green (Indianapolis, IN | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 1999)\n\nJoann K. Green graduated from Purdue in 1977 with a BS in Landscape Architecture. She is president of Claire Bennett Associates of Indianapolis. Here are some of her thoughts on education, career, and life: On her earliest influences: “Growing up with four older brothers, I was always treated like one of the ‘guys,’ and my parents encouraged me to take on many nontraditional responsibilities and challenges. “My father had a profound influence on me as a person and as a professional. He always said, ‘You can never go wrong by trying to treat others fairly.’ In my early years, when I’d get frustrated with a client, he’d remind me the client is almost always right. I’ve grown to understand exactly what he was talking about. “My father was a construction project manager, and he used to take me to his construction sites. He would look at these huge buildings and stand in awe of what had come out of the ground-what he had been a part of. For many years, my father was invited to Purdue once a year to speak to civil and structural engineering classes.” On choosing Purdue: “Two of my older brothers graduated from Purdue with degrees in mechanical and civil engineering. Both of them secured good positions, and their experiences impressed upon me the need to go to a school where I could be assured of finding desired employment right after graduation. Purdue also had an outstanding academic reputation.” On choosing landscape architecture: “In the 1970s, many students were selecting interests based on causes, and the environment was my cause. At that time, there were areas in Indianapolis that were very unattractive and insensitive to the natural environment. I remember driving down Keystone Avenue, an early poor example of suburban strip development, and thinking to myself, ‘What can I do to make sure this kind of development doesn’t continue?’ I also wanted to study something that would combine my interests in technology and art. I felt landscape architecture would be a good marriage of the two.” On her most significant professional accomplishment: “I am most rewarded by my role in the design of public spaces. I often see the trails I’ve designed, and see them being used and enjoyed by families. I take every opportunity I’m offered to appropriately and creatively plan and protect the environment. That is what’s so great about what I do-I get involved in everything from planning pocket parks to county-wide land use strategies. I enjoy all the aspects equally.” Her life philosophy: “I try to treat each day as a gift. This attitude helps me keep my life in perspective. It also helps me to focus on the appropriate treatment of others.” Booklet highlights/Green Education B.S., Purdue University, Landscape Architecture, 1977 Registered Landscape Architect in Indiana since 1982 Career 1992-present Claire Bennett Associates, Inc.

Her unwavering interest in livestock led her to major in animal science as an undergraduate at Purdue University. Although her career began because of an intense love of animals, Greene's paramount talent is clearly communication. As Vice President and Team Leader at Meyocks and Priebe Advertising, Greene is a powerful liaison between food production companies and consumer retailing. She has been vital in the success of many agricultural products, and a catalyst in the development of new agricultural businesses.\n\nGreene joined Meyocks and Priebe in 1990 while the agency was in its formative stages. Utilizing the team concept of business management, Meyocks and Priebe has emerged at the forefront of advertising companies, and ranks today among the top 355 advertising companies in the United States. Among the agency's clients are such eminent companies as Bayer Animal Health, Kemin Industries, and ABS Global.\n\nPrior to her affiliation with Meyocks and Priebe, Greene's past successes in the industry lent her prominence in her current position. She was a sales representative for such agencies as Elanco Animal Health and Dakon Implement Distributors. As account supervisor for CMF&Z Advertising in Cedar Rapids, Iowa from 1989 to 1996, Greene and her team joined forces with Dow-Elanco in a product launch effort. The affiliation led to the resurgence of the insecticide Lorsban, increasing the market share of the product by 5.7% in one year.\n\nGreene is very active in the National Agri-Marketing Association (NAMA), chairing several important committees and serving as National Vice President in 1996. Despite all of her professional activities, she has found time to operate a crop and cattle farming operation alongside her husband, analyzing and appreciating on a personal level the importance of some of the products she represents.\n\nFor contributions to her profession and community, and for bringing distinction to her alma mater, Purdue University School of Agriculture is proud to present the Distinguished Alumna Award to Mrs. Jill G. Greene.\n\nDouglas Griffin (Duluth, GA | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2011)\n\nThe easiest way for Doug Griffin to describe what he does day-to-day at AGCO is to describe the people who report to him — three product marketing directors who oversee different lines, plus managers of advertising, demand planning, pricing, training, and advanced technology solutions. Griffin’s team is responsible for marketing a broad range of agricultural equipment, including the Challenger and Massey Ferguson brands, among others. North American sales accounted for nearly $1.5 billion of the company’s $6.9 billion worldwide net sales in 2010. It’s not just Griffin’s career that’s in agriculture; his heart is there, too. He grew up on an Indiana farm. Through Purdue’s cooperative education program, he worked for the agricultural division of Peoria-based Caterpillar, Inc., which extended his degree program to five years but provided invaluable work experience. A stint in marketing changed his career direction, if not his academic major: he credits his agricultural engineering degree for giving him a technical foundation that has been an advantage in business. After graduation, he joined Caterpillar full time in sales and marketing. He had advanced to North American sales manager when the company sold its agricultural division to AGCO in 2002. Griffin could have stayed with Caterpillar in another assignment. But his entire life was grounded in agriculture, and he chose to remain in the industry by joining AGCO. There, he was able to leverage the relationships he had developed over 15 years. He characterizes his managerial style as empowering qualified employees to perform well: “I’m interested in their ideas more than I am telling them what to do. I’m all about hiring good people and letting them be great.” Outside of work, family time is his first priority. Griffin, his wife Renee, and their three children live on a small hobby farm and spend a lot of time riding horses, kayaking, and hiking together.\n\nDale Griffin (Cutler, IN | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2015)\n\nPurdue professor Natalie Carroll calls Dale Griffin, BS ’81, BS ’83, MS ’85, “the most dedicated volunteer I have encountered in my 20 years at Purdue.” And certainly many of the 3,000 or so students he has taught during a 29-year career at Rossville High School would have to agree. Griffin considers FFA members who are students of his own former students his “grand students.” He has six “great-grand student chapters” who join his Rossville chapter every summer for a whitewater rafting trip in Tennessee.\n\nHe teaches five courses at Rossville and oversees the landscaping of approximately 20 homes in the community each year. He has arranged international trips for 60 students and chaperones since 2009 and has hosted around 15 Purdue Agricultural Education student teachers in his classes. He has spoken in seven different Purdue classes during his career and has spent countless hours supporting state- and county-level 4-H and FFA events.\n\nWhich Purdue faculty member had the most profound impact on your professional career?\n\nThere have been a few, including, but not limited to the following.\n\nUntil he died in 2012, Dr. James Carson and I communicated on a regular basis. He was my academic advisor. While I never had him for class, for me, he was the most helpful man ever.\n\nMerle Brown was the manager of Purdue’s Dairy Research facility. He took a chance and hired me, a city boy from Indianapolis, as a Purdue student. He taught me more about animal agriculture than any living soul — and he had the patience of Job with me. Believe me, he needed it. My first job as a herdsman was at a boy’s ranch in North Dakota. The place was a mess. I called Merle weekly to ask questions and he always helped me out.\n\nHoward Martin was the assistant manager at the Purdue dairy research facility. He and his wife, Mary, fed me and clothed me, and basically adopted me, and got me through my first rural Indiana winter alive. They became lifelong friends.\n\nJerry Peters, my student teacher advisor, pushed for perfection. I didn’t much like him, but learned to appreciate his efforts as I aged!\n\nWere you a good student when you were at Purdue?\n\nHa! Look at my grades! My first four years I barely passed ... a 4.01 on a 6-point scale, and you had to have a cumulative grade point average of 4.0 to graduate! The grades got better for the second bachelor’s and master’s when I was a residence hall counselor in Wiley for two years. I could only have one job — always before I needed two or three jobs to pay all the bills. When I worked at the Dairy Center I recorded two hours for every 20 because Merle said he would hire me for whatever I had on work study (which was around $400). I worked at the Dairy Center for experience, and then two other jobs to pay for my college. I didn’t have time to party, and I was so tired I would fall asleep any time that I stopped long enough to close my eyes.\n\nWhat is the best advice you got while you were at Purdue?\n\nWho gave you the advice?\n\nGive as you have been given. Dr. Carson told me that in year six or seven when I was a residence hall counselor. I was having problems with a resident and was frustrated. As usual, I went to Dr. Carson and he told me this quote — a most profound quote if you think about it. I’ve lived the remainder of my life with that quote as my guide.\n\nEdwin M. Grote (Milton, WI | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2018)\n\nNot only was Ed Grote highly driven as a graduate student at Purdue University, but he was also the most organized and hardest working, his major professor, World Food Prize Laureate Gebisa Ejeta, recalls. He was — and is — consistently described as polite, humble and friendly. “Ed is a nonstop mentor,” says a fellow DuPont Fellow. And he’s one of the world’s most successful plant breeders. • A named inventor on 634 patent applications to date. • A named inventor on 113 issued patents to date. • “By far the most productive corn breeder within Pioneer for commercial sales.” His corn inbred line inventions have sold about 4.25MM units of hybrid corn per year over the past seven years, with cumulative sales of 30MM units of hybrid corn. • He has been a top-five contributor to worldwide hybrid corn sales each of the last seven years. • He has been the No. 1 contributor to worldwide hybrid corn sales four of the past seven years. He began his career as Corn Research Manager with Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc. He ran corn breeding programs in eastern Iowa, northern Iowa, and southern Wisconsin. The “exemplary scientist” has a “demonstrated ability to succeed in different breeding and production environments,” a coworker notes. During his graduate study years at Purdue, Grote multitasked, coaching undergraduates in the Agronomy Club and Crop Judging Teams, in addition to his studies and his research assistantship obligations. His mentoring skills are widely respected. He leads by example, provides a superior technical research education, and incorporates his many years of experience to allow pupils to gain practical insights.\n\nKun-Liang Guan (Ann Arbor, MI | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2006)\n\nIn the global fight against life-threatening diseases, the most significant strides often are the tiniest, such as scrutinizing how genetics and the environment affect the growth of a single cell. Marshal the talent and passion of educator and researcher Kun-Liang Guanand analysis equals discovery.A native of the Republic of China, Guan’s distinguished career in biochemistry began in 1983 when he came to Purdue through the Chinese andU.S. Biochemistry Examination forAdmission, a program that selected about 50 of China’s brightest students for graduate study in the United States.While at Purdue he honed his research skills, pioneering the molecular biology expertise in Henry Weiner’s research group. Guan then joined the University of Michigan faculty, achieving full professor in less than ten years, and NamedProfessor in 2003.“Sometimes scientists find it difficult to communicate,” Guan admits of his highly technical domain, “and we can translate our own language.”He insists, however, layman’s terms best describe his current focus: finding ways to interfere with out-of-control cell growth, an initiative extremely relevant to cancer research. Guan’s latest findings led to a three-year clinical trial of the FDA-approved drug rapamycin, an immunosuppressant used for organ transplant patients. His research suggests rapamycin also may be effective in treating tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), an incurable multi-symptom genetic disorder in which tumors cause seizures, mental retardation, and kidney failure in one out of 6,000 individuals. The potential breakthrough is generating significant excitement among TSC patients. Even the most invigorating laboratory occasionally feels too small. When it does, Guan simply walks away. “Hiking in national parks gives me a different perspective. I climb a mountaintop, and I realize it’s a big world out there.”Purdue University’s traditional, thorough, and the solid curriculum was absolutely essential to my scientific career development. Learning to generate knowledge through research science, versus textbook learning, was a quantum leap for me.”\n\nEric J. Gustafson (Rhinelander, WI | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2010)\n\nFrom the window of an airplane over Indiana on a clear day, you would see a patchwork of fields, towns, cities, and scattered woodlots (forests). The pattern changes across different areas; over Wisconsin, for example, you would see more and larger forests. How forests are arranged over a broad scale—their size, relative age, and proximity to each other—affects the ecological processes for the plants and animals that live in them. Eric Gustafson is a scientist who, by advancing new ideas in the growing discipline of landscape ecology, has impacted academic thinking and the management of forest resources around the world. Gustafson grew up in Massachusetts, near his family’s tree farm in southern Vermont, where camping and backpacking gave him an early appreciation for the woods. Today, Gustafson directs theInstitute for Applied Ecosystem Studies, a unit of the Northern Research Station of the U.S. Forest Service. While some of his researchers and technicians work in the field, Gustafson is usually at a computer. As a modeler, he conducts experiments at scales of space and time that are not possible in real life. Gustafson has developed spatial pattern analysis software, which takes digital maps of ecological systems over large areas, quantifies measures of their characteristics, and relates them to forest's ecological health. At Purdue, he developed a timber harvest simulation called HARVEST. That led him to other scientists working on sophisticated software called LANDIS, for which Gustafson wrote additional modules. National Forest planners, state land management agencies, and large-scale land managers use Gustafson’s models to quantify the implications of their timber management choices. Gustafson publishes extensively and speaks frequently about his work, but he still makes time for the outdoors. He enjoys downhill skiing and hiking, especially with his daughter on April, 23. “The joy of seeing and understanding nature is why I love to be out in the woods,” he says.“I was not a landscape ecologist until I came to Purdue. In writing the software for my thesis, I discovered that I really enjoyed computer programming. Programming was the foot in the door’ that got me into simulation modeling.”\n\nNancy E. Lange (Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2012)\n\nNancy Everett Lange began her 30-yearcareer with Eli Lilly and Company in 1981as a sales representative for agriculturalchemicals with its Elanco division. She hasadvanced through management positionsthat reflect both her scientific knowledgeand expertise in human relations. Today,as senior director of global recruiting andstaffing, she leads the company’s humanresources recruitment activities. Currentlyshe and her team are supporting recruitingefforts in many of the 125 countries whereLilly has business.Lange grew up in Indianapolis,unconnected in any way to agriculture.At age 12, she boarded a bus to TiptonCounty, thrilled that the $1 hourly wagefor detasseling corn was double herbabysitting income. She would detassel cornfor the next 10 years, becoming a crew bossand paying for college with her earnings.She also became interested in hybridcorn, so when it was time to declare amajor at Purdue, Lange chose Agronomy,not entirely sure what it involved. Shediscovered she enjoyed the subject,worked as an undergraduate researchassistant and was named OutstandingSenior Woman (now the Flora RobertsAward) when she graduated in Soil andCrop Management.Lange was responsible for Lilly’s U.S.recruiting and staffing until she was givenher current, global assignment in 2010.Roughly half of her years at the companyhave been in human resources, but she hasmoved back and forth between thebusiness and HR. “Working in discovery,development, regulatory, and medical —this helped me to understand the biggerpicture of the company,” she says. “I sawthe value chain of the products. I amfamiliar with many divisions of thecompany, which has been a benefit to me.”Lilly recognized her outstanding leadershipin 2000 with the highest honor given to anemployee, the Chairman’s Ovation Award.Lange and her husband Thomas havethree children, two of whom are Purduegraduates. She also is active in theirchurch, and her tutoring at a localelementary school has led her to furthersupport a family for whom English is asecond language.\n\nJane L. Lavey (Anderson, IN | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2017)\n\nJane Lavey manages Nestlé’s food safety program in an era of changing regulation and increased public scrutiny. She leads the team responsible for Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), and the systematic and science-based approach for assessing and controlling or eliminating all food safety hazards. She also manages quality-training programs and investigates consumer complaints.\n\nLavey grew up in a family of teachers in Louisville, Kentucky. Because she excelled at math and science, she was encouraged to explore a career in engineering, and Purdue’s reputation attracted her to West Lafayette.\n\nFood process engineering turned out to be the right match for Lavey’s affinity for chemistry. Faculty members who influenced her career path included agricultural and biological engineering professors Bernie Tao, Michael Ladisch, and Martin Okos.\n\nLavey served as president of the student chapter of the American Society of Agricultural Engineers and was active in Zeta Tau Alpha sorority. The social opportunities available at a Big Ten school, in addition to “an excellent education from excellent professors,” made her Purdue experience a positive one, she says. She regularly returns to campus to offer professional insight to ABE students and faculty, and is called on to speak to high school students about engineering as a career.\n\nWith knowledge gained from steadily increasing responsibilities in quality control, training, and safety at Eli Lilly and Company and Fisher Clinical Services, Lavey came to her current position at Nestlé in August 2012. Her longstanding commitment to quality control and food safety is personal: “The thing that drives me is the idea that somebody in your family is going to be consuming what you’re manufacturing or producing. I want to have an impact on that.”\n\nLavey has two children who are adopted from China and is active in the Indianapolis group, Families with Children from China (FCC). She leads her daughter’s unique Girl Scout troop of girls adopted from China, which developed from FCC and incorporates Chinese culture into its programs. She also is an avid cyclist who has completed the one-day, 160-mile Ride Across Indiana five times.\n\n“In visiting high schools, I’ve been surprised that girls who are good in math and science are often pushed toward science, not engineering. They don’t realize there are a lot of different job opportunities — that you can take the thought processes and problem-solving into many areas.”\n\n2012-present Food Safety and Compliance Specialist, Nestlé\n\n2010-2012 Fisher Clinical Services Quality Assurance Representative, 2011-2012 Associated Consultant, Clinical Trial Supply Operations, 2010-2011\n\n2008 Product R&D Operations Group Achievement Award, Eli Lilly and Company\n\n2002 Outstanding Alumna Award, Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, Purdue University\n\n1992-2010 Eli Lilly and Company Associate Consultant, Clinical Trial Supply Operations, 2008-2010 Senior Quality Standards Associate, 2003-2008 GMP Quality Control Improvement Team, 2002 Assistant Senior Quality Assurance Representative, Elanco Animal Health and Bulk Pharmaceutical Manufacturing, 1998-2003 Technical Services Representative, Animal Health Manufacturing, 1992-1998\n\n1992 BS, Food Process Engineering and BS, Biochemistry, Purdue University\n\nKay A. Lawton (Durham, NC | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2018)\n\nAs an undergraduate, she majored in Recreation Resources Management. She pursued a master’s degree while majoring in Ornamental Horticulture and Floriculture Physiology. Her PhD thesis at Purdue University was on “Gene Expression and Regulation During Carnation Flower Senescence.” But biotechnology is where Kay Lawton has made her mark. Her unique abilities and research discoveries have spanned medical and agricultural fields. Her work on natural disease mechanisms in plants is seminal, her accomplishments to science and industry are far-reaching, and her contributions to human health and wellbeing touch lives across the globe. She rose through the ranks at Syngenta Biotechnology Research Inc. to become Principal Scientist and Global Team Leader. Lawton managed genomics discoveries to improve disease resistance, increase crop protection and enhance crop production. She’s been at Metabolon Inc. in North Carolina since 2005, currently as Vice President of Intellectual Property. Lawton is a co-inventor on 50 issued/ pending patents including methods for determining insulin sensitivity with biomark- ers, metabolomics profiling of prostate cancer, biomarkers for monitoring insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance, biomarkers for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), methods for breeding disease resistance into plants, and plant-derived pathogen, root-specific, and chemical- induced promoters. Her discoveries have had significant impact and have led to the commercialization of several products, such as tests for insulin resistance (Quantose IR) and glucose tolerance (Quantose IGT). The development of Quantose IGT provides a novel and easy method to identify impaired glucose tolerance using a single fasting blood sample. The much simpler test could curtail the onset of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Quantose IR is the first and only clinically developed and validated laboratory developed test (LDT) to measure insulin resistance.\n\nMark H. Legan (Coatsville, IN | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2005)\n\nCan a young couple who don’t ownland build a successful agriculturaloperation? In 1989, Mark and PhyllisLegan decided to find out. Theyapproached long-time friends who had“an old set of hog facilities,” establisheda 180-sow herd and started working,side-by-side.“I either had to do it or I’d wonder mywhole life if I could,” says Mark Legan,who was 29 at the time and giving up aseven-year Extension educator career forhis dream.Today, the operation employs anotherfour, owns 1,000 acres of cropland and700 sows that produce about 15,000pigs a year.The Legans mark their success as anachievement. “We’re a first-generation,startup farm, and we’ve grown it to aviable size and, at least to this point,we’re maintaining it from a financialstandpoint,” Mark says.Their success, though, has not been atany cost. “We are part of and proud ofour community,” he says. “We recognizethat pigs stink, so we do what we can tominimize odor and manage properly.”They’re also both involved incommunity service. Mark’s serviceincludes his church, Farm Bureau, thecounty board of zoning appeals and fairboard, and currently he serves as theagricultural representative on Indiana’sDepartment of EnvironmentalManagement water pollution controlboard. “An important part of who we areand what we do is being involved in thecommunity,” he says.Like their business, the Legans sharea common activity that includes theirdaughter, Beth. “We like trail riding andhorse camping,” Mark says. “We enjoya business with animals, and ourpleasure is with animals as well. We ownquarter horses, and my wife adopted amustang. It’s something we do togetheras a family.”“I agree with Abraham Lincoln’s view ofagriculture as a ‘profitable and agreeablecombination of labor and thought.’Farming gives me the opportunityfor physical as well as mental work.”\n\nDonald J. Leopold (Syracuse, NY | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2014)\n\nDon Leopold, Ph.D. ‘84, is a distinguished teaching professor and chair of the Department of Environmental and Forest Biology at the State University of New York-College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse, NY. “He is recognized as a distinguished teacher through his dedication to teaching both undergraduate and graduate students while advancing our scientific understanding of ecological processes within forests and wetlands of the northeastern United States,” said his nominator, Rob Swihart, head of Purdue’s Department of Forestry and Natural Resources. Leopold has produced six books, more than 60 publications in refereed journals, and 12 publications in proceedings describing numerous factors that influence ecological processes within northeastern forests. Under his direction, more than 60 graduate students have completed their theses or dissertations and he has served as principal or co-principal investigator on more than $30 million in grants to support his research program. Which Purdue faculty member had the most profound impact on your professional career? George Parker, a forestry professor and my major professor, had a significant impact on my career track. He always treated me like a colleague and never suggested that anything wasn’t possible (even if he might have thought otherwise). Why did you select Purdue as the place to continue your education? Purdue provided me an opportunity to assist with instruction in dendrology, which I had experience with from the University of Kentucky. Additionally, I was aware of the very strong academic reputation of Purdue, which I thought was so important for a doctoral degree. Where was your favorite place on campus to study? I spent most days and nights in my office at the department, often talking about science, politics, etc., with other grad students in my office and adjacent offices. Were you a good student when you were at Purdue? Not in the sense of having an outstanding grade point average, but I was intensely interested in my subject material and spent most waking moments thinking about forest ecology, trees, and related topics. What was the most difficult course you took at Purdue? What made it so difficult for you? I avoided calculus until I had to take it in my Ph.D. program. I was so proud when I earned an 87% on the first exam, until I found out that this grade was curved to a C-. During my very first semester, I understood just how tough courses would be at Purdue. What is the best advice you got while you were at Purdue? Who gave you the advice? It wasn’t necessarily advice but I’ll never forget Dr. Parker telling me after he gave a talk to a large audience at a national professional society meeting that he still got very nervous before each talk. I often think of his admission before some of my dozens of talks each year. What is the best advice you have ever given? To whom did you give the advice? I often tell many of my advisees who are contemplating graduate programs that they shouldn’t be so consumed by the idea that a specific graduate research project will define their careers for life. Purdue prepared me for pursuing so many different interesting projects. I couldn’t be any happier with the foundation I earned at Purdue.\n\nScott Lineback (Omaha, NE | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2013)\n\nScott Lineback, M.S. 1989, Ph.D. 1994, is the vice president of process innovation at ConAgra Foods in Omaha, Nebraska, where he leads a team focused on identifying, evaluating, and commercializing new process technologies.

As research director, Lopes introduced a new management model for research projects focusing on teams assembled around core themes. The success of the model resulted in Lopes being appointed Head of Research and Development at EMBRAPA, the national agricultural research corporation of Brazil, in 2000. A plant geneticist by training, Lopes’ major scientific contributions include the development and release of new varieties and improved maize germplasm for tropical areas. “The research he completed as a graduate student at Purdue made important contributions to our knowledge of how different storage proteins are synthesized and packaged in the maize kernel, a critical source of protein for both humans and animals,” said his nominator, Peter Goldsbrough, head of Purdue’s Department of Botany and Plant Pathology. Why did you select Purdue as the place to continue your education? I had received my B.S. degree in agronomy from a Brazilian university that has very close ties to Purdue. Many of its professors and administrators received their degrees from Purdue. Also, the founder and former president of my organization, EMBRAPA, received his Ph.D. from Purdue, as did many colleagues I met during the early phases of my career in Brazil. All of them spoke very proudly of their experience attending graduate school at Purdue. Their admiration was decisive in guiding me to choose Purdue to continue my education. What do you miss most about your college days at Purdue? Graduate school is about taking a deep dive into something. Having a chance to choose an interesting problem and to perform research and to critically analyze the different dimensions of that problem and implement successful courses of action was something special at that early stage of my graduate training. I also had the opportunity to experience a healthy research group environment and an effective relationship with my advisor. That experience had an impact on my training and in my professional life. Learning to work in a large research group, with several graduate students and post-docs - all of whom are extremely talented, motivated, and highly competitive - was a big challenge and also a very rewarding experience. What was the most difficult course you took at Purdue? What made it so difficult for you? Biology 520. Complex reasoning and interpretation were valued in that class, not so much black and white-type answers. Being a foreigner, the language barrier had me at a disadvantage when elaborate arguments and answers were required in quizzes and tests. I studied very hard and even entertained an illusion of getting an A. I admit I was hugely disappointed when I learned that I had received a B in that course. What is the best advice you got while you were at Purdue? Who gave you the advice? Confidence is a key to success in whatever we undertake. Prof. Larkins always tried to make us feel confident, energized, and excited about the work we had to do. He never stated it as advice, but I interpret his attitude, support, and encouragement as the best “advice” I have received in grad school: “Trust yourself, be creative, and follow your impulses.”\n\nJeffrey M. Luckman (Newport News, VA | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2005)\n\nAt a young age, Jeffrey Luckmanlearned one of life’s key lessons as heworked alongside his father, a comptrollerin the meat wholesale business: Workhard; give back; and you’ll succeed.You’ll grow along the way, too.A native New Yorker, Luckman took hisfirst big step when he left the east coastfor Purdue, drawn by the university’sreputation in veterinary medicine andagriculture. “My parents taught me to actand think independently,” Luckmanrecalls, “even when my choices took mefar from home.”Learning the production side throughvolunteer work on a hog farm and hisfirst job as district sales manager forDeKalb Swine Breeders were part of thematuring process, and helped honeLuckman’s professional path — one thatcombined a love of animals, an interestin genetics and animal science, andstrong people skills.After seven years in sales, anddistinction as the top breeding stocksales representative in Indiana, Luckmanembraced a new challenge. Hisaccomplishments in the livestockprocurement arena—first with Kahn’s,then John Morrell & Company and,presently, Smithfield Foods—havefocused on production, research, sales,and management.Throughout his tenure as vicepresident for livestock procurement forSmithfield Foods, Luckman hascontributed significantly to the company’sgrowth, from $1 billion in annual salesten years ago to $10 billion in 2004. Heis responsible for three domestic andthree foreign subsidiaries and is creditedwith taking Polish subsidiary Animexfrom near bankruptcy to profitability inPrograms developed by Luckmansignificantly enhanced the success andexpansion of Polish hog suppliers.Throughout the journey, Luckman hasalways remembered his father’s formula.Rewards, he says, have been reflected inhis growth, and the advancements of others.“The education and knowledge Purdue providedhas enabled me to make lasting contributionsin business - nationally, internationally,and in my community. I hope to give back toPurdue as much as the university gave me.”\n\nAlbert E. Lund (Wilmington, Delaware | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2003)\n\nAlbert Lund will tell you first-hand: It’s a bug-eat-bug world out there.\n\nHe learned the lesson early in life from a first-generation naturalist, his late father Horace Lund, former head of entomology at the University of Georgia. The pair spent many weekends hiking and camping in favorite spots such as North Carolina’s Pisgah National Forest. They’d head in different directions, collect insects for hours, and then reunite at “base camp” for microscopic looks at their finds and discussions of each insect’s adaptations.\n\n“Dad taught me the power of observation and the ability to train my eye to see what others don’t see,” Lund says. “It’s a real jungle out there, and a fascinating, natural drama is always unfolding.” Through his father’s eyes, Lund learned to appreciate not only nature’s panoramic beauty—mountain meadows and deciduous forests—but also intricate snapshots of the natural world—a beetle’s tenacious fight against an anthill or a shrew’s rapid respiration rate, a stress reaction to its low level on the food chain.\n\n“In many ways, Dad’s interest in nature started me in biology and led me to entomology,” he says.\n\nAvid campers, Lund and his wife Rea, also an entomologist and Purdue graduate, have passed on the powers of natural observation to their sons, Timothy and Wesley. And, as was true decades ago, father and sons have recorded memorable adventures.\n\n“There was a hurricane off the East Coast the same weekend Timothy and I were camping in West Virginia,” Lund recalls. “The storm was predicted to move out to sea, but instead it changed direction, backed up, and dumped torrential rain on West Virginia. We spent the whole time bushwhacking over steep terrain to avoid the rising rivers.\n\n“In general, I prefer a much less athletic approach to the outdoors!”\n\n1972 B.S., Entomology, University of Georgia\n\n1974 M.S., Entomology (Physiology), Purdue University\n\n1974 Pi Kappa Phi, Purdue University\n\n1975-1977 David Ross Research Fellow, Purdue University\n\n1978 Ph.D., Entomology (Physiology-Toxicology), Purdue University\n\n1978 Grass Research Fellow, Marine Biology Laboratory, Woods Hole\n\n1978-1980 Post-doctorate, Neuropharmacology, Northwestern University Medical School\n\n1978-1980 NIH National Research Service Award, Northwestern University Medical School\n\n1980-1983 Research Biologist, DuPont\n\n1983-1984 Group Leader, DuPont\n\n1984-1987 Research Supervisor, DuPont\n\n1987-1989 Supervisor, Insect Control Group of Discovery, DuPont\n\n1989-1991 Network Plans Manager, DuPont\n\n1991-1993 Research Manager, DuPont\n\n1993-1999 Insecticide Technology Manager, DuPont\n\n1999-present Manager, Research and Development Asia- Pacific, DuPont\n\n2002 Agriculture & Nutrition Research Accomplishment Award, E.I.

From these masters, I learned to frame and approach research problems and to thoroughly enjoy hunting for the truth behind the problem.”\n\nJohn Madia (Carmel, IN | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2007)\n\nHome runs have long been on John Madia’s mind — from his Purdue baseball scholarship days to his nearly 30-year career with The Dow Chemical Co., and even today’s pastime, Indiana Bulls youth baseball. The story began in his hometown of Utica, New York, when a Boilermaker alumnus spotted him on the baseball diamond and talked about Purdue. Growing up in a family that bred racehorses, Madia had long been interested in animal science; early on, he traveled with his father, who was a representative for animal health companies. His interests were a good fit for Purdue, on the field and in the classroom. He graduated in 1978, and immediately signed on to work for Dow, where he has been ever since. “Dow provided me an opportunity to have many different careers in the same company,” Madia says. He has held posts with ever-increasing responsibilities in sales, marketing, development, Six Sigma implementation, and human resources, working in New York City and Rochester, N.Y.; Minneapolis; Midland, Mich.; Philadelphia; and since 1990, Indianapolis. “I’ve had opportunities to travel, to meet people all over the world and to work in the company’s global functions,” he says. “Those are experiences no one can take away.” Today, as vice president of human resources, Madia is the global focal point for manufacturing and engineering, research and development, shared services, and human resource information technology. Outside work, the father of four is devoted to two youth organizations, serving board posts for the Indiana Bulls Baseball Organization and the national FFA Foundation Sponsor’s Board. While he’s no longer spending time in the dugout, he is often in the bleachers, rooting as his children compete in various sports. “The people at Purdue always had great expectations for me and other students. They taught that way, talked that way, counseled that way. Because of that, I approached the work world with a high degree of confidence.”\n\nPaavo Makinen (Helsinki, Finland | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2011)\n\nPaavo Mäkinen finds the term “diplomat,” as applied to his career, “a bit flattering.” In his current role with the European Commission, he calls himself a generalist who focuses on communications. But his impact on Finland’s integration into the global economy makes a compelling case that he is indeed his country’s foremost agricultural diplomat. His did not have a rural upbringing; he grew up near Helsinki, with a few years spent in Sydney, Australia. His decision to study agriculture came about “mainly [because] I knew nothing about it,” he says. Such curiosity led him to Purdue on a Fulbright Scholarship. His doctoral thesis at the University of Helsinki — on the effects of various agricultural policies on agricultural structures — was the foundation for his subsequent service to Finnish and international agriculture. In 1991, he was asked to draft the chapter on agriculture for the Finnish government’s report on possible membership in the European Union (EU). During this time Finnish agriculture would transition from a highly protected industry that served broad consumer needs in a country of 5 million people, to a more specialized, internationally competitive sector. The historic negotiations were both challenging and personally satisfying, as Mäkinen worked to educate farmers and the public in Finland about their new role in the EU, which the nation joined in 1995. The EU tapped him to head its unit responsible for international relations in agriculture with Asia, Oceania, Africa, and Latin America. He then returned to Finland to lead the Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners, where he bridged Finnish farmers and the changing international environment. He has represented the EU in Finland since 2005 and expects to return to Brussels in September 2011 in a new role relating to international agriculture policy. While at Purdue, Mäkinen joined the choir of a small Lutheran church in Lafayette, and he and his wife remain enthusiastic singers. Major choral pieces — think Handel’s Messiah — “make you forget your daily troubles,” the baritone says.\n\nWilliam Mann (Mermom, IN | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 1995)\n\nMr. Mann is President of Mann Seed Farms, Inc., which produces public and private soybean and wheat seed stock. Mann SeedFarms is also a contract seed corn and wheat grower for PioneerHi-Bred International. Upon graduation from Purdue University,Mr. Mann started full-time farming. His operation currently includes a 1400-acre family-owned and operated farm consisting of corn, soybeans, wheat, and vegetable production that he manages with his wife and two sons. In addition, the farm has a significant swine enterprise. While a student at Purdue, Mr. Mann farmed 300 acres, rented from 26 different landlords in Marion County, with his father and grandfather. In spite of these responsibilities, he found time to actively participate in campus organizations. He was a member of the Purdue Marching Band, Alpha Zeta and the Purdue SoilJudging Team. He was also president of the Agronomy Club.Mr. Mann has been one of Indiana's outstanding agricultural leaders. He is a past president of the Indiana Soybean GrowersAssociation and past vice president of the Indiana Com GrowersAssociation. He was also on the board of directors of PublicVarieties Inc. and the Sullivan County Farmers Home AdministrationAdvisory Board. He currently serves as treasurer of the Agricultural Alumni Seed Improvement Association and as vicechairman of the State Soil Conservation Board, an appointment by the Governor. He is a trustee for the Region Seven IndianaVocational Technical School and is the Sullivan County LegislativeCoordinator for Indiana Farm Bureau, Inc. Mr. Mann has served Purdue Agriculture as a member of the Southwest PurdueAgricultural Center Advisory Committee. Prairie Farmer magazine named Mr. Mann a 1990 Master Farmer. Governor Orr honored him with the Sagamore of the Wabashdesignation in 1988 for his many contributions to the state of Indiana.\n\nEvandro Chartuni Mantovani (Sete Lagoas, Minas Gerais, Brazil | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2003)\n\nAfter a day that might include international collaborations, research in precision agriculture, and community service, Evandro Chartuni Mantovani likes to kick back, play a few popular Brazilian tunes on his wooden guitar, and maybe sing along. It’s the perfect cure for high-pressure days, he says.\n\n“When I play the guitar, many good feelings come to mind. It’s a way to enjoy life and to control the stress a bit,” he says. “When singing and playing with your soul, it looks like life is in another dimension, giving me a lot of good energy to move on.”\n\nInfluenced early by the Beatles and a friend who played the guitar, Mantovani was about 20 when he started playing, at first by ear. “Finally, last year I decided to take guitar classes,” he says. His favorites are samba, bossa nova, and romantic tunes. “I like to play the Brazilian popular music.”\n\nAlthough he doesn’t perform—preferring to play at home with family and friends—like the Beatles, he’s influenced others. “Because of my interest in playing guitar, my two sons have become excellent musicians, and they have a rock band that performs during weekends for fun.”\n\nSports, too, are a big interest, as participant and fan. At Purdue he played tennis and joined fellow Brazilians in intramural games on a team named “Brasa.” Today, he’s a fan, cheering many a weekend for the Minas Gerais’ Cruzeiro soccer team in national competition. He still takes to the tennis court about three times a week for matches of his own.\n\nEqually important, he says, is work for others. That currently includes serving as a member of the Hospital Nossa Senhora das Gracas Council. “I always give part of my time to help the community of Sete Lagoas.”\n\n1974 B.S., Agronomy, Vicosa Federal University, Brazil\n\n1975-present Senior Researcher, EMBRAPA, National Research Center for Corn and Sorghum, Brazil\n\n1981 M.S., Agricultural Engineering, Purdue University\n\n1984 Ph.D., Agricultural Engineering, Purdue University\n\n1992-1993 Adjunct Professor, University of Campinas, Brazil\n\n1993-1996 Agricultural, Commerce and Industry Secretary for the City of Sete Lagoas, Brazil\n\n1995,1996 Outstanding Secretary Award\n\n1999 Admitted as full member, Italy’s Club of Bologna Committee (international association of agriculture and agricultural mechanization experts)\n\n1999-2003 Vice President, Brazilian Society of Agriculture Engineering\n\n2000-2003 National Coordinator for Precision Agriculture Program in Brazil\n\n2002 Honorary Citizen of Sete Lagoas, Brazil\n\n2002 Outstanding Alumni Award, Agricultural and Biological Engineering, Purdue University\n\n“I consider my years at Purdue one of the more profitable times of my life. The quality of the courses, the library, student assistance, and advisors’ attention gave me the structure to develop my professional life.”\n\nBret D. Marsh (Carmel, Indiana | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2003)\n\nToday, Bret Marsh’s job as Indiana State Veterinarian is largely an administrative one in the state’s capital, but he brings to it hands-on experience growing up around livestock sales in Boone County.\n\nLike his work, his home, too, is a blend of town and country. In Carmel, he enjoys collecting fine china as well as creating a country-like setting in his yard.\n\nHis interest in china was sparked by an early gift from his city-raised wife, Polly, who gave him his first piece, a Lladro figurine of a veterinarian. Today, his collection includes both antique and new items, and Limoge china as well as Waterford crystal. “We mix it up,” Marsh says. “We’ve even gone to auctions to find them.”\n\nMore recent acquisitions were birth gifts for their children—a Waterford baby block for their son, Spencer, and a Pooh Limoge box for their daughter, Lacey.\n\nIn their yard of one-and-a-quarter acres, the Marsh family is at work implementing a landscape plan created for them by a Purdue landscape architect graduate. “It’s a hands-on project,” Marsh says. It began with tearing out 20year-old landscaping to create a garden that incorporates the property’s plentiful and mature trees. They’ve added cone flowers, daisies, and hastas to the creek-accented property and a swing to their giant oak tree, as well as more trees. “We enjoy the lot,” he says. “It gives us a taste of country in town.”\n\nGardening is a pastime that yields rewards beyond the greenery, too. “I think about things while working in the yard,” Marsh says. “It helps me clear out the cobwebs.”\n\n1981 B.S., Animal Sciences, Purdue University\n\n1984 Doctor of Veterinary Medicine, Purdue University\n\n1984-1986 Area Supervisor/Training Office, Meat and Poultry Inspection, Indiana State Board of Health\n\n1986-1994 Director, Swine Health Programs, Indiana State Board of Health\n\n1994-presen Indiana State Veterinarian, Indiana State Board of Health\n\n1997 Distinguished Alumnus Award, Purdue School of Veterinary Medicine\n\n1997 Sagamore of the Wabash\n\n2001 Industry Meritorious Service Award, Indiana Pork Producers\n\n2002 Veterinary Service Award, Indiana Veterinary Medical Association\n\n“At Purdue, I learned perseverance, to face challenges head-on, and to value the faculty members and people who shared my experiences.

Marx (Chevy Chase, MD | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 1995)\n\nDr. Marx is Deputy News Editor of Science magazine, the premiere United States weekly journal of general science, based in Washington, D.C. Following graduation from Purdue, she taught for five years at Fontbonne College in St. Louis. In 1972, she moved to Washington, D.C. as a newswriter for Science. She has edited three books during her tenure at the magazine, major portions of which were her own writings. She contributed three of the sixteen chapters to the book entitled A Revolution in Biotechnology. Dr. Marx serves a key role in science education as she interprets the latest research to other working scientists over a broad spectrum of biological sciences. Her columns in Science assume a graduate student level of understanding of the basic systems, but not specialist familiarity. Her writing is a model of clarity. She has exceptional talent for knowing what background information is needed to put the work in its proper context and to make the case for its importance. She accurately and concisely summarizes new findings within the context of what new information is needed to further our understanding of the system. Science demands that the news articles be brief and to the point, and the journal employs only the finest writers with a solid background in the sciences. Her articles have also appeared in the Washington Post, the New York Times Sunday Magazine, and The Sciences. In addition to her assignment at Science, she wrote the “In This Issue” feature for the Journal of Investigative Dermatology from 1988 to 1990. Dr. Marx stands out as one who has mastered the efficiency of words. She was a 1970 winner of a National Science Foundation Summer Research Grant. In 1976, the Mid-Atlantic Chapter of the American Medical Writers Association honored her with the Distinguished Medical Writing Award. She also received the Medical Journalism Award from the American College of Radiology. Dr. Marx is a member of the National Association of Science Writers and the D.C. Science Writers Association. She was named a Purdue University Old Master in 1983.\n\nApril C. Mason (Fort Collins, CO | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2005)\n\nOn the surface, working to combat iron deficiencies and Vitamin A blindness common to children in Indonesia, and addressing nutritional concerns among the elderly of Tippecanoe County in Indiana, present little in common. Yet for April Mason, this dichotomy anchors a principle central to her exemplary career as a food science educator and researcher: Deliverresources wherever they’re needed. Address issues important to recipients. Growing up in Italy and attending the overseas School of Rome afforded early glimpses of a global perspective. “I developed a passion for travel and the willingness to take calculated risks,” says Maison. “I also developed an appreciation of racial, cultural and religious differences, and the many ways people examine and study issues.”Ability to lead, and the spirit toembrace diversity, translated directly to development of an extensive range of food safety and nutrition programs, all focused on transferring university-based knowledge to the end user. The Safe Food for the Hungry program, an initiative launched by Mason in the early1990s was the most gratifying. Working with representatives from food banks and homeless shelters, Mason and colleagues developed food safety and nutrition programming targeted to not-for-profit food distribution programs nationwide. Her efforts garnered the Secretary ofAgriculture’s Team Honor award in 1996 and positioned Purdue University as a leader in the food safety arena. After nearly three decades as a Boilermaker, her decision to head west for new challenges at Colorado StateUniversity was heart wrenching, admit season. Yet living near the base of the Rockies—and hundreds of miles from midwest humidity—does have its perks.“There are wonderful trails throughoutFort Collins. I never get tired of gazing at the mountains. Every light, cloud and sunset looks completely different.”“Remember the individuals you learn with because each one leaves you with a gift. I’ve spent my career in higher education in order to pass those gifts along and, hopefully, to change things for the better.”\n\nBruce Maunder (Lubbock, TX | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 1997)\n\nDr. A Bruce Maunder, a native to Holdrege, Nebraska, is senior vice president of Sorghum Research at DeKalb Genetics Corp. Dedicated to developing insect resistance, drought tolerance, and disease resistance; his 37 years of research and development at DeKalb have brought Monumental Strides toward improving sorghum crops.\n\nDr. Maunder’s research programs span the globe, located in the United States as well as 17 other countries. The yellow endosperm germplasm he developed was widely utilized in breeding programs in Africa and Asia. Dr. Maunder also was responsible for creating and maintaining a collaborative breeding program with Argentina. His leadership in the development of greenbug tolerant hybrids has profoundly expanded the productivity of sorghum farmers in the United States. Varieties developed by his programs include more than 150 commercial sorghum hybrids grown on almost 10 million acres annually.\n\nWhile maintaining his research efforts, Dr. Maunder has strongly supported education. He has been a mentor for several undergraduate and graduate students, sponsored scholarships for students, delivered many guest lectures, and conducted vital internal training at DeKalb. He also served on the Dean’s Advisory Committee at Texas Tech University.\n\nDr. Maunder is a respected voice in several professional organizations. He is past president of the Crop Science Society of America. He is former member of the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, and served on a crop advisory committee for the National Germplasm System. Dr. Maunder has been honored with numerous distinctions, including an Honorary Doctorate of Science from the University of Nebraska in 1991. He also was named a Nebraska University Master Alumnus in 1989.\n\nVicki A. McCracken (Pullman, WA | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2015)\n\nVicki McCracken, MS ’81, PhD ’84, earned her Purdue degrees in the mid 1980s and headed west, landing at Washington State University, where she has been a faculty member for 31 years.\n\nSince 2011, McCracken has served the school located in Pullman, Washington, as the Associate Director of the School of Economic Sciences. McCracken has chaired or served on more than 150 graduate student thesis committees.\n\nAt Washington State, McCracken found her passion for teaching. She has taught extensively in both the undergraduate and graduate classrooms ever since. In the past three years, her teaching portfolio has included introductory econometrics, advanced food economics and marketing, managerial economics for decision-making, instructional practicum, and internships. She is currently chair of the Undergraduate Studies Committee with about 250 student majors.\n\nWhich Purdue faculty member had the most profound impact on your professional career?\n\nDr. Jim Binkley taught my first Purdue class, AgEcon 650, econometrics. It was the first time that I was forced to think critically about class material. This was well before “critical thinking” became a buzzword in education. He was a smart guy who knew the answers to questions we would ask, but more importantly, he forced us to think, to become good thinkers.\n\nWhere was your favorite place on campus to study?\n\nThe Sweet Shop in the Union was a great place for me to study. My office was in the Krannert Building, so I could just grab the stuff I was working on, walk through the tunnel that connected the two buildings and be there in a matter of minutes. I didn’t even need to put on a coat. The Sweet Shop was dark and noisy, almost chaotic. There was just a bare light bulb above each table, but none of that bothered me. When I was there I could focus on my research or my studies, as long as I had a good cup of coffee with me.\n\nWere you a good student when you were at Purdue?\n\nYes, maybe too good. I should have enjoyed life more as a student. There was so much going on: plays, concerts, and sporting events. And I enjoy all of those activities now. But at Purdue, Saturday afternoons were always study days in the library with my friends, so I didn’t really get involved in outside activities. I was too busy trying to be the best student I could be. Now I tell my students to have a hobby and get involved in outside activities, because it makes you a more balanced person.\n\nWhat is the best advice you got while you were at Purdue?\n\nWho gave you the advice?\n\nPaul Farris was a quiet guy. And I was not very outgoing, either. I always thought I would become a great researcher. I didn’t think I had the necessary tools to be able to stand in front of a class and deliver a lecture. But by observing Dr. Farris, I learned to have confidence in my own abilities. His actions told me that I didn’t have to be a great entertainer, but I could still excel in the classroom.\n\nWhat is the best advice you have ever given?\n\nTo whom did you give the advice?\n\nBe yourself, work hard, and set your own expectations. I tell my students they have to do something because that is what they want to do, not because someone told them they would be good at this or that. My career path changed from research to teaching because I didn’t limit myself by what I thought I would be good at. And that has made all the difference.\n\nJanis E. McFarland (Chapel Hill, NC | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2010)\n\nJanis McFarland counts herself fortunate to work in a dynamic industry on the brink of even greater technology-based advances: “It’s never been more exciting, meaningful, and fun to work in agriculture than today,” she says.As head of Regulatory Affairs, McFarlandoversees product registrations and stewardship of Syngenta’s crop protection products in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Since November 2000, the global agribusiness has received registration approval from the EPA and states for more than 150 new fungicide, herbicide, and insecticide products, and for 15 new crop seed treatments.McFarland grew up in Maryland, the fourth of eight children. With degrees from Virginia Tech and Purdue, she began her career with Ciba-Geigy, studying the fate of herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides in plants, animals, and the environment.In November 1993, she headed an EPA-mandated review of the risks and benefits of atrazine, the most widely used herbicide in corn production, and related herbicides. The project resulted in a state-of-the-art scientific database for an older product, and the EPA issued a new registration for atrazine in 2006. The scientific advances resulting from studies that McFarland’s teams conducted has improved the design of safety tests and methodology used in risk assessments for many other pesticides. Ciba-Geigy was part of a merger that created Novartis in 1997. Novartis was part of a merger that created Syngenta in 2000. Throughout what some might view as corporate upheaval, McFarland embraced the benefits of change: “At every merger, we gained great people, different teams expertise, and new technology.” Her model for openly sharing knowledge across disciplines, she adds, was Purdue.McFarland is also an editor and author and is active in the Weed Science Society of America. She loves fishing, kayaking, visiting relatives far and near, and more recently, learning more about the native plants ofNorth Carolina. She and her husband of 30years, Dr. Richard McLaughlin (also a Purduealumnus) have two college-age children, two dogs, and two cats.“My unique experience at Purdue bridged basic and applied sciences. Even those of us considered ‘lab geeks had opportunities to be out in the field. Purdueemulated the way we work today across teams and different agricultural disciplines.”\n\nTed A. McKinney (Indianapolis, Indiana | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2002)\n\nTed McKinney well remembers earning his first blue ribbon. He was 10, his project was photography, and, as a member of the Blue Ribbon Chasers Club, he entered his work in the Tipton County Fair. He received another blue ribbon at the Indiana State Fair, and, he recalls, “It is incredible what that will do for enthusiasm and motivation for the future.”\n\nThe experience not only motivated McKinney, a 10-year 4-H member, throughout his life, it planted the seed for his passion today: investing in youth.\n\nHe does that through his old favorite, 4-H, currently serving on the Indiana 4-H Foundation Board, and through the FFA, another organization he was active in as a youth. Today, the National FFA Center is right next door to Dow AgroSciences, where McKinney works. “I led the committee that brought the center here. I’ve advised them from time to time. And I serve as a good neighbor,” McKinney says. “I got so much out of those two organizations, I feel there is some duty to give back.”\n\nBesides, he believes in both. “4-H teaches involvement, skill development, interacting with others, and various qualities. And FFA is unequivocally the premier youth development organization in the world. You can learn public speaking and parliamentary procedure, and how to run a business, keep records, and make investments. And you can develop your leadership skills.”\n\nThe father of three—two in high school and a third grader—McKinney devotes his spare time to their activities, which include football, cheerleading, basketball, Girl Scouts, and— no surprise—4-H. “I don’t miss very many of their activities,” McKinney says. “That’s important to me.”\n\nThomas McKinney (Kempton, IN | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2016)\n\nThomas H. McKinney is the president and general manager of McKinney & McKinney, a family farm operation based in Kempton, Indiana.\n\nMcKinney returned to the family farm after receiving his B.S. For the past 36 years, he has grown the farm and the community in which he lives in central Indiana.\n\nThe farm now encompasses 5,000 acres and produces seed corn and soybeans as well as commercial corn and beans. But the most impressive part of the McKinney resume details what he as contributed to his community.\n\nMcKinney was instrumental in bringing the C.W. Mount Community Center to Tipton. His help to steward donated funds led to the creation of the facility that houses a community center for children and adults, housing the Tipton County Boys & Girls Club, the Encore Senior Center and Encore Food Pantry, Anytime Fitness Center, banquet rooms, gymnasium and walking track.\n\nHe has provided leadership and service to Indiana FFA and 4-H organizations. His work as president of the Indiana 4-H Foundation has enabled him to reach out to future leaders and remind them of the importance of giving back to their community as those before them have done.\n\nRobert B. McNamara (Distinguished Ag Alumni: 1993)\n\nMr. McNamara is president and founder of McNamara Florists in Indianapolis. He started the McNamara retail florist business in 1954, and, over the years, it has grown to three locations in the Indianapolis area. His business ranks in the top 50 retail Florist Transworld Delivery (FTD) florists in the United States and Canada. Last year they ranked 16th out of the 24,000 FTD shops in terms of orders sent out across the U.S. and Canada. McNamara Florists joined forces with Engledow, Inc. in 1989 to form a corporate conglomerate combining one of Indianapolis’ premiere retail florist businesses with the city’s largest landscape management business.\n\nMr. McNamara has played a significant role in the growth and success of the Indiana State Florists Association. He served two terms as president and is viewed by other florists as a trendsetter and industry leader. A recent innovation of his was the planning and development of ENFLORA, a division of Engledow, Inc., that creates floral arrangements especially designed for businesses. He has also served the National FTD Association as its vice president, president, and board chairman. The FTD wire service is one of the main management tools retail florists use to accept telephone orders and handle their retail businesses.

Miers (Greensburg, IN | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 1999)\n\nDavid Miers earned a bachelor’s degree in Agricultural Economics from Purdue in 1970. He is currently president of Miers Farm Corporation in Decatur County, Indiana. Here are some of this thoughts on education, career, and life: On his Purdue heritage: “I was raised on family land in Decatur County. I was in 4-H and Junior Leaders. I always knew that I was going to Purdue-I never even thought of going anywhere else. And agriculture was always going to be my focus. “I was a triple legacy, twice. While at Purdue I was in Sigma Nu Fraternity, as my Granddad had been at the University of Illinois, and my Dad had been at Purdue. My Grandfather, my Father and myself were also all officers in the United States Army. My Grandfather was in World War I, my father in World War II, and I was in ROTC at Purdue and on active duty during the Vietnam years. On his Purdue experience: “Both of the organizations that I was in-a fraternity and the military--were out of vogue in the late 1960s. You had to have a lot of perseverance to stay in ROTC at that time because of the negativism toward the military, but I loved the military life. I also loved fraternity life, the great football and basketball teams, and going to the Rose Bowl. Those are my best Purdue memories. “At Purdue in the fraternity and ROTC and later in the Army I was developing organizational skills, respect, how to manage people and make decisions, and self confidence.” On the most influential person at Purdue: “By far and away, that would have to be Dean David Fendler. He had been my Dad’s counselor at Purdue, and he was mine. He was adamant that I stay in ROTC because he felt it was important that people gain military experience, and if you were going to be in you should be an officer. He also was a great influence in getting me interested in agriculture. He guided me into general agriculture, and was not pleased when I changed to Ag Economics.” On his business: My granddad and father farmed the same land I’m working now, about 1,800 acres. We grow and harvest seed corn and seed soybeans for Pioneer. Most of the time I’m working with the markets or in the office or attending seminars, or working to make our community and state a better place to live. The most rewarding part of my career is making our own farm operation more productive and efficient. Most of that is achieved by continuous contact with Purdue, the Extension Service and the School of Agriculture, listening to their advice. “Several years ago, for example, I had to make the decision whether to purchase a very expensive seed corn harvester. I called to Purdue and spoke to Howard Doester. W spent a lot of time on the phone discussing pros and cons, and from those conversations with him I was able to make a decision that has been very lucrative and worked out extremely well. “Another example: In 1991 we built a large farm shop and I sought out advice from Bruce McKenzie from Ag Engineering about how to construct the building, things I should and shouldn’t do, and working with him we’ve built a showroom shop, made all the right decisions for efficiency. “Another thing we use all the time is the results from the state about the different varieties of soybeans and corn and how they yield in different areas. We also work closely with the entomology department putting out bug traps and reporting back to them on a weekly basis during the growing season. So we’re taking data out and putting it back in.” On his proudest civic contribution: “I have been working with the Decatur County Community Foundation, distributing funds to community organizations. The grants we gave this year will help build a new YMCA, a county day care center and youth softball leagues. I think youth are our future and it’s important we do a good job educating and training them to take those responsibilities.” On his philosophy of life: First and foremost, don’t burn any bridges. Anyone you’re involved with your entire life, you never know when that person will come back or have some influence on you. And secondly, leave things better than when you started. In an organization, a farm, a business, you should leave it in a better place than when you started.” Highlights/David Miers Education BS, Agricultural Economics, Purdue University, 1970 Career 1970-72 First Lieutenant, United States Army 1972-present President, Miers Farm Corporation, Greensburg, Ind.

Mueller (Westfield, IN | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 1999)\n\nDavid K. Mueller graduated from Purdue in 1975 with a B.S. in Entomology. He is president of two related companies: Insects Unlimited, Inc. and Fumigation Service and Supply, Inc. Here are some of his thoughts on education, career, and life: His favorite Purdue memory: “I remember walking across campus one day and realizing that I was attending one of the best universities in the country. That was an awesome feeling-that I was walking among the best. In the area of pest control, when you say you graduated from Purdue, it is automatically a very prestigious thing.” His favorite professor: “One of my professors, John V. Osmun, was very influential in my career and education. I dedicated my book to him because he was a friend to me and to other students. He’s still at the university as a professor emeritus, and we stay in touch. From time to time we go up to the Sagamore Room and have lunch, and I get notes from him about things he thinks will interest me. It’s nice, in such a large university, to have that kind of one-on-one contact with a full professor.” On choosing entomology: “I started out in Biology and Environmental Science. Part of the curriculum was Introduction to Entomology, and I just fell in love with it. I use my Entomology degree every day. Often I come to work and there’s a box on my desk and someone wants to know what kind of insect it is. The most important thing Purdue gave me was a degree that gave me the knowledge and confidence to go forward.” On applying his knowledge: “My work with stored-product protection is really varied, because it can apply to anything from farm bins to museum exhibits. I like working with museums to protect their treasures. The Field Museum in Chicago, for example, has 16 million items, and most of them are attractive to insects. I take a pest management approach, something I learned at Purdue. I start with the insect first and then work backwards to find an environment that it can’t survive in. It will then leave or die.” On his early life experiences: “I was a 95-pound wrestler in high school, so I had to do something else to carve my niche. I was an Eagle Scout, and was also active in Student Council throughout high school, and those activities developed my leadership abilities. Now I help with my sons’ Scout troop and with their wrestling teams at school.” On his philosophy of life: “My philosophy of life is also the first article of the mission statement of my company: “Be Daring, Be Innovative, Be Fair.” On his favorite honor: “For several generations, methyl bromide has been used as a fumigant, but it is a serious ozone depleter. I have been active in looking for an alternative for methyl bromide. I recently received the Stratospheric Ozone Protection Award from the Environmental Protection Agency for the work I did in this area and I’m proud of that-of daring to stick my nose out and tell a story that wasn’t popular.” On his future: “I try to focus on being the best in my field. I attend a lot of meetings, and try to make sure I’m where there are things going on that will keep me informed. Dr. Osmun had one saying that I remember: ‘We need to educate rather than regulate.’ I agree with that, and so I do a lot of training and educational programs both nationally and internationally.” On his biggest work accomplishment: “My most important accomplishment as a businessman is making payroll 894 times in a row. My companies have 20 regular full-time employees, and also seasonal help during the summer, and we hire a lot of Purdue students and graduates. But if you don’t pay them, they don’t come back.” Booklet highlights/Mueller Education B.S., Entomology, Purdue University, 1975 Career President, Insects Unlimited, Inc. and Fumigation Service and Supply, Inc.

They have three children: Peter, 15, is a Westfield High School varsity heavyweight wrestler, and for several years held the record in Purdue’s Bug Bowl cricket spitting contest. Tom, 12, is also a wrestler, and has “the biggest heart in the world,” according to his father. Frances, 10, is the child most likely to be a successful business person. All enjoy the outdoors and looking at the insects they find there. Display quote/Mueller “My most important accomplishment as a businessman is making payroll 894 times in a row.

But if you don’t pay them, they don’t come back.”\n\nJohn D. Mumford (Ascot, Berkshire, United Kingdom | Distinguished Ag Alumni: 2011)\n\nOne of John Mumford’s part-time jobs as a Purdue undergraduate was collecting information from Indiana farmers on how they dealt with corn insects. During that experience, he began to ponder the problem-solving process. Later, as a Marshall Scholar in England, he focused on how pest control decisions were made on farms, and how extension information could be more effectively directed to growers concerns. Today, Mumford is in demand for his analyses and opinions of pest problems and their management. Issues related to the risks that management programs face in the environment are of particular interest, which has extended his work from pests to other environmental problems, such as fisheries management. He has led international missions to determine environmental risk management research, training, and implementation priorities. As director of the Centre for Environmental Policy, Mumford leads a university department that is intentionally interdisciplinary, with a range of natural scientists, engineers, and social scientists all involved in the understanding of broad environmental problems and their solutions.His teaching, too, addresses the interactions of economics and ecology in many aspects of applied resource management, environmental risk, and pest management. He finds great satisfaction in helping students see what kinds of real problems they can solve with “an understanding of biology, ecology, and some really interesting economics, management, and engineering thrown in.”Mumford is widely published in key research areas that include biosecurity, quarantine, and eradication policy for invasive pest and quarantine species; design of decision tools for environmental risk management; and integrated management of major insect pests. He believes that as the dominant macroscopic form of life on earth, insects are well worth knowing about — but he is most interested in “how humans i"
