        "text": "PROFESSIONAL basketball player Dominique Wilkins may be one of the best slam dunkers in NBA history, but his relationships off the court haven't always scored.\n\nIt's still a mystery whether the nine-time NBA All-Star will include his three ex-wives, or his rumored new girlfriend, in his upcoming sports documentary.\n\nWho is NBA star Dominique Wilkins?\n\nBorn in Paris, France, Jacques Dominique Wilkins is an American former professional basketball player.\n\nHis family moved to Dallas and Baltimore before ultimately settling in Washington, North Carolina.\n\nHis younger brother, Gerald Wilkins, also played in the NBA, primarily for the New York Knicks.\n\nWilkins played college basketball at the University of Georgia, where he was named SEC Men's Basketball Player of the Year in 1981.\n\nHowever, he left college after his junior year, determined to go pro.\n\nIn 1982, he was the first round, third overall pick in the NBA draft, selected by the Utah Jazz.\n\nHowever, several months later, Wilkins was traded to the Atlanta Hawks, where he would spend 12 years as a small forward.\n\nHe also played for the Los Angeles Clippers, Boston Celtics, San Antonio Spurs, and Orlando Magic.\n\nWilkins also found success abroad, competing for basketball clubs in Greece (Panathinaikos) and Italy (Fortitudo Bologna).\n\nNicknamed \"the Human Highlight Reel,\" Wilkins amassed numerous awards and accolades during his 17-year professional career, including:\n\nNBA 75th Anniversary Team (2021)\n\nNine-time NBA All-Star (1986 - 1994)\n\nSeven-time All-NBA Team member (1986 - 1994)\n\nTwo-time NBA Slam Dunk Contest champion (1985, 1990)\n\nEuroLeague champion (1996)\n\nNBA scoring champion (1986)\n\nWilkins has served as the vice president of basketball operations for the Atlanta Hawks since 2004.\n\nOn October 30, it was announced that the NBA legend committed to a documentary project about his life and career.\n\nSpeaking with The Hollywood Reporter, Wilkins said: “I want the documentary to be about the man, as well as the basketball player.\"\n\nTime will tell whether the documentary, slated to be released sometime ahead of the 2024 NBA season, will focus on Wilkins' past or current relationships.\n\nHowever, movie-goers can expect an inspirational tale, as Wilkins said “I don’t want it to just be a tell-all story, but I want it to be a motivational story as well.\"\n\nWho are Dominique Wilkins’s ex-wives?\n\nWilkins has been married – and divorced – three times.\n\nHe first tied the knot with then-girlfriend Nicole Berry in 1992.\n\nThe couple had four children, daughters Alysandra, Aiysha, Chloe, and Danielle.\n\nThey divorced in 2003 after 11 years of marriage.\n\nWilkins then married Robin Campbell Wilkins in 2006.\n\nThe couple had one son, Jacob, and one daughter, Jolie, before getting divorced.\n\nHe is also the stepfather of professional basketball player and coach Isaiah Wilkins, Robin's son from a previous relationship.\n\nNot much is known about when Wilkins married his third wife, Sunny, but the couple ultimately divorced in 2018.\n\nWho is Dominique Wilkins dating now?\n\nThe fourth time may be the charm for Wilkins, who is currently in a relationship with Jedidia Hazlewood.\n\nWhile it's unknown when the duo linked up, they posted their first picture together on Instagram in August 2022, and have kept posting pictures regularly on each other's accounts.\n\nHazlewood, a Queens, New York, native and current Atlanta, Georgia, resident, is a former law enforcement personnel.\n\nShe previously worked at the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) and as a Deputy at the Dale County Sheriff's Office.\n\nHazlewood is currently a sergeant at the City of Lithonia Police Department.\n\nHazlewood also has four daughters from a past relationship."
