The Celtics defeated the Magic 120-105.\n\n(AP Photo/Charles Krupa)\n\nOver the past couple of weeks, the Boston media has spent a lot of time dissecting Rajon Rondo's character. I don't want to do any more of that. I just want to point you toward Gerald Wallace's comments about his captain.\n\nSpeaking to the Boston Herald's Steve Bulpett, Wallace said he admires that Rondo is \"real\" and believes Rondo is \"that cocky guy that you want on your side, that you want to go to war with.\"\n\n“He’s the type of teammate that everybody would want — that everybody should want,” Wallace told the Herald. “He cares about losing. It hurts him to lose.\n\n“As competitive as he is and the way he’s going, he’s at that level where he’s totally into it.”\n\nWith all of the backlash Rondo has experienced for missing the Sacramento trip for a birthday party (he wasn't going to play in the game anyway), it might bear noting that Kevin Garnett considers the All-Star point guard like a brother. And KG's the type of guy who would rather jump into a swimming pool of nails than have a bad influence in his locker room."
