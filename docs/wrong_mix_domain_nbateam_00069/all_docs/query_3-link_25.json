        "text": "American basketball coach (born 1964)\n\nEric Musselman (born November 19, 1964) is an American college basketball coach who is currently the head coach at the University of Southern California. He is the former head coach at the University of Arkansas, University of Nevada, Reno, the Sacramento Kings and the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Between head coaching stints at Golden State and Sacramento, Musselman served as an assistant for the Memphis Grizzlies under Mike Fratello. He moved to the college coaching ranks in 2012 as an assistant at Arizona State. From 2014–19, he was the head coach for the Nevada Wolf Pack. The son of former NBA head coach Bill Musselman, Eric Musselman was a head coach in the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) before becoming an assistant coach with the Minnesota Timberwolves, Orlando Magic (under Chuck Daly and Doc Rivers), and Atlanta Hawks (under Lon Kruger).\n\nMusselman grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and San Diego, California, before moving to suburban Cleveland, Ohio, where he attended Brecksville-Broadview Heights High School in Brecksville, a suburb about 15 miles south of Cleveland. There, he played on the same high school basketball team as former NBA player Scott Roth and former NFL Pro Bowl punter/quarterback Tom Tupa.\n\nMusselman graduated from the University of San Diego, where he played basketball for Jim Brovelli and Hank Egan, both of whom would later work as NBA assistants. While Musselman was at USD (1983–87), the Toreros compiled a 77–36 record. He was a member of the 1986–87 team that compiled a 24–6 record, the best in school history. The Toreros lost to Auburn University in the first round of the NCAA tournament, 62–61. Among Musselman's teammates at USD were Scott Thompson, a 7-foot center who was drafted in the fourth round by the Washington Bullets in the 1987 NBA draft, and Mike Whitmarsh, who won a silver medal in beach volleyball at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.\n\nMusselman was a fifth-round CBA draft choice of the Albany Patroons in 1987.\n\nIn the CBA, Musselman posted a 270–122 record (.688), marking the second highest winning percentage in league history behind George Karl, who coached for five seasons in the CBA.\n\nMusselman began his CBA career in 1988 as the general manager of the Rapid City Thrillers, a franchise his father Bill had coached to three consecutive CBA titles during the 1980s. His first week on the job, he hired Flip Saunders as the team's head coach. Saunders, who was recruited by Bill Musselman when Bill was the head coach at the University of Minnesota during the early 1970s, would go on to be one of the winningest coaches in CBA history before moving to the NBA as coach of the Minnesota Timberwolves.[1]\n\nIn the 1989–90 season, at age 24, Musselman became the Thrillers head coach.[1] The following season, Musselman joined his father Bill's staff on the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves as assistant coach making him the youngest front-bench assistant coach in NBA history.[2] Prior to joining the Thrillers, Musselman worked for the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers as an assistant to General Manager Elgin Baylor and Barry Hecker, the team's director of scouting.\n\nFrom 1990–1997, Musselman had 24 players called up to the NBA, the highest number in the league during that span. He holds the distinction of being the only person in CBA history to coach in five league All-Star Games (1990, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1997) and was the first coach in professional basketball history to win 100 games by the age of 28. When he was 23, Musselman became the youngest coach in CBA history.\n\nMusselman also served as head coach of the Florida Sharks of the United States Basketball League (USBL). In the summers of 1995 and 1996, he coached the Sharks to a combined 53–3 record (.946, including playoffs) and back-to-back USBL Championships. Musselman was selected as USBL Coach of the Year in 1996.[3] He holds the highest winning percentage in league history.\n\nMusselman was an assistant coach for the Orlando Magic from 1998 to 2000 under Chuck Daly and Doc Rivers who would go on to be named NBA Coach of the Year in the 1999–00 season, then also for the Atlanta Hawks from 2000 to 2002 under Lon Kruger.[2]\n\nIn 2002, Musselman was named the head coach of the Golden State Warriors, a position he held for two years. He finished as runner-up to San Antonio's Gregg Popovich in NBA Coach of the Year Award voting in 2002–2003 with 231 points, including 26 first-place votes.[4] That season, under Musselman's guidance, the Warriors, for the first time in nearly a decade, reached the .500 mark late in the season, holding a record of 30–30 on March 4, 2003. In Musselman's rookie season, his club finished 38–44, the most wins in more than 10 years.\n\nDespite numerous injuries and the loss of the team's top two players in Gilbert Arenas (signed with Washington) and Antawn Jamison (traded to Dallas), the team still finished 37–45 under his direction during the 2003–2004 season. In two seasons as head coach in Golden State, Musselman compiled a 75–89 record. Nevertheless, he was let go after the 2004 season ended when Chris Mullin took over as the team's general manager.\n\nMusselman's .457 winning percentage with Golden State ranks 10th all-time among Warriors coaches, behind Steve Kerr (.709 through 2019–2020), Neil Johnson (.617), Frank McGuire (.613), George Senesky (.551), Bill Sharman (.534), Al Attles (.518), Don Nelson (.487), Mark Jackson (.473) and George Lee (.470).\n\nAfter his two seasons as head coach of the Golden State Warriors, Musselman was an assistant coach for the Memphis Grizzlies under Mike Fratello from 2004 to 2006.[2]\n\nOn June 2, 2006, Musselman was named head coach of the Sacramento Kings, replacing Rick Adelman. Four months into the job, on October 21, 2006, Musselman was cited for DUI in Sacramento.[5] At the time, Musselman said, \"Alcohol has never been a big part of my life. I don't allow it in my house. My sons have never seen me take a sip of anything.\" According to Ailine Voisin, a sports columnist for The Sacramento Bee, \"[Musselman] drinks so infrequently, in fact, that he can count the number of beers he consumes per month.\"[6]\n\nIn the first month of the season (November 2006) with Musselman at the helm, the Kings went 8–5. But the team slumped in December and January, posting a 10–21 record before going 7–6 in February 2007. The Kings finished 33–49 on the season.\n\nMusselman was fired by Sacramento President of Basketball Operations Geoff Petrie on April 20, 2007.[7]\n\nOn August 11, 2010, Musselman was named head coach of the NBA Development League's Reno Bighorns. Under his watch, several players, including Marcus Landry, Jeremy Lin, Courtney Fortson, Donald Sloan and Hassan Whiteside were called up to the NBA and the Bighorns finished 34–16 and first in the D-League Western Conference.[8][9]\n\nMusselman was named head coach of the Los Angeles D-Fenders on August 18, 2011. Sports Illustrated called Musselman one of the \"best teachers\" in the D-League.[10] During the 2011–12 season, he guided the team to a 38–12 record, the best mark in league history. The D-Fenders, who finished with the best defensive FG percentage in the league, advanced to the D-League finals before losing to the Austin Toros, in a three-game series. In April 2012, Musselman was named the 2011–12 D-League Coach of the Year.[11] A month later, in May 2012, the D-Fenders were named the 2011–12 NBA D-League Development Champion, which recognizes \"the team that best embodies the NBA D-League's goals of developing NBA basketball talent via call-ups and assignments.\"[12]\n\nUnder Herb Sendek, Musselman was assistant coach at Arizona State in the 2012–13 season, then was promoted to associate head coach in 2013.[9] In two seasons with the Sun Devils, Musselman helped ASU to the NIT Tournament in 2013 and the NCAA tournament in 2014. The team went 21–12 in both seasons.\n\nIn June 2014, Musselman became associate head coach at LSU under Johnny Jones.[9] In Musselman's one season with the Tigers, LSU went 22–10 and reached the NCAA tournament, losing to North Carolina State, 66–65, in the first round.[13]\n\nOn March 25, 2015, the University of Nevada, Reno hired Musselman as head coach for the Nevada Wolf Pack team.[14]\n\nIn early March 2016, Bleacher Report named Musselman the Mountain West Coach of the Year after guiding the Wolf Pack to an 18–12 record, a 9-win improvement over the previous season.[15] The team's winning percentage jumped from 31 to 60, which ranked as the 11th best improvement nationally.[16]\n\nFollowing the 2015–16 season, Nevada was invited to play in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI), winning its first three games to improve its season record to 21–12 and advance to the CBI championship series vs Morehead State.[17] According to Chris Murray, a reporter who covered the team for the Reno Gazette-Journal, \"No coach in Nevada basketball history has done a better job of getting everything out of the talent on the roster. It might be the best coaching job in Wolf Pack hoops history.\"[18]\n\nNevada's 2016 recruiting class was ranked as the 35th best in the nation by 247Sports.[19]\n\nMusselman's 2016–17 Wolf Pack team went 14–4 in conference play to win the Mountain West regular season title. The team also won the 2017 MWC postseason tournament championship to earn a bid in the NCAA men's basketball tournament. Nevada, Reno finished 28–7 overall for the season, tied for the second-most wins in school history.\n\nIn December 2017, Musselman's Nevada team was ranked in the top 25, the first time since 2007 that the Wolf Pack had ranked among the top 25 teams nationally.[20] Musselman was named 2017–18 Mountain West Coach of the Year after guiding the Wolf Pack to a 15–3 conference record and the MWC regular season title. He was also named the Coach of the Year for District 17 by the National Association of Basketball Coaches.[21] The team set a school record for most wins in a season.[22]\n\nIn March 2018, Nevada, Reno was announced as an at-large selection for the NCAA men's basketball tournament as a seventh seed.[23] In their first round game, the Wolf Pack came back from 14 points down to defeat Texas, 87–83. In Round 2, Nevada rallied from a 22-point deficit to upset second-seeded Cincinnati, 75–73, propelling the Wolf Pack to its second Sweet 16 appearance in school history.[24]\n\nDuring the 2017–18 season, Nevada, Reno finished 12–3 in true road games. Those 12 victories were a single-season school record and tied for most in the country.\n\nIn May 2018 Musselman and staff signed ESPN's 31st ranked recruit in the 2018 class Jordan Brown.[25] Brown became the highest-ranked recruit to commit to Nevada since Reno native Luke Babbitt pledged to play for his local school in 2008.\n\nOn September 5, 2018, the Nevada, Reno athletics department announced that season tickets for the upcoming men's basketball season were officially sold out.[26]\n\nTo start the 2018–19 season, Nevada, Reno was ranked #7 in the preseason Associated Press poll and #9 in the USA Today Coaches Poll. It is the highest ranking in school history for the Wolf Pack. The previous top ranking was #9 on February 26, 2007. Additionally, the #7 ranking was the highest preseason ranking in Mountain West Conference history. The Nevada, Reno Wolf Pack finished the year ranked in the Associated Press Top 25 all 20 weeks of the college basketball season, with the highest ranking in school history coming in week 4 with a #5 AP ranking.\n\nOn November 6, Nevada, Reno opened the season with an 86–70 victory over BYU. Caroline scored a game-high 25 points, with 21 coming in the second half. Nevada, Reno opened the season with the only starting lineup in college basketball consisting of all fifth-year seniors.\n\nOn November 27, the wolf pack avenge their Sweet 16 loss in March to Loyola-Chicago by defeating Loyola, 79–65, in Chicago. The Pack, now ranked No. 5 in the country, was led by Caleb Martin (21 points) and Cody Martin (20 points).\n\nA week later, Nevada, Reno rallied in the 2nd half to defeat #20 Arizona State 72–66 in the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. In front of the 12th-largest crowd in Lawlor Events Center History, the Wolf Pack honored its Seniors beating San Diego State 81–53, and earning its third straight Mountain West Conference regular season title.\n\nThe Pack became the third team in Mountain West Conference history to win three straight regular season conference titles.[27]\n\nNevada, Reno's 2018–19 season shattered the all-time attendance record at Lawlor Events Center. The season total of 163,169 broke the former record set in 2005–06 of 150,674, and doing it in 3 less games. Additionally, the average home game attendance of 10,878, broke the record set previous year (2017–18), of 9,048.[28]\n\nMusselman joined Mark Few (Gonzaga), Dave Rose (BYU), Steve Fisher (SDSU), Steve Alford (New Mexico), and Shaka Smart (VCU), as recent mid-major coaches with four-year spans of 25+ wins per season, 3+ tournament appearances, 2+ tournament wins, and at least one week in AP Top 10.\n\nAfter finishing the year with an overall record of 29–5, Musselman received one vote for AP Coach of the Year (tied 11th).\n\nMusselman was named Arkansas head coach on April 7, 2019.[29]\n\nHis team got off to an 8–0 start heading into December, the school's best start to a season since the 1997–98 season. The Razorbacks went 11–1 in non-conference play going in to their conference schedule. They headed into SEC play with a 71–64 win on the road at Indiana University. Arkansas defeated TCU 78–67 at home in the mid season SEC vs Big 12 Challenge. Arkansas at that point had gone 3–3 in SEC play with wins over Vandy and Texas A&M at home, and Ole Miss on the road. Losses were to LSU and MSU on the road, and a loss at home to Kentucky. Arkansas was 16–5 (4–4) when they lost their 2nd leading scorer for a five game stretch, where they posted a 0–5 record. At full strength over the final six games, the Razorbacks finished the season 4–2. Musselman, in his first year at Arkansas recruited the fifth and sixth-ranked recruiting class in the nation according to ESPN.com and 247sports.com respectively.\n\nThe season was cut short after a Wednesday victory at the 2020 SEC tournament due to COVID-19 pandemic concerns. The Razorbacks ended their season with a 20–12 record overall marking Musselman's fifth straight season with 20 or more wins.\n\nFollowing the 2019–20 season, Musselman and staff reeled in the No. 3 ranked transfer recruiting class[30] after three top 25 ranked graduate transfers signed with the Razorbacks.\n\nLate in the 2020–21 season, his Razorbacks cracked the Top 25 for the first time since January 2018 and then hosted No. 6 Alabama as the No. 20 ranked team, the first matchup of ranked teams inside Bud Walton Arena since February 1998. On March 8, 2021, the Razorbacks entered the top 10 of the AP poll for the first time since February 1995, checking in at No. 8 heading into the postseason. Musselman was named one of 10 semifinalists for the 2021 Werner Ladder Naismith Men's Coach of the Year.[31] Musselman entered the 2021 NCAA tournament as a #3 Seed, the highest seed for Arkansas since the 1994–95 national runner-up. On March 21, 2021, Musselman led Arkansas to its first Sweet 16 since 1996 in a 2-point win over 6-seed Texas Tech. Musselman ended the Cinderella run of 15-seed Oral Roberts on March 27, 2021, to advance Arkansas to its first Elite 8 since 1995. The Razorbacks finished the season ranked #10 in the final AP Men's Basketball Poll and #6 in the USA Today Coaches Poll.\n\nOn February 8, 2022, his team knocked off No. 1 Auburn in front of a then Bud Walton Arena record 20,327 in attendance. As Arkansas had not beaten a number 1 team at BWA, the students rushed the court, resulting in Arkansas paying a $250,000 fine.[32] Arkansas entered the 2022 NCAA tournament as #4 seed. Arkansas beat New Mexico State to be the only SEC program to advance to the Sweet 16 of the 2022 NCAA tournament. Musselman followed that by knocking off #1 overall ranked Gonzaga to advance to the Elite 8, making the first time an Arkansas coach took the Razorbacks to back-to-back Elite 8 appearances since Nolan Richardson in 1994 and 1995. The Razorbacks would fall in the Elite 8 to Duke in head coach Mike Krzyzewski's 43rd and final season. Arkansas finished ranked #17 in the final AP Poll and #8 in the final USA Today Coaches Poll. His coaching career at Arkansas was further propelled into success with his 2022 recruiting class, which featured several five-star recruits like Anthony Black (basketball), Nick Smith Jr., and Jordan Walsh.\n\nOn March 18, 2023, Musselman's 8th-seeded Razorbacks knocked off No. 1 overall seed and defending national champion Kansas in the Round of 32 to advance to the Sweet 16 for a third consecutive season. They would lose to eventual national champion UConn in the regional semifinals in Las Vegas.\n\nIn his fifth season, Arkansas struggled throughout SEC play after beating Duke in the non-conference, breaking the Bud Walton Arena attendance record in that game for the second time in his tenure.[33] The team finished with a losing record overall, the first time Arkansas had done that since 2009–10.\n\nOn April 4, 2024, Musselman was hired as the head coach at the University of Southern California.\n\nLegend Regular season G Games coached W Games won L Games lost W–L % Win–loss % Playoffs PG Playoff games PW Playoff wins PL Playoff losses PW–L % Playoff win–loss %\n\nTeam Year G W L W–L% Finish PG PW PL PW–L% Result Golden State 2002–03 82 38 44 .463 6th in Pacific — — — — Missed playoffs Golden State 2003–04 82 37 45 .451 5th in Pacific — — — — Missed playoffs Sacramento 2006–07 82 33 49 .402 5th in Pacific — — — — Missed playoffs Career 246 108 138 .439 — — — —\n\nStatistics overview Season Team Overall Conference Standing Postseason Nevada Wolf Pack (Mountain West Conference) (2015–2019) 2015–16 Nevada 24–14 10–8 T–4th CBI champions 2016–17 Nevada 28–7 14–4 1st NCAA Division I Round of 64 2017–18 Nevada 29–8 15–3 1st NCAA Division I Sweet 16 2018–19 Nevada 29–5 15–3 1st NCAA Division I Round of 64 Nevada: 110–34 (.764) 54–18 (.750) Arkansas Razorbacks (Southeastern Conference) (2019–2024) 2019–20 Arkansas 20–12 7–11 T–10th postseason cancelled 2020–21 Arkansas 25–7 13–4 2nd NCAA Division I Elite Eight 2021–22 Arkansas 28–9 13–5 4th NCAA Division I Elite Eight 2022–23 Arkansas 22–14 8–10 T–9th NCAA Division I Sweet 16 2023–24 Arkansas 16–17 6–12 T–11th Arkansas: 111–59 (.653) 47–42 (.528) USC Trojans (Big Ten Conference) (2024–present) 2024–25 USC 0–0 0–0 USC: 0–0 (–) 0–0 (–) Total: 221–93 (.704)\n\nNational champion Postseason invitational champion\n\nConference regular season champion Conference regular season and conference tournament champion\n\nDivision regular season champion Division regular season and conference tournament champion\n\nConference tournament champion\n\nYear Team Season Record Playoff record Key Players 1989–90 Rapid City Thrillers (CBA) 42–14 (.750) 8–8 Keith Smart, Jarvis Basnight, Jim Thomas, Pat Durham, Micheal Williams, Conner Henry, Michael Higgins 1991–92 Rapid City Thrillers (CBA) 37–19 (.660) 9–7 Fennis Dembo, Joe Ward, Stephen Thompson, Fred Cofield, Carlton McKinney, Craig Neal, Nikita Wilson, Pat Cummings, Leon Wood 1992–93 Rapid City Thrillers (CBA) 44–12 (.785) 5–3 Shelton Jones, Cliff Robinson, Stanley Brundy, Craig Neal, Larry Robinson 1993–94 Rapid City Thrillers (CBA) 37–19 (.660) 5–5 Byron Dinkins, Gerald Paddio, John Morton, Wes Matthews, Tom Garrick, George Ackles 1994–95 Rapid City Thrillers (CBA) 31–25 (.553) 0–2 Wayne Tinkle, Corey Crowder, Greg Grant, Billy Thompson, Duane Washington, Ben Coleman, Lester Conner 1995 Florida/Bradenton Sharks (USBL) 24–2 (.923) 1–0 Nate Johnston, Charles E.

In other cases, a team may be better suited for an \"open offense.\" According to Musselman, the idea is to allow players to \"play to their strengths.\"[34]\n\nAs head coach of the Golden State Warriors, Musselman would often use \"three-guard rotations to create mismatches and fast-break opportunities for his club.\"[35] As head coach of the Venezuela National Team, Musselman said his team's identity was that of a \"fast-paced, up-tempo team.\"[36]\n\nAccording to former NBA coach Jeff Van Gundy, Musselman is \"as competitive of a guy as I've ever coached against. He's a brilliant offensive mind.\"[37]\n\nAccording to University of Kentucky head coach John Calipari, \"Eric is one of the best in our sport. Extremely driven and knowledgeable. I've watched and coached against him in the NBA and FIBA games. He has an uncanny feel for the game, and ability to read where the game is at. More importantly, is his ability to motivate and teach his players what it takes to improve and win. He is as good as it gets.\"[38]\n\nIn an August 2011 interview on NBA.com, Musselman said that, as a coach, \"you have to continually figure out a way to get your players better.\"[39] According to Gerald Green, who played for Musselman with the D-League's Los Angeles D-Fenders in 2012, Musselman \"did a hell of a job really motivating me, really pushing me every day in practice when I was with L.A. I have to give him credit [for improving my game].\"[40] Green said that Musselman \"rode me about staying focused. Don’t take even a second off of any play. Don’t take any plays off. Don’t take practice for granted.\"[41]\n\nLike Green, Jeremy Lin has also credited Musselman with aiding his development. In February 2012, Lin said that when he played for Musselman in the D-League, \"he gave me the opportunity to play through mistakes.\"[42]\n\nGregory Echenique, who played for Musselman on the Venezuela National Team in 2011, said Musselman \"had the most energy of any coach I've ever been around. He had a problem with his Achilles, and he would throw his crutches down and literally crawl to get after you. From the first day we met him to when we left him, his intensity never changed. It didn't matter who you were — he was in your face if he needed to be. At the same time, he was so positive. He always believed we could win. He was the guy that put the fire into us.\"[43]\n\nKevin Martin, who played for Musselman with the Sacramento Kings in 2006–07, told NBA.com that Musselman helped him learn how to draw more fouls. According to Martin, Musselman \"saw how teams were playing me and how they got up into me and told me to start absorbing that contact. He said I could score a lot more points in this league if I got to the free throw line. He put an emphasis on me night in night out with that part of the game. He was always pounding it into me and it paid off.\"[44]\n\nIn a May 9, 2013, article by CBSSports.com college basketball writer Gary Parrish, Arizona State guard Jahii Carson credited Musselman with helping him develop as a player. \"Coach Muss is a great guy with a lot of knowledge because he's coached a lot of great players\", said Carson. \"He's given me a lot of great advice … about what NBA people are looking for, about how NBA guys don't take days off, how they're always in the gym doing conditioning or something, always trying to better their games. A guy like me? I didn't know anything like that having never been around the NBA game. So, he's somebody who has helped me.\"[45]\n\nDuring the 2013–14 season, Musselman worked with Arizona State center Jordan Bachynski, helping the 7-foot-2 senior with his footwork.[46] After the season, Bachynski earned Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year honors.[47]\n\nIn October 2007, ESPN reported that Musselman had a desire to coach at the collegiate level. According to Andy Katz, senior college basketball writer for ESPN.com, \"Musselman wants to coach in college and is starting the process of getting his name out among search committees so that he's a viable candidate in March.\"[48] In late December 2007, FOX Sports reported that Musselman was a likely candidate to replace 71-year-old Eddie Sutton at the University of San Francisco after this season.[49] In January 2008, his name surfaced in press reports surrounding the head coaching position at Oregon State.[50] In March 2008, Musselman's name surfaced in published reports about the California and Loyola Marymount head coaching positions.[51]\n\nOn August 30, 2012, Andy Katz reported on ESPN.com's College Basketball Nation Blog that Arizona State University was in talks to hire Musselman as an assistant coach on Herb Sendek's staff.[52] On September 2, 2012, Katz confirmed Musselman's hiring, describing it as a \"bold move\" and a \"coup\" for Sendek.[53]\n\nFormer NBA coach Jeff Van Gundy predicted that Musselman will be an excellent recruiter \"because of his competitive nature and what he has to sell. This is a guy who can tell kids exactly what it takes to play in the NBA.\"[54]\n\nFifteen games into Arizona State's 2012–13 season, ESPN's Andy Katz wrote that \"It's hard to ignore the difference [guard Jahii] Carson and assistant coach Eric Musselman are making at Arizona State.\" According to Katz, \"The Sun Devils were painful to watch last season. Now, ASU has multiple options and while it still grinds out wins (see OT game in the 50s to beat Utah), the Sun Devils are 2–0 in the Pac-12 and 13–2 heading to the Oregon schools.\"[55] On January 9, 2013, ESPN's Jason King wrote that \"adding former NBA head coach Eric Musselman...to his staff has also been a huge plus for Sendek and his players.\" Quoted in King's story, Arizona State center Jordan Bachynski said, \"When [Musselman and Greer] speak, guys listen, just because they have that credibility from being in the league. The way they approach the game … it's no BS. They say, 'This is how it's done. If you don't like it, you're not going to play.'\"[56]\n\nIn a radio interview after the 2012–13 season, Arizona State athletic director Steve Patterson said, \"I think Eric's going to have opportunities to look at head coaching jobs. He's a very qualified coach. He did a great job, I think, teaching and working here.\"[57]\n\nIn a March 26, 2013, post on the ESPN Los Angeles UCLA blog, Peter Yoon described Musselman as one of the \"best under-the-radar candidates out there.\"[58]\n\nIn May 2013, he was promoted to associate head coach.[59] Musselman resigned from Sendek's staff in April 2014.[60]\n\nFollowing the 2013–14 season, Musselman was a candidate for the head coaching position at the University of California, Berkeley,[61] the University of South Florida[62] and Oregon State University.[63]\n\nIn July 2009, Musselman reportedly turned down an offer to coach Spartak St. Petersburg in Russia.[64] On May 19, 2010, Musselman was named head coach of the Dominican Republic national basketball team.[65]\n\nAt the 2010 Men's Centro Basketball Championship in July 2010, FIBA Americas' top regional tournament, Musselman guided the Dominican Republic team to the gold medal game, losing to Puerto Rico, 89–80, the team's only loss of the tournament (5–1).
