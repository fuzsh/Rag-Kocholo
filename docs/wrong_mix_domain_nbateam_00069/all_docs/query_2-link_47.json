        "text": "Known for his soccer career and good looks, Beckham has had even more success after retirement.

She appears regularly on \"Outside the Lines\" and \"Around the Horn.\"\n\nThe 38th President of the United States, Ford was a great football player at the University of Michigan before he went into politics. The school went undefeated twice while Ford served as a center, linebacker and long snapper in 1932 and 1933.\n\nForeman had a long boxing career, but he's made far more money with his promotion of the George Foreman Grill. He sold the naming rights to the grill in 1999 for $138 million.\n\nFoudy made her mark with the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team as a midfielder, winning two World Cups and an Olympic gold medal. She's now an analyst and color commentator on ESPN soccer broadcasts.\n\nA former Heisman Trophy winner at Ohio State and four-time Pro Bowler in the NFL, George has become a Broadway actor since retiring.

Kemp died in 2009 at age 73.\n\nLeslie is one of the greatest female basketball players ever, winning three WNBA MVP Awards and four Olympic gold medals.

It's hard to watch television without seeing O'Neal, who appears in commercials for The General insurance, Gold Bond and Icy Hot, among other products. He's also a prominent investor and part owner of the Sacramento Kings. Of course, these careers have been far more successful than his attempts at music and movies (see \"Kazaam\").\n\nAfter Page's Hall of Fame NFL career with the Vikings, the former defensive tackle worked as a lawyer and eventually joined the Minnesota Supreme Court in 1992, where he served until 2015.\n\nPalmer was one of the all-time great golfers but also gained fame with golf course design, his role in helping to create The Golf Channel and the Arnold Palmer iced tea with lemonade beverage.
