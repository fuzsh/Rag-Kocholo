Vote below and help decide the greatest Orlando Magic shooting guard of all time!\n\nMost divisive: DeShawn Stevenson\n\nOver 100 Ranker voters have come together to rank this list of The 45+ Best NBA Orlando Magic Shooting Guards\n\nBirthplace : USA, Florida, Bartow\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Atlanta Hawks\n\nPosition : Shooting guard, Small forward\n\nOrlando Magic: 2000–2004\n\nA top-tier talent that graced the Orlando Magic roster during the early 2000s, Tracy McGrady joined the team as a free agent in 2000, forming a powerful partnership with Grant Hill. McGrady's offensive prowess combined with his defensive tenacity made him a force to be reckoned with throughout his tenure with Orlando. An instinctual scorer, he could create and execute plays in clutch moments, earning two NBA scoring titles in consecutive seasons (2002-2003, 2003-2004). Furthermore, T-Mac was a seven-time NBA All-Star, showcasing his immense impact on not just the Magic, but the entire league.\n\n2\n\nNick Anderson\n\nAge: 56\n\nBirthplace : Chicago, Illinois\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Shooting guard, Small forward\n\nOrlando Magic: 1989–1999\n\nJoining the Orlando Magic as the team's first-ever draft pick in 1989, Nick Anderson quickly established himself as one of the franchise's foundational pieces. Known for his fearlessness and hard-nosed playing style, Anderson was an integral part of the dominant Magic teams of the mid-1990s, contributing significantly to their only NBA Finals appearance in 1995. While never racking up individual awards, his relentless dedication to winning made him a fan favorite, and he remains one of the most beloved figures in Orlando Magic history.\n\nBirthplace : Daytona Beach, Florida\n\nNationality : American\n\nTeam : Toronto Raptors, New Jersey Nets, Orlando Magic, Phoenix Suns, Dallas Mavericks\n\nPosition : Small forward\n\nOrlando Magic: 2009–2011\n\nAfter years of making highlight reels with his high-flying dunks, Vince Carter was traded to the Orlando Magic in 2009, where he added much-needed veteran experience and leadership to a young squad. Carter's shooting ability complemented the playmaking of fellow All-Star Dwight Howard, helping propel the Magic to the Eastern Conference Finals during his very first season with the team. Though his stint with Orlando was brief, \"Half-Man, Half-Amazing\" left an indelible mark on the franchise and its fans.\n\nBirthplace : Cookeville, Tennessee\n\nNationality : American\n\nTeam : Orlando Magic, Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Clippers, Philadelphia 76ers, New Orleans Pelicans\n\nPosition : Shooting guard\n\nOrlando Magic: 2006–2013\n\nSelected 11th overall in the 2006 NBA Draft, J.J. Redick quickly carved out a niche for himself as one of the league's deadliest sharpshooters. During his time with the Orlando Magic, Redick's long-range precision helped spread the floor and create opportunities for his teammates. A fan favorite, he played an essential role in Orlando's deep playoff run in 2009. Redick's sharpshooting skills earned him the respect of the league and endeared him to Magic fans.\n\nBirthplace : Atlanta, Georgia\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nPosition : Shooting guard\n\nOrlando Magic: 1996–1999\n\nJoining the Orlando Magic as a free agent in 1996, Gerald Wilkins quickly became a key contributor off the bench. His slashing ability and mid-range shooting acumen provided the Magic with a valuable offensive weapon. Though only spending a short time with the organization, Wilkins' veteran presence and scoring punch made a significant impact on the team.\n\nBirthplace : Saginaw, Michigan\n\nNationality : United States of America\n\nTeam : Orlando Magic\n\nPosition : Shooting guard, Small forward\n\nOrlando Magic: 2010–2012\n\nAcquired via trade in December 2010, Jason Richardson brought veteran savvy and scoring acumen to a young Orlando Magic squad. Known for his exceptional shooting range and leaping ability, he provided an instant offensive spark to the team. Although he only spent two seasons with the Magic, Richardson's experience and poise in clutch situations made a lasting impression on both the franchise and its fans."
