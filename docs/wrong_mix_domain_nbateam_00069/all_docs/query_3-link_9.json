        "text": "With the recent release of Caron Butler's memoir Tuff Juice: My Journey from the Streets to the NBA, the incident that derailed the promise of the Wizards has been brought to the forefront once again. Five years after the fact, the Gilbert Arenas gun debacle found prominence in the news again.\n\nWith so much uncertainty still surrounding such a monumental event, why wouldn't it be? It's not common for an athlete to bring a gun into his locker room, especially when it may or may not have been with the intentions of using it against a teammate.\n\nHow good Arenas was as a basketball player is routinely forgotten in this mess, and it is sad to think about the difference between what he has become in the present when compared to what he had the potential to be. His vices now make him synonymous with failure. While a majority of the blame for this lies on Arenas' shoulders, it is a melancholy end in the long story of a Wizards legend.\n\nI can't help but succumb to the feelings of nostalgia that accompany Arenas' name. When I walk into a Japanese steakhouse and see the chefs working at their hibachi grills, I think back to when I whispered Gilbert's trademarked \"Hibachi!\" under my breath as I beat the buzzer shooting my dirty clothes into the laundry basket.\n\nAs a kid, I loved everything about him. I loved his cocky demeanor that gave him the audacity to pull up from seemingly anywhere. I also loved the way he left his jersey on the floor against the Seattle SuperSonics, and his Agent Zero persona:\n\nOne of the coolest things I ever witnessed was his buzzer beater against Utah, where he put his arms up triumphantly and turned around before the shot went in.\n\nThey have yet to invent a number for the number of times I recreated that shot in my driveway.\n\nAt the ripe age of 10, I watched a young man at the ripe age of 23 deliver Washington its first playoff appearance in eight ears. I still see the 2005 playoffs from the adolescent lens through which I first witnessed them, and Marv Albert's \"YES!\" still echoes through my head as I replay his Game 5 buzzer beater against Chicago.\n\nIt wasn't long after that I saw this same man go toe-to-toe with a player who is (rightfully or wrongfully so) consistently compared to the likes of Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson in a duel that is only epic to Wizards fans like myself.\n\nSay what you will about Gilbert Arenas, but it wasn't long ago that he was rapidly making a case to be considered one of the best scorers in the league. He was an explosive offensive weapon; a human highlight reel that could give you 40 on any given night with a fitting quote sure to follow, both of which were always accompanied with his goofy smile.\n\nThe notion that Arenas was a punk is an understandable one, especially given the state that his career ended in. But those indiscretions all made Gilbert who he was. And don't get me wrong, this is most certainly a biased opinion.\n\nI see Gilbert the same way I did as a kid, and I will be the first to admit that as a fact. It is because of my childhood affinity for Arenas that I will still argue to the death with anybody who disrespects Gilbert, Caron Butler, and Antawn Jamison by calling Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Ray Allen or LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh the \"Real Big Three\" (as you attempt to hold back your laughter, just pretend I didn't say that). However, the biased view I have for him is one that is shared by many Wizards fans of my era.\n\nWhat Washington got when they signed Arenas in 2003 was a competitor in every facet of the word.\n\nHe was constantly doubted. Gilbert was discounted when he was a high school recruit ranked outside of his class' top 100. He was taken in the second round of the 2001 NBA Draft and had to fight his way up the Golden State Warriors' rotation. It just seemed that Gilbert faced major hurdles until when he was asked by Eddie Jordan to move from the shooting guard to the point guard position for the first time in his life.\n\nDuring the 2006-2007 season, he put up 60 points against Kobe Bryant in his prime, 54 against (another childhood hero) Steve Nash and 51 against Deron Williams. Once the Hibachi was lit, all you could do was watch him go to work.\n\nWatching highlights of the 2006 playoff series against the well-trimmed hairline of a baby-faced Lebron James and his Cavaliers gives insight to how close Gilbert was to reaching a level of greatness that he rarely gets credit for. He went bucket for bucket with a player who will go down as one of our games greats.\n\nStill only 24, his 34 points per game in that series were not enough to get the job done. It still breaks my heart when I see Damon Jones hit that corner three to sink the Wizards in Game 6 because I remember experiencing the play live. Seated in a local restaurant in a shocked silence, I was introduced how cruel the nature of losing in basketball could be. Even as I watch today, a part of me still hopes he will miss that shot. It always goes in.\n\nI think back to the times on my old basement couch, where I sat in my barely retro gold jersey and watched in utter amazement at what Gilbert Arenas did on a nightly basis. My inner child still resents Gerald Wallace for falling on his ankle and altering the trajectory of his career.\n\nThat moment was simply another case of Gilbert being in the wrong place at the wrong time, only this time without a gun in his hand. What Gilbert Arenas is known for today will never be what Gilbert Arenas is to many fans in Washington. His game was as unique as his personality, and both consistently stole the show.\n\nThere was no closure for Washington fans like myself. One has to wonder what could have been when thinking about Arenas as a player.\n\nCould he have delivered a championship to Washington? Probably not. But he was only 25 at the end of this his best seasons in Washington (2004-2007); the same age as John Wall, Damian Lillard, and DeMarcus Cousins and younger than Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, and James Harden.\n\nHe averaged an incredible 27.7 ppg over the course of those seasons when he was still just 23, 24, and 25 years old. That mark is higher than what Bryant, Wade, Curry, and Harden each averaged at that age in their careers. While my pain is subsided by the current state of the franchise, I know that there will never be another Gilbert Arenas.\n\nThe end of Game 6 in the 2006 series against the Cavaliers is a fitting metaphor for his career. Despite putting up 36 points and hitting the 3 that forced overtime earlier in the game, he ended the contest by missing two free throws in the clutch.\n\nHe could not make the simple play that would have extended the Wizards' lead. The 36 points he scored are still overshadowed by the two he could not get.\n\nNow, he is a man whose immense accomplishments and talent are overshadowed by his indiscretions and mistakes. What he could do will always be outweighed by what he could not. In our world of sports, it is easy for the common fan to forget someone like Gilbert Arenas.\n\nDespite all the reasons that I could do the same, for me it will remain impossible."
