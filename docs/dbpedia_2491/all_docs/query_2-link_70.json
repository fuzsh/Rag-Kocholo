A member of the first cohort of Esperanza’s member-elected leadership committee, and now a Board Chair for TOOF, he has remained fiercely committed to community building since his arrival on-site in late 2019.\n\nDuring his time on the leadership committee, Michael helped advocate for more lighting at night to bolster safety for community members. He was also instrumental in engaging community members to work in partnership with TOOF in developing the site plan that has transformed Esperanza from a tent city to a safe and dignified non-congregate homeless shelter complex.\n\nMichael believes that representation from the people TOOF serves is important at all levels, from the Leadership Committee all the way up to the Board of Directors. He is continuing his journey towards housing, but plans to take the leadership and community building skills he has developed during his time at Esperanza with him, and work in a leadership capacity in other organizations in the future. “I’m looking forward to bigger and better things in the future,” says Nieves. “You could be what you want to be and you could do it if you want to. Don't let nobody put you down saying you can't do it.”\n\nDr. Kathryn J Kotrla is a psychiatrist specializing in the neuroscience of trauma and recovery.
