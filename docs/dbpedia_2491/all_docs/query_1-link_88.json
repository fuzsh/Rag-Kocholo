        "text": "chrome ball sits down with duane for conversation.\n\nLet’s kick it off with the usuals… when did you first start skating? What was your first board and who were your favorite skaters growing up?\n\n1985. My first “proper” board was a G&S Foil Tail w/red Gullwings and two-tone…I think they were red & yellow… City Street wheels. I had no particular favorite skater growing up... though I really liked the Bones Brigade team, but who didn’t.\n\nWhat was the scene like down in Louisiana? I know Sal was coming up around the same time you were…\n\nThe scene was small, but very tight knit. I’m still friends with these dudes 20+ years later…I actually skate with them currently as I moved back to New Orleans 9 months ago after being gone for 16 years. But there was a strong sense of community back then… between three main hub cities for skating that is….which is New Orleans, Baton Rouge where Sal was from, and Lafayette where Charlie Thomas and Shannon May was at. Everyone traveled within these three cities as they are fairly close to each other.\n\nHow’d you get hooked up with G&S?\n\nI got sponsored by G&S at the NSA Regionals in Fort Wayne, Indiana by Mike Hill who would later start Alien Workshop with Chris Carter and Blender… though Neil wasn’t an actual financial partner in the company. Mike saw me skating during a practice session the day before the actual contest and asked me if I wanted to ride for G&S. I was stoked and rode for G&S the next day in the contest. I got 12th place, just qualifying for the finals.\n\nYou got sponsored around the time street skating started really coming into its own and breaking away from the old vert guard. The G&S team was a prime example of this where almost all the pros were older vert dudes while the significant majority of ams were young street kids. You ever get any beef from the older halfpipe heads?\n\nI never got any shit other than older kids busting the younger kids' balls….in that “hey little grommet” kinda way…but that was part of it. A “hazing”, if you will. When you went through it all and showed you could skate and/or had the heart, they accepted you and it was a killer feeling. Something you earned…earned respect, that is. These days this doesn’t exist as the good kids are like 9 yrs old and whatnot… and it seems kids want respect way too early. Its nuts.\n\nYeah, I sound like a grumpy old man, but I like it (haha).\n\nHow’d you first meet Neil? Tours with him and Claar must’ve been something else…\n\nIn SoCal, while on G&S, I met him at this sweet little mini-ramp that he was skating in a certain video I can’t remember… Mike Hill brought Rob Dyrdek and I to skate with him. He showed me that “holographic” card he used in Footage while saying \"trip out, trip out.\" I thought it was hella cool when he started doing it right in front of me…. I was like 15 years old, seshing with Blender and getting to experience his brand of humor. Killer stuff. Then when we left, he said “Duane, you’re my main man.” I smiled no doubt.\n\nLater on in San Diego, we became friends…with me being an “adult” and getting into playing music and everything. He’d come to my shows here and there. I built a website for his art back in the day. Neil is an awesome dude, it’d be cool to hang with him as it was been like 8 years since I’ve seen him. Tours with him and Claar… well, I just remember general times with them….killer people to have as mentors. Humorous, yet quick to call bullshit on certain aspects of life….basically what I’ve become. Those two along with Mike Hill and Chris Carter were certainly like my older brothers, and I’m happy that it was that way.\n\nFootage was the first real video part I remember you coming out with. Were you stoked on your part? Did you just film that around Louisiana? And what the hell were you doing in that tub talking to Ernie with saran wrap on your head?\n\nFootage was my first video part. Not too bad to get the opening part in your first video with a yet-to-be-released song of your favorite band at the time (The Wagon by Dinosaur Jr). The footage in my part was filmed in Baton Rouge… the opening few tricks were... then New Orleans, Phoenix and San Diego.\n\nThe Ernie business...well that was in Arizona at the NSA Finals, the ones I qualified for in Fort Wayne where I got sponsored by G&S. Mike got that puppet at a swap meet right by the contest area. Then at the hotel, I just went into my brand of silly weirdo comedy. They thought I was out of my mind…I think that made them even more stoked. The laughs in the background are Mike and Rob.\n\nNow its pretty apparent when watching Footage that the camp is getting ready to split in half… with Chris, Mike and Neil spending so much of their energy on this new direction that would ultimately become Alien Workshop. When did you first hear about the plan to separate from G&S? Did you know while you were filming for Footage that this was the plan? And why Xenia?\n\nI actually quit G&S to ride for H-Street while they were editing Footage. Sal kept trying to get me to ride for H-Street and after a little “mix-up” at G&S, I rode for H-street for something like 2 months. Then Hill and Carter sent me a rough edit of Footage, knowing I’d be stoked to have the first part… and not being another unimportant rider for H-Street, as the team was huge."
