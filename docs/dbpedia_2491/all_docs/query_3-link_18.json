It is both a highly specific and universal image of midlife burdens and exhaustion.\n\nGo deeper\n\nThis sculpture at the Toledo Museum of Art\n\nLearn more about The Organization Man and its author, William Whyte\n\nRead about the social turmoil of the 1960s\n\nExplore more of Duane Hanson’s work\n\nLearn about the rise of suburbs and the “Organization Man” through primary source documents\n\nRead about youth culture and the antiwar movement in the 1960s\n\nMore to think about\n\nDuane Hanson’s Executive was originally commissioned for the lobby of an office building. How do you think seeing the work in that space would be different than seeing it today in a museum?\n\nSmarthistory images for teaching and learning:\n\n[flickr_tags user_id=”82032880@N00″ tags=”hansonexecutive,”]\n\nMore Smarthistory images…\n\nSelected Contributors\n\nSeeing America is developed and distributed by Smarthistory together with a consortium of museums, including:\n\nAmon Carter Museum of American Art\n\nArt Institute of Chicago\n\nBrooklyn Museum\n\nCrystal Bridges Museum of American Art\n\nDenver Art Museum\n\nFine Arts Museums of San Francisco\n\nFirst Americans Museum\n\nGeorgia Museum of Art\n\nGilcrease Museum\n\nLos Angeles County Museum of Art\n\nMinneapolis Institute of Art\n\nNewark Museum\n\nNational Museum of the American Indian, Smithsonian Institution\n\nPennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts\n\nPhiladelphia Museum of Art\n\nPortland Art Museum\n\nSmithsonian American Art Museum\n\nTerra Foundation for American Art\n\nToledo Museum of Art\n\nTotem Heritage Center\n\nVirginia Museum of Fine Arts\n\nWadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art\n\nCite this page as: Dr. Halona Norton-Westbrook, Toledo Museum of Art and Dr. Steven Zucker, \"Disillusionment in 1970s America,\" in Smarthistory, April 7, 2019, accessed August 12, 2024, https://smarthistory.org/seeing-america-2/hanson-executive-sa/."
