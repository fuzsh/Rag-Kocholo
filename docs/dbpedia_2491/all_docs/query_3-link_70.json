Dave’s probably here. Thanks for coming.\n\nThe big news, of course, is Ryne Sandberg’s prostate cancer, but that has its own page here so I needn’t dig into it.\n\nSecondarily , by now we’re all resigned, more or less, to this offseason trudging across the tundra while the staring contest between Scott Boras and his cadre of potential precedent-setting deals and the holders of player contracts continues.\n\nPlayers should be commencing team activities or at least thinking about it, not trying to decide where they’re going to live, where the kids are going to school, etc. Freee Agency is unlikely to drag out into Spring Training, but with a market like this, who knows?\n\n... as always, something something developments.\n\n*means autoplay on, or annoying ads, or both (directions to remove for Firefox and Chrome). {$} means paywall. {$} means limited views. Italics are often used on this page as sarcasm font. The powers that be have enabled sarcasm font in the comments.\n\nMLB.com*: Carter Hawkins talks [AUDIO].\n\nJordan Bastian (MLB.com*): Kyle Hendricks relives the highest highs of ‘really special day’. “Just to realize that I get to come back to Chicago, for my family, everything, it’s just so special all around.” Mark Powell talks Hendricks.\n\nSam Dykstra (MLB.com*): Here are the Top 10 2B prospects for 2024. “3. James Triantos, Cubs (2025).” Brett Taylor talks Triantos.\n\nAdam Duvall (Peoria Journal-Star*): How another Chicago Cubs baseball star ended up at this West Peoria bar. “Tauchman was back in Peoria after getting inducted into the Bradley athletics hall of fame earlier in the day...”\n\nJake Misener (Cubbies Crib*): There is ‘widespread belief’ Cody Bellinger will re-sign with the Chicago Cubs. Or Mark Feinsand at least says so. Brett Taylor compares it to Dexter Fowler’s first FA.\n\nJesse Goldberg-Strassler (Baseball Digest*): 2023 Broadcaster of the Year: Alex Cohen. “Alex Cohen is more than just a radio broadcaster,” said Ballpark Digest owner and publisher Kevin Reichard.\n\nFood for Thought:"
