        "text": "The Jets activated veteran tackle Duane Brown off of injured reserve on Thursday.\n\nBrown started the first two games of the season at left tackle before a hip injury landed him on injured reserve.\n\nThe 38-year-old began practicing three weeks ago, meaning the Jets either had to activate him Thursday or he would be done for the season.\n\nIt was unclear how much Brown can play immediately.\n\nHe may just be a backup until he gets more practice time.\n\nThe Jets could use his help.\n\nThey are going to start their eighth different offensive line combination on Friday against the Dolphins.\n\nRookie Carter Warren could start at left tackle if Brown can’t with Mekhi Becton out with a sprained ankle.\n\nThe Jets also signed Xavier Newman to the active roster.\n\nHe is expected to start at right guard. They released Chris Glaser, who started last week, on Thursday.\n\nBrown played 12 games last year for the Jets after signing with them in August of 2022.\n\nBrown missed the first four games with a torn rotator cuff.\n\nHe declined to have surgery on the shoulder and played through the injury before missing the final game of the year.\n\nBrown had surgery after the season and missed most of training camp as he recovered.\n\nBrown struggled in the first two games of this season and the Jets admitted he may have come back too soon from the injury.\n\nHe also developed a hip injury and went to IR after a rough game against the Cowboys in Week 2.\n\nThe Jets elevated OL Jake Hanson and DL Tanzel Smart from the practice squad for Friday’s game. CB Michael Carter II (hamstring) is doubtful to play Friday. OT Mekhi Becton (ankle) is questionable but did not practice on Thursday. Brown and OT Billy Turner (finger) are also listed as questionable."
