        "text": "Duane Carter, as Assistant Director of the Library and the Serials/Electronic Resources Librarian, assists the Director in the management of the library and is responsible for the continued maintenance of the print serials and electronic resources. Duane joined the Seminary of the Southwest in 2003 as the Serials Library Assistant while working on the Masters of Science in Information Studies. Upon the completion of the degree, Duane was hired full-time as the Serials Librarian. Subsequently, Duane’s position became the Serials and Electronic Resources Librarian to reflect the library’s increasing acquisitions of digital resources. Duane was also named Curator of Sacred Music stemming from his expertise in music.\n\nDuane has been instrumental in coordinating the library’s digitization projects, including recruiting, interviewing, and supervising capstone students and interns hired to work on these projects. He has also taken on the key role in moving the library into the digital age through the acquisition and implementation of several technological tools required for the delivery of electronic resources.\n\nComing from a career in teaching, Duane initially became active in public libraries during the summer breaks from the classroom. After completing his MA in 2000 from California State University, San Bernardino, he assisted in building a literacy program at the A.K. Smiley Library in Redlands, California. Duane applied for the ALA Spectrum Scholarship, a program advocating for diversity in librarianship, and admission into the Information School at The University of Texas at Austin, from which he received his MSIS in 2005.\n\nDuane is married with 2 grown children and 3 grandchildren. He is a member of St. Williams Catholic Church in Round Rock, and spends his free time researching, writing, composing, and performing music."
