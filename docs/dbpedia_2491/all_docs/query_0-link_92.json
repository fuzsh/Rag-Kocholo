This Bill is to make using a handheld cellphone while driving a primary offense. Ben has been working hard with the PA DUI Association all year and has completed many service projects for SADD and for Steel Valley. At the press conference, parents whose children were killed by distracted drivers attended the event and shared their stories to show why this legislation is so important. Steel Valley SADD is very proud of Ben for all his efforts. Remember to put the phone down, and drive safely!\n\nSADD Just Drive Take the Pledge\n\nSteel Valley SADD would like to congratulate Benjamin Novotny, Chelsea Bulger, Brenna Kern, Veronica Brocato, Joe Nguyen, and Breanne Francis. These 6 students have been chosen to be this year's 2022 NJM's Just Drive Teen Influencers. As Teen Influencers these 6 students will focus on making an impact on their peers to make good decisions while driving. The focus of this year's program will take a look at bad weather driving, safe driving, impairment behind the wheel, seat belts, and more. This project is being student led by one of our own, Benjamin Novotny.

SADD students also created a video campaign for the Great American Smokeout, with a script written by high school student Chelsea Bulger.
