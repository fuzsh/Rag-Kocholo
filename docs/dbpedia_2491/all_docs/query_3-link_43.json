        "text": "Casey Duane Gross, 60, of Gillette, WY passed away on October 19, 2021 at Campbell County Memorial Hospital after a struggle with ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease). He was born on June 10, 1961 in Belle Fourche, SD to David and Vonnie Gross and grew up on a ranch south of Ekalaka, MT in the Belltower Community. As a child, you would often find him tending to his lambs and setting small game traps. He graduated from Carter County High School in 1979, excelling in athletics including football, basketball, and baseball. Casey moved to Gillette, WY in 1981 and married his high school sweetheart, Ronda, the following year. They have three amazing children together, Ryan, Sarah, and Matt, with their marriage ending in 1997. He spent his later years with Wesann, never missing a good morning or goodnight text.\n\nCasey cherished the lifelong friends he made throughout his career with Fairmont Supply and then as the Purchasing Supervisor at Black Thunder Mine. He was hard working, competitive, selfless, and the first to lend a helping hand. Casey spent every free moment with his kids playing board games, cards, sports, riding horses, and cheering them on in their various activities. He loved spending time in the Big Horn Mountains where he had a passion for hunting, fishing, camping, and riding atvs. He also excelled at competitive cornhole and enjoyed giving back to the youth of the community by officiating basketball. Regardless of the activity, he was rarely without a Diet Coke and sweet treat in his hand. He especially enjoyed spoiling his grandkids and spending as much time as possible with them.\n\nCasey was a loving father, grandfather, son, brother, and friend. He always had a smile on his face and never ran out of his “dad quotes”, jokes, and family sayings. Casey will be missed immensely and is survived by his three children, Ryan (Kristin) Gross and their children, Kylie, Connor, Lauryn, and Landon of Gillette, WY; Sarah (Chris) Vogl and their children, Frazier and Lennyn of Mitchell, SD; Matt Gross of Gillette, WY; partner and friend, Wesann Brown of Gillette, WY; mother, Vonnie Gross of Gillette, WY; brother, Steve (Leann) Gross of Gillette, WY; sister, Shelley (Kevin) Rehbein of Moorcroft, WY and numerous nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, and cousins. Casey is preceded in death by his father, David Gross.\n\nWith a lifelong love of wildlife and the outdoors, Casey would appreciate donations in his name to the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation at ​​https://www.rmef.org or the Wyoming Sportsman’s Group at https://www.wyosportsmangroup.com in lieu of flowers. Memorials and condolences may also be sent in care of Gillette Memorial Chapel, 210 West 5th Street, Gillette, WY 82716.Condoelnces may also be expressed at www.gillettememorialchapel.com\n\nMass of Christian Burial for Casey will be held at 11:00 a.m., Friday, October 29, 2021 at St. Matthew's Catholic Church with Father Cliff Jacobson officiating; interment to follow at Mt. Pisgah Cemetery, with a luncheon thereafter. Visitation will be held from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., Thursday, October 28, 2021 at Gillette Memorial Chapel.
