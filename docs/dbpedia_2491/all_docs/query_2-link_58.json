        "text": "I am a Sophmore at Independence Community College, Kansas . I am 5'9\" and 205 pounds and recently I ran a 3.96 5/10/5 shuttle time at the national underclassmen combine. My last max bench press was 450, squat was 650 and, my clean was 315. Some of my most important accomplishments recently were Making the All-State Team and being invited to play in the Florida All-State All-Star Game at the National Underclassmen Combine I received the MVP award for running backs, or right after the combine when Tony Collins former New England Patriots running back told me that there were only about 1% of people that actually make it to the NFL and that I've been blessed with the ability to where I can soon be in that 1%. Also I recieved high praises from Tommie Robinson, Arizona Cardinals running backs coach. I am currently taking 18 semester hours and passing all of my classes. I am registered with the NCAA clearinghouse. My biggest accomplishment is realizing that I was blessed with a gift that I could use instead of being lazy or wasting it and ending up like a lot of people do because they don't know what they have until it's too late and all I have to do is work as hard in the class room as I do on the field. Things I can offer a team is a team player that is not selfish that can put his team before him. I can push myself not only to make me better but to make the team better. I can also bring leadership to the table. I have been a leader on every team I have been a part of. I have always dreamt of playing division 1 football but I realize I can't just say you want to Ido something, I have to go out and work harder than anyone out there and earn it. That means doing what I can do to get better when no one is watching. I'm looking for a school that could first give me the best education I can receive and provide me the opportunity to play and contribute to the teams success. I am planning on majoring in business and earning a minor in forensic science. My realistic athletic goals are to play at the highest level of competition my hard work and dedication to football can allow me to play and take full advatntage of the situation. I would be grateful for the opportunity that some people don't have, which is pursuing my football career."
