        "text": "Successfully navigating our world is becoming increasingly complex for children, adolescents, and adults alike. Mixed messages, regular stressors, and new (often unexpected) challenges compete for our time, attention, and energy on a daily basis. It is easy to become exhausted and overwhelmed.\n\nRather than add another voice to the mix, I sit with my clients and help them filter through the “noise” in order to help them eliminate discrepancies between their lives today and who they want to be in the future.\n\nI recognize each of my clients as a unique individual with a complex set of life experiences and counseling needs. Because of this, I customize sessions with a variety of approaches including client-centered, solution-focused, and cognitive behavior therapy."
