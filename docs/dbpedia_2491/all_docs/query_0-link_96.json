        "text": "Duane Bailey, whose extensive career in athletics administration has included roles with the Big East Conference, Atlantic 10 Conference, and the National Football League, was appointed by Vice President of Athletics Bryan Maggard to join Louisiana's senior leadership team as Deputy Director of Athletics and Chief Financial Officer in November 2018. In this capacity, Bailey oversees the department's Business Office, Human Resources, Equipment Room, and Facilities & Event Management operations, and serves as the sport program administrator for the Women's Soccer program.\n\nIn August 2020, Bailey expanded his role at the University to include oversight of campus auxiliary units, such as Campus Housing, Property Management, Retail Operations, Transportation Services, Campus Print & Ship Center, Campus Food Services, the Office of Professional and Continuing Education, and KRVS Media.\n\nPrior to his tenure at Louisiana, Bailey spent seven years at Seton Hall University, where he collaborated on financial planning, oversaw departmental external relations, compliance and risk management, and served as the sport program administrator for basketball and women's volleyball. Bailey managed $39 million worth of athletic facility construction and renovations, negotiated the Pirates' all-sport apparel agreement, and played a key role in developing Seton Hall's student-athlete life skills programming.\n\nBefore Seton Hall, Bailey worked with the Atlantic 10 Conference in Philadelphia as Associate Commissioner and Chief Financial Officer. In this role, he managed the conference office's financial and business operations, guided a $7 million operating budget, and negotiated conference sponsorship agreements.\n\nBailey also served as Director of Athletics and Recreational Services at the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) from 2015 to 2017. During his tenure, he oversaw 13 varsity sport programs, seven club sports, 240 student-athletes, and 50 staff members and coaches. His achievements at NYIT included the addition of Women's Lacrosse and Esports, the construction of a student fitness facility, and 11 coaching and senior staff hires. Under his leadership, NYIT's Learfield Cup ranking rose from 135th to 60th nationally, with the Bears winning five conference championships and six regular season championships. Bailey was recognized by the ECAC as the 2016 Division 2 Athletic Administrator of the Year, and NYIT student-athletes achieved a departmental 3.0 grade point average.\n\nFollowing NYIT, Bailey served as Director of Athletics at the University of New Haven from 2017 to 2018, overseeing 17 varsity sports, 12 club sports, 350 student-athletes, and more than 80 staff members and coaches. Sixteen programs exceeded NCAA Academic Success Rate standards under his leadership, and Bailey played a significant role in fundraising for football stadium improvements.\n\nBailey's career also includes a decade in the NFL, first as a salary cap analyst and labor operations coordinator at the league office in New York City, then as Manager of Player Compensation for the Kansas City Chiefs. His responsibilities with the Chiefs included designing and managing an $80 million operating budget, negotiating player contracts, and coordinating stadium renovations.\n\nBailey currently serves on the NCAA Women’s Soccer Committee as well as on the board of directors for the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) and has previously served on the boards and subcommittees of various sports governing bodies, including US Lacrosse, USA Bobsled & Skeleton, and the United States Tennis Association. He is also an active member of several professional development organizations, including the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics (NACDA), and the College Athletic Business Management Association (CABMA).\n\nA St. John's University alum with a bachelor’s degree in finance, Bailey earned a master’s degree in athletic administration from Adelphi University and an MBA from Long Island University. He is married to Gale Divins, a telecommunications attorney and fellow St. John's graduate, and they have one daughter, Ava."
