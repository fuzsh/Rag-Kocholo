        "text": "Rob grew up across the street from Sunnycrest Farm in Londonderry, New Hampshire. As a child Rob wanted nothing more than to be an apple farmer. He spent most of his time across the road from his house at Sunnycrest, and eventually they offered him a job. When Rob graduated from High School in 1972 Sunnycrest purchased the orchard in Concord and offered Rob the job as manager. Rob then asked his High School sweetheart to marry him, and the two of them moved up to the one room farm house.\n\nIn 1974 Rob and his wife Annette started a family with the birth of their first son Todd, followed by their second son Nick five years later. Rob and Annette worked the farm together, changing the farm over the years. They added a playground area for families, walking trails, an observation tower, and a bakery for Annette.\n\nIn 1999 Sunnycrest made the difficult decision to sell the orchard. Rob and Annette knew that they wanted to purchase the orchard; but could not manage to purchase the farm on their own. With federal funds from the Farmland Protection Program and help from their friends and neighbors; Rob and Annette were able to purchase the Orchard in 2001 renaming the farm Carter Hill Orchard.\n\nSince Rob and Annette have become the Orchard’s owners they have expanded the bakery, and renovated the farm stand. Rob along with his friend Rick Duane have started a cider mill (New Hampshire Cider Works) at the orchard. Most importantly they have built a new home on the farm; where they live with their oldest son Todd, his wife and Rob and Annette’s grandchildren. The Larocques are planning on running the orchard for years to come.\n\nIn 2013, Todd Larocque was named Young Farmer of the Year by the Concord Grange. Carter Hill Orchard is a member of the New Hampshire Growers Cooperative."
