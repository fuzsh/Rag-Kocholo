        "text": "Duane Walter Swinney of East Wenatchee, and formerly of Chelan, Washington, passed away peacefully Friday, January 13 at the age of 84 following a brief illness. Our gentle and kind husband, father and grandfather will be deeply missed and always loved.\n\nBorn September 8, 1938 in Caldwell, Idaho to Walter and Myrtle (Lay) Swinney, Duane spent his childhood in Worley, Idaho helping his family on the farm and attending school where he excelled in sports, especially high school baseball and basketball. He joined the Naval Reserve in his junior year of high school and was called to active duty in October of 1956.\n\nIn December of 1956, Duane married his high school sweetheart, Gerry Marsh, at her parent’s home near Potlatch, Idaho. The newlyweds moved to Long Beach, California where Duane prepared for oversees duty. In January of 1958, Duane shipped out on a minesweeper and served six months on the high seas visiting many countries. While overseas, his first son Jay was born. After his honorable discharge, Duane and his new family moved to Montana to once again farm alongside his father and brother.\n\nIn 1961, Duane and his family returned to Idaho where he worked and attended University of Idaho, earning a degree in business administration in 1968. After graduation, the family moved to Portland, Oregon where he began his professional career as an accountant. In 1969, the family moved to Spokane, Washington and Duane joined Morris, Lee & Co. as a CPA and was quickly promoted to manage their office in Chelan, Washington. Duane eventually purchased and successfully operated the Chelan business until his retirement in 2004.\n\nAs a long-time resident of Chelan, Duane was active in the community and served on the board of directors for the Chamber of Commerce, the Rotary Club, and the Lake Chelan Hospital Foundation. He also served as president of the Rotary Club. Duane was very active and enjoyed coaching little league baseball and basketball. When he wasn’t coaching or attending his children’s sporting events, he would often be boating on Lake Chelan or camping in the mountains with his family. He enjoyed any activity that brought his family closer together.\n\nDuane is survived by his wife of 66 years, Gerry Swinney of East Wenatchee, Washington; children Darin (Louise) Swinney of Chelan, Washington, and Kelly (Jason) Hedgepeth of La Grande, Oregon; brother Glenn (Connie) Swinney; grandchildren Allysen, Mandalyn, Katie and Brogan; great-grandchildren Maysey, Connor, Makenna and Carter. He was preceded in death by his son Jay, his parents, and sister.\n\nThere will be a service and interment at a date to be determined in Palouse, Washington beside his son, Jay."
