        "text": "Please reference CCSO Case # 21-005048\n\nPhotos:\n\nBooking photo: Brandon Duane Carter, 32, of Portland\n\nBooking photo: Tyler Scott Whitney, 28, of Sandy\n\nSearch and arrest photos: [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ]\n\nB-ROLL VIDEO of SEARCH FOR SUSPECT BRANDON CARTER (.mp4):\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/b0umhpbma5h1o6x/Broll-21-005048-BrandonDuaneCarterSearchArrest.mp4?dl=0\n\nJust after 5 a.m. on Thursday, March 11, 2021, a Clackamas County Sheriff's Office deputy attempted to stop a white 1996 Nissan Sentra occupied by two males. It was still dark, and the deputy noticed the following:\n\nThe car did not have its lights on.\n\nThe driver was failing to keep the car in its lane.\n\nThe car had a distinct lack of license plates.\n\nThe driver of the Nissan failed to yield to the deputy's lights -- instead leading the deputy on a pursuit from Clackamas to Boring. Authorities joining the chase attempted to slow the vehicle with spike strips. Ultimately, deputies called off the pursuit and began checking the area to see if the driver had stopped somewhere.\n\nAn abandoned car, a dense thicket\n\nDeputies located the suspect vehicle abandoned on SE Altman Road and SE Pipeline Road, just north of the county line. The car had been driven off the road and was stuck in the dirt and tall grass. The passenger door was open. Deputies checked the car and found it empty. The ignition from the vehicle was missing and a few wires hung in its place. The registration was not up to date, and deputies checked with the last registered owner, who explained it had been sold long ago.\n\nDeputies set up containment down the hill toward SE Oxbow Lane -- and then heard the suspect (or suspects) in the brush to the north.\n\nThe area where the suspect(s) was thought to be hiding was about an acre of land with a creek running through it, filled with dense blackberry briars and large trees. The area was surrounded by nursery fields.\n\nAuthorities learned there were two people linked to the suspect vehicle. One was Tyler Scott Whitney, 28, of Sandy. Mr. Whitney had an active felony probation violation warrant out of Washington County for a Felon in Possession of a Firearm. (The second person associated with the vehicle -- uninvolved in today's incident -- is on parole for a Robbery conviction out of Clackamas County.)\n\nA police dog and aerial drone were requested as deputies continued to search and contain the area.\n\nCapture 1: Brandon Carter in the thorny briars\n\nAt about 7:30 a.m. deputies foraging through the blackberries and creek located one of the two subjects -- Brandon Duane Carter, 32, of Portland -- trying to hide under some brush. He was taken into custody without further incident.\n\nAs seen in the B-roll video, Deputies cut and broke a path out of the dense, thorny briers to walk Mr. Carter out of his hiding place. It turned out he had two felony warrants out of Multnomah County for Burglary I and Assault IV.\n\nAfter Carter's capture, deputies continued an exhaustive search through the brush for the second suspect. They ultimately called off the suspect hunt around 8 a.m. and towed the suspect vehicle.\n\nAmerican Medical Response was called to the scene to transported Carter to an area hospital for an injured leg and a headache. After being cleared at the hospital, Carter was transported to and booked at the Clackamas County Jail on his felony warrant. A booking photo is attached. Complete booking info is here: https://web3.clackamas.us/roster/#inmates\n\nCapture 2: Tyler Whitney climbs out of a ditch\n\nLater that day, around 12 noon, Multnomah County dispatch received two 911 calls about a subject crawling out of a ditch in the same area and walking away.\n\nA Multnomah County Sheriff's Office deputy detained this second subject on Altman Road, east of SE Lusted Road.\n\nIt was, in fact, Tyler Scott Whitney.\n\nA Clackamas County deputy responded to the location and took Whitney in custody. Whitney was transported to the Clackamas County Jail and booked without incident on his felony probation violation.\n\nB-roll video from the morning search can be downloaded from Dropbox here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/b0umhpbma5h1o6x/Broll-21-005048-BrandonDuaneCarterSearchArrest.mp4?dl=0\n\nThis is still an active investigation. Evidence from the vehicle will be processed and the deputy will determine who was operating the vehicle. Additional criminal charges may be forthcoming.\n\nThe following agencies assisted us with resolving this incident safely and successfully:\n\nMultnomah County Sheriff's Office\n\nSandy Police Department\n\nCanby Police Department\n\nAmerican Medical Response\n\nGladstone Police Department (with K9 Nanuk)\n\nADDITIONAL INFO SOUGHT:\n\nAnyone with information on criminal activity involving Brandon Carter or Tyler Whitney is urged to contact the Sheriff's Office Tip Line -- by phone at 503-723-4949 or by using the online email form at https://www.clackamas.us/sheriff/tip .
