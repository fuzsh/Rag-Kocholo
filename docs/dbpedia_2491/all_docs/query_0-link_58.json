        "text": "Following their third straight loss, the 4-6 New York Jets travel back home to take on the 7-3 Miami Dolphins, but not after making more changes to the offense. First, the team benched quarterback Zach Wilson in favor of Tim Boyle, while making Trevor Siemian the primary backup. This means that, under the new NFL rule allowing a 3rd gameday signal caller, Wilson will only see the field if both Boyle and Siemian suffer an injury. It is likely safe to say that Wilson’s season is all but done and his future in New York will come into question this January. Also on the offensive side of the ball, WR Allen Lazard is inactive for today’s game. He has seven drops on the season and has been a detriment more than a benefit in the past few weeks. This move allows more opportunities for UDFAs Xavier Gipson and Jason Brownlee, with Irv Charles also seeing more snaps. Offensive lineman Duane Brown (hip) was activated off IR yesterday, and he will play. Mekhi Becton suffered an ankle injury just 8 snaps into last week’s matchup, and he will not play today.\n\nDefensively, slot cornerback Michael Carter II is still dealing with a hamstring injury and will be inactive. Sam Equavoen (hip) will also miss his second consecutive game. Carl Lawson is once again a healthy scratch. Here is the full list of inactive players for this Black Friday AFC East tilt:"
