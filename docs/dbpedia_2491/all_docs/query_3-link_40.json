        "text": "William “Will” Patrick Carter\n\n7/3/2013 – 4/9/2016\n\nTragedy struck on April 9, 2016 and took our William from us. He died later that night at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, WA.\n\nWill joined our family and his very proud big brothers Jack and Owen on July 3, 2013. He was born to Nathan Guy Carter and Hillary Quiett Carter after lots of convincing by Hillary that a third child was needed in their family. He was loved dearly by all and we will miss him greatly.\n\nWilliam was the happiest, most thoughtful, kind, and caring individual and we hope you had a chance to meet him and let him touch your heart as he did ours. He enjoyed anything outdoors and playing with his brothers. He was always getting the “guys” to help him out with whatever he needed. All winter long he kept saying “Let’s go camping.” Last weekend with the warm temperatures we headed out for our first camping trip of the year where he played with his trucks and threw rocks in the creek. He enjoyed hiking, camping, swimming, fishing, biking, helping on the farm, riding tractors and 4 wheelers, and jumping on the trampoline. Will was always excited to do any family outing and wanted to be sure everyone was included.\n\nWill made some great friends at 3R’s Daycare and Preschool. Even on the weekends when we were talking about what we did for the day he would say “I played with friends…. played outside.” He got to play dress up, which was becoming a favorite activity. He did not like being dropped off; however, he never really wanted to leave either.\n\nHe is survived by his parents, Nat and Hillary and his brothers, Jack and Owen; his maternal grandparents, Deb and Dan Sloat of Helena MT and Duane and Jan Quiett of Gettysburg, SD; and paternal grandparents Guy and Connie Carter of Memphis, TN. He is survived by maternal great grandparents Doris Quiett of Gettysburg, SD, Lois Stemper of Redfield, SD, Dorothy Sloat of Gettysburg, SD, and Silvia Sloat of Gettysburg, SD. He is also survived by many aunts, uncles, and cousins.\n\nA celebration of his life will be held on Saturday April 16 at 2:30pm at Anderson, Stevenson, Wilke Funeral home 3750 N. Montana Avenue. William’s friends and their parents are welcome to join us in this celebration. A reception will follow in the social hall of the funeral home. Please visit www.aswfuneralhome.com to offer the family a condolence or to share a memory of Will.\n\nThe family requests no flowers. A memorium fund will be set up in the future."
