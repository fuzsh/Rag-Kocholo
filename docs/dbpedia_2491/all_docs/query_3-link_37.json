        "text": "ARLINGTON — Evan Carter tried and tried again. Then he had to stop and stop again.\n\nNow, with the understanding that his first full major league season is all but certainly over, he’s reached the acceptance stage.\n\n“I don’t know if ‘lying to yourself’ is the right word for it,” the Texas Rangers’ rookie outfielder said Sunday. “But any competitive person is going to tell themself that they’re good to go, and it kind of takes [your body] telling you that, really, that it’s not, for you to kind of accept that.”\n\nThe 21-year-old has been sidelined since May with a stress reaction/lumbar sprain in his lower back, and according to general manager Chris Young, the Rangers are “not overly optimistic” that the he will return in the regular season. Texas had tried on multiple occasions to ramp Carter up, though his injury continued to be bothersome each time he moved through his hitting progressions.\n\nCarter said that the rotations required to swing a bat are what cause his back to flare up the most. He’s been shut down now for two weeks and said that his back already feels better.\n\n“But that’s how it was before,” Carter said. “Every time I started rotating, it started barking at me again. ... It’s like, ‘Hey, I know you’ve busted your butt for three weeks, but sorry, you’re done.’ Then you get back down and kind of get a glimpse of hope again and get shot back right down again. Yeah, it’s mentally exhausting.”\n\nCarter’s goal — with a “way longer” offseason than anyone else — is to be “more than ready to go” by spring training. He’s still working out to get “stronger in every way” and hopes to start swinging a bat again in 9-10 weeks.\n\nHe doesn’t anticipate any need for surgery.\n\n“Everyone is like ‘Oh crap, is there something wrong with his back?’ No, there’s just inflammation in there that we can’t get to go away,” Carter said. “That’s basically all it is.”\n\nCarter took swings, hit off of a machine and ran the bases at Globe Life Field pain free in late July and was considered a week or so behind third baseman Josh Jung, who returned to the Rangers’ lineup on Tuesday after a fractured wrist sidelined him for nearly four months. He said as recently as July 22 that “hopefully we’re close” to his major league return.\n\nBut, as Carter continued to ramp up, his back worsened. He had to pause one swing regiment halfway through — just three days after he’d expressed that optimism regarding his return — because the pain was so bad. He was evaluated by California-based orthopedic surgeon Dr. Robert Watkins last weekend, and a shutdown was determined as the best plan of action soon after.\n\n“Sore wasn’t the right word anymore,” Carter said. “It hurt again.”\n\nCarter slashed .188/.272/.361/.633 in 162 plate appearances and played in just 48 games this year. The Rangers “Little Savior” in last year’s postseason began the season as Texas’ starting left fielder and a co-favorite to win the American League Rookie of the Year award.\n\nThe once-promising campaign never got off the ground.\n\nHe’s finally had to accept that."
