        "text": "David has been involved in community-based mental health service development and delivery since 1976.\n\nHe has provided these services to very diverse population groups.\n\nFor 5 years he worked with truant, paint-sniffing youth and their families providing individual, group and family therapy wherever the individuals felt most comfortable. Many times there were more individuals who used drugs as a coping mechanism in the family which required teaching different skills to the entire family.\n\nHe assisted with the implementation of the State Case Management roll-out in Houston serving recidivists of the State Mental Health Hospitals to try and help them integrate back into the community system of care.\n\nHe has worked with youth returning from TDC who could not return home and helped them and their new foster families learn how to co-exist, deal with issues as\n\nthey came up and develop a plan for the youth to remain in the community.\n\nIn 1992 he returned to Austin and ATCMHMR, and worked as a family worker with the federally funded Family Preservation Program. He provided family therapy at\n\ntheir home as a way to help them develop family-specific tools to keep them\n\ntogether and provide for them a way to live more harmoniously.\n\nIn 1994 he began working specifically with individuals who are homeless with the\n\nPATH/ACCESS Program. He has worked and grown the Program to include a\n\nSafe Haven Program and to ensure that the agency play an integral part in the\n\nContinuum of Care in the Austin Travis County Community."
