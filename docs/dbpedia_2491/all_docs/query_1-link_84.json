        "text": "\"Days Gone Bye\"\n\nOutside his house, Rick Grimes sits on the steps. He spots a man stumbling down the road and waves his hand to try and get his attention. As he is doing this, Duane creeps up from behind and hits him with a shovel. \"Carl, I found you\", Rick mutters. \"Daddy I got this sumbitch! I'm gonna smack him dead!\" Duane screams. Morgan approaches the stumbling man Rick was waving to and shoots him in the head. He then proceeds to walk towards Rick and points a revolver in his face. \"What's that bandage for? You tell me, or I will kill you,\" Morgan asks him, cocking the gun at his face. Before he can answer, Rick passes out.\n\nLater that night, Rick wakes up with his arms and legs tied to a bed. The young boy, Duane, stands guard with a baseball bat. \"Did you get bit?\" Morgan asks Rick stiffly, having changed his bandages though Rick's gunshot wound that has mostly healed. \"Just shot, as far as I know,\" Rick says. Morgan checks his forehead and says if he had \"the fever\" it would have killed him by now, so he sets him free of the bedposts with a switchblade, but not before telling him that if he tries anything, he will not hesitate to kill him. He then offers him a seat at their dinner table.\n\nMorgan tells Rick not to look out the window because they will see the light. He then begins to explain the story of the outbreak and the following days to a confused and disoriented Rick. \"I never should have fired that gun today. The sound draws 'em. Now they're all over the street.\" Rick accuses Morgan of shooting a man in cold blood. \"It was a walker,\" Morgan corrects. He adds that they get more active after dark sometimes.\n\nBefore they begin eating dinner, Duane insists that his father give a blessing. \"Lord, please watch over us in these crazy days,\" Morgan says, and proceeds to explain to Rick that the man he shot would have tried to eat them. \"One thing I do know, don't you get bit. Bites kill. The fever burns you out. But then after a while... You come back.\" Morgan explains.\"Seen it happen,\" Duane adds solemnly.\n\nAfter dinner, the trio talk about Rick's son, Carl, and Rick satisfies a lingering curiosity shared by Duane and Morgan as to what line of work would put someone in a position to be shot at. \"Sheriff's deputy,\" Rick remarks. Morgan smiles and says, \"Duane thought you were a bank robber.\" Suddenly, a car alarm starts to go off outside and the trio turns off the lights.\n\nMorgan and Rick peer out to the street through heavy covered windows and boarded up doors. The street is filled with walkers, drawn by the noise of the alarm. As the zombified Jenny walks up to the front door of the house, Duane runs away crying. Morgan comforts his son while Rick stares at her through the peephole at the front door. \"She died in the other room on that bed. I should have put her down. I just didn't have it in me. She's the mother of my child.\" Morgan confesses with sorrow.\n\nThe next morning, Rick walks outside in a face shield, carrying a baseball bat. \"We're sure they're dead? I have to ask,\" says Rick, approaching a walker sitting near the stoop. \"They're dead. Except for something in the brain. That's why it's gotta be the head,\" Morgan assures him, exiting the house with Duane.\n\nRick approaches the walker and swings the bat repeatedly at his head, beating it down until it stops moving. He quickly becomes fatigued, most likely from his still-healing gunshot wound.\n\nBack at the house, Rick tells Morgan he thinks his wife and son are still alive. He explains he found empty drawers in the bedrooms and the family pictures and photo albums were gone. \"Photo albums. My wife, same thing. There I am packing survival gear; she's grabbing photo albums,\" Morgan laughs, getting emotional over the memory. Duane suggests to Rick that they could be in Atlanta. Morgan explains that the government was telling people to head to a refugee center there with military protection and food, before the broadcasts stopped. He also explains that the C.D.C. is rumored to be working on a cure.\n\nDuane, Morgan and Rick head to the King County Sheriff's Department, where they luxuriate in hot showers thanks to a separate propane heating system. Afterward, Rick packs a duffel bag with guns and changes into his sheriff's uniform and hat. He hands Morgan a rifle and some ammunition.\n\nThey head outside and start loading the weapons into the trunk of his cruiser. Rick prepares to set off for Atlanta, while Morgan says he'll follow in a few days, once Duane has learned to shoot. Rick hands Morgan a walkie-talkie and he tells him to turn it on every day at dawn to make contact. Before leaving, Morgan gives Rick a warning: \"They may not seem like much one at a time. But in a group, all riled up and hungry? Man, you watch your ass.\" However, the farewell is interrupted when Rick spots a reanimated Leon who claws at the chain link fence separating them. Rick admits he didn't think much of the young officer, but he won't leave him like this. He shoots him in the forehead with his revolver, putting him down. Then, he and Morgan drive away from the sheriff's department in opposite directions.\n\nBack home, Duane is covering the windows before dark. Morgan heads up to the attic carrying Rick's rifle he left him. He looks at old photo albums and pictures of his wife. Tearfully, he positions the rifle facing the street and begins shooting walkers. He commands Duane to stay downstairs when his son gets startled by the gunshots. \"Come on, baby,\" he says, hoping the noise will draw his wife into view. But when she appears, he breaks down, still unable to shoot her.\n\n\"King County\"\n\nMorgan returns to King County to put Duane down, explaining to Grace and Mo the story of his son's death at the hands of a zombified Jenny and admitting that he'd just left Duane to turn in the house where he'd died. However, Morgan struggles to just enter the house where he had left Duane. Despite being hunted by Dwight, Sherry, Oriole and a PADRE guard, Morgan insists upon pressing forward with his mission to lay Duane to rest. However, when he finally enters the house, he only finds Jenny's corpse and a walker, but no sign of Duane. A devastated Morgan concludes that Duane must've gotten out of the house a long time ago and he has lost his chance to lay his son to rest.\n\nIn the house where Morgan and Duane had lived in King County, Mo is forced to take cover in the attic by the herd outside and the house being on fire. In the attic, Mo finds a zombified Duane chained to the wall and gets trapped near her adoptive brother by a collapsing part of the celling. Rushing to his daughter's rescue, Morgan finds \"DUANE YOU STAY THERE\" written on the walls and Morgan is shocked to realize that he'd moved Duane to the house at some point and chained him up. Morgan hesitates to shoot Duane, remembering his son as he was when he was still alive. However, with Mo in danger and yelling encouragement to him, Morgan shoots Duane in the head with the gun that Rick Grimes had given him over a decade earlier, finally laying his son to rest.\n\nThe next morning, Morgan buries Jenny and Duane outside of the house and he promises to come back to visit and that he won't take 10 years this time. In the rubble, Mo finds Morgan's family photo album, filled with pictures of Jenny and Duane to help Morgan remember what his family was like when they were still alive.\n\n\"All I See Is Red\"\n\nDuane is one of the people whose loss continues to haunt Morgan, appearing in red-tinged flashes of his death to Morgan.\n\nLater, Morgan touches a kiss to Grace's grave and he has flashes of Eastman, Benjamin, Nick Clark, Isaac, Rachel, John Dorie, John Dorie Sr., Alicia Clark, Jenny, Duane and Grace, all of the people that he's cared about and lost along the way. This time, Morgan only sees fond memories of his loved ones without the red-tinge, at peace at last with those that he's lost."
