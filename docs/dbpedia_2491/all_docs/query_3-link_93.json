        "text": "Welcome to the Madera Unified School District. We are located in the geographic center of California in a growing community of 55,000. Our district serves 20,000 students and has 2,000 employees. We are guided by a powerful vision of Madera Unified setting the standard for hard work, creativity and resiliency with a fearless drive to continuously improve. From their first day of school, students are focused on learning the basics so that they can fulfill their career aspirations. As students turn toward high school, they choose a career path based on their interest, talent, and future goals. We envision a time when every child will have the skills and knowledge upon graduation so they can choose their future. Copyright Â© 2023. Blackboard Inc. All rights reserved. Terms of Use"
