He was an active faithful member of St. Olaf Lutheran Church, Faith and Care and the Menâ€™s Club. He also served on the Heritage Center Board. Duane was a Scout Master for many years, mentoring young Scouts and also as a mentor to young boys of the church and community. He always was supportive and encouraging to those under his leadership.\n\nDuane had many talents and interests including restoring old cars, which there were many, woodworking, giving his many beautiful and unique creations to children, grandchildren and friends. Duane was the greatest fan to his children and grandchildren as he watched them participate in their many sports and activities.
