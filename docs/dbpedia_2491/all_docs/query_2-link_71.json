        "text": "In 2013, renowned technology leader and philanthropist Duane Roth had his life cut tragically short in a cycling accident that left the entire San Diego region heartbroken.\n\nFor decades, Duane was seen as the visionary leader in San Diego who helped grow the innovation economy while building up everyone he came into contact with.\n\nMost known for his success as CEO of Connect and Vice Chair of the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine, Duane made a name for himself as a champion for San Diego’s innovation industry. Under his leadership at Connect, when the local science industry was at a tipping point, Duane helped scientists make the connections they needed to start groundbreaking companies and achieve breakthroughs. And while his career achievements were numerous, they made up only a fraction of his impact in the region.\n\n“After Duane passed away, our family was deeply moved by the reaction from the San Diego community,” recalled Ted Roth, Duane’s brother and best friend. “Countless people, many of whom we had never met, came up to us to share stories about how our brother impacted their lives.”\n\nA Legacy for One of Our Region’s Great Leaders\n\nSan Diegans from all industries described Duane as one of the region’s great leaders whose contributions expanded beyond the life sciences industry. He was a visionary leader who sparked growth, opportunity and prosperity for the economy and a caring man who connected with everyone he met on a deeper level.\n\nCo-founder of Qualcomm Irwin M. Jacobs shared that losing Duane meant the “loss of a friend that I enjoyed meeting with and talking to and exploring possibilities.” A former colleague of Duane’s at Alliance Pharmaceuticals, Pete Manspeaker, said his “personal touch and dedication to those who worked with him became evident to me on my first day on the job when he personally came down to my office to welcome me to the company.”\n\nThose kind words of leaders from just about every sector in the region were why Duane’s family and close friends decided to establish the Duane Roth Legacy Fund at San Diego Foundation after he passed away. They wanted a way to carry on the important work of a man who did so much good for the San Diego region.\n\n“While sad to have lost Duane, we were proud of the fact that we were able to do some good in the community under his name,” shared Ted.\n\nLife’s Purpose\n\nThe fund represented a lifetime of giving by Duane and his family.\n\nGrowing up as Mennonites in a small farming community in Iowa, Duane and his brothers were always taught by their parents to help others. While their family didn’t have much in the way of financial wealth, they were always there to lend a hand when needed.\n\nTed still remembers when his parents drove across the state to help fellow Iowans after tornadoes ripped through their towns.\n\nWhen the Roth children grew older and found success in their respective careers, that attitude of helping others remained a core tenet of their life’s purpose.\n\nDuane and the other Roth brothers would spend their free time giving back to the areas they cared about most. In fact, Ted recalled how he and Duane would coordinate their time so they could help as many causes as possible.\n\nThey served on boards and volunteered for numerous organizations, such as the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, UC San Diego, Rady Children’s Hospital, San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation, and the list goes on.\n\nDuane’s wife, Renee, and his brothers Ted, Gordon, and Byron have committed to continue their charitable impact through the Duane Roth Legacy Fund and their individual philanthropy. They also hope to see some of the fund’s future giving directed by their children to engage the next generation and carry on the family tradition of helping others.\n\nWhile the San Diego region misses Duane and his personal approach to business and community, his legacy lives on through the lives of the countless people he touched and his far-reaching philanthropic impact.\n\nGifts like Duane’s prove that giving back can last a lifetime and beyond. A legacy fund of any size can provide lasting benefits for you, your family and the causes and charities you care about most.\n\nIf you are considering ways to make an impact through a legacy fund, submit the form below to download our Guide to Building Your Charitable Legacy or contact our Donor Services team today.\n\nDownload the Charitable Legacy Guide\n\nThis valuable resource will help you understand how to set up a legacy fund and the lasting impact planned gifts can have for you, your family and your community.\n\n\"*\" indicates required fields\n\nName*\n\nFirst Last\n\nEmail*\n\nPhone*\n\nDo you live or work in San Diego County?*\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nWould you like to learn more about legacy funds?*\n\nPhone\n\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n\n79558\n\nAbout Grant Oliphant\n\nGrant Oliphant is CEO of the Conrad Prebys Foundation, a major independent foundation working to strengthen San Diego’s future through a focus on impact in the arts, medical research and care, youth development, and higher education. Previously, Grant was president of The Heinz Endowments in Pittsburgh, one of the nation’s largest regional philanthropies, where he focused the foundation’s giving on sustainability, creativity, and learning. He also launched major initiatives to support democracy, public media, and racial and social equity, and worked with his board to bring the foundation’s investments into alignment with its social and climate change priorities.\n\nPrior to joining Heinz, Grant was President & CEO of the Pittsburgh Foundation, one of the nation’s largest community foundations, where he doubled the foundation’s size while helping to reinvent the national model of community philanthropy through an emphasis on regional leadership and impact.

He is the immediate past chair of the Center for Effective Philanthropy, a national organization working to promote better giving, and chaired the Communications Network, which promotes better use of communications by philanthropy.\n\nDevoted to community leadership at the intersection of business, nonprofits and universities, Grant served on the boards of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, the August Wilson African-American Cultural Center and the Pittsburgh Promise, along with Grantmakers of Western Pennsylvania and Riverlife, both of which he chaired.

He is also the author of a novel, “Ring of Years.” Grant and his wife Aradhna, who have four grown children, are delighted to be making their home in Mission Hills and are looking forward to being active members of the San Diego community."
