        "text": "Northern Upholstery and Gertie Hetteen…in summary of the previous articles on the journey of Polaris’ First Lady Gertie Hetteen, we’d like to briefly reintroduce 1962 through 1969 briefly from what had transpired in the success of a small upholstery business started in the basement of the Gertie and Allan Hetteen’s home.\n\nDue to the public’s interest in enjoying the winter outdoors on a snowmobile, Polaris snowmobile sales increased. The snowmobile changed how Americans (and their neighbors to the North) saw the challenges and opportunities of winter. While it offered snowbound communities unprecedented opportunities to travel in winter, it also created a totally new kind of winter recreation.\n\nGertie, with her industrious employees were instrumental in establishing a successful start to the growing company!\n\nThe transition from the small family home basement to a larger shop, later moving to a modern production plant was not just a physical move, but a significant milestone in the company’s journey.\n\nHere is a quick look back at the very early years of 1962-1969.\n\nIn 1968, Polaris Industries introduced the first of the famed TX series of snowmobiles, a series that was to run for twelve years. The TX was built and bought for performance, power, speed, and for racing. Due to the increased speed of the high-performance sleds, the engineers from Polaris wanted a more cushioned seat to help ride the rough winter terrain. Thus, Gertie and the Northern Upholstery crew produced a six-inch-high soft seat helping to cushion the bumps as riders flew through the air on some of the cross-country races!\n\nNorthern Upholstery led by Gertie soon expanded into other divisions. With assistance from her husband, Allan, in obtaining credit from financial institutions and with his advice, the business grew. (As reported in a previous article during the 1960’s and 1970’s banks denied women credit. They were not allowed to open a bank account in their own names. Technically, women won the right to open an account in a financial institution in the 1960s, but yet women had to have their husband’s sign for them to open the account. In 1974, the female gender in the U.S. was finally granted the right to open a bank account in their own name.)\n\nWhen were women allowed to run a business?\n\nGertie employed a number of high school students for the summer months and part-time during the school year. These four part-time students eventually became long-term employees of Polaris Industries in their adulthood.\n\nCLICK ON EACH PHOTO TO FIND OUT WHO THEY ARE.\n\nOn June 1, 1970, Allan Hetteen retired from Polaris, a Textron Company. Textron Inc., an American industrial conglomerate located in Providence, Rhode Island, had purchased Polaris Industries in 1968. During Allan’s retirement negotiations with the Textron group it was the consensus he would continue to have ties with Polaris, thus the distributorship through mutual agreement was settled.\n\nFollowing Allan’s retirement from Polaris Industries, Allan became the owner and president of the Polaris distributorship, Rosco, Inc. in 1970.\n\nGertie and Allan determined Rosco, Inc. would become a tenant in the Northern Upholstery building.\n\nDue to the increase with all the new divisions added inventory, the need for an office plus a large warehouse for Rosco’s parts department, it became necessary for further expansion.\n\nThe Gallant Sportswear Division produced seasonal outerwear and was distributed by Rosco, Inc. The jackets featured a red, white, and blue stripe on the front side, a tribute to the colors of Polaris snowmobiles. The 1970-1971 Polaris Industries Factory Race Team and the Rosco Race Team wore suits designed by the Gallant Sportswear Collection Division. The photos below show the Polaris Team wearing windbreakers made for mild weather. The Rosco Race Team is wearing winter jackets.\n\nAllan was a proponent of utilizing a racing program to promoted the product. Allan formed the Rosco Race Team and directed the program from 1970 through the 1972 race season. At the start of the 1972-1973 race season, Allan offered an incentive program called “Racing for Gold” because the Rosco Race Team had dissolved. This program was available to dealers and independents drivers within the distributorship area ending in March 1973.\n\nThe Rosco Race Team Patch created by Gertie Hetteen.\n\nBecause the distributorship serviced a large demographic area, it became necessary for the race team to split up as three separate teams. There would usually be two drivers per team on some weekends. On other weekends, the entire team would travel and compete together. Participation at dealer sponsored races throughout the tri-state area included more than competing on the race track. The race team utilized their technical skills by demonstrating to the dealer or customer how to diagnose an unwelcomed issue, the use of the proper tools and equipment for repairs.\n\nAllan was an advocate of snowmobile safety. He believed his employees should practice safety measures and promote safety to the customers. The drivers knew the best representation of Rosco and the Polaris products were to set an example of good communication, teamwork, excellent customer service, problem-solving, plus performing 110% on the track!\n\nThe 1973 Oil Embargo severely weakened a U.S. economy that had grown increasingly dependent on foreign oil. The 1973 energy crisis, also known as the Oil Shock of 1973–74, was a period of escalating energy prices and fuel shortages caused by an embargo by Arab oil-producing nations in response to U.S. support for Israel during the Yom Kippur War.\n\nPolaris sold a record 30,000 snowmobiles during the 1970–71 season, but business declined sharply after that. The 1973 OPEC oil embargo and the ensuing energy crisis transformed snowmobiling into a luxury activity that many Americans could not afford. Sales plummeted. More than a dozen snowmobile manufacturers got out of the business. Polaris survived by cutting production and reducing its workforce.\n\nNorthern Upholstery and Rosco, Inc., were affected negatively as well. On March 15, 1973, Rosco, Inc., a Polaris distributor shut down.\n\nShe goes on to say, “We, of course, were devastated and had great difficulty resuming our lives in the days ahead. Tim was such a great part of our family and our only consolation was in knowing he was safe at home with his Lord. I can still see Timmy’s smile as he left for camp the night before hunting season opened. Thirteen short years we had all enjoyed him.”\n\nLosing a loved one can be incredibly difficult, both emotionally and logistically. The experience often comes suddenly and is certain to cause a flood of overwhelming emotions. Gertie experienced immense loss within a six-year span. Losing a child and then her husband, both unexpected, was devastating enough. Imagine having to deal with the responsibilities of retiring from a business built from an idea which grew into a large corporation and most importantly, raising three beloved sons on her own. Gertie did!\n\nThose who knew Gertie will remember and respect her gutsy attitude, her ability to overcome the cultural issues as a woman running a manufacturing company and the challenges which go with day-to-day operations, the economic uncertainty, and most of all, the personal tragedies. Gertie faced closure of the businesses she and her husband built together with grace and dignity. Her faith in God, support from her family, friends, and former employees enabled her through this process. Dale Amundson, the controller from the company worked with her on the financial obstacles. Long-time friends and employees, Lois and Adrian Larson provided support on many levels. Bob Carter was the legal advisor and her brother-in-law, Edgar Hetteen, became a partner with Amco, Inc. following his younger brother’s death.\n\nWorking to resolve details on legal matters and issues which arose when closing down the corporation, Gertie and Bob became friends which eventually led to their marriage. Gertie and Bob were married on June 3, 1975. They converted a hunting cabin into a permanent home in Beaver Township, south of Wannaska, Minnesota.\n\nAfter Bob Carter passed away at the age of 83 on September 6, 2000, Gertie continued living in their home south of Wannaska. She kept busy spending time with her family, friends and being active in her hobbies and numerous organizations.\n\nGertie, her friends/employees from the Northern Upholstery days enjoyed gathering at Gertie’s home. The two photos below show some of the ladies. The photo on the left was taken in 2001, the photo on the right in 1966.\n\nGertrude (Gertie) Hetteen Carter passed away at the age of 73 on January 23, 2004\n\nGertie lived her life with vitality and strength. God and her family were the most important in her life. She cared about her community and country. Through her efforts and support, Gertie made a difference in so many people’s lives with her motivation. Her commitment to building a business and initially hiring women had an impact on the northern Minnesota rural community.\n\nThe legacy and spirit live on through the second, third, and fourth generations of Allan and Gertie, all outdoor enthusiasts. Currently, several of the grandsons are involved with snowmobile racing. Alex and Devon, the sons of Donavon and Chris Hetteen, own and race for Hetteen Heritage Racing."
