        "text": "44a. Humphrey Newton and Ellen Fitton – finding my roots\n\nIn which we discover – at last – the effigies of Humphrey and Ellen in Wilmslow Parish church.\n\nAs noted in previous posts, Humphrey and Ellen were commemorated in carved effigies resting in the Jesus Chapel of Wilmslow’s St Bartholomew’s Church. For some time my bucket list had included a visit to view these effigies in person, and the opportunity arose in the summer of 2023.\n\nThe church itself is an imposing and impressive structure, much changed since the Newtons’ day, when it was undergoing its first transformation from its 13th century origins under the direction of then-rector Henry Trafford. The Trafford family endowed the private Jesus Chapel where the Newton and Fitton effigies are to be found.\n\nDeborah Youngs (Humphrey Newton (1466-1536) An Early Tudor Gentleman, The Boydell Press, 2008, pp 135-142) describes the effigies, placing them in the context of the Newtons’ status at the time. For instance, they are carved from sandstone, cheaper than alabaster, a more usual stone. And the effigies lie under a wall canopy which was probably recycled from the previous church, as were the carvings underneath the effigies. The Newtons were unlikely to have had the resources for freestanding tombs. Humphrey is clothed in a fur-lined civilian robe, relatively unusual at the time, when most effigies represented their subjects in military or ecclesiastical garb. Traces of red and black paint can still be seen. Ellen Fitton, represented as a widow, is simply dressed but, in recognition of her status as an heiress, lies closer to the east end and the altar than Humphrey, her head resting on a wheatsheaf, the symbol of the Fitton family. Neither effigy is meant to be a realistic representation of the subject.\n\nThe two effigies lie beneath a window inviting prayers for Humphrey and Ellen, and setting out in some detail her Fitton ancestry. The images below show first, Humphrey and Ellen, then Humphrey, then Ellen, and then the window inviting prayers for them, showing her more distinguished descent.\n\nIt felt an astonishing privilege to stand right next to these nearly-600-year-old artefacts of my ancestry.\n\n6h. Descendants of Ann Backler and John Freeman: Pack, Grant, Grant-Ives, de Clanay Rennick, Grasby, Shore, Clarke, Hurle, Robinson…\n\nIn which we finally reach the last offspring of Mary Freeman and Richard Pack, and, with them, the end of this lengthy exploration of the Ann Backler/John Freeman line. This post rather variably, and somewhat arbitrarily, explores only fragments of later generations, particularly of the Shore line. There are simply too many of them, and I have run out of steam!\n\nOn reflection, before I tackle yet another large, extended couple of families, I note how very different the Ann Backler line is from that of her brother Sotherton Backler (1746-1819) of the Society of Apothecaries. I have not managed definitively to identify the fate of Ann’s other surviving sibling, Elizabeth Backler (1748/9 – ). As described in earlier posts, Ann’s husband John Freeman (1740-1803) had come to London from Northamptonshire, where he had been part of a very large and tangled web of families. Ann and John’s children and grandchildren inhabited a world of universities, military, clergy, the law and landed proprietors, very different from the artisans, artists and, for females, low-key lives of her brother’s family back in London. Apart from the youngest Sotherton-child, Rev Sotherton Backler (1798-1875), there seems little to link these two branches of this mid-18th century Backler line. And so, this series of posts has been a journey into modest and perhaps more grand stately homes, offspring of clergy marrying clergy, and pages of Burke’s Family Records (Shore, Cooke-Hurle and more) on Ancestry’s website. This post exemplifies all those trends. It seems a world away from ‘my’ Backler line descended from Ann’s nephew Samuel Backler (1784-1870) and his siblings.\n\nIn the previous post we looked at two branches descended from Mary Freeman and Richard Pack. Here we look at two more lines, but we also note in the tree below that Mary and Richard had several more children who died in infancy or at a young age. I have just identified these in updating my data for this post, so this diagram differs from that in the previous post. Thus does family history continually evolve. First- and second-born infants both named Richard Kerby Pack died soon after birth. And later on, Ellen Pack (1813-1832) died at Flore aged 18, and Edward Lewis Pack was born and died in 1814. Clearly this otherwise prosperous family did not always have an easy time.\n\nMoving on from where we left off in the last post, we meet Frances Simpson Pack (1811-1905) who married Barrister William Grant (1806-1868) at St George’s Hanover Square in 1842. By the time of the 1851 Census the family were living in Litchborough, Northamptonshire, where he was a land owner of 200 acres. Noting that his sons were said to be of ‘Litchborough Hall’, I found an English Heritage listing of that property, noting that it had been extensively renovated for William Grant in 1838, just a few years before his marriage to Frances. In 1861 he was described as a Magistrate and Barrister – not in practice. He died aged just 42, and by 1871, Frances was still living in Litchborough, but now with son Arthur W Grant, MA, Barrister and graduate of Brasenose College, as Head, and also with daughter Edith and youngest child, Charles E., an undergraduate at King’s College, Cambridge. By 1901 Frances was living on her own in Leamington Priors, Warwickshire and at her death in 1905, she left some £17,000 in the care of her three surviving sons, executors, her daughter Edith Frances having pre-deceased her by a year.\n\nSome of the Grant family acquired the name of Grant-Ives, following the death of their relative Elizabeth Ives, spinster sister of Cornelius Ives, the Rector of Bradden. Use of the Ives surname and title to Bradden House, was granted by her in 1888 to Wilfred Dryden Grant, whose older brother was already lord at Litchborough Hall. On Wilfred’s death in 1919, the name passed by Royal licence to his brother Charles Eustace, as shown in the London Gazette, below. A search on ‘Grant-Ives’ brings up images of the various coats of arms adopted by different branches of the family.\n\nLondon Gazette 21 November 1919 Whitehall, August 23, 1919. The KING has been pleased to grant unto Charles Eustace Grant, of Bradden House, in the parish of Bradden, in the county of Northampton, Gentleman, Master of Arts of the University of Cambridge, and a Fellow of King’s College in the said University, His Royal Licence and Authority that he and his issue may, in compliance with a clause contained in the last will and testament of Elizabeth Ives, late of Bradden House aforesaid, Spinster, deceased, take and henceforth use the surname of Ives in addition and after that of Grant, and that he, and they may bear the arms of Ives quarterly with those of his and their own family, the said arms being first duly exemplified according to the Laws of Arms, and recorded in the College of Arms, otherwise the said Royal Licence.and Permission to be void and of none effect: And to command that the said Royal concession and declaration be recorded in His Majesty’s said College of Arms.\n\nOf Frances’ first two children, Arthur William Grant (1842-1878) and Edith Frances Grant (1844-1904) there is little to say. Oldest surviving son, Edward Grant (1848-1910) of Lichborough (sometimes with a ‘t’) Hall and his wife Edith Helen Hulton (1859-1926) (daughter of the Rev Hulton), had three daughters, two of whom married, one to the exotically named Alexander de Clanay Rennick (1878-1949) (a Lt-Col in the Indian Army, later of Litchborough Hall). When their son was an adult he was styled Capt Richard de Clanay Grant-Rennick (1923-2004), perhaps acquiring the Grant name to preserve that Coat of Arms and the Litchborough title. These families are all easily traceable online and I will take them no further.\n\nAs noted above, Wilfred Dryden Grant-Ives (1854-1919) was diverted from his occupation of educator and tutor when he became the Lord of the Manor of Bradden in 1888. He devoted his life to public service, serving as JP and on various councils, as well as being a noted agriculturist and hunter. A rather harrowing report in the Northampton Mercury on 14 March 1919 of the inquest into his death reports that following a serious motor accident involving himself and his wife in 1918, he had become ‘not himself’ and very reclusive. His family had become very concerned about his welfare and had requested the attendance of health personnel, but on perceiving this, Wilfred had climbed out of his bedroom window onto the roof, from which he fell, his injuries resulting in his death, which was deemed accidental. A sad tale, indeed.\n\nWilfred and his wife Fanny Louisa Millington (1860-1951) had six daughters. An announcement of the engagement of the oldest daughter, Winifred Frances Grant-Ives (1883-1972) to Mr Gerard Arthur Kennaway, son of the Rev Kennaway in nearby Towcester, appeared in The Morning Post on 14 July 1906. However, no marriage record is in evidence, and she next appears in public records returning to England from Spain in 1916, apparently the wife of someone completely different, Charles Egbert Reynolds Sams (1877-1968), a mining engineer, with three children. The next public record is of their marriage in 1925. It’s not clear what all that means!\n\nWinifred’s youngest sister, Kathleen Beatrice Grant-Ives (1896-1976) married William Wright Grasby (1864-1939), veterinary surgeon (his second wife) in 1922. They had 7 sons before his death in 1939, and then a daughter was born named Diana Kathleen Grasby (1941-2005) in May 1941, two years after William’s death – it’s not clear who the father was. Interestingly, both Kathleen and Diana then became very well known for breeding ponies, including many who performed in pantomimes and at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden!\n\nCharles Eustace Grant (1851-1930), later Grant-Ives, as above, succeeded his brother Wilfred as Lord of the Manor. He married Madeline Isabel Whitting (1863-1949), daughter of a solicitor and niece of the Bursar of King’s College Cambridge, a post which her husband would later hold until his retirement to Bradden. They had five children. Charles and his son John Charles Grant-Ives (1889-1959) were ‘of Bradden House, Bradden Northamptonshire’. In 1933 John Charles was granted a divorce from his wife Amy (Whiteside Shaw) – I cannot see a marriage for them, possibly it was in Scotland – and custody of their three children, John Edward, Elizabeth M and Joy. She immediately married the co-respondent, Frank Boughton, and in 1948 John Charles married Dorothy M Hemsted, or Chance.\n\nIsabel Frances Grant-Ives (1891-1976) married Colin Fish (1888 – 1969) in 1921 and their daughter Joan H Fish was born in 1922. Ursula Grant-Ives (1892-1984), twin to Agnes below, was single all her life and died in Wilmslow, Cheshire, leaving some £76,800. She was buried in Bradden with other members of the family. Her twin, Agnes Grant-Ives (1892-1943) married geologist George M Davies (1885-1973) in 1922, his second wife.\n\nThere are plenty more Grant-Ives descendants of the above folk, but I will leave them there, and move on to the last of Mary Pack’s children with descendants, Elizabeth Pack (1816-1856) and her husband John Henry Shore – another tree is needed!\n\nFinally, we have the children of Elizabeth Pack (1816-1856) and her landed-proprietor husband John Henry Shore (1819-1878) of Whatley in Somerset. Astute readers will note that this diagram has only their four children, in light of the resulting some 28 grandchildren, which really is a step too far! Elizabeth’s husband came from a long-established family of Shores, chronicled in Burke’s Family Records on Ancestry. His father, John Albin Shore (1775-1835), had married Mary Ann Hurle, so that when John Henry Shore Jr’s (1851- 1932) second child, Bertha Josephine Agnes Shore (1872-1958), married Captain William Armitage Cooke-Hurle, R.N. (1875-1920), they were probably related in some way I haven’t got the energy to pursue. John Henry Jr and his wife Charlotte Saunders Hill ( -1900) had three daughters and eight sons, seven of whom survived to adulthood. I have found an online post which summarises some of the sons’ histories and military exploits at https://grandadswar.co.uk/capt-j-l-shore/ I have traced the outlines of their lives for my own database, but will not undertake to write them up here. I would be happy to discuss further if any reader so desires. I think John Henry Jr married twice more.\n\nAlice Mary Shore (1853-1925) married Rev William Wynn Lloyd (1844 – 1925), they producing five daughters, three of whom did not marry, and one son, Meredydd Wynn Lloyd (1887-1967), who served in the Australian Army in WW1 and later married a French woman in Egypt.\n\nEllen Florence Shore (1855-1932) married Rev James Alfred William Wadmore (1851-1918), they having two sons and three daughters.\n\nLizzie Agnes Shore (1856-1933) married solicitor Charles Henry Clarke (1841-1914), the son of a solicitor and his wife, Mary Hurle Clarke, the Hurle name appearing again in this family. One son, Arthur Henry Gilbert Clarke (1891-May 1916) died at High Wood in France. His early death contrasted with the career of his older brother, Major Dr Richard Christopher Clarke, RAMC, OBE whose death in 1957 in Bristol was attended by some 300 mourners, including many from the various families mentioned above, and remembering, among other things, his role as Honorary Curator of Bristol Zoo. He had served in WW1 as a medical officer. It seems youngest brother Aubrey Martin Clarke (1889-1957) also served in WW1, but then spent at least a number of years in Ceylon with his wife Evelyn Robinson (1890-1962), first cousin of Foster Gotch Robinson (1880-1967), noted cricketer, horse trainer and paper manufacturer (see his entry in wikipedia), who married in 1908 Aubrey’s sister, Marguerite Victoria Mary Robinson (1887-1963). The Robinson family were noted philanthropists in Bristol.\n\nThe very last child of Mary Freeman and Richard Pack was the unmarried son, Lewis Pack (1818-1875). Educated at Balliol College, Oxford, he is designated simply as Landowner in the 1861 Census at Southfield House, Whatley, Somerset, the home of his brother-in-law Richard Barnardiston Yates. Similarly, in the 1871 Census he is again a Landowner at the rather grand Whatley House, again in Whatley, Somerset, the home of his brother-in-law John Henry Shore. He died in 1875 and is buried in Whatley.\n\nAnd so endeth the tale of the Freeman/Backler line, admittedly very selective and incomplete in this post. I had no idea when I embarked on this line some 18 months ago that it would be so enormous, albeit always interesting. It feels good to have explored it, however genetically distant from me is the resulting cast of characters. When all is said and done, they are my Backler cousins!\n\nWith some relief, I will in due course revert to the Pellatt/Rivers/Newton line!\n\n6g. Descendants of Ann Backler and John Freeman: Pack, Miller, Barnardiston Yates, Crowther-Beynon, Towers, Brown\n\nIn which we tackle the family of Mary Freeman (1781-1859), youngest child of John Freeman and Ann Backler and her wealthy husband Richard Pack (1738-1868). – a quick summary of the Pack line and of two of the families descended from Richard and Mary, with a preponderance of Revs and Landed Proprietors!\n\nMary Freeman (1781-1859) was the youngest child of Ann Backler and John Freeman, and possibly the most-favourably-married. On 18 March 1802 she married Richard Pack (1768-1838) at Bridewell Chapel in the City of London. He was the son of Christopher Pack (1735-1789), of Lewis & Pack, Oil and Salt Merchants, and Ann Kirby (1730-1785) of Northampton and, rather fortuitously, sister to Richard Kirby (or Kerby), owner of Flore House in Northamptonshire (search it on Wikipedia). Richard left the property to his sister Mary in her lifetime, and then to his nephew, Richard Pack, who went on to become Sheriff of Northamptonshire in 1830. Richard Pack pre-deceased Mary in 1838. In 1841 she is found in Tunbridge Wells with her three surviving younger children, and living adjacent to the widowed Giles Miller, whose brief story we looked at above. Just at the moment I cannot find Mary in the 1851 Census. I think I have spied her there with family members but I could be wrong. In any case, she died in Somerset where her Shore family lived (see next post) in 1859. Presumably she had had to leave Flore on the death of her husband.\n\nRichard and Mary had seven children, as can be seen above. For simplicity’s sake I will look in this post at the first three of these.\n\nAnn Augusta Pack (1805-1837) married Giles Miller (1797-1853) of Goudhurst in Kent at Flore on 20 May 1830. Witnesses were Richard and Mary Pack. But tragedy was to strike this couple. They had one son, Edward Lewis Miller (1831-1846). A newspaper search on his name yields: ‘deeply lamented, being killed by a fall from the cliffs at Freshwater, in the Isle of Wight, Edward Lewis Miller, only child of G. Miller Esq., of Goudhurst, aged 15’. His remains, and those of his parents, are interred in a vault in the churchyard of Goudhurst Church.\n\nJohn Christopher Pack (1807-1879) inherited the Flore estate on his father’s death in 1838, but apparently never lived there. He is found in successive censuses in London as a Landed Proprietor, and died at Whatley House in Frome, Somerset, the home of his brother-in-law, John Henry Shore (see next Post, when it appears!). Flore House was sold at the time of John Christopher’s death.\n\nMary Pack (1810-1898) married Richard Barnadiston Yates (1801-1883) on 10 February 1835. Here life becomes quite complicated. We encounter two families with double-barreled names, two of Mary Pack’s three children marrying sibling cousins, and a grandchild marrying another cousin – maybe a second cousin? My head is spinning. The tree above shows the wider family of Mary Freeman and Richard Pack, showing the children and grandchildren of their daughter Mary. But the diagram below, starting with the Rev Richard William Yates and his wife Hester Barnardiston, is needed to show the various cousinly marriages and the second double-barreled name. Where to start? The surnames of relevance become Barnardiston Yates/Pack; Barnardiston Yates/Crowther, later to become Crowther-Beynon, and Barnardiston Yates/Towers.\n\nMary Pack (1810-1898) married Captain Richard Barnardiston Yates (1801-1883) in Churchover, Warwicks in 1835. He was the son of the Rev Richard William Yates (1761-1805), himself the son of Rev Richard Sutton Yates. The double name seems to have arisen from the Rev Richard William Yates’ marriage to Hester Barnardiston (1763-1843), only child of the Rev Dr John Barnardiston (1719-1778), master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Mary and Richard had three children, as can be seen above: Ellen Flora, Adeline Mary and Gertrude Ann. Careful scrutiny of the tree above shows that Hester Barnardiston Yates (1796-1866), sister of the above Richard, married Rev (yes, another one) Samuel Crowther (1802-1880). They had two children, Rev Samuel Bryan Crowther (later Crowther-Beynon) and Richard William Barnardiston Crowther-Beynon, whom we will consider below. The birth date for Hester above shows 1787, which on reflection was a bit old for the children. a parish record search just now shows that the 1787 Hester died a day after birth. Her namesake was born in 1796.\n\nOldest daughter of Mary Pack and Richard Barnardiston Yates, Ellen Flora Barnardiston Yates (1834-1922), married the widowed and much older Rev Frederick Hopkins in 1887, when she was about 50. He died in 1907, and she died in 1922, one of her executors was a Crowther-Beynon nephew (see below). Nothing more relevant to this story!\n\nSecond daughter Adeline Mary Barnardiston Yates (1837-1918) was baptised at Flore, though the family were then living in Derbyshire. She was the second wife, married in 1869, of her cousin, widowed Richard William Barnardiston Crowther-Beynon, Captain Royal Scots 1st Regiment of Foot, who, alas, died in March 1878 aboard the troopship ‘Crocodile’ off the coast of Aden. Their daughter, Hester Mary Crowther-Beynon was christened in August that year, but died in 1879. Subsequent censuses show Adeline living in Worthing, Sussex, on private means with a small coterie of servants, until the 1911 Census finds her as a patient in the House of the Holy Road in Worthing, where she died in 1918. Available records do not show links with family, other than that her Will also cites as executor her nephew, Vernon Bryan Crowther-Beynon.\n\nGertrude Anne Barnardiston Yates (1838-1936), married in 1864 the older brother of the above Richard William, Rev. Samuel Bryan Crowther, M.A ., of Slines Oaks, who was Consular Chaplain at Christiana, Norway (later Oslo) from 1864-75, where their three children were born. Later on he would become Vicar of Lodsworth in Sussex, before ending his days in Beckenham, Kent. Although his father was the Rev Samuel Crowther, the name Beynon was the surname of Samuel’s maternal grandmother. For some reason it was the younger son (Richard William, above), who carried the name Crowther-Beynon. According to the Surrey Coats of Arms website, his older brother Rev Samuel Bryan, adopted the double-barreled name after Richard William’s death. So his and Gertrude Anne’s children came equipped with the Crowther-Beynon name in later life, though baptised just Crowther.\n\nFirst up was Gunhilda Mary Crowther (1864-1887), who lived with her family after their return to England, until her marriage in January 1887 to William Towers Brown (1859-1887), her perhaps second cousin, son of Rev Joseph Thomas Brown, himself the son of Emma Towers, daughter of Emma Barnardiston Yates (1794-1867), sister of Richard Barnardiston Yates. But this churchly and cousinly marriage was to end in a very sad tragedy. At Easter time in April 1887, the couple set off on their wedding journey to Paris on the cross channel packet steamship Victoria. Early in the morning of 13 April, in dense fog, the steamship ran aground off the coast of Dieppe. There were some 90 passengers on board, and some 40 crew, but no record of the names of passengers. It subsequently transpired that as one of the lifeboats was lowered, it overturned, and among others, Gunhilda was cast adrift, whereupon her new husband flung himself into the water to rescue her. Both drowned, and their bodies were only recovered down the coast some six weeks later, identified by watches, rings and other articles on the bodies. A tragic funeral was held at Wokingham at the end of May, attended by very many clergy, members of Towers, Yates and Crowther-Beynon families and many more. What a sad story. I have not traced the fortunes of the three other Brown children.\n\nSecond child was Vernon Bryan Crowther aka Crowther-Beynon (1865-1941) He doesn’t feature hugely in this tale of Packs and Yates’s, so I will just say that he trained as a barrister-at-law, and was also a very well regarded antiquarian and numismatist, who can be searched online. His wife, Mary Giffard, was the daughter of another Rev – Frederick Walter Giffard.\n\nThird child, Margaret Hester Crowther (1874-1912) appears to have lived her whole life with her parents. Just before her death in 1912, she is found with her widowed mother, Gertrude, in a 16-room house in Beckenham Kent, said to be ‘dependent on Head’. Was she infirm in some way? Her mother Gertrude died at the same address in December 1936, leaving some £42,000 in the care of her brother Vernon as Executor.\n\nHaving now completed our quick survey of the first three of Mary Freeman and Richard Pack’s children, we will leave them and turn our sights to the next post (coming very soon, I hope – it is snowing outside…) where we will look at their four younger children. Many more landed proprietors! Not sure about Revs.\n\n6f. Descendants of Ann Backler and John Freeman (2): Philpot, Mackintosh, Bouverie Pusey, Hawker and many more\n\nIn which we look at the very many descendants of Ann Backler and John Freeman, this time the family of their fifth child, Thomas Freeman (1779-1853) and his wife Frances PHILPOT (1782 – 1857 ). We find Clergy, Royal Navy Commanders, and a very unusual marriage register record. This is quite a long post – this line of Backler descendants had very large families and I have decided to keep each family group together. I am finding it quite challenging!\n\nThis outline tree shows that Thomas Freeman and his wife Frances Philpot had seven known children. Given the gaps in latter years, it seems there could have been more. Thomas had been made Free of the Ironmongers Company in 1800, by patrimony of his Father John Freeman and just three years before John Freeman’s death in 1803, whose Will was proved in August and September 1803. On the 30th of December that year, the marriage took place between Thomas, the eldest son, and Frances Philpot. Details in a church already very familiar to Backlers, were as follows:\n\nSt Andrew by the Wardrobe. Thomas Freeman Esqr a Batchelor [sic] of the Parish of St Ann Blackfriars and Frances Philpot Spinster of the Parish of St George the Martyr in the County of Middlesex by License this Thirtieth Day of December [1803].\n\nBride and Groom both signed, along with an array of family members as witnesses: John Philpot (likely Frances’ father); Ann [Backler] Freeman (1741-1820) (Thomas’ recently widowed mother); Mary Gough (1769-1841) (John Freeman’s niece, who looked after his wife Ann [Backler] Freeman in her later years); S[otherton] Backler (1746-1819) (Ann Freeman’s brother, my 4x g. grandfather); [?] Freeman; Elizabeth Philpot (Frances’ sister).\n\nThomas Freeman (1779-1853) and Frances Philpot (1782-1857): We know relatively little about Thomas and Frances. Their first four children were born in Woodford, Essex, where Thomas left property in his Will written in 1840. Sarah was christened in Lyme Regis, Dorset, where her father was said to be ‘of London, but resident in Lyme’. Francis and Charles were born in Tooting, Surrey. At some point the family then lived in Dorking, Surrey, where Thomas had a vault created at the church in nearby Wotton, on the deaths of their two daughters, Margaret Ann and Sarah. Latterly they lived in Brighton, where the 1851 Census finds Thomas, a retired merchant, Frances, daughter Elizabeth Ann and son Francis; also Mary [Freeman] Pack (Thomas’ younger sister – see forthcoming post), her son Lewis Pack, and eight servants. In his Will drafted in 1840, Thomas left £15,000 each to his sons plus other legacies. He was clearly very well off, but the detail of the very lengthy and difficult-to-read will leaves me disinclined to research further detail. Thomas died in 1853, followed by Frances in 1857. Both were interred with their two daughters at St John the Evangelist Wotton. Children:\n\nMargaret Ann Freeman (1806-1838) Nothing known other than birth and death dates and interment in Wotton, Surrey.\n\nRev Thomas Freeman (1806-1855) Born Woodford, Essex. Educated at Oxford University BA 1830, MA 1834. Married Eleanora Sophia Mackintosh (1805 – 1890 ) on 14 September 1841 in Inverness, Scotland. Thomas died in Madeira in 1855. His wife can be found in the 1861 Census (Somerset) and 1871 (London), both times with their daughter. Eleanora’s death was registered in 1890.\n\nThomas Arthur Freeman (1844-1900). Born London Marylebone, baptised at St Mary Bryanston Square by uncle (see below) W Bouverie Pusey. Educated at Oxford University Christchurch, BA 1865, MA 1868. Married first 1871 in Southampton to Loretta (Lauretta) Dowson, who died in the December quarter of 1873, as did their son Charles Thomas Freeman (1873-1873), born in the same quarter. Thomas Arthur married again in 1875 in Jhansi, Bengal, India, to Annie Matilda (aka Matilda Annie) Cave, daughter of a Colonel. Thomas Arthur Freeman was a Lieutenant in the 70th Regiment of Foot. He died in India on 20 February 1900, then a missionary for the Church Missionary Society, having been a Lieut Col in the East Surrey Regiment.\n\nTheir daughter Helen Matilda Freeman (1877-1950) married Sir Henry Edward Edleston Procter and they had three known children:\n\nMargaret Helen Procter (1899-1980) married first Guy Nicholas Vansittart with whom she had son Arnold Mark Vansittart in 1927 before they were divorced. In 1936 she married Geoffrey Dearmer, with no known children.\n\nArthur Francis Procter (1902-1970) married Adria Margaret Acland in 1935. Their two children were Nigel Henry Procter (1937-1968)(see below) and [possibly living]\n\nKatharine Joyce Procter (1909-1980) married Arnold H Piggott in 1934.\n\nFrances Helen Freeman (1845 – ) Appeared in 1871 and 1881 Censuses with her mother, first in Somerset and then on Belgrave Road in London. She appears in 1903 as executrix to her mother’s sister’s will, and then in 1909 to her uncle Francis Freeman’s Will (see below). In 1929 and 1932 she is seen as a missionary, departing England for Algeria. Her London address on both occasions was given as 36 Princes Gardens, South Kensington.\n\nA sad death: As shown above, Nigel Henry Procter died aged 21. A Coroner’s report describes how he went out hunting with his rifle on the family estate of Eastwick Manor, Hertfordshire, and was found dead with the rifle and a dead pigeon by his side and a bullet wound to the head. The Coroner adjudicated accidental death. (Hertford Mercury and Informer, 17 October 1958)\n\nCatherine Freeman (1810-1873) married Rev. William Bouverie Pusey ( (1810-1888) in Richmond, Surrey. The picture is a transcript by me of the page in the parish register of Richmond Church, describing a rather unusual set of circumstances in recording the marriage.\n\nA unique marriage record: Richmond, Surrey, St Mary Magadelene, 1813-1837.Marriages Solemnized in the Parish of Richmond in the County of Surrey in the Year 1836 William Bouverie Pusey of the Parish of Holton in the County of Oxford, Bachelor, and Catherine Freeman of this Parish Spinster were married in this Church with Consent of by License this on the Seventh day of June in the Year One thousand eight hundred and thirty six by me Edward Bouverie Pusey, Officiating Minister [William’s brother]. This marriage was solemnized between us William Bouverie Pusey and Catherine Freeman in the Presence of Henry Raymond Barker, Margaret Anne Freeman, Elizabeth Broadwood, John Philpot. So far so good. However, perhaps not immediately obvious, the entire record, on the standard marriage form of the time, is written in the same hand. And, although the right-hand page of the two-page spread contains the standard three marriages, the left-hand page diverges from that. Also to be noted are two crossings out – ‘by me’ and the ‘us’ of ‘between us’. The explanation is as follows: In the same hand as the text above, with all the printed words for what should have been the second marriage record crossed out, we read:The Entry made by me above contains of the Parish particulars authenticated by the document pasted in below, the said document being Signed by all the Parties thereto in their were married in this own handwriting respectively with Consent of as the Law requires at the this celebration Day of of Marriages in the Year One thousand eight hundred and Dr. Pusey by Me Professor of Hebrew at Oxford This Marriage was solemnized between us officiated at this marriage by my permission and the key of the iron Chest in which this book was, being broken in the Lock, and the In the Presence of Parties not being able to stay until the Register could be procured, Dr. Pusey and the other subscribing Parties of executed the Parish document placed below. The truth of all the particulars stated above is attested of by me Parish Samuel Whitlocke Gandy Vicar of Richmond. Below this statement is a delightfully scrappy rendering of the first italicised text above, complete with individual signatures. To the right of the text on the pasted-in piece of paper are drawn two right-angle lines of a square, the resulting space below stating:This memorandum was made by me, the key of the box, wherein the Register was kept, being broken in it, and the Register not being to be obtained [sic]. EB Pusey June 7 1836. At the bottom of the pasted-in scrap is written: NB. This is the document referred to above. Saml W Gandy\n\nFurther investigation of the distinctively-named Bouverie-Puseys reveals that William and Edward’s father Philip Bouverie had taken the name ‘Pusey’ when inheriting the Pusey family’s estates in the village of Pusey in Berkshire. William Bouverie Pusey (1810-1888), who married Catherine Freeman (1810-1873), as above, was for many years Rector of Langley in Kent. His brother Edward Bouverie Pusey (1800-1882) was, as stated above, Professor of Hebrew at Oxford and canon of Christ Church. During his student years at Oxford he began to take an interest in theological matters, then spending two years pursuing these interests in Germany. On returning to England, he was appointed to his professorship in 1825 by the Duke of Wellington, then Prime Minister. After that he engaged in many years of theological controversy, which I fail to understand, but which can be followed in his many-paged Dictionary of National Biography entry, viewed on Ancestry, or in many various entries which come up via a search on his name. (Citation details: Surrey History Centre; Woking, Surrey, England; Surrey Church of England Parish Registers; Reference Number P7/1/9. Seen on Ancestry.co.uk )\n\nAnd so, after their marriage was recorded in unusual fashion due to the malfunctioning key to the lock of the parish chest, Catherine Freeman and William Bouverie Pusey went on to have four children:\n\nCatherine Freeman and William Bouverie Pusey\n\nHenry Bouverie Pusey (1837-1869) His notice of probate describes him as ‘formerly a Lieutenant in Her Majesty’s 76th Regiment … a Bachelor … who died on or since 13 May 1869 at sea …’, with letters of administration granted to his Father.\n\nEdward Bouverie Pusey (1838-1921) married Esther Eliot Cox Hales (1847-1927) in Colchester, Essex. The 1881 Census shows Edward in Constantinople, Commander R.N. of the ship “Bittern”, a gun vessel with 3 guns. By 1891 he was retired, living in Paddington, London. He died in Bournemouth in 1921. He and Esther had four children:\n\nCatherine Louisa Bouverie Pusey (1872-1942) married John Bowyer Buchanan Nichols (1859-1939), an artist and poet. See Wikipedia entry. Among their children were:\n\nRobert Nichols (1893-1944) poet (esp. of the Great War) and playwright. Married Norah Denny. See entry in Wikipedia.\n\nSir Philip Bouverie Nichols, KCMG (1894- 1962 ) Diplomat, married Phyllis Mary Spender-Clay in Surrey in 1922. Among the witnesses were ‘Astor’ – she was the grand daughter of William Waldorf Astor – 1st Lord Astor. Sir Philip’s biography can be found on Wikipedia, which reports that the couple had two daughters and two sons.\n\nIrene Nichols (1896-1977) married George Henry Gater\n\nAnn Sadelbia Mary Nichols (1902 – ), Sculptress, married Henry George Strauss, M.P., then Lord Conesford.\n\nEdward Bouverie Pusey (1873-1958) married as retired army officer in 1914 in Sydney NSW, to Lilian Evelyn Ryan, daughter of a civil servant there. The couple are found in Hove, Sussex in 1939, and Lilian is recorded as dying in 1957. Edward died in 1958, his probate record showing probate granted to Widow Ursula Winchester [nee Lind] Bouverie Pusey, a marriage record for the couple having been recorded in the June quarter of that year! She died aged 87 in 1972.\n\nEthel Mary Bouverie Pusey (1876-1955) married Hon. Adrian Verney Cave (1874-1952) (later Lord Braye, who died en route to the funeral of King George VI). They had three children:\n\nThomas Adrian (‘Lord Braye’ 1902-1985) RAF and Royal Hussars. Married Dorothea Donoghue (1906-1994) of Philadelphia, one daughter:\n\nMary Penelope Verney-Cave, Baroness Braye of Stanford Hall, Near Lutterworth, Leicestershire, married to Edward Henry Lancelot Aubrey-Fletcher. She served a number of years as a Conservative member of the House of Lords until she became one of 653 hereditary peers excluded from the Lords after the House of Lords Act 1999.\n\nAmbrose Verney-Cave (1906-1988)\n\nLucy Verney-Cave (1905-1980) married Lucien Falkiner who died in the 2nd World War.\n\nLucy Bouverie Pusey (1888-1966) married Cmdr. Henry Maclean Fothergill (1882-1963) in 1920, one son known of:\n\nCmdr. Christopher Henry Fothergill R.N. (1921-2014) married Linda K Browne in 1965.\n\nWilliam Bouverie Pusey (1840 – ). nothing known.\n\nFrances Mary Pusey (1845-1911). Little known. ‘Living on own means’ in successive censuses.\n\nElizabeth Ann Freeman (1812-1891) Died unmarried at Aylesbury Villa, Hove, Sussex. A record in Ancestry’s Records of the Removal of Graves and Tombstones notes that she founded in 1855 the Brighton Home for Convalescent Children. Among other bequests she bequeathed £2,000 to Helen Mathilda Freeman and left a bequest to the Home for Invalid Children, which may have been the successor to the Home she founded.\n\nSarah Freeman (1814-1839) As noted above, she was buried at Wotton in Surrey.\n\nFrancis Freeman (1816-1909) Died at Belgrave Mansions, Grosvenor Gardens, London – where I once worked. How he obtained his fortune of some £112,000 is not clear. Among others, he left bequests of £15,000 each to his niece Frances Helen Freeman (see above) and his nephew Edward Bouverie Pusey (see above).\n\nCharles Freeman (1823 – ) civil engineer, East India Merchant and J.P. in Sussex, married in 1846 in Plymouth, Devon to Louisa Mary Hawker (1824-1885). The last known sighting of the couple was 1881 in Tormoham Devon, where they lived with youngest daughter Adelaide, and 9 servants. I cannot find a death record for Charles. They had 7 children as follows (bear with it – this is the last, albeit enormous, family in this line!):\n\nFrancis Ford Freeman (1847-1908) M.A. St Andrews, Rectifier and Spirit Dealer, married to Lucy Emma Haden (1853-1929).\n\nHarry Reginald Freeman (1877-1959) Rectifier and Spirit Dealer, married Emma Smith in 1905, 3 children: Mary Freeman, born 1906; Robert 1907. Francis 1910.\n\nPaula Freeman (1879- ) married Stephen Hardcastle Clarke (1865-1928) Five children, Lucy Theodosia Merioneth; Margaret Patricia Hardcastle Clarke; Charles Nicholas Swift Clarke; Ralph Christopher Gooding Clarke (he was a Japanese prisoner of war); and Venetia Dolores Love Clarke.\n\nLouisa Marie aka Isa Freeman (1880-1924) married David Rimington Heaton (1894-1960) Three children, Ursula, Leila and Virginia Lucie.\n\nMargaret Elinor Freeman (1883-1972) married Stephen Nairne Mackenzie. Two children, Elinor Laura Mackenzie and Margaret Griselda Mackenzie\n\nUrsula Freeman (1885 – )\n\nGeorge Bovet Freeman (1886-1964). On his marriage to Kathleen Mary Martin he was said to be District Commisioner, Gambaya, Northern Territory, Gold Coast Colony.\n\nLucy Haden Freeman (1889-1976) married first Richard Bayly Murphy, who died 1912, one daughter; married second Sir Wintringham Norton Stable, High Court Judge, brother of spouse below.\n\nArchibald Francis Freeman (1889-1940), lived in Wales but died at the Railway Station, Grantham. Married Enid Gertrude Stable, sister of Sir Wintringham above.\n\nJessie Louisa Freeman (1849-1868)\n\nReginald Charles Freeman (1852-1915) married Elizabeth Charlotte Wharton (1853-1943). Three children: Claude Reginald Charles Freeman (1886-1957); Dorothy Dundas Freeman (1891-1975) married George Thomson, two children; Arthur Cyril Bruce Freeman (1896-27 Sep 1918, CWGC Grave at Hermies Hill British Cemetery)\n\nElinor Mary Freeman (1854-1868)\n\nFrederick Arthur Freeman (1858 – )\n\nGeorge Hartley Freeman (1863-1863)\n\nAdelaide Catherine Freeman (1886-1937)\n\nThat was exhausting – and very time-consuming. There is yet another branch to explore descending from John Freeman and Ann Backler, and we can then return to the Pellatts, whom we haven’t seen for over a year. These Freeman families are enormous! But here it is – for the record.\n\n6E. Backler descendants of Ann Backler and John Freeman (1): MORGAN/MORTON/BINSTEED/WILLIAMS/SNOOKE\n\nIn which we see that Ann Backler and John Freeman had six children in all, three of whom married and had children. This post looks at the MORGAN descendants, from the marriage of Sarah Freeman (1774-1856) to Rev Thomas MORGAN (1771-1851). We meet, among others, the delightfully-named Rev Hargood Bettesworth Snooke…\n\nSarah Freeman (1774-1856) was pre-deceased by two older siblings, Elizabeth Ann Freeman (1772-1789) and John Freeman (1773-1773). Also pre-deceasing Sarah was her younger sibling John Sotherton Freeman (1777-1777).\n\nSarah Freeman (1774-1856) married Rev Thomas MORGAN (1770-1851) on 4 November 1806 at All Saints Edmonton. Among the witnesses were his brother-in-law Richard PACK, of whom much more in a subsequent post. Thomas was born in Devinnock, Brecknock, and educated at Wadham and Jesus Colleges, Oxford. As well as holding several curacies, he was made a chaplain in the Royal Navy, latterly chaplain of the Royal Dockyard in Portsmouth. There is a portrait of him at the National Maritime Museum, described at https://www.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/rmgc-object-14343 – with further biographical details. The family moved around a lot, as shown in baptismal and census records. According to the Dictionary of Welsh Biography, Thomas sold his lands in Brecknock when his only son died in 1844 ( https://www.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/rmgc-object-14343 ). At his death in 1851 he lived at North End Lodge, Milton, Hampshire.\n\nSarah and Thomas had five children, as follows:\n\nElizabeth Morgan (1808, Goudhurst, Kent – 1885) married Rev David MORTON (1799-1884) on 1 October 1835 in her hometown of Portsea, Hampshire. This marriage re-kindled (or maintained) the Freeman family links with Northamptonshire. Witnesses included, among others, her Northamptonshire-based uncle by marriage Richard Pack, who had also witnessed her parents’ marriage. The couple moved back to Northants, the Rev Morton being Rector of the Parish of Harleston. England censuses from 1841 to 1871 show them living in the Rectory – in 1851 with a Housekeeper, Footman and Servant; in 1861 Cook & Housekeeper, Housemaid, Footman and occasional servant – washerwoman; and three servants in 1871, when David Morton was aged 71. In 1881 the couple are found at 2 Carisbrooke House, Ventnor, Isle of Wight. He is designated as Rector of Harlestone – aged 81. Were they just visiting? David Morton’s Probate record in 1884 shows he died in Southampton, but he is buried in Harlestone. In 1885 Elizabeth died in Sussex but is also buried in Harlestone.\n\nPhiladelphia Sarah Morgan (1814, Goudhurst, Kent – 1852) married Charles Henry BINSTEED (1813 – 1891), Solicitor, on 14 August 1845 at St Thomas Parish Church, Portsmouth. Alas, the names of witnesses are illegible. After her death, her husband re-married in 1860 and had three children – about whom we will not concern ourselves! (That’s a relief, you say…)\n\nAnne Morgan (1816 – 1877) married on 3 February 1842 at Portsea, to Captain Woodford John WILLIAMS, R.N (1809-1892), who would become Admiral. The ceremony was taken by her brother-in-law Rev David Morton, and witnesses included her sister Philadelphia Morton and father Thomas Morgan D.D. The couple had onc child:\n\nAnnie Philadelphia Williams (1843-1914) married Richard Fielden TAYLOR on 6 June 1873 in Southend-on-sea, Essex. Richard was in early censuses a Professor of Music; later on he was described as living on own means. According to the 1911 Census in Torquay, the couple had had 9 children, of whom 5 were still living. Their house had 10 rooms. This family, with the exception of the youngest known child Richard Benjamin Taylor, is an example of a large family with no known descendants – this branch of the family line ends here. Some children were born and died between censuses; known children, identified with the help of online family trees, and confirmed by finding baptismal and death records, were:\n\nAnnie Gwendolyn Taylor (1874-1966). She died in Torquay, left about £12,000, and showed no known occupation in successive censuses. In the 1921 Census, she, her sister Winifred and their father, aged 82, were living at Abbeyfield, Bridge Road, Torquay. Search on this and you will find an elegant house built in 1860, now a rather attractive-looking B & B! This was her address when she died in 1966.\n\nDorothy Morgan Fielden-Taylor (1875 -1959), aka Angel Lorraine Dorothy Morgan, according to her probate notice. She, too, showed no occupation in censuses. She lived in Somerset in 1939, and died there.\n\nMaurice Charles Woodford Taylor (1877-1877, baptised in Chelsea in April and buried at Brompton Cemetery in October.\n\nWinifred Elizabeth Taylor (1878-1937), No known occupation, living with her father and sister in 1921 in Torquay. on 19 February 1937 the Torquay Times and South Devon Advertiser reported her funeral, noting that she had lived with her sister Gwendolyn (as above) for about 25 years and was an ardent church-goer and church worker with Tor Church and the Tor Missionary Association. A long list is given of friends and family who attended the funeral and sent wreaths.\n\nDiana Margaret Taylor (twin: 1879-1880), buried at St Mary Wandsworth.\n\nRev Canon Thomas Fielden-Taylor (twin: 1879-1937, Wellington NZ). After qualifying in law, went to NZ for health reasons and was ordained. Chaplain to NZ army in the 1st WW, served in and wounded in Dardanelles, then to France, then invalided back to NZ. Married Eleanor Sophia Mules (1873-1950), daughter of Bishop Mules in 1911. After the War, according to NZ dictionary of Biography, he was a missioner at St. Peter’s Mission, Wellington. https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/3t11/taylor-thomas-fielden This link takes you to a longer biography, celebrating his work with youngsters, but also chronicling unproved charges of abuse against him. There were no children of this marriage.\n\nGladys Frances Taylor (1881-1886). Baptised at St Mary’s, Putney; buried in Heene in Sussex.\n\nChristine Marie Taylor (1882-1886) Baptised in Putney 2 February 1882, Father now a ‘Gentleman’, as opposed to ‘Professor of Music’ in previous baptisms. Died in Worthing, buried at Heene on 31 May 1886.An inquest was reported in a syndicated article appearing in many newspapers between the end of May and the beginning of June, for instance the Edinburgh Evening News on 31 May. Three children had been suddenly taking ill with vomiting and other symptoms very early one morning, having gone to bed well. One aged 4 (Christine) died later that morning and another (Gladys) in the afternoon. A third child recovered. No obvious evidence of cause, for instance poisoning, was found, and after an adjourned inquest, further work was to be done on the stomach contents at Guy’s Hospital. No further report appears in the British Newspaper Archive.\n\nRichard Benjamin Taylor (1883 – ) appears in the 1891 Census with his parents and surviving siblings. In 1901 he was at school in Horsham, Sussex. The Portsmouth Evening News 23 January 1903 reports that at the Gosport Petty Sessions Richard Benjamin Fielding Taylor was fined 2s 6d for riding a bicycle on the footpath of the Fareham Road! He has proved difficult to trace after that.\n\nThomas Charles Morgan (1818 Portsea, Hants – 1844 Secundarabad, India). Lincolnshire Chronicle 29 November 1844: ‘Death of a Promising Young Officer: Died, at Secundarabad in the East Indies, on the 11th of September last, in the 26th year of his age, after a few days’ attack of a violent, irruptive fever, which terminated in pulmonary apoplexy, Lieutenant Thomas Charles Morgan, acting adjutant for nearly four years in the 4th Foot (or King’s Own), the dear and only son of the Rev. Doctor Morgan, Chaplain of Portsmouth Dockyard. He was of an affectionate disposition and generous nature, amiable and a most promising officer…he was beloved in his regiment…‘\n\nMary Morgan (1820-1880). Married widower Rev Hargood Bettesworth SNOOKE (1807-1875) on 11 October 1853 in Portsea. He was perpetual curate in Portsea, and in 1867 became Chaplain of St Malo and Dinard. He died in Jersey. He had three children by his first marriage, and two daughters with Mary Morgan, who were::\n\nMary Elizabeth Snooke aka Hargood (1855-1912). She never married, appeared with her sister in the 1911 Census at 2 Pemberton Terrace, Cambridge, and died there in 1912, address The Tiled House, Panton Street, Cambridge, citing her sister (below) as executor of her will. Nothing else known.\n\nRosa Mary Morgan Snooke (1857-1929) lived at various addresses in London, always of ‘Private Means’. In 1901 shw is found at the elegant Ladies’ Residential Club at 52 Lower Sloane Street, and as noted above, in 1911 she was living with her sister in Cambridge. The 1921 Census shows her as Rosa Mary Morgan Hargood, 64, living at 34 Panton Street, Cambridge. Her Probate index record shows that she died at Heigham Hall in Norwich, Norfolk in 1929, effects approx £7800.\n\nAnd thus endeth the roll of descendants of Sarah Freeman and the Rev Thomas Morgan. It appears there are no possible living descendants of this line.\n\n6d. Children of Thomas Freeman and Dennis Gare\n\nIn which we quickly consider the descendants of Thomas Freeman and Dennis Gare – excepting those of John Freeman and Ann Backler. We trace links between families, and back to Northamptonshire for those who were in London.\n\nOf eldest child Thomas Freeman (bap 1738 Weedon Bec – ), we know little, other than, as noted in the previous post (6c), that he was a cordwainer in Bedford, with a son Thomas Freeman (approx 1764 – ), who was briefly apprenticed to John Freeman in London before being turned over to John Grant, Citizen and Glover, in 1779. A reference in Bedford Archives catalogue in ‘An Account of the indentures of apprentice bound out by the Bedford Charity’ (X109/1/70) cites ‘John Covington 8 May [1799] to Thomas Freeman of Kingsthorp – shoe maker’. But who knows? End of known story!\n\nOf John Freeman and Ann Backler, we will turn to them in the next post. Their children are direct Backler descendants, while those further mentioned in this post are Backler cousins by marriage.\n\nOf Anne Freeman (bap 23 July 1742 Weedon Bec – ), we know even less than about Thomas. Did she marry? Not sure. And we have no Wills of her parents to see if she is mentioned there. She is not mentioned in her siblings’ Wills so far identified.\n\nOf William Freeman (1745 Weedon Bec -1795), we know more. We have seen in the previous post that he went to London sometime in the 1760s or 70s, and was made free of the Ironmongers in 1787 through his brother John’s recommendation. The record of William’s marriage to Judith T(h)ompson (1756-1785) is one of those felicitous finds that brings some strands together. Taking place at Northampton St Sepulchre on 4 July 1776, it helpfully stipulates that William Freeman is ‘of Cripplegate in the City of London’. The marriage was conducted by C[harles] Tompson, Rector of Mulsoe in the County of Buckinghamshire. who turns out to be Judith’s brother. Witnesses as shown on an ancestry parish record image signed as Geo:Tompson, in a rather large, shaky hand which could be\n\nthat of her father, and a very familiar signature for the Backlers.com blog – that of S[otherton] Backler [1746-1819], with its distinctive wavy flourishes seen in many documents of the Society of Apothecaries. This is Ann’s brother, who would eventually become Clerk to the Society. It is surely likely that John Freeman was at his brother’s wedding as well?\n\nGeorge T(h)ompson, Judith’s father, was a Grocer in Northampton, also designated as Alderman in Judith’s baptismal record and Mayor in the baptismal record of his daughter Mary in 1754. His lengthy Will probated in 1787, also the year of his son the Rev Charles Tompson’s death, is long and leaves much property and wealth to innumerable children, including £1,500 in stocks and securities to his son-in-law William Freeman. His daughter Judith also features many times in the Will, but I confess to lack of inclination to decipher it all. The Will was written in 1781, and Judith predeceased her father in 1785, so her legacy would be shared by her surviving children.\n\nWilliam Freeman and Judith Tompson had five children as far as is known. Judith died in 1785, and William in 1795, after which date the surviving youngsters were orphans:\n\nSusannah (1777-1778)\n\nWilliam (1779 -), married first Mary Hawling, and second Ann Randall, with whom he had two sons, William (1803) and George (1808). We saw in the previous post that William was apprenticed first to his father and then to his uncle John of the Ironmongers. Mention in his brother George’s Will in 1849 would indicate that William was alive then, but I cannot find a suitable death record or Will.\n\nGeorge (1780-1854), was also apprenticed to his father, and then turned over to his uncle George Tompson, Judith’s brother, in 1796 after his father’s death. In the 1851 Census he is shown as a 70-year-old retired Grocer, lodging at Radcliffe Terrace, Finsbury, the address given in his brief Will written two years before and proved by his Executor and Nephew John Downes in August 1854, and to whom the rest and residue is bequeathed after £10 and his clothes and linen are left to George’s brother William (see bullet above).\n\nJudith Freeman (1781-1854) married John Downes (1781-1849), a wholesale tea dealer. They had at least five children. Their final address was 6 Bedford Place, Russell Square. Judith’s Will written 8 October 1850 would be a delightful read if it were more legible. It specifies exactly what is to go to each child, such as which volumes and editions of books, which silver spoons, which articles of furniture. But life is too short\n\nOf Thomas and Dennis’ last child we can note just John Freeman (bap Sep 1784 St Giles Cripplegate – buried Mar 1785 St Giles Cripplegate, cause of death convulsions).\n\nAnd so endeth the account of Backler-cousins-by-Freeman-marriage. In the next post we will look at the very many descendants of John Freeman and Anne Backler.\n\n6c. John Freeman (1740-1803) Indigo Maker and Ironmonger from Northamptonshire\n\nIn which we look a little more closely at John Freeman (1740-1803), who married Ann Backler (1741-1820), speculating that the woad industry of Northamptonshire prompted his move to London to improve his fortunes in the related industry of indigo making. Also considering his links with the Ironmongers Company and his certain acquaintance (or more?) with the Pellatts, who played a prominent role therein and whose heritage we will examine in future posts.\n\nThe tree above will form the basis of this and the next post (or two). It shows two generations of descendants of Thomas FREEMAN (1684-1761) and his wife Dennis GARE (1710-1782). Of particular relevance to this post are John Freeman, who we know married Ann Backler in London, and John’s brother William Freeman (1745-1795), also to be found in London.\n\nFrom his Will and other sources (see below) we know that John was an Indigo Maker. Without direct evidence, it is possible to speculate that this occupation was related to John’s and brother William’s migration from Northamptonshire to London from an area in Northamptonshire actively involved in the production of dye from woad, a crop widely grown in the area. A post on the Whilton history website describes this industry in some detail. (https://whiltonlhs.org/whilton-history/f/woad-in-whilton ). The post describes the itinerant nature of woad workers, the necessity for communities to separate themselves from the dreadful stink of woad processing (and from the workers who carried this stink with them), and the gains to be made by landowners in letting out fields for growing the biennial crop. Every four years or so, the workers moved on to other sites. One place of residence was in the now-defunct village of Glassthorpe, almost certainly the location cited in entries in the Flore Parish Register, which also indicate that family groups were involved in the woad industry:\n\n. 1732 Apr 9. James son of William & Martha Phipps (Woading-Labourers at Clastrop) was baptized.\n\n1732 July 14. William son of Edward & Mary Phipps (Woaders at Clastrop) was Buried. Affadavit Dated, July 20.\n\n1740 June 22. Elizabeth daughter of Thomas & Elizabeth Neal (Woad-Folks) was Baptized.\n\n1740 July 12. James son of Peter & Elizabeth Neal (Woad-folks) was Baptized.\n\n1740 July 20, James son of Peter & Elizabeth Neal was buried. Affid: Dated, July 25.\n\nWoad was the native-grown plant which produced blue dye, but a richer, darker dye could be got from Indigo, which from the start of the 18th century was increasingly being imported from Asia and the Americas, produced largely through the work of slave or indentured labour. (See, for instance:Blue in Eighteenth Century England: Pigments and Usages. Zoriana Lotut. https://journals.openedition.org/1718/1214?lang=e )\n\nFrom Northamptonshire to London: At some point, probably in the 1860s, William and John – together or separately? – went to London. The first record we find is that of John, being made free by redemption of the Ironmongers Company, on 24 July 1769. The transcribed record on findmypast shows him as a ‘Blue merchant’, son of Thomas Freeman, gentleman. Proposed by W. Price. In 1787, William Freeman (1745-1795), Indigo Maker, becomes free by redemption, proposed by J Freeman, his older brother (nepotism abounds in the City Livery Companies). Further family links appear in Ironmongers’ records over the next decade:\n\nThomas Freeman is apprenticed to John Freeman, 20 March 1779. This Thomas, said to be aged 15 years, is said in the record to be the son of Thomas Freeman (1738/9 – ), Cordwainer, of Bedford. As mentioned in John Freeman’s Will of 1803, the father is John’s older brother Thomas, baptised in Weedon Bec in 1738/9 and frustratingly elusive after that. Young Thomas, apprenticed first to his uncle John, was shortly after, on 17 June 1779, turned over to John Grant, Citizen and Glover, of the Glovers’ Company. No more is known about Thomas Snr or Jnr. Records from Bedfordshire are not very evident online.\n\nThomas Freeman, this time son of John Freeman (1740-1803), was apprenticed to his father, John Freeman, Indigo Maker of St Giles Cripplegate, on 30 April, 1793, for no consideration. This apprenticeship would see out its full time, with Thomas being made Free by service to his father John, on 30 April 1800. We will return to this Thomas (1779-1853) in a future post.\n\nWilliam Freeman (1779 – ), son of William Freeman (1745-1795), who we have seen above, became free of the Ironmongers by redemption, was on 29 August 1793 bound apprentice to his father William Freeman, Little Aldermanbury, Indigo Maker. However, William Snr’s dates as above show that he died in 1795, so on 25 November 1795, young William was ‘turned over’ to his uncle John Freeman, Citizen and Ironmonger, for the duration of his apprenticeship. I have not found a record of William being made free of the Ironmongers.\n\nGeorge Freeman (1780-1854) also son of William Snr, on 27 November 1794 was also bound apprentice to his father. After William Snr’s death in 1795, on 19 March 1796, George was turned over to George Tompson (see next bullet point), Citizen and Ironmonger, to serve out his apprenticeship. I have not found a further record of George’s apprenticeship, but we will return to him in future posts.\n\nGeorge T(h)ompson (as in the previous bullet point) was made Free by Redemption of the Ironmongers on 24 June 1788, son of George Thompson, Gent (of Northamptonshire). George Jnr was a tea dealer, and was the brother of Judith T(h)ompson ( – 1785), late wife of William Freeman Snr. George was proposed for his freedom by … John Freeman! (Are you keeping up? – nepotism, indeed.) We will return to this family in a later post.\n\nThe Aldermanbury Postern address, hard by the city walls in St Giles Cripplegate, was the site of the indigo makers variably named as Grace and Freeman (appearing in London directories between 1781 and 1794), later Freeman John & Son (by 1803), then Freeman and North (1817). William Freeman (died 1795) and Henry Grace (died 1798), and John Freeman, were in partnership, with John taking over for the brief period after their deaths until his own in 1803, the original partnership having been dissolved in 1795, just before William’s death, as recorded in the London Gazette as follows:\n\nJune 24, 1795. The partnership subsisting between Henry Grace, John Freeman and William Freeman, in the Business carried on under the firm of Grace and Freemans of Aldermanbury Postern, London, Indigo Blue Manufacturers, is this Day, by mutual Consent, dissolved, the Share of the said Henry Grace being made over to the remaining partners, the said John Freeman and William Freeman, who undertake to settle all Matters relating to the said Copartnership. Henry Grace. Wm. Freeman. John Freeman. The London Gazette Issue 13790. 23 June 1795. p. 663\n\nI am not sure who took over after John Freeman died in 1803. Could the ‘and Son’ have been his son Thomas, who had served his apprenticeship under John and then been made free of the Ironmongers? Suffice to say that at his death in Brighton in 1853, as a ‘Merchant’ he was evidently a very wealthy man. The source of his fortune is unknown. We will meet this family again.\n\nThis post has aimed at locating John Freeman and his brother William in London from their Northamptonshire origins. A review of their families in future posts will very partially uncover the tangled roots of the Freeman and related families.\n\n6b. Thomas Freeman and Dennis Gare\n\nIn which we briefly look at the maternal ancestors of John Freeman, who married Ann Backler. We try not to get carried away in looking at the complicated and fascinating histories of these Northamptonshire folk, who are not actually relations of any sort to me, but just the ancestors of some quite distant Backler cousins. We will leave detailed research to those cousins.\n\nIn my previous post (6a), I looked at John Freeman’s paternal ancestors. In this post I briefly sketch his maternal side, since I know precious little about them other than their names.\n\nWilliam GARE and Dennis MARRIOTT: There is an abundance of folk named ‘Gare’ in this area of Northamptonshire. I am not sure who were William Gare’s antecedents. John Freeman’s mother was the interestingly-named Dennis GARE (1710-1782), the second daughter of that name born to William GARE (died 1733) and his wife Dennis MARRIOTT (1660/1 – 1746). Dennis Gare was the second youngest of eight children. Second-born Edward (1701-1711) was short-lived, as were fourth-born Dennis (1704-1708) and last-born Edward (1718-1718).\n\nThird-born William Gare Jnr (1703 – ) married first Mary Marks in Flore, Northants, in 1731. Mary died at or near to the childbirth and death of their daughter Anne in 1732. William then married Mary Cobley in the nearby parish of Weston Favell in 1736, three years after the death of his father, and in 1738/9 yet another William Gare was born to this couple.\n\nNothing is known to this author of Thomas Gare (1706 – ), but John Gare (1708, Flore – 1779, Blisworth) married Mary Rushworth in Easton Neston, Northants, in 1735, they producing at least four children: (another) Dennis Gare (1737-1804 , married William Peach in Blisworth in 1763); Thomas Gare (1738-1738); John Gare (1745-1745); and John Gare (1748 – ?), for whom a marriage and un-sourced children feature on an Ancestry tree, but whose fate, and that of any further children in this family, I will leave to others.\n\nAbraham MARRIOTT and Amy BILLING/E: I don’t have enough information to trace the GARE line any further back. The Marriotts are more obliging. After diligent scrolling through the parish registers of Weedon Bec – rather sadly, a favourite occupation of mine! – I at last found an unindexed marriage confirming details which featured on several Ancestry websites: that of Abraham Marrett [sic] and Amy Billing on 6 June 1645. (The surname shows many variants in the Weedon Bec registers, including Marrett, Marit, Marriott, and Marriet, among others). Scrolling forward in the parish registers, we find at least ten children born up to 1663, but we have no death date for either Abraham or Amy. Some trees show a death date for Abraham…but it is the wrong person!\n\nThe difficult thing with both Gare and Marriott names is the abundance of people with the same names. There are cousins, aunts and uncles, all named |John, or Thomas, Samuel, Richard, Anne . etc etc. The Weedon Bec parish register is helpful in sorting some of them out, as in the case of burials it tends to give relationships – wife or husband of…or child of…This helped in the Marriott case to stay with the one family.\n\nGoing back in time, we know again from parish registers that Amie [sic, mis-transcribed as Annie] Billing was baptised 22 April 1627, the daughter of Samuel BILLING and Mary. Abraham Marret was baptised 15 December 1622, son of William MARRET and his wife Joane. Both baptisms in Weedon Bec.\n\nI have found these intertwined families in and around Weedon Bec, Flore, Brockhall, Bugbrooke, Everdon and many more, ro be fascinating. BUT it is time I moved on to the families of more direct concern to our Backler story. To be continued in my next post!\n\n6a. Ann Backler and John Freeman: exploring a newly-discovered (and extensive) Backler line\n\nIn which we unveil some details about Ann Backler (1741-1820) and her husband John Freeman, Indigo Maker (1740 – 1803), spurred on by contact to this blog by a very distant cousin descended from this partnership. In this and some subsequent posts we will briefly look at the Freeman family, and then (again, briefly) follow the many descendants, featuring some great wealth, and lots of clergy and military folk. We will move on from the report in Blogpost 6, ‘The Family of Sotherton Backler, Apothecary, and his wife Ann Ashley’ https://wordpress.com/post/backlers.com/50 which stated as follows:\n\nAnn 1741 – m. John Freeman 12 July 1770 at St Andrew by the Wardrobe/St Ann Blackfriars, witnessed by S Backler and Sarah Rowley. Nothing more is known about Ann and John. [But, now, read on…]\n\nJohn Freeman, of the Parish of St Ann Blackfriars, Bachelor, and Ann Backler, of the Parish of St Dunstan in the West, Spinster, were married by Licence at St Andrew by the Wardrobe on 7 July 1770. Witnesses were S Backler [her brother Sotherton Backler (1746-1819)], Sarah Rowley [not sure who she is] and Elizabeth Backler [almost certainly Ann’s sister, born 1748/9, whose fate I have not managed to trace. The tree below shows the married couple and their six children (of whom more in succeeding blogposts). The baptism records of some of the children show that John was an Indigo Maker.\n\nJohn FREEMAN (1740-1803) was born in Weedon Bec, Northamptonshire, son of Thomas FREEMAN (1684-1761) and Dennis [sic] GARE (1710-1782). I spent many engaging hours in the summer of 2022 working with distant cousin Chris to disentangle the various lineages originating in Northamptonshire and linked in many different ways to Ann Backler and John Freeman. My challenge is to get them into some kind of order for the purposes of my Backler blog! The very many descendants of John Freeman and Ann Backler are cousins of one sort or another with me and the other Backler descendants chronicled on this site – all sharing in some degree as grandparents, Sotherton Backler (1704 – 1763) and Ann Ashley (c.1714-1768).\n\nFor some time I had linked the name of Ann Backler with that of John Freeman, but it wasn’t until his death date of 1803 was suggested to me that I identified the correct John Freeman, among many possibilities, and found his Will, clearly citing his brother-in-law Sotherton Backler as an executor. The Will was one of those very helpful ones, citing lots of clearly-labelled relations. It showed that John Freeman was resident in Newington Green, Middlesex, hard by Islington and Stoke Newington, the places of residence of many of our Backler and, later on, Boulding and Pellatt ancestors. However, John wished to be buried at St Ann Blackfriars, right by the Society of Apothecaries and the site of many Backler baptisms and burials.\n\nBy the time of drafting his Will, just one of John and Ann’s children had married, three having pre-deceased them. Mary, the youngest, had in 1802 married to soon-to-become very-wealthy Richard Pack, cited as an executor in John’s Will. (More about them anon.) Son Thomas would marry soon after his father’s death, and daughter Sarah would follow a couple of years later. She is left a handsome legacy, with provision after John’s wife Ann’s death for both daughters and their children. Also mentioned are John’s niece, Mary Gough (which, in sorting out various Freeman families in Northants helps to confirm John’s family), and John’s brother Thomas, of Bedford – a mysterious soul, indeed. The Will shows that John owned a house in Fore Street, Cripplegate, where the Sotherton Backlers also had lived – could this house have come to him on his marriage to Ann?\n\nJohn Freeman was the great grandson of Richard FREEMAN [1] ( – 1694) and Mary GODFREY [sometimes GODFREE] of Brockhall (1622-1691). Brockhall was one centre of residence for the Freemans, Godfreys and others prominent in John Freeman’s family tree. Adjacent parishes include Dodford, Norton, Whilton and Flore, all places of births, marriages and burials of various kin.\n\nRichard Freeman [1] was a Bonesetter, a largely un-formally-trained version of an osteopath, chiropractor and physiotherapist. Such was his fortune, however acquired, that in 1644 he purchased the Manor of Whilton. His and Mary’s son Richard FREEMAN [2] (1646-1684, note he died ten years before his father, so Richard [1’s] grandson inherited) married his cousin Elizabeth GODFREY. ‘Our’ John FREEMAN was the youngest son of Richard FREEMAN [2].\n\nA number of features marked Whilton in this period. First, and perhaps relevant to the bonesetting, was the Civil War. Northamptonshire supported the Parliamentarians, but battles took place all around the area, including in Whilton and Flore, and notably at nearby Naseby.\n\nNot having found any contextual information for that period, there is later evidence found by my Freeman-sleuthing partner: reference to Mr Freeman, Bonesetter in Memoires of the Verney Family, Vol IV, downloaded from https://archive.org/details/memoirsofverneyf04verniala/page/394/mode/2up\n\nYoung Edmund Verney, a student at Oxford from 1685-8, has had an accident, and damaged his elbow. On 6 April 1687, his father wrote to Dr Thomas Sykes: ‘ This day about noone yr Messenger Brought me the ill newse of my Sonnes unlucky accident last Munday. I am very sorry for it : But am extremely joyfull to under- stand by you that the worst is past with this and that He is in so fayre a way of amendment soe I Hope There is noe Danger in a dislocation of an Elbow, where such excellent Chirurgions and Bone setters are at Hand, and Physitians if occasion Be : I Guesse This was done at wrestling…’ However, the arm continued to prove troublesome, and by May young Edmund still did not have proper use of it. On 14 May 1687, his tutor wrote to the lad’s father, also Edmund: ‘His arme is free from paine, but he hath not yet the right use of it, And upon that Account as soon as I was fearfull that all was not right, I would have had him gone home to you in order to his consulting some very skilfull Chirurgion, and particularly advised him to one Mr. Freeman who lives near Daventry in Northamptonshire, and is every market Day Here at the Wheatsheaf. This man here is look’d upon by Physitians and others as the most skilfull Bone setter in all England, And therefore I had a desire that your Sonn should have his opinion ;‘ On 22 May 1687, young Edmund’s father wrote: ‘The famous Bone setter Mr. ffreeman Lookt upon the arm and ffelt it, and sayd it is right sett, and nothing out, but That the sinues are shrunk wch makes Him That Hee cannot Hold his Arme streight : But Mr. ffreeman sayes his Arme will Do well : and Be as streight as ever, if Hee Doth use it and exercise it with care : and ffollow his directions and prescriptions.‘\n\nAn entry in the Parish Register of Brockhall does record one impact of the Civil War: ‘May 4th 1653. Brockhall Parsonage was by Mr. James Cranford resigned to the Present Rector thereof Mr. William Borlee, who by Reason of the Warrs between the Royalist [sic] and Parliamentarians not being Constant Resident until February 2nd 1646 noe Just Account could be taken of the Severall Baptizeings Marriages and Burrials.\n\nWhether the above hiatus also afftected a delay in baptising of Richard Freeman [2] from his birth in 1646 to his Baptism in 1650 is not known. What is known is that he and Elizabeth Godfrey had five children, of whom the oldest, Richard [3] (1677-1749) and the youngest, Thomas Freeman (1684, the year of his father’s death – 1761) are most relevant to our story.\n\nFirst off, Richard [3] (1677-1749) had two wives, Mary CORPSON (1680-1707) – 6 children, most of whom were short-lived except for the Rev. John Freeman (1703-1786), educated at Pembroke College Oxford and then Rector of Louth in Lincolnshire. His half-siblings were the children of Richard FREEMAN [3] and his second wife, Elizabeth LANGTON (1688-1761), whose first son the Rev Langton Freeman (1710-1784) inherited Whilton Manor. Langton was the oldest of ten children, and an avowed eccentric. His and his siblings’ stories are interwoven throughout the vicinity, including Daventry, Northampton, and into Warwickshire. Much too numerous to delineate here, and anyway, they aren’t Backler descendants! His Will, however, made unusual provision for his interment:\n\nfirst, his body to lie in the Bed in which he dies for four or five days until it becomes offensive; then to be moved in the Bed to the summerhouse in the garden, ‘and to be wrapped in a strong double winding sheet, and in all other respects to be interred as near as may be to the description we receive in Holy Scripture of Our Saviours Burial. The doors and windows to be locked up or bolted and to be kept as near and in the same manner and state as they shall be at the time of my Decease. And I desire that the Building or Summer House may be planted around with evergreen plants and fenced off with Iron or Oak pales and painted of a blue colour. For carrying this out, he gives Whilton to his nephew Thomas Freeman (1746-1801), son of Langton’s brother Thomas (1715-1777) and his second wife Anne Adams ( – 1781). Nephew Thomas died in 1802, and the estate passed to his daughter Marianne (1788-1866), who had married Dr Charles Rattray ( – 1836). The estate was then sold.\n\nThis takes us to the branch, founded by Richard FREEMAN [2] and Elizabeth GODFREY, and of direct interest to the Backler story: that of Thomas FREEMAN and his wife Dennis GARE. BUT, to develop this story in bitesized chunks, I will leave this family to the next post! Hopefully there won’t be too much of a gap before it appears.\n\n46. The Rivers line\n\nIn which we move back in time again to take a very brief look at the Rivers line, parallelling our Newton line, and equally far back in the mists of time.\n\nThere are any number of potted histories of the Rivers family, of London and Kent. This post is lifted from an amalgam of them, including a google book entitled The Baronetage of England, Or the History of the English Baronets…Volume 1, by William Betham, in the chapter Rivers Gay of Chafford Kent, starting on p. 217.\n\nThe tree chart above begins at the top with Sir John Rivers, died 1584. All the sources say he was the son of Richard Rivers of Penshurst, steward of the lands of Penshurst Place, belonging to Edward Stafford, Duke of Buckingham. Sir John was of ‘Chafford’. an estate in Kent. The original house was replaced in the 19th century, no longer owned by any Rivers descendants. It offers posh weddings and accommodation, or camping or glamping in the grounds. Sir John Rivers was Lord Mayor of London during the 15th year of Queen Elizabeth’s reign. He married Elizabeth Barne(s), daughter of another Lord Mayor, Sir George Barne(s), Knt, (died 1558) and his wife Alice Brooke.\n\nWe pause for a moment to look at the role of the Lord Mayor – a ceremonial position. The extract below is taken from the website of the London Metropolitan Archives. Remember that a ‘citizen’ is a member of one of the livery companies of London, as were several Backlers (apothecaries), and as we shall see, as will be many Pellatts. Of the folk mentioned in this post, we find grocers and haberdashers.\n\nThe first recorded Mayor of London was Henry Fitz-Ailwyn in 1189. Since then, some 700 men and one woman have over the centuries held the position of chief officer of the City of London. The most famous of them all is Dick Whittington, who held office three times, in 1397, 1406 and 1419. The Lord Mayor has throughout the centuries played a vital role in the life of the City of London and continues to do so today. In the City, the Lord Mayor ranks immediately after the sovereign and acts as the capital’s host in Guildhall and Mansion House, his official residence. On behalf of the City and the nation he carries out numerous engagements at home and abroad. The right of citizens to elect their own Mayor dates from the Charter granted by King John to the City in 1215. The election of Lord Mayor is held at the end of September each year in Guildhall. The assembly, known as Common Hall, consists of all liverymen of at least one year’s standing together with certain high officers of the City. All aldermen who have served the office of sheriff and who have not already been Lord Mayor are eligible.\n\nTumultuous times. Now let’s look at the career of Sir George Barne (sometimes referred to as Barnes). He was a Citizen and Haberdasher, which means in the City of London he was a member of the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers. From the early 16th century, this Guild had two branches – those who traded in hats, and those who traded in small wares, such as ribbons, beads, hats, purses etc. First made Sherriff of London in 1545-46, the last full year of Henry VIII’s reign, Sir George Barne became Lord Mayor of London in the turbulent years of 1552-53. During this period, young Edward VI died and during several months of intrigue, ultimately treason, Barne oversaw the eventual accession of Queen Mary to the throne. This is all too much to narrate here, but a very full account of his life and times can be seen on Wikipedia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Barne_(died_1558 ).\n\nAnother London Lord Mayor: Sir John Rivers, Lord Mayor of London, 1573/4 – I cannot do better than Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rivers\n\nSir John Rivers (died 27 February 1584) was a Tudor-era businessman who became Lord Mayor of London. He was born to Richard Rivers, steward of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham‘s lands. Alternate spelling includes John Ryvers. He was a grocer and member of the Worshipful Company of Grocers, Sheriff of London in 1566, and Lord Mayor of London in 1573. He was knighted in 1574 and served as President of St. Thomas’ Hospital between 1580 and 1584. He also served as an Alderman for the London wards of Farringdon between 1565 and 1568, Broad Street between 1568 and 1574, and Walbrook between 1574 and 1584. He married Elizabeth Barne, daughter of Sir George Barne (died 1558), and they had Sir George Rivers, who was a Member of Parliament. Rivers was lay rector at St. Mary’s Church, Hadlow, Kent.\n\nSir George Rivers (c1554- c1630) was another businessman, and a politician, being returned several times as Member of Parliament for East Grinstead and Lewes in Sussex, to which we will return when further exploring the Pellatt line. Sir George married Frances Bow(y)er (1579-1614), daughter of William Bow(y)er of Sussex. The History of Parliament website summarises Sir George’s career as follows (https://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/rivers-george-1553-1630 )\n\nRivers’s maternal grandfather and his father were lord mayors of London. Rivers himself, however (though he made an unsuccessful application to succeed William Lambarde at the alienations office in 1601) was a country gentleman and agricultural improver, with estates in Kent and Sussex. Chafford, near Penshurst, had been acquired by his family in Henry VIII’s reign, and Withyham was near an early seat of the Sackvilles. Rivers remained on close terms with this family, being an executor both of Robert, 2nd Earl of Dorset (his ‘faithful and dear friend’) and Richard the 3rd Earl. It was no doubt through the Sackvilles that Rivers came to be returned at East Grinstead to the last two Elizabethan Parliaments, and in 1606 he obtained for himself a share in the borough. Though both Parliaments are comparatively well documented, Rivers left no mark upon the records. He made his will by January 1630, ‘feeling age creeping on’ and died 20 Feb. that year.\n\nTheir son, Sir John Rivers (1579- c.1651), was made the first Baronet of Chafford in 1621.\n\nHere it will be useful to pause and look at the two types of ‘Sir’ we find in the Rivers line. The first occurs when a person is knighted by the sovereign. Our previous ‘Sirs’ were all examples of this type, and their names may be suffixed with Knt or similar. The second type, as seen here with Sir John Rivers, Baronet (or Bart) is when a person is accorded a ‘hereditary dignity’, again by the sovereign, but which title can pass down through the (male) generations.. This new title, created by James I of England in May 1611, had an ulterior motive – raising funds for the sovereign! Initially candidates were required to pay a fee, and after acts of union with Scotland (1707) and Ireland (1801), all new baronetcies were just of the United Kingdom. The Rivers baronetcy became extinct on the death of the 11th baronet in 1870.\n\nSir John Rivers married Dorothy Potter (1570-1627), the daughter of Thomas Potter (died 1611), of Well-Street in Westerham, Kent, and his wife Mary Titchbourne. For copyright reasons I do not replicate it here, but a portrait said to be of Mary Tichborne (sic) features on the website of noted art historian Philip Mould, and can be seen at http://www.historicalportraits.com/Gallery.asp?Page=Item&ItemID=1912&Desc=Mary-Tichborne-%7C-Master-of-the-Countess-of-Warwick Meanwhile, a transcription of the memorial in Westerham Parish Church to Thomas Potter can be seen online as below at https://static.secure.website/wscfus/263661/uploads/Thomas_Potter_info.pdf\n\nAstute readers will note that Thomas Potter’s second wife was Elizabeth [nee Barnes], widow of Sir John Rivers (died 1584), Mayor of London, as described above. This neatly illustrates what a small world it was at that time both socially and geographically, folk seeming to move with ease between Kent, Sussex and London. In addition, the period covered in this post includes the reign of Henry VIII and the dissolution of the monasteries. This resulted in lands seized being distributed to loyal servants of the crown, such as many of our ancestors mentioned here. Not members of the aristocracy, they nevertheless were well-to-do property owners, also prosperous merchants and civic worthies – as, we shall soon see, were the Pellatts.\n\nNewton-Rivers: And now at last we can link up the Rivers and Newton lines – The daughter of Sir John Rivers and Dorothy Potter, Dorothy Rivers (died 1642) married William Newton (1598-1658), their son being Apsley Newton. (See post 45) This now prepares us to venture forth to the Pellatt line."
