        "text": "Armes Parlantes: An Opinion and Some Examples\n\nArms parlantes (\"speaking arms\"), more generally termed \"canting arms\" in which the arms are a pun, or cant, on the surname of the bearer, have sometimes been considered a \"low\" form of heraldry, a type of \"cheap shot\" unworthy of true heralds.\n\n[Sir Thomas] Wriothesley [Garter King of Arms 1505-1534] and [Sir Christopher] Barker [garter King of Arms 1536-1550] abstained in a great measure from this practice [of granting canting arms] in the concessions of arms which were made by them; but so congenial was it with the taste of king James and the fashions which he patronised, that many bearings of this description were assumed during his frivolous reign, some of which have been subsequently confirmed to their families by the college of heralds. Some respect may be due to the few instances of high antiquity, but they should be generally considered as of easy and vulgar application, and very widely deviating from the chast[e]ness and simplicity of pure heraldry.\n\nJames Dallaway, Inquiries into the Origin and Progress of the Science of Heraldry in England, 1793, p. 275\n\n\"Easy and vulgar\"? Wow, now that's a put down. I'm not certain why Mr. Dallaway held this low opinion of armes parlantes, because they seem to me to have been pretty popular in all nations with heraldry for a very, very long time, and they are not always as easy to identify as he apparently seems to think. I'm remembering the arms of Arundel, which contain martlets, a type of swallow. You might not think that these are canting arms, until it is pointed out that the French term for swallow is hirondelle, a clear pun on the surname.\n\nAnd, of course, one of my own personal favorites from here in the United States is the arms of the family of John Hancock, who wrote his name so large upon the Declaration of Independence in 1776. (The story is that he signed it so largely and clearly so that King George III could read it without his spectacles.) Mr. Hancock is buried in the Granary Burying Ground in Boston, Massachusetts, and his monument there clearly displays his canting arms of a hand and three cocks.\n\nAnyway, all that is leading up to a couple of great canting arms that I found in an old Italian armorial (one of the ones I've been going through recently looking for arms which contain camels; such arms are rare, but I've found more of them than I had expected to) that I felt like I just had to share.\n\nThe first is pretty easy to figure out (a Turk for Turcha). The other falls into place when you learn that the Italian volpe means \"fox.\"\n\nCool, huh? Or do you, too, feel that such armes parlantes are \"of easy and vulgar application, and very widely deviating from the chast[e]ness and simplicity of pure heraldry\"? (Personally, I don't know much about chasteness in heraldry, especially considering some of those maiden's heads and melusines, but I can think of few things of greater simplicity than a single fox on a plain field. But what do I know?)\n\nBy the way, if you are interested in looking at some of these armorials for yourself, they can be found on the website of the Münchener DigitalisierungsZentrum Digitale Bibliothek. There is a link to this site in the \"Some Good On-Line Armorials and Ordinaries\" in the left-hand column of this blog.\n\nShe's Asking for What?\n\nOn January 30, 2016, Mary Jones made a Freedom of Information request to the College of Arms. In her request, she asked:\n\nI would therefore request information if any part of these fees [paid by petitioners for grants of arms] are paid to Mr Woodcock either for the work he undertakes on the grant or for his signature on documents and grants? If so can I ask how much this is, does Mr Woodcock pay tax of these amounts ...?\n\nWell, heck, I can answer those questions, and I don't even work at the College of Arms: Yes (although a large proportion of those fees also go to the artists and calligraphers who create the grant documents, as well as to the costs of maintaining the physical building of the College); that information is not published by the College; and yes (even though by ancient statute heralds are exempted from paying taxes on their income).\n\nShe also wanted to know how many grants Garter Woodcock has processed since his appointment on April 1, 2010.\n\nOn February 8, 2016, she received a reply from Garter:\n\nThe College of Arms is not a public authority under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and is therefore under no duty to consider your request.\n\nShe has since requested the College review of the handling of her FOI request, stating that \"the Royal Household [of which the College of Arms is a part] whilst not under any du[t]y does answer FOI requests.\"\n\nWell, I'm guessing here, but isn't it likely that only sometimes does the Royal Household answers FOI requests?\n\nMs. Jones doesn't say why she wants this information, or what she intends to do with it if she ever receives it. Not that it really matters; most of the information that she wants can be found with a little searching on the internet. For example, there's a blog post from 2007 by someone who worked at the College of Arms for a summer which discusses, among other things, some of the fee distribution among the heralds at that time, at http://blog.jackalopepursuivant.com/jackalopepursuivant/2007/08/best-of-jacka-5.html\n\nAnyway, you can find the full text of Ms. Jones' FOI request, the College's response, and Ms. Jones' request for review on-line at the website of What Do They Know at https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/thomas_woodcock_personal_renumer\n\nWhat Is It About Using Complex and/or Archaic Blazon?\n\nI've been trying to make good use of my \"extra\" \"free\" time now that I have retired, and have been working away at several projects I've wanted to do for some time.\n\nOne of those projects is a database, if you will, of heraldry used by Americans from colonial times until well into the 20th Century. I'm doing it mostly for my own heraldic research purposes; I thought it would be handy to have a listing that could be sorted alphabetically by surname or searched by the colors and charges on the shield, something that would be faster than looking through most of the books of American arms that I have, many of which are not arranged alphabetically (yes, I'm looking at you, John Matthews, and your Complete American Armoury and Blue Book).\n\nBut one of the things that's starting to annoy me a bit is the inconsistent usages in the blazons of all of these coats of arms. I'm not just talking about the sometimes confusing use of \"of the first,\" \"of the second,\" \"of the field\" that we often find in blazons. (This is, of course, an annoyance, requiring one to go back and re-parse the blazon to that point to try to determine what color is being referred to, and many times that color cannot be the correct one. I'll probably never understand why someone thought that repeating a tincture was such an awful thing to do, to the point that they were willing to surrender clarity to avoid it, but fortunately in these modern times that usage has been falling by the wayside until now, even the venerable College of Arms in London, of whom one of their own (Sir Conrad Swan) once said, \"The Kings of Arms tend to be rather like oil tankers sailing in a determined and serene manner through the ocean of life, and as a result they take a long time to change course,\" will go ahead and repeat a tincture in a blazon.)\n\nNo, I'm talking about the overuse of the comma by some of these authors, and the inclusion of archaic spellings for various terms of blazon.\n\nAs just one example of both of these, I offer the arms of Sullivan, cited in The Prominent Families of the United States of America, edited by Meredith Burke (1975):\n\nPer pale sable, and argent, a fesse between, in chief a boar passant and in base another counterpassant, all counterchanged, armed, hoofed, and bristled or.\n\nReally? \"Fesse?\" Sure, Guillim's A Display of Heraldrie, 4th ed., 1660, calls a horizontal stripe across the shield a fesse, but by 1795 in Porney's The Elements of Heraldry that charge has become a fess with but one \"e.\"\n\nAnd what is with all of those commas? I could argue that all, or if not all then nearly all, of them are entirely unnecessary to understanding the blazon. I could and would, also argue that a fess between two charges don't need them specified as \"in chief\" and \"in base\" since that is where you would expect two charges, one of either side of a fess, to be located. That's the joy of heraldic defaults.\n\nSo blazon ought to be clear and concise, but also complete. \"The fewer Words you make use of in Blazoning a Coat, the better it is Blazon’d. Be cautious however, that whilst you endeavour to be short, you are not mysterious, and that you omit nothing which ought to be mentioned.\" (Samuel Kent, The Banner Display’d: or, An Abridgment of Guillim, 1726, Vol. 1, p. 7)\n\nLet's try reblazoning the arms of Sullivan, above, and see if we can't make the blazon more concise while being just as clear:\n\nPer pale sable and argent a fess between two boars counter-passant counterchanged armed unguled and bristled or.\n\nWe might, if further clarity is felt to be necessary, blazon the boars as passant counter-passant, but one would think that counter-passant should suffice, just as \"combattant\" is a shorter way of saying \"rampant respectant\" and indicates as surely, and with fewer words, that the two animals are facing different directions.\n\nAnd yes, I know that I'm using the slightly lesser known - at least to the layman - term \"unguled\" for \"hoofed,\" but unguled is the more usual heraldic term when an animals hooves are a different color than its torso. Modern blazon continues to use \"langued\" instead of \"tongued,\" too, and both terms appear in every English-language heraldic dictionary I've found, so I don't see any reason to change \"unguled\" to \"hoofed.\"\n\nBut does anyone who understands blazon think that my reblazon of the Sullivan arms is less understandable than the version in Prominent Families? Seventeen words versus twenty-five words, and no archaic spellings or unneeded commas. Shorter, but \"not mysterious, ... omit[ting] nothing which ought to be mentioned.\"\n\nOkay, I'll get off my soapbox now. But after having typed in literally hundreds of such blazons, and in a few cases, not being able to figure out what the tincture \"of the third\" was really supposed to be (since the \"third\" tincture in the blazon would have been color on color), I'm really tired of all of these extraneous, unnecessary commas and archaic spellings (e.g., \"saltier,\" \"chequy\"). And no, I didn't keep them in the blazons in my database. Repeated tinctures when necessary, no commas when unnecessary, and standard spellings of all of the charges (\"saltire,\" \"checky\") wherever possible is what's being typed in. But it's been a long tough row to hoe, and I'm getting tired of it."
