        "text": "There have been seven baronetcies created for persons with the surname Parker, three in the Baronetage of England, two in the Baronetage of Great Britain and two in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. Two of the creations are extant as of 2008. Though none of the different families of baronets were related, several supplied a number of flag officers to the Royal Navy.\n\nThe Parker, later Parker-a-Morley-Long Baronetcy, of Arwaton in the County of Suffolk, was created in the Baronetage of England on 16 July 1661 for Philip Parker, Member of Parliament for Harwich and Sandwich. His grandson, the third Baronet, also represented Harwich in the House of Commons. He assumed the additional surnames of a-Morley-Long. The title became extinct on his death in 1741.\n\nThe Parker Baronetcy, of Ratton in the County of Sussex, was created in the Baronetage of England on 22 May 1674 for Robert Parker, Member of Parliament for Hastings.[1] The second Baronet was Member of Parliament for Sussex. The title became extinct in 1750, upon the death of the first Baronet's grandson, the third Baronet.[2]\n\nThe Parker Baronetcy, of Melford Hall in the County of Suffolk, was created in the Baronetage of England on 1 July 1681 for Hugh Parker, an alderman of London. On his death in 1697 the baronetcy descended by special remainder to his nephew, Henry Parker, then of Honington Hall near Stratford on Avon, Warwickshire, Member of Parliament for Evesham and Aylesbury. He married Margaret, daughter and heir of Alexander Hyde, Bishop of Salisbury, first cousin of Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon. The most famous member of the family was the naval commander Sir Hyde Parker, the fifth Baronet. His second son was Admiral Sir Hyde Parker. He was the father of the naval commander Admiral Hyde Parker and of John Boteler Parker, a major general in the British Army. The family seat is Melford Hall, Long Melford, Suffolk.\n\nThe Parker Baronetcy, of Bassingbourn in the County of Essex, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 13 January 1783 for Sir Peter Parker, also an eminent naval officer, though unrelated to the Parker family of Melford Hall. He was known for his service in the American Revolution. His grandson, Charles, the fifth Baronet, was also an Admiral in the Royal Navy. The title became extinct on his death in 1869.\n\nThe Parker Baronetcy, of Harburn in the County of Warwick, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 24 July 1797 for William Parker for his service at the Battle of Cape St Vincent. Though unrelated to the previous two, he also enjoyed a long naval career, retiring as a vice admiral. The baronetcy became extinct on the death of the sixth Baronet in 1903.\n\nThe Parker Baronetcy, of Shenstone Lodge in the County of Stafford, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 18 December 1844 for Sir William Parker, who like his distant relative the Earl of Macclesfield, was a descendant of the Parker family of Park Hall, Claverswall, Staffordshire[3] but unrelated to the other baronets. He, too, was a naval officer, and commanded British naval forces in China in the First Opium War. The third Baronet, William, was an Olympic medallist. George Parker, second son of the first Baronet, was an Admiral in the Royal Navy. The Right Honourable Sir Thomas Parker, grandfather of the first Baronet, was Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer."
