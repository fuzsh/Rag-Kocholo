        "text": "Dear Newsgroup ~\n\nThe information below on the Knapp family of Ipswich, Suffolk indicates\n\nthat Judith (Knapp) Hubbard's father, John Knapp, merchant and portman\n\nof Ipswich (#11 below), died 2 May 1604, and was buried at St. Peter's\n\nchurch in Ipswich, Suffolk. He left a will leaving among other\n\nbequests £200 apiece to his three youngest daughters, Judith, Dorcas,\n\nand Phebe; also after his wife, Martha's death, the said Judith,\n\nDorcas, and Phebe were to receive £100 from a house bequeathed to his\n\nwife, Martha, by testator, & houses, yards, gardens, etc. in St.\n\nPeter's, Ipswich.\n\nThus, it appears that Judith Knapp, wife of William Hubbard, was\n\nunmarried at the time of her father's will and presumably unmarried at\n\nhis death in 1604.\n\nBest always, Douglas Richardson, Salt Lake City, Utah\n\nWebsite: www. royalancestry.net\n\n+ + + + + + + + + +\n\nSource: Knapp Family Material, available online at\n\nhttp://72.14.203.104/search?q=cache:qicg71lWwaMJ:www.mauriceboddy.org.uk/mauriceboddy/Knapp.htm+Portman+Ipswich+Knapp&hl=en&gl=us&ct=clnk&cd=1\n\nKNAPP\n\nIn 1911 Oswald Greenwaye Knapp, M.A. wrote a book \"A History of the\n\nChief English Families bearing the Name of Knapp\". However the major\n\npart of this chapter has been based on research by Paul White, also\n\nwills and the published family pedigrees prepared in the 16th and 17th\n\nCenturies at the Herald's \"Visitations\".\n\n13. [KNAP571] William (-), as it is supposed, was married to Jilian\n\n(-1552), and they probably had only one child:\n\n12. Robert, see later.\n\nWilliam, as it is supposed, died and afterwards Jilian married 2.\n\nWilliam Aldham. William Aldham died at Brome (1540), and the\n\nbeneficiaries under his will included:\n\nJelian his wife -- (to receive 7 mylche keen, 6 yearlings, 2\n\ncalves, 20 sheep, swine, geese, capons and hens, wheat, corn & malt, 4\n\nspoons, household utensils and implements);\n\nRobert Knapp -- (13s. 4d, plus a further 10s. as one of the\n\nexecutors);\n\nJohn Knapp, son of Robert -- (10s.) [This John would have been\n\nthe John known as John the elder, implying that the later children of\n\nRobert were all born after this will was made (17th February 1740).\n\nJohn the elder was married prior to 1552, and in fact already had 2\n\nchildren by then, so was born presumably before 1530]\n\nWhen \"Gelyan\" died, the executor of her will was her son Robert Knappe\n\n(who had married Margaret Poley), and the several references therein to\n\n\"son's child\" etc mean \"Robert's child\". The chief beneficiaries were\n\nas follows:\n\nEdmund Knappe, son's child -- (£4);\n\nJohn the younger, son's child -- (£4);\n\nRobarde, son's child -- (£4);\n\nThomas, son's child -- (£4);\n\nMyrable Knappe, son's daughter -- (£6. 13s. 4d. at marriage;\n\nfeatherbed; 2 pairs of sheets);\n\nJohn Knappe, son's eldest son -- (20s);\n\nJoane, wife of John the eldest son -- (gown);\n\nJohn, child of John the eldest son -- (6s. 8d);\n\nRobard, child of John the eldest son -- (6s. 8d).\n\nThe only child of Robert not mentioned was George, presumably born\n\nafter the will was made (27th March 1552). All the other children were\n\nminors.\n\nIn accordance with the will of Jilian's second husband, William Aldham,\n\nthe beneficiaries included:\n\nJelian, wife -- (7 mylche keen, 6 yearlings, 2 calves, 20 sheep,\n\nswine, geese, capons & hens, gelding, wheat, corn & malt, 4 spoons,\n\nhousehold utensils & implements, 10 marks);\n\nRobert Knapp -- (13s. 4d);\n\nJohn Knapp, son of Robert -- (10s).\n\n12. [KNAP581] Robert (-1564) of Needham married 1. (perhaps 1535)\n\n[POLY581] Margaret Poley (-, see POLEY). They had seven children:\n\nJohn the elder (1530), married Joan. (Although John was a\n\nbeneficiary in Gelyan's will, his share was small. He also figured in\n\nRobert's will, see later. However he does not appear in the Pedigree\n\nlisting, so it would appear he was perhaps illegitimate);\n\nEdmund (1540, based on age 69 when died in 1609), \"son & heir\",\n\nmarried 1. (1562) Bridget Munninges; then 2. (1568) Elizabeth Woodock;\n\n11. John the younger (1543), \"2nd son\", see later;\n\nRobert (1546), \"3rd son\", married Christian Browne;\n\nThomas (1548), \"4th son\", was a merchant in Ipswich (died 1631);\n\nMyrable (1550), married (1563) Robert Hovel alias Smith of\n\nAshfield;\n\nGeorge (1553), \"youngest son\".\n\nMargaret died, and afterwards Robert married 2. (at Wetheringsett, July\n\n1560) Ann Horsman, widow. Robert, an Esquire, died at Wetheringsett\n\n(will made September 1563, proved May 1564.) A special request in his\n\nwill was that \"No child of mine to benefit by my will if he sues my\n\nexecutors for any legacy given to him by my late mother Jilian Aldame\".\n\nThis clause may have something to do with his son \"John the elder\".\n\nThe chief beneficiaries of Robert's will were as follows:\n\nAnne his wife, late widow of Robert Horseman -- (£10 annuity for\n\nlife from lands and tenements called Studdes in Needham & Barking, and\n\nafter Anne's death this passes to John the younger; £5 annuity for\n\nlife from lease of Bishoppes Hall in Battisford, and after Anne's\n\ndeath this annuity passes to son George; close called Buttoler\n\ncontaining 6.5 acres purchased of Anthony Lockwood);\n\nJohn the younger, son -- (tenement and land called The Fenn with\n\none close called Pond Closse in towns and fields of Barking, Creeting,\n\nBattisford & Badley; featherbed; quarter of residue);\n\nRobert, son -- (lands & tenements called Bungeons & hawl in towns\n\nof Barking, Creeting & Battisford, free & copyhold; meadow called\n\nGruchin in Barking; lease in Northey; lands, tenements, woods &\n\nunderwoods purchased of Robert Colchester the younger; featherbed;\n\nquarter of residue);\n\nThomas, son -- (lands in Coddenham called The Pole; after 10\n\nyears, meadow in Creeting purchased of Mr Alnutt; featherbed; quarter\n\nof residue);\n\nJohn the elder, son -- (lands in Needham field & lands in\n\nBosberowe, free & copyhold; lease of Bosberowe);\n\nGeorge, son (under 21) -- (lands & tenements purchased of Henry\n\nAylin called Masons, Kings & Collyers in Battisford & Combes; best bed;\n\nquarter of residue);\n\nchildren of John the elder -- (6s. 8d. when 21);\n\nMirable, daughter -- (copper cauldron).\n\n11. [KNAP591] John the younger (1543-1604) of Ipswich, married\n\n[BLOS591] Martha Blosse (-, see BLOSSE). He was a merchant and portman\n\nof Ipswich, where they had eleven children:\n\nJohn, died young;\n\n10. John, \"2nd son & heir\", see later;\n\nThomas, married Katharine Barker;\n\nMargaret, married John Barron of Essex;\n\nMary, married John Randes of Ipswich;\n\nMartha, married James Palmer a draper of London (mentioned\n\nlater);\n\nElizabeth, married 1. Thomas Woodgate of Ipswich; then 2. Revd.\n\nRichard Holmested of Dinington, Norfolk;\n\nAnne, married (1605) Newman Rookes of London;\n\nJudith, married William Hobart of Essex;\n\nDorcas, married (at Belstead 1612) Revd. Robert Stansbye;\n\nPhebe, remained unmarried.\n\nJohn purchased New Place in Stoke, near Ipswich, from Edward Sulyard\n\n(September 1576), where the family afterwards resided. John died at\n\nIpswich (May 1604). There was a plaque to John in St. Peter's Church,\n\nIpswich. The description in \"County Churches: Suffolk\" by T. Hugh\n\nBryant (1912) reads:\n\nIn the South aisle is a brass bearing the effigies of a civilian in\n\nruff and fur-lined gown, and his wife in calash and embroidered\n\npetticoat; there are groups of 4 sons, two of them in cloaks, and 8\n\ndaughters, five of them in hats, shield, and mantling, and inscription\n\nto John Knapp, merchant and portman, 1604, and Martha his wife.\n\nThe inscription on the brass itself reads:\n\nHERE LYETH THE BODY OF IOHN KNAPP MARCHAT\n\nAND PORTMAN OF THIS TOWNE OF IPSWICH WHO\n\nDYED YE SECOND DAY OF MAYE ANNO 1604 AND HAD\n\nISSVE BY MARTHA HIS WIFE 4 SONES & 8 DAVGHTERS\n\nThe Knapp coat of arms above the brass has \"three close helmets above a\n\nlion passant\".\n\nBy John's will, the beneficiaries included:\n\nMartha his wife -- (house in occupation of testator, & houses, yards,\n\ngardens, etc. in St. Peter's Ipswich, and after Martha's death this\n\npasses to daughter Mary and her husband John Randes; also tenement in\n\noccupation of Robert Barwicke, in St. Mary Key [viz St. Mary-at-Quay,\n\nIpswich], and after Martha's death this passes to son Thomas; also\n\nlands & houses in Stoke next Ipswich, free & copyhold, and after\n\nMartha's death this passes to son John; also house & lands called\n\n\"Parnells\" in Ipswich, Kesgrave, Rushmere & Playford, and this passes\n\nto son Thomas when he is 21; also rent from rent charge purchased of\n\nRobert Sampson, esqr, at Netherhall, in Harsteed, Suffolk.

(2) by about 1661 Ezekiel Rogers (eldest known child b. about 1661 [EQC\n\n6:345; NEHGR 5:316-17]). (In her will of 22 June 1678, Margaret Rogers,\n\nwidow, referred to the estate of \"my son Tho[mas] Scott to which I am\n\nexecutrix\" [EQC 9:227-28]. On 15 April 1684, in a dispute over the estate of\n\nThomas Scott, son of Thomas and Margaret (Hubbard) Scott, \"William Hubbard\n\nand Mary Hubbard testified . that they saw the will and Thomas had left\n\neverything to his mother, who was at the time the widow of deponent's\n\nbrother Ezekiel Rogers\" [EQC 9:224].)\n\nASSOCIATIONS: In his will William Hubbard refers to land which he \"purchased\n\nof my cousin John Brown,\" but the exact manner in which these two men were\n\ncousins has not been discovered. There may be a further clue to this\n\nrelationship in a court case of 29 September 1657, in which John Allen\n\ndeposed that \"he saw Edmond Bridges at Mr. Hubbard's house two or three\n\ntimes this summer; and saw his unseemly carriages towards Mary Browne\" [EQC\n\n2:54].\n\nCOMMENTS: In his will William Hubbard bequeathed to two of his sons land in\n\n\"Tendring Hundred\" and \"Dover Court.\" Tendring and Dovercourt are parishes\n\nin the easternmost end of Essex, Tendring Hundred being a grouping of\n\nparishes which includes Tendring. Based on this clue, Winifred Lovering\n\nHolman undertook research in Tendring, Great Clacton and Little Clacton. The\n\nonly useful item was obtained from the vicar of Little Clacton, who reported\n\nthat \"William Hubbard the son of Firgard(?) and Susan his wife of Bovells\n\nHall was baptized the fifth day of September 1589\" [TAG 11:120]. (The name\n\nof the father, which the vicar could not read, might be Richard.) This might\n\npossibly be the baptismal record for the immigrant, but more evidence is\n\nneeded.\n\nIf we take the ages on the 1635 passenger list at face value, then William\n\nHubbard must have had two wives. His wife Judith, aged twenty-five in 1635,\n\ncould have been the mother only of the two youngest children entered on the\n\npassenger list, Nathaniel and Richard. The existence of two wives is\n\nsupported by the apparent gap of seven years between sons William and\n\nNathaniel.\n\nAges entered in the London Port Books are, however, notoriously unreliable,\n\nwhich leads us to make two observations. First, if the age for Judith should\n\nhave been forty-five rather than twenty-five, then she could have been\n\nmother of all the children, and William Hubbard would have had only one\n\nwife. In the absence of further evidence, we retain the interpretation in\n\nwhich she was twenty-five, and Hubbard had two wives. Second, if the age of\n\nWilliam Hubbard, given as fifty, is only an approximation, then he could be\n\nthe William baptized at Little Clacton in 1589. This would make him about\n\ntwenty-four at the birth of his first known child.\n\nThe record of William Hubbard's service as deputy to the General Court and\n\njudge at the Essex courts leads to some interesting observations. First,\n\nWilliam Hubbard was returned to these two offices repeatedly from 1638 to\n\n1660. Initially Hubbard sat only on the Ipswich bench, but beginning in 1654\n\nhe served on courts held at both Salem and Ipswich. There is a gap in\n\nservice at both levels. He was not a deputy between 1646 and 1656, and there\n\nis no record of him as a judge from 1648 to 1653. The gap in county service\n\nmay not be real, as the records are not complete for this period. The\n\nten-year gap in service as a deputy is real, but remains unexplained.\n\nSecond, the public service of William Hubbard ended rather abruptly, his\n\nlast appearance as a deputy being on 30 May 1669, and as a judge on 25\n\nSeptember 1660. Less than two years later, on 24 June 1662, William Hubbard\n\nhad removed his residence from Ipswich to Boston. The reason for the\n\ncessation of service is not hard to find, as he would have been about\n\nseventy-five years old in 1660. From his very brief inventory, we see that,\n\naside from his landholdings in old England and in Ipswich, he owned nothing\n\nbut his clothes. He owned no real estate in Boston. Apparently in his old\n\nage he went to Boston to live quietly with his eldest daughter, the\n\ntwice-widowed Martha (Hubbard) (Whittingham) Eyre.\n\nOn 21 June 1637, \"W[illiam] Hubbard\" signed the petition of Ipswich\n\ninhabitants in favor of keeping John Winthrop Jr. as a resident of Ipswich\n\n[WP 3:432-33]. On 6 September 1639, Rev. Hugh Peter reported to Gov. John\n\nWinthrop that \"[w]e are just now about meeting Mr. Hubbard and 3 more of\n\nIpswich to sell your son's Castle Hill to them, but you would wonder to see\n\ntheir dodging. If they have it they must pay for it in some measure else it\n\nwere more honorable for him to give it\" [WP 4:140].\n\nOn 1 October 1645, \"Mr. Willi[am] Hubbard\" and six other prominent men of\n\nEssex County successfully petitioned the General Court to be \"established .\n\nas a free company of adventurers\" for trade with the Indians [MBCR 2:138-39,\n\n3:53-54].\n\nIn his will of 25 March 1672, \"William Whittingham late of Boston ., gent.,\"\n\nfirst made bequests to his five children (sons Richard and William and\n\ndaughters Mary, Elisabeth and Martha), and then made the following\n\narrangements: \"£163 due unto my uncle Nathaniell Hubbard of London,\n\ngentleman,\" to be paid out of rents (with reference to \"my brother Richard\n\nWhittingham, gentleman, deceased\"); debts contracted \"upon the account of my\n\nbrother-in-law John Clarke of Boston in New England aforesaid, gentleman,\"\n\nto be repaid, \"together with the annuity due unto my mother Mrs. Martha Eire\n\nfor her natural life\"; to \"my brother John Clarke of Boston aforesaid,\n\ngentleman, all his proportion of debts\"; refers to \"James Whetcomb of Boston\n\naforesaid, gentleman,\" his business partner; to \"my cousins Mary Hubbart &\n\nAnne Hubbert, daughters of my said uncle Hubbert,\" £5 each; \"my trusty &\n\nwell beloved friend my father-in-law John Lawrence of New York in America,\n\ngentleman, William Hubbert of Ipswich in New England aforesaid, gent., my\n\nsaid uncle Nathaniell Hubbert of London, gent., & John Lewine of London,\n\nEsq.,\" to be executors [SPR 7:224].\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHIC NOTE: In 1934 Winifred Lovering Holman published a brief\n\narticle on the results of her searches in the parish registers of three\n\nEssex parishes: Tendring, Great Clacton and Little Clacton [TAG 11:120].\n\n\"Douglas Richardson\" <royala...@msn.com> wrote in message\n\nnews:1146663124....@i39g2000cwa.googlegroups.com...\n\n"
