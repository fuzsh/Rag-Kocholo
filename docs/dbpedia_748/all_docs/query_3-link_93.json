They were James Coston b. 1798 , (not known where) and his 1st wife was Sophia, born 1791 (not known where) She died in 1817. They had two children.\n\nMaria 1814-1814 and John 1816-1837, both born Henham. James remarried to Hannah and they lived in Pledgdon Green. They had Mary Ann b. 1819, Emma b. 1822, William, b 1824, James b 1827, Joseph, b 1827, William James , b,1831 . Mary Ann Coston born,1819 Pledgdon, married William Snow, b. 1817 Elsenham. My Coston and Snow families go back a long ways.\n\nMy great grandparents came to Canada about 1875, they were William Coston, born 1851, Pledgdon Green and Emma Louisa Snow, born 1860 Henham. William came to Canada first and Emma came later, and they were married in Canada and remained here.\n\nEditor’s notes: The Coston family are mentioned in the 1841 and 1861 Census Returns. It is interesting to note there are also Costin in the same village, this maybe a corrupted spelling of the name on documents.\n\nCOWELL\n\nBill Cowell from Kansas advises us –\n\nMany generations ago, our Cowell family lived in Ashdon, Thaxted and finally my great-great-grandparents Peter & Sarah Cowell lived at the Great Hyde Farm, Little Bardfield. They later moved to Henham Lodge, and my great-grandfather Ebenezer Cowell took over the farm until he moved to Midsummer Hill near Ashdon and finally to America. His brother Jasper was a farmer, preacher and architect, and was the first of our family to move to America. His wife passed away and he left six children and returned to England. He married again, and his second wife did not want to come to America. So, he persuaded my great-grandfather Ebenezer to come and take over the farm where I grew up. My grand-father Thomas Cowell was born at Henham Lodge, and I’m quite sure most of Ebenezer and Martha Perry’s family was born there.\n\nEbenezer and Martha Perry Cowell had nine children as follows : –\n\nEdwin born 05.09.1862; died 1946 in Brooklyn, NY\n\nAnnie born 22.10.1863; died 19.09.1888; married Charles Moutell\n\nAgnes born 01.01.1865; died 31.10.1928; married Nathaniel Dring, and Alfred Manning (after Nathaniel’s death)\n\nWilliam born 29.09.1866; died 03.01.1951; married Helen Adams, and later Roberta Clarkson (after Helen’s death)\n\nKate born 05.01.1868; died 21.07.1929; married Charles Howison\n\nThomas born 18.05.1869; died 17.09. 1964; married Edith Amy Adams\n\nAlbert Ebenezer (twin of Thomas) born 18.05.1869; died 06.06.1870\n\nAda born 15.12.1870; died October 1969; married Jim Boyse\n\nEmma born 02.02.1873; died 1962; married William Starling\n\nEbenezer, Martha & family, with the exception of Edwin, moved to America in December 1884. Edwin later came as far as Brooklyn NY. When the Cowell family came to America, the James Yarrow family came along, and the two families have been very close here in America. The Yarrows lived in the red brick house where the lane starts to Henham Lodge.\n\nBill also advised us of the find in 1848 of Roman, Samian & Greyware pottery in Hall Field at Henham Lodge Farm and which was given to Saffron Walden Museum in 1891 by Mrs Susannah Cowell. She was an active member of the British Women’s Temperance Association and was buried in Little Sampford churchyard.\n\nDALTON\n\nAlexander DALTON, son of Edward and Sary Dalton chr. 3 Apr 1648 at Henham, Essex\n\nEdward DALTON, son of Edward and Sary Dalton chr. 3 Apr 1648 at Henham, Essex\n\nDAWKINS\n\nThomas DAWKINS born 17 December 1847 Margaret Roothing, Essex; m. Eliza Neville 17 September 1865 in the parish church, Bromley. She was the daughter of George Neville & Mary Chooling & born 2 February 1842 in Henham, Essex.\n\nDAY\n\nCharles DAY born Matching c. 1830 & Susan born 1832 in Henham, Essex. They married in 1854\n\nDENNIS /DENNISON\n\nDENNISON – John and James DENNISON born circa 1795 in Henham (?). There is a record of a John Dennison born Henham. Essex 1798.\n\nDIXON\n\nGeorge Dixon born in Thaxted, in 1832. His Father was William EVERITT, bootmaker. George married Laura Matilda Christiana BROWN, in 1871. They had Emma Elizabeth Gertrude EVERITT, 1875, in Henham, Essex. George was both a shoemaker and publican.\n\nJoshua Dixon was baptized on 7 January 1770 in Henham, Essex.\n\nHe … Brighton. She had an illegitimate son John Dixon born about 1839.\n\n3 x Great Grandmother was Sophia Dixon who married a William Spicerin 1829 in Brighton, Sussex. She was born there in 1809 and was the daughter of Joshua Dixon and Jane Smith, who had married in 1804 in Guildford, Surrey. He was born in 1769 in Henham, Essex to John Dixon and Susanna Brand\n\nPhilip Dixon\n\n1805-1867, possibly born in Henham. He was Publican at The Bell, Henham at one time, and had a son Levi who married Esther Clarke. She was born in 1839 born 1835. Another record says a Philip Dixon was born in 1805 in Wendon, nr. Audley, Essex and died 1867 in Henham, Essex.\n\nRichard Dixon and Ann had 7 known children: Henham. Essex\n\nDon Dixon Don died on 6th Nov 2007. Together with his wife Freda, he gave us so much support in sharing his knowledge of local history and affairs. In recent years they, at the drop of a hat, generously assisted our hosting many visiting families researching their own Henham ancestors.\n\nEVE\n\nJoseph EVE & Elizabeth Moor married in 1706 at Henham, Essex\n\nFARRINGTON\n\nFITZWALTER\n\nElizabeth of Dinham, Baroness b.1430 – Henham, Essex, England\n\nJohn born 1320, Essex, England\n\nMaude born 1081 – of, Clifford Castle, Herefordshire, England\n\nRobert born 1256 – of, Henham, Essex, England\n\nRobert born 1294 – of, Henham, Essex, England\n\nRobert born 1165 – of, Dunmow, Essex, England\n\nWalter, Baron, born 1400 – Henham, Essex, England\n\nWalter born 1210 – , Dunmow, Essex, England\n\nWalter, Baron, born 1368 – Henham, Essex, England\n\nWalter, Baron, c.1345 – Henham, Essex, England\n\nCHIDEOCK\n\nElizabeth b.1404 – of, Henham, Essex, England\n\nJohn, Sir, b.1375 – Chideock, Dorset, England\n\nJohn, Sir, b.1349 – Chideock, Dorset, England\n\nFitz Walter, Lord\n\nFitzwalter- born: abt. 22 Jun 1401 at: Woodham Walter,\n\nFather: Fitz Walter, Lord Fitzwalter (1368-1407), Mother: Joan D’Evereux – (abt 1380-1409), Married:\n\nHenham, Essex,\n\nChildren – Elizabeth Fitzwalter, Baroness Dinham- AKA: Elizabeth Fitzwalter Born: 28 Jul 1430 at Henham, Essex, Christened: at: Henham, Essex, Died: Between Jun 1485 And Aug 1483:\n\nSpouse: Lord, John Dinham, Baron Dinham, Lord Treasurer (1434-1501) marr: 15 Mar 1469, of, Woodford, Northamptonshire,\n\nSpouse: John Radcliffe (abt 1426-1461) Marr: Bef 27 Oct 1444, of, Woodhouse, Walter, Essex,\n\nRobert (John) RADCLIFFE (Sir) Born: ABT 1430, Died: 28 Mar 1461, Ferrybridge (in battle)\n\nMarried: Elizabeth FITZWALTER (b. 28 Jul 1430, Henham – d.
