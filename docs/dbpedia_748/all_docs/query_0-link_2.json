        "text": "Barkers History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland-Alt\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nScotland\n\nThe name Barkers is from the ancient Anglo-Saxon tribes of Britain. The name was given to a person who was a person who stripped trees of bark for tanning. \"It is confined to the northern half of England and to the eastern counties north of the Thames. It is very frequent in Yorkshire, and is also well represented in the counties of Derby, Lincoln, and Norfolk.\" 1\n\nThe name evolved from \"from the trade or occupation of 'barker,' an obsolete name for the bark-stripper or rather for the man who prepared the bark for the tanner. Later the word was synonymous with 'tanner.' \" 2\n\n\"A tanner, from his using bark of trees in his trade. In the old ballad of the King and the Tanner in Percy's Reliques, the latter calls himself \"a Barker, Sir, by my trade.\" English Sum. Barcarius and Le Barkere.\" 3\n\nEarly Origins of the Barkers family\n\nThe surname Barkers was first found in Yorkshire where Ralph Berker was a Knights Templar in 1185. A few years later, Aluredus le berkier was found the in the Pipe Rolls for Lincolnshire in 1193. Later again, John le Bercher was recorded in the Curia Regis Rolls for Hampshire in 1212. Jordan le Barker was found in the Assize Rolls for Essex in 1255 and John le Barker was listed in the Assize Rolls for Cambridgeshire in 1260. 4 The previous entries that include \"le\", meaning \"the\", point the the occupational nature of the name as by example, \"John the Barker.\"\n\nAnother source notes, Alan le Barkere who was listed there in the Hundredorum Rolls of 1273. The same rolls listed Robert Barcarius in Lincolnshire. 5\n\nEarly records in Scotland include: \"Patrick Bercar and his son [who] held land in Dunipace c. 1200. Alisaundre le Barker, provost of the burgh of Haddington, rendered homage in 1296 [to King Edward I of England]. Richard le Barker of Tyningham, tenant of the bishop of St. Andrews in the county of Edneburk also rendered homage in the same year. Thomas Barkar in the parish of Fyvy was excommunicated in 1382, William Barcar held a land in Edinburgh in 1400, and Alexander Barcare was vicar of the parish of Pettinain in 1486.\" 2\n\nEarly History of the Barkers family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Barkers research. Another 317 words (23 lines of text) covering the years 1273, 1577, 1600, 1609, 1619, 1623, 1635, 1652, 1655, 1664, 1678, 1679, 1680, 1685, 1696, 1698, 1700, 1702, 1708, 1715, 1722, 1731, 1734, 1739, 1749, 1774, 1788, 1793, 1804, 1806, 1808 and 1809 are included under the topic Early Barkers History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nBarkers Spelling Variations\n\nSound was what guided spelling in the essentially pre-literate Middle Ages, so one person's name was often recorded under several variations during a single lifetime. Also, before the advent of the printing press and the first dictionaries, the English language was not standardized. Therefore, spelling variations were common, even among the names of the most literate people. Known variations of the Barkers family name include Barker, Barkers, Barkes, Barkess, Barkere, Barkar and others.\n\nEarly Notables of the Barkers family\n\nDistinguished members of the family include Sir Christopher Barker, a distinguished British diplomat and court official in the 16th century; Sir John Barker, 1st Baronet (c.1609-c. 1652); and his son, Sir John Barker, 2nd Baronet (c.1635-1664); and his son, Sir John Barker, 4th Baronet (1655-1696), an English Baronet and politician, Member of Parliament for Ipswich (1680-1696); and his son, Sir William...\n\nAnother 60 words (4 lines of text) are included under the topic Early Barkers Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nMigration of the Barkers family to Ireland\n\nSome of the Barkers family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt.\n\nAnother 70 words (5 lines of text) about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nMigration of the Barkers family\n\nFor political, religious, and economic reasons, thousands of English families boarded ships for Ireland, the Canadas, the America colonies, and many of smaller tropical colonies in the hope of finding better lives abroad. Although the passage on the cramped, dank ships caused many to arrive in the New World diseased and starving, those families that survived the trip often went on to make valuable contributions to those new societies to which they arrived. Investigation of the origins of family names on the North American continent has revealed that early immigrants bearing the name Barkers or a variant listed above: Edmund Barker, who sailed to Maine in 1625; Alice Barker to Virginia in 1648; Samuel Barker to West New Jersey in 1664; Elizabeth Barker to Barbados in 1669.\n\nRelated Stories +\n\nThe Barkers Motto +\n\nThe motto was originally a war cry or slogan. Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Fide sed cui vide\n\nMotto Translation: Trust, but in whom take care.\n\nCitations +\n\nGuppy, Henry Brougham, Homes of Family Names in Great Britain. 1890.
