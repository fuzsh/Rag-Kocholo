        "text": "Introduction\n\nAllogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the treatment of choice for a variety of hematologic malignancies, but only 20–30% of the patients in need of HSCT are expected to have a suitable donor in the family.1 Conversely, the probability of success of a bone marrow- or peripheral blood-matched unrelated donor search is related to ethnicity, and is limited by stringent matching criteria. Furthermore, delays intrinsic to the search process may impact decidedly in the outcome of transplantation for diseases at high risk of relapse or progression. Using mismatched unrelated donors may increase the donor pool, but this type of transplant carries a high risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and severely impaired immune recovery.\n\nUmbilical cord blood (UCB) provides an alternative to mismatched hematopoietic grafts.2 Cord blood (CB) procurement is fast and there are reports indicating a reduced incidence of severe GVHD.3, 4, 5 Interestingly, lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells from CB have been shown to have higher apoptotic-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro, when compared to bone marrow-derived LAK cells. This provides one of the potential explanations for preserved graft-versus-leukemia effect with this type of graft,6, 7 which contains a small number of lymphocytes.\n\nThe major limitation of the use of UCB transplantation for adults is the relatively small number of hematopoietic stem cells. This problem is associated with high rates of early treatment-related mortality (TRM) owing to delayed engraftment. In order to overcome this barrier, we investigated a strategy by which patients without higher priority donors were to be transplanted with an unrelated CB unit that should contain at least 2 × 107 total nucleated cells (TNCs)/kg of recipient weight. If one unit containing that cell number was not available, a second unit had to be added in order to achieve that target. Here, we report the results of a phase II trial that enrolled heavily pretreated patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies that was prematurely interrupted owing to high rates of engraftment failure and excessive mortality.\n\nDiscussion\n\nLong-term follow-up of our small cohort of heavily pretreated patients showed a 4-year survival rate of approximately 33% for patients in remission. The early mortality and engraftment failure rates were deemed excessive and led to premature trial discontinuation.\n\nThere are several potential explanations for these results. The most important variable was disease status at transplantation, associated with extensive prior treatment and poor tolerance to transplant-associated toxicities, factors that likely increased TRM. Here, selection of relatively large CB units with a median total infused nucleated cell count/kg of 3.2 × 107 did not impact early mortality, as observed in other series.10, 11 Use of CB units containing TNC doses below 1–1.5 × 107 is associated with high rates of engraftment failure, and accordingly, we attempted combination of units in three cases in order to optimize the cell dose. Despite our approach, we observed a high rate of primary engraftment failure. It is possible that a diagnosis of CML was an added risk factor in two of our cases as it has been suggested.11 In the multicenter Cord Blood Transplantation (COBLT) study, 34% of the adult patients failed to achieve donor hematopoiesis.12 Comparisons of published results are sometimes difficult to perform given that definitions of engraftment failure differ in the literature, but it is commonly accepted that lack of neutrophil recovery by day 42 indicates a very low likelihood of success. The competing risk of death before engraftment is frequently not taken into consideration, an approach that makes the interpretation of the data very difficult and subject to biases.\n\nOur 100-day mortality rate of 40% was similar to that observed in the COBLT study, which reported a 100-day survival probability of 0.47, with approximately 17% of the patients alive after 12 months.12 Similarly, Sanz et al.13 reported a 100-day TRM of 43% in a cohort of 22 adults (median age of 29 years) with hematologic malignancies. All patients with acute leukemia were in complete remission, whereas most of the CML patients were in chronic phase, comprising a better risk group. Lower 100-day mortality has been reported by several single-center studies.14, 15 The Minnesota group transplanted 23 patients with a median age of 24 years and observed a 6-month TRM of 22%.14 Although these results may indicate the influence of growing experience using this source of stem cells, one cannot underestimate the effect of patient selection on outcomes.\n\nAt the time our trial was initiated, we allowed the use of units with three HLA mismatches. Such degree of donor–recipient mismatch is now a well-known risk factor for poor survival.11 Three patients were so treated (combined with another unit in one instance). Therefore, the degree of matching contributed to the poor results. Another potential criticism is our GVHD prophylaxis that employed ‘mini’ methotrexate. There is evidence that this drug may contribute to excess mortality, at least when used in higher doses than the ones employed here. Interestingly, the combination of tacrolimus and mini-methotrexate has been used without excessive toxicity in the pediatric setting.16\n\nFludarabine and melphalan was the preparative regimen in four cases. One patient engrafted, whereas three patients did not. In light of these results, we cannot recommend the use of this regimen in this setting. Other groups have however reported improved results using a reduced-intensity approach to reduce TRM.17, 18 High-dose ATG was part of our conditioning regimens, but its use to improve engraftment and possibly decrease the incidence of GVHD is controversial. This drug has been reported to delay immune recovery, and we are currently using significantly reduced doses.19\n\nOnly three of our nine engrafted patients developed acute GVHD without visceral involvement, whereas one patient died of chronic GVHD. Again, the competing risk of early mortality owing to infections and toxicity makes this low rate difficult to interpret. In the COBLT study, GVHD was the leading cause of death.12\n\nHow can these results be improved? Cell dose is critical. It is unclear, however, if doubling the cell dose by combining two units, for example, will be enough to improve outcomes. At this point, there are no controlled studies comparing double versus single CB transplants. Another approach that we are currently investigating involves ex vivo expansion of CB progenitor cells, in an attempt to circumvent cell dose-related problems.20, 21, 22\n\nCB carries the potential to extend hematopoietic transplantation to a variety of patients otherwise not eligible for this form of treatment. However, our results would indicate that high-risk patients have an increased probability of TRM even with the use of units containing higher TNC counts, and that treatment of relapsed patients should only be pursued under controlled clinical trials."
