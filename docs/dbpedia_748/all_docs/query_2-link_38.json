        "text": "SHIAWASSEE COUNTY, MICHIGAN\n\nBiographies - B\n\nJohn BARKER\n\nJohn Barker is a native of Cayuga county, New York, and was born April 13, 1838. He is a son of Orlando Barker, a Vermonter, who died at the age of forty-four years, in New York state, and of Catherine (Eadie) Barker, who was born in Mohawk county, New York, and who died in the same state at the age of seventy-four years. The subject of this sketch was quite young when his father died. It was necessary for him, therefore to begin work at an early age, to help support the rest of the family, - a labor of love he did manfully, this giving practical evidence of his duty to his widowed mother, who was enabled to exclaim \"Thanks to the gods! my boy has done his duty.\" He remained at home until twenty-two years of age, when he began working on the Erie canal, thus continuing for three years. In 1855 he came to Michigan, and worked in saw mills near Dearborn, about nine years. While there he was married to Harriett Bemiss, in 1857. She was born in Shiawassee county, December 14, 1840. Her parents, the names of whom she cannot give, were early settlers in that country. Mrs. Barker is now dead, She had six children, two of whom died in infancy: Albert, who was born March 1, 1864, married Carrie Dean, and they live in Saginaw county, having two children; Nettie, born October 2, 1866, married John Spitlee, and they live in Rush township; Frank, born September 15, 1868, married Lillie Davis and they live in Genesee county, where he is a farmer, their children being five in number; Lester, born September 30, 1880, is single, and is a t home.\n\nIn 1864, Mr. Barker came to Rush township and bought forty acres of land, five acres of which had been plowed, and a log house had been built. The country was then in its primitive state, all woods and few neighbors. Mr. Barker has since bought forty acres adjoining his first purchase, and has cleared it all, the whole being now under a high state of cultivation. He has a large brick house, built twelve years ago. For two years he occupied the log house found on the place when he bought it. He then built another log structure. This he lived in until twelve years ago, when he removed from the old into the new. He has fine barns and other buildings. His son Lester lives at home and assists in working the place. He bought eighty acres of wild land in Saginaw county, and this he has converted into a good farm; his son Albert lives on the same. Mr. Barker has always been engaged in general farming, and for several years dealt quite extensively in sheep and cattle. He is a Republican in politics, but has never been an office-seeker, nor held any office save that of a member of the school board. He served on the board of review of his township for 1904. He formerly attended the Baptist church, but is not a member. He is a member of the Grange. His grandfather, Christopher Eadie, was a solder in the Mexican war. Mr. Barker's father owned a farm of thirty-five acres in New York state, where he always lived. He was a Whig in politics.\n\nMr. John Barker died on 10 Apr 1913 and is buried in RIVERSIDE CEMETERY in Henderson\n\nSource: Past and present of Shiawassee County, Michigan, historically : together with biographical sketches of many of its leading and prominent citizens and illustrious dead, Lansing Michigan, Michigan Historical Publishing Association, 1906\n\nAllen BEARD\n\nAllen Beard was born in Ontario Co., N.Y. Jan. 11, 1810. His father, Jesse Beard, was a native of Maryland, born Feb. 8, 1787, and his death occurred March 21, 1864. His mother, Martha (Blake) Beard, was born in Saratoga Co., N.Y., Aug. 9, 1790. Allen remained with his parents until he was twenty-one years of age, when he married, March 10, 1831, Miss Hannah Arnet, who was born Sept. 2, 1810. Mr. Beard, the first year after his marriage, worked land \"on shares.\" At the expiration of that time he sold his interest or bargain, and had remaining three hundred dollars. It was just at the time when the tide of emigration westward had set in. He, with a team and wagon bearing his family, came to Cuyahoga Co., Ohio. Here he remained eighteen months and worked a farm, but not being successful, came on to Michigan, reaching Lodi, Washtenaw Co., April 25, 1836, and on May 28th came to the farm where he still resides. He was accompanied to the township by his brother-in-law, Lyman Melvin, who located a farm adjoining the one entered by Mr. Beard. Having previously traded his horses for three yoke of oxen, Mr. Beard sold one yoke, in order to pay for his first eighty acres of land, but found that he still lacked four dollars of the necessary amount. He then hauled a load of goods from Detroit to Borneo, for which he received sixteen dollars, and another to Ann Arbor, receiving for this twenty-four dollars. After this he removed to his land in Antrim township. During the winter of 1836-37 he built a house, and moved into it in April, 1837, previous to that time having resided in a house built by his brother-in-law and himself. On Aug. 26, 1843, his wife, Mrs. Hannah Beard, died. They were the parents of the following children: Martha B., born April 1, 1832; Byron, born Dec. 1, 1835; Charles F., born Sept. 21, 1838; Marietta A., born April 23, 1841. Charles F. was killed in battle at Campbell's Station, Tenn., Nov. 12, 1863.\n\nAfter a lapse of five years from the death of his first wife, Mr. Beard married Miss Charlotte Thompson, who was born April 13, 1828/ To this marriage were born eight children, as follows, viz.: Allen, born Nov. 13, 1848; died Dec. 13, 1855; Joshua, born April 14, 1850; died Dec. 5, 1855; Walter, born Sept. 10, 1851; died Sept. 13, 1858; Alvira, born Jan. 12, 1854; died Oct. 21, 1858, John C.; Abraham L., born April 16, 1860; Sarah Etta, born Feb. 8, 1864; George W., born Nov. 28, 1867. Mr. Beard was formerly a Whig in politics, subsequently became a Republican, but is now a Democrat. He has added to the eighty acres which he first purchased until he is now the possessor of one of the largest and finest farms in the township, consisting of five hundred and eighty-five acres.\n\nMr. Allen Beard died on 12 Feb 1895 and is buried in BEARD CEMETERY in Antrim Center.

Philadelphia\n\nJudge Matthew BUSH\n\nSince the year 1889, Judge Bush has held the office of probate judge in Shiawassee county. There is only one other probate judge in the state whose length of service is longer. The re-election of Judge Bush for one term after another, is in itself conclusive evidence of the confidence of the citizenship in his official integrity and capability, and in the administration of the many delicate and important duties entrusted to the office his work has always been of the character and value to the community. Judge Bush has been an active member of the Shiawassee county bar, for more than thirty years, and he and his son are now among the leading law firms in the county seat of Corunna.\n\nJudge Matthew Bush was born in Ulster county, New York, December 6, 1853. His parents, Peter M. and Eleanor (Mayes) Bush, natives of New York, settled in Michigan in 1867, where the father was a prosperous and influential farmer until his death in 1877. The mother passed away in 1881. The family home in Michigan was in Montcalm county. Their five children were: Zacariah T., who lives retired in Ann Arbor; Judge Matthew; Elizabeth, wife of William Palen, of the state of Louisiana; Jennie, wife of Frank Smart, living in Iowa; Rowena, wife of Frank Boardsley, a farm in Montcalm county.\n\nMatthew Bush, after getting his early education in the public schools of Ulster county, studied law, and was admitted to practice by the New York Supreme Court at the general term of 1876. His first experience as a lawyer was in his native state, and in 1879 he established his home and began his professional career in Shiawassee county, Michigan. The first ten years of his residence was in Vernon, and during that time he served as president of the village board. In 1889, Matthew Bush was elected for his first term as probate judge of Shiawassee county. Each succeeding election the people have set the seal of their approval upon their official conduct, and his service has now been continuous for a period of twenty-four years. He has also held a membership on the school board of the city of Corunna for eighteen years, and is now president of the board. Judge Bush was one of the organizers of the Probate Judges Association in Michigan, and was honored by election to the office of president, being the second to hold that honor in the association. Judge Bush was a director in the First National Bank of Corunna, during the existence of that bank.\n\nHis fraternal affiliations are with the Masonic Order, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks. He is past commander of Commandery No. 21, K.T., and is a member of the Mystic Shrine, having also taken all the official chairs in the Odd Fellows Lodge. His church is the Presbyterian. Judge Bush has been twice married.\n\nIn 1882 at Vernon, he and Miss Flora McKercher were married. Mrs. Bush was born at Vernon, a daughter of Alexander McKercher. By this marriage was one son, Walter M. Bush, now associated with his father in practice the firm of Bush & Bush. He is a graduate of the Detroit College of Law. Judge Bush, after the death of his first wife, married Annie E. Verney, of Battle Creek, Michigan, daughter of Rev. James Verney. To the second union have been born eight children, namely: James Verney Bush, of Corunna; Russell Alger, of Detroit; Lowell M., a student in the Detroit College of Medicine; Wendell Holmes; Homer N.; and Florence R. The children have all been given the best of educational advantages, and the family home in Corunna is a center of culture and refinement. Judge Bush is himself a scholar, possesses a fine library, both in the law and general literature, and it is said that no citizen of Shiawassee county can claim more friends in this locality than Judge Bush, whose official record and private character entitle him to the esteem and respect of all people. In politics, he has for years been a staunch support of the Republican interests.\n\nJudge Matthew Bush died on 7 Mar 1932 and is buried in PINE TREE CEMETERY in Corunna.\n\nHistory of Michigan by Charles Moore, Volume 2, 1915"
