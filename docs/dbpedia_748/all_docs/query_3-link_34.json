He is supposed to be almost as old as his brother Charles.He is the only Joel Barker I've found that could be old enough to be one of the Overmountain Men from Washington County who fought at King's Mountain during the Revolutionary War on October 7, 1780.\n\n*\n\nFought at King's Mountain: Name/County\n\nBARKER, Charles Washington\n\nBARKER, EdmundWashington\n\nBARKER, EdwardWashington\n\nBARKER, EnochWashington\n\nBARKER, HenryWashington\n\nBARKER, JoelWashington\n\n*\n\nJoel seems to be the same Joel mentioned in in these early Washington County Treasury Warrants.
