        "text": "The Mayflower is the name of the cargo ship that brought the Puritan separatists (known as pilgrims) to North America in 1620 CE. It was a type of sailing ship known as a carrack with three masts, three decks (upper, gun, and cargo), and measured roughly 100 feet long and 25 feet wide. The pilgrim passengers were quartered on the gun deck (also known as the Tween Deck as it was in-between the other two) which, with the 8 small cannons, 4 medium cannons, and other considerations, was reduced to a living space of roughly 70 feet overall. The 30 or so crew members and captain quartered on the upper deck in the forecastle and aft castle, which also held pens for animals. Goods for the voyage were stored in the cargo hold, and passengers traveled in the tween. There were no windows on the tween deck and the ceiling was only 5 feet high, with no latrines and no private rooms; these were the living conditions for the 102 passengers on their journey from September 6 to November 11 1620 CE.The Mayflower II\n\nA replica of the original 17th century ship,\n\nbuilt during 1955-1956.The captain and quarter-owner of the Mayflower was Christopher Jones (1570-1622 CE) who commanded a crew of 30 men and was contracted by Thomas Weston (1584-1647 CD) in the interests of the Puritan separatists living in Leiden, the Netherlands, to transport them to the New World to found their own settlement. The English colony of Jamestown, Virginia was thriving and their original destination was north of Jamestown, just below the Hudson River Valley in the region of present-day New York State, which was then part of the English Virginia Patent, but weather and lack of supplies forced their landing in present-day Massachusetts at Plymouth.\n\nThe pilgrims under John Carver (1584-1621 CE), Edward Winslow (1595-1655 CE), and William Bradford (1590-1657 CE), and the others not of their group, signed the Mayflower Compact upon their arrival at Plymouth, a set of laws all agreed to live by which would inform those that came later and established the Plymouth Colony (1620-1691 CE), which would eventually become absorbed by the Massachusetts Bay Colony, forming the basis of present-day New England in the United States. The Mayflower II\n\nAnother view of the replica ship at sea.The Mayflower II is a replica of the 17th-century ship, celebrated for transporting the Pilgrims to the New World in 1620. The replica was built in Devon, England during 1955-1956, in a collaboration between Englishman Warwick Charlton and Plimoth Plantation, an American museum. The work drew upon reconstructed ship blueprints held by the museum, along with hand construction by English shipbuilders using traditional methods.\n\nThe ship is considered a faithful generic replica within a few details (electric lights added and ladder replaced with a lower-deck staircase), with solid oak timbers, tarred hemp rigging, and hand-coloured maps, It is 106 feet long by 25 feet wide, 236 tons displacement, three masts (mainmast, foremast, mizzen), a bowsprit, and six sails.\n\n2011 Tour of the Mayflower II by the City of New Bedford while undergoing maintenance.\n\nJohn Alden\n\nIsaac and Mary (Norris) Allerton, and children Bartholomew, Remember, and Mary\n\nJohn Allerton\n\nJohn and Eleanor Billington, and sons John and Francis\n\nWilliam and Dorothy (May) Bradford\n\nWilliam and Mary Brewster, and children Love and Wrestling\n\nRichard Britteridge\n\nPeter Browne\n\nWilliam Butten\n\nRobert Carter\n\nJohn and Katherine (White) Carver\n\nJames and Mrs. Chilton, and daughter Mary\n\nRichard Clarke\n\nFrancis Cooke and son John\n\nHumility Cooper\n\nJohn Crackstone and son John\n\nEdward Doty\n\nFrancis and Sarah Eaton, and son Samuel\n\nThomas English\n\nMoses Fletcher\n\nEdward and Mrs. Fuller, and son Samuel\n\nSamuel Fuller\n\nRichard Gardiner\n\nJohn Goodman\n\nWilliam Holbeck\n\nJohn Hooke\n\nStephen and Elizabeth (Fisher) Hopkins and children Constance, Giles and Damaris; son Oceanus was born during the voyage\n\nJohn Howland\n\nJohn Langmore\n\nWilliam Latham\n\nEdward Leister\n\nEdmund Margesson\n\nChristopher and Mary (Prower) Martin\n\nDesire Minter\n\nEllen, Jasper, Richard, and Mary More\n\nWilliam and Alice Mullins and children Priscilla and Joseph\n\nDregory Priest\n\nSolomon Prower\n\nJohn and Alice Rigsdale\n\nThomas Rogers and son Joseph\n\nHenry Samson\n\nGeorge Soule\n\nMyles and Rose Standish\n\nElias Story\n\nEdward Thompson\n\nEdward and Agnes (Cooper) Tilley\n\nJohn and Joan (Hurst) Tilley and daughter Elizabeth\n\nThomas and Mrs. Tinker, and a son\n\nWilliam Trevore\n\nJohn Turner, and two sons\n\nRichard Warrren\n\nWilliam and Susanna (Jackson) White, and son Resolved (son Peregrine was born shipboard in Provincetown Harbor after arrival).\n\nRoger Wilder\n\nThomas Williams\n\nEdward and Elizabeth (Barker) Winslow\n\nGilbert Winslow\n\n\"Mr. Ely\"\n\nDorothy (John Carver's maidservant)"
