        "text": "John Barker patented 600 acres on Chippokee Creek on 5 October 1657 [on the above map, Upper Chipokee Creek or Chippokee Creek is that 'creek' which enters the James River just above the name 'SURRY']. His wife's name was Grace Cotton, though some thought Grace to have been the daughter of Thomas Busby and granddaughter of Francis Grey and Grace Grey. This Thomas Busby was probably the Busby known as \"Bacon's Lieutenant\" with whom this John Barker and others in Bacon's Rebellion took over the home of Arthur Allen, later called \"Bacon's Castle\" and who on 15 November, 1677, agreed to pay Allen for damage done to his home. Thomas Cotton's will was found and shows Grace Barker to be the daughter of the said Thomas Cotton . John Barker's will was probated in Surry County on 19 May 1714. (Deeds-Wills 1709-1715, p. 191-2). John Barker's will names Elizabeth Andrews, daughter who married first to Christopher Foster and second to Thomas Andrews; Sarah Lanier, daughter, wife of Robert Lanier; Hannah Lashley, daughter, wife of Walter Lashley; Robert Foster, grandson; John Barker, son - 400 acres; John Barker, grandson; Josiah Barker, son - 400 acres; Grace Barker, wife - 300 acres for her lifetime and then to daughter Grace Barker; Grace Barker, daughter.
