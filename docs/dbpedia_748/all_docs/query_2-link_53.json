        "text": "Pastor Emeritus John (Johnny) Alan Barker, age 80 of Danville, WV, went home to be with the Lord on Wednesday, May 22, 2024. He was born in Charleston, WV, on January 24, 1944, and grew up in Huntington, West Madison and Danville and was a graduate of Scott High School.\n\nJohnny is survived by his sons Jody (Laura), of Colorado Springs, CO, Shane (Catherine) of Granby, CO and daughter Traci (Steve) of Youngsville, NC. He was so proud of his grandchildren Noah (Karen), Samantha (Darian), Nathan, Elizabeth (Logan), Katy, Maggie, Elijah, Grayson and Lincoln. He is also survived by his brother T.R. (Jackie) as well as various cousins. He was preceded in death by Gena, his beloved wife of more than 55 years, and his parents Thomas R. Barker, Sr. and Hettie Pearl Workman Barker.\n\nJohnny and Gena married in June 1967 and attended Tennessee Temple University in Chattanooga, TN. After seminary, they moved to Bolivia to begin their missionary work. Johnny’s primary work was in church-planting and training up national pastors to continue ministry in their communities. Subsequently they moved to Peru and then Chile to continue their work in church planting and bringing souls to Christ.\n\nAfter their return to WV in the early 1980s, Johnny was called to be the pastor of Bible Baptist Church, Danville, where he and Gena served together for 32 years. Johnny’s passion for missions never subsided and the list of missionaries and overseas projects grew under his leadership. Over the years, Johnny, and others of all ages from Bible Baptist Church traveled across North America and overseas to put their focus on missions in action and to assist missionaries and nationals to grow the work of outreach to save lost souls for Christ.\n\nJohnny believed in relationships, whether it was getting to know someone in the community, members of the congregation, or working with members of local and state-side ministries. He was always looking for a way to share the gospel of his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. His life’s work was to be sure those he met heard the gospel. He often preached from Luke 10:2, “The harvest is truly great, but the laborers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest will send forth laborers into his harvest.”\n\nOver the years, Johnny found creative ways to support the work of the church and of missions, including supporting Appalachian Bible College, Bible Baptist Church youth who became missionaries themselves, and others who became pastors. Even one of his national pastors in Chile became a missionary to Mexico. His love of music extended to sending musical instruments overseas for missionaries to use in their outreach, playing music for the prison ministry he was engaged in and filling in at church services across the region.\n\nPastor Johnny will be remembered at a Celebration of Life at Bible Baptist Church, Danville, WV on Tuesday, June 4. Visitation will begin at 9:30am with the service at 11am. Officiating Pastors will be Dwight Coffman, Mike Clark, Greg Smith, Kenny Williamson, Kevan Bartlett and David King. Graveside service will follow at Boone Memorial Park, then a family reception at the Bible Baptist Church gym.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please consider a gift to the Bible Baptist Church Faith Promise Missions Fund, in honor of Pastor Johnny. Those can be sent to Bible Baptist Church, PO Box 261, Danville, WV, 25053.\n\nHandley Funeral Home is assisting the family."
