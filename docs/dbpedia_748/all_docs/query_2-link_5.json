See the text for details.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n\n1.1 DNA Evidence\n\n2 Research Notes\n\n3 Sources\n\nBiography\n\nAccording to The Great Migration Directory: Immigrants to New England, 1620–1640 (2015) the parents and origins of John Barker are not known.[1] See Research Notes\n\nHe married Anne Williams between 1632 & 1638 in Scituate, Massachusetts.\n\nHe died in the town of Jones in Plymouth Colony.\n\nHe was memorialized on a ceneotaph of First Settlers of Marshfield at Old Winslow Cemetery.\n\nSpouse:\n\nAnna Williams Barker (____ - 1657)\n\nChildren:\n\nDeborah Barker Barden (1639 - 1721)\n\nHe drowned at his ferry over the Jones River.\n\nHe arrived with his brother Robert to the Plymouth colony in about 1628-30. According to Barker, he and his brother \"set out from Plymouth colony to make homes for themselves, going by boat along the coast until they came to the North River (near Cape Cod) sailing down this, they reached what is now part of Pembroke, Mass. known as Herringbrook.\n\nHere they camped for the winter and the following spring ground was broken and the house built.\n\nJohn lived in that part of Plymouth which was set off in 1637 as Duxbury. He was a brickmason and agreed to teach Wm. Barden the trade of a bricklayer, as the end of his time giving him (Wm) â€˜20 bushels of corn, 2 suits of apparel and an ewe goat's lamb.'\n\nIn 1628 he moved to Marshfield, Mass. and bought a ferry at the Jones River, where he covenanted to keep it â€˜at two pence a person until a bridge is built.' In 1643 he was a member of the Marshfield Military Co. under Lt. Nathaniel Thomas; in 1648, he had some disagreement with a neighbor about a buildary line. The court requested John Alden and Miles Standish to â€˜set at rights such differences as are betwixt them'\" (231).\n\nAccording to Deane, \"He was drowned, 1652. [He had purchased the ferry (now [1850] Little's Bridge] of John Brewster, son of Elder Brewster, 1641, and was there drowned].\" [1, 3]\n\nHis inventory was taken on 17 December 1652 and exhibited at the court in Plymouth on 1 June 1653 on the oath of Anna Barker, Widow.[2]\n\nDNA Evidence\n\nMale paternal-line descendants of John Barker and his alleged father, Sir Robert Barker, are reported to share the same Y-DNA haplogroup.[3]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nDisputed Parents/Origins\n\nEarlier treatments of John Barker stated his was son of Sir Robert Baker and Catherine Ackworth, giving him descendency from Magna Carta Surety barons Saher de Quincy and Richard de Clare..[4] However, no evidence has been found to support this and th Sir Robert Baker/Barker referred to lived in Suffolk and not Shropshire.\n\nApparently, though, there is DNA evidence to suggest some sort of relationship. See DNA Evidence\n\nWe do know he was brother of Robert Barker who came to Plymouth in 1632.[5]\n\nThere is a John Barker (UK) created that shows his parents as Catherine (Acworth) Barker and Robert Barker. It is possible that John Barker (US) and John Barker (UK) are the same person but the relationship is not proven. John Barker (UK) was the brother-in-law of Narias Hawkins who sailed the Speedwell to Richmond's Island in 1635. This note has been added to acknowledge the uncertainty and to prevent further confusion. If it turns out in the future that these two can be merged, so be it!\n\nGreat Migration Directory sources: (for further development of this profile) See Records of the colony of New Plymouth, in New England', Nathaniel B.
