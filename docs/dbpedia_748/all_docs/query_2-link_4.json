        "text": "LIVE STOCK JOURNAL\n\n18th DECEMBER 1914\n\n-----------\n\nDeath of Sir JOHN BARKER, Bart.\n\nThe greatest figure in the world of Polo pony breeders passed peacefully away at his residence, The Grange, Bishop's Stortford, on Wednesday at 10.45 am - we refer to Sir John Barker, Baronet, the man who set out with a fixed aim, to evolve a playing pony that should be bloodlike, be full of quality, be gifted with speed, stamina, and over and above all that, able to carry a rider weight playing so strenuous a game, that only a pony with matchless and stupendous strength in its compact form could attempt to essay it.\n\nThe good work that Sir John Barker accomplished in this aim - for he succeeded beyond the measure of even his greatest dreams - will live long after him. His large-heartedness did not deter him from imparting to all and sundry that wealth of knowledge and of wisdom he had learned in the greatest school of all, the school of experience, acquired from years of experimenting in the fashioning of the future breed, the Polo-bred pony, of whom it might be said at this moment is the aristocrat of all our national pony types.\n\nSir John invited competition and asked for others to come into the ring to secure a fall, perchance a victory, from him. His periodical sales of young stock and made ponies gave to others the opportunities of ranging future generations of stock against his in the ring, and these two last seasons the awards, not only at the Royal Agricultural Hall, but at the Royal Show and in the country, have gone to many different owners. At one time it was truly a case of \"Eclipse first and the rest nowhere.\" Although his son-in-law, Mr Tresham Gilbey, frequently ranged his own-bred stock alongside that of Sir John's, and often beat the exhibits from The Grange, with those from Whitehall, the two studs, laid fundamentally upon much the same lines, held pride of place so long that their filling up of all the prize list with their stock became something like a joke that reached its merriest mood at the annual diner of the Polo and Riding Society. It was at this yearly function that the late Sir John Barker was always so prominent a figure in the rare banter that took place between a coterie of pony breeders, and particularly between Sir John and Mr George Norris Midwood, who at the last show reaped a full measure of reward and, for once, could claim that the Stortford pre-eminence had at last been broken. That Sir John's cheery presence will be missed from the shows and councils of the National Pony Society is but to state an empty fact.\n\nWe reiterate that no one will ever be able to gauge the good that Sir John did the cause of Polo pony breeding. Formerly the Polo pony was bred anyhow and picked up anywhere - in fact, it was a misfit, As the fame increased in popularity there followed great scarcity of ponies, and players found that types suitable for their requirements were difficult to secure.\n\nESTABLISHING THE BREED\n\nIt was during this condition of things that Sir John decided to tackle the problem of trying to breed the Polo pony to type, and, if possible, to establish a breed of high-class riding ponies. The experiment was fully recognised as likely to prove a costly one, and, further, most experts looked askance at a venture which, in their opinion, was foredoomed to failure. The founding of The Grange Stud in 1898 was therefore chiefly experimental, but no trouble or expense was spared to carry out the work to a successful issue. He started with an open mind and sought to solve the problem on what might be called common-sense lines. Realising that to meet the position a pony of a certain height and type was required, possessing intelligence, handiness, stamina and speed, he formed the opinion that pony blood should be chosen as the foundation stock, and in selecting suitable mares decided to use only those that had proved their worth and value in playing the game - in other words, to breed only from known quantities - the idea being that not only would \"like beget like\" in type, likely to take readily to the game.\n\nThen came the question of the sires, and here, in looking carefully over what had already been attempted in the way of breeding Polo ponies, he decided to purchase the half-bred pony sire Sandiway, bred by Sir Humphrey de Trafford. He was by Sir Walter Gilbey's celebrated thoroughbred stallion Rosewater, out of Cuddington, a well-known playing and prize-winning mare belonging to Sir Humphrey de Trafford, who was one of the pioneers in the endeavour to breed Polo ponies.\n\nA REMARKABLE SIRE\n\nSandiway proved to be a remarkable sire, mating perfectly with the blood-like mares selected for the foundation stock, and much of the success of The Grange Stud in its earlier years was due to the influence of this impressive stallion. He sired more prize-winning Polo ponies at London and other leading shows throughout the country than any sire of his day, and in 1910, through the stud being so full of his blood, Sir John sold him to the Crown Agents for the Colonies to go to Gambia, West Africa.\n\nWhen the stud was established it was thought that one of the chief difficulties would be that the ponies would be bred too big, and so not be able to conform to the 14h 2in Hurlingham standard, but it was soon discovered that the produce were a little on the small side. This was adjusted by introducing heavyweight ponies while still retaining plenty of quality. The success of the experiment to establish a breed of Polo ponies is now a matter of history, for the Polo-bred pony is in evidence everywhere, not only in the show ring, on the Polo grounds, and in the leading Polo tournaments, but is also a favourite with those seeking an ideal riding pony. Some of the ponies bred at The Grange Stud has been selected for the International matches against America, and many have gone to all parts of the world. With certain changes in the rules of Polo the game in England has become much faster, and so in recent years thoroughbred stallions have been more largely used at the Grange on the pony mares. The regulation height of the Polo pony has also been raised by half an inch, which allows an animal with shoes on to be registered as 14h 21in, or without shoes 14h 2in. Further, owing to the difficulty of getting thoroughbred stallions under 14h 21in. for breeding purposes, the National Pony Society passed a resolution that stallions should be registered up to 15 hands, and so sires of this height have of late years been used. Following Rosewater such stallions as Bold Marco, Antre, Mark For'ard, Right For'ard, Kennington, Royston Cave, Primrose Lad, Othrae, Othery and Arthur D have been used at The Grange Stud.\n\nTo all parts of the world stock have been sent, and it was recalled only on the occasion of the recent visit of the South African farmers to Bishop's Stortford and to Sir John's stud, that a rather notable farmer in South Africa bought the well-bred Persism, who was by Persimmon, out of Miss Primrose, a Galopin mare.\n\nIn looking over The Grange Stud at any time the visitor would be impressed with the remarkable uniformity of type throughout, and also by the quality and blood-like appearance of the ponies. Sir John strove for and got on his stock the correct riding shoulders, lengthy quarters, good middles, feet and limbs. Perhaps the best description of the stud would be that it is one of miniature thoroughbred hunters.\n\nThis home of the Polo pony was designed especially for its purpose; the buildings are commodious and conveniently arranged, with spacious loose-boxes and a riding school; indeed, the idea throughout has been to lay down a utilitarian model stud farm for the housing of what can faithfully be described as the largest and finest breeding stud of Polo ponies in England. The influence of Sir John's experiment will extend to every part of the world where lovers of the pony are found. There is no doubt that in the modern Polo pony we have the highest type of pony yet produced. The good work done at The Grange will have a far-reaching influence on the future of pony breeding, not only at home but abroad, and it should go far to influence the development of the riding pony for use in peace as well as in times of war.\n\nSir John had many interests and many pursuits. He contested his native town of Maidstone in the Liberal interest so long ago as 1888, and again in 1898, but was unsuccessful on both occasions. On his third fight, in 1900, however, he was elected, but subsequently lost his seat. In 1906 he was returned for Penrhyn and Falmouth, which he represented until 1910. He was one of the Aldermen elected to serve on the first London County Council. The dignity of a Baronetcy was conferred upon him in 1898. Among the other offices he has filled from time to time were those of President and member of the Council of the National Pony Society, president of the Essex Agricultural Society, President of the Newspaper Press Fund, President of the Early Closing Association, and a member of the royal Agricultural Society, the Hackney Horse Society, and the Hunters' Improvement Society. Like his life-long friend, the late Sir Walter Gilbey, he was a keen sportsman and lover of the open-air life, Agricultural pursuits, including fruit growing and horse-breeding claimed a large share of his interest, and shooting was an especially favourite form of sport with him. He was a member of the Reform, national Liberal, and Automobile Clubs. He was founder and chairman of John Barker and Co Ltd, Kensington. Sir John was born in 1840, in Kent his father been a prosperous brewer at Loose, Maidstone. At the age of thirty he had laid the foundations of the famous Kensington establishment, which was started with two houses then confined to the drapery trade. At the present time upwards of sixty houses are incorporated in the premises, while the company's staff numbers nearly 2,000 persons. The departments total sixty-five, and the business as it stands to-day is a striking testimony to the energy and initiative bestowed upon it by its founder in all the stages of its development.\n\nThe late Sir John farmed about 300 acres of land at the Grange, Bishop's Stortford, primarily for pleasure. From the first horse breeding was the principal feature in his farming enterprise, as perhaps was to be expected from his proximity to and friendship with Sir Walter Gilbey. Sir John at one time bred both Shires and Hackneys, but the Hackney stud was dispersed in the closing years of the last century to make room for the Polo and other ponies with which unprecedented success has been achieved. He also owned one of the largest and best of the few flocks of Syrian sheep in this country. He took a keen interest in local and county agricultural affairs, and was President of the Essex Agricultural Society when the show was held at Bishop's Stortford a few years ago.\n\nSir John leaves an only daughter, who married Mr Tresham Gilbey, third son of the late Sir Walter Gilbey, Bart, and upon whom a heavy dual blow has fallen within the space of a few weeks.\n\nThe funeral will take place at St Michael's Church, Bishop's Stortford, at 2 o'clock to morrow (Saturday). A special restaurant car train will leave Liverpool Street Station at 12.40 returning 3.30. Conveyances will meet the train.\n\nTHE TIMES, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1914 DEATH OF SIR JOHN BARKER FOUNDER OF THE KENSINGTON STORES\n\nWe regret to record that Sir John Barker, Bt., founder of the great stores in Kensington which bear his name, died at The Grange, Bishop's Stortford, yesterday. He had a severe illness last June, from which he never really recovered.\n\nSir John Barker, who was born at Loose, a village near Maidstone, on April 5, 1840, was the eldest son of Mr. Joseph Barker, who was first part proprietor and afterwards sole owner of a small brewery. He was apprenticed at the age of 13 to a draper in Maidstone, and subsequently worked as a junior assistant at Folkestone and Dover. Having completed his apprenticeship he went to London, and after brief periods of service with two other employers in Westbourne Grove, engaged himself to the late Mr. Whiteley, who was then carrying on business in a small way. From this time Mr. Whiteley's business made rapid headway, Mr. Barker being the owner's right-hand man. In a few years the assistant was made manager at a salary of £300 a year. He soon wanted a further increase, and Mr Whiteley agreed to double his salary if he doubled the business in the next year. The business was doubled and so was the manager's salary. Mr. Whiteley's business continued to expand, and Mr. Barker asked to be taken into partnership. Mr. Whiteley offered to increase his salary to £1,000 a year, but could not see his way to making him a partner, whereupon Mr. Barker left him and entered into partnership with Mr. (afterwards Sir James) Whitehead. A business was opened in a couple of shops in High Street, Kensington, and Mr. Whitehead found the necessary capital.\n\nThe business of John Barker and Co. developed even more rapidly than Mr. Whiteley's had done, and shop after shop was taken in. Mr. Barker bought out his partner, and not long after decided to transfer his business to a limited liability company, of which he was to be chairman, the capital being fixed at £250,000. There have since been various extensions of the business of John Barker and Co. (Limited), the most notable being the incorporation with it of the firm of Messrs. Pontings.\n\nIn 1888 Mr. Barker stood as a candidate for Parliament in the Liberal interest at a by-election at Maidstone, but was unsuccessful. He was again defeated at a by-election in 1898, and although he was returned at the General Election of 1900 he was unseated on petition. In 1906 he was elected for Penryn and Falmouth, but lost his seat at the January election in 1910. He was made a baronet in 1908.\n\nSir John farmed about 300 acres of land at The Grange, Bishop's Stortford, primarily for pleasure. From the first, horse-breed was the principal feature in his farming enterprise, as perhaps was to be expected from his proximity to, and friendship with, Sir Walter Gilbey, who died last month. Sir John at one time bred both Shires and Hackneys, but the Hackney stud was dispersed in the closing years of last century to make room for the polo and other ponies with which unprecedented success has been achieved. For many years The Grange stud has occupied the leading position, winning innumerable prizes at Islington and other shows and fulfilling a prominent part in evolving and fixing the type and breed of polo pony. Sir John was an active member of the Polo Pony Society and was a past president. He also owned one of the largest and best of the few flocks of Syrian sheep in this country. He took a keen interest in local and county agricultural affairs and was president of the Essex Agricultural Society when the show was held at Bishop's Stortford a few years ago.\n\nSir John Barker was also chairman of Paquin (Limited). He was financially interested in the Echo evening newspaper during the later stages of its existence and had also an interest in the short-lived Morning Herald.\n\nHis only son lost his life at an early age as a result of an accident while riding in Kensington. His only daughter is married to Mr. Tresham Gilbey, third son of Sir Walter Gilbey.\n\nThe funeral will be at Bishop's Stortford on Saturday.\n\nTHE TIMES, MONDAY, DECEMBER 21, 1914 FUNERAL SIR JOHN BARKER\n\nThe funeral of Sir John Barker, Bt., took place at Bishop's Stortford on Saturday. The chief mourners were Mrs. Tresham Gilbey (daughter) and Mr. Tresham Gilbey.
