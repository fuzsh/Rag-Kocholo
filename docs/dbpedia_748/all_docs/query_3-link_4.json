In the New Year's Honours List for 1913, it was announced that a baronetcy had been conferred upon Josceline Bagot, but he died on 1 March 1913, before the patent creating the baronetcy had passed the Great Seal. As a result, his 17-year-old son was created a baronet shortly after the death of his father. The 'Court Circular' section of 'The Times' of 5 July 1913 stated that \"The King has been pleased, by Letters Patent under the Great Seal, bearing date April 19, 1913, to confer the dignity of a baronet of the United Kingdom upon Alan Desmond Bagot, of Levens, in the County of Westmorland, Esquire, the heirs male of his body lawfully begotten, his father, Lieutenant-Colonel Josceline FitzRoy Bagot, having died before the passing under the Great Seal of the Patent of Baronetage which would have been issued in his favour.\" For similar instances of a son being created a baronet in honour of his father who had died before his baronetcy could be created, see the baronetcies of Hills and Kennard. The home of the Bagot family is Levens Hall in Westmorland, parts of which date from the 13th century. According to an article in the April 1998 issue of \"History Today\" a number of points of interest are associated with this house. * According to family tradition, in the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century, a gypsy woman appeared at the front door of the house in a starving condition and begging for food. She was told to go to the house's back door, but she collapsed and died on the way, but not before she uttered the prediction that Levens House would never pass from father to son until such time as the River Kent, which runs through the grounds of the estate, ceased to flow, and a white fawn was born in the park surrounding the house. Coincidence or not, it is said that after making this prediction, no male heir was born for the next 200 years, until Alan Desmond Bagot was born in 1896, and that he was born at a time when the River Kent had frozen over, and a white deer had been born to one of the black Norwegian fallow deer in the park. The ghost of the gypsy, known as the Grey Lady, is seen now and again in the grounds. * Again in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the house belonged to James Grahme (1650-1730), MP for Carlisle 1685-1687, Appleby 1702-1708 and Westmorland 1708- 1727 and younger brother of the 1st Viscount Preston. During his ownership, each year on 12 May a \"Radish Festival\" was held on the estate. At such festivals vast amounts of radishes were consumed, after which participants were required to drink a massive glass of the estate's home brew, and then walk a straight line across the bowling green. If participants managed to do this, they received another massive glass and were then asked to walk back again, once more in a straight line. It is said that no-one was ever able to complete the second walk. * A flock of semi-feral goats lives in the park at Levens Hall. They are said to be descended from Swiss goats which were brought back to England by returning Crusaders. Sir Abe Bailey, 1st baronet Sir Abe was a larger than life figure, who, during his lifetime won and lost a number of vast fortunes on the South African gold and diamond fields, was sentenced to death by the Boers for high treason, and who died one of the world's wealthiest men. The following obituary appeared in 'The New York Times' on 11 August 1940:- 'Sir Abe Bailey, mining magnate and race horse owner, whose name since early Gold Rush days has been synonymous with South Africa, died here [Cape Town] today at the age of 75. He was a man of astonishing energy and strong constitution, who regained robust health after the loss of both legs as a result of phlebitis when over 70. 'It was in 1887, in the rush to the Johannesburg fields, that he first met Cecil Rhodes and formed a lifelong friendship that laid the foundation for his enormous wealth, estimated in recent years at ten million pounds. 'When gold was discovered in the Transvaal, in the 1880s, Abe Bailey hurried there from the counting room of his Scotch father's general store in a South African veldt town. Before he was 23 years old he had become a millionaire by trading in gold shares. Thereafter for nearly fifty years he figured in the affairs of South Africa and the British Empire as financier, politician, soldier and sportsman. 'The love of sport which made him a hero of the ring and cricket field in his youth, when he held the middle and heavyweight boxing titles of South Africa, turned him in maturity to the turf. He became one of the best-known figures on English race courses and his stables were among the finest in the world. Ill luck dogged his racers and he seldom won a major event. An outstanding exception to this rule occurred in 1927 when his Foxlaw won the Ascot Gold Cup. 'A contemporary of Cecil Rhodes, Bailey was active in the political struggle between Dutch settlers and English gold seekers in the Transvaal. This culminated in the [Second] Boer War at the turn of the century and brought all of South Africa under British control. In the war itself Bailey served with conspicuous bravery and was decorated with the King's and Queen's medals with six clasps. 'In 1907 he succeeded to Rhodes's seat in the Cape Colony Parliament and when the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910 he became member for Krugersdorp in the Transvaal Legislative Assembly, holding that seat until 1924. 'He was knighted in 1911 and made a baronet in 1919. This latter distinction was conferred after he had served as a major in the World War with the South Africans under General Jan C. Smuts, who wrested Southwest Africa [i.e. Namibia] from the Germans. 'He was born in Cradock, Cape Colony, on Nov. 6, 1864, the son of Thomas Bailey, merchant and politician. In 1894 he married Caroline Paddon of England. She died in 1902, and he married Mary Westenra, daughter of Lord Rossmore, in 1911. His second wife became a noted flier. She was the first of her sex to fly the Irish Sea and in 1928-29 she made a solo flight from London to Cape Town and back. 'Three sons and four daughters were born of the two marriages. The eldest [son], and heir to the baronetcy, John Milner Bailey, became a London broker and married Diana, daughter of Winston Churchill, in 1932. This marriage was terminated by divorce. [She subsequently married Duncan Sandys, later Baron Duncan-Sandys]. 'It is related that Abe Bailey had made and lost two fortunes as a stockbroker and speculator in the gold fields before he was 24, and that he was on his way to Australia to start anew when he stopped at Durban to play for Cape Colony in a cricket match against Natal. He won for the Cape, the story runs, and was induced to remain in Africa when his admirers raised for him a purse of $1,000, with which he founded his third and greatest fortune. 'The tale is perhaps apocryphal [and is certainly not borne out by Bailey's statistics included on the Cricinfo web-page], but his early years were full of sudden rises and reverses and of prodigious feats in sport. By 1890 the Rand gold fields had shown their permanence, and the Bailey fortune was established. As a mine owner he supported the \"outlanders\" in their controversy with the Boers of the Transvaal republic over the rights of inrushing gold seekers. 'When Dr. [Leander] Starr Jameson made in 1895 the raid on the Transvaal which was to have coincided with an English rebellion there against Boer rule, Bailey was arrested as a plotter and sentenced to death, along with Rhodes's American engineer, John Hays Hammond, and others. The sentences were commuted but Bailey spent thirteen months in jail. 'Sir Abe lived in London after middle age, but continued to regard Muizenberg, a Cape Town suburb on the Indian Ocean [sic], as his home. 'On his estate at Colesberg was bred the finest stock in South Africa. He introduced Tasmanian sheep and saw them become important in the South African wool industry. He sold the Colesberg property in 1928 for $1,280,000. 'He made a grant of $25,000 a year to the Royal Institute of International Affairs in 1928 to promote world peace. 'His income as reported for British income tax purposes was said to have been more than $900,000 in 1929 and more than $1,600,000 in 1930.' The special remainder to the baronetcy of Baird created in 1809 From the \"London Gazette\" of 25 March 1809 (issue 16240, page 404):- 'The King has been pleased to grant the Dignity of a Baronet of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland unto Sir David Baird, Knight, Lieutenant-General of His Majesty's Forces, Heirs Male of his Body lawfully begotten.' Sir Charles Warwick Bampfylde, 5th baronet conspired to have him imprisoned for an alleged assault. The housekeeper's husband, Joseph Morland, committed suicide after shooting Sir Charles. The following report appeared in \"The York Herald and General Advertiser\" on 12 April 1823:- 'On Tuesday evening, an inquisition was taken at the Worcester Arms public-house, George- street, Manchester-square, before Thomas Stirling, Esq., coroner, on the body of Joshua Morland, the individual who attempted the assassination of Sir Charles Bampfylde, and who was the instrument of his own death under the following circumstances. 'Lucy Stockes deposed, that her husband had been servant to Sir Charles Bampfylde, and she had been in the habit of working as charwoman in Sir Charles's house; she was in the habit of selling apples, etc., at the corner of the square; about half past four on Monday afternoon she heard the report of a pistol, and some person exclaimed, \"Oh;\" she almost immediately heard the report of a second pistol; saw Sir Charles moving quickly towards his own house; heard him exclaim, \"That d----d rascal has shot me. The wife of the deceased had been the house- keeper to Sir C. Bampfylde, who is 71 years of age. 'Wm. Bayles at half past four was passing down Montague-street, and Sir C. Bampfylde and another man with their backs towards him, walking on the other side of the way - there was a butter-man also walking in the same line, but behind them. Sir Charles was walking from deceased; heard the reports of two pistols; saw deceased fire the second pistol; his arm was lifted, and directed towards his face. 'By a Juryman - Did he run away after firing the first pistol? - No, he stood with his back to the coachway, and fell on the curb stone. 'After the examination of a number of witnesses, which continued to a late hour, the Jury returned a verdict of Felo de se. 'The following statement of the nature of the wound is certified by the signatures of the Medical gentlemen who are attending Sir Charles:- \"Sir Charles Bampfylde has been wounded by a pistol ball in the right side of the chest, which entered below the shoulder near the spine, and has lodged. The wound is not at present attended by any unfavourable symptoms, but it is still one of a very dangerous tendency.\" 'Jealousy is said to have been the cause of this outrage.' 'The Times' on 21 April 1823 reported that \"Sir Charles Bampfylde, who was shot about a fortnight since by Joseph Moreland, died on Saturday night at 20 minutes past eight. The surgeons having been unable to extract the ball, had, on consultation, pronounced his case hopeless. For some days he had been in a state of torpor, and expired in that melancholy situation.\" At the subsequent inquest held into the death of Charles, the jury found that \"Sir Charles had been wilfully murdered by Joseph Morland, deceased.\" Sir Richard Hugh Barlow, 6th baronet Sir Richard died when the plane in which he was travelling crashed in the Andes in Ecuador in 1946. 'The Guardian,' on 7 December 1946, reported that 'A British baronet, Sir Richard Hugh Barlow, and Captain O.E. Gates, chief pilot of the Shell Company in Ecuador, are missing somewhere among the canyons and volcanoes of the Andes, in Ecuador. Their 'plane left Shellmera for Quito, capital of Ecuador, on Tuesday morning [3 December]. The last radio contact was received four minutes after they had taken off. A search party left yesterday to cross the 25 miles of rugged country between Shellmera and the course of the Rio Blanco River, where the wreckage of a 'plane was sighted on Thursday. The 'plane had apparently crashed into a precipice 13,000 feet up and appeared to be burnt out.'"
