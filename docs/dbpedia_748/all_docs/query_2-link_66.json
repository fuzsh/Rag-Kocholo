        "text": "John Barker, age 84, passed away on March 31, 2018. John was born in Boston then raised and educated in Weymouth. He worked in the hospitality industry when he was younger before he started at Group Insurance Commission in Boston. He also worked for Quincy City Hospital, which he retired from in 1998. John was a man of many talents and always offered such wise advice. He enjoyed working on his yard and Bocce tournaments, but what John loved most of all was the time he spent with his family most especially his grandchildren.\n\nJohn is survived by his beloved wife Sally Barker (Watt) of S. Weymouth, his loving children Nathan Bates and his wife Kathleen of Whitman, Ronald Bates and his wife Christine of Whitman, Bonnie Paola and her husband Thomas of Whitman, Sally Dudley and her husband Alan of Carver, and the late John Barker Jr. John is also survived by 16 grandchildren, two great-grandchildren, and many loving nieces and nephews.\n\nRelatives and friends are respectfully invited to the visiting hours for John on Thursday, April 5, 2018 from 4-8pm in the C. C. Shepherd Funeral Home located at 134 Pleasant St. (Columbian Sq) Weymouth, MA 02190. Relatives and friends will gather in the funeral home on Friday at 9:30AM for a Funeral Service in honor of Johnâ€™s life which will begin promptly at 10am. Interment will immediately follow in Blue Hill Cemetery, Braintree."
