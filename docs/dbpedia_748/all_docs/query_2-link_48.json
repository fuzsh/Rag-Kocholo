They would be blessed with one son and one daughter. John cherished spending time with his children, whom he adored.\n\nJohn carefully studied the Bible and other Christian texts. He had done extensive research on the Beatitudes in the Gospel of Matthew, particularly the Sermon on the Mount. A member of Lifeline pro-life group, he was instrumental in organizing the National Day of Prayer in Monroe.\n\nJohn never missed an episode of “America’s Got Talent” and also enjoyed action movies, especially the Marvel and Star Wars series. He was excited and proud to have recently received his Ham Radio license. A quiet but friendly person, John, was very giving and never hesitated to lend a helping hand. His employment and activism led him to meet many people throughout the area and everyone loved him.\n\nJohn Hayden Barker II, age 53, of Monroe, Michigan passed away on Monday, August 23, 2021.
