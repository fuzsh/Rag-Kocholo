        "text": "Twenty-eight-year-old Norton W. Barker (1875–1954) of Michigan City, Indiana, was at the Iroquois Theater Mr. Bluebeard matinee with unknown others. He escaped from the auditorium with a young girl, an unnamed stranger, who sat next to him. With two fewer aisles than had been approved by the building department, one in front of each box, and the remaining east-west aisles jammed with people, they were fortunate to have the youth and strength to follow a somewhat arduous path to safety. They climbed into the box seating alcove on the north side of the first floor and from there fled to a fire escape exit into Couch Place alley.\n\nNorton was married to Marjory Clark Barker, and they had two toddlers, Wallace and Marjory. Norton worked for the Haskell & Barker Car Company in Michigan City, manufacturer of railway cars. Norton's uncle, the wealthy John H. Barker Jr., was company president and principal owner.† It employed over 3,000 workers. Michigan City, in 1903 a community of around 15,000 residents, was a three-hour train ride southwest of Chicago.\n\nIn 1878 when Norton was a three-year-old, his father, Wallace Barker, had drowned in a boating accident on Lake Michigan with a group of his fellow Hyde Park Qui Vive yacht club members. Wallace's hardware company, W. C. Barker, had failed two years earlier.\n\nNorton grew up in Chicago, where his mother, Jessie Norton Barker, chose to remain after her husband's death. He attended Phillips Andover Academy prep school near Boston. At her passing in 1899, Norton moved to Michigan City, where he met his wife.\n\nIn the years after the fire\n\nNorton and Marjory's marriage ended in divorce, and in 1925 he remarried to Florence E. Wilbur. By 1918, age forty, he described himself as retired. For twenty months 1921–1923, newspapers carried dozens of stories of his daughter's failed effort to force Bryn Mawr to reinstate her after expulsion."
