PREFACE SELECTIONS from this Diary were first pub- lished under the title of \"A British Officer in Boston in 1775/' m ^e Atlantic Monthly for April and May, 1877, with an Introduction by Richard H. Dana, Jr. and notes by his daughter, Elizabeth Ellery Dana. The identity of the writer was un- determined beyond the fact that he was a subaltern in the Light Infantry Company of the Fourth Regi- ment of Foot, better known as the King's Own, but Mr. Dana in his Introduction inclined to the belief that it was the work of either Lieutenant Hamilton or Lieutenant Thorne. The manuscript had been secured by Miss Dana and was subsequently purchased by her. She had immediately entered with enthusiasm upon the task of annotating it for publication and of identifying the author. The interesting story of her quest is narrated in a manuscript note which she sent to the Massachusetts Historical Society and which is now in their library, bound up with the Diary clippings from the Atlantic Monthly. The story of her search was also narrated to the Colonial Society by the late Reverend E. G. Porter, and is printed in Volume 5 of their Publications. . Miss Dana's task involved, among other correspondence, an interchange of com- munications with the British War Office and with the headquarters of the King's Own Regiment, then vi PREFACE stationed at Gibraltar. Hamilton and Thorne were promptly eliminated as possibilities, neither having served in the light infantry company in 1775. It was also proved beyond a doubt that the lieutenants of the company in that year were Edward Thoroton Gould and John Barker. As Gould was wounded at Concord Bridge and taken prisoner later in the day, Barker was left in possession of the field as the un- doubted author of the Diary. Certain other evi- dence of a minor character corroborated this con- clusion. An interesting and convincing theory which was suggested to Miss Dana, as to how the Diary came into American hands at the time of the British evacuation of Philadelphia, is set forth in Mr. Por- ter's communication to the Colonial Society. Lieutenant John Barker was the son of the i\\d- miral of that name w r ho died in 1775. The young man married Caroline, daughter of Lady Harriet Conyers, and granddaughter of the first Earl of Pomfret. He entered the army as an ensign and purchased his lieutenancy previous to the Revolu- tionary War. In the fall of 1775, ^ e purchased his captain's commission and was transferred to that grade in the Tenth Regiment of Foot, then on duty in Boston. Twelve years later, in 1787, he was still a captain in the same regiment, and his memorial filed in that year requesting a promotion is repro- duced in facsimile in this volume. This petition or memorial was accompanied by a personal letter from his Colonel, Sir Robert Murray Keith, who speaks of the applicant as one \"for whose distin- guished merit as an officer and a Gentleman I can fairly vouch.\" It is pleasant to note that Barker PREFACE achieved his Majority and that he finally retired as Lieutenant-Colonel of the 27th Regiment. His last years seem to have been spent at his seat of Clare Priory, near Clare Castle in Suffolk. Barker's narrative of the events of the 19th of April is perhaps the most valuable evidence we have from British sources. His account of Bunker Hill is brief and adds nothing to our knowledge. A gap in the Diary during the late fall months of 1775 prob- ably covers the period of his taking over new and more responsible duties in another regiment. He evidently had a keenly critical mind; and little as he admired the Bostonians, his criticism of his own service was quite as severe. The military regula- tions then in force, the inefficiency of the British staff, General Gage, Colonels Smith and Clark, all come in for caustic comment. His accounts of cer- tain clashes that occurred in Boston between the people and the troops are interesting reading if compared with American versions of the same epi- sodes. In September, 1897, there came to Boston Lieu- tenant-General George Digby Barker, C. B., Gov- ernor of Bermuda and grandson to the writer of this Diary. An account of his visit appears in Mr. Por- ter's article. General Barker visited Bunker Hill, Concord, and Lexington, scenes of the historical events in which Lieutenant Barker played his part in 1775, and when he left Boston he was contem- plating retirement to the same estate in Suffolk where his grandfather had ended his days one hun- dred years before. The Diary is now published in full for the first PREFACE time. The spelling of the original has been retained; but the ampersand and long s's have been replaced the forms in common use, and the rather erratic punctuation has been modernized. Most of the notes supplied by Miss Dana for the Atlantic Monthly are reproduced. H. M. ILLUSTRATIONS A British Officer Frontispi tece From an etching by Capt.

THE BRITISH IN BOSTON f/rtv of 'Boston fram the Harbor THE BRITISH IN BOSTON THE DIARY AT length is concluded the Glorious Campaign — - of Boston Common : 1 why cou'd I be so stupid as not to keep a Journal of those five months, which will in future fill so respectable a place in the Annals of Britain; and wou'd have furnish'd so noble a field for Satire. [1774], Tuesday 15th Novr. The four Battalions encamp'd on the Common, (and four Companies of Artillery) viz. King's Own, 5 th, 38 th, and 43d; the Royal W. Fusileers on Fort Hill; the 59th in the advanced Lines, all march'd into Winter Quarters, leaving the tents standing under the care of a small guard, that they might dry before they were pack'd up, as it had been wet weather for two days. The 10th, three Comps. of the 18th, the 47th and 52d Regts. landed from their Transports, and also went into winter Quarters. Yesterday in compliance with the request of the Select Men, Genl. Gage order'd that no Soldier in future shou'd appear in the Streets with his side Arms. Query, Is this not encouraging the Inhabi- tants in their licentious and riotous disposition? Also orders are issued for the Guards to seize all military Men found engaged in any disturbance, 1 The King's Own and other regiments, on their arrival in Boston, were encamped for some months on the Common, no barracks being in readiness for them, and a question having arisen whether the Gen- eral Court was obliged to provide barracks, or not. 4 THE BRITISH IN BOSTON [1774 whether Aggressors or not; and to secure them, 'till the matter is enquired into. By Whom? By Vil- lains that wou'd not censure one of their own Va- grants, even if He attempted the life of a Soldier; whereas if a Soldier errs in the least, who is more ready to accuse than Tommy ? 1 His negligence on the other hand has been too conspicuous in the affair of Cn.

Wednesday 16th. Very rainy, no Detachmt. sent to work at the Neck; what made it remarkable was that it was not the first or second time that the Work had been stop'd by the weather for upwards of two months. This day the Genl. was pleased to determine the Winter allowance of Money for Lodg- ings; and the several quantities of fuel and Candles; at same time informing the Army that those indul- gences are by no means to be consider'd as Prece- dents for the future.

Because Tommy feels no affection for his Army, and is more attach'd to a paltry Oecon- omy, both in Publick and Private. Thursday, 17th. All the Tents on the Common struck and deliver'd into the Qr. Mr. Genl.'s store to 6 THE BRITISH IN BOSTON [1774 preserve for a second (what in reality were not fit for a first) Campaign. How mistaken is that Oecon- omy, which to save a trifle, will hazard the lives of Thousands! All the Hutts in ye rear of the Camp, also destroyed to day. Friday 18th. Snow and hard frost last night and to day exceeding cold. Sunday, 20th. Hard frost continues. A day or two ago the Comr. in Chief applied to the Select Men for the use of Faneuil Hall as a place for the Troops to attend Divine Service. They most Gra- ciously refused to comply with his Request; as a grateful return for his singular compliance with all their desires. Was it for this he gave a protection of an Officer's Guard to their Brick-kilns, to secure them from the Labourers who had not been paid for their work? and after affording such Protection asking to become a Purchaser of the Bricks, and receiving for answer \"No they were to be appropriated to other purposes than accommodating the King's Troops.\" Was it because he disarmed the Troops to please them that the Select think it incumbent on them, to oppose him in every thing? But his . . . deserves it. Is it not astonishing that the daily instances of the opposition of the People shou'd tend to make him more earnestly attentive to them ? Not long since a Corporal of the King's Own Regt. was confined by the express Orders of the Genl. for having ill treated an Inhabitant. A Court of Enquiry was order'd, composed of Officers of the Regt., the Declaration of the Inhabitant was taken, and under a pretence that all his Witnesses were not in Town, the Corpl. was remanded back to his confinement; about ten days 1774] THE BRITISH IN BOSTON 7 afterwards a message came from Head Quarters to the Commandg. Officer of the Regt., to inform him if the Corpl. wou'd beg the Inhabitant's pardon he might be released; He refused unless the General positively order'd him, at same time declaring He wou'd rather stand a General Court Martial, than make a submission where he knew he was not in the wrong; in a few days an order came to release him without any condition; he immediately went to his Captain, and begged leave to resign his Knott, as in the character of a private Soldier he shou'd be less exposed to Complaints; observing that the whole foundation of the complaint against him was from his protecting a Sentry from the Insults of a Servt. of a Townsman, who wou'd had his complaint been well founded have had him more severely punished; his manner of being released is a sufficient proof not only of the disposition of the people, but of the readiness of Mr. T y to give up a Military, whether right or wrong. Monday, 21st. Frost not so severe as yesterday. Capn. Cain 1 of the 43d appointed Town Major. The Comr. in Chief issued Orders for the several Regts. to exercise every fine day, and to fire with Ball in all directions, &c, &c. It 's obvious to the most inattentive Observer that the American Win- ters must be particularly favorable to parade Duties. From Tuesday to Friday 25 th nothing worth re- marking, except the 24th order'd that in case of fire the Regts. to parade in their own Barracks, and 1 It was by his fatal letter to this Cane, or Kane, that Dr. Ben- jamin Church's treachery was discovered, and proof obtained of his being in the pay of the British government. 8 THE BRITISH IN BOSTON [1774 then wait for the Genls.

Saturday 26. The Detachmt. which was usually at the Works at the Neck discontinued, they being, at least the material part of them, finished. — Yesterday was given out an Order to the Corps in Garrison, that when they fire with Ball they are to use Cartridges 42 in the pound, as they are found to throw a Ball with more justness and to do equal execution with those of 32 to the pound. By whose experiment has this been proved? Sunday 27 th. Orders for all the Captains of Gren- adiers and light Infantry to send in the dates of their Commissions to the Adj. General. Conjectured that those Comps. are to be form'd into Battalions. Monday, 28th. Reported that Ld. Percy 1 is to take the command of the Grenadiers and light In- fantry, and make an excursion up the Country. Tuesday, 29th. This day heard by a Ship arrived at Salem from England, that she sailed two days after the Scarborough, who remained but 36 hours 1 Lord Percy (afterward Duke of Northumberland), was much esteemed by the Bostonians for his courtesy and j ustice and willing- ness to punish any misdemeanours among his soldiers brought to his notice.

John McDonald, Soldier the light Infantry of the King's Own, 2 was found dead this morning; he mounted Guard at the Lines yes- terday, and last night about 10 oclock was seen ex- ceedingly drunk, but not being confined wander'd into the rear of the Works, where he was found early this morning dead. He was some distance be- low High Water Mark, and the tide had washed over him; but as his forehead was much bruised, it is supposed that a fall among the stones on the Beach had seconded the Yanky rum in his death. Satur'y 3d. Remarkable fine weather some days past, some of the Regts. out firing at Targets &c. 1 The Royal American or 6oth Regiment. 2 The writer's regiment. io THE BRITISH IN BOSTON [1774 &c. This evening the Scarborough arrived from England with dispatches to the Govr. Nothing has yet transpired. Sunday 4th. The Assistant Engineers dismissed, most of 'em of no other use but just to keep the men at work, for which they get the name of Drivers. The Scarborough brought intelligence of the sailing of the Asia, Boyne, and Somerset, with a Detach- ment of Marines on board under the Command of Major Pitcairne. Monday, 5th. The Asia arrived this morning, with Major Pitcairne on board and part of a rein- forcement of 460 Marines, exclusive of the Comple- ment of the Ship. Wedy. 7th. A Field Day on the Common, the 4th, 5th, 23d, 38th, 47th, and 52d Regts. all out, but not at the same time.

Houses taken at North End for Bar- racks for the Marines when they land. Sat. 10th. We hear that the Glasgow Sloop of War from Halifax is in great danger within two or three leagues of the Light House. Sunday 1 1 th. Nothing certain yet heard of the Glasgow, a number of Vessels gone out to her. Mon. 1 2th. Had the pleasure of hearing the Glas- gow is out of danger: she had struck on some rocks, lost her Rudder, her false Keel, and 3 Hands. This day the Boyne arrived; she parted from the Somer- set off the Western Isles. Tues. 13th. The Glasgow towed into the Harbour. EARL PERCY, A D. 1775. 1774] THE BRITISH IN BOSTON u Wed. 14th. The Detachment of the Royal Irish embark'd on board their transports, a malignant spotted fever having broke out among them, which carried off several Men in a short time. The Sur- geons are of opinion the disorder was occasion'd by a quantity of stagnated Water in a reservoir under the . floor of their Barracks, which was a still House be- fore they got it for their Barracks. Thur. 15th. Two men of the 43d died of the dis- order above mention'd. This evening died Capn. Maturin 1 of the 31st Regt. He was Secretary to Genl. Gage; it 's reported Lt. Rook of the King's Own, who is one of the Aids de Camp is recom- mended for the Compy., but I don't think it prob- able that he will succeed, as Genl. Oughton 2 is a man of too good Interest to allow that in his Regt. Friday, 16th. The Regt. march'd into the Coun- try to give the Men a little exercise; this has been practised several days past by the Corps off duty; as they march with Knapsacks and Colours the People of the Country were allarm'd the first day; think those troops were sent out to seize some of the dis- affected People; finding that is not the case they are since grown very insolent. 1 Gabriel Maturin. \"Dec. 16. Yesterday died of a throat distem- per which is very prevalent in the army at this time Capt.

Desertions are still too frequent among us, tho' not as bad as it has been; last night a Soldier of the 10th deserted from his post at the Blockhouse, 2 where he was sentry; and this evening one of the 10th was taken as he was endeavouring to make his escape by the water side, but the night was too light and the sentry too vigilant for him. Sup'd this evening with Barron 3 at the Neck, and skated by moonlight. Sunday 18th. Very fine day; still frost. The 43d Regt. have been pumping out the Water in their Reservoirs, which smells so excessively strong that many of the Men drop down in fits while they are pumping. We have the use of a Church for our Men, but are obliged to go at \\ after eight in the morn, that we may not interfere with the Inhabitants. We this day heard from Portsmouth in New Hamp- shire that the Rebels had risen there and taken a Fort which was defended by a Capn. and 4 or 5 Men; they took away a great many Guns and 97 barrels of Powder, with 1500 Stand of small Arms, all which they have convey'd up the Country. Monday, 19th. Frost broke up, rained most of the day. The Somerset came into the Harbour, all well, as likewise the Swan, Sloop of War, Cn. Ays- cough from New York; the Yankys exceedingly 1 The fort on Castle Island in Boston Harbor, where Fort Inde- pendence now stands, was called Castle William or \"the Castle.\" 2 The Blockhouse was at the fortifications on the Neck, \" near the Marsh to the left of the Dyke.\" 3 Edward Barron, a lieutenant in one of the flank companies of the King's Own. He was afterward wounded at Bunker Hill. 1774] THE BRITISH IN BOSTON 13 disappointed at seeing the Somerset, as they were in hopes she was lost. The Harbour now cuts a formid- able figure, having four Sail of the Line, besides Frigates and Sloops and a great number of Trans- ports. Upon the News yesterday from Portsmouth, a Schooner was immediately dispatched there, and to day the Scarborough sail'd for there too. We shall see now whether the Genl. will do anything or not. Tuesday, 20th. Last night the weather clear'd up and turn'd to a hard frost, so that this morning the streets were cover'd with ice. I today mounted Guard at the Lines, which I found much improved since I was there last. Wed. 2 1 st. Last night still harder frost, the Sea was froze for a considerable way, the Cold more in- tense than it has yet been. Today was order'd an Officer, 1 Sergt., 1 Corpl., 1 Drumr., and 18 Private to get ready immediately to embark for Rhode Is- land, Lt. Knight of ours 1 for that duty; they were all got ready when the Adj t. went to the Adj t. Gen- eral to know where they were to parade, who told him they need not be in a hurry for that they might not sail this day or two — it wou'd not be amiss if some People wou'd write their Orders, so that they might be understood. Thurs. 22d. Snow all day. The Detachment not yet sailed; we hear it is to go to Rhode Island to bring away a quantity of Powder from a Vessel which has been drove in there, and which they are afraid to trust without a Guard. 1 Joseph Knight of the King's Own. He was afterward killed dur- ing the retreat from Concord on the 19th of April. i 4 THE BRITISH IN BOSTON [1774 Friday, 23d. Sleet and a little snow all day; one of our Men deserted; heard of robberies committed in the Country, most probably by some of the Deserters, who will do more harm than good, as nothing but Rascals go off; serve the Yankys right for enticing them away. Sat. 24th. Bad day; constant snow 'till evening when it turned out rain and sleet. A Soldier of the 10th shot for desertion; the only thing done in re- membrance of Christ-Mass day. It is said Genl. G e never pardons Deserters; at same time I don't think his manner of executing 'em sufficient examples, as he has only the Piquets of the Army out, instead of the whole, which wou'd strike a greater terror into the men. Punishments were never meant only to affect Criminals, but also as Examples to the rest of Mankind. The Common Guard has now got proper Orders, hitherto they 've had none; the Block-house is still in the same situa- tion; it is something extraordinary having Guards without giving them any Orders. The night before last two Men deserted, one from the King's Own the other from the 43 d. Sunday, 25 th. Snow all day, at night rain, sleet, and frost; dangerous walking. Govr. Wentworth, of Portsmouth, and all the Council have been order'd to quit that Province; I hear he is arrived here; the People of that Province seem to be worse than any other; and one wou'd imagine they had not so much business with it either; it is to be hoped they will get a greater share of punishment. There is a talk of a Spanish War, but I believe without foundation. Monday, 26th. Snow'd hard in morn.; at night, 1774] THE BRITISH IN BOSTON 15 frost. Order'd, a Guard of 1 Sergt. and 12 Men to protect the new Guard House at the North End where there is to be a Capn's. Guard. . . .

Tues. 27th. Fine weather and hard frost. Noth- ing new to day; the Orders hitherto exceedingly barren. Wed. 28th. A great fall of snow, hard wind, drifts of snow very disagreeable. This eveng. a Soldier of the 10th was drown'd: he had jump'd off a Wharf (where he was Gentry) to save a Boy who had fallen over; he succeeded iri his humane attempt for which he paid with his life. Thurs. 29th. Nothing extra'y today but a Quarter Master and all the Pioneers order'd to clear the Grand Parade, and the road to the Magazine, 1 from thence to the Officer's Guard on the Common; that Officer has now the charge of the Magazine; for a long time he had no orders whatever; they have at last given him proper ones; there is still an Officer's Guard at the Blockhouse without orders, a very unusual thing I fancy! Fri. 30th. To Days Orders. . . . The Alarm Guns will be posted at the Artillery Barracks, at the Com- mon, and at the Lines.

The 47th Regt. will draw up in Hanover Street, securing both the Bridges over the Mill Creek. 3 The 59th will draw up in front of the Court House. The Companies of 1 8th joined by those of the 65th together with the 10th, 23d, and 38th Regts. will draw up in the Street from the General's house 4 to Liberty Tree. Major Martin's compy. of 1 The Liberty Tree stood at what is now the corner of Wash- ington and Essex Streets, then an open space called Hanover Square, or Elm Neighbourhood. 2 Barton's Point was the point of land from which the bridge to East Cambridge now crosses the Charles River. 3 The; Mill Creek, which ran east of Canal Street, through Black- stone Street and along North Street into the old Town Dock, was crossed by two bridges, one at Hanover and one at North Street. 4 The Province House, which stood a little back from Washington (then Marlborough) Street, about opposite the Old South Church. The residences of some of the other principal officers were as follows: Hugh Earl Percy occupied \"the estate at the northerly corner of Winter and Tremont (then Common) Streets. An antique wooden house (belonging to Inspector Williams) in the midst of a delightful garden extending down Winter Street, and in rear to what is now Hamilton Place.\" \"Brigadier Pigott improves a house just above Liberty Tree.\" Maj.-Gen. Frederick Haldiman lived in the Elliot House on the corner of Tremont and Beacon streets, opposite King's Chapel. Admiral Graves lived on the southeast corner of Pearl and High streets, where he could have easy access to his ships. The Court House mentioned above stood in Court (then Queen) Street, on or near the site of the present City Hall Annex. 1774] THE BRITISH IN BOSTON 17 the Royal Artillery will move with expedition to the Lines, reinforcing the Neck Guard with 1 Commis- sion'd Officer, 2 Non-commission'd, and 12 Men; the remainder of the Royal Regt. of Artillery will get their Guns in readiness and wait for Orders. If an Alarm happens in the night the Troops will march to their Posts without loading, and on no ac- count to load their firelocks. It is forbid under the most severe penalty to fire in the night, even if the Troops shou'd be fired upon; but they will oppose and put to rout any Body (that shall dare to attack them) with their Bayonets; and the greatest care will be taken that the Counter-Sign is well known by all the Corps; and small Parties advanced that, in case of meeting, they may know their friends and not attack each other in the night through mistake. The Officers commandg. Regts. will reconnoitre the Streets leading from their Quarters to their respec- tive Alarm Posts, and fire on those they intend pass- ing through, each taking a different rout. These are Orders which one wou'd imagine shou'd have been given immediately upon the Troops coming into Winter Quarters. It 's probable we shou'd not have had 'em now, but for the frost which seems to threaten joining the Continent to the Town by the Ice which is already very considerable. ... In consequence of the above Orders, regimental ones were issued for Patroles to visit the Alarm Posts frequently in the night. Saty. 31st. Order'd this day a Guard of 1 Lt., 1 C, and 12 Ps. to mount tomorrow for the protection of the Wood Yard — also as it is expected that the weather may come on more severe, whenever that 1 8 THE BRITISH IN BOSTON [1775 happens the Guards will relieve their Centries every hour or half hour as the cold is more or less intense. 1775, Jany. 1st. Nothing remarkable but the drunkenness among the Soldiers, which is now got to a very great pitch, owing to the cheapness of the liquor, a Man may get drunk for a Copper or two. Still a hard frost. 3d. The Regt. march'd about 5 miles into the Country, the Snow in some parts was very deep, but was froze so that it wou'd all bear; Nothing now but Slays are used; it seems to be an expeditious way of travelling, but I think must be very cold as it can- not be any exercise. 5 th.

If any Officers of the different Regts. are capable of taking sketches of a Country, they will send their Names to the Dep. Adj. Genl. That is an extraordinary method of wording the Order; it might at least have been in a more genteel way; at present it looks as if he doubted whether there were any such. 1 1 The result of this general order was the selection of two officers, one of whom. Ensign De Berniere of the ioth, gives the following ac- count of its object: \"The latter end of February, 1775, Capt. Brown and myself received orders to go through the Counties of Suffolk and Worcester and sketch the roads as we went for the information of Genl.

Gaming having got to a very great length among many of the Officers, the Genl. lately expressed his disapprobation of a Club they have instituted for that purpose, but finding that of no effect, he has set on foot a Subscription for a Card Assembly, which will be very reasonable as there are rules that no Person is to play for above a certain Sum; a number of People have subscribed; they call it the Anti-Gambling-Club. I fancy the Genl. is try- ing to shame the other Club, but I dont believe he will succeed, as it's very rare seeing a Person alter who is once enter'd into that way unless it is by being incapable of continuing it, which I dare say will be the case of many of them before the Winter is over. On the 9th Inst., Govr. Wentworth issued a Proclamation couched in the most spirited terms, accusing those people who had forcibly enter'd the Castle of William and Mary at Portsmouth and taken from thence Barrels of powder, Cannon, and small Arms, of treason and rebellion; and exhorting all his Majesty's loyal Subjects in that Province to exert themselves in the detection of those high Offenders, and to use every means of bringing them to a punishment equal to their Crimes. Yesterday even, was a Ball by subscription; seven of each kerchiefs round our necks. . . . March 20th, rec'd further orders, from Genl. Gage to set out for Concord and examine the road and situation of the town, and also to get what information we could rela- tive to quantity of artillery and provisions.\" — De Berniere's Narra- tive. It was under the guidance of this De Berniere that the British went to Lexington and Concord on the 19th of April. 20 THE BRITISH IN BOSTON [1775 Corps was the number fix'd, and the Ladies were in- vited by the managers; this scheme was proposed by Mrs. G e, 1 and carried into execution by her favorites; by which she enjoyed a dance and an op- portunity of seeing her friends at no expense. 13th.

The Loyal and Friendly Society of the Blue and Orange met and dined at the British Coffee House, 1 some days previous to which they had a meeting to admit new Members and to appoint Stewards; many of the Loyal and Publick Toasts were accompanied by the discharge of a Vol- ley from 23 Grenadiers of the King's Own, agreeable to the custom of the Society; there were sixty eight. Members present. I was prevented being among them, by being on Guard. 20th. Late Lieut. Furlow of the Welsh Fuziliers was buried to day; he had been long ill of a consump- tion.

A Court of Enquiry is order'd to set next Monday, consisting of five field Officers, to enquire into the circumstances of the Riot. 1 23d. This day at 3 oclock P.

A party from the main guard was brought up with their Captain, together with another party from the Governor's. Had it not been for the prudence of two officers that were sober, the Captain of the Main Guard would have acted a second Tragedy to the 5th March, as he was much disguis'd with Liquor and would have order'd the guard to fire on the watch had he not been restrain'd. His name is Gore, being a Captain in the 5th or Earl Peircy's regiment. He was degraded not long since for some mis- demeanour.\" — Letters of John Andrews. This was the Capt.

Mr. Thomas who lives there has order'd his House to be fitted up for Barracks: it will hold them all, I make no doubt, but they will have a very pleasant time of it, as there are two or three Gentlemen who will be as civil to 'em as they can; indeed it will be for their own sakes, a motive that will carry a Man further than anything I know. 24th. This day the Court of Enquiry sat and took the evidence of some Officers concerned in the riot last Friday, it is supposed it will be a tedious affair, and will not be finished for some time; the same day the Watchmen were examined before the Select Men. — Our Regt. march'd about 7 miles into the Country, the only reason for it is to keep the men in health. — Lt. Knight returned to day with his Detatchment from Rhode Island, bringing the Powder with him; he reports the People there are more quiet than here. 25th. Several of the riotous Officers bound over to appear at the April Assizes, when I suppose the affair will drop, as they can't have any Jury but ac- cording to the new Acts which they are hitherto so much averse to. 26th.

To day orders were given for fourteen days salt provision to be embark'd for the Detachment at Marshfield; we hear from thence that everything is very quiet. 31st.

This day the Deer. Packet arrived; the Genl. got his letters last Monday by express; we don't yet hear that there is anything determined; I had two letters, but no news in either. A few days ago the Congress at Cambridge had the assurance to vote Adml. Greaves a Traitor to his country and voted also to petition the King that He wou'd re- lieve him from this Station and dismiss him the service; all this was in consequence of his having pressed several Men for something or other the Committee had done to him; the Adml. wants to burn their Town, and it is with difficulty the Genl. can prevent him; they certainly deserve it for their 1 Thomas Hawkshaw. 1775] THE BRITISH IN BOSTON 25 insolence.

This day 2 an Oration was delivered Dr. Warren, a notorious Whig, at the great South Meeting opposite the Governor's house, it was in commemoration of what they term the Massacre on the 5th of March 1770. It was known for some days that this was to be deliver'd; accordingly a great number of Officers assembled at it, when after he had finished a most seditious, inflammatory harangue, John Hancock stood up and made a short speech in the same strain, at the end of which some 1 Lieut.-Gen.

It was imagined that there wou'd have been a riot, which if there had wou'd in all probability have proved fatal to Hancock, Adams, Warren, and the rest of those Villains, as they were all up in the Pulpit together, and the meeting was crowded with Officers and Seamen in such a manner that they cou'd not have escaped; however it luckily did not turn out so, it wou'd in- deed have been a pity for them to have made their exit in that way, as I hope we shall have the pleas- ure before long of seeing them do it by the hands of the Hangman. The General hearing there was to be a procession at night upon the same occasion sent for the Select-Men, and told them that they had better not have any such thing as most likely it wou'd produce a disturbance, from which if any bad consequences ensued He wou'd make them answer- able; this put a stop to it and they did not put it in execution; the General in case they shou'd had order'd all the Regts. to be in readiness to turn out at a moment's warning, and strengthened some of the Guards. 20th.

Three Officers of the 5th put in arrest for a Riot, viz. Cn. G e, Messrs. Raym — d and Bel- leg — re; 1 the same evening another duel stop'd be- tween the Lt. Col. of that Regt. and Ensn.

Wallcott and put him in arrest likewise; there the affair rests. March 30th. The 1st. Brigade marched into the Country at 6 oclock in the morning; it alarmed the people a good deal. Expresses were sent to every town near: at Water town about 9 miles off, they got 2 pieces of Cannon to the Bridge and loaded 'em but nobody wou'd stay to fire them; at Cambridge they were so alarmed that they pulled up the Bridge. 1 Capt.

Robert Hamilton. John Andrews in his Letters gives an amusing account of his vain endeavors to get Hamilton to pay his debts. This was probably Sir Walter Scott's friend, of whom he writes in his diary on Aug. 6, 1814, \"A laugh with Hamilton whose gout keeps him stationary at Lerwick, but whose good-humor defies gout and every other provocation, concludes the ev'g.\" Lockhart adds a note explaining that it was Robert Hamilton, afterward Sheriff of Lanarkshire, a particular favorite with Scott; that he had fought gallantly and been wounded severely in the American war; and that, when upon his death-bed in 183 1, he gave to Sir Walter the sword which he had worn at Bunker Hill. 1775] THE BRITISH IN BOSTON 29 6th.

Last night between 10 and 11 oclock all the Grenadiers and Light Infantry of the Army making about 600 Men (under the command of Lt. Coll. Smith of the 10th and Major Pitcairn of the Marines) embarked and were landed upon the op- posite shore on Cambridge Marsh; few but the Com- mandg. Officers knew what expedition we were going upon. After getting over the Marsh where we were wet up to the knees, we were halted in a dirty road and stood there 'till two oclock in the morning waiting for provisions to be brought from the boats 32 THE BRITISH IN BOSTON [1775 and to be divided, and which most of the Men threw away, having carried some with 'em. At 2 oclock we began our March by wading through a very long ford up to our Middles: after going a few miles we took 3 or 4 People who were going off to give intelli- gence; about 5 miles on this side of a Town called Lexington which lay in our road, we heard there were some hundreds of People collected together in- tending to oppose us and stop our going on; at 5 oclock we arrived there and saw a number of People, I believe between 2 and 300, formed on a Common in the middle of the Town; we still continued advanc- ing, keeping prepared against an attack tho' with- out intending to attack them, but on our coming near them they fired one or two shots, upon which our Men without any orders rushed in upon them, fired and put 'em to flight; several of them were killed, we cou'd not tell how many because they were got behind Walls and into the Woods; We had a Man of the 10th light Infantry wounded, nobody else hurt. We then formed on the Common but with some difficulty, the Men were so wild they cou'd hear no orders; we waited a considerable time there and at length proceeded on our way to Con- cord, which we then learnt was our destination, in order to destroy a Magazine of Stores collected there. We met with no interruption 'till within a mile or two of the Town, where the Country People had occupied a hill which commanded the road; the light Infantry were order'd away to the right and ascended the height in one line, upon which the Yankies quitted it without firing, which they did likewise for one or two more successively. They 1775] TH E BRITISH IN BOSTON 33 then crossed the River beyond the Town and we march'd into the Town after taking possession of a Hill with a Liberty Pole on it and a flag flying which was cut down; the Yankies had that Hill but left it to us; we expected they wou'd have made a stand there, but they did not chuse it. While the Grena- diers remained in the Town destroying 3 pieces of Cannon, several Gun Carriages and about 100 bar- rels of flour, with Harness and other things, the Light Companies were detached beyond the River to examine some Houses for more stores; 1 of these Compys, was left at the Bridge, another on a Hill some distance from it, and another on a hill f of a mile from that; 1 the other 3 went forward 2 or 3 miles to seek for some Cannon which had been there but had been taken away that morning. 2 During this time the People were gathering together in great numbers, and taking advantage of our scatter'd dis- position, seemed as if they were going to cut off the communication with the Bridge, upon which the two Companies joined and went to the Bridge to support that Company; the three Compys. drew up in the road the far side the Bridge and the Rebels on the Hill above, cover'd by a Wall; in that situation they remained a long time very near an hour, the three Companies expecting to be attacked by the 1 The company left at the bridge was the light company of the 43d, under the command of Lieut.

The other two, posted on the hills near by, were the light companies of the 10th Regiment and the King's Own (with which was no doubt the writer of this diary). 2 These three light companies, under the command of Capt.

L e made his Men retire to this side the Bridge, which by the bye he ought to have done at first and then he wou'd have had time to make a good disposition, but at this time he had not, for the Rebels were got so near him that his people were obliged to form the best way they cou'd as soon as they were over the Bridge, the three com- panies got one behind the other so that only the front one cou'd fire; the Rebels when they got near the Bridge halted and fronted filling the road from the top to the bottom. The fire soon began from a dropping shot on our side, when they and the front Compy. fired almost at the same instant, there being nobody to support the front Compy. The others not firing the whole were forced to quit the Bridge and return toward Concord; some of the Grenadiers met 'em in the road and then advanced to meet the Rebels who had got this side the Bridge and on a good height, but seeing the manoeuvre they thought proper to retire again over the Bridge; the whole then went into Concord drew up in the Town and waited for the 3 Companies that were 1 Walter Sloane Laurie of the 43d. 1775] THE BRITISH IN BOSTON 35 gone on, which arrived in about an hour. 4 Officers of 8 who were at the Bridge were wounded, 1 3 Men killed; 1 Sergt. and several Men wounded; after getting as good conveniences for the wounded as we cou'd, and having done the business we were sent upon, We set out upon our return; before the whole had quitted the Town we were fired on from Houses and behind Trees, and before we had gone | a mile we were fired on from all sides, but mostly from the Rear, where People had hid themselves in houses 'till we had passed and then fired; the Country was an amazing strong one, full of Hills, Woods, stone Walls, &c, which the Rebels did not fail to take advantage of, for they were all lined with People who kept an incessant fire upon us, as we did too upon them but not with the same advantage, for they were so concealed there was hardly any see- ing them : in this way we marched between 9 and 10 miles, their numbers increasing from all parts, while ours was reducing by deaths, wounds and fa- tigue, and we were totally surrounded with such an incessant fire as it's impossible to conceive, our ammunition was likewise near expended. In this critical situation we perceived the 1st Brigade 2 coming to our assistance: it consisted of the 4th, 23d, and 47th Regts., and the Battallion of Marines, with two field pieces, 6 pounders, we had been flatter'd ever since the morning with expectations of the Bri- gade coming out, but at this time had given up all 1 These were Lieuts.

I since heard it was owing to a mistake of the orders or the Brigade wou'd have been with us 2 hours sooner. As soon as the Rebels saw this reinforcement, and tasted the field pieces they retired, and we formed on a rising ground and rested ourselves a little while, which was extremely necessary for our Men who were almost exhausted with fatigue; in about ^ an hour we marched again, and some of the Brigade taking the flanking parties we marched pretty quiet for about 2 miles ; they then began to pepper us again from the same sort of places, but at rather a greater distance. We were now obliged to force almost every house in the road, for the Rebels had taken possession of them and galled us exceedingly, but they suffer'd for their temerity for all that were found in the houses were put to death. When we got to Menot- omy 1 there was a very heavy fire; after that we took the short cut into the Charles Town road, very luckily for us too, for the Rebels thinking we shou'd endeavour to return by Cambridge had broken down the Bridge and had a great number of Men to line the road and to receive us there ; however we threw them and went on to Charles Town without any great interruption. We got there between 7 and 8 oclock at night, took possession of the hill above the Town and waited for the Boats to carry us over which came some time after; the Rebels did not chuse to follow us to the Hill as they must have fought us on open ground and that they did not like. The Piquets of the Army were sent over to Charles Town and 200 of the 64th to keep that 1 West Cambridge (now Arlington). 1775] THE BRITISH IN BOSTON 37 ground; they threw up a work to secure themselves, and we embarked and got home very late in the night. Thus ended this Expedition, which from beginning to end was as ill plan'd and ill executed as it was possible to be; had we not idled away three hours on Cambridge Marsh waiting for pro- visions that were not wanted, we shou'd have had no interruption at Lexington, but by our stay the Country People had got intelligence and time to as- semble. We shou'd have reached Concord soon after day break, before they cou'd have heard of us, by which we shou'd have destroyed more Cannon and Stores, which they had had time enough to con- vey away before our arrival; we might also have got easier back and not been so much harrassed, as they wou'd not have had time to assemble so many People; even the People of Salem and Marblehead above 20 miles off had intelligence and time enough to march and meet us on our return; they met us somewhere about Menotomy but they lost a good many for their pains. Thus for a few trifling stores the Grenrs. and Lt. Infantry had a march of about 50 Miles (going and returning) through an Enemy's Country, and in all human probability must every Man have been cut off if the Brigade had not fortu- nately come to their Assistance; for when the Bri- gade joined us there were very few Men had any ammunition left, and so fatigued that we cou'd not keep flanking parties out, so that we must soon have laid down our Arms, or been picked off by the Rebels at their pleasure nearer to and we not able to keep 'em off. 24th. The Rebels the day after the Action took 38 THE BRITISH IN BOSTON [1775 possession of Roxbury and still continue there, keep- ing the Town block'd up; their numbers there and at Cambridge are it is said 10 or 12000; there has been no communication with the Country since, the General not allowing any body to come in or go out; the Men of War have taken all the boats and the Lines are shut up; they are kept constantly in readi- ness for an attack which the Rebels threaten, but I dare say will not put in execution; they are now in such a good state of defence that it wou'd be no easy matter to force them. There is an Abbattis in front of the left Bastion, and across the road is a treple row of chevaux de frise. A Battery was yesterday began on the Hill above Charles Town Ferry, in order to defend the Somerset Man of War who lays in the Channel from any Battery which might be raised against her on a Hill on the Charles Town side where she cou'd not bring her guns to bear. An- other Battery is erecting for four guns close under the Blockhouse to command the Marsh to the left of the Dyke. 25 th. The Townspeople have to day given up their Arms to the Select Men, who are to deliver them over to the Genl. I fancy this will quiet him a little for he seemed apprehensive that if the Lines shou'd be attack'd the Townspeople wou'd raise and assist; they wou'd not give up their Arms without the Genl. promising that they shou'd have leave to quit the Town as many as pleased. Ever since the 19th, we have been kept in constant alarm; all Officers order 'd to lay at their Barracks. We can get no fresh provision, but must live upon our allow- ance of salt meat. We are in daily expectation of i 7 75] THE BRITISH IN BOSTON 39 the Troops coming here with General Howe &c; we then expect some alteration of Affairs. Our Soldiers the other day tho' they shew'd no want of courage, yet were so wild and irregular, that there was no keeping 'em in any order; by their eagerness and inattention they kilPd many of our own People; and the plundering was shamefull; many hardly thought of anything else; what was worse they were encouraged by some Officers. Apl. 26th. The King's Own, the Royal Welsh and the Marines encamped, the 1st upon Whoredom Hill, the 2nd on Fort Hill and the 3d on the Com- mon; the next day the 47th encamp'd upon the Common; the Regts. immediately threw up a few small Batteries in their front towards the Sea, which has formed a Chain from the Neck to the Nautilus Sloop of War laying at New Boston; 1 in front of the Marines is a Battery of four Cannon upon a small Hill, the others are smaller. May 1st. We Ve hitherto since we Ve been in Camp been very lucky in dry weather; it rain'd hard this morng. for the first time. The People some days past have had leave to quit the Town, and a great many are gone out. Great additions are made to the Neck; on the right flank of the right Bastion are mounted 4 Guns, and on the left of the left Bas- tion two Mortars. — at the Lines the Curtain is closed up to the road where there is a traverse with 2 guns which can play right up the Town of Roxbury.

Here is a report that the Mob at New York has disarmed that part of the 18th Regt. which is there and taken 'em Prisoners; whether true or not I can't say. The Rebels have erected the Standard at Cambridge; they call themselves the King's Troops and us the Parliaments. Pretty Burlesque! We are anx- iously wishing for the arrival of the Genl. Officers and Troops that are expected; we want to get out of this coop'd up situation. We cou'd now do that I suppose but the G does not seem to want it; there ? s no guessing what he is at; Time will shew: the worst of it is we are ill off for fresh provisions, none to be bought except now and then a little pork; Our Mess has luckily got a Sheep from a Friend of Capn.

Each Regt. of the 1st Brie, was order'd to mount at retreat beating a Piquet of iC, 2 S., 2 Sts., 2 Cls., 2 D., 40 Private, the Common and Magazine Guard to be discontinued, the King's Own Quarter Guard mounting at the Magazine. The General now allows to the working Men 2 Gills of rum each a day. Upon our encamping We got our allowance of Batt and forage Money, he allowed us 200 days forage which made it 8£. 15s., but tho' he has been spoke to several times yet he won't make up to us the 100 days forage that we were en- titled to last Year.

A few days after the affair of the 19th the Detach- ment from Marshfield arrived here; they quitted 1 South Boston 1775] THE BRITISH IN BOSTON 43 that place in good time for the Rebels had sent 4 or 5000 Men there to cut 'em off, which they must have done if the Vessels for our People had not arrived as they did. May 5th. A most shocking piece of Villany was discover'd about the time of our affair with the Rebels; it was a scheme to cut off all the Officers of the Garrison. Upon the 24th, the day we were to keep St. Georges day, the Rebels were to make a feint Attack in the night upon the Lines: a number of Men were to be posted at the Lodgings of all the Officers, and upon the Alarm Guns firing they were to put the Officers to death as they were coming out of their houses to go to their Barracks. What a set of Villains must they be to think of such a thing! but there is nothing be it ever so bad that these people will stick at to gain their ends. Upon the G 1 finding this out He order'd all the Officers to lay at their Barracks, where those who are not encamped still continue. 1 6th.

We are still in the same situation, the People every day quitting the Town with their effects, and those Government People of the Country coming in; of them indeed there are but few; the Rebels still keep us block'd up, not allowing any Provisions to be brought into Town; it is imagined their numbers about the Town amount to about 12000; a few days since those at Cambridge (which is Head Quarters) were muster'd, and there were 7400, at Roxbury there must be between 2 and 3000, and about Charles Town nearly the same. Upon the Hill where the Church is at Roxbury they have four Guns ; they have plenty other Guns, but I don't find they have any Batteries. nth. A Vessel last night arrived from New- York. By three Officers who came in her we learn that as soon as the intelligence of our Affair on the 1775] THE BRITISH IN BOSTON 45 19th April got there, the Mob rose up, seized the Town Arms, and were going to destroy a Transport laying at a Wharf; they first went to seek for Capn. Montague, who commands a Ship of War there; they found him at dinner at a Gentleman's house; they wanted him to give his hand that he wou'd not interfere; however he put 'em off by some means, and made his escape on board, when he immediately sent his Boats armed, and had the Transport tow'd under his ship's stern; that part of the 18th Regt. which is there are obliged to keep close in their Bar- racks, only just a few going to Market. The People say they may go to England if they please, but that they won't allow 'em to come here. Most of the Friends to Government finding things so bad there are gone off to England. Hancock and Adams went to New York last Saturday; they were met on the road by a Troop of Light Horse, a Company of Gren- adiers and one of Light Infantry (Rebel Troops) who conducted them into the Town where they had a Guard of 100 Men.. When this Vessell came away the Town was in the utmost confusion, every Body arming in defence of their liberty, as they call it, which is the liberty of smuggling and breaking the Laws as they please.

From 12 oclock last night 'till 7 or 8 this morn, the Rebels continued beating to Arms, firing Cannon and small Arms, and making false fires; their reasons we have not yet learned. 17th. The reason for the above is said to be on acct. of Dr. Franklin's arrival at Philadelphia. 1 8th. About 9 oclock last night a fire broke out in the Barracks of the 65 th Regt. on a Wharf near the Market: 1 every house on the Wharf, amounting to 41, was burnt to the Ground, and most of the things in them; the 65th lost their Arms, Cloathing, and everything; and the 47th has lost 4 Companies cloathing; the loss altogether is considerable as they 1 Faneuil Hall Market. 48 THE BRITISH IN BOSTON [1775 were all stores on the Wharf and full of Goods. — A chest of Bullets was found in Hancock's store. 1 Coll.

Several shots fired at the Glasgow; it 's what the fools frequently do, but without any harm, from the great distance. 20th.

The rebels spoken of were countrymen from Weymouth. 1775] THE BRITISH IN BOSTON 49 they landed they were fired on from the opposite shore but without receiving any harm the distance being so great; the party did not return the fire but kept on carrying the hay to the boats, 'till at last the Rebels in great numbers got into Vessels and Boats and went off for the Island; the party then em- barked and sailed off with what hay they had, and as they were obliged to go along shore they were fired on, when Lt. Innis 1 who commanded was at last forced to return the fire, and a few of the Rebels were killed, without any loss on our side. It was surely the most ridiculous expedition that ever was plan'd, for there were not a tenth part boats enough even if there had been Men enough, and the Sloop which carried the Party mounted 1 2 guns, but they were taken out to make room, whereas if one or two had been left it wou'd have effectually kept off the Rebels; there was not above 7 or 8 Tons brought off and about 70 left which the Rebels burnt. 22d.

All the other Recruits order'd to be formed as soon as possible. 1 Capn., 2 Subs, and 50 Men order'd out to night on a secret expedition, and the same number order'd for tomorrow morn, at 4 oclock.

Generals Howe, Clinton, and Burgoyne arrived in the Cerberus, Cn. Chads.

Yesterday afternoon about 40 of the Rebels came to Noddles Island 1 expecting to meet with hay to destroy : they set two houses on fire and began killing the Cows and Horses, which the Adml. seeing immediately dispatched the Marines from the Men of War to drive the Rebels away, and at the same time sent some Boats and an armed Schooner 1 They were Provincials, sent by order of the Committee of Safety for the removal of livestock from the islands. Noddle's Island is now East Boston. * Qemr<il \"John Hurgtynt 1775] THE BRITISH IN BOSTON 51 round the Island to intercept them; the Rebels as soon as they saw this scour'd off as fast as they cou'd and escaped by wading up to their necks; one was killed in the flight; after this there was a con- stant firing at each other from the opposite sides of the water, but I believe without any mischief; there was also firing at and from the Schooner and boats, which continued all night and part of this morning. I fancy we are the greatest sufferers for some time in the night the schooner run aground within 60 yards of their shore, and after a cannonade a considerable time on both sides, having no chance of saving the Schooner as the tide was going out, they were obliged to set her on fire and quit her, without being able to save a single article; she was quite new and just that day came in from a Cruize; she mounted 4 guns and 10 swivels. A reinforcement of 100 Ma- rines was sent over to the Island last night; they had last night two 3 pounders from the Cerberus with which we kept a cannonade great part of the night, and this morning two 1 2 pounders field pieces were sent over with a detachment of Artillery, which has been playing on the Rebels most of the morning, but I dare say without doing much harm as it was at a great distance; about 2 oclock they left the Island and came off home. I hear we have 2 killed and 2 wounded with Sailors and Marines. 29th. To day the Rebels were seen again on the same Island; all the light Infantry Companies were immediately order'd to parade, which took up a long time as many Men were on duty and obliged to be relieved. In about 2 hours we were dismissed, and the Rebels left to do their business quietly, which by 52 THE BRITISH IN BOSTON [1775 6 oclock in the even, they effected: they drove all the Cattle and Sheep off to the Main and set lire to four houses; at 8 oclock a house was set on fire at Hog Island which is very near the other. I suppose after the light Companies were order'd, it was thought hardly worth while running the risk of losing any lives by endeavouring to save a trifling property which we have no connexion with, nor indeed cou'd it be worth while for it cou'd be of little consequence to us, and their burning the houses (which are only Out house and Barns I believe) can answer no other end than insulting us, and what we have not in our power to resent, for tho' we have new Generals come out, yet they have brought no more authority than we had before, which was none at all. The Corps to day waited on the three General Officers lately arrived; politely reed. Another addition was order'd to day of 4 S., 4 C, 80 Pri. from the different Corps to do duty with the Artillery, they have now 1 80, besides that they are so weak that the other Corps are obliged to give 'em a Guard for their Park of Artillery. Another house was burnt beyond Dorchester Neck on Moon Island and we cou'd perceive a fire some where beyond Cambridge, I suppose Tories Houses. May, 30th. The Rebels this morning set fire to a dwelling house upon the same Island: the house was almost close to the shore and within reach of the Admiral's Guns, which have been playing upon the Island every now and then most of the morning, whether because any Men were seen or only just to frighten them I don't know; a schooner was also sent 1775] THE BRITISH IN BOSTON 53 to fire along shore; they had better take care not to run aground and get burnt by the Yankies, like the last. Near this house there was an outhouse where there were several Navy stores, which the Admiral has been taking out all day, and to protect the Men at that work he sent a flat Boat with a gun in it along shore, which has been firing frequently at the Rebels I suppose. This morning the 5 th, 38 th, and 52d encamp'd in the Fields adjoining the Common; those Companies of the 43 d which were on Copps Hill removed to the other part of the Regt. at Bar- ton's Point and 6 Companies of the incorporated Corps took up their ground.

Officers of Corps to order the Men's Cartridges to be examined every day, and for every Cartridge missing not ac- counted for, such soldier to be charged one penny. Some Cattle lately brought from Hallifax is to be divided among the Troops, who are to receive two days fresh provisions this week. 31st. Nothing extraordinary but the Rebels prac- tising with Cannon up the Country. The Senegal arrived from England. June 1st. Last night a Ball passed over our Camp, fired from Town. The Cerberus this morning sailed down to Nantasket Road, to be in readiness to sail in a few days. Some of the idle Fools frequently fire small Arms at the Glasgow, and at our Camp; us they never reach, but they sometimes stick a Ball in the Ship, who never returns it tho' she has it in her power to drive 'em to the D 1. 2d. The Lively and Nautilus came up, the Lively 54 THE BRITISH IN BOSTON [1775 took the place of the Somerset, who went further down there not being water enough. — A Prize was lately taken of a Ship loaded with flour, this will make up for what was lost in the fire. 3d. This day the Lovely Nancy who went to England some months ago, returned from there, bringing Necessaries for the Army; in her came Col. Prescott now made a Brigadier General. 4th. This being the King's Birth-day, the Men of War fired a Royal Salute, but it being Sunday noth- ing was done by the Troops. At 8 oclock this evening an order was issued for the Grenadrs. and Light Infantry to be embodied and to encamp tomorrow morning at 9 oclock. 5th. At 9 this morning the Grenrs. and Lt. In- fantry assembled at their ground, where they found nothing settled, no ground marked out for them nor was there anybody to mark it out or show them where to encamp; after waiting a considerable time, we set about pitching the Tents as we cou'd settle ourselves, the Grenrs. on the right, the Light In- fantry on the left; the whole was not finished till 6 or 7 oclock, and after all it was then wrong and we must have to move again, for the Streets are only single, by which means we have taken up twice the ground we ought. Every thing still of a Piece! Lt. Col. Clark our Commanding Officer, Mr. Batt (who is out of the Army) our Adjt. and Volunteer Eng- land our Qr. Master. To day in honour of his Majesty's Birthday at 12 oclock was fired a Royal Salute at the Lines, which was followed by the Royal Artillery on the Com- mon, and then three Vollies from all the Piquets 1775] THE BRITISH IN BOSTON 55 assembled and drawn up in King Street. At 1 oclock the Rebels likewise fir'd from Roxbury Hill, they fired but 9 rounds, it 's imagined some accident happen 'd to their Guns as they fired no more. 6th. Major Smelt of the 47th Regt. is appointed Major to the Corps of Grenadiers. 7th. The Companies of Light Infantry paraded this morning at 6 oclock together, for Coll. Clark to look at them. He seems proud of the honor of com- manding them, but I fear if we go upon any service it will be too much for his Constitution which is a very bad one. 1 Major Butler of the 65th Regt. is appointed our Major. Mr. Batt having resigned the Adjutantcy, Lt. Welsh of the 23rd is appointed to it, he belongs to the Light Company; it is somewhat extra'y that they shou'd before have chosen a Man entirely out of the Army. 8 th. A Return order'd to be given of the Non- commission M Officers and private Men of the Light Companies, who are not fit for the Service. Our Company since the Affair of the 19th has never been compleated owing to the pusillanimity of the Commanding Officer of the Regt. 2 who was afraid 1 It is curious after reading such an opinion of this officer, Lt.-Col. George Clerk of the 43 d, to find that he, with Abercromby and a few others, is specially mentioned for praise, in Gen. Gage's General Orders of June 18 th, for his conduct at the Battle of Bunker Hill. His corps of Light Infantry, among whom was the writer of this diary, were with the right wing led by. Gen. Howe, which attacked the American Line at the rail fence. See also note to the entry of Nov. 9. 2 Probably Lieut.-Col. George Maddison of the King's Own. The colonel, Lieut.-Gen. Studholm Hodgson, was Governor of Fort Au- gustus near Inverness and does not appear to have come to America. 56 THE BRITISH IN BOSTON [1775 of disobliging the Captains by taking any of their Men from them to compleat the Light Company: We have lately got a few since we were embodied, but we are not yet compleat. In to days Orders were the following Promotions: 10th Regt. Charles Ste- phenson Gent, to be Ensign, vice Delapp who retires 30th March 1775. — 23d Regt. John Brown Gent, to be 2d Lieut. Vice Furlow deceased 1st March 1775. — 43rd Regt. John Wier Gent, to be Ensign Vice Dalrymple prefer'd 21st March 1775. — 59th Regt. Capt. Jas. Figg to be Captn. vice Mcdonald who retires 29th March 1775; Lt. Geo. Herbert to be Capn. Lieut, vice Figg; Ensn. Ambrose Simp- son to be Lieut, vice Herbert; Wm. McCleod to be Ensn. vice Simpson. — John Jones to be Chaplain to the Hospital at Boston N. A. 3d Feby. 1775. At 4 this morning 2 Captns., 8 Subalns., and 200 Light Infantry were sent over to Noddles Island to bring off some Hay, which was effected without re- sistance. The Rebels indeed fired at 'em from the opposite shore but without doing any harm: there was a very small quantity of hay and that so bad that its only fit for litter; for such a paltry thing one wou'd think it was not worth while running the risk of losing a single Man, but I suppose the G 1 had received wrong information. Three Officers of the 43d Regt. had today a very narrow and lucky escape, being out in a Boat sailing and not able to manage the Boat, the Wind drove 'em over to the Rebels shore who began firing on them; the Officers then had nothing but to swim for it as they found it impossible to keep off with the Boat, so they jumped over board and were swimming for the Glasgow 1775] THE BRITISH IN BOSTON 57 Man of War, who as soon as they saw their situation sent a Boat to their assistance which picked 'em up, one was so much spent that he cou'd not have swam much longer. The Villains ashore kept all the time popping at 'em; but luckily did not hit either; they also kept firing at the Man of Wars Boat; the Glas- gow fired a Cannon at them which made the Rascals run and hide themselves; as soon as the Gentlemen were landed a boat was sent with swivels in her and armed Men, to bring off the boat the Officers had quitted which had not reached the shore but was stuck on the Mud; the Rebels tried to prevent them by firing from their lurking places, but the Tars kept them aloof with the Swivels and brought the Boat off; while they were doing that the Glasgow seeing some Men near the House opposite let fly a shot among 'em to keep 'em from going down to the shore to fire at the Boat; they run off and did not shew themselves again. 9th. Genl. Orders. Mr. Simms Surgeons Mate to the 43d Regt. is appointed to attend the Corps of Light Infantry. This day a detachment of 2 Captns., 8 Subs., and 200 Men of the Corps of Light Infantry landed at Noddles Island, near 6 oclock in the morning, for the purpose of bringing off Hay, which was effected without any loss; advanced Parties took possession of the Heights, and were scandalously abused by the people from the opposite shore; the Troops took no notice of them, tho' fired at frequently, the detach- ment did not fire a shot; there was a very small quantity of Hay and that good for nothing but litter; scarce worth sending 200 Men for one wou'd imagine. 58 THE BRITISH IN BOSTON [1775 nth. Genl. Order. As there are several Men of the Corps of Light Infantry and Grenadiers who are unfit for service, they are immediately to be sent to their Regts. and others to be sent in lieu of them. 1 2th. Genl.
