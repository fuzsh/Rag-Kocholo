        "text": "Family Background and Social Status\n\nDespite the economic opportunities afforded by the commercial and financial revolutions of the late 17th century, social mobility was not much apparent in the House of Commons, where seats were still in large measure the preserve of the established elite. Of course, this statement begs an important question: who or what constituted ‘the established elite’? Professor I.R. Christie, in a published analysis of the social background of 18th-century MPs (covering the period from 1715-1820) sought to establish a definition on which most historians could agree, even if expressed in negative terms: ‘non-elite’ in his formulation meant ‘not born and bred in the landed society of aristocracy and gentry which constituted the traditional ruling class and from which came the majority of the Members of the House of Commons’. In essence, the gentry were ‘set apart from the “non-elite” by their style of life [consumption, leisure] and ownership of land’. Other possible criteria might well have included a family history of involvement in the institutions of central and/or local government, and indeed of representation in Parliament, for, as another commentator has noted, ‘to be an MP was and remained the most certain measure of rank, apart from an heritable title’. However, even if we are able to agree on a means of defining the ‘elite’ in late 17th- and early 18th-century Britain, there remain some significant difficulties in assessing the status of individual Members and their families, not least the variable quality of genealogical and biographical information available, and the tendency of family historians (and, it might be added, of contributions to this History) to emphasize patrilineal descent at the expense of matrilineal.\n\nConceding the limitations of the evidence, some generalizations may be attempted. Even if we look no further back than two generations, almost half of all the Members in this period can be shown to trace their descent from titled families. Some 77 (14%) were the sons or grandsons of peers (with either English, Scottish, or Irish titles), 383 (19.3%) the sons or grandsons of baronets, and 330 (16.6%) the sons or grandsons of knights; amounting in all to 990 (that is to say 49.9%) of the Membership as a whole. Separating out a the Scottish contingent, we find that the proportion of Scottish MPs descended from titled families was even higher: 34.2% sons or grandsons of peers, 20.3% of baronets, and 13.9% of knights, making 68.5% in all. By way of comparison, among MPs for English or Welsh constituencies, the cumulative figure is 48.8%. In all, 95 Members succeeded to peerage titles themselves (57 English titles, 12 Scottish and 26 Irish); and a further 307 succeeded to baronetcies.\n\nAnother simple test of ‘elite’ status, at least for English and Welsh Members, would be descent from a parliamentary family, although differences between the representative systems of England (and Wales) and Scotland, and the quality of the information on Scottish Members available to this History, make it inappropriate to extent this analysis to Scotland. As many as 908 English and Welsh MPs in this period were the children or grandchildren of parliamentarians, again almost half the total representation (48.5%). If this list is merged with the number descended from titled families, the total would increase to 1,149, that is to say 61.3% of the Membership for England and Wales.\n\nEvidence relating to the social status of the remainder is more varied in nature, some of it very slender, and thus impossible to treat systematically. Clearly the vast majority were themselves landed men, despite the almost obsessive anxiety shown by ‘Country’ back-benchers throughout the period over the alleged invasion of the House by the ‘moneyed interest’. When a Landed Qualification Act was eventually passed, in 1712, it exposed very few landless Members. However, the gradations of social status, extent of wealth and income, and balance between real and personal estate, often elude precise definition. Social distinctions between ‘gentlemen’ in early modern England are notoriously difficult to make, whether, for example, one wishes to separate armigerous squires from ‘mere’ gentlemen, ‘greater’ from ‘lesser’ gentry, or, to use yet another terminology popular among social historians, ‘county’ from ‘parish’ gentry; and even if historians could establish acceptable criteria for these different classification schemes, the material contained in the biographies would not necessarily permit such tests to be applied to the Members of Parliament in 1690-1715. Authoritative statements of wealth or income are equally scarce, except for those few individuals who have left for posterity detailed accounts of their estates. Often the evidence is only partial, deriving from incomplete estate records or testamentary papers, or even entirely impressionistic, being based on nothing more than the conjectures of admiring or resentful contemporaries. Nor is it always possible to separate landed wealth from an income derived from professional earnings, in legal fees or the salary and perquisites of government office, or from the profits of trade and manufacture. Effectively professional men and businessmen have to be placed in the same category as country gentry if, at the same time as pursuing a successful professional career, they had themselves became landed proprietors, and thus had clearly joined the social ‘elite’. Moreover, in many cases such men were themselves the younger sons of landowners, who, after making careers for themselves, had purchased estates with the proceeds.\n\nWealth and land were of course not necessarily synonymous. Traditional landed proprietors could well be on the margins of insolvency, while some ‘new men’, in the professions and trade, were very wealthy indeed. The House certainly included peers’ sons and country squires with very broad acres and no hint of financial embarrassment: the great aristocratic families like the Berties, Cavendishes, Cecils, Comptons, Finches, Saviles, and Seymours; and substantial squires like the Curzons of Kedleston in Derbyshire, the Kynastons of Hordley in Shorpshire, the Nortons of Southwick in Hampshire, the Portmans of Orchard Portman in Somerset, and two outstanding individuals, Thomas Sclater of Catley in Cambridgeshire, who died in 1736 reputedly worth £200,000, and Sir William Ellys, 2nd Bt., who lived at his newly built mansion, Nocton Hall in Lincolnshire, it was said, ‘like a prince in his palace’. Some had the good fortune to possess extensive estates with valuable mineral resources, like the Blacketts and Wortley Montagus, whose rent rolls were enhanced by the yield from their collieries. Others had secured their fortunes at the altar, most notably perhaps George Granville (the 1st Lord Lansdown), the Welshmen Francis Herbert and Richard Vaughan II, and William Shippen, whose marriage was said to have brought him £70,000 in ready money. But alongside these wealthy landowners were the debtors. From a plethora of examples we will cite only three: Charles Lord Bruce, heir to the Ailesbury earldom, whose family estates were encumbered with debts of £70,000, forcing the sale of the ancestral home at Ampthill Park in Bedfordshire; Sir John Cotton, 4th Bt., whose substantial inheritance was the subject of litigation. and whose seat, at Conington Castle in Huntingdonshire, was in an advanced state of dilapidation; and Thomas Mansel I of Margam, who from a rent roll of £10,000 a year could find only £3,500 in disposable income, and, despite the profits of office (as comptroller of the Household), accumulated liabilities of over £16,000.\n\nContemporary estimates of individual wealth tended however to focus on the riches accumulated by merchants, manufacturers and other social climbers, partly because the extent of personal estate, especially in cash or stocks, was easier to calculate than income from property; partly because ‘new money’ seemed to many to be somehow unnatural and almost scandalous, and attracted gossip. The scale could be vast: thus Sir John Bucknall was confidently said to have inherited at least £100,000 from his father, the tax farmer Sir William†, and Jeffrey and John Jeffreys to have shared as much as £300,000 from their uncle’s estate. Rumour valued the deceased Samuel Shepheard I’s estate at £800,000, that of Gregory Page at anywhere between £500,000 and £800,000, (Sir) Gilbert Heathcote at between £400,000 and £700,000, Sir James Bateman at £400,000, and ‘Diamond’ Pitt (Thomas I) at £300,000. Fortunes of this magnitude were not only to be made in business, however: Henry Guy’s acquisition of an estate supposedly worth over £140,000 was owing to his long tenure of government office as much as to his interventions in high finance, and the same could be said of Sir Stephen Fox, Robert Benson, and of course for the notorious James Brydges, later 1st Duke of Chandos, for whom the place of paymaster-general offered such opportunities for gain, both legitimate and illegitimate, as to constitute a veritable goldmine. Sir Robert Sawyer made his money at the bar, Nicholas Barbon and Sir William Pulteney through property development in and around London, and the Dutch gamester Sir John Germain through a less orthodox and less respectable, but equally lucrative profession.\n\nMost Members therefore belonged among the social elite in their own right, almost by definition, the few exceptions being small businessmen, and the occasional attorney, returned for provincial boroughs. But in respect of their origins a substantial minority should be accorded ‘non-elite’ status (in Professor Christie’s formulation). The biographies of 34 Members state explicitly the fact of humble birth. Such tales of exceptional social mobility were relished, and preserved for posterity, by contemporary snobs like the 1st Earl of Egmont (John Perceval†), though in this respect malicious gossip does not always prove accurate. John Bromley I, the returned Barbadian planter, while not the armigerous squire his pedigree claimed, does not seem to started life as a ‘pedlar’, which was Egmont’s gloss on his obscure origins. Similarly Arthur Moore, whose pedigree was certainly not illustrious and whose upbringing in County Monaghan had been modest, is still unlikely to have been the son of a gaoler, as his detractors alleged. And without any question the East Indiaman Gregory Page, another victim of Egmont’s tongue, was far from being a ‘drayman’ made good, but the eldest son of an alderman of London. Among the others, Sir Owen Buckingham, the wealthy sailcloth manufacturer, came from a line of innkeepers; Nicholas Carey, another prosperous businessman, was the son of an unlicensed London physician and occasional publisher; Edmund Halsey, the great brewer, had been a ‘miller’s boy’; and John Hutton II, the archetypal lad of parts, a Dumfries-shire shepherd taken up by the local Presbyterian minister and educated until he eventually became a court physician. The greatest success stories probably belonged to that insalubrious trio of self-made City plutocrats Sir Robert Clayton, Sir Thomas Cooke, and John Ward IV, who were, respectively, the sons of a Northamptonshire carpenter, a Lambeth hatmaker, and a Lincolnshire dyer; and that self-styled ‘wonderful child of Providence’ Sir Stephen Fox, who rose from a cottage in Wiltshire to be in his own estimation ‘the richest commoner in three kingdoms’, a lord of the Treasury, mentor (and creditor) of dukes, and the progenitor of a great political dynasty.\n\nFor these and most other social meteors the most effective means to advancement was commerce and industry: as many as 23 of the 34 Members said to be of humble birth were businessmen of one kind or another, all but three of them based in London (the exceptions being John Mounsher the Portsmouth ropemaker, Thomas Richmond the Maldon tanner, and John Wilkins the Leicestershire coal baron). In addition Leonard Gale was the son of an ironmaster who had brought him up as a gentleman; Bromley and Sir Thomas Lear, 1st Bt., were West Indians; and Arthur Moore, had started out as an attorney before diversifying his interests into stocks and shares. Besides Moore there were two other lawyers (Joseph Girdler and Sir George Hutchins), one medical man (Hutton), and a quartet who may loosely be described as ‘civil servants’ (James Craggs I, Richard Markes, the 1st Earl of Sunderland’s protégé John Mountsteven, and the minor diplomat and man of letters, Matthew Prior).\n\nIn as many as 35 cases the biographies fail to provide any indication of parentage, and in a further 19 the evidence is at best tentative. These figures of mystery, at least as far as their social origins are concerned, are again for the most part merchants, many of them this time local worthies, like Edward Bangham in Leominster, John Blanch in Gloucester, John Chambers and Edward Clarke II in Norwich, and Roger Hoar in Bridgwater, but also some City figures like John ‘Vulture’ Hopkins, (Sir) Joseph Martin, Sir George Mathews and the New East India Company mogul Samuel Shepheard I. The list also includes military personnel, among them the professional soldiers Robert Crawford, Edmund Maine, Francis Palmes, John Shrimpton, and Henry Withers, and Admiral Sir John Norris.\n\nThere are other Members whose biographies indicate no family history of landed proprietorship (though of course this would not necessarily mean financial insecurity, let alone penury). Given the nature of the evidence, and indeed an inherent imprecision in the notion of what made a man a ‘landed proprietor’, this classification cannot be watertight. However, in compiling the list certain principles have been adopted: a Member has been classified as coming from a ‘non-landed’ family if his father appears to have possessed no substantial landed estate; had acquired land only after success in a profession, or in business, or (more rarely) as a result of a fortunate marriage; or held his property within the urban area in which he practised his profession or trade. On the other hand, we have classified as the descendant of a ‘landed’ family any Member whose father had made a successful professional or business career (the profits of which may have allowed him to purchase land) but was himself the younger son of a landed proprietor and can thus be said to have originated in the milieu of the landed gentry; or who combined a profession and landownership in the manner of some successful lawyers and parsons. In this way it is possible to identify a further 207 Members from ‘non-landed’ families, among whom merchants, manufacturers and lawyers are once again well represented, with a sprinkling of soldiers, sailors, and ‘civil servants’. In addition six Members had fathers who came from a landed background but had forfeited their estates—Henry Cornish, Henry Ireton, Simon Mayne, Sir Theophilus Oglethorpe, Craven Peyton and Sir John Swinton (though in Peyton’s case he was allowed to keep a single manor from his father’s estate)—and a further six came from families which had slipped down the social ladder through some other catastrophe, dynastic or financial (Samuel Atkinson, Admiral Sir George Byng, John Hill, Owen Hughes, Richard Steele, and another admiral, Sir Charles Wager).\n\nA particular sub-group, on the frontier of the professional and landed classes, were the sons of the parsonage, or sons of the manse; in other words, the 48 Members who were the offspring of English clergymen, and a further three (Sir Samuel McClellan, Robert Urquhart, and Sir James Wishart) the sons of Presbyterian ministers in Scotland. These clerical parents ranged in status from bishops (Dolben and Sharp of York, Beaw of Llandaff, and Burgh of Ardagh), down to relatively humble parish incumbents, such as John Pitt, the rector of Blandford Forum in Dorset, father of Thomas Pitt I of diamond fame, and ancestor of the Earl of Chatham. Few could be described as well-off, not even the cathedral clergy, a fact confirmed by the experience of the prophet of ‘politeness’ Joseph Addison, born as he was into genteel poverty as the eldest son of the dean of Lichfield. Life would have been even harder for the five Members whose fathers were Dissenting ministers, three of whom (the fathers of Sir Charles Hotham, 4th Bt., Samuel Ogle, and Samuel Travers), had been ejected from their livings as a result of the Restoration church settlement.\n\nThe limited degree of upward social mobility in this period, even for those ‘new men’ from outside the established social elite who had been able to make their way into Parliament, is apparent from the creation of new titles, in the peerage, baronetage and knighthood. The relationship between parliamentary Membership and this very obvious form of social advancement is however much less easy to demonstrate: it is often unclear whether a gain in social status preceded, or came as a result of, election to Parliament, or whether both were a consequence of other factors, such as the acquisition of material wealth or political influence.\n\nOf the 126 Members for whom peerage titles were created (99 English titles, 21 Irish and 6 Scottish), no less than 112 (88.9%) already belonged to the social elite, in the minimalist terms in which we have already identified it, that is to say with a father or grandfather who himself possessed a title, or a seat in Parliament. Among the remainder only four came from identifiably ‘non-landed’ families, the lord chancellors Peter King, Sir Thomas Parker and Sir John Somers, and the prominent Country Whig politician Sir John Thompson, 1st Bt. In addition Admiral Byng, later Lord Torrington, came from a landed family which had recently fallen on hard times, his father having been obliged to sell the family estates in Kent, and the young Byng being raised in fear of the bailiffs and eventually sent to sea to make his fortune. None had risen from what contemporaries would have considered truly humble origins to a peerage in one generation, the nearest being Parker, whose father, an attorney in Staffordshire, was suffering serious professional difficulties while the future lord chancellor was a child. Thompson’s father was a well-to-do London merchant who had flourished during the Interregnum and enjoyed considerable influence with the Cromwellian regime; Somers came from a family of minor gentry in Worcestershire; and King was the offspring ‘of worthy and substantial parents’, from the mercantile elite of Exeter.\n\nAmong the new baronets, the proportion of ‘non-elite’ Members was a little higher: 51 of the total of 87 (58.6%) hailed from recognisably titled or parliamentary families, but only three had made their way from really humble beginnings (the City merchants Sir John Cutler, Sir Henry Furnese and Sir William Hodges), while a further 13 were from families which can be shown to be ‘non-landed’ (including Byng again).\n\nPredictably the number of social climbers among the knights was greater still: 224 Members were knighted, but only 80 (35.7%) came from families within the existing social elite (that is to say with a titled or a parliamentary seat in the previous two generations). However, the number from recognizably ‘non-landed’ families was still a minority: 69 altogether (30.8%), including three who had originally come from landed families, but whose immediate ancestors had fallen on hard times (Byng, yet again, the political writer Richard Steele, and Admiral Sir Charles Wager). More than half (37) of these mushroom knights came from the world of commerce, including a number of eminent figures in the City of London, who may have been honoured for their municipal rather than their parliamentary achievements, together with nine lawyers, five more admirals, and one civil servant (Sir Cyril Wyche).\n\nMarriage, although bringing instant wealth to some Members, rarely if ever served as a means of social advancement. For men a ‘good’ marriage, in a material sense, was more likely to be a recognition, or reward, of enhanced social status. The British social elites were markedly endogamous. Of those Members who became connected by marriage with a titled, or an established parliamentary, family (that is to say those with a father-in-law or brother-in-law possessing a title of some kind, or a seat in the House of Commons), 953 in all, as many as 695 (73.0%) were themselves descended from that same social milieu. Moreover, if we look more closely at the Members who appear by this crude yardstick to have entered the marriage market from outside society’s charmed circle, we find that in fact most hailed from landed families. Only 61 of the Members marrying into the ‘elite’ could not claim a landowning pedigree. No more than six are known to have risen from humble circumstances: Sir John Cutler, Sir Henry Furnese, Sir William Hodges, Sir George Hutchins, Sir Thomas Lear, and John Pollexfen); while in relation to a further eight no firm indication of parentage has been found (Thomas Bliss, Ralph Bucknall, Robert Burridge, Edmund Mayne, Sir John Norris, John Shrimpton, John Stewart, and Robert Yard).\n\nIt was also the case that in the marriage stakes the most impressive financial gains were made by established elite families rather than parvenu adventurers, the greatest prizes falling into the hands of the aristocracy, who could of course offer social prestige in return for mere wealth. Here the picture presented by the biographies is of course profoundly affected by accidents of survival, and conclusions must be very tentative. Of the Members for whom we have enough reliable evidence to indicate the financial profit made at marriage (such as an original marriage settlement or contract), 171 may be said to done exceptionally well, taking the criterion to be a portion (tocher in Scotland) equivalent to £3,000 in ready money or £1,000 a year. Only 29 fail to conform to the basic definition of the social elite (that is to say a father a grandfather with a title, or a seat in Parliament), and only 12 originated from ‘non-landed’ families, though not particularly obscure (John Anstis, John Barlow, Oley Douglas, Sir Stafford Fairborne, Thomas Farrington, Peter King, Sir John Parsons, Samuel Sambrooke, Salwey Winnington, Christopher Wren, and Sir Cyril Wyche):. A further 89 Members would appear from the evidence of the biographies to have done well out of marriage, though the evidence of the size of the portion is not specific: 27 would be outside our minimalist definition of the social elite, but all except Sir Owen Buckingham and Leonard Gale came from landed families (and Gale had been brought up as a gentleman, while Buckingham’s greatest coup came on his sixth visit to the altar, by which time he was already a rich man). The very largest windfalls went to those already at the top of the social pyramid. From those with precisely calculable portions, we find 37 heiresses worth £10,000 or more, and as many as 19 married into the peerage, including the dukedoms of Beaufort and Devonshire, the marquessates of Exeter and Halifax, and the earldoms of Ailesbury, Derby, Oxford, Sandwich, Sunderland, and Sutherland. However first prize had already gone to the ‘great projector’, Thomas Neale. His most lucrative coup was marriage in 1664 to the heiress Elizabeth Garrard, who brought with her from her previous marriage to Sir Nicholas Gould, 1st Bt.†, the princely sum of £120,000, and won her delighted husband the sobriquet ‘Golden Neale’ from the envious denizens of the Restoration court.\n\nThus although the House of Commons was to some degree representative of the rising professional and business classes of later 17th-century England—lawyers, soldier, sailors, and civil servants, merchants, manufacturers, and financiers—it was still overwhelmingly an assembly of landed proprietors. ‘New money’ did not find the doors of Parliament barred, but the scales were still weighed against it. Upward social mobility was possible, but still relatively slow, for men of low birth, except for those very exceptional creatures who rose to the heights of the legal profession, and who in a single lifetime could travel as far as Lord Chancellor Peter King, from the obscurity of the provincial bourgeoisie (albeit relative obscurity in his case) to a peerage. Businessmen, however wealthy, even the financiers to whom the government kow-towed in order to safeguard public credit, would have to wait for their sons and grandsons to ascend the highest ranks of the social order. Membership of Parliament could be of assistance in this process, but it seems unlikely that parliamentary service by itself was a motor of social advancement. In general those who rose from humble origins had already climbed a long way before being elected to Parliament, and their seat in the Commons was a recognition of status already achieved as much as a means of further promotion to come.\n\nAge\n\nDates of birth have been supplied for as many as 1,880 of the 1,982 Members whose biographies appear in these volumes (nearly 95%), albeit in many cases approximate or conjectural year-dates. It is possible, therefore, to make some calculations relating to the age of Members at the time of their first election to Parliament, and at the opening of each Parliament in this period. The reader should bear in mind, however, the limitations imposed by the lack of precision in the available data, as well as by the absence of the 106 Members whose date of birth cannot even be estimated. Of these lacunae, a disproportionate number occur among the Members for Scottish constituencies, as many as 26% (28 out of 108) of the biographies lacking a birth-date (as compared with 4%, that is to say 75 out of 1874, of the Members for English and Welsh constituencies). The fact that so many Scots had already served in their own parliament before their appearance at Westminster is also a differentiating, and complicating, factor. In estimates of the age profile of each Parliament the Scottish Members have therefore been considered separately, while in calculations based on the age of Members at their first election to Parliament, they have not been considered at all.\n\nIn the late 17th and early 18th centuries it was common to embark on a parliamentary career early in life. As the following table shows, almost three quarters of the Members who served in this period for English and Welsh constituencies (excluding those for whom no date of birth is known) had already entered Parliament by the time they reached 40, and a substantial proportion had been elected while still in their twenties, the combined figure of those elected under the age of 31 reaching over 40 per cent.\n\nAge of Members at first election (England and Wales only):\n\nYouth was, however, more clearly a feature of parliamentary entrants from the landed classes. A similar statistical exercise undertaken for the three main occupational groups represented in the Commons—lawyers, officers in the armed forces, and ‘businessmen’—shows in each case a lower percentage elected for the first time in their twenties than that for the Membership as a whole, and a higher percentage who had been elected for the first time in their forties. These age differences were most pronounced among ‘businessmen’, of whom no less than 58.5% were elected for the first time after they had passed their 40th year, which compares with a figure of 28.7% for all English and Welsh Members. The majority of lawyers made their parliamentary debuts in their thirties and forties, at least in some cases after they had acquired experience, reputation and wealth from practice at the bar. The situation prevailing among army and naval officers was rather more complicated: those who had risen through the ranks often entered Parliament relatively late in life, but an equally significant number were the offspring of aristocratic or greater gentry families, who had purchased their commissions when young men and who might also be provided in much the same way with a parliamentary seat. Note that for the purposes of calculation, the category of ‘lawyers’ has been defined so as to include all those who were called to the bar in England, admitted to King’s Inns in Dublin (and therefore permitted to practise at the Irish bar), or practised as civilians, but not the handful of Members who were attorneys. No further attempt has been made to distinguish lawyers as professionally active or inactive, since the evidence available in the biographies is inconsistent on this point. Any Member who held a commission in the army or navy in this period has been classified under ‘armed forces’, while the number of ‘businessmen’ include manufacturers, overseas and domestic merchants, financiers, transatlantic planters, and property developers, but not those country gentlemen who may have been able to exploit the coal or mineral deposits on their estates.\n\nLawyers\n\nArmed forces\n\nBusinessmen\n\nNarrowing the analysis to those Members elected for the first time within this period, yields a set of general results very close in percentage terms to the previous analysis of age at first election of all English and Welsh Members sitting in the period.\n\nAge at first election of Members elected for the first time in the period 1690-1715 (England and Wales only)\n\nSeparate analysis by occupational group again shows little change, except for a slight increase in the proportion of lawyers chosen for the first time after the age of 40. Among those Members classified as being in trade, the percentage chosen for the first time when over 40 appears even stronger if we look only at parliamentary entrants within the period, the figure now standing at 62.7%, though it should be noticed that unpublished calculations by Dr P.L. Gauci, comparing the ages of Members at their first election across the period 1660-1715, show a substantial increase after 1690 in the number of ‘merchants’ (according to his definition) returned to Parliament before their 40th birthday. Our own calculations are as follows:\n\nLawyers\n\nArmed forces\n\nBusinessmen\n\nThe most remarkable instances of a Member making his first appearance on the parliamentary stage at an advanced age were nearly all merchants, turning to parliamentary politics late in life: the Londoners Sir John Morden, 1st Bt., and Sir William Turner, elected for the first time at the ages of 72 and 75 respectively; the Leghorn merchant Robert Balle, chosen for Ashburton in 1708 when about 74; John Verney, 1st Viscount Fermanagh [I], the younger son of a Buckinghamshire squire who was apprenticed into the Levant trade, and who eventually secured a seat as knight of the shire a month before his seventieth birthday; the great philanthropist Edward Colston II, whose local popularity made him an obvious choice as a figurehead for the Tory counter-attack in Bristol in 1710, despite the fact that he was well into his seventies; and William Joliffe, whose third marriage in 1686, at the age of 64, brought him into alliance with a parliamentary family of note, the Trenchards of Dorset, and 16 years later the chance of election on the Trenchard interest at Poole. The exception was Major-General Edmund Maine, returned for Morpeth in 1705 when in his early seventies. Other Members who had originally been elected as young men lived on to a great age while retaining their parliamentary seats, the most remarkable being the veteran Whig Sir John Maynard, whose Commons career went back to the Short Parliament of 1640, and who eventually died in October 1690, still MP for Plymouth, at the age of 86.\n\nAt the other extreme were the Members elected before reaching their majority. Although against the custom of Parliament, the practice of returning minors to seats in the House of Commons went back at least to the early 16th century. It was brought to the attention of the House in 1678, when a protest was made against the presence in the House of two of Lord Danby’s (Sir Thomas Osborne†) relations, aged 17 and 18 respectively, and again in 1685, when a motion to expel two teenage MPs was ‘passed over’. Sir Joseph Williamson observed that not only had the issue ‘never yet [been] resolved expressly by the House’, it had in fact been ‘ever industriously avoided’. The Membership of the Convention in 1689 included Montagu Venables-Bertie*, Lord Norreys, a knight of the shire (for Oxfordshire) at only 16, and in the first two general elections of this period the presence of minors seems to have become even more common. Venables-Bertie was re-elected in 1690, accompanied by three 20-year-olds, Sir John Bolles, 4th Bt. (Lincoln), Henry Henley (Lyme Regis) and Hon. Richard Montagu (Huntingdon), by the 19-year-old Alexander Popham (Chippenham), and by the young Tory firebrand, Sir John Pakington, 4th Bt., who took one of the county seats in Worcestershire at the tender age of 18. Another minor, Thomas Trenchard, who had been returned to the Convention on his family’s interest for Dorchester but had lost his seat in 1690 to Sir Robert Napier, 1st Bt., was seated on petition in the December following the general election, in spite of the fact that counsel for Napier explicitly raised the question of his age (as a secondary line of attack once their main arguments had been foiled), and even went so far as to produce a baptismal certificate. The committee had resolved that Trenchard enjoyed a majority of qualified votes, but left the matter of his qualification to the full House, which then endorsed the report without any explicit declaration on the question of age. These seven Members were joined at by-elections by the 17-year-old Sir John Leveson Gower, 5th Bt., at Newcastle-under-Lyme, by Michael Hill and Henry, Lord Hyde, both returned for Cornish boroughs aged 20, and another 20-year-old, Sir John Walter, 3rd Bt., at Appleby. In the next election, in 1695 Leveson Gower was re-elected, still under age, together with no less than 10 other minors, the most obvious being Lord Godolphin’s (Sidney) son Francis, brought in for the family’s borough of Helston at 17, and Hon. Robert Bertie (Westbury), who was 18.\n\nIn 1690 the issue of Thomas Trenchard’s minority had not only been ‘left undetermined’ but effectively undebated. At this point the young man’s uncle, Sir John Trenchard *, had observed that ‘the ancient Parliament men are generally of opinion that the exception of minority is frivolous and that my nephew ought to sit’. Yet by the beginning of the following Parliament the climate of opinion had undergone a radical change, possibly as a reaction against the influx of under-age Members during the lifetime of the 1690 Parliament and at the 1695 general election; possibly also because of a strengthening in the Country party, whose adherents placed a higher premium on seriousness and gravitas among the representatives of the people. Whatever the reason, the new House of Commons included in its electoral reforming Act of 1696 (7 & 8 Gul. III, c. 25) a clause declaring\n\nThat no person whatsoever, being under the age of 21 years, shall at any time hereafter be admitted to give his voice for election of any Member of Parliament ... and that no person hereafter shall be capable of being elected a Member to serve in this or any future Parliament, who is not of the age of 21 years; and every election or return of any person under that age is hereby declared to be null and void ....\n\nAt first this provision was generally observed, but as time went by it came to be frequently honoured in the breach. Admittedly, at the next general election, in 1698, two minors were chosen and allowed to sit, Hon. William Cecil (Stamford) and William Tulse (Lymington), but two more of the young Members from the 1695 Parliament who would not yet have been properly qualified did not seek re-election (Godolphin and Greville). Alongside William Cecil, who sat undisturbed throughout four Parliaments until eventually reaching his majority in 1703, there appears to have been only one under-age Member in the first Parliaments of 1701—John, Lord Mordaunt (Chippenham), and two in the second—Richard Ellys (Grantham) and Lewis Pryse (Cardiganshire). In 1702 Cecil was the only minor returned, but in 1705 there were five, and although in 1708 the number dropped again to only one—Robert Furnese in Truro—the 1710 Parliament saw four more and the 1713 Parliament five.\n\nOf the 43 Members returned to Parliament as minors in this period no less than 18 were the sons of peers (proportionately a slight fall from the comparable figure produced by the previous section of the History, which stood at 24 out of 43 for the period 1660-90). In addition, though commoners, the financier Sir Henry Furnese* and former Secretary of State Sir Charles Hedges* were both men of wealth and influence, able to provide borough seats for their sons, Robert Furnese and William Hedges. Equally significant was the number of under-age MPs who had already succeeded to their estates and therefore stood as representatives of their families. They included the Irish peer Lord Scudamore and as many as ten baronets. Robert Clarges was the younger son of a baronet, but had inherited a substantial portion of the family estate on his father’s death. Eight more were country gentlemen whose fathers had predeceased them: Allen Bathurst, Montagu Garrard Drake, John Hoskins Gifford, Henry Henley, Alexander Popham, Lewis Pryse, Thomas Trenchard and William Tulse. The constituencies for which these under-age Members sat tended to be boroughs rather than counties, with some notable exceptions: Hon. Langham Booth in Cheshire, Lord Burghley in Rutland, Lord Norreys in Oxfordshire, Sir John Pakington in Worcestershire, Lewis Pryse in Cardiganshire, Sir Richard Sandford, 3rd Bt., in Westmorland, Hon. Philip Sydney in Kent, and Hon. Francis Willoughby in Nottinghamshire. Otherwise pocket boroughs were well represented, particularly in Cornwall, where Helston, Launceston, and Truro each returned one under-age Member, and Saltash two. It was obviously easier to smuggle a young nominee through the process of election when what was essentially taking place was the nomination of the Members by one or more patrons. Yet even when a minor stood as a candidate in a contested election it was rare for his age to be raised as an objection against him. Thomas Trenchard’s age only became an issue after his election in 1690. Similarly, although Langham Booth’s Tory opponents in Cheshire in 1705 made his minority an argument of their petition, nothing had been made of this at the poll; and that in one of the most fiercely fought county elections of the early 18th century.\n\nSome idea of general trends across the period may be gained from analysing the Membership of each Parliament in terms of the age of Members at their election to that Parliament. Members for English and Welsh constituencies have been treated separately from the Members for Scottish constituencies, who only figure from 1707 onwards. It may be worthwhile to begin by recalling the percentage figures for the Parliaments of 1685 and 1689, as recorded in the preceding section of the History.\n\nAnalysis of age of Members in the Parliaments of 1685 and 1689\n\n1685\n\n1689\n\nPercentage aged under 21\n\n2%\n\n1%\n\nPercentage aged 21-30\n\n17%\n\n15%\n\nPercentage aged 31-40\n\n25%\n\n27%\n\nPercentage aged 41-50\n\n24%\n\n25%\n\nPercentage aged 51-60\n\n20%\n\n18%\n\nPercentage aged over 60\n\n11%\n\n12%\n\nComparable statistics for English and Welsh Members for the Parliaments of 1690-1715 reveal a perceptible general trend across the period: overall, percentages in the lower age bands fall during the 1690s, then rise after 1701, while those in the higher age bands gradually decrease, perhaps as a result of the greater frequency of elections, and the higher turnover of seats. However, short-term movements are erratic, showing, for example, an inexplicable rise in the percentage of Members over 50 in the First Parliament of 1701, and another peak in 1707 which is probably to be accounted for by the influx of senior Scottish MPs immediately after the Union.\n\nThe Parliament of 1690\n\nAge at election\n\nNumber (/613)\n\nPercentage\n\nunder 21\n\n10\n\n1.6%\n\n21-30\n\n109\n\n17.8%\n\n31-40\n\n179\n\n29.2%\n\n41-50\n\n140\n\n22.8%\n\n51-60\n\n113\n\n18.4%\n\nover 60\n\n62\n\n10.1%\n\nThe Parliament of 1695\n\nAge at election\n\nNumber (/548)\n\nPercentage\n\nunder 21\n\n11\n\n2.0%\n\n21-30\n\n93\n\n17.0%\n\n31-40\n\n152\n\n27.8%\n\n41-50\n\n145\n\n26.5%\n\n51-60\n\n91\n\n16.6%\n\nover 60\n\n56\n\n10.2%\n\nThe Parliament of 1698\n\nAge at election\n\nNumber (/486)\n\nPercentage\n\nunder 21\n\n1\n\n0.2%\n\n21-30\n\n90\n\n16.9%\n\n31-40\n\n141\n\n26.4%\n\n41-50\n\n165\n\n30.9%\n\n51-60\n\n87\n\n16.3%\n\nover 60\n\n50\n\n9.4%\n\nThe Parliament of 1701\n\nAge at election\n\nNumber (/486)\n\nPercentage\n\nunder 21\n\n3\n\n0.6%\n\n21-30\n\n82\n\n16.2%\n\n31-40\n\n131\n\n25.8%\n\n41-50\n\n136\n\n26.8%\n\n51-60\n\n110\n\n21.7%\n\nover 60\n\n45\n\n8.9%\n\nThe Parliament of 1701-2\n\nAge at election\n\nNumber (/500)\n\nPercentage\n\nunder 21\n\n4\n\n0.8%\n\n21-30\n\n98\n\n19.6%\n\n31-40\n\n135\n\n27.0%\n\n41-50\n\n135\n\n27.0%\n\n51-60\n\n92\n\n18.4%\n\nover 60\n\n35\n\n7.0%\n\nThe Parliament of 1702\n\nAge at election\n\nNumber (/545)\n\nPercentage\n\nunder 21\n\n3\n\n0.6%\n\n21-30\n\n111\n\n20.4%\n\n31-40\n\n152\n\n27.9%\n\n41-50\n\n147\n\n27.0%\n\n51-60\n\n90\n\n16.5%\n\nover 60\n\n42\n\n7.7%\n\nThe Parliaments of 1705 and 1707\n\nAge at election\n\nNumber (/530)\n\nPercentage\n\nunder 21\n\n3\n\n0.6%\n\n21-30\n\n117\n\n22.1%\n\n31-40\n\n142\n\n26.8%\n\n41-50\n\n132\n\n24.9%\n\n51-60\n\n100\n\n18.9%\n\nover 60\n\n36\n\n6.8%\n\nThe Parliament of 1708\n\nAge at election\n\nNumber (/536)\n\nPercentage\n\nunder 21\n\n1\n\n0.2%\n\n21-30\n\n120\n\n22.4%\n\n31-40\n\n143\n\n26.7%\n\n41-50\n\n138\n\n25.7%\n\n51-60\n\n102\n\n19.0%\n\nover 60\n\n32\n\n6.0%\n\nThe Parliament of 1710\n\nAge at election\n\nNumber (/585)\n\nPercentage\n\nunder 21\n\n3\n\n0.5%\n\n21-30\n\n124\n\n21.2%\n\n31-40\n\n167\n\n28.5%\n\n41-50\n\n151\n\n25.8%\n\n51-60\n\n96\n\n16.4%\n\nover 60\n\n44\n\n7.5%\n\nThe Parliament of 1713\n\nAge at election\n\nNumber (/524)\n\nPercentage\n\nunder 21\n\n0\n\n0%\n\n21-30\n\n121\n\n23.1%\n\n31-40\n\n144\n\n27.5%\n\n41-50\n\n130\n\n24.8%\n\n51-60\n\n82\n\n15.6%\n\nover 60\n\n49\n\n9.4%\n\nThe general trend is easier to see if we consolidate the total percentages for those Members aged 40 and under at the time of their election, and those aged over 51.\n\nParliament\n\nPercentage under 41\n\nPercentage 51 +\n\n1690\n\n48.6%\n\n28.5%\n\n1695\n\n46.8%\n\n26.8%\n\n1698\n\n43.5%\n\n25.7%\n\n1701\n\n42.6%\n\n30.6%\n\n1701-2\n\n47.2%\n\n25.4%\n\n1702\n\n48.9%\n\n24.2%\n\n1705\n\n49.5%\n\n25.7%\n\n1708\n\n49.3%\n\n27.0%\n\n1710\n\n50.2%\n\n23.9%\n\n1713\n\n50.6%\n\n24.0%\n\nComparable statistics for the Scottish Members are much less useful, given the smaller numbers involved, and the higher proportion of Members for whom no birth-date can be conjectured.

At least 54 are said to have been educated ‘privately’ or ‘at home’, a group which naturally includes a generous sprinkling of noble families: Cavendishes, Cecils, Comptons, Russells, and Thynnes, as well as those from Dissenting or ‘conforming Presbyterian’ backgrounds, like Peter King and Grey Neville, and one Scotsman, John Forbes of Culloden. A few Members had been sent abroad to begin their education with a private tutor, Thomas Coke in Rotterdam, for example, Robert Yard in The Hague, James Brydges at Wolfenbüttel, while at the onset of the crisis over the Popish Plot, in 1678, William Savile, son of the 1st Marquess of Halifax, had been despatched to the physical and moral safety of the Calvinist republic of Geneva.\n\nAttendance at a particular school has been established in 352 of the biographies. Among the great public schools the most popular were Eton, numbering at least 49 Members (and possibly as many as 57) among its alumni, and Westminster with at least 46 (and possibly two more). Some way behind came St. Paul’s (17), Winchester (at least 14, and a possible four more), and Merchant Taylors’ (13). Rugby and Shrewsbury were also moderately well represented, with nine and eight Members respectively, though tending to draw their pupils from a distinctively regional base. Even more localized was the intake of the various grammar schools, a great number of which participated in the education of Parliament-men in this period. The grammar school at Bury St. Edmunds stands out, with as many as 15 Members (more than all but three of the public schools), but the only other grammar schools to produce more than two MPs in this period were Exeter with four, and Brentwood, Cheam and Ruthin, with three each. A few Members were obliged to venture much further afield: John Verney, later Lord Fermanagh, began his schooling in the Loire valley, at Blois; while Hon. Sidney Wortley Montagu, was translated in 1662 from a small establishment in Twickenham to the ‘academie’ of M. du Plessis in Paris. Joseph Dudley was unique in his American schooling: the son of a governor of Massachusetts, he attended a ‘free school’ near Boston.\n\nIn 12 cases it has been possible to establish that Members attended Dissenting academies, the most popular being that run by Samuel Birch at Shilton, in Oxfordshire, which educated four Members, including, by a considerable irony, such future champions of the High Church cause (and supporters of the 1714 Schism Act) as Simon Harcourt I and Edward Harley. Other Dissenting tutors with future MPs under their care were Ralph Button at Islington (1), Charles Morton at Newington Green (1), Thomas Triplett at Hayes (2), and John Woodhouse at Sheriffhales in Shropshire (2). In the immediate aftermath of the Restoration, and while the Clarendon Code was still being enacted, the 1st Lord Wharton sought to preserve the moral integrity of his sons, Goodwin and Thomas, and to inculcate into them his own Presbyterian religious beliefs, by sending them to the Protestant academy at Caen. The attempt proved a spectacular failure.\n\nAltogether 973 Members had attended a university, almost half the number sitting in this period (49.1%). The percentage remained remarkably constant from Parliament to Parliament, as the following table indicates.\n\nParliament\n\nNumber at university\n\nTotal of Members\n\nPercentage\n\n1690\n\n326\n\n622\n\n52.4%\n\n1695\n\n290\n\n560\n\n51.8%\n\n1698\n\n282\n\n545\n\n51.7%\n\n1701\n\n268\n\n531\n\n50.5%\n\n1701-2\n\n265\n\n515\n\n51.5%\n\n1702\n\n293\n\n556\n\n52.7%\n\n1705\n\n300\n\n553\n\n54.2%\n\n1707\n\n309\n\n577\n\n53.6%\n\n1708\n\n322\n\n600\n\n53.7%\n\n1710\n\n325\n\n644\n\n50.5%\n\n1713\n\n306\n\n579\n\n52.8%\n\nSome comment is required on the figures for the Parliaments after the Union. The proportion of Scottish Members recorded as having attended university is substantially lower than for English and Welsh Members, 38.0% (41 out of 108) as against 49.7% (932 out of 1,874), which suggests that, as far as the English and Welsh were concerned, there had been a slight but significant rise in numbers towards the end of this period. In this respect, however, the disparity between MPs north and south of the border may be more apparent than real, and may be accounted for, at least in part, by difficulties with the sources, there being no published admission registers for the universities of Edinburgh and St. Andrews, which are thus in all likelihood seriously under-estimated in our statistics.\n\nOnly 155 of the 912 Members admitted to Oxford or Cambridge, the universities for which the History records information concerning graduation, went on to take their degree, that is to say some 17.0%. A further 17 were complimented with doctorates, ten at Oxford and seven at Cambridge, usually for political rather than academic reasons, despite having no previous link with the university. Sir Richard Vyvyan, 3rd Bt., Horatio Walpole II, and Dixey Windsor all proceeded to college fellowships without having graduated, Vyvyan at Oxford, and Walpole and Windsor at Cambridge. In all 24 Members pursued academic advancement as far as a college fellowship, their numbers divided between the two ancient English universities, though only Isaac Newton, Thomas Paske, and (until he abandoned lecturing in Greek at Christ Church, Oxford, for a brief career as an army bureaucrat) Henry Watkins, viewed their university employment as a professional vocation.\n\nIn all 600 English and Welsh Members attended Oxford University (plus one Scot, John Hutton II) and 312 Cambridge, perpetuating an imbalance established long before 1690. An analysis, Parliament by Parliament, of the relative numbers of Oxford and Cambridge men, shows the older university clearly preponderant throughout, the difference becoming even more pronounced in Parliaments (such as those of 1702, 1710, and 1713) dominated by the Tories.\n\nParliament\n\n1690\n\n1695\n\n1698\n\n1701\n\n1701-2\n\n1702\n\n1705\n\n1708\n\n1710\n\n1713\n\nCambridge\n\n106\n\n96\n\n97\n\n87\n\n84\n\n91\n\n101\n\n107\n\n94\n\n92\n\nOxford\n\n219\n\n199\n\n190\n\n182\n\n179\n\n203\n\n201\n\n198\n\n199\n\n208\n\nIf we attempt an identification of Members by party, taking care not to force any individual classification, and indeed omitting all those who cannot be described consistently throughout their parliamentary careers in this period as being of a particular party orientation, we find a sharp difference between the two universities, with Toryism far more pronounced among those educated at Oxford. Not that these figures necessarily tell us anything about the respective political climates of Oxford and Cambridge in this period, since in each case the cohort of Members from whom the statistics have been drawn includes many whose experience of university life went back 20, 30, 40, and in some cases even 50 years. The totals and percentages (Members for England and Wales only) are:\n\nFor Oxford:\n\nTories\n\n323\n\n(53.8%)\n\nWhigs\n\n199\n\n(33.1%)\n\nunclassified\n\n(or changed\n\nallegiance)\n\n78\n\n(13.0%)\n\nFor Cambridge:\n\nTories\n\n130\n\n(41.7%)\n\nWhigs\n\n133\n\n(42.6%)\n\nunclassified\n\n(or changed\n\nallegiance)\n\n59\n\n(18.9%)\n\nA further seven of the Members for English and Welsh constituencies had been undergraduates at Trinity College, Dublin. Not surprisingly, they were all from families resident in Ireland, the single exception being John Povey, whose English father was serving as a judge on the Irish bench at the time of his admission. As a Presbyterian from the north-east of England, Samuel Ogle had an obvious motivation in going to university in Scotland, but he was not entirely alone among his compatriots, since the Cumbrian Richard Musgrave was awarded a degree at Edinburgh in 1698, admittedly after having attended Oxford first. Joseph Dudley continued his education in Massachusetts by progressing to Harvard. Continental universities also attracted a few English Members. Six each went to Utrecht and Leiden (half of them after a spell at either Oxford or Cambridge), and two to Rotterdam. As many as 21 attended the university of Padua, but 14 of these had also been to Oxbridge, and for the majority their time at university in Italy served as no more than an extension of their experience as continental travellers, with Padua a convenient base of operations.\n\nAmong the Scots, the largest number of university-educated Members, at least 12 (and possibly four more), had been to Glasgow. Then came Aberdeen with nine (five at Marischal College and four at King’s), Edinburgh with four (and perhaps two more), and St. Andrews with two (the last two figures almost certainly understated, given the nature of the evidence available to the History ). Twelve Scottish Members attended university in the United Provinces: eight at Leiden (five of them having begun in Scotland, and then transferred to a Dutch university to study civil law), one at Utrecht (and another possible, John Pringle, who had previously been an undergraduate at Edinburgh), and two at Franeker. John Hutton II acquired his primary medical education at Padua, before going to Oxford, and his fellow physician Charles Oliphant completed his at Rheims. In addition Alexander Murray of Stanhope was said to have been educated ‘at a foreign university’, but the location is not specified.\n\nA separate analysis of Members’ legal education is only appropriate for Englishmen, Welshmen and Irishmen, who were obliged to attend an inn of court. Scottish lawyers completed their legal training at university (usually abroad), admission to the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh conferring in effect a licence to practice, corresponding to a call to the bar in England. Among the Members for English and Welsh constituencies, 696 were admitted to an inn of court. Of these, at least 11 (and possibly 12) were also admitted to an inn of chancery, while in addition Lawrence Carter I as a member of Clement’s Inn but was never entered at an inn of court. Just under 40 per cent of those admitted to an inn proceeded to the bar (271 in all). The majority of those nominally enjoying a legal education were young gentlemen, from wealthy landed families, using their time at the inn either to acquire a smattering of knowledge of the law (or even to provide themselves with a pied-à-terre in London). Chronological analysis, Parliament by Parliament, of the numbers of Members who had been admitted to an inn, reveals a small increase until 1698, then a steady, if equally gentle, decline:\n\nMembers admitted to an inn of court (England and Wales only):\n\nParliament\n\nNumber at inn\n\nPercentage of\n\nMembers\n\n1690\n\n254\n\n40.8%\n\n1695\n\n231\n\n41.3%\n\n1698\n\n230\n\n42.2%\n\n1701\n\n211\n\n39.7%\n\n1701-2\n\n203\n\n39.4%\n\n1702\n\n220\n\n39.5%\n\n1705/7\n\n223\n\n40.3%\n\n1708\n\n198\n\n37.2%\n\n1710\n\n214\n\n36.5%\n\n1713\n\n180\n\n34.5%\n\nAllowing for 28 Members who transferred from one inn to another, and three more who were each admitted to three inns, the most popular inn was the Middle Temple, which admitted 239 Members, followed by the Inner Temple with 215, Gray’s Inn with 141, and Lincoln’s Inn with 136.

The Inner Temple was the most distinctively Tory of the inns, as far as Members of Parliament were concerned. We should remember, however, that these figures do not necessarily tell us anything of the political orientation of the particular inn during the period 1690-1715, since the respective cohorts include Members whose time as students of the law may have been in (what was for them) the remote past.\n\nInn\n\nTory\n\nWhig\n\nunclassified (or changed allegiance)\n\nGray’s Inn\n\n68\n\n51\n\n22\n\nLincoln’s Inn\n\n66\n\n50\n\n20\n\nInner Temple\n\n109\n\n73\n\n32\n\nMiddle Temple\n\n100\n\n99\n\n40\n\nThe same analysis, undertaken for those Members called to the bar, shows a more substantial Tory majority even among Middle Templars.\n\nInn\n\nTory\n\nWhig\n\nunclassified\n\n(or changed allegiance)\n\nGray’s Inn\n\n28\n\n15\n\n6\n\nLincoln’s Inn\n\n19\n\n16\n\n4\n\nInner Temple\n\n47\n\n30\n\n10\n\nMiddle Temple\n\n46\n\n36\n\n14\n\nIt remains to consider how many Members undertook the lengthy period of continental travel which many felt to be necessary in order to apply the finishing touches to a polite education; what would later be known as the ‘Grand Tour’, usually with Italy as its ultimate destination. In all at least 157 (possibly 158) Members travelled in this way for educational purposes, 95 of whom had also attended, or were to attend, a university. Nearly all were Englishmen or Welshmen, the Scots presumably being deterred by the expense. Besides the Duke of Roxburghe’s younger brother, Hon. William Kerr (who sat for Berwick-upon-Tweed in this period), for whose fretful mother the time he spent gallivanting abroad seemed at any rate less dangerous than his favoured alternative of joining the army, only three Scottish MPs attempted a tour: John Bruce, son of the noted architect Sir William; the young ‘virtuoso’ John Clerk of Penicuik; and that somewhat hapless youth, John Forbes of Culloden, who, having ‘shirked’ his studies in Edinburgh, was in desperation sent into Holland for a year by his father, ‘to satisfy your own curiosity’.\n\nAn analysis, Parliament by Parliament, of the number of MPs who had travelled abroad in this way serves to emphasize that already by the later 17th century a continental journey was an established feature of a gentleman’s education. Nor does the practice seem to have diminished greatly as a result of the wars against Louis XIV, which only required a change of route, taking the traveller into Italy via the Low Countries and Germany rather than through France.\n\nMembers who had travelled abroad: Parliament by Parliament\n\n1690\n\n1695\n\n1698\n\n1701\n\n1701-2\n\n1702\n\n1705\n\n1707\n\n1708\n\n1710\n\n1713\n\n52\n\n54\n\n48\n\n46\n\n47\n\n46\n\n43\n\n48\n\n52\n\n47\n\n45\n\nOccupation\n\nThe vast majority of Members were landowners, whose estates alone would have afforded them at least an adequate income, usually in the form of rents. Some owned estates in more than one country: a few genuine Anglo-Irish families like the Boyles, Brodricks and Molesworths; some absentee English landlords who had inherited property in Ireland or acquired it through marriage, like (Sir) William Courtenay or Francis Seymour Conway; and a handful of owners of transatlantic plantations, most of them similarly absentees: from Virginia John Bromley I and William Spencer; and from Barbados Sir Peter Colleton, 2nd Bt., Sir Robert Davers, 2nd Bt., James Kendall, Sir Thomas Lear, 1st Bt., Robert Lowther, and William Wheeler (perhaps the only genuine planter of them all, who returned from the Caribbean barely long enough to sit in the two Parliaments of 1701). The number of mere landlords seems to have been relatively small, however; that is to say those who lived on their rental income alone, supplemented by the profits of expedient marriages, or resort to the mortgage market, and for whom the duties of public life, in local government and in Parliament, constituted almost their sole occupation. In other words, the Members did not represent an extensive leisured class of country squires. The evidence of the biographies, which the reader should not presume to be comprehensive in every respect, indicates substantial numbers who found employment in the new `professions’ —especially the law, the army and navy, and the state bureaucracy—or who involved themselves in some way in business enterprises—as merchants, financiers, industrialists or speculators.\n\nEven the gentleman whose interests remained centred on his estate might not be content with a passive role as a recipient of rents. The English countryside was full of determined agricultural ‘improvers’, from the canal-building FRS Cyril Arthington and his fellow Yorkshireman Sir Abstrupus Danby, whose enthusiasm for emparkment set him at odds with his foxhunting neighbours, to Sir John Stonhouse, 3rd Bt., at Radley in Berkshire, for whom more profitable agricultural techniques, involving the systematic enclosure of common land, were necessary to generate funds for the rebuilding of Radley Hall. Others sought to exploit the natural resources at their command, selling their timber to the navy, like Sir John Barker, 4th Bt., in Suffolk, or Sir Stephen Lennard, 2nd Bt., in Kent; mining for silver, like Sir Carbery Pryse, 4th Bt., in Cardiganshire, or more prosaically but profitably, for coal, tin, lead, alum, and saltpetre; extracting salt from the salt pans of Worcestershire and Cheshire; and even selling stone for building, like (Sir) Thomas Wheate (1st Bt.), whose quarries at Glympton in Oxfordshire provided the Marlboroughs and their masons with much of the building material for Blenheim Palace. The fashion for ‘improvement’ was also penetrating into the consciousness of Scottish lairds, although the best-documented examples of such enterprising landowners, the Jacobites Sir John Erskine, 3rd Bt., of Alva and (Sir) Alexander Murray (3rd Bt.) of Stanhope, both blended inventiveness with desperation in sufficient quantities to produce hare-brained and ultimately ruinous schemes: Erskine (who himself claimed no more than an ‘honest farmer’) prospecting for silver in Clackmannanshire; Murray devising an extensive system of canals and waterworks to drain and irrigate his Highland estate.\n\nThen there were the profits to be made from service to the crown. At least 648 MPs enjoyed the benefits of official remuneration at some point in their lives, almost a third of the entire Membership (32.7%), a figure that almost certainly understates the financial benefits derived from royal or governmental patronage, since it omits pensions, secret service handouts, and royal grants. Although perhaps the greater part of the recipients were career officers in the armed forces or belonged to the small but growing band of professional ‘civil servants’, a significant proportion were country gentlemen whose salaries, fees and perquisites augmented their personal income.\n\nIn considering those Members whose principal source of income did not derive from landownership, or whose principal occupation lay in one of the professions, or in ‘business’, it should be emphasized that these categories were not discrete. Lawyers, ‘civil servants’, and even army and naval officers might well have had business interests, for example, and would appear under both headings. No attempt has therefore been made to add together the numbers in the professions and in business, and to present this as a proportion of the total Membership of the House, or, a fortiori, to use these figures in order to try and establish the number of ‘mere’ landowners in the House (even assuming that it were possible to quantify precisely the number depending on rental or agricultural income).\n\nIn a period dominated by large-scale warfare, at home, in Ireland and Scotland, and abroad, on the continent and in the colonies, it is no surprise to find that service in the armed forces claimed more Members than any other profession. From the evidence of the biographies as many as 296 MPs, amounting to more than a seventh of the Membership (the precise figure is 14.9%), held a commission in the army or the Royal Navy, or both, at some point in their lives. The proportion of military and naval men is significantly higher among the Members for Scottish constituencies than among those for constituencies in England and Wales: 30.6% (that is to say 33 Members out of 108) as against 14.0% (263 out of 1874). This phenomenon would perhaps be most readily explicable by reference to economic differentials, in relation to the landed gentry north and south of the border, the social class from which commissioned officers were drawn. More Scots lairds than English gentlemen were driven to seek their fortune in the most physically dangerous of the professions. Not even the heartfelt expressions of maternal anxiety issuing from the dowager Countess of Roxburghe were enough to dissuade her son, Hon. William Kerr, from pursuing a military career. The temptation was not restricted to younger sons, either, but touched some first-born heirs, of whom the Master of Sinclair (John Sinclair) was probably the most striking example.\n\nWith one exception (the Parliament of 1713), the percentage of serving and former army and naval officers in each Parliament is higher than the proportion for the period as a whole, reflecting (one may presume) a tendency among army and naval officers to serve in the House of Commons for longer than the normal run; a tendency shared with other specialized occupational groups. In percentage terms, high points were reached in the Parliament of 1701-2, and again between 1705 and 1710, coinciding with Whig successes at the polls; low points in 1701, 1702 and 1710-14, when the Tories were ahead. The influence of an infusion of Scottish military men after 1707 is also detectable.\n\nParliament\n\nNumber of commissioned officer\n\nPercentage\n\n1690\n\n103\n\n16.6%\n\n1695\n\n90\n\n16.1%\n\n1698\n\n90\n\n16.5%\n\n1701\n\n84\n\n15.8%\n\n1701-2\n\n89\n\n17.3%\n\n1702\n\n87\n\n15.6%\n\n1705\n\n93\n\n16.8%\n\n1707\n\n104\n\n18.0%\n\n1708\n\n104\n\n17.3%\n\n1710\n\n98\n\n15.2%\n\n1713\n\n77\n\n13.3%\n\nThe higher proportion of military men elected to Parliament from about 1698 to 1710 may be put down to the general expansion of the officer corps to meet the military challenges posed by the wars against France. The decline from 1710 is, however, to be explained by an even more narrowly political factor, namely the increasingly Whig complexion of the military cohort in the Commons (that is, among the Members for English and Welsh constituencies, the more complex political allegiances that were to be found in Scotland not being reducible so easily to straightforward party designations). In such circumstances, any change in the overall balance of forces between the two parties in Parliament would produce a change in the number of army and naval officers in the House. Thus the Tory victories in the general elections of 1710 and 1713 naturally resulted in the return of fewer army and naval officers. Taking the period as a whole, Whigs predominated. Of the 263 English and Welsh Members who are recorded as having held a military commission, 131 can be identified consistently as Whigs, as compared to 95 Tories, the remaining 37 Members either having no clear party classification or transferring their allegiance from one side to the other in the course of their parliamentary service. Interesting chronological trends emerge, however, if we take separate figures for each Parliament. At the outset there was a strong Tory representation among the military Members in 1690, drawn from those loyalists who had served Charles II and James II, which shrank only gradually during the 1690s. In the Tory-dominated Parliament of 1702 there were still more Tory army and naval officers than Whigs. But the balance altered sharply thereafter, and not even the Tory electoral landslides of 1710 and 1713 could restore the status quo. With fewer Whig Members in 1713 than at any time in the period there were still more Whig than Tory soldiers and sailors to be found in the Commons.\n\nArmy and Navy officers, classified by party (England and Wales only):\n\nParliament\n\nTory\n\nWhig\n\nunclassified\n\n1690\n\n44\n\n41\n\n18\n\n1695\n\n28\n\n48\n\n14\n\n1698\n\n31\n\n43\n\n16\n\n1701\n\n36\n\n33\n\n15\n\n1701-2\n\n35\n\n38\n\n16\n\n1702\n\n43\n\n31\n\n13\n\n1705/7\n\n28\n\n51\n\n14\n\n1708\n\n24\n\n51\n\n9\n\n1710\n\n37\n\n35\n\n11\n\n1713\n\n26\n\n28\n\n7\n\nIf we confine our attention to those Members who held their commissions in the army or Royal Navy during the years 1690-1715 the number drops sharply: 203 in all, a tenth (10.2%) of the total Membership, 173 of whom sat for English and Welsh constituencies (9.2% of all English and Welsh Members) and 30 for Scottish constituencies (24.8% of the Scottish representation). Only one Scot was included in the Navy list, Lord Archibald Hamilton, and that by virtue of his lieutenant-colonelcy of marines. Similarly, among English and Welsh Members the vast majority were army officers: only 29 held naval commissions, seven of whom were also in the army list (in almost every case because of a commission in a marine regiment). As before, the party-political complexion was strongly Whig: 77 of the English and Welsh army officers could consistently be described as Whigs throughout their parliamentary service in this period, as compared with 43 Tories (24 remaining unclassified or changing their party allegiance at some point), while the naval officers divided 17 to 12 in the Whigs’ favour.\n\nAs many as 48 of the army officers held higher than regimental rank, among whom were such notable figures as Marlborough’s right-hand-man William Cadogan, John, Lord Cutts, and Thomas Erle, successively commanders-in-chief of the army in Ireland, the young James Stanhope, Hon. Thomas Tollemache, the Whig hero fatally wounded at Brest in 1693, and John Richmond Webb, the Tory hero immortalized by Thackeray, whom Marlborough and Cadogan allegedly attempted to cheat of his moment of glory following the battle of Wynendael. The naval contingent could boast no less than 18 flag officers, headed by Edward Russell (later Lord Orford), the victor of La Hogue, and including some of the most renowned names in 18th-century naval history: Sir George Byng, Sir John Leake, Sir George Rooke, and Sir Clowdisley Shovell. Since service in the armed forces, either on land or at sea, was a recognized path to social advancement, it was natural that some Members would be career officers from humble origins. This phenomenon was less common in the army, where commissions were acquired by means of finance or patronage, than in the navy, where it was possible to rise through the ranks, and for gentlemen-officers to be commanded by old ‘tarpaulins’. Shovell, for example, had originally entered the Restoration navy as a captain’s servant; Leake was the son of a master gunner (admittedly the master gunner of England); while the parentage and education of (Sir) William Gifford have defied investigation entirely. Almost without exception, commissioned officers in the army were recruited from the landowning classes: one held a Scottish peerage himself (Lord Fairfax), five enjoyed Irish titles (Lords Barrymore, Cutts, Fitzhardinge, Shannon, and Windsor), and at least 33 more were the sons of peers, including scions of such formidable noble families as the Berties, Boyles, Campbells, Cavendishes, Hamiltons, Mordaunts, Seymours, and Sidneys. A few generals and field officers had risen from comparative obscurity, most obviously the Irish trio of William Cadogan, Thomas Meredyth and Francis Palmes, but it was still landed obscurity.\n\nA feature of the military presence in Parliament was the influence exerted over individuals and groups of Members by prominent generals or admirals, who could build up political ‘connexions’ through the operation of service patronage. The most obvious belonged to the Duke of Marlborough (John Churchill†), who numbered among his many followers his nephews, Charles and Francis Godfrey, the three Trelawnys, Lord Tunbridge (William Nassau de Zuylestein), Henry Withers, and the ubiquitous Irish trio of Cadogan, Meredyth and Palmes. But there were other gravitational forces within the army, even in Marlborough’s heyday. The Duke of Argyll certainly rivalled Marlborough in ambition and self-regard, if not in ability, and acted as a magnet to those who felt themselves excluded from the privileged clique surrounding the Churchills. Three of Argyll’s Campbell kinsmen were army officers and MPs, while others looked to the Duke for protection, his fellow countrymen Sir Alexander Cumming, 1st Bt., Alexander Grant of Grant, John Middleton II, and Hon. Charles Rosse, and even the occasional non-Scot like the young Charles Boyle II, later 4th Earl of Orrery. A similarly localized influence was enjoyed, within Ireland, by the 2nd Duke of Ormond, especially during his two stints as viceroy at Dublin Castle, from 1703 to 1707 and from 1710 to 1713, when the Irish military establishment came under his direct control. Obviously Marlborough’s Irishmen were immune to this influence, but other officers on the Irish establishment fell under Ormond’s spell, and both the Ulsterman Robert Echlin and the Englishman Thomas Pearce could be counted among Ormond’s closest personal followers. In the navy the equivalent of Marlborough was Edward Russell, whose prolonged ascendancy over the Admiralty administration in the 1690s enabled him to build up a formidable parliamentary ‘connexion’, including a veritable flotilla of flag officers: Matthew Aylmer, Sir George Byng, Charles Corn(e)wall, Sir John Jennings, Sir John Leake, Sir John Norris, and Sir Charles Wager.\n\nTraditionally the best represented profession had been the law, and with rare exceptions, such as William Collier, the quondam ‘pettifogging attorney’ who became manager of the Drury Lane theatre before being elected to Parliament in 1713, the lawyers who made their appearance in the Commons were of the more elevated kind: a handful of civilians (five in all), and a substantial squadron of barristers. Not all barristers continued to practise, of course; some had been promoted to the bench, while others had long since abandoned the law for politics and government office. A number had never practised at all, for, as the modern historian of the early 18th-century bar, David Lemmings, has argued, ‘the traditional market for barristers’ services’ was shrinking in this period, and the number of practitioners was steadily falling. Lemmings’ detailed investigations into the careers of barrister-MPs in this period concluded that at least half did not practise; or, to put it more precisely, left no record of having practised. The biographical evidence assembled in this History does not extend to a systematic account of the number of Members who practised at the bar. Our calculations are therefore confined to those who were qualified to practise, through being called at one of the inns of court, admitted to the King’s Inns in Dublin, or entering the Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh. A quintet of civilians and 11 attorneys have also been added in.\n\nOverall, some 305 Members belonged by this definition to the legal profession (15.4%), of whom 18 were Scots (16.7% of the Scottish Membership, as compared with a figure of 14.6% for the English and Welsh Members). If we take the figures Parliament by Parliament, we find in most cases a slightly higher percentage, results which are again explicable by the fact that, taken as a group, lawyers (defined in these terms) enjoyed on average longer parliamentary careers than did the Members as a whole. Relatively little variation is visible in the percentages from one Parliament to another, though a small overall increase occurred across the period, with peaks in the Parliaments of 1701, 1708, 1710 and 1713.\n\nParliament\n\nNumber of lawyers\n\nPercentage\n\n1690\n\n90\n\n14.5%\n\n1695\n\n79\n\n14.1%\n\n1698\n\n80\n\n14.7%\n\n1701\n\n83\n\n15.6%\n\n1701-2\n\n70\n\n13.6%\n\n1702\n\n90\n\n16.2%\n\n1705\n\n82\n\n14.8%\n\n1707\n\n87\n\n15.1%\n\n1708\n\n95\n\n15.8%\n\n1710\n\n106\n\n16.5%\n\n1713\n\n98\n\n16.9%\n\nAn analysis of the party allegiances of those lawyers who sat for English or Welsh constituencies bears out Dr Lemmings’ conclusion that the majority of practising barristers tended to be Tory rather than Whig. Just over half, some 147 in total, can be identified as Tories, as against 104 who appear consistently as Whigs; while the remaining 36 are either impossible to classify in party terms, or can be seen to have shifted from one category to another during the period. However, plotting the numbers in each Parliament demonstrates that the Tory majority actually increased between 1690 and 1715, and increased quite sharply in the second half of the period, if we bear in mind the broad party-political composition of the House after each election. The key date appears to be 1701, for the general election in December of that year had produced a House of Commons in which the balance of the parties was more or less even, but there was a clear majority of Tories over Whigs among the lawyers. Thereafter, the Tories maintained this advantage, even in the Parliament of 1708, when overall the Whigs enjoyed a clear margin of victory at the polls.\n\nParliament\n\nTory\n\nWhig\n\nunclassified (or changed allegiance)\n\n1690\n\n44\n\n35\n\n11\n\n1695\n\n32\n\n36\n\n11\n\n1698\n\n38\n\n29\n\n13\n\n1701\n\n47\n\n28\n\n8\n\n1701-2\n\n38\n\n27\n\n5\n\n1702\n\n62\n\n23\n\n5\n\n1705/7\n\n47\n\n33\n\n2\n\n1708\n\n42\n\n41\n\n6\n\n1710\n\n73\n\n19\n\n6\n\n1713\n\n69\n\n16\n\n4\n\nFor lawyers, Membership of the House of Commons naturally offered manifold opportunities for professional advancement, through publicly exercising their intellectual and forensic powers in debate or committee, demonstrating the soundness of their political principles and their loyalty to party at crucial divisions, or simply cultivating the powerful at close quarters. Of the barristers and advocates sitting in this period, as many as 94 held some kind of legal office. At the peak of the profession were five lord chancellors (William Cowper, Simon Harcourt I, Peter King, Sir Thomas Parker, Sir John Somers), three masters of the rolls (Sir Joseph Jekyll, Henry Powle, and Sir John Trevor), and one lord advocate in Scotland (Sir David Dalrymple, 1st Bt.). In addition a dozen Members were eventually raised to the bench in England (John Blencowe, John Comyns, Alexander Denton II, Robert Dormer, Robert Eyre, Francis Page, Sir Thomas Powys, John Pratt, Robert Price, Sir Robert Raymond, Sir George Treby, Sir Thomas Trevor); thirteen served as judges on the various Welsh circuits (Spencer Cowper, Charles Coxe, Stephen Hervey, William Jesse, Francis Lloyd, John Meyrick, John Pocklington, Sir John Trenchard, Richard Vaughan I, John Ward III, Charles Whitaker, Edward Winnington, Sir William Wogan); four were judges in Ireland (Gilbert Dolben, Richard Levinge, Sir Richard Reynell, 1st Bt., and John Pocklington again); two were lords of session in Edinburgh (John Murray, Lord Bowhill, and Dougal Stewart, Lord Blairhall); while Roger Mompesson was chief justice of several North American colonies. Halted a little lower down the promotional ladder were three attorneys-general (Nicholas Lechmere, James Montagu I, and Sir Robert Sawyer); six solicitors-general (Hon. Heneage Finch I, John Hawles, Sir John Maynard, William Thompson III, Sir William Williams, 1st Bt., Sir Francis Winnington); and thirteen King’s or Queen’s serjeants (John Birch II, Nathaniel Bond, Lawrence Carter II, Joseph Girdler, Nicholas Hooper, Sir George Hutchins, Henry Lloyd, Hon William Montagu, Richard Richardson, James Sheppard, John Thurbarne, Sir John Tremayne, Thomas Richmond Webb). The remainder occupied either minor places in the courts of Chancery, Common Pleas, or King’s Bench; in the provinces (on the Welsh circuits, in the Duchy of Lancaster, or with the chief justices in eyre); or, in the case of civilians like Sir William Trumbull, in church or prerogative courts (Trumbull held inter alia the offices of chancellor of the diocese of Rochester and judge of the prerogative court of Canterbury).\n\nSome lawyer-MPs were privately employed by great landowners or landowning families. None, so far as we know, in so menial a capacity as estate steward, in the way that Robert Britiffe, MP for Norwich in 1715, was employed by the Walpoles (though in his younger days James Craggs I was said to have served in the household of the 7th Duke of Norfolk as ‘steward’ before moving on to the more exalted place of ‘private secretary’ to the then Earl of Marlborough), but many as advisers or general ‘men-of-business’. Thus Thomas Christie served the Earls of Ailesbury; Robert Monckton the Duke of Newcastle; Robert Price the Dukes of Beaufort; Thomas Owen the redoubtable Lady Rachel Russell; and Archibald Hutcheson and Thomas Medlycott the hapless Duke of Ormond. Scottish magnates were particularly fond of retaining the services of a ‘factor’, who combined the duties of legal adviser, financial administrator and political manager. The most outstanding example among the Scottish Members of Parliament in this period was probably Mungo Graham, the devoted servant of his distant cousin the Duke of Montrose, to the extent that he had no personal establishment separate from the family, but resided either in Montrose’s London house or in Buchanan castle, the Duke’s Scottish seat. There were also William Cochrane of Kilmaronock, who in general acted for the Dukes of Hamilton; the lord of session Dougal Stewart, whose principal connexion was with Lord Bute; and, in a rather more specialized role, the young John Clerk of Penicuik, the Duke of Queensberry’s private secretary at the time of the Union negotiations.\n\nOther professions were barely represented in the House of Commons in this period, a reflection perhaps of the social standing of the practitioners, the level of remuneration, or (in comparison with legal advocacy, for example), the compatibility of the profession itself with the business of a Member of Parliament. There were only five medical doctors, John Radcliffe, the English royal physician, William Cotesworth, Sir William Langham, and two Scotsmen (albeit with London practices), John Hutton and Charles Oliphant; and two apothecaries, the courtier James Chase, who succeeded his father as apothecary to the sovereign and master of the Apothecaries’ Company, and the modest provincial Samuel Battelley, whose practice was confined to the town of Bury St. Edmunds. Although several Members tried their hands at architecture in an amateur way, the House included only a single professional, admittedly in the person of Sir Christopher Wren. The many offices which Wren held, often concurrently, included the Savilian chair in astronomy at Oxford, and he was joined in the Commons by 23 other college fellows, three of whom could be described as university teachers by vocation: Isaac Newton and Thomas Paske at Cambridge, and Henry Watkins at Oxford. Hon. Edward Finch was unique in that he was the only Member in this period (and indeed during the entire 17th century) who took holy orders after giving up his parliamentary seat, becoming rector of Wigan and later a canon of Canterbury. In a House which included numerous published authors, their works ranging from the serious and scholarly (the scientist Newton, the philosopher Lord Shaftesbury (Anthony Ashley), the virtuoso John Clerk, the poet Matthew Prior, the historians Thomas Tonkin and Browne Willis, the political thinkers Robert Molesworth, Walter Moyle, and William Seton of Pitmedden), to the ephemeral and even frivolous (the efforts of such poetasters as Anthony Hammond and William Walsh, and the squibs and satires of the ‘rattle-pate’ George Duckett), only a handful ever attempted to make a living by writing: Charles Davenant through composing political pamphlets, Joseph Addison, Richard Steele, and Arthur Maynwaring through something more akin to journalism, in their contributions to periodical publications like the Spectator, Tatler, and Medley. Even then not one of this quartet was able to survive by the pen alone. Davenant, Addison and Steele all benefited from the profits of governmental office, while Maynwaring was employed directly by his patroness, the Duchess of Marlborough, as her private secretary. More unusually, John Anstis was able to find his livelihood through heraldry and genealogy, becoming in due course (in 1718) Garter king of arms, while two Members, Thomas Boucher and the Dutchman John Germain, seem to have made their fortunes as professional gamesters; indeed, when Boucher came to be buried it was reported that ‘two old women were overheard to be very witty, saying, “Why had he no [e]scutcheons? For he might have good arms, a pack of cards, a dice box and a quarter a pair of scissors”.\n\nEmployment in government service is the most difficult of the ‘professions’ to quantify in the context of parliamentary representation, given that there was no recognized career path in the early 18th-century bureaucracy, and that many individuals who were clearly not professional administrators none the less held office under the Crown for long periods, some with sinecures but others having clear executive duties, such as Sir William Forester at the Board of Green Cloth, Thomas Frankland I at the Post Office, and Samuel Travers as surveyor-general. It is still possible, however, to identify a small number of MPs who may anachronistically be called ‘civil servants’; men whose natural habitat was the offices, closets, and back stairs of Whitehall, whose calling was administration, and whose income was derived principally from the fruits of office. An older generation, headed by Sir George Downing† and Samuel Pepys†, had formed the backbone of departmental government under the Restoration monarchy, and two of Charles II’s bureaucrats survived into the House of Commons in this period: the administrative jack-of-all-trades Sir Joseph Williamson, formerly secretary of state, and now enjoying the reputation of an elder statesman; and Sir Stephen Fox, who had risen to wealth and prominence by way of the royal court and the Treasury. In this period the archetypal bureaucrat was William Lowndes, who spent nearly half a century in the Treasury, as clerk, chief clerk, and eventually secretary, and who represented Seaford between 1695 and 1715. Close by, in the paymaster-general’s office, nestled another MP, Fox’s protégé Edward Pauncefort; while the secretaries of state were served by no less than seven clerks or under-secretaries who sat in Parliament: Joseph Addison, William Blathwayt and his nephew John Povey, John Ellis, Thomas Hopkins, Erasmus Lewis, John Pulteney and Robert Yard. All went on to higher things. The most successful was Blathwayt, who eventually became secretary at war, but even Povey, whom one contemporary ridiculed as ‘a little inconsiderable supernumerary’, became secretary of the Privy Council. Elsewhere we can find another Member, William Bridges, among the permanent staff of the Ordnance, while Adam de Cardonnel, the son of French Protestant refugees, began his career under Blathwayt in the War Office, before attaching himself to the Duke of Marlborough, through whom he obtained not only a parliamentary seat, and the succession to his former patron, but also in due course the kind of factionally motivated dismissal from which the true ‘civil servant’ was protected. Outside the secretary of state’s office, however, the departments best represented in the Commons were those concerned with the administration of the navy. Josiah Burchett, originally one of Pepys’s clerks, was a permanent fixture in the Admiralty, where he held the place of secretary from 1694 to 1742. Dennis Lyddell was another who gave over 40 years’ service, this time in the Navy office, ending as comptroller of treasurer’s accounts, while not far behind in terms of longevity were Lyddell’s colleagues Charles Sergison and Kenrick Edisbury, the former employed for nearly 30 years as clerk of the acts, and the latter, who had started his career in Charles II’s reign as clerk of the cheque at Deptford, rising through various appointments in the clerk’s office to become commissioner of victualling in 1704, and finishing his days in 1734 after a long stint as one of the commissioners for sick and wounded.\n\nIt remains to consider those Members who derived at least part of their income from what may be loosely described as business enterprises. These ranged enormously in both scale and type. At one end of the spectrum were the venture capitalists of the City of London, financing voyages around the world or floating massive loans to maintain public credit, and the handful of great industrialists like the iron-master Sir Ambrose Crowley, whose smelting works were said to be the most extensive in Europe. At the other were such small provincial manufacturers as Thomas Richmond, the Maldon tanner; investors in get-rich-quick schemes involving, for example, the salvaging of shipwrecks (or more bizarrely in the case of Goodwin Wharton and his friends, the hunt for buried treasure using fairy guides); local monopolists like the Welsh attorney Owen Hughes, with his patent for the management of the ferries across the Menai Straits; and the would-be theatrical impresarios Henry Brett and William Collier.\n\nTaking the period as a whole, and using this broad, umbrella definition, the Members involved in ‘business’ formed a significant proportion of the House: 411, amounting to just over a fifth of the total (the exact figure is 20.7%). Some 26 were Scots, the percentage for Scottish Members being almost exactly the same as for the Members for English and Welsh constituencies. As with the larger ‘professional’ groups, the representation of ‘businessmen’ in each Parliament was generally slightly higher than this overall figure, and for the same reason. Moreover, there was a remarkable consistency across the period, with a maximum variation of only 3.6% and no clear chronological pattern to be observed; in spite of the consensus in contemporary political debate that the ‘landed interest’ was in decline as a result of the harmful effects of continental warfare, while the ‘moneyed interest’ was flourishing.\n\nParliament\n\nNumber in business\n\nPercentage\n\n1690\n\n134\n\n21.5%\n\n1695\n\n128\n\n22.9%\n\n1698\n\n121\n\n22.2%\n\n1701\n\n117\n\n22.0%\n\n1701-2\n\n116\n\n22.5%\n\n1702\n\n122\n\n21.9%\n\n1705\n\n123\n\n22.2%\n\n1707\n\n126\n\n21.8%\n\n1708\n\n126\n\n21.0%\n\n1710\n\n133\n\n20.7%\n\n1713\n\n112\n\n19.3%\n\nThese calculations cannot, however, tell the whole story, given the catch-all nature of ‘business’ as an occupational category. In attempting to make sense of such a bewildering variety of different kinds of commercial enterprise, it may be more useful to subdivide ‘business’ interests—into banking and finance, long-range (or overseas) trade, internal (or domestic) trade, manufacture, and mining—always remembering that an individual Member could be involved simultaneously in more than one kind of activity. Coal mining and iron manufacture, for example, were combined to considerable effect by Sir Humphrey Mackworth in the development of his estate at Neath into what was for a time the largest industrial complex in south Wales. And in a slightly different way, trade and high finance obviously complemented each other. Although best known as the first governor of the Bank of England, and thus a pillar of the ‘moneyed interest’ in the City, Sir Gilbert Heathcote was in fact first and foremost an Iberian merchant, investing in the public stocks the fortune he and his partner Arthur Shallett* had originally made from the importation of Spanish and Portuguese wines.\n\nAs understood by contemporaries, the (largely pejorative) term ‘moneyed interest’ did not extend to all businessmen, nor indeed to all those involved in trade. At its core were the bankers, financiers, stock-jobbers and speculators who handled money rather than goods. Only 43 Members can be identified as belonging to this group (a mere 2.2% of the total composition of the House), four of whom were Scots (Daniel Campbell of Shawfield, Alexander Duff, Sir William Gordon, 1st Bt., and John Montgomerie I). Seven acted as private bankers, either because they were goldsmiths exercising a traditional function of their craft (Sir Francis Child, Sir Thomas Cooke, Charles Duncombe, Stephen Evance, Sir Thomas Fowle, Sir Richard Hoare, John Mead) or because, as men with access to large quantities of ready cash, they were in a position to be able to oblige their friends. Thus both Sir Robert Clayton and Sir Stephen Fox baled out impoverished English and Anglo-Irish aristocrats of their acquaintance, though in each case to the lender’s own ultimate benefit, while Daniel Campbell of Shawfield performed the same service for the Scots nobility.\n\nClearly a sum total of 43 Members would not constitute the entire parliamentary representation of the ‘moneyed interest’, for it would not comprehend all the Members who bought Bank of England or East India stock or invested in other public companies. More to the point, perhaps, in the present context, there was a close connexion between high finance and trade, especially the more capital-intensive overseas trade. It was impossible to make a clear distinction between the financiers and the overseas merchants who together made up the commercial élite of the City of London; partly because the joint-stock companies in which ‘moneyed’ men invested their fortunes were almost all trading companies, and partly because the merchant princes of the City, the Childs, Dashwoods, Goulds, Hernes and Shepheards, were precisely those who were most likely to have money to invest. There was indeed a considerable degree of overlap between the two groups. Of the 43 ‘financiers’ in the House more than half, 22 in all, were also recorded as having some involvement in long-distance trade. It would seem reasonable, therefore, to combine overseas merchants with financiers in order to produce a figure for the parliamentary representation of the ‘moneyed interest’ (though admittedly this would in all probability still be something of an under-estimate). The number of Members in this period who can be identified as overseas merchants amounts to 212 (10.7% of the Membership), 13 of whom were Scots (10.2% of the Scottish Members). Taken together with the remaining 21 ‘financiers’ and bankers, this would give an aggregate of 232 (that is to say 11.7% of the Membership as a whole), not only a more substantial proportion of the House, but a figure that would be commensurate with contemporary apprehensions of the size of the ‘moneyed interest’. The same exercise undertaken for each Parliament also reveals, predictably, that in percentage terms the highest influx of ‘moneyed men’ into the Commons occurred after the first general election of 1701, which had been contested vigorously by the rival East India Companies. More surprising, perhaps, is that this peak was followed by a gentle decline which was only reversed (and then temporarily) in 1710.\n\nParliament\n\nSize of ‘moneyed interest’\n\nPercentage\n\n1690\n\n77\n\n12.2%\n\n1695\n\n70\n\n12.5%\n\n1698\n\n67\n\n12.3%\n\n1701\n\n71\n\n13.4%\n\n1701-2\n\n61\n\n12.0%\n\n1702\n\n62\n\n11.8%\n\n1705\n\n63\n\n11.4%\n\n1707\n\n62\n\n11.1%\n\n1708\n\n65\n\n10.7%\n\n1710\n\n73\n\n11.3%\n\n1713\n\n64\n\n11.1%\n\nEvidently overseas merchants did not always specialize in goods or markets. Less than half the Members involved in overseas trade confined their operations to a particular geographical area. Of those who did, the largest number (22 in all) traded with Spain and Portugal, for the most part importing wine. Besides Clayton and Shallett these included Sir William Hodges and Samuel Kekewich, both of whom had themselves lived in Spain for a time; Charles II’s yeoman purveyor of wines to the royal household, Sir Basil Firebrace; Samuel Shepheard I and his sons, a formidable commercial dynasty for whom, like Heathcote, the Iberian trade served as a springboard; the York alderman Edward Thompson; and the exiled Scot William Livingston. Almost as well represented (with 21 Members) was the eastern Mediterranean market, concentrated on the Levant, which was where the Dashwoods and Hernes had originally made their money. A further 21 Members were involved in transatlantic commerce, though the number may be slightly inflated by the inclusion of two families of planters (John Bromley I and his son and namesake in Virginia, Sir Peter Colleton, 2nd Bt., in the West Indies). Here the provinces dominated: the Bristolians Edward Colston II, Sir William Daines, Sir Richard Hart, Sir John Knight, and Robert Yate; John Rogers from Plymouth and John Burridge I from Lyme Regis; the Liverpudlians William Clayton, John Cleiveland, Thomas Johnson and Richard Norris; and eventually the Glasgow burgesses Daniel Campbell and Thomas Smith II. Even Robert Heysham, possibly the largest of the London merchants involved, had strong Lancastrian connexions. Smaller groups traded for slaves along the west coast of Africa, among whom we find such important mercantile figures as Sir Richard Hoare, the Huguenot Sir Bartholomew Gracedieu, and the three Jeffreys (Edward, Jeffrey and John); for Scandinavian timber and Russian tobacco in the Baltic, which particularly attracted the Scots (Alexander Duff, John Gordon, John Haldane, Sir Samuel McClellan, and Sir John Swinton) and merchants from the north-east of England (William Maister in Hull, Michael Mitford in Newcastle); and for silks and spices in the east, most notably the old East India Company hands Gabriel Roberts and Thomas Pitt I. What these sets of figures appear to show is that, as far as MPs were concerned, the older-established lines of trade, to the Iberian Peninsula and across the Mediterranean to the Levant, remained more popular. However, this may well be a statistical illusion created by the nature of the evidence in the biographies. A somewhat different picture emerges if we bring into consideration membership of the various chartered trading companies. Here by far the greatest number of MPs can be found in one of the East India Companies, either the original, ‘Old’ Company, the New Company established in 1697, or the united company created after the merger of the two rivals in 1709: 27 in the Old Company, 10 in the New, and seven more in the united Company, making 44 in all. Then came the Royal African Company with 25 members; the Levant Company with 18; the new South Sea Company, erected to profit from Britain’s acquisition of the asiento at the Treaty of Utrecht, with 14; the Russia Company with 6; and the Eastland and Hudson’s Bay Companies, each with three. The short-lived Company of Scotland also attracted three Members, two of whom (Paul Docminique and John Ward IV) were English.\n\nIn purely economic terms, the distinction between inland trade and ‘manufacture’ is also hard to draw. Particular difficulties arise over two of the more important kinds of domestic commercial operation, the beer and cloth trades, both of which involved more than simply manufacturing production. For the purposes of this survey, brewers and clothiers have been placed in the category of ‘inland trade’, alongside local merchants such as John Dibble (whose principal trade was in timber for the navy) and the property developers Nicholas Barbon, John Gilbert and Sir William Pulteney. Since there were some 14 brewers in the House (all Londoners except for Benjamin England in Great Yarmouth, Robert Bene and Thomas Palgrave in Norwich, and Thomas Ridge in Portsmouth ), and 25 clothiers of different descriptions (distinguished by a strong contingent from the major woollen-manufacturing districts of East Anglia, the west country, and Yorkshire) plus the army contractors James Craggs I, Richard Harnage and John London, their inclusion makes a perceptible difference to the totals involved.\n\nBy this definition, inland trade occupied 94 Members (4.7% of the House), of whom 65 confined their business activities to the domestic market, the remainder also involving themselves in overseas trade or finance. Once again, the percentage for each Parliament was higher than the overall figure, and, just as with the ‘moneyed interest’, a peak was reached in the first Parliament of 1701, followed by a modest but persistent decline.\n\nParliament\n\nNumber\n\nPercentage\n\n1690\n\n77\n\n12.4%\n\n1695\n\n70\n\n12.5%\n\n1698\n\n69\n\n12.7%\n\n1701\n\n71\n\n13.4%\n\n1701-2\n\n61\n\n11.8%\n\n1702\n\n67\n\n12.1%\n\n1705\n\n62\n\n11.2%\n\n1707\n\n62\n\n10.7%\n\n1708\n\n65\n\n10.8%\n\n171"
