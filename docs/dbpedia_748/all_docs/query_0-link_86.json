        "text": "Arrayed broadly like the quarter hours on a clock face, for several centuries four enduring ancestral homes have encircled the unpretentious town of Kettering in Northamptonshire. Immediately to the south lies Burton Latimer Hall, a Grade I medieval/Jacobean house Georgianised after its mid-18th century acquisition by the Harpur family, and which remains their private home today (↓).\n\nRound at ‘nine o’clock’ stands a house of not entirely dissimilar architectural evolution, Thorpe Malsor Hall, the seat of the Maunsell family since 1622 (latterly in the female line) and which Handed on chronicled back in 2012. Meanwhile, having arrived on the scene a century earlier, the north of Kettering continues to be dominated by…\n\n… the estate of the Montagus, some 11,000 acres centered upon comparatively palatial pile Boughton House, the English seat of the dukes of Buccleuch.\n\nFinally, due east are to be found the twin villages of Cranford St. Andrew and Cranford St. John. Lying either side of a small tributary of the river Nene, its propensity to flood supposedly occasioned the separate communities, each with its own church, public house and other traditional services. As recently as the 1980s a retired blacksmith remarked that “it wasn’t exactly a rivalry, but the brook was the dividing line and most people tended to stick to their own side”.1\n\nBut since the turn of the 18th century a common factor for both places has been the identity of the principal local landowners, the Robinson baronets of Cranford Hall, the ‘small but stately’ parkland of which substantially occupies the ground between the medieval churches of St. Andrew (far left) and St. John (right).2\n\nThough built by the Robinsons, and still their family home, for much of the last century Cranford Hall was let to others, in its entirety until the Second World War and partially ever since. Sir John Robinson, 11th Baronet, and Lady Robinson reside there today along side the occupants of several self-contained upper floor rental apartments, a pragmatic post-war model established by his grandfather, whom he succeeded in 1975.\n\nIt was their 17th century antecedent John Robinson who both gained the title and established the family’s association with Northamptonshire through his acquisition not of Cranford but the manor of Grafton Underwood, immediately to the north, in 1652. This represented the first landed investment by one of the most influential figures operating in the City of London in the decades immediately following the violent deposition of King Charles I.\n\nRobinson’s paternal grandmother Lucy Webbe was twice married, both husbands being prosperous Reading clothiers; her brother also thrived in business, serving a term as Lord Mayor of London. But, curiously, the sons of Webbe’s marriages would notably eschew commerce for a higher calling. While the clerical career of the Ven. William Robinson culminated in his becoming Archdeacon of Nottingham, this would be emphatically trumped by his younger half-brother, William Laud, who was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury in the time of Charles I.\n\nAlas, Laud’s commitment to the monarch’s ecclesiastical edicts would lead to his trial for treason, and eventual execution in January 1645 after several years of incarceration in the Tower of London – a place which, ironically, his relation John Robinson would find himself in charge of just fifteen years later.\n\nHaving followed the path not of his father’s generation but the one before, John Robinson graduated from a cloth trade apprenticeship, quickly proving his business acumen. By the mid-1650s he was Master of the Clothworkers Company and investing his wealth in land, at Nuneham Courtenay in Oxfordshire in addition to the aforementioned manor of Grafton Underwood.\n\n1660 was something of an annus mirabilis for Robinson. Elected MP for the City of London in March, as a very active proponent of the Restoration Robinson was promptly knighted by Charles II in May…\n\n… his title promoted to a hereditary baronetcy just a month later. And August would see the birth of his second son (and eventual heir), John, who was baptized in the Tower of London, his godfather King Charles presenting ‘a needlework cot cover still at Cranford, where it hangs in the Entrance Hall’.3\n\nSix years on, in September, 1666 it was young John who would accompany Samuel Pepys to the best vantage point within the Tower – of which his father had been appointed Lieutenant in 1663 – in order to take in the extent of the Great Fire of London.4 (Pepys, while conceding Sir John’s effectiveness in promoting the interests of the City, was not a fan, ‘a bragging buffhead‘ being one of his more polite epithets. The diarist was, however, rather more taken with Lady Robinson: ‘a very high-carriaged but comely, big woman; I was mightily pleased with her.’)\n\nUnder Sir John’s direction, fire damage to the Tower was largely contained. And not long before this calamity he had thwarted an attempt on his own life by anti-Royalist renegades who were soon hanged at Tyburn.\n\nEver grateful for his loyalty (and favourable financial dealings), the Crown later enabled Robinson to further expand his interests in Northamptonshire where he was appointed Ranger of Rockingham Forest, gaining a rambling hunting lodge called Farming Woods (later evolved as Fermyn Woods Hall, left) four miles north-west of Grafton Underwood.\n\nSir John died in February, 1680 and was buried at Nuneham Courtenay along side his eldest son, William, who had died unmarried twelve months before. All now devolved to Robinson’s second son, John (‘of Farming Woods’) whose wife Mary Dudley had produced two daughters at the time of his own death in 1693.\n\nThe marriages of Mary and Anne (the former to the Earl of Wemyss, the latter to Lord Gowran) would result in the separate descent/sale of the Farming Woods and Oxfordshire properties. But the baronetcy remained in Northamptonshire, being now inherited by James, the third son of the 1st baronet, ‘who in 1699 and 1715 bought the two manors in Cranford’ and where he would soon set about erecting a handsome new house just a stone’s throw from Cranford St. Andrew’s church.3\n\nSupplanting the typical ‘old-fashioned’ H-plan houses of the previous century, Sir James Robinson’s Cranford Hall would exemplify the new style of abode now being favoured by Northamptonshire’s gentry: a crisp, sober, practically proportioned Early Georgian box.5\n\n‘Rather plain,’ the centred entrances relieve the principal seven-bay, three-storey limestone ashlar facades of Cranford Hall. To the north, the main entrance (left) features ‘a Roman Doric portico with complete entablature’; on the opposite side (below) details are the same but engaged.6\n\nHere, parkland was established contiguous with the grounds of its very near neighbour: ‘Hall and Church are all undivided from each other by hedge or fence, [with] no very distinct boundary between the Squire’s garden and the churchyard.’2 Sir James Robinson died in 1731, the rest of the 18th century being seen out in turn by his son and grandson…\n\n… both of whose marriages would expand the family’s property portfolio, in the county and beyond.\n\nIn 1726, John Robinson, later 4th baronet, had married heiress Mary Morgan through which came the manor of Kingsthorpe, now subsumed into suburban Northampton but which remained in family ownership well into the 20th century. Mary having died in 1734, it would be Sir John’s second wife Elizabeth whose likeness was captured by Allan Ramsey in twin half-length portraits of 1744.7\n\nSucceeding in 1765, Sir George Robinson, 5th Bt., not only added a two-storey wing to Cranford Hall but also gained another seat, Stretton Hall at Great Glen east of Leicester via his heiress wife Dorothea Chester. (Built, like Cranford, in the early decades of the 18th century, Stretton caught the coattails of the Queen Anne style; it would be sold out of the family in the 1830s.)\n\nIn 1786 Sir George and Lady Robinson sat for the most fashionable portrait painter of the day, George Romney, while the previous decade had seen the baronet serve as an MP for Northampton for six years, characterised as ‘an honest, independent country gentleman of Whig principles and inclined to Opposition’.\n\nIn the next century his namesake son and heir would also get to Westminster, his electoral campaigns being reportedly sometimes ‘violent‘. Usefully, the 6th baronet was very handy with his fists.\n\n*\n\n‘One of the best amateur boxers in England was Capt. Robinson, of the 10th Hussars and of Cranford Hall. It was told of him, that the surest method for anyone to adopt, who wished to enter his service, was to go down to Kettering, thrash two or three yokels cleverly, and wait the result. The fame of the stranger would be sure to reach the Hall .. and no long time would elapse before the young heir to the baronetcy would find some opportunity to encounter and pick a quarrel with him. If the stranger came off conqueror, young Robinson was only too happy to engage him in his service.‘8\n\nAh, the good old days.\n\nThis novel staff recruitment process led to Robinson’s engaging one Will Wood not just as coachman but also as his sporting protege, promoting Wood’s pugilistic career through a series of bare-knuckle bouts attended by word-of-mouth hoards from across the social spectrum. Soon, Robinson fancied his man’s chances against a fighter ‘very near the top of the tree’, Bill ‘The Tinman’ Hooper.\n\nA crowd numbering several thousand assembled on 22 June, 1795 for the showdown on Hounslow Heath west of London, terms having been agreed ‘for 100gns a side’ (a drop in the ocean compared to betting on the event). Joined on top of his own coach by renowned sportsmen/gamblers Sir Charles Bunbury and Lord Grosvenor, George Robinson, ‘after 34 rounds in fifty minutes’, saw that the writing was on the wall and insisted that the bout be stopped: “Damnit, Sir, he’s my coachman and I won’t have him killed!”8\n\nAfter eventually retiring from the ring and from Robinson’s service, Will Wood ended his days as a hackney coachman. The 6th baronet, meanwhile, having succeeded his father in 1815, served in parliament as MP for Northampton, dying unmarried in 1833, aged 68.\n\nThe new squire of Cranford Hall (and Stretton Hall, which would be disposed of within five years) was his nephew, the Rev. Sir George Robinson, who was then also the Rector of Cranford and married to his cousin, Emma Blencowe. The couple’s loss of their eldest son, George, 8, in 1836 and youngest child, Agnes, 9, in 1841, inspired the rebuilding of the south aisle of St. John’s church, complementing the numerous Robinson family memorials to be found in St. Andrew’s (left).\n\nFor long both patron and incumbent of the living, in his later years Sir George stepped back, granting the clerical position to his younger son, Rev. Frederick Robinson, who would similarly become Cranford’s ‘squarson’ as his older brother Sir John Robinson survived their father by barely four years before dying childless in August, 1877. The 8th baronet’s brief tenure was notable for two curious legal challenges to his father’s last will and testament.\n\nFirstly, a dubious ‘codicil’ had been written on the back favouring an attendant latterly assisting the declining squire. Hearing that the 7th baronet was then ‘of unsound mind, his brain having been affected by a violent attack of gout’, a court upheld the validity of the original document.9 Subsequently, ‘Robinson vs. Robinson’ saw Frederick successfully establish that the terms of their father’s will did not give his older brother outright ownership of Cranford Hall’s contents, merely their use for his lifetime.10\n\nBy now the Hall had gained a balustraded terrace to the south (above) and some Tudor-esque alterations to the 18th-century stables complex. But despite such embellishments, and the licensing of lucrative ironstone quarrying on the estate, from about this time the Robinsons began a semi-detachment from the family seat, a circumstance which would obtain well into the 20th century.\n\n*\n\n‘The Hall is the property of the Rev. Sir Frederick Laud Robinson, but at present occupied by Stephen Soames, Esq.’ – Kelly’s Directory of Northamptonshire, 1885.\n\nBeing already ensconced in the rectory, the 9th baronet was now letting the big house, Soames (a barrister) being followed by ‘affable’ Percy Mitchell, a gent of independent means (much of which was directed towards his house in Ireland). Robinson’s only son, also Frederick, would embark on a necessarily peripatetic military career and the steady churn of tenants through the first half of the last century comprised mostly fellow officers of the Northamptonshire Regiment.\n\nAs a teenager, Sir Frederick Robinson (who was just twelve when he succeeded) ‘accidently shot himself in the leg while handling a revolver’, the bullet taking a year to locate and remove.11 However, this experience proved no impediment to decorated campaigns in the Boer War and being twice wounded in World War One. In between he would marry first wife Eileen (‘Minnie’) Higham: ‘As Cranford Hall is let, Sir Frederick and Lady Robinson intend to reside in a charming old-world house in a corner of the park (below), formerly occupied…\n\n… by Mr. W. P. Birch, whom the baronet declared he was sorry to have to turn out.’12 Most enduring of Cranford Hall’s tenants was the final one, Maj. Harry Grant-Thorold, who leased the house from 1922 until his death there in 1946. Soon after this event it was reported that ‘Sir Frederick has had plans approved for Cranford’s partition into eight flats, while [he] himself lives in a small but attractive cottage in the village’.\n\nBut certainly by the early 1970s the Robinsons were back in residence at the Hall, where the 10th baronet would pass away aged 94 in 1975. His eldest son Michael having predeceased him, Cranford was now inherited by grandson Sir John Robinson, then a banker working in Canada; in 1978 he, with Lady Gayle and their two young sons, returned to take on and gradually diversify the traditional agricultural 1,000+acre estate. One co-venture with their ducal neighbour…\n\n… saw guests greeted ‘with champagne and a hearty meal [before] travelling on a horse-drawn carriage to Boughton House, with its outstanding fine art, returning to Cranford Hall for an English tea’ (r). And in the 21st century the energies of the next generation have seen Cranford embrace various enterprises which today typify the mixed-model economy of the modern-day landed estate.\n\nSpringing from ‘an international DJ career [which] spans over 25 years’, the present heir to the baronetcy (left) has developed the boutique Music Barn Festival, held in the “natural amphitheatre” of the now disused (and steadily rewilding) quarries. The future Lady Robinson, meanwhile, oversees Cranford Hall’s country house weddings venture, which exploits its gracious setting and the proximity of the (now otherwise redundant) church of St. Andrew’s.\n\nThe family have also made an unavoidably conspicuous foray into the alternative energy market.\n\nBut, while opportunities to literally move in do occasionally arise, ‘Cranford Hall still serves the purpose for which it was built – the seat of the Robinson family who have lived here for some four centuries and who still own the majority of the land in and around the village…‘15\n\n[Cranford Hall Estates]\n\n1.

Take this assertion from the Middlesex Journal dated December 23, 1769:\n\n‘The report that Lady Betty Germain has left £20,000 and Drayton, her fine estate in Northamptonshire, to Lord George Sackville has no foundation in truth.’\n\nWhile confidently purporting to disabuse its readers, it was in fact they who were being misinformed. Now scepticism about such a spectacular bequest was perhaps understandable since there were no family ties between this particular lord and lady. But this was merely the latest in a sequence of unlikely twists in the destiny of Drayton House, ‘so fine a place [yet which] changed families so often and so quickly, without purchase or descent’.1\n\n‘One of the best-kept secrets of the English country-house world, Drayton has remained hidden, mysterious, rarely open, guarding its privacy’ across more than 700 years.2 Though ‘far less well-known than the other Sackville house at Knole in Kent, Drayton [similarly] resembles a small fortified village in a parkland setting, retains outstanding C17 and C18 furnishings, and has not been subject to any major alterations during the past 200 years.’3\n\nLord George Sackville’s death in 1785 closed perhaps the most remarkable one hundred years in Drayton’s long history. Vita Sackville-West’s tart summation of her ancestor as ‘a soldier first and then a statesman, both disastrously‘ undersells a rollercoaster life in which the inheritance of Drayton was a welcome upswing. That of his ‘fairy godmother’4 Lady Betty Germain was, by contrast, a life of singular constancy.\n\nYet while she would be chatelaine in widowhood for over half a century, the earlier eight-year tenure of Lady Mary Mordaunt (later Duchess of Norfolk) was of greater moment for it introduced to Drayton the charming adventurist who was to wed them both. Sir John Germain provoked one of the most notorious and significant divorces in British history but would also play a major role in transforming Drayton House into ‘one of the most extraordinary buildings in England’.5\n\n‘Drayton is hidden in its pastoral landscape. The approach is a magical one, silvery-grey walls and a tiered roofline of battlements, turrets, towers and cupolas.’3\n\nThe remarkably unified symmetry of the house’s SE-facing front belies its structural evolution in five discrete phases over 400 years from the end of the thirteenth century. The last of these included the fine early-C18 forecourt gates displaying the insignia of Mary, Duchess of Norfolk and her second husband, marking not just their union but also, it transpired, the point at which Drayton would pivot away from a 400-year-old hereditary lineage.\n\nThe medieval structure from the time of Simon de Drayton remains the core of a house which within a few years of his death in 1357 had passed by marriage to Henry Green. Green’s namesake son and heir would be peremptorily executed in 1399 for his energetic allegiance to Richard II but the family’s property survived unscathed. Henry Green III (d. 1467) enlarged Drayton with bookending low towers in his latter years before the estate passed, via his daughter Constance (‘one of the richest heiresses in England’), to John Stafford, 1st Earl of Wiltshire.\n\nThe second earl’s premature death without issue heralded a fifteen-year legal tussle between various parties before the claims of canny Turvey, Bedfordshire-based Henry VIII courtier Lord Mordaunt, through his wife (a Green descendant), prevailed. Mordaunt’s grandson, Lewis, 3rd baron (d.1601), would develop the footprint of Drayton as it stands today with his addition of the three-storey Elizabethan wing extending north-west.\n\nOccupying most of its top floor is the Long Gallery, adapted as a library 200 years later. While original panelling and paintings remain, ‘its ceiling and end window date from the beginning of the C20’.5\n\nSuspected of complicity in the Gunpowder Plot, the 4th Lord Mordaunt spent several months in the Tower, a location with which his grandson, an active ally of James II, would also become reluctantly familiar. Succeeding in 1642 as sixth baron and also now 2nd Earl of Peterborough, Henry Mordaunt backed the losing side in the Civil War, at some cost to his estate. He would be further constrained in his early ownership by the machinations of his mother but upon gaining full control of his entitlements Henry stamped his mark: ‘Everywhere at Drayton we find signs of the building of the second earl.’6\n\nArms raised above a new Classical gateway punched through the C14 wall emphasised the new principal entrance to the south. Knightly nostalgia inspired Mordaunt’s remodelling of the entire north-eastern facade (r) which would now overlook garden pavilions of ‘elegantly severe Puritan minimalism’, all by Inigo Jones’ pupil, John Webb.7\n\nIndoors, Webb (and his client) were rather less restrained, an exuberant State Bedroom overmantel (left) soon part of a three-way fight for attention with the stunning needlework of a major series of Mortlake tapestries (two of which have since escaped to New York) and the magnificent bed itself. Access to the upper floors of this wing would now be via an ingenious feat of carpentry, the Walnut Staircase, ‘a spiral cantilever unique in England’.8 But the most renowned architectural statement at Drayton was still to come.\n\n*\n\nThe second earl had one child, Lady Mary Mordaunt, who in 1677 would vault from mid-table aristocracy to the premier ranked title in the land by marrying Henry Howard, soon to become the seventh Duke of Norfolk. But the wheels began to come off this dream alliance one day in 1685 with the duke’s discovery that his wife had taken a lover. Enter John (later Sir John) Germain, Anglo-Dutch ‘soldier of fortune’ and gambler, a man dubious of morals and parentage (reputedly an illegitimate half-brother of William of Orange).\n\nAn imposed sojourn in a French convent failed to break Mary’s ardour, the couple continuing barely clandestine liasons at various residences across London, seamy details of which would spill out in sensational protracted divorce proceedings eventually initiated by the duke in 1691.\n\nThere was a lot at stake, including the authority of the Church in such matters. For the duke, mindful he had yet to produce an heir, had taken his case directly to parliament as the Church would not sanction remarriage following a divorce on the grounds of adultery. Over the course of a three-act, nine-year saga Norfolk and his agents subpoenaed sundry ex-servants to reveal quite literally what the butler saw, evidence savoured line-by-line in printed reports by a prurient public.\n\nThe duchess denied everything and threw plenty back, aided by those ‘anxious to protect her reputation and property’.9 The latter had long been an issue, Mary claimed, revealing that a supplicant duke had once tried to persuade her mother that ‘if her daughter would consent that Drayton should be settled upon him he would thereby be made a happy man’.\n\nIn early 1700 Henry Howard finally got his divorce (‘the beginning of the long process whereby the state took control from the church’9) but little else, dying in 1701 aged 46. Six months later the duchess – a title she refused to relinquish – married her scandalous beau, the couple quickly calling in ‘William III’s favourite architect in England’, William Talman, to execute some defining flourishes at Drayton House.5\n\nMost conspicuous were twin tower extensions and cupolas accenting the roof-line; most striking, a new front to the main range facing the inner courtyard, ‘one of the most ornate Baroque facades in Britain, an architectural tour de force‘.2 That entrance…\n\n… leads into Drayton’s principal interior space, the Great Hall (left), Talman’s pilasters reaching to a barrel ceiling inserted beneath the medieval roof. (Decoration is mid-C19 by Alexander Roos, then also busy designing.. Cardiff.)\n\nAlas, the duchess had little time to enjoy her newly-fashionable surroundings, dying childless in 1705. With her final act she would succeed in putting another noble nose seriously out of joint. For, having inherited the Mordaunt barony and estate in her own right, Mary now bequeathed Drayton in its entirety to her second husband. It could perhaps be argued that the biggest bet of Sir John Germain’s life had paid off wildly, indeed that ‘Drayton was a reward for adultery’.10 Certainly, one individual was especially galled by Sir Johnny-come-lately’s spectacular fortune.\n\nCharles Mordaunt, Mary’s cousin, had succeeded as 3rd Earl of Peterborough upon his uncle’s death in 1697. A soon-to-be celebrated military hero, he now renewed his claim to the property, ‘concluding it highly unreasonable so noble a branch of the ancient estate, and the only seat of the family, should be torn from it to be settled on strangers’. Meanwhile, 55-year-old Sir John Germain – ‘always a favourite of the other sex’10 – would meet and marry Lady Elizabeth Berkeley, 26, within a year of his first wife’s death, and the embellishment of Drayton continued apace.\n\n‘John hearts Betty’ heraldic insignia now started popping up around Drayton, notably atop courtyard colonnades which would flank Talman’s bravura facade. Internally, the ceiling and walls of his stone staircase would be swathed with trompe l’oeil mythology.\n\nCharles Mordaunt’s keen promotion of William III’s usurping of Catholic James II may have had a satisfying outcome but it proved something of a tactical blunder in his quest for Drayton since it landed his uncle in the Tower. The second earl so arranged his affairs as to provide maximum protection for Mary’s interests: ‘We must conclude that his emnity to his nephew was great enough to belittle in his eyes his daughter’s pecadilloes.’6\n\nGermain died in 1718 and is handsomely memorialised in Lowick church. His widow would later recall, ‘My Lord Peterborow plagued Sir John all his lifetime but declared if ever he gave the estate to me, he would have done with it; and accordingly has kept his word, like an honourable man’. And so, having been both a legal battlefield and a construction site for much of the preceding two decades, Drayton now entered a half-century of stability under the benign auspices of Lady Betty Germain.\n\nAside from her finely-wrought restoration of the private chapel (which had been sacked by an anti-popery mob in 1688), throughout her long tenure Lady Betty was largely content to maintain the fabric of Drayton House much as it was at the moment her husband died.\n\nOutside, ‘though she lived well into the period when the landscape school prevailed, Lady Betty defended her great walled enclosures from the invasion of Kent and Brown’.6 The formal parterres (left) would finally succumb to the exigencies of World War II occupation but today ‘a sea of dull lawn’ is still dotted with Betty’s lead urns and statuary.7\n\nSeeking at one point to enlarge the (now 200-plus acre) park in order that the house might sit more centrally, Lady Betty told her longtime friend and regular correspondent Jonathan Swift of her obligatory dealings with the wheedling local parson, “who flatters me black and blue when he comes for Sunday dinner”. Indeed, a desire for stimulating company would make visits to Drayton infrequent, Lady Betty largely preferring the social whirl of her St. James Square townhouse. And there was always the nearer option of Knole House in Kent.\n\nThe Sackvilles, Lionel, first Duke of Dorset, and his wife Elizabeth, were mutual friends of Sir John and Lady Germain who, having lost three children in infancy, latterly determined that Drayton should pass to a Sackville younger son in the event of Lady Betty not remarrying. Thereafter, Knole would effectively become her second home and her personal apartment (r) is now among the principal ‘showrooms‘ preserved there by the National Trust.\n\nThe Drayton estate eventually became the property of 53-year-old Lord George Sackville in 1769 with the proviso that he take the name Germain. In truth, already having the use of Stoneland (now Buckhurst Park) in Sussex, Sackville was perhaps more appreciative of a new identity than another big house in the country at this particular juncture. For during the past ten years his name had – by royal edict – been mud.\n\nSackville’s problems began in Germany on 1 August, 1759. No less a figure than the King himself, George II, would see to it that Lord George suffered exemplary humiliation following perceived failings as second-in-command of allied forces at the Battle of Minden. Sackville’s demand for a court martial that he might counter the reputational slurs of Prince Ferdinand backfired: he was proclaimed “unfit to serve His Majesty in any military capacity whatsoever”, the King relishing “a fate worse than death”.\n\nSackville continued as a member of parliament but ‘the whole of his public life was embittered and conditioned by the national memory of his conviction’.11 A year after inheriting Drayton, the latest jibe from a fellow MP on the floor of the House of Commons led to (the now) Lord George Germain taking aim at Governor George Johnstone at twenty paces in Hyde Park. Both men missed but Johnstone’s final shot blew Germain’s pistol clean out of his hand. His duelling demeanour certainly impressed Horace Walpole: “Whatever Lord George Sackville was, Lord George Germain is a hero!”\n\nHaving lost his honour and almost his life Lord George would soon lose, er, America! Rehabilitated by Lord North as Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1775, ‘Germain inherited a conflict that was already going badly for Britain [yet] was inevitably held by posterity to be more responsible than any other individual for the British loss in America’.12 But he would at least regain the family name, being created Viscount Sackville by a grateful George III upon his eventual retirement from office.\n\nLike his benefactor before him, Sackville’s busy London diary and other residential options meant limited involvement with Drayton. But he was minded to remodel the Dining Room (left) and the Green Drawing Room in Neo-Classical vein, the work attributed to Sir William Chambers. ‘He also left behind handsome portraits of himself by Reynolds and Romney.’5\n\nSince the viscount’s death in 1785 Drayton ‘has suffered no major alteration or addition’ and resumed a rather more conventional line of descent.13 His son Charles inherited not only Drayton but also, separately, the dukedom of Dorset, fifth and last of that ilk. Though ‘a fashionable figure of the Regency and a favourite with the ladies’, the duke died unmarried and childless in 1843, Drayton now devolving to his niece, Mrs. Caroline Stopford.10 Her son, the similarly childless Stopford Sackville Stopford would be squire of Drayton’s 6,000 acres for 54 years until dying in his bathtub at the Carlton Club in 1926.\n\n“Tea and ices at a cafe a mile and a half from the firing line.\n\nThis is a strange war.“14\n\nAs recently recounted, Lionel and Geoffrey, the elder nephews of ‘Uncle Sack’ would both become casualties of World War One, the Drayton estate consequently passing to their younger brother, Nigel Stopford Sackville. In turn, ‘a massive programme of restoration, all of it without government grants,’2 would be carried out by his son upon taking the reins in 1973; his grandson is the present owner, just the eleventh at Drayton since 1642.\n\nThat three of these in sequence acceded with no rooted affiliation to this ‘vast, homely yet palatial pile’15, and five failed to produce a direct heir, the survival of Drayton House intact and unsold across 700 years is surely, like the place itself, a thing of wonder…\n\n[Drayton Estate][House plan][GI listing]\n\n[Update 2023: Drayton stars as the ‘big house’ in new feature film ‘Saltburn’ – trailer here]\n\n1.

The above being an extract from the proceedings of a parliamentary Bill, entitled “An Act to dissolve the Marriage of John Nash Architect with Jane Kerr his now Wife, and to enable him to marry again’. Such was the requirement of the age. The helpfully disapproving witness here being probed to establish grounds was Mrs. Ann Morgan, landlady, of Aberavon. And also, as it happens, a close relative of John Nash…\n\n…who was not, at this juncture, ‘the celebrated John Nash’ of Regency fame but a chastened bankrupt on the long road to rehabilitation. A long and mostly Welsh road, it turned out. The implosion of an early property development enterprise in London’s Bloomsbury Square would see Nash eventually fleeing the capital to south Wales, ‘his business reputation in ruins’.1 His wife Jane had already been packed off to the Principality, her shopaholic tendencies only exacerbating the financial strain; Nash enlisted a childhood friend, the aforesaid Mr Charles Charles, ‘to ride out with her and show her the pleasures of the country’.\n\nNudge, nudge, wink, wink?\n\nThe suspicion of collusion ultimately doomed Nash’s divorce petition but not before several other associates had been summoned to Parliament to bear witness, among them a fellow architect, Samuel Simon Saxon. In 1785 John Nash’s modest first step on the path back to professional credibility had been a winning tender jointly with Saxon to re-roof St. Peter’s church in Carmarthen; their partnership would continue for several years.2 Today, while many landmark creations in the capital and beyond attest to Nash’s wildly successful renaissance, the name of Samuel Saxon, a pupil of Sir William Chambers at the influential Office of Works until 1782, languishes in obscurity.3 Little of his work is recorded and in fact just one house designed by him is known to survive – but it’s a gem.\n\n‘Courteenhall is a remarkably perfect and rather unusual example of the mid-sized Georgian house of the last decade of the C18. Since it was completed no change of significance has been made.’4 The seat of the Wake family, this house and estate has passed directly from father to son, the present head of the family being Sir Hereward Wake, 14th baronet, who turns 100 later this year.\n\nIf the brief from Sir William Wake, 9th bt., had been for a practically proportioned house of stately refinement then Samuel Saxon pretty much nailed it. Humphry Repton in his ‘Red Book’ for Courteenhall (1791/93) notes that he was consulted both as to the siting of a new house and its basic form, being ‘induced to prefer that which has been so elegantly designed and executed by my ingenious friend Mr. Saxon’.5\n\nThe pair were also responsible for the creation of Buckminster Park, Leicestershire, (c.1793-8, Saxon’s only other known house, demolished in 1952 and replaced), a connection suggested to explain just how it came to be that the enviable opportunity ‘to design a completely new house on a virgin site was given to a little-known pupil of Chambers’.4\n\nHowever, Handed on finds another timeline no less persuasive.\n\nInheriting Courteenhall and its existing Elizabethan manor house as a minor, the 9th baronet came of age in 1789. The next year would be a lucrative one, the sale of a substantial property in Norfolk yielding £18,000 whilst William’s marriage in July to Mary Sitwell of Renishaw Hall added a further £25,000 to the coffers.5 Meanwhile, on May 15 1790 it was announced after an open competition that the architect to design and supervise the building of Northampton’s new General Infirmary – just six miles north of Courteenhall – was to be a certain Mr. Samuel Saxon. Construction of the hospital duly got under way but it would seem that the attention of its designer was soon distracted:\n\n‘Mr. Saxon presumably drew his commission but he had seldom been near the building, leaving everything to his Clerk of Works.’6 Genteel, wealthy patron trumps municipal functionality? Who can say.\n\n(Remarkably, the contemporaneous connection between Saxon’s only two known buildings continues as Courteenhall’s present occupant and estate manager, the grandson of Sir Hereward Wake, is also a sometime medic and presently attached to .. Northampton General Hospital.)\n\nHowever it was that Samuel Saxon landed the job, there’s no doubting that Courteenhall bears the stamp of a focussed mind. ‘The design throughout is remarkably coherent,’ characterised by a wholly admirable restraint.7 Of local limestone ashlar, the pedimented seven-bay garden facade (top) announces itself most directly, a subtle contrast to the more understated entrance front (r).\n\nA most pleasing exterior which is more than matched within: ‘[That] Saxon was an architect of very considerable ability [is] most clearly shown by the interiors.’8\n\nAt one remove from the long entrance hall, ‘the thin, cantilevered treads of the principal staircase’, top-lit by a glazed oval dome, rise against marbled walls, ‘a rare survival’. (Picture: Tom Jamieson / Courteenhall Events@Facebook). Beneath fine decorative friezes fluted columns articulate each of the principal spaces, the apsidal end of the library, ‘beautifully contrived with doors curved to fit’, exemplifying Saxon’s sure-footed finesse.9\n\nSitting at the heart of the 3,000-acre estate, Courteenhall’s presence is one of graceful reticence. The same can hardly be said, however, of the stables across the park, born with ideas above their station and which predate the house by perhaps two decades. Credited to John Carr of York and now converted for residential use – move in! – the always incongruously scaled block…\n\n… was erected for the mostly absent 8th baronet seemingly in an effort to keep up with the (hunting mad) Joneses locally. In fact, prior to his father deciding otherwise, his own family literally were the Joneses round here.\n\nThe Wake Joneses to be precise. The Wake lineage can be definitively traced back to at least the C13; from 1265 they were lords of the manor of Blisworth immediately next door to Courteenhall before selling in 1532. The happenstance which would see them boomerang back here 140 years later suggests a certain predestination about the Wakes’ habitation of this particular corner of England.\n\nIn the grounds at Courteenhall is a C17 schoolhouse (r) now partly converted for residential use and latterly the home of Sir Hereward and Lady Wake. A Latin inscription above the main door records that the school had been endowed by Sir Samuel Jones, the acquisitive son of a wealthy London merchant, who bought the Courteenhall estate in 1647. With no children of his own Jones’ intended heir was his nephew, Sam Pierrepoint, until some offence by the latter saw him cut out of the will.\n\nFortune now favoured the only other Samuel in the family, the fifth son of Sir Samuel’s niece, wife of Sir William Wake, 3rd bt., on condition of taking the name. But the drought of direct heirs continued. Two ‘Wake Jones’ nephews and a distant cousin later Courteenhall (and several other properties) came to Sir William, 7th bt., who had been born and elected to stay a Wake. The name had been reclaimed ‘but it was Samuel Jones who supplied the seat and inheritance upon which a succession of Wakes have lived happily ever after since’.10\n\nToday, the family’s distinctive heraldic emblem, the “Wake Knot“, has taken on a coincidental resonance at Courteenhall with happy couples now able to tie their own against the backdrop of Samuel Saxon’s comely creation. The house was among those featured in the The New Vitruvius Britannicus (1802, left), ‘plans and elevations of modern buildings by the most celebrated architects’.\n\n(The demolished Buckminster Park was also included. Hard to believe today but Courteenhall faced the same post-war fate until wiser counsel prevailed.5)\n\nWith such an elegant early calling card, to find the architect still keeping good company and apparently well in the game some twenty years on (r) is no great surprise; the mystifying scarcity of his work, however, most certainly is…\n\n[Courteenhall Estate][G.II* listing]\n\n1.

For over the course of those twelve months each would separately inherit a country house estate: as second-born children of their respective families neither eventuality had been preordained. Ernest’s elder brother, Edward, had died months before the couple’s 1898 wedding at which the bride, the eldest of three sisters, had been given away by her only brother. Having followed his family’s strong military tradition, Grenadier Guardsman Guy Tyron died less than three years later serving in the Boer War. So it was that the ownership of the Lyndon and Bulwick estates coalesced with the Conants, with whom they remain today. Handily, they’re just six miles apart as the crow flies.\n\nTo the mellow lanes of Rutland and its Northamptonshire borders we go, an area recently named Britain’s best rural place to live, the only drawback apparently being the relative cost of property. The value of the two houses featuring here has, of course, never been tested since neither has ever come onto the open market. Built at precisely the same time, Lyndon Hall and Bulwick Hall have also remained entirely private (not that there is a shortage of epic house-visiting opportunities locally with historic family seats like Rockingham Castle, Deene Park and Burghley all within a ten-mile radius).\n\nCommonly, estates with no public access or venue facilities to promote make little or no effort web-wise. Which makes comely Lyndon Hall all the more exceptional, its online presence being fairly crammed with historical and architectural information way beyond the call of duty. But then such fulsome documenting is rather in keeping with the bent of Lyndon’s builder, Conant antecedent Abel Barker, whose thorough preparatory studies led one authority to declare Lyndon to be the only house of the period ‘that can be related in detail to the architectural literature on which it is based’.\n\nA successful C17 sheep dealer and merchant, Barker’s various activities took him often to London but his second wife Mary would correspond regularly, reminding him that, for all their relative prosperity, the family badly needed a decent place to live. ‘The saddest weather for a day and a night that I ever knew in my life. The wind broke the windows and beat in the rain so that..I was forced to carry [the children] into the kitchen to be dressed,’ she reported in February 1662. Months later Abel acquired the estate at Lyndon but for various reasons Mary would have a further 15 years to wait before their new Hall was completed.\n\nAbel Barker immersed himself in contemporary architectural thinking ahead of formulating his design. 1662 was also the year in which Roger Pratt completed his influential first house, Coleshill. Though altogether more modest (closer in scale to another house of the period, Thorpe Hall in Cambridgeshire) Lyndon speaks to some degree of this transitional phase in English country house building.\n\nBarker’s eventual blueprints would be realised with the aid of his man on the ground, local surveyor John Sturges. But even when construction finally got under way progress was to be regularly frustrated as Mrs B. would relay to her oft-absent husband. ‘Your building goes on not in the least,’ she reported in June 1673. ‘It is the saddest weather that was ever known of man for this time of year. All the masons [were] constrained to go away. Suttons stayed the longest but John said they did more harm than good.’\n\nIt’s perhaps just as well that Sir Abel (as he became) was so intellectually and practically engaged by this project as he would have relatively little time to enjoy the end product, dying in 1679 just two years after Lyndon’s completion aged 61.\n\nMeanwhile, a few miles to the south…\n\n‘Bulwick was built in 1676 on the site of a 16th-century house and incorporates some of its fabrics. It had hipped roofs and stone-crossed mullioned windows, comparable in style with such nearby contemporary houses as..Lyndon Hall, Rutland.’¹ Don’t be misled by that past tense, however, Bulwick Hall still stands but is not quite as its builder knew it. Where Lyndon to this day projects a satisfying conceptual completeness Bulwick Hall displays a puzzling disposition characteristic of the unfinished or the much-reduced. Here it’s the latter. Interestingly, an extant 1728 map indicates that…\n\n… Bulwick’s substantial truncation occurred barely fifty years after the house’s completion.\n\nBetween Lyndon and Bulwick is the village of Harringworth. Still part of the Conant estates today, in the early 1620s this manor was purchased by Moses Tryon, a London merchant of Dutch extraction. It was his stepson James who would develop the Bulwick property to the SE creating a three-sided courtyard house with ‘over 40 rooms including a long gallery and chapel’. But following Charles Tryon’s later decision to downsize, for almost 300 years all that has remained is the 12-bay, two-storey N range and perpendicular to this the ‘remarkable and unusual’ ballustraded loggia.²\n\nThe last major development of Bulwick Hall was undertaken in the early C19 by Thomas Tyron who, in addition to remodelling the interiors, would add the curiously proportioned bowed extension. When he died in 1825 the estate was inherited by his 22-year-old son, also Thomas, whose 47-year tenure as squire ended most abruptly when he was thrown from his horse, perishing instantly. In stark contrast to the reporting of this unfortunate incident…\n\n… which received but brief notice in the provincial press, the sensational demise of Thomas’ third son 21 years later would consume a great many column inches in The Times and beyond. For the career of renowned naval commander Vice-Admiral Sir George Tryon was to end calamitously and with ‘the largest peacetime loss of life in the history of the Royal Navy’.³\n\nWidely regarded as ‘navigation genius’, Bulwick-born Tryon’s instincts were to inexplicably fail him one fateful day in 1893 off the coast of Tripoli. Helming the mighty HMS Victoria he directed a tight fleet manoeuvre that alarmed the officers under him but which, through a combination of faith and fear, they attempted to execute. The resulting collision caused the flagship to sink swiftly with the loss of 358 lives including that of Tryon himself. Remarkably, in 2004 the wreck of HMS Victoria was discovered standing vertically, bow-first in the Mediterranean seabed (↑).\n\nSir George’s widow was naturally in attendance five years later at the wedding of his niece, Eva, the event (mentioned at the outset) which would effectively ally the Bulwick and Lyndon estates. On the groom’s side that day were his sisters – all nine of them. Historically, a preponderance of daughters – like the consequences of military service – has affected the continuity of many a family estate. Since then at Lyndon the gender balance has evened itself out. At Bulwick, meanwhile, the heir remains most apparent…\n\n[Lyndon Estate | GII* listing][Bulwick Estates | GII* listing]\n\n¹ Heward, J. & Taylor, R.
