These notes reflect that confusion!.\n\nThe Douglases of Glenbervie were descended from the Hon. Sir William Douglas, second son of Archibald, fifth earl of Angus, commonly called the great earl. He obtained from his father the lands of Braidwood in Lanarkshire, about the year 1510, and by his marriage with Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of Sir James Auchinleck of Auchinleck(1) in Ayrshire, he acquired the lands and barony of Glenbervie in Kincardineshire. He was knighted in 1511, but was killed at flodden in 1513. He was succeeded by his only son, Sir Archibald Douglas, who was knighted by King James the Fifth when his lands were erected in the Barony of Glenbervie in 1538, and again in 1542.\n\nThe son of the latter, Sir William Douglas of Glenbervie, knight, (afterwards ninth earl of Angus) was a steady friend of Queen Mary. He accompanied her majesty in her expedition to the north against the earl of Huntley, and behaved with great bravery at the fight of Corrichie, in 1562 He was succeeded in the estate of Glenbervie by his second son, The Hon.

Sir Roberts only son, Sir William, second baronet, married Anne, daughter and heiress of James Douglas of Stonypath and Ardit in Fife, with whom he got a great accession to his estate. He died in the reign of Charles the Second. His only son, Sir Robert, third baronet, commanded the Scots royals at the battle of Steinkirk in 1692, where he fell, and having no male issue, the title devolved upon is cousin, Robert Douglas of Ardit, (grandson of the Rev. Dr. George Douglas, rector of Stephney,) who was the second son of Sir Robert Douglas, brother of the tenth earl of Angus. Sir Robert died in 1750. His eldest son, Sir William Douglas, fifth baronet, a lawyer of great eminence and learning, was, in 1726, chosen provost of the city of St. Andrews, and was annually re-elected for nineteen years. He married Elizabeth, daughter of John Douglas of Garvald, and died without issue in July 1764, when the title devolved upon his brother, Sir Robert Douglas, editor of the Peerage of Scotland.\n\nThe baronetage of Glenbervie lapsed on the death of his only son Sir Alexander, a physician of eminence.

Perth, whose representative in 1630 was served heir male for Mr John, second son of Sir John above named, and uncle of the heiress, he being descended from a brother of Sir John.
