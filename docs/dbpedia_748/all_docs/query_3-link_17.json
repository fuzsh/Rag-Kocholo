The fifth Baronet represented Ipswich, Thetford and Suffolk in Parliament. The title became extinct on the death of the seventh Baronet in 1766.\n\nThe Barker Baronetcy, of Hambleton in the County of Rutland, was created in the Baronetage of England on 9 September 1665 for Abel Barker, Member of Parliament for Rutland.[2] The title became extinct on the death of the second Baronet in 1707.\n\nThe Barker Baronetcy, of Bocking Hall in the County of Essex, was created in the Baronetage of England on 29 March 1676 for William Barker.[3] The title became extinct on the death of the fourth Baronet in 1818.
