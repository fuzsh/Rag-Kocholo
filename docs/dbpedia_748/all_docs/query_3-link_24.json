His family made strenuous efforts to locate him during the years that followed, and their quest was noticed in the newspapers. The following article appeared in the Melbourne 'Argus' on 15 July 1922, apparently reprinted from the London 'Daily Chronicle' :- 'Where is Sir Claude James Rivett-Carnac? Residence \"[ ]\" in Debrett's Peerage indicates that nobody knows. And a fortune awaits him if he can be found. His sister, Mrs. Foulerton, wife of Dr. H. P. Foulerton, M.D., of His Majesty's Prison Service, is trying to get into touch with her baronet brother, who has been \"lost\" to the family for 14 years. She last heard of him indirectly three years ago. \"I am most anxious that my brother should communicate with me at once,\" said Mrs. Foulerton to a \"Daily Chronicle\" representative. \"He is the fourth baronet, and yet it is not even certain whether he knows that he has succeeded to the title. We last saw him at home in England in 1908, which was the year before his father's death. Sir Claude went abroad again in 1908, leaving no address. From time to time, through various channels, we have heard of him as being in the South Sea Isles and in Canada, on the Pacific coast of America, and in South Africa. The latest news he have of him is that he was seen in South Africa about three years ago. He is believed to be married. The only evidence, however, we have of this is a report which appeared in a Sunday newspaper in 1915 that he had married an actress in San Francisco. Otherwise, his heir is a cousin, William Percival Rivett Carnac. It is possible - and from my knowledge of him probable - that Sir Claude has known about his succession to the title and never bothered to take up the legal claim. But whether he knows or does not know as to his succession to the title, there is a monetary side to the matter. I have reason to believe he is unaware of the extent of the money to which he is duly entitled. It amounts to many thousands of pounds. For nearly 14 years the Baronetcy fund has been accumulating, with interest, and it is only fit and proper that he should take some action to clear up the financial position. For my own sake I would be delighted to hear from my brother. I have no quarrel with him, and if his eye should catch these words, I appeal to him to write to me without delay \" On 11 March 1924, an order was issued in the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice in London which gave leave to presume the death of Sir Claude Rivett-Carnac as having occurred on 31 December 1909. As far as I can tell, this case was never reported in the usual fashion of law reports. The Chancery Reports of 1924 include no reference to the case, nor can I find any reference to it in any other legal reports. The order issued by the Chancery Division could surely only have been based on evidence that Sir Claud was in fact dead, but I have been unable to ascertain, thus far, the nature of this evidence. The following brief history of the family was published in the Brisbane \"Telegraph\" of 4 June 1924:- 'Sir William Percival Rivett-Carnac, Bt., died in a nursing home at Bognor on March 21, at the age of 76. His kinsman, Sir Claude James Rivett-Carnac, had been missing for many years and it was only on March 11 last that an order was issued in the Chancery Division giving leave to assume his death, unmarried, on December 31, 1909. 'The Rivetts, says the London \"Times,\" are an ancient Norman family descended in unbroken male line from Thomas Ryvet, of Fritton, Norfolk, in 1272. Elizabeth Rivett, whose portrait by Reynolds is in the Wallace collection, married, in 1769, as his second wife, General John Carnac, Commander in Chief in Bengal, who directed in his will that his brother-in-law James Rivett, Governor of Bombay in the Honourable East India Company's service, should take the additional name of Carnac. Thereafter many Rivett-Carnacs distinguished themselves in the service of the Crown, especially in India. They are indeed one of the four families (the other three being the Plowdens, the Trevors, and the Beadons ) who are mentioned by Kipling in \"The Day's Work\" to show 'that certain families serve India generation after generation as dolphins follow in line across the open sea.' Last May we had to record the death of Colonel J.H. Rivett-Carnac, C.I.E., a brilliant administrator, who was a grandson of the Rivett who first took the name of Carnac. 'Mr James Rivett-Carnac, who was the Chairman of the East India Company and Governor of Bombay, was created a baronet in 1836. Sir Claude was his great-grandson, the only son of Sir James Henry Sproule Rivett-Carnac, the third baronet, by his marriage to Mary Jeannie, daughter of Ambrose Henderson, of Bodmin. He was born on December 21, 1877, and early showed a preference for an adventurous life. He first went abroad in his 'teens and joined the Cape Mounted Rifles. In the South African War he served throughout , and received the medal with five clasps. Then he resumed his wanderings, and at intervals his family heard of him in the South Sea Islands, in Canada, on the Pacific Coast, and in South Africa. He came back to England in 1903, but soon went abroad again. The death of his father on June 4, 1909, did not bring him back, if he ever heard of it. Years elapsed before the fact of his death on December 31, 1909, was established, and meanwhile his inheritance accumulated. Sir Claude had two sisters, Mrs. H.P. Foulerton and Mrs. F.C. Van Cordlandt. 'On Sir Claude's death, Mr. William Percival Rivett-Carnac, who has just died, became the fifth baronet, but did not assume the title until the order of the Court was obtained. He had there- fore held it only for 10 days. Sir William was a grandson of the first baronet, and the eldest son of William John Rivett-Carnac, of the East India Company's service, who died in 1874. He was born in 1847, and married in 1885 Frances Maria, daughter of the late Francis Charles Forbes of the Bengal Civil Service. He had, with two daughters, an only son, James Frank, a Captain in the Bengal Service, who died without issue. 'The title now devolves on Sir William's next brother, the Rev. George Rivett-Carnac, who was born in 1850, was sent to Harrow, and went up to Trinity, Cambridge. After preparation at Chichester, he was ordained to the curacy of Caston, Norfolk. For some years he was curate at Kew, and then in succession vicar of Tong, Shropshire, vicar of Thrope, Surrey, rector of Graveley, Herts and rector of Swefling [?], Suffolk. In 1913 the Bishop of Southwark [Hubert Burge] collated him to the rectory of Woldingham, Surrey. He married first, in 1885, Emily Louisa (who died in 1894) daughter of the Rev. George Crabbe, rector of Merton, Norfolk, and had two sons, Henry George Crabbe Rivett-Carnac, late Indian Police, born 1889, and Lieutenant- Commander J.W. Rivett-Carnac, D.S.O., born in 1891, and one daughter, Mrs. B.S. Wilmot. He married secondly, in 1901, Eva Mary Bernard, daughter of James Orr, and by her has a son and a daughter. The new baronet has four brothers, including Colonel P.T. Rivett-Carnac and Colonel E.H. Rivett-Carnac.' Sir John Beverley Robinson, 4th baronet [UK 1854] The article below was published in the Sydney \"Sun\" of 14 April 1913, reprinted from an American paper, almost certainly the \"New York World.\" 'There's a modest little middle-aged gentleman in a modest little old-fashioned office in a rather obscure building at No. 16, Exchange-place, New York, who has something that many a millionaire would give over at least one or two of his millions for. An invention? - No. A secret of perpetual youth? A cure for baldness? A remedy for dyspepsia or gout? - No. Simply a perfectly good, properly old and eminently desirous title. Sir John Beverley Robinson, Baronet. 'He thinks so little of his rank that he doesn't bother about the title. Instead of lording it in England or Canada - which he might - he engages in the paving stone business in New York, and instead of inhabiting some ancient and gloomy castle, he lives in a comfortable modern cottage in the none-too-fashionable suburb of Edgewater, New Jersey. Instead of styling him- self Sir John, he insists on being plain \"Mister.\" And to those in the paving stone line who know him he is even plain \"Robinson\" or \"Beverley.\" \"Mister\" Robinson's rank, which he has succeeded in keeping very much to the background for a long time, came to light the other day when he arrived from England on the Minnehaha, returning from a short visit. The British booking office, learning exactly who he was on the other side, plastered his name on the passenger list in big, black type as \"Sir J. Beverley Robinson, Bart.\" and the ship-news reporters who met the vessel immediately began to ask him about the suffragettes, the old age pension system, and other things Britannic. 'For answer, he gave them a long and hearty laugh. \"Why, I've lived in New York City since before most of you youngsters were born,\" he said. \"And I don't want to be 'Sir John,' but plain 'Robinson.' Come down to my office in Exchange Place some day and pay me a visit.\" 'A \"World\" reporter accepted the invitation and dropped in next afternoon. The baronet, who was conducting some correspondence, after the English fashion, in long hand, at once dropped business and became a host. \"I wish you'd forgot about this affair of the title,\" he laughed. \"I almost forget it myself at times. Of course, I'm a British subject, and I am proud of my ancestry and all that. But a title doesn't amount to anything here. A man in America is what he makes himself - and anywhere else in the world, for that matter. I've been here for more that thirty years and I suppose I will spend the rest of my life right about New York. And I can get along very comfortably just as 'Robinson' or 'Beverley.' Please don't write anything about me.\" 'It took a lot of pressing to get the baronet to tell about his family - the records of which are duly spread forth over a full page of the \"Who's Who\" of the British nobility: \"Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage.\" 'His earliest American ancestor was Christopher Robinson, who was sent there in the middle of the seventeenth century as the first Colonial Secretary of Virginia, and married Catherine Beverley. His son, Christopher II, was an officer of the Queen's Rangers during the Revolution, and after the defeat of the British forces was given a grant of land in the Canadian wilds, which has since become Toronto. The third in the line was the first to hold the title. This was the first John Beverley Robinson, [grand]father of the present baronet. He was a barrister and Attorney-General of Upper Canada. He was created a baronet in 1854 and died in 1863. His eldest son, James Lukin Robinson, succeeded to the title. He likewise was a barrister. Upon his death, in August, 1894, the baronetage passed to a cousin, Sir Frederick Arnold Robinson, who died in Toronto in 1901. 'Thereupon the rank fell upon the present Sir John, who is the fourth baronet. In 1901 he had been in New York about two score years, and was, in all outward appearances, a thorough- going American. He simply accepted the baronetage because there wasn't anything else he could do, and made no fuss about it. As a matter of fact, he didn't even let news of it get into the papers. 'There is another John Beverley Robinson, his son, who is eighteen years old, and going to college, and he will be the fifth baronet, but, his father says, he won't make any fuss over the title, either. 'The Robinsons have never gone in for society, outside that of a small circle of friends and fellow church members in the little Jersey town. \"I'd really much rather talk about paving blocks,\" said Sir John to the \"World\" man, as he displayed a sample of the material he deals in. \"This is a block made of blast furnace slag in northern England.\" It is shapelier and more durable than granite, he says, and has been used to pave several avenues in Washington. The Long Island approach to the Queensborough Bridge is also paved with the blocks. Sir John has made a bid for several large contracts to pave streets in Manilla for the government. 'Despite his long residence here, he has kept closely in touch with affairs in England through his many visits, and when there, of course, is hailed by his title and receives the precedence due to his rank. But so modest has he been about being a baronet while in America that scarcely any of his business friends and only a few of the residents of Edgewater ever heard of Sir John Beverley Robinson.' ************************ After his death, the following [edited] obituary was published in the \"New York Times\" on 13 November 1933:- 'Sir John Beverley Robinson died today at Burk's Falls, Ont., in his eighty-sixth year. Born in Toronto, Sir John was educated at Upper Canada College, Toronto. He founded the firm of Robinson & Heath in 1874, which he later sold to his cousin, after which he made his home at Glenwood in Edgewater, N.J. Returning to Canada, he settled on the 500-acre farm which had been his reward for services during the Fenian raids in 1866. 'Despite his 85 years, Sir John was quite active. His greatest interest was developing the mining claim on his farm at Burk's Falls, with the aid of his wife, Lady Eleanor, and a neighbor's boy, Kelly Sinclair. Sir John's hunt for gold on his property was the result of a prophecy made by a friend of his wife who had never been in Canada, but who professed to describe the location of the mineralized vein on the farm. 'Sir John once was in the paving stone business in New York and had a modest home in Edgewater, N.J. He had been residing and earning his living here for several years prior to the death of the third baronet, Sir Frederick Arnold Robinson, in Toronto in 1901. Sir John accepted the title, but preferred not to use it. As late as 1913 he continued in business and was proud of the fact that his paving blocks formed the Long Island approaches to the Queensboro Bridge. His Edgewater neighbors knew nothing about his title.' Sir Joseph Benjamin Robinson, 2nd baronet [UK 1908] Sir Joseph was the victim of a blackmail conspiracy which was widely reported in the Press in the first half of 1930. The first report below appeared in \"The Observer\" on 27 April 1930. In subsequent reports, rather than repeating previous events, I have omitted any summary of what had gone before. 'Seldom in the history of the criminal courts of South Africa has a case produced such revolting evidence as that now occupying the attention of Mr. M. W. Bovill, the magistrate at Caledon- square Police Court. 'The persons in this remarkable case are: Arthur Wolstenholme, accountant, and Mrs. Gesuna Salmond, who are charged with attempted extortion and subornation to perjury in that they persuaded certain girls to make false statements against Sir J. B. Robinson, son of the late Sir Joseph Robinson, the South African millionaire, in order to bring a case against him demanding £10,000 damages for the alleged seduction of Mrs. Salmond's youngest daughter, [16-year- old] Hester Steenkamp [although she becomes Mrs. Salmond's sister in later reports]. The girls, it is alleged, were told that it would enable Mrs. Salmond to get half of Robinson's money.\" 'Remarkable evidence of \"Adam and Eve\" parties was given by Hester Steenkamp, who testified that three naked dances had been held at which Sir J. B. Robinson had been present. The witness showed signs of distress while relating how Sir J. B. Robinson, according to her account, had criminally assaulted her on two occasions. Further allegations against Sir J. B. Robinson were made by Irene Delaporte, aged nineteen, who described herself as a friend of Robinson. Both the accused had asked her to sign a statement which she said was a \"pack of lies.\" 'The accused were remanded till April 30, and an application for a reduction in the amount of the bail from £1,000 was refused.' London \"Daily Mail\" 12 May 1930:- 'Owing to the inability of Sir J. B. Robinson to attend in court, his evidence was taken in the ballroom at Hawthornden, the baronet's home ay Wynberg, a suburb of Capetown. Sir Joseph admitted that he had had relations with Mrs. Salmond. He said that he was \"hazy\" about the dances without clothing, of which evidence had been given at a previous hearing by Hester Steenkamp. The women, he said, were in their underclothing. He emphatically denied that he had ever misbehaved with Hester Steenkamp. He said he had lent Mrs, Salmonda motor- car and had had it registered in her name so that \"in the event of an accident the name of Robinson should not get into the Press.\" 'Sir Joseph Robinson accused Mrs. Salmond of suggesting that he should have relations with Hester Steenkamp. She told him that \"nobody would know.\" He added that the suggestions were made so that Mrs. Salmond \"could get money from me for the rest of her life.\" He admitted attending dances at Mrs. Salmond's house, Paradise Villa, but said that he drank and slept and did not take much notice of what went on there. Mrs. Salmond, he said, was a married woman whose husband was a railwayman in the Belgian Congo. He admitted that he had given £250 to get Mr. Salmond out of the country. He did this because Mrs. Salmond had told him that she felt like driving a knife into her husband's throat.' London \"Daily Mail\" 21 June 1930:- 'Arthur Wolstenholme, an accountant, and Mrs. Salmond have each been sentenced to one years' hard labour on charges of attempting to extort £10,000 from the millionaire baronet, Sir Joseph Robinson, for an alleged assault on Hester Steenkamp, Mrs. Salmond's schoolgirl sister. Notice of appeal has been given. 'In giving his verdict, behind closed doors, Mr. Bovill, the magistrate, said that he disagreed with the defending attorney's suggestion that Sir Joseph Robinson induced Mrs. Salmond to lead an immoral life and that he was entirely responsible for taking away a young woman who had prev- iously led a respectable and innocent life. \"She had already been divorced for adultery,\" said Mr. Bovill, \"and it appears that she lured Sir Joseph away.\" He went on: \"Sir Joseph has been very severely criticised by the defence, but the Crown placed no halo round his head. What has he done? He has admitted to the whole world that he has led a life of immorality, but he is very definite that he did not commit the immorality of which the young country girl Hester Steenkamp accused him. Mrs. Salmond says that Hester was only with Sir Joseph for ten minutes. It would need at least ten months to learn all the immorality contained in the girl's evidence.. The one witness who impressed me is Sir Joseph Robinson. 'I am immoral, but not so bad as they want to make me out to be,' he says. 'Mr. Bovill said he did not think that Sir Joseph had committed the alleged offence on Hester Steenkamp, and he believed that the baronet was the only person who had told the truth. In his summing-up, Mr. Bovill said that Mrs. Salmond surrounded herself with cousins, sisters, and brothers-in-law, who seemed like vultures ready to drop on this unfortunate Robinson to tear him to pieces.' Sir Boyle Roche, 1st and only baronet The following is extracted from \"An Anecdotal History of the British Parliament\" by George Henry Jennings [London 1880]:- Sir Boyle Roche, who was a member of the Irish Parliament in the period preceding the Union [Tralee 1775-1776 and 1790-1797, Gowran 1777-1783, Portarlington 1784-1790 and Old Leighlin 1798-1800], achieved renown by the remark that he could not be, \"like a bird, in two places at once.\" Some other sayings imputed to him are scarcely less celebrated. \"I would gladly, Mr. Speaker, sacrifice not only a part of the constitution, but the whole of it, to preserve the remainder.\" And again, speaking of what might be expected if the leaders of the rebellion gained sway, \"Our heads will be thrown upon that table to stare us in the face!\" To him also is ascribed that example of mixed metaphor, \"I smell a rat, Mr. Speaker; I see him floating in the air; but I will yet nip him in the bud.\" But on one occasion Sir Boyle gained the victory over [John Philpot] Curran in a contest in the Irish House. \"Do not speak of my honour,\" said Curran; \"I am the guardian of my own honour.\" \"Faith,\" replied Sir Boyle, \"I knew that at some time or other you would accept a sinecure.\" Sir John Charles Rogers, 9th baronet The following report on the inquest held after the death of Sir John appeared in 'Berrow's Worcester Journal' on 31 March 1894:- 'An inquest was held on Tuesday at Blachford, Cornwood, near Plymouth, on the body of Sir John Charles Rogers, Bart., brother of the late Lord Blachford, who was found drowned in an ornamental lake in the grounds of his residence on Tuesday. In accordance with his custom, the deceased, who was 75 years of age, started for a walk shortly before his dinner hour. As he failed to return, the butler and Colonel Lindsay, a guest, went in search of him, and late in the evening his body and walking stick were found in the lake. Dr. Rundle stated that he had attended deceased for some years for heart disease, and conjectured that he must have slipped into the pond, and that the shock caused instant death. A verdict of \"Found drowned\" was returned.' Sir James William Cecil Roll, 4th baronet From the 'Townsville Daily Bulletin' of 3 April 1939:- \"This is Jimmy Roll,\" the young Anglo-Catholic priest was saying, calling up a friend on the telephone, as I came into the room at St.James-the-Great Vicarage, Bethnal Green, writes a \"London Evening Standard\" reporter. 'Actually he is the Rev. Sir James W.C. Roll, Bart., curate of that church and grandson of a Lord Mayor of London, Sir Frederick Roll. He inherited the baronetcy last April on the death of his father, Sir Cecil, who left a fortune of £460,000 net. \"But they call me Father Roll in Bethnal Green,\" he told me, \"this being an Anglo-Catholic church. A lucky way out,\" he added, laughing. \"It would have been very awkward in this parish being called 'Sir James.' \" 'Two younger brothers shared with him their father's large fortune. They held different views on the best way to spend it. 'John and Gordon have each bought a racehorse, for 650 guineas and 50 guineas respectively, to run in the Grand National. The Rev. Sir James is giving £1,500 to start a new hostel for London's \"dead end kids.\" \"I was already a clergyman when I succeeded to the baronetcy,\" he said, \"and I intend to remain in the church. The money and title were both rather embarrassing to my career; but so far,\" he added, smiling, \"I have not had a single begging letter. As for my brothers, their giving the £1,500 for the house and the first year's running myself.\" 'Father Bright told me that the hostel will be a probation home for 12 boys, provided from the police courts.' Ian Humphrey Davy Rolleston, son and heir of Sir Humphrey Davy Rolleston, 1st and only baronet In the normal course of events, this baronetcy would not have become extinct on the death of the first baronet in 1944. The reason it did so was that Sir Humphrey's son and heir, Ian Humphrey Davy Rolleston, was killed by rioters in Zanzibar in February 1936, as is reported in the following newspaper accounts:- \"The Times\" 8 February 1936:- \"There was serious rioting in Zanzibar this morning by a mob of Arabs, who for several days have been incensed by the Government's strict application of the recent legislation to prevent the adulteration of copra. \"The scanty details received state that European officers were attacked with double-edged swords and several, including the Commissioner of Police, the Assistant District Commissioner, and the Produce Inspector, were severely injured. They attempted to deal with the mob, but were cut down. One Indian police inspector is reported to have died from his wounds. The Government immediately applied what is virtually martial law, and the streets were heavily patrolled by armed native police. The Post Office is reported to have been wrecked and its documents strewn in the roadway. \"Government Headquarters are barricaded to prevent the entry of the mob, but the commercial quarter has hitherto been untouched. It is stated that a large section of the rioters contemplated attacking the offices of a German shipping line, but that they desisted. Comparative quiet had been restored by the afternoon.\" \"The Times\" 10 February 1936:- \"Mr Ian Humphrey David Rolleston, an assistant District Commissioner in the Colonial Civil Service, and only son of Sir Humphrey Rolleston, Physician Extraordinary to the late King, has died from injuries received during the rioting in Zanzibar on Friday. The Acting Commissioner of Police, Mr Leslie Skinner, and the Produce Inspector, Mr R. Donkin, are still in a serious condition. The Acting Provincial Commissioner, Mr J.P. Jones, is also hurt. In each case the injuries were inflicted with swords. The death of an Indian police inspector is confirmed, and it is also believed that a number of native police and rioters are dead, although no figures have been announced. \"In accordance with the request of the Government, 100 armed native police with European officers have been sent from Dar-es-Salaam to help patrol the town and countryside. The Commissioner of the Tanganyika Police flew to Zanzibar yesterday morning to take charge in view of Mr Skinner's injuries and special police have been enrolled, including most of the small European community, who have been supplied with rifles. \"The prompt action of the officials has prevented the trouble from spreading, a particularly difficult task, as Zanzibar is a warren of narrow and tortuous streets. The situation is now under complete control. At no time did the police have to fire on the mob. Seventy-five rioters are imprisoned in the hold of a Government steamer. \"The disturbance is believed to have no political significance. The Arabs resented the action of the Government produce inspectors in repeatedly rejecting copra because it failed to conform with the standards of quality established by a recent decree, which is intended ultimately to benefit Arab plantation owners through the realization of better prices.\" Percy Lionel Rothband, son of Sir Henry Lesser Rothband, 1st and only baronet Sir Henry Lesser Rothband was created a baronet in 1923 \"for public services\" in relation to his role in obtaining employment for disabled soldiers and sailors. On his death in 1940 the baronetcy became extinct, since his only son had died in 1926, the inquest into his death being reported in 'The Manchester Guardian' of 23 November 1926 [edited]:- 'An inquiry was held yesterday, by the Manchester City Coroner into the death of Percy Lionel Rothband, Wyelands, St. John's Road, Buxton, whose body was found in the corridor of a train from Buxton on Saturday morning last, on its arrival at London Road Station, Manchester. The dead man had a bullet wound in his head, and an empty revolver was lying by his side. 'Leonard Mandelberg said he was a cousin of the late Mr. Rothband, and last saw him alive about 6.20 on Friday night last. His health appeared just as usual. In reply to the Coroner, the witness said he had never heard Mr. Rothband complain of loss of sleep or threaten to take his life. He further stated....that there were neither business nor domestic affairs which in the least degree had any connection with the affair. 'The Coroner then read a letter which Mr. Rothband had directed to his father (Sir Henry Lesser Rothband): \"Forgive me dearest and best of friends. I can't stand not sleeping any more. Something inside me has gone smash, and I cannot stand it any longer.\" There was, added the Coroner, some sort of legal will which bears out the relationship in the home such as the last witness has described. Had the deceased not been on the best of terms in his home life he would hardly have been so anxious to make that provision for his wife, in which he nominated her and his father as executors. The will was written in pencil and signed. 'A railway porter at London Road Station described the finding of the body on the floor of the corridor. All the other passengers had left by the door at the other end of the coach. None of them could have seen Mr. Rothband, who was obscured by the corridor door. 'Wilfred Dakin, an engine driver's fireman, stated that he came by the Buxton train and was walking along the platform at London Road Station when he saw something inside a corridor. Looking again he observed a prone body, and thinking someone might have fainted he opened the door and found the body. Turning the head he saw a revolver. 'Police Constable Barker stated that he was summoned to No. 6 platform, and on arriving at Roby Street infirmary Mr. Rothband was found to be dead. A bullet was discovered in the trousers pocket, together with letters addressed to Sir Henry Rothband. 'The Coroner, in returning a verdict of suicide whilst temporarily insane, said it was the kind of case where a person's health, probably only temporarily, had affected the mind.' The special remainder to the baronetcy of Rothschild created in 1847 From the \"London Gazette\" of 18 December 1846 (issue 20684, page 5885):- 'The Queen has been pleased to direct letters patent to be passed under the Great Seal granting the dignity of a Baronet of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland unto Anthony Rothschild, of Grosvenor-place, in the county of Middlesex, Esq. with remainder, in default of issue male, to his nephews, Nathan Meyer Rothschild, Charles Alfred Rothschild, and Leopold Rothschild, Esqrs. sons of Lionel Rothschild, Esq. brother of the said Anthony Rothschild.' Sir Charles Russell VC, 3rd baronet Russell was a Brevet Major in the 3rd Battalion, Grenadier Guards in the Crimean War, where he was awarded the Victoria Cross due to his bravery in the Battle of Inkerman on 5 November 1854. The award, which was gazetted on 24 February 1857, states that Russell \"offered to dislodge a party of Russians from the Sand-bag Battery, if anyone would follow him; Sergeant Norman, Privates Anthony Palmer and Bailey (who was killed), volunteered the first. The attack succeeded.\" During this action Sir Charles was about to be bayoneted by a Russian soldier, but the assailant was shot down by Private Anthony Palmer, thus saving Russell's life. Palmer also received the Victoria Cross. Between 1865 and 1868, Russell was MP for Berkshire, which at that time returned three members to Parliament. Since one of the other members was Robert Loyd-Lindsay (later Baron Wantage), two out of the three members were winners of the Victoria Cross. The special remainder to the baronetcy of Russell created in 1916 From the \"London Gazette\" of 26 May 1916 (issue 29596, page 5201):- 'Letters Patent have passed the Great Seal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland conferring the dignity of a Baronet of the said United Kingdom upon the Honourable Charles Russell, of Littleworth Corner, in the parish of Burnham, in the County of Buckingham, second son of Charles, Baron Russell of Killowen, Deceased, to hold to him and the heirs male of his body lawfully begotten, and in default of such issue to the heirs male of the body of the said Charles, Baron Russell of Killowen, lawfully begotten.'"
