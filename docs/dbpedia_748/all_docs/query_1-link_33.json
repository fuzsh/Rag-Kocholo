Although he wanted travel to China, his superior send him to the new continent. It was the end of XVI. He joined Admiral Atondo as a cartographer and a missioner. Once he discovered the peoples from America, he believed that his place was just there. As a goal, he wanted to stablish a mission in the \"island\" of California, but the land was so harsh.
