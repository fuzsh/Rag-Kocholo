        "meta_description": "The 78 letters collected for this definitive edition are presented in chronological order, with contextualising sections to introduce particular correspondences. The notes expand helpfully on the content of the letters in all sorts of interesting ways, from providing definitions and usage detail on the words and phrases Dryden uses, and explaining more about the particular events and people that are referred to, to guiding the reader to useful secondary materials and offering detailed and insightful analysis of how the content of the letters bears relevance to Dryden's poetry and plays, as well as the work of his contemporaries, and the times in which they were writing. Illustrations throughout the text show the reader many paintings of Dryden and his correspondents, as well as extracts of the letters themselves. The annotations to the letters, and the way the author has carried out and commented upon the transcription itself, provides a fascinating and thorough engagement with Dryden's letters and the context in which they were written.",
