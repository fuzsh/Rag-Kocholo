        "text": "The 2024 Texas Tech Real Estate Student Organization hosted their first meeting last night, and I’m pretty sure this is the best group of college students that has ever been assembled! All of them are future leaders in our industry and we have a myriad of fun activities planned for this semester! We were very lucky to follow our meeting with a discussion from one of the top retail and office brokers in Texas, who also is an incredible host for Family Feud. The graduates from Texas Tech’s Real Estate Program are special! Wreck em! Whitnie Hill, M. Ed. Jared H.\n\nFinal presentations are complete and the farewell dinner has concluded. 17 students joined me in London this summer, and it is very exciting to see all their growth. They visited multiple companies and sat in board rooms. They saw an array of high profile guest speakers, learning private equity and real estate from some of the most brilliant minds in the country. They visited culutural sites and learned how to handle themselves in proper settings. Study abroad is a vital tool to building well rounded future leaders. If any of our tales have compelled you to get involved, we are always looking for sponsors and donors for the program. Send me an email to discuss: cpankrat@ttu.edu. It is an exciting time to be at Texas Tech, Wreck ‘em!!! Texas Tech University - Rawls College of Business Texas Tech University\n\nThe Texas Tech Real Estate Students ended the last full week in another incredible board room. We were very lucky to visit a FinTech company and receive a master class on AI, Machine Learning, and jobs of the future. Our speakers were world class leaders in the technology space and we were so fortunate to learn from them. A big part of what I wanted to achieve in this trip was for students to see successful people and realize their success is possible. The more they are in board rooms in corporate settings, the more they realize it is attainable. I’m very thankful to all the companies that opened their doors to our incredible students. So many view study abroad as a vacation, in reality it came be an eye opening experience where connections are made to establish future success. After we took a development tour of the St. Pancras Station Mixed Use Project. Texas Tech University Texas Tech University - Rawls College of Business\n\nPrivate equity week continues for the Texas Tech International Real Estate Students in London! During this trip, it was important for the students to see other Red Raiders seeing incredible success, and we could not have a better example of success than Jamal Ismayilov at AnaCap. Jamal came to Tech to study Finance, and his Finance degree has allowed him opportunities in a number of high ranking posts. AnaCap is one of the top private equity firms in Europe, and Jamal gave a master class in adding value to companies, valuing companies, and determing return expectations. Having our students in their boardroom and seeing a Red Raider achieve big success was special. We could not be thankful to AnaCap and Jamal for the opportunity. The more students are in these rooms, the more they see these rooms are possible. We have a myriad of incredible students at Texas Tech, sometimes they just need exposure to see all that is possible. Texas Tech University - Rawls College of Business Texas Tech University\n\nCould not be more proud of the team at Blackacre Commercial! This transaction had tremendous complexity and required a very tailored solution for the borrower. The property was comprised of over 200 townhomes and the debt required several tiers of loans to facilitate the business strategy. Both the lender and the borrower had strong teams, allowing for a smooth close. Excited to get this closed while I'm in London!\n\nDay 2 of Private Equity Week for the Texas Tech International Real Estate Students in London! Today was special! Our class had the privilege to visit the London Office of one of the global leaders in investment, Nuveen, a TIAA company. Our two hosts included a Red Raider in Melissa St. Clair and a leader on the industrial acquisition team in James Ellis (MRICS). Melissa had an incredible story of going to Texas Tech, being inspired by the great Jeffrey Harper, moving to New York without a plan and growing into an incredible executive. She was inspiring, gracious, and a great ambassador in London for Texas Tech. James walked us through the various European Markets he overseas, what factors he looks for in industrial property, and his road from Reading University to Dubai to being on the acquisition side for a worldwide firm. From ceiling heights to dock doors to turning radius, it was a master class in industrial real estate. Today was an incredible opportunity for our students, and we are deeply appreciative to Melissa for making it happen. Texas Tech University - Rawls College of Business Texas Tech University\n\nWe have entered private equity week for the Texas Tech International Real Estate Students studying in London! Today was special! We were honored to be joined in class today by Kerim Derhalli. From his tenure as former head of global equities at Deutsche Bank, experience at numerous firms in emerging markets and the Fintech company he is building at Invstr, we were all treated to a masterclass in building businesses and advancing to the C Suite. He was the first person I called when building my curriculum this year, and the cornerstone of the experience I am building with the program. He spoke 30 minutes more than expected and the questions from students kept coming. We all walked away ready to take on the world!! Could not be more thankful to give my students this opportunity!! To celebrate a great day, we visited the Tower of London. Texas Tech University Texas Tech University - Rawls College of Business\n\nIt is haggis time for the Texas Tech International Real Estate Students! We just arrived in Edinburgh Scotland and are very excited to study the architecture and culture. Very fun case study in integrating new styles with old. Can’t wait to see the students get better these next few days. Wreck em! Texas Tech University - Rawls College of Business Texas Tech University\n\nBig day for the Texas Tech International Real Estate Students in London! Today, we were graciously hosted by the Bayes Business School, as we received a lecture on UK Capital Markets from a tremendous real estate professor in Christopher Bourn. Professor Bourn walked us through current UK cap rates, Debt Markets, and underwriting. It was an academic setting the students won’t forget. I could not be more thankful for the hospitality we received, and I hope this builds an exciting bridge between the Bayes Business School and Rawls College of Business! Texas Tech University Texas Tech University - Rawls College of Business\n\nAnother day in London, another special opportunity for the Texas Tech International Real Estate Students in London! We were very fortunate to learn about local and national UK Politics with an incredible leader, Cllr. Stephan Fifield. Stephan is a Councillor on the Gloucestershire County Council and a Cabinet Member for Adult Social Care. He was a wealth of knowledge on topics including: Zoning Issues, Elections, Adult Social Care, and Leadership. He was only supposed to speak for an hour, but the questions kept coming. We are very fortunate for his time, we all got better today! Texas Tech University Texas Tech University - Rawls College of Business"
