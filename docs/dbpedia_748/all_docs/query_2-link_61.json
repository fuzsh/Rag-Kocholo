She was buried at Hampsthwaite on 14th October.William Grange author of The History and Topography of Harrogate and the Forest of Knaresborough published in 1871 wrote of Peter: “Passing up the village street, is the cottage of Peter Barker, the blind joiner, a most extraordinary man, who can make almost anything which is made of wood and that in a workmanlike manner. He was born in 1808, and lost his sight when about four years old, by an inflammation of the eyes; since then he has been “. . . . . dark, amid the blaze of noon irrecoverable dark; total eclipse without all hope of day” Though deprived of sight, the spirit of enterprise was strong within him; he joined in the games and plays of older boys with confidence and skill equal to their own, and was, not infrequently, a contriver and ringleader in their petty mischievous pranks. If any one played a practical joke upon the blind boy, he was pretty certain, before long, to have it returned in kind. Having an ear for music, he became a performer on the violin, and, as he grew to manhood, frequented dances and merry-makings all round the country, as a performer on his instrument. From frequenting these jovial assemblies he began to have a love for strong drink, but his moral nature was too strong to be overcome by these temptations. He suddenly formed a determination to abandon the musical profession, as well as the companions with which it had brought him in contact, and beg his bread rather than obtain it in such a manner. The idea entered his mind that he would be a joiner, and he fell to work as a chair maker, succeeding at the first attempt, and since then has followed the occupation of a joiner. He served no apprenticeship, received no instructions or ideas from others, and yet he says, he can make anything that is made of wood, from stackbar up to chest of drawers. The only peculiarity observable in any of his tools is in his foot rule with which he makes his measurements, the lines on which are marked by small pins, in different numbers, at different lengths on his rule. Like all enterprising men of the world, Peter Barker married a wife, by whom he had a son, who was the constant companion of his father, and, to his bitter sorrow, died January 19th, 1863, at the age of seventeen years. His wife died June 3rd, 1862, so he is a widower, and an aged relative superintends his domestic affairs. He is tall and athletic in person; ready and quick in conversation; plain straightforward, and honest in the account he gives of himself and his performances. He assumes no superiority over ordinary men on account of the abilities he possesses, but says it was Providence which gave him his talents, and the same Providence has supported him through life. He is held in high estimation by all his neighbours, and, without considering his situation, he appears as happy, cheerful, and comfortable, as any man we ever met with.” Harry Speight author of Nidderdale published in 1906 also included a piece about Peter Barker in his book, Chapter XXVII Hampsthwaite which reads: “But the village smith and the carpenter are survivals from early times, and to this category belongs Peter Barker, who was well known beyond the limits of his native dale as the “blind joiner of Hampsthwaite.” He died in 1873, aged 64, and a neat headstone, raised by his friends, commemorates him in these words: “Though blind from infancy he was skilful as a cabinet maker, a glazier, and a musician, by the sense of touch he searched the scriptures daily. “Jesus took the blind man by the hand. Whereas I was blind I now see.” Barker, it appears, lost his sight from an inflammation when a child, but as he grew up he joined in pranks with other boys and rarely, it is said, met with any mishap. He was taught to play on the violin by a professional named Thorpe, then living at Wreaks, and made such proficiency that he was able in a short while to earn sometimes as much as 10s. a night by fiddling at local feasts and other celebrations. After a little practice, he took to cabinet making as a regular calling, and could make chairs and chests, and in fact almost any article of wood, coffins even not excepted, as well as any man. His measurements were always exact, and his work invariably well fitted and finished. The foot-rule he used was studded with short pins placed at the inch and half-inch, and in numbers to correspond with the measurements. His mechanical gifts were indeed of a very varied character, and I am told he could make the church clock go when no one else could. He used to go to church with a lantern on winter nights to ring the eight o’clock bell (a long-practiced custom at Hampsthwaite, and a relic of the old Forest laws) and the village folk would say, as they spied him trudging along with his lantern, “Here comes blind Peter.” He could find his way about the village unaided, and the same when he went to Knaresborough by rail, the many tortuous and intricate thoroughfares in that old town seeming no impediment to his progress\". Peter’s life was recorded in 1868 whilst alive in a booklet, \"Memoir of the life of Peter Barker, the blind joiner of Hampsthwaite\". After his death in 1873, the booklet was reprinted. In May 1973, the centenary year of Peter’s death, the Yorkshire Life magazine published an article on Blind Peter of Hampsthwaite.Gen 2Gen 3Gen 4Gen 5Gen 6Gen 7Gen 8Gen 9Ralph BARKERBaptised at Hampsthwaite on 24th December 1768.
