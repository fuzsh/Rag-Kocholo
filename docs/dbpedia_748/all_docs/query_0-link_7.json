His parents were John Gage and Penelope Darcy.\n\nThe estimated birth year for John relies heavily on the date of birth for elder brother Thomas. In his father's inquisition post mortem (Chancery copy), dated 16 January 1633/34, Thomas Gage, eldest son and heir, was stated to be aged 14 years 6 weeks when his father died on 4 October 1633.[1] Thus Thomas was born in August 1619 (between 19 August 1619 and 27 August 1619). The inquisition post mortem kept at the Court of Wards also states that Thomas was aged 14.[2]\n\nFurther confirmation of this birth date is provided by the fact that Thomas was baptised at St James Clerkenwell, Middlesex (where the Gages had a house)[3] on 28 August 1619:[4][5]\n\n\"[August 1619] Thomas Sonne to John Gage of Farl: Esqz. was [christ]ned the same daye [the 28th]\"\n\nThat Thomas was the eldest son and underage in 1633 is confirmed in a codicil to the will of his father, John:[3]\n\n\"...should have the wardshipp of my sonne and heire Thomas Gage if I should dye before hee come vnto the age of One and twentie yeares\"\n\nAs John Gage is the second son,[3] he cannot have been born prior to late 1620.\n\nAn upper bound on John's year of birth is provided by a draft re-settlement dated 9 February 1624/5. In this document, his father lists sons Thomas and John (but not Edward), before going on to list more distant male heirs, right back to descendants of his great-grandfather Sir John Gage.[6]\n\nThis John Gage was born sometime between late 1620 and very early 1625; averaging suggests a birth year of about 1622.\n\nIn 1633, John's father died. He was named as second son in his father's will and left a sum of 1250 pounds:[3]\n\n\"...my second sonne John Gage shall have the some of twelve hundred and fiftie pounds paid vnto him\"\n\nOn 4 December 1640, John was indicted with his mother and sister, Anne, for recusancy at the Middlesex Sessions, having not attended church for at least a month.[7] To be charged, he must have been at least 16 years of age. Given that his mother had been indicted (without John) earlier that same year,[7] it could be that he had only just turned 16, which would suggest he was born in about 1624. All three were described as being of St James Clerkenwell, Middlesex.[7]\n\nHis elder brother, Thomas Gage, died in 1654, leaving John a legacy of 20 pounds:[8]\n\nI doe likewise give & bequeath to my three brothers John Edward and Henry Gage and to my foure sisters the Lady Frances Tresham the Lady Elizabeth Peter Mrs Penelope Merrey & Mrs Anne Peter widd twenty pounds a peece\n\nMarriage\n\nJohn married Mary Barker, daughter of John Barker, of the parish of St Dunstans in the West in the City of London.[9] Her father was a member of the Chapman alias Barker family of Sibton, Suffolk.[9]\n\nTheir marriage took place during the Commonwealth period of government. In 1653, legislation was enacted which removed the right to perform marriages from ministers of the Church of England, placing this responsibility in the hands of Justices of the Peace. Notice of intention to marry had to be published three times over several weeks in either a church/chapel or local marketplace. This enabled any objections to be raised, prior to the marriage taking place.[10]\n\nJohn and Mary chose to give notice of their intention to marry in the nearby Newgate Marketplace, rather than the church of St Dunstans in the West (Mary's home parish). This is consistent with John Gage being Catholic and therefore lacking a strong connection with the established church. The intention to marry was published on 21 & 26 February and 7 March 1654/5:[11]\n\nAccording to a late Act of Parlent touching marriages &c publicacion of an intencion of marriage between John Gage Esq sonne of Sr John Gage of Firll in ye County of Susex Barronett, and Mris Mary Barker daughter of John Barker gent deceased late of the parish of Dunstans in the West London aged 23 yeares or there aboutes hathben made in the markett place commonly called newgate markett upon three markett dayes in three severall weeks vizt upon the 21th & 26th of February 1654 and the 7th of March 1654 in which tyme there was no excepcion made against the said intended marriage. Jo: Benson Register.\n\nThere being no impediments, their marriage was solemnised two months later, on 9 May 1655:[12]\n\nBe it remembred that according to a late Act of Parliament touching Marriages &c the aforenamed John Gage Esq and Mary Barker were uppon the ninth day of May one thousand six hundred Fyftie & five marryed before the Right Honble Christopher Pack Ye Maior of the City of London before divers credible wittnesses.\n\nOfficiating at their marriage was Christopher Packe, Lord Mayor of London, an apparent reflection of the couple's high social status. Most other marriages in the register were officiated by a Justice of the Peace.\n\nAbout a month later, on 12 and 13 June 1655, their marriage settlement was signed.[13]\n\nDeath of Mother\n\nHe was named in his mother's will, dated 30 August 1656, in which she confirmed existing settlements raising her third son up by settling Hengrave on Edward over her second son John (and youngest son Henry). Penelope justifies this, stating that she has made sufficient provisions for her other sons:[14]\n\nAnd haveinge made convenient provisions for maintenance to my two other sonnes John and Henry\n\nIn a codicil to her will, dated 19 May 1660, Penelope provides further details of these \"convenient provisions\", confirming her previous settlement of property on John. Namely, the Manors of Stonham in Suffolk and Boters/Butters in Norfolk, as well as land in Coddenham and adjacent towns in Suffolk:[14]\n\nInprimis. The Mannor of Stonham in the County of Suffolke which I purchased of Mr Gooden in S[i]r William Herveys name, the Mannor of Boters which I purchased of Mr Page, Mr Wallpoole and others in Mr Le Hunts name, certaine Lands lying in Codnam and other adjacent Townes in the County of Suffolke which I purchased of Mr Meadows formerly conveyed to Sir Herbottle Grinston, all these aforesaid Lands I confirme vnto my son John Gage as they be allready settled on him, as by the deeds and writtings concerning the same doe and may more att large appeare.\n\nShe further states that these lands had been purchased (at least in part) using legacies from John's father and grandmother, as well as from his wife's marriage portion:[14]\n\nItem I further declare that my sons porc[i]ons which there Father and Grandmother leff them and theere wives porc[i]ons whent towards the purchasing of these Lands\n\nPenelope also granted 50 pounds to each of her surviving children (except heir Edward) to buy something to remember her by:[14]\n\nItem I give to my daughter Tresham my daughter Merry and my daughter Anne Peter my son John Gage and my son Henry Gage Fifty pounds a peece to buy them somthing to keepe as a memory of me these moneyes to be payd within a yeere after my decease.\n\nFinally, she disposed of her house in Bury to John and four of his siblings as follows:[14]\n\nItem my house at Bury with the furniture in itt I give to my five Children that is to say Francis Tresham, Anne Peter John Gage, Edward Gage and Henry Gage to be divided as a writting vnder my hand shall give direc[i]on: I am sorry itt is noe better but I leave itt them that they may not want a present habitac[i]on, and I doe desire all persons whose names are vsed in any assurance concerning the said house to stand sealed to the vse of my five Children.\n\nHis mother, Penelope Hervey, died sometime between 19 May 1660 (when she made her codicil)[14] and 25 April 1661 (when an inventory of her goods was taken).[15]\n\nTurk's Head Case\n\nJohn's wife, Mary, and her sisters were proprietors of a property called the Turk's Head in Fleet Street in the parish of St Dunstan in the West, which had previously been owned by their maternal grandfather, Thomas Albery.[16]\n\nOn 8 August 1666, the Turk's Head was leased to William Lee, a stationer, for 26 and a quarter years. Lee was to pay 40 pounds per annum for this lease.[17]\n\nJust a month later, the Great Fire of London destroyed much of the city, including the Turk's Head. William Lee, wanting to rebuild, petitioned the Court of Judicature Appointed to Determine Differences between Landlords and Tenants as to Rebuilding after the Great Fire, commonly known as the \"Fire Court\" to get the Barker sisters, their husbands and heirs to contribute to the rebuild.[17]\n\nJohn Gage was one of the defendants when the case was heard on 30 June 1668, before the Lord Chief Justice and two other judges:[17]\n\nWilliam Lee, stationer v. William Harpham, gent., and Barbara his wife, Elizabeth Barker, Frances Barker, John Gage, gent., and Mary his wife, and William Turnor, gent., an infant.\n\nLord of Butters Hall Manor\n\nThe manor of Butters Hall in Thompson, Norfolk, was settled on John by his mother Penelope, which settlement was confirmed in her will.[14] Ownership was in the name of William Le Hunt, Esq,[14] which was likely a mechanism to prevent the manor or its profits being seised for Penelope's (or John's) recusancy. Le Hunt continued to act as Lord of the Manor on John's behalf after Penelope's death,[18] perhaps until as late as 1672 when John Gage first held court as lord (translated from Latin):[19]\n\nThe first general Court Baron of John Gage, esquire, with the attornment of the tenants, held there the twenty-second day of July in the twenty-fourth year of the reign of the lord Charles the Second, by the grace of God of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, king, defender of the faith etc. in the year of Our Lord 1672, by John Borret, gentleman, steward there\n\nAll of John's Suffolk properties were within five miles of each other, whereas Butters Hall in Thompson was 30 miles distant. Perhaps a desire to consolidate his country property in one location led John to sell his more distant manor. Whatever the reason, in 1673, he transferred the manor of Butters Hall to Thomas Grundy:[20]\n\nAppointment by John Gage, esq., of Camberwell (Surrey) of John Gawdy gent., Edward Gleast, gent., and John and Richard Barker to deliver seisin to Thomas Grundy, gent., of the manor of Butters otherwise Boters in Thompson, Merton, Stow Bedon, Caston, Tottington and Breckles\n\nPossible Stay at Hengrave\n\nIn a postscript to an undated letter, likely written in the 1670s, John's brother Sir Edward Gage asks Thomas Halsall to:[21]\n\n\"remember me to my Bro[ther] & will Gage, I beleeve my daughters & mr Sulyard will be gone from Hengrave before you receave this & so I say nothing to them.\"\n\nFrancis Young suggests that the brother staying at Hengrave to whom Edward sends his regards is \"probably John Gage of Stonham\",[21] although it could also be younger brother Henry Gage of Harleston.\n\nWill of Brother Henry\n\nJohn's youngest brother Henry wrote his will on 18 January 1683/4, in which he stated:[22]\n\nI give and bequeath vnto my Loveing Brother John Gage the summe of one hundred pounds for his owne proper vse Item I give to my brother John Gage the summe of Two hundred pounds more together with my Silver Watch to bee disposed of by him in such manner as I have given him particular direc[i]on\n\nPatron of the Rector of Stonham Parva\n\nJohn retained his links with Stonham Parva (Little Stonham) in Suffolk until his death. He was recorded as the patron of Charles Woodell, when he was instituted as Rector of Stonham Parva on 19 December 1687.[23]\n\nDeath and Legacy\n\nHe wrote his will on 17 July 1682. He left his estate to his brother Henry and then to his nephew John, son of Henry. This included property in the parishes of Coddenham, Needham, Barking and Darmsden in Suffolk. His executor was Edward Gleast. The will was proved in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury on 27 April 1688.[24]\n\nJohn, the nephew, died in 1723 without surviving issue and left his estate in Coddenham, known as Pipps and inherited from his uncle John, to his cousin Sir William Gage, Bt.[25]\n\nJohn Gage died sometime between 19 December 1687[23] and 27 April 1688.[24] His funeral achievement bore the arms of Gage, impaling per chevron Argent and Gules, a crescent counter-charged[13] (ie impaling the arms of his wife's family, Chapman alias Barker).[26]\n\nReligion\n\nThe Gage family were staunch Catholics. Writing in 2015, historian Francis Young describes them thus:[27]\n\n\"Between 1662, when Sir Edward Gage received his baronetcy from Charles II, and 1872 when the ninth and last baronet died without an heir, the Gage family were the socially and financially pre-eminent Catholics in the county of Suffolk.\"\n\nThe threat of being charged with recusancy (failure to attend Church of England services) or other religious offences was a constant concern for Catholics and other non-conformists in Stuart England. Conviction could lead to significant fines and forfeiture of property.\n\nJohn's name appears in a list of \"Popish Recusants in Suffolk\", which was compiled sometime between 1665 and 1685[28] (Francis Young suggests 1681).[29] He is described as being a gentleman, of Stonham. Brothers Edward and Henry are in the same list.[28]\n\nIn the Sessions of Newgate Gaol Delivery at the Old Bailey, starting 17 October 1681, John Gage Esq. was indicted for recusancy, along with 12 others:[30]\n\n...Henry Nevill Esq. late of the parish of St Andrew Holborn in the ward of Farringdon Without, London ... [five more names] ... John Gage Esq. late of the parish and ward aforesaid ... [six more names]\n\nAfter failing to appear at the next Sessions beginning 7 December 1681, John Gage and his co-accused were found to be in default and convicted. This failure to appear was usual for those accused of recusancy and indicates that those charged accepted the facts of the indictment against them.[31]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nNOTE: John Gage, son of Penelope Darcy and Sir John Gage of Firle, did not immigrate to Massachusetts. To see the profile of the John Gage who married Amee French, see John Gage-159.\n\nDr. Francis Young, British researcher and author, has studied and written extensively about the Gage Family. He recently published a full volume on the Gage family. See his webblog here: https://francisyoung.wordpress.com/2015/06/18/publication-of-the-gages-of-hengrave-and-suffolk-catholicism-1640-1767/\n\nHe is probably the John Gage, gentleman, of St Martin's in the Fields, who was charged alongside Sir Edward Gage with not attending church, on 23 December 1680.[32]\n\nOrigin of Conflation with John Gage of New England\n\nThe John Gage of this profile is frequently identified as being the same person as John Gage (c1605-1673), immigrant to New England. This conflation first appears in pedigrees published in the United States around 1880.\n\nThe information that John Gage, immigrant, was the same as John Gage, second son of John Gage, Baronet, was provided by genealogist Horatio Gates Somerby (1805-1872).\n\nIn History of Dover, New Hampshire, Vol. 1., published in 1923, some details of the English ancestry of the Gage family are published from \"Memoranda No. 231\". This memorandum starts:[33]\n\n\"Joseph Gage was son of Moses Gage who lived at Dover Neck, and was brother of CAPT. JOHN GAGE , and to Jonathan, of the Dover Hotel. Of his ancestry we give the following account, which we insert in the language of John Paul Robinson, Esq. He says:\n\nThe family of Gage derives its descent from De Guaga, who accompanied William, the Conqueror, into England...\"\n\nAfter narrating some more early details of the family, Robinson continues:[33]\n\n\"This John Gage married Penelope , daughter and co-heir of Thomas Darcey, Earl Rivers. She was the widow of Sir George Trenchard, by whom she had four sons and five daughters. He died Oct. 3, 1633. His estate descended to his eldest son, Sir Thomas Gage. His second son, JOHN GAGE, of Stoneham, County Essex, came to America with John WINTHROP, JR., in 1633, and they, with ten others, were the first settlers of Ipswich. In June, 1658, his wife, Ann, died at Ipswich. He married (2) a Keyes. He removed to Rowley as early as 1664. He had by his first wife: Benjamin, Samuel, Daniel, Jonathan and Thomas.\n\nMr. Robinson received the above account from Mr. Somerby, who obtained it from Lord Gage, in England.\"\n\nJohn Paul Robinson, Esq. (1800-1864), was a lawyer from Dover, New Hampshire. So Somerby's research must have been conducted between about 1840, when he moved to England, and 1864, when Robinson died.\n\nIt has been found that Somerby fabricated some of his genealogical research, thus his claim that his information was provided by Lord Gage cannot be taken at face value. Despite there being numerous published pedigrees of the Gage family prior to 1840, none of these even hint that John Gage, second son of John Gage, Baronet, immigrated to New England.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Sussex Record Society vol. 14: \"Notes of post mortem inquisitions taken in Sussex. 1 Henry VII, to 1649 and after\" (London: The Society, 1912) (p. 99 no. 453); Internet Archive (https://archive.org : accessed 23 August 2020).\n\n↑ H.W.
