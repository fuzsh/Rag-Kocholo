        "text": "5. JSB CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN\n\nIn 1841, after John’s father (Joseph Leavens), died in what appears to be an unexpected death while in the prime of his life, John’s mother, Harriet White Barker became a single mom, caring for their four young children. She remained a widow for a couple of years and then married Thomas Donnelly on August 31, 1843, a man who, from all comments I have read, was a good father to the young family. Thomas was born on August 16, 1815, in Manchester, England. He was evidently a devout Christian and left a long poem he wrote himself about his love of the Bible, which was read at his funeral service.\n\nJSB “was brought up to mercantile business by his cousin, David Barker Stevenson, J.P. and M.P.P. for Prince Edward County, Canada.” He evidently experienced “feeble health” so he “entered into no permanent business but became an entertainer of friends and a helper in word and deed to those about him.” He also became the first president of Prince Edward County Historical Society, instituted in 1899.\n\nOn Oct. 28, 1857, JSB married Elizabeth Emma Aishton, the oldest child (of ten children) of Dr. Thomas Aishton, M.D. (b. Sept. 21, 1808 in Davenport-Reg. Stoke Dameral, Deware, England, d. Dec. 4, 1877 at Bath, Ont. at Woodcot, residence of his son-in-law, John S. Barker) and Sarah Aurelia Fairfield (b. Feb. 19, 1814, at Earnestown, Ont., as follows: Elizabeth Emma (b. October 6, 1836, at Bath, Ontario); Mercy Maria (b. July 23, 1840, at Bath) m. Robert McCoy (b.? d. Feb. 18, 1894 at Napanee), Oct. 3, 1859; Samuel Clark (b. June 29, 1838 at Wilton, d. Sept. 14, 1881, buried at Bath) m. Maria Cruper (?); Martha Ann (b. June 23, 1842 at Wilton, d. Aug. 2, 1842, buried at Wilton); John McLean (b. April 16, 1844, at Fredericksburg) m. Mary McKenzie, Fredericksburg); Thomas Diamond (b. June 14, 1846, at Wilton), m. Hattie Brainard, Jan. 18, 1872 at Rome, N.Y.); Ira Ham (b. December 26, 1848, at Wilton, d. Oct. 18, 1870 at Picton, at res. of J.S Barker); Richard Millward (b. June 15, 1851, at Bath, d. Aug. 1855 at Bath); George Frederick (b. June 4, 1853, at Bath, d.?) m. Jennie Costello June 10, 1880, at Rochester, N.Y.; and Sarah Agnes (b. June 21, 1856 at Bath, d. Feb. 9, 1891 at New Westminster, B.C., 34 yrs. old), m. Wellington Snider, Sept. 16, 1881 at Rochester, N.Y. by Rev. Edwin Brown. Sarah left three young daughters: Mabel Grace Snider (b. Aug. 10, 1882), Violet Gladys Snider (b. Oct. 20, 1885) and Gertrude Frances Snider (b. Nov. 11, 1887).\n\nJohn Stevenson Barkerand Elizabeth Emma Aishton Barker became the parents of four children, as follows: Harriet Barker (b. Oct. 2, 1858, at Bath), Mary Ann Barker (b. Sept. 26, 1860 at Hallowell),Joseph Aishton Barker (b. July 4, 1866 at Picton), Lillian Emma May Barker (b. Nov. 4, 1872, at Picton) and Lenore Ira Barker (b. Oct. 20, 1879, at Picton.)\n\nIn my possession is a letter written from Lenore Ira Barker Ivey, JSB’s youngest daughter, written in 1960 to my mother, Ethel Emma Barker Haney, the youngest daughter of Joseph Aishton Barker, only son of JSB. My parents, Ethel and Bill Haney, had visited Lenore in Tampa, Florida (her home for many years) and she had replied to them after they sent her some mementos they’d acquired when visiting Picton after they visited her, while flying in a private plane belonging to another couple, their close friends, whose plane in which they travelled. In Lenore’s letter I discovered some added information about my great-grandfather, John Stevenson Barker, such as the following: “Such a box of nice souvenirs arrived, yesterday! You cannot imagine how much pleasure they gave me, especially with so many reminders of my home town and vicinity. I was especially glad to see the Picton Gazette, which was once owned and edited by Grandfather Donnelly, who married Grandmother Barker, when she was a young widow, with four children, of whom my father (JSB) was the oldest. He” (Grandpa Donnelly) “died though, before I was born, as did Grandfather Aishton, also, but Grandmother Aishton spent her summers with us, for years, and died there” (in Picton) “and is buried in the old Churchyard, beside Uncle Ira.” . . . “The foundry was owned by David Barker, a second cousin of father’s. Father worked in different offices, the Registry Office, with his friend Col. Bog, for a long time, for several lawyers and his special friend and chum, Judge Merrill, on whose sailing yacht, he died, on July 11, 1901, while they were on one of their many and well loved cruises, on our beautiful Bay of Quinte. That was a sad day, but had he been able to choose his place of death, it might very well have been there, as he loved it so. . . . I hope you got a good look at the bay and land-locked harbor. So beautiful and dear to me! . . . Our best love to all of you. Very fondly, Aunt Lenore.”\n\nI feel blessed to have this letter from my mother’s aunt. Lenore visited in Great Falls, Montana in the late 1930s. Among family albums are a few photos of her visit.\n\nTo bring JSB’s family into the next couple of generations, I offer the following information:\n\nOn July 4, 1892, JSB’s son, Joseph Aishton Barker (b. July 4, 1866, in Picton, Ontario) married Louisa Katrina Charlotta Overman (b. November 21, 1866, in Westphalia, Germany) in Great Falls, Montana. This community was founded in 1883 by Paris Gibson and become incorporated in 1888, so at the time of their marriage, it was a young and growing community. They returned to live in Dupuyer, a much smaller Montana community, for three or four more years. Dupuyer is a small ranching community located near Choteau, that lies northwest of Great Falls in central Montana. My grandparents managed the hotel in Dupuyer (which is no longer there), and on July 11, 1893, their first daughter was born, Minnie Albertine. Hattie Lenore, their second daughter, was born December 30, 1894, but I’m not sure where. According to Louisa’a 1950 obituary, the small family spent a year in Picton following the time they lived in Dupuyer, then moved to Great Falls, shortly before, or in, 1896, since Joseph is listed in the City Directory of that year. That same year their only son, Joseph John Barker, was stillborn, sometime in February 1896.\n\nJoseph worked as a clerk for E.R. Molt and they lived on the west side of the Missouri River in 1896. Two rivers, the Missouri and the Sun, flow through the city with the Sun emptying into the Missouri River, effectively partitioning off the main portion of the community with the smaller area on the west side. By 1899, Joseph was a driver for Montana laundry, and the Barker family had moved into another rented home where their third daughter, Irene Gwyneth, was born on August 5, 1899. By 1900, Joseph was working in a warehouse at the B. and M. Company. (The “B” stood for Boston.) In 1903, the family moved again within the city, into another rented home. By then, Joe Barker (as he was called) was working in the lab at the B. and M. Smelter. In the 1906-07 City Directory, my grandparents’ residence is listed as 821 7th Avenue North, a home they purchased in 1906 and lived in for the rest of their lives. This Victorian-style home, originally built in 1885 (and added onto and remodeled) is still, remarkably, in our family’s possession in 2013. It is now 128 years old. Little did Joe and Louisa Barker know that someday, their great-granddaughter, Janis Collins, would be living in their home! For a few years, their g-g-grandson lived there as well.\n\nBy 1906, Grandpa Joe was working in the circulation department at the Great Falls Tribune, and eventually became manager of that department – a position he held for the rest of his life. On October 2, 1907, my mother, Ethel Emma, was born in their new home. Louisa, my beloved Gram Barker (who died when I was barely 13) had all her babies at home, and was never a hospital patient in her entire life. She died in the same room (and bed) that Mom was born in.\n\nIn the December 31, 1922 Tribune is an article about Joseph Barker, stating that Joseph had been connected with the Anaconda Copper Mining Company’s smelter, the Great Northern railway and The Tribune, all before holding his first position as a public official, which was that of receiver of the United States land office in Great Falls. He held this position for four years, retiring with the change of the national administration following the 1920 election.\n\nBy 1928, Joseph had become the Chairman of the County Commissioners at the Court House, located in Great Falls. He had been elected to this political position as a Democrat and held it until the day he died, on Nov. 30, 1928, of heart problems. His daughter, Irene, died (married, but without children) four months later and Gram lived on until Oct. 5, 1950. My parents (Bill and Ethel Haney) and my older brother, Bill, had moved in with Gram in 1945, and my mother continued to live in the house after my dad died, in 1970, until 1998 when her granddaughter, my youngest daughter, moved in. Mom (Ethel Emma) died Dec. 26, 2000. Before his death in 1970, my father had held the same position as Circulation Manager of the Great Falls Tribune that Joseph Aishton Barker had once held.\n\nI will end this narrative by providing a quick run-down of the children from the marriage of Joseph Aishton Barker and Louisa Katrina Overman, as follows:\n\nMinnie Albertine Barker (b. July 11, 1893, d. May 23, 1991), married Benjamin William Fulton on September 6, 1914. They had three children: Lois (step-daughter to Minnie), Benjamin Thomas Fulton and Louisa Maxine Fulton.\n\nHattie Lenore Barker (b. Dec. 30, 1894, d. Jan. 23, 1889) married Elmer Walton (Doc) Kirk on May 15, 1920. They had one son, Elmer Walton Kirk, Jr.\n\nIrene Gwyneth Barker (b. August 5, 1899, d. April 5, 1929) married Walter Weir on July 27, 1925. They had no children.\n\nEthel Emma Barker (b. Oct. 2, 1907, d. Dec. 26, 2000) married William Reid Haney (b. April 5, 1906) on June 8, 1930. They had two children: William Reid Haney, Jr. (b. April 23, 1933) and Yours Truly, Carol Irene Haney (b. Oct. 2, 1937. I find it interesting that within this narrative, three of us share the birth day of Oct. 2, i.e. Harriet White, my mom and me. My husband, Gerald Collins, had one sister, Yvonne, who also shared it, adding to the coincidence.\n\nThe subject of Numerology has always intrigued me, along with other unconventional subjects. I wonder now, does this come, perhaps, from my great-grandfather’s DNA? One of my fondest belongings that I’ve inherited from JSB is a frail and yellowed pamphlet that was his, presented in writing by his good friend, Judge Merrill, in Dec. 1899, the man on whose boat he sailed the day he died, in 1901. It is called THE SERMON and offers a varied selection of topics that include Telepathy, Clairvoyance and other Psychic Phenomena, a magazine “devoted to the New Theology & Psychic Research.” I particularly like to think that JSB and I share the capacity for curiosity and exploration, plus an open-minded tolerance in terms of beliefs and the willingness to ask questions, rather than blindly accept what others may believe. I also love the idea of having ancestors whose faith was strong in their lives, be it the Quaker faith, Anglican or whatever.\n\nThe fact that JSB was also an active Mason (he became a member in 1860) is significant to me, for many members of my parents’ family, on both sides, were active in the Masonic Order in some way or another, including the Scottish Rite or Eastern Star. My brother, Bill, was active in the DeMolay and I, in Job’s Daughters, when we were teens. I have the beaver top hat JSB wore to Masonic meetings, and elsewhere, and many Masonic items used in their ritualistic meetings, inherited from my dad and other Haney relatives. The pervasive strain of Masonry within the Barker and Haney families speaks to our tendency to be “free thinkers,” a trait that has always been of extreme importance to me. So is the quest for peace and justice, a quality strongly nurtured by the Society of Friends, a faith that was much more prevalent in the lives of my Barker ancestors than I realized before delving into genealogical discovery. In learning about my ancestors, I feel a combination of welcome and acceptance, as if I am “understood” and accepted. That’s a great feeling! The circle of life keeps expanding to make room for all of us in our increasingly inclusive diversity."
