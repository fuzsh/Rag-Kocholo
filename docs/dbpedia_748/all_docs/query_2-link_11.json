        "text": "Barker History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland-Alt\n\nEngland\n\nIreland\n\nScotland\n\nThe saga of the name Barker follows a line reaching back through history to the days of the Anglo-Saxon tribes in Britain. It was a name for someone who worked as a person who stripped trees of bark for tanning. \"It is confined to the northern half of England and to the eastern counties north of the Thames. It is very frequent in Yorkshire, and is also well represented in the counties of Derby, Lincoln, and Norfolk.\" 1\n\nThe name evolved from \"from the trade or occupation of 'barker,' an obsolete name for the bark-stripper or rather for the man who prepared the bark for the tanner. Later the word was synonymous with 'tanner.' \" 2\n\n\"A tanner, from his using bark of trees in his trade. In the old ballad of the King and the Tanner in Percy's Reliques, the latter calls himself \"a Barker, Sir, by my trade.\" English Sum. Barcarius and Le Barkere.\" 3\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Barker family\n\nThe surname Barker was first found in Yorkshire where Ralph Berker was a Knights Templar in 1185. A few years later, Aluredus le berkier was found the in the Pipe Rolls for Lincolnshire in 1193. Later again, John le Bercher was recorded in the Curia Regis Rolls for Hampshire in 1212. Jordan le Barker was found in the Assize Rolls for Essex in 1255 and John le Barker was listed in the Assize Rolls for Cambridgeshire in 1260. 4 The previous entries that include \"le\", meaning \"the\", point the the occupational nature of the name as by example, \"John the Barker.\"\n\nAnother source notes, Alan le Barkere who was listed there in the Hundredorum Rolls of 1273. The same rolls listed Robert Barcarius in Lincolnshire. 5\n\nEarly records in Scotland include: \"Patrick Bercar and his son [who] held land in Dunipace c. 1200. Alisaundre le Barker, provost of the burgh of Haddington, rendered homage in 1296 [to King Edward I of England]. Richard le Barker of Tyningham, tenant of the bishop of St. Andrews in the county of Edneburk also rendered homage in the same year. Thomas Barkar in the parish of Fyvy was excommunicated in 1382, William Barcar held a land in Edinburgh in 1400, and Alexander Barcare was vicar of the parish of Pettinain in 1486.\" 2\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Barker family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Barker research.

In droves people migrated to the many British colonies, those in North America in particular, paying high rates for passages in cramped, unsafe ships. Although many of the settlers did not make the long passage alive, those who did see the shores of North America perceived great opportunities before them. Many of the families that came from England went on to make essential contributions to the emerging nations of Canada and the United States. Research into various historical records revealed some of first members of the Barker family emigrate to North America:\n\nBarker Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nElizabeth Barker, who landed in Massachusetts in 1620 12\n\nJohn Barker, who landed in Virginia in 1622 12\n\nJohn Barker, who arrived in Virginia in 1623 12\n\nHenry Barker, who arrived in Virginia in 1623 12\n\nHenry Barker, who landed in Jamestown Va in 1624 12\n\n...

The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts.

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Fide sed cui vide\n\nMotto Translation: Trust, but in whom take care.\n\nSuggested Readings for the name Barker +\n\nBarker-Harland: A Genealogical Study by Marjorie Harland Barker Diedrich.\n\nOdyssey of the Barkers and the Russells by Don W.
