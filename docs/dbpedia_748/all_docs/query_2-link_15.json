His wife is said to have died in 1539.\n\nBiography\n\nFrom http://landedfamilies.blogspot.com/2019/07/384-barker-of-haughmond-...\n\nSunday, 28 July 2019 (384) Barker of Haughmond Abbey and Colehurst Hall\n\nJohn Barker, who was active around 1500 (and with whom the genealogy below begins) was apparently already the tenant of the Corbet family in their Colehurst estate at Market Drayton (Shrops). He had two recorded sons, John Barker (d. 1572) and William Barker (d. 1564), the latter of whom inherited Colehurst. John Barker (d. 1572) was evidently the steward or tenant of Shrewsbury Abbey's manor of Wollerton in the parish of Hodnet, and made his home there. After the dissolution of Shrewsbury Abbey this was one of the manors acquired by John's brother-in-law, Sir Rowland Hill (c.1495-1561), kt., a rich London merchant who was Lord Mayor in 1549-50. Sir Rowland was really the founder of the Barkers' fortunes, for having invested heavily in property but lacking children himself, he scattered substantial estates among his nephews and nieces and their offspring, both through lifetime gifts and through bequests. The children of John Barker (d. 1572) seem to have been especially favoured, and were the most generously endowed. His eldest son, James Barker (d. 1570) received an extensive estate centred on Haughmond Abbey as a wedding present in 1548, and the wording of the settlement suggests strongly that the former abbot's lodging at Haughmond had already been converted into a gentleman's house, although the process may not have been complete. James was expected to occupy the house at Haughmond, although in practice he seems also to have spent some of his time at his father's estate at Wollerton. It is with James that the family first securely enters the ranks of the gentry, as he obtained a grant of arms in 1562. James' younger brother, Edward Barker (d. 1558) predeceased Sir Rowland, but his son, Rowland Barker was bequeathed three estates in north Shropshire, all of which he sold in 1593. James's sister Alice, who married Sir Rowland Hill's friend, Sir Thomas Leigh (c.1504-71), inherited the Stoneleigh estate in Warwickshire and carried it to the Leigh family, whose home it remained for four centuries.\n\nNotes\n\nMaybe some light on Rowland Barker, ref to Gleanings From Rowland Barker Will. (See Link:\n\nhttps://www.ancestry.com/family-tree/tree/106155278/media/dcbb7853-... )\n\nfrom New England Families, Genealogical and Memorial By William Richard Cutter :\n\n(The Barker Line).\n\nThe surname Barker is of ancient English origin, dating back to the beginning of surnames in England. John Barker, the first to whom the American line is traced, lived in the middle of the sixteenth century. He married Elizabeth Hill, a daughter of Thomas Hill, and niece of Sir Rowland Hill, the first Protestant Lord Mayor of London, 1549.\n\n(II) Edward, son of John Barker, lived and died in England.\n\n(III) Rowland, son of Edward Barker, lived at Wollerton, county Salop, England, and was granted a coat-of-arms.\n\nBarker misc:\n\nThe link between the lines of Robert Barker of Plymouth Colony, his brother John of Duxbury, Mass. and English ancestors is clearly shown by the coat-of-arms used by the brothers and their father in England. \"Barry of then or and sable, over all a bend or\". The Principal Visitation of Shropshire, England commenced the pedigree of the Barker family with Randulph de Calverhall, tenant in fee of the Manor of Calverhall in 1200, his son was William de Calverhall of Balnominster (1219) and his great grandson (1278) bore the first Barker arms. This man was Randulph de Calverhall whose son William was forded to flee when his king, Edward II became unpopular. He appeared in Hallon as William le Barker which soon became plain \"Barker\". His son was Roger le Barker, his son was William Barker, his son Henry Barker, his son was William, his son was John, his son was John of Colchurst, his son was George and his sons were John and Robert. They came (it is said) to New England about 1628-30. They left numerous descendants. John Barker, the direct descendant of Randulph de Calverhall of England (1200). He also shows many descendants. Richard Barzillai came with the twenty Puritan families who arrived at Salem Massachusetts under the leadership of the Reverend Ezekel Rogers in 1638. Left a numerous family. In 1682 William Pern came to America on the Ship \"Welcome\" and with him came his friend Samuel Barker who belonged to the Society of Friends. His descendants lived in the old homestead near Wilmington, Delaware until 1840. He is buried in the Old Swades Church in Wilmington, Delaware. While there were Barkers in Virginia as early as 1624 the first record found of James Barker is that he was born in England in 1726. That he was Captain of a British Man of War and came to America and was with George Washington at Braddock's defeat in 1755. He married Mary Smith of Portsmouth, England. One of his descendants of the fourth generation Mary Barker married James Burwell. The Barkers of West Virginia came from Delaware and their son \"Joseph\" settled at \"Red Stone\".\n\nA confident but questionable linkage back:\n\n1.
