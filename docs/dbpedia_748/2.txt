Biography

John Barker Jr. was a Virginia colonist.

According to descendants, John Barker, Jr. was born about 1652. He is the son of John Barker. In 1649, his father received a land patent in James City County on lower Chipoakes creek which suggests John was born in Virginia.[1]

A deed was recorded in Surry County on the 2nd day of September 1673 by John Barker Senior of the parish of Sourthwark, County of Surry and Anne his wife, the late wife of Geo. Marshall, granting land to John Barker the younger of Southwark containing 75 acres lying in Martins Brandon in Charles City County that Geo. Marshall had bequeathed to Anne.[2] Jno. Bark Junr acknowledged later that whereas Mrs. Ann Barker mother-in-law to me did convey the land in Martins Brandon said deed is null and void at a court held the 3rd of March 1673.[2]

On the 3rd day of November 1702, Walter Cotton and his wife, Elizabeth, sold 157 acres of land to John Johnson which was part of 314 acres patented by Walter Cotton and Thomas Cotton on the 20th of 8br [October] 1688.[3] The deed shows 314 acres of land being equally divided by agreement of Mr. Jno Barker and Mr. Jethro Barker at the request of Walter Cotton and Thomas Cotton. Jethro Barker was also one of the witnesses to the sale.

The 1702 list of tithables for Southwark Phish in Surry County charged John with:

Mr. John Barker Senr Jno Barker, Wm. Johnson & Jeffor Negr - 4[4]

The Last Will and Testament of John Barker was written on the 9th of October 1713, and recorded on the 19th of May 1714 noting these legatees:

daughter Elizabeth Andrews...daughter Sara Lanier...daughter Hannah Lashly...grandson Robert Foster 40 acres of land between two branches joyning to the land that his father Foster bought of Abraham Evans and Thomas Hunt lived...my son John Barker 400 acres that he now lives on beginning at the lower side of the mouth of the branch between him & my plantation that I now live on & so down the Swamp to the second branch below his plantation & so down the branch to the Swamp at the first beginning...his cattell hogs horse flesh & horse all goods already delivered into his possession...my plantation at Nottoway River being 222 acres including all the land between William Hunts line & the Indian Cabin branch after his mothers decease...my grandson John Barker one cow & calf & her increase...to son Josiah Barker 400 acres that he now lives on beginning at the second branch below his Brother & so including all the 400 acres from that branch to Richard "Parkers" line...222 acres at Nottoway River beginning at the corner side of the Indian Cabin branch and so down to Capt. Clements line...to wife Grace Barker my plantation that I now live on during her natural life & after her decease I give said plantation containing 300 acres lying between John Barker & Thomas Cottens unto my daughter Grace Barker one bay mare colt fanny with her increase...unto my grand daughter Grace Foster... wife Grace Barker various chattels and labour of my Negro Jeff during her natural life and after her decease unto my son Josiah Barker...order and appoint my son Josiah Barker to take into his possession the Estate of Christopher Grace and Robert Fosters and not to be appraised and to pay them as they shall come of age...unto son Josiah Barker the choice of two young horses...wife Grace Barker 1,200 pounds of Tobacco...rest of my estate to be appraised & divided into three parts only I order my son Josiah Barker no share in cattle nor hoggs but all the rest of my estate to be equally divided between my wife Grace Barker & my son Josiah Barker & my daughter Grace Barker.[5]

An excerpt from The Barkers of Virginia incorrectly noted "John's will mentions a Richard Barker but without identification but John's wife Grace's will, probated 18 August, 1725 names son Richard." Son, Josiah, did sell land to Richard "Parker," and daughter, Grace Barker, mentioned in her will a cousin, "Richard Barker." The author also summarized the heirs in the order named were:

Elizabeth Andrews, daughter. Elizabeth married (1) Christopher Foster; (2) Thomas Andrews.

Sarah Lanier, daughter, wife of Robert Lanier.

Hannah Lashley, daughter, wife of Walter Lashley.

Robert Foster, grandson.

John Barker, son. 622 acres.

John Barker, grandson.

Josiah Barker, son. 622 acres.

Grace Barker, wife. 300 acres for life, then to daughter Grace.

Grace Barker, daughter, dsp.[6]

Based on the will being recorded in May of 1714, this John Barker perhaps died in 1714 rather than 1713.

Children

Documented children of John Barker, Jr. born to Grace, his wife, were:

Elizabeth Barker

Sarah Barker

Research Notes

Disputed Marriage

John Barker's wife Grace has been named as either Grace Cotton, Grace Busby, or even, by some, Grace Johnson. According to some descendants, most evidence seems to suggest that Grace was the daughter of Thomas Busby and granddaughter of Francis and Grace Grey. Note: SAR-Sons of American Revolution Society Membership Barker ll

Those descendants' claims can be disputed by the age of Grace Busby. On the 22nd of July 1671, Thos. Busby made a deed of gift to his daughter, Grace Busby, of a Mare filly to be delivered to her at the age of tenn [10] years old which suggests she was born between 1661 and 1671.[7] If she married at age 21, she would have married between 1682 and 1692. When John Barker wrote his will in 1713, he had grandchildren which suggests he more than likely married, at least, by 1674.

Jethro Barker, Senior, John Johnson, and Grace Barker were witnesses to the Last Will and Testament of Thomas Cotton written on the 26th of February 1718, and recorded in Surry County.[8]

On the 3rd day of November 1702, Walter Cotton and his wife, Elizabeth, sold 157 acres of land to John Johnson which was part of 314 acres patented by Walter Cotton and Thomas Cotton on the 20th of 8br [October] 1688.[9] The deed shows 314 acres of land being equally divided by agreement of Mr. Jno Barker and Mr. Jethro Barker at the request of Walter Cotton and Thomas Cotton. Jethro Barker was also one of the witnesses to the sale.

There were three persons named John Barker, who were transported into the colony, recorded in Virginia Immigrants, 1623-1666 which included one into Surry County in 1656 by Thos. Busby which is perhaps why some people claim Grace was the daughter of Thomas Busby. They were:

Barker, John, 1656, by Thos Busby, Surry Co.

Barker, Jon., 1637, by Thomas Causey, Charles City Co.

Barker, John, 1639, by William Dooi, James City.[10]

It should be noted that this Barker family was in Surry County by 1749.

It appears the John Barker, Jr. (born c1652), which this profile covers, has been confused with another John Barker. As proven on the profile of the linked father John Barker Sr. there was an older John Barker referred to in land documents in 1657 as Junior.[11] The Charles City County court records document that John Barker as Capt. John Barker in 1665, and the son of William Barker, Mariner.[12]

The confusion between the two John Barker Jr's seems to have occurred again with the claim that he was married to Grace Busby. Descendants are basing this fact on the association of the John Barker who, according to Southside Virginia Families. Volume 2, "It appears that Thomas Busby and John Barker were among the "Rebels" who took possession of "Bacon's Castle" (Arthur Allen's home) during the Rebellion, for "Bacon's Lieutenant, Thomas Busby, at whose house no guard was found during the critical days of Mid-September, along with a number of Bacon's men (among whom was John Barker) agreed to pay Arthur Allen damages, Nov. 16, 1677."[13] In 1677, this John Barker, Jr. would have been about age 25. It is highly doubtful that the John Barker who agreed to pay damages of "four hundred & forty pds" to Arthur Allen would have been a person of the age of 25.[14] The Bacon's rebellion information appears to be for his father, John Barker, Sr. given the fact the other John Barker died in 1673.

[15] John Barker patented 600 acres on Chippokee Creek on 5 October 1657 [on the above map, Upper Chipokee Creek or Chippokee Creek is that 'creek' which enters the James River just above the name 'SURRY']. His wife's name was Grace Cotton, though some thought Grace to have been the daughter of Thomas Busby and granddaughter of Francis Grey and Grace Grey. This Thomas Busby was probably the Busby known as "Bacon's Lieutenant" with whom this John Barker and others in Bacon's Rebellion took over the home of Arthur Allen, later called "Bacon's Castle" and who on 15 November, 1677, agreed to pay Allen for damage done to his home. Thomas Cotton's will was found and shows Grace Barker to be the daughter of the said Thomas Cotton .

John Barker's will was probated in Surry County on 19 May 1714. [16]. John Barker's will names

Elizabeth Andrews, daughter who married first to Christopher Foster and * second to Thomas Andrews;

Sarah Lanier, daughter, wife of Robert Lanier;

Hannah Lashley, daughter, wife of Walter Lashley;

Robert Foster, grandson;

John Barker, son - 400 acres;

John Barker, grandson; Josiah Barker, son - 400 acres; Grace Barker, wife - 300 acres for her lifetime and then to daughter Grace Barker;

Grace Barker, daughter.

John's will mentions a Richard Barker, but without identification but his wife Grace Barker in her will probated 18 August 1725 names son Richard (DW 9, 211). Josiah Barker is instructed to take possession of the estates of Christopher, Grace and Robert Foster until they come of age. SOURCE:W. E. Pullen in The Barkers of Virginia

John was born in 1652. He passed away in 1713.
