Although John Barker Jr.’s contribution to Bristol’s Hope was cut short by his death in 1636, it must have been very significant at the start. He was Master of the Merchant Venturers in 1618 and seems to have brought a core of participants to the project. His daughter Elizabeth married John Gonning one of the original patentees. His sister Joyce had married Andrew Charlton.6 Charlton was another original patentee who remained a plantation owner after the death of John Barker and the departure of John Gonning.

John Barker’s brother-in-law Robert Hayman, brother of John’s wife Mary(?), was made governor of the colony. An account trying to clarify his role states that Robert had “a single-minded and unquenchable enthusiasm for the cause of British colonization”.7 It is probable that Robert played a significant role in promoting the project in the towns around Totnes, Devon where he had lived. Hayman certainly seems to have walked the talk. He launched another colonization effort in Guyana. He personally subscribed for half the shares of the adventure. He unfortunately disappeared without a trace on the quest. By 1642 a petition at Dartmouth8, where Robert’s father had been Mayor, showed a large contingent of fisherman from local towns to Newfoundland. Among those names were four Haymans from the Wolborough area where Robert Hayman was born.

Barker’s family had history overseas. John Barker, Sr. seems to have been treasurer of the Bristol branch of the Spanish Company in 1583.9 His uncle Andrew Barker had lived and functioned as an agent in Tenerife in the Canary Islands in the 1570’s. Later, in an attempt to recover family losses at the hands of the Spanish, Andrew had followed in Drake’s path as a freebooter against them. Eventually a mutiny amongst his party would see him left upon an island off Honduras, where he was killed by the Spanish – on the return of these mutineers to Plymouth:

” Divers of our company,” says the person from whom Hakluyt collected his relation, “were committed to prison upon our arrival at Plymouth, at the suit of Mr. John Barker (Sr.), of Bristol, as accessories to his brother, our captain’s death, and betrayers of him unto the enemy.”10

John Barker’s brother Thomas married Martha Aldworth. The Aldworths would develop the Pemaquid plantation from 1631. I cannot find a direct connection to Thomas in the Pemaquid records.

More on the Barkers

Apparently one of the Bristol ships supplied to fight the Spanish Armada was The Great Unicorn (250 tons). It was owned by John Barker Sr. and William Ellis.19 Richard Worth in his History of Plymouth includes John Barker of Bristol in the array of famous seafarers present when the arrival of the Armada was announced.20 It is possible this is an error though as Capt. Robert Barker (of London?) was also in the battle.

John Barker Sr. was Sherriff in 1593. He died as Mayor in 1607.21 On September 16, 1595 the Bristol Port Books show John Barker importing train oil from Newfoundland on The Unicorn captained by James Powell. Two days later, Thomas Barker (possibly John Jr.’s brother) is captain on The John which brings in train oil from Newfoundland for merchant John Barnes.

Although John Barker Jr. is not listed as an investor in Cuper’s Cove, he did have a connection. He sent his apprentice John Crowder (Crowther?) as one of the original settlers in 1609.22 Crowder was in the group that explored Harbour Grace and Trinity Bay with John Guy. Andrew Charlton, also his apprentice, would become Barker’s brother-in-law.

John Barker Jr. and Robert Hayman were brothers-in-law. Robert Hayman married Grace Spicer in 1604. John Barker married Elizabeth Barker in 1607. Elizabeth Barker was the daughter of William Spicer merchant and once Sherriff of Exeter. In his will in 1604 William makes Hayman and his brother Thomas, mayor of Exeter, his executors. He names Grace his daughter but she is possibly his adopted niece. He was predeceased by his brother Christopher. Another of William’s siblings, Nicholas, was also a mayor of Exeter. In the year John Barker Jr was married his father died while in the office of Mayor of Bristol.

John Barker Jr. was educated at Oxford. Bristol’s Hope was not the first adventure for him. In 1612–13, he mounted an expedition to the Marowijne River in Guyana. The voyage was aboard The Sea Bright of Bristol, with Martin Pring/Prynn as master.23 If accurate, this would have been a second voyage to Guyana for Pring who had travelled there in 1604 in The Phoenix for Captain Charles Leigh. He had abandoned the project after severe difficulties and made his way home on a Dutch ship. Most of the party perished.24

Joyce Barker, daughter of John Barker Sr., married (ca 1603) William Bigges (Bigge), a Bristol Merchant, probably from Bitton. The 1601 Port Books show he was exporting lead to Italy and France. In his 1604 will he mentions many of the Barkers, John Doughty, Jane Davis and one Millard as well. The couple had at least one son John Bigges. After the death of William Bigges, Joyce married Andrew Charlton ca 1623.

In 1630 Robert Barker, merchant of Plymouth, had commission to buy and ship to Italy 200 hogsheads of pilchards for John Barker, Andrew Charlton and Richard Longe, merchants of Bristol.25 I wonder if perhaps this is John’s brother. He contracted on their behalf with William Rowe of ‘Milbroke’ [? Millbrook in Cornwall], owner of The Merchant Bonadventure of that port, to freight the pilchards from Plymouth to Villefranca [Villefranche-sur-mer] and Leghorn for £4 a ton. They were loaded in Nov. 1628. There were Barkers in Plymouth, London and Hull who are probably unrelated to the Bristol clan.

Prisage was the privilege of the English monarch to receive two tuns of wine from every ship importing twenty tuns or more. Apparently this tax was specific to Bristol and other ports were exempt. The Barkers had purchased one quarter of this right to tax. Eventually their share would drop to one sixteenth. In 1603 “Jerome Ham and John Barker were granted reversion of price wine in the port of Bristol for 38 years.”26 John Fowens Sr. had a one sixteenth share in the prisage of Bristol which he mentions in his will. John Guy Sr. also had a one sixteenth share which he willed to his son. John Guy Jr. had the one sixteenth share of the prisage in the inventory done at the time of his death of in 1640.27 The prisage was not only for individuals. The priory of St James had the rights for 24 hours prior to the feast of St James.28 It is possible that John Barker Jr. distributed some of his rights to others involved in Bristol’s Hope. Richard Long and Humphrey Hooke would be disabled from Parliament in 1642 for being wine monopolists. Prisage is probably what drew the attention of Parliament in the Civil wars in declaring some merchants monopolists.

The 1681 Newfoundland census has John Barker (?) in the Bristol sack ship Olive Branch taking 2000 quintals of fish from Carbonear. It seems that this is possibly a descendant of the founder of Bristol’s Hope, although Barkers seem to be active in many major ports.

Apprenticeships were the primary way these merchants developed competent and loyal staff and also spread risk through interlocking family trading interests. One author stated that apprentices to Newfoundland merchants at this time worked the summers in the fishery and the winters in the offices. The following arrangement was recorded in Latin so errors are possible. On 21 July 1629, Joseph Taylor, son of Thomas Taylor, cooper, was apprenticed to Thomas Barker merchant for 8 years. This is probably the Joseph Taylor who became a Merchant Venturer in 1637.It looks like the apprenticeship had been transferred to John Barker and wife Mary in July 1634.29 A Thomas Taylor was recorded resident in Cuper’s Cove. John Taylor was active in Bristol’s Hope. Another recorded apprentice:

“William Chetwynd, merchant, was apprenticed to John Barker, merchant, and made a burgess on 4th July, 1683 He was elected Chamberlain on 6th October, 1639/4 and removed from office immediately by order of the King. As a result of a successful petition from the Council, he was restored to office on 17th December, 1639.”30

William was an owner of The Lyon and The Lyon’s Welp with John Goninge, John Barker’s son-in-law, in 1629. In the same year he was an owner of The Thundor with John Goninge, John Taylor and Miles Jackson.31

On Corn Street in Bristol you can now observe four very old bronze pedestals called The Nails. Originally they were found on Tolzey Walk, a covered area alongside All Saints Church. The pedestals were used by merchants to negotiate over while making deals. When the deal was done, payment was made by placing money on a nail, hence the term “cash on the nail.” The four surviving nails all have a raised rim, supposedly to stop coins from rolling off the top of the pedestal. One of the nails is marked around the rim with the name John Barker (probably the donor).

The Barker clan seems to fade to the background after the death of John Barker in 1636. He had 3 sons at the time of his death. John Barker Jr, his son and heir, had married Mary Cox. He occupied the house on Small St but his sister Elizabeth seems to have been living there (as well?) with her husband John Gonning. Another son, William, apprenticed as a soapmaker to William Slye, died in 1637.7 The longest living son seems to be Andrew (1629-1700). He was named in the will of his grandmother Anne Fownes in 1630. In 1658 he is active in distributing his father’s assets to charities as laid out in his father’s will.6

In John’s will, drafted on 26 Mar. 1636, he included cash legacies of over £3,700, including portions of £450 to his two unmarried daughters, as well as his share in the prisage lease (now only a sixteenth) and property including the nearby manor of Southmead (purchased from the Haynes family) where he died.8 This property and nearby Magdalenwood were passed on to John Cox, brother of Mary Cox. Mary Cox had married John Barker lll. Andrew Barker was left properties in Pilnen, Olveston and would eventually inherit the Small St house then in the tenure of his brother John lll. Thomas Guy participated in the Post Mortem Inquisition of assets in 1639.

From a 1654 deposition of George Whittington it seems that John lll was alive in 1648. He had married his second wife Mary Locke, daughter of Richard Locke, an apprentice of John Barker Jr., and an Alderman of Bristol.5 John had probably died prior to the deposition. John lll, Andrew Barker and/or his mother (died before 1658) seem to have preserved the family assets through the turbulent civil war that instilled havoc on Richard Longe and so many other businessmen. In 1650 Andrew opportunistically bought Warwick Court at Fairfield from Sir Robert Tracy. Tracy was a Royal Cavalier who found himself less fortunate in the conflict. Andrew built a new structure in the Park that had come with a deteriorated manor house. Fairford is a small market town that was an important centre in the wool trade.

I found one reference to the Barker family trading after the Civil War. In December 1661, Sir Thomas Allin of the Royal Navy is on route escorting the English fleet returning home from Cadiz. He records providing Mr. Barker of Bristol two planks to repair his foremast and bowsprit. These were apparently damaged in a collision amidst the fleet.6

For the most part though, Andrew seems to go under the radar. His brother-in-law Sir Samuel Mico was a leading merchant of the time. Andrew was said to have had close ties (via in-laws) with London and if he had capital he would have done well just backing Samuel Mico’s varied ventures. Both men had married Robinson girls and the 3 families seem to be involved in a number of joint transactions. Mico was part of the Levant Company and the East Indies Company. The families did seem to be investing together in properties including the manor and others in Kilcott, Hawkesbury, Gloucestershire area from 1665 to 1681.7

Andrew was briefly a Sherriff but handed the post over to his son Samuel (1659-1708). Samuel later became an MP ( 1702 – 1708) for Cricklade. Andrew’s brother -in-law Samuel Robinson was also an MP for Cricklade in the parliaments of 1710–1713 and 1714–1715. Samuel was the last male heir. A son-in-law would assume the Barker name and coat-of-arms.

In Newfoundland in 1681 it is likely a John Barker of Bristol had The Olive Branch sack ship in Carbonear. Seary has a John Barker in St John’s in 1730. He probably signed one of the merchant petitions made by those of Bristol, Poole and Dartmouth against acts of the Justices of the Peace.

If his family did not have a continuing connection to Harbour Grace, the city of Bristol which he introduced there did. By 1800 businessmen from Bristol who established mercantile firms in Harbour Grace included Thorne, Hooper & Co., Hugh Danson, J.C. Nuttall, Joshia Parkins, J. Trapnell, James Lewis, Richard Palmer, John Webb, James Guppy and Peter Rogerson. John Clements also had an office in Bristol.
