The business was incorporated in 1894 as John Barker & Company Limited with Mr. Barker as the Chairman of the Board, which also had two of his brothers as members. At this time, John Baker & Company consisted of thirty-three shops with sixteen of them facing Kensington High Street. The Company now had sixty-four departments offering goods ranging from Clothes to Groceries, Plumbing to Catering and also including a Chemist’s where prescriptions could be filled.

In 1907, the former Ponting’s Department Store close by on Kensington High Street was purchased by the John Baker & Company. Despite this purchase, The Company continued to operate both Stores as separate entities, but did begin to advertise the erstwhile Ponting’s Department Store as The House for Value.

Between 1912 and 1918, John Baker & Company suffered a number of disasters:

The original part of Barker’s Store was severely damaged by fire in 1912. The damaged departments were found temporary premises in building opposite on Kensington High Street. In the following year, The Company’s own construction department began to rebuild the fire-gutted area.

John Barker died in 1914. In addition to being an Entrepreneur, Mr. Barker had been an Alderman of the first London County Council and, at one time, Liberal Member of Parliament for Maidstone (1900-1901) and for Penryn and Falmouth in Cornwall (1906-1910). In 1908, he was awarded a Baronetcy. Upon Sir John Barker’s death, Mr. Sidney Skinner became the new Chairman of the Board. Mr. Skinner had joined The Company in 1889 and worked his way up to this position. Mr. Skinner had been a director and was a great influence upon the decision to purchase the Ponting’s Department Store.

The business of The Company was severely impaired by with the declaration of The First World War and cut-backs were made. Despite this, The Company recovered following the end of the war and resumed its expansion policy.

In 1920 John Barker & Company purchased the Derry & Toms Department Store, which is adjacent to J. Barker & Co. With this purchase, The Company now owned threeStores on Kensington High Street and which were in close proximity to each other. Although this was the case, each Store retained it own distinct identity.

The Board of Directors agreed that ……..

Barkers should be conducted on high-class lines and Pontings and Derry & Toms cater for the multitude of good middle-class lines.

Quote from: A Legend of Retailing: House of Fraser

by Michael Moss and Alison Turton (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1989

In 1924, John Barker & Company opened new stores in Liverpool, Birmingham and Manchester selling Pianos and Gramophones. This venture proved to be a failure with the closure of these Stores in 1926.

Despite this setback, The Company acquired Zeeta Cake Company Limited, a high class catering business in 1925. This Company had been formed as an independent company by Sir Sidney Skinner, who had succeeded Sir John as Chairman upon his death, and Mr. Trevor Bowen, who would succeed Sir Sidney in 1941.

In 1926, John Barker & Company opened a new Furniture department at the site on Kensington High Street that had once been a temporary home for several departments damaged during the fire of 1912.

In 1927, John Barker & Company reached agreement with The Crown, the principal local landowner in Kensington, for an exchange of properties that would allow The Company to gain the necessary consolidation of land in order to rebuild Barker’s and Derry & Toms.

John Barker & Company undertook this large building project beginning in 1930. However, it was not to be completed until 1958 due to the intervening Second World War. When finally finished, the project fulfilled its aim in turning both the Department Stores of Barker’s and of Derry & Toms into Art Deco wonders.

The project required that the frontages of The Stores be moved back by 30 feet to help relieve the traffic congestion of Kensington High Street. In addition, Pontings Department Store was extended along an adjacent street.

The buildings of the new Department Stores were designed by architect Bernard George with the new Derry & Tom’s Store opening in 1933. The Store’s publicity stated that it was a beautiful store to sell beautiful things.

Further construction on the new Barker’s Department Store was not resumed until 1955 and was only finally completed in 1958.

In 1955, construction was able to be resumed on the new Barker’s Department Store and was finally completed in 1958. However, prior to its opening, the John Barker & Company had changed hands.

In 1957, The House of Fraser bought The Barkers Group. Following the sale of The Company, Mr. Bowen replaced as Chairman by Hugh Fraser (1936-1987), but remained as honourary President of the Company until his death in 1965.

Under the House of Fraser’s ownership, The Company was gradually was streamlined. By 1970, The House of Fraser concluded that it was not profitable to maintain three department stores on Kensington High Street and closed Pontings and Derry & Toms Department Stores in 1971 and 1973 respectively. With the closure of Pontings, its goods were transferred to the basement of Barker’s Department Store, which was re-named the Pontings Bargin Basement. The Basement was closed in 1976 since the owners felt that it was not in keeping with the image of Barker’s Department Store.

In 1975, The House of Fraser purchased The Army & Navy Stores and made Barker’s Department Store the Flagship of the Army & Navy Division.

By the 1980’s, the House of Fraser concluded that Barker’s Department Store was too large to support the number of clients that was shopping there. As a result, it was decided to make The Store more compact.

As a result, the number of departments was reduced with a subsequent reduction in floor space. The Store was reduced from 600,000 square feet (56,000 square meters) on seven floors to 140,000 square feet (13,000 square meters) on less than four. The new Compact Store was completed in 1986.

The newly acquired space was converted for offices with an atrium, which was the largest in Europe at that time. In addition, part of the newly available space on the lower floor at the west end of The Store was converted into nine Boutiques and an Arcade and were opened in 1987.

Barker’s Department Store on Kensington High Street continued to offer service in its reduced form until January 2006 when The House of Fraser decided to close it. Barker’s Department Store at Eastbourne had been closed earlier in 1997.

Today, the erstwhile Barker’s Department Store is now a Whole Foods Market, which sells Organic and Natural Foods.
