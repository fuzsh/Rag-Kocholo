The lyrics of Catarrhal Noise's song Cecchinato are mostly nonsensical and seem to be a combination of gibberish words and phrases, with the repeated refrain "da chi vai? da Cecchinato!" ("who do you go to? to Cecchinato!"). The first two lines ask who to go to if one has run out of "solfato" or if the "varsuro" is "immerlato," and the answer given is always "Cecchinato!" The next few lines seem to refer to plumbing issues and excrement, with suggestions to go to the Fratelli Zago or to "Luigina e Silvano, trattoria AL FAJANO" to avoid stomach problems. The final lines mention the type of bread served at the trattoria and invite the listener to come and visit.
