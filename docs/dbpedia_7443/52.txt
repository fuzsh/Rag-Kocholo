The lyrics to Catarrhal Noise's song Cilliegina are in a Venetian dialect and are not easy to understand. However, it seems like the song is about the singer going to a bar at the train station and having a drink called Trielina, which is served with a cherry (cilliegina in Venetian). The singer mentions how good the drink is with the cherry in it. The next day, the singer goes to the fields and plants something called Cimatti, which is a traditional Venetian game played with bones. Then he says he got involved in some kind of trouble and compares it to the sweetness of the cherry in Trielina.
