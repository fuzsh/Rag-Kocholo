        "text": "Some home remedies like warm baths, saline drops, and clean air may help an infant who is congested. However, speak with a doctor if the infant also has other symptoms like fever.\n\nWhile the sniffles and snuffles that go along with congestion aren’t a medical emergency the first time you hear them from your own baby, it can sure feel like it.\n\nEspecially if your baby sounds congested but you don’t see any boogers or mucus in their nose, it may seem like a problem without a solution.\n\nSo what’s going on with your baby and how do you help them?\n\nHealthy babies can often sound congested simply because they’re tiny new people with baby-sized systems, including miniature nasal passages. Just like those itty-bitty fingers and toes, their nostrils and airways are extra small.\n\nIt doesn’t take much for these teeny pathways to become affected by minor dryness or by just a bit of clear mucus. This may simply be a normal part of their growth and development.\n\nBut there are things that can affect the amount of congestion they have, and knowing what those are may help you relieve some of their sniffles with home treatments — or signal when you should call the doctor.\n\nHere are some factors that increase the chances of congestion:\n\nPreemie babies. The air passages of preemies are even smaller than those of your average newborn. This may make slightly noisy breathing even more likely.\n\nAir irritants. Think tobacco or cooking smoke, heavy perfumes, room aromatherapy diffusers, or fumes from household cleaning products, paint, or varnish. These can irritate your baby’s nasal passages.\n\nDry air. Low humidity can dry out and irritate nasal passages. This can be a result of using your home’s heating system or simply living in an arid climate.\n\nWeather changes. Waving goodbye to summer heat may sound like fun, but when the drop in temperature brings low humidity and dry air, your baby is more likely to sound congested.\n\nWhat about illness?\n\nNot all congestion is part and parcel of nasal passages that need to grow up. Sometimes, congestion can be related to illness and may even develop deeper in your baby’s chest.\n\nThis congestion can be due to illness such as:\n\na cold\n\nflu\n\nrespiratory syncytial virus (RSV)\n\nCongestion that affects your baby’s breathing or moves into baby’s lungs may signal a more complex condition such as:\n\nbronchiolitis\n\npneumonia\n\nasthma\n\ncystic fibrosis (typically identified during newborn screenings.)\n\nSeveral things can signal that your baby has congested nasal passages. Here’s what to look out for:\n\nsniffles and snuffles\n\nslightly blocked or runny nose\n\nnoisy breathing\n\nsnoring when asleep\n\ntouch of difficulty when feeding\n\nlight coughing\n\nWith these light symptoms you, at least, can breathe easy. Look for other signs that may indicate illness, like fever or vomiting, to determine whether to call the doctor.\n\nIf your baby has any of the following symptoms, you’ve got some reason for concern:\n\nThe sniffling turns into labored breathing.\n\nYou can hear wheezing that makes it sound like each breath is an effort.\n\nYour baby’s nostrils flare in and out every time they breathe.\n\nYour baby’s chest retracts with each breath.\n\nIf your baby is demonstrating any of these symptoms, call the doctor right away.\n\nSometimes your baby may sound congested, but, try as you may, you can’t see much mucus. What gives? The first step is to look for any other signs of illness.\n\nDoes your baby have a fever?\n\nIs your baby listless?\n\nHave your baby’s diapers been sufficiently wet and frequent?\n\nDoes your baby refuse to breastfeed or reject their bottle?\n\nDoes their congestion interfere with their sleep?\n\nIf you see any of these symptoms, talk with your doctor to determine the best treatments to help your baby.\n\nOn the other hand, if your baby seems generally content and is eating, sleeping, and dirtying diapers regularly, you may not need to do anything but wait for the congestion to pass. In some cases doing too much (like frequent use of a nasal aspirator) can irritate the nose further.\n\nIf you’re looking for a way to help a fussy congested baby, you may want to start with some of the home remedies below.\n\nHome remedies to ease congestion\n\nYou may not see any mucus in your baby’s nose, but that doesn’t mean it might not be there. Since your baby spends so much time lying on their back, mucus can easily collect in the back of their nose or throat, causing the sniffling you don’t want to hear.\n\nThese home remedies may ease congestion:\n\nWarm baths. A calming bath in warm water can help clear congestion.\n\nSaline drops. A few saline drops in each nostril can help to loosen and thin the mucus. Thank your lucky stars if your baby sneezes and releases the mucus independently.\n\nNasal bulb syringes or nasal aspirators. If your baby isn’t sneezing on their own to clean things out you can clear away the excess mucus mechanically by using a bulb syringe or nasal aspirator.\n\nCool mist humidifier. A humidifier can prevent dry air from irritating your baby’s nasal passages.\n\nPositioning. Hold or wear your baby, or put your baby in the swing when they’re awake so they’re spending less time flat on their back. Do not place anything in the crib with your baby to position them as that can increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\nFacial massage. Use your thumb to gently massage the nasal bridge, forehead, temples, and cheekbones. This may help drain the nasal passages.\n\nClean air. Clear away dust, allergens, and pollutants. Clean air and clean surfaces can reduce your baby’s exposure to irritants. Throw open your windows and go on a housecleaning spree.\n\nWhile some people may recommend vapor rub, at least one study suggests that it’s not the best choice for babies and should be avoided.\n\nThe same goes for the various cold medications that are available over the counter — stick to the home remedies listed above or consult your doctor about other treatment options."
