        "text": "Introduction:\n\nCatarrha means the building up of mucus in the cavities of the body, like sinuses and facial cavities that drain into the nose. This condition causes blockage and difficulty in hearing and breathing. It is an unpleasant but long-lasting condition. This condition mainly affects the Eustachian tube. Build up of mucus and inflammation affects the ear. The conditions like serosal otitis and conductive hearing impairment are to be differentiated from catarrhal inflammation of the eustachian tube.\n\nWhat Is Catarrhal Inflammation of the Eustachian Tube?\n\nCatarrhal inflammation of the eustachian tube is a common condition that is not a grave disease of fall, winter, or spring. The Eustachian tube is a part of the outer ear that connects the tympanic cavity with the nasal cavity. This eustachian tube equalizes the pressure between the tympanic cavity and the outside.\n\nWhat Causes Catarrhal Inflammation of the Eustachian Tube?\n\nCatarrha is caused due to reaction of the immune system to infection and irritation. The lining of the nose and throat gets swollen and produces mucus. This can be started by\n\nInfections or cold.\n\nDue to allergic reactions to rhinitis.\n\nNonallergic infection of the nose.\n\nNasal polyps.\n\nCatarrha in the ear (tubal phlegm) is due to inflammation that causes mucus generation that cannot be drained. The causes of it include;\n\nOtitis media or due to infection of the airway.\n\nDue to birth defects.\n\nInfections occur due to bacteria.\n\nAir pollution and smoking habits.\n\nWhen mucosa of the middle ear is infected, it is determined that phlegm is present in the ear cavity. The mucus is situated completely at the chest of the eardrum. It is less frequent in summer but more common in winter. The most common bacterias are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.\n\nWhat Are the Symptoms of Catarrhal Inflammation of the Eustachian Tube?\n\nSymptoms of catarrhal inflammation of the eustachian tube include;\n\nExperience the fullness of the ear.\n\nDecreased hearing capacity.\n\nHearing abnormal sounds of oneâs voice.\n\nRinging in the ears (tinnitus).\n\nLow-intensity pain.\n\nDizziness.\n\nDecreased hearing capacity may be resolved with the reduction in inflammation. If the infection persists for a long time and if the infection reaches the inner ear, it may result in permanent damage to hearing.\n\nWhat Is the Pathogenesis of Catarrhal Inflammation of the Eustachian Tube?\n\nThis condition may arise when the eustachian tube does not open during swallowing. This can occur under the following conditions;\n\nIncompetence of the muscle responsible for the opening of the eustachian tube.\n\nThe mucus membrane of the eustachian tube gets swollen due to infection of the areas like the maxilla and pharynx.\n\nWhen adenoids get swollen.\n\nWhen malignant tumors of the nasopharynx get into the eustachian tube opening.\n\nFor any of the mentioned reasons, there will be a blockage of ventilation to the middle ear. The air inside is used up. Hence there is a generation of negative pressure in the cavity system. The condition is always accompanied by the catarrh of the upper respiratory system, but only sometimes, the mucous membrane of the eustachian tube at the opening is affected and swollen, which blocks the ventilation to the tube.\n\nWhat Are the Complications of Catarrhal Inflammation of the Eustachian Tube?\n\nComplications may develop if catarrhal inflammation is not treated properly, which include:\n\nA seepage of liquid components of blood and serum albumin occurs due to the negative pressure.\n\nA middle ear infection occurs due to these deposits in the cavity.\n\nIf this condition persists may result in chronic mucous otitis.\n\nThis condition is further due to the superinfection of bacteria and viruses may cause acute purulent otitis.\n\nThe pus or the discharge is full of bacteria and viruses that create pressure in the cavity leading to earache and pulsing.\n\nHow to Diagnose Catarrhal Inflammation of the Eustachian Tube?\n\nAs it generally occurs with infection of upper respiratory tract infection, it can be identified with the symptoms present.\n\nPhysical Examination: Medical history and clinical examination are done.\n\nOtoscopy: A procedure to examine the structures of the ear.\n\nTympanometry: A test done to diagnose problems related to the hearing process.\n\nNasal Endoscopy: It is done to know the specific details like swelling of nasal tissue or site of bleeding.\n\nMicroscopic Examination: A microscope image is taken by inserting the pneumatic tube and light. Microscopic examination is essential.\n\nAudiometry Examination: This tests the ability to hear sounds.\n\nWhat Is the Treatment for Catarrhal Inflammation of the Eustachian Tube?\n\nTreatment depends on the severity of the condition. In many cases, the condition resolves on its own after a few days or a week. Hence no particular treatment is required.\n\nDecongestants can be given for a short duration only to relieve nasal congestion in the nose.\n\nAntihistamines are given to resolve allergic problems.\n\nIf the infection is persistent, then steroid nasal spray and drops may be given for relief.\n\nAntibiotics are given in case of bacterial infection.\n\nPainkillers may be given to relieve pain in the ear.\n\nSteam inhalation and gargling with warm water may ease the condition.\n\nWhat Is the Prevention for Catarrhal Inflammation of the Eustachian Tube?\n\nAnother reason for the dysfunction of the eustachian tube may be due to acidification of the body. In the detoxification process of the body, the mucous membrane of the sinus, eustachian tube, and middle ear swelling take place and produce mucus. The body attempts to remove these acids, and toxins, by binding with mucus.\n\nThis can be prevented by deacidification of the body by changing eating habits and diet and also by taking natural alkaline food supplements. These are strong oxygen catalysts that alkalinize the body and reduce acid levels.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe ear is an important organ of the body that is used for hearing. Any slight discomfort in it may affect the quality of life of an individual. Catarrhal inflammation of the eustachian tube is characterized by the building up of mucus in the cavities of the body, such as the sinuses and facial cavities that drain into the nose. It is associated with a ringing sensation in the ears, low-intensity pain, reduced hearing capacity, etc. Knowing about the condition helps in seeking help from a health professional early which can lead to effective treatment."
