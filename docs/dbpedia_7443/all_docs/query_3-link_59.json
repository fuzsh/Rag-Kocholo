        "text": "Otitis media is an infection of the middle ear. It causes inflammation (redness and swelling) and a build-up of fluid behind the eardrum.\n\nAnyone can develop a middle ear infection, but they’re most common in young children.\n\nYou do not always need to see a GP as most ear infections get better on their own within 3 to 5 days.\n\nSymptoms of a middle ear infection\n\nThe main symptoms of a middle ear infection include:\n\nearache\n\na high temperature (fever)\n\nbeing sick\n\na lack of energy\n\nslight hearing loss – if the middle ear becomes filled with fluid\n\nIn some cases, a hole may develop in the eardrum (perforated eardrum) and pus may run out of the ear. The earache, which is caused by the build-up of fluid stretching the eardrum, then resolves.\n\nSigns in young children\n\nYoung children and babies with an ear infection may also:\n\nrub or pull their ear\n\nnot react to some sounds\n\nbe irritable or restless\n\nbe off their food\n\nkeep losing their balance\n\nWhen to get medical advice\n\nTreatment for middle ear infections\n\nMost ear infections get better on their own within 3 to 5 days and do not need any specific treatment.\n\nIf needed, paracetamol or ibuprofen can be used to relieve pain and a high temperature. Always read the leaflet that comes with your medicine before taking it. Follow the recommended dosage instructions. If you’re not sure which treatments are suitable for you or your child, speak to a pharmacist for advice.\n\nPlacing a warm cloth over the affected ear may also help relieve pain.\n\nAntibiotics are not usually used to treat middle ear infections.\n\nWhat causes middle ear infections?\n\nMost middle ear infections occur when an infection, such as a cold, leads to a build-up of mucus in the middle ear. This causes the Eustachian tube (a thin tube that runs from the middle ear to the back of the nose) to become swollen or blocked. The mucus can’t drain away properly, making it easier for an infection to spread into the middle ear.\n\nAn enlarged adenoid (soft tissue at the back of the throat) can also block the Eustachian tube. The adenoid can be removed if it often causes ear infections.\n\nMiddle ear infections are more common in younger children because:\n\nthe Eustachian tube is smaller in children than in adults\n\na child’s adenoids are relatively larger than an adults\n\nCertain conditions can also increase the risk of middle ear infections, including:\n\nhaving a cleft palate\n\nhaving Down’s syndrome\n\nCan middle ear infections be prevented?\n\nIt’s not possible to prevent middle ear infections. There are some things you can do that may reduce your child’s risk of developing one.\n\nChildren who go to nursery or school can pick up infections from other children who are unwell.\n\nComplications of middle ear infections\n\nComplications of middle ear infections are fairly rare, but can be serious.\n\nMost complications are the result of the infection spreading to another part of the ear or head. Rarely, infections can leave a perforation or hole in the eardrum.\n\nIf complications do develop, they often need to be treated immediately with antibiotics in hospital."
