        "text": "Catarrh is a disease of the mucous membrane of the nasal passages and those cavities of the head communicating with them. Insignifiacnt as it appears in its first stages, it is apt in its progress to become instrumental in causing the loss or impairment of smell, taste, hearing and sight, and of creating serious constitutional derangements, not unfrequently terminating in consumption.\n\nA feeling of irritation, sensitiveness, heat or pain is experienced in the nose, the edges of which are red and swollen, and which is stopped up sometimes on one side, sometimes on the other, and occasionally on both, rendering respiration through it either difficult or impossible. The irritation in the nose produces a frequent desire to sneeze, and is accompanied with a discharge of either clear aerid water, or what is far oftener the case, a profuse, thick, yellowish and extremely offensive matter, which forms one of the most characteristic features of the disease, and is a source of the greatest annoyance and danger. As the disease progresses, this secretion becomes purulent, increases in quantity, and assumes an exceedingly fetid odor. It escapes not only by the nose, but passes into the throat, producing irritation there, and requiring frequent expectoration, hawking or scraping for its removal. As its passage into the throat is very much facilitated by a horizontal position of the body, sleep is frequently disturbed by a sensation of choking in consequence, and many are obliged to lie in a semi-recumbent position to obtain the necessary sleep.\n\nOwing to the heat in the head the watery portion of the discharge often evaporates, and assuming a condition of solidity, is deposited upon the membrane of the nose and upper part of the throat, in the shape of crusts or hardened lumps. The accumulation of these incrustations produces a feeling of discomfort, and narrows the nasal passages so as to embarrass respiration. Therefore, frequent efforts have to be made to remove them, either by forcibly blowing the nose, or by persistent hawking -- a practice as disagreeable to the one affected as it is to those around him. After the removal, that side of the incrustation which adhered to the mucous membrane will sometimes be found bloody, a fact which explains the force required for its dislodgment. During sleep these incrustations accumulate more rapidly, and the feeling is therefore most uncomfortable in the morning. Sometimes all efforts to clear the throat are futile until after breakfast, or after some stimulant had been swallowed. Ulceration of the mucous membrane of the nose takes place frequently, sometimes attacking the bones, when small particles of that substance will occasionally be found mixed with the discharge.\n\nThe breath assumes an excessively fetid and sickening odor, and becomes occasionally so offensive as to render the patient an object of disgust to himself as well as to others.\n\nThe accumulation of the discharge, together with the thickened condition of the mucous membrane, renders respiration through the nasal passages very difficult, and oftentimes impossible, necessitating respiration principally through the mouth -- a method very deleterious to the general health, but more particularly so to the lungs, which become weak and irritable. The voice loses its musical quality, and assumes a discordant, harsh and nasal character; the sense of smell becomes much impaired or entirely lost, and the same effect, though less frequent, is produced on taste. Occasionally, while blowing the nose, a crackling or bubbling sound is heard in the ears, and hearing becomes quite thick or stopped up, but returns suddenly with something like a snapping sound. This phenomena may be repeated several times, until hearing doss not return, but remains permanently injured. In other cases hearing is lost so gradually that a considerable degree of deafness may exist before the person is really aware of the fact. Either condition is often accompanied with noises in the head of every conceivable description, materially increasing the distress of the sufferer.\n\nThe eyes are apt to become weak, irritable and disposed to water on exposure to cold and wind, or after the slightest exertion. A pain, more or less acute, or a distressing feeling of pressure, is experienced over the eyes, and sometimes on the top or back of the head, and also pain in the face, closely resembling neuralgia, for which it is very often mistaken. The distress in the head weakens the memory, and produces irritability and moroseness of disposition. The stomach generally suffers more or less, is weak and irritable; the appetite is capricious, and is nearly always bad in the morning. In severe cases the system becomes feeble and prostrated.\n\nThis is manifested by a disposition to drowsiness and sleep, an aversion to either physical or mental exertion, and a feeling of fatigue and weakness.\n\nNot unfrequently catarrh proves fatal, either by debilitating the system and wearing out the patient, or by traveling downward, and producing throat affections, bronchitis, and finally consumption. It may be safely asserted that, after hereditary predisposition, catarrh is the most frequent and important cause of this fatal complaint.\n\nThe symptoms of catarrh vary considerable in different individuals, and the degree of their severity depends upon constitutional idiosyncrasies and various external influences. With some the complaint continues for a number of years in a mild form, and without causing any of the injurious results above described, while with others all the worst effects are produced in a short space of time, and cases, apparently most harmless, may, through imprudent exposure, additional cold, or unfavorable changes of the weather, suddenly exhibit all the violence and malignity which characterizes the severest ones.\n\nAny inflammation of the mucous membrane of the throat or nose is favorable to the production of Catarrh. Ordinary colds, if neglected or aggravated by additional exposure, are very apt to become chronic and run into Catarrh, and are the cause in nearly two-thirds of all the cases that present themselves. Scarlet fever, measles, diphtheria, and all the diseases affecting the throat, the inhalation of dust, impure atmosphere or aerid vapors, are among its most frequent inciting causes. Catarrh attacks in preference those possessing a feeble or scrofulous constitution and a lymphatic temperament; individuals of soft fibres, respiring an impure or confined atmosphere, or whose systems are debilitated by insufficient or unsubstantial nourishment; persons enervated by severe memtal labor, physical excesses or exhaustive diseases; those who lead a life of indolence, or dwell, either from choice or necessity, in damp, ill-ventilated places, deprived of pure air and the necessary sunshine. Persons who are exposed to the vicissitudes of the weather, or insufficiently protected against cold, scrofulous children, chlorotic females and these recently confined. In fact, whatever debilitates the system or vitiates the constitution, favors the development of catarrh. Its great prevalence in this country is owing to the sudden and frequent changes of the weather and temperature, to the extensive travel by rail where persons are confined in dusty, badly-ventilated, over-crowded and overheated cars. With the mail population it can often be traced to the extensive and inordinate use of tobacco, which enervates the system and produces local inflammation of the mucous membrane of the throat. In the females, to indolent and sedentary habits and their confinement to darkened rooms and parlors, whence the beneficent sunshine is sedulously excluded for the benefit of furniture, carpets, and complexion. This style of living renders the constitution weak and puny, highly sensitive to cold or to changes of the weather, and unable to resist any shock to the system. With children it often arises from the foolish and imprudent exposure of their arms and legs, which are left uncovered from a fancied idea that it improves their appearance. This practice cannot be too severely reprehended, for it causes an unequal circulation and consequent congestions. As the mucous membrane of the nasal passages is the most sensitive surface exposed, repeated attacks of cold are the result of this absurd custom, and catarrh not unfrequently follows.\n\nCatarrh has been considered an incurable disease, and on the strength of that supposition, has been neglected by both the profession and the public.\n\nThe author has for years past made this complaint his special study; was the first to publish a minute description of its nature, symptoms and effects, and has, by doing so, directed the attention of both the profession and the public to the vast importance of the subject.\n\nBy the established success of the treatment as instituted and perfected by him, he has proved beyond dispute the curability of catarrh, if properly treated. All doubts of the corrected of this statement will be dispelled by the perusal of the annexed testimonials from parties occupying well-known positions in society.\n\nCLARENDON HOTEL, NEW-YORK.\n\nI take pleasure in recommending Dr. Lighthill to those affected with catarrh or diseases of the throat, as I have myself suffered for some years past from those difficulties, and been relieved by the Doctor's efficient and skillful treatment.\n\nNo. 312 BROADWAY, NEW-YORK.\n\nI have been for a long time affected with chronic catarrh, and an affection of the throat, which last Spring became so bad that I could not sleep from incessant coughing, continued dull pain in my head, &c., &c.\n\nI applied to several physicians, but without any relief; my friends all thought I was affected with that sure and fatal disease, consumption. I at last applied to Dr. Lighthill, and am happy to state that under his treatment I have greatly improved, my cough has left me, and my nostrils are free from inflammation, and my general health is so much better that I look for its permanent restoration as a fixed fact. I cheerfully recommend all persons suffering from catarrh or throat affections to apply to Dr. Lighthill, feeling assured they will derive great benefit from so doing.\n\nNo. 3 WALL-ST., NEW-YORK.\n\nHaving been a sufferer from catarrh. I am enabled, from personal experience, to indorse Dr. Lighthill's mode of treatment, and can heartily recommend it to those affected with that disease.\n\nH.N. SMITH, firm of\n\nSMITH, MARTIN & CO., Bankers\n\nCATARRH OF TWENTY YEARS' STANDING CURED.\n\nFROM W.D. ALLEN, ESQ., CASHIER OF THE EXCHANGE BANK, GREENCASTLE, IND.\n\nI have been a sufferer from catarrh for more than twenty years; have been treated by a number of physicians, without receiving any benefit, and used a great many so-called remedies, with no beneficial result."
