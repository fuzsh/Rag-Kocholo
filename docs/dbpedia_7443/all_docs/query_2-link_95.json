        "text": "Ground Ivy (Glechoma hederacea )\n\nby Mindy Capello | HerbaRemedium.com\n\nGround Ivy is the herb that got me started on my Herbal Journey. When I first went to an herbalist it was mostly just like going to the Doctor to me. You have a problem; they give you something to take and then you take it. Instead of a pill, it was in a tincture bottle. On one visit I let my herbalist know that I had a lot of fluid in my ears. She then told me about Ground Ivy and said it was probably in my backyard as it is very prevalent in my area. She took me to her backyard and showed me what it was and told me how to make an oil of it. She explained how to rub the oil down my ear canals. I had a ton of it in my backyard! It is rather fragrant when mowed in the spring, so I knew exactly what it was! The oil worked amazingly. I could feel my ear canals opening and the fluid being drained from my ears. Being a very frugal person, I couldn’t believe I had “medicine” in my backyard! Also being frugal I like to “make my own food” from scratch, so making my own medicine was just natural to me. I then started looking into other “weeds” in my backyard and what to do with them. Thus began my herbal journey.\n\nI continue to this day to make an “Ear congestion” roll-on which now has Violet, calendula, and Pine EO in it. People love it. I use it to rub on the ear canals and on any swollen lymph nodes in the neck. Now I know that as long as I stay away from dairy, I don’t get congested like that. I find this blend particularly useful for the headaches you can get when the occipital lymph node is swollen. I rub this blend on there and it helps take down the swelling and headache.\n\nI use Ground Ivy tincture internally for ear congestion also. I think it's also a rather good substitute for Mucinex for those with thick mucus. I’m not going to say it’s a mucolytic but…. That the way I use it and it seems to work very well. Taken at night seems to keep that mucus at bay and collecting overnight and getting stuck; this is something I used to take every night before bed. It really helped me to not have chokingly thick mucus the next morning. My sinus would get so clogged I’d roll over in bed and could feel the fluid move out of one ear and go to the middle of my head. This would clear it right up (before I ever gave up dairy). I also find that for myself I tend to get dizzy from congestion deep in my sinuses after a bout of West Nile Virus. During the initial aftermath of West Nile that is what I dealt with the most, dizziness. If I get any bit of dizziness the tincture of Ground Ivy helps, clear it up right away.\n\nTINCTURE OBSERVATIONS: More pleasant than eating the leaves. Still has a bit of that acrid bitter aftertaste that can sometimes be overpowering. I find it to be “stimulating” to my head. Probably loosening up my sinuses! Summer harvested Ground Ivy seems to initially have a smoother almost moistening feel to it. I don’t find this to be astringent at all.\n\nCOMPARISON OF FRESH TINCTURE TO FRESHLY DRIED TINCTURE: I tried a 2-week trial of recently dried tinctured Ground Ivy compared to the Fresh Tincture of Ground Ivy. I found the Fresh Tincture of Ground Ivy to be superior in this aspect for lessening the mucus in the head. The fresh tincture seems to be more potent in smell and action. I think it is possibly less drying as a fresh tincture. I do believe the recently dried tincture seems to be more drying.\n\nTEA OBSERVATIONS: I was pleasantly surprised that the tea of Ground Ivy tasted good. I truly dislike the actual taste of this herb when you eat it. I was reluctant to try the tea but was pleasantly surprised it tastes good. Smells like a freshly cut lawn full of ground ivy but of course not as overpowering! It has a mild flavor grassy/minty/pungent flavor. This was 1 Tbsp of dried herb in 8oz hot water steeped for 15 min. The longer you steep it the more it resembles the actual taste/smell of the plant but is not so overpowering you want to stop drinking the tea. I find the tea to be less stimulating but will still feel it my “ears” as one way of putting it I guess. Must be “moving” fluid. I get a slight tongue-numbing sensation while drinking the tea which could be its astringent nature but still doesn’t feel astringent, however, after sipping on the tea for ½ an hour I do feel like my mouth is drying up. I feel that there is a cooling nature to this plant. I feel like it is more cooling in a diaphoretic way of opening my pores and allowing the heat to escape therefore cooling me. Sipping on the tea in the evening made me extremely tired. Could be a coincidence however I don’t remember getting tired while drinking it during the day.\n\nConsidered an invasive plant. This plant spreads like a vine on the ground and can form a large carpet. Left alone will reseed itself. It pulls up easily enough, but the roots go deeper than they seem, and it will come back from the root also, or so it seems to in my garden. It will flower at just a couple of inches if you continue to mow it. Left alone it will grow to about 1’ high. I’ve seen it as high as 1 ½ foot next to a wall.\n\n“1 - 3 ft. long. Creeping, ivy-like vine, with scallop-edged leaves, round to kidney-shaped in pairs; sometimes tinged with purple. In the shade the leaves stay green in the hot sun they will get red/rust colored on the edges. Stems square, creeping. The trailing stems root at intervals and bear downy, ivy leaves of dark green.\n\nThe flowers are blue or violet, ¼ - ½” long, in whorls of leaf axils appear in short upright branches throughout the summer”. The flower has 4 stamens.\n\nHas a strong aromatic odor when bruised or cut.\n\nLook-a-likes: If you know the smell of Ground Ivy all you need to do is rub the leaves and you know you have Ground Ivy. I find that when the plants are in flower it is much easier to tell them apart. When the plant is young it can often look like the following listed:\n\nHenbit (Lamium amplexicaule),\n\nPurple Deadnettle (Lamium purpureum) and\n\nPersian Speedwell (Veronica persica), (Smurak 2022)\n\nCommon Mallow (Malva neglecta), but this has a round stem. (Smurak 2022)\n\nHere is one of my favorite articles on Ground Ivy Look A Likes: I often get questions of “is this Ground Ivy” I send them this article. If they have been to one of my herb walks I always make everyone rub a leaf and smell it so they are able to tell by smelling.\n\nParts Used: Above ground parts. Harvest when in bloom in the spring. March - July.\n\nNOTE: I’ve used a late August tincture of this that wasn’t flowering. I still found it to be just as useful.\n\nTastes:\n\nBitter and Pungent My thoughts: Bitter flavor. Very Pungent to chew on with a very distinct taste you won’t forget. The tincture is more on the minty side and less pungent. The tea is quite pleasant, and only has a mild hint of the pungent taste. The Minty flavor comes out more in the tea.\n\nThe bitter taste is known as glechomine\n\nBitter per David Winston\n\nPer Matthew Wood it is: “acrid, bitter, “metallic” cool, dry, and aromatic\n\nEnergetics:\n\nCooling, and slightly drying. I did not initially find this to be drying however it is noted to be a drying plant? I also feel like the tincture of the fresh plant is more neutral and less drying.\n\nCold & dry per David Winston.\n\nI have one client who says within 5 min of taking the tincture or the tea she will immediately feel cold in her extremities.\n\nGerard notes this is Hot and dry.\n\nDegree of Action:\n\n2nd degree. It has been used in salad mixes but personally, I find it so pungent that one bite of the leaf ruins the whole bite of salad hence my classification of 2nd degree.\n\nFoundational Actions:\n\nAromatic, bitter.\n\nPrimary Actions:\n\nMAIN: Expectorant, diaphoretic, diuretic\n\nConstituents:\n\nMajor Active Constituents:\n\nFlavonoids: Quercetin and rutin, including cymaroside, cosmosyin, hypersoside,\n\nTerpenoids: Oleanoic acid, ursolic acid. • Volatile Oils: menthone, pulegone, pinocampone, monoterpenes.\n\n• Glechomin is the bitter principle.\n\nAmino acids: asparagic acid, glutamic acid, proline, tyrosine, valine, methionine, cysteine and serine\n\nGleheda an insecticidal lectin.\n\nSaponins\n\nPhenolic Acids: Rosmarinic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, Sinapic acid,\n\nAlso contains: genistin, ferulic acid, fatty acids, & marrubiin.\n\nSteroid: R-Sitosterol.\n\nHere is an article on the constituents of the essential oil of Ground Ivy https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10412905.2007.9699948\n\nContains (rounded): Sesquiterpines 67%, Germacrene D 21%, y-elemene 16%, phytols 16%, (Z)-β-ocimene 9%, 1,8-cineole 5%, β-ylangene 4%, germacrene B 4%,\n\nNutrition: Contains Vit C, Vit E, copper, iodine, iron, phosphorus & potassium.\n\nIt has about 49% Insoluble fiber, 17% protein, 7% soluble fiber and 1% Fat, 13% Ash and 13% other.\n\nIt has the following Macro elements Potassium being the highest, Calcium, Magnesium, Phosphorus and Sodium and Iron as the lowest. Microelements found highest to lowest are: 15 found: Ni, V, I, Pb, Cr, Mo, Mn, As, Cd, Sn, Sb, Se, Ti, Cu\n\nHistory: It’s interesting how I found more information about the historical use of Ground Ivy than of herbalists using it now. I certainly use it a lot in my practice.\n\nMost herbalists use the original name Glechoma hederacea given in 1753 by Carolus Linnaeus in the Species Plantarum. Glechoma describes a kind of mint and Hederacea means resembles Ivy. It is not a true Ivy though. In the 1800’s it was reclassified as Nepeta glechoma by George Bentham.\n\nUsed to be used to flavor beer before hops, hence its other name Alehoof and Tunhoof. It would improve the flavor. It will clarify the beer and was used as this purpose before clarifying agents came along. According to Maude Grieve, this was its general use until the reign of Henry VIII. It was the most used for brewing until Hops was introduced in England after the 16th Century.\n\nMaude also mentioned its use for nervous headaches which in all my other research I did not see mentioned, but it would make sense if the headache was due to congestion.\n\nBritish herbalist John Gerard continued the teaching of Dioscorides for its use with sciatica & eye inflammation.\n\nI haven’t found any other mention of its uses for sciatica but of note…. I used to suffer greatly from sciatic issues because I have loose ligaments. I of course use Ground Ivy on a normal basis and do not have sciatic issues anymore. Could be coincidence but I found this interesting when I ran across it in literature.\n\n“The Chinese use a closely related species (G. longitubae) to clear toxic heat for conditions such as jaundice, cystitis and to help expel urinary and biliary stones” - David Winston\n\nAlso, in Chinese medicine as tea, it is considered cooling and used to treat heat in the liver and for irregular menstruation. - Church.\n\nPer James Duke in an interview, it was also used by the Chinese to normalize menstruation.\n\nIn Italy, Ground Ivy was used for arthritis & rheumatism. - Church\n\n“The Irish used it for skin ailments, flushing the kidneys, stimulating menstruation and for blister ans sores” - James Duke\n\n“It is a gently stimulating tonic to the mucous membrane, influencing especially that of the kidneys and of the respiratory tubuli. It will be found of use in cases of chronic bronchitis and phthisis where expectoration is too free `` This herb is a mildly stimulating, tonic expectorant, chiefly influencing the respiratory organs.” - Lyle\n\n“... Ground Ivy has value as an addition to cough syrups, especially with persons who are inclined to be bilious. In hot infusion, it influences the circulation toward the surface and soothes and sustains the nervous system.” - Lyle\n\n“This herb is a popular family remedy and is sometimes used by the profession; though the marvelous repute it once enjoyed in England, has very properly faded away. Water extracts from it a mild bitter quality, slightly stimulating, and associated with very little mucilage. The lungs are chiefly influenced by it, and expectoration gently promoted, a fair tonic impression being left behind. Such an action fits it for use in sub-acute coughs, with debility, and it will be found of service in such cases. The kidneys receive a portion of its influence, and it will relieve aching and catarrhal discharges of the bladder. Old Dr. Culpepper, of England, used to state Ground Ivy – Glechoma hederacea by Mindy Capello RH with HerbaRemedium.com that it would cure jaundice, asthma, hypochondria, and even mania; but this reputation is too fabulous to be entertained, though it points to the fact that this article will mildly open the gall ducts, and allay irritability and impart tone to the nervous system. It is rarely used for anything but coughs of the milder class. An infusion of an ounce to a quart of hot water, well pressed and strained, may be sweetened (with honey, if desirable) and given in doses of two fluid ounces every second hour; or a sirup may be made of it at the rate of two and a half pounds to the gallon.” - The Physiomedical Dispensatory, 1869, William Cook\n\nHas a history of being used to prevent or cure scurvy, probably due to its high vitamin C content.\n\nHill in the 1812 Family herbal said it is good for disorders of the kidneys & against bloody & foul urine.\n\nMatthew Wood Noted that Dr. John Quincy commented in the 1736 London Pharmacopoeia that it is “mightily used both in the Shops and common Prescriptions” and is “prescribed in almost all Distempers of the Lungs”\n\nNative American Use: by the Cherokee per the naeb.brit.org site. Cold, babies’, hives, and measles.\n\nOverview of Use:\n\nGreat for any congestion in the head particularly the ears or ear infections.\n\nLung tonic for hot & damp coughs or conditions.\n\nCarminative for heat in the digestive system\n\nMild Potassium-sparing Urinary Tonic\n\nExtensive Use:\n\nOTHER ACTIONS:\n\nAbortifacient, analgesic, carminative, cholagogue, depurative, emmenagogue, hepatoprotective, hypoglycemic, hypotensive, lymphatic, pectoral, stimulant stomachic, urinary tonic.\n\nSecondary Actions: analgesic, anticatarrhal, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, antiscorbutic, antioxidant, antiviral,\n\nDavid Hoffman has it listed as an astringent, and tonic. Also, Anti-catarrhal, expectorant, diuretic, vulnerary\n\nTYPE OF PERSON THIS IS BEST FOR:\n\nPer Mathew Wood this is good for someone with a beef-steak tongue, or it looks like chopped meat in the middle, or where heat is “disorganizing the tissues”. Someone who has cancer to help prolong life.\n\nRESPIRATORY SYSTEM:\n\nAs an expectorant for any congestion in the face particularly congestion or fluid in the ears. Can be helpful for ear infections, or anything to do with the middle ear or deep congestion you know is there, but they can still breath out their nose.\n\nCongestion that can cause dizziness.\n\nLung tonic for asthma, congestion, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Hot and damp coughs. It could be useful in supporting those with COPD and those quitting smoking.\n\nPer Maude Grieves and James Duke the juice was used in the nostrils for headaches, and coughs. How this was actually applied I did not read about.\n\nPer David Hoffman, this works better if combined with other remedies for coughs and bronchitis. Of note: I’ve used this as a single for ear congestion with great results.\n\nDiaphoretic can be helpful for fever or “spasms resulting from fever” per Matthew Wood.\n\nMatthew Wood discovered by himself and Lisa Wolff, herbalist (AHG) that any chronic respiratory congestion where the problem began with blockage in the Eustachian tubes. An example: Wood noted a chronic bronchitis case of a 56yr old where she said it started after having a middle ear infection at the age of eight. After a month and a half of Ground Ivy, her bronchitis cleared up and hadn’t returned in 5 years.\n\nAnother example Wood ran across was from Donald Law who noted “The juice can be used to wash out the ears”\n\nPer Matthew Wood, he also notes that Lise Wolff adds there “might be a kidney weakness associated with this pattern”\n\nI myself have noted kidney weakness and had struggled with bronchitis 2-3x/year until I became an herbalist and started using Ground Ivy on a regular basis. There might be something to this. I wish more herbalists wrote about this and used.\n\nDIGESTIVE SYSTEM:\n\nColic in babies or intestinal cramping & gas.\n\nIts mild astringency could help with diarrhea and gastritis.\n\nFor hyperacidity.\n\nFor heat in the digestive system.\n\nIncrease bile secretion & movement of the gall bladder sphincter.\n\nMay help relieve jaundice.\n\nMatthew Wood notes that Alma Hutchins used this for the digestive system starting at the mouth as a gargle for sores in the mouth, for gas pains, and in jaundice from stoppage of the Gallbladder or liver.\n\nENDOCRINE SYSTEM:\n\nPer Matthew Wood noting from Alma Hutchins, it can be helpful for premature aging. This is the only mention of premature aging I’ve heard.\n\nIMMUNE SYSTEM:\n\nThe Oleanolic acid and myrtenol in this plant make it useful as an antimalarial.\n\nNoted to be antibacterial.\n\nUseful as a diaphoretic to bring down fevers as a hot infusion.\n\nLYMPHATIC SYSTEM:\n\nHelp move congested lymph or congested spleen per Matthew Wood from Alma Hutchins.\n\nParticularly works well for the lymph in the neck.\n\nSince lymphatics and diuretics go well together its nice that Ground Ivy is also a diuretic.\n\nKatja Swift notated this would work well for mastitis also combined with Violet and/or Red Clover. I’ve used my Ground Ivy/Violet combo blend for mastitis, and it works well.\n\nURINARY SYSTEM:\n\nUrinary tonic.\n\nA mild potassium-sparing diuretic\n\nused as a tea can be good for cystitis, inflammation, and Urinary tract infections.\n\nCan also be beneficial for the kidneys and those with gout.\n\nPer Mathew Wood “Bloody and foul urine”\n\nDetoxify the Kidneys.\n\nOTHER USES:\n\nTINNITUS: for those who have congested ears and noise-induced tinnitus. Henriette uses this herb exclusively for Noise-induce tinnitus in tea form, until the noise stops. According to her and many others it could and tends to take months to work.\n\nI find that considering the above use for tinnitus that Katja Swift notates that if you have a difficult time listening or hearing others in communication this can be a helpful herb also. Maybe something is blocking you from hearing someone and this helps open up that communication.\n\nREMOVE HEAVY METALS: Lead Poisoning: Matthew Wood and David Winston have both talked about using this for lead poisoning.\n\nMatthew Wood also noted in The Earthwise Herbal that Kate Gilday has confirmed this use in practice\n\nAlso, could be helpful in removing mercury & aluminum.\n\nJim McDonald noted that he has actually seen research on this where there is increased lead secreted out in urine for those with lead poisoning.\n\nJames Duke noted its use in an interview also for lead poisoning.\n\nCongestion of the head in general. Head colds, congestion anywhere in the face particularly the ears.\n\nHEADACHES: Its use was noted by Matthew Wood that Alma Hutchins wrote about its use with Headaches. David Hoffman mentions it in a list of herbs for headaches.\n\nKatja Swift notates that this is great for those with a headache from pressure or heaviness. She also notes that “if you’re a phlegmatic or kapha type this could be your standard, recurrent headache pattern” and to try Ground Ivy.\n\nIn this article here, it notes that the smelling of the pressed leaves can relieve headaches. My conjecture would be a headache of a stuffy nature.\n\nCANCER: Per Matthew Wood, it is traditionally used for cancer. He noted it gets some growths on the plant later in the season, which is damage to the plant by insects. (I’ve observed these growths - they look like green sacks) In this instance, he considers an indication for it for cancer especially when the “tongue looks like chopped meat in the middle” In an Interview with James Duke he noted its use for different cancers\n\nThe Ursolic acid and oleanolic acid isolates have been studied for inhibiting tumors in mice.\n\nTOPICAL APPLICATIONS:\n\nEyes: applied topically to the eyes can relieve conjunctivitis, itchy eyes, tiredness, and styes. Per Lyle, an eye wash of Chelidonium Maj (green root) Glechoma hederacea & Chrysanthemum equal parts can be used for inflammation of the eyes, conjunctivitis, scaly eruptions & gonorrheal ophthalmia.\n\nEars: as an infused oil to rub on the ear canals and or face to get congestion moving. See below for how to make.\n\nFor bruises, wounds, sprains, or infections to dispel blood stasis or swelling.\n\nSkin: for hot itchy conditions tea is applied. Add to the bath as an emollient it softens skin. It also has a sedative, calming effect.\n\nMastitis: I use this infused along with Violet oil and Pine EO for mastitis.\n\nAbscesses combined with Yarrow & Chamomile - Maude Grieve.\n\nSoothe stings from Nettle\n\nAs an insect repellent. The pulegone in Ground Ivy is an insect repellant.\n\nDrawing agent for “old green wounds” per Culpepper I’ve never tried this but am interested in this, considering Ground Ivy comes out before Plantain does.\n\nESSENTIAL OIL OF GROUND IVY:\n\nBeing that its an aromatic plant I did search to see if anyone made an essential oil of this plant. I do wonder how just smelling this plant would benefit the sinuses.\n\nThis was all I found\n\nCombines well with:\n\nAgrimony for the kidneys.\n\nWhite Horehound, and Elecampane for coughs.\n\nGoldenrod for Sinus congestion\n\nViolet for moving the lymph.\n\nStudies:\n\nAnimal study, that could show liver protective aspects of Glechoma.

I just wilt mine for a day or 2 until most of it is closer to the crispy side versus the soft side.\n\nChop extremely well and cover with Oil. ▪ I always try to stay under a 1:5 ratio and generally end up with around a 1:4 ratio for my oil.\n\nI have done a 1:3 ratio just stirring the oil very often. It wasn’t quite covered.\n\nI’ve never used the alcohol intermediary here and don’t feel it is necessary, although I’m sure it would result in a stronger oil. I chop mine extremely well and that seems to suffice for breaking down the cell walls.\n\nHeat for 24 hrs on low with the lid off so moisture can escape ▪ I use a yogurt maker or Instapot with a yogurt setting.\n\nStrain and let the oil sit for 1 week covered.\n\nI then pour the oil into another jar, being careful to note any globs that might be near the bottom. This is probably water because if there is any moisture in the oil it will have settled to the bottom of the jar.\n\nA song about Ground Ivy HERE ON YOUTUBE By Rachel Lambert\n\nYou can read the lyrics here\n\nPOEM:\n\nWhen Charlie comes a creepin’\n\nYou’ll be meetin’ a new friend,\n\nAnd he’ll be true to you, ya know,\n\nNot kept away by winter snow:\n\nHe’ll be comin’ back to sow,\n\nThe seeds of friendship that will grow,\n\nWithin our hearts and keep us lively,\n\n‘Cause Creepin’ Charlie, aint just any ivy!\n\nPoem By Thea Summer Deer\n\nReprinted with permission Ground Ivy – Glechoma hederacea by Mindy Capello RH with HerbaRemedium.com\n\nRecipes:\n\nMy Recipe for “Lymph on the Move” Oil Ground Ivy Oil - 120ml\n\nViolet Leaf Oil - 120ml\n\nCalendula Oil - 120ml\n\nPeppermint Essential Oil - 12 drops\n\nPine Essential Oil - 12 drops ▪ Combine all, add to roller ball jars and apply along the ear canals. For congested ears. ▪ I also find this very helpful for a lymph face massage or sinus massage for congested sinuses.\n\nI also find this very useful for the lymph congestion that can happen at the base of the neck. Rubbing this there will eleviate the knots that get at the base of the neck.\n\nNote: my Violet oil is made the same way that the ground ivy is made. This though is a tendency to mold easier and I’ve learned to really make sure the violet leaf is crispy before making into an oil. My calendula oil is just made from dried Calendula.\n\nTo make this into a “Lymph on the Move” salve: ▪ 270ml of the above oil\n\n300g of Shea Butter or Cocoa Butter\n\nWarm the shea butter until mostly melted add the above oil.\n\nRemove from heat and pour into tins/jars and refrigerate.\n\nYou can add more shea butter if you like your salves/balms to be thicker. I like mine to be soft.\n\nGROUND IVY IN BEER! I ran across a lot of Ground Ivy and Yarrow together in Herbal Beers. Must be a good combo.\n\nIf I were a beer maker I’d certainly make this… it sounds amazingly healthy! ▪ https://www.ediblewildfood.com/belgium-wild-beer.aspx\n\nNoted on an article here on Herbal Brewing the Ground Ivy in Britain is more bitter that the Ground Ivy Here\n\nHere are some other Beer recipes with Ground Ivy in it: ▪ https://www.herbalbrewing.com/2012/06/26/ground-ivy-gruit-ale/\n\nhttps://www.themadfermentationist.com/2017/09/backyard-gruit-alehoof-and-yarrow.html\n\nhttps://brewgr.com/recipe/72550/ground-ivy-gruit-ale-american-porter-recipe\n\nGround Ivy Vinegar: Chopped fresh ground Ivy Covered with Apple Cider Vinegar.

Add to salads or take for the mineral content.\n\nGround Ivy Salad Dressing: https://www.ediblewildfood.com/ground-ivy-dressing.aspx\n\nWound salve Recipe here: https://thedruidsgarden.com/2015/11/20/backyard-healing-salve-recipe-with-plantain-chickweed-and-ground-ivy/\n\nHere is a recipe for Salsa Verde: https://kitchenandotherstories.com/salsa-verde-recipe-with-wild-greens/\n\nAuthor | Mindy Capello\n\nI’m a Christian Registered RH (AHG) Clinical Herbalist in the Bellevue/Omaha, NE area.
