        "text": "Catarrh is a build-up of mucus in an airway or cavity in your body, such as the sinuses, nose and throat1. It’s often temporary and can be caused by a cold, infection, nasal polyps, hay fever and other allergies2\n\nPost nasal drip is commonly associated with catarrh. This is when excess mucus drips from the back of the nose into the throat. The two have similar symptoms, causes and treatments3\n\nCatarrh isn’t harmful, but it can be irritating if mucus in your throat won’t go away and you’re constantly trying to clear it4. Decongestants and other treatments can help provide relief from these uncomfortable symptoms5.\n\nLearn more about what catarrh is, its causes, symptoms and treatments.\n\nDepending on where the mucus builds up, it may also lead to an ear or sinus infection8.\n\nSome other common catarrh symptoms can include9:\n\nA blocked, stuffy and/or runny nose.\n\nHeadache and/or pains in your face.\n\nIt feels like mucus is stuck in your throat and running down the back.\n\nA reduced sense of smell and taste.\n\nTemporary hearing loss and a crackling in your ear.\n\nSore, scratchy throat with a hoarse voice10.\n\nWhile some of these symptoms can overlap with other conditions, if it feels like mucus is stuck in your throat, nose and chest and you don’t have any other signs of a common cold or allergies, it may be due to catarrh or post nasal drip.\n\nWhat is post nasal drip?\n\nPost nasal drip is when your body produces thicker mucus than normal or more of it, and you can notice it running down the back of your nose and into your throat12.\n\nMucus production is perfectly healthy, as the glands in your nose, throat and airways produce it to moisten these areas and get rid of bacteria and viruses before they can cause an infection13.\n\nNormally, a small amount of mucus mixed with saliva drips down your throat and you swallow it without realising14. But if you feel like you have constant phlegm in your throat, then it may be a sign of post nasal drip.\n\nSymptoms of post nasal drip can include15:\n\nConstantly clearing your throat of mucus.\n\nCoughing that won’t go away and gets worse at night.\n\nA hoarse, sore and scratchy throat.\n\nBad breath.\n\nNausea from excess mucus.\n\nWhat causes post nasal drip?\n\nThe causes of post nasal drip are similar to those of catarrh. These include allergies, a viral infection (such as a cold or flu) and sinus infections16. Certain foods, cold temperatures, weather changes and dry air can also trigger it.\n\nSometimes excess mucus isn’t the cause of post nasal drip. It can also be because throat or nose can’t drain and clear regular mucus production properly. This could be due to a deviated septum, problems swallowing or gastric reflux17.\n\nCatarrh and post nasal drip treatment\n\nAs the symptoms of post nasal drip and catarrh are similar, many of the same treatments can help to ease them. Some potential treatments include19:\n\nAvoiding triggers for your catarrh and post nasal drip symptoms – such as allergens and smoky environments.\n\nSipping cold water rather than coughing, as throat clearing could make symptoms worse.\n\nUsing a saline nasal rinse, such as SUDAFED® Natural Relief Spray, a few times each day – or creating your own by putting half a teaspoon of salt in a pint of boiling water, then leaving to cool before rinsing your nose with it.\n\nStaying away from warm, dry atmospheres where possible – such as rooms with air conditioning or close to car heaters.\n\nPlacing plants or bowls of water in warm, dry rooms where you spend a lot of time to increase the humidity.\n\nKeeping well hydrated throughout the day.\n\nIf you experience chronic catarrh that lasts for a few months or longer, or it becomes hard to live with, then speak to your GP20. They may identify an underlying cause, such as nasal polyps or allergies, and refer you for specialist treatment21.\n\nYou should also seek medical attention if your catarrh or post nasal drip symptoms include22:\n\nA high fever.\n\nMucus that contains blood or has a foul smell.\n\nWheezing and shortness of breath.\n\nCommon triggers and causes of post nasal drip and catarrh can include:\n\nThe common cold , flu and other viral infections.\n\nHay fever and allergies to dust, pet dander and other common allergens.\n\nSinus infection or sinusitis .\n\nNon-allergic rhinitis.\n\nNasal polyps.\n\nThere are also other potential causes of post nasal drip and catarrh that aren’t related to infections or allergies. These may include24:\n\nHormone changes during puberty, pregnancy or from using oral contraceptives.\n\nEnvironmental factors such as weather changes, being surrounded by smoke, fumes, smog and pollution.\n\nProblems with nasal structure such as a deviated septum, which can cause problems with mucus drainage.\n\nCertain spicy foods that increase mucus production.\n\nThe exact causes of chronic catarrh aren’t clear. Medical experts don’t believe they’re related to allergies or infection, instead it could be due to an increased sensitivity to mucus or if it travels abnormally within the nose25.\n\nResearch has shown foods that cause catarrh can include30:\n\nDairy products – milk, cheese, yogurt, ice cream, butter and eggs.\n\nBreads, pasta and cereal.\n\nFruit and vegetables – bananas, cabbage, potatoes.\n\nCorn and corn products.\n\nSoy products.\n\nSweets and desserts.\n\nDrinks – tea, coffee, soda and alcoholic beverages.\n\nRed meat.\n\nJust as there are foods that are thought to cause catarrh, there are also various foods and drinks that could help reduce your mucus production31.\n\nWhether you want to prevent catarrh coming on or cut your mucus production to relieve symptoms, these foods may help32:\n\nFish – salmon, tuna, sardines and flounder.\n\nFruits – grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, pumpkin (and pumpkin seeds).\n\nRoots – celery, ginger, onion and garlic.\n\nWatercress.\n\nPickles.\n\nHoney or agar.\n\nCayenne pepper.\n\nChamomile.\n\nOlive oil.\n\nBroth.\n\nDecaffeinated tea"
