        "text": "What is bronchitis?\n\nBronchitis is an inflammation of the airways leading into your lungs.\n\nWhen your airways (trachea and bronchi) get irritated, they swell up and fill with mucus, causing you to cough. Your cough can last days to a couple of weeks. It’s the main symptom of bronchitis.\n\nViruses are the most common cause of acute bronchitis. Smoke and other irritants can cause acute and chronic bronchitis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\n\nWhat are the types of bronchitis?\n\nWhen people talk about bronchitis, they usually mean acute bronchitis, a temporary condition that makes you cough. Some people get bronchitis so often that it’s considered chronic bronchitis.\n\nAcute bronchitis\n\nAcute bronchitis is usually caused by a viral infection and goes away on its own in a few weeks. Most people don’t need treatment for acute bronchitis.\n\nChronic bronchitis\n\nYou have chronic bronchitis if you have a cough with mucus most days of the month for three months out of the year. This goes on for at least two years.\n\nIf you have chronic bronchitis, you may have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Ask your provider about whether you should get tested for COPD.\n\nWho does bronchitis affect?\n\nAnyone can get bronchitis, but you’re at higher risk if you:\n\nSmoke or are around someone who does.\n\nHave asthma, COPD or other breathing conditions.\n\nHave GERD (chronic acid reflux).\n\nHave an autoimmune disorder or other illness that causes inflammation.\n\nAre around air pollutants (like smoke or chemicals).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow does bronchitis affect my body?\n\nWhen your airways are irritated, your immune system causes them to swell up and fill with mucus. You cough to try to clear the mucus out. As long as there’s mucus or inflammation in your airways, you’ll keep coughing.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of bronchitis?\n\nA persistent cough that lasts one to three weeks is the main symptom of bronchitis. You usually bring up mucus when you cough with bronchitis, but you might get a dry cough instead. You might also hear a whistling or rattling sound when you breathe (wheezing).\n\nYou might have other symptoms, including:\n\nShortness of breath (dyspnea).\n\nFever.\n\nRunny nose.\n\nTiredness (fatigue).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat causes bronchitis?\n\nYou almost always get bronchitis from a virus. However, nearly anything that irritates your airways can cause it. Infectious and noninfectious causes of bronchitis include:\n\nViruses. Viruses that cause bronchitis include influenza (the flu), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, rhinovirus (the common cold) and coronavirus.\n\nBacteria. Bacteria that cause bronchitis include Bordetella pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia pneumonia.\n\nPollution.\n\nSmoking cigarettes or marijuana (cannabis).\n\nHow do you get bronchitis?\n\nYou get bronchitis when your airways swell up and fill with mucus. You can get the viruses and bacteria that cause bronchitis from close contact (shaking hands, hugging, touching the same surfaces) with someone who has them. You don’t have to have bronchitis yourself to pass on a virus to someone else who ends up with bronchitis.\n\nOther irritants, like tobacco or pollutants, are in the air you breathe.\n\nIs bronchitis contagious?\n\nBronchitis itself — inflammation of your airways — isn’t contagious, but the viruses and bacteria that can cause it are. For instance, if you’re sick with the flu, you might get bronchitis too. But when your friend gets the flu from you, their airways don’t get inflamed like yours did.\n\nIs bronchitis a side effect of COVID-19?\n\nYou can get bronchitis with almost any virus, including SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The symptoms of bronchitis can be similar to COVID-19, so make sure you get tested to know which one you have. There haven’t been any studies that show that COVID-19 is any more likely to cause bronchitis than other viral illnesses.\n\nHow is bronchitis treated?\n\nAcute bronchitis is usually not treated with medications. If you have the flu and your symptoms started within the past two days, your provider may prescribe antivirals to help it go away faster.\n\nSince bronchitis is almost never caused by bacteria, antibiotics won’t help you get better and might even make you feel worse.\n\nWhat medications are used to treat bronchitis?\n\nYour healthcare provider probably won’t prescribe medications to treat your bronchitis. In some cases, you can use medications to help you with symptoms or to treat the underlying cause, including:\n\nAntiviral medications. If your bronchitis is caused by the flu, your healthcare provider might prescribe an antiviral medication, like Tamiflu®, Relenza® and Rapivab®. If you start taking antivirals quickly after your symptoms start, you might feel better sooner.\n\nBronchodilators. Your provider might prescribe a bronchodilator (a drug that helps open your airways) if you’re having trouble breathing.\n\nAnti-inflammatory medications. Your doctor might prescribe corticosteroids and other medications to reduce inflammation.\n\nCough suppressants. Over-the-counter or prescription cough suppressants (antitussives) may help with a nagging cough. This includes dextromethorphan (Robitussin®, DayQuil™, PediaCare®) and benzonatate (Tessalon Perles®, Zonatuss™).\n\nAntibiotics. It’s very unlikely that you’ll be treated with antibiotics for bronchitis, unless your healthcare provider thinks you have a bacterial infection.\n\nCOPD/asthma treatment. If you have COPD or asthma, your provider may use additional medications or breathing treatments for chronic bronchitis.\n\nShould I take antibiotics for bronchitis?\n\nNo, taking antibiotics won’t help you get over bronchitis in most cases. Antibiotics are used to destroy bacteria that make you sick. Bronchitis is caused by a virus 95% of the time. Antibiotics don’t help you get rid of a virus.\n\nHow do I manage the symptoms of bronchitis?\n\nYou can manage the symptoms of bronchitis at home with over-the-counter medicines and rest. Running a humidifier or taking warm showers can help loosen mucus and make breathing easier.\n\nYou can use ibuprofen (Advil®, Motrin®) or acetaminophen (Tylenol®) to help with the aches and pains that come with a viral infection.\n\nHow long are you contagious if you have acute bronchitis?\n\nBronchitis itself isn’t contagious, but some of its causes are. If your bronchitis is caused by a virus, you can be contagious for a few days to a week. If your bronchitis is caused by bacteria, you usually stop being contagious 24 hours after starting antibiotics.\n\nOther causes of bronchitis aren’t contagious.\n\nWhat’s the outlook for bronchitis?\n\nAcute bronchitis usually isn’t serious. While frustrating, you have to wait out the symptoms for a few weeks. If you’re living with a heart condition or another breathing condition, like asthma, it could make your symptoms worse or last longer.\n\nChronic bronchitis can be a serious condition and might mean you have lung damage. While the damage can’t be reversed, your provider can help you manage your symptoms and have fewer flare-ups.\n\nComplications of bronchitis\n\nIf you have an ongoing condition like asthma, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or heart failure, bronchitis might make it worse (exacerbation). Tell your healthcare provider if you have any ongoing conditions.\n\nCan bronchitis go away on its own?\n\nYes, acute bronchitis usually goes away on its own. It’s almost always caused by a virus, and you can’t get rid of most viruses with medicine. You can treat the symptoms at home while you wait for the inflammation to go down.\n\nBronchitis caused by something else may need treatment to help it go away. Chronic bronchitis usually doesn’t go away completely, but can get better with treatment.\n\nHow long does it take to get over bronchitis?\n\nMost people get over bronchitis in about two weeks, but it might take as long as three to six weeks. You can manage your symptoms at home with over-the-counter medicines while you get better. If you don’t feel better after three weeks, see your healthcare provider.\n\nWhat’s the difference between bronchitis and pneumonia?\n\nBronchitis is an inflammation of the airways leading to the lungs. Pneumonia is an inflammation of the lungs themselves.\n\nBronchitis causes inflammation and mucus in your trachea and bronchi that make you cough a lot. Pneumonia causes inflammation and fluid in the small sacs in your lungs (alveoli) that makes it hard to breathe. You also usually have a cough and a fever. Pneumonia is more serious than bronchitis.\n\nWhile you could have an infection that causes both, bronchitis doesn’t usually turn into pneumonia.\n\nWhat’s the difference between bronchitis and bronchiolitis?\n\nBronchitis is inflammation in the larger airways (trachea and bronchi) coming into the lungs. Bronchiolitis is an inflammation of the next smaller airways (bronchioles) that come off of the bronchi. Children usually get bronchiolitis while adults get bronchitis.\n\nIs menthol vapor rub good for bronchitis?\n\nYou might use vapor rubs, like Vicks VapoRub® or Mentholatum® ointment, for anything that ails you and wonder if they work for bronchitis. Vapor rubs have ingredients in them intended to calm down coughs, so they may help your bronchitis symptoms. Don’t use vapor rubs on children under two without asking your pediatrician first.\n\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\n\nHaving bronchitis can be frustrating at best. Even once you’re free of a runny nose and body aches, the cough seems to last forever. Over-the-counter medicines and even home remedies, like honey, can help get you through until you feel better. If you’re having trouble managing your symptoms, talk to your healthcare provider.\n\nIf you frequently have bronchitis, you may have chronic bronchitis caused by an underlying condition that needs to be treated."
