        "text": "I finally made music in Montpellier.\n\nMusic in French, that is.\n\nBefore I’d left for France, I’d learned a few French songs – including the classic, “Après un Rêve,” by Fauré. My French was virtually nonexistent at that point, but despite that considerable shortcoming I wanted to sing in French. I was helped greatly by my friend Steve Blier, a tremendous musician who’s a vocal coach at Juilliard and who runs the New York Festival of Song, and who sometimes doesn’t mind making music with me. He’s a remarkable accompanist whose musicality confers a greater proficiency on untutored singers like me. I almost sound as if I know what I’m doing when I sing with him.\n\nSteve’s French is good, and as someone who coaches many young singers in chansons françaises, he’s also very much a stickler for correct French pronunciation. He worked diligently with me on my faulty accent when I began to learn the famous Fauré song, and his careful corrections undoubtedly helped my spoken French sound better when I finally arrived in France to learn the language.\n\nAlthough I’m not a professional singer by a long shot, I can and do sing, and as I learned to speak French and absorbed French culture, I also wanted to embrace its song while in France.\n\nI got that chance for the first time in Montpellier, a few months after my arrival in France, thanks to my friend Gilles, a professor of French linguistics. He’d invited me to spend the weekend at his home in Montpellier’s old city, on the Rue de l’Ancien Courrier, so narrow you feel you can touch the facing apartment. The stones on the street, polished over centuries, amplify the slightest whisper.\n\nGilles is also an amateur pianist, and his neighbors probably know his playing well. I wanted to avail myself of his pianistic willingness, and so we set about finding some songs to sing.\n\nDuring a morning stroll, we stopped in a music store near his apartment, and I bought him a collection of Kurt Weill, selections from “Porgy and Bess” and, for myself, the sheet music for “Air de la Lettre,” from the 1925 operetta Mozart, with lyrics by Sacha Guitry after a letter of Mozart’s. I didn’t know it, but it looked intriguing and I figured I could make a go of it.\n\nThe show had been a big success in its day, and this lovely, delicate morsel was made famous, Gilles told me, by the singer Yvonne Printemps, who was married at the time to Guitry. Gilles and I worked our way through “Air de la Lettre” that afternoon, as I began to grasp the contours of its melody, my booming tenor bouncing through the open windows, off of the facing walls on that hot June day .\n\nWe also sang Kurt Weill’s “Je ne t’aime pas,” after I’d spent a few minutes learning it (it was easier than the Hahn). Gilles actually knew it better in its German version – he’d performed it with a German friend of his a few years before. I loved singing it in French (it sat well on my voice), and was thrilled I could actually get through it without having to worry about whether I was getting the sense of what I was singing (that came later). Sometimes you just have to charge ahead regardless, without shame at your incompetence.\n\nI noticed that the next day, when Gilles took part in amateur music-making at a friend’s house: everyone forged ahead, regardless of individual skill. The willingness was all.\n\nMany Sunday afternoons Gilles joins in an amateur musical gathering at the home of his friend Vincent Bioulès, a good painter and an enthusiastic violinist. Every week Bioulès opens his beautiful home on the outskirts of the downtown area – a five-minute walk from the opera house – to his musician friends, and about a dozen or so string players of varying skill gather to make music.\n\nI was on the outside looking in, as I often was during those first few months in France. I couldn’t quite yet participate in conversations but I contented myself to observe, to listen, to absorb. I sat on a couch in the adjoining room and watched the group gather itself into a sort of ad hoc ensemble on chairs arranged into a circle in a space that held not only a grand piano (a beautiful Bechstein) but a harpsichord and a glass-fronted cabinet containing several violins, each ripe for the plucking. Bioulès distributed music to the musicians (he has a trove of scores; his family is musical; his father helped establish an orchestra in Montpellier), and the players settled themselves, their music stands positioned just so. Gilles was at the harpsichord.\n\nThey played Bach and Vivaldi, and just as I had tried the day before to work my way through the Reynaldo Hahn song, the musicians here attempted a Mendelssohn sinfonia. There were quite a few false starts, awkward tempo changes, many missed cues, but the group soldiered on. It seemed to me to be a throwback to an earlier era of music-making, when every home had a piano and every child in a middle-class family studied an instrument. It was also something else: a gathering of eager friends.\n\nThe sound wasn’t quite up to the level of a professional orchestra, of course — how could it be? — despite the presence of a few professional players. But what it lacked in finesse it made up for in warmth and even joy. I loved being there listening to music the way it might have sounded eons ago when people actually actively played rather than merely taking it in while others did the work. I loved the kindness among the musicians, between the amateurs and the professionals. I was a stranger who couldn’t participate, but I was welcomed nonetheless. It was like my journey into French: hesitant, determined, faulty but in a way fearless.\n\nMusically speaking it was probably bad. But it was also perfect. The flaws made the gathering more special somehow, almost heavenly. If heaven is a place where the strings sound a little sour and the beat tends to wander. If heaven is a place inhabited by amateur musicians who gather to express themselves without dreading failure, but despite it.\n\nFor a few hours on a steamy Sunday, it felt like heaven to me.\n\nWhenever I arrive in Paris, I expect to find two things: That more people will be smoking here than in New York, and that it will be just as noisy as it is in Manhattan.\n\nYou sort of get used to the smoky air in Paris, and of walking behind someone who leaves a trail of cigarette fumes in his wake. Although I never smoked, during my drinking days I spent too many hours in dank bars inhaling noxious fumes to complain now about people smoking on the street.\n\nBut I’m still trying to acclimate myself to Parisian noise. I find Paris to be as noisy as or even noisier than New York. It might be a matter of perspective: I’m accustomed to le bruit new-yorkais. But Parisian noise is another thing. Noise is part of any city’s metropolitan texture, and it’s different depending on the city. The constant hubbub of New York is not the punctuating din of Paris.\n\nAt restaurants, Parisians generally speak rather softly to each other, since it isn’t the custom to have music playing while people dine, and tables are often jammed up against each other, so you learn to modulate your voice and not put someone else into a position of eavesdropping on your conversation. Certain things must remain private in public. By contrast, at many New York restaurants, the music is so loud you can’t hear what your table-mates say, let alone the folks seated at near you.\n\nBut outside of restaurants, Paris expects you to put up with an intrusion of noise. But Parisians are sensitive to sounds outside their purview too.\n\nI dined at a neighbor’s apartment in Paris not too long ago with her and her two children. Her college-age son Alexander had just returned with her from a brief stay in Manhattan. He didn’t like New York at all. Too much racket, he told me, with the hostile assurance of a young man who knows what he knows and doesn’t stand to be contradicted (or to think about context – he loved to play bass-heavy music at the highest volume whenever his mother wasn’t around). Paris is much more calm, he said.\n\nActually, it’s not. Now, New York isn’t quiet by any means, as anyone knows who lives near a building construction sight, a roadwork project or a bar. But Paris, apart from its sleepy Sunday mornings – at least if you don’t live near open-air markets that do business then – is equally loud or louder.\n\nStreets in Paris are narrower than those in Manhattan, so you’re up against the source of the ruckus. Commotion can seem closer than it is. Sounds jounce between buildings and then take up residence in your apartment.\n\nYou hear drilling and hammering and salutations and arguments and even babies crying incessently (the French seem to let babies carry on wailing until they finally exhaust themselves into temporary silence).\n\nYou hear the clack of heels on sidewalks, the obnoxious vroom of motorcycles roaring down streets (there are thousands upon thousands of motorcycles in Paris), even the catarrhal purring of cars maneuvering into tight parking spots.\n\nYou hear the clanking cutlery of other people’s dinner parties, the clink of glasses at soirées across the street, the shrieks from down the block of impromptu gatherings of friends who bellow at each other over competing playlists or screech responses to shouted questions as they smoke at open windows well into the wee hours.\n\nYou hear what’s being ordered for dinner or drinks at the restaurant a few doors away, or what just happened during the meal when smokers step outside for a puff.\n\nAnd you really can’t complain. The French pretty much fight for their right to party.\n\nOne evening, around midnight, as I was leaving a dinner at my friends’ Renaud and Odette, I heard the sudden blare of music and a piercing squeal of voices from across the street as a fête sprang up in the apartment that faced theirs across the street, about 10 yards away.\n\nI asked Renaud, “Isn’t it a bit late for that?”\n\n“You can’t blame them for wanting to enjoy themselves,” Renaud said, shrugging, resigned to having that night’s sleep disturbed by his neighbors.\n\nIn France, you’re expected to put up with the inconsiderate cacophony of nearby residents. They have a right to annoy you, and they expect you to leave them in peace while they do it.\n\nIt might be a reason that double-insulated windows are so popular here. Not only do they protect against the cold, but they insulate you from the clamor of the people you’re forced to live beside. It’s the cost of city life, perhaps.\n\n“Les villes sont le gouffre de l’espèce humain,” wrote Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Cities are the abyss of the human species.\n\nI don’t agree, even as realize I’m sometimes too sensitive to noise to be fully urbanized or to forgive the festivities of obnoxious neighbors, despite being much more a city than a country person, having grown up in New York. It may be one of the many reasons I find Paris so comfortable – it’s like New York, but smaller and slower.\n\nJust not necessarily quieter.\n\nThere’s French cheese and French cheesiness. Arena-rock musicals are like overripe camembert. And I fell under the pungent swoon of one not long after my arrival, a delicious travesty about the life of Mozart – Mozart as preening, tortured rock star.\n\nEuropeans, I discovered, have a liking for dramatic arena spectacles – musicals on a grand scale that are like a narrative derived from Eurovision Contest runners-up – and I wanted to see why they’re so popular. The European rock opera was far from what I was used to both in terms of musical theater and rock concerts. I didn’t know if I’d be able to understand the appeal, but I was determined to see for myself.\n\nThe posters for Mozart: l’Opéra Rock – in which a pouty cast poses like faded Fragonard swains via a German television approximation of New York’s East Village circa Rent – lined metro stations in the months just after my arrival. It was playing a return engagement at Stade de France, where it had run the year before. I convinced two of my friends from Alliance Française to accompany me – safety in numbers for a stadium-sized musical. Teenage girls and their parents made up 70% of the audience – a little older than that for a boy-band concert – and I could recognize one or two of the songs that I heard small groups of girls singing as they filed to their seats (I’d bought the “cast album” to acquaint myself with the score beforehand).\n\nIt’s a curious blend of biography and spectacle – short on biography, heavy on smoke and Adam Ant-style “new wave” costuming: leather pants, headbands and mascara. (The performers looked as period-inappropriate as you’d have expected.) All courtesy of Dove Attia and Albert Cohen, who’ve produced other successful (at least in terms of audience appeal) pop-music extravaganzas such as The Ten Commandments and The Sun King. Their newest concerns the legend of King Arthur (and it stars the same singer-actor whom I saw play Salieri).\n\nThis show’s Mozart, played by an Italian actor Mikelangelo Loconte, had the air of a louche 1980s rock star. This Mozart really, really, really wants to write opera. As he sets off with his mother looking for patronage, he meets and accompanies on the keyboard (or “keyboard” as it looked like from where we sat a hundred yards away) a beautiful singer, Aloysia Weber, who sees in Mozart her chance to break into the big time. Mozart, blinded by her beauty, wants to marry her, but his stern father Leopold denies his request.\n\nAs this opéra rock has it, Mozart’s career doesn’t go smoothly, and he’s as out of fashion in late 18th-century Europe as 1980s arena rock would be in the wake of Nirvana (but not in 21st-century France). As Mozart’s fame ebbs and flows, he also runs afoul of professional maneuvering. Yes, Salieri raises his jealous head here, too. We also glimpse the man in black who commissions Mozart’s celebrated Requiem and foretells the composer’s death. This Mozart seems to have spent his entire time pursuing love, pining for the wrong woman, dealing with a difficult father, looking for work and partying down – like a rock star. Oh, and writing a few masterpieces. Mozart: rebel with a cause.\n\nMozart: l’Opéra Rock used the broad outlines – very broad – of Mozart’s life to hammer home themes of unrequited love, thwarted fame, parental bonds and the curse of talent. You know, the usual. The girls around us – along with their parents – often sang along to the “tubes” or hits, of the score. The first song released from the show, “Tatoue-moi,” or tattoo me, was a big hit in France.\n\nThe songs were either wispy in the manner of Carla Bruni folk-pop or emotive in the manner of heart-on-sleeve arena ballads, with half-rhyming lyrics (“symphonie” with “cacophonie”). Of course, while you didn’t hear anything more than a snippet of Mozart – notably the opening bars here and there of the symphony #39 in G minor – the score was tuneful enough in its own way.\n\nMozart: l’Opéra Rock also featured the tacky but delirious spectacle of Fosse-style dancers with bare midriffs and contorting pelvises thrusting away geometrically amid a chorus of bewigged 18th-entry foppish types: jazz hands and minuets. And Mozart got to wail about life’s torments, while the women in his life did their part to go all American Idol on the audience, yearning for connection, etc., in voices loud enough to warn off intruders.\n\nThe show has been remarkably popular on a European opera-rock circuit that I hadn’t even known existed. One of the singer-actors, Florent Mothe, actually won a European musical award that year at Cannes for one of the songs from the show, “L’Assasymphonie.”\n\nDespite my snobby self I found myself enjoying Mozart: l’Opéra Rock, as if it were a mindless summer action movie. And I realized how very different pop culture was here, especially this pop-culture favorite: unabashedly over the top, its mix of sincerity and cynicism managing to make you forget how awful it all was and how much you wanted to sing along with the other fans.\n\nMusic is universal. Culture is local. In France I realized that even those of us who’d considered ourselves fairly worldly actually had little idea of the world outside of our own cultural spheres.\n\nYou can’t know everything, of course. Part of the wonder in living abroad for me has been discovering elements of culture that haven’t made it past certain borders, or of finding performers on the cusp of a career. We still tend – or at least I do, sometimes – to think that what we know is best, because that’s what we know. What I began to grasp was that not only was I uninformed about the wider cultural world, I would never become as informed as I wanted to be. That didn’t mean I would stop trying to know more; I wasn’t abroad, after all, to think as I had before. But to begin with, I needed to lay aside preconceptions.\n\nLike many an individual who’d only lived in one place all his life, I expected certain aspects of Paris to be the same as the city where I’d grown up. I thought that, like New York, Paris would be a wonderful place to soak up classical music – based on a vague sense of European cultural supremacy. What I learned was that while Paris is a world-class city, it’s no longer a regular stop on the main classical-music circuit (unlike London or Berlin). I found fewer big-name singers, pianists and orchestras in Paris than I’d expected. But I heard, and continue to hear, a lot of wonderful music regardless.\n\nAmong the more memorable concerts I attended was one at Saint-Ephrem-le-Syriaque de Paris, a tiny church in the 5th arrondissement, near the Pantheon and the Sorbonne.\n\nIt’s a tiny medieval structure – it could be a side chapel in a larger house of workshop – and it’s recessed into a streetscape that seems to have grown up around it. But the size of Saint-Ephrem works well for recitals, since the sound doesn’t get lost, and performers are close to the audience.\n\nA church has been on this site since the 14th century. This particular structure, built on the tired bones of older ones, dates back to 1733, and bears the marks of its various ages – gray chipped stone walls dusty with ash, dingy Baroque columns flanking the altar, art in need of restoration. Saint-Ephrem offers liturgies under the Syriac Orthodox Church, and you can see instruments of its services amid the faded trappings of western Catholic rites.\n\nFor this concert, I took my place on one of the barely padded wicker church seats. It’s was if we were all seated in an ecclesiastical waiting room. A grand piano was placed before the altar, barely 10 feet from the first row, before an enameled wall of black arches.\n\nThe man who sold the tickets at the door lighted candles on either side of the altar space just before the performance began. A waning daylight drifted through the windows and, as the concert progressed and the night grew deeper, the interior glowed from the candelabras within, casting a soft evening shine onto everyone and drawing us into the past.\n\nThis concert featured a young pianist, Stefan Chaplikov, who’d studied at Paris’s Conservatoire National Supérieur. He performed etudes by Chopin, Liszt, Scriabin and Debussy, a set of variations by the late-Romantic Polish composer Karol Szymanowski, a Beethoven sonata and, for an encore – which I remember since shortly before I’d left for France I’d heard Lang Lang play the same piece at the New York Philharmonic – Franz Liszt’s show-stopping “Reminiscences du Don Juan.”\n\nIt was a thrill to be so near the musician, to take in a performance in so intimate a setting, and to be one of perhaps 50 people hearing a gifted pianist play just for us.\n\nAnd as my eye sometimes wandered in the romantic gloom that descended during the music, I could discern traces of French frugality: On the floor near the piano were listless flowers left over from Sunday services, and on either side of the altar, lingering from Christmas five months earlier, stood three or four pots of barely surviving poinsettias – a few tenacious red leaves clinging to stubborn, denuded branches.\n\nI attended other concerts at Saint-Ephrem during my first few months in Paris – including a sublime recital of Bach’s suites for unaccompanied cello – driven by a desire to hear other excellent young musicians who were as-yet unknown to the wider world. And also to see if those wilting poinsettias would still be there through the end of spring."
