        "text": "What causes sinus headaches?\n\nIf you have a sinus headache, a viral or bacterial infection in your sinuses may be to blame. Sinuses are a series of connected hollow spaces behind your cheekbones, forehead and nose. Air that comes in through your nose travels through your sinuses on its way to your lungs.\n\nYour sinuses are lined with tissue. They also make mucus that keeps your nose moist and traps intruders like bacteria, viruses, fungi and dust-carrying allergens.\n\nNormally, free-flowing mucus carries off intruders before they can make trouble in your sinuses. But sometimes your sinuses’ reaction to intruders starts a chain reaction that leads to sinus headaches.\n\nFirst, your sinuses start making more mucus. Mucus building up in your sinuses creates a place where intruders like bacteria and viruses can settle and grow. Growing intruders make sinus tissue swell, trapping mucus so it can’t flow from your sinuses. The result is swollen, irritated, fluid-filled sinuses that make your face feel achy and tender.\n\nWhat are sinus headache risk factors?\n\nSinus headaches stem from sinus infections. Understanding sinus infection risk factors may reduce your risk of sinus headaches. According to the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention, those risk factors include:\n\nHaving the common cold.\n\nSeasonal allergies.\n\nSmoking and exposure to secondhand smoke.\n\nStructural issues within your sinuses. For example, nasal polyps or a deviated septum may trap mucus in your sinuses.\n\nHaving a weak immune system or taking drugs that weaken your immune system increases your risk of infections, including sinus infections.\n\nHow are sinus headaches diagnosed?\n\nYour healthcare provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. If your symptoms are severe or ongoing, you may also need imaging tests like X-rays or computed tomography (CT) scans.\n\nImaging tests show if your sinuses are blocked. If they aren’t, it may mean you have a different issue like a migraine or a tension headache. Migraine headaches and sinus headaches have common symptoms. Studies suggest 80% of people who thought they had sinus headaches had migraines.\n\nHow do I know if my headache is sinus-related?\n\nThere are several kinds of headaches that may make your head hurt in different ways. For example, people often confuse migraine headaches and sinus headaches because they both cause pain that pinpoints certain parts of your aching head. The difference is where pain happens:\n\nSinus headaches make your face hurt. The pain affects both sides of your head.\n\nMigraine headaches typically cause pain high in your forehead, around your temples or in the back of your head. The pain typically affects one side of your head.\n\nA sinus headache may feel like it’s lasting an eternity.\n\nWhat’s the difference between sinusitis and a sinus headache?\n\nThe difference is that a sinus headache is just one symptom of sinusitis. If you have sinusitis, you may also have the following symptoms:\n\nFever.\n\nFatigue.\n\nPostnasal drip.\n\nCough.\n\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\n\nYour head is throbbing. Your face hurts. And you don’t even want to think about moving your head or bending over. If this sounds familiar, you may have a sinus headache caused by a sinus infection. Most sinus infections and sinus headaches clear up within a week or 10 days. When they don’t, it’s time to contact a healthcare provider. You may have a bacterial or fungal sinus infection or a migraine. Either way, you’ll need special medication that treats infections or migraines. A healthcare provider will do tests to diagnose the issue. They’ll also recommend things you can do at home to ease your symptoms."
