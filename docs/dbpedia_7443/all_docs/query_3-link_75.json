        "text": "Catarrh is a build-up of mucus in an airway or cavity of the body.\n\nIt usually affects the back of the nose, the throat or the sinuses (air-filled cavities in the bones of the face).\n\nIt's often temporary, but some people experience it for months or years. This is called chronic catarrh.\n\nCatarrh can be annoying and difficult to get rid of. But it's not harmful and there are treatments.\n\nSymptoms linked to catarrh\n\nCatarrh can lead to a:\n\nconstant need to clear your throat\n\nfeeling that your throat is blocked\n\nblocked or stuffy nose that you can't clear\n\nrunny nose\n\nfeeling of mucus running down the back of your throat\n\npersistent cough\n\nheadache or facial pain\n\nreduced sense of smell and taste\n\ncrackling sensation in your ear\n\ntemporary hearing loss\n\nThese problems can be frustrating to live with and may affect your sleep, making you feel tired.\n\nTreatments for catarrh\n\nCatarrh will often pass in a few days or weeks as the condition that causes it improves.\n\nThere are things you can try to relieve your symptoms, such as:\n\navoid things that trigger your symptoms, such as allergens or smoky places\n\nsip cold water when you need to clear your throat\n\nuse a saline nasal rinse â€“ you can buy this from a pharmacy\n\navoid warm, dry places (such as those with air conditioning and car heating systems)\n\nplace plants or bowls of water in a room to help to keep the air humid\n\nstay hydrated\n\ntalk to a pharmacist about over-the-counter medications (decongestants, antihistamines or steroid nasal sprays)\n\nThere are several remedies, such as herbal medicines, in health shops and pharmacies that claim to treat catarrh.\n\nSome people find these helpful, but there's little evidence to suggest they work.\n\nWhen to see your GP\n\nSpeak to your GP if your catarrh persists and is becoming difficult to live with.\n\nThey may want to rule out conditions that could be causing it, such as nasal polyps or allergies. They may refer you to a specialist.\n\nIf you're diagnosed with an underlying condition, treating that can relieve your catarrh. Nasal polyps, for example, can be treated with a steroid nasal spray or, in some cases, surgery.\n\nChronic catarrh can be hard to treat and may last a long time.\n\nCauses of catarrh\n\nCatarrh usually occurs when the immune system reacts to an infection or irritation. This causes the lining of your nose and throat to become swollen and produce mucus.\n\nTriggers include:\n\na cold or other infection\n\nhay fever or other types of allergic rhinitis\n\nnon-allergic rhinitis\n\nnasal polyps\n\nIt's unclear what causes chronic catarrh, but it's not thought to be the result of an allergy or infection.\n\nIt might be from a problem in the way mucus travels through the nose. It could also be caused by a sensitivity to mucus in the back of the nose and throat."
