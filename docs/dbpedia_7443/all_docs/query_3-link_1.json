        "text": "Catarrh, or postnasal drip, is the medical term for a buildup of mucus in the back of the nose, throat, or sinuses.\n\nOften, catarrh is the result of an intermittent or temporary illness, such as an allergy or cold. It typically goes away once the illness has passed.\n\nHowever, some people may experience chronic catarrh that persists for months or even years. It is not usually a cause for concern, but it can be a nuisance to live with.\n\nThis article explains what catarrh is and outlines some of its symptoms and causes. It also provides information on diagnosing and treating chronic catarrh.\n\nThe term catarrh, or postnasal drip, describes a buildup of mucus in the back of the nose, throat, or sinuses.\n\nMucus is a slippery, fluid substance that the mucus glands in the nose and throat produce. It helps moisten the nasal passages while trapping any debris, viruses, or bacteria a person inhales. This helps prevent pathogens from getting into the body, where they could cause an infection.\n\nThe body makes 1–2 quarts of mucus every day. After production, the mucus drips down the back of the nose and into the throat.\n\nUsually, people swallow the mucus without thinking about it. However, sometimes, the mucus can build up in the nose, throat, or sinuses.\n\nSome common symptoms of catarrh include:\n\na tickling feeling of mucus draining into the throat\n\nrasping or gurgling when talking\n\nfeeling as though there is a lump in the throat\n\nhaving to clear the throat frequently\n\ncoughing\n\nhaving to swallow frequently\n\ndifficulty swallowing\n\na sore throat\n\na blocked or stuffy nose\n\na headache\n\nfacial pain\n\na loss of taste or smell\n\ndifficulty sleeping\n\nThere are many potential causes of postnasal drip. They include:\n\nchanges in weather conditions\n\neating spicy foods\n\nhay fever, or allergic rhinitis\n\nnonallergic rhinitis\n\nviruses, such as the common cold\n\nsinus infection\n\nnasal polyps\n\ngastroesophageal reflux (GER)\n\ngastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n\nhormone changes during pregnancy\n\ncertain medications\n\nIn children, having something stuck in the nose is a common cause of catarrh.\n\nA person should visit their doctor if they experience chronic catarrh that has persisted for several months or more, or if they find that catarrh is interfering with their everyday life.\n\nPeople should also seek medical help if catarrh is accompanied by any of the following symptoms:\n\nan unexplained high fever\n\nwheezing\n\nshortness of breath\n\nblood in the mucus\n\nfoul-smelling mucus\n\nThese symptoms can signal an infection or condition that requires prompt medical treatment.\n\nA person who experiences chronic catarrh may need to visit a doctor to establish the cause.\n\nDuring the consultation, the doctor will ask the person about their symptoms. They will want to rule out the following potential causes:\n\nbacterial infections\n\nallergies\n\nnasal polyps\n\nGER or GERD\n\nThe doctor may look inside the person’s nose or throat using a small hand-held torch.\n\nSometimes, however, an X-ray or endoscopy may be necessary for the doctor to take a closer look inside these structures. An endoscopy is a procedure that uses a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope to look inside the body.\n\nCatarrh is a symptom with an underlying cause, and it is typically harmless. However, a person may seek treatment for the cause of persistent catarrh that is associated with pain, discomfort, or irritation.\n\nThe sections below will outline some potential treatment options for catarrh.\n\nOver-the-counter treatments\n\nSome over-the-counter (OTC) treatments for catarrh include:\n\nnasal irrigation\n\noral decongestants, such as pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) or phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine)\n\nmucus-thinning medications, such as guaifenesin (Mucinex)\n\nantihistamines, to treat allergic causes of catarrh\n\npain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to help ease headaches or facial pain\n\nHome treatments\n\nThe following home treatments may help loosen catarrh so that it is easier to expel:\n\ndrinking plenty of water\n\nusing an indoor humidifier\n\ninhaling the steam during a hot shower\n\ngargling with warm salt water\n\nusing a saltwater solution to clean the insides of the nostrils\n\nsleeping on propped up pillows\n\nPeople should also avoid consuming foods and liquids that can irritate the mucous membranes, including:\n\nspicy foods\n\ncaffeinated foods and beverages\n\nalcohol\n\nWhen GER or GERD is the cause of catarrh, people should avoid eating within 2–3 hours of going to bed.\n\nPrescription medications\n\nIf a person has chronic catarrh, their doctor may recommend ipratropium (Atrovent) or beclomethasone (Beconase) and triamcinolone (Nasacort).\n\nAtrovent is a nasal spray that reduces the amount of mucus the body makes. Beconase and Nasacort are steroid sprays that can help ease the symptoms of chronic catarrh."
