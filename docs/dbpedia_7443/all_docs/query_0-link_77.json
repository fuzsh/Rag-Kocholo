        "text": "January 12, 1943\n\nI submitted a letter to Major Henson at Fort Knox asking for information regarding a transfer. Capt. James Cheek answered my letter. I answered his letter and stated my qualifications. His next reply was very favorable, stating that my qualifications met with the requirements as a student instructor in his department, but I would have to apply through proper channels, which I did on February 7th in a letter to my company commander, enclosing the Captain's letter.\n\nFebruary 9, 1943\n\nI was appointed to Private First Class, an increase of $4 per month!!\n\nAfter another plea to Capt. Cheek on April 27th, I abandoned hopes from him.\n\nThe period of training from January until April consisted of close order drill, calisthenics, obstacle course, care and cleaning of equipment, map reading and basic tactics. Due to the fact that all these buildings were simply 2 x 4's covered with 3/4 inch sheathing, it got very cold inside. At times my ink would be frozen until noon. As I mentioned before, if your shoe soles were wet at night, they would freeze to the floor in the morning. Cups were often frozen to the overturned plates in the mess hall. Milk and orange juice or fruit was often frozen. During extremely cold weather when we had classes inside, we would often go for a run round the block during our break. Much candy was consumed during the cold months for additional energy. At night shelter halves were put up around the bunks to help quell the spread of colds.\n\nI found it quite hard to accustom myself to all the southerners in our barracks. There were two of us from Wisconsin, quite a few from the East and the rest from the Southern states.\n\nWhen it warmed up, the mud was everywhere, especially on the drill field when we tried to do \"to the rear march.\" We held several full dress parades and reviews in the mud dressed in our best O.D.s. After you got just so much mud on your clothes, it didn't matter anymore and you just passed it off as \"one of those things.\"\n\nWe extended our hikes and were frequently doing eight to ten miles. Often we would start out in the morning wearing overcoats and wish we could take off our shirts in the afternoon. In mid afternoon mud would stick to the shoe soles and you would get two or three inches taller until you could stop and clean it off. The army has very little regard for the elements. We got so we could sit in it, stand in it and even lay in it. We always walked in it.\n\nM1919A4 .30 Caliber Air\n\nCooled Machine Gun\n\nWe never took a hike without it. If there was enough men for two squads, we took two machine guns. The mortar section had their troubles too; they carried their mortars (stovepipes, we called them). But they could sit on the reverse side of a hill while we double-timed out in front under orders of Popovich and Martin, both corporals.\n\nWe would often fall out in the company street with the wrong uniform or equipment three or four times in the morning due to orders being mixed up. Then it was back into barracks until it became a joke and we didn't care if we kept it up all day.\n\nWe used to come in from a hike or exercises and when we approached the company street we would all sing This Is The Army Mr. Jones, Yellow Ribbon, Praise The Lord And Take Us Out Of Kansas and Kansas Is A Hell Of A State, Parlez vous and also Roll Out The Barrel. Then if we couldn't make more noise than the 3rd platoon, Sergeant Papp would blow his top and say, \"OK we'll have a singing lesson in the sixth barracks tonight.\"\n\nMarch 31, 1943\n\nBasic Training was over and the much talked about things called \"Furloughs\" were next. I was on the first group and left on an old Santa Fe bus at five AM on the 31st. It took ages for the trip, both coming and going. The time at home was swell. I gave my motorcycle, \"Charlie,\" a good workout and was sorry to leave again. I returned to Camp Phillips on April 9, 1943.\n\nApril, 1943\n\nWe were in a new period of training with Lt. Guy, the C.O. We went on longer hikes and stayed in the field for a week at a time on exercises. I temporarily served as a Runner, both for the weapons platoon and also \"L\" Company. I was somewhat independent of the weapons platoon. We would carry lots of candy and sweets in our packs on these hikes and bivouacs as much as possible. We often hiked fourteen miles back to camp after a hard week. We dug millions of slit trenches and foxholes with our little shovels. We would walk a few miles, stop, then the orders were shouted, \"dig in!\" No sooner did we finish our hole, than it was, \"Fill them up. We are moving out!\"\n\nOn Saturdays, we always had inspection of some kind, either \"barracks or full field.\" Certain layout of your equipment was necessarily displayed and if it was not right, you were put on \"report,\" with extra duties resulting. Very seldom were we done before three PM.\n\nDuring May or June the barracks were skirted with boards from the ground up to floor level. We also got hardwood floors and window screens. During the next three months we encountered lots of dust and heat. One afternoon during a hike, you could hardly see the men in front of you. Dust got into everything. Our barracks was located next to the mess hall and when the wind didn't blow, we got dirty from soot. It was S.O.P. to mop the floor every day except Sunday.\n\nSgt. Papp was busted and did thirty days in the guardhouse for insubordination. Lt. Travis was C.O. for a time after Lt. Guy left, then Capt. Rigdon, then Lt. Morgan. First Sgt. Smallwood was replaced by a fat guy from Pennsylvania by the name of John Stracelsky. The Lt.'s couldn't pronounce his name so they called him Sgt. John.\n\nIt was during this month that a captain from the Inspector General's office was in camp to interview E.M. I again put in a request for a transfer. Lt. Morgan also \"interviewed\" all who had visited the Captain. After insulting words were exchanged, I still wasn't sorry for my actions. I was sent to the Classification Headquarters with my records. After waiting until the last of July, I also gave up hope of a transfer to the 94th Recon. Troop.\n\nJune - July, 1943\n\nWe spent some miserably hot weather in the field during this month. It was in June or July we turned in our folding cots for wooden bunks with springs! We were going on Battalion and Regimental operations. Twenty-five mile hikes were quite common. Often we would start at midnight and hike with full field equipment. You would be wet all over from perspiration. Several of the weaker ones would drop out from fatigue. Many tramped doggedly on until they passed out. Officers began to complain to the medics after some higher up officials got the bright idea of a higher physical standard. They found that the training was tearing down, more than building up.\n\nWe often sat around in our underwear while writing letters or studying in the evening. It was miserably hot during the day and half the night. I attended church on base every Sunday and was a member of the regimental chorus. We were invited to Salina several times and sang over radio station KSAL once. The people of Salina often would invite us to their homes for dinner. We were finished with RCT's and taking part in Division Corps maneuvers. During these times, I was company runner and sometimes Battalion runner. Sometimes when the weather was cooler, we would spend the night in the field with only a raincoat to cover up with. One particular night I would awaken from the cold and dig my slit trench deeper to stay warm. By morning it was hip deep.\n\nWe practiced knocking out pillboxes under real artillery and infantry fire. We crawled undergrazing machine gun fire on the infiltration course. On several occasions when our canteen of water was gone, we would scoop up some from a puddle and put iodine or halizone tablets in it to kill the \"bugs.\" This was a practice that was not authorized and several penalties were meted out if caught.\n\nOctober 15, 1943\n\nClose order drill today. Also typhus shots again. Applied for and got a three day pass starting at 6:00 AM tomorrow!\n\nOctober 16, 1943\n\nWent to Washington, D.C. on my pass. Met a nice WAVE in the Archives building. We visited points of interest together, had supper and went to the stage show I Dood It with Virginia O'Brien. After searching in vain for a hotel or other room, I went to \"Tent City,\" operated by and for Army with free coffee and doughnuts for breakfast.\n\nOctober 17, 1943\n\nI visited the Jefferson Memorial, Lincoln Memorial, Arlington Cemetery, etc., today. I dated Y 3/c Francis Bowen this evening. We went to a church program, then to a show and lunch. I slept at the USO tonight.\n\nOctober 18, 1943\n\nI saw the house where Lincoln died, the Ford Theatre, visited the Capitol and saw the Senate in session. I went to a show, Bombers Moon, also to the Stage Door Canteen and saw the Virginia OBrien stage show again. I had lunch and caught the 2:15 bus back to Fort Meade.\n\nOctober 19, 1943\n\nToday we were on the obstacle course. This morning I was awakened by two green Lieutenants because all cubicles were not put up properly. Got eleven letters and a package from Dot containing a neat little picture holder. Haven't gotten all the mail from Tennessee yet.\n\nOctober 20, 1943\n\nI was on KP today, washing dishes and pans continuously most all day. Got a package from Sis and one from home containing a hunting knife. Expected to be awakened again tonight on the cubicle deal.\n\nOctober 21, 1943\n\nWell, well, we went on a night problem from eight to twelve. That gets my goat. These Lieutenants think we are learning something. I have been on more night problems than they have been on day problems. We pitched tents, got to sleep and were awakened by a real gas attack. I went back to sleep wearing my gas mask. We were back to barracks by 12:30 and get tomorrow free!! We used to hike all night in Kansas and not get any time off the next day. This is boring.\n\nOctober 22, 1943\n\nGas drill again today in the PM while on a hike. I got seven letters today and went to a show in the evening. One letter was from Pat, a gal I had dated in Washington.\n\nOctober 23, 1943\n\nI got a pass for tonight until tomorrow to 2400 hours.\n\nOctober 24, 1943\n\nGot into Washington at about 8:30 and bought a pair of goggles for Ed for $3.95. Also bought a hunting knife for $10.95. The other guys will come back from \"Boom Town\" with a hangover and I will have a knife tomorrow. Visited a swell USO on North Street. I burned my name on the knife sheath with a wood burning pencil. They have many nice hobby facilities there.\n\nI slept in some guy's bed in the Salvation Army USO. I got chased out of the first one. Went to bed about 3:00 AM. I didn't like to see all those empty beds going to waste. The two Marines that were with me got cold feet after being chased out the first time. I went to the Stage Door Canteen, then to a dance in a Catholic Church parlor and then to a stage show. Called Francis Bowen, but was unable to keep a date. I came back to Laurel, as per last night. The bus was full and I had to stand for the entire trip. I got here for supper.\n\nWalked about two miles with Private Tweet to theatre #4 to see the show, but the theatre was full so I walked back via \"Boom Town.\" The latest rumor has us moving about October 28th.\n\nOctober 25, 1943\n\nI got more equipment and packed bags in the PM. Included were two blankets, one OD colored fatigue outfit, eight pair of OD socks, one OD bath towel, one pair of shoes, all to go into a pack or \"A\" bag. The \"B\" bag has three sun tans, one pair of shoes, mosquito nets, one blanket, one mattress cover and other stuff. Our \"B\" bags are to be retrieved at the destination. I received partial payment of $15. We drilled in rain all morning.\n\nOctober 26, 1943\n\nIt rained all day. I was assigned as table waiter, not a bad job. I turned in both bags and was checked again. We had classes in the barracks. All the new equipment is stuff I wear when we leave. I wrote a couple of letters. Things seem to disappear awfully easy here. So far I have lost a helmet liner, a rifle sharpshooter pin and an OD garrison cap.\n\nCamp Patrick Henry\n\nNovember, 1943\n\nIt is not clear how we got to Camp Patrick Henry from Fort Meade.\n\nNovember 2, 1943\n\nWe left Camp Patrick Henry, Rhodes, Virginia, on a troop train at about 9AM, receiving two sandwiches and an apple as we got on. At about 12:00 or 1:00, we were broken up into proper lengths and sided into the loading docks alongside the ship. While we sat on the docks with our \"A\" bags, two \"Grey Ladies\" passed out hot chocolate and coffee. As the first of our group started boarding the ship, a band about one hundred yards away started playing We're Going Over and various other numbers. The line passed a desk where you answered roll call with your first name and then went up the gangplank on the Liberty Ship SS John Stevens.\n\nWe were ushered into hold #2 by a Lieutenant and assigned bunks, which were canvas on a pipe frame. Mine is a top one of five, only one tier on my right and innumerable tiers to the left, head and foot. The fourth from the floor comes up to my head. I also have a light at the foot and to the right of me. The workers were not through securing the deck cargo, so we slept in the bay in between.\n\nOn board troop ship, SS John Stevens\n\nNovember 4, 1943\n\nAt sea. Nope I don't like it!\n\nNovember 5, 1943\n\nI had to force both meals down today.\n\nNovember 6, 1943\n\nSame as yesterday. I am still seasick! Today I was on KP duty.\n\nNovember 7, 1943\n\nWe had Catholic services today, but no Protestant service. I was in the mood for supper and actually liked it.\n\nNovember 8, 1943\n\nI tried some tactics on breakfast, but had to force it down. I didn't go to supper at all. The sea is very rough.\n\nNovember 9, 1943\n\nThe same sea today. I took a capsule last night and slept pretty well. It was hard to stay in my bunk. There is lots of vomit all around, I ate two slices of white bread for dinner and begged one from a pal for supper. It is very rough tonight.\n\nNovember 10, 1943\n\nI dreamed I was in Uncle Daves (Patchin) eating a stack of wheat cakes with honey and butter and a soft fried egg. Later I was at home, eating a steak sandwich with lettuce and tomatoes, with salad dressing. This was a very vivid picture! I tried to carry over my enthusiasm for food until breakfast, but got only to the steps and \"cashed in my cookies\" in my canteen cup. The breakfast menu was coffee, dry cream of wheat, two slices of white bread, butter, jam and dehydrated eggs. Few went and fewer ate. I stayed topside until about 10:00 when a corporal grabbed me and others for officer's latrine detail. I worked about five minutes and then went to the doctor. He gave me two capsules for motion sickness to be taken morning and night. I made for my bunk, but vomited some greenish fluid in my cup before I got there. After taking one of the capsules, I slept. I didn't go for supper, but got a slice of bread from the fellow in the bunk below me and forced a square of tropical chocolate and water down.We were called out for boat drill just before dark. I got two K-rations while up there. It is rough when the ship goes down in a trough, You can't even see the other ships in the convoy. It is raining tonight.\n\nNovember 11, 1943\n\nWell, this is more like it. The sea is quite calm today. At times I can see other ships in the distance. It's getting rough again tonight. I ate most of a K-ration this morning and a whole C-ration tonight. I feel much better. Several cases of rations are taken from the storeroom every night. It is very common to see eight or ten men standing around in a group and when the case is opened, they pounce on it like hungry wolves. They emerge with two or three or an armful of cans. At length one or two stragglers find their footing, stand up, and stagger away, beaten but wiser. Their tactics on the next box bring amazing results. It is said that even the officers play the same game. I'm not worrying about the chow line anymore. What I eat usually comes back up. I am in need of a shave and a bath, as are the others. The hold is unbelievably dirty and foul smelling. I'm only the fourth bunk from an air vent, so that helps.\n\nNovember 12, 1943\n\nThe sea got rough again. I ate four \"biscuits\" from C-rations. I was topside for about fifteen minutes. Sea is very choppy and windy. I don't feel too well!\n\nNovember 13, 1943\n\nStill choppy and rough. I ate breakfast and dinner and some K-rations. Feel better tonight. We got instructions to keep a full canteen of water at all times. Had boat drill.\n\nNovember 14, 1943\n\nSunday, shaved a week old beard today. It is quite windy again. I got partial payment of $10. Card and crap games were interrupted long enough to hold a simple mass for the Catholics, but no service for Protestants. Ate K-rations for breakfast and C-rations for supper.\n\nMost everyone has his normal stomach back again. The sea is quite smooth. Along with pay, we received a carton of cigarettes and a Baby Ruth candy bar from the Red Cross. I sold the cigarettes for thirty cents and was offered twenty-five cents for the candy bar. It's 1:00 AM and few have gone to bed.\n\nNovember 15, 1943\n\nIt is quite nice today. They chased us out on deck at 8:30 AM so that filthy place could be cleaned up some. It is filthy. The center of the hold is covered with heavy canvas, which is slippery with grease and grime. This area is often filled with crapshooters and really presents a problem to go below. Ate C and K-rations and went through the chow line tonight. I had ½ a yellow pill, two slices of \"pilot bread,\" stale butter, jam spaghetti and hot cocoa. I didn't even drink all the cocoa; K-rations are better. I still crave fresh fruit of any kind, or lettuce or tomato. The crew gets fresh fruit, but not us. I feel pretty good, even on the equivalent of two meals a day. The sea is smoother now.\n\nNovember 16, 1943\n\nAte K and C-rations. Don't go through the chow line, which is inferior to rations. I was \"acting Corporal of the Guard\" at 4:00 to 6:00, 10:00 to 12:00 and 4:00 to 6:00. They fired the 20-mm guns today for practice. I got one empty case. The sea is smooth and it is really a beautiful night, moon, etc. It is also very good for subs too. The convoy zigzags quite a bit to avoid being a good target.\n\nNovember 17, 1943\n\nStill no sign of land. Ate up the K and C-rations and now must try to replenish them. It is darker than the inside of a black cow out tonight. I saw several phosphorescent areas of plankton or something in the water along side the ship.\n\nNovember 18, 1943\n\nWe were aroused at the usual 8:00 AM and chased out on deck so that the stinking hold could be cleaned. Body odors are strong after about three weeks without a bath. Had boat drill today. It is real dark tonight. I ate rations again today.\n\nNovember 19, 1943\n\nThe sea was really rough again today. The ship rolled over on its side farther at times than ever before. Tin cans were falling, guys were hollering and sliding around, canteen cups, forks, spoons and helmet liners were falling and at times you had to hang on to keep from falling out of your bunk. I did my usual reading out of the New Testament. Still no land in sight. I removed my shoes to sleep last night.\n\nNovember 20, 1943\n\nI think we encountered an enemy sub at about 5:30 PM. I was forward and saw a destroyer on the left front drop a depth charge about three-quarters of a mile from us. It sent a blinker signal and circled the spot for some time. Nothing was officially confirmed.\n\nI think we passed the Rock of Gibraltar at 8:30 to 9:00 PM. There were a couple of lights visible to the North at this time. Ate rations and was down in the hold looking for K-rations. The sea is very still. I got my hair all clipped off tonight. I ate part of an onion, which I got from Pvt. Verville. It was sure good.\n\nLand!\n\nNovember 21, 1943\n\nLand! Africa! I saw it at 6:00 AM, but the sun wasn't up and there was room for debate as to whether it was mountains or clouds. It is 12:00 now and you can see it both on port and starboard sides. We are apparently nearing the \"Rock\", although I can't see it. I must have been wrong about last night. After twenty days of water, all one can do is gaze out over the tree covered bluffs and say, \"It's beautiful.\" Yeah, we passed the \"Rock\" tonight. I saw a whole school of porpoises. Ate rations again today and read daily gospel as usual.\n\nNovember 22, 1943\n\nAnchored in harbor tonight. Supposed to get off tomorrow. Very interesting, they even have electric lights. What will tomorrow bring?\n\nNovember 23, 1943\n\nWe moved in and tied up. Most interesting to a kid from the Midwest of the USA. I now realize how fortunate we were to reach port without misfortune. Evidence of the conflict in which we are engaged is visible on many ships here. Gaping holes where torpedoes have hit, a half a ship and a partially burned tanker.\n\nHad cornflakes for breakfast, went through chow line. C-rations again for supper. I wish I had some fishing equipment. An old guy sat out here in a rowboat on our starboard, catching little chubs all forenoon. The sailors got shore leave this AM. I was among the many that swiped onions and potatoes last night. I stored a couple in my barracks bag along with other rations.\n\nDecember 1, 1943\n\nWe are restricted or in quarantine yet. It rained or was cold and foggy most of the day. The summit of the mountain was hidden by clouds quite a lot of the day. I waited in PX line for about twenty-five minutes and bought 2 cigars, 9 cigarettes, 2 bars of soap, 1 roll of candy wafers, 1 life saver, a box of hard candy squares, 1 five cent bar, 3 razor blades and one bottle of ink, all for $1.03 - my rations for a week. I was changed to the first platoon of \"B\" Company yesterday. I have been in Companies A, B, C, D, L and R so far. Went to the show Andy Hardy's Double Life. Went to the Red Cross early in the evening and got ice cream in my canteen cup for two francs.\n\nDecember 2, 1943\n\nWe were on formal guard mount at 11:00 AM. I was Corporal of First Relief, twenty men. Went down to the villa to inspect the guard in the afternoon. Nice buildings, but dirty with goats, chickens, sheep and kids all in the same rooms. One guard is posted in front of the courtyard entrance and other walks along side. The purpose was to keep soldiers out of the villa. I gave some Italian prisoners candy and cigarettes. Slept in the guard tent tonight.\n\nDecember 3, 1943\n\nMounted a new guard and through Sgt. Martin, he and Santilli, Reed and I got a pass from 1300 hours to 2200 hours. We headed for St. Cloud and walked all six miles. We wandered around; it was very interesting. I took a couple of pictures. Lots of bullet holes. Bought oranges and tangerines at about forty-eight cents per dozen. Trading is better than cash. I traded an old fountain pen, which I had saved for that purpose, for eight tangerines.\n\nCigarettes are also very good for trading. We had lots of fun trying to understand French and Spanish. I saw lots of people at a public water hydrant filling jars, pitchers and other containers. Saw several foreign motorcycles. I was surprised to see the size of the motors in French cars, which go by like a \"bat out of hell\" when you hitchhike. Ate supper of soup, some kind of cornmeal, etc., two eggs, sunny side up, sausage, highly seasoned, bread comes in fifteen-inch loaves, quart of wine, tangerine and spaghetti. Cost 60 francs.\n\nThe Market Square was being filled with wares. It would be interesting to visit it on Saturday when everything is in full swing. I saw a funeral procession, led by a red robed priest and altar boys, a horse drawn coffin with flowers and canopy. Four men carrying a sheet with a cross preceded the coffin. Mourners followed on foot. We removed our headgear when it passed by.\n\nVery few American soldiers here. The French use almost all U. S. equipment such as jeeps, cycles, staff cars, etc. I might add that they act very unappreciative too!\n\nWe started back to camp at 7:15 and helped two Arabs push their cart of wood up a hill and made a little over six miles in an hour and five minutes.\n\nDecember 4, 1943\n\nI am the only one in \"D\" company and the only \"L\" company replacement that I know of that is on shipping alert. I didn't have to fall out with the rest of the company this morning. Had Spam and eggs, cream of wheat, bread and civilized coffee for breakfast. Participated in tent and personal inspection, then went to show Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man.\n\nDecember 5, 1943\n\nSunday, I was to pack my barracks bag and be at the supply room at 3:00 PM. When I returned from church, someone had already packed it. I waited until a checkup disclosed it to be an Armored Force man, Leonard L. Sherman, instead of me. I thought for a while that my prayers were going to be answered. For nine months, back in the States, I prayed every night that I might get an army cycle to ride, but with all that and the physical efforts, I am still in the Infantry. I went to an evening Protestant service and then to the show Star Spangled Rhythm.\n\nDecember 6, 1943\n\nA shipment went out. I fell out for drill and hiked ten miles in the forenoon. Took a shower and did some laundry.\n\nDecember 7, 1943\n\nOur tent got passes at 8:00 AM. We walked about a mile and got a ride into town. I traded cigarettes for three oranges. I think I got gypped. Ate at the Red Cross: Spam sandwich, doughnuts, coffee, and ice cream for five francs, Registered in State Log Book and saw one name from Evansville (Woodstock.) Bought a French language manual and had a Frenchman help with interpretation. It's quite difficult to get the sounds of vowels, etc., but I hope to get a basic idea of the language.\n\nWent into the projection booth of the American Red Cross theatre. They have two American super simplex machines operated by a Frenchman. We met a couple of \"D\" Company cadremen and got a ride in a truck back to camp by 10:00 PM.\n\nDecember 8, 1943\n\nI lost or can't locate my pearl handled pocketknife with the little scissors; missed it this morning. There sure are lots of motorcycles in town. While looking down from the balcony of the Red Cross building, I saw lots of interesting sights below; an open wagon with butchered beef, sheep hides, heads and hooves all together. The one end of the beef dragged on the street when they unloaded it. Kids stood below us and begged gum, candy and cigarettes when we dropped them. Veiled women with baskets of oranges, wine or bread carried on their heads had as much right of way as carts or vehicles in the narrow streets. I pinched myself to see if I wasn't watching a circus.\n\nI tried to increase my allotment (bond), but can't until I get assigned to a permanent outfit.\n\nDecember 9, 1943\n\nWe had a night hike up the mountain for four hours.\n\nDecember 10, 1943\n\nWe went on the firing range this morning; fifty yards just for practice. It rained quite a bit last night and the clouds were so low over the range at one time, you could hardly see the targets. I fired twenty-nine shots with the M-1. Got a partial payment of $10. Woke up this morning with the GI's. It must have been something I ate. I got PX rations; 8 cigarettes, 3 cigars, 1 soap, 2 razor blades, one candy bar, a Tootsie Roll and two rolls of candy wafers for $0.95. Drew the fourth blanket and went to the show Henry Aldrich.\n\nDecember 11, 1943\n\nWe had close order drill, calisthenics and a ten-mile hike this morning. You would think we were a bunch of rookies! We had chicken for dinner, grapefruit juice to drink. We have had quite a lot of tomatoes, pineapple, grapefruit and lemon juice to drink. Have lots of Spam too. I had a small piece of fried chicken for supper and went to a show.\n\nDecember 12, 1943\n\nWent to 10:00 Protestant Services. It is cold and rainy. I got the most beautiful box of Fanny May candy from Natalie; was two pounds, however, still no letter. I went back to the mailroom and there was a letter from her with a Virgin Mary medal inside, also a Christmas card with a note. I usually get a piece of mail almost daily. Much more than lots of other fellows get. I write more than they do too! The weather is very miserable. We can't have fires in our tents to dry things either. We went on a fifteen-mile hike in the rain and all my shoes are wet.\n\nDecember 13,1943\n\nAll the guys in our tent went on pass in the rain except me. I was Company Runner again. I went to Battalion Headquarters to see about getting a job typing. I got it. I'm working at depot headquarters. Wednesday it cleared up and the sun came out. I worked on payroll and did some filing etc.\n\nDecember 15,1943\n\nWorked on payroll. Got a box of stationary from Aunt Mary Sellick. I got PX rations after standing in line for nearly two hours.\n\nDecember 18, 1943\n\nTyped payroll as usual.\n\nDecember 19, 1943\n\nI worked from 9:00 to 10:00, went to church services and then typed until noon. Went to evening services and then to a movie.\n\nDecember 21, 1943\n\nAttended a French class in the Battalion recreation hall in the evening while the Company went on a hike up the mountain.\n\nDecember 24, 1943\n\nAfter I returned from personnel this noon, a B-25 flew over the area quite low. I went outside the tent when I heard a dull puff and the engine stopped. Through the clouds, I could see the flames and smoke where he hit. Rain and low clouds obscured the mountain until about five minutes after the accident, it cleared up.\n\nDecember 25, 1943\n\nWe had turkey and all the trimmings for Christmas dinner. I went to midnight Mass with Elmer Buynak. The Company fell out for a hike, as usual, before dinner. I went to the barber and had a haircut for twenty cents. We went on shipping alert this PM.\n\nDecember 26, 1943\n\nI went to church and then to the Personnel Office. I was to have an interview with a Major to see about cavalry. It did not materialize.\n\nDecember 27, 1943\n\nLeft on truck in the PM, boarded Dutch ship and cast off on December 28th\n\nJanuary 16, 1944\n\nHiked about four miles to the rear to see Joe E. Brown in person. All bridges have been blown up. Caught rides back to camp. We have dug holes and slit trenches for our own protection and safety. These were to be our homes for several days. You get your food from the mess tent, then return to your hole to eat and sleep. One of the foxholes I made was deep enough to crouch and sit in with a shelter half over the top to keep snow, wind or rain off. It had a degree of comfort.\n\nLanding at Anzio, Italy, beachhead after the invasion\n\nJanuary 24, 1944\n\nEarly on the 24th our weapons section boarded the L.S.T. #125 and proceeded up the coast to land at Anzio. While enroute on this craft, I was thrown against some part of the ship, suffering a contusion on my right hip. This caused a bruise and swelling, which was painful for several years. We were greeted by the German Luftwaffe. All the larger ships, which were in the harbor, had barrage balloons or small dirigibles flying overhead. The enemy made numerous attempts to inflict damage. Our planes usually drove them off, sometimes with dog fights with losses to both sides.\n\nThe invasion at Anzio took place on the 22nd of January 1944. Records indicate that American casualties were 23,865. British casualties were 9,203. We disembarked and made our way through the city to the North. The machine gun section, which I was in, set up and covered various crossroads and routes of infiltration. We were spread out along a dry canal not far from the \"pickle factory\" when the Germans made a big push on the fifteenth and sixteenth of February.\n\nCaptured at Anzio, Italy\n\nFebruary 16, 1944\n\nThe Germans occupied the higher ground, where they could cover every foot of the beach area with all kinds of weapons. They had railroad mounted guns which fired five hundred fifty-pound shells as much as twenty miles. They also used six-barrel mortars, which would encircle an area and completely cover us with devastating shrapnel.\n\nDuring one particularly heavy concentration, I was lying near another soldier who had an entrenching shovel lying nearby. I hollered and told him, \"If you are not going to use it, throw it over here!\" I lay on my belly and dug a little trench real fast for myself. When some of the shells came in they made a screeching noise. We called them \"Screaming Memmies.\" The trees in the area were only stubs and stumps due to the heavy shelling.\n\nThe Germans had remote controlled machines about five or six feet long. They carried two hundred pounds of explosives, which they could detonate at will from a safe distance. On the sixteenth of February 1944, they made an all out attack, which was very severe with tanks and hordes of troops. We were completely overwhelmed and our commander sent word down the line to dismantle our weapons and surrender.\n\nThe enemy kept some of us right on the front lines to go out and pick up their dead. We did this mostly at night. We just piled them up like cordwood. Lots of them had bowel movement when they died, so we didn't enjoy the job. It was during this time that I suffered from frozen feet. They let us go into a barn or stable in the daytime to rest and warm up. The door facing the American lines was missing and at one time I was lying on some straw when a sniper's bullet hit the wall about three inches above my body. I moved away from that spot in a hurry.\n\nTwo of us went out to a pump with a German aid-man to fill a water can and pick up some wounded, when an American machine gun opened up on us and we hit the dirt. The aid-man waved his Red Cross flag and they momentarily stopped firing. We managed to get one German wounded back to the barn and tried to convince them that we were supposed to be taken to the rear of the danger zone. They promised to take us to the rear before daylight. I ate the remainder of a K ration. The enemy didn't make any attempt to feed us. I went through my pack and gas mask and left my home address in it. I buried a good hunting knife in cow manure so the Germans wouldn't find it and use it on me.\n\nFebruary 18, 1944\n\nOn this day two of us were on the protected side of the building with some Jerries and watched tracers and artillery go by for some time. An American had just taken a couple loaves of bread inside when a shell hit the backside and another demolished a shed about twenty-five feet from us. After aiding the wounded American, two of us took off to the rear on our own. Simpson and I were together, staying in the ditch alongside the road as much as possible. About thirty-five other P.O.W.'s and their guards joined us. A British Spitfire saw us and strafed us as we followed the ditch. Tracers missed me by about five feet.\n\nWe were taken to a building and questioned. We only gave them our name, rank and serial number. Our officers were separated from us and we walked until about 11:00 PM. We saw Lt. Crane in the evening. We descended into a deep valley and spent the night in a grape vineyard. Because I could speak a bit of German, one of the guards took two of us under his blanket with him. It was very cold.\n\nFebruary 19, 1944\n\nWe left the valley at about 8:00 AM and walked all day without any food. We were finally put on trucks that delivered us to a house where we were locked in an upstairs room and given a quarter of a loaf of bread, a dark heavy rye. The loaves were about the size of a brick. We slept on straw and were very cramped for space.\n\nFebruary 20, 1944\n\nWe got one quarter of a loaf of bread per man and some green tea in our canteen cups about noon. We were interrogated again and gave them our name, rank and serial number. They knew our family history and outfit. We left about 8:00 PM and walked about five kilometers to the \"Film Studio,\" where warm food, etc., was promised. There was a twelve to fifteen foot high barbed?wire fence with about an eight-foot space and another outer fence, with wooden guard towers on all four corners with armed guards. The space between the fences was patrolled with dogs and armed guards. We signed a book, which was said to be for the Red Cross so they could contact our loved ones.\n\nI sought out Dale Diefenthaler and went to bed on a little pile of straw in the \"Hollywood of Italy.\"\n\nThe \"Film Studio\"\n\nFebruary 21, 1944\n\nThree lights stay on all night in the huge dusty place. There were several pails and some barrels for about one thousand of us to use for sanitary purposes. By morning they were usually overflowing. For breakfast we get some kind of tea made from roasted grain. For lunch we get some kind of real thin soup, cabbage, rutabaga, macaroni or barley; about 3/4 of a canteen cup. At about four or five PM, we have a head count and get a loaf of bread for five men. At 5:30 PM, we get another tea and a spoonful of jam or a piece of cheese.\n\nThe time spent here was quite routine and depressing. Most of the time we sat around and picked lice, which we got from the straw, and talked about food. Our soup and tea was brought in on a cart in a huge kettle. The German bread was stacked on the cart like a bunch of stove wood (no wrappers). There wasn't much of a system for feeding the soup. The Yanks would make one line and the English would make another. There were always fights breaking out over seconds, if there were any. When the large kettle was empty, there were always P.O.W.s scraping the bottom just to get another bit of food.\n\nEverybody traded watches, pens, lighters and anything else for bread or food with the guards. We were allowed to make little fires outside if we could find twigs or scraps of wood. We would often toast part of our bread to make it tastier. At night we would sit and talk about all the wonderful food we were going to have when we got home. We spent quite a few hours comparing English and American customs.\n\nIf you could get on a work detail, cleaning, painting or sawing wood, you got an extra quarter or fifth of bread or cigarettes. With great satisfaction, I would often count twelve to sixty bombers carrying out their mission near Rome. It was during these times that a few P.O.W.s escaped out the gate and hid until dark. One of the bigger thrills came when dive-bombers dropped some five hundred pounders about five hundred yards from us. The lights were off for about twenty-four hours and the water was off almost as long.\n\nAfter the Jerries found out our cooks were eating excessively, we got a new crew. There was an improvement in our soups and the lines were organized to some extent.\n\nI have painful feet from the cold, which I think were frozen earlier. It was about this time that I removed the screws from a cold air return and crawled in to see if this might be an avenue of escape. Dale replaced the grate after I entered, then we replaced the screws when I returned with bad news. The duct ended in an occupied boiler room! We constantly got rumors about prisoners who were killed after they tried to escape.\n\nThere were all kinds of allied prisoners here; English, South Africans, Australians, Serbians, French, India, New Zealanders and Irish. There were frequent shipments going to other camps. When the Germans needed a work detail somewhere, they would make a shipment of P.O.W.s to do the job.\n\nAfter the war, I got the black bread recipe that was used. It came from the \"Food Providing Ministry,\" (top secret) Berlin, 24x1,1941 and the Director in Ministry, Herr Mansfeld and Herr Moritz:\n\n50% rye grain\n\n20% sliced sugar beets\n\n20% tree flour (sawdust)\n\n10% minced leaves and straw\n\nWe always said it had sawdust in it, and it did, but sure was welcome.\n\nMarch 10, 1944\n\n8:00 AM, we had roll call and were searched. Impromptu searches were frequently rendered. We were given a loaf of bread and a small tin of meat for every three men. All the Americans were put on trucks to head North. We caught sight of St. Peter's Cathedral twice, went past the Coliseum, Victor Emmanuel Memorial, statues of Christ and the Twelve Disciples, and lots of historical ruins in Rome. The convoy didn't stay together and we met very few German soldiers. Went through Arezzo, an ex-rail center. The church was about the only complete building left. We arrived at a transit camp not far from Florence, just before dark.\n\nThis was Laterina. There were barracks here, which contained fifty, three-tiered wooden bunks. There were twenty barracks. Two twenty-foot high fences with wooden guard towers surrounded the whole compound. Guards with dogs patrolled the perimeter outside the fences. There was a wire about eighteen inches off the ground that was about ten or twelve feet inside the high fence, We were warned that we would be shot if we stepped over this wire. Two buildings were the latrines. Simple cement block structures with concrete floors and two rows of eight-inch holes, with cement footprints on either side, to squat over for sanitary purposes. The holes were about three feet apart, no privacy and no toilet paper. There were a couple spigots to fill your canteen. Dale and I were assigned to Hut #7, full of English and lice. We were searched and given three quarters of a canteen cup of barley soup and a blanket. We found a corner bunk with straw and fell asleep. The time spent in this camp was mostly a game of survival. I read the gospel every day, the Germans allowed me to keep my new testament, and picked lice.\n\nJoe Louis knocks down Max Schmelling\n\nJune 22,1938\n\nPainting by\n\nDick Perez\n\nApril 1, 1944\n\nI got up once through the night. The cramps and diarrhea are much better. I got seconds on coffee this morning. It had some sugar in it. At 7:30 I took a pill they gave us. They said it was a vitamin tablet. We talked a lot and I read the Gospel. The rumor about Romania and Hungary came around again. Twenty-four bombers flew over at about 10:00 AM. We had cabbage leaves and very little barley for soup. Forty-eight bombers passed over at about 2:30. Max Schmelling [editor's note:Max Schelling was the World Heavyeight Champion, he defeateaed Joe Louis in thier first match, but in the rematch in 1938 Joe Louis knocked him out in the first round after 2 min 40 seconds; this was a big embarrassment to the Nazi Reich.Although a poster Aryan for the Nazi's, Max Schmelling did help some Jewish people escape Nazi Germany.] stopped in camp. He wanted to erect a boxing ring and put on a show. He promised a fantastic meal and drinks to anyone who would participate. To my knowledge, nobody took him up on the offer. Everyone was too weak and undernourished to do any activity like that.\n\nApril 2, 1944\n\nMy kidneys seem to be back to normal again; however, stools are still bloody. I feel quite good, but am weak. Had the usual roll call and ersatz (substitute) coffee at 7:00. The church bells of the town on the hill sound real inviting. We had a short informal worship for all religions this AM. Got cabbage soup for lunch. Dale was on yard detail, so he shared. I made a toasted sandwich with my rations. Had pea soup for supper; made seconds. Read the Gospel, lay in the sun and picked lice. Twenty-four bombers flew over this PM.\n\nApril 3, 1944\n\nGot seconds on tea and feel about normal, but hungry. Had some sweet rice at noon. Ate bread, margarine and jam after soup. Quite a number of prisoners collapsed at roll call tonight. We talked about lakes and cottages before bed to night.\n\nApril 4, 1944\n\nToday's menu - Coffee, pea soup with strings of meat in it, bread ration plus jam, real thin barley and peas for supper.\n\nApril 5, 1944\n\nAt 6:00 AM a shipment of Americans left. Dale left too. We had thick barley soup; very flat. I counted bread as they unloaded it. About five hundred fifty loaves so there must be about fifteen hundred prisoners left here. Got a new butter tin. We have been working on a tunnel. Carry the dirt in our pockets and pants cuffs and drop it outside. The place is bare ground. We stand around in groups to conceal our actions and shuffle our feet to mix the dirt into the ground. We went down about seven feet, then dug towards the fence. It was slow using tin cans and a hunk of steel to dig with. I think there are too many people involved in this operation. Washed a handkerchief and fixed my bed (four blankets) and read the Gospel. Roll call, tea, bread and soup at about 4:30.\n\nApril 6, 1944\n\nHad seconds at noon; leaves, barley, macaroni and meat. Very good. Sat in the sun and picked lice. Some dive- bombers east of here! Same soup for supper. I had my usual headache. Met an English motorcycle enthusiast.\n\nApril 7, 1944\n\nBoth roll calls before soup. Jerry took off this PM. Leaves and macaroni for dinner.\n\nApril 8, 1944\n\nI got new straw, new fleas and lice today. My bed is on the floor in straw. One killed and two wounded on a break attempt at nightfall.\n\nApril 9, 1944\n\nWe had simple services by an English officer. I got seconds on leaves and cauliflower and macaroni for supper. Got a bit of cheese and butter with the bread ration. Five men on a loaf.\n\nApril 10, 1944\n\nBoth roll calls in AM. Sunday was quite warm. I built a little fire and boiled my underwear to kill the lice. We had about an hour's entertainment. The Russians danced and sang a couple of numbers. English and Americans told jokes and sang. It was okay. I picked the oats out of the straw and ate them. We get awfully hungry. Today was some kind of German holiday.\n\nApril 11, 1944\n\nWe had simple rites for the P.O.W. who was killed. I guess they buried him in a cemetery on the hill. I started a cat tail with old wool socks I've been collecting.\n\nApril 13, 1944\n\nGot my hair clipped by a P.O.W. The lice are terrible lately. I washed my shirt in hot water in my helmet. I did lots of French Knitting the last two days. It passes time real well.\n\nApril 14,1944\n\nLots of dive-bombers and heavy bombers today. I lost my jam ration to Matthews for the past two days. I boiled my underwear and socks in my helmet. Also knitted about eight feet yesterday.\n\nApril 15, 1944\n\nWe had entertainment again tonight. Africans (colored) put on a Zulu War Dance and sang a couple good numbers, The Russians sang a couple good numbers. Dark skinned New Zealanders put on a War Dance and a couple songs. A Frenchman sang Ava Maria. Lots of dive-bombers and heavies today. I could hear planes going South through the night for a time.\n\nApril 16,1944\n\nI picked some clover and cooked it, but it was too strong to be good. The bread and jam seemed extra good today. We have been getting lots of greens and cauliflower of late.\n\nApril 17, 1944\n\nGot a hot shower and was deloused today. (This usually meant he had a soapy shower, his head was shaved, and his clothes were steamed to try to kill the lice.) Also got a piece of black Italian soap tonight. Our section seems very unorganized yet.\n\nApril 18, 1944\n\nSlept well. I started making a pair of carpet slippers out of burlap and blanket material. Anti-aircraft guns have been moved into nearby hills.\n\nApril 19, 1944\n\nI slept well, but have terrible hunger pains. Finished the carpet slippers that I started yesterday. I found a fellow who will trade a needle for some of my bread ration. We have a new crew that has taken over the kitchen. Now one person is present at all times to see that all rations are used for the men. It sure is horrible waiting for food. At times it seems unbearable.\n\nApril 20, 1944\n\nI traded a pair of socks for two needles and a thimble. Worked on other carpet slippers today. We had a small serving of fish today. It sure was good. My hunger pains have been especially bad today. Worked on the outside detail this AM, got nothing. Zollner traded my OD socks today for two bread rations and eight leaves of tobacco.\n\nApril 22, 1944\n\nLots of heavy bomber action today. I got my shipment card yesterday. Underground work on the tunnel is carried on for twenty-four hours. Bed slats are used to shore-up the tunnel roof wherever dirt wants to cave in. I traded tobacco for three bread, three jam and one butter ration. Traded shoes for two oleo (butter), one bread, two jam and one pair of size eleven or twelve Italian shoes. I found a beautiful large potato this AM. Gave one ration of bread to - ? -. During the day I ate three and one half bread rations.\n\n(They would use twigs and leaves to fuel fire and cook in a tin can or helmet)\n\nApril 23, 1944\n\nI traded a field jacket and bread ration for a combat jacket. I had quite a bad stomach cramp after coffee (too much bread). We had sweet rice for supper. I gave most of it away.\n\nApril 24, 1944\n\nRumors about landing are going around lately. I darned a sock. Hundreds of planes went over. Saw one go down from anti-aircraft fire. The Russians seem to be saying it is OK.\n\nApril 26, 1944\n\nWe had sweet oatmeal for dinner. I traded a slice of bread for a soup ration for supper. Made pudding with bread and soup. Obtained several addresses to write to for stamps after the war. (One of Ray's hobbies was collecting stamps.) Made oleo and jam trades.\n\nApril 27, 1944\n\nQuite bad indigestion today.\n\nApril 28, 1944\n\n(My notes are not legible). Two parachutes came down from bombers today. Had thin bean soup. Had simple rites for P.O.W. who was killed by locals after he escaped last week.\n\nApril 30, 1944\n\nHole was discovered last night. We were called out for roll call. The guards came in with dogs and went directly to the spot beneath the bed where we were excavating. We were going to surface the following night. Someone squealed. The three who slept above the hole and hut commander were put in solitary on \"special\" rations. Most of us were moved to hut #7. About one hundred fifty old P.O.W.s came in this morning. I learned to knit straight from an Indian. I took an old sock toe and watched an Indian for about an hour. Made needles from wire. It is quite slow. I was moved to hut #1 and now have a bottom bunk. Lost a ration and half of bread wrapped in a handkerchief and rolled up in a blanket. It was stolen."
