        "text": "In the nomenclature of medicine there is no disease so little thought of and yet none, when permitted to become chronic, so subtle or so fatal in its character as catarrh. It often originates in coryza, or ordinary cold, and as such, when the inflammation is local, extending not beyond the Schniederian membrane, it is readily reached and with proper attention may be removed. When, however, it is neglected, the disease rapidly but silently spreads itself, and soon the patient finds himself surrounded by a web of diseases that are certain to carry him to the grave, unless he is fortunate in finding one who, knowing the gravity of his case, applies remedies that cannot fail to reach and ultimately destroy not only the parent affection, but all the attendant horrors that follow in its fiery train. From coryza, catarrh may develop itself into gravedo, attacking the frontal sinuses, and then we have what is called \"cold in the head:\" if from the nose and head it extends to the fauces or posterior part of the mouth, sore throat results, which rapidly spreads to the glottis and pharynx, inducing cough and hoarseness, and, following these, we have (provided the affection is not arrested) opthalmia, deafness, the paralyzation and eventual destruction of the digestive organs, and last stage of all, phthisis. Thus we have the origin and some of the phenomena of a disease which, often proceeding from cold, ends in death. The acrid matter which is secreted in the nose and head, where abscesses are formed, drops on the tongue; and thence, as it burns its way down the throat, attacks the stomach, and presently the villous coating is affected. With offensive breath, the tongue is often swollen and the skin removed, and the action of the papillae paralyzed, if not utterly destroyed. There are many other affections that originate in catarrh which it is not necessary to speak specifically of in this place, as we desire to present, in the person of one who is notorious in our City, a striking example of how far, when improperly treated, catarrh may undermine the physical constitution, and then how readily it can be made to yield to scientific treatment.\n\nW.S. HUTCHINGS, aged 31 years, (well known to the community as the \"Lightning Calculator,\" now and for years past giving exhibitions at BARNUM's Museum,) is a man of small stature, but of large chest and brain, lungs well developed, and voice deep and sonorous. Although his temperament is what is commonly called sanguine-nervous, slightly. intermixed with the lymphatic and bilious, he continued to enjoy excellent health up to the Autumn of 1861, when he perceived that he was not unfrequently rendered uncomfortable by stoppages in the nose. The affection he attributed to cold, which he believed would soon pass away. Trifling and common remedies were employed, but to his surprise, instead of relief being brought about, the stoppage increased, and soon he found he could not breathe through the nasal organs. However, he continued his daily occupations, and was only really aroused to a sense of his danger by the formation of an abscess in the upper part of the nose, near the base of the cephalogia, followed by copious discharges of acrid and viscous matter on the tongue, and thence over the esophagus into the stomach. At this stage Mr. HUTHCHINGS called on a physician, who prescribed, but instead of finding relief, he perceived that his digestive apparatus was seriously affected, and that his lungs were not as they should be. When he spoke his voice gave forth, to him, a hollow sound, while at the same time it seemed to painfully reverberate in his head -- it feeling, as he expressed it to us, as if it were \"like a drum, hollow.\" Added to these calamities, his hearing became affected, through the Eustachian tube becoming inflamed and wholly choked, thereby preventing air from circulating within the ear, and his sight gradually failed him. At this stage he consulted another physician, and the remedies administered brought temporary relief; but toward the close of 1862, the disease returned upon him in four-fold energy; and from that time until within the past forty days, he suffered, to again employ one of his expressions, \"all the agonies of the damned.\" It was with horror he contemplated the approach of night, and on retiring he would convulsively roll himself in the bedclothes and pray to be relieved, even by the intervention of death, of his manifold sufferings. Life had become a curse to him. His tongue was raw, his throat inflamed, his stomach almost eaten up, in which there seemed to be constant pain and thirst, as if burning, but which no liquid could assuage, and his nervous system was entirely shattered -- so much so that when he called on us, he presented the appearance of one who had been visited by delirium tremens. His agonies of mind and tortures of body may be imagined -they certainly cannot be described. His visit to us was to inquire into the character, as a physician, of Dr. VON EISENBERG, so universally acknowledged as the most accomplished aurist and oculist of the present day. In answer to his questions, we stated we had not the slightest doubt the Doctor could remove the cause of his complaint, and strongly urged he should call on him, remarking that if he was beyond the reach of human skill, he would be informed of the fact; but if he could be restored to health, and the Doctor pledged himself to that effect, he might, with entire trust, place himself in his hands. He resolved, at the close of the interview, to call on the Doctor, and we did not see nor hear from him for three weeks. At the expiration of that time he again visited us, and we do not go too far when we say that, contrasted with his former condition, his appearance astonished us. He was another man. The tones of his voice were natural; his eyes clear and apparently strong, and his hearing acute. His tongue is no longer swollen, and he assured us his nose was clear of its mucous accumulations, and that the hollow sound which he complained of in his head had entirely disappeared; his sleep, also, was normal, and he experienced no tremor or mental disturbance when night approached, as was formerly the case. In a word, he declared himself a new man, full of life and energy, and ready for work. We cannot say that he has been entirely cured, but the affection is thoroughly broken, and he has been assured that his entire cure is certain. In two or three weeks he will be discharged convalescent.\n\nWe think it is but just to Dr. VON EISENBERG to call public attention to this case. There are hundreds in the community suffering from catarrh, who, [like the \"Lightning Calculator,\") if not actually praying for death, are ready to accept of anything that promises to relieve them from their distresses. To such we would say, trifle not with inexperienced men, but consult, without unnecessary delay, Dr. VON EISENBERG, who, at least, has the honesty to assure his patients whether it is within his power to make them whole or not.-New-York Dispatch, Nov. 15."
