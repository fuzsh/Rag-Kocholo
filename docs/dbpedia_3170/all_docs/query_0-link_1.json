        "text": "starring Clint Eastwood, Jeff Bridges\n\nHiding from his revengeful fellow gang-members, John \"Thunderbolt\" Doherty, narrowly escapes being shot when a handsome young drifter picks him up in a stolen car. The older man and \"Lightfoot\" strike up an unlikely but, eventually, deep friendship and attempt - with two others - to duplicate an early robbery. The half-million dollar haul is spectacularly successful until the gang fall out and violence erupts. This exciting caper movie, set in Montana, is also a fascinating study of a \"lost soul\" nearly saved by the innocent generosity of the extrovert \"Lightfoot\"."
