        "text": "THE bright new star of \"Every Which Way but Loose\" is an orangutan named Clyde, and he has quite a repertory. He can kiss human actors, smile bashfully and make obscene hand gestures. He can fling up his arms and fall over in a faint, in a game of bang-bang-you're-dead. He can steal scenes even when they aren't worth stealing.Clyde's many talents notwithstanding, it's alarming to find Clint Eastwood co-starring with an ape. Mr. Eastwood's career since \"Dirty Harry\" has constituted one long argument for the studio system, for the days before established actors acquired so much control over their own movies that they could work on the flimsiest, most aimless projects with impurity. It's been a long time since Mr. Eastwood made a movie designed for a star.Some of his directorial efforts have been impressive, and his choice of Michael Cimino to direct \"Thunderbolt and Lightfoot\" certainly indicates that his taste in protégés is shrewd. But his last couple of films have been so lackadaisically plotted, and so haphazardly put together, that they come close to resembling loose strings of blackout sketches with no particular end in sight.Mr. Eastwood doesn't have the kind of comic agility that would make these episodes individually bright, nor does he tie them together with consistent, tightly coiled characterizations anymore. Far from showing off Mr. Eastwood to flattering advantage, this kind of format virtually eclipses his talents.\"Every Which Way but Loose,\" which opens today at Flagship theaters, is the slackest and most harebrained of Mr. Eastwood's recent movies. It is overlong and virtually uneventful, even though there are half a dozen cute characters and woolly subplots competing for the viewer's attentions. Ruth Gordon plays Mr. Eastwood's mother, and the cute thing about her is that she curses and owns a shotgun and can't pass her driving test. Sondra Locke plays a country singer with whom Mr. Eastwood is smitten, and it there's anything cute about her at all, it's the fact that she absolutely can't sing.As for the subplots, one has to do with a couple of cops who feel slighted by Mr. Eastwood in a barroom encounter and decide to chase him. Another involves a ne'er-do-well gang of motorcycle hoods who also tangle with Mr. Eastwood and follow him around. A third involves a love affair between Mr. Eastwood's brother and a woman he meets at a fruit stand. A fourth involves Mr. Eastwood's picking fights that his brother can bet on from time to time. No wonder Clyde is the man of the hour.If \"Every Which Way but Loose\" gets anywhere at all, it will be on the strength of Mr. Eastwood's considerable charisma, and on the fact that he and Miss Locke work well together even when there's nothing to work on. In \"The Enforcer,\" in which they also co-starred, Mr. Eastwood played a slow-witted cop whom Miss Locke was forever outsmarting, and the departure from his usual tough-guy cynicism was reasonably intriguing. Here, though, the only clearly defined role is Clyde's. The others merely muddle through.\"Every Which Way but Loose,\" which is rated PG (\"Parental Guidance Suggested\"), contains a certain amount of rough language, mostly from Miss Gordon, and a little libidinous activity, mostly from Clyde.\n\nMonkey Business\n\nEVERY WHICH WAY BUT LOOSE, directed by James Fargo; written by Jeremy Joe Kronsberg; director of photography, Rexford Metz; editors, Ferris Webster and Joel Cox; music supervision, rector, Elayne Ceder; produced by Robert Daley; released by Warner Bros. At Flagship theaters. Running time: 114 minutes. This film has been rated PG.Philo Beddoe . . . . . Clint EastwoodLynn Halsey-Taylor . . . . . Sondra LockeOrville . . . . .
