        "text": "A nice blend of action, drama and road movie with Clint in good form but itâ€™s Jeff Bridges who walks away with the film as his impulsive but naive sidekick. An enjoyable, almost casual debut by writer/director Cimino (not like most of his later films).\n\nWith the help of an irreverent young sidekick, a bank robber gets his old gang back together to organize a daring new heist."
