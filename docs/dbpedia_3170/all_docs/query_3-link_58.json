        "text": "Starring: Harrison Ford, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Antonio Banderas, Toby Jones, Thomas Kretschmann, Boyd Holbrook, John Rhys-Davies, Karen Allen, Ethann Isidore, Olivier Riches, Shaunette Renee Wilson and Mads Mikkelsen\n\nDirector: James Mangold\n\nDistribution : Walt Disney Studio Motion Pictures, Walt Disney Pictures, -100 Years Of Wonder, Paramount Pictures, - A Viacom Company, Lucasfilms Ltd\n\nDuration Running Time : (approx) 2 Hrs 34 Mins (154 Minutes)\n\nCertification Rating Certificate: 12A\n\nOnce upon a time, in a galaxy far far away ... 'so they say' - way back in 1973, nearly fifty years ago, - George Walton Lucas Jnr, an up-and-coming movie producer from Modesto, California, USA, wrote a story called 'The Adventures Of Indiana Smith' - and like 'Star Wars' which was released 'four years later' - 1977 - featuring Mark Hamill, as Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia Organa and Harrison Ford as Han Solo - whose performance alone 'catapulted him into a movie star' - this was classed as an opportunity to 'recreate' the 'cinematic modern-day version movie serials' that were shown in movie theatres during the 1930's - 1940's.\n\nThen in 1966, aged 'twenty-four' years old, Harrison J.Ford first made his 'movie debut' in 'Dead Heat On A Merry Go-Round' featuring James Coburn, Camilla Sparv and Robert Webber and 'Luv'- 1967, - featuring Jack Lemmon, Elaine May and Peter Falk - yes Lt Columbo himself.\n\nNow these were classed as 'uncredited' - ie :although he appeared in the movies, but his name 'didn't feature' in the credits, and by 1967, - 'one year later'- Ford was featured in 'A Time For Killing' - this was in fact a 'WESTERN' directed by both Roger Corman and Phil Karlson and featured Glenn Ford, Inger Stevens, George Hamilton and Ford himself as Lt Schafer - his first ever speaking role in a movie.\n\nBut there also lies a dramatic 'twist' to this story as Ford has no middle name' so he used the initial J, just to appear in the movie, but this middle initial name has no meaning and also that in his 'early years' as an actor - by working at Universal Studios is that during the late 1960's and early 1970's that he appeared in shows such as 'GUNSMOKE' - featuring James Arness, 'IRONSIDE' - featuring Raymond Burr, 'THE VIRGINIAN' - featuring Doug McClure and Lee J.Cobb, 'THE FBI' - featuring Efrem Zimbalist Jnr, Philip Abbott and William Reynolds, 'LOVE, AMERICAN STYLE' - featuring Diane Keaton and 'KUNG-FU' - featuring David Carradine - and also appeared in 'bit-parts' and also supporting roles as well.\n\nFord originally wanted to distinguish himself from Harrison J Ford - born March 16, 1884, - a successful silent movie actor -and involved in the era of the silent movie and who between 1915 -1932 - 'seventeen years' - had appeared in more than 'eighty' films - he sadly passed away on December 2, 1957, aged 73 years old.\n\nFord later said that he was unaware of the existence of 'the earlier actor' - until he came upon a star with his own name on The Hollywood Walk Of Fame.\n\nHowever, just before 'Star Wars', Ford, who was working a carpenter, - and his carpentry skills helped him to get selected for the role of Han Solo - had featured in movies such as 'Journey To Shiloh’ - 1968, - a western also starring James Caan, Michael Sarrazin, Brenda Scott, Don Stroud, Jan-Michael Vincent and James Gammon, 'Getting Straight' featuring Elliott Gould, Candice Bergen and Jeff Corey plus 'Zabriskie Point' set in Zabriskie Point, that’s situated in Death Valley, California, directed by Michelangelo Antonioni with a screenplay by Sam Shepard not forgetting an incredible soundtrack featuring 'Pink Floyd', 'The Greatful Dead' plus 'The Rolling Stones' and also featuring Mark Frechette, Daria Halprin, Rod Taylor and Ford in ‘an uncredited role’ as a student - both 1970.\n\nAnd then there was also 'American Graffiti' - directed by Lucas and featuring the likes of Ron Howard, Richard Dreyfuss, Charles Martin Smith, Paul Le Mat, Cindy Williams who sadly 'passed away' on January 25, 2023, at the age of 'seventy-five' years and 'Wolfman Jack' - aka Robert Weston Smith - 'his real name' - as an American DJ and 'The Conversation' -1974 - produced, written and directed by Francis Ford Coppola and featuring Gene Hackman, John Cazale, Allen Garfield, -aka Allen Goorwitz - his real name, Cindy Williams - again, Frederic Forrest - also again and also Robert Duvall - only this time in 'an uncredited role' - as 'The Director'.\n\nNow it was at the time, and by sheer coincidence that although there wasn't a connection at the time between Ford and Lucas, who was working in Coppola's office, - simply by handling a carpentry job and also Lucas invited Ford into his office - for an audition in Lucas's forthcoming movie Star Wars as Han Solo.\n\nBut according to Ford, he explained that he was working on an elaborate portico entrance when Lucas walked in with Richard Dreyfuss, star of JAWS -1975 - and directed by Spielberg as Matt Hooper - a Marine biologist who has 'a fascination for sharks' and also hired by APD Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), during the 'INFAMOUS AMITY ISLAND INCIDENT OF JULY 1974' - and also that Hooper along with Brody and also Quint, (Robert Shaw), - a grizzled-old sea-captain aboard the 'ORCA' - a sea vessel - as part of a basic plan - to catch and kill the 'PREDATORY GREAT WHITE SHARK' - that had 'stalked a claim' off Amity Island, - as one of the first auditions for the part of Han Solo.\n\nThen Ford thought to himself that in the back of his mind that somehow that a bell was about to be rung with George -and eventually Ford 'got the part' of Han Solo - after Ford appeared in 'American Graffiti' - 1973, as Bob Falfa - while he was still working on a job as a carpenter.\n\nBut in the book 'How Star Wars Conquered The Universe' - THE PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE OF A MULTI-DOLLAR BILLION FRANCHISE - by Chris Taylor - Fred Roos, - a CASTING DIRECTOR and also an AMERICAN FILM PRODUCER said the following statement : 'Harrison had done a lot of carpentry for me' - and he also continued saying - '' He needed money, he had kids, but he wasn't a big star yet '' and that the day that he was doing it George Lucas happened to be there, - it was in fact 'serendipitous'.\n\nFive years later, -1979 - Duvall, Forrest and Ford were ‘reunited’ in ‘APOCALYPSE NOW’ - THE ORIGINAL VERSION, featuring Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando this epic war film which Coppola, not only produced and directed, but also co-wrote the screenplay with John Milius, also an American film director and screenwriter as well and Michael Herr, - who was not only an American writer, and who ''two years earlier'' - in 1977 wrote a novel called 'DISPATCHES' - about his 'experiences' working for 'ESQUIRE' - A US MAGAZINE as a war correspondent that's especially dedicated for 'gentleman' - as a men's magazine - during 'THE VIETNAM WAR', and it was 'described' by The New York Book Review as 'THE BEST TO HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THE VIETNAM WAR'.\n\nNow, originally Milius became interested in 'adapting' HEART OF DARKNESS for a Vietnam war setting in the late 1960's, and initially began developing the film with Coppola as producer and Lucas as director.\n\nHowever after Lucas became unavailable,Coppola then took over directorial control, and was 'influenced by 'AGUIRRE WRATH OF GOD', -1972- written, produced and directed by Werner Herzog and featuring Klaus Kinski - 'A HERZOG REGULAR' - who appeared in 'the title role' as Lope de Aguirre, a Spanish soldier who leads a group of Conquistadores down the 'Amazon River' in search of the 'legendary City Of Gold' - known as 'EL DORADO' in his approach for the material.\n\nThe film is 'loosely' based on 'Heart Of Darkness' - by Joseph Conrad, and published in 1899, now the original novel centered around Charles Marlow, a sailor, and who tells his listeners the story of his 'assignment' as a steamer captain for a Belgian company in the African interior, but in the film this differs from the ‘novella’ as the movie version concentrates on a river journey from South Vietnam into Cambodia undertaken by Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen), who is on a secret mission to assassinate Colonel Walter E Kurtz,(Marlon Brando), a renegade Special Forces officer who is accused of murder and presumed ‘insane’.\n\nThe ensemble cast also featured Dennis Hopper, as an American Photojournalist Albert Hall, as 'Chief', Sam Bottoms, as Lance an ocean surfer and who also starred in 'The Outlaw Josey Wales' with Frederic Forrest as Chef, Duvall as Lieutenant Colonel William 'Bill' Kilgore and Laurence Fishburne as Tyrone Miller, and known as a 'cocky seventeen-years-old of age' Gunner's Mate - 3rd Class from the Bronx - 'a District Suburban area in New York City' and 'nicknamed as Mr Clean.\n\nBut in March 1976, when production began the young man was just 14 years, and having 'LIED ABOUT HIS AGE' - in order to get the part and filming of this took so long that on its completion the youngster who became a man was 'seventeen' years of age.\n\nJust for the record this epic war movie which had a lot of personal issues while it was being made for example when production began shooting in the Philippines - originally for 'five months' was extended to over a year due to the extreme bad weather then like Sheen suffered a heart attack, plus Brando and Hopper almost came to blows over dinner because of the novel and Coppola had a nervous breakdown - has resulted in 'FOUR DIFFERENT CUT VERSIONS OF THE MOVIE - this includes the 'THEATRICAL/ORIGINAL VERSION' at 2 Hrs 33 Mins,(153 mins), 'REDUX' at 3 Hrs 15 Mins,(195 mins) a 'WORKPRINT VERSION' at 2 Hrs 27 Mins (147 mins - this version alone excludes the main credits ) and 'THE FINAL CUT VERSION' at about 3 Hrs 3 Mins, (183 mins).\n\nFor the record, 'A WORKPRINT VERSION' is basically known as simply - 'A ROUGH DRAFT CUT OF THE MOVIE' - this means that the version shown entirely with 'NO CREDITS' - however, it also means that all film editors working on movies - would in fact 'MAKE ALL THE POTENTIAL EDITORIAL CUTS' - whether for extended/reduced versions for release in movie theaters - and then 'RUN IT PAST THE ORIGINAL FILM DIRECTOR' for 'THE FINAL OK VERSION' - before editing 'THE ORIGINAL FILM NEGATIVE OF THE MOVIE' in question.\n\nNow, Lucas had discussed the 'concept' with Philip Kaufman, also a director and screenwriter who had worked with him for several weeks and decided upon the 'ARK OF THE COVENANT' as the 'MacGuffin'.\n\nHowever, the project was stalled when Clint Eastwood asked Kaufman to write the script for 'The Outlaw Josey Wales' -1976 - which Kaufman was also the original director and Robert Daley, a Hollywood film producer who produced this 'revolutionist' blood-thirsty Western as well.\n\nAlthough, it was that during a heated argument between Kaufman and Eastwood, it was Kaufman who left the project and Eastwood was 'promoted' as director of the picture by the request of Daley, who by the way was also an executive producer as well.\n\nDaley has also been involved in either produced or even executive produced of at least thirteen other Clint Eastwood movies, and they include the following : as a producer - 'Play Misty For Me' - 1971, 'High Plains Drifter', 'Breezy' 'Magnum Force' - all 1973, 'Thunderbolt And Lightfoot' - 1974 - this featured scriptwriter Michael Cimino who went on to direct 'The Deer Hunter' back in 1978 and 'Heaven's Gate' - 1980, - this is in fact -'AN EPIC WESTERN' - starring Kris Kristofferson, Christopher Walken, Isabelle Huppert, Sam Waterston and also John Hurt - which was “loosely based on the Johnson County War that took place in Johnson County, Wyoming, in 1889 -1893 - lasting four years and it revolves around a dispute between land barons and European immigrants in Wyoming - Circa:1890’s,- directed by Cimino and was condemned as 'one of the worst films ever made in the history of cinema'- it was resulted by many film historians as a financial failure that also resulted in the demise of director-driven film production in the American film industry, steering back toward ‘greater studio-control of films in general -'The Eiger Sanction' - 1975, 'The Enforcer' - 1976, 'The Gauntlet' -1977 and 'Every Which Way But Loose' - 1978 - plus as an executive producer - 'Dirty Harry -1971, 'Joe Kidd' - 1972, 'Escape From Alcatraz' - 1979 and 'Bronco Billy', 'Any Which Way You Can' - both 1980.\n\nJust for the record - a MacGuffin or sometimes known as a 'McGuffin'- and no it isn't a McMuffin breakfast meal consisting of a lightly-toasted Double Sausage and Egg McMuffin plus Hash Browns - which basically are potatoes that are fried until they become ''browned'' - and also fresh orange juice in a small bottle that you enjoy at your heart's content and also 'fills the gap' - well until lunchtime anyway - at the home of McDonalds -known as - 'THE GOLDEN ARCHES' - aka 'a fast-food restaurant' - other food joints are also available - for this is in fact an object, a device or even an event that is necessary to the 'plot' and also the motivation of the characters, but also an insignificant unimportant or irrelevant in itself.\n\nThe 'MACGUFFIN' is what springs the characters - either 'THE GOOD GUYS' or even 'THE BAD GUYS' into action, but also that someone has to be after something, and that there must be overwhelming 'ODDS' in the way of the 'GOAL' in question ie: 'CASABLANCA' - 1942, directed by Michael Curtiz, - that 'the stolen letters of transit' - are in fact - 'THE MCGUFFIN'.\n\nThere are in fact many movies that use this 'TECHNIQUE' -in the history of cinema and that these 'ELEMENTS' of examples which include the following : like many Alfred Hitchcock movies such as 'THE 39 STEPS' - the original 1935 version featuring Robert Donat - a Manchester born actor - born in Withington - a suburb of South Manchester - and Madeleine Carroll - and based on the novel by John Buchan - originally published in 1915, 'THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH' - both the 1934 'ORIGINAL' featuring Leslie Banks and Peter Lorre and also the 1956 'REMAKE VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL FILM' - featuring James Stewart and Doris Day, and 'PULP FICTION' 1994 - this is in fact an epic crime-drama consisting of 'FOUR INTERTWINING TALES' OF CRIME AND VIOLENCE IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - directed by Quentin Tarantino and from an original story that he conceived with Roger Avary and also featuring an all-star cast like John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis, - who are in fact 'prime examples'.\n\nGeorge Lucas had believed in a different MacGuffin definition than Hitchcock and Lucas himself thought that the audience should care about the MacGuffin as much as the characters in question.\n\nHowever, ''UNDER HIS DEFINITION'' - 'THE ONE RING' - from 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' - directed by Peter Jackson - and which also became a FRANCHISE in its own right and also 'ROSEBUD' - ''SPOILER ALERT'' - it is a trade name from a cheap little sled that Kane was actually playing on - from 'CITIZEN KANE' - produced, directed and starring Orson Welles - would be considered as MacGuffins.\n\nNow the term was originated by Angus MacPhail, an English screenwriter, for film and was later adopted by Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock, KBE, and was later extended to a similar device in other fictions, but this technique is common in films especially in the 'genre' of the 'thriller' - but now it has been posited that 'GUFF' - as a word - for anything that is trivial or even worthless - may lie at the root.\n\nHowever, back in 1939, when Hitchcock himself attended a lecture at Columbia University - he explains the term of a MacGuffin and quoting the following :\n\n(We) have a name in the studio, and we call it as the 'MACGUFFIN', because it is simply the mechanical element that usually crops up in every story - and that in many crook stories - that it is almost always the necklace, and that in spy stories - it is most always the papers.\n\nThen in 1956, when the remake version of 'THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH' featuring James Stewart - 'a Hitchcock regular' - appearing in 'REAR WINDOW' and also ‘ROPE’ and Doris Day, aka Doris Mary Keppelhoff - her real name - wasn’t only just an actress, but also a singer and an animal rights activist as well, the song “QUE SERA SERA” - ('WHATEVER WILL BE, WILL BE' - ‘WE’RE GOING TO WEMBLEY’ ) , was performed by Day herself in the movie - her character in the film was a ‘well-known’ and who’s now retired as ‘a professional singer’ - for this performance alone won an Academy Award - aka ‘an Oscar’ in 1956 - for ‘BEST ORIGINAL SONG’ - but also her ‘ORIGINAL RECORDING’ of the song - had reached #2 in the US pop charts and also #1 in the UK pop charts as well.\n\nInterestingly, this was Hitchcock's 'second' movie of his directorial career using this title and following his own 1934 original version of the same name but for the remake this featured a significantly different plot and also script as well.\n\nBy May 1977, Lucas was in Maui, an island that's situated on the State of Hawaii and also trying to escape 'the worldwide success of 'STAR WARS' - just chilling out- as you do - and also by sheer coincidence Steven Spielberg, his friend and colleague, was also there taking a break on vacation from work on 'CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND' - his forthcoming movie which was also released that same year - in 1977.\n\nBut it was while both these successful filmmakers were on vacation in Hawaii, that they were reminiscing about when they were kids and watching these movie-serials - CIRCA - 1930's - that were filled with plenty of 'CLIFFHANGERS' and also 'NARROW ESCAPES' - simply by bringing back the sheer giddiness and which also setting up the tones for major forthcoming blockbusters of the 1980's.\n\nLucas, apart from creating 'THE STAR WARS' and 'THE INDIANA JONES FRANCHISES' was also the original founders of 'LUCASFILMS', 'LUCASARTS', 'INDUSTRIAL LIGHT AND MAGIC - ILM' and 'THX' - 'the abbreviation of this actually means 'THANKS' or even 'THANK YOU' - for the record.\n\nLucas is also considered to be one of the most significant figures of the 20th-Century New Hollywood movement, and also 'a true pioneer' of the 'modern-blockbuster movie'.\n\nBack in 1967, Lucas himself had graduated from the University of Southern California and also co-founded 'AMERICAN ZOETROPE' with Francis Ford-Coppola, - who was also an American filmmaker, then in 1971, Lucas wrote and directed 'THX-1138' - this was in fact based on 'ELECTRIC LABYRINTH' : THX-1138 4EB, which was in fact, 'a critical success' - but also classed as 'a financial failure'.\n\nLucas is also one of history's most financially successful filmmakers - and for his trouble - is that been nominated for at least - 'FOUR ACADEMY AWARDS' - aka 'THE OSCARS' - and that his films alone are among the 100 highest-grossing movies at the North American box-office, - this in turn is adjusted for ticket-price inflation.\n\nHis next work as a writer/director was 'AMERICAN GRAFFITI' - in 1973, - this was in fact inspired by his youth in the early 1960's at Modesto, California, - his place of birth - and was also produced through the newly founded Lucasfilms, - the film itself was in fact 'critically and also commercially successful' and received in total about 'FIVE ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS' -including 'BEST PICTURE' and also 'BEST DIRECTOR'.\n\nSpielberg, on the other hand also co-founded 'AMBLIN ENTERTAINMENT' in 1980 - founded by Spielberg, a director/producer and also Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, both film producers, - its original Headquarters - HQ - was situated in Bungalow 477 of the Universal Studios backlot in Universal City, California and it distributes all of the films from Amblin Partners that are under the banner of Amblin Entertainment, and 'DREAMWORKS' SKG - aka Dreamworks Pictures and Dreamworks Studios was formed on October 12, 1994, - this includes Jeffrey Katzenberg a former chairman of Walt Disney Pictures and also David Geffen, an American business magnate/former record producer, and he has also served as a producer for many successful films and television series.\n\nNot only that but he has also had a long collaboration with film composer John Williams with whom he has worked for all but five of his feature films plus several of Spielberg's works of masterpieces are considered to be among not only classed as 'THE GREATEST FILMS IN HISTORY', but also that some are amongst those as 'THE HIGHEST-GROSSING FILMS EVER MADE', and that 'PREMIERE' - 'THE FRENCH FILM MAGAZINE' - 'RANKED HIM AS - THE *1 - in the list of 100 Most Powerful People in Movies, then in 2013, - 'TIME MAGAZINE' - listed him as 'ONE OF THE 100 MOST INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE', and by 2023, - Spielberg was 'the recipient' of the FIRST-EVER 'TIME 100 IMPACT AWARD in the US alone.\n\nNow it was during this time while on vacation that Spielberg told Lucas that he was interested in making 'a James Bond film', to which Lucas replied to him of an idea 'that's better than James Bond' outlining the plot of 'RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK', - the first film originally released in movie theatres back in 1981, and directed by Spielberg.\n\nSpielberg loved it, calling it as 'a James Bond film' but without the hardware and had the original character's surname changed from Smith to Jones and the two men made a 'deal' with Paramount Pictures - 'a film studio' for 'FIVE INDIANA JONES' movies, these five movies in the movie series -which also became a 'film franchise' are known as a 'PENTALOGY'.\n\nThe definition of the word 'PENTALOGY' refers to 'a compound literacy or even narrative work that is divided into five equal parts that are connected - its like your favourite soap opera shown 'five times a week' - whilst ‘PULLING ON YOUR FAKE JUMPSUITS' and also ‘MAKING YOUR MIND UP’ when deciding to go to 'THE LAND OF MAKE BELIEVE' just to grab ‘A PIECE OF THE ACTION’ and also bumping into your rival who's disguised as 'PETER PAN' plus she’s in a world of her own - on her way to 'NEVERLAND' - probably to meet a guy called Michael - and which turns out none other than a girl called Sandra who was once your close friend that you once worked with closely but is now your true enemy - there's an old saying 'KEEP YOUR FRIENDS CLOSE BUT ALSO YOUR ENEMIES CLOSER'' - which is advertising your favourite soap opera that you purchased at your local markets - 'for your esteem pleasure' and watched by millions on their television sets that are located in their establishments.\n\nAlso for the record that a “PENTALOGY” is actually - a ''FIVE POINTED STAR'' that’s used in the art of Witchcraft, it is also a compound literary or even narrative work that is explicity 'DIVIDED INTO FIVE PARTS', but although the modern use of the word that the 'PARTS IN QUESTION' are reasonably 'SELF-CONTAINED' and also that the structure was intended by 'THE ORIGINAL WORKS OF THE AUTHOR' - historically, neither was necessarily true: that in fact - a 'PENTALOGIA', aka 'PENTALOGY ' - 'ENGLISH' - could also be assembled by a later editor - just as 'PLOTINUS' - a Hellenistic Platonist philosopher, born and raised in Roman Egypt is regarded by modern scholarship as 'THE FOUNDER OF 'NEOPLATONISM' - his 'ENNEADS' 'aka' 'THE SIX ENNEADS' - this is a 'COLLECTION OF WRITING WORKS, that were 'edited and compiled' in a 'COLLECTION OF NINES' by 'PORPHYRY OF TYRE' - this is in order to create - 'AN OVERARCHING STRUCTURE OF SIX', and which would also express 'THE IDEA OF PERFECTION'.\n\nInterestingly, there’s a key scene in ‘An American Werewolf In London’ directed by John Landis 'the acclaimed film director of THE BLUES BROTHERS' and released in movie theatres back in 1981, where two American students David Kessler and Jack Goodman (David Naughton and Griffin Dunne) who are on a walking tour of Britain visiting the county of Yorkshire - known to many as God’s Own Country and visit ‘The Slaughtered Lamb’ a village pub that’s situated on the Yorkshire Moors, but then Jack notices a five-pointed star on the pub’s wall, but when he enquires about it the pub-goers including Brian Glover and Rik Mayall - aka the pub regulars - grow hostile and they both leave.\n\nHowever upon leaving the pub-goers warn them to keep to the road, stay clear of the moors and beware the full moon, these two students wander off the road on to the moors and are attacked by a vicious creature where Jack is mauled to death and David is injured, but three weeks later, David wakes up inside a London Hospital and is treated by Alex Price, a beautiful young nurse (Jenny Agutter), star of ‘The Railway Children’, ‘The Railway Children Return’ and also ‘Call The Midwife’ - as Sister Julienne.\n\nNow this is a TV period drama series created by Heidi Thomas and based on the best-selling novels aka 'memoirs' by Jennifer Worth and shown on BBC TV, and also chronicling the lives of a 'GROUP OF MIDWIVES' set in London's East End during the late 1950's and also dealing with the pressures of their 'day to day' lives in an ever changing world.\n\nBack in 1969, - Landis worked as a 'PRODUCTION ASSISTANT' in Yugoslavia on the film 'KELLY'S HEROES',- 1970 - featuring Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas and Donald Sutherland, in which he and a Yugoslavian member of the film crew were driving in the back of the car 'on location' when they came across a 'GROUP OF ROMANI PEOPLE', and these ROMANI PEOPLE were appeared to be 'PERFORMING RITUALS' on a man being buried so that he would not 'RISE FROM THE GRAVE' and this made Landis realise that he would never be able to confront the 'UNDEAD' and also gave him the original idea for 'AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON' and also for 'which that he also wrote the first draft' but also 'shelved it for over a decade - 'ten years' - for a horror movie in which the man would go through the same thing.\n\nFor the record, On February 4, 2003, following the Adoption and Promulgation of the Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro by The Assembly Of The Federal Republic Of Yugoslavia - 'THE OFFICIAL NAME OF 'THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA' was changed to 'SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO'.\n\nMeanwhile by 2008, Lucas himself began researching 'potential plot devices' for a fifth film - which also happens to be the final film in the franchise series, also just for the record a 'Pentalogy' is classed in a series of five movies, although the project to release #5 in the franchise film series was halted for a while.\n\nFour years later’ in 2012, Disney, the studio famous for Mickey Mouse, decided to take an acquisition to buy out Paramount Pictures, the film studio and Lucasfilms and take over proceedings on making the 5th and final movie in the Indiana Jones Film franchise, as Paramount Pictures - the film studio as well as Lucasfilms - the company created by Lucas was responsible for the first four movies as producer and Spielberg was also responsible for directing the first ‘’FOUR FEATURE FILMS” in the series.\n\nBut when 'one of the big boys' like Disney comes knocking at your studio door - and demanding their interest in the franchise you know that an original product that you once created - and in the words of Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill - British Prime Minister - PM - and also the Elder Statesman Of The Conservative Party - aka - The Tories - ''I have spent everything that i own with blood, toil, sweat and tears” and what's about to happen then you know once you hand over your dream project to those running the company about 'THE MOUSE THAT LIVES IN THE HOUSE' is that there'll be some major changes within that company that you know that’s about to be happening like handing directorial duties to an American filmmaker like James Mangold whose CV directing movies is like 'A RECENT ROYAL CORONATION THAT'S FIT FOR A KING LIKE CHARLES III OR EVEN QUEEN CAMILLA TO GOVERN ALL THE LANDS FOR ALL MANKIND'.\n\nOr maybe even the crowning moment when on Saturday June 10, 2023, in Istanbul,Turkey when MANCHESTER CITY- who even did it the hard way - had COMPLETED THE HISTORIC TREBLE WINNING THE PREMIER LEAGUE, THE FA CUP AND NOW THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE - and that every thing that Mangold touches turns into 100% pure gold unlike 'THE HEAVYWEIGHT CROWN THAT LIES UNEASY ON THE HEAD'- and that as a filmmaker who directed such as the following: -'Cop Land' -1997, featuring Sylvester Stallone, Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel, 'Walk The Line'- 2005, with Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon as Johnny Cash and June Carter, '3:10 To Yuma' - the 2007 'remake' featuring Russell Crowe, Christian Bale and Ben Foster of the 1957 'original' - featuring Glenn Ford and Van Heflin and also 'Le Mans '66' (aka 'Ford Vs Ferrari' -US title), - featuring Christian Bale - again - and Matt Damon - but also on the plus side and as a result for their hard-work both Spielberg and Lucas 'stepped aside' their original roles as director and producer by becoming executive producers for this as a reward for all their hard work in the film industry.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company has owned 'THE INDIANA JONES INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY' since its 'ACQUISITION' of Lucasfilm - the series production company back in 2012, when Lucas, who was 'THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMPANY'- at the time - sold it for a cool $ 4 billion, (£3,213,420,000.00 -UK), and that WALT DISNEY STUDIO 'OWNS' -'THE DISTRIBUTION' - and also 'THE MARKETING RIGHTS' - to future 'INDIANA JONES FILMS' since 2013, with Paramount Pictures - the film studio - retaining 'THE DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS' to the 'FIRST FOUR MOVIES' and will also be receiving 'FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION FROM ANY ADDITIONAL FILMS'.\n\nMangold then explains that in preparation to direct this is that the transition from the pulpy cinematic language of movies set during the 1940's brings the characters from an 'OLDER WORLD' into the modern 1960's, a present that essentially started, in the terms of technology, beginning with 'THE COLD WAR','NUCLEAR POWER', 'INTRIGUE' and also a 'BLACK AND WHITE MORALITY' and also describing the character of Indiana Jones as 'A HERO WHO IS USED TO A BLACK AND WHITE WORLD' and that when it comes to villains, who now finds himself living in a 'gray' world and also with a lack of 'CLEAR GOOD GUYS AND BAD GUYS' while at the same time Jones grows distrustful of his beloved country, and also the land of his birth, who's also out of touch as well as out of time in an era in which idealism has simply vanished into thin air.\n\nMangold then continues that's Jones' age in the film where he's 'seventy-years of age' - but in real life that he turns 'eighty-one years of age' in July 2023 -, and that the reason that he took on this challenge isn't because that Mangold is not only a director for hire - he also directed 'LOGAN' -back in 2017, for this was 'THE TENTH FILM IN THE FRANCHISE' and featuring actor Hugh Jackman - that began with 'X-MEN' in 2000 - and also featuring 'two famous SIR'S' - notably Sir Patrick Stewart as PROFESSOR X and also Sir Ian McKellen as MAGNETO - this became a franchise in its own right.\n\nPlus McKellen was also featured in two film franchises in 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' - from 2001-2003 and also 'THE HOBBIT' - from 2012-2004 - each of these was split into 'three epic 'RING-PIECES' each - notably ‘The Fellowship Of The Ring’, ‘The Two Towers’, and also ‘The Return Of The King’ plus 'An Unexpected Journey', 'The Desolation of Smaug' and 'The Battle Of The Five Armies' and was also written by JRR TOLKIEN which interestingly featured Rhys-Davies star of the 'Indiana Jones Franchise' as Sallah Mohammed Faisal el -Kahir in which he also appears in the 5th instalment of the franchise but also as Gimli in the LORD OF THE RINGS franchise and also added an additional role as the voice of ‘Treebeard’ that was featured in ‘The Two Towers’ plus the fact that Mangold also happens to love 'THE INDIANA JONES FRANCHISE' very much and that's why he wanted to get involved in the first place as a film director.\n\nThis 'as you know' became an American 'media franchise' and based on the adventures of Dr. Henry Walton 'Indiana' Jones, Jnr, a 'fictional professor of archaeology' and also featuring Ford in the title role and 'movie audiences' were introduced back in 1981 in 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark',- set in 1936, beginning in the jungles of South America and featuring Paul Freeman,John Rhys-Davies, Denholm Elliott, Ronald Lacey and Karen Allen, - as Marion Ravenwood - Indy's original girlfriend first introduced in 'RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK' and by 2008 'reprised her role' in 'INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL' - who at the end of the film - 'SPOILER ALERT' - becomes his wife.\n\nThen by 1984, Indiana Jones was back for the second time in 'Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom'-set in 1935, - this was not only 'a sequel' but also 'a prequel' as well - this featured Kate Capshaw 'aka Mrs Spielberg' and Ke Huy Quan - now an Oscar-Winning Best Supporting Winning Actor for 'Everything Everywhere All At Once' also featuring Oscar Winners Michelle Yeoh - a Best Actress Oscar Winner and Jamie Lee Curtis - a Best Supporting Oscar Winner as well.\n\nThis was then followed in 1989, when 'Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade' -set in 1938,- 'a sequel to the 1984 film and featured Sir Sean Connery as Henry Jones Jr - his dad, also featuring Julian Glover and Alison Doody - this was the third time that Ford himself put on that hat wearing a ‘battered brown jacket’ and using his ‘man-bag’ - -just to put his ‘DELICATE ITEMS’ - ‘CALM DOWN NOW’ - inside his man-bag .\n\nBy 1992, 'eleven years after the release of the 'FIRST THREE ORIGINAL FILMS OF THE TRILOGY' - the franchise 'EXPANDED' with 'THE YOUNG INDIANA JONES CHRONICLES' - which became a 'TV SERIES' and featured Sean Patrick Flannery and Corey Carter as 'THE TITLE CHARACTER' - portraying his 'CHILDHOOD AND ALSO HIS YOUTH' and also included 'HIS ADVENTURES WITH HIS PARENTS' - plus George Hall playing 'AN ELDERLY VERSION OF JONES' - for the 'BOOKENDS OF MOST EPISODES' - though Ford himself as Indiana Jones - 'BOOKENDED ONE EPISODE'.\n\nBut as with the film versions which Lucas himself produced - as well as he also CREATED and also EXECUTIVE PRODUCED THE EPISODES in question - which at the time were 'TWO SEASONS' - consisting of 'TWENTY-EIGHT EPISODES which also included 'FOUR TV MOVIES' THAT WERE SHOT AND ALSO SHOWN ON TV.\n\nHowever, by 1993, the show was 'SUBSEQUENTLY CANCELLED DUE TO ITS 'LARGE BUDGET' and also its 'LOW BUDGET RATINGS'.\n\nThen in 1999, 'THE SERIES ITSELF WAS RE-EDITED INTO 'TWENTY-TWO TV FILMS' - under the title of - 'THE ADVENTURES OF YOUNG INDIANA JONES'.\n\nBut then in 2008, - 'Nineteen years later, - Indy 'was back' - the fourth time in 'Indiana Jones And the Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull'- set in 1957 - and featuring Shia LeBeouf, Cate Blanchett, Karen Allen, Ray Winstone, Jim Broadbent, and also Sir John Hurt, - again - and who was also the star of 'The Elephant Man'- 1980 - as John 'Joseph' Merrick, a severely-deformed man whose face and body was deformed because of a serious illness and is set in late 19th-century London.\n\nHurt who portrayed the part of John Merrick had to arrive on the 'film set' at around 05:00 am - just to get into the costume - which took around 'seven to eight hours - just to apply - and that applying the effects was laborius, but once Hurt was ready the crew would then 'shoot the movie' -in glorious black and white - courtesy of Freddie Francis - a British Cinematographer and also Christopher Tucker - a Make-Up Artist Whose Original Make-Up consisting on casts that were based on Merrick's real body - between 12:00 Mid-day - 22:00 - (10pm) - lasting at least 'ten hours' but also that the actor worked 'alternate days' - due to the strain of the make-up and which took only about 'two hours' to remove.\n\nThe film, directed by David Lynch and also featured Sir Anthony Hopkins as Dr Frederick Treves, a Victorian British surgeon who takes Merrick from the freak show then examines him with extremely under care and attention before inviting him to work at the hospital where he stays.\n\nAlso the actor Frederick William Treves, BEM - that's a British Empire Medal who appears in the film as an ALDERMAN - that's a Hospital Adminstrator to you - and who also happens to be 'the great uncle’ of the doctor in real-life.\n\nTreves was actually from a “medical family”; - as his father was in fact a physician and also Frederick Treves was in fact the surgeon who became famous for discovering Joseph “John” Merrick known as ‘The Elephant Man’ - but also the actor Freddie Jones portrays Mr Bytes - the evil ringmaster and who is described as a brutal man who also views John as an ‘intellectually disabled person’ - because Merrick’s head is kept ‘hooded’ as he is ‘beaten-up’ so badly, - his skull in question has become deformed is that if he lay down his head to go to sleep is that he would Asphyxia or even Asphyxiation - for this is a condition of deficiency supply of oxygen to the body which arises from abnormal breathing,- also just for the record Toby happens to be 'the son of the father of Freddie' - and also happens to appear in the fifth and final instalment part of the franchise series.\n\nNow it was back in 1923, ‘one hundred years ago’ that Sir Frederick Treves had published a volume entitled 'THE ELEPHANT MAN AND OTHER REMINISCENCES', in which he detailed what he knew of Merrick's life and their personal interactions, but also that this account is also the source of much about what is known Merrick himself, but their were also several inaccuracies in the actual book itself.\n\nInterestingly, Mel Brooks,(aka Melvin James Kaminsky - his real name) the star and director of 'BLAZING SADDLES'- 1974 - and whose production company BROOKSFILMS was in fact involved in the movie,'in the opening credits' - but Brooks himself wasn't actually involved, - this is because that to avoid movie audiences anticipating the movie being in the vein comedic works.\n\nHowever the actress Anne Bancroft - aka - Mrs Mel Brooks - they married in 1964, celebrating at least 'forty-one years' of marriage and she 'passed away' in 2005, and also the star of 'THE GRADUATE' -1967 - directed by Mike Nichols and also features an outstanding killer soundtrack by Paul Simon And Art Garfunkel plus an additional film score by Dave Grusin - and also whose character Mrs Robinson,(Bancroft), seduces a very young Dustin Hoffman as Benjamin Braddock and ends up falling for Elaine - her daughter (Katherine Ross) - after all this was his film debut on the biggest stage of his film career - appears in the film as Mrs Madge Kendall, a star of the theatre who befriends John Merrick.\n\nAlso, just for the record, actor Bradley Cooper, star of ‘The Hangover Trilogy' appeared in the American version performed on the Broadway stage as John Merrick, but also when Cooper watched the movie as a child it became an inspiration on his calling to become an actor, because he was so moved by what he saw on the big screen.\n\nNow an epic film of this franchise which normally lasts about over the two hour mark, but this franchise so far has either set its running time of either under two hours or over two hours - in the case of ‘Raiders Of The Lost Ark’ this is an amazing 1 Hr 55 Minutes (115 Mins), then ‘Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom’ came in at 1Hr 58 Minutes (118 Mins), after which came ‘Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade’ at just 2 Hrs 8 Minutes (128 Mins), and finally ‘Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull’ was set at 2 Hrs 2 Minutes (122 Mins), and now for the 5th and final instalment in the franchise series - they’ve saved the best till last - for this clocks in at an astonishing 2 Hrs 34 Minutes (154 Mins) - plus if you add up all the duration running times in the franchise- FEATURING ALL FIVE IN THE FRANCHISE ACTION FILM SERIES - back to back - this comes to an astonishing 'nine hours and fifty-seven minutes', 'that's about three minutes short of 'TEN HOURS'\n\nFor this is about the extreme length and also as long as 'LINFORD CHRISTIE'S LUNCHBOX' that's prepared with the greatest care and immediate attention by the likes of James Martin, Matt Tebbutt, 'Naughty' Nigella Lawson, Graham Kerr - aka 'THE GALLOPING GOURMET' also Dame Mary Berry and even Delia Smith - these are professional cooking experts who perform their skills in their kitchen and who even when performing live - it ain't because the shows are in fact pre-recorded - and you can tell this just by looking at their watches that are set at different times, but also that Part 5 in the film franchise has become 'THE MOST EXPENSIVE FILM' IN THE HISTORY OF LUCASFILMS.\n\nYes boys and girls because - the final part of this - is the longest movie 'and almost as long as the size of his 'BULL-WHIP' - in the franchise - ever made in the history of the movies, but just think of this as your own holiday adventure - YOUR GREATEST HITS by re-living all the highlights that you've ever wanted to visit in your entire life - just by being there and featuring the likes of Judith 'MISS PIGGY' Chalmers and even Mary ' TURKEY-NECK' Nightingale who's also sponsored by Bernard Matthews - that's 'SIMPLY BOOTIFUL' - in the years before she became an anchor-news journalist reading and hosting 'the one hour evening news broadcasts' live on TV and performing in front of millions on the 'goggle-box' as your travel guides - and what's more that you don't have to leave your establishments because you have the remote control on your sets in your possession - simply because you're in charge of what happens whilst you’re PULLING YOU’RE OWN PUD - 'LIVE' - IN YOUR OWN LOUNGE INSIDE YOUR ESTABLISHMENTS.\n\nSo far in the film series, we've seen our hero wearing the iconic fedora hat that he proudly wears plus his leather jacket and goes about searching on many adventures locating The Ark Of The Covenant in search of the sacred tablets containing The Ten Commandments, arriving in a Punjabi village whose children have been kidnapped from a psychotic madman, practising the art of child slavery and black magic, go in search of the Holy Grail with his father whilst being chased by German Officers and racing against time against the agents of the Soviet Union and on each of his 'death defying adventures' there's been the ingredients that involves plenty of action and suspense.\n\nHowever when the franchise began with ‘RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK’ - Indiana Jones has held a deep fear of snakes, - but now INDIANA - who was named after the dog - 'SPOILER ALERT' - AT THE END OF THE THIRD INSTALMENT OF THE FILM FRANCHISE - and also the pet which in turn is also an important member of the family unit - faces his toughest adventure yet in the fifth and final story of the franchise film series.\n\nFord himself has been 'A LEADING MAN' - of 'SEVERAL GENRES' - and is regarded by many as - 'AN AMERICAN CULTURAL ICON'.\n\nHis films in general have grossed more than $5.4 billion (£4,249,638,000.00 -UK) in North America - and also more than $9.3 billion (£7,984,003,500.00 -UK) world-wide - and therefore making him as - 'THE SEVENTH-HIGHEST GROSSING ACTOR' - in North America.\n\nFord's career as an actor has gone from strength to strength since his performances as Han Solo and Indiana Jones in the film series franchises and in 1985, he received his only Oscar nomination in the thriller 'WITNESS' directed by Australian film director Peter Weir, but since then he has appeared in many movies such as 'THE FUGITIVE' 1993, as Dr Richard Kimble with Tommy Lee Jones as Sam Gerrard - a federal agent - who ironically won Jones an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, 'THE DEVIL'S OWN' 1997, featuring Brad Pitt, also 'AIR FORCE ONE' 1997 - directed by Wolfgang Petersen and featuring Gary Oldman and 'COWBOYS AND INDIANS' - 2011 - 'described as a sci-fi western movie' - directed by Jon Faverau - and featuring Daniel Craig - star of the James Bond movies - to name a few.\n\nThe story as you expect opens in 1944, at the closing of WWII, with a 'DE-AGED' Indiana Jones, (Ford), reprising the role for the final time, and this time he's aided by Basil Shaw (Jones), an English academic who happens to be a diminutive, eccentric, but also a staunchly heroic by helping Indy stay alive and also Shaw himself who happens to be an ally and also the father of Helena Shaw (Waller-Bridge),who also happens to be the goddaughter of Indiana Jones.\n\nBut Indiana and Basil are on an adventure board a runaway train in which an opening epic fight sequence takes place as they attempt to retrieve 'THE LANCE OF LONGINUS' - this is the actual blade that 'PIERCED CHRIST’ from Jurgen Voller (Mikkelsen).\n\nNow you could call this as a 'RAIDERS OF THE LOST ART FORM' - which is like one that's buried underground like a time capsule that's to be unearthed to be re-examined by modern-day archaeologists and transferred to a museum.\n\nHowever, it was at that precise time when Ford who was in fact doing that 'EPIC SCENE' with Mikkelsen - that Ford himself had 'SUSTAINED A RIGHT SHOULDER INJURY' and which required that Ford himself - would take a 'HIATUS' - from filming while the treatment to his shoulder injury known as a 'SUBSCAPULARIS' - muscle is in fact as - 'EVALUATED', this led to production of the film that was shut down for two weeks, - and that when the production of the film resumed - it was that Ford himself had 'TO SIT OUT AN ADDITIONAL SIX WEEKS' - while he recovered from his injury.\n\nBut in fact that this isn't the first time that Ford has injured himself in the past when in 'TEMPLE OF DOOM' - had 'SUFFERED A BACK INJURY', this turned out that Ford had 'HERNIATED A DISC IN HIS BACK' which led to Ford being flown back to the US - to 'UNDERGO SURGERY and that Vic Armstrong - a film stuntman - was in fact filling in for Ford himself in many of the movie's action scenes, - while in 'STAR WARS : THE FORCE AWAKENS' - 2015 - Ford, himself - had 'ENDURED A LEG TRAUMA', to his injury problems in his career.\n\nAlso, one of the action set -pieces in 'DIAL OF DESTINY' finds Indy 'riding and also galloping like Frankie Dettori - a champion jockey -through the streets of New York City, during the 1969 'ticker-tape' parade - there are shades of Manchester City's home-coming parade by showing off 'the three trophies - notably 'THE PREMIER LEAGUE', 'THE FA CUP' and 'THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE' TO THE DIE-HARD FANS WHO ARE CELEBRATING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS CLUB AND WHO ARE STANDING THERE IN THE POURING RAIN - DROWNED LIKE RATS - to celebrate the moon-landing - which to me was quite impressive to watch.\n\nHowever, as he was finishing up filming the scene, Ford himself had in fact 'FELT THE HANDS OF THREE STUNTMEN' trying to spot him as he came down from the horse, then he expressed his displeasure from the experience stating 'WHAT JUST HAPPENED' - like I was being attacked by gropers and they - 'the stuntman' replied -'Well we were simply just worried about you' - to which Ford replied 'Leave me alone as I'm just an old man who’s just getting off the horse and I want it to look like that - for the record Ford celebrates his birthday - which he also shares with Mandy 'the munchkin' - and turns 81 years on July 13.\n\nFor the record,Longinus is in fact the name that was given to the 'UNNAMED ROMAN SOLDIER' - who in medieval times and some modern christian traditions is described by many as a convert to Christianity and his name first appeared in 'THE GOSPEL OF NICODEMUS'.\n\nNow, the Lance is known in Christianity as 'THE HOLY LANCE' and that the story is in fact related in 'THE GOSPEL OF JOHN' - this is in fact known as the FOURTH of FOUR CANONICAL GOSPELS - during the Crucifixion and also 'THAT THIS ACT' is said to have been created as 'THE FIVE HOLY WOUNDS OF CHRIST'.\n\nThis person who in fact is 'unnamed' in the Gospels is further identified in some versions of the legend as 'THE CENTURION THAT WAS PRESENT AT THE CRUCIFIXION - AND WHO ALSO SAID THAT CHRIST HIMSELF WAS 'THE SON OF GOD', and so he was considered as 'ONE OF THE FIRST CHRISTIANS AND ROMAN CONVERTS'.\n\nHowever in 1965, when 'THE GREATEST STORY EVER TOLD' produced and directed by George Stevens and featuring 'an all-star cast' with Max Von Sydow, as Jesus, Charlton Heston, as John The Baptist, Claude Rains, star of 'CASABLANCA' -1942, and 'LAWRENCE OF ARABIA' -1962, - as 'Herod The Great - this was his final film role - and John Wayne as 'The Centurion' - this is a 'retelling' of the biblical account about Jesus of Nazareth, chronicling from THE NATIVITY to THE ASCENSION - this is an 'EPIC FILM' - at just over 'four hours and twenty minutes' - that's about 260 minutes in duration total of the movie.\n\nApparently Wayne's role as 'THE CENTURION' - was in fact known as - 'A CAMEO ROLE THAT WAS COMPLETE WITH NO DIALOGUE' - and that he was paid about $250,000.00 (£199,497.50 -UK) - for his performance in the religious epic movie directed by Stevens but other film directors such as Sir David Lean would contribute to direct as a 'SECOND UNIT' in which Lean himself would direct only two sequences - which he accepted - and would concentrate on 'THE NATIVITY SCENES' - in the movie.\n\nWay back in 1963 - 'two years earlier' when Wayne himself had completed 'McCLINTOCK' - a comedy western - which is 'loosely based' on 'The Taming Of The Shrew' by William Shakespeare, directed by Andrew Victor McLaglen and also the son of the Irish actor Victor McLaglen who featured with John Wayne - aka Marion Robert Morrison - his real name and aka 'The Duke' - which as it happens turned out to be his dog.\n\nNow between John Wayne and Victor McLaglen - they appeared in at least 'SEVEN MOVIES' - and all directed by John Ford, and as Wayne playing a Roman Centurion who ushers Christ into carrying his Wooden Cross into Calvary, his impact on the intense scene which left him more of a disciple than a leader and which the appearance left 'like a bad taste in Wayne's mouth and decided that this needed to provide many changes to his role as a Roman Centurion in the film.\n\nAnyway when Longinus' legend grew over the years to the point that he was said to have 'CONVERTED TO CHRISTIANITY' after the Crucifixion, and that he is traditionally venerated as a 'SAINT' in the ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH, EASTERN ORTHODOX CHURCH and also several other Christian communities.\n\nThe film then switches to 1969, - twenty-five years later - which happens to be the era of 'THE BEATLES' featuring John,Paul,George and Ringo, - the track of 'MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR is playing in the background because the neighbours next door are hippies who are 'spiced up' because they're on drugs - and Indy's not a happy chappie - but also it's more like 'THE ROLLING STONES - featuring Jagger and the boys performing 'Sympathy From The Devil' - a sample that's used in the movie's soundtrack -and also the back-drop of the 'SPACE-RACE - as Jones by now, is 'seventy-years old' and is still an American Archaeologist and also an Adventurer, for he now lives alone after his marriage to Marion Ravenwood (Allen) hit the rocks - just because they're separated in a 'run-down-infested apartment' in New York - (aka - Glasgow City Centre - that's situated in Scotland - and also 'ON LOCATION' - ie: standing in for New York City) - and is on the verge of RETIREMENT and from where he teaches his student in a University, and where half of them attending classes are asleep during lectures.\n\nHowever his age has soon caught up with him - as well as the milage - and also that in the latest instalment is that 'HE'S EVEN MORE CROTCHETY' than he was in the previous adventure instalments - but there are more references to his extreme aches and pains - including his -'CRUMBLING VERTEBRAE'- and also his diminishing stamina -plus at one stage is that he's also referred to as 'AN ANCIENT GRAVE ROBBER'.\n\nNow, Jones, has started to begin to feel his doubts when the US Government had in fact recruited former WWII enemies in their desperation to beat the Soviet Union out in the competition and also to make into Space and also Helena - his goddaughter who also attends one of his lectures then accompanies him on his epic journey and also joins him on his 'QUEST' - by searching desperately and also looking out for the legendary 'DIAL OF DESTINY'.\n\nJones, himself also happens to drink a bit too much in this one and his character who drinks a lot also resembles a certain Humphrey Bogart - the star of 'THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE' -1948 as Dobbs - written and directed by John Huston, based on the novel by B.Traven and also featuring Walter Huston - the father of John - with Tim Holt and Bruce Bennett - but at the same time is that he regrets about pursuing fortune and glory and also leaves his loved ones behind as he embarks on a new chapter and also a fresh start in his entire life.\n\nNow, Indy himself would have thrown his 'LEGENDARY FEDORA HAT' and also his 'BULL-WHIP' into his prized-possession of his - 'MAN-BAG' - and also jumped across on that 'RED-DOT' - across the world, - but at the same time is that he doesn't want to get involved and that he's no longer the young adventurer that we all once knew and also loved at this time - but also that INDY finds himself forced at a cross-roads in his life - plus a friend such as Helena - his goddaughter- has to pack all his belongings for him.\n\nNow you could say that Indy is like Phileas Fogg and that Helena is like Passepartout - both these characters were featured in 'AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS'- 'LA TOUR du MONDE en QUATRE-VINGTS JOURTS' - 'FRENCH' - written by Jules Verne - a French writer - and was also classed as - 'an adventure story' - now the book itself was published in its original language back in 1872 - one-hundred and fifty one - years ago, and also that this remains one of Verne’s most acclaimed works.\n\nFor the record there are two movie versions the 1956 version featuring Sir David Niven as Fogg, Cantinflas (aka Mario Fortino Alfonso Moreno Reyes - his real name -as Passepartout ), Robert Newton and Shirley MacClaine, followed by the 2004 version featuring Steve Coogan as Fogg, Jackie Chan as Passepartout, Cecile de France and Jim Broadbent and then in 1989, Sir Michael Palin was featured as Fogg - the part of Passepartout was portrayed by the TV crew accompanied by Palin himself in the TV series originally shown on BBC TV as a ’seven-part travel series’ then in 2021,- a new version of the story was shown on BBC TV - consisting of ‘eight episodes' - this featured David Tennant as Fogg and Ibrahim Koma as Passepartout - and also that in 2014, - I saw a stage version of this at the Royal Exchange,Manchester - this was a performance by a Northern Theatre Company - orignated in Newcastle Upon-Tyne and performed in a GEORDIE ACCENT ! - and in the words of Alan Shearer - a Newcastle United footballing legend - WHY AYE MAN !.\n\nThe story begins in London where Phileas Fogg, a wealthy English gentleman and Passepartout, - his newly employed French valet - attempt to circumnavigate the world in eighty days on a wager consisting of £20,000 (in 2019 - this is equivalent to £1.9million) set by his friends at the Reform Club, situated in the City of Central London - at Pall Mall.\n\nFor the record this is actually a private members club - specifically for the discerning gentleman and also as with all of the Gentleman's clubs that this itself had an all-male membership for decades - but also had to 'change its rules' by allowing the admission of many women to join these exclusive clubs on equal terms as far back as 1981.\n\nBut Helena is not only the goddaughter of Indiana Jones, because she has not only set out her own agendas in her life for she herself has also turns out to be a 'mercenary' and also 'a con-artist' as well, - by making a 'dodgy living in her entire life' - and simply flogging many antiquities on the 'black market' with Teddy, (Ethann Isidore).\n\nFor this unusual partnership is like the adventures of 'a modern-day version' of Oliver Twist and featuring two stars who have until now have fallen on hard times - notably Phillip 'Pip' Schofield - once the ''golden-arse-extremely-well-overpaid-whipping-rent-boy'' (you try saying that after 'a couple of sweet sherries' - courtesy of Granny Ridgeway - who after overdosing about five glasses of the stuff - unlike Shredded Wheat - other cereal packs are also available - simply falls down - and also dreams about Jane McDonald - a singer from Barnsley - who can send anyone to sleep because of her irritating voice - and which also resembles - a strangled black cat - with more than just nine lives) of ITV - and who's living now on 'HARD TIMES' is now living the dream - in his unique way - with Gordon The Gopher - (as entertainer Brian Conley would say that 'IT'S A PUPPET' !) - and was also situated in a bed-sit that originally belonged to Fred West - a well-known serial killer - not the breakfast version - after 'COMING OUT OF THE ORIGINAL CLOSET AND GOING BACK INSIDE THE BROOM CUPBOARD'.\n\nFor its just like conjuring up a magic-trick that's performed by a guy called Gareth Hunt - a TV actor who's 'MAGICING HIS COFFEE BEANS WITH PAUL DANIELS - A MAGICIAN - AND WHO BETWEEN THEM WERE JUST ''WARMING IT UP'' ON MANY DARK COLD MORNINGS ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS FOR NESCAFE' -''NOW THAT'S TRAGIC'' - this is in fact a coffee TV commercial that's shown on TV - 'other coffee varieties are also available' - and all because of a fling that he had with a junior researcher - ''YOU PATHETIC SAD PERSON - JUST GET A LIFE'' ! - on a well-known daytime TV show - (as for Holly -Pip's former TV partner - who's had her 'PHIL' for many years and wants a change - well she was last seen lurking through the bushes in her establishment - probably looking for her 'prince charming' and found Warwick Davis - star of Tenable - probably to massage him with his EXCALIBUR - length isn't important -just the size) - and Gary Lineker, a former football player and one of the highest paid TV pundits on 'MATCH OF THE DAY' - a TV show produced by the BBC - plus he's a direct descendent of Colonel Sanders - the founder of KFC - Kentucky Fried Chicken - 'FINGER LICKIN CRETIN' and also whose 'boy-hood team' Leicester City featuring Jamie 'PARTY BOY' Vardy - a 'well-paid footballer in crisp packets of Walker's' - other makers of crisps are also available - have been 'RELEGATED FROM THE PREMIERSHIP' - aka 'THE PROMISED LAND' and are now in 'THE CHAMPIONSHIP' - aka 'THE WILDERNESS OF A DARK FOREST'.\n\nBecause once you're in then its quite difficult to get out - where its so dark unlike Neil 'a sad old geezer' who supports Preston North End & its like being trapped inside the darkest tunnel with a HOBBIT and disguised as a MUNCHKIN - called Mandy - 'aka Tweety Pie' - ' a cartoon character who's about the size of - 'A MICROCHIP' - and who also enjoys staying in expensive hotels with a guy called Sir Elton Hercules John - aka Reginald Dwight - his real name -that she’s already met and also described him as a ‘TINY DANCER’ - and also goes searching inside mini-bars for her pleasures in life, - 'ARE YOU READY FOR LOVE' .\n\nHowever, ‘CAN YOU FEEL THE LOVE TONIGHT’ simply by -''TRAPPING OFF'' - with an iconic legend - watch out as his 'HEALING HANDS' will simply warm you up - on a cold morning by looking into her ‘BLUE EYES’ - believe me folks that 'I'M STILL STANDING', YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! - and just before he heads off to Glastonbury-' DON'T JUST LET THE SUN GO DOWN ON ME' ! - where he's the main-feature on 'Farewell Yellow Brick Road' - his final stop on his world tour -and also performs to many millions in the spotlight at the festival before his well-earned retirement, because at the end of the day Elton’s is after all - a global superstar - and after all - he was - ‘MADE IN ENGLAND’.\n\nNow, it's obvious that Helena herself has seen classic episodes of 'ONLY FOOLS AND HORSES' written by John Sullivan and featuring Sir David Jason as Derek 'DEL-BOY' Trotter and Nicholas Lyndhurst as Rodney Trotter - the younger brother of 'DEL-BOY' that's originally shown on BBC1 and gets repeated all the time on GOLD - a classic TV Channel - every weekend - Saturday and Sunday - religiously, but also interestingly she's all dressed-up smartly in shorts as well as a wearing a crispy-white shirt that's not only 'naughty but nice' but is also grown-up as a 'gorgeous heroine' who acts like 'a tempting tigress' - 'TAKE IT EASY BABE' - but she also reminds me of Shonagh - 'an old flame’ - and disguised as - Nigella - who leads a single life who was once lost and then was found left on the shelf simply because she was at a crossroads with her life and had fallen out with her best friend and also shops at a well known supermarket - other supermarkets are also available - and who's also trapped inside the body of Enid Blyton and is desperately trying to follow her own shadow out of the sunshine and into a forest escaping into a world where adventures await for a woman who craves many passions in life.\n\nHowever if you go down in the woods today - you'll be more than a bit surprised - and enjoying a well-deserved picnic 'sealing the bargain of a lifetime' - with a loved one and enjoying more than life's pleasures, whilst tracking down a former children's entertainer /TV star/sex offender called Rolf Harris who harmed 'TWO LITTLE BOYS' -(not those guys from the marketing section - known as Adam and Ed - aka 'the vitamin boys' - 'A & E - but those chaps from the resale section - those useless dipsticks who resemble the characters of Lloyd and Harry portrayed by Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels who starred in the 'DUMB & DUMBER movies) - for messing about with their 'DIDGERI-DOO'S' whilst on the other side of the woods - and not just because they broke his 'STYLOPHONE'.\n\nNow this was originally invented by Brian Jarvis in 1967, and is described as an analog miniature electronic musical keyboard played with a stylus - these were classed as toys specially made for children but they were also occasionally used by professional musicians such as John Lennon, David Bowie and Kraftwerk, however Harris was himself served as the spokesman for several years advertising the product and selling at least 'three million' Stylophones in the process.\n\nIn March 2013, Harris was one of twelve people involved in 'OPERATION YEWTREE' - this was in fact a British police investigations into sexual abuse allegations involving the abuse of children and also against the British media of highest profiles of famous personalities such as Jimmy Saville, who had his own show - 'JIM'LL FIX IT' - shown on BBC TV and who had also gained access to them mainly because in his time as a radio and TV personality - Saville had in fact 'ABUSED THEM AS YOUNG TEENAGERS' and many others also included in his circle include the likes of Stuart Hall, Fred Talbot, Gary Glitter ( aka Paul Gadd - his real name), Neil Fox - as well as Ray Teret - a former DJ working on Manchester Piccadilly Radio 261 - situated in Manchester City Centre - and originally located inside Piccadilly Plaza, Manchester, - and who was also in fact Saville's chauffeur - aka 'his driver' - were in fact located in the spotlight of fame itself.\n\nHarris, for his crimes was jailed on July 4th, 2014, for a total of five years and nine months - his crime was charged - including sexual offences dating as far back to the 1980's.\n\nAlso after his 'CONVICTION' - Harris who was awarded an MBE, an OBE and a CBE as well as an AM - A MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF AUSTRALIA - and also an AO - OFFICER OF THE ORDER OF AUSTRALIA - but his British awards were REVOKED in March 2015, and his Australian awards were also RECINDERED in February 2015.\n\nThen in 2017, Harris was released from prison but never 'APOLOGISED TO HIS VICTIMS', and spent most of his natural life away from the limelight.\n\nUnfortunately on May 10, 2023, Harris died at his home of cancer of the neck aged 93, - but his death was publicly announced 'TO THE WORLD' on May 23, 2023, - this is to allow for a dignified funeral for all concerned.\n\nAlso, just for the record, this is 'ONE FOR THE OLD BARGAIN BUCKET LIST' - specially created - if one is 'TOPPING UP THEIR TAN IN THE MID-DAY SUN' - whilst reciting a verse of 'MAD DOGS AND ENGLISHMAN' - that's performed by none other than Noel Coward, an English playwright, composer, singer and actor who appeared in 'THE ITALIAN JOB' - the original 1969 classic movie as Mr Bridger and also featured Sir Michael Caine as Charlie Croker and also enjoying a chilled glass of cool-refreshing CHIANTI and served by none other than Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecktor - your ever-friendly valet, who's living 'RENT-FREE' at 'DOWNTON ABBEY' and does a bit of 'cross-dressing' - as the Dowager Countess - 'on the side'.\n\nMeanwhile, Voller, - a NASA - National Aeronautics And Space Administration - member and also an EX-NAZI, who dresses up in a uniform that includes shades of the disgraced former Prince Harry who also dressed up in a Nazi uniform years before he 'pleasured himself' many years and decades later with Meghan Markle, a former actress - and is also involved with the 'MOON-LANDING PROGRAM' wishes to make the world into a better place as he sees it, but Voller at the same time has also conned 'THE US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT' - which is truly represented by Agent Mason, (Shaunette Renee Wilson).\n\nHowever, Voller also notices that he has make some important mistakes in his past-life and would also like to 'correct the missing pieces in a 'jigsaw' and also pits himself against Indy - as he wishes to retrieve the - 'MISSING ARTIFACT' - simply by 'JOINING THE TWO HALVES OF THE DIAL' - which happens to be one of Gerald Ratner's original products - a British businessman, and who was once a Chief Executive Officer - aka - a CEO - of Ratner's - a major British company which specialised in Jewellery - and described by many - as simply 'CRAP' - time-pieces in question as well, however, if the 'two halves of the dial are found together then its original owner of the dial in question will be able to leap back into time.\n\nVoller is in fact a descendant of one Jurgen Klopp - the manager of Liverpool FC - that's known to many as 'THE BIN-DIPPERS' - situated in the red half of the city that the Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen - the star of the TV SERIES called 'HANNIBAL' which is based on the novels by Thomas Harris - notably 'RED DRAGON', 'HANNIBAL' and also 'HANNIBAL RISING' - this is an American Psychological Horror Thriller TV Series developed by Bryan Fuller - an American TV writer and producer for NBC (National-Broadcasting Company - the flagship property of NBC UNIVERSAL - A SUBSIDIARY OF COMCAST) - and focuses on the relationship between Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) and Mikkelsen as Hannibal Lecter - the TV series also stars Gillian Anderson as Lecter's psychiatrist and also Fishburne as Jack Crawford - who portrays Voller is having such a fabulous time portraying the character is not only the best thing since the legendary Alan Rickman who portrayed the part of The Sheriff Of Nottingham in 'ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES' - (the 1991 version) featuring the likes of Kevin Costner, as Robin Hood, Morgan Freeman, as Azeem, Christian Slater as Will Scarlett and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Maid Marian - not only camps it up but brings the magic of the film to life every time.\n\nHis unique character also resembles Klopp who dances along the touchline in a celebration Premier League football match that in the nursery rhyme where Little Jack Horner (aka a certain Jack Grealish - a Manchester City player) and who's sat in his corner and having some interesting nosh (however its not even nosh -its something far more important than that) and also seals the bargain of a lifetime - by sealing the deal - but when Horner pulls out his thumb and revealing his 'plums' Klopp does something magical in the celebration - by simply 'pulling his hamstring' - which he himself 'got booked by the football referee in charge' and which can be very painful - and also finding out in the process that the team in question has failed to 'QUALIFY IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE' but sadly are in 'THE EUROPA LEAGUE' instead - so you could say that the ''SOFT LAD'' - aka - Mr Klopp - in question turns out to be a '''RIGHT PLONKER''’ instead.\n\nBut somehow there will be strange-things in the Anfield Stadium around the city of Liverpool come many Thursday evenings when many crowds in and around the stadium will shout the following words: 'THURSDAY NIGHTS TNT SPORTS' - formerly BT Sports - 'that's 'DYNAMITE' - ' if you ask me' - and at a certain time and day that they'll have get used to.\n\nBut there's one other thing that supporters of both Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur who have had one hell of a terrible season - and also one that they would rather forget what with sacking football mangers such as Graham Potter,- who was sacked followed by 'Super' Frankie Lampard - temporary and finally Maurizio Pochettino - the new coach - Chelsea plus Antonio Conte, - who was sacked, followed by Ryan Mason - temporary and finally Ange Postecoglou - the new coach - Tottenham Hotspur and that is this - both of these won't be competing in tournaments next season of 2023-24.\n\nAnd so when the likes of Manchester United,Manchester City, Newcastle United,Arsenal,Brighton And Hove Albion, Aston Villa and even West Ham United who also won the Europa League Conference Cup play on the biggest stages in football - the likes of Harry Kane and even James Maddison will be in their P’J’s, and tucked up in bed with a cup of cocoa watching the many highlights of these on TV - whilst also pulling more than their hamstrings in the process.\n\nMind you though, Klopp can take a hint from one Joseph Biden, aged 80 yrs old and who's not only an American politician - he also happens to be 'THE FORTY-SIXTH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA', and when he attended a graduation at an Air Force Academy in Colorado, that 'he simply tripped and fallen over flat on his face - for this was no publicity stunt - this was 'REAL' and also 'LIVE' for the world that was watching before their very eyes - as it turned out some big bags of sand - sponsored by a builders merchants - also other bags of sand supplied by business merchants are also available - were accidentally left on the stage itself - and Biden - simply -'fell for it' - like a 'useless dipstick'.\n\nHere's an interesting fact that according to 'THE TIMES' - a British newspaper that the man who provided the inspiration for Hannibal Lector, known by many as 'THE ORIGINAL CANNIBAL SERIAL KILLER' from author Thomas Harris from the best-selling novels consisting of 'THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS' and 'RED DRAGON' - was in fact 'BASED ON A GAY MEXICAN DOCTOR' named Alfredo Balli Trevino, who ended his days by simply 'treating the poor' and desperately trying to forget 'his dark past'.\n\nBack in the 1960's, that Harris had been a journalist working for 'ARGOSY' - 'an American 'pulp' magazine' published between 1882 -1978 - lasting ninety-six years - and during his time visiting a prison in Mexico.\n\nNow while Harris was there at the prison it was at this time that he had to meet Dykes Askew Simmons, a small time Texas criminal and also worked as a crane operator and who back in 1959, it was at that time that Dykes happen to be taking a vacation.\n\nHowever his plans were abruptly changed when three young Mexicans were subsequently murdered by a lone man not far from where he crossed the border, however one of the victims did not die immediately and that she identified Simmons as her 'ASSAILANT', but though 'the dying girl' had identified 'a variety of persons - which also included her doctor as her killer - it was that Simmons was 'CONVICTED' and also 'SENTENCED TO DEATH' - but he was also that he was 'THE FIRST AMERICAN EVER TO BE CONDEMNED IN A MEXICAN PRISON'.\n\nAnyway, treating Simmons was a doctor named SALAZAR, and whom Harris 'mistook him' to be a staff member.\n\nNow while Dr Salazar treated Simmons who by now was a mental patient at the prison, the journalist and the doctor had quite 'AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEM CONCERNING SIMMONS' VICTIMS.\n\nHowever, little did Harris know that 'THE DOCTOR WAS A MURDERER' himself and who was 'SENTENCED' to TWENTY YEARS of imprisonment, but also that this was in fact 'THE MAN WHO BECAME THE INSPIRATION FOR HANNIBAL 'THE CANNIBAL' LECTOR' - Harris' horror icon, which by the way was originally featured in 'THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS' - the film version was released in movie theaters first in the US on February 14, 1991 - St Valentine's Day, and then - 'four months later' in the UK in June 1991,- that same year and you may want to know that about the real story that's also based on 'THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS' contains many stories such as Gary Heidnik, who was 'A SERIAL KILLER' and whose crimes would become the inspiration for the 'BUFFALO BILL' character.\n\nNow, Heidnik, in 1986, started his 'REIGN OF TERROR' and 'KIDNAPPED', 'RAPED' and even 'TORTURED' at least 'SIX WOMEN' simply by keeping them 'PRISONER' - in the 'BASEMENT' of his Philadelphia home, but also that 'THE FILM' - would feature Jame Gumb - this is classed as - 'A FICTIONAL MURDERER - portrayed by Ted Levine - and who would 'INFLUENCED THE 'BUFFALO BILL' CHARACTER'.\n\nIt soon turns out that when Trevino was in prison it was that he was known as 'DR SALAZAR', however to the outside world, Trevino was more familiar as 'THE WOLFMAN OF NUEVO LEON' and that this doctor from Monterrey was sentenced to death for murdering Jesus Castillo Rangel - 'HIS GAY LOVER' - and also mutilating his body, the physician killed his lover in a fit of anger - as the former was in fact 'MARRIED' - to a woman.\n\nSo Trevino had spent his life in 'THE NUEVO LEON STATE PRISON' for at least 'TWENTY YEARS' - and was finally released in 1980, but once 'HE WAS OUT' - it was that he continued his medical practise as a Doctor.\n\nSadly, in 2001, Trevino 'passed away' at the age of 81 years from cancer.\n\nMeanwhile, the year is 1969, the date is July 20, where the season of Summer is in full-swing - and as Bob Dylan - aka Robert Allen Zimmerman - his real name - once said that - 'THE TIMES THEY ARE A CHANGIN' - also that this is a protest against the Vietnam War - and which also becomes 'A PLOT DEVICE' - plus many are taking a 'well-earned' vacation and also when millions of people that are gathered around their TV sets to witness a 'ONCE IN A LIFETIME LIVE SPECIAL EVENT' by watching Neil Armstrong and Edwin 'Buzz' Aldrin - 'two US astronauts' do something that 'NO-ONE HAD EVER DONE BEFORE' - by wearing 'bulky-spacesuits' and also 'back-packs of oxygen to breathe'.\n\nThey also spent around 'three hours' on 'THE MOON' at least - and also 'DID EXPERIMENTS' as well.\n\nNow for these 'TWO MEN' who also became the 'FIRST' to 'WALK ON THE MOON' - while Michael Collins - 'the forgotten third crew-mate' continues to 'ORBIT THE MOON' aboard the 'APOLLO 11'.\n\nAs for the question about 'THE DIAL OF DESTINY' itself and also behind the history of its origins remains a mystery - but essentially i believe that this could be based on a dial - say a 'lost time-piece,' that was hidden underground for many centuries of the histories of our time - and that this iconic item would feature a unique series of parts and also of what would look like some artefactural interlocking mechanical shapes that are engraved with the distinguishing lines and markings that seem to be a representative of constellations with the galaxies in the deepest, darkest, vastness of an invisible abyss in space exploration.\n\nThe most interesting thing about a significantly and a historically thing about sundials is that the most likely candidate of an inspiration is in fact the fabled Greek that's simply known as - 'ANTIKYTHERA MECHANISM'. - which by the way, Antikythera is is fact a Greek Island, that's situated in the North-West part of the Aegean Sea between Crete and the Pelopennese.\n\nThis is in fact, a lesser-known Island spanning just 'twenty-square kilometres' - about 'eight square miles' and is also has 'a supporting population' that hovers around at least fifty.\n\nThis outstanding piece of Greek machinery which is made entirely of a lump of 'corroded bronze' is in fact 'a two-thousand year-old' device since it was originally found in 'the year of our lord' 1901, on a Roman-Era shipwreck in Greece, and is often referred to as 'THE WORLD'S OLDEST COMPUTER' - but has also been 'RE-CREATED' by scientists who are trying to 'FIGURE OUT' and also to understand 'HOW IT ORIGINALLY WORKED' - for the very first time.\n\nThis was also classed as a mechanical computer of bronze gears and was used as a 'ground-breaking piece of technology' to make 'ASTRONOMICAL PREDICTIONS' and also by 'MECHANIZING ASTRONOMICAL CYCLES' and also 'THEORIES'.\n\nBut, 'according to scientists', the Antikythera device origin location to Syracuse, an ancient City situated on the Italian Island of Sicily and their conclusion was that at the time that Archimedes, who was not only a Greek Mathematician, but also a physicist, engineer, an astronomer and also an inventor, for this was a man who not only had many talents, but also had his hands full - 'COULD HAVE CREATED IT'.\n\nThe issue of 'AGEING’ and also 'DE-AGEING' on the 'silver screen' has always been a challenge for many film directors because 'THE ART OF FILMMAKING' is about creating and also bringing your stories to life, - and when your story takes over a long period of time, beginning from the day of our birth when we arrive on Earth right the way through to 'old-age', then the biggest challenges is how to show what really happens in a realistic way.\n\nHowever, in the history of the motion pictures, whether for film/cinema, television or even streaming services,THE ART OF DE-AGEING is in fact A VISUAL EFFECTS technique that's used to make either an actor/actress in the business of the film industry look younger, especially for FLASHBACK scenes, and this is often accomplished via DIGITALLY EDITING THE IMAGE or even using COMPUTER-GENERATED IMAGERY (aka CGI) using overlays or even touch-ups.\n\nAlso, this will consist of a WWII FLASHBACK of our hero who is not only ‘fighting for his beloved country’ - by simply fighting the Nazis back in 1944, and also for which Ford himself was in fact ‘DE-AGED’ back to how he originally looked during ‘the release period’ of ‘the first three’ INDIANA JONES movies and also to which in order to ‘RECAPTURE THE FEELING’ - that all of the original footage that were used was in fact all shot in the 1980’s - plus the first ‘twenty- five minutes of this final instalment’- is dedicated to the fact that we ‘AS WE - THE MOVIE AUDIENCE’ see our hero of INDY go through ’a simple transformation that’s simply known as ‘A DE-AGEING SEQUENCE’ of the much-loved character- right before our very eyes’, on the big screen.\n\nBack in 1970,- decades before DEAGEING came into fruition and simply became known as 'OLD SCHOOL' - movies such as 'LITTLE BIG MAN', -a WESTERN - from director Arthur Penn, and released in many movie theaters and also featuring Dustin Hoffman,- 'a future Oscar-Winner- and portraying Jack Crabb, as a 'one hundred and twenty one year old man' - and also a 'sole-survivor' of the BATTLE OF LITTLE BIG HORN, which took place back in June 1876.\n\nNow, his entire-face was covered with a '14-Piece Latex Mask, created by Dick Smith, - this process took at least 'five hours a day' to apply -and it is also classed as 'THE RECORD FOR THE GREATEST AGE SPAN THAT'S PORTRAYED BY A MOVIE ACTOR'.\n\nOther movies that used this process included Brad Pitt in ‘THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON’- 2008 - directed by David Fincher - and featuring - ‘an all-star cast consisting of Taraji P.Henson, Mahershala Ali, Julia Ormond, Jason Flemying, Elias Koteas and Tilda Swinton.\n\nFor this is ‘loosely’ based on the short story published in 1922, by F.Scott Fitzgerald, - yes the man who wrote ‘The Great Gatsby’ - now the film featured Pitt as Benjamin Button, a man ‘who ages in reverse’ and also featured Oscar -Winning actress Cate Blanchett as the love interest throughout his life.\n\nNow, originally Ray Stark, an American film producer bought the film rights to do the short story in the mid-1980’s, with Universal Pictures backing the film, but however struggled to get ‘the project off the ground’ until he sold ‘the rights’ to film producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall along with Cean Chaffin, a movie producer and also the husband of Fincher himself in the 1990’s, and although it was moved to Paramount Pictures also in the 1990’s, the movie did not enter production until after both Pitt and Fincher signed on the dotted line with the rest of the cast in 2005.\n\nThen in November 2006,Principal Photography began and was wrapped up by September 2007, also Digital Domain, this is an American visual effects and digital producer company based in Playa Vista, Los Angeles,California, worked on the visual effects on the film, particularly in the process of the metamorphosis of Pitt’s character.\n\nAnother movie that used this process of DE-AGEING in the movies, was ‘The Irishman’ - released in 2019, and also sub-titled on screen as ‘I Heard You Paint Houses’ written by Charles Brandt and also based on the non-fiction book originally published in 2004, this was in fact classed as ‘an American Gangster Epic Movie’ and directed by Martin Scorsese, an Oscar-Winning movie director and featured the likes of Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci who were the main three characters in this epic movie lasting about ‘nearly three and a half hours’.\n\nThe epic movie is set in the 1950’s, and follows Frank Sheeran (De Niro),a truck driver who gets involved with Russell Bufalino (Pesci),and his Pennsylvania crime family, but as Sheeran climbs up the ranks simply to become a top hit man, he also goes to work for Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino), a powerful Teamster President and also an American Labor 'union leader' tied to organised crime.\n\nNow of course many scenes involving the three characters were filmed with a custom three camera rig to help facilitate the custom and extensive DEAGEING digital effects that made the likes of De Niro, Pacino and Pesci appear younger throughout this epic movie which was supervised by Pablo Helman, a visual effects supervisor, but Helman and his team spent at least ‘two years’ analysing ‘old movies’ to determine how the three actors in question should look at the various ages when they appeared on the screen.\n\nAnd when the film itself was released on Netflix, a streaming service - this was after the film was given a limited release in movie theaters, however in the UK, the film was shown in Independent Cinemas, - instead of the main cinema chains which turned down the movie showing in these theaters because in order to upheld the ‘90-day window that was simply the standard practice across much of Europe.\n\nHere what follows is what the process of the art of 'DEAGEING' does as a prime example.\n\nJust imagine if the likes of Granny Ridgeway was preparing herself ready to go out on a ‘night on the town” with her chum-boozing 'middle-aged' buddies including Angela, Gloria and Julia - 'aka THE GERIATRICS'- and also the stars of 'RIP-OFF BRITAIN' - a 'consumer show' - and who like their sweet-sherries that's described by many as 'THEIR FAVOURITE TIPPLE' and also who are in fact 'SMARTLY-DRESSED UP' - and also with her unique style by putting on her face on some special cream like Oil Of Olay - other moisturisers are also available and realising with sheer horror- that it’s not ‘really’ the face cream that she really wanted - which in turn develops into a 'red-red-rash' that's darker than a bottle of tomato ketchup - on her face but a different kind of cream - notably salad cream courtesy of Heinz - other salad cream dressings are also available .\n\nBut then also one of her future suitors' - aka - David 'The Duke' Dickinson - the 'bronzed-tanned' star of Dickinson's Real Deal - whose 'FAKE TAN' - that he purchased actually came from the local pound shop - but he got the cash just to buy the 'so-called suncream' courtesy from the auctioneers - and also her dream Prince Charming says those immortal words like ‘Babe ! You look like a sweetest antique of a delectable dish that's located on my fitted kitchen tonight my love and not just because that I really want to tantalise my taste buds on you my scrumptious beauty' - then the end result would be hilarious - but you know the old saying - that this may be a great product - however it’s a crap taste.\n\nHowever in the words of Rubeus Hagrid portrayed by the legendary Scottish actor Robbie Coltrane and featured in the ‘Harry Potter’ movies consisting of eight movies which also became a cinematic franchise in its own right that - ‘ITS BETTER OUT THAN IN’ ! after consuming about 'FIVE CANS OF TENNANT'S EXTRA' - whilst doing an 'impression' of Andy Stewart - 'a Scottish Singer/Entertainer' in the bargain.\n\nBut just make sure that you keep it all in - rather than let it all hanging it out in the back garden and revealing your delicates on show and also in full view in front of 'the noisy neighbours', that is unless you happen to bump into Nicola Sturgeon - a former Scottish leader and has now taken up a new career disguised as ‘Wee Jimmy’ Krankie who’s all dressed up in her smart school uniform and also going along on her weekly ritual to a karaoke bar -‘on a school night’ as well - even though that she's 'UNDER-AGE'- and smooching down a couple of alcoholic beverages whilst singing along to tracks of Dirty Dancing - her favourite movie because ‘she not only having the time of her life’ - ''OH NO SHE ISN'T'' ! - '' OH YES SHE IS'' ! because she simply ‘BLADDERED’ by falling over and singing like 'a rough canary' - 'OCH AYE LADDIE' ! - and doesn’t remember being carried home to her ivory tower - ie: her award-winning prized possession of her establishment by none-other than King Charles III, whilst shouting out at the top of her voice that ‘WE’RE ALL DOOMED !’.\n\nNow of course this was made famous by John Laurie, the Scottish actor who appeared in ‘Dad’s Army’ - the TV series 'which became a British 'sit-com' about the United Kingdom's Home Guard during WWII and ran for 'nine seasons - about 'eighty episodes in total' plus a feature film featuring the original cast members originally released in 1971 and also a stage show and also a radio version of the show which was based on the original TV scripts as Private Fraser, which also featured Arthur Lowe, John Le Mesurier, Clive Dunn, Bill Pertwee, Arnold Ridley, James Beck and Ian Lavender.\n\nBy the time Sturgeon 'aka Wee Jimmy Krankie' arrived at her establishment - she was met by the police and was simply arrested all because in her previous job as First Minister of Scotland - there were rumours going around that she was in fact 'fiddling the accounts' at her discretion - so as she was being led away to be questioned about - the 'so called incident' instead of singing 'TAKE THE HIGH ROAD' - this was more a question of 'JAILHOUSE ROCK'.\n\nAs you'd expect 'INDIANA JONES AND THE DIAL OF DESTINY' - the final chapter of the 'PENTALOGY' franchise - this is described as 'AN ACTION MOVIE THAT'S SIMPLY OUT OF THIS WORLD' that's complete with all the added ingredients of 100% set-pieces loaded with car-chases and shoot-outs that you would expect today in a franchise series and in the annals of box office for the year of 2023 - this is exactly it.\n\nBut 2023 will be the year when franchises of films which not only include Indiana Jones, but also the likes of forth-coming 'EPIC' blockbusters such as 'Mission Impossible : Dead Reckoning Part One' from director Christopher McQuarrie and 'Oppenheimer' from director Christopher Nolan who 'let's face it' - that they are no strangers into competing with each other and also which of these will be the best of the crop of Summer 2023 releases and more importantly who will be - and in the words of Leonardo DiCaprio the star of 'TITANIC' directed by James Cameron as Jack Dawson -that 'I'M THE KING OF THE WORLD' come the end of the Summer season of 2023.\n\nJust think of this as a grudge match between Arsenal and Manchester City - for these are 'TWO PREMIERSHIP FOOTBALL TEAMS' IN THE ENGLISH PREMIERSHIP WHO HAVE THE FINEST MANAGERS LIKE PEP GUARDIOLA AND MIKEL ARTETA AND ARE FIGHTING IT OUT LIKE CATS AND DOGS, - for these two men once worked at Manchester City where PEP is the 'manager - aka 'THE KING' and MIKEL was 'the assistant' - aka 'THE EVER-WILLING ASSISTANT OF A YOUNG PRETENDER THAT'S WANTS THE THRONE TO HIMSELF AND REPLACE PEP! - BUT FAILED MISERABLY' - and that's before he left Manchester City to join Arsenal - just to become like 'THE KING'S OF THE BEAUTIFUL GAME' WHO AT THE TIME ARSENAL WERE CRUISING AT THE TOP OF THE PREMIERSHIP LEAGUE TABLE - THEN THEY SLIPPED UP - AND WHO LET MANCHESTER CITY IN TO CLIMB TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN AND ARE NOW CROWNED AS 'THE *1 PREMIERSHIP TEAM OF THE ENGLISH LEAGUE' FOR 'THE MAGNIFICENT SEVENTH' SEASON.\n\nFor the 'WINNERS' - their rewards of winning as 'CHAMPIONS' will be full of rewards that every football player dreams about - like dreams that are full of SUCCESS, FORTUNE AND GLORY - while for the 'RUNNER'S UP' - their reward of coming in 'SECOND PLACE' will be like tasting champagne that you purchased from 'a cheap supermarket' - say ALDI or even LIDL - that tastes 'BITTER'.\n\nBecause as Uncle Jim Bowen - the quiz-master of 'BULLSEYE' - a TV show based on 'the game of darts' who once said that 'THIS IS WHAT YOU COULD HAVE WON - AND YET YOU STILL LOST - YOU USELESS PRICK' ! - but although that you 'DID YOUR BEST' - it simply wasn't good enough to win 'THE TOP PRIZE' -because you simply took a 'GAMBLE' - and that you failed in your greatest achievements - to 'REACH OUT TO THE 'TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN' - because 'the view from the top is just breathtaking' and lost out to the greatest glories of being the richest team on the planet.\n\nYes boys and girls it seems that when it comes to winning many football trophies - then it's Manchester who's leading the way - by simply winning them from those Southern 'JESSIE'S' - already Manchester United won 'THE CARABAO CUP' and as for Manchester City - well they have already won 'THE PREMIER LEAGUE' - as well as the 'FA CUP' - where they beat - 'a certain Manchester team - from the red half of the City - I'M STILL BITTER BUT WHO CARES ! - its a team from Manchester that's in the 'FINAL' - and also 'WON THE MAIN PRIZE THAT THEY DESPERATELY WANT TO WIN' - for they are now ‘TOP BANANAS’ - because after all Manchester has a NATIONAL FOOTBALL MUSEUM - that's situated right in the central heart of Manchester City Centre from its original location in Preston - known to many as - the gateway to Blackpool - THE LAS VEGAS OF THE NORTH WEST OF ENGLAND.\n\nBecause at the end of the day that its not the taking part that counts - its just the the experience of being there and Manchester City are in Istanbul, Turkey, and competing in the UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE - aka 'THE HOLY GRAIL OF FOOTBALL' where they face Inter Milan competing for the most greatest prize - known to many as the UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE trophy.\n\nNow statistics say that MANCHESTER CITY are in fact - 'THE FAVOURITES TO WIN' - and that 'IF THEY WIN IT' - WHICH THEY DID - by beating INTER MILAN - in Istanbul - the result was 1-0 - THEY WILL IN FACT 'COMPLETE THE TREBLE' THAT MANCHESTER UNITED DID IN BACK IN 1999 - 24 YEARS AGO - ('' NOW THOSE WERE THE GLORY DAYS WHEN MANCHESTER CITY THEMSELVES WERE SCRAPING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL AND WERE ALSO IN THE FIRST DIVISION AKA 'THE THIRD TIER' BY PLAYING THE LIKES OF MACCLESFIELD TOWN, YORK CITY, BARNSLEY, IPSWICH TOWN,CHARLTON ATHLETIC AND GILLINGHAM - who they played at Wembley Stadium, London, - days after Manchester United won as ’THE FIRST-EVER TEAM IN MANCHESTER TO WIN ’THE DOMESTIC TREBLE' - THEY EVENTUALLY RETURNED TO THE TOP FLIGHT OF ENGLISH FOOTBALL -AKA - THE PREMIER LEAGUE IN 2004 - AFTER A FIVE YEAR BREAK '') - WITH THE PREMIER LEAGUE, THE FA CUP AND THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE - PLUS THE RED SKIES IN MANCHESTER THAT RISES IN THE MORNING HAS AUTOMATICALLY TURNED INTO A BLUE MOON THAT RISES INTO A GOLDEN SKY THAT SHINES OUT FOR ALL OF US.\n\nHowever, there’s an old saying that although that ‘THE WINNER TAKES IT ALL’ but ‘THE LOSER HAS TO FALL’ - it’s just one of those days in our lives that you have to accept in today’s society of an ever living world because life is such a game that you have to 'TAKE A CHANCE', ''TAKE A CHANCE' '‘'TAKE A CHANCE ON ME’'' with LADY LUCK - who's known as Leona - she's a hot 'ROCK CHICK' who's dressed in black and works as a full-time DJ at a top 'ABSOLUTE RADIO' station that's quite 'SIMPLY THE BEST' and who simply rocks out in her own way of life - by doing her job and also going the extra mile on her favourite motorcycle - known as a modern day Chopper motorcycle - that she rides on a clear day and in her own unique way and also searching for her best friend - known as 'THE STURGE' - however there are choices to be made in life, but think of this as 'THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE' - where both the tortoise and the hare are both involved in a unique race between each other and also a race against time to find out which of these becomes 'the ultimate winner'.\n\nThis final film in the franchise directed by Mangold, who's no stranger in the 'franchise film series' and who also happens to have the makings of a 'bitter-sweet' film-genre pic about a beloved 'pop-culture' iconic story of a professor - turned -archaeologist - turned teacher and who teaches many students that's entering into a new phase in a direction of a new chapter that's based upon the twilight of his years.\n\nAt the recent D23 Stage Event held in California, when the stars of 'Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny' featuring Ford and Waller-Bridge attended 'LIVE ON STAGE' - AND IN PERSON Ford himself was visibly emotional as he entered the main stage and said the following: - I'M DONE AND I WILL PERSONALLY NOT FALL DOWN FOR YOU AGAIN', but also when the film itself premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on Thursday May 18, 2023, at the 'GLITZY PALAIS SCREENING' shown at 'THE GRAND THEATRE LUMIERE - and which all the stars attended it was in fact Ford himself as INDY was also visibly moved by to tears himself as 'the centre of attention' by the reception itself, and where Ford himself accepted the 'HONORARY PALME D'OR AWARD' from Thierry Fremaux - THE FESTIVAL DIRECTOR - HIMSELF, however at the end of the screening the film itself was given 'A FIVE-MINUTE STANDING OVATION' from the crowds who attended the 'sell-out screening'.\n\nMany hours later after the premiere finished - the early reviews from many film critics and I'LL PERSONALLY GIVE YOU MY DEFINITIVE OFFICIAL VERSION - at the conclusion of this film review, however, the reviews of this were decidedly 'mixed', - for its like coming home from a fab night out from a major event - whatever it may be - and that's having 'too many sherbets' - which basically means that you get a 'hangover'.\n\nBut if you eat a 'balanced meal' such as 'A MIXED GRILL' which consists of the following like a grilled sausage, or even a piece of grilled steak, not forgetting grilled mushrooms, also grilled tomatoes and let's not forget chips/french fries and garden peas on the side - for these are essential items of everyday food that we consume on a regular basis consists of protein and vitamins that help build and strengthen our bones which not only keeps us going in our everyday lives it also soaks up all the alcohol like a sponge and gives us the energy that we need all the time.\n\nNaturally the small intestine that absorbs most digested food molecules, as well as water and minerals, and also passes them onto other parts of our bodies for storage or even further chemical charge.\n\n'DIAL OF DESTINY' is in fact classed as 'A SUPER-CHARGED DYNAMIC ADVENTURE MOVIE' that everyone deserves and also more importantly wants to see from 'AN INDIANA JONES MOVIE' - and though in this case 'THAT THIS ADVENTURE EPIC IN THE FINAL INSTALMENT -SIMPLY DELIVERS TO THE MOVIE AUDIENCES' world-wide and who have also followed his every move since the first one way back in 1981, which also includes 'the rousing familiarity powerful music score' that's created by Williams himself - and that every musical score that he creates turns into a 100% pure gold from a legendary genius of an outstanding film composer.\n\nBut this is also a movie that Mangold inherits the 'original concept features' from the likes of Spielberg - its original film director of the 'FIRST FOUR FEATURE LENGTH MOVIES OF THE FRANCHISE' - who should know either when to 'STEP IT UP A GEAR' or even 'RAISES THE BAR UP A NOTCH' -OR EVEN CRACKING THE BULL WHIP.\n\nHowever at the same time that many executives who work in the film industry - should realise that 'MOVIE FRANCHISES THAT CONSISTS OF ALL GENRES' can't be SEPARATED from the many creative visions and also the talents of these original creators who work in the industry who make these let movie audiences throughout the world go along to a movie theater and pay their hard earned cash in exchange for 'A GOLDEN MOVIE TICKET',- unless you happen to be Charlie Bucket, - the star of Charlie And The Chocolate Factory and written by Roald Dahl - a famous children's author - and featuring a youngster with plenty of dreams a plenty and by the time when you enter the auditorium in the theater you are transported into another world where dreams come true and adventures are real by enjoying the experience of seeing the finished product of a seeing a movie that has to be seen where it truly belongs on the big screen.\n\nThis final instalment of the film franchise has all 'the hallmarks' of qualities - used in all the series franchise including of 'SHARP-DIALOGUE', 'SUPERB CINEMATOGRAPHY'- courtesy of Phedon Papamichael - Douglas Slocombe - a British 'DOP' - shot 'the first original three films in the original trilogy' and Janusk Kaminski - a POLISH-BORN cinematographer was responsible for the 'fourth instalment' of the franchise - it was Kaminski who was also responsible for 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' - 1993 - his duties as a 'DOP' - 'DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY' earned him an Oscar - and plenty of 'CUTTING-EDGE EDITING' - including plenty of jolly chases that includes - 'A TUK-TUK VS CLASSIC JAG EVENT' situated in Tangier,Morocco, - and also for the many fans of 'THE INDY PURISTS' - that are complete with 'SOME CREEPY ENCOUNTERS WITH INSECTS' - and also 'AN UNDERGROUND TOMB - WHOSE PASSAGEWAYS OPEN UP WITH A GRINDING NOISE' - and no its isn't Quasimodo - a big man who's got the 'HUMP' and also searching for Esmerelda,- his lost love in Notre Dame only to find a certain Michael Portillo -,a former MP, - now turned seasoned traveller -'normally a train spotter' and carries a bible such as either a George Bradshaw's or even a Daniel Appleton's Travel Guides and who also ironically happens to bump into Quasi and between them share a BIG BOTTLE OF - 'THE BELL'S' - TRADITIONAL WHISKY - 'OTHER WHISKY DISTILLERIES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE' - whilst SORTING OUT their domestic problems - in their 'SANCTUARY'.\n\nAnd so in closing this film review is that i would like to pay tribute to the film franchise in total and when I saw 'RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK' - the first instalment of the franchise way back in the Summer of 1981,- on a warm Wednesday afternoon situated in the heart of Manchester City Centre at the ABC CINEMA - and also situated in Deansgate - In the Circle upstairs in Cinema 1,- now those were the great years in my entire life - (its now a pub/restaurant establishment called 'THE MOON UNDER WATER’ - an establishment of Wetherspoon's) that as I paid my cinema ticket and provided myself at the concessionary kiosk armed with a Large Pepsi Cola, a large Ho"
