        "text": "Film production company\n\nMalpaso Productions is Clint Eastwood's production company.[1] It was established in 1967 as The Malpaso Company by Eastwood's financial adviser Irving Leonard for the film Hang 'Em High, using profits from the Dollars Trilogy. Leonard served as President of the Malpaso Company until his death on December 13, 1969.\n\nName origins\n\n[edit]\n\nThe name is derived from Malpaso Creek (Spanish for \"bad step\", or \"misstep\"), located south of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. Eastwood had received U.S. Army basic training at nearby Fort Ord, where he remained as a lifeguard until discharged in 1953.[2] On December 24, 1967, Eastwood bought five parcels totaling 283 acres (115 ha) of land along Malpaso Creek from Charles Sawyer.[3] He later added more land until he owned 650 acres (260 ha). The land bordered the south bank of Malpaso Creek from the eastern side of Highway 1 to the coastal ridge. He sold it to Monterey County in 1995 for $3.08 million.[4][5] Near the coast, a trail and later a road ran from Carmel to Big Sur during the 1800s. The creek has very steep side slopes and there was only one crossing (a ford only 10 feet (3.0 m) above sea level) until the Malpaso Creek Bridge was built in 1935 as part of Highway 1.\n\nFounding\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen Eastwood agreed to take the role of The Man with No Name in A Fistful of Dollars in 1964, his agent told him that it would be a \"bad step\" for his career. The Dollars Trilogy was surprisingly successful. After filming Where Eagles Dare in 1968, Eastwood grew annoyed about the money he considered wasted during these big productions. He wanted more creative control over his films and decided to form his own production company. He thought the choice of \"Malpaso\" was appropriate.[6]\n\nIrving Leonard, Eastwood's financial adviser, organized the company for Eastwood following the success of and using the earnings from the Dollars Trilogy.[7] The first feature they produced was the 1968 film Hang 'Em High. Leonard served as President of the Malpaso Company and associate producer of Eastwood's films from Hang 'Em High until his death in 1969.[8][9]\n\nEastwood is known for very tight shooting schedules, finishing his films on schedule and on budget, or earlier and under budget, typically in much less time than most production companies.[10]\n\nFew film production companies such as Malpaso Productions have been involved with one studio for releasing its motion pictures. Warner Bros. Pictures has served as the distributor of many of Clint Eastwood's produced, directed and starred films, a relationship that has lasted for nearly half a century and resulted in more than 40 features.[11]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\n1960s\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Director Distributor Names Notes 1968 Hang 'Em High Ted Post United Artists The Malpaso Company co-production with Leonard Freeman Productions; first film Coogan's Bluff Don Siegel Universal Pictures 1969 Paint Your Wagon Joshua Logan Paramount Pictures top production billing went to Alan Jay Lerner Productions\n\n1970s\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Director Distributor Names Notes 1970 Two Mules for Sister Sara Don Siegel Universal Pictures The Malpaso Company co-production with Sanen Productions 1971 The Beguiled co-production with Jennings Lang Productions Play Misty for Me Clint Eastwood Dirty Harry Don Siegel Warner Bros.
