        "text": "Cinderella Operas (arranged chronologically):\n\nRossini, Gioacchini Antonio (1792-1868). La Cenerentola: La bonta in trionfo. First performed at the Teatro Valle, in Rome, January 25, 1817. Libretto by Jacopo Ferretti, entitled Angiolina, ossia La Bonta in trionfo.\n\nCast: Geltrude Righetti-Giorgi (Angiolina/Cenerentola); Andrea Verni (Don Magnifico); Guiseppe Debegnis (Dandini); Giacomo Guglielmi (Don Ramiro); Caterina Rossi (Clorinda); Teresa Mariani (Thisbe); Zenobio Vitarelli (Alidoro).\n\n[Opera buffa, in two acts: Alidoro, the prince’s instructor, serves in place of a fairy godmother to instruct the prince, Don Ramiro, in human values and facilitate his meeting of Cinderella/Angelina, a woman of true virtue. A critique of class hypocrisy and the cruelty of a degenerate aristocracy, this enlightenment study eschews magic. The father, rather than a stepmother, is the villain. The Prince trades places with his servant Dandini, at Alidoro’s suggestion, to see how it is. The second act begins with a drinking scene in which the father is made wine steward. His bitterness hangs over the play, Malvolio-like to the end, as he refuses to accept Cinderella’s rise above his aristocratic decadence until he is forced to his knees by economic threats. Angelina, cast as an alto/mezzo-soprano, moves from a haunting ballad in a minor key, wherein she tells of her misery,into a brilliant coloratura in her final aria, when she has come into her full voice. There are three videotapes of this opera, one a truly outstanding studio production at La Scala in Milan, with Frederica Von Stade as Cinderella, Francisco Araiza as Don Ramiro, Paolo Montarsolo as Don Magnifico, Margherita Guglielmi as Clorinda, Laura Zannini as Tisbe, Paul Plishka as Alidoro, and Claudio Desderi as Dandini; marketed by the Metropolitan Opera in New York (Munich: Unitel, 1981); the second, a terrific live performance at the Salzburg festival (1988), with Ann Murray as Cinderella, Francisco Araiza as Don Ramiro, and Gino Quilico as Dandini (this production heightens effectively the tragic components of Cinderella’s life and has some wonderful stage effects during the storm); the third, a reasonably good live production at Glyndebourne, 1983, with Kathleen Kuhlmann as Cinderella, Marta Taddei as Clorinda, Laura Zannini as Tisbe, Laurence Dale as Prince Don Ramiro, Claudio Desderi as Don Magnifico, Roderick Kennedy as Alidoro, and Alberto Rinaldi as Dandini (this latter production makes interesting use of puppet theater in the storm scene). A full length film was made of the opera in Italy, 1948. See the entries under Movies.

See productions by Pyne and Harrison (1855)and the Richings English Opera Company (1867), cited below. This pantomime was printed without credit to Rolphino Lacy by Samuel French as French’s Standard Drama, no. CLXIV, New York: Samuel French, n.d., and in the Turner’s Dramatic Library, #58, after 1840. French’s edition lists performances and casts from “Holiday St. Baltimore, 1839. Chestnut St. Philad. 1840. Barnum’s Museum 1856.” The Turner’s Dramatic Library edition lists casts for Baltimore 1839 and Philadelphia 1840. In all of these productions Prince Felix and Dandini were sung and acted by males and Clorinda and Thisbe by females.\n\n[Lacy’s printed edition includes this note on Costumes: Prince–1st Dress: Green hunting shirt; cloak with star, tights, high boots, cap and white feathers, gauntlets, short sword and boar spear. 2nd Dress: White satin shirt, white tights, ankle shoes embroidered, short arm-hole robe of crimson, or purple velvet; jewelled cap with white plumes.Baron–1st Dress: Velvet doublet and full trunks, dressing gown and cap, slippers. 2nd Dress: Arm-hole velvet cloak, hat and feathers, shoes and rosettes. Alidoro–Black velvet shape and cloak. Dandini–Neat yellow shirt, boots, etc. Pedro–Red short shirt, red tights. Cinderella–1st Dress: Rich double dress, embroidered veil. 2nd Dress: Plain dark wrapper. Clorinda and Thisbe–Handsome dresses of the time. Fairies–Fanciful and light dresses, wands, flowers, etc.\n\n[Synopsis: Act I, Sc. 1: The Fairies’ haunt–a romantic scene surrounded by bowers of roses in the midst of which rises a sparkling fountain. A broad lake in the distance, shut in by mountains which stretch to the horizon. The sun is just seen rising over them. During the symphony numerous Sylphs and Fairies enter, forming a dance around the fountain to the chorus “While sunbeams are glancing.” FQ appears and sings the air “From distant regions flying,” with chorus “We’re here to yield our duty.” She is the guardian spirit of Cinderella and tells of her abuse. Horns sound and she informs the sylphs that the youthful Prince must choose a partner of his throne. That woman will be “the mortal daughter whom your Queen befriends.” The fairies conduct the Prince on stage, unconscious of his guidance. He sings: “Morning its sweets is flinging.” Never has he seen so beauteous a spot. He sounds his horn and as the call dies away a strain of music near him begins. He and the fairies sing a concerted piece, whereby he knows he is on enchanted ground. He looks into the fountain and views the form of Cinderella, splendidly attired, her features half shaded by a thin veil. As he reaches toward the image the FQ makes it disappear. She then touches Prince Felix with her wand, and he sleeps.\n\n[Sc. 2: A forest glade. During the symphony hunters cross the stage armed with spears and bearing a dead wild boar suspended from a pole; others with a variety of game. Alidoro and Dandini, amidst the chorus “What wild sounds, the hunters attending,” come upon the sleeping Prince. He awakens wondering if they have seen what he saw. Alidoro recalls a similar dream that he had to guide “my sovereign to the old castle of the Baron of Montefiesco, where virtue, youth, and beauty awaited him, worthy of a throne.” The Prince notes that they have already been invited to the ball and that the report of the women is fair but that the Baron is a fool. The Prince decides to divest himself of his pomp and lay the right of royalty on Dandini in order to visit the Baron in hope of seeing the damsel.\n\n[Sc. 3:A Gothic room in the Baron’s Castle, opening into a garden. On left a full-length swing mirror and an antique high fireplace. Cinderella is discovered on a low stool by the fireplace while Clorinda and Thisbe take advantage of the mirror, Clorinda practising a dance step and Thisbe trying a flower on her head and breast. Trio, with Cinderella’s “Once a King there chanced to be” ballad, as in Rossini. FQ appears at the door as a beggar. In a quartette she beseeches, is scorned by the two sisters, and pitied by Cinderella. The sisters depart, imagining how vexed Cinderella will be when she sees their beauty and Pedro enters with boxes of dresses, hat, feathers, etc. As they squabble over the things, they knock Pedro over and he crushes that bandbox containing the Spanish hat. A concerted piece and chorus as Alidoro arrives to announce the Prince. The sisters double their demands upon Cinderella as she mocks them with her “Cinderella here, Cinderella there” patter song and the sisters fight over who is the more likely to be chosen. Their noise awakens the Baron who enters angry, singing about his wonderful dream, a dream in which he was a Jackass who was wonderfully transformed into a flying creature with progeny. They tell him of the Prince’s impending visit, and it seems that the dream must already be coming true. The Prince enters, disguised and alone, with a recitative “All round is silent.” Cinderella enters singing her “Once a King there chanc’t to be” and is startled as she happily bumps into Felix. They respond to the experience with a duet, “Whence this soft and pleasing flame.” The sisters call for Cinderella, who must tend them, and the Prince meditates ecstatically on her innocence and simplicity as well as her resemblance to the woman of his dream. The Baron and sisters enter, then Dandini, with extravagant airs. The Baron and daughters are enthralled. Cinderella approaches the Baron, hoping for permission to attend the ball but is refused. In an extravagant concerted piece the Baron ridicules her, Dandini wishes to leave, the Prince tries to overhear what the Baron is saying, and Cinderella laments. FQ appears and gives Alidoro an open book, which says that the Baron has three daughters, the third named Angelina. The Baron swears she is dead, Cinderella knows she isn’t, and in a quintette they all express their uncertainty.\n\n[Act II, Sc. 1: A Chamber in the Palace. The Prince and Dandini discuss the situation. Clorinda and Thisbe flirt with “Prince” Dandini, who offers to marry one if the other will marry his valet. Both girls sing “No, no, no,” and scorn the true Prince. He then tells Dandini that the ruse is over and advises him to disclose himself to the Baron, which he does.\n\n[Sc. 2: The kitchen in the Baron’s house, with dresser, table, chair, broom, washing tubs, spinning wheel, flax, and mousetrap, etc. Cinderella contemplates the image of the “Prince” she saw. Pedro enters singing “Once a King.” Pedro expresses his love for her, and she laments her ugliness. Signs appear on the wall and chimney that Cinderella’s woes are about over and that she will receive a just reward. She is amazed, but the fairies now enter singing “Cease Cinderella.” FQ blesses her as Pedro fears devil’s tricks. He is asked to fetch the pumpkin, mice, etc. All are transformed and both Cinderella and Pedro are dressed for the ball. Pedro helps Cinderella into the carriage and they’re off.\n\n[Act III, Sc. 1:Richly decorated ballroom in Prince’s Palace, with glass doors at center opening into a colonnade; festoons of flowers, variegated lamps, chandeliers, etc., with chair of state on a platform with steps. A dance is in progess with the Prince in melancholy sitting on his throne. A large clock is over the arch. The chorus sings “In light tripping measure,” but the Prince is visibly disappointed. Then the Princess without a name is announced. Cinderella’s car comes to the portico; she is half veiled. The Prince rushes to her and falls at her feet: “O rapture!” Cinderella replies: “He the Prince? Delightful moment!” Alidoro praises her form, but the Baron sees nothing particular in it. The Prince and Cinderella sing a duet, “Let thine eyes on mine mildly beaming.” The Prince asks her name and kingdom, but she is silent. He withdraws her veil. The Baron and sisters cannot believe their eyes, and don’t, sure that the woman could not be Cinderella. She asks the Baron if he has other children. He says only two. She wishes them happiness and the prince praises her father. She says her father disowns her. The Baron scorns him as a “brute.” The Prince then takes her to the feast while Tyrolese singers and dancers entertain. Pedro appears to warn her that midnight is upon them. He asks for a minute or two longer. A waltz begins, and the Prince prevails. At the stroke of twelve she flees, escaping through the dancers. The Prince is too far behind and does not heed her in rags. Pedro is less fortunate; he is so involved dancing with a fine lady that she screams and indignantely retires when his fine clothes fly up in the air leaving him in his servant’s garb. He continues dancing by himself until pages hastily expel him from the room. The Prince finds the glass slipper. The Prince asks if any know anything about her, and the Baron pipes up: “I believe, then, my gracious Prince–nay, I am almost sure–or, rather, I have strong reasons to suspect–that nobody here knows anything about her.” The Prince calls him a prating fool and withdraws distracted as the Chorus sings “What demon’s opposing malice.”\n\n[Sc. 2: The Kitchen in the Baron’s Castle; the rat-trap and mouse-trap again in their places. Pedro enters in pursuit of a pumpkin that rolls before him. Cinderella enters panting. They have barely got home before the Baron. Cinderella laments the loss of her slipper, but Pedro says that that may be cause for hope. The Baron arrives and Pedro anticipates “a fie account of ourselves.”\n\n[Sc. 3: An apartment in the Baron’s house. They discuss the ball. Pedro enters with a paper announcing the Prince’s intention to marry the one who fits the slipper. He cannot read it (he’s iliterate) and the sisters, in their greed, tear it in two. Finally the Baron pieces it together and reads it. Cinderella wishes to go too, but again they mock her. Pedro reassures her that she will be there.\n\n[Sc. 4: A Hall in the Prince’s Palace. The Prince is both disappointed and glad that the slipper fits none of the lot. The Baron arrives and his two daughters try, with much bickering. Then Pedro appears, insisting that he must advance–he’ll have his way even if he dies for it. The Baron recognizes him. Pedro insists that he is an ambassador of one who desires only to show her foot here. The music that ushered her to the ball the first time resumes, and Cinderella appears. The Prince turns away in bitter disappointment. Cinderella is stunned but Pedro says he has a right to look as he likes. Clorinda is shocked that it is Cinderella, and the Baron is assured. Thisbe plans to starve her for a week for this gag. Cinderella is timid, fearing that he has forgotten “my features” or now dislikes her. The Baron rushes forward to disclaim her, and the Prince recognizes her as the Baron’s pretty servant. The Baron tries to silence Pedro but he speaks up: “you killed the dear creature once already yesterday, and I won’t be a participator in such suicide.” The Prince acknowledges the fit and permits her to ascend the pedestal to “try thy fortune–though heaven forefend thy triumph!” She ascends the pedestal, the slipper fits; FQ appears, and with a touch of her wand Angelina is changed into the gown she wore at the ball. At the same time the whole scene changes showing a fantastically Gorgeous Hall, with fairies at the back. The Prince is enwrapped in delight, and FQ admonishes Cinderella: “thou hast been humble in adversity: be modest now in greatness!” Cinderella marvels at her changed fate, from lasting misery to transporting bliss. She sings an air on the passing of Sorrow’s clouds, and the Chorus joins in, “Like the lightning, swiftly ending, / May our griefs for ever fly!”\n\n[See the 1831 adaptation ofLacy’s operaabove underPantomime.

After a chorus and dance on glancing sunbeams the Fairy Queen enters in a swan car to announce her decision to marry the prince to Cinderella. He’s the one she has been watching for and he’s in the neighborhood having searched the world for a bride without success. The Prince enters the magical place singing and wondering why his horses refused to enter. In a concerted piece the Prince and fairies define the music of the place, and he begins to echo the Fairy Queen’s words. She presents a vision of Cinderella for him in the fountain then with a wave of her wand it all disappears. Distant horns sound and the fairies put him to sleep.\n\n[Sc. 2: Cloud flats. The Fairy Queen listens, then waves the clouds off.\n\n[Sc. 3: A beautiful Eastern Landscape. After a chorus Dandini discovers the Prince asleep. The Prince awakens, describes his vision to Alidoro, and wonders if they saw anything. They have seen nothing, but Alidoro recalls a dream that he had which corresponds to the Prince’s. His dream had indicated that the woman was a daughter to the Baron of Montifiesco, a pompous fool. With a marching chorus they return to the castle, and the Prince announces that he will go to the Baron in disguise.\n\n[Sc. 4: A Gothic Room in the Baron’s Castle. Cinderella at the fireplace, Clorinda before a mirror practicing a dance, Thisbe at another mirror fixing a flower in her hair sing a trio based on Rossini. The sisters complain about their strenuous work and mock Cinderella when she says she could dance for twenty-four hours without tiring. The Fairy Queen comes to the door disguised as a decrepit old woman. Quartette based on Rossini as FQ begs, the two sisters scorn, and Cinderella cares for the poor woman. When Clorinda would drive her out she casts a spell that stops Clorinda in her tracks, then departs. Pedro arrives with stuff for the ball. He laughs as Clorinda’s hat and feathers are flattened and broken. Alidoro and hunters arrive to announce that the Prince himself will visit. A quartette in which all concerned bustle about, Cinderella lamenting how they all tell her to run here and there and Alidoro wondering about the confusion in their brains. The Baron appears, having been rudely awakened, and tells of his portentuous dream of a jackass which he figures to be himself. Clorinda and Thisbe tell him that the Prince is coming, and he is certain his dream is coming true. The Prince arrives disguised as Dandini, meets Cinderella, and they sing a love duet that leaves them in confusion. The Baron denies that Cinderella is his child; Alidoro produces a book announcing her birth, but the Baron denies it. Act I ends, as in Rossini, with an ensemble piece as groups comment on each other.\n\n[Act II, Sc. 1: Chamber in the Palace. The Prince and Dandini discuss the two sisters; the Prince decides to be himself again and leaves Dandini to explain to the Baron, which he does in a witty duet.\n\n[Sc. 2: Cinderella and Pedro discuss why the Baron detests her. The Fairy Queen appears and prepares them for the ball, using pumpkin, mice, and two garden pots. The clothes of both Cinderella and Pedro are trans-formed into finery.\n\n[Sc. 3: The scene changes to the exterior of the Prince’s Palace, as FQ warns Cinderella to return before midnight. Finale, as Cinderella and fairies sing of their joy.\n\n[Act III, in which Miss L. Pyne introduces a new aria composed by Jules Benedict called “The Skylark.”Sc. 1:The ballroom with grand piazza and moonlight city in the background. After a choral dance the Prince laments that his dream woman is not there. Then she appears, and they sing a duet. She remains veiled, however, and he wonders what her name is. She won’t say, musing that she forgot to ask F what her name should be. She talks with the Baron, asking him if he has no other children. He insists not, and she gives him a ring. He praises her lucky parents, but she says her father disowns her, which makes the Baron rage against such a brute. After “Song of the Sky Lark,” which Cinderella sings, Pedro notes that it’s nearly midnight. The clock strikes twelve and they flee.\n\n[Sc. 2: A landscape in view of the Palace. Pedro bustles about stage in pursuit of a pumpkin which rolls about.\n\n[Sc. 3: The Kitchen in the Baron’s Palace. Cinderella in dismay looks at the things. She commiserates with Pedro who notices that she still has one of the little glass slippers. The other, she remembers, came off in the ballroom. Clorinda and Thisbe arrive, and Cinderella is eager to hear their report of the ball.\n\n[Sc. 4: An apartment in the Baron’s house. The sisters praise the mysterious princess, and Pedro announces that the Prince is searching for the owner of the slipper. The sisters mock Cinderella’s wish to try the slipper, but Pedro vows that she will have her chance.\n\n[Sc. 5: A hall in the Prince’s Palace, with all present for the trial of the slipper. The Baron presents his two daughters, who try but fail. The Baron wishes he had given them the Chinese foot treatment thirty years ago. Pedro appears. Alidoro would send him away, but the Prince lets him speak. Pedro says he is ambassador to a Princess. Alidoro calls him fool, but the Prince would see her. He sits down depressed. Pedro brings in Cinderella. The Baron tries to attack them both, but Pedro says the Baron already murdered her yesterday and refuses to be silent–“I won’t be a silent participator in such a double-distilled, murderous suicide.” The Prince intervenes, but is disappointed; he sees that her face is like that of his vision, but, given her wretched condition, “heaven forfend thy triumph.”\n\n[Sc. 6: A magnificent scene in the palace as FQ appears and transforms Cinderella into Sweet Angelina: “Thou hast been humble in adversity, be modest in thy greatness.” A final chorus sings of sorrow’s clouds passing.]\n\nCinderella; or, The Fairy and Little Glass Slipper.

There are some new features (as in the Turner’s Dramatic Library edition)-the Fairy Queen’s car is drawn by two swans in Act I, sc. 1, and Act I, sc. 2, is a dance of Cloud Flats–but mainly it is a reprinting of Lacy’s opera. Given the fact that the Pyne and Harrison English Opera Troupe’s version includes the swan car and the Cloud Flats scene it is possible that French’s edition draws upon it as well as Lacy. But there is much as well that differs in the 1855 edition from Lacy’s editions of the 1830s, none of which makes it into French’s Standard Drama edition. The French edition mentions American productions in Baltimore, 1839, Philadelphia 1840 (see entries and casts, above), and Barnum’s Museum 1856, so it must have been printed shortly after 1856.]\n\nCinderella: Or, The Fairy Queen and Glass Slipper.

The program/book includes advertising for local businesses.\n\n[Act I, Sc. 1: The Prince, having searched the world over for a mate, complains about Spanish maidens for being too dark and English girls who “danse so they spoil a fellow’s curls.” When the Fairy Queen appears to tell him his lot has been cast amd shows him Cinderella’s image he’s quite undone–“I am the gonest, / I’ll snatch her from her nest.” As Alidora and Dandini enter to announce that they have all lost their way, Dandini boasts that he’d be a better prince than the Prince. The Prince tells them of his Fairy encounter and announces the ball–“my charmer will be there”; moreover, he will change places with Dandini in order to observe her more readily. The scene ends with Polka Dancers, Tambourine Dancers, Shepherdesses, and Castanet Dancers, performing to “Just Look at That” and “The Maid and the Muleteer.”\n\n[Sc. 2: More dancing to “Juvenile Courtship,” “Buy a Broom,” and “The Belle of the Ball.”\n\n[Sc. 3: After yet another dismal day in the dumps, Cinderella takes abusive orders from Clorinda, then the Baron and Tisbie, as Thisbie, preparing for the ball, says her dress is an atrocity, and the Baron laments his impecuniosity. The Prince enters disguised as Dandini, and instantly he and Cinderella yearn for each other–“the hero of my dream… I’m about to scream.” The Prince tells her not to and kisses her instead, whereupon she’s even more eager to scream. He tells her that he will get her out of the ashes if she’ll marry him. She replies that she can’t marry until her sisters do. The Prince is no dunce and will see to it at once.\n\n[Sc. 4: Performances of “He’s Pretty as He Can Be,” “The Waterfall,” “Matrimonial Sweets,” a march by the Cinderella Cadets, The Roman Guards, The Daughters of Liberty, and the Amazonian Queens, then “I’m Very Fond of Music,” after which the Royal Guards and the court enter. The Baron denies that he has other than two daughters, the Prince challenges him, Dandini silences the Prince, and Buttoni produces Cinderella, to the Prince’s delight. Though all plead that she be permitted to attend, Pa says, “No.”\n\n[Sc. 5: A musical interlude of “When the Pigs Begin to Fly” and a whistling chorus of “The German Fifth.”\n\n[Act II, Sc. 1: The Prince reassures the disgraced Buttoni. After “The Conspirator’s Chorus” and “The Couple’s Song and Chorus” Clorinda pursues Dandini. He seeks variety, which he gets in Thisbie. The Baron intercedes on behalf of either, and Dandini escapes by telling who he is.\n\n[Sc. 3: “Not Before Pa,” “Under the Lilacs,” “Ivy Green,” “Over the Garden Wall,“and “Dost Thou Love Me, Sister Ruth?” are sung while Buttoni watches Cinderella sleep and awaken, and wonders if she dreams of him. Cinderella tells him her dream is of a Prince’s Hall, not him. The Godmother appears and tells her of the Prince’s real identity. So she sets out for the ball, admonished to leave by midnight if she is to enjoy her wedding day tomorrow.\n\n[Sc. 4: “Policeman’s Song” and “Rollicking Dolly Day,” then Pedro and Dromio discuss the two stepsisters. Clorinda would dance with the Prince, but he’s “booked ten deep” to the mysterious lady. She would depart, but the Baron still has refreshments to taste.\n\n[Sc. 5: “The Moons,” “No,” “Lardy Dah,” and “The Funny Old Gal” are sung as the Prince and Cinderella pledge their love.\n\n[Sc. 6: “The Man in the Moon is Looking, Love” followed by the Minuet Dancers. The Prince tells the Baron that his daughters are too old; Alfonso praises the mysterious lady and the Baron says he has a daughter who looks like her.\n\n[Sc. 6: The Prince scorns the Baron: “You mean that coaly little wretch?” and Cinderella joins in the mockery of the Baron’s bad judgment.\n\n[Sc. 7: The Chinese Ambassadors sing “Allasame,” followed by “Climb Up,” “Kiss, Kiss,” and “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.” It is midnight, and Cinderella takes off to a Chorus of Pages singing from “Le Petit Duc.” The Prince finds the tiny slipper. Clorinda calls it too large for her, but the Prince unveils his plan. Clorinda tries it on anyway, to no avail. Then Cinderella tries. It fits exactly, despite Dandini’s mockery. Clorinda and Thisbie can’t believe their senses and put the blame on the lager beer. Final song: “Apple of My Eye.”]\n\nFarmer, John (1836-1901). Cinderella: A Fairy Opera in Four Acts. With words by Henry S. Leigh. Harrow [Middlesex]: J. C. Wilbee, 1882. Vocal score 154 pages. Cast: Chorus of good fairies, Cinderella, Prince Maribel, Dr. Malatesta, Priscilla and Tabitha (the cruel sisters), the Fairy Queen, Baron Pomposo, huntsmen, and courtiers.\n\n[Five page overture. Act I. Sc. 1: Forest by moonlight. At the back, a Prince’s Castle, with view of town to the left. A group of Fairies are discovered at the rise of the curtain singing “The Sunshine is over, the night is before us, no mortals are near.” Then the Chorus sings “In Yonder Sleeping City,” which tells of a sleeping and weeping maiden, her path unlighted by hope’s protecting ray. The fairies will be her protectors.\n\n[Sc. 2: Sunrise. Shepherds are heard playing in the distance. Enter Cinderella carrying flowers and singing “Brightly, gaily, breaks the morn.” She thinks of her hard lot, her cruel sisters, her kind father who lavishes goods upon them, and her departed mother on whose grave she places violets. The Prince enters thinking he must be seeing a vision and sings “Dearest, fairest, ne’er till not Love in his tyrant fetters hath bound me…” Malatesta enters quietly, overhears the Prince’s song and warns him in recitative, “May it please your royal highness,” that flirtation is a pretty pastime but love and beauty dangerous wiles; pop the question to some princess, and leave the peasant girls alone. The Prince comments on the Doctor’s lack of natural sentiment, but Malatesta warns the Prince of the scandal that would ensue. Huntsmen enter with a chorus of “The hunt is up.”\n\n[Act II: The Kitchen in the Baron’s Manor. Evening. Cinderella is discovered sitting gloomily by the fire. She sings “The night is falling fast,” which laments the gloom of her life and wishes some fairy might help her. Priscilla and Tabitha enter in ball dresses and dance a practice minuet together–“Come, take your partners all”–then mock Cinderella. A knock at the door. The Fairy Queen enters as a beggar woman and sings “Kindly, good ladies, give ear.” The sisters scorn her for daring to disturb their peace, but Cinderella gives her bread and milk. The Fairy blesses her. The Baron enters in ball dress, cursing women for making him wait. He sings “The women are always a bother.” Priscilla and Tabitha join in, accusing men of always being in a hurry. The sisters depart, and the Baron lingers to apologize to Cinderella for leaving her alone, but “there are circumstances…” Alone, Cinderella looks out the window and watches the palace lights in the distance. She hears the music and yearns for sleep. After a gavotte fairies appear singing “Dream, brightly dream.” They awaken Cinderella to the ful-fillment of her wishes. The Fairy Queen warns her after the transformation, “Take your time from us precisely,” a recita-tive and song through which she instructs Cinderella in dancing. Cinderella would gladly walk to the Palace–it’s only five minutes away–but FQ provides a carriage along with an admonition to leave before midnight. Chorus: “Haste away!”\n\n[Act III: Ballroom at the Palace. The Prince is seated on a raised throne with canopy surrounded by Ladies and Gentlemen of the Court, with Guards at the back. Two staircases lead to the Conservatory. A processional march. Then the Baron and his daughters enter, which provokes anxiety from Malatesta that the Prince might choose someone other than a princess. Children sing a quadrille “O, my love’s like the red, red, rose,” which is interrupted by Cinderella’s entrance. The Prince advances and takes her hand. A minuet is formed, and the Prince and lady discourse in recititive, with chorus encouraging the dance. Love talk in song, with Cinderella nervous about the time. At midnight she flees through the Conservatory, dropping one of her slippers on the stair. The Prince pursues, but too late: The enchantress has escaped. Chorus: “Come, let the dance and song beguile the time before us” as they dance until dawn.\n\n[Act IV, Sc. 1: The Baron enters his hall with the two yawning sisters. He sings, “I, who nightly like to toddle.” It is well past noon. The sisters lament the appearance at the ball of the mysterious women with a scolding duet: “When a maiden is young.” A herald, guards, and Malatesta enter announcing the slipper search. He sings “On moral force no sage relies.” The Prince and his courtiers enter and the sisters appear finely dressed to meet him. The Baron welcomes the courtiers, but the sisters shut him up. So does the Prince who accuses him of equivocating and demands to see Cinderella. Cinderella appears in rags, protesting that the Prince must be making some mistake. But he takes her hand, puts the slipper on her, and announces his bride to the court. After laments and many a “foiled again!” from Malatesta and the sisters, exeunt omnes shouting “Long live the Prince and Princess.” The happy couple lingers to sing a duet, “Dearest and loveliest.” In finale the scene opens at back discovering the fairies with the Queen at the center singing “Farewell, ye loving souls.”]\n\nMassenet, Jules (1842-1912).

Madame, anxious to get her aging daughters married, is eager to set out for the ball. She rouses Pandolfe and they leave. Cinderella comes in exhausted, sits by the hearth, and falls asleep. As she dreams by the fire, fairies appear and make her a dress of moonbeams, then awaken her. Amazed that her dream is a reality she sets out for the ball in her shining robe in a coach with attendants. The fairy godmother warns her that she must return promptly on the stroke of midnight.\n\n[Act II: At Court. The hall of the festivities and the royal gardens. All brightly illuminated.

Cinderella laments the loss of her slipper. She withdraws to her room as the rest arrive home. They discuss the strange woman. Cinderella returns to question them about the event, and they become increasingly hostile against the mysterious person. Cinderella is upset by their anger, especially as they turn it toward her father. He takes her in his arms and tells them to stop all their noise. The three women leave the room in hysteria while Pandolfe consoles Cinderella. He acknowledges that he has done her a great wrong in obeying his ambitious wife by taking her to the court and promises to take Cinderella back to their quiet country place where they might live in peace. After he leaves Cinderella determines to go away alone so that her father won’t be burdened by her misery. She grieves that she will see neither the Prince nor her father again, says goodbye to the various pieces of furniture in the house, then leaves at night in a fierce thunder storm.\n\n[Sc. 2: The woods under a great oak. Both Cinderella and the Prince take refuge under the oak over which the fairies preside, but without seeing each other. Both address prayers to the Fairy, Cinderella asking for pardon for the pain she has caused her father, and the Prince for relief for the pain he feels having lost Cinderella. She hears his prayer and thinks his misery is greater than hers. So she prays for him. They recognize each other’s voices and rejoice as the Fairy gives them power to see each other again. A magic sleep falls upon them as they are lulled by the fairies.\n\n[Act IV, Sc. 1: The terrace of Cinderella’s home. A spring morning. Pandolfe comes upon Cinderella sleeping.

New York: G. Schirmer, 1911.\n\nMartin, Warren. The True Story of Cinderella (1955). For 12 Solo Voices, Chime, Narrator, and Piano. Princeton: Westminster Choir College, 1984.\n\n[Composed in 1955 at the request of students to provide a May Day entertainment. The premiere at the Westminster Choir College was performed by 13 graduate students with the composer at the piano. The chime part was added a few years later. Martin’s score was published after his death in 1982. The full score is in his own hand, and was sold with a cassette tape to show the composer’s intent as to performance style and timing. The score specifies that this Cinderella is not a staged work but is sung in oratorio style with the singers in a row across the front of the platform, facing forward, not playing to or looking at each other. The singers are seated in the following order (from left to right): Queen, King, Stepmother, 1st Stepsister, 2nd Stepsister, Cinderella, Prince, Fairy Godmother, 1st Hermit, 2nd Hermit, 3rd Hermit, Herald. Where the narrator stands is not specified.\n\nSynopsis: The queen sings of her royal highnessty from the dynasty of Richard Coeur de Lion; the king, in duet tells how he, like a bald eagle, looks down on the lowly plebeians. The young prince suffers from a malady that has caused him to lose his voice, but one which may be cured at the sound of the voice of a beautiful woman. So a ball is proclaimed. In a farmhouse lived a proud old widow whose “husband was good lookin’, Twas a shame he had to die; they say it was my cookin’.” She has a pair of repulsive daughters who are mean to their mother. One is roisterous, boisterous and built like a house; the other is driveling, sniveling and built like a beanpole. Cinderella is so sweet, “who could but love me?” but she is left alone to cry and cry and cry and cry, and do all the work, etc. In a duet her fairy godmother appears and suggests that maybe she will get to kiss the prince. In a trio the stepmother and stepsisters dress and set out for the ball. The fairy godmother returns and in an interlude the narrator explains how the pumpkin is fetched, along with mice, and all are transformed as is Cinderella as well; he tells of the midnight warning then segues back to the duet of thank you’s and goodbyes by Cinderella and the godmother. At the ball the queen sings an amusing song about her laryngitis and the stepfamily sings an aggressive song about their wretchedness. Then Cinderella arrives and meets the prince who immediately finds his voice and proposes marriage. They pledge their love while the stepsisters curse, the king congratulates and the queen jubilates. The herald announces the dance, and they dance and dance until midnight approaches. After a tender (extended) goodbye the chime sounds and Cinderella flees. For months the prince wanders seeking her. A hermit sends him to another hermit who sends him to a third, who knows of a Phoebe Beebe who, he imagines, might take care of a booby like himself. The prince goes to that farmhouse, finds Cinderella, and they return to court. The stepfamily finds the situation to be hopeless and miserable, but Cinderella brings them along and in the finale the ensemble celebrates the national holiday as Cinderella and the prince marry, and the first hermit chooses the fat stepsister, the second hermit takes the stepmother, and the third chooses Phoebe, he having known that farmer named Beebe. The herald feels left out - until the godmother appears and declares her love for him, honey lamb, and they all live happily ever after as the ensemble tells the audience that they may all be happy too.]\n\nLa Cenerentola.

Rodgers and Hammerstein Fact Book: A Record of their Works Together and with Other Collaborators, New York: The Lynn Farnol Group, Inc., 1980. The materials on Hammerstein and Rodgers, in their various combinations with Herbert Stothart, Rudolf Friml, Jerome Kern, and Lorenz Hart are arranged chronologically. Not all the musicals cited here derive from these teams of musicians, of course, nor are they necessarily strictly Cinderella stories. Another main source for detailed production information on Cinderella musicals early in the twentieth century detailed below is Alvin H. Marill’s excellent section on “Cinderella,” in More Theatre: Stage to Screen to Television. Vol. I: A-L. Metuchen, N.J., and London: Scarecrow Press, 1993, pp. 324-376. I have included adaptations if they include several of the basic components of a Cinderella plot or if the reviewers identify them as Cinderella stories. In the 1920s and 1930, many of the more successful musicals were converted into movies; those adaptations are detailed under Movies and TV.]\n\nThe Catch of the Season. Vaudeville Theatre, London.

This melodrama capitalizes on the myth of romantic, high-minded Canadian mounties, Snidely Whiplash-like villains, and the lovely woman about to be victimized. In brief, Rose-Marie, star performer at Lady Jane’s Hotel in Saskatchewan, is adored by awestruck Mounties and trappers, but her heart belongs to Jim Kenyon, a hardworking trapper. The villainous Edward Hawley, wealthy and conniving, witnesses a murder and puts the blame on Jim, then promises to save him if Rose-Marie will consent to become Mrs. Hawley. She agrees to the proposal to save her beloved, but at the last minute the real murder is discovered, Hawley exposed, and the lovers reunited.]\n\nRose-Marie was an enormous success, with hundreds of performances by touring companies in dozens of American cities, revivals, productions abroad, London productions (the run at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, from 20 March 1925 to 26 March 1927, enjoyed 85l performances), and was recast in film versions in 1928, 1936, and 1954. James Agate, in theLondon Sunday Times, 22 March 1925, catches the moment: “There is the spectacle… But is there not melancholy in the thought that this whoppingest of monuments to inanity should have been raised on these boards?… The applause was cataclysmic and, in my view, the piece will run one hundred and eleven years and fifteen days.” For a listing of touring company performances and reviews see Green, pp. 291-304, and the feature article “Rosemarie They Still Love You,”Life, 22 February 1954].\n\nGood Boy.

The unique, single performance was watched by an estimated 107,000,000 on a broadcast carried by 245 stations around the country. This production was quite lively, with Julie Andrews presenting a somewhat wittier Cinderella than the subsequent remake, a girl who takes genuine delight in imagining the stepsisters’ “sour-apple green” jealousy over her own loveliness at the ball. No film version was made of this production (video-tape had not yet been invented), though an audio tape was recorded and marketed. It is noteworthy that Julie Andrews at the age of 18 had performed Cinderella in a 1953 Palladium pantomime opposite comedians Max Bygraves and Richard “Mr. Pastry” Hearne. It was her success in that role that brought her to the attention of the producers ofThe Boy Friend, her first New York show. See Movies, for a later production of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Cinderella with a different cast, a production which was filmed and videotaped. And see Pantomime Productions, 1959 ff., for British Panto adaptations. Piano-Vocal Score of the musical was published New York: Williamson Music, 1962.]\n\nRevivals of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Cinderella: Musicarnival, Cleveland, 5 to 8 June 1961.\n\nCast: Monte Amundsen (Cinderella), Tommy Rall (Prince), Hal LeRoy (Portia).\n\nSwope Park Auditorium, Kansas City, Mo. 10 to 16 July 1961.\n\nCast:Carla Alberghetti (Cinderella), Tommy Rall (Prince), Hal LeRoy (Portia), Murray Matheson (The King), Mimi Randolph (The Queen).\n\nSt. Louis Municipal Theatre.
