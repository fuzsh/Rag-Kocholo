        "text": "While I’ve long admired the French actress and Academy Award winner Juliette Binoche, my first viewing a few years ago of Abbas Kiarostami’s 2010 film Certified Copy put her over the top as my favorite actress and age-appropriate crush.\n\nCertified Copy has since cemented itself as my favorite of Ms. Binoche’s films — “a bad-first-date movie” being my go-to description of it, though it becomes so much more by the time it arrives at its haunting final shot: a darkly romantic examination of identity and shifting perspective involving a woman (Ms. Binoche) and a man (William Shimell) whose contentious, burgeoning relationship passes through the looking-glass over the course of a single day together. We somehow know less about their lives at the end than we did when it began, and we’re left to speculate about their future, together or apart.\n\nFast-forward to the cosmic shitshow that is the Year of Our Lord 2020, in which I discovered, against all logic, that I am an “essential” employee. As COVID-19’s tendrils tightened their grip on our daily lives, the volume of my workload and the length of my workdays expanded. Each physically and mentally exhausting 50- to 60-hour workweek felt like something survived rather than merely completed, so I soon adopted a tradition of Pandemic Fridays, on which evenings I rewarded myself with three specific enticements:\n\nBourbon. Tater tots. Binoche.\n\nWhat can I say? The heart wants what the heart wants.\n\nEvery week posed a variation on each theme, whether I was drinking bourbon or rye whiskey, neat, on the rocks, or mixed into a Manhattan. Similarly, I have a few different ways of preparing tater tots, according to whim and other ingredients at hand. Add to those a different Juliette Binoche movie each week — 38 in all from among the available titles in her filmography, spanning her career from Hail Mary (Godard, 1985) to The Truth (Kore-eda, 2019) — and you’ve got yourself a coping mechanism right there.\n\nAs the year wore on, I found myself in the tall weeds of Ms. Binoche’s CV, which meant watching a number of films in which she was a supporting character rather than the star; some of these roles amounted to mere cameos. Also, over time it became harder to hit my Friday target, as, among other reasons, I learned that Netflix apparently shuttered its nearby Tacoma distribution center, meaning discs took longer to arrive from such far-flung locales as San Jose, California, and Coppell, Texas.\n\nAnd now we arrive at the end of this year and of this project, which continued even after the conditions of my employment (but not of my dubiously essential status, as it were) changed at the end of October. Time will tell how many of these titles — some more watchable than others for any number of reasons, not the least of which being Ms. Binoche’s screen time — I will return to. That said, there are a great many favorites among them — including The English Patient (Minghella, 1996), Chocolat (Hallström, 2000), and Clouds of Sils Maria (Assayas, 2014) — that are likely to reappear in the 2021 edition of this feature.\n\nAs always, presented here are only the feature films (and one short, by Bong Joon Ho) that I viewed in their entirety in theaters (though there were only two such screenings this year), on DVD or Blu-ray, or on subscription streaming services (The Criterion Channel, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, iTunes, and the public-library affiliate Kanopy); any film I saw on broadcast or cable television (edited, reformatted, with commercial interruptions, etc.) is excluded from this listing.\n\n* theatrical exhibition\n\n+ repeat viewing this calendar year\n\n¹ first time ever\n\nb starring or featuring Juliette Binoche\n\nJanuary (16)\n\n1 Mulholland Dr. (Lynch, 2001) 4 Rendez-vous (Téchiné, 1985) b ¹ 4 The League of Gentlemen (Dearden, 1960) ¹ 5 Sorry, Wrong Number (Litvak, 1948) ¹ 7 Little Women (Gerwig, 2019) * ¹ 11 The Hustler (Rossen, 1961) 12 Mauvais Sang (Carax, 1986) b ¹ 14 Just Another Girl on the I.R.T.

It doesn’t promise to be any easier to navigate than 2020, but whatever your circumstances, I hope you find your own bourbon/tater tots/Binoche with which to endure them.\n\nBe well, friends.\n\nMy prolific filmgoing and -viewing in 2018 resulted from a perfect storm of factors and influences, chief among them my subscriptions to MoviePass and FilmStruck (and, by extension, to Fandor and the Criterion Channel, respectively) and an abundance of spare time due to my continued unemployment. For a relative pittance, the world of cinema unfurled before me as it never had, and I took full advantage of its offerings.\n\nI have a Letterboxd profile, but I haven’t updated it since I saw the Key and Peele action comedy Keanu on May 5, 2016, as its regular emails remind me. Perhaps someday, in a fit of administrative pique, I’ll make a project of entering all these films, on my way toward being a more faithful updater of my timeline there.\n\nIn many ways, though, this feels like a more interesting accounting of my viewing, because it looks more like a roadmap or a journey in film. I can track larger trends, like my reconsideration of Paul Thomas Anderson’s oeuvre or an urgent desire to gaze upon Juliette Binoche for hours upon end, or pick out the smaller, subtler moves, like how I went straight home after Joe Wright’s Darkest Hour to watch his Atonement for a Dunkirk doubleheader (and then saw Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk later that month), or how a screening of the Argentine crime film Nine Queens led to my pushing its American remake, Criminal, up in my queue to screen 11 days later.\n\nPresented here are only the feature films that I saw in theaters, on DVD or Blu-ray, or on subscription streaming services (the aforementioned, as well as Netflix, Hulu and the public-library affiliate Kanopy); any film I saw on broadcast or cable television, edited (or even — gasp! — reformatted), with commercial interruptions — like, say, NBC’s presentation of Jurassic Park or Lifetime’s airing of Secretariat — is excluded from this listing.\n\n* theatrical exhibition\n\n+ repeat viewing this calendar year\n\nJanuary (49)\n\n1 Ant-Man (Reed, 2015) 1 All the Money in the World (Scott, 2017) * 2 The Way of the Gun (McQuarrie, 2000) 4 Darkest Hour (Wright, 2017) * 4 Atonement (Wright, 2007) 5 Molly’s Game (Sorkin, 2017) * 5 The Paper (Howard, 1994) 5 Good Night, and Good Luck (Clooney, 2005) 7 Good Night, and Good Luck commentary (Clooney, Heslov) 7 Notorious (Hitchcock, 1946) 8 The Shape of Water (Del Toro, 2017) * 8 Enemy at the Gates (Annaud, 2001) 9 North by Northwest (Hitchcock, 1959) 10 The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S.

The shorts are not listed here, but all told Fandor streams about 20 works by Hartley.\n\n15 My Beautiful Laundrette (Frears, 1985) 16 I Am Not Your Negro (Peck, 2016) 16 The Unbelievable Truth (Hartley, 1989) 17 Trust (Hartley, 1990) 18 Surviving Desire (Hartley, 1992) 19 The Fallen Idol (Reed, 1948) 20 Phantom Thread (Anderson, 2017) * 20 Rebecca (Hitchcock, 1940) 21 Streets of Fire (Hill, 1984) 21 Must Love Dogs (Goldberg, 2005) 22 Nothing Sacred (Wellman, 1937) 23 Call Me By Your Name (Guadagnino, 2017) * 23 Mudbound (Rees, 2017) 24 Proud Mary (Najafi, 2018) * 26 I Confess (Hitchcock, 1953) 26 Hostiles (Cooper, 2017) * 26 Office Christmas Party (Gordon/Speck, 2016) 26 Becoming Cary Grant (Kidel, 2017) 27 The Game (Fincher, 1997) 28 Secret in Their Eyes (Ray, 2015) 28 The Florida Project (Baker, 2017) * 28 Psycho (Hitchcock, 1960) * 28 The Birds (Hitchcock, 1963) * 30 Dunkirk (Nolan, 2017) * 30 Mood Indigo (Gondry, 2013) 30 Farewell, My Lovely (Richards, 1975) 31 The Disaster Artist (Franco, 2017) *\n\nFebruary (23)\n\n1 The Wrong Man (Hitchcock, 1956) 2 The Post (Spielberg, 2017) * 2 All the President’s Men (Pakula, 1976) 3 Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (McDonagh, 2017) * 3 Stage Fright (Hitchcock, 1950) 3 Punch-Drunk Love (Anderson, 2002) 4 The Cloverfield Paradox (Onah, 2018) 5 Moonstruck (Jewison, 1987) 6 Coco (Unkrich, 2017) * 6 Super 8 (Abrams, 2011) 6 The Illusionist (Burger, 2006) 8 The Shape of Water (Del Toro, 2017) * + 9 War for the Planet of the Apes (Reeves, 2017)\n\nThis gap of six days between movies was precipitated by the first week of the 2018 Olympic Winter Games in PyeongChang, South Korea, after which I recalibrated toward a more equitable balance of my dual nature as sports fan and movie junkie. This will be a recurring theme in the months to come.\n\n15 Simple Men (Hartley, 1992) 16 Black Panther (Coogler, 2018) 17 Sudden Manhattan (Shelly, 1996) 17 Micmacs (Jeunet, 2009) 18 My Family (Nava, 1995) 21 The Philadelphia Story (Cukor, 1940) * 23 Game Night (Daley/Goldstein, 2018) * 24 Grand Illusion (Renoir, 1937) 25 Annihilation (Garland, 2018) * 27 The Master (Anderson, 2012)\n\nMarch (18)\n\nThe even lighter month of March can of course be explained by college basketball. My Kansas Jayhawks are perennially in the thick of March Madness, but during this month every year I love even the lowliest midmajors and surprise qualifiers and cheer every upset-in-the-making. Christmas is overrated; March Madness is truly the most wonderful time of the year, even if it means I don’t make it to the movies that often.\n\n2 Black Panther (Coogler, 2018) * + 7 Red Sparrow (Lawrence, 2018) * 9 Gringo (Edgerton, 2018) * 9 Boogie Nights (Anderson, 1997) 12 Magnolia (Anderson, 1997) 16 Strangers on a Train (Hitchcock, 1951) 19 Tomb Raider (Uthaug, 2018) * 19 Hard Eight (Anderson, 1996) 20 Love, Simon (Berlanti, 2018) * 20 Creature from the Black Lagoon (Arnold, 1954) 22 Forgetting Sarah Marshall (Stoller, 2008) 23 Dog Day Afternoon (Lumet, 1975) 26 The French Connection (Friedkin, 1971) 27 Network (Lumet, 1976) 28 Unsane (Soderbergh, 2018) * 28 There Will Be Blood (Anderson, 2007) 29 42 (Helgeland, 2013) 31 Dog Day Afternoon commentary (Lumet)\n\nApril (21)\n\nAs college-hoops season winds down, a new Major League Baseball season is just underway, which would explain why I experienced only a very slight uptick in movie viewing this month. I was unusually (though admirably, I think) devoted to my Kansas City Royals on their way to 104 losses and would watch all but a few of their 162 games this season.\n\n3 Ready Player One (Spielberg, 2018) * 6 Isle of Dogs (Anderson, 2018) * 7 A Quiet Place (Krasinski, 2018) * 8 Bringing Up Baby (Hawks, 1938) 8 My Man Godfrey (La Cava, 1936) 11 The Big Heat (Lang, 1953) 13 Isle of Dogs (Anderson, 2018) * + 13 The Lady Eve (Sturges, 1941) 14 Chappaquiddick (Curran, 2017) * 17 In a Lonely Place (Ray, 1950) 18 Michael Clayton (Gilroy, 2007) 19 Crossfire (Dmytryk, 1947) 21 The Lady Eve (Sturges, 1941) + 22 The Friends of Eddie Coyle (Yates, 1973) 23 Super Troopers 2 (Chandrasekhar, 2018) * 25 Film Stars Don’t Die in Liverpool (McGuigan, 2017) 27 Avengers: Infinity War (Russo/Russo, 2018) *\n\nI have no good explanation for why I waited as long as I did to subscribe to FilmStruck, and now that it’s gone I’m kicking myself over all that lost time. Any affinity I have for stringing together double features or theme nights or retrospectives had now been super-sized by such FilmStruck features as the director and star of the week. In a quirk of exquisite timing, the first two directors featured after I subscribed, one right after the next, were David Lean and Billy Wilder. My first order of business, however, was to screen all six Thin Man movies, starring William Powell and Myrna Loy, during my first week.\n\n29 Mister Roberts (Ford/LeRoy, 1955) 29 The Thin Man (Van Dyke, 1934) 29 After the Thin Man (Van Dyke, 1936) 30 Another Thin Man (Van Dyke, 1939)\n\nMay (42)\n\n1 Shadow of the Thin Man (Van Dyke, 1941) 2 Die Hard (McTiernan, 1988) 2 The Thin Man Goes Home (Thorpe, 1945) 4 Song of the Thin Man (Buzzell, 1947) 6 Foreign Correspondent (Hitchcock, 1940) 6 In Which We Serve (Coward/Lean, 1942) 7 Westworld (Crichton, 1973) 8 The Passionate Friends (Lean, 1949) 9 Tully (Reitman, 2018) * 9 Lawrence of Arabia (Lean, 1962) 10 The Equalizer (Fuqua, 2014) 11 Blithe Spirit (Lean, 1945) 11 Unstoppable (Scott, 2010) 12 The Sound Barrier (Lean, 1952) 14 Crimson Tide (Scott, 1995) 15 Iron Man 3 (Black, 2013) 15 Spider-Man: Homecoming (Watts, 2017) 16 Madeleine (Lean, 1950) 16 Iron Man 3 commentary (Black/Pearce) 17 Summertime (Lean, 1955) 17 Nostromo: David Lean’s Impossible Dream (Bermúdez, 2017) 17 Tequila Sunrise (Towne, 1988) 18 Deadpool 2 (Leitch, 2018) * 18 A Passage to India (Lean, 1984) 19 Joe Versus the Volcano (Shanley, 1990) 20 Angels in America: Millennium Approaches (Nichols, 2003) 21 Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold (Dunne, 2017) 22 Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story (Dean, 2017) 22 The Spirit of St. Louis (Wilder, 1957) 23 Band of Outsiders (Godard, 1964) 23 Angels in America: Perestroika (Nichols, 2003) 24 To Have and Have Not (Hawks, 1944) 25 Solo: A Star Wars Story (Howard, 2018) * 25 Dark Passage (Daves, 1947) 25 Key Largo (Huston, 1948) 26 The Big Sleep (Hawks, 1946) 27 Eight Men Out (Sayles, 1988) 27 Stagecoach (Ford, 1939) 29 The Maltese Falcon (Huston, 1941) 30 A Night at the Opera (Wood, 1935) 30 Harper (Smight, 1966) 31 Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (Conran, 2004)\n\nJune (38)\n\n1 Let the Sunshine In (Denis, 2017) * 2 Dollars (Brooks, 1971) 2 Ocean’s Eleven (Soderbergh, 2001) 3 Inside Man (Lee, 2006) 5 The Late Show (Benton, 1977) 6 Small Town Crime (Nelms/Nelms, 2017) 7 The Brothers Bloom (Johnson, 2008) 8 Ocean’s Eight (Ross, 2018) * 8 Haywire (Soderbergh, 2012) 9 Atomic Blonde (Leitch, 2017) 9 Anon (Niccol, 2018) 11 Hotel Artemis (Pearce, 2018) * 11 The Asphalt Jungle (Huston, 1950) 13 Nine Queens (Bielinsky, 2000) 15 Incredibles 2 (Bird, 2018) * 15 The Incredibles (Bird, 2004) 15 Atomic Blonde (Leitch, 2017) + 17 Ninotchka (Lubitsch, 1939) 17 Always (Spielberg, 1989) 18 A Farewell to Arms (Borzage, 1932) 19 History Is Made at Night (Borzage, 1937) 19 Body Heat (Kasdan, 1981) 20 Tag (Tomsic, 2018) * 20 Words and Pictures (Schepisi, 2013) 21 The Wolfman (Johnston, 2010) 21 Clouds of Sils Maria (Assayas, 2014)\n\nOf course, June 22 is Mr. Wilder’s birthday, which this year FilmStruck permitted me to celebrate with a full daylong program, whereas in other years I typically screen either Some Like It Hot or The Apartment in the evening. I.A.L. Diamond’s birthday is a mere five days later, so I usually alternate those or opt for The Fortune Cookie, among the films I own on DVD.\n\n22 Sunset Boulevard (Wilder, 1950) 22 Ace in the Hole (Wilder, 1951) 22 Stalag 17 (Wilder, 1953) 22 Witness for the Prosecution (Wilder, 1957) 22 Love in the Afternoon (Wilder, 1957) 23 Some Like It Hot (Wilder, 1959) 24 Summer Hours (Assayas, 2008) 24 Criminal (Jacobs, 2004) 25 L’attesa (Messina, 2015) 26 Blackhat (Mann, 2015) 28 The Apartment (Wilder, 1960) 29 Double Indemnity (Wilder, 1944)\n\nJuly (43)\n\n2 Sweet Smell of Success (Mackendrick, 1957) 2 Mildred Pierce (Curtiz, 1949) 3 His Girl Friday (Hawks, 1939) 4 Jaws (Spielberg, 1975) 4 The Missing Person (Buschel, 2010) 5 Double Indemnity commentary (Dobbs/Redman) 5 Swordfish (Sena, 2001) 6 Ball of Fire (Hawks, 1941) 7 Juliet of the Spirits (Fellini, 1965) 8 Seven Days in May (Frankenheimer, 1964) 8 Thieves’ Highway (Dassin, 1949) 10 Captain Phillips (Greengrass, 2013) 11 A Few Days in September (Amigorena, 2006) 11 Chocolat (Hallstrom, 2000) 12 Ant-Man and the Wasp (Reed, 2018) * 13 Sorry to Bother You (Riley, 2018) * 13 The Big Easy (McBride, 1986) 13 Surviving Desire (Hartley, 1992) + 14 Desperately Seeking Susan (Seidelman, 1985) 14 Shock and Awe (Reiner, 2018) * 14 Sully (Eastwood, 2016) 14 The Silent Partner (Duke, 1978) 15 Cloud Atlas (Tykwer/Wachowski/Wachowski, 2012) 16 The Women (Cukor, 1939) 17 Sicario: Day of the Soldado (Sollima, 2018) * 18 Skyscraper (Thurber, 2018) * 19 Traffic (Soderbergh, 2000) 20 Leave No Trace (Granik, 2018) * 20 Midnight Run (Brest, 1988) 21 JFK (Director’s Cut) (Stone, 1991) 22 The Equalizer 2 (Fuqua, 2018) * 22 Choose Me (Rudolph, 1984) 22 Love at Large (Rudolph, 1990) 23 Laggies (Shelton, 2014) 24 The Lost World: Jurassic Park (Spielberg, 1997) 25 Gaslight (Cukor, 1944) 26 Mission: Impossible – Fallout (McQuarrie, 2018) * 27 Rules Don’t Apply (Beatty, 2016) 28 Out of the Past (Tourneur, 1947) 28 Hitchcock/Truffaut (Jones, 2015) 29 Wonderstruck (Haynes, 2017) 30 His Kind of Woman (Farrow, 1951) 31 The Seventh Seal (Bergman, 1957)\n\nAugust (33)\n\n1 Stop Making Sense (Demme, 1984) 2 Libeled Lady (Conway, 1936) 4 American Made (Liman, 2017) 5 Lawrence of Arabia (Lean, 1962) + 7 Thoroughbreds (Finley, 2017) 8 Eighth Grade (Burnham, 2018) * 9 Arsenic and Old Lace (Capra, 1944) 10 Nights of Cabiria (Fellini, 1957) 11 Paddington (King, 2014) 11 Paddington 2 (King, 2017) 11 All That Jazz (Fosse, 1979) 12 2010 (Hyams, 1984) 15 Outland (Hyams, 1981) 17 The Postman Always Rings Twice (Garnett, 1946) 18 Inception (Nolan, 2010) 19 The Party (Potter, 2017) 20 The Great Race (Edwards, 1965) 21 The Prestige (Nolan, 2006) 21 The In-Laws (Hiller, 1979) 23 Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (Cimino, 1974) 24 Gunga Din (Stevens, 1939) 25 The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer (Reis, 1947) 26 Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House (Potter, 1948) 26 The Goodbye Girl (Ross, 1977) 26 The Sunshine Boys (Ross, 1975) 27 Eraser (Russell, 1996) 27 Narrow Margin (Hyams, 1998) 28 Persona (Bergman, 1966) 29 Mile 22 (Berg, 2018) * 29 RBG (Cohen/West, 2018) 30 Chinatown (Polanski, 1974) 30 The Two Jakes (Nicholson, 1990) 31 Operation Finale (Weitz, 2018) *\n\nSeptember (26)\n\n3 BlacKkKlansman (Lee, 2018) * 3 First Reformed (Schrader, 2017) 3 Moneyball (Miller, 2011) 4 First Reformed commentary (Schrader) 5 Adam’s Rib (Cukor, 1949) 7 Brick (Johnson, 2005) 8 Vertigo (Hitchcock, 1958 – 70mm) *\n\nLawrence of Arabia is my favorite movie of all time, but 2018 might actually mark the first time I’ve ever watched it as many as three times in a calendar year — in this case once on FilmStruck; once on DVD (on my birthday, when I went out for a steak dinner then came home to drink whiskey on the balcony during the overture, before the feature attraction); and now on the big screen at Cinerama’s annual 70mm Festival, the way God and Sir David Lean intended it to be seen.\n\n9 Lawrence of Arabia (Lean, 1962 – 70mm) * + 10 Kong: Skull Island (Vogt-Roberts, 2017) 11 The Misfits (Huston, 1961) 12 Juliet, Naked (Peretz, 2018) * 12 The Shop Around the Corner (Lubitsch, 1940) 14 Vertigo (Hitchcock, 1958) + 15 The Man Between (Reed, 1953) 16 My Favorite Wife (Kanin, 1940) 18 A Simple Favor (Feig, 2018) * 18 Won’t You Be My Neighbor?

Instead, as time ebbed away from me, I found myself just as often paring my watchlist down to account for movies I’d have access to on other platforms or media.\n\nBy FilmStruck’s last week I had made a run at Sam Peckinpah, whom it added as one of its last directors of the week, and watched a few films starring my favorite Frenchman, Jean Gabin. By the final day my list was down to about 15 films, seven of which I managed to watch during my daylong vigil, five of which I had never seen before.\n\nI chose a repeat viewing of Certified Copy as my last film of the day because — and I believe Count Almásy would back me up on this — Juliette Binoche’s face tops the short list of Last Things to See As the Lights Go Out. But either FilmStruck interpreted “midnight” very loosely or they meant midnight in either the Alaska or Hawaii time zone; in any event, I was able to watch to the end.\n\n29 The Hidden Fortress (Kurosawa, 1958) 29 Pickpocket (Bresson, 1959) 29 Black Narcissus (Powell/Pressburger, 1947) 29 Heaven Can Wait (Lubitsch, 1943) 29 The Front Page (Milestone, 1931) 29 The Red Shoes (Powell/Pressburger, 1948) 29 Certified Copy (Kiarostami, 2010) 30 Bel Canto (Weitz, 2018)\n\nDecember (25)\n\n2 Marwencol (Malmberg, 2010) 3 The Song of Lunch (MacCormick, 2010) 3 Hail, Caesar! (Coen, 2016) 4 Madeline’s Madeline (Decker, 2018) 5 De Palma (Baumbach/Paltrow, 2015) 6 Roma (Cuarón, 2018) * 7 Hearts Beat Loud (Haley, 2018) 10 O Brother, Where Art Thou? (Coen, 2000) 10 Love & Mercy (Pohlad, 2014) 11 Barton Fink (Coen, 1991) 11 Zero Effect (Kasdan, 1998) 12 Isle of Dogs (Anderson, 2018) +\n\nI shouldn’t complain about MoviePass, because in the final accounting my subscription enabled me to see 46 films in theaters at a cost of roughly $1.95 per screening. But by the time I MoviePassed my last movie of the year — a 9:55 a.m. screening of Steve McQueen’s Widows, nearly two full months after I MoviePassed Damien Chazelle’s First Man — the service had become infuriating in its inability to offer even a single eligible screening on any given day. (On one occasion, a film vanished from the app in the 15 minutes it took me to drive to the theater.)\n\nClearly, as the year waned, MoviePass was reduced to shilling its platform and mailing list to any advertising partner who could prop it up and pay down its debts while providing ever-diminishing returns to its paid subscribers. And truth be told, I hadn’t minded any of the individual restrictions it began to place on subscribers earlier in the year when it became clear it was hemorrhaging money, but it’s staggering that the powers that be possessed so little vision as to think they could offer subscribers virtually unlimited moviegoing without enacting some of those reasonable restrictions from the get-go.\n\nHaving flown too close to the sun, MoviePass ultimately alienated a subscriber base that now has no incentive to renew unless its updated subscription tiers offer a more viable model at those price points. Otherwise, it was nice while it lasted.\n\n14 Widows (McQueen, 2018) * 14 Gravity (Cuarón, 2013) 14 Roma (Cuarón, 2018) + 15 The Book of Life (Hartley, 1998) 15 The Man Who Wasn’t There (Coen, 2001) 16 Carol (Haynes, 2015) 17 A Beautiful Mind (Howard, 2001) 25 Some Like It Hot (Wilder, 1959) + 26 Instant Family (Anders, 2018) * 27 Murder, My Sweet (Dmytryk, 1944) 30 The Tall Target (Mann, 1951) 31 Choke (Gregg, 2008) 31 Another Thin Man (Van Dyke, 1939) +\n\nAnd then we came to the end.\n\nI traveled home for the holidays, so my viewing mostly trailed off in the final two weeks, except for movies on TV (interrupted by an onslaught of commercial breaks in both number and volume that posed the most compelling case yet for my never again subscribing to cable).\n\nAll told, I watched 390 films in 2018 — 16 of which were repeat viewings this year; six of which were commentary tracks (which I’m not counting as repeat viewings for this list); 205 for the first time; 65 in theaters. Just over a film a day but just shy of that elusive 400 that would have felt like a first-ballot invitation to Cooperstown. It will be embarrassing to witness how short of that number I fall in 2019, but it won’t be for a lack of trying or a dearth of love for cinema."
