        "text": "Police-themed action movies issued forth like a flood in the 1980s, and it’s hard to find any of them that don’t owe at least a little something to Dirty Harry. Essentially an attempt to transfer Clint Eastwood’s steely persona honed via his work in Westerns into a modern-day San Francisco context, at their best the movies were controversial for all the right reasons – raising questions about police brutality and the rule of law which, despite knee-jerk reactions in some quarters, the movies were handling with more nuance and less simplistically than they were given credit for. At worst, they replicated the worst excesses of their imitators. How did they lose their way? Let’s see if we can find out.\n\nDirty Harry\n\nGive the original Dirty Harry this much: it’s not at all coy about where it’s coming from, displaying its colours on its sleeve when at the beginning it shows a memorial to San Francisco police department officers killed in the line of duty, effectively dedicating the film to them.\n\nFrom that opening shot we fade in to our antagonist – Scorpio (Andy Robinson), a character inspired by the Zodiac Killer’s apparently random murders and his taunting of police. Scorpio uses a silenced sniper rifle to observe a random woman in a rooftop pool; after leching over her through the scope, he shoots her dead for the sheer fun of it. Cut to “Dirty” Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) arriving on the crims scene, sussing out where the sniper’s nest must have been, and getting down to some hard-edged police work with a funk soundtrack…\n\nThe original Dirty Harry is an interesting watch; whilst the music makes it clearly a 1970s period piece, its frenetic pace feels much more like the 1980s police action movies which would show its influence. At the same time, in parroting the movie’s talking points, those films often ended up pushing a worldview which fails to take into account the specific events the movie is responding to.\n\nLike I said, Scorpio is very obviously a riff on the Zodiac Killer – the mocking note Harry finds in the sniper’s nest even strikes a similar tone to the Zodiac’s infamous missives. Police-themed action movies all too often involve scepticism of the effectiveness of “the System” and a desire to allow police to be a bit more ruthless in their methods for the sake of public safety – often vacillating incoherently between an authoritarian attitude which believes that the police should have more powers to enforce the law and a more libertarian attitude which believes that the police should be subject to less oversight and regulation and allowed to just act as vigilantes.\n\nThere’s whiffs of this in the original Dirty Harry, but the context makes this question much less trite and obviously misguided than it is when less thoughtful movies tackle it. With California still reeling in the wake of the Zodiac murders, it’s completely understandable that confidence in the police would be rocked – after all, they seemed entirely powerless to stop those killings.\n\nI suspect that, as is often the case, if you go back and do the research you’d probably find as much evidence of the police not making effective use of the powers and resources they already have as opposed to them lacking powers which they could have used to track down the Zodiac if only they’d been able to use them, but this wouldn’t necessarily have been evident at the time.\n\nHarry is also less of a hyperviolent loose cannon (at least in this original movie) than many characters inspired by him would be. For instance, when he discerns that there’s a potential bank robbery going he calmly goes into his favourite local hot dog joint and gets the owner to call it in, and then sits back to observe to allow backup to arrive – he doesn’t go in guns blazing immediately, nor should he if there’s a smoother way to handle it.\n\nHe only charges in when the bank’s alarm kicks off and gunshots are heard, indicating that the robbery has turned nasty and lives need saving. The iconic “do you feel lucky?” scene, which is so often invoked as a valorisation of violence, is in fact Harry talking a guy down from attempting further violence, and resolving a situation through smarts and talking rather than defaulting to violence as his only tool.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that the violence in this movie isn’t visceral and terrifying. The scary thing about the violence in this sequence is that, even though it’s a tremendously bloody scene, when you sit back and think through what’s happened Harry has actually just used using the bare minimum of violence needed to stop people blasting off shotguns at civilians; it’s just that director Don Siegel realises that the “bare minimum” of violence in any particular situation is still ugly as hell.\n\nLikewise, in this movie Harry isn’t as keen to abuse his power or act as though he has the untouchable right to do whatever without scrutiny as many future movie cops would be. When he’s caught peeping in on someone he and his rookie partner Chico Gonzalez (Reni Santoni) thought matched the suspect description and is beaten up a bit by a mob of outraged locals, he makes Chico let the people in question go because he realises he looked as guilty as hell up there and they had good reason to intervene.\n\nClumsy endorsements of vigilantism generally allow the vigilantes to be held above the law and immune from scrutiny, but Harry isn’t a vigilante; despite his annoyance with some aspects of the system, at the end of the day he does believe in holding himself accountable, at least in my reading. One legitimate interpretation of him throwing his badge away at the end of the movie is that he’s concluded that in his extrajudicial execution of the Scorpio killer – even though it was in the context of a cat-and-mouse duel between the two – has placed Harry outside the bounds within which a police officer must walk and he realises he can’t be an officer any more. (The fact that he is still an officer in the sequels rather undermines this, of course.)\n\nOne of the nastiest things Harry does here is the bit where he ignores Scorpio’s pleas for a lawyer and stomps on his wounded leg to find out where the Scorpio has buried someone alive. It’s one of those “you need to use torture in a situation where the time bomb is ticking!” scenarios which people who advocate the use of torture love to come up with, and having Harry do it is an unappealing feature of the movie, but the script saves it by the fact that the torture ultimately doesn’t achieve anything: the girl is already dead, and it turns out that asking people questions under torture based on information they gave you in bad faith anyway before you tortured them gets you nowhere.\n\nThis error on Harry’s part also contributes to the Scorpio getting back out onto the street. There’s a mild departure from reality in a ruling that a search performed by Harry was illegal – any prosecutor worth their salt would lean on probable cause/exigent circumstances as hard as they possibly could when a hostage situation is on the line, and whilst it is true that police blunders and failure to get a warrant can put a really good suspect back on the street, in this case the point is stretched.\n\nEven then, the fact is that in this case as in reality a bad person ends up back on the street not because of “the system” but because a police officer went across the line, particularly with the torture angle. This plays into the really difficult question that Dirty Harry asks, which is this: how the hell is a law-abiding, rules-observing society is supposed to react to someone who is acting in utterly bad faith, and will exploit all the rules and laws of that society in the process of acting in bad faith?\n\nEach time Harry or the authorities choose to engage with Scorpio’s games in the movie turns out to be a mistake: it just encourages him to escalate. Going back to Harry tossing away his badge at the end, a similarly legitimate reading could be that this is Harry passing judgement on himself for engaging Scorpio in his gaslighting and manipulation to this extent in the first place.\n\nIn presenting the notion that there are people who will evoke their legal rights in bad faith, even as they show no regard for anyone else’s, the movie does leave itself open to the awful interpretation that speak of legal rights is just a means for people to shield themselves from what’s coming to them – but binds like this one is why we decide cases with judges and juries, not making rush decisions on the spot. The notion that the police should feel free to override our rights if they become inconvenient, whilst not something I think is the movie’s intention, is at the same time a reading it doesn’t quite do the legwork to close off, and there is where it’s most problematic in my mind.\n\nThe handling of race has dated poorly too. When Chico Gonzalez is introduced as Harry’s new partner, the movie wants us to ask whether Harry’s racist (and the fact that it’s open to this possibility suggests that it’s not as unswervingly pro-police as it’s been interpreted). That said, all the objections Harry voices are about Chico’s college background and his lack of experience, particularly compared to more hardened partners of Harry’s (who still have tendency to get hurt or killed), but then when a fellow cop declares that Harry hates all classes of people Harry says “especially spics” – but with a wink. These days, that comes across as Harry just plain being racist – why would you make such a joke in the first place? – but I suspect at the time the reading would have been different, Harry making light of it and winking as a means to indicate that he’s bullshitting.\n\nIn the very next scene we see Scorpio selecting a new target, isolating a flamboyantly effeminate black man out for a stroll with a gentleman who, based on their body language, is evidently his partner as a particularly apt pick, highlighting that Scorpio at his heart shares more or less the same range of bigotries as the police department. (Further parallels – boss asks Harry when he’s going to cut his hair, when we next see Scorpio we get the first really good look at his hair, which is longer and wilder than Harry’s.)\n\nAndy Robinson’s performance as Scorpio is perhaps one of the most powerful aspects of the film. At points he just needs to use a bit of body language to communicate how Scorpio carries himself with an air of methodical efficiency when things are going his way and then flips to wild desperation when things are slipping out of his control. His facial expressions are also great; when he’s thwarted, he looks like an enraged demon, when he’s pleased with something he looks like a gloating god, when he’s scared he looks like a whimpering peasant. The overall effect is to present Scorpio as someone who is struggling with both an oppressive sense of powerlessness and a pathological sense of godlike power – said power he attempts to assert and make concrete through his activities. You could do a psychological profile on him based on his face alone.\n\nRobinson’s most terrifying moment in the movie is the infamous school bus hijack, inspired by the Zodiac’s threats against school buses (which the real Zodiac thankfully never carried out). The creepy thing about the scene is how at first the kids don’t realise at first the danger they’re in, and are happy to singalong with Scorpio at his bidding, and then the tension ramps up further and further as the kids start getting upset and Scorpio starts yelling threats against them and their loved ones in between forcing them to sing.\n\nThe combination of Robinson’s performance and what we know of the Zodiac’s actual activities make Scorpio a horrifyingly plausible monster, and without that plausibility the movie would be much more unpalatable than it otherwise is. In order to ask the questions it wants to ask about the rule of law, it needs to remind us that not everyone who breaks the law does so because they were forced into it or because they had no opportunity to do otherwise – that even if we could deal with all the socioeconomic factors which make crime worse, we cannot 100% eliminate the existence of people who just want to cause harm to others because they get off on it. And it needs to ask us how far we’d be willing to let the rules be bent to keep us safe – and whether, in allowing those rules to be bent, we endanger ourselves precisely because we allowed the rights all of us rely on to be weakened.\n\nDirty Harry attempts to ask those questions, and whilst it doesn’t necessarily succeed absolutely in all respects, or come to conclusions I’d agree with, it does so with a bit more intelligence than many give it credit for. I wish that this were true of its imitators.\n\nMagnum Force\n\nThis Ted Post-directed sequel was written by John Milius and Michael Cimino; Milius had made uncredited contributions to the original Dirty Harry script, whilst Cimino would impress Clint Eastwood enough with his work on Magnum Force that he’d take on Cimino’s Thunderbolt and Lightfoot script as his next project, and gave Cimino his big break as a director on that.\n\nOne gets the sense here that Milius – who, based on material like Red Dawn, you get the impression isn’t exactly a pacifist – was nonetheless disturbed by some of the critical responses to Dirty Harry, in particular those who derided it as an advertisement for police vigilantism – or, perhaps even more frighteningly, those who applauded it for the exact same reason. The story of Magnum Force is, in essence, a response to this – a firm statement that no, actually, vigilante cops with a penchant for excess violence and sharp shooting who take the law into their own hands are villains, not heroes.\n\nSpecifically, the story pitches Harry against a group of rogue cops who share Harry’s weariness with the System but, unlike Harry, decide to put themselves outside it entirely. The movie begins with mob boss Carmine Ricca (Richard Devon) walking out of court, having beaten a murder rap on a technicality – exactly the sort of scenario that Dirty Harry’s imitators would frequently use to set up a character like Ricca as the villain. Only the thing is, Ricca doesn’t get home to do any villainy – the car which he and his driver are riding back to the San Francisco Mafia branch office in is stopped by a traffic cop, who wastes little time in cold-bloodedly massacring everyone in the car.\n\nHarry, after the Scorpio case, has a new partner in the form of Early Smith (Felton Perry) and has been reassigned to the stakeout squad. It isn’t long, however, before the unsanctioned death squad’s activities force Lt. Briggs (Hal Holbrook) to summon Harry and Early back to Homicide. Meanwhile, Harry has become increasingly concerned about his old friend Charlie McCoy (Mitchell Ryan), whose violent rhetoric and increasingly erratic tendencies are a dangerous combination in an active-duty police officer.\n\nThe police department are convinced that the killings merely represent a gang war being prosecuted by someone pretending to be a cop – but the physical evidence, coupled with Charlie’s odd behaviour forces Harry to consider that the killer may be much closer to the police department than the brass would like to believe. When Charlie is killed by one of the death squad members, Harry has to revise his theory – and perhaps pay a little more attention to a certain close-knit clique of rookie traffic cops, recruited to the force fresh out of combat duty in Vietnam…\n\nOne of the ideas the movie needs to get across is the concept that everyone’s rights matter, even the rights of people who have done astonishingly shitty things, and the shittiness of those things is not a reason to go extrajudicial on them. For instance, it introduces us to a pimp character played by Albert Popwell in a sequence in which he brutally murders one of his prostitutes (unnamed, played by Margaret Avery); a mere scene later, he’s killed by one of the traffic cop vigilantes. The prostitute murder sequence is kind of distasteful, not least because it feels like a mean-spirited blaxploitation pastiche with a misogynistic edge to it, but Popwell pulls off a fantastic performance with the way he makes us vehemently despise his character one moment, and then the very next humanises him and makes us empathise with him in the instant of his death. (Popwell had an uncredited role as the bank robber who gets the “Do you feel lucky, punk?” speech directed at him in the original Dirty Harry.)\n\nOne it sets this up, the movie then has to set Harry against the vigilante team and enunciate a moral difference between them. The main thesis is delivered by Harry in the line “I hate the goddamn system, but until someone comes along with some changes that make sense I’ll stick with it”. A further answer is given in a line which Harry keeps saying to Briggs over the course of the film, “a man has to know his limitations”.\n\nThe point there is that Harry might break the law, but he doesn’t put himself above the law – he faces the consequences of his actions and doesn’t try to deny them or distance himself from what he’s done. The vigilantes here, conversely, have put themselves above the law, passing death sentences arbitrarily without submitting to any sort of accountability. Harry might sympathise with their goals (“Nothing wrong with shooting, so long as the right people get shot”), but it’s the fact that he allows himself to be held accountable by the system, even when he disagrees with it, that saves him from becoming a monster just as bad as they are.\n\nMoreover, even though he does leave behind a bit of a body trail the fact is that Harry doesn’t actually shoot at people who aren’t in the process of putting him or others in danger, whereas the death squad’s tactics are outright sickening, extending to firing off an SMG at a mobster’s family pool party, exterminating innocent and guilty alike. The fact that the renegade cops are Vietnam veterans applying the tactics they learned in war in the domestic sphere also works in concerns about militarisation of policing, and the incompatibility between the ethos of public service an ethical police force should foster and the type of killing a generation of young men had been trained to do in Vietnam.\n\nWhen it isn’t concentrating on these questions, the script feels to a certain extent like a rehash of the techniques of first film, with a little extra dose of unreality – Harry gets a random sex interest (their interactions are too single-minded and narrowly focused to really be a love interest) who doesn’t really add anything to the plot, and the little side adventures he has alongside the main investigation are a bit less glumly realistic than those in the first film. (There’s a bit where Harry infiltrates and foils a plane hijacking a la Police Quest II, for instance, which even the film acknowledges is really the FBI’s job.) Still, it’s nice that Harry comes across as less racist this time – he makes not a single race-based joke.\n\nThe direction by Ted Post largely makes the best of the script. When the killings are going down the film makes a lot of hay out of just how intimidating US cop uniforms can be, which is a pretty subversive move considering that it wasn’t that long since Hollywood was still bound by the Hays Code, which would mitigate against symbols of authority being used like that.\n\nA substantial part of the conclusion involves running around in the dingy dark shooting at each other, in an apparent lift from the end of The French Connection. That said, I’d say the best shootout in the film – perhaps the best one in the series – is earlier in the movie, when Harry and his colleagues are ordered to serve a warrant on organised crime boss Frank Palancio (Tony Giorgio) – who’s received an anonymous tipoff to expect rival mob assassins disguised as cops. What follows is one of the most ruthless bloodbaths depicted in a cop film up to that point.\n\nThe Enforcer\n\nThis resulted out of a mix of two different scripts; Gail Morgan Hickman and S.W. Schurr, first-time screenwriters, tried to break into the business by writing a script involving Harry tackling a radical terrorist group inspired by the Symbionese Liberation Army, following the ripped-from-the-headlines technique of the first film, whilst independently Hollywood old hand Sterling Silliphant wrote a script about Harry teaming up with an Asian-American policewoman breaking through the glass ceiling into the homicide department. Eastwood thought that the first script was a bit rough around the edges but had a really strong premise, whilst the second script had the right idea by making Harry team up with a woman but didn’t have enough action. His solution was to have Silliphant and Dean Riesner do another pass, combining the two concepts to produce a film which would hopefully end up with the best of both worlds.\n\nSo, as mentioned there’s a murderous group of radical extremists – the People’s Revolutionary Strike Force – who raid an arms warehouse, stealing guns, ammo, rocket launchers, explosives, and in the process fatally wound Frank DiGiorgio (John Mitchum), series regular and one of Harry’s oldest friends on the force. Harry is naturally gunning for revenge, and he’s taking along his new partner for the ride – Inspector Kate Moore (Tyne Daly, Silliphant’s original character concept having been whitewashed). Matters progress as you might expect.\n\nPossibly the most dated aspect of the movie is the entire “Harry is a sexist and has to get over it to work effectively with his new partner” deal. It’s the classic 1970s Hollywood attempt to tackle sexism that ends up being both simplistic and extremely hit and miss. Part of the problem is that the film tries to pitch Harry’s sexism in such a way that he might have a point, so as to try and not make him entirely unsympathetic. For instance, part of Harry’s objections stem from the fact that Moore’s past experience is in Personnel and Records, and he has doubts that you can be an effective detective without pulling down at least some frontline experience.\n\nThere’s a point that could have been made here about whether what is going on in the department is really affirmative action, or whether it’s simply a way to sabotage affirmative action by setting people up to fail by tossing them in at the deep end without giving them opportunities to develop the necessary skills. However, this is pretty much drowned in the sexism 101 nonsense, a tack which is rendered nonsensical by a scene in which Harry violently extorts information from a sex worker which should pretty much sink any claim the movie has to feminist credentials.\n\nOn top of that, the film goes out of its way to suggest that, whilst Moore might be a talented cop, at the same time in some respects she really isn’t ready for the big time, further justifying Harry’s position. She runs around in this skirt that constrains her movements irritatingly, she carries her gun about in a purse that she has to fumble about in in order to draw it rather than having a holster like an actual professional, she gets all squeamish in an autopsy or after she discovers she was carrying a bomb around, and she gets killed off by the end of the movie in order to add to the ever-growing body count of Harry’s ex-partners. Oh, and there’s this incipient romance between the two that seems to correlate with Harry’s growing respect for her, which is pretty galling. (It says a lot that we had to wait for RoboCop to have a major Hollywood cop film where the hero has a policewoman as their partner on the beat and a) the relationship between them is purely platonic and b) the woman is presented as being just as capable as her partner – OK, in RoboCop Murphy gets superpowers, but he has to get ‘borged for that to happen.)\n\nIt isn’t all bad, mind. The film does at least neatly observe the various ways in which women were ignored or sidelined in professional situations during the era and frequently are today, for instance. Furthermore, once Kate gets a kill or two under her belt she proves to be just as capable as Harry when it comes her participation in the final shootout; her death genuinely seems to be the result of shitty luck instead of any actual mistake on her part. At the same time, the film is obviously a product of a time where these sorts of tropes in storytelling hadn’t been picked apart to nearly the extent they have today, and it’s equally a film which was ultimately supposed to be all about how cool Harry is yet again.\n\nThe Enforcer is an unremarkable action movie which demonstrates just how quickly the series drifted into self-parody. The action isn’t quite as over-the-top as it sometimes gets in Magnum Force, and the plot is by and large incredibly formulaic. A few bright moments are offered by series regular Albert Popwell, who gets his meatiest role in the series yet as Big Ed Mustapha, a leader of a group of black militants based on a combination of the Black Panthers and more mystical strands of black nationalism, who agrees to provide information about the PRSF to Harry because he’s appalled by their cowboy tactics. Likewise, the character of Father John (M.G. Kelly), a priest with covert connections to the radicals, is a highlight of the story. The actual radicals themselves, though, are a rather interchangeable and generic bunch, just like this is a rather interchangeable and generic movie.\n\nOne actually gets the impression that Clint felt the same in some respects; there’s a weariness to his performance this time, and it’s genuinely hard to judge whether Harry is supposed to be a bit more jaded and detached this time or whether the loss of intensity was down to Eastwood simply not feeling it any more. In fact, the original plan was that this was supposed to be the final film in the series, but Warner Brothers eventually decided to resurrect the franchise in the mid-1980s, luring Eastwood back by agreeing to bankroll some of his more personal projects if he’d go through the motions to churn out another few sequels. This might go some way to explain how Eastwood was able to create Pale Rider in 1985, despite the commercial slump that Hollywood Westerns had suffered in the wake of Heaven’s Gate bombing.\n\n(This is apropos of nothing, but isn’t it wild how, by giving Michael Cimino his big break, Eastwood had inadvertently set in motion a series of events which would culminate in Heaven’s Gate salting the Earth for Hollywood Westerns for years to come?)\n\nYou can kind of tell that Sudden Impact was basically made out of contractural obligation. Losing what little nuance the series still retained by this point, it completed the journey into self-parody by becoming precisely the sort of vigilante-endorsing trash the original film was accused of being, with no more depth than, say, the various Death Wish sequels. Its plot revolves around Harry getting onto the trail of an artist who is going around murdering the people who gang raped her and her sister ten years ago, which is about as grim as you’d expect and even ends with Harry knowingly misleading the police about a crucial piece of evidence so that the artist can go free – about as unambiguous an endorsement of vigilante violence and murder as you can expect to find. To make it even more distasteful, the artist ends up giving up on her murder spree when she discovers that one of the rapists has ended up catatonic after deliberately crashing his car in a guilt-ridden suicide attempt, in a deliberate parallel with the artist’s sister being catatonic after the attack – because apparently guilt over participation in a violent attack is somehow morally or emotionally equivalent to the trauma victims feel or something.\n\nI’ve only seen the first forty minutes or so of it but between that and the Wikipedia summary I’m satisfied that it probably doesn’t suddenly improve at the halfway mark and even if it does, I don’t care to watch it doing so. This right here is where I and the series part ways, and to be honest I don’t see myself rewatching anything other than the original and maybe Magnum Force particularly often in future. The difference between those two and the rest of the series is that those movies are posing questions and, at their best, aren’t pretending to have answers; Harry tackles things the best he can, but we aren’t expected to believe that his way was the correct way. The later movies aren’t asking questions any more; they’re increasingly sure of their answers, and it’s when people tackling these difficult moral issues start to feel certain they are correct that the really bad shit happens."
