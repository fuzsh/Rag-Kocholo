        "text": "Tips for answering\n\nBecome familiar with the answer choices. Quantitative Comparison questions always have the same answer choices, so get to know them, especially the last choice, \"The relationship cannot be determined from the information given.\" Never select this last choice if it’s clear the values of the two quantities can be determined by computation. Also, if you determine that one quantity is greater than the other, make sure you carefully select the corresponding choice and don’t reverse the first two choices.\n\nAvoid unnecessary computations. Don't waste time performing needless computations to compare the two quantities. Simplify, transform or estimate one or both of the given quantities only as needed to compare them.\n\nRemember that geometric figures aren’t necessarily drawn to scale. If any aspect of a given geometric figure is not fully determined, try to redraw the figure, keeping those aspects that are completely determined by the given information fixed but changing the aspects of the figure that are not determined. Examine the results. What variations are possible in the relative lengths of line segments or measures of angles?\n\nPlug in numbers. If one or both quantities are algebraic expressions, you can substitute easy numbers for the variables and compare the resulting quantities in your analysis. Consider all kinds of appropriate numbers before you give an answer: e.g., zero, positive and negative numbers, small and large numbers, fractions and decimals. If you see that Quantity A is greater than Quantity B in one case and Quantity B is greater than Quantity A in another case, choose \"The relationship cannot be determined from the information given.\"\n\nSimplify the comparison. If both quantities are algebraic or arithmetic expressions and you can’t easily see a relationship between them, try to simplify the comparison. Try a step-by-step simplification that is similar to the steps involved when you solve the equation for x, or similar to the steps involved when you determine that the inequality is equivalent to the simpler inequality Begin by setting up a comparison involving the two quantities:\n\nwhere is a placeholder that could represent the relationship greater than (>), less than (<), or equal to (=), or could represent the fact that the relationship can’t be determined from the information given. Then try to simplify the comparison, step by step, until you can determine a relationship between simplified quantities. For example, you may conclude after the last step that represents equal to (=). Based on this conclusion, you may be able to compare Quantities A and B. To understand this strategy more fully, see sample questions 6 to 9.\n\nRead the statement of the problem carefully to make sure you understand the information given and the problem you are being asked to solve.\n\nSome information may describe certain quantities.\n\nQuantitative information may be given in words or mathematical expressions, or a combination of both.\n\nYou may need to read and understand quantitative information in data presentations, geometric figures or coordinate systems.\n\nOther information may take the form of formulas, definitions or conditions that must be satisfied by the quantities. For example, the conditions may be equations or inequalities, or may be words that can be translated into equations or inequalities.\n\nIn addition to understanding the information you are given, make sure you understand what you need to accomplish in order to solve the problem. For example, what unknown quantities must be found? In what form must they be expressed?\n\nSolving a mathematics problem requires more than understanding a description of the problem (the quantities, the data, the conditions, the unknowns and all other mathematical facts related to the problem). It also requires determining what mathematical facts to use and when and how to use those facts to develop a solution to the problem. It requires a strategy.\n\nMathematics problems are solved by using a wide variety of strategies, and there may be different ways to solve a given problem. Develop a repertoire of problem-solving strategies and a sense of which strategies are likely to work best in solving particular problems. Attempting to solve a problem without a strategy may lead to a lot of work without producing a correct solution.\n\nAfter you determine a strategy, carry it out. If you get stuck, check your work to see if you made an error in your solution. Maintain a flexible, open mindset. If you check your solution and can’t find an error, or if your solution strategy is simply not working, look for a different strategy."
