        "text": "Note: Practice quizzes are available only for those sections of the manual covering rules of the road (Chapters 4 through 11 and Road Signs).\n\nYou have probably heard the facts before - driving while impaired or intoxicated is a serious traffic safety problem in the United States. In New York State, more than 40 percent of all motor vehicle fatalities involve impaired driving. But the facts and statistics do not tell the whole story. Behind the numbers are thousands of lives cut short, permanent or disabling injuries, and families devastated because someone drove while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.\n\nWhen you drink alcohol or take other drugs, safe driving is not possible. Not every impaired or intoxicated driver causes a traffic crash, but each one is dangerous, putting their lives and those they share the road with at risk.\n\nYoung people, who have less experience with alcohol or drugs and less experience with driving, are at high risk. Drivers under age 21 are approximately 4 percent of the driving population, but 7 percent of the impaired drivers involved in fatal crashes. This is one reason the driver license revocation penalties are more severe for young drivers who drive under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.\n\nBecause driving \"under the influence\" is so dangerous, the penalties for alcohol or drug-related violations are tough and enforcement is important. The chance of apprehension and conviction are high and New York State law strictly limits your ability to plea bargain when charged with an offense related to alcohol or drugs.\n\nAlcohol delays your reaction time, reduces your ability to see clearly, changes your judgment of speed and distances, often makes you less inhibited and makes you more prone to take chances. The important skills you need to drive safely are made weaker.\n\nBecause your vision is normally restricted at night, it is especially dangerous to drink and drive after dark. Alcohol also reduces your ability to recover from the glare of headlights. When another vehicle moves toward you, you can be blinded by its headlights for a long period of time.\n\nYou do not have to look or feel intoxicated for these things to occur. The symptoms of alcohol consumption can begin long before you become intoxicated or even legally impaired and begin with the first drink.\n\nAs alcohol physically limits your ability to drive, it also makes you less aware of what is happening to your safe driving abilities. It becomes difficult for you to judge your condition. You can gain confidence about driving, when you should not be driving at all.\n\nDuring each mile you drive, you make hundreds of decisions. Your decisions turn into actions that keep your vehicle controlled and ensure you avoid crashes. Alcohol makes it difficult to make correct decisions and to take the safest actions.\n\nFor example: You have just stopped at a STOP sign. You see another vehicle approaching the intersection. You must quickly make a decision whether it is safe to go through the intersection. Under the influence of alcohol, you are more likely to make a wrong decision and \"take a chance.” Your slower reaction time, and the bad decision, could cause a crash.\n\nDrugs, which include many prescription and over-the-counter medications, as well as illegal substances, can affect your ability to drive. They can have effects similar to alcohol or even worse. If you take medication, even a remedy for colds or allergies that is not prescribed, check the label for warnings about its effects. If you are unsure, ask your doctor or pharmacist about driving while on the medication.\n\nNever drink alcohol while you are taking other drugs. It could be dangerous, often enhancing the effects of the alcohol and the other drug. For example, taking one drink while you are also using a cold remedy could affect you as much as several drinks.\n\nIt can be a criminal offense to drive while impaired by the effect of drugs, alcohol, or the combination of alcohol and drugs, including marijuana/cannabis, and illegal drugs such as cocaine, LSD, heroin, opium, and by some prescription drugs. Drugs can detrimentally affect your reflexes, judgment, vision and alertness and they may have other dangerous effects as well.\n\nA combination of alcohol and other drugs severely reduces your ability to drive and can cause serious health problems, which can include death.\n\nIn New York State, you can be arrested for any of these offenses: aggravated driving while intoxicated (Agg-DWI), driving while intoxicated (DWI), driving with a blood alcohol content of .08 percent or more (.08 BAC), driving while ability impaired by a drug (DWAI-drug), driving while ability impaired by alcohol (DWAI), or driving under the combined influence of alcohol and drugs.\n\nBlood alcohol content (BAC) is the percentage of alcohol in your blood and is normally determined by a chemical test of breath, blood, urine or saliva. A BAC of more than .05 percent is legal evidence that you are impaired, a BAC of .08 percent or higher is evidence of intoxication, and a BAC of .18 percent or more is evidence of aggravated driving while intoxicated.\n\nMany people think chemical test evidence is required to prove you were intoxicated or impaired. However, the testimony of a police officer about the way you drive, and your appearance and behavior while interacting with the officer can provide enough evidence to convict you, even without a chemical test.\n\nIf you are found guilty of any alcohol or drug-related violation, the court must revoke or suspend your driver license when you are sentenced. Even if the court allows you to continue driving for 20 days, your driver license will be taken immediately.\n\nThe BAC standards and penalties for commercial drivers are even tougher than those indicated in this chapter. For complete information, see Section 1 of the Commercial Driver's Manual (CDL-10).\n\nYour (BAC) depends on:\n\nHow much alcohol you drink.\n\nHow much time passes between drinks.\n\nYour weight.\n\nYour BAC does not depend on the type of beverage you drink, how fit you are or how you can \"hold your liquor.\"\n\nDifferent types of drinks do not affect you differently. It is the amount of alcohol you consume, not whether it is in beer, wine or liquor that raises your BAC and reduces your driving ability. These drinks contain about the same amount of alcohol - 1 1/2 ounces of liquor, 5 ounces of wine, 12 ounces of beer and 12 ounces of wine cooler. None is \"safer to drink\" than the others.\n\nFor a 150-pound male, each one of these drinks contains enough alcohol to increase his BAC by about .02 percent. On average, it takes the body approximately one hour to remove that much alcohol. Studies indicate that a woman will take longer to process and remove alcohol from the blood. This can cause a higher BAC over a longer period of time.\n\nCompared to the 150-pound male described above, your body weight can make some difference in the BAC and the effects of alcohol. No one has immunity to the effects of alcohol. It is a simple fact: the more you drink in a given period of time, the higher your BAC will be and the less safely you will drive.\n\nIt takes only a few drinks to increase your BAC to levels at which it is illegal to drive. And remember, the effects of alcohol on your ability to drive begin at even lower BAC levels after just one drink.\n\nEating before or while you drink helps slow the absorption of alcohol somewhat, but it can not prevent intoxication or impairment if you have too much to drink.\n\nThe only method to effectively reduce your BAC is to not drink over a period of time. Coffee, exercise and cold showers cannot reduce your BAC and the effects of alcohol. They can help you remain awake, but it can not change your BAC or make you sober.\n\nThe table above \"Penalties for Alcohol/Drug Related Violations\" describes fines, surcharges, license penalties and possible imprisonment if you are convicted of an alcohol or drug-related violation. Impaired or intoxicated driving can also have other serious results.\n\nRepeat Offenders\n\nDrivers with repeat dangerous driving convictions in New York State face one of the toughest licensing policies in the nation. These regulations call for:\n\nLifetime Record Review by DMV: DMV will review the lifetime record of all drivers who apply to have a license reinstated after a revocation.\n\nPermanent License Denial for Persistently Drunk & Dangerous Drivers: After conducting a lifetime record review, DMV will deny any application for reinstatement of a license after revocation if the applicant has:\n\n• Five or more alcohol or drug related driving convictions in the applicant's lifetime, or\n\n• Three or four alcohol or drug related driving convictions in the 25-year look back period plus at least one other serious driving offense during that period. A serious driving offense includes: a fatal crash, a driving-related penal law conviction, an accumulation of 20 or more points assessed for driving violations within the 25-year look back period or having two or more driving convictions during the 25-year look back period, each worth five points or more.\n\nDelayed Re-Licensing, Driving Restrictions, & Interlocks for Other Drivers with Repeated Alcohol - or Drug-Related Driving Convictions: For those drivers seeking reinstatement of a license after revocation who have three or four alcohol- or drug-related driving convictions but no serious driving offense in the 25-year look back period, DMV will:\n\nDeny their applications for five years beyond their statutory revocation period if the applicant's license was revoked for an alcohol- or drug-related offense; or two additional years if the applicant's license was revoked for a reason other than an alcohol or drug related offense;\n\nRestore the applicant's license after that additional period as a \"restricted\" license limiting the applicant's driving to, for example, travel to and from work or medical visits; and\n\nRequire an interlock device on the vehicle driven by the applicant for five years from the date of issuance of the licensing document. The interlock requirement applies to those motorists who were approved after the five-year waiting period.\n\nEnd the Reduction of Mandatory Suspension or Revocation Periods: Previously, drunk drivers whose licenses have been revoked or suspended twice within a 25-year period could get their full driving privileges back in as little as seven weeks by completing DMV's Impaired Driver Program. DMV's new regulations will ensure that those drivers cannot obtain their driving privileges until their full term of suspension or revocation has ended.\n\nZero Tolerance for Drivers Under Age 21\n\nThe legal purchase and possession age for beverages containing alcohol in New York State is 21. Under the state's \"zero tolerance\" law, it is a violation for a person under 21 to drive with any BAC that can be measured (.02 to .07). After a finding of violation is determined at a DMV hearing, the driver license will be suspended for six months. The driver then must pay a $100 suspension termination fee and a $125 civil penalty to be re-licensed. For a second Zero Tolerance violation, the driver license will be revoked for at least one year or until the driver reaches 21, whichever is longer.\n\nIllegal Purchase Of Beverages Containing Alcohol\n\nWhen you use a driver license or Non-Driver ID card as proof of age to illegally purchase beverages that contain alcohol, state law requires the suspension of your driver license or privilege to apply for a license.\n\nOpen Container Law\n\nIt is a traffic infraction for a driver or passenger in a motor vehicle on a public highway, street or road to drink a beverage containing alcohol or to possess an open container containing an alcoholic beverage. It is also a traffic infraction for a driver or passenger in a motor vehicle on a public highway, street or road to consume marijuana/cannabis. The penalty for a first conviction is a fine up to $150, a mandatory surcharge, a crime victim assistance fee, and possible imprisonment of 15 days. Additional offenses within 18 months bring higher penalties. The law exempts passengers in vehicles like stretch limousines and other vehicles that display a commerce certificate or permit issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation or the NYS Department of Transportation.\n\nThe Ignition Interlock Program and Leandra's Law\n\nCourts must order all persons convicted of driving while intoxicated or aggravated driving while intoxicated, or of a penal law offense for which an alcohol related violation of any provision of section 1192 of the Vehicle & Traffic Law is an essential element to install and maintain an ignition interlock on any vehicle owned or operated by such driver for at least 12 months. (This device, purchased and installed at the expense of the motorist, is connected to a motor vehicle ignition system and measures the alcohol content of the breath of the driver. The vehicle cannot be started until the driver provides an acceptable sample breath.) The 12-month requirement may be waived by the court if the defendant demonstrates that the interlock device was installed for at least six months, unless the court orders the interlock device to be installed for a longer period of time. The judge also must order an alcohol assessment for a repeat offender. If the assessment indicates alcohol treatment is necessary, the judge may be required to order the completion of treatment as a condition of probation.\n\nDrivers who commit these alcohol-related offenses with a child under 16 years old in the vehicle may be charged with a class E felony, punishable by up to four years in prison. (This is known as Leandra’s Law.)\n\nThe law also makes it a felony to drive drunk with a conditional license, which is a license that may be issued by the DMV when someone is convicted of an alcohol-related offense. Such a license may be used only for driving to and from essential destinations such as school, work and medical appointments. The conditional driver license will be revoked if the motorist does not comply with the court terms or for a conviction for any traffic offense except parking, stopping or standing."
