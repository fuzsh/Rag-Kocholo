        "text": "Stay organized with collections Save and categorize content based on your preferences.\n\nFAQ (FAQPage, Question, Answer) structured data\n\nA Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) page contains a list of questions and answers pertaining to a particular topic. Properly marked up FAQ pages may be eligible to have a rich result on Search and an Action on the Google Assistant, which can help your site reach the right users.\n\nHow to add structured data\n\nStructured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page content. If you're new to structured data, you can learn more about how structured data works.\n\nHere's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data.\n\nAdd the required properties. Based on the format you're using, learn where to insert structured data on the page.\n\nFollow the guidelines.\n\nValidate your code using the Rich Results Test and fix any critical errors. Consider also fixing any non-critical issues that may be flagged in the tool, as they can help improve the quality of your structured data (however, this isn't necessary to be eligible for rich results).\n\nDeploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can ask Google to recrawl your URLs.\n\nTo keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you submit a sitemap. You can automate this with the Search Console Sitemap API.\n\nFeature availability\n\nFAQ rich results are available for well-known, authoritative websites that are government-focused or health-focused. The feature is available on desktop and mobile devices in all countries and languages where Google Search is available.\n\nExamples\n\nJSON-LD\n\nHere's an example of FAQPage in JSON-LD:\n\n<html> <head> <title>Finding an apprenticeship - Frequently Asked Questions(FAQ)</title> <script type=\"application/ld+json\"> { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [{ \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"How to find an apprenticeship?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"<p>We provide an official service to search through available apprenticeships.

You will be able to search through all officially registered open apprenticeships.</p>\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"Whom to contact?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"You can contact the apprenticeship office through our official phone hotline above, or with the web-form below.

It must also be well-known and authoritative.\n\nOnly use FAQPage if your page contains FAQs where there's a single answer to each question. If your page has a single question and users can submit alternative answers, use QAPage instead. Here are some examples:\n\nValid use cases:\n\nAn FAQ page written by the health site itself, with no way for users to submit alternative answers\n\nA government agency's support page that lists FAQs, with no way for users to submit alternative answers\n\nInvalid use cases:\n\nA forum page where users can submit answers to a single question\n\nA product support page where users can submit answers to a single question\n\nA product page where users can submit multiple questions and answers on a single page\n\nDon't use FAQPage for advertising purposes.\n\nMake sure each Question includes the entire text of the question and make sure each Answer includes the entire text of the answer. The entire question text and answer text may be displayed.\n\nQuestion and answer content may not be displayed as a rich result if it contains any of the following types of content: obscene, profane, sexually explicit, graphically violent, promotion of dangerous or illegal activities, or hateful or harassing language.\n\nAll FAQ content must be visible to the user on the source page. Here are some examples:\n\nValid use cases:\n\nBoth the question and answer are visible on the page.\n\nThe question is visible on the page, and the answer is hidden behind an expandable section. The user is able to access the answer by clicking the expandable section.\n\nInvalid use cases: The user can't find the FAQ content on the page at all.\n\nIf you have FAQ content that is repetitive on your site (meaning, the same question and answer appear on multiple pages on your site), mark up only one instance of that FAQ for your entire site.\n\nStructured data type definitions\n\nYou must include the required properties for your content to be eligible for display as a rich result. You can also include the recommended properties to add more information to your structured data, which could provide a better user experience.\n\nFAQPage\n\nThe full definition of FAQPage is provided on schema.org.\n\nThe FAQPage type indicates that the page is an FAQ with answered questions. There must be one FAQPage type definition per page.\n\nThe Google-supported properties are the following:\n\nQuestion\n\nThe full definition of Question is provided on schema.org.\n\nThe Question type defines a single answered question within the FAQ. Every Question instance must be contained within the mainEntity property array of the schema.org/FAQPage.\n\nThe Google-supported properties are the following:\n\nRequired properties\n\nAnswer\n\nThe full definition of Answer is provided on schema.org.\n\nThe Answer type defines the acceptedAnswer to each of the Question on this page.\n\nThe Google-supported properties are the following:\n\nRequired properties\n\nMonitor rich results with Search Console\n\nSearch Console is a tool that helps you monitor how your pages perform in Google Search. You don't have to sign up for Search Console to be included in Google Search results, but it can help you understand and improve how Google sees your site. We recommend checking Search Console in the following cases:\n\nAfter deploying structured data for the first time\n\nAfter releasing new templates or updating your code\n\nAnalyzing traffic periodically\n\nAfter deploying structured data for the first time\n\nAfter Google has indexed your pages, look for issues using the relevant Rich result status report. Ideally, there will be an increase of valid items, and no increase in invalid items. If you find issues in your structured data:\n\nFix the invalid items.\n\nInspect a live URL to check if the issue persists.\n\nRequest validation using the status report.\n\nAfter releasing new templates or updating your code\n\nWhen you make significant changes to your website, monitor for increases in structured data invalid items.\n\nIf you see an increase in invalid items, perhaps you rolled out a new template that doesn't work, or your site interacts with the existing template in a new and bad way.\n\nIf you see a decrease in valid items (not matched by an increase in invalid items), perhaps you are no longer embedding structured data in your pages. Use the URL Inspection tool to learn what is causing the issue.\n\nAnalyzing traffic periodically\n\nAnalyze your Google Search traffic using the Performance Report. The data will show you how often your page appears as a rich result in Search, how often users click on it and what is the average position you appear on search results. You can also automatically pull these results with the Search Console API.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf you're having trouble implementing or debugging structured data, here are some resources that may help you.\n\nIf you're using a content management system (CMS) or someone else is taking care of your site, ask them to help you. Make sure to forward any Search Console message that details the issue to them.\n\nGoogle does not guarantee that features that consume structured data will show up in search results. For a list of common reasons why Google may not show your content in a rich result, see the General Structured Data Guidelines.\n\nYou might have an error in your structured data. Check the list of structured data errors and the Unparsable structured data report.\n\nIf you received a structured data manual action against your page, the structured data on the page will be ignored (although the page can still appear in Google Search results). To fix structured data issues, use the Manual Actions report.\n\nReview the guidelines again to identify if your content isn't compliant with the guidelines. The problem can be caused by either spammy content or spammy markup usage. However, the issue may not be a syntax issue, and so the Rich Results Test won't be able to identify these issues.\n\nTroubleshoot missing rich results / drop in total rich results.\n\nAllow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it. For general questions about crawling and indexing, check the Google Search crawling and indexing FAQ.\n\nPost a question in the Google Search Central forum."
