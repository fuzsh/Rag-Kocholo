        "text": "Organizations have sensitive information under their control, such as:\n\nfinancial data\n\nproprietary data\n\ncredit card numbers\n\nhealth records\n\nsocial security numbers\n\nTo help protect this sensitive data, and to reduce the risk from oversharing, they need a way to help prevent their users from inappropriately sharing sensitive data with people who shouldn't have it. This practice is called data loss prevention (DLP).\n\nIn Microsoft Purview, you implement data loss prevention by defining and applying DLP policies. With a DLP policy, you can identify, monitor, and automatically protect sensitive items across:\n\nMicrosoft 365 services such as Teams, Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive accounts\n\nOffice applications such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint\n\nWindows 10, Windows 11, and macOS (three latest released versions) endpoints\n\nnon-Microsoft cloud apps\n\non-premises file shares and on-premises SharePoint\n\nFabric and Power BI\n\nDLP detects sensitive items by using deep content analysis, not by just a simple text scan. Content is analyzed:\n\nFor primary data matches to keywords\n\nBy the evaluation of regular expressions\n\nBy internal function validation\n\nBy secondary data matches that are in proximity to the primary data match\n\nDLP also uses machine learning algorithms and other methods to detect content that matches your DLP policies\n\nBefore you begin\n\nIf you're new to Microsoft Purview DLP, here's a list of the core articles you'll need as you implement DLP:\n\nAdministrative units\n\nLearn about Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention - the article you're reading now introduces you to the data loss prevention discipline and Microsoft's implementation of DLP\n\nPlan for data loss prevention (DLP) - by working through this article you will:\n\nIdentify stakeholders\n\nDescribe the categories of sensitive information to protect\n\nSet goals and strategy\n\nData Loss Prevention policy reference - this article introduces all the components of a DLP policy and how each one influences the behavior of a policy\n\nDesign a DLP policy - this article walks you through creating a policy intent statement and mapping it to a specific policy configuration.\n\nCreate and Deploy data loss prevention policies - This article presents some common policy intent scenarios that you'll map to configuration options, then it walks you through configuring those options.\n\nLearn about investigating data loss prevention alerts - This article introduces you to the lifecycle of alerts from creation, through final remediation and policy tuning. It also introduces you to the tools you use to investigate alerts.\n\nLicensing and Subscriptions\n\nSee the Microsoft 365 guidance for security & compliance for details on the subscriptions that support DLP.\n\nDLP is part of the larger Microsoft Purview offering\n\nDLP is just one of the Microsoft Purview tools that you'll use to help protect your sensitive items wherever they live or travel. You should understand the other tools in the Microsoft Purview tool set, how they interrelate, and work better together. See, Microsoft Purview tools to learn more about the information protection process.\n\nProtective actions of DLP policies\n\nDLP policies are how you monitor the activities that users take on sensitive items at rest, sensitive items in transit, or sensitive items in use and then take protective actions. For example, when a user attempts a prohibited action, like copying a sensitive item to an unapproved location or sharing medical information in an email, DLP can:\n\nshow a pop-up policy tip to the user that warns them that they might be trying to share a sensitive item inappropriately\n\nblock the sharing and, via a policy tip, allow the user to override the block and capture the users' justification\n\nblock the sharing without the override option\n\nfor data at rest, sensitive items can be locked and moved to a secure quarantine location\n\nfor Teams chat, the sensitive information won't be displayed\n\nAll DLP monitored activities are recorded to the Microsoft 365 Audit log by default and routed to Activity explorer.\n\nDLP lifecycle\n\nA DLP implementation typically follows these major phases.\n\nPlan for DLP\n\nPrepare for DLP\n\nDeploy your policies in production\n\nPlan for DLP\n\nDLP monitoring and protection are native to the applications that users use every day. This helps to protect your organization's sensitive items from risky activities, even if your users are unaccustomed to data loss prevention thinking and practices. If your organization and your users are new to data loss prevention practices, the adoption of DLP might require a change to your business processes, and there will be a culture shift for your users. But, with proper planning, testing and tuning, your DLP policies protect your sensitive items while minimizing any potential business process disruptions.\n\nTechnology planning for DLP\n\nKeep in mind that DLP as a technology can monitor and protect your data at rest, data in use and data in motion across Microsoft 365 services, Windows 10, Windows 11, and macOS (three latest released versions) devices, on-premises file shares, and on-premises SharePoint. There are planning implications for the different locations, the type of data you want to monitor and protect, and the actions to be taken when a policy match occurs.\n\nBusiness processes planning for DLP\n\nDLP policies can block users from performing prohibited activities, like inappropriate sharing of sensitive information via email. As you plan your DLP policies, you must identify the business processes that touch your sensitive items. The business process owners can help you identify appropriate user behaviors that should be allowed and inappropriate user behaviors that should be protected against. You should plan your policies and deploy them in simulation mode, and evaluate their impact, before running them in more restrictive modes.\n\nOrganizational culture planning for DLP\n\nA successful DLP implementation is as much dependent on getting your users trained and acclimated to data loss prevention practices as it is on well planned and tuned policies. Since your users are heavily involved, be sure to plan for training for them too. You can strategically use policy tips to raise awareness with your users before changing the policy status from simulation mode to more restrictive modes.\n\nPrepare for DLP\n\nYou can apply DLP policies to data at rest, data in use, and data in motion in locations such as:\n\nExchange Online email\n\nSharePoint sites\n\nOneDrive accounts\n\nTeams chat and channel messages\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Cloud Apps (Instances)\n\nWindows 10, Windows 11, and macOS (three latest released versions) devices\n\nOn-premises repositories\n\nFabric and Power BI workspaces\n\nEach one has different prerequisites. Sensitive items in some locations, like Exchange online, can be brought under the DLP umbrella by just configuring a policy that applies to them. Others, such as on-premises file repositories, require a deployment of Microsoft Purview Information Protection scanner. You'll need to prepare your environment, code draft policies, and test them thoroughly before activating any blocking actions.\n\nDeploy your policies in production\n\nDesign your policies\n\nStart by defining your control objectives, and how they apply across each respective workload. Draft a policy that embodies your objectives. Feel free to start with one workload at a time, or across all workloads - there's no impact yet. For more information, see Create and deploy data loss prevention policies.\n\nImplement policy in simulation mode\n\nEvaluate the impact of the controls by implementing them with a DLP policy in simulation mode. Actions defined in a policy aren't applied while the policy is in simulation mode. It's ok to apply the policy to all workloads in simulation mode, so that you can get the full breadth of results, but you can start with one workload if you need to. For more information, see Policy Deployment.\n\nMonitor outcomes and fine-tune the policy\n\nWhile in simulation mode, monitor the outcomes of the policy and fine-tune it so that it meets your control objectives while ensuring you aren't adversely or inadvertently impacting valid user workflows and productivity. Here are some examples of things to fine-tune:\n\nadjusting the locations and people/places that are in or out of scope\n\ntune the conditions that are used to determine if an item and what is being done with it matches the policy\n\nthe sensitive information definition/s\n\nadd new controls\n\nadd new people\n\nadd new restricted apps\n\nadd new restricted sites\n\nNote\n\nStop processing more rules doesn't work in simulation mode, even when it's turned on.\n\nEnable the control and tune your policies\n\nOnce the policy meets all your objectives, turn it on. Continue to monitor the outcomes of the policy application and tune as needed.\n\nNote\n\nIn general, policies take effect about an hour after being turned on.\n\nDLP policy configuration overview\n\nYou have flexibility in how you create and configure your DLP policies. You can start from a predefined template and create a policy in just a few clicks or you can design your own from the ground up. No matter which you choose, all DLP policies require the same information from you.\n\nChoose what you want to monitor - DLP comes with many predefined policy templates to help you get started or you can create a custom policy.\n\nA predefined policy template, such as Financial data, Medical and health data, Privacy data all for various countries and regions.\n\nA custom policy that uses the available sensitive information types (SIT), retention labels, and sensitivity labels.\n\nChoose administrative scoping - DLP supports assigning Administrative Units to policies. Administrators who are assigned to an administrative unit can only create and manage policies for the users, groups, distribution groups, and accounts that they're assigned to. So, policies can be applied to all users and groups by an unrestricted administrator, or they can be scoped to administrative units. See, Policy Scoping for more DLP specific details. See, Administrative units for the details on administrative units across Microsoft Purview Information Protection.\n\nChoose where you want to monitor - You pick one or more locations that you want DLP to monitor for sensitive information. You can monitor:\n\nlocation include/exclude by Exchange email distribution groups SharePoint sites sites OneDrive accounts accounts or distribution groups Teams chat and channel messages account or distribution group Windows 10, Windows 11, and macOS (three latest released versions) devices user or group Microsoft Cloud App Security instance On-premises repositories repository file path Fabric and Power BI workspaces\n\nChoose the conditions that must be matched for a policy to be applied to an item - You can accept preconfigured conditions or you can define custom conditions. Some examples are:\n\nitem contains a specified types of sensitive information that is being used in a certain context. For example, 95 social security numbers being emailed to recipient outside your org.\n\nitem has a specified sensitivity label\n\nitem with sensitive information is shared either internally or externally\n\nChoose the action to take when the policy conditions are met - The actions depend on the location where the activity is happening. Some examples are:\n\nSharePoint/Exchange/OneDrive: Block people who are outside your organization from accessing the content. Show the user a tip and send them an email notification that they're taking an action that is prohibited by the DLP policy.\n\nTeams Chat and Channel: Block sensitive information from being shared in the chat or channel.\n\nWindows 10, Windows 11, and macOS (three latest released versions) Devices: Audit or restrict copying a sensitive item to a removable USB device.\n\nOffice Apps: Show a popup notifying the user that they're engaging in a risky behavior and block or block but allow override.\n\nOn-premises file shares: move the file from where it's stored to a quarantine folder.\n\nNote\n\nThe conditions and the actions to take are defined in an object called a rule.\n\nCreate and deploy a DLP policy\n\nAll DLP policies are created and maintained in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. See, Create and Deploy data loss prevention policies for more information.\n\nAfter you create a DLP policy in the compliance portal, it's stored in a central policy store, and then synced to the various content sources, including:\n\nExchange, and from there to Outlook on the web and Outlook\n\nOneDrive\n\nSharePoint sites\n\nOffice desktop programs (Excel, PowerPoint, and Word)\n\nMicrosoft Teams channels and chat messages\n\nAfter the policy is synced to the right locations, it starts to evaluate content and enforce actions.\n\nViewing policy application results\n\nDLP reports a vast amount of information to Microsoft Purview from monitoring to policy matches and actions, to user activities. You'll need to consume and act on that information to tune your policies and triage actions taken on sensitive items. The telemetry goes into the Microsoft 365 audit Logs first, is processed, and makes its way to different reporting tools. Each reporting tool has a different purpose.\n\nHigh volume of sensitive info shared or save externally\n\nMicrosoft 365 provides you with visibility into risky user activities outside of DLP policies. The High volume of sensitive info shared or saved externally card on the DLP homepage shows a count of sensitive items that users have:\n\nuploaded to the suspicious domains\n\naccessed with a suspicious application\n\ncopied to a removable drive\n\nMicrosoft 365 scans the audit logs for risky activities and runs them through a correlation engine to find activities that are occurring at a high volume. No DLP policies are required.\n\nTo get more details on the items that users are copying or moving outside of your organization (called egress activities, or exfiltration), select the Learn more link on the card to open a details pane. You can investigate incidents for Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP) from the Microsoft Defender portal Incidents & alerts > Incidents. See Investigate data loss incidents with Microsoft Defender XDR and Investigate alerts in Microsoft Defender XDR.\n\nDLP Alerts\n\nDLP generates an alert when a user performs an action that meets the criteria of a DLP policy, and you have Incident reports configured to generate alerts. DLP posts the alert for investigation in the DLP Alerts dashboard. Use the DLP Alerts dashboard to view alerts, triage them, set investigation status, and track resolution. Alerts are also routed to Microsoft Defender portal where you can do all the alert dashboard tasks plus more.\n\nTip\n\nDLP alerts are available in the Microsoft Defender portal for six months. They are only available in the Microsoft Purview DLP alerts dashboard for 30 days.\n\nNote\n\nIf you are an administrative unit restricted admin, you'll only see the DLP alerts for your administrative unit.\n\nHere's an example of alerts generated by policy matches and activities from Windows 10 devices.\n\nYou can also view details of the associated event with rich metadata in the same dashboard.\n\nFor more information on Alerts, see:\n\nAlerts in DLP policies: Describes alerts in the context of a DLP policy.\n\nGet started with data loss prevention alerts: Covers the necessary liscensing, permissions, and prerequisites for DLP alerts and alert reference details.\n\nCreate and deploy data loss prevention policies: Includes guidance on alert configuration in the context of creating a DLP policy.\n\nLearn about investigating data loss prevention alerts: Covers the various methods for investigating of DLP alerts.\n\nInvestigate data loss incidents with Microsoft Defender XDR: How to investigate DLP alerts in Microsoft Defender portal.\n\nDLP Activity Explorer and reports\n\nThe Activity explorer tab on the DLP page has multiple filters you can use to view DLP events. Use this tool to review activity related to content that contains sensitive info or has labels applied, such as what labels were changed, files were modified, and matched a rule.\n\nYou can view the last 30 days of DLP information in Activity Explorer using these preconfigured filters:\n\nEndpoint DLP activities\n\nFiles containing sensitive info types\n\nEgress activities\n\nDLP policies that detected activities\n\nDLP policy rules that detected activities\n\nTo see this information Select this activity User overrides DLP rule undo Items that match a DLP rule DLP rule matched\n\nYou can also access DLP report using via these cmdlets in the Security & Compliance PowerShell.\n\nConnect to Security & Compliance PowerShell\n\nUse these cmdlets:\n\nGet-DlpDetailReport\n\nGet-DlpDetectionsReport\n\nGet-DlpSiDetectionsReport\n\nHowever, DLP reports need to pull data from across Microsoft 365, including Exchange. For this reason, the following cmdlets for DLP reports are available in Exchange PowerShell. To use the cmdlets for these DLP reports, take the following steps:\n\nConnect to Exchange PowerShell\n\nUse these cmdlets:\n\nGet-DlpDetailReport\n\nGet-MailDetailDlpPolicyReport\n\nContextual summary\n\nYou can see the text that surrounds the matched content, like a credit card number in a DLPRuleMatch event in Activity explorer.\n\nDLPRuleMatch events are paired with user egress activities such as \"CopyToClipboard\" or \"CloudEgress\". They should be right next to (or at least very close to) each other in Activity explorer. You'll want to look at both because the user activity contains details about the matched policy and the DLPRuleMatch event contains the details about the text that surrounds the matched content.\n\nFor endpoint, be sure that you have applied KB5016688 for Windows 10 devices and KB5016691 for Windows 11 devices or above.\n\nFor more information, see Get started with activity explorer.\n\nTo learn more about Microsoft Purview DLP, see:\n\nLearn about Endpoint data loss prevention\n\nLearn about the default data loss prevention policy in Microsoft Teams (preview)\n\nLearn about data loss prevention on-premises scanner\n\nLearn about the Microsoft Compliance Extension\n\nGet started with the data loss prevention Alerts dashboard"
