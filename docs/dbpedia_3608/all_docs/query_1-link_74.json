Especially as your organization grows from just a few people to hundreds or thousands. With labels, you can organize and tag your work, and track the work items you’re interested in.\n\nLabels are a key part of issue boards.\n\nUse labels on epics, issues, and merge requests to:\n\nCategorize items using colors and descriptive titles like bug, feature request, or docs.\n\nDynamically filter and manage items to view work that’s in progress or completed.\n\nSearch lists and boards.\n\nCommunicate priority or severity of items, using scoped labels.\n\nTypes of labels\n\nYou can use two types of labels in GitLab:\n\nProject labels can be assigned to issues and merge requests in that project only.\n\nGroup labels can be assigned to issues, merge requests, and epics in any project in the selected group or its subgroups.\n\nAssign and unassign labels\n\nHistory\n\nReal-time updates in the sidebar introduced in GitLab 14.10 with a feature flag named realtime_labels, disabled by default.\n\nReal-time updates in the sidebar enabled on GitLab.com in GitLab 15.1.\n\nReal-time updates in the sidebar enabled by default in GitLab 15.5.\n\nReal-time updates in the sidebar generally available in GitLab 15.6. Feature flag realtime_labels removed.\n\nYou can assign labels to any issue, merge request, or epic.\n\nChanged labels are immediately visible to other users, without refreshing the page, on the following:\n\nEpics\n\nIncidents\n\nIssues\n\nMerge requests\n\nTo assign or unassign a label:\n\nIn the Labels section of the sidebar, select Edit.\n\nIn the Assign labels list, search for labels by typing their names. You can search repeatedly to add more labels. The selected labels are marked with a checkmark.\n\nSelect the labels you want to assign or unassign.\n\nTo apply your changes to labels, select X next to Assign labels or select any area outside the label section.\n\nAlternatively, to unassign a label, select the X on the label you want to unassign.\n\nYou can also assign and unassign labels with quick actions:\n\nAssign labels with /label.\n\nRemove labels with /unlabel.\n\nRemove all labels and assign new ones with /relabel.\n\nView available labels\n\nView project labels\n\nTo view the project’s labels:\n\nOn the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.\n\nSelect Manage > Labels.\n\nOr:\n\nView an issue or merge request.\n\nOn the right sidebar, in the Labels section, select Edit.\n\nSelect Manage project labels.\n\nThe list of labels includes both the labels created in the project and all labels created in the project’s ancestor groups. For each label, you can see the project or group path where it was created.\n\nView group labels\n\nTo view the group’s labels:\n\nOn the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your group.\n\nSelect Manage > Labels.\n\nOr:\n\nView an epic.\n\nOn the right sidebar, in the Labels section, select Edit.\n\nSelect Manage group labels.\n\nThe list includes all labels created only in the group. It does not list any labels created in the group’s projects.\n\nCreate a label\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nYou must have at least the Reporter role for the project or group.\n\nCreate a project label\n\nTo create a project label:\n\nOn the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.\n\nSelect Manage > Labels.\n\nSelect New label.\n\nIn the Title field, enter a short, descriptive name for the label. You can also use this field to create scoped, mutually exclusive labels.\n\nOptional. In the Description field, enter additional information about how and when to use this label.\n\nOptional. Select a color by selecting from the available colors, or enter a hex color value for a specific color in the Background color field.\n\nSelect Create label.\n\nCreate a project label from an issue or merge request\n\nYou can also create a new project label from an issue or merge request. Labels you create this way belong to the same project as the issue or merge request.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nYou must have at least the Reporter role for the project.\n\nTo do so:\n\nView an issue or merge request.\n\nOn the right sidebar, in the Labels section, select Edit.\n\nSelect Create project label.\n\nFill in the name field. You can’t specify a description if creating a label this way. You can add a description later by editing the label.\n\nSelect a color by selecting from the available colors, or enter a hex color value for a specific color.\n\nSelect Create. Your label is created and selected.\n\nCreate a group label\n\nTo create a group label:\n\nOn the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your group.\n\nSelect Manage > Labels.\n\nSelect New label.\n\nIn the Title field, enter a short, descriptive name for the label. You can also use this field to create scoped, mutually exclusive labels.\n\nOptional. In the Description field, enter additional information about how and when to use this label.\n\nOptional. Select a color by selecting from the available colors, or enter a hex color value for a specific color in the Background color field.\n\nSelect Create label.\n\nCreate a group label from an epic\n\nTier: Premium, Ultimate Offering: GitLab.com, Self-managed, GitLab Dedicated\n\nYou can also create a new group label from an epic. Labels you create this way belong to the same group as the epic.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nYou must have at least the Reporter role for the group.\n\nTo do so:\n\nView an epic.\n\nOn the right sidebar, in the Labels section, select Edit.\n\nSelect Create group label.\n\nFill in the name field. You can’t specify a description if creating a label this way. You can add a description later by editing the label.\n\nSelect a color by selecting from the available colors,enter input a hex color value for a specific color.\n\nSelect Create.\n\nEdit a label\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nYou must have at least the Reporter role for the project or group.\n\nEdit a project label\n\nTo edit a project label:\n\nOn the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.\n\nSelect Manage > Labels.\n\nNext to the label you want to edit, select the vertical ellipsis ( ), and then select Edit.\n\nSelect Save changes.\n\nEdit a group label\n\nTo edit a group label:\n\nOn the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your group.\n\nSelect Manage > Labels.\n\nNext to the label you want to edit, select the vertical ellipsis ( ), and then select Edit.\n\nSelect Save changes.\n\nDelete a label\n\ncaution\n\nIf you delete a label, it is permanently deleted. All references to the label are removed from the system and you cannot undo the deletion.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nYou must have at least the Reporter role for the project.\n\nDelete a project label\n\nTo delete a project label:\n\nOn the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.\n\nSelect Manage > Labels.\n\nNext to the Subscribe button, select ( ), and then select Delete.\n\nDelete a group label\n\nTo delete a group label:\n\nOn the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your group.\n\nSelect Manage > Labels.\n\nEither:\n\nNext to the Subscribe button, select ( ).\n\nNext to the label you want to edit, select Edit ( ).\n\nSelect Delete.\n\nPromote a project label to a group label\n\nYou might want to make a project label available for other projects in the same group. Then, you can promote the label to a group label.\n\nIf other projects in the same group have a label with the same title, they are all merged with the new group label. If a group label with the same title exists, it is also merged.\n\ncaution\n\nPromoting a label is a permanent action and cannot be reversed.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nYou must have at least the Reporter role for the project.\n\nYou must have at least the Reporter role for the project’s parent group.\n\nTo promote a project label to a group label:\n\nOn the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.\n\nSelect Manage > Labels.\n\nNext to the Subscribe button, select the three dots ( ) and select Promote to group label.\n\nAll issues, merge requests, issue board lists, issue board filters, and label subscriptions with the old labels are assigned to the new group label.\n\nThe new group label has the same ID as the previous project label.\n\nPromote a subgroup label to the parent group\n\nIt’s not possible to directly promote a group label to the parent group. To achieve this, use the following workaround.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nThere must be a group that contains subgroups (“parent group”).\n\nThere must be a subgroup in the parent group, that has a label you want to promote.\n\nYou must have at least the Reporter role for both groups.\n\nTo “promote” the label to the parent group:\n\nIn the parent group, create a label with the same name as the original one. We recommend making it a different color so you don’t mistake the two while you’re doing this.\n\nIn the subgroup, view its labels. You should see the two labels and where they come from:\n\nNext to the subgroup label (the old one), select Issues, Merge requests, or Epics.\n\nAdd the new label to issues, merge requests, and epics that have the old label. To do it faster, use bulk editing.\n\nIn the subgroup or the parent group, delete the label that belongs to the lower-level group.\n\nYou should now have a label in the parent group that is named the same as the old one, and added to the same issues, MRs, and epics.\n\nGenerate default project labels\n\nIf a project or its parent group has no labels, you can generate a default set of project labels from the label list page.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nYou must have at least the Reporter role for the project.\n\nThe project must have no labels present.\n\nTo add the default labels to the project:\n\nOn the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.\n\nSelect Manage > Labels.\n\nSelect Generate a default set of labels.\n\nThe following labels are created:\n\nbug\n\nconfirmed\n\ncritical\n\ndiscussion\n\ndocumentation\n\nenhancement\n\nsuggestion\n\nsupport\n\nScoped labels\n\nTier: Premium, Ultimate Offering: GitLab.com, Self-managed, GitLab Dedicated\n\nTeams can use scoped labels to annotate issues, merge requests, and epics with mutually exclusive labels. By preventing certain labels from being used together, you can create more complex workflows.\n\nA scoped label uses a double-colon (::) syntax in its title, for example: workflow::in-review.\n\nAn issue, merge request, or epic cannot have two scoped labels, of the form key::value, with the same key. If you add a new label with the same key but a different value, the previous key label is replaced with the new label.\n\nFilter by scoped labels\n\nTo filter issue, merge request, or epic lists by a given scope, enter <scope>::* in the searched label name.\n\nFor example, filtering by the platform::* label returns issues that have platform::iOS, platform::Android, or platform::Linux labels.\n\nnote\n\nFiltering by scoped labels not available on the issues or merge requests dashboard pages.\n\nScoped labels examples\n\nExample 1. Updating issue priority:\n\nYou decide that an issue is of low priority, and assign it the priority::low label.\n\nAfter more review, you realize the issue’s priority is higher increased, and you assign it the priority::high label.\n\nBecause an issue shouldn’t have two priority labels at the same time, GitLab removes the priority::low label.\n\nExample 2. You want a custom field in issues to track the operating system platform that your features target, where each issue should only target one platform.\n\nYou create three labels:\n\nplatform::iOS\n\nplatform::Android\n\nplatform::Linux\n\nIf you assign any of these labels to an issue automatically removes any other existing label that starts with platform::.\n\nExample 3. You can use scoped labels to represent the workflow states of your teams.\n\nSuppose you have the following labels:\n\nworkflow::development\n\nworkflow::review\n\nworkflow::deployed\n\nIf an issue already has the label workflow::development and a developer wants to show that the issue is now under review, they assign the workflow::review, and the workflow::development label is removed.\n\nThe same happens when you move issues across label lists in an issue board. With scoped labels, team members not working in an issue board can also advance workflow states consistently in issues themselves.\n\nFor a video explanation, see:\n\nNested scopes\n\nYou can create a label with a nested scope by using multiple double colons :: when creating it. In this case, everything before the last :: is the scope.\n\nFor example, if your project has these labels:\n\nworkflow::backend::review\n\nworkflow::backend::development\n\nworkflow::frontend::review\n\nAn issue can’t have both workflow::backend::review and workflow::backend::development labels at the same time, because they both share the same scope: workflow::backend.\n\nOn the other hand, an issue can have both workflow::backend::review and workflow::frontend::review labels at the same time, because they both have different scopes: workflow::frontend and workflow::backend.\n\nReceive notifications when a label is used\n\nYou can subscribe to a label to receive notifications whenever the label is assigned to an issue, merge request, or epic.\n\nTo subscribe to a label:\n\nView the label list page.\n\nTo the right of any label, select Subscribe.\n\nOptional. If you are subscribing to a group label from a project, select either:\n\nSubscribe at project level to be notified about events in this project.\n\nSubscribe at group level to be notified about events in the whole group.\n\nSet label priority\n\nLabels can have relative priorities, which are used when you sort issue and merge request lists by label priority and priority.\n\nWhen prioritizing labels, you must do it from a project. It’s not possible to do it from the group label list.\n\nnote\n\nPriority sorting is based on the highest priority label only. This discussion considers changing this.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nYou must have at least the Reporter role for the project.\n\nTo prioritize a label:\n\nOn the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your project.\n\nSelect Manage > Labels.\n\nNext to a label you want to prioritize, select the star ( ).\n\nThis label now appears at the top of the label list, under Prioritized Labels.\n\nTo change the relative priority of these labels, drag them up and down the list. The labels higher in the list get higher priority.\n\nTo learn what happens when you sort by priority or label priority, see Sorting and ordering issue lists.\n\nLock labels when a merge request is merged\n\nTier: Free, Premium, Ultimate Offering: Self-managed Status: Beta\n\nHistory\n\nIntroduced in GitLab 16.3 with a flag named enforce_locked_labels_on_merge. This feature is beta. Disabled by default.\n\nThe availability of this feature is controlled by a feature flag. For more information, see the history. This feature is available for testing, but not ready for production use.\n\nTo comply with certain auditing requirements, you can set a label to be locked. When a merge request with locked labels gets merged, nobody can remove them from the MR.\n\nWhen you add locked labels to issues or epics, they behave like regular labels.\n\nPrerequisites:\n\nYou must have at least the Reporter role for the project or group.\n\ncaution\n\nAfter you set a label as locked, nobody can undo it or delete the label.\n\nTo set a label to get locked on merge:\n\nOn the left sidebar, select Search or go to and find your group or project.\n\nSelect Manage > Labels.\n\nNext to the label you want to edit, select the vertical ellipsis ( ), and then select Edit.\n\nSelect the Lock label after a merge request is merged checkbox.\n\nSelect Save changes.\n\nPractice working with labels in the following tutorials:\n\nSet up a single project for issue triage\n\nSet up issue boards for team hand-off"
