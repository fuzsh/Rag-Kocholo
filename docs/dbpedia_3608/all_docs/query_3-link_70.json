The analysis of this data reveals information about three schemas of moral reasoning: The Personal Interests Schema, The Maintaining Norms Schema and the Postconventional Schema. One of the test's original purposes was to assess the transition of moral development from adolescence to adulthood. In 1999 the test was revised in the DIT-2 for brevity, clarity and more powerful validity criteria.[2][3]\n\nThe DIT has been dubbed 'Neo-Kohlbergian' by its constituents as it emphasizes cognition, personal construction, development and postconventional moral thinking - reflective of the work by Lawrence Kohlberg and his stages of moral development.[4][5]\n\nSee Also[]\n\nJames Rest\n\nCenter for the Study of Ethical Development\n\nKohlberg's stages of moral development\n\nReferences[]"
