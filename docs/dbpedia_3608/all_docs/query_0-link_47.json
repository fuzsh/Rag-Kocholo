        "text": "Eye Doctors\n\nWhen it's time to get your eyes checked, make sure you are seeing the right eye specialist for your needs. Each member of the eye care team plays an important role in providing eye care, and they often work together in the same office. It's easy to confuse the types of professionals called \"eye doctor\" and their responsibilities in maintaining your eye health. Here's how they compare.\n\nDownload this image (PNG)\n\nDownload an animated gif for Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook\n\nOphthalmologist vs Optometrist: What's the Difference?\n\nThe levels of training and expertise—and what they are allowed to do for you—are the major difference between types of eye care professionals commonly called “eye doctor.”\n\nAn ophthalmologist is a medical doctor, and the only eye doctor with a medical degree (MD).\n\nAn optometrist is not a medical doctor but is often referred to as an eye doctor because they hold a doctor of optometry (OD) degree.\n\nOphthalmologists must complete many more years of medical training than optometrists and opticians.\n\nAs a result, an ophthalmologist is the most qualified among eye care professionals to diagnose and treat a wide range of eye diseases, beyond the routine eye and vision care provided by an optometrist.\n\nTypes of Eye Care Professionals\n\nHere's how the role of ophthalmologist eye doctors compares with other members of the eye care team:\n\nOphthalmologists\n\nOptometrists\n\nOpticians\n\nOphthalmic technicians\n\nOphthalmic technicians/technologists\n\nOphthalmic registered nurses\n\nOphthalmic photographers\n\nOphthalmologist: Eye Specialist With Advanced Medical and Surgical Training\n\nAn ophthalmologist is a medical or osteopathic physician who specializes in eye and vision care. Ophthalmologist eye doctors differ from optometrists and opticians in their levels of training and in what they can diagnose and treat.\n\nSome ophthalmologists are eye specialists in specific diseases\n\nWhile an ophthalmologist is a medical eye doctor trained to care for all eye problems and conditions, some ophthalmologists specialize further in a specific area of medical or surgical eye care. This person is called a subspecialist. He or she usually completes one or two years of additional, more in-depth training (called a fellowship) in one of the main subspecialty areas such as Glaucoma, Retina, Cornea, Pediatrics, Neurology, Oculo-Plastic Surgery or others. This added training and knowledge prepares an ophthalmologist to take care of more complex or specific conditions in certain areas of the eye or in certain groups of patients.\n\nEmpowering lives: The transformative impact of ophthalmology\n\nOptometrist: Provider of Primary Eye Care, Vision Exams, and Lens Prescriptions\n\nOptometrists are healthcare professionals who provide primary vision care ranging from vision testing and correction to the diagnosis, treatment, and management of vision changes.\n\nOpticians: Fit Eyeglasses and Contact Lenses\n\nOpticians are technicians trained to design, verify and fit eyeglass lenses and frames, contact lenses and other devices to correct eyesight. They use prescriptions supplied by ophthalmologists or optometrists, but do not test vision or write prescriptions for visual correction. Opticians are not permitted to diagnose or treat eye diseases.\n\nOphthalmic Medical Assistants: Help Physicians Examine and Treat Patients\n\nOphthalmic medical assistants work in the ophthalmologist's office and are trained to perform a variety of tests and help the physician with examining and treating patients.\n\nOphthalmic Technicians/Technologists: Assist With Testing and Minor Surgeries\n\nOphthalmic technicians/technologists are highly trained or experienced medical assistants who assist the physician with more complicated or technical medical tests and minor office surgery.\n\nOphthalmic Registered Nurses: Deliver Medications and Assist With Surgeries\n\nOphthalmic registered nurses are clinicians who have undergone special nursing training and may have additional training in ophthalmic nursing. They may assist the physician in more technical tasks, such as injecting medications or assisting with hospital or office surgery. Some ophthalmic registered nurses also serve as clinic or hospital administrators.\n\nOphthalmic Photographers: Use Cameras to Document a Patient's Eyes\n\nOphthalmic photographers use specialized cameras and photographic methods to document patients' eye conditions in photographs.\n\nSee the Right Eye Doctor at the Right Time\n\nWithout healthy vision it can be hard to work, play, drive or even recognize a face. Many factors can affect eyesight, including other health problems like high blood pressure or diabetes. Having a family member with eye disease can make you more prone to having that condition. Sight-stealing eye disease can appear at any time. Often vision changes are unnoticeable at first and difficult to detect.\n\nIf you've never had a complete, dilated eye exam, the American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends that everyone have a complete medical eye exam by age 40, and then as often as recommended by your ophthalmologist. Even if you're healthy, it's important to have a baseline eye exam by an eye doctor, whether ophthalmologist vs optometrist, to compare against in the future and help spot changes or problems.\n\nThere are many possible symptoms of eye disease. If you have any concerns about your eyes or vision, visit an ophthalmologist eye doctor. A complete, medical eye exam by an ophthalmologist could be the first step toward saving your sight.
