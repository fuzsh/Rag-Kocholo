        "text": "A debate continues regarding the reasons a paradox seems to exist when measuring the moral judgment of conservative religious populations using the Defining Issues Test (DIT and DIT2; Bebeau & Thoma, 2003), an instrument generally considered valid and reliable for measuring moral judgment ability according to the neo- Kohlbergian theoretical construct (Rest, 1975, 1979). Research has indicated that populations with a conservative religious ideology tend to score lower on the DIT than do other populations. Yet, the reasons for this phenomenon and implications regarding the validity of the DIT and the more general neo-Kohlbergian moral domain and development construct remain mired in conjecture. This study investigates findings from several studies of conservative religious populations and compares the results of an exploratory study conducted at a conservative Baptist college in the Midwest in order to better understand the paradox that seems to exist. Philosophical assumptions are then balanced to better appreciate the possibility of a synthesis between what might otherwise seem to be opposing moral perspectives.\n\nThe Chinese version of Rest’s Defining Issues Test II was administered to 113 subjects in Mainland China (n=113, average age=34.7). The scores on development of moral judgment were compared with those of the online mega sample of American participants from 2011 to 2014. Results are as followings: 1. Chinese participants show the same pattern with Americans by both sex and education. 2. Chinese participants show different pattern from Americans by religious orthodoxy and humanitarian. 3. Chinese participants score higher in meaningless items than Americans. 4. Chinese participants score higher in stage 3 while Americans score higher in stage 4. The authors draw the conclusions as follows: with Chinese participants, 1. There is a significant relationship between education and moral judgment developmental index scores. 2. There is also a significant relationship between sex and moral judgment developmental index scores. 3. There shows no significant relationship between religious orthodoxy and moral judgment developmental index scores. 4. It is more difficult for them to tell the meaningless items in DIT2. 5. Since Chinese culture thinks less of laws and norms, Chinese participants favour personal interest schema more than maintaining norms schema."
