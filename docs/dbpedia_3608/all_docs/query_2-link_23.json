        "text": "All newly admitted students must take two pre-assessments before starting their first semester in the MBA program. The results of these pre-assessments will be used to improve the MBA program and will not impact your admission. The first pre-assessment is the Defining Issues Test (DIT-2) which focuses on the interrelationships between society, business, and government. The second pre-assessment is the Major Field Test (MFT), which examines current business knowledge.\n\nDefining Issues Test (DIT-2)\n\nThe Defining Issues Test, or DIT, is a device for activating moral schemas (to the extent that a person has developed them) and for assessing these schemas in terms of importance judgments. The DIT has dilemmas and standard items, and the subjectâs task is to rate and rank the items in terms of their moral importance. As the subject encounters an item that makes sense and taps into the subjectâs preferred schema, that item is rated and ranked as highly important. Alternatively, when the subject encounters an item that either doesnât make sense or seems simplistic and unconvincing, the item receives a low rating and is passed over for the next item. The items of the DIT balance âbottom-upâ processing (stating just enough of a line of argument to activate a schema) with âtop-downâ processing (not a full line of argument so that the subject has to âfill inâ the meaning from an existing schema). In the DIT, we are interested in knowing which schemas the subject brings to the task. Presumably, those are the \"bedrock\" schemas that structure and guide the subjectâs thinking in decision-making beyond the test situation.â\n\nSource: https://ethicaldevelopment.ua.edu/measures-of-ethical-development.html\n\nMajor Field Test (MFT)\n\nThe Major Field Tests (MFTs) are comprehensive undergraduate and MBA outcomes assessments designed to measure the critical knowledge and understanding obtained by students in an academic major. The Major Field Tests go beyond the measurement of factual knowledge by helping you evaluate your students' ability to:\n\nanalyze and solve problems\n\nunderstand relationships\n\ninterpret material from their major field of study\n\nAs the only comprehensive national assessment for program evaluation of its kind, this test consists of 124 multiple-choice questions, half of which are based on short case-study scenarios. Questions employ materials such as diagrams, graphs and statistical data. Mathematical operations do not require a calculator. Most of the questions require knowledge of specific information drawn from marketing, management, finance and managerial accounting, or a combination of these."
