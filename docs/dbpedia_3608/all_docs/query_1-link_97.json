        "text": "hardware and/or software that acts as a user agent, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents\n\nNote\n\nfunctionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g., voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and content transformations (e.g., to make tables more accessible).\n\nNote\n\nAssistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents by using and monitoring APIs.\n\nNote\n\nThe distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute. Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities. The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing markup into identifiable bundles.\n\nscreen magnifiers, and other visual reading assistants, which are used by people with visual, perceptual and physical print disabilities to change text font, size, spacing, color, synchronization with speech, etc. in order to improve the visual readability of rendered text and images;\n\nscreen readers, which are used by people who are blind to read textual information through synthesized speech or braille;\n\ntext-to-speech software, which is used by some people with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities to convert text into synthetic speech;\n\nspeech recognition software, which may be used by people who have some physical disabilities;\n\nalternative keyboards, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities to simulate the keyboard (including alternate keyboards that use head pointers, single switches, sip/puff and other special input devices.);\n\nalternative pointing devices, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities to simulate mouse pointing and button activations.\n\ntext or other component with a text alternative that is presented to a user to identify a component within Web content\n\nNote\n\nA label is presented to all users whereas the name may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology. In many (but not all) cases the name and the label are the same.\n\nNote\n\nThe term label is not limited to the label element in HTML.\n\ndetermined by software from author-supplied data provided in a way that different user agents, including assistive technologies, can extract and present this information to users in different modalities\n\nText that is programmatically associated with non-text content or referred to from text that is programmatically associated with non-text content. Programmatically associated text is text whose location can be programmatically determined from the non-text content.\n\nNote\n\nRefer to Understanding Text Alternatives for more information.\n\na part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function\n\nNote\n\nMultiple user interface components may be implemented as a single programmatic element. \"Components\" here is not tied to programming techniques, but rather to what the user perceives as separate controls.\n\nNote\n\nUser interface components include form elements and links as well as components generated by scripts.\n\nNote\n\nWhat is meant by \"component\" or \"user interface component\" here is also sometimes called \"user interface element\".\n\na non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a user agent\n\nNote\n\nAlthough any \"other resources\" would be rendered together with the primary resource, they would not necessarily be rendered simultaneously with each other.\n\nNote\n\nFor the purposes of conformance with these guidelines, a resource must be \"non-embedded\" within the scope of conformance to be considered a Web page."
