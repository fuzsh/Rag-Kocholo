        "text": "Attention paid to moral judgment and reasoning in the business ethics literature has dramatically increased over the past decade (Trevino, 1992). Accompanying this emerging research focus is the increased usage of two dominant moral reasoning instruments: the Moral Judgment Interview (Colby and Kohlberg, 1987) and the Defining Issues Test (Rest, 1979). Each of these measures significantly differ in their theoretical foundation, what hey are capable of measuring, how they are appropriately used, and their respective advantages and limitations as a research instrument. Confusion regarding these aspects of the instruments could lead researchers to improperly select the wrong measurement given the research objective, inaccurately administer the instrument, or incorrectly analyze the data collected. In an effort to guide future moral reasoning researchers, we discuss in this paper the underlying theories, objectives and capabilities, and advantages and limitations of the Moral Judgment Interview (MJI) and the Defining Issues Test (DIT). We believe that a clearer understanding of the instruments will enhance future business ethics research investigating moral reasoning.\n\nTHEORETICAL FOUNDATION\n\nLawrence Kohlberg\n\nThe moral development theory underlying both the MJI and the DIT was developed by Lawrence Kohlberg (1969, 1973, 1976, 1981, 1984), although James Rest expands beyond Kohlberg: in developing the DIT. Kohlberg and his associates attempted to understand the moral development of individuals from childhood to adulthood by periodically assessing the highest stage of moral reasoning expressed by the subjects. These observations led Kohlberg to develop a six stage model of moral development. The critical perspective underlying: Kohlberg's model is the identification of the reasons given why certain actions are perceived as morally just or preferred. As he subjects express distinctly different moral rationales, these rationales are captured in the different stages of moral development.\n\nKohlbergian research identifies three levels of moral development: preconventional, conventional, and postconventional (see Figure 1). (Figure 1 omitted) Each level is comprised of two stages of reasoning. The second stage represents a more advanced and organized form of the first stage within each level. The three levels are briefly summarized below (for a more\n\nLevel 1: Preconventional Stage 1: Punishment and Obedience Orientation Stage 2: Instrumental Relativist Orientation\n\nLevel 2: Conventional Stage 3: \"Good Boy--Nice Girl\" Orientation Stage 4: Law and Order Orientation\n\nLevel 3: Postconventional Stage 5: Social--Contract Legalistic..."
