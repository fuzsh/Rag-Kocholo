        "text": "Background\n\nAbout the TB skin test\n\nThe TB skin test is a test used to determine if a person is infected with TB bacteria. In this test, a standardized solution made with purified protein derivative (PPD), which is derived from tuberculin, is injected under the skin.\n\nTypically, PPD produces a T-cell mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction if the person has been infected with TB bacteria. In most people who have TB infection, the immune system will recognize the PPD because it is derived from proteins that are excreted by M. tuberculosis growing in specialized media under standardized conditions. PPD is diluted to standard concentration and potency in FDA-approved testing solutions. It takes 2 to 8 weeks after initial infection with TB bacteria for the immune system to be able to react to PPD and for the infection to be detected by the TB skin test.\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages of the TB skin test\n\nAdvantages\n\nSimple to perform (e.g., no laboratory equipment required)\n\nLow cost\n\nNo need for phlebotomy\n\nWell-established definitions of TB skin test conversions\n\nLegacy of decades of clinical and epidemiological research\n\nDisadvantages\n\nRequires trained personnel to administer and interpret\n\nRequires correct refridgeration and an inventory plan for the skin test solution\n\nRequires two or more patient visits\n\nPrevious BCG vaccination or infection with nontuberculous mycobacteria can cause false-positive results\n\nConcurrent infections can cause false-negative results\n\nRare adverse effects\n\nCan cause booster phenomenon\n\nSubject to biases and errors with TB skin test placement and reading\n\nWho can administer and read TB skin tests?\n\nThe TB skin test should be placed (administered) and read by a designated, trained health care provider. Consult with your state and local public health authorities to determine who is authorized to place and read TB skin tests in your state.\n\nTB skin test training materials\n\nTraining is essential for health care providers to gain proficiency in the administration and interpretation of the TB skin test.\n\nCDC has free training materials on reading and administering the TB skin test, including a fact sheet, wall chart, and video. Materials are available for download or to order (within the United States).\n\nDetermining an approach\n\nCDC has resources to help health care providers talk to patients about TB testing and treatment.\n\nCDC guidelines recommend using TB blood tests to test for TB infection in most cases. However, TB skin tests are an acceptable alternative in situations where a TB blood test is not available, is too costly, or is too burdensome.\n\nMost people can receive a TB skin test. TB skin tests are contraindicated only for people who have had a severe reaction (e.g. necrosis, blistering, anaphylactic shock, or ulcerations to a previous TB skin test). TB skin tests are not contraindicated for any other persons, including infants, children, pregnant people, or people with HIV.\n\nTB skin tests should not be performed on people who have written documentation of a previous positive TB test result (TB blood test or TB skin test) or treatment for TB disease. Most people who have a positive TB test result will continue to have a positive test result. Additional TB skin tests will probably not contribute to medical care, regardless of the result.\n\nHealth care providers should take into account the following factors when considering the TB skin test for a patient:\n\nAge\n\nCurrent CDC guidelines recommend the TB skin test as the method of testing for children younger than 5 years of age, while noting that some experts use TB blood tests in younger children. Health care providers may choose to consult the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidance on the use of TB blood tests in children.\n\nBacille Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) TB vaccine\n\nThe BCG vaccine may cause a false-positive TB skin test reaction. There is no reliable way to distinguish a positive TB skin test reaction caused by BCG vaccination from a reaction caused by true TB infection.\n\nWhen using the TB skin test, people who have been vaccinated with BCG should always be further evaluated for latent TB infection or TB disease as if they were not vaccinated with BCG. TB skin test reactivity caused by BCG vaccine generally wanes with the passage of time, but periodic skin testing may prolong (boost) reactivity in vaccinated people. TB skin test reactions should be interpreted based on risk stratification regardless of BCG vaccination history.\n\nHealth care providers treating children who have been vaccinated with BCG should also know that tuberculin reactivity is likely during the first two years after BCG administration to the newborn.\n\nMultiple BCG doses (as practiced in some countries) increases a person's sensitivity to the TB skin test and the duration of positive TB skin test results after BCG administration.\n\nBCG vaccination does not induce positive results when TB blood tests are used. TB blood tests are the preferred test for people who have received the BCG vaccine, including children.\n\nBoosted reactions and two-step testing\n\nA boosted reaction can occur in previously infected, older adults whose sensitivity to tuberculin has decreased over time. It also can occur in persons of any age who have been vaccinated with BCG or infected with mycobacteria besides M. tuberculosis complex. When given a TB skin test years after infection, these persons may have little or no reaction, giving a negative skin test result. However, the TB skin test may stimulate the immune system, causing a boosted reaction with a positive result after subsequent tests. The TB blood test does not boost subsequent test results.\n\nTwo-step testing is a strategy used to reduce the likelihood that a boosted reaction will be misinterpreted as a recent infection if the person has to be tested again. Two-step testing should be used for the initial (baseline) skin testing of persons who will be retested periodically.\n\nIf the TB skin test is used for baseline testing of U.S. health care personnel, use two-step testing.\n\nTwo-step testing\n\nIf the first TB skin test result is negative, a second TB skin test should be done 1 to 3 weeks later.\n\nIf the second TB skin test result is positive, it is probably a boosted reaction.\n\nBased on this second test result, the person should be classified as previously infected. This would not be considered a skin test conversion or a new TB infection.\n\nHowever, the patient is a candidate for treatment for latent TB infection.\n\nIf the second skin test result is negative, the baseline result is negative, and the person would be classified as uninfected.\n\nVaccinations\n\nLive virus vaccination\n\nVaccination with live viruses, including measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, varicella, and yellow fever may interfere with TB skin test reactions. For persons scheduled to receive a TB skin test, testing should be done:\n\nEither on the same day as vaccination with live-virus vaccine or\n\nAt least one month after the administration of the live-virus vaccine\n\nOther vaccinations\n\nVaccination with inactivated viruses doesn't interfere with TB skin test reactions.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccination should not be delayed because of testing for TB infection. TB skin tests are not expected to affect the safety or the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. Testing for TB infection with a TB skin test can be done before, during, or after a COVID-19 vaccination visit."
