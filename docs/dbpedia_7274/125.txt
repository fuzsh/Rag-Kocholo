Savyasachi Anju Prabir holds a B.Cr.A in Film and Contemporary Arts Practice from the Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology, Bengaluru and an MA in Visual Anthropology from the University of Muenster, Germany. At present, Savyasachi is Associate Faculty in the Department of Film and Video Communication at the National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad.

He is keen on using text, sound and image to create multimodal works and bring a reflexive and collaborative methodology to academic and artistic practice. Drawing inspiration from the circadian rhythms of his environment, he wishes to arrive at new ways of artistic research and production. There is a pronounced overlap between his artistic practice and teaching methodology that he intends on carving and sculpting in the coming years.

Savyasachiâ€™s films have won four awards and have been screened at over 30 international film festivals. His image and sound based works have been shown at galleries in the UK, Netherlands, Germany, Portugal and India. He is the recipient of the Early Career Fellowship from TISS in 2016, the Generator Cooperative Art Production Fund from Experimenter, Kolkata in 2020, the Inlaks Fine Art Award 2021 and the Goa Open Arts Catalyst Grant 2021-22.
