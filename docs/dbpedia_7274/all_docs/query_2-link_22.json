        "text": "After a series of flops, Naga Chaitanya tasted success with his recently-released film Shailaja Reddy Alludu. The film released alongside his wife Samantha's U Turn on September 13.\n\nNow, Naga Chaitanya is back with an action thriller titled Savyasachi. This film marks the second collaboration between Chaitanya and Chandoo Mondeti. The film boasts of a stellar cast including Naga Chaitanya, Madhavan, Nidhhi Agerwal and Bhumika Chawla in the lead roles.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSavyasachi has been in the making for over a year and was postponed a couple of times. Initially, the film was slated to release in March 2018 and got postponed to a later date due to a delay in the post-production work.\n\nSavyasachi is finally hitting the theatres on November 2 this year and it looks like it is the only big film to occupy the theatres across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.\n\nThe concept of Savyasachi looks interesting. Here are five reasons to watch the Naga Chaitanya and Madhavan-starrer:\n\nVANISHING TWIN SYNDROME\n\nSavyasachi is the first ever Telugu film to deal with the Vanishing Twin Syndrome. The term is used to describe the phenomenon where a twin pregnancy is detected at an early stage, but only one baby is eventually born. In the film's trailer, we see Chaitanya's character struggling to get his left hand to do what he wants it to do.\n\nSpeaking about his character, he says, \"Whenever my character is angry or excited, his left-hand goes out of his control and into the control of the twin he absorbed in the womb. We've used this special quality of his to make the film highly entertaining.\"\n\nHowever, many Tamil film buffs have pointed out that Savyasachi's theme is similar to that of the Tamil film Peechankai, in which the hero's left-hand goes out of control.\n\nMADHAVAN'S DEBUT\n\nThough Madhavan made a cameo in 2010 Telugu film Om Shanti, Savyasachi is the first Telugu film where he will be seen in a full-fledged role. Interestingly, he plays a villain who is angry and determined to kill his enemy (Naga Chaitanya).\n\nFor this venture, Madhavan has learnt his lines and dubbed in Telugu for the first time. It will be interesting to see what Maddy brings to the table with his negative character.\n\nMOTHER SENTIMENT\n\nUsually, films with the mother sentiment work well at the Telugu box office. It looks like Savyasachi will also deal with a similar theme. In a tweet, Chaitanya revealed that the song Okkrante Okkaru is about a mother's love for his unborn son. He also appreciated composer MM Keeravani for capturing the soul of Savyasachi through this song.\n\nA DE-GLAM NIDHHI AGERWAL\n\nBollywood actress Nidhhi Agerwal is foraying into the Telugu film industry with Chandoo Mondeti's Savyasachi. It is said that the actress will be seen in a de-glam look for the film. In the trailer, she is seen portraying the role of a simple yet independent girl. Her look in the film has got fans excited and many stated that they're waiting to see Nidhhi and Chaitanya's on-screen chemistry.\n\nNAGA CHAITANYA AS ARJUNA\n\nNaga Chaitanya's character in Savyasachi is inspired by Mahabharata's Arjuna. The makers recently revealed Chaitanya's look as Arjuna and it has already won the hearts of his fans.\n\nSources reveal that he will be seen as Arjuna for nearly five minutes in the film. It looks like this is the short portion with Vennela Kishore, and is said to be a laugh riot.\n\nALSO SEE | Naga Chaitanya-Madhavan's Savyasachi rakes in Rs 10 crore even before release"
