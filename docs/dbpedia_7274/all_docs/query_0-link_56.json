        "text": "Written and directed by Chandoo Mondeti, Savyasachi is a 2018 Telugu-language action thriller movie. Vikram’s world isn’t quite his own — a touch he can’t control, a past he can’t recall; his invisible twin, Aditya, holds the reins of his left hand. When Vikram’s life takes a dangerous turn, the line between him and his phantom brother blurs. Can one man fight with two shadows, or will a deadly secret tear him apart?\n\nHere’s how you can watch and stream Savyasachi via streaming services such as Amazon Prime Video.\n\nIs Savyasachi available to watch via streaming?\n\nYes, Savyasachi is available to watch via streaming on Amazon Prime Video.\n\nVikram suffers from a strange condition: his left hand seems to have a mind of its own. Diagnosed with vanishing twin syndrome, he discovers his twin brother, Aditya, whom he cannot see and who controls Vikram’s left hand. His life takes a dramatic turn when things begin to get violent. To save himself and his loved ones, Vikram must find the connection to his ghostly twin and confront his past.\n\nThe cast of Savyasachi features Naga Chaitanya Akkineni as Vikram and Aditya, the twin brothers. On the other hand, R. Madhavan plays the role of Arun Raj, Nidhhi Agerwal appears as Chitra, and Bhumika Chawla essays Siri.\n\nWatch Savyasachi streaming via Amazon Prime Video\n\nSavyasachi is available to watch on Amazon Prime Video.
