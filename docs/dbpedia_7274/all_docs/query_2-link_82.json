        "text": "Karthikeya director Chandoo Mondeti dares to explore a subject with Savyasachi which was never attempted before, Vanishing Twin Syndrome, and makes Naga Chaitanya the protagonist of the story. Having watched numerous flicks in Indian cinema which had lead actors play dual roles, Savyasachi had high expectations on it because of the first-of-its-kind trajectory. But this subject is a tricky one to be tried in a commercial arena like Tollywood and will test any filmmaker's ability.\n\nNaga Chaitanya plays the protagonist, Vikram Aditya, who has the syndrome and often ends up in situations dominated by his vanished twin brother, Aditya. After his birth, doctors tell his parents that Vikram Aditya is one in a million case since the other twin Aditya, when in mother's womb, has interlaced itself and the neurons of the vanished twin are still active in his brain extended upto the left arm. Doctors also advise that Aditya will have all the feelings a human being has and can express and react to every emotion via the left hand of Vikram. On the other hand, R Madhavan, playing Arun Raj, is a guy who is seeking revenge for the humiliation he has faced in career and personal life. The life of these two gentlemen cross paths and unfold a series of events and which breaks the family of Vikram Aditya, in the process. This forms the crux of the plot in Savyasachi and lays the path for the forthcoming events that happen in the life of Vikram Aditya and Arun Raj.\n\nAs Savyasachi begins, a group of people are traveling in a bus on the ghastly roads of Himachal Pradesh. As it may seem weird, a conversation between two passengers about Arun is overheard by another and turns out that she knows that Arun as well. And adding more curiosity, the rest of the passengers too known Arun personally making it an interesting premise to begin with. Losing control, the bus goes off road and falls deep into the valler and here comes the twist. Naga Chaitanya too is in the bus.\n\nNaga Chaitanya's first attempt at an experimental subject almost convinces you that he has evolved as an actor but en route, makes you think twice about it. Chay has put his best acting foot forward in scenes which depict the syndrome. But the actor seems to be still finding his foot when it comes to enacting emotional and melodramatic scenes. But on a larger picture, Savyasachi brings out the best in Naga Chaitanya. R Madhavan makes a thumping debut in Tollywood with Savyasachi and pulls off the role effortlessly. Nidhhi Agerwal, playing Vikram Aditya's love interest Chitra, has very little to offer in the plot but her half-pie appearances in song and few romantic scenes do not go unnoticed. A mediocre presence of Bhumika Chawla as Vikram Aditya's sister might disappoint you but the role does have prominence in the plot.\n\nWhat's Hot:\n\nNaga Chaitanya, in all the scenes of depcition of the syndrome, leaves you mighty impressed and the bar raises with each scene. With no hesitation, it can be said that the comic scenes involving Vennela Kishore, Sathya, Shakalaka Shankar, Vidyu Raman and Naga Chaitanya are a major highlight in Savyasachi and will leave you in splits throughout. Madhavan's portrayal as the revenge-seeking ruthless man stands as the pillar post the break and his encounters with Naga Chaitanya are portrayed very well. An episode during Naga Chaitanya's college days where they enact the scene of 'Subhadra Parinayam', although a bit stretched, is one of the examples why comedy is an important element of any commercial potboiler in Telugu. Background score by veteran M.M.Keeravani is another asset to Savyasachi and the Baahubali composer brings all his experience to the table to portray the boundless emotions of Vikram Aditya and the uncontrolled Arun Raj.\n\nWhat's Not:\n\nAs the dots connect and Naga Chaitanya decides to confront Madhavan, it gets a bit stretched and makes us feel a bit lost. At times, one may feel that Madhavan might have been wasted in few scenes and those may have been actually avoided. Few scenes kick off in emphatic fashion raising our expectations but eventually fade out leaving us disappointed. As we all hate to do, the film does test your patience at few junctures and make you wait for the end.\n\nBL Says: Savyasachi with the Vanishing Twin Syndrome as the core subject does impress you in parts but eventually loses track en route. We go with a 2.5 for Savyasachi!\n\nStay tuned to BollywoodLife for the latest scoops and updates from Bollywood, Hollywood, South, TV and Web-Series."
