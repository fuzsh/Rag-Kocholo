        "text": "Tollywood audience are eagerly waiting for Naga Chaitanya and Chandoo Mondeti's 'Savyasachi' movie. With the concept of Vanishing Twin Syndrome, the film has been creating a decent pre-release buzz.\n\nBut, a section of netizens from Tamil Nadu are trolling the makers. The reason behind it is the similarities of it with Tamil movie Peechaankai (means Left Hand).\n\nThe film is based on Alien Hand Syndrome which is a rare left-hand syndrome. However, 'Savyasachi' is different as the protagonist here has a rare twin syndrome where twins share the same body.\n\nAlso, 'Savyasachi' is an action flick whereas 'Peechaankai' is a dark comedy film. Of course, the only common point is the left-hand concept.\n\n'Peechaankai' was released in June 2017. So, the Tamil audience might have spotted the similarity and started trolling. Anyway, 'Savyasachi' is slated to hit the screens on Nov 2nd and is expected to clear the air."
