        "text": "Naga Chaitanya is a damp squib with plenty of eye-rolling that doesn't really go with the mood of the circumstances. He only thrives in dance sequences.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1/5 | Nov 2, 2018\n\nThe frustrating part about Savyasachi is watching how little it achieves despite having an interesting premise. It could have been cracker of a film, but it isn't quite so.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/5 | Nov 2, 2018\n\nWhen it's revealed why exactly Arun holds a grudge, it unfortunately comes as a fizzle instead of a bang.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/5 | Nov 2, 2018\n\nIn the end, this is a film that even Madhavan cannot make better. Here is one honest question for the makers: why make a film that looks like a farce even on paper?\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 1/5 | Nov 2, 2018"
