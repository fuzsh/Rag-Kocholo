        "text": "Savyasachi‘s promotional material released so far has raised the bars of expectations on Naga Chaitanya as a hero. The special effect of the left hand in the film is the main attraction of the film to go with what we got from the teaser and the trailer. But it seems that the “left-hand” effect is not throughout the film.\n\nAlso Read – Harish Shankar: Biggest Culprit Behind Mr. Bachchan’s Negativity\n\nNaga Chaitanya revealed that it was not much difficult to finish the role of the man whose left-hand acts independently and out of his control as the effect won’t be there all over the film. The director has put the leftie special only in the vital portions of the film like entertainment and action yet making it interesting.\n\nWell, everyone was actually expecting a lot of the left-hand thing in the film and it turns to be different. Anyway, Madhavan’s role and the special left-hand feature of the film have gone well with the viewers making it a worth a trying film which is going to hit screens on this Friday."
