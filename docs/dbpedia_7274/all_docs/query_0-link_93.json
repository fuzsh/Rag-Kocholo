        "text": "First Half: Decent. Sets up the story. Few entertaining moments and good romantic track.\n\nSecond Half: First 30 minutes goes down. SubradaParinayam onwards - movie picks up the tempo. Good.\n\nOverall. Decent to just about good.\n\nStory: How a guy, having vanishing twin syndrome, saves his family from a psycho is the overall story.\n\nPerformances: Naga Chaitnya was very good. His performance and dances (especially in \"laggaittu\" song) are very good. He did actions scenes with very much ease, which is a big positive for the movie. He could have enacted few of the emotional scenes better though.\n\nNidhi agarwal look very glamorous. Her peformance is adequate for a debut heroine in telugu. \"Laggaittu\" song is a feast with her dance moves and looks.\n\nMadhavan did a very good job as a pyscho. Although, we disconnect with his voice. The dubbing was good for him - but somehow it didn't evoke that much of an effect.\n\nBhoomika as NC's sister is decent. Her dialogues in pre-climax are superb.\n\nVennela kishore, Shakalaka Shankar etc are decent. Rao Ramesh is okay. Kousalya play's NC's mother with good emotions.\n\nThe little girl plays the pivotal part in the story - should have chosen a girl who could have emoted better.\n\nDirection: Chadoo has taken a rare concept of Vanishing twin syndrone and weaved a regular commercial story around it. He handled the first half decently with few enetrtaining momements - but sill maintained the suspense factor. He unfolds the story is second half and connects all the dots. His story telling and screenplay, especially in second half was good. Although, things seemed a little hurried and there were few inconsistencies as well. The initial part of second half seemed overboard. He handled the massy, action episodes very well. Thanks to him, all elevation scenes worked out wery well for NC. NC fans and masses will enjoy these elevations very well.\n\nMusic: Keeravani's BGM was excellent. It elevated many scenes in second half to the next level. Songs could have been better. Savyasachi tiltle song is the pick of the lot.\n\nAction and stunts are very well conceived.\n\nCinematography very good. Production values by Mythri are superb.\n\nAnalysis: After 1 hour long college-breakup-reuniting regular romantic track with few entertaining episodes, NC (having Vanishing Twin Syndrome) faces an unexpected incident in his family and finds out that a mystery man is behind this. How NC unfolds the mystery forms the rest of story.\n\nFirst half has few good entertaining parts, decent romantic track. Interval sets up the mystery. First 30 minutes of second half - especially the confrontation scenes seemed a little stretched. This is where the movie could have been a lot better and director messes things up.\n\nBut post Subrada Parinayam episode ( which might seem like lame critically, but might work very well for a regular TFI audience)/ and \"Lagaittu\" song ( which has been conceived and looks very good onscreen) - the movie picks up tempo. As the story unfolds things become a little interesting. All the elevation scenes in the later part of second half are the biggest highlights of the movie.\n\nNothing about the movie is excellent or wow. Everything is in mediocre and adequate portion- romance, entertainment ( few scenes in first and second half), a regular and okayish romantic track, okayish family drama, interesting plot and finally - good elevation scenes.\n\nOverall the movie is a seemingly interesting and slightly suspense story laced with mediocre entertainment/romance, and very good elevation scenes for NC.\n\nBox office : May work with audience who like - regular commercial massy entertainers.\n\nMy Rating: 5.5 + 0.5(for elevation scenes) = 6/10\n\nP.S: The biggest problem with movie are expectations. When once talks about an very interesting concept like - Vanishing Twin Syndrome - audience expect a novel movie experience. But Chandoo puts that main concept on the back burner and comes up with a regular - hero/villain - commercial entertainer."
