        "text": "Savyasachi directed by Chandoo Mondeti is generating tremendous interest with the unique Vanishing Twin Syndrome concept. However after watching the teaser and trailer many are wondering whether Savyasachi will make wonders at box office like Chandoo Mondeti's first film Karthikeya?\n\nThe trailer and teaser showed commercial elements and doubts are increasing whether the forced commercial elements will spoil Savyasachi's Vanishing Twin Syndrome essence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSavyasachi has remix version of the song 'Ninnu Roadu meeda choosinadi lagayatu' and it is surprising that concept based films having such a mass song. Chaitu and Nidhi looked massy in the song and Chandoo said the song will appear in the second half and give relief to movie lovers.\n\nMany are wondering why audience seek relief in a serious entertainer. Chaitu's problem is though he is getting good image with romantic entertainers, he is desperate for a mass action image and score blockbusters. He has been trying his luck with action, commercial masala elements and got shocks but still is not learning from his mistake."
