The gossips like NagaChaitanya’s left hand does not listen to him, created a lot of expectations among the audience for the movie ‘Savyasachi’.\r\n\r\nThe duo, NagaChaitanya & Chandu had previously given a hit cinema ‘Premam’, which is also a reason why the expectations for this movie are high.\r\n\r\nMytri Movie Makers have always given blockbuster cinemas and that is yet another solid reason for Savyasachi to be extremely high in expectations.\r\n\r\nSo has ‘Savyasachi’, lived up to the expectations? Let us see!\r\n\r\nStory:\r\n\r\nVikram (NagaChaitanya) is an Ad Film maker & Aditya, who can be felt in left hand is present within Vikram only. Aditya has all the emotions, however all of them are expressed only through Vikram’s left hand only. Vikram accidently meets ex-lover Chitra ( Nidhhi Agerwal) after six years. They recollect their sweet memories from college life and also go to New York City for their next Ad shooting. On returning, Vikram finds his sister’s family (Bhumika’s family) is attacked & his niece is kidnapped.\r\n\r\nWho has kidnapped Vikram’s neice? Why has he kidnapped? What is the relation between Vikram and the kidnapper? Forms the movie story.\r\n\r\nAnalysis:\r\n\r\nAs expressed, the concept is very good but the story telling and narration is not up to the mark. The original story will actually start during the second half while first half is all about comedy ad love! Vanishing Twin Syndrome has not been used properly or rather not required in this movie. Vennela Kishore’s comedy is the only fresh breeze during the first half.\r\n\r\nThe mind game in second half is not much engaging but pre climax scenes are good. Two songs in first half were shaped up well.  In second half there is a nice remix song but it was badly timed. As a director, Chandoo has failed to impress the audience with his narration this time.\r\n\r\nMytri Movie Makers mark is felt lavish during the songs and action scenes. Keeravani’s music is good.\r\n\r\nPerformances:\r\n\r\nNagaChaitanya’s character required energy and charisma to which he has done complete justice. And what can we specifically tell about Madhavan’s acting skills? As a villain, he has done a complete magic. With this movie, Madhavan has announced that he can act as a villain too. Nidhi Agarwals’s role is very small but even in those she looks beautiful. As an elder sister, Bhumika has done a decent job. Vennela Kishore and Satya’s combination created good humor while Shakalaka Shankar’s comedy was okay too.\r\n\r\nAll in all, everyone just did their bit well.\r\n\r\nPlus Points:\r\n\r\nNagaChaitanya\r\n\r\nMadhavan Acting\r\n\r\nVennela Kishore Comedy\r\n\r\nConcept of the Story\r\n\r\nMinus Points:\r\n\r\nFirst Half\r\n\r\nDirection\r\n\r\nVerdict:\r\n\r\nDirector Chandu Mondeti has written his story well but he failed to narrate the same story to the audience who had a lot of expectations from this movie. NagaChantanya & Madhavan’s acting are the only strong points for the movie. You can watch the movie once, if you like either of them.\r\nBut please forget logic while watching the movies.\r\n\r\nRating : 2/5",
