        "text": "A twin brother of the protagonist is absorbed due to Vanishing Twin Syndrome and controls his left hand. When his life is threatened, the twin brother that never existed protects him like a shield.\n\nVikram Aditya is a guy who suffers from alien hand syndrome where the left hand does not be in his control most of the time. On the other hand, Vikram falls in love with Chitra(Niddhi Agarwal) and when things seem to be going absolutely fine, his life turns upside down as his brother in law gets killed and his niece gets kidnapped. Rest of the story is as to how Vikram saves his niece and where does Madhavan feature in this entire setup.â€”Shiva Prasad Reddy"
