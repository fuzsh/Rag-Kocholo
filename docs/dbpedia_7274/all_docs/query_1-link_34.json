        "text": "Vinesh Phogat’s disqualification from the Paris Olympics 2024 has sent shockwaves around India as the wrestler was one step short of winning gold at the showpiece event. On Tuesday, she assured a silver medal for India after beating Yusneylys Guzman of Cuba in the semi-final. The 29-year-old wrestler was scheduled to lock horns with Sarah Hildebrandt of the United States in the gold-medal clash.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBut on Wednesday, it was learned that she was disqualified after being found 100 grams overweight than the permissible limit during the weigh-in. From once having a chance to win gold, Vinesh had to return empty-handed from Paris without a medal. During this while, questions in social media were doing the rounds about whether Vinesh could have retained her silver medal by faking an injury.\n\nAs per Article 11 of the United World Wrestling, “If an athlete does not attend or fail the weigh-in (the 1st or the 2nd weigh-in), he will be eliminated of the competition and ranked last, without rank (Exception: cf. Article 56 – Medical Service Intervention.”\n\nAlso Read: Vijender Singh on Vinesh Phogat disqualification: Conspiracy against India\n\nWhat does the Medical Service Intervention say?\n\n\"If an athlete is injured and can’t continue the bout, he will lose the match by injury. The concerned athlete won’t have to attend the second weigh-in and he will be ranked based on the points that he earned until his injury. If the injured athlete is ready to compete for his next match, he has to receive the approval of the UWW Doctor.\n\n\"For all the other type of injuries or diseases that happen after the first day of competition and out of competition, the concerned athlete will have to attend the second weigh-in otherwise he will be eliminated of the competition and ranked last, without rank,\" it said.\n\nParis Olympics 2024: India Schedule | Full Coverage | Medal Tally\n\nIt's as clear as it can get. Vinesh Phogat could not have claimed an injury after winning all her first three bouts on Tuesday, Day 1 of the competition. In fact, only in 2017, the UWW amended rules for weigh-in on both days of the competition. Before that, the weigh-in happened only on Day 1.\n\nGoing by the rules, had Vinesh claimed an injury and did not attend the weigh-ins, she would not have retained her silver medal. Cuba’s Guzman, who was supposed to play in the bronze-medal match, was named as Vinesh’s replacement as the second finalist.\n\nAfter Vinesh was disqualified, Sakshi Malik, who won bronze in Rio 2016, remained India’s only female wrestler with an Olympic medal.\n\n'India won't fake an injury'\n\nAthletics Federation of India Adille Summarivala lashed out at the conspiracy theories, saying India would never fake an injury.\n\n“From the little wrestling that I know, the only grace you can get if you are injured. if in the previous bout, you got an injury, that is the only way you can get grace, and she was not injured. I don't think the Indian contingent could have proved she was injured, and I don't think India is going to fake an injury. I am sorry. I will be there for anything but I will not be a part of that,” he added.\n\nTune In"
