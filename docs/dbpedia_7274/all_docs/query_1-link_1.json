        "text": "Savyasachi is the new title of Naga Chaitanya's next film with Chandoo Mondeti. The movie is releasing on 14th June as off now.\n\nThe movie team has already started promoting the film and Naga Chaitanya is spearheading them.\n\nHe shared a image on Twitter talking about who can be called as Savyasachi and what will he do in the film.\n\nSavyasachi, means Ambidexter. A person who can use both hands with equal power. The image stated that out.\n\nAlso, Savyasachi is a name given to Arjuna, to be exact fifth, because of his ability to hit the target using both hands with a bow and arrow. That is, he can release an arrow with same speed with his right hand and also with his left hand.\n\nEven Naga Chaitanya in this film, will use both his hands to face the challenges in his path in the film.\n\nMM Keeravani is giving music to this Mythri Movie Makers production. Nidhi Agerwal is acting as the lady lead and Madhavan is debuting in Telugu with the film and Bhoomika is acting in an important role."
