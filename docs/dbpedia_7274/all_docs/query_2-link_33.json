        "text": "Director Chandoo Mondeti's Telugu movie Savyasachi (also spelt as Savyasaachi) starring Naga Chaitanya, R Madhavan and Nidhhi Agerwal, has received positive review and rating from the audience.\n\nSavyasachi is an action film and director Chandoo Mondeti has written the script for the movie, which is produced by Naveen Yerneni, CV Mohan, Y Ravi Shankar under the banner Mythri Movie Makers. The flick has received a U/A certificate and it has a runtime of 2.30 hours. Savyasachi movie stills.\n\nSavyasachi movie story: Savyasachi means Ambidextrous, which means a person able to use the right and left hands equally well. As the title suggests, the movie is about a twin brother who is absorbed by Naga's character in the womb and controls his left hand. Unscientifically called the Vanishing Twin Syndrome. How this issue helps the hero forms the crux of the movie.\n\nPerformances: Naga Chaitanya and R Madhavan have delivered good performances, which are the highlights of Savyasachi. Nidhhi Agerwal looks glamorous and her chemistry with Chay is good. Bhumika Chawla, Vennela Kishore, Dishita Sehgal, Rao Ramesh, Thagubothu Ramesh and Bharath Reddy have also done good jobs, say the audience.\n\nTechnical: Savyasachi had decent production values and MM Keeravani's songs and background score, J Yuvaraj's cinematography, action choreography and dialogues are attractions on the technical front, add the viewers.\n\nSavyasachi movie review live updates: We bring you some viewers' reaction to the film shared on Twitter. Continue to see the audience's response.\n\nRaghava‏ @Raghava4mahesh\n\n#Savyasachi : Outstanding first half content,screenplay,comedy everything has worked @chay_akkineni @AgerwalNidhhi lead pair chemistry is superb pre-interval song super Interval scene @ActorMadhavan #Savyasachi : Chandoo Mondeti pakka Akkineni fan screenplay champi avathala essadu 100% love, Tadakha,RRVC, Savyasachi Best career first half's for @chay_akkineni career Nag films references,Varasudu movie style lo college scenes fans ki goosebumps Hello Brother ki twin characters ela big plus ayyindo #Savyasachi ki Vanishing twin Syndrome ante range lo plus ayindi content, Mass fights, entertainment @chay_akkineni one's best entertainer padindi it's a definitely watchable #Savyasachi movie my rating 3.25/5 @chay_akkineni @AgerwalNidhhi @ActorMadhavan @MythriOfficial @mmkeeravaani perfect executions in screenplay and entertainment supporting characters all are worthy Skit comedy follows Allari Alludu remix song aaa tharvatha mass fight @chay_akkineni #ChandooMondeti addeskunaruu fans ki kavalisina stuff untudhi #Savyasachi\n\nVAMSI KRISHNA Paladu‏ @VPaladu\n\n@vennelakishore Bhayya just done with the movie #Savyasachi what an acting bhayya you are just amazing with ur dialogue delivery You just rocked in the drama scene you are our generation bramhabandam The movie is excellent bhayya congrats for the success @MythriOfficial The success track carries on just done with the movie #Savyasachi The movie is so good and the locations in the movies remind us how much effort and money the production has given The movie is definitely a pre diwali winner congrats for the success @chay_akkineni It's been so long for me to see you in the success track which I felt you got it without any negative talk on the movie.Just done watching the movie #Savyasachi You are brilliant with the work it's so difficult to handle the left hand and you made it possible Congrats for the success Chai really feeling so happy for you the best awaited hit after your marriage Your hard work is paid off waiting for some more movie ahead which always shows you the success Chai @AgerwalNidhhi Just loved your performance in the movie #Savyasachi you look so cute and gorgeous The character is so apt for you in the movie you just killed me with your expressions ❤ Congrats for the success\n\nSrikar Chagarlamudi‏ @chsrikar777\n\nFirst half : entertaining & getting into characters (hit 1st half) Second half : blockbuster ; u can see never before @chay_akkineni #Savyasachi title song goosebumps #family #emotion #sentiment #bgm #action #comedy #thriller all in one #BlockbusterSavyasachi This fight sequence was all done & dusted by left hand only #PowerOfSavyasachi this one fight is more than all previous @chay_akkineni fights ... #Savyasachi anipinchukunadu #BlockBusterSavyasachi\n\nNaga Sravanthi‏ @Sravanthicuty\n\n#Savyasachi #SavyasachiOnNov2 First half good with excellent interval bang... #Savyasachi #SavyasachiUSAonNov1st Good first half and superb 2nd half. @chay_akkineni handsome and so much ease in action episodes. @ActorMadhavan main pillar of the movie.
