        "text": "The ‘first punch’ of Naga Chaitanya-starrer Savyasachi is out this morning and the first impressions are quite impressive. The striking poster piques curiosity instantly as it showcases Chay in an intense avatar and those tattoos on his many hands create a sense of suspense about what the film has in store.\n\nIn Savyasachi, Chay’s character has a special ambidextrous trait which gives him a rare skill of using both his hands effectively. Savyasachi’s shoot is heading towards its completion. Premam fame Chandoo Mondeti is directing this high concept thriller. Bollywood starlet Nidhhi Agerwal is the leading lady in Savyasachi. Madhavan and Bhumika will be seen in crucial roles.\n\nMM Keeravani is composing music for Savyasachi. Mythri Movie Makers is bankrolling the project. The film is slated to hit the screens on June 14.\n\nArticles that might interest you:"
