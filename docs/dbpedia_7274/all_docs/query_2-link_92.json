The film has been directed by Chandoo Mondeti and produced by Mythri Movie Makers of Rangasthalam fame.\n\nReports are doing the rounds that the filmmakers want to reshoot some key scenes of the film. “The producers and the director recently watched the film, and they want to make a few changes to it. They have expressed that some scenes need improvement, and so they may reshoot them,” a source reveals.\n\nNaga Chaitanya, who is busy working on multiple projects, has already completed the dates allotted to Savyasachi. The film’s release date has been announced as July 12, but it may be postponed by a few weeks. Apart from the reshooting of scenes, some graphic work also remains to be completed."
