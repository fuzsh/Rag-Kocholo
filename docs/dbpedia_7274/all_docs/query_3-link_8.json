        "text": "Alien Hand Syndrome - a disorder where one of the hands (usually the left) has a mind of its own - is the biggest spark in this movie. Why the movie is called Savyasachi, which as the Wiki-page suggests, means ambidextrous, I could not understand. But, the title of a movie is usually not so important, so let's ignore that.\n\nWhy the alien hand has almost Thor-like superpowers, with the neurons reddening each time, is something I could not understand. But, such theatrics are not so important, so let's ignore that. The doctor tells the protagonist's mother about his disorder and suggests a solution - get rid of the neurons in the alien hand - but she decides against it. I would rather have two sons, she says; why an alien hand which is unpredictable can be treated as a second son and why it will always protect her son is a sentiment I could not understand; but emotional decisions are not so important, so let's ignore that.\n\nThe movie meanders along till the interval, developing a chemistry-less love story between Chitra (Nidhhi Agerwal) and Vikram Aditya (Naga Chaitanya). She falls in love with him because he beats a bunch of college seniors ragging her to pulp. She forgets he was harassing her as well, but apparently - and this is a dialogue in the movie itself - if the hero pursues a girl, she may fall for the hero, but if the villain pursues a girl, she will definitely fall for the hero. But such 'fun dialogues', are not so important for a movie; so let's ignore that.\n\nThe movie uses Vidyullekha Raman (yet again!) just for fat-shaming jokes, almost defining her career, but let's ignore that. The protagonist is an ad-maker who spends most of his time with his friends (Vennela Kishore) and pampers his niece (the one aspect of the movie, that's not as deplorable as the rest). In the pretext of making an ad-film, the hero and heroine get an opportunity to go to the US - but such tropes are not so important, so, let's ignore that.\n\nThe movie finally comes to a point when it introduces Arun Raj (Madhavan) who is psychopathic and out for revenge against Vikram Aditya. Madhavan does his best to operate within the constraints of the 'Telugu movie villain' cliche, and he does well; almost. Except for the dubbed voice - the standard factory-settings voice we are now used to hearing in every movie. Why couldn't Madhavan dub for himself, considering for the sensible audiences, he was the movie's biggest draw, I wonder. But, the villain's voice and dialogues are not so important, so let's ignore that.\n\nArun Raj's biggest aide keeps praising Vikram without knowing anything about him. But the over-dramatisation of the hero's powers is common. Let's ignore that. In short, the writer has a brilliant idea; imagine all the things you can script around the Alien Hand Syndrome and what do we do? Use it like a henchman to beat people up. That the most creative 'apparently funny' thing the director thought a hand out of your control could do is slap the posterior of an unsuspecting woman passing by, shows the paucity of thinking and sensibility. A cringeworthy skit on Mahabharata, just when Madhavan builds up the intensity of the story, shows how the movie-makers have no clue what to do with the idea.\n\nThat Madhavan could be reduced to a caricature like this is hurtful; so, let's ignore that. That Vennela Kishore almost feels like the one with most screen presence is something to ponder - but, let's ignore that. The heroine. Everyone involved in the making of the movie has ignored her already. It is almost as if the person who had the idea is not the same as the person who made the movie. Alien Mind Syndrome? All this talk of rationality by now seems pointless in this movie. So, let's ignore that.\n\nDisclaimer: This review was not paid for or commissioned by anyone associated with the film.
