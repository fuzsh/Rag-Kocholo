        "text": "The much-awaited action thriller Savyasachi is all set to hit the screens on Friday. The making of the movie video which was released on October 24 have already garnered huge viewership. According to sources in the film unit, young hero Naga Chaitanya is playing a different character who is suffering from a rare disorder called ‘vanishing twin syndrome’ where his left hand goes out of control!\n\nNidhi Agarwal is paired opposite Naga Chaitanya in the film being directed by Chandoo Mondeti. There were also rumours that Savyasachi was inspired by 2017 Tamil film Peechaankai. Seasoned actors R Madhavan, Mukul Dev and Bhumika Chawla are also playing important roles in the film. Interestingly, Savyasachi is Madhavan’s Tollywood debut, though he made a cameo appearance in a 2010 Telugu flick.\n\nThis will also give an image makeover to the Akkineni scion as his character is much different from his usual lover boy roles. In an interview to an English daily recently, Naga Chaitanya himself termed it as an ‘unchartered territory’.\n\nFor Hyderabad-born Nidhi, this is her Telugu debut too, though she acted opposite Tiger Shroff in Munna Michael, a Hindi film directed by Shabbir Khan last year.\n\nTelugu film buffs across the globe are eagerly waiting for the release of the movie produced under the banner of Mythri Movie Makers. Noted music director MM Keeravani has composed the songs. Major parts of the film was shot in the US."
