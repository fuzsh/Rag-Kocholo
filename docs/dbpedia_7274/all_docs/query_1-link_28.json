        "text": "Let's get super-big picture for a second. \"AI is killing music\" \"Film is dead\" \"No one watches TV anymore\" \"There's no money in photo / music\". All of these things are true, but only if you're looking through the wrong end of the telescope. Historically, everything arts based is siloed. The music industry treats the visual arts terribly. In turn, film and TV rarely pay music licensing what it's worth. Film, music, tv, photography have all be commodified and cheapened by apps and technology. Yet we're all still eating each other for profit. A unified approach to The Arts Economy starts at home. Pay your freelancers fairly and transparently. Respect other brands you work with. Change paradigms that have existed since the mid-20th century (looking at you, ad agencies). If the arts worked fairly and transparently together, the value proposition to those accessing them would be so much stronger. Which yes, sounds a bit like communism, but it's probably a lot better than ASOS paying photographers £50 a day, record labels offering £500 for a music promo, Newspapers offering £60 to license a photo nationally, ad agencies paying production companies £800 for global rights licensing, and brands not having an f'ing clue about how any of it works. #AI #ContentRights #Licensing #creative\n\nBeing the one responsible for bringing creative minds together is a double-edged sword. This past week I witnessed the completion of a project between one of my publishing clients and a producer that I communicate and work with frequently. It was a recommendation that I brought to the table from my network. Even though this project is successfully complete, I also hope that it's the beginning of a fruitful relationship between both individuals. It couldn't have gone any better. They worked remotely and they got along wonderfully. Above all, the project was completed quicker than expected, and everyone involved was very happy with the results. This is the outcome I always hope for, especially if I'm responsible for the introduction. I've also experienced the flipside more than once. Ughhh. Worse yet, is if the individuals you bring together are all your clients! This is where you have to be extremely careful. What could go wrong? - the final product is not to the liking of one or more of the persons involved - there is a communication breakdown - there is a disagreement with the percentage splits - maybe someone ghosts someone else for any number of reasons I learned all of this the hard way, through first hand experience. If only one individual is your client, then it may be easier to come out of the situation unscathed. When one or more are your clients, this is where conflicts of interest can come to play a major role in how everyone else involved perceives the outcome. Though some of the relationships between individuals were adversely affected, I was able to mitigate any direct undesirable outcomes with my clients through transparent communication. Calling people out where they needed to be called out, and apologizing for my missteps whenever appropriate. Working with creatives is beautiful and inspiring. It can also be easy to get carried away with grand ideas that seem like they work, in theory. In a practical sense, the outcome is not always perfect, and you should be prepared for this. When it comes down to the nuts and bolts of executing an idea between various clients, or a client and another individual, be sure to view the possible outcomes from all angles. There is no way to get it right every single time, but at least the homework you did will get you ready with a Plan A, B, C... Bringing people together is an important part of representing songwriters and developing artists. It shouldn't be avoided because of the possible downsides. Rather, it should be viewed as a growth tool and a moment of creation for all involved.\n\nI've realised at this point there's about 8 distinct skills that any artist manager needs 1. Big Picture Thinking: This will always be the most important point of all. It's about working with the talent on how you see the next few years shaping out. What are the goals to hit and what's the path that needs to be taken to get there. More often than not, this often involves a lot of brainstorming, guidance, and compromise with the talent. 2. Day-to-day management: This is fundamental to keeping a working relationship one that's lively and also communicative. Talking to each other every day goes miles in improving the relationship and making sure that you know each and every thing that's going on. 3. Understanding The Recorded Music Business: From knowing how to value your artists IP to negotiating deals with Record Labels or Distributors, understanding the ecosystem of recorded music is essential to getting the most valuable IP the right price. It also gives you the ability to go fully independent and DIY when you feel the label deal isn't up to the standard that you need. 4. Content Creation or Production Talent: Even if you're not a videographer or editor yourself, knowing how to identify the right talent/locations/stylists/crews/etc who can produce content that's going to elevate the artists presence is critical in a visually sensitive consumer base. 5. Digital Marketing: From knowing how to run a basic Meta/YouTube/Google ad to also brainstorming creative campaign ideas, CTA ideas, and innovative social media posts, being on top of digital marketing end-to-end is one of the only ways you're going to be able to influence significant growth for your artists. 6. Booking Agent: A skill that's probably one that most managers today know inside and out because of the fast and immediately transactional nature of it, being able to negotiate the best deals for live shows and pitching your artists for the right gigs and festivals will always be one of the largest revenue drivers. 7. Basic Legal Skills: You might not need to be a qualified lawyer, but being able to properly go over lengthy contracts is a must-have skill for any manager the second you start engaging in larger deals with bigger brands or labels. 8. Publicity: I used to confuse this with marketing but the simple difference here is that publicity refers to placing your talent in the right spots. Whether that's getting on a magazine cover, talk show, or anything else in the media universe, it adds layers of credibility and opens the talent to new audiences. For big name artists, they probably have one person to do each of these roles. But when you're building from ground zero, it's a useful checklist to just know the basics of each of these so you can start to build out an artist 360. #musicindustry #artistmanagement\n\nYOU SUCK...WHY MOST PROFESSIONAL CREATIVES AREN'T PROFESSIONAL. OR TRULY CREATIVE. The other day my Nashville music friend Tom threw out a post on Facebook about the financial demise of professional artists that got me (and many others) pondering. He said, “What should I do, spend more time practicing on becoming the best guitar player (he already is) or settle for mediocrity by getting myself a tat sleeve, mohawk and a tit ring and pretend being a cool music hipster?” Here was my response… “The real answer is simple. \"Musicians are often not financially successful because they suck at their craft or they don’t treat their brand and product like a consumer business (that requires certain skills in management, finance, operations and most of all marketing and sales). “Now if you get the tit ring — which I think would look devilishly handsome on you — write that down on a piece of paper, roll it up and shove into said tit ring to keep it close to your heart. \"Love, Phil.” Of course all of this was written in good fun but the reality is deadly serious: most artists suck at self-promotion. It’s not in their NDA. And if they don’t suck at the marketing side they probably suck at the finance or operations side. Period. This sounds harsh but it’s true, and most artists will admit it. But there are examples for artists to follow. Two of them are my friends -- Bonnie Block, whose photography hangs on the hallowed walls of the Smithsonian Institute...

And join in the fun if you choose. But our goal is to literally provide a performance and revenue platform to create work for our artists, and you could be one. Through our programs like 'Short Wave Stories' and our ASMR project 'Echoes of the Everyday,' our music programs like '60-Second Song Surprise: Bursts of Delight.' Our Community Theater of the Mind is hoping to create and produce a community-created audio drama in late 2024. And of course Studio Jijiji's production of 'Song in Space,' our mainstream audio drama/animation/video game is already in production. This is an evolving project, but it's success rests with the writers, producers, voiceovers, musicians, and sounds designers who participate. We're looking for partners, particularly partners who love soundtracks, voices, music and the ephemeral engagement they create with listeners. If interested reach out to me directly. For those of you who don't know me, I am one of the most successful track directors of the last twenty-five years. My company McHale/Barone defined music and radio branding. We produced thousands of audio productions. I then went on to a career in animation and video games. This project is returning me to my first love, a passion that stretches all the way back to my apprenticeship at the BBC in London. My goal is to return control and profit of our work to participating artists. 2023 defined the problem. With the encroachment of AI and the collapse of Hollywood profit models, it really felt like artists were on their own. I'm a veteran union member, and the union did the best they could, but to me the writing is on the wall. We need to control our work so we can control our deals. It's as simple as that. So please visit our site and join, watch, learn, participate and advise. VoiceOver artists, composers, sound designers, mixers, producers, people just interested in innovation, let's build an artists first digital colony from the ground up. I promise you, together we can bring authentic innovations to the table. Please read out to me here on this social platform with questions, or through jijiji. love in tone and groove, chris https://lnkd.in/gE5EdCJf\n\nIt's 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗮𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱𝘀: background music + voice overs! Why some video and social ads grab your attention while others just... don’t? A little secret (and some experience) from our video ad production. We've been there multiple times... 𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲’𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝘆 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗹𝗲𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗮𝗱𝘀 𝗿𝘂𝗻 𝘀𝗶𝗹𝗲𝗻𝘁: 🟢 Sounds captivate your audience and keep them watching. 🟢 Even simple sound design makes your ads look (and sound) polished. 🟢 Music and voices help convey emotions and messages better. You might think adding these is complex and costly...💸💸💸 But (these days) it's not. 𝗕𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝗺𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗰: ✅ You can buy a premium track for as low as $50-100 ✅ There is plenty of free music available ✅ You can try to generate music with AI → Where to look: YouTube Audio Library, Pixabay, Bensound, Uppbeat, etc. 𝗩𝗼𝗶𝗰𝗲-𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀: ✅ Hire a professional voice actor for as low as $50-200 ✅ You can try to generate VO with AI → Where to look: Fiverr or local actor platforms/services. AI text-to-voice - ElevenLabs or similar. ❌ There may be struggles with AI VO and \"smaller languages\" 𝗦𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁𝘀: ✅ Buy a sound or two (if you have a budget) ✅ There are plenty of free sounds to use ✅ Record your own sounds (if your budget allows) ✅ You can try to generate sound effects with AI → Where to look: Pixabay, Storyblocks, ElevenLabs for AI, or similar. To sum up, your ad performance and impact depend on the quality of your ad. Background music, voice-over, and sound effects can be added without any big challenges these days. AI is also handling quite a lot of stuff really well lately. There is no reason why your ads need to run silently in the background. Think about sound design as part of your ad creation effort. Even minimal sound design will make a positive impact. #adguns #creativeproduction #voiceovers #sounddesign #soundeffects\n\nSo why is Ringo., in my opinion, a so-called no-brainer for our industry? I had a very refreshing meeting with Marcel and Nicholas, who presented Ringo. as a super easy-to-use and helpful tool to evaluate the resources one needs when clearing existing tracks. The process of clearing music that one considers to accelerate your brand/product/campaign is time-consuming, involves communication, and often feels intransparent. I personally assume that the demand for existing tracks for brand usage to emotionalize and differentiate might increase in an environment where literally everyone can create a track via AI themselves in minutes. First of all, it’s easy to use and provides a solution to a process that is usually complex, instantly at your fingertips. Second, it’s of interest to all parties involved in the marketing and production field. It enables agencies to sense (feasibility) check tracks whenever they consider content with existing music before presenting it to their clients. It enables companies with an artist-centric marketing approach to support the planning & negotiation process since they get value indicators. Editing houses can provide additional intel when screening for music to support their edits and performance. Production companies, through their R&D teams and post producers, can provide intel to support the director’s/creator’s/creative’s music asks. Music companies, when either considering remastering or screening for tracks on a given briefing. In short, here's why I think it’s so great. 👉 It adds a fast and clean solution to a challenge that is usually intransparent and time-consuming in an industry where we have to move at the speed of light, work on budgets, and manage expectations. 👉 It democratizes access to knowledge at a very early stage for multiple new user groups (marketers/creatives/strategists/producers/...). 👉 It might be a chance to increase sync projects for artists because of a low threshold. So it’s very likely that this could support business for artists/publishers/labels. Excited to see Ringo providing value to the game! 🌐🔥 #MusicInAdvertising #InnovationInProduction #ProductionConsulting #ContentConsulting #SimplifySync #AmplifyCreativity #ElevenDown #19989ToGo\n\nHow to edit a spec ad that converts Determine speed First I'd like to say, speed might be the major factor in whether or not you've got your prospect's attention. You're building a narrative that you believe people should be taken by, so keep in mind that narrative's tone, and think hard about what cuts it needs in order to shine. Some videos will start with quick cuts, others with slow edits to match the poetic voiceover. Sound FX Nature sounds, impacts, clicks, whooshes, swings, etc... will give your film motion and an artistic push to let your audience really 'feel' your work. In a Coca-Cola ad, you'll always hear the sounds of an opening can, gulping, and a refreshing \"Aaaahhh\" from someone, and it's what makes us feel AND want a cold, refreshing Coke on a hot summer day. Never leave your soundfx out! Music Music is mood. So I wouldn't use a pop song over a funeral home advertisement, but will deep-search for those slow violin and cello tracks. Before editing your video, before dropping anything on that timeline, choose your track wisely, it will either make or break that artistic vision you got for your project. Narration Now I wouldn't go on and 'literally' describe what the business or service is about in bullet point style. Some might bring it in the form of poems, some will pose questions, others will make important statements, and some might even read out client testimonials. That voice, or those voices, will speak directly to your prospects and must tell them what they've been needing to hear (not what they just 'want' to hear, deception isn't what we're going for). Sometimes before purchasing an item, hiring a freelancer, etc... people would need to hear their concerns spoken out to them in a tone that guarantees them client satisfaction. A strong spec ad tells your audience why they should take the dive and go for it. A weak spec ad reminds them of the last scam they've trusted. Here is a spec ad I've made for reference!"
