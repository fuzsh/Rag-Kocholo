        "text": "Savyasachi is Telugu actor Naga Chaitanya's second release in a span of two months. His previous flick Shailaja Reddy Alludu did average business at the box office. Now, the actor is desperately hoping for a hit film in his career.\n\nChaitanya's film Savyasachi, which released on November 2, opened to mixed reviews from critics. According to trade pundits, the film has taken a decent opening at the box office. On its opening day, the film has garnered Rs 3.29 crore in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.\n\nadvertisement\n\nTrade analyst Taran Adarsh revealed that the film had a great start from the premiere shows in the US. He wrote, \"Telugu film #Savyasachi starts on a positive note in USAThu previews $106,606 [Rs77.35 lakhs]/122 locations. Will be interesting to see how it fares over the weekend. (sic)\"\n\nSavyasachi did a pre-release business amounting to Rs 22.5 crore including overseas distribution rights. However, it is rumoured that the theatre occupancy rate for Savyasachi is going downhill due to mixed reviews.\n\nDirected by Chandoo Mondeti, Savyasachi features Naga Chaitanya, Madhavan and Nidhhi Agerwal playing the lead roles.\n\nALSO SEE | Savyasachi Review: Interesting premise ruined by weak writing"
