        "text": "Chandoo Mondeti is a talented director and there is no doubt in that. He has delivered one of the stunning movies for TFI with Karthikeya. He continued the success with Premam which has Naga Chaitanya in lead role as well. However Chandoo Mondeti like any other director has faced flop. He has teamed up for second time with Chaitu for Savyasachi.\n\nThe film ended up as a disappointment. Chandoo Mondeti revealed that there were blunders from his side which made the film flop.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInitially we agreed to make Savyasachi as a different entertainer. However we shouldnâ€™t succumb to commercial format which changed the dimension of the story. The decisions I had taken as a director failed miserably. However my friendship with Chaitu is intact. He calls me occasionally and we talk about interesting stuff going on."
