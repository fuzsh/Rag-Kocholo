Vikram is the only survivor of the accident. He has vanishing twin syndrome, which makes Aditya, Vikram's invisible twin brother, control his left hand.\n\nA few days after the accident, Vikram is shown to be an advertisement director with his assistant Kittu. The latter gets a client named Chitra. He reveals that she was his love when they were in college. He makes an ad that shows everything from the 80s to the 90s. The ad becomes a hit, and an ad company asks Vikram to take the ad to America. The latter takes the shot in America with Kittu as the director. Vikram then reconciles with Chitra.\n\nWhen Vikram comes back from America, he learns that his house exploded because of a bombed gas cylinder. He learns that his brother-in-law and his beloved niece Maha, died from that accident. Vikram gets overwhelmingly devastated but then learns that Maha is still alive and tries to find her. He learns that someone kidnapped Maha. With anger, Aditya kills all the men sent by the kidnapper and swears to find him. He tries to get help from a police officer, but gets nothing.\n\nWhen he goes to a DNA doctor, he learns that the same day when he admitted his pregnant wife to the hospital, the kidnapper sounded like a villager and kidnapped his wife. In order to save his wife, he signs the file in his hand. The next day, Vikram gets a death certificate of the DNA doctor. In order to find out who the kidnapper is, the kidnapper makes Vikram run to all the destinations while he chants devotional chants. While he was running, Vikram drinks water from a local train but later learns that the bottle was sedated, and he starts to sleep. When he is close to finding who the kidnapper is, he falls asleep. Chitra picks him up later on.\n\nVikram still recalls all the destinations he ran to and then learns that his name starts with A. To find out his connection with him, he searches for everything but learns that the chants he was chanting were marriage chants. He learns that he is Arun Raj Varma, his sister's almost-married husband. Vikram goes to his father to learn why he is like that. He learned that he had a bad life before and not marrying Siri, his sister, made him hungry for vengeance. Vikram investigates the places were he saw the unconscious boy, and the back window was full of dust. He dusts the window and sees the number 21.\n\nVikram then gets beaten up by a gang sent by Arun, but Aditya saves him. He goes to Arun's hideout, and Vikram and Arun engage in a fight, where Vikram sees Maha is in danger as she was going to fall on a machine. Vikram tries to save her, but Arun hits him with a statue. Vikram gets conscious, and Aditya fractures Arun's hand, beats him, and throws him on a TV. Vikram saves Maha by catching her after she falls. Arun, still injured, throws anchor on Vikram, but Aditya catches and throws back the anchor on Arun, killing him. Before dying, Vikram tells him that the person who creates change is a good person, but a person who destroys humanity is evil.\n\nIn the end, Vikram praises Aditya for saving him, but then Aditya touches a stranger, and Vikram apologizes. He pleads Chitra to tell her about the syndrome, but she gets mad at him and leaves him. Vikram then gets mad at Aditya.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nProduction and release\n\n[edit]\n\nSavyasachi entered its final stage of filming in July 2018. Post-production was wrapped up in September 2018.

It could have been cracker of a film, but it isn't quite so. The left hand packs a punch, but the narrative doesn't\".[8] IndiaGlitz gave 2.75 out of 5 stars stating \"'Savyasachi' is a routine drama involving a gutsy hero and an evil genius. It should have come with a fast pace. Some emotions work here and there\".[9] The Times of India gave 2.5 out of 5 stars stating \"Watch this one if you're a Naga Chaitanya or Madhavan fan, but definitely leave your brains at home for this one\".[10] India Today gave 2 out of 5 stars stating \"Director Chandoo Mondeti's Savyasachi could have been an intriguing thriller, but it is not. Weak writing and underwhelming characterisations spoil the film\".[11]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nSouth Indian International Movie Awards[12]\n\nNominated - Best Debut Actress - Nidhhi Agerwal\n\nNominated - Best Actor in a Negative Role - R.
