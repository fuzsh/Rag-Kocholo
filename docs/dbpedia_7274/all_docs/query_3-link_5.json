He takes morning runs in Central Park; walks through Times Square, looking up at the billboards like a little kid; dines at family-run Chinese restaurants, the kinds of places where he’s unlikely to be photographed with a mouthful of food. Whenever he sees anyone from South Asia, he veers in the opposite direction, hoping to avoid an awkward encounter. But run-ins are inevitable, as when a fan stopped him recently coming out of the Plaza Hotel — a doctor from India, eager to exchange a word with India’s most famous fashion designer.\n\nThis month, I sat with Sabyasachi — as he’s known in the industry — in a labyrinthine retail space on Christopher Street. The walls, dressed in nostalgic floral papers he designed, were lit by overlapping chandeliers with floral fabric shades. More than a million dollars’ worth of art, some of it from the 17th century, was stacked five frames deep against the walls. Sabyasachi was here for the decoration of what will soon be his first store in the West. Among the items of furniture being installed, the one closest to his heart was a massive, 12-foot-tall antique wedding chest made in Syria and inlaid with mother-of-pearl."
