        "text": "RESIDENCY 11:11 with Savyasachi Anju-Prabir\n\n​\"Hello, I'm Savya and I record everyday videos, sounds and images. Sometimes I make films out of them and sometimes I just play them back to myself. I am primarily interested in the everyday mundane and its reflections/influences on the lives of people across generations, cultures and sexes. At present, I am interested in exploring the relationships between photography/film as a medium, as a mode of representation and as a form of public archive/documentation.\"\n\nSavyasachi Anju-Prabir is an Indian artist working in the field of visual anthropology investigating ideas around identity, memory and personal histories. During his stay with Residency 11:11 in London he has been spending time doing research for his new film project concerning his own family history and their settlement in Mumbai as migrants after the Indian independence in 1947. His research explores the complexities of the diversity of south Asian cultures and investigates ideas surrounding memory and storytelling through video, sound, photography and text.\n\nDuring the evening, Savyasachi will be showing videos, photos and objects from his archive and sharing memories.\n\n​\n\nPlease join us on Tuesday 27.08.19 from 6pm for Savyasachi end of residency presentation.\n\nTuesday 27th August from 6-10 pm\n\nFB event: https://www.facebook.com/events/682227852203469/\n\nResidency 11:11: https://residencyeleveneleven.co.uk"
