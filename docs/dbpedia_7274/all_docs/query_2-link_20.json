Though it is coming with less gap, the storyline of the movie has excited the audiences and there seems to be enough stuff to entertain the audiences.\n\nDirector Chandoo Mondeti is responsible for this credit as the story idea he presented through the teaser and the trailer has excited the audiences, enough. His track record is quite good with a super hit ‘Karthikeya’ and a decent hit ‘Premam’.\n\nThis is the second time combination of Chaitanya with Chandoo Mondeti. There are certain comfortable vibes between the two and one can clearly notice that Chaitanya is looking more handsome than before.\n\nFor Chaitanya, this film’s success will add to his credits as one of the best among the second league of heroes in the Telugu Film Industry. If he can continue the success streak for at least a couple of films, he will be a minimum guarantee bankable hero.\n\nThe advance bookings of the film are very good that gives a clarity on the interest of the audiences on the movie. As the release is big, there might be good openings, as well.\n\nThe vanishing twin syndrome is a concept that has excited the audiences and we have to see how the director has weaved an interesting and entertaining story around it. The rest of things will follow if the concept is received well.\n\nIt’s time to know if Chai-chandoo’s combo has come to the audiences with a thorough entertainer, a concept-based movie.
