        "text": "Nidhhi Agerwal awaits the release of her first Telugu film, 'Savyasachi', on November 2. In this interview, she talks about the Naga Chaitanya starrer, learning Telugu, being an actor in the current times, and more.\n\nTell us about your background.\n\nI hail from Bengaluru with a strong Hyderabadi connection. Besides Kannada, I also know Telugu and Tamil fairly well. From being unable to speak a Telugu word, I can now frame sentences, albeit grammatically incorrect ones. I keep watching all kinds of movies and listening to Telugu songs. When I used to visit my relatives' places in Hyderabad, I would keep seeing the posters of Telugu films. It's not a different world for me.\n\nWhat is your academic background? Did you always want to be an actress?\n\nI have done my BBM and a small course in fashion. Then I started out to be a model. I always wanted to become an actor. I was trying to figure out as to how to become an actor. With my fashion knowledge, I do stitch things randomly at times.\n\nHow did 'Savyasachi' happen?\n\nDirector Chandoo Mondeti called me up after watching first Hindi film of mine. When I listened to the script, I felt it's quite new. The concept (of Vanishing Twin Syndrome) is totally different. That's why I accepted the film. It was such a big opportunity. Coming from nowhere, I got to work with such experienced people.\n\nIs your character long or short in the movie, given it's a thriller packed with actors like Madhavan and Bhumika Chawla?\n\nI shot for many many days. It's a well-rounded script and there is a love story, too. My character is established so well. I never had any fear of having less screen time. I am seen as an independent girl in the film. There come some twists and a few characters walk into the story. A baby girl, for example. There are Vennela Kishore and Sathya, the comedians.\n\nHow has bgging 'Savyasachi' and 'Mr. Majnu' changed you?\n\nDoing the films has opened up a new world for me. I listen to Telugu songs nowadays. It's great because I always had so much respect for southern film industries. I am not a trained actor. I am new and learning on the job.\n\nHow was it working with Naga Chaitanya?\n\nChaitanya is sweet and very talented as an actor. The character is very difficult to act naturally and he did it so well. He is always positive, always smiling. Every day was a happy and learning experience. The director would take care of every detail. For example, the blood has to look natural for him. The trailer looks very powerful.\n\nYou are acting opposite another Akkineni hero - Akhil - in 'Mr. Majnu'. How is the experience?\n\nSince they come from the same family, they share some similarities. The two films are completely different. The vibe on the sets is different. There were overlaps and on a lot of days, I shot for the two films on the same day.\n\nSince you have loved the concept of the ambidextrous hero, do you find it incredible?\n\nWhen I was born, I was left handed but my parents converted me to right hand. I could write with both hands but I was not ambidextrous. It took me some time to understand the concept of 'Savyasachi'. When I asked Chandoo sir if it exists for real, he said 'Ya'.\n\nAre you looking forward to playing strong roles as in 'Pink', etc?\n\nEvery character is different, regardless of the industry. These days, girls are getting very good characters, be it in Hindi or Telugu. It's not just about glamour, cute, etc. It's a great time to be an actor."
