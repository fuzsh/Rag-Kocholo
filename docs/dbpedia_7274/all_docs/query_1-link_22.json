        "text": "Synopsis\n\nCrafted by the renowned fashion designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee, this saree, described as \"a tribute to the Garden of Time – a celebration of art and eternity,\" was envisioned to transcend time. Meticulous attention was dedicated to intricate embroidery and delicate beadwork. This saree was a culmination of dedication and passion, brought to life by the collaborative effort of 163 individuals over a span of 1965 hours!\n\nShe came. She saw. She conquered the Met Gala. Bollywood diva Alia Bhatt was a vision, a poetry in motion, as she stepped onto the green-tinged carpet in an ethereal mint-green Sabyasachi saree.\n\nTaking to Instagram on Tuesday, the ‘Gangubai Kathiawadi’ star dropped some photos of herself dominating the Met Gala red carpet and in a long post, gave an insight into the making of the dress. Designed by the iconic fashion designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee, the sari, which she described as “ a call to the Garden of Time – an ode to art and eternity…”, was designed to be timeless. Special focus was exerted on intricate embroidery and delicate beadwork. The saree was a labour of love, brought to existence by 163 people over 1965 hours!\n\n“Our colour palette pays homage to nature’s beauty, echoing the earth, sky, and sea… It has taken a collective effort of 163 dedicated individuals, including master craftspeople, embroiderers, artists, and dyers, investing a total of 1965 man-hours to create this ethereal saree. As I wear this outfit, I feel incredibly grateful to embody this exquisite creation, a testament to boundless love and painstaking effort…” she praised.\n\nThe saree was created to match this year’s Met Gala theme ‘Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion’. It came with a foot-long train that showed off-hand-woven floral designs made from silk floss, glass beading, and semi-precious gemstones.\n\nIn an interview with Vogue, the ‘Raazi’ star explained why she zeroed in on this Sabyasachi creation for her second Met Gala appearance. “What drew me to this look was the sheer audacity of it—how it merges traditional craftsmanship with avant-garde aesthetics.”\n\nThis year, the Met Gala theme was a rejuvenation and celebration of vintage styles. The dress code ‘Garden Of Time’ followed by celebs has been inspired by a short story penned by JG Ballard.\n\nInternet Reacts To Alia’s Ethereal Look\n\nBhatt’s fairy-tale-like look for her second stint at ‘fashion’s biggest night’ was, on the whole, appreciated by netizens. Photos of the superstar went viral on X. “Alia Bhatt carried the theme effortlessly at tonight's #MetGala, and showed how it's done!! Her impeccable style and the hard work of her team easily earned her the Best Dressed title, of course..” wrote one X user.\n\n“The cultural representation is unreal, alia bhatt you will always be famous #metgala #aliabhatt..” gushed another fan.\n\n“#AliaBhatt looks Enthernal, like straight from the heaven..” tweeted another.\n\nLike earlier years, this year too, The event took place at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.\n\nBhatt made her Met Gala debut last year, in a pristine white gown, adorned with innumerable pearls, in line with the 2023 theme - ‘Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty’.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nThe Ola Electric story: What makes Bhavish Aggarwal India's most impatient man?\n\nHNIs invested in Piramal PMS.
