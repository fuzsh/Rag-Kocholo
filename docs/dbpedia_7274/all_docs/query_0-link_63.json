        "text": "The trailer launch event of ‘Savyasachi’ was held on Wednesday, i.e. on October 24 at Prasad Labs in Hyderabad. Director Sukumar has launched the trailer. Naga Chaitanya, producers Naveen Yerneni, Y Ravi Shankar and Mohan Cherukuri, music director MM Keeravani, cinematographer Yuvaraj and director Chandoo Mondeti were present at the event.\n\nNaga Chaitanya and Nidhhi Agerwal starrer ‘Savyasachi’ has completed all formalities and is all set to hit screens worldwide on November 2. The film is being produced by Naveen Yerneni, Y Ravi Shankar and Mohan Cherukuri (CVM) under the prestigious production house, Mythri Movie Makers with Chandoo Mondeti as director. Pan India star Madhavan is playing a key role and Bhumika will be seen in a an important role.\n\nOn this occasion, Sukumar said, “It’s a different and fresh subject in Indian screen. Every director loves to do a film with this kind of subject. Hero’s left hand won’t listen to him. I am feeling jealous of Chandoo Mondeti that he got this different subject. Chandoo is my favourite director. His fil ‘Karthikeya’ is one of my favourite films. Trailer is quite impressive. I wish ‘Savyasachi’ will become big success. Keeravani has given wonderful music. Savyasachi song is excellent. Producers Naveen Yerneni, Y Ravi Shankar and Mohan Cherukuri are stronger and faster decision makers. Naga Chaitanya looks handsome in the film. I wish the film will stand out as a good film in Naga Chaitanya’s career.”\n\nProducer Naveen Yerneni informed, “We are planning to arrange pre-release event on October 27. ‘Savyasachi’ has completed all formalities and is all set to hit screens worldwide on November 2.”\n\nMM Keeravani said, “Producers Naveen Yerneni, Y Ravi Shankar and Mohan Cherukuri are very friendly. Chandoo Mondeti is a man with good nature. I wish all the best to Naga Chaitanya. Yuvaraj garu has presented Chaitanya and Niddhi Agerwal beautifully. It’s a good sign that Sukumar garu has launched the trailer. The film will have pre-release event on October 27. All our singers will entertain you with life performances.”\n\nNaga Chaitanya said, “Thanks to Sukumar garu for launching the trailer. He has given a super hit film ‘100% Love’ in the starting of my career itself. Chandoo has narrated ‘Savyasachi’ concept when I was in Norway for shooting Premam song. I was very much impressed. He has given a hit film ‘Premam’ in my career. Mythri Movie Makers is a good production house. They trusted the content. Keeravani garu’s music is added attraction to the film. The film has ensemble cast of Madhavan and Bhumika. It’s a biggest production in my career. Generally, people would call us to wish after the release of the film, but for the first time, people called me after the release of the first song and said that they are eagerly waiting for the movie. This credit goes to Keeravani garu.”\n\nHere is the trailer:"
