        "text": "In our interview with R. Madhavan, he spoke at length about how he picks his projects and why he chooses to do so few films. Speaking about his upcoming films, the actor said he was looking forward to his Telugu film Savyasachi with Naga Chaitanya. \"There is grandeur, this grandness to it. And there is an intelligence to the script that is a prerequisite for films.\"\n\nThe actor, who was recently seen in Amazon Prime Video-thriller Breathe, said that the movie is a fun film that renders itself most to \"community watching\". \"If there is a film that I want to see, and I can afford to see it at home without having the compelling factor of enjoying it with a crowd of people, then I would. Savyasachi is not one of those.\"\n\nHe also said it is the first \"straight Telugu\" film he's ever done and that his role is almost a guest role. \"It's been a long time since I looked not scruffy and kind of neat and clean in a film. So I somehow felt I should indulge myself in something like that. I'm very excited about this.\""
