The highly anticipated pre-Diwali release features an ensemble star cast of Naga Chaitanya Akkineni, R Madhavan, Bhumika Chawla and Nidhhi Agerwal who makes her Telugu debut with this film. Veteran music composer M. M. Keeravani has composed the music in the film.\n\nThe trailer of Savyasachi has gathered phenomenal traction with 4.4 million views on the internet in less than a week. The film focuses on the story of a young man who suffers from the Vanishing Twin Syndrome, a rare phenomenon where a twin pregnancy is detected at an early stage, but only one baby is eventually born, leading to twins sharing the same body.\n\nSpeaking on the announcement, Sunil Lulla, Managing Director, Eros International Media Ltd said, “We are excited to collaborate with Mythri Movie Makers and come on board this one-of-a-kind film with a unique story that promises to be a mass entertainer. Savyasachi is filled with enthralling twists backed by an acclaimed star cast and makes for a perfect Diwali release.\n\nWe recognize the great content emerging from south Indian cinema and our association with Savyasachi reiterates our focus on our regional expansion plans.”"
