        "text": "Now that there are just a few hours to go before the release of Savyasachi, some interesting snippets from the film are coming out one by one. The latest we hear is that the second half of the film will be quite thrilling.\n\nThere will be a massive showdown between Madhavan and Naga Chaitanya as a cat and mouse game kind of scenario will be showcased. All the action scenes have come out quite nicely say the sources from the team.\n\nChay will be seen in a true action avatar for the first time and we need to see if this film brings him back in the game after the low response to his last film Sailjareddy Alludu.\n\nArticles that might interest you:"
