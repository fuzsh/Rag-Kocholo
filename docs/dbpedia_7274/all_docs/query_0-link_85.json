        "text": "Director Chandoo Mondeti is all set to direct Naga Chaitanya once again after they successfully collaborated for Premam. The title of their upcoming film was released on Wednesday.\n\n“We decided to name it Savyasachi. It’s an action entertainer,” said director Chandoo, explaining, “In my film, the protagonist — played by Chaitanya — has powers in both hands and is ambidextrous, hence the title Savyasachi.”\n\nThe director also reveals that the shooting of the new film will begin from around mid-September. Both his earlier films Karthikeya and Premam were hits and this will be his third film for the director after the two successes.\n\n“The film’s story revolves around Chaitanya’s character, and the troubles he faces in life. How he clears hurdles forms the crux of the story,” says Chandoo, adding that the bound script is ready and that the shoot is all set to begin. “However, we haven’t finalised the female lead yet,” he reveals."
