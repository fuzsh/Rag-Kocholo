And sometimes, rarely, something brings you to tears of amazement at the heart- wrenching improbable beauty and pain that can intertwine. It brings you to your knees. The heart breaks, the shell of protection is cracked open, the position of “knower” is exploded.\n\nWell ... This happened to the few who were privy to the unfolding of this story. The extraordinary and magical connection was by email, in just a few days, in little more than a month, but its unraveling paints a rainbow of feeling and lifts time out of its predictable framework. It blows open the mind. One tries to find words.\n\nThis rare and beautiful and touching interchange is a communication, a dialogue between two souls that tells the amazing story, the correspondence between Guha and a young woman in Europe. Not one word has been altered.\n\nPS. (Year 2024) : \"Song of the Sparrow\" continues a year later much to everyone's surprise. The last chapter of this 2nd edition reveals it all!"
