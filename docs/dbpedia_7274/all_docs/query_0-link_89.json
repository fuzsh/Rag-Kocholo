        "text": "Savyasachi opened to mixed talk all over on yesterday and the result is out. The good number of pre-bookings couldn’t maintain the pace after the first day. The movie actually had a special attraction in the form of Madhavan, who is very selective in signing films being a stellar performer.\n\nAlso Read – Prabhas-Hanu: Why Is Iman Esmail Trending?\n\nEven Naga Chaitanya said he got more confident about the film when Madhavan who is stringent in choosing the scripts nodded his head for the film. But here the director’s lack of vision and the grip on the script failed to utilize him wisely to make the plot more interesting.\n\nBoth the director and the hero expressed their confidence in portraying the role of Madhavan as a villain for the first time in Telugu and had expectations for him to become the driving force of the success. Now, looking at the way how the star’s role has come out, we wonder if the actor has already guessed the fate and stayed away from promotions. What do you think?"
