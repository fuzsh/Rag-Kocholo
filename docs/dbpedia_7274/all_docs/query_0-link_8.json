        "text": "This particular film premise is fortunately in the realm of fantasy.\n\nWhen googling one can find stories of a 'vanished' twin apparently coming back, very early within the pregnancy of various levels of survivability, (I found only cases of living but brain dead fetus')\n\nHowever there are no documented cases of a vanished twin that wasn't fully absorbed in their twin or turned into fetus papyraceus, or some state in between. But rest assured, not alive enough to have thoughts and the ability to control body parts.\n\nThe premise is often confused with Split Brain Syndrome.\n\nAfter the right and left brain are separated, each hemisphere will have its own separate perception, concepts, and impulses to act. Having two \"brains\" in one body can create some interesting dilemmas. When one split-brain patient dressed himself, he sometimes pulled his pants up with one hand (that side of his brain wanted to get dressed) and down with the other (this side did not). He also reported to have grabbed his wife with his left hand and shaken her violently, at which point his right hand came to her aid and grabbed the aggressive left hand. However, such conflicts are very rare. If a conflict arises, one hemisphere usually overrides the other.1\n\nAs a TV trope, however I would say this an Organ Autonomy trope.\n\nThis trope is for when parts of the body have \"minds of their own\" and will control or influence the brain of whomever they're attached to."
