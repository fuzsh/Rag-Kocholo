        "text": "Chandoo Mondeti awaits the release of 'Savyasachi' on November 2. In this interview, he talks about the Naga Chaitanya starrer, how he stumbled upon the idea, working with the cast of the movie, his upcoming movie and more.\n\nHow did you chance upon the syndrome on which the film is based?\n\nA friend introduced me to the concept of Vanishing Twin Syndrome. As I learned about it, my curiosity in the syndrome only increased. It was exciting to know how those affected by the syndrome behave and how they react. I had a story in mind and, after reading about VTS, I developed the story a little more. When I gave Chaitanya a narration, he was visibly excited. The producers too were equally enthused about making the movie. This is when I started developing a script. We went to the sets only after we were convinced that everything was alright.\n\nWere you excited to do an action movie with Naga Chaitanya after a love story like 'Premam'?\n\nThe Akkineni family heroes are quite well-known for acing love stories. No love story done by Chaitu has ever failed to click at the box office. But when he listened to 'Savyasachi', he was very excited.\n\nBy instinct, I take pleasure in narrating stories like this one. I did 'Karthikeya' because it was novel. I am self-motivated to develop novel stories. I write and rewrite scenes to better myself. I did 'Premam' in the conviction that the love story would be quite apt for Chaitu. Otherwise, I am excited the most to work on thrillers.\n\nWhy the title?\n\nThe hero has equal strength when it comes to using his both hands. But the left hand behaves in its own way. Since the characterization is different, I chose the title 'Savyasachi'. Everyone from Madhavan garu to Bhumika garu and Nidhhi Agerwal wondered if those with the syndrome really exist.\n\nWhy Madhavan?\n\nAll the characters in the movie are so strong. Before choosing Madhavan garu, we had four other names in mind to play the antagonist. Madhavan garu is a pan-Indian actor. He is popular in Tamil and Hindi, too. He doesn't do average movies. He does only peculiar ones. I had given him a narration for 45 minutes. He liked it and accepted the movie. Our confidence in the script only increased with him coming on board.\n\nIt was an achievement to have someone like Keeravani on board. Isn't it?\n\nKeeravani garu coming on board was another shot in the arm. Editor Kotagiri Venkateswara Rao garu too was very specific about how to edit the film after listening to the story. Experienced people like them saying the story is very good increased my confidence.\n\nWhere does the remix song, 'Ninnu Road Meeda', fit in?\n\nThe first half is entertaining. The main plot thickens with the second half. The film then turns serious. Since the audience would expect some relief during such portions, I wanted to remix a hit number. I have infused the song in the second half without affecting the flow of the story. Keeravani garu has done it to suit the tastes of the modern audience. The audience will find the number quite energetic. We wanted to bring Tamannaah on board for this song. We changed our mind after we felt it wouldn't be purposive.\n\nHow do you see the film?\n\nBlending action with a unique concept was not difficult. It's not like the concept was my innovation entirely. I felt it would make for engaging entertainment if the concept is blended with a native story.\n\nAlthough Bhumika garu's character is not long in the movie, it's integral to the story. Madhavan garu, Rao Ramesh garu, and Vennela Kishore too have strong roles. We wanted to choose a new girl for the female lead's character. This is when I watched 'Munna Michael' (Hindi). I loved her dance moves and roped her.\n\nWhen is the sequel to 'Karthikeya' happening? What about a film with Nagarjuna?\n\nBasic idea is there. I need more experience as a director to be able to make such a movie. As for Nag sir's movie, I have readied a script. Depending on how 'Savyasachi' does at the BO, this film will materialize. I have given a commitment to two production houses. No project has been finalized."
