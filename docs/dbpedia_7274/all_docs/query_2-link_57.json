        "text": "This had such amazing potential with the Vanishing Twin Syndrome concept and the idea of the twin with the body not appreciating the vanished twin until later in the movie. Unfortunately, Chandoo Mondeti’s screenplay and writing doesn’t do proper justice to this idea. The cat-and-mouse dynamics (second half) between Chay and Madhavan are still fun and engaging enough to make Savyasachi worth the watch for me. But the entire team missed out on a big opportunity with this misfire of a movie…\n\nVikram the MC has a twin brother who resides in his left hand and while on a trip his bus has an accident and he is the sole survivor. Circumstances happen and then we get to the main villain whose back story is quite alright and he is quite fleshed out by Madhavan and the climax is predictable. The love story was generic and the resolution your average standard of the mill.\n\nHow to take a good concept and ruin it. Man spend the time you spent on setting up the film to write and flesh out the script man.\n\n3/10\n\nChandoo fucks up a decent concept with horrible execution and a screenplay with no heart and zero style. I mean how can you make Madhavan look boring? Almost nothing works in the film. The writing is dumb, and it shamelessly underestimates the audience by throwing a crap ton of commercial elements at our faces"
