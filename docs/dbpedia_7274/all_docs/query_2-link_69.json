        "text": "Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Naga Chaitanya have always been in the limelight for their marriage and divorce. The ex-couple stunned everyone when they announced their separation. Their fans and well-wishers were very upset with this news. Do you know what is the best gift that Samantha Ruth Prabhu received from Naga Chaitanya? She revealed this in an old interview. Samantha and Naga Chaitanya once appeared for a fun and candid rapid-fire in an interview. At the time, the two were promoting their film Majili together in 2019. When asked about the best gift she received from her then-husband, she replied, “A bag that he hand-wrote and hand-painted with my favourite quote.” In the same interview, Naga Chaitanya revealed that he proposed to Samantha in the Maldives.\n\nSamantha Ruth Prabhu and Naga Chaitanya got married in 2017 in the presence of friends and family after dating for a few years. The duo started off as friends and played opposite roles in several films, which led to a romantic relationship. But fate had other plans as both the actors decided to separate and pursue their own goals. As announced by the actors themselves, the two separated and eventually divorced.\n\nNaga Chaitanya, who was last seen in the Telugu horror thriller web series Dhootha, is gearing up to work with Karthikeya and Premam director Chandoo Mondeti in Thandel. This will be the third collaboration with Mondeti. Previously, they have worked together in Premam and Savyasachi.\n\nThandel is an action drama that revolves around a fisherman from Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh, who is captured by Pakistani forces in international waters. The film also stars Sai Pallavi and Sundeep Vedd. Chaitanya is reunited with Sai Pallavi after the superhit Love Story (2021).\n\nSamantha Ruth Prabhu also has some exciting projects lined up. She will next be seen in Citadel: Hunny Bunny with Varun Dhawan. The upcoming Indian spy thriller will be available for streaming on Amazon Prime. Besides, the Oo Antava sensation will also be seen as a lead actress and producer in Bangaram. She announced the project on her 37th birthday this year."
