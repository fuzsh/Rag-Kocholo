        "text": "Savyasachi is Naga Chaitanyaâ€™s biggest release to date. The film is ready for a release tomorrow and there is a very good buzz for the project as it is being directed by Chandoo Mondeti.\n\nThe film is releasing during the Diwali season and as there are no major Telugu releases in the coming days, a good talk will surely help the film in a big way.\n\nIf the initial reports of the film are good, there will not be any competition and the next release, Sarkar, being a Tamil dubbed film will not post much threat to Savyasachi.\n\nSo, things look set for Savyasachi and we need to see how it performs at the box office.\n\nArticles that might interest you:"
