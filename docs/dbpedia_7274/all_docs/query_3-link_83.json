        "text": "Picture this: a Sabyasachi lehenga, not just a lehenga but a dream woven with exquisite craftsmanship, coveted by brides far and wide. Every bride's desire, yet a few sigh at its unattainable beauty, the cost being the hurdle. Let's talk numbers, addressing the curiosity: how much does this dream lehenga really cost?\n\nBuckle up brides, for we’re unveiling the secret behind this dreamy ensemble, demystifying the digits that make hearts skip a beat!\n\nSabyasachi Lehenga Cost 101: All You Need To Know\n\nSo, how much does an original Sabyasachi lehenga cost?\n\nAs of November 2023, all Sabyasachi bridal lehengas start at a price point of 5 lakhs onwards. While you can get lighter outfits and sarees for a lesser price point, the bridal lehenga range starts from INR 5 Lakhs. These do not include lighter lehengas like printed ones that you may pick for smaller functions like your Mehendi or the Sangeet.\n\nA bridal Sabyasachi lehenga cost will vary anywhere between 5 lakhs to 15 lakhs, depending on the work and collection that you are picking from.\n\nThe super-heavy lehengas are upwards of 8 lakhs onwards.\n\nTheir lighter collection starts from 1 lakh onwards. This includes printed sarees, anarkalis and the works. It goes up to 4 lakhs.\n\nTheir couture pieces are priced higher and go up to 25 lakhs or even more, depending on the work done\n\nDo note that Sabyasachi doesn’t customise all lehengas and doesn’t allow for mix and match so if you are planning something personalised, Sabyasachi is not the lehenga to opt for.\n\nAll of their collection will be available at their flagship stores along with multi-designer stores like Aza and Ensemble. You will get a wider variety of bridal lehenga at their store than any other store, along with lighter lehengas, accessories and the newest entrant – Sabyasachi Jewellery\n\n25+ Sabyasachi Lehengas You Will Love\n\nLike every year, Sabyasachi dropped a stunning collection in 2023 that made its way into our hearts! What we loved about this was the stunning mix of lehenga styles that they have introduced. From velvet stunners for winter weddings to trendy pastel beauties, they have something for all kinds of brides.\n\nRight Out Of The Classic Sabya Guldasta Collection That Meets Wednesday Adams!\n\nYou don't need to restrict yourself to a Sabya only for your wedding day!

So make sure you plan accordingly! The lehenga is curated as per your frame and size.\n\nWhat about customised lehengas?\n\nCustomising a lehenga obviously costs more. But it is possible. You can request changes to the dupatta, the blouse etc, and they are done- that is the reason why you see so many brides rock lehengas that are similar but the blouse and dupatta might differ. Requests can be made, but since Sabyasachi Mukherjee approves every customisation himself, it's rare to get it done.\n\nCan you mix and match and make a lehenga?\n\nThat's another no. You cannot mix and match the choli of one lehenga to the dupatta or skirt of another, unless and until you're buying three different lehengas. Sabyasachi lehengas are curated pieces, and there's no mixing and matching allowed. Customising is the only option.\n\nRent a Sabyasachi Lehenga\n\nWell, not every bride who dreams to wear a Sabyasachi lehenga has the budget to buy it. And when you can't buy it, you rent it.
