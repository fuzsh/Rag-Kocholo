        "text": "The pre-release event of Naga Chaitanya and Nidhhi Agerwal starrer ‘Savyasachi’ was a grand affair held on October 27 in Hyderabad. Director Koratala Siva and hero Vijay Deverakonda graced the event as chief guests. A great number of fans have gather at the venue.Vijay Deverakonda has bought Savyasachi big ticket for Rs. 1 lakh. The film is scheduled to hit screens on November 2.\n\n‘Savyasachi’ is being produced by Naveen Yerneni, Y Ravi Shankar and Mohan Cherukuri (CVM) under the prestigious production house, Mythri Movie Makers with Chandoo Mondeti as director. Pan India star Madhavan is playing a key role and Bhumika will be seen in a an important role.\n\nPopular Tamil actor Madhavan is so happy to be finally in Telugu\n\nHero Madhavan said, “I have finally come to Telugu film industry. I want to thank Mythri Movie Makers for making that possible for me. The industry does very well when we have good producers. I am so happy that Mythri Movies are hitting sixers over sixers in the last few few film and I am telling you that this film also, for your good heart, will be a blockbuster. Secondly, I wanted to thank Chai.\n\nI am a huge fan of Nagarjuna\n\nI am so happy for you Chai, very popular, fans are going berserk. But, the most important thing is, the best part of this project is everybody has a golden heart and you have one of the best hearts I have seen in the industry. I have been a huge fan of your parents, from the bottom of my heart and now it’s a privilege to work with you. I am sure this will be a biggest blockbuster, yet for you. Welcome to the film industry Nidhhi. I am sure it’s a lucky project and will become big hit for you.\n\nWishing Nidhhi Agerwal and Vijay Deverakonda\n\nThanks Vijay for being such a sportive man. I have never gone on the stage and danced in my live and specially not in somebody else’s function. I hadn’t even dance in my own function. Congratulation to you! You are making a fantastic mark and I wish you all the very best.\n\nHeaping praises on technical team:\n\nBut I think the biggest backbone of the film that you are all will be very proud of are the technical crew of this film starting from art director Chandu. Rama Krishna’s sets are extraordinary and I think you all will agree with me. I don’t want to talk before the film’s release. But, when you see the film you realise. Cameraman and everyone has done beautiful job. It’s a great privilege to work with them all. I am very very excited for being part of the film. I am so happy to be finally in Telugu. Please give us your blessings. We will talk on the hundredth day function.\n\nVijay Deverakonda is a performer to the core and can put his skills to show at the drop of a hat. The young hero grabbed everyone’s attention with his candid talk and grooving to the remixed version of Nagarjuna’s ‘Ninnu Road Meedha…’ song alongside dancers at the event.\n\nI feel like hugging him:\n\nWhenever I see Keeravani garu, I feel like hugging him. But, I controlled myself realising that it’s not correct. I first met Keeravani garu when I was travelling on a flight from Bombay. I was ordering food but I was unable to pay money. He paid the bill. He is such a nice person. I love his music. I am looking forward to watch Savyasachi.\n\nTheir passion is incredible:\n\nMythri Movie Makers have done massive films. I am presently working for ‘Dear Comrade’ with them and I have also signed another movie. They are the loveliest I know. They have seen only success so far. Their love towards cinema and their passion is incredible. I truly hope that they will score a big hit through Savyasachi.\n\nLovely to see Maddy in Telugu cinema:\n\nIt’s lovely to see Maddy sir in Telugu cinema. We all are fans of you here. We watch your Tamil films in Telugu. We really like them. It’s a pleasure for us that you are doing a straight Telugu movie. We are looking forward to see you in Telugu cinema.\n\nNidhhi is an absolute stunner. I think Nidhhi has to work double hard so that people see her looks. I wish her all the best for coming future. Chadoo has done only good films so far. I hope he has done one more kick-ass film. I hope Savyasachi is really big\n\nI hope Savyasachi goes on to become a massive success:\n\nI don’t know why. I really like Chai. I met him only once. I just loved the way he has given me handshake and smile. Chai is an amazing guy. Everyone just loves him for the the person he is and how relaxed he is. I think he don’t remember this. First time I met him when I doing my graduation and he was about to launch as hero with ‘Josh’. I am a huge fan of Nag sir since childhood. I hope Savyasachi goes on to become a massive and wish the entire team all luck.\n\nSinger Sunitha’s daughter Shreya Goparaju is making her debut as playback singer in Tollywood through this film. She is being introduced by the music composer MM Keeravani, Sunitha thanked MM Keeravani for the support given to her and for introducing her daughter. Shreya Goparaju also thanked the music director for having given her the opportunity.\n\nMM Keeravani heaped praises the entire team of Savyasachi. He said, “Working with Naga Chaitanya is a wonderful experience. Anantha Sriram and Ramajogayya Sastry garu have given beautiful songs. My father Shiva Shakti Datta garu has given wonderful title track. The iconic song 'Ninnu Roddu Meeda Chusinadi Lagayathu' has been remixed for Chaitu's Savyasachi.”\n\nThe music director remembered producer D Siva Prasad reddy garu and said he was saddened by the news. He said, “D Siva Prasad Reddy garu loves Mohana Ragam. Once, he requested me to give a song like ‘Podagantimayya...Purushottama’ in ‘Annamayya’. Then I have given a song ‘Venumadhava…’ for the film ‘Nenunnanu’. He was very much impressed. It is very sad that he is no more alive.”"
