        "text": "Two films — Savyasachi and Mr Majnu came in quick succession for Nidhhi Agerwal. Two days before the release of Mr Majnu last week, Nidhhi signed another project. She insists that though she hasn’t planned her career that way, it’s moving forward. Born in Hyderabad, brought up in Bengaluru and now living in Mumbai, Nidhhi is happy shuttling cities for work. Unlike in Savyasachi, she had a great part to contribute in her second Telugu movie. She concurs, “When you are part of film that is based on action, I can’t expect much but if it is a love story, you know what you are getting into. Having said that, the kind of appreciation my role is getting is unbelievable. In the beginning people would say I’m lucky to get this role so early but I couldn’t understand why. After two or three days of shoot, I knew why. Venky is a good writer, the dialogues I got to say are amazing; especially in the interval scene, I’ve said some really nice lines.”\n\nIs she like Niikki in the movie? She admits she had dated but isn’t sure if she has ever been in love. “I am exactly the opposite of that character, I’m not going to run behind the boy so much, I’ll make them work very hard.”\n\nWhen she went to the theatres on the day Mr Majnu released, she found people laughing aloud at the scenes played out on the child named Konda Babu. Nidhhi observes all segments of audience loved the film which is why it worked. She adds, it is a Sunday film that one can sit and enjoy with the family. She heaps praise on the director who is around her age and has helped her get into the character easily, “One of the major reasons of understanding the scenes, the words I use, situation I was in is Venky. For a contemporary love story where the parents are not against the alliance but the problem is with the couple, it helped that Venky is very young. There was a lot of pain in the character I portrayed. It all came from the dialogues, if you understand it, it will tear you up..there is no way you won’t feel emotional. With this film, I understood and found my own little methods of acting. I laughed a lot on the sets but cried in the film.”\n\nNidhhi is a dancer; she puts in hours for dances classes and acting workshopsis a trained belly dancer. In fact her debut film Munna Micheal had her playing a dancer. She says it the regular dancing around trees that heroines do is the toughest thing to do. She avers, “It isn’t easy, otherwise you look very silly. Imagine singing and dancing round trees..you have to be convincing. You need to enjoy and let go off every inhibition. A heroine has to do everything — she dances, acts; so I do it too.”"
