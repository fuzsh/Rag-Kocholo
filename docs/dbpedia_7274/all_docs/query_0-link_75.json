        "text": "Director Chandoo Mondeti and Naga Chaitanya teamed up for the Telugu remake of Premam, which went by the same title, and now they are back together for Savyasachi. The film’s production is currently underway with Naga Chaitanya and Nidhi Agarwal playing the lead pair.\n\nOn Savyasachi’s progress, director Chandoo Mondeti had reportedly told in an interview to Deccan Chronicle, “It is shaping up so well, and the output is really pushing us. True to its title, Savyasachi will feature intense action sequences and Naga Chaitanya will be seen in his element. We have shot at untapped locations in the US, and those scenes will make for a great visual experience.”\n\nWorking with Naga Chaitanya for the second time, the director has said that Naga Chaitanya has improved his acting skills from what it was in Premam and is confident that Savyasachi would take him to the next level as an actor.\n\nAccording to latest reports, the film will have the remix of Nagarjuna’s hit song 'Ninnu Roadu Meeda Chusinadi Lagayithu' from Allari Alludu that hit the silver screens in the year 1993. Reports are that MM Keeravani, who had composed the original version, will be setting the tunes for the remix as well.\n\nThe film is scheduled for release on June 10 and it is currently in the post-production mode. J Yuvaraj has cranked the camera for Savyasachi with S Rama Krishna and Monika Niggotre doing the editing. Touted to be a romantic action entertainer, the film’s stunts have been choreographed by Ram and Laxman.\n\nChandoo Mondeti started his career as a director with Karthikeya in 2014 and went on to direct the Telugu remake of Premam, which had Naga Chaitanya in the lead. He is the writer of the remake of Kannada blockbuster Kirrak Party. Savyasachi is his third film as director.\n\nNaga Chaitanya’s last release as hero was Yuddham Sharanam and he was seen in a cameo in Mahanati / Nadigayar Thilagam recently. With Savyaachi ready for release, Naga Chaitanya has Sailaja Reddy Alludu in the making right now. The film is being directed by Maruthi Dasari with Anu Emmanuel playing the female lead."
