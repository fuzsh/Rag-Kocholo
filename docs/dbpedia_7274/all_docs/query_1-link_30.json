'Three') is a 2016 Indian Hindi-language mystery thriller film written and directed by Ribhu Dasgupta. This remake of the 2013 South Korean film Montage stars Amitabh Bachchan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Sabyasachi Chakraborty, Padmavati Rao, and Vidya Balan in the lead roles.[3][4][5] It was released on 10 June 2016. The film was a commercial failure at the box office.[1]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn Biswas (Amitabh Bachchan) is a 70-year-old grandfather who visits the police station regularly. He is desperate to find the kidnapper and murderer of his granddaughter Angela, who died eight years ago. Police inspector Sarita Sarkar (Vidya Balan) has no clues about the case. Yet, she continues to search for the perpetrator, despite being discouraged by people all around her and slowly collects evidence.\n\nJohn's wife Nancy (Padmavati Rao) is sick and uses a wheelchair. Despite personal problems, John is determined not to give up. John also regularly meets Father Martin Das (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), who was a police inspector and was handling the Angela kidnapping case. Father Martin Das tries his best in solving the case, but the guilt of being unsuccessful compelled him to leave his job and become a priest.\n\nOne day, eight years after that tragic incident, another boy named Rony is kidnapped. Everything about the kidnapping parallels the kidnapping of Angela. Further investigation reveals that the modus operandi for kidnapping Rony is the same as that of Angela. Inspector Sarita requests Father Martin for assistance in cracking the case. Martin supports partially by providing clues and Sarita, with John, starts investigating the case.\n\nSince the modus operandi was the same, Angela's case file is re-opened. Rony's grandfather, Manohar (Sabyasachi Chakraborty) is arrested when he tries to flee with the ransom at the railway station. Sarita interrogates him in the lock-up, but he says he was acting under the instructions of the real kidnapper.\n\nIn the meantime, John doggedly pieces together the identity of Angela's kidnapper from little bits of information that he collects through his own investigations. It is eventually revealed that these scenes take place before Rony's kidnapping, as John discovers that Manohar was the one who had kidnapped Angela and subsequently creates a plan to kidnap Rony to seek revenge and justice.\n\nFather Martin finds out that John kidnapped Rony and confronts him. John requests Martin to arrange a meeting with Manohar. During the meeting, John makes Manohar confess to his crimes. Manohar explains that he kidnapped Angela to pay for his daughter's open heart surgery.\n\nIt is revealed that Angela was not murdered — while being held captive, she escaped and accidentally fell from a height on to a moving car and died. The car was driven by Father Martin Das, who was injured in the accident. Manohar is arrested for his crimes. John cries tears of happiness, having avenged Angela's murder as the screen fades out.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nAmitabh Bachchan as John Biswas\n\nNawazuddin Siddiqui as Father Martin Das\n\nVidya Balan as Sarita Sharma[6]\n\nSabyasachi Chakrabarty as Manohar Sinha\n\nPadmavati Rao as Nancy Biswas, wife of John Biswas\n\nAarnaa Sharma as Angela Roy\n\nTota Roy Chowdhury as Peter Roy, Angela's father\n\nRicky Patel as Rony Poddar\n\nAnupam Bhattacharya as Hemant Poddar, Rony's father\n\nDeblina Chakravorty as Neeta, Rony's mother\n\nMukesh Chhabra as Tariq, real estate agent\n\nPrakash Belawadi as Kumar\n\nMasood Akhtar as Imambara official\n\nPhalguni Chatterjee as LMO officer\n\nArun Saha as LMO clerk\n\nArindol Bagchi as orphanage clerk\n\nAntara Banerjee as bride in church\n\nAbhipriti Das as deaf and mute girl\n\nMohammad Arif as groom in church\n\nParitosh Sand as ACP\n\nBiswajeet Das as church patron\n\nIndira Dutta Choudhury as maid\n\nSujata Ghosh as constable\n\nPratap Rana as peon\n\nRajat Das as hawker\n\nSagnik as Bhaskor\n\nSatyam Majumdar as LMO manager\n\nSuneel Sinha as Hari Prakash\n\nSoumyajit Majumdar as Hari Prakash's manager\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nShooting started on 24 November 2015 with Vidya Balan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui at Writers' Building, Kolkata.
