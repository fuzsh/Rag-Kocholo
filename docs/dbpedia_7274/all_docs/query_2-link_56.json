        "text": "The new Telugu release “Savyasachi” has surprised Andhra and Telanganas audiences with the strong presence of Tamil cinemas iconic actor R Madhavan.\n\nMadhavan has so far done only Tamil and Hindi film so what prompted him to do a Telugu film and that too in a negative role?\n\n“The role, what else? It was a fabulous role. Though my character enters the picture mid-way, my introduction into the plot had me hooked. And the enthusiasm that I felt in Andhra Pradesh when I went there to finalise the Telugu version of my biopic on the space scientist Nambi Naraynan, clinched the matter. I was told I had no idea about my fan-following in Andhra. Now I do,” laughs Madhavan.\n\nHis entry into the film is greeted with a loud applause in Andhra.\n\nMadhavan is pleasantly surprised, “I had no idea I’d be received so well in my first Telugu film. Now of course there is ‘Rocketry The Nambi’ Effect where I will be speaking my own lines in Telugu for the first time. I learnt the language for my character in ‘Savyasachi’ . But they had to dub my voice finally. But for the Nambi bio-pic I will be speaking Telugu in my own voice.”\n\nMadhavan says he enjoyed his first stint in Telugu cinema. “I had never spoken in Telugu and I had never played a negative character. It was a new experience for me. I am certainly open to doing more Telugu films.”\n\nTelugu360 is always open for the best and bright journalists.

Mythri Movie Makers spent nearly 35 Crores on the film’s budget making this the most expensive film in Naga Chaitanya’s career. It is quite surprising that they shelled out more budget than Naga Chaitanya’s present market. The real reason behind this is said to be reshoots and delays.\n\nIt is a known fact that Savyasachi is based on vanishing twin syndrome concept. In the initial version of Chandoo Mondeti’s story, Naga Chaitanya’s sister Bhumika is unaware of abnormal qualities possessed by his left hand. After shooting some portion of the film, the makers felt that the story is devoid of few logics. So, they decided to reshoot all those scenes with Bhumika and Naga Chaitanya. This has caused unnecessary delay to the project and resulted in extra budget.\n\nThe film is getting mixed reports from all areas. It needs to perform exceptionally well for break even.\n\nTelugu360 is always open for the best and bright journalists.

The film draws its plot on vanishing twin syndrome concept, a first of its kind story-line in Tollywood. Madhavan is playing Naga Chaitanya’s nemesis in this film.\n\nLet’s find out if Savyasachi gives a much needed relief for Naga Chaitanya. Here is our review.\n\nStory :\n\nVikram Aditya ( Chay) , an Ad. Film maker, meets his client and ex-lover Chitra ( Nidhhi Agerwal) after six years. They refresh sweet memories from college life, go to New York City for their next Ad shooting. When returned, Vikram finds his sister’s family was attacked, niece was kidnapped.\n\nArun Raj ( Madhavan ) had been a talented youngster , but he dislikes the society around him for a reason. Arun attacks Vikram’s family and kidnaps his niece. Rest of the story is the mind game between Arun and Vikram.\n\nAnalysis :\n\nSavyasachi film has an interesting story that has been diluted with dull narration. The core conflict point written for protagonist Vikram , Antagonist Arun characters is decent. But the filler part which consists of ‘College scenes and love track’ is boring. The mind game in second half is not much engaging but pre climax scenes were good. Vanishing twin syndrome concept has been used effectively. Two songs in first half shaped up well, in second half there is a nice remix song but it was timing bad. As a director, Chandoo has failed to impress the audience with his narration\n\nProduction values by Mythri movie makers are grand. In Songs and action blocks the lavishness is visible. MM Keeravani music is partially impressive. Cinematography by Yuvaraj is nice, captures vibrant New York city for a short duration in the film. Ram-Laxman composed two fights in a decent manner.\n\nPerformances:\n\nChay as Vikram got an interesting role, he performed well. R Madhavan as disgruntled genius Arun performed adequately . Heroine Nidhhi Agerwal has very limited role, looks okay. Yester heroine Bhumika played elder sister to Chay , she is good. Vennela Kishore comedy has limitations. Shakalaka Shankar as NRI is hilarious.\n\nPositives:\n\nStoryline\n\n2-3 Songs\n\nChay and Madhavan performances\n\nPre-Climax\n\nNegatives:\n\nBoring college episodes in first half\n\nLack of engaging narration\n\nMind game between Chay/Madhavan is not interesting\n\nVerdict :\n\nSavyasachi movie has a pretty average first half and partially engaging second half, Naga Chaitanya might have to wait longer for his elusive hit. This film may find some traction with masses\n\nTelugu360 Rating : 2.5/5\n\nRelease Date : 1st Nov, 2018\n\nDirector : Chandoo Mondeti\n\nMusic Director : M.M. Keeravani\n\nChoreography : J. Yuvaraj\n\nProducer : Mythri Movie Makers\n\nStarring : Naga Chaitanya, R. Madhavan, Nidhhi Agerwal\n\nTelugu360 is always open for the best and bright journalists.

They are said to have paid advances to several top actors, directors and technicians of Tollywood. They inked a deal with Powerstar Pawan Kalyan and Santosh Srinivas has been roped in to direct the film. With Pawan occupied with politics the film has been kept on hold. The makers now replaced the actor with Ravi Teja and the film will start rolling soon. They approached Pawan Kalyan about this and he asked us to go ahead revealed Naveen Yerneni, Yalamanchili Ravishankar and Cherukuri Mohan, the partners of Mythri Movie Makers.\n\nWhen asked about Pawan returning the advance for the makers, they clarified that they haven’t asked Pawan to return the advances. Mythri Movie Makers will produce a film with Pawan Kalyan post elections once he returns back to films said the producers. They even revealed that Mythri will soon produce a film with Trivikram and the choice of picking up the actor has been left to the top director.\n\nMythri Movie Makers who produced several big blockbusters like Srimanthudu, Janatha Garage and Rangasthalam are soon all set to surprise the audience with a small budget film. Riteesh will make his directorial debut that will feature a bunch of new faces. The movie will be made on a strict budget of Rs 89 lakhs and will roll very soon.\n\nMythri Movie Makers produced Naga Chaitanya’s Savyasachi and Ravi Teja’s Amar Akbar Anthony which are slated in November in a gap of two weeks. Speaking on the incident, one of the producers Naveen Yerneni said “We are here to produce good films. We are not here to differentiate small and big films. We are keen on experimenting with new actors and technicians. Big budget films can be recovered in first weekend while small budget films take ten days to recover the investments. We are producing a small budget film that costs Rs 1.5 crores including expenses and promotions”.\n\nTelugu360 is always open for the best and bright journalists.

Srimanthudu, Janatha Garage and Rangasthalam all became mile stone movies in career of Mahesh, NTR and Charan. Now the production banner is releasing Savyasachi and Amar Akbar Antony in next month and industry is keen on results of these movies.\n\nMythri movie makers initially told, they will make movies only with star heroes. But they later changed their course and producing movies with middle range heroes too. (Click here for : Mythri movie makers changed the track?). Savyasachi and Amar Akbar Antony, both are getting ready to hit the silver screen next month. But the heroes of these movies are not in their top form now. Naga Chaitanya’s previous films Yuddham Sharanam (flop) and Shailaja Reddy Alludu (average) did not meet expectations. Ravi Teja’s previous 2 films Nela Ticket and Touch Chesi Chudu also bit the dust at box office. Moreover, both Savyasachi and AAA have been delayed a lot.\n\nIf both of these movies become hits, industry people will rave about Midas touch of the banner. But if these films dont do well, their banner value comes down drastically. In the industry where fate changes every Friday, November month is indeed Litmus test for Mythri banner. We will have to wait and see if the banner passes the test.\n\nTelugu360 is always open for the best and bright journalists.

All his recent films failed to attain hit status despite getting decent word of mouth. He has now pinned all hopes on his upcoming film Savyasachi which is carrying good reports from inside sources. Though the film has been postponed several times, Naga Chaitanya is very confident that the film has shaped up quite well.\n\nSavyasachi is hitting the screens on November 2nd. As Dusheera films have already slowed down at box office, Savyasachi will have strong openings because it is going to be solo release next Friday. It is good chance for Naga Chaitanya to deliver the much needed commercial hit. The promising trailers and teasers have generated good buzz on the film. Newbie Niddhi Aggerwal’s glam diva will be another added advantage for the film to attract young audience.\n\nSuccessful production house Mythri Movie Makers produced the film and Chandoo Mondeti is the director.\n\nTelugu360 is always open for the best and bright journalists.

This film also happens to Madhavan’s official debut into Tollywood. The film is directed by Chandoo Mondeti who worked with Naga Chaitanya earlier for Premam. Music for the film is composed by M.M.Keeravani.\n\nThe album begins on a trendy note with Why Not which already gathered much attention with the single release. Ananth Sriram’s lyrics are quite appealing and also have good poetry involved. The song entirely has a contemporary feel with foot tapping rhythm and techno sounds. PVNS Rohit does a decent job with his youthful voice. The interludes have good techno riffs and keyboard usage. The usage of violin gives it a classical touch.\n\nThe next is a remix of Nagarjuna’s all time hit Ninnu Roaddu Meedha from Allari Alludu. The usage of additional party riffs, rhythm and rap adds a contemporary feel to the song. However, the original song’s commercial and mass touch is missing in this version. But, it would have its appeal to the current day youth for the layering. Pridhvi Chandra and Moumina make a passable attempt to make it a peppy number.\n\nOkkarantey Okaru is a beautiful female solo by Sreenidhi Venkatesh and penned by Rama Jogayya Sastry. The usage of minor scale is done to best effect in the form of harmonica and strings. The mild piano touches are beautiful and appealing to hear. The pain of mother who bear vanishing twins is beautifully explained by the lyrics. This song definitely stands out by being entirely loyal to the theme.\n\nThe album returns to modern feel with Tick Tick Tick performed by Hymath and Shreya Goparaju who have a breezy voice. Ananth Sriram includes some English words to give it a trendiest feel and succeeds in doing the same. The song has quite a road trip kind of appeal for its swift nature and relaxing ambience.\n\nA jazzy number 1980,81,82 which speaks much about nostalgia of the 80s kids. This song strikes a chord with all those people who grew up in the age of video games, VCR and cassettes. It is indeed a great attempt by Ananth Sriram to relive all those memories through his peppy lyrics. The song has timely piano touches as well.\n\nOopiri Ukkiribikkiri is a melancholic number which speaks mountains about struggle of survival. The song has an eerie feel to it thanks to the chord progression and Srikrishna takes up this challenge quite well. However, the female vocals Sri Soumya and Mohana Bhogaraju mellow down the tension with their reassuring vocals. Kudos to Ananth Sriram for giving a contrasting effect and interesting confrontation of the lead character.\n\nVerdict:\n\nSavyasachi is an impressive album from Keeravani which caters to the current trends. The composer definitely is keeping up to the current tastes of the audience.\n\nOur Picks: Why not, Okarante Okaru, Oopiri Ukkiribiri\n\nTelugu360 is always open for the best and bright journalists.
