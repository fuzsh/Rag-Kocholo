Savyasachi is the next interesting film from Telugu Film Industry that caught the attention of viewers.

Naga Chaitanya and Chandoo Mondeti coming together again and the plot being completely new, one part being out of control of the lead, the expectations are good from this film.

Also, fans are waiting for Naga Chaitanya to give a good film after his previous film.

But the team is increasing even more curiosity by keeping the look of Madhavan in the film, a secret.

The popular actor is doing a Telugu film for the first time but his look hasn't been released yet.

He did reveal that he will be seen as an interesting antagonist without revealing too much.

But why is the team still, not trying to release his look? Why is it a secret?

May be we will know after watching the film. Mythri Moviemakers is bankrolling the film and MM Keeravani is scoring for a Naga Chaitanya film for the first time.

Nidhi Agerwal, Bhoomika are playing other important characters in the film..
