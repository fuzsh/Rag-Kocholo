        "text": "Business Minister Matthew Hancock today (23 March 2015) praised the work 3 business groups have done to make sure regulations work better for businesses.\n\nIn a significant shift, the Fresh Produce Consortium, National Farmers’ Union (NFU) and techUK have been collecting evidence on the way regulations are enforced in their sector and presenting their findings directly to ministers and regulators.\n\nToday the results of their work have been published alongside responses from the relevant regulator.\n\nBusiness Minister Matthew Hancock said:\n\nOur ambition is to make Britain the best place in the world to start and grow a business – we won’t let red tape get in the way.\n\nWe’ve scrapped a record amount of red tape since 2010 which has saved businesses more than £10 billion. Industry groups are now taking this a step further. Businesses up and down the country will benefit from the work they have done to reform counterproductive, time-consuming or bureaucratic enforcement of rules.\n\nThe Fresh Produce Consortium scrutinised imports of fresh produce into the UK. After carefully considering their findings, the Food Standards Agency will be taking a number of steps including reviewing official control turnaround times at airports and investigating disparities in the costs that are charged by Port Health Authorities for their inspections.\n\ntechUK have reviewed the export licensing of electronic products. The government’s Export Control Organisation (ECO) will explore options to re-introduce their control list classification advice service to make it easier for businesses to know whether a product requires an export licence. They will also continue to pursue export licensing reforms aimed at providing businesses with more flexible licensing solutions which minimise the impact on the exporter and the regulator. This review was explicitly not permitted to make any recommendations on the UK’s strict vetting and licensing system for military or dual-use products.\n\nThe National Farmers’ Union examined livestock inspections and found issues with duplication of visits from different regulators and inconsistencies across the country in terms of the number of inspections. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have welcomed this important work and are considering what action to take.\n\nThe Business Focus on Enforcement reviews and responses can be viewed at Focus on Enforcement . The government has now received over 20 proposals from industry groups to run similar reviews in different areas of the economy in future.\n\nPaul Hide, techUK Director of Operations, said:\n\ntechUK welcome the positive engagement and agreement on improvement measures as a result of the report that we have produced with input from our electronics network partners. The acceptance by senior ministers of the need for change and the support of key stakeholders within the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and ECO can lead to a more efficient export controls process. We look forward to working with ECO and BIS to ensure that businesses can benefit from the improvement actions, as outlined in ECO’s interim report, at the earliest opportunity\n\nNigel Jenney, Chief Executive of the Fresh Produce Consortium, said:\n\nWe were delighted to have the opportunity to present evidence of enforcement issues for official controls under EC Regulation 669’/2009 that are costing our sector time and money. It is vital that the UK government and its agencies continue to take action now to address the issues raised in our report.\n\nNFU better regulation adviser Lee Osborne said:\n\nWe will use the evidence gathered during this initiative to continue to share our concerns regarding inspections with the new government. While we realise that time left during this parliament doesn’t allow for any radical change, given the effort and time put into this work the NFU and its members expect to see a full response from Defra post-election.\n\nNotes to editors"
