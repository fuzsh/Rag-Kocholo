        "text": "The controversy surrounding former U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron ’s lobbying for Greensill Capital deepened, as the Sunday Times reported the firm was awarded a contract with the National Health Service after he held a private meeting with a cabinet minister.\n\nCameron arranged a private drink in 2019 with Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Australian financier Lex Greensill , after which the NHS began using a payment service from a Greensill Capital start-up , the newspaper said. The service allowed NHS employees, under strain from the coronavirus pandemic, to receive their wages in advance and the deal was done without a procurement process, the paper said."
