        "text": "Matt Hancock, the former Health Secretary, is \"immediately associated with the word sleaze\" by the public in the wake of the Covid crisis, a survey for the committee on standards in public life has found.\n\nParticipants in a survey of 1,590 people conducted on behalf of the committee said the pandemic had exposed poor behaviour by politicians, including breaches of lockdown rules and the awarding of public procurement contracts to ministers' friends.\n\nThe research, conducted by Deltapoll, found that \"different current and former politicians were immediately associated with the word 'sleaze', including Matt Hancock, David Cameron and Boris Johnson\".\n\nIt found that, among the public, there was a \"feeling for some that these politicians do not possess the core values expected from political leaders\".\n\n\"This created a general sentiment that it is one rule for them and a different rule for everyone else,\" it said.\n\nIn total, 41 per cent of people felt ministers' standards of conduct were quite low or very low, compared with 24 per cent who felt they were quite or very high.\n\nThe survey also found participants were \"visibly angry as they recounted the strict pandemic rules they had to follow, which they believed were disregarded by various politicians who subsequently faced few or no consequences\".\n\nOne focus group member said: \"When you mentioned sleaze I straight away thought about Matt Hancock … it seems like one rule for them and different ethical standards, morals and etiquette for everybody else. It's all according to class, power and money.\"\n\nIn light of the findings, the CSPL recommended tougher sanctions for politicians with \"poor ethical standards\".\n\nThe committee also found that there was \"an underlying sense of resignation, bordering on cynicism\" that politics would never be entirely ethical, but that improvements could still be made.\n\nIn his foreword to the main report, Lord Evans, the committee on standards in public life chairman and a former MI5 director general, said: \"From the evidence we have taken during our review, it has become clear that a system of standards regulation which relies on convention is no longer satisfactory.\"\n\nAngela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, welcomed the report, saying: \"Boris Johnson and his Conservative colleagues' actions have repeatedly undermined standards in our public life.\""
