        "text": "https://lnkd.in/eiuECMg3. The Tories create problems and then only partially solve them. This is evident in :- 1. The artificial recession they have made out of the economy by introducing punitive sanctions in the Universal Credit system. The Tories are ideologically opposed to a welfare state which can prevent absolute poverty for millions of people. They want everyone to have a job; which sounds good but there are many ruthless and bad employers in the UK which exploit the workforce with bad health and safety conditions. 2. The artificial emergency they have made by radically increasing legal immigration from outside the EU; their only partial solution is the Rwanda Plan; which Labour have been a bit slow to respond to. 3. The mismanagement of the NHS. The inability to bring in a new mental health act to enshrine peer support workers in law. Peer support workers are \"alive\" and have less capacity and abilities for work compared with the majority \"zombie\" population. etc. For these reasons and many more I think you would have to be a very vile form of bastard to vote tory this time around; they have shown their true colours. *EVERYONE VOTE The Labour Party* on July 4th 2024. #outwiththebastardtories.\n\nAs Parliament returns to both Holyrood and Westminster, it's clear that both Governments still have major challenges ahead of them. The Conservatives are looking to re-group after losing two previously safe seats to the Labour Party. Despite a 20% lead in the opinion polls, they face the question of how to move forward and prevent the tide from turning against them. However, Labour also faces its own challenges, with issues arising from the Rochdale by-election and the ongoing conflict in Israel and Gaza. Despite this, the recent Scottish Labour Conference in Glasgow demonstrated their openness to business and understanding of what the business community and working population need to grow and build the economy going forward. For businesses, the question remains: if not now, when? With potential changes to Parliament and a high number of inexperienced MPs, it's more important than ever to engage with government affairs and public affairs. Let's not wait for the next general election to make our voices heard. #governmentaffairs #publicaffairs #businessstrategy\n\nZimbabweans make important in roads into the British political space. Historically, UK based Zimbabweans have for a long time been involved in UK politics at different levels from councilor, mayor and now Police Crime Commissioner, which is impressive. These include Mayor Taffy Chikoto, Deputy Mayor Mara Makunura, Police Crime Commissioner Nicole Ndiweni and Elliot Pfebve, who narrowly lost his councillor bid by a few votes. There are a few more Zimbabweans who were also elected councillors throughout the UK. Some say the failure of Zim diaspora political hopefuls in Zim politics has galvanized interest in participation in more democratic UK politics. Next is to move a step higher to match people of Caribbean, Nigerian and Ghanaian extraction who have produced UK MPs, Cabinet Ministers and influential national politicians including the likes of former Treasury Chief Secretary, High Commisioner and now Lord Paul Boateng, Former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng and Minister Kemi Badenock among others. Hopelly, one day we will see an African being elected UK Prime Minister. https://lnkd.in/ewFhbJXz\n\nFor a lot of Labour Party members and supporters this is a high risk moment to be calling for a leadership election, and it is. But better that than to win a general election with a party leader in 10 Downing Street who takes a pragmatic route on moral issues. The facts are clear - regardless of any other considerations - the loss of more than ten thousand Palestinians and Israelis who are dead and untold numbers of injured, physically and mentally, and the daily explosive dismantling of homes and civil infrastructure throughout Gaza is not acceptable human behaviour, and to observe and take no steps to end the slaughter and destruction is to share culpability. We saw the abject failure of ‘humanitarian pauses’ time and again in Syria - for a besieged population they best serve the purposes of war, not of non-combatants. For the Labour Party not to join the call for a ceasefire on humanitarian grounds is morally wrong, and for anyone considering if they can trust Starmer to be a defender of human rights and of the norms of civilised behaviour in office his current stance offers no positive indicators. I should add that, for a lawyer, his grasp of the limits of the ‘right of defence’ in conflict and the absolute responsibility for proportionality in attack are very thin, to be kind. He has time to turn this around and then perhaps choose his advisors more carefully.\n\nAt the height of a post election crisis in 2008, planned national programs in public service reform and accountability had to be shelved. I was requested by bilateral agencies, of a governance funding basket, to #restructure the program matrix (see Danida, 2008). In a few weeks, funds were redirected to make the 2010 new Constitution a reality. Today in #Kenya's #uprising, accurate and comprehensive answers can be provided to the following questions: (a) What Cabinet agenda can forestall radicalizing Gen Z and millenial protestors? If peaceful protest is not tolerated, national IDs and passports issue further delayed and rapid employment not created, young people are likely to opt for violent protest methods. (b) Which local and international institutions have the confidence of the ruling elite in facilitating a #governance transition? (c) What public finance and performance management reforms are likely to have wide and #rapid impact? The current window for change is valuable but won't last long. Let's brainstorm and get to work in supporting this courageous historic uprising.\n\n𝐋𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐖𝐢𝐧𝐬 𝐔𝐊 𝐄𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐢𝐧 𝐚 𝐋𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐬𝐥𝐢𝐝𝐞 Following #Labour's landslide victory in the 4 Jul #GeneralElection, securing 412 of 650 seats, #PrimeMinisterRishiSunak resigned. #KingCharles appointed Labour leader #KeirStarmer as the new Prime Minister to form the next government on 5 Jul. The #Conservatives won only 121 seats. The far-right #ReformUKParty securing four seats, indicating a shift among former Conservative voters towards more extreme positions. The #ScottishNationalParty's representation dropped to nine seats from 47, reflecting a decline due to #LeadershipCrises and #Corruption investigations. In #NorthernIreland, #SinnFein strengthened its position with seven seats, while the #DemocraticUnionistParty saw a decrease in seats compared to the #2019Election. Labour's large majority in the #HouseOfCommons will facilitate passing legislation despite internal dissent. The party has pledged to increase #PublicSpending, fund the #NHS, accelerate #EnergyTransition, enhance workers' rights, create a state-owned energy company, and nationalize #railways. However, the UK's high #FiscalDeficit and #PublicDebt will limit these initiatives. The new Labour government is expected to continue supporting #Ukraine and aligning with #NATO, while seeking improved cooperation with the #EU.

With the Gaza conflict causing many changes of allegiance at the end of 2023, this has continued to be an issue in the first few months of 2024. However, fall-outs relating to the setting of Council budgets have also seen a marked increase in councillors crossing the floor of the council chamber. Another issue causing councillors to become unsettled, is the upcoming local elections coming in May, where some councillors haven’t been re-selected by their political parties. And of course, as well as those making a principled stance on issues, some councillors have found themselves suspended from their own party for a wide range of (often petty) issues. In the first few months of the year, Labour were the biggest losers with 36 councillors moving away from the party, followed closely by the Conservatives who lost 31. The LibDems lost 8 councillors. The biggest winner was the ‘Independents’, who gained over 60 councillors. However, there are a wide variety of Independents, with some Independents leaving to become Independents in another political grouping. Labour gained 15 councillors, and Reform (who have high hopes of attracting former Conservatives) only 3. In the first three months of the year, a sizeable number of councillors, left only to return to the same party – following temporary suspensions, or after realising the grass was not greener elsewhere. Politics is never straight forward! This high turnover of councillors often has little effect on the running of the council, but sometimes it does. It’s important to be in the know, and to know which councillors still hold influence. That’s what keeps us busy here in the Terrapin secret bunker!
