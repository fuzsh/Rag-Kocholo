        "text": "Health Secretary Matt Hancock met former PM David Cameron and financier Lex Greensill for a \"private drink\" in 2019 to discuss a new payment scheme for the NHS, it has been revealed.\n\nIt is the latest in a series of Sunday Times disclosures, external about Mr Cameron's lobbying work since leaving office.\n\nMr Greensill advised Mr Cameron's government, and the ex-PM went on to be employed by Greensill Capital.\n\nAn ally of Mr Hancock said he had \"acted in entirely the correct way\".\n\nThey told the BBC that Mr Hancock had \"updated officials on the business that was discussed, as is appropriate\".\n\nGreensill Capital's scheme, which allowed staff to be paid early for hours they had already worked, went on to be used by some NHS trusts.\n\nThe development is the latest to be published by the Sunday Times detailing Mr Cameron's work for Greensill Capital after he left politics.\n\nMr Hancock is the fourth minister to have been lobbied by Mr Cameron on behalf of the company, which recently collapsed costing 440 jobs.\n\nMr Greensill worked as an unpaid adviser to Mr Cameron when he was prime minister.\n\nThe financier developed a policy designed to help small businesses get their bills paid faster, as part of a scheme that also benefited his own financial company, Greensill Capital.\n\nMr Cameron began working for Greensill Capital after leaving office, and tried unsuccessfully to lobby the government to increase the firm's access to government-backed loans during the first phase of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMr Cameron pressed Treasury officials - and sent text messages to Chancellor Rishi Sunak's personal phone - to access emergency funding for Greensill Capital.\n\nThe \"private drink\" between Mr Hancock, Mr Cameron and Mr Greensill took place in October 2019.\n\nIn August 2019, Mr Greensill wrote to Mr Hancock to set out a proposal to allow the NHS access to an app Greensill Capital had devised, called Earnd, to pay doctors and nurses either daily or weekly in advance and free-of-charge to workers.\n\nHaving received the letter, the health secretary commissioned advice from civil servants to explore the idea.\n\nThe advice was that the \"principle\" of the idea was \"good,\" but sources insisted he wanted other suppliers to be able to offer the same work and it would be up to local NHS managers to decide whether to sign up to it.\n\nSome NHS trusts went on to use Greensill Capital's Earnd app during the pandemic.\n\nA source close to Mr Greensill said the scheme was offered free to both the NHS and its employees, while a source close to Mr Cameron said: \"David Cameron was an enthusiastic champion of Greensill's pay product, Earnd, and met with various people to discuss its rollout across the NHS.\"\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: \"The wellbeing of NHS staff is the top priority of the department and health secretary.\n\n\"Our approach was and is that local NHS employers are best placed to decide how different pay flexibilities fit with their overall pay and reward offer for their staff.\"\n\nLabour's Bridget Phillipson said \"every day brings fresh revelations about the culture of cronyism\" in government and called for a \"full and thorough investigation into what happened\".\n\nThere has been no comment from Mr Cameron or from Mr Greensill."
