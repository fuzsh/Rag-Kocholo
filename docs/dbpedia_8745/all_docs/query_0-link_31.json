        "text": "A government minister has defended the expected award of a knighthood to David Cameron’s controversial general election strategist, Lynton Crosby. Cabinet Office minister Matthew Hancock described Mr Crosby as a “great public servant” and said that it was right that such people were recognised through the honours system.\n\nLabour MPs have accused the Prime Minister of degrading the honours system after it was reported that Mr Crosby was in line for a knighthood in the New Year honours list.\n\nBut Mr Hancock said that there was a long tradition of honouring people for political service.\n\n“He is a great public servant. Political service, I think, is part of public service. People who make a contribution to our democratic process make a public service,” he told BBC Radio 4’s The World at One.\n\n“Services to our democracy are a very important part of making sure we live in this great democratic country where people every few years can kick out their government if they want to.”"
