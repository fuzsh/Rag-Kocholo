        "text": "It says everything about the rise of Matt Hancock that I had to interview him not once, but twice. When GQ first approached the former aide to George Osborne, the MP for West Suffolk was already the secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) – and with his own app, albeit much mocked, to boot. The minister, who has a background in his family’s tech business, had been appointed just six months before, while still in his thirties. But it wasn’t long after our interview that he was promoted to his second cabinet post in the reshuffle that followed Boris Johnson and David Davis flouncing out of cabinet, this time as secretary of state for health and social care. With Theresa May unlikely to challenge Thatcher, Major or Cameron for PM longevity and Johnson surely now a flush so busted that no political plumber could repair it, Hancock was suddenly one of the names in the frame in the Tory succession stakes.\n\nAnd so, this interview took place over two sessions: first while he was at DCMS (and his somewhat evasive answers on Johnson now look rather smart given what happened since) and then again a few weeks after he got his feet under what for a long time was Jeremy Hunt’s desk.\n\nA Remainer who now argues Brexit presents great opportunities and cannot under any circumstances be reversed, a Cameroon who praises the leadership of May, a free-trading Atlanticist who finds it hard to say a good word about Donald Trump, he is not easy to pigeonhole. But, in the main, he gives reasonably straight answers and even when he doesn’t, you get a sense of what he thinks: not a fan of Johnson; not a fan of Trump.\n\nBut if news is what you didn’t know until you asked the questions, perhaps his talking for the first time about his dyslexia will command some attention and begin to flesh out that thing most would-be leaders like to have in today’s world: a “backstory”. We start, though, with my back-handed compliment to the first Tory cabinet minister who had the balls to say yes to my request for an interview.\n\nRight now it is mission critical that we hold both together, because the alternatives are a complete disaster\n\nPart one: 27 June\n\nAlastair Campbell: So, Matt Hancock. What do these people all have in common: Theresa May, David Cameron, George Osborne, Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Philip Hammond and David Davis?\n\nMatt Hancock: They have all been in Conservative cabinets recently.\n\nThey have also all refused to do interviews with me.\n\nThat reminds me of a great story Amber Rudd tells. When she was first elected she was asked to go on Newsnight and she said, “Look, I know you have a list. Go to the bottom of the list and if you can’t find anyone I will do it.” And they said, “You are the bottom of the list.”\n\nI assume you’re doing this because there is a complete breakdown of cabinet collective responsibility. You all think May’s days are numbered, so there is a lot of jockeying for profile going on.\n\nWe have collective responsibility.\n\nIt has to be the biggest rabble we have ever known...\n\nLots of people say politics is about individualism and egos. I happen to think government is best operated as a team.\n\nWhen you have a senior member of the cabinet utter “Fuck business”, do you not feel the conversation should have gone with May saying, “Boris, did you really say ‘Fuck business’?” and he says, “Let me explain,” and she says, “There is no explanation. Just go”?\n\nWell, the truth is that anybody who is a Conservative knows that the way you generate wealth and ultimately all the taxes that pay for public services is through business, people coming together to make something of their lives and to create jobs.\n\nSo we shouldn’t fuck them.\n\nAbsolutely not. And the Conservative Party is the party of business.\n\nSo how can he be foreign secretary when he says what he said?\n\nIt is totally unacceptable to use that sort of language round business.\n\nIf it is unacceptable, he shouldn’t be there.\n\nWell, yeah... I can see where people are coming from. I am not going to say that, but this matters to me: I am in politics because of business. I grew up in a small family business, a tech business...\n\nI was speaking to a conference of head teachers last week – 450 of them. I asked them, “Do you think Theresa May is a good leader?” How many hands do you think went up?\n\nI don’t know. I wasn’t there.\n\nZero. You must hear that as well?\n\nI think in the circumstances we are in, with the need to get the best deal on Brexit, she is actually the best person to do that. I really believe this, because she has an ability to reach across the Conservative Party.\n\nIt’s all about party, not the country.\n\nHolding a government together is about holding the party together as well. And right now it is mission critical that we hold both together, because the alternatives are a complete disaster. One of the things holding both together is the thought of Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell and the catastrophe that would be for the nation.\n\nBut it is because of a lack of anything else. This has got to be the worst set of political leaders we have ever had.\n\nThat is certainly true of the Labour Party.\n\nBoth sides. Jeremy Corbyn got eight votes in my 450, by the way. We are not in a good place on leadership at a time the country needs it most.\n\nIt is a difficult time, but the crucial thing is being able to hold that ship together and get the best deal possible.\n\nGoing back on Brexit would undermine trust in politics for a generation\n\nMurdoch: force for good or bad?\n\nHe has been an incredible force for good. What he has done to drive journalism and investigative journalism, though sometimes uncomfortable for us in politics...\n\nFox News: force for good or bad?\n\nWell, I, erm, I’m glad we have got balance in broadcasting here.\n\nMurdoch is all about non-balance, and you can’t say he has been good overall for standards in journalism.\n\nHis innovations in journalism have been incredible. You have to look at his whole career.\n\nZuckerberg: force for good or bad?\n\nUndoubtedly good, but...\n\nSo Zuckerberg gets a “but”, but Murdoch doesn’t?\n\nThe “but” for Zuckerberg is that he needs to understand and implement a change in philosophy from this attitude of “let everyone get connected and the world will be a better place”, which is a lovely libertarian attitude, but it is not true. It might be true for 95 per cent of people, but there are some bad actors out there and you have to mitigate that. In the offline world we have that balance in place and in the online world we don’t.\n\nI saw nothing from Zuckerberg in those hearings [to Congress] to suggest he has the capacity to change the philosophy. And on these issues of tax, regulation, there is nothing clear to me from governments as to how they would do it.\n\nWe can do that and there is a role for the UK to lead here. On tax, there are undoubtedly ways you can change the tax system. Of course, Facebook, as a public company, would get sued by shareholders if it didn’t try to minimise tax paid. The tax systems were set up for an analogue age and these are digital companies. The fact the goods and services cost zero to produce, they can put the profits wherever they like.\n\nGoogle: force for good or bad?\n\nUndoubtedly good.\n\nAmazon?\n\nSame. They put money in people’s pockets because they make things cheaper. They create audiences for smaller business.\n\nPeople don’t like talking about weakness, but my dyslexia has helped me\n\nIs there not a danger the tech giants are the new oligarchs? What came across with the Zuckerberg hearings is that the politicians didn’t really understand the world he is in and that gives him a massive advantage.\n\nYeah. I think the blinding with science is a serious problem and it takes people who understand the technology but also get the politics and the need of society to be in control to say, “This far and no further.” And I think there is a self-confidence we need, as a body politic, as a society, to say the legitimate rules we have as a society are set collectively, ultimately through parliament. That is how we do it in Britain. There has been this attitude for too long that because the companies are global and people do not understand the technology, we can’t do anything about it and I think that is wrong.\n\nWhat about mental health? We sort of think social media is having a detrimental impact on the mental health of young people in particular, but we don’t really know.\n\nSocial media and technology more broadly. Yes, this includes the law, but a lot of it is about society responding as well. For instance, should head teachers ban phones in the classroom? I think they should. But technology can be an enormous enabler. I’ll give you one example. I have never really talked about this before, but I am dyslexic and I didn’t find that out at school. I found out at university, when a tutor said, “You are good orally, but you cannot get it down on paper.” I think if Microsoft had invented spellcheck five years later it would have had a massive negative impact on my career. By the time I got to the workplace, everything was done on word processors and that solved my very serious spelling problem. I have never talked about this because it’s a weakness, and people don’t like talking about weakness, it makes you feel vulnerable, but with the help of technology, dyslexia helps you think laterally because you have to work your way round problems.\n\nHow does it affect you now?\n\nI am a very slow reader. I have to have things written in a pithy way. Upside is I write in a pithy way as well. It has caused a couple of disasters. I was the agent in the 2001 election in Guildford. You might remember the Tories lost Guildford in 2001.\n\nA very good day for the world.\n\nNick St Aubyn, the sitting MP, wrote his election address and asked me to turn it into a leaflet that went to 50,000 people. It was only after it had been sent out that we noticed a subheading that was meant to say we want to “unite” the community, but I had written we want to “untie” the community. So my dyslexia has got me into trouble, but I feel I can talk about it because I want to say to everyone who is dyslexic that the technology exists to help. The most important thing was being diagnosed.\n\nTrump: force for good or bad?\n\nHe is the president of the United States and I respect the office enormously.\n\nRight. Trump, force for good or bad?\n\nI thought Obama was an absolutely brilliant president.\n\nDonald Trump, force for good or bad?\n\nI believe in the integrity of the values of the West. I find it hard to criticise the US president because I respect the presidency of the US and the US is a huge force for good.\n\nIs there not a danger that, for reasons to do with the special relationship and all that, we normalise and tolerate things that are fundamentally not at all at one with our values?\n\nNo. I think that the danger of the West splintering by just constantly having a go at each other is much more serious than the short-term pleasure I might have articulating what I think about certain individuals.\n\nBut this is why Brexit is so difficult. Part of the West...\n\nThe West is much more than just the US and the EU. It is a series of self-governing nation states in a whole range of multilateral agreements inside a rules-based framework. We’ve chosen not to be within one of them.\n\nAt a time when the president of the United States is sniffy about Nato.\n\nI am happy to criticise decisions of the US administration, but not go personal. But the bigger picture is this: liberal values that put the individual at the core of our politics. And when we limit that freedom, we are doing it to protect people. That’s the Enlightenment philosophy. It is critical to the future of the world; it is at risk.\n\nAt risk from Vladimir Putin, Trump, other countries in Europe.\n\nWe need to defend it.\n\nHow can we do that when we are ripping ourselves out of this thing that has represented those values pretty well for a generation and more?\n\nBut it has also been a pooling of sovereignty and, crucially, we are a democracy. I campaigned to remain in the EU, as you know, and I felt strongly about it. But I also said before the vote that we would respect the result. I said that because I thought we were going to win, but also because I respect democracy more than any individual decision. So we have got to – and this is true as well of you, Alastair – respect the result, because the impact of going back on it would be catastrophic for trust, for the institutions. Those people who voted for Leave, and especially those who feel very strongly about it, would have all of their fears about the establishment confirmed if there was a second referendum and the result was to go back in. That would undermine trust in politics for a generation.\n\nBut you, as an MP who has to vote for the deal, if you do so, knowing it is going to make the country poorer, weaker – and in every deal being looked at those things seem pretty certain – that is equally a big danger to democracy.\n\nFirstly, I don’t accept the premise. I think we are going to get a good deal.\n\nEvery deal on offer is going to make us poorer. You know that.\n\nBut on the other side of the ledger is the enormous downside of overruling a referendum when I have pledged to respect the result. I am not going to do that.\n\nThat also means, then, if you get no deal or a terrible deal we have to do it anyway. So the whole process is pointless.\n\nWe get the best deal that we can and then Britain is going to succeed, because there is something bigger than Brexit and that is a technological revolution. And the countries that succeed, it is not their international arrangements, it is [being at] the forefront of tech that drives their economy and ultimately drives geopolitics.\n\nThe second referendum would be a huge mistake for this country\n\nAnd every assessment says the economy gets weaker.\n\nWe can be at the cutting edge of some unbelievably transformative technologies that are bigger than anything we have had for 100 years. It gives us the opportunity to be incredibly successful.\n\nOnly if we have the right people, innovations, expertise.\n\nYes. And we can do all of that. We have relaxed the rules on visas to encourage tech entrepreneurs.\n\nThe message we are putting out worldwide is this place is shutting down.\n\nWe need to work with the whole world.\n\nWe can do that now.\n\nAnd in the future. That is my point. So let’s get out there and work globally to make a success of it, because the alternative of trying to undermine and reverse a decision...\n\nThat is the only argument left: will of the people.\n\nI have made it from day one.\n\nThe People’s Vote?\n\nThe second referendum would be a huge mistake for this country.\n\nAnd if Brexit is a bigger mistake?\n\nIt is very hard to see a bigger mistake than saying to more than half of the people who voted, “You got it wrong. We are going to ask you again.”\n\nFine with being out of the single market and the customs union?\n\nWhat I want to see is the lowest possible barriers to trade, but there is also this upside, that there has been in this country a sense of being done to and us not being sovereign for a long time.\n\nYou don’t think Brexit is part of the drift to right-wing populism?\n\nLots of people who have that view campaigned and agitated for Brexit. But I think it has been a pressure valve. There are still far-right people, but they don’t have any purchase as they have in other countries and I put that down to the surprise a lot of those people have that when the country voted for Brexit we said we believe in democracy and we are going to do it... I haven’t persuaded you yet, have I?\n\nNo. Very depressed.\n\nWe just announced £20 billion for the NHS.\n\nAs a way of saying “we’re not just about Brexit” and the “Brexit dividend” fell apart within 24 hours.\n\nYou’re overanalysing.\n\nAnd Hammond says to the rest of you, “Nothing for defence. DCMS, cut your budgets...” N’est-ce pas?\n\nFinding £20bn for the NHS and with the discussion of where tax should rise... [is] important.\n\nWas breaking your manifesto OK?\n\n[The Conservatives] are clearly the party of lower taxes.\n\nPart two: 4 August\n\nIs cabinet a better place since Boris Johnson and David Davis went?\n\nThere is definitely less leaking. We are still grappling with big issues.\n\nDo you not think they quit because, as Brexit architects, it dawned on them it cannot be done?\n\nThey have to set out their own reasons for leaving cabinet. I don’t agree with them, because the proposals on the table reflect where we are, the EU is beginning to engage on them. I believe we can get a good deal and I am confident we will.\n\nOne of the first things I did was increase mental health support in schools\n\nSo you don’t share my view that the reason the Chequers deal fell apart is that it is incoherent, inconsistent and unacceptable to the Europeans?\n\nNo. I think a good deal is in the interests of both sides and that gives me confidence we can get there.\n\nIs there not a part of you thinking, “I just wish we weren’t doing this”?\n\nYou have to face life as it is, not how you want to be. It is happening. We have to make the best of it.\n\nSteve Bannon. What the hell are the likes of Johnson, Gove and Jacob Rees-Mogg doing consorting with him?\n\nYou’ll have to ask them.\n\nIf Bannon called you and asked for a meeting to discuss Tory ideas...\n\nHe hasn’t.\n\nDo you think Johnson is finished as potential leader\n\nThere isn’t a vacancy.\n\nDon’t give me the bullshit answer.\n\nThere isn’t a vacancy. He has been the clear leader of the Brexit side of the argument for some time.\n\nIs that good for him or bad for him?\n\nJust a statement of fact. I’m not getting into this. The right leader for today is...\n\nChris Grayling...\n\n[Laughs.] Theresa May.\n\nWhat was the Chequers meeting like?\n\nWe had a debate about substance and then we all discussed how we take the message out. It wasn’t till the weekend that people started considering their positions.\n\nDid you sense it being historic?\n\nIt felt like a big moment, a move to a position you can see the EU engaging with.\n\nMeanwhile, we’re talking of stockpiling food and medicines.\n\nOne of the first things I did as health secretary was accelerate the preparation for no deal. It is not the likeliest outcome and not the one I want, but we have to prepare for all eventualities. It means ensuring the companies that supply to the NHS have the right level of supplies.\n\nSo you are confident May will get her insulin and I will get my antidepressants whatever happens?\n\nI am confident.\n\nMaking sure we support the services that help people stay healthy is a critical part of the long-term plan\n\nMark Carney has said the economy has already suffered, we have gone from fastest- to slowest-growing economy in the G7 and no deal would be a huge hit.\n\nThe economic risks I expected have not materialised in the same way. We have record levels of investment, record levels of employment, a wall of investment waiting to come in if we get a good deal. Of course I want to see a good deal. I am a pro-business Conservative. And there is a wider thing as well. The vote was not just about economics.\n\nHow did you feel when May moved you from culture to health?\n\nSurprised – though the threshold for surprise in our politics in the past couple of years is pretty high. I was enjoying DCMS, especially the digital, but the responsibility to be secretary of state for health and social care is a heavy one and I’m enjoying it.\n\nThere is something weird about our system that one day you’re Mr Supposed To Know Everything About Culture, then you’re Mr Health the next.\n\nThe system ensures you always have high-quality experts around you, especially in health – people in the department and the NHS. Then the politician can decide on direction and communicate it, has the ability to run a department. So with these experts...\n\nI thought Gove said we’d had enough of experts.\n\nI disagree with him on that. Also, having spent several years on digital, I can bring that experience to bear on health care and improving the lives of people working in the NHS. The three priority themes I set out are workforce, technology, prevention.\n\nA lot of the staff feel put upon.\n\nThey are not valued enough for what they do and also have outdated working practices that technology can help improve. The opportunities are huge – artificial intelligence in research and cures, rostering, better integration with social care – making it easier for patients to look after their own health. The prevention side is so important. We can save in the long run if we spend more to keep people out of hospital. That is the way to ensure the NHS is sustainable.\n\nIs your commitment to the principles of the NHS rock solid?\n\nYes, I am in enthusiastic agreement with the fundamental tenets, treatment free at the point of delivery, regardless of ability to pay.\n\nAnd that system can stay long-term?\n\nIt is sustainable so long as we ensure that the NHS uses the resources it gets and integrates with other parts of social provision, especially social care.\n\nWe must transform for 21st-century care. Tech is a big part of that\n\nI was disappointed you didn’t make more of mental health in your first speech.\n\nEvidence is increasingly clear that physical and mental are linked and all three of my themes relate to mental health. You need a high-quality, well-motivated workforce, better use of technology and early intervention. This is as true in mental health as in cancer or anything else.\n\nSo you can promise that, with funds tight, mental health services will not take their usual place as the easiest to cut?\n\nMaking sure we support the services that help people stay healthy is a critical part of the long-term plan and is especially important in mental health. One of the first things I did was increase mental health support in schools, an area I had already engaged in due to the impact of social media.\n\nIn the scheme of things, how much is £20bn?\n\nTwenty billion over five years means that we can guarantee the future of the NHS. The task in writing the long-term plan is to be as transformative as possible. It can’t be swallowed up just by keeping things stable, but we must transform for 21st-century care. Technology is a big part of that and over time can lead to big savings – savings on costs as well as lives.\n\nBut it’s not a “Brexit dividend”, is it?\n\nWell... [Pauses. Laughs.] There will be money we currently give into Europe that we will be able to spend on the NHS. But this is not the only part of it.\n\nYes, not a Brexit dividend.
