Bloomberg’s team — including my Readout buddy Ruth David — exclusively revealed overnight the decision by the homegrown technology giant to list in the US later this year. They are shunning a London listing on account of persistent political instability and too shallow an investor base.\n\n“Arm is a jewel of the UK tech industry” Ruth and Amy Thomson write. “Its technology is found in most of the world’s smartphones and is pervasive across the electronics industry … [the] decision to bypass Arm’s home exchange is raising questions among tech veterans about the government’s approach to tech companies and IPOs, which have historically lagged behind the US. ”"
