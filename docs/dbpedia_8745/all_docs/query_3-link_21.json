        "text": "Political figures across Suffolk have had their say on the shock appointment of David Cameron as Foreign Secretary.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak appointed now Lord Cameron of Chipping Norton to the Foreign Office in the wake of the sacking of Suella Braverman and the subsequent move to the Home Office of James Cleverly.\n\nCameron had not been involved in front-line politics for over seven years, vacating 10 Downing Street after the European Referendum, in which he strongly campaigned for the UK to remain.\n\nPolitical figures in Suffolk have reacted with a mix of happiness, disapproval and somewhat bemusement at his return.\n\nDr Dan Poulter, MP for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, entered parliament when Cameron was first elected as Prime Minister, and said of his former leader: “I welcome David Cameron’s return to Government.\n\n“At a time of unprecedented international turbulence with the terrorist acts of Hamas against innocent Israelis, an emerging humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and the ongoing war in Ukraine, we now have an internationally respected statesman as Foreign Secretary and there are very few people who could be better qualified to lead Britain's diplomatic efforts than Lord Cameron.”\n\nDr. Poulter also served in Cameron’s government, as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health Services.\n\nCliff Waterman, leader of West Suffolk Council, said that a comedy outfit was now running our country, thought that serious questions needed to be asked of the appointment and questioned Cameron’s integrity after the Greensill scandal.\n\nHe said: “When the government appoints a failed leader it’s not a good look – it shows that Rishi Sunak is very weak.\n\n“Obviously there’s the Greensill scandal as well which begs a question of integrity, but also what is his opinion on the EU; he campaigned in favour of staying in, but those who voted for Boris Johnson at the last election are very much against links with Europe.\n\n“There are so many things going wrong across the country; just look here in West Suffolk we’ve got a terrible potholes problem.\n\n“There is a massive ticking time bomb, we just need an election, get this government out and have a fresh start.”\n\n“We’ve got a comedy outfit running our country – bring on the next general election.”\n\nCllr Waterman also mentioned that, whilst the West Suffolk area is a traditionally safe Conservative area, people need to believe that changes can happen, and that Labour have a programme to revive the economy, including closing tax loopholes and planning and pension reforms.\n\nMatt Hancock, MP for West Suffolk, was also first elected when Cameron won the keys to 10 Downing Street, and praised Rishi Sunak for the appointment in a tweet.\n\nHe said: “Brilliant decision by the PM to make David Cameron Foreign Secretary; superb for the UK – bringing his experience to guide us through difficult times.\n\n“Excellent for the Conservatives, showing Rishi Sunak will fight the election on the centre ground – Bravo.”\n\nHancock served as Paymaster General in Cameron’s second government, and later played a more prominent role in the cabinet under Theresa May and Boris Johnson, serving as Culture and Health Secretary.\n\nHowever, he has now had the Conservative whip removed and sits as an independent MP after appearing on I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here.\n\nDavid Beavan, deputy leader of East Suffolk Council, said he thought that Cameron’s appointment was a show of desperation from the government, saying: “It’s great to see that the Tories are into recycling.\n\n“They’re really scraping the bottom of the barrel now, they’ve run out of ideas; it’s the last throw of the dice for the government.\n\n“I think it shows just how desperate they are – I’m looking forward to the next general election.\n\n“They’ll be out by the next election anyways and at a local level we’re really looking forward to having a more responsible government to work with.”\n\nCllr Beavan stood in the 2019 parliamentary election at the South Suffolk constituency, parts of which will be transferred to the new Waveney Valley constituency, where Mid-Suffolk District Council leader Andy Mellen believes there is a real chance of putting on a show against the Conservatives.\n\n“People I speak to are looking for someone other than the Tories to vote for, and here in the new Waveney Valley constituency, the Green candidate Adrian Ramsay is the only realistic alternative and his campaign is gathering momentum.\n\n“Former Prime Minister David, now Lord, Cameron is someone with stature and experience, and he re-emerges onto the world stage at a time when there are a lot of big, intractable problems for him to grapple with.\n\n“I hope he can make some positive progress with Ukraine, the Middle East and the other problems around the world.\n\n“But beyond the current conflicts the horrific prospect of runaway climate change is looming, and here his record is not good.”\n\nCllr Mellen made reference to Cameron’s government in 2014 ripping up the Code for Sustainable Homes alongside other environmental regulations, which he says has led to a decade of homes being built to lower environmental standards, which costs residents more to heat and produces greater carbon emissions.\n\nCameron is able to serve in cabinet by virtue of Rishi Sunak giving him a peerage, which allows him to sit in the House of Lords.\n\nMost departments of state often have a minister in them from the Lords to assist the passage of legislation, but rarely does a Secretary of State come from the Lords nowadays, with the last instance of this being Nicky Morgan’s spell as culture secretary from 2019 to 2020.\n\nThe last time the Foreign Secretary came from the Lords was Lord Carrington between 1979 and 1982, under Margaret Thatcher.\n\nJack Abbott, Labour MP candidate for Ipswich, believes Cameron’s appointment represents a lack of commitment to change, saying: “Bringing back David Cameron puts to bed any laughable notion that Rishi Sunak will offer any sort of change after 13 years of Conservative failure.\n\n\"Over the last few years we've seen a revolving door of Prime Ministers, and dozens upon dozens of Conservative MPs have played pass the parcel with crucially important jobs.\n\n\"While they must think some sort of game, their lack of seriousness and total incompetence has led to a cost of living crisis and our public services being pushed to breaking point. No wonder our country is in such a mess.\n\n\"We don't need another merry-go-round from the Conservatives. We need a completely fresh start with a Labour government which will get our future back.\"\n\nIt is expected the next general election will be held at some point around autumn 2024.\n\nMPs Dr Therese Coffey and Jo Churchill were approached for comment."
