        "text": "Health Secretary Matt Hancock went for a “private drink” with David Cameron and financier Lex Greensill to discuss a payment scheme for the NHS, it has been revealed.\n\nAn ally of Mr Hancock told The Sunday Times a drink took place between Mr Cameron, the health secretary and the Australian financier in October 2019.\n\nMr Greensill was said to have pitched a flexible scheme to pay doctors and nurses either daily or weekly, a proposal which was later adopted by the NHS.\n\nIt was announced in October last year that Earnd, a mobile app that was then a division of Greensill, would be available free-of-charge to NHS employees to access their pay.\n\nFollowing thier meeting, Mr Hancock was said to have referred Mr Greensill to work directly with the NHS rather than his department.\n\nBut a source close to Mr Hancock said: “Matt acted in entirely the correct way – he updated officials on the business that was discussed, as is appropriate.”\n\nAccording to The Sunday Times, the Treasury also reconsidered Mr Greensill’s application for an emergency coronavirus loan after Mr Cameron messaged Boris Johnson.\n\nThe former Prime Minister was said to have described the decision to exclude his employer’s firm, Greensill Capital, from the multibillion-pound scheme as “nuts”.\n\nThe developments are the latest in a lobbying controversy that has dogged Mr Cameron in recent weeks.\n\nQuestions were mounting over his efforts to secure access for the finance company, which later collapsed putting thousands of UK steelmaking jobs at risk.\n\nMr Cameron is yet to comment publicly, but a source close to him said: “David Cameron was an enthusiastic champion of Greensill’s pay product, Earnd, and met with various people to discuss its rollout across the NHS.”\n\nA DHSC spokesman said: “The wellbeing of NHS staff is the top priority of the department and Health Secretary.\n\n“Our approach was and is that local NHS employers are best placed to decide how different pay flexibilities fit with their overall pay and reward offer for their staff.”\n\nA No 10 spokesman said: “Throughout the pandemic, an immense number of businesses contacted Downing Street with representations; these were passed on to relevant departments.”\n\nThis week, it emerged that Chancellor Rishi Sunak responded to private texts from Mr Cameron saying he had “pushed” officials to consider plans that could have helped Greensill in 2020.\n\nLabour called for Mr Sunak to “come out of hiding” and make a statement to Parliament about the “growing scandal”, and reiterated demands for an investigation.\n\nShadow chief secretary to the treasury Bridget Phillipson said: “Every day brings fresh revelations about the culture of cronyism at the heart of this Conservative Government.\n\n“Through David Cameron, Greensill looks to have had the run of Government from Number 10 down, including access to millions of pounds of public money.”\n\nLabour MP Dame Margaret Hodge, a former chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said: “We need an independent inquiry immediately. The whole scandal stinks.”\n\nAdditional reporting from the Press Association"
