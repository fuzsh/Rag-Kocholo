        "text": "More than 100 MPs have said they will not be standing at the next general election.\n\nThose who have announced their intention to leave parliament range from the longest-serving female MP, Labour's Harriet Harman, to one of those only elected at the last election in 2019, Conservative MP Dehenna Davison.\n\nRead more: How does the number of MPs stepping down compare to previous years?\n\nThis election is seeing the constituency boundaries changed, leading to some MPs deciding to step aside as their seat is gutted or entirely excised.\n\nThe vast majority of those leaving are Conservatives, with more than 75 Tory MPs stepping aside - exceeding the number in 1997.\n\nThe average age of Labour MPs standing down is 66 - a full ten years higher than the Conservatives at 56 and the SNP at 55.\n\nHere is a full list of all the MPs standing down at the next election:\n\nMichael Gove (CON)\n\nThe housing secretary announced he would not be standing as an MP after Rishi Sunak called the general election.\n\nHe has served in a variety of senior positions in government, including environment secretary, justice secretary, chancellor of Duchy of Lancaster and education secretary.\n\nHis Surrey Heath constituency is vulnerable to the Liberal Democrats, where he has a majority of 18,349.\n\nHe was first elected in 2005.\n\nAndrea Leadsom (CON)\n\nFormer leadership contender Andrea Leadsom announced she would be leaving the Commons shortly after Michael Gove.\n\nFormally a cabinet minister, she is currently serving as a junior minister in the health department.\n\nShe unsuccesfully stood against Theresa May to lead the party in the wake of the Brexit referendum.\n\nNadhim Zahawi (CON)\n\nThe former COVID vaccines minister and chancellor announced he would not stand in a flamboyant letter quoting his \"most famous constituent\" - William Shakespeare.\n\n\"Parting is such sweet sorrow,\" he said.\n\nMr Zahawi became Stratford-on-Avon's MP in 2010 and was made education secretary by Boris Johnson then was responsible for the COVID vaccine roll-out before becoming chancellor for just two months.\n\nHe was born in Baghdad, Iraq, but fled Saddam Hussein's rule with his family aged 11 to live in London.

It will be renamed Reading West and Mid Berkshire.\n\nBen Wallace (CON)\n\nBen Wallace was appointed defence secretary by Boris Johnson when he became prime minister in 2019.\n\nMr Wallace stayed in the job when Mr Johnson was ousted from Downing Street and remained in post during the short tenure of Liz Truss - and continued in the role when Rishi Sunak became PM.\n\nThe announcement he was stepping down at the next election came after rumours he had tried and failed to become the next leader of NATO.\n\nDominic Raab (CON)\n\nFormer justice secretary and deputy prime minister Dominic Raab has been an MP since 2010.\n\nHis decision came a month after he quit Rishi Sunak's cabinet in the wake of a bullying probe concluding he acted in an \"intimidating way\" and was \"unreasonably and persistently aggressive\" in meetings.\n\nMr Raab is currently the Conservative MP for Esher and Walton in Surrey, where a slender majority of 2,743 has made his seat a key target for the Lib Dems.\n\nSajid Javid (CON)\n\nA senior minister in a number of roles in recent years, Sajid Javid will not stand in his Bromsgrove constituency at the next election.\n\nHe was unsuccessful in his bid for Conservative Party leadership in 2022 and has previously served as chancellor, health secretary and business secretary.\n\nBromsgrove is considered a safe Conservative seat, with Mr Javid winning a majority of just over 23,000 in the 2019.\n\nMatt Hancock (CON)\n\nThe former health secretary wrote to Rishi Sunak in December to let him know he would not be standing for the Conservatives at the next election.\n\nHe was suspended from the party after he announced he was going on reality TV show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, but said in his letter the chief whip \"made clear\" he would restore the whip \"in due course, but that is now not necessary\".\n\nMr Hancock, who has a 23,194 majority in his West Suffolk constituency, resigned as health secretary in 2021 after breaking COVID rules.\n\nLeaked CCTV showed him kissing an aide in his office, in contravention of social distancing rules in place at the time.\n\nMr Hancock had his suspension lifted when the election was called as a gesture of \"goodwill\".\n\nGeorge Eustice (CON)\n\nFormer environment secretary George Eustice said it was a \"difficult decision\", but after 15 years as the MP for Camborne and Redruth, he wants to take the opportunity to have another career outside politics.\n\nThe senior Tory was secretary of state under Boris Johnson, from February 2020 until September 2022.\n\nSir Graham Brady (CON)\n\nSir Graham Brady, chairman of the influential 1922 committee of backbench Tory MPs, announced in March 2023 that he would be bringing his chapter as a politician \"to a close\" while still \"young enough to pursue other opportunities and interests\".\n\nThe 55-year-old has represented Altrincham and Sale West for the past 26 years and has been chairman of the committee since 2010, bar a brief period in 2019.\n\nBut it is only in the last few years that he has become something of a household name - with his visits to Number 10 seen as spelling the end for recent prime ministers.\n\nWill Wragg (CON)\n\nSenior Tory Mr Wragg has also confirmed he will not run again in the Hazel Grove constituency in Greater Manchester he has held since 2015.\n\nHe took the seat from the Liberal Democrats and, in doing so, became the first Conservative MP to represent the constituency since 1997.\n\nMr Wragg had been one of the Conservative MPs most critical of former PM Mr Johnson and also publicly demanded Liz Truss quit as leader following her disastrous mini-budget.\n\nChloe Smith (CON)\n\nThe former work and pensions secretary is another Conservative MP who has announced she will not continue her parliamentary career.\n\nMs Smith, who served in Liz Truss's cabinet during her brief tenure in Number 10, has held the Norwich North seat since 2009.\n\nWhen elected, she became the youngest MP aged just 27.\n\nDouglas Ross (CON)\n\nThe leader of the Scottish Conservatives has said he will not stand again at Westminster in order to focus on Holyrood and being an MSP.\n\nHe has served as MP for Moray since 2017.\n\nSir Charles Walker (CON)\n\nBroxbourne MP Sir Charles Walker has announced he will not seek re-election after more than 15 years in Westminster.\n\nHe has served as chair of the procedure committee and was knighted in 2019 for \"political and public service\".\n\nOn his return to the backbenches, Sir Charles became a vocal opponent of COVID lockdown restrictions, including an infamous speech where he promised to walk around London with a pint of milk in protest against an extension to emergency powers being extended in 2021.\n\nRobin Walker (CON)\n\nThe Worcester MP has held the seat since 2010 and served as an education minister and Northern Ireland minister in Boris Johnson's government.\n\nHe said he was stepping down because he needed to prioritise his family.\n\nSteve Brine (CON)\n\nThe current chair of the Health and Social Care Committee, Mr Brine, said he would be seeking to start a \"new chapter\" in his life following 13 years representing Winchester in Hampshire - where he has a small majority of just 985.\n\nSir Bill Cash (CON)\n\nThe MP for Stone has announced he will not be standing again after a 40 year parliamentary career.\n\nHe has represented both Stone and earlier Stafford during his period in the Commons.\n\nSir Bill is perhaps most notable for his vocal and consistent criticisms of the European Union, and became one of the most prominent voices of the Brexit movement.\n\nChris Heaton-Harris (CON)\n\nThe Northern Ireland Secretary said in a letter to Rishi Sunak that he won't be fighting to keep his seat at the general election, but that he would continue to campaign for the Conservatives.\n\nHe was first elected as the MP for Daventry, Northamptonshire, in 2010 and said it had been an \"honour and a privilege to serve\".\n\nMuch of his time in Northern Ireland was spent negotiating with parties in efforts to restore the assembly amid a row over post-Brexit trading arrangements.\n\nJo Churchill (CON)\n\nWork and Pensions minister Jo Churchill announced she will not be standing a day after Rishi Sunak called the snap election.\n\nThe Bury St Edmunds MP, who has represented the seat since 2015, said she had reached the decision for \"family reasons\".\n\nEleanor Laing (CON)\n\nDame Eleanor Laing is currently the deputy speaker of the House of Commons, and also chair of ways and means.\n\nThis latter title means she leads the debate following the budget.\n\nDame Eleanor has been an MP since 1997, and served as a shadow minister under Michael Howard and David Cameron -
