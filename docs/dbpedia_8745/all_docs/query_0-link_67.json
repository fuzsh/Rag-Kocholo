        "text": "\"Imagine if this disease had tragically killed children as much as it did old people. Would it then be possible to... halt the spread? Of course it would, we would do whatever it took,\" he said.\n\nAs a result, measures to slow the spread of a pandemic such as \"stockpiles, testing, antivirals and contact tracing\" were not prioritised and \"we had to build them from scratch when the pandemic struck,\" he said.\n\nInstead, the focus had been \"can we buy enough body bags?\" and \"where are we going to bury the dead?\", added Hancock.\n\nThe former health secretary said he was \"profoundly sorry for the impact\" of the lack of preparedness.\n\n\"I also understand why, for some, it will be hard to take that apology from me.\n\n\"And all I can do is ensure that this inquiry gets to the bottom of it, and that for the future, we learn the right lessons, so that we stop a pandemic in its tracks much, much earlier.\"\n\nAssurances from civil servants and the World Health Organisation (WHO) that the UK was well placed to deal with a pandemic \"turned out to be wrong\", he added.\n\nHancock, who was forced to quit in June 2021, is the latest high-profile politician to appear before the Covid-19 Inquiry into government preparedness for the pandemic.\n\nFormer prime minister David Cameron, former chancellor George Osborne and chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty have all given evidence.\n\nThe UK suffered one of the worst Covid-19 death tolls in Europe with more than 128,500 fatalities recorded by mid-July 2021.\n\nThe government faced criticism for not taking the threat seriously enough in the early stages of the outbreak, and of not having enough protective equipment for frontline medical staff.\n\nChaired by retired senior judge Heather Hallett, the first phase of the inquiry is focusing on the UK's resilience and preparedness.\n\nRelatives of people who died have already condemned the inquiry for failing to include them.\n\njwp/har/yad"
