        "text": "More than two weeks into public hearings, the Covid inquiry has been a trial in search of a defendant.\n\nLady Hallett has heard from witness after witness testifying about mistakes made, pandemic plans not refreshed and civil servants focusing on the wrong type of virus – but nobody has held their hands up and taken personal responsibility.\n\nDavid Cameron and George Osborne, giving evidence last week, not only denied their austerity policies hampered the ability of the public services to respond to Covid, but insisted those cuts put the country in a better position to fight a pandemic.\n\nLast year, counsel KC Hugo Keith told a preliminary hearing that the inquiry would expose “culpable and discreditable conduct” and identify “plainly wrongful decision-making and significant errors of judgement”. It’s just that, so far, no-one has wanted to take responsibility for wrongful decision-making or significant errors of judgement.\n\nThis unhappy state of affairs was until Matt Hancock took to the witness box on Tuesday morning. In the absence of Boris Johnson – who will be a key witness in module 2 into the government’s response when the virus broke out – Mr Hancock was always going to be a lightning rod for the anger and distress that families bereaved by Covid feel.\n\nThis is not least because he infamously said, during the early weeks of the pandemic, that the government was throwing a “protective ring” around care homes, a statement that did not turn out to be true.\n\nIt is also clear that Mr Hancock is maligned in the public realm because of things not directly connected to the pandemic – he broke lockdown rules by cheating on his wife, and then went on TV to seek public forgiveness.\n\nBut in 2020, unlike the then prime minister, Mr Hancock was one of the more proactive ministers dealing with the crisis that swept through the country and government. He called Cobra meetings, pushed earlier than others for measures to limit the spread, oversaw his own – at the time risky – pledge to scale up Covid testing to 100,000 a day by the end of April 2020, and was ridiculed by No 10 insiders who (wrongly) claimed he was the “only one” in government who believed a coronavirus vaccine was on its way.\n\nIs it fair that his efforts back then are clouded by what he did in his personal life later on?\n\nMr Hancock’s testimony was blisteringly frank and honest. Clearly emotional, he said he was sorry for “each death” linked to Covid in the UK – a toll that exceeds 225,000.\n\nHe blamed the “completely wrong” approach by the government to prepare for the consequences of a deadly pandemic, such as buying up body bags, rather than trying to limit its effects in the UK, that planning for the impact on social care was “terrible”, and that it was an “absolute tragedy” that there was a systemic failure.\n\nThe inquiry has heard a lot about problems with the system – rather than individuals – including the spaghetti-like structures of contingency planning, a tendency towards groupthink and an apparently institutionalised focus on flu rather than a novel virus.\n\nAs Mr Keith said at the end of Mr Hancock’s evidence, referring to those on the front line who had to cope with Covid when it emerged, it was a case of “lions led by structural donkeys … everyone gave their all but the system was not fit for purpose”.\n\nBut unlike other witnesses, including officials, politicians and scientists, Mr Hancock was willing to carry the can.\n\nAsked by Mr Keith whether he bore responsibility for the “calamitous state of affairs”, the former minister replied: “I bear responsibility for all the things that happened not only in my department, but also the agencies that reported to me as secretary of state.”"
