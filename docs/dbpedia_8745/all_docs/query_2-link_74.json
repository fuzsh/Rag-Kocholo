        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSajid Javid — Chancellor of the Exchequer\n\nThe former Home Secretary was one of the frontrunners to bag the job of Chancellor in Johnson's government. He ran for prime minister alongside Johnson, but unlike Hunt, he drew his punches from the frontrunner.\n\nA long-term Eurosceptic, Javid surprised many by supporting the Remain campaign while part of David Cameron's government. However, he has since reverted to being a Brexit supporter.\n\nUnlike Johnson, he comes from a relatively modest background, before becoming a high-flying banker. His decision to enter politics reportedly cost him 98% of his earnings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPriti Patel — Home Secretary\n\nPriti Patel was sacked from Theresa May's government in 2017 after holding unauthorised meetings with Israeli politicians, without informing the UK government.\n\nHer return to government as Home Secretary will be controversial. A strong right-winger, Patel has previously been an advocate for bringing back the death penalty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDominic Raab — Foreign Secretary and First Secretary of State (de facto deputy prime minister)\n\nDominic Raab is another strident Brexiteer handed a senior role in Johnson's administration.\n\nHe served as Brexit Secretary before resigning in protest against May's deal with the EU.\n\nLike Patel, Raab is on the right of the party and has made a series of controversial statements, including labeling feminists \"obnoxious bigots.\" A number of moderate Conservative MPs worked together in a campaign to derail his bid to lead the Tory party.\n\nStephen Barclay — Brexit Secretary\n\nBarclay keeps his job as Brexit secretary after staying out of the leadership contest. It remains unclear whether the Brexit department will retain its current role under Johnson or will, as has been widely reported, changed into a ministry for preparing for a no-deal Brexit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMichael Gove — Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster\n\nGove and Johnson have a long and fraught relationship.\n\nThe two men worked closely together in the campaign for Brexit. However, Gove's decision to enter the 2016 Conservative leadership contest scuppered Johnson's bid and led to May's victory. The two men have reportedly reconciled in recent months.\n\nGove has held a number of Cabinet positions, most recently the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.\n\nBen Wallace — Defence Secretary\n\nWallace is another early supporter of Johnson to be handed a senior role. He will replace Penny Mordaunt, who surprised many in Westminster by backing Johnson's rival Jeremy Hunt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiz Truss — Secretary of State for International Trade\n\nTruss was a prominent outrider in Johnson's campaign and had reportedly hoped to be made Chancellor. She is a keen advocate of free-market policies and is popular with the Conservative party's younger members.\n\nMatt Hancock - Health Secretary\n\nHancock was a prominent supporter of Johnson's leadership bid after his own came to an end early in the race. Mocked by opponents during the campaign for his willingness to completely reverse his previous opposition to leaving the EU without a deal, Hancock's elasticity was not rewarded with a promotion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheresa Villiers — Environment Secretary\n\nVilliers is yet another member of the Vote Leave campaign to be handed a senior role in Johnson's administration.\n\nGavin Williamson — Education Secretary\n\nWilliamson was sacked by Theresa May after being accused of being the source of a leak about a government deal with the Chinese telecoms company Huawei. Reportedly one of the key players in securing Johnson's victory among MPs, he is rewarded with a senior role in Johnson's administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNicky Morgan — Culture Secretary\n\nMorgan is one of just a few Remainers in Johnson's government. However, despite previously advocating to remain in the EU, Morgan has worked closely with prominent Brexiteers in recent months towards proposals for an alternative Brexit deal.\n\nAndrea Leadsom — Business Secretary\n\nThe former Leader of the House is a committed Brexiteer who twice campaigned to become prime minister. After being eliminated from this contest, she switched her support to Johnson and has been rewarded with a prime role.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert Jenrick — Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government\n\nAmber Rudd — Work and Pensions Secretary\n\nRudd campaigned for Remain and will be one of the few senior voices in Johnson's Cabinet who will advise against leaving the EU without a deal. She was forced to resign as Home Secretary last year over the Windrush scandal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert Buckland — Justice Secretary\n\nAlok Sharma — International Development Secretary\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrant Shapps — Transport Secretary\n\nGrant Shapps was one of the key figures in the plot last year to oust Theresa May as prime minister. He was forced out of his role as Conservative Party chairman in David Cameron's government in 2015, following allegations of bullying among members of the party.\n\nAlun Cairns — Welsh Secretary\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJulian Smith — Northern Ireland Secretary\n\nSmith was Chief Whip in Theresa May's government and had the incredibly difficult task of trying to maintain Conservative party discipline. Now he's got another difficult task in overseeing Northern Ireland at a time when it is without a government and at the centre of Brexit uncertainty.\n\nAlister Jack — Scottish Secretary\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaroness Evans — Leader of the Lords\n\nGeoffrey Cox — Attorney General\n\nCox will continue in his role of giving legal advice to the government. It was his advice on the nature of the backstop that at least partly made a number of Conservative MPs decide to oppose a revised version of Theresa May's deal with the EU.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRishi Sunak — Chief Secretary to the Treasury\n\nJames Cleverly — Minister without Portfolio and Conservative Party Chair\n\nJames Cleverly was one of Johnson's most prominent supporters during the campaign and worked alongside him during his time as Mayor of London, when Cleverly was a London Assembly Member and Chair of the London Fire Authority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEsther McVey — Housing Minister\n\nMcVey was Work & Pensions Secretary under May.\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg — Leader of the House\n\nRees-Mogg's appointment is one of the most eye-catching. Dubbed by other members of Parliament as \"Honourable Member for the 18th century,\" Mogg is a cartoonish figure who plays up his aristocratic background and, like Johnson himself, inspires a loyal following among many Conservative activists.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrandon Lewis — Home Office Minister\n\nLewis has been given a policy brief having previously served as the Conservative party's chairman. He played a big part in overseeing the contest to succeed May as party leader.\n\nJo Johnson — Minister of State for Business and Education\n\nBoris's brother Jo has been handed a new job less than nine months after he resigned from Theresa May's government in protest over Brexit. After resigning he joined the campaign for a second Brexit referendum, claiming that the public had been duped over the original decision to leave the EU. His return to a government committed to a potential no-deal Brexit, under his brother, is one of the most remarkable developments in this reshuffle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOliver Dowden — Paymaster General, and Minister for the Cabinet Office\n\nKwasi Kwarteng — Business Minister\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJake Berry — Minister of State, Cabinet Office and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government\n\nOur Brexit Insider Facebook group is the best place for up-to-date news and analysis about Britain’s departure from the EU, direct from Business Insider’s political reporters. Join here.\n\nRead next\n\nBoris Johnson\n\nAdvertisement"
