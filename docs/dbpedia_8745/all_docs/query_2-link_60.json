        "text": "Nadhim Zahawi\n\nThe former chancellor said in a letter published on X that he had “come to feel that the time is right for a new, energetic Conservative to fight for the honour of representing Stratford-on-Avon and assuming the mantle of MP for Shakespeare”.\n\nHe added: “Parting is such sweet sorrow. I would like to thank all of my parliamentary staff and colleagues, civil service officials, special advisers, and everyone else who has ever given me advice, praise, or kept me in check with criticism.\n\n“My mistakes have been mine, and my successes have come from working with, and leading, amazing people.”\n\nDominic Raab\n\nMr Raab, the former deputy prime minister and justice secretary, cited “increasing concern” about pressure placed on his young family when he announced his intention to step down shortly after quitting the Cabinet over bullying claims from civil servants. He has also held the titles of Brexit secretary and foreign secretary.\n\nSir John Redwood\n\nSir John, a former Cabinet minister who served as the head of Margaret Thatcher’s No10 policy unit, became the 73rd Tory MP to stand down on May 24, two days after the election was called.\n\nSir John, who entered Parliament in 1987, wrote on his website: “I have decided not to put my name forward in the forthcoming election. I have other things I wish to do.\n\n“It has been a privilege to represent Wokingham in nine Parliaments. I have drawn many of my campaigns from the views I have heard on doorsteps and read in my email box. We have achieved good things together for our local community and the wider nation.”\n\nCraig Mackinlay\n\nCraig Mackinlay, who was welcomed back into the Commons on May 22 after losing his arms and legs to sepsis, was reported to have stood down two days after.\n\nIn a statement given to GB News, Mr Mackinlay said: “Whilst my heart tells me to stand again, there being so much unfinished business across local regeneration and national issues which are important to me, my head knows this to be impossible at this time.\n\n“It would be difficult to withstand the rigours of an all-out election campaign, a campaign that I’d always wish to lead from the front. Thereafter, upon being re-elected it would be difficult for me to sustain 70 to 80 hour working weeks which were the norm prior to my illness.”\n\nMatt Hancock\n\nThe former health secretary announced in December that he would not be standing for re-election.\n\nAt the time he was an independent MP, after he had the whip suspended over his appearance on I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here.\n\nHowever, on Thursday the Conservatives restored the whip for Mr Hancock, meaning he will officially stand down as a Tory MP.\n\nMichael Gove\n\nMichael Gove, the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, announced on May 24 he would be stepping down as an MP.\n\nMr Gove said: “After nearly twenty years serving the wonderful people of Surrey Heath and over a decade in Cabinet across five government departments, I have today taken the decision to step down as a Member of Parliament.”\n\nIn a letter shared on Twitter, formerly X, Mr Gove, 56, cited the “toll” of serving in office and that it was a time for a “new generation to lead”.\n\nChris Heaton-Harris\n\nThe Northern Ireland Secretary said he would step down at the next general election. The MP, who has been a Cabinet minister since 2022, asked Rishi Sunak if he would be able to stay on in his position until the election.\n\nMr Heaton-Harris said it had been an “honour and a privilege to serve”, and thanked his constituents in Daventry.\n\nHe also thanked Mr Sunak and former prime ministers Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, saying he would continue to campaign for the Conservatives as the “only party that has and can deliver for the whole of the United Kingdom”.\n\nDame Andrea Leadsom\n\nA former business secretary and Tory leadership contender, Dame Andrea confirmed on May 24 that she would not be standing for re-election. The MP for South Northamptonshire, who has served her constituency since 2010, made the final two in the Tory leadership race in 2016 but subsequently quit the race amid a public outcry after appearing to suggest that being a mother made her better placed to become prime minister than Theresa May.\n\nSajid Javid\n\nThe MP for Bromsgrove since 2010, Mr Javid has served in six different Cabinet posts during the Tories’ time in power as culture secretary, business secretary, housing secretary, home secretary, chancellor and health secretary. He has remained on the back benches during Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak’s premierships.\n\nSir Charles Walker\n\nSir Charles, who sat as the chairman of the procedure committee between 2012 and 2019, emerged as one of the biggest lockdown sceptics in Parliament, carrying a milk bottle around Westminster to protest against restrictions. He was an arch-critic of Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, branding her government “an absolute disgrace” led by “a group of talentless people”.\n\nSir Graham Brady\n\nSir Graham, who has been the chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of backbenchers, confirmed earlier this year he will no longer represent Altrincham and Sale after winning the seat in 1997.\n\nKwasi Kwarteng\n\nMr Kwarteng, the former chancellor, announced on Feb 6 2024 he would stand down as an MP at the next general election.\n\nHe used to represent the constituency of Spelthorne, Surrey, and told his constituency association he would not stand at the next contest.\n\nHe wrote on X, formerly Twitter: “It has been an honour to serve the residents of Spelthorne since 2010, and I shall continue to do so for the remainder of my time in Parliament.”\n\nDehenna Davison\n\nMs Davison, 29, was elected as the first ever Tory MP for the ‘Red Wall’ seat of Bishop Aukland in its 134-year history at the 2019 general election. A minister at the Department for Levelling Up, she said on announcing her resignation she hadn’t had “anything like a normal life for a twenty-something”.\n\nSir Gary Streeter\n\nSir Gary is stepping down from Parliament after more than 30 years, having been the Tory MP for South West Devon since 1992.\n\nChloe Smith\n\nMs Smith, the MP for Norwich North since 2009, was one of Liz Truss’s most prominent backers, serving firstly as her work and pensions secretary and then as Rishi Sunak’s temporary science secretary during Michelle Donelan’s maternity leave.\n\nGeorge Eustice\n\nAn MP since 2010, Mr Eustice was Mr Johnson’s environment secretary between 2020 and 2022.\n\nRobin Walker\n\nA former education minister, Mr Walker is currently the chairman of the Commons education select committee.\n\nAlister Jack\n\nThe current Scottish Secretary, Mr Jack confirmed he would stand down at the next election but ruled out accepting a peerage in Boris Johnson’s resignation honours list despite being nominated by the prime minister.\n\nSir Robert Goodwill\n\nA former education, immigration and transport minister, Sir Robert is currently the chairman of the Commons environment, food and rural affairs select committee.\n\nSir Bill Cash\n\nSir Bill, the MP for Stone in Staffordshire and an arch-Eurosceptic, said it would be a “big wrench” to leave Parliament. Aged 83, he is the oldest member of the Commons.\n\nLucy Allan\n\nMs Allan, the MP for Telford in Shropshire since 2015, announced her intention to quit with a broadside at the Government, writing: “Today’s Conservative Party is just not interested in seats like Telford anymore.”\n\nSteve Brine\n\nMr Brine, who broke lobbying rules in a WhatsApp exchange revealed by The Telegraph’s Lockdown Files investigation, said it was time for him to consider a “new chapter” in his life.\n\nBen Wallace\n\nMr Wallace, who has served as Defence Secretary since July 2019, announced he would not fight the next election but ruled out leaving Parliament “prematurely”. He also said he would step down from his Cabinet role at the next reshuffle.\n\nAlok Sharma\n\nThe Tory former cabinet minister and Cop26 president, who led the United Nations climate change conference in Glasgow two years ago, said he would continue to champion “climate action” in Parliament for the remainder of his time as an MP.\n\nChris Grayling\n\nThe former transport secretary has been MP for Epsom and Ewell since 2001 and served in the Cameron and May administrations. He said he had been successfully treated for prostate cancer earlier this year, but the diagnosis had led him to decide it was “time for a change”.\n\nNickie Aiken\n\nNickie Aiken, the deputy chairman of the Conservative Party, announced she would stand down at the next general election on Feb 7.\n\nMs Aiken is married to Alex Aiken, the Government’s executive director of communications. It also emerged on Feb 7 that Mr Aiken would leave his post to take a job at the United Arab Emirates’s foreign ministry.\n\nTracey Crouch\n\nMs Crouch is a former minister who chaired a review of English football. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2020 and completed treatment the following year.\n\nIn a letter confirming her departure, she wrote: “The reasons for not wishing to stand are entirely personal and positive. While everyone’s cancer journey is different, for me going through a diagnosis and coming out the other side of treatment has been a life-affirming experience.\n\n“It has been an opportunity to pause and reflect on my own personal priorities and based on that I truly believe it is time to seek a new professional challenge.”\n\nJo Churchill\n\nThe employment minister confirmed the day after the general election was called that she would stand down.\n\nMs Churchill, who represented Bury St Edmunds since the 2015 election, shared a letter she wrote to Rishi Sunak on April 26 in which she assured him of her “constant support” during the campaign and said she had decided not to contest the next national poll for “family reasons”.\n\nDame Eleanor Laing\n\nThe Commons deputy speaker tweeted that it was “time for me to move aside and give others the opportunities that I’ve been fortunate to have”.\n\nJames Grundy\n\nThe Red Wall MP who entered Parliament in 2019 announced that he would step down.\n\nHe said: “It is fair to say that the last few years have perhaps been the most challenging Parliament since the one that sat during the Second World War.\n\n“There has also been a saddening change in the political climate where increasingly politicians, their families and staff are seen as fair game for abuse, threats of violence or even death threats.\n\nHe added: “This is not healthy for our national politics and needs to change, and with that in mind I have decided not to seek re-election.”\n\nHuw Merriman\n\nThe Tory MP for Bexhill and Battle, who was first elected in 2015, has been rail minister since October 2022.\n\nSir Michael Ellis\n\nThe Tory MP for Northampton North, became the fifth Conservative to announce they are standing down at the next election the day after Mr Sunak announced it would take place on July 4.\n\nBob Stewart\n\nMr Stewart, who has represented the south-east London constituency of Beckenham, said he would leave Parliament in November 2023 after being convicted of a racially aggravated public order offence.\n\nThe conviction was quashed in February this year."
