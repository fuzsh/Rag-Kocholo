        "text": "Matt Hancock is a British Politician who is currently the MP for West Suffolk in the United Kingdom. Matt joined the jungle on Day 4 along with Seann Walsh as their first trial was the Beastly Burrows in which they got a total of 6 stars. Matt has done a total of 7 trials, with him getting a total of 59/76 possible stars, giving him a percentage of 78% of the stars in his trials. Most of Matt's trials were done consecutively, as he did 6 trials in a row before the people would vote in someone else for the Angel of Agony trial on the 15th November as he would state in his trial that he was \"starting to like them\", likely causing the change in votes. Since the consecutive voting in, Matt has done 1 trial since which was compulsory as all Celebrities had to take part.\n\nBackground[]\n\nMatthew John David Hancock (born 2 October 1978) is a British politician and economist who has been Member of Parliament (MP) for West Suffolk since 2010.
