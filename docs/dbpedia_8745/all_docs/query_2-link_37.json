        "text": "Very good decision by NHS England to mandate the adoption of the national Federated Data Platform (FDP) across all trusts within the next two years. The NHS has huge potential in its data assets, and they‚Äôve got to be managed effectively to deliver the best patient care, and for research. One of the big advantages the NHS has is that it‚Äôs a single-payer, unified system. We saw that in how it delivered the vaccine programme, for example. Unnecessary silos reduce the impact that modern use of data can have. Making the national platform mandatory (across England at least) is a big, positive step forward. NHS England's move to have trusts confirm their plans to adopt the FDP within the next two years shows they‚Äôre serious about using data to its fullest potential to save lives. The FDP is a powerful tool that brings together information from different clinical and HR systems, helping the NHS make better decisions and improve patient care through advanced analysis. It‚Äôs just a start and I hope this wise decision shows the direction of travel. Patients want the NHS to use their data more effectively. They want their healthcare providers to have access to accurate, up-to-date information that can simplify care and reduce waiting times. The FDP‚Äôs products, like referral to treatment validation, inpatient and outpatient care coordination, and discharge planning, are designed to meet these needs. By improving data accuracy and operational efficiency, we can make things easier for both patients and healthcare professionals. All NHS trusts should lean into this agenda. It‚Äôs necessary to make the NHS fit for the huge challenges it faces. I am pleased that Emily Lawson has made it very clear that decisive action is needed. Each trust needs to appoint a dedicated lead for FDP adoption to ensure accountability and leadership during this important transition. This isn‚Äôt just a technical improvement, it‚Äôs a major improvement for the whole NHS and benefiting the people it serves. https://lnkd.in/eBBhv4y2\n\nI wasn‚Äôt identified as being dyslexic until I was 18. Like thousands of other neurodivergent individuals, I struggled through school, not understanding why certain parts were more challenging for me than for my neurotypical classmates. I was one of the lucky ones; my strength in maths helped me get through school and into university, where I was eventually identified as dyslexic. Unfortunately, many neurodivergent people aren‚Äôt as fortunate, with a disproportionate number ending up in the criminal justice system. You can help change this by making your voice heard! üó£Ô∏èWrite or email your local MP to reintroduce the Neurodivergent Conditions (Screening and Teacher Training) Bill in Parliament. üìúThis bill, which I introduced earlier this year, ensures that all children in Primary Schools are screened for neurodivergent conditions. Now that I have stood down as an MP, it‚Äôs crucial for a new MP to take up this cause and reintroduce the bill. Share why this is personally important to you and encourage your MP to take action. #Neurodiversity #Identification\n\nYesterday, the National Audit Office (NAO) released a report showing that without better prevention and use of technology, the NHS can't function properly. This is a big wake-up call - we must take prevention policies seriously to tackle the rising demand of an ageing population. As societies get older they inevitably have more demands for healthcare. So this can‚Äôt be ducked. The NAO is shorter on solutions. A good starting point would be - Tackle smoking and sugar: the two biggest causes of preventable illness. - ‚Å†Use technology to help people stay healthy in the first place, and monitor better in sickness and in health. These changes are as imperative now as they were when I set them out as Health Secretary before the pandemic. The NAO is right to raise the alarm. Most smart people in the NHS know this. The Government needs to listen and act. #Healthcare #Prevention #Technology #AI #NHS #Sustainability #NAOReport https://lnkd.in/epKavWx9\n\nAccording to a London School of Economics report published last November, 15% of children with specific learning difficulties are registered in the most affluent decile and 6% are registered in the most deprived. This cannot reflect reality. The only explanation is an unjust allocation of early identification tools within the system. There isn‚Äôt enough focus on early identification, there isn‚Äôt enough funding, and crucially, there is also an inequality in the early identification that leads to diagnosis and the development of Education , Health and Care plans (EHCPs). There is a deep social injustice in this country, and we must address this. Therefore, it‚Äôs important we continue to keep the pressure up on our Members of Parliament to ensure they listen to the concerns of the neurodivergent community. ‚úçÔ∏è One of the ways you can help is by sending a letter/email to your local MP to explain why it is personally important to you that they re-introduce the Neurodivergent Conditions (Screening and Teacher Training) Bill. This bill seeks to introduce neurodivergent screening in all primary schools to ensure no child starts secondary education not knowing if they are neurodivergent. Incredibly, one in five (18%) children still leave school not knowing that they have dyslexia. I was one of those ‚Äì only discovering I was dyslexic once I got to university. My identification was a lightbulb moment. üí° It changed my life and gave me the opportunity to relearn how to read and write. I was one of the lucky ones but sadly, too many are let down by our education system. Many others and I in the neurodivergent community want to change this.

Currently, waiting lists for diagnosis are far too long. It's crucial that we explore innovative solutions to tackle these issues effectively. üí° At the Accessible Learning Foundation (ALF), we have spoken to many up-and-coming AI companies that are making incredible progress in developing AI models that can hugely benefit the neurodivergent community. These advancements range from simplifying support for children learning to read and write to diagnosing neurodivergent conditions and drafting EHCPs almost instantaneously. I understand that many people might feel apprehensive about the rise of AI. But this technology holds incredible potential to assist thousands of neurodivergent individuals annually and it‚Äôs already making a big difference right now: üéì In schools, AI tools can turn text into speech for dyslexic students or use gamified methods to engage students with ADHD. These tools not only improve learning but also help educators by acting as virtual teaching assistants. üìñ üíº At work, AI helps neurodivergent professionals with productivity and communication. AI task management software keeps things organised, while AI chatbots help navigate social interactions and non-verbal cues. Plus, AI can adjust lighting and sound to fit sensory preferences, making workplaces more inclusive. Of course, we must still ensure AI is regulated to guarantee the safety of its users and that bias does not exist that might discriminate against neurodivergent people. However, it‚Äôs important to be open-minded to its potential to support neurodivergent people, from better diagnostics to hyper-personalised learning and inclusive work environments. It‚Äôs exciting to see how these technologies are developing to help neurodivergent individuals thrive. #AI #Neurodivergence #Inclusion\n\nWith the exponential growth of AI and emerging technologies, the job market is undergoing a significant transformation. As AI takes over mundane and repetitive tasks, humans can focus on roles that require creativity, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills. This shift opens up new opportunities, particularly for neurodivergent individuals whose unique talents will be increasingly valuable in areas that are challenging for computers to master. For instance, while AI can handle data entry and basic customer service efficiently, it struggles with roles requiring high levels of creativity, strategic thinking, and complex human interaction. There are many positions which demand creativity and nuanced understanding, that are less likely to be automated. Furthermore, new job roles are emerging, such as AI content editors, prompt engineers, and AI ethics specialists, which require a mix of technical knowledge and human insight. This trend shows a future where the unique talents of neurodivergent individuals, who often excel in creative and analytical tasks, will be in higher demand. Therefore, it‚Äôs no surprise to see so many large organisations, like GCHQ and Deloitte, already making a conscious effort to recruit more neurodivergent people.

I don‚Äôt think the exponential power of AI has really hit home yet. If we truly want to harness the potential power of emerging and growing technologies, we need serious commitment. This is not just about keeping up with the latest trends; we‚Äôve seen the power of the data revolution over the past couple of decades, and there is much more to come. As technology is adopted - by Government, businesses, and all of us in our everyday lives, the speed of change we are living through is the slowest we will see. One of the things the last gov't did right was support this change. Through legislation in Parliament, and openness to investment, the UK is firmly established as one of the centres of AI. So long as the new gov't keeps driving this agenda - starting today in the King‚Äôs Speech - we can stay at the forefront. Many places are snapping at our heels. Paris is a growing tech hub; the Gulf countries are investing hugely. But there is reason to be optimistic. Workday has unveiled figures showing that AI could provide a ¬£119 billion productivity boost for the UK. Their data shows that on average, individual business leaders could save 1,117 hours through the use of AI if it were used to its full potential. That's equivalent to 140 working days annually. These figures are estimates, but they make the point. And as for AI taking jobs, the first to go have been mundane and repetitive tasks. This shift will free people up to focus on more meaningful and engaging work, which not only boosts productivity but also improves job satisfaction and innovation. In the area I know best - healthcare - AI has the potential to transform service delivery in the NHS and improve healthcare for everyone who uses it. There are some lights of hope. NHS Humber Health Partnership deserves praise for its Flow initiative, which includes measures designed to streamline every stage of a patient‚Äôs progress from emergency department to discharge. AI software will be used to prepare X-ray reports and read blood test results, ensuring doctors can spend more of their precious time providing ‚Äúhands-on‚Äù patient care. The Tony Blair Institute for Global Change makes a compelling case for gov't to reimagine the state by leveraging the opportunities that tech and AI offer to revolutionise society. This approach provides the gov't with the tools needed to achieve more with fewer resources, improve public services, and allocate funds to other important areas. As we again look ahead to the State Opening of Parliament, I truly hope the new gov't shows seriousness of purpose about making tech and AI a priority. You don‚Äôt need to look far to witness how immense the potential benefits are, from boosting productivity and innovation to transforming public services. The age of AI and advanced tech is here and the UK must embrace it."
