        "text": "In general, a conversation about the top watch producing countries centers around two nations: Switzerland and Japan, with Japan often occupying the more affordable end of the spectrum and Switzerland more commonly associated with luxury watches and high watchmaking. Of course, this is an over generalization of the highest degree, as Japan is home to some of the finest purveyors of high watchmaking and there are indeed great deals to be found from Switzerland.\n\nHowever, the real tragedy here is the omission of the often overlooked superpower in watchmaking that is Germany. Home to dozens of brands, including some of the best in the business according to a variety of metrics, Germany is an excellent country for watchmaking.\n\nIn this article, we’ll be taking a look at some of Germany’s better known watch brands to provide an overview of names you should know if you’re new to German watches. In each synopsis, We'll begin with a bit of history, share a few of the brands' major accomplishments or best-loved models, and say a bit about what they’re up to these days, other than eating bratwurst and watching Fußball, of course.\n\nTo bring order to this list, we'll attempt to arrange the brands by where they sit in the retail price hierarchy — starting with more affordable brands and working our way up in a very general way, knowing that many outliers in price exist within almost all of these brands. Generally, If it’s towards the end of this list, it’s going to be a bit pricey. That should help to prevent the uninitiated from trotting off into Google to buy a Lange 1 without realizing that'll run them $50k.\n\nWempe\n\nHamburg-based Wempe, primarily one of the world’s top watch retailers but also a manufacturer of timepieces branded under its own name, was founded in 1878 by Gerhard Diedrich “Golden Gerd” Wempe. Like so many other German companies, the family-owned firm was conscripted into service during World War II as a producer of military equipment — specifically large wrist timekeepers for pilots during World War II. By the war’s end in 1945, however, Hamburg was in ruins and Wempe, like so many of its brethren, was forced to rebuild. Fortunately, the next two generations of the Wempe family would lead the firm to lasting success. In 2005, Wempe bought the derelict Glashütte Observatory, transforming it into its own watchmaking center. One year later came the Chronometerwerke line, which used movements made and chronometer-tested at the facility. The line continues as a mainstay of Wempe’s watch collection, particularly the Chronometerwerke Automatic Aviator Watch, a retro-designed pilots’ watch based on those produced during the wartime era. More recently, Wempe introduced its sport-luxury Ironwalker family, which takes its name and some visual cues from the nickname for the construction workers that built New York’s skyscrapers in the early 20th century — like the one that today houses Wempe’s midtown Manhattan showroom.\n\nAlexander Shorokhoff\n\nThe name of the founder is Russian but the watches proudly sport “Made in Germany” on their dials. Moscow-born independent watchmaker Alexander Shorokhoff founded his eponymous watch brand in Bavaria in 2003, focusing on offbeat, avant-garde, and usually highly limited timepieces that take inspiration from Russian authors and painters: Fyodor Dostoevsky, Leo Tolstoy, Peter Tchaikovsky, and Wassily Kandinsky are among the historical luminaries who have provided inspiration for Shorokhoff’s distinctively creative timepieces. Some of them, like 2019’s “Levels,” merge the artistic aesthetic with bold horological experimentation. Its multi-level dial, which displays home time and local time on different planes, achieves its 3D dual time zone displays with the use of two separate self-winding ETA 2671 movements, one for each time zone. Occasionally, Shorokhoff pays tribute to artistic pioneers outside his native land, as with Los Craneos, another dual-time watch, this one displaying the times on two Frida Kahlo-style skulls, the spark for which came from Shorokhoff’s trip to Mexico.\n\nHanhart\n\nFounded in 1882, Hanhart is based in Schwenningen, Germany’s traditional center of clockmaking. The company originally specialized in making hand-held stopwatches for track-and-field runner and other athletes, but as the specter of war loomed over the country in the 1930s, the family firm’s second-generation leader, Wilhelm “Willy” Hanhart, took it into the more lucrative and field of making chronograph wristwatches for military pilots. Among Hanhart’s most storied watches from that era were the monopusher Calibre 40 models, launched in 1938, and a series of two-pusher chronographs the following year, such as the Calibre 41 and the Tachy Tele (named for its dial’s tachymeter and telemeter scales). The latter two timepieces introduced several new and practical elements for pilots that remain brand hallmarks to this day: a bright red return-to-zero pusher that would be less likely to be inadvertently pressed while timing an interval during a flight, and a red marker at 12 o’clock on the rotatable bezel, which enabled the wearer to record times longer than the 30 minutes indicated on the chronograph counter. These red details live on in today’s flagship Pioneer collection, which takes the design of those of vintage models into the modern era — most faithfully with The Pioneer MKII, which traces its look all the way back to those 1939 models, right down to the retro coin-edge bezels and the riveted, contrast-stitched calfskin strap.\n\nLeica\n\nGermany’s Leica, one of the world’s most respected camera makers in the world, entered the crowded field of watchmaking in 2018 and it did so with the same devotion to technical and design excellence that it has brought to the field of photography since 1986. Its first two Leica timepieces — the three-hand L1 and GMT-equipped L2 — were designed in collaboration with renowned German product designer Achim Heine, a longtime collaborator on Leica products. Among the subtle but recognizable Leica camera elements on both models are the fluting of the crown and the curved shape of the crystal in the style of a camera lens and the ruby set on the crown, which stands in for the famous red dot of the Leica logo. The camera-shutter-button-inspired crown is designed to stop the movement by being pushed in rather than pulled out. Perhaps most notably, Leica actually makes the watches in Germany rather than licensing their manufacture out to somewhere in Asia or even Switzerland. (Leica has said that the “Made in Germany” designation, like the one on its cameras, was extremely important; the manually wound movements, for example, are made in partnership with Lehmann Präzision GmbH in Germany’s Black Forest.) The collection remains rather small and niche in its appeal but has already gained much acclaim from reviewers.\n\nArchimede\n\nWhile Archimede has only been making watches commercially since 2003, the family-owned firm that produces them traces its origins all the way back to 1924, when founder Karl Ickler established his watch case factory in Pforrzheim, Germany, a city known worldwide for its jewelry. What that means in practice is that Archimede is one of the few watch companies that can claim that all its cases are designed, prototyped, constructed and finished entirely in house. These Ickler cases, which are all machined from a single block of stainless steel, are found across the entire Archimede range (they’re also provided, mostly anonymously, to other German watchmakers), which offers divers’ models in the SportTeuscher collection, modern versions of naval officers’ watches in the DeckWatch family, classically elegant gents’ pieces called Klassik, and perhaps most prominently the Pilot collection, which takes cues from the styling of aviators’ watches made in Germany during the 1930s and ‘40s, with inverted triangles at 12 o’clock, bulky grooved crowns, and riveted leather straps.\n\nKudoke\n\nIndependent watchmaker Stefan Kudoke (pronounced koo DOH kah), received his master craftsman in watchmaking certificate with honors at age 22 and honed his skills working for German and Swiss maisons including Glashutte Original, Breguet, Blancpain, and Omega. Since 2008, Kudoke has been making his own watches in his native Germany, several of which have earned awards in the prestigious Geneva Grand Prix (GPHG). His stock-in-trade is skeletonizing and engraving existing movements to make them something unique and putting them on display in uniquely eye-catching timepieces, for which he makes his own dials and hands. Kudoke’s standout pieces include the Kudoke Oktopus Tourbillon, a collaboration with Austrian watchmaker Richard Habring. In which the openworked movement bridges, plates, and even the hands have been reworked to resemble the tentacles of an octopus. More recently, Kudoke introduced the Grüner Wald Sonderedition (“Green Forest Special Edition,” in English), a variation on his Kudoke 2 model with a textured dark green dial, more notable, the first in-house Kudoke movement."
