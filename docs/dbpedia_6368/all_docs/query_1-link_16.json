        "text": "The Max streaming service is going to be the one-stop destination for moviegoers looking to escape the summer heat in July 2024. What Max has above other streamers this month is the premiere of two notable films, the first being Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures’ blockbuster hit Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, which arrives on July 4, 2024. Directed by Adam Wingard, who previously helmed Godzilla vs. Kong, this latest installment in the MonsterVerse franchise is one giant homage to the high thrills and wild imagination of the Showa Era (1954–1975). Toho’s Godzilla franchise has been running strong for 70 years now in Japan, and the Showa films are often recognized as being the most cartoonish with their old-school aesthetics. Still, director Adam Wingard manages to pay an honest tribute with his own form of colorful action in a hyper-stylized Kaiju extravaganza.\n\nIn Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, the two titular titans must put their past rivalry aside to join forces and take on the Skar King, a towering orangutan-like kaiju who is looking to escape from Hollow Earth and conquer the surface world with his legion of Great Apes. The Skar King’s secret weapon is Shimo, an ancient reptilian titan with the power to bring forth a new ice age using her frost breath. Along the way, fans are introduced to some fresh and familiar faces, including Suko, a juvenile giant ape who can be seen as “mini Kong.” Audiences were overtaken by Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire earlier this year, carrying its global box office to $570 million. This makes it not just the highest-grossing MonsterVerse film but also the highest-grossing Godzilla film ever.\n\nWhile Adam Wingard won’t be directing the next MonsterVerse sequel set to hit theaters in 2027, the Max streaming debut of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire should still be celebrated by fans. Moving on to the next notable 2024 movie coming to Max this July, subscribers will want to look out for A24’s Loves Lies Bleeding. Premiering on July 19, 2024, Love Lies Bleeding comes from writer-director Rose Glass (Saint Maud) and stars the great Kristen Stewart (Spencer) and Katy O’Brian, who viewers might recognize from her roles in The Mandalorian and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Set in 1989 New Mexico, this neo-noir thriller follows reclusive gym manager Lou Langston (Stewart) as she falls in love with Jaqueline “Jackie” Cleaver (O’Brian), an aspiring bodybuilder who’s just drifted into town. Their unrelenting romance soon forces Lou to face the demons hidden in her family’s secret criminal empire.\n\nPraised for its dark sense of humor and genre-bending direction, Love Lies Bleeding is only the latest A24 film to finally reach the Max streaming platform this year, coming after The Iron Claw‘s addition in May 2024 and Problemista in June 2024. But what of Max Originals coming in July 2024? The most hilarious Max Original premiere this month will be on July 18, 2024 with Kite Man: Hell Yeah!, a spin-off series of the beloved Harley Quinn animated DC show. Comedian Matt Oberg returns to voice Charles Brown/Kite Man as he and his new girlfriend, Lisa Snart / Golden Glider (Stephanie Hsu), moonlight as criminals to support their purchase of a local dive bar named Noonan’s in Gotham City. Soon enough, Kite Man finds a new purpose in life as he learns how to run an establishment for the most dangerous rogues outside of Arkham Asylum.\n\nKite Man: Hell Yeah! will feature Harley Quinn (Kaley Cuoco) and the titular villain’s ex-fiancé Poison Ivy (Lake Bell) in guest roles only. Meanwhile, fans can expect a wide variety of DC villains to have a larger presence in this Max Original Series, like Bane (James Adomian), Darkseid (Keith David), and Lex Luthor (voiced by the late Lance Reddick). Regarding other Max and HBO Originals, July 2024 is all about documentaries. People should have Teen Torture Inc. on their radars, a Max Original Documentary Series that follows a recurring band of young survivors and whistleblowers (including rap star Bhad Bhabie) as they expose America’s “troubled teen” industry (TTI). For those unaware, many recognizable figures, such as Paris Hilton, have recently taken to legislators to put a stop to how this unregulated industry actually abuses vulnerable youths while gaining millions of dollars. This new docuseries could change the tide in their efforts.\n\nTwo other fascinating titles coming to Max in July 2024 are Faye, an HBO Original Documentary chronicling the life and esteemed career of Hollywood legend/Oscar-winning actress Faye Dunaway, and The Commandant’s Shadow. The latter is a documentary that centers on Hans Jürgen Höss, the 87-year-old son of Rudolf Höss, coming to terms with his father’s terrible legacy in the modern day as Rudolf was the camp commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp in Nazi Germany. The life of the Höss family during the Nazi’s reign over Europe in WWII was recently depicted in Jonathan Glazer‘s Oscar-winning film The Zone of Interest, which is also streaming on Max.\n\nTo wrap things up, Max subscribers can now stream tons of exciting films that were added at the beginning of July 2024. This mighty list includes the first 7 films in the Saw franchise, the perfect way to prepare for the upcoming 11th entry, Saw XI. Speaking of sequels, those looking forward to watching Twisters, starring Glen Powell, Daisy Edgar-Jones, and Anthony Ramos, in theaters this month can now enjoy the original Twister (1996) on Max. Additionally, the streamer just received the two best M. Night Shyamalan movies, The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable — great timing for the upcoming release of his new concert thriller, Trap. Robert Rodriguez’s entire Spy Kids series is prime for binging as well. To top it all off, one can never go wrong with rewatching modern classics like David Fincher’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Greta Gerwig’s Lady Bird, and Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain.\n\nDiscover more on our monthly recs below, then check out the list of everything coming to HBO and Max in July 2024.
