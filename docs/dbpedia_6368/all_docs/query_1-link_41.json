        "text": "With Ryan Goslingâs smoldering turn as a black ops mercenary Court Gentry in The Gray Man, SPYSCAPE thought it was time to catch up on some of our favorite blockbusters and slow-burn thrillers involving the CIA.\n\nHere are 25 top spy movies you wonât want to miss.\n\nâ\n\nZero Dark Thirty (2012)Â\n\nMaya (Jessica Chastain) is a CIA analyst tasked with finding Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 attacks. Sheâs stationed at the US Embassy in Pakistan, which enables her to attend an interrogation with a man suspected of having links to the hijackers. Chastain deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Actress. (Prime Video, (YouTube, Google Play, Apple TV, Netflix in some countries)Â\n\nÂ\n\nSyriana (2005) â\n\nVeteran CIA agent Bob Barnes (George Clooney) uncovers an assassination plot as various storylines unfold amid the backdrop of the oil industry. Matt Damon also stars. âIt shows how espionage is an integral component of geopolitical systems with myriad micro and macro ripple effects,â said SPYEX Consultant Lindsay Moran, an ex-CIA operations officer.
