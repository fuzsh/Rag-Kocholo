        "text": "Food supplements are concentrated sources of nutrients (i.e. mineral A naturally occurring inorganic element (e.g. calcium, iron) that is needed in the diet for normal growth, development and health. and vitamins) or other substances with a nutritional or physiological effect that are marketed in “ dose The total amount of a substance (e.g. a chemical or nutrient) given to, consumed or absorbed by an individual organism, population or ecosystem.” form (e.g. pills, tablets, capsules, liquids in measured doses). A wide range of nutrients and other ingredients might be present in food supplements, including, but not limited to, vitamins, minerals, amino acids, essential fatty acids, fibre and various plants and herbal extracts.\n\nIn the EU, food supplements are regulated as foods. Harmonised legislation regulates the vitamins and minerals, and the substances used as their sources, which can be used in the manufacturing of food supplements. For ingredients other than vitamins and minerals, the European Commission has established harmonised rules to protect consumers against potential health risks and maintains a list of substances which are known or suspected to have adverse effects on health and the use of which is therefore controlled.\n\nLatest\n\nFebruary 2024 – our nutrition experts are updating EFSA’s Guidance on the scientific principles and data required to assess the safety and relative bioavailability A term to describe how much of a substance gets into the blood through a variety of routes, including the diet. It may refer to vitamins, additives, pesticides or medicines. of new substances proposed as sources of micronutrients for use in food supplements, fortified foods and foods for specific groups (for infants and young children, for medical purposes, and total diet replacements for weight control).\n\nA draft of the updated Guidance is now available for feedback - if you are a nutrition expert, scientist or have scientific information to share, we want to hear from you during our public consultation!\n\nGuidance documents are used by applicants when submitting scientific information in applications for market authorisation and by risk assessors during the evaluation process. We regularly update these documents to take account of the latest science and recent experience in the evaluation of applications. In addition, the European Commission asked EFSA to cover two new areas in the guidance document:\n\nnew forms of micronutrients (e.g. micronutrient metabolites, new molecules having vitamin activity), many of which are novel foods; and\n\nquantification of the relative bioavailability of the micronutrient from the new source to derive of a conversion factor for labelling purposes.\n\nSend us your feedback by 14 April!\n\nPublic consultation: Draft guidance on scientific principles and data requirements for the safety and relative bioavailability assessment of substances proposed as new micronutrient sources\n\nEFSA's role\n\nBetween 2005 and 2009, EFSA carried out a comprehensive assessment of substances that are permitted to be used as sources of vitamins and minerals in food supplements in the EU. The assessment included both the evaluation of the safety of a nutrient source at the intake levels suggested by the applicant, and the bioavailability of the nutrient from the source i.e. the effectiveness with which the mineral or vitamin is released into the body.\n\nCompanies wishing to market a nutrient source not included in the permitted list have to submit an application to the European Commission. Under Directive 2002/46/EC, EFSA then prepares a scientific opinion Opinions include risk assessments on general scientific issues, evaluations of an application for the authorisation of a product, substance or claim, or an evaluation of a risk assessment. to support the European Commission’s evaluation of the request. Based on EFSA’s work, the European Commission reviews and updates the list of vitamin or mineral substances that may be used in food supplements.\n\nIf a substance intended to be used in food supplements does not have a history of safe use in the EU before 1997, EFSA is requested to provide a scientific opinion on its safety according to Regulation (EC) No 2015/2283 on novel foods.\n\nMoreover, EFSA has performed a comprehensive evaluation of the possible adverse health effects of individual micronutrients at intakes exceeding the dietary requirements and, where possible, established tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for different population groups. ULs represent the highest level of chronic daily intake of a nutrient that is not likely to pose a risk of adverse health effects to humans. The ULs defined by EFSA and by the former Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) are used as a reference in EFSA’s evaluations of the safety of nutrient sources added to food supplements. Throughout this work EFSA provides support to the European Commission in establishing maximum limits for vitamins and minerals in food supplements and fortified foods.\n\nFor all substances added to foods, including food supplements, that are claimed to have an effect on the nutritional or health status of consumers, EFSA carries out an assessment in line with Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 on nutrition and health claims.\n\nUnder the circumstances described in Art. 8 of Regulation 1925/2006, i.e. “…where a substance other than vitamins or minerals … is added to foods … under conditions that would result in the ingestion of amounts of this substance greatly exceeding those reasonably expected … under normal conditions … and/or would otherwise represent a potential risk to consumers…”, EFSA may be requested by the European Commission to assess the available information to support a decision on the safety of the substance. Based on EFSA’s assessment the European Commission may decide to include the specific substance in a list of substances whose use in foods in the EU is prohibited, restricted or under scrutiny (see Annex III of Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006).\n\nEU framework\n\nAccording to the EU General Food Law Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, food supplements are considered as foodstuffs. Responsibility for the safety of these products lies with the food business operator placing the product on the market.\n\nThe reference EU legislation in the area of food supplements is Directive 2002/46/EC, which establishes harmonised lists of the vitamins and minerals substances used in the manufacture of food supplements and the labelling requirements for these products. EFSA provides scientific opinions to support the evaluations carried out by the European Commission.\n\nThe directive lays down the rules applicable only to the use of vitamins and minerals in the manufacture of food supplements. The use of substances other than vitamins or minerals in the manufacture of food supplements may be governed by national rules or may be subject to other specific EU legislation.\n\nThe latter is the case for:\n\nsubstances without a history of safe use in the EU before 1997, which are assessed under Regulation (EC) No 2015/2283 on novel food;\n\nsources of vitamins, minerals and additional substances proposed for use in the manufacture of food supplements that may also be assessed under Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 on fortification of foods or Regulation (EC) No 609/2013 on foods for specific groups;\n\nsubstances added to food supplements to perform certain technological functions, for example to colour, to sweeten or to preserve, that are assessed as food additives under Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.\n\nThe addition of nutrients or other substances to fortify a food does not fall within the definition of food supplement and it is addressed by Regulation (EC) 1925/2006.\n\nFinally, as with all the other food products, food supplements may contain additives (e.g. sweeteners, colours, coating agents). In the EU, only food additives that are specifically authorised for use in this food category according to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 can be added to food supplements."
