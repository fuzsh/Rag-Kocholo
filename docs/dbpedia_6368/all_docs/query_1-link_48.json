        "text": "The Quiller Memorandum, British-American spy film, released in 1966, that was especially noted for the deliberately paced but engrossing script by playwright Harold Pinter.\n\nQuiller (played by George Segal) is an American secret agent assigned to work with British MI6 chief Pol (Alec Guinness) in West Berlin. After two British agents are killed while investigating Phoenix, a neo-Nazi group, Quiller is tasked with finding the organization’s leader. He quickly becomes involved with numerous people of suspicious motives and backgrounds, including Inge (Senta Berger), a teacher at a school where a former Nazi war criminal committed suicide. Quiller is eventually kidnapped and tortured by Oktober (Max von Sydow), the leader of Phoenix. When Quiller refuses to talk, Oktober orders his execution. Quiller, however, escapes, and with Inge’s help, he discovers the location of Phoenix’s headquarters. They both go to the building, whereupon they are captured. Oktober informs Quiller that if he does not disclose secret information this time, both he and Inge will be killed. Quiller manages to outwit his opponent yet again, leading to his arrest. The film ends with Quiller suspecting that Inge is more than an ordinary schoolteacher.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia"
