        "text": "20 years after the conclusion of the original film trilogy, The Lord of the Rings returned to the zeitgeist with a beautifully shot half-billion-dollar season of television, and the promise of new movies (like The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim and a new Amazon reboot) on the way. The Lord of the Rings is one of the most beloved and accomplished trilogies in Hollywood history, and thanks to the extraordinary craftsmanship of its filmmakers, the trio has retained its ability to entertain and inspire awe two decades later.\n\nIf you enjoyed season one of the Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, you can look forward to season two coming August 29th. Check out the trailer below.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nFor those looking to watch or re-watch the films, we've compiled this guide on where you can watch all of the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies online right now.\n\nFor a special, one-time chance to re-watch the original Lord of the Rings trilogy in all its glory, it has been announced that they will be playing in theaters once again starting with The Fellowship of the Ring on June 8th, The Two Towers on June 9th, and then The Return of the King on June 10th.

Thankfully, all of the movies are available to stream on Max, while the TV series can only be streamed on Amazon. Each of the six films can also be rented or purchased on Amazon or YouTube.\n\nHere's our full breakdown of how to watch The Lord of the Rings movies online in 2024:\n\nLord of The Rings Blu-Ray Sets\n\nLooking to add a Lord of the Rings Blu-ray set to your collection? Your best options are to either by the extended edition trilogies separately, or grab the standard collection of all 6 movies. Below are some of the best options avaialable right now:\n\nWhat's the Best Order to Watch the Lord of the Rings Movies?\n\nWatching the Lord of the Rings movies is a fairly straightforward endeavour.

The companies made the deal to create future films in coordination with Embracer Group, which acquired Middle-earth Enterprises (along with the film and game rights to LotR and The Hobbit) in 2022.\n\nThere was no announcement about potential release dates for the films, though given their development was just announced, future Lord of the Rings movies are certainly years out.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nIn the interim, Warner Bros. will release a feature-length LotR anime called The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim on December 13th, 2024. War of the Rohirrim follows King of Rohan Helm Hammerhand and the creation of Helm’s Deep 200 years before The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings.\n\nProduction on The Rings of Power: Season 2 is wrapping up and will be available on Amazon Prime on August 29th, 2024.
