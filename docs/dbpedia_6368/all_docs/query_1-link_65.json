Max, a precision-trained military dog, serves on the frontlines in Afghanistan alongside his handler, U.S. Marine Kyle Wincott. But when things go terribly wrong on maneuvers, Kyle is mortally wounded and Max, traumatized by the loss of his best friend, is unable to remain in service. Shipped stateside, the only human he seems willing to connect with is Kyle's teenage brother, Justin. Justin's growing trust in Max helps the four-legged veteran revert back to his heroic self, and as the pair race against time to unravel the mystery behind Kyle's death, they find more excitement—and danger—than they bargained for. But they each might also find an unlikely new best friend...in each other.",

        "text": "There's a little more violence than your usual early teen flick but it still stays within the realm of family-friendly film.\n\nSeptember 13, 2021\n\nFeels like a direct-to-DVD movie that somehow escaped the pound and made it's way to theatres.\n\nFebruary 3, 2021\n\nFilled with emotion, the joys of summer, the excitement, and thrill of adventure, there's nothing quite like the story of a boy and his dog.\n\nDecember 8, 2019\n\nMax is deceptively simple and entirely effective. Heart-melting and humorous, this moving film has more to offer than an adorable dog.\n\nMay 4, 2019\n\nYakin may let Max may meander a little, thematically, but any filmmaker who takes the time to craft a family film (only a smattering of language and \"peril\") wedgied in the same week as an R-rated movie about a degenerate stuffed bear is OK in my book.\n\nApril 17, 2019\n\nSuckers for animal movies will forgive the movie's predictability, but even the jaded may find that its script and musical cues reveal an occasionally thoughtful film wrapped in multiplex sheep's clothing.\n\nAugust 28, 2018\n\n\"Max\" is a family film that will capture your heart, pull on those heart-strings quite a bit, and deliver a message for every age.\n\nAugust 21, 2018\n\nMax is a doggy tale of canine heroism that comes with such a generous side-order of good ol' American, flag-waving patriotism that its potential appeal to British audiences will surely be limited.\n\nOctober 30, 2017"
