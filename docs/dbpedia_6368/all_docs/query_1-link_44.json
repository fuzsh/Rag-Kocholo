        "text": "2010 will be remembered as the year Lomography ensured that the future would remain analogue once and for all! We took the Cologne Photokina by storm yet again, spreading analogue love and announcing our 10 Prophecies for the Analogue Future!\n\nThe revolutionary Spinner 360Â° was launched and was quickly awarded the European Consumers Choice Award! We then unleashed the time-travelling Sprocket Rocket in October, the first analogue camera dedicated entirely to sprockets!\n\nWe also set about ensuring that the future was on film by producing more of our own! We released a whole range of 120 and 35mm format films including special redscale and X-Pro films.\n\nIn celebration of the LOMO LC-A that started the Lomographic movement, two limited editions were created: the LC-A+ White & the LC-A+ Gold. Also in this year, 10 groups of film-fanatics from around the world teamed up to join the great LC-A Race â a race from the four corners of the globe back to Lomography headquarters in Vienna, armed only with a GPS, a notebook and an LC-A+ camera!\n\nIn 2011, the people of Hong Kong celebrated everything analogue with the incredible Lomography Times Square Exhibition. Over 100,000 people turned up to discover and explore an enormous LomoWorldMap made up of thousands of Lomographic pictures and a collection of four giant, interactive cameras including the Sprocket Rocket, Diana F+, Fisheye No.2 and a Lubitel 166+. It was at this exhibition that we announced the launch of the brand-new Hong Kong City Guide and a special edition White Sprocket Rocket to celebrate the event!\n\nIn May, we unleashed the worldâs widest compact camera, the Lomo LC-Wide; the latest innovation in the LOMO legacy. Featuring a newly developed 17mm Minigon 1 Ultra-Wide-Angle lens, soon Lomographers were head-over-heels in love with our latest member of the LC-A family.\n\nFollowing in June was the lovable La Sardina camera which featured a brand-new Lomographic flash, Fritz the Blitz. With a wide-angle lens and shooting easy-to-find 35mm film, the La Sardina attracted a whole bunch of newcomers to Lomographic fun.\n\nIn July, we spread the analogue love further with the launch of the limited edition LC-A+ Russia Day. We also made a big step in securing the future of film with the release of our brand-new Earl Grey and Lady Grey B&W films.\n\nIn November, we launched one of the most exciting innovations of the year â the worldâs first Lomographic movie camera â the LomoKino â adding a whole new dimension to analogue photography.\n\n2012 was a hugely exciting year for all things Lomography. We launched a whole host of exciting cameras and started a big celebration for our 20th anniversary.\n\nTo start with, we announced that Lomography was re-introducing 110 film to the world! This film format had been out of production since 2009 and it was a pleasure to bring it back in style with the launches of Orca B&W 110 film and Tiger CN 110. We then followed this up by producing our very first 110 format cameras, the Fisheye Baby 110 and Diana Baby 110 (you can find out more about them on our dedicated 110 photography site).\n\nIn September, we demonstrated our ever-inquisitive nature by producing a huge survey about how the worlds of analogue and digital are involved in Lomographersâ lives. The survey was answered by over 5000 people from 82 countries and produced some very interesting results. You can view the data as an infographic on our Analogue vs Digital site.\n\nWe left what many would say was the biggest and best news of the year until October. It was in this month that we announced the launch of the Belair X 6-12, the worldâs first medium format 6Ã12 auto-exposure camera.\n\nAnd if all this wasnât quite enough, it also happened to be the year when we reached the ripe old age of 20! Thatâs right, Lomography started all the way back in 1992 â we celebrated our anniversary by taking a look back at some of our favorite memories on our 20th Anniversary Site.\n\n2013 started with a big bang. By the end of January, we had already launched two products. Firstly, we began our first ever Kickstarter campaign with the Lomography Smartphone Film Scanner, which offers an easy way for you to digitize analogue photos.\n\nThen, within only a few weeks, we unveiled LomoChrome Purple Film. Available in both 35mm and 120 formats, with this film you can transform green tones into bright purples; it gives a similar look to the legendary Kodak Aerochrome film and was a sure-fire hit with the entire Lomographic community.\n\nFast-forward to April and we celebrated the first ever Film Photography Day. Film enthusiasts from all over the world came together on April 12th to party, shoot, meet and generally celebrate film photography in all its forms.\n\nIn summer, we had two further launches to enjoy. First came the Konstruktor, the worldâs first 35mm do-it-yourself SLR camera.\n\nThen in July we had another Kickstarter campaign, this time to reinvent the legendary Petzval Lens. The Lomography New Petzval Lens gives the classic look of old Petzval lenses but allows you to now get this on modern day Canon EF and Nikon F cameras (and other cameras using adapter mounts). The Kickstarter campaign was a tremendous success and reached its funding goal in less than 24 hours.\n\nAs if that wasnât enough new products for one year, in October the Experimental Lens Kit launched, which works with all Micro 4/3 digital cameras and gives photographers the opportunity to shoot real optical multiple exposures and color-splash photos with three different lenses.\n\nIn the first half of 2014, three new instant cameras were launched. The LC-A+ Instant Camera and Belair X 6-12 Instant Camera turned the iconic LC-A+ and Belair X 6-12 into instant snap-shooters. Then in May came the LomoâInstant, Lomographyâs first dedicated instant camera and the worldâs most creative instant camera (01)! It was our 3rd consecutive successful Kickstarter campaign and made Lomography the first company to ever have 2 projects raise over $1 million in the Product Design category of Kickstarter.\n\nDuring the year, we also launched the New Russar+ Lens (L36/M Mount), which expands the Lomography Art Lens family (02). The New Russar+ is a rebirth of the legendary 1958 Russar MR-2, which was the mother of all modern super wide-angle lenses. With the New Russar+, you can shoot sharp wide-angle photos bursting with wonderful character. Itâs perfect for capturing landscapes, architectural shots, portraits and street photography (03,04).\n\nIn August, we celebrated a year since we first unveiled the New Petzval Lens by holding the first ever dedicated Petzval competition and displaying the best photos taken with the New Petzval in Lomography Gallery Stores around the world. To coincide with Film Photography Day earlier in the year, we also held two âSearch For Analogue Starsâ competitions in order to find the very best photographers shooting film in the 21st century.\n\nWe also had a bunch of exciting film launches during the year. In July, we unveiled to the world Cine200 Tungsten Film; itâs a real cinematic film which has been specially altered to enable it to be used on 35mm photographic cameras. Having sold out in a matter of days, we were thrilled to be able to offer its follow-up, the 400 ISO Cine400 Tungsten Film, in October. And our film fun was not done yet. Later in October, LomoChrome Turquoise XR 100-400 Color Negative Film was launched. This film works similarly to LomoChrome Purple Film but offers brand new, crazy and fun color shifts to enjoy. It bathes your photos in lustrous tones â turning lighter colors into varying shades of blues from aqua to cobalt, transforming greens into deep emerald shades and changing a crystal clear sea into a golden hue (05).\n\nIn April 2016, we launched a brand new addition to the ever-expanding Lomography Art Lens family. Inspired by the lens that gave the world practical photography, the Daguerreotype Achromat 2.9/64 Art Lens is perfect for shooting rich, atmospheric images with beautiful bokeh backgrounds. Our brand new Art Lens was successfully funded on Kickstarter in just four hours â we could not have asked for a better response!\n\nHugely inspired by the support for the Daguerreotype Achromat, August 2016 saw us return to Kickstarter to launch an instant camera unlike any other. Fully automatic, jam-packed with creative features and super easy to use, the LomoâInstant Automat lets you take perfectly-exposed pictures in any and every lighting situation. Our brand new instant innovation was a huge success, and received excellent reviews from around the world.\n\nWe were super excited to take our two brand new inventions to Photokina, the worldâs leading trade fair for photo and video. We had tons of fun at our booth holding a live instant competition, hosting exhibitions, chatting to visitors, and letting people try out the very latest Lomography products. We were thrilled that so many people came to see us and loved our products!\n\nCompetitions celebrating the great photography produced by our talented Community have always been at the heart of Lomography, and thatâs why we decided to launch the TEN AND ONE Annual Lomography Photo Award. Lomographers are challenged to explore the fringes of photography, think outside the box, and enter their best shots into 11 different categories including âUrban Explorersâ and âBreaking Boundariesâ. The winners of each category then qualify for the TEN AND ONE Annual Lomography Photo Award. In 2016 we received tons of inspirational entries and we were delighted to award the winner over 20,000 EUR worth of prizes at the end of the year!\n\nBack in 2017, we turned 25 â and partied all year long! We curated the biggest LomoWall exhibition in history, collaborating with millions of creatives across the globe to bring countries, cultures and people together with the longest series of LomoWalls ever constructed. We threw crazy parties in Lomography Gallery Stores all over the world, showering our lovely Lomographers with special exhibitions, wonderful workshops and delicious cocktails.\n\nAnd thatâs not all! We rocketed back onto Kickstarter with two brand new inventions. Our brilliant backers helped us to create the Neptune Convertible Art Lens System, a handcrafted system with a collection of interchangeable front lenses for unlimited creative possibilities; and the LomoâInstant Square Glass, the worldâs first fully analogue camera for Instax square film.\n\nWe didnât stop there though. We created a rockinâ retro version of the Diana F+ to celebrate 10 years of daring Diana adventures, a gorgeous chrome-plated version of the Daguerreotype Achromat 2.9/64 Art Lens, and poured the purple back into the photographic ocean with new and improved LomoChrome Purple Film.\n\nTopping it all off, we brought the world bolder, sharper instant masterpieces than ever before with the LomoâInstant Automat Glass Magellan and Cabo Verde editions â and gave in to wanderlust with the LomoâInstant Murano, Panama, Yangon, and Oxford editions.\n\nAnd now, you can share your memories with your followers instantly through our new LomoâInstant App! Our marvelous Community have racked up an incredible 69 million likes so far â create a LomoHome and join the fun. Once youâre a member you can enter the TEN AND ONE Annual Lomography Photo Awards â last year, we received over 164,000 entries!\n\n2018 was a wonderful year to be a Lomographer, with our new additions to the analogue family truly taking things up a notch.\n\nIn June we launched the Diana Instant Square on Kickstarter, bringing the iconic, lusciously lo-fi Diana aesthetic to instant square format film. Named the most versatile instant camera ever by DigitalRev, we reached our Kickstarter goal in just over 24 hours, encouraging Lomographers to loosen up and embrace imperfection in all of its mesmerizing beauty.\n\nAs the year drew to a close we welcomed the Berlin Kino film into the fold. Inspired by the legendary New German Cinema movement, this black and white emulsion casted delicate grain and soft tones, immortalizing every snap in an enchanting cinematic monochrome.\n\nBut that wasnât all! We allowed our adventurous spirit to run wild with the LomoâInstant Automat Glass (Elbrus Edition), we celebrated the 25th anniversary of Lomo LC-A with some very special editions, we were hypnotised by the beguiling color negative FÂ² 120 film, turned heads with the shimmering Fisheye No.1 Caspian and packed our bags ready for an adventure with the Lomo Instant Mini Explorer. If that wasnât enough, we plunged into aquamarine hues with the Sprocket Rocket Teal and the LomoâInstant Automat (Riviera Edition).\n\nFinally we launched #HeyLomography which has amassed an incredible selection of Lomographers photos showcasing creativity and limitless imagination. Remember to share your shots on social media with this hashtag for a chance to be featured on our channels!\n\nOur long standing and light-headed love affair with Film reached new and dizzy heights. We fell in love with the romance of monochrome, launching the Potsdam Kino film in January, followed by the 2019 formula of our beloved Berlin Kino film in October. But we also dedicated ourselves to the creation of experimental, artistic color emulsions. We introduced two LomoChrome films in July. First came the third edition of our knock-out LomoChrome purple film, accompanied by the brand new LomoChrome Metropolis â the first new color negative film in over 5 years whose muted colors and stand out contrasts were successfully funded on Kickstarter.\n\nNot forgetting our cherished cameras, we began by adding two new editions to the La Sardina family: the La Sardina Fitzroy, a stunning primary-colored addition designed by illustrator Ale Giorgini, and the La Sardina Delaunay featuring striking art from the artist Robert Delaunay, as part of a collaboration with the Thyssen Museum in Madrid. We introduced the pocket-sized Diana Mini Picnic, perfect to take with you anywhere and added another string to our lens bow with the Lomogon Art Lens. This lens maintains all the colors, saturation, and character weâre known for, but with unrivalled resolution, gorgeous optic quality, perfectly circular bokeh, and trailblazing precision.\n\nThe snow cleared, the flowers sprung from the earth and spring brought some more exciting developments. We introduced the New Petzval 55 mm f/1.7 Bokeh Control Art Lens, designed specifically for the ever growing full-frame mirrorless systems. We held the second edition of our residency week in May, welcoming 11 talented Lomographers from all around the world, who were among the winners of our Lomography Annual Photography Awards: the TEN AND ONE. The week was filled with plenty of fun activities and ended with a LomoWall exhibition.\n\nTo promote the talent of all the film community out there, we held two Social Media tester call-outs. We were delighted and humbled to receive thousands of applications each time! We loved discovering new talents and seeing the world through different eyes.\n\nFinally, we introduced our most innovative creation to date â the LomoMod No.1. A flat-pack, cardboard DIY camera to build from scratch and a liquid-filled lens with a shutter and aperture unit. The culmination of everything weâve preached for the last 27 years, this dynamic duo turned the creative potential dials up to infinity.\n\nWe dove right into 2020 with a Kickstarter campaign for our Petzval 80.5 mm MKII Art Lens and successfully met our target in just over 24 hours â wow â Lomographers from all over the world did that. THANK YOU.\n\nUndeterred by the global pandemic, we released some extraordinary films too. The release of our vivaciously violet LomoChrome Purple film in 110 format was followed by the launch of two spectacular new low ISO additions to the Kino B&W Film Family â FantÃ´me Kino and Babylon Kino â boasting high-contrast drama and nuanced nostalgia respectively. LomoChrome Metropolis appeared in a very special Tokyo Edition outfit in collaboration with Kitamura and we also unveiled our Analogue Quartet and Analogue Duet selection film packs â the best way to try out four or two of our fabulous films, one roll at a time.\n\nLater in the year we teamed up with a super-cool Japanese street brand and released the limited Simple Use Reloadable Camera Ã Challenger edition. We also launched the Analogue Aqua â Simple Use Reloadable Camera + Underwater Case â perfect for all your outdoor escapes. This was a great year for our Simple Use Reloadable Cameras, undoubtedly one of our hottest items in 2020.\n\nWe went collaboration crazy and created some of our best limited-edition designs yet. Sundae Kids brought iconic comic characters, Park Song Lee provided a painterly pastel palette, Laura Slater brought bold blue design andâ¦drumroll pleaseâ¦William Klein adorned our LomoâInstant Wide with his provocative, progressive photographs. Boom.\n\nAs if that wasnât enough, we pulled a further two, brand spanking new inventions out of the bag. The LomoGraflok â the worldâs first Instant Back for 4Ã5 cameras designed for Fujifilm Instax Wide, and the HydroChrome Suttonâs Panoramic Belair Camera â sweeping panoramics, thrilling and unpredictable liquid-effects and exposed sprocket holes, all in one camera.\n\nDespite the obvious challenges faced throughout the year, the Lomography Community remained as strong, optimistic and experimental as ever. We worked hard to inspire creative minds worldwide with our indoor tipsters, tricks and DIY projects galore. We also hosted an open call for Lomography Testers on social media and welcomed some fantastic new photographers to the tester family and in between lockdowns as well as holding successful events including LomoWalks & Development Workshops with our partners worldwide â special mention goes to We Are One, an extraordinary LomoWall exhibit in Manila comprised of over 1,500 film photographs from international artists which aimed to highlight the beauty of cultural differences in times of unrest.\n\n2021 is over and what a year itâs been! We kept ourselves busy â reconnecting with our Community in the real world, enjoying exciting creative collaborations and giving our passionate Lomographers new and exciting photographic tools to experiment with.\n\nFirstly, it was a pleasure to see so many of you getting involved with our offline events. The NYC Film Photo Gathering was a particular highlight this year, with a record number of attendees joining workshops and photo walks throughout the day. We loved seeing all the happy coincidences from the Lomography x Initial LABO film swap project in France and the SAME SAME SAME but different project in Japan was an awesome way to share the Simple Use Reloadable camera love.\n\nSo, the world of Lomography continues to grow and we love to see our Community members getting stuck into our experimental way of life. But this year, your support in our new projects and product launches was unrivaled! In February, we launched our 13th Kickstarter project â the ultra-wide Atoll Art Lens â which you lovely lot successfully funded in less than 9 hours! Amazing!\n\nTo amp up the fun even more, we went big in our commitment to keeping film alive. In April, we kicked off four weeks of activities and celebrated Film Photography Day for an entire month! Our iconic LC-A+ turned 15 years old and most excitingly, we launched two new films in 2021! LomoChrome Metropolis got a new look â featuring even bolder contrasts and signature moody muted tones and, in a real blast from the past, LomoChrome Turquoise is back! After hundreds of emails, DMs, even letters sent by carrier pigeonâ¦ we decided to bring back the highly sought-after Turquoise treasure in 35 mm, 120 and brand-new 110 format.\n\nOn top of all of that, itâs been a mighty year for collaborations and we teamed up with some big names. Alongside Parisian music producer and DJ, Darius, we launched a dazzling special edition Simple Use Reloadable camera. Then, together with Berlin-based music producers KITSCHKRIEG, we released a special black and white Simple Use Reloadable camera to channel the groupâs unique monochrome aesthetic. We also found time to celebrate the Chinese New Year with our own Simple Use Reloadable Camera Optimistic Ox edition and got ready for the party season in style with the release of the disco-diva Saturday edition. This simple snapper remains a firm favorite in the Lomo world.\n\nBut thatâs not all! Our Instant cameras had their share of the limelight in 2021, with the LomoâInstant and LomoâInstant Automat cameras getting dressed up in thought-provoking limited edition artwork by Thai artists Gongkan and Suntur respectively. These releases challenged us all to think outside the frame and embrace our most crazy and experimental Lomographic desires.\n\nIn this marvelous year of Lomography we introduced new analogue inventions, brought much-loved Lomography legends back from the past and our lovely Lomographers around the world got involved in loads of exciting events. Most excitingly, we kicked off our 30th-anniversary celebrations!\n\nStarting strong, we gave our Online Shop a facelift and later in the year launched our Lomography Connoisseurs page â somewhere anyone can go to get inspired by cool photographers from all around the world and find out how they bring a little Lomography to their lives. Throughout the year, we encouraged our Lomographers to shoot from the hip and forget the rules, focusing particularly on medium format photography and simple ways to get creative with film.\n\nWith a snazzy new shop to show everything off, we announced our all-in-one scanning devices â the DigitaLIZA+ and DigitaLIZA Max â a super-easy way to scan film at home or on the go. Our dreamy Daguerreotype Achromat 2.9/64 Art Lens got a new look with black and silver aluminium finishes, and we designed new M-Mount Close-up Lens Adapters, expanding the Art Lens experimentation to full-frame mirrorless cameras.\n\nBarely stopping to catch our breath, new Acapulco beach edition Fisheye No.2 and La Sardina cameras surfaced â each featuring a unique fabric design. Always keen to listen to the requests from our lovely Lomographers, we re-released the small but mighty Fisheye Baby 110 in two exciting designs and, not forgetting our film family, Lomographers around the world received their rolls of LomoChrome Turquoise 2021 formula!\n\nAt Lomography, the fun never stops! We went wild for the LomoâInstant Automat Glass Serengeti, played our cards right with the LomoâInstant Wide Monte Carlo, and, in collaboration with Hong Kong artist, Vivian Ho, our LomoâInstant Automat got an insightful new illustration.\n\nNow, drum roll please, in October we had some BIG news. Letting reality take a backseat, we dove headfirst into experimentation with the new LomoApparat Camera. This wide-angle 35 mm camera helps Lomographers push the boundaries of the analogue world and enjoy super-simple everyday analogue experimentation!\n\nJust as the Lomography product family ever increases, so does our charming Lomography Community. We love to meet our Lomographers in person and were excited to see tons of you get involved in fun events like our LomoChrome Metropolis LomoWalks across North America. Across the pond, design enthusiasts were introduced to the lovely La Sardina at the La Sardina Ã London Design Festival LomoWalk â capturing Londonâs architecture on LomoChrome Metropolis film. Meanwhile, Lomography Japan organized the inspirational Pocket 110 Exhibition, bringing miniature experimentation to a wider audience. Lomography France held an exclusive photo project with full backstage access to the OpÃ©ra Comique, one of the best-kept secrets in Paris, and Lomography Italy provided Diana F+ cameras to selected students of the Italian Institute of Photography, challenging their creativity and technical competence across several categories for an enthralling exhibition in Milan.\n\nBut the challenges didnât stop there! For Film Photography Day we held a HUGE Film Swap Challenge asking pairs of photographers from around the world to shoot on the same roll of film for some whacky results, and our motivational Golden Rules Challenge got everyoneâs Lomographic brains whirring.\n\nSpeaking of golden rules, in November we kicked off our anniversary celebrations, exactly 30 years after the Lomographic Society International was founded and the golden rules were published! To celebrate our milestone, we released limited edition LC-A cameras and asked our Lomographers why they shoot film in our 30 Reasons For Analogue survey. Over the next year, weâve got loads of cool events lined up to challenge, inspire and unite our Lomographers! We canât wait to celebrate our 30th year of breaking the rules and look forward to exciting times ahead!\n\nIn 2023 we unleashed a wave of analogue passion that rippled across the globe. Our mission? To not just keep film alive but to help it thrive for years to come! It was the year where learning met creativity, collaboration sparked innovation, and 120 film became the anthem of Lomographers worldwide.\n\nEarly on in the year, we launched an exciting resource to empower Lomographers; the Lomo School is an online space where beginner and advanced photographers can learn everything they ever wanted to know about film. Additionally, for our Learning with Lomography Magazine series, we collaborated with universities and schools around the world, providing creative students with the tools to bring their artistic visions to life.\n\nBeyond education, we kickstarted our Future for 120 campaign, declaring medium format film an Endangered Species. This rallying cry against the fading popularity of this exciting format aims to rejuvenate its popularity. We arenât about to let 120 be left in the shadows!\n\nIn other news, we successfully funded our 14th Kickstarter campaign â the Nour Triplet V 2.0/64 Bokeh Control Art Lens, the worldâs first full-frame mirrorless lens dedicated to spherical aberration control â and introduced LomoChrome Color â92 film to bring a hint of nostalgia to the analogue world. We were excited to offer a never-seen-before film emulsion and we will continue to imagine and design new films in the future. Meanwhile, new camera editions like the LomoApparat Chiyoda, Fisheye No.2 Grape Jam and Diana F+ CMYK offer more choices to our Community as we continue to develop and produce all the tools you need to capture the wonderful world around you with analogue."
