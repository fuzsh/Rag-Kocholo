However, Incidental 6 walks up to the door and attempts to make an order. Squidward smugly informs him that they are closed, and the customer prepares to take his money elsewhere. Realizing the financial potential of a late-night shift, Mr. Krabs tears apart the \"Closed\" sign and, against Squidward's wishes, proclaims the Krusty Krab to now be open 24 hours a day. Mr. Krabs then promptly leaves his employees while SpongeBob is overjoyed at this prospect and, as the night goes on, takes pleasure in the tasks he had no time to do during the day. When the time comes to take out the trash, however, he shows some trepidation towards the darkness outside. After going outside screaming to throw away the trash, he comes back in and calls it an easy task.\n\nSquidward, sensing SpongeBob's fear, weaves him a terrifying tale on the spot of a \"hash-slinging slasher,\" a clumsy Krusty Krab fry cook from years past who accidentally chopped off his hand and had it replaced with a rusty spatula. Due to fatally being run over by a bus and posthumous termination, the horrific specter returns every Tuesday night (though Squidward only put this detail in the story when SpongeBob told him that it was Tuesday) to exact vengeance on all who reside in the restaurant. Squidward goes on to explain the three signs of the ghost's return: the lights flickering on and off, the phone ringing with no one at the other end, and the arrival of the bus that had run the fry cook over. Squidward then laughs at SpongeBob's shrieks of fright, but when SpongeBob continues screaming, an annoyed Squidward tells SpongeBob that he was joking and that the story is not true.\n\n3:00 AM soon arrives and the restaurant is now completely devoid of customers or any other signs of life besides SpongeBob and Squidward. Whilst contending with SpongeBob's diligent ceiling washing, Squidward expresses bafflement at the idea of the Krusty Krab being open 24 hours a day, wondering who would want a Krabby Patty at that time. (Ironically, a cutaway gag shows Patrick excitedly waking up at this hour specifically to eat a Krabby Patty.)\n\nSuddenly, the lights begin flickering, though Squidward initially thinks SpongeBob is doing it in a failed attempt to scare him. After realizing that nobody is touching the light switch, Squidward then blames the faulty electrical wiring, as the restaurant was not built to run 24 hours a day. The next moment, the phone rings but remains silent when Squidward answers. This time, SpongeBob thinks that Squidward is trying to scare him, but the latter denies this and becomes more nervous as these are two of the three signs that supposedly signal the arrival of the Hash-Slinging Slasher. While trying to remember the third sign, a bus pulls up to the Krusty Krab, even though the buses supposedly do not run so late. Its lone departing passenger is a shadow-covered figure with what appears to be glowing red eyes, wielding a spatula. Fearing it to be the Hash-Slinging Slasher, Squidward screams in horror. SpongeBob states that he is dressed up as the ghost across the street to entertain him because he loves him. However, there are flaws in SpongeBob's theory that Squidward explained. The first thing is that he hates him, and the other thing is how is the ghost that is standing across the street is him when he is standing right next to him. Having thought about Squidward's argument, the Hash-Slinging Slasher taps on the door, which made SpongeBob scream in horror as well.\n\nBelieving the events they witness to be supernatural, a frightened SpongeBob and Squidward say their final words as the figure approaches the counter. When the figure enters the light, however, he turns out to be just an ordinary person holding a spatula in a fully intact hand, which had been covered by his sleeve. He asks for a job application and reveals that he was the one who called earlier but hung up before speaking because he was nervous. Relieved, SpongeBob asks the applicant if he has any references, though Squidward notes that this turn of events does not explain the lights flickering.\n\nAs if to answer his question, the lights flicker again, revealing the culprit to be none other than the vampire Nosferatu (portrayed by the late Max Schreck). They casually tease him, as if this is a well-known habit to Krusty Krab staff and clients alike. Smiling at the trio mischievously, he flicks the lights off once more, cutting to black and ending the episode.\n\nProduction[]\n\nThis episode was in production as early as March 2000.[2]\n\nBackground design[]\n\nModel sheets[]\n\nStoryboards[]\n\nRough boarded by Dan Povenmire[2] and Jay Lender.[1]\n\nDeleted scenes[]\n\nThe Nautical Nonsense and Sponge Buddies DVD features Tom Kenny and Rodger Bumpass reenacting the recording process for a scene from this episode. It also includes storyboards of this episode and a deleted scene, in which SpongeBob does another activity \"at night\" as he delivers the mail to \"Floorboard Harry.\" Floorboard Harry was also originally going to be the one responsible for flickering the lights, rather than Nosferatu.\n\nAfter Squidward tells SpongeBob a scary story, SpongeBob ask him about multiple background fish that have various objects in place of their hands, such as a hook, a scythe, two toasters and a chainsaw.\n\nMusic[]\n\n( ‣ ) Production music\n\n( • ) Original music\n\n( ◦ ) SpongeBob music\n\n‣ Finger of Suspicion 2 - Harry Bluestone, Emil Cadkin [Title card]\n\n‣ Queen's Aloha Oe C - Kapono Beamer, Queen Lili'uokalani [Opening]\n\n• Idea Sting - Nicolas Carr [\"Money?\"]\n\n‣ Hello Sailor (B) - Richard Myhill [Krusty Krab open 24 hours]\n\n‣ On The Beach - Kapono Beamer [\"Isn't this great, Squidward?\"/\"All right!

His description says:\n\n\"'Night, night, night, night.' Having Nosferatu, the vampire from the 1922 silent German Expressionist horror film appear in a Nicktoon is exactly the kind of 'what the?' moment that sets this series apart from more conventional animated shows!\"\n\nTrivia[]\n\nGeneral[]\n\nThis is the first episode for a few things:\n\nThe first episode where the Krusty Krab is open 24/7.\n\nThe first usage of the track \"Hello Sailor (B),\" and any tracks composed by Harry Bluestone and Emil Cadkin.\n\nThe first episode where \"House of Horror\" plays four out of five parts of this version.\n\nThis also marks the first time part five of \"House of Horror\" plays at a higher pitch.\n\nThe first episode Dan Povenmire (the co-creator of the Disney Channel/Disney XD animated series Phineas and Ferb) wrote.\n\nThis is also Dan Povenmire's favorite episode he worked on.[3]\n\nJay Lender shared a story about Dan's first rough panel on the show: \"I put it in this \"frame,\" and it had a place of honor on my office door until Nickelodeon gave me the boot.\"[2]\n\nThis episode and \"Club SpongeBob\" were the first to be released on home video before airing on American television. It was available on the Nautical Nonsense VHS tape and the Nautical Nonsense and Sponge Buddies DVD, which were released on March 12, 2002, six months before it aired on American television.\n\nThere is a book based on this episode named Shiver Me Timbers!\n\nThe title card background for this episode is similar to those of \"Squidward the Unfriendly Ghost\" and \"Rock Bottom,\" though this one is recolored purple and it's upside down.\n\nBoth of those episodes are in season 1.\n\nTo \"sling hash\" means to work in a restaurant.\n\nThis and its sister episode were the only episodes where Doug Lawrence received top billing under the writer credits, until he started writing episodes solo.\n\nPatrick's quote \"Oh Boy! 3am!\" has become a popular internet meme.\n\nDuring the scene where Squidward tells his ghost story of the Hash-Slinging Slasher to SpongeBob, Paul Tibbitt just puts a pair of vampire teeth, a vampire cape, and a pair of demon horns on Squidward's voice actor Rodger Bumpass, and handed him a flashlight and asked him to try the attire and flashlight, so he could tell the scary story and he did with the flashlight in front of his face while hamming the story up by ad-libbing it and records it in one take.\n\nThe Krusty Krab closes at 6:00 PM in other episodes, but in this episode, it closes at 8:00 PM.\n\nThough it is likely that Mr. Krabs extended the closing time by two hours in this episode.\n\nCount Orlok, who is erroneously called Nosferatu in this episode, is the titular character of a 1922 German horror film of the same name, in which he was played by Max Schreck. The pictures of him seen in the episode were taken directly from the film.\n\nThis episode aired on September 6, 2002, which would've been Max Schreck's 123rd birthday. Max Schreck was born on September 6, 1879, and passed away on February 20, 1936.\n\nNosferatu later appears in the episodes \"The Night Patty,\" \"A Place for Pets,\" \"Captain Pipsqueak,\" \"Squidferatu,\" and \"Slappy Daze,\" as well as the Kamp Koral episodes \"Cabin of Curiosities\" and \"Kitchen Sponge.\"\n\nDespite Squidward saying the Hash-Slinging Slasher replaced his severed hand with a rusty spatula, when Richard shows up with a clean spatula, Squidward still panics.\n\nSpongeBob's line \"Squidward, I used your clarinet to unclog my toilet!\" is mentioned on the February 4, 2014 episode of Jeopardy!.[4]\n\nThis episode is later referenced in \"Restraining SpongeBob,\" where Patrick uses Squidward's clarinet to unclog the toilets at the Krusty Krab like SpongeBob says he does in this episode to his own toilets.\n\nThis episode was paired with different episodes in different airings:\n\nOn the May 17, 2003 airing, this episode was paired with \"Procrastination.\"[5]\n\nDuring the Bikini Bottom's Most Wanted, this episode was paired with \"Nasty Patty.\"[6]\n\nOn the October 26, 2008 airing, it was paired with \"Ghost Host.\"[7]\n\nOn the October 28, 2009 airing, this episode was paired with \"I Was a Teenage Gary.\"[8]\n\nDub facts[]\n\nIn the Russian dub, the Hash Slinging Slasher was renamed to \"Гарри-Рубленое Мясо\" in Russian dub, which translates to \"Harry-Chopped Meat.\"\n\nIn Indonesia, some lines were edited:\n\nThe line \"But what was that third thing?\" was changed to \"Who changed the colors?\"\n\nThe line \"How are you doing that without moving the switch?\" was changed to \"What are you doing with the switch?\"\n\nThe line \"And then, he got hit by a bus! And... at his funeral, they fired him!\" was changed to \"And then, he became crazy! And... after that, the fire burned him!\" This one changes the hash-slinging slasher's backstory completely.\n\nThe line \"Squidward, I use your clarinet to unclog my toilet!\" was changed to \"Squidward! Get rid of him!\"\n\nNear the end of the episode, the line \"Nosferatu!\" was changed to \"Don't be naughty!\" because Nosferatu is even less well-known in Indonesia.\n\nHowever, Nosferatu's name was used later in the Indonesian dub, in the season 11 episode \"The Night Patty.\"\n\nIn the Turkish dub, the line \"Nosferatu!\" was changed to \"So, it was you!\"\n\nIn the French dub:\n\nThe Hash Slinging Slasher is called \"Marcel, roi de la spatule\" (Marcel, king of the spatula).\n\nWhen SpongeBob says \"I didn't know the buses ran this late!\", instead of saying \"They don't\" Squidward says \"Me neither.\"\n\nRather than exclaiming \"Nosferatu!\" at the end the characters simply say \"Oh, that's not good!\"\n\nCultural references[]\n\nSpongeBob's \"Night Song\" has the tune of a Baseball/Hockey Charge Stadium organ song.\n\nThe hash-slinging slasher is an apparent parody of the story The Hook, where a man has a hook instead of a hand.\n\nThe sign about the telephone ringing is similar to a scene from the 1996 horror film, Scream.\n\nThe green slime oozing from the walls of the Krusty Krab is a reference to the climax of the original 1979 version of The Amityville Horror where blood drips down from the haunted house's walls.\n\nNosferatu is from the 1922 horror film of the same name.\n\nErrors[]\n\nThis episode along with its sister episode are incorrectly listed with a 2000 copyright date in the end credits.\n\nThis also happens in the previous episode \"The Secret Box\"/\"Band Geeks.\"\n\nSquidward says that the hash-slinging slasher comes out every Tuesday night and his ghost returns to the Krusty Krab. However, he still panicked when the person who was thought to be the hash-slinging Slasher came to apply for a job, even though it was 3:00 AM Wednesday morning.\n\nAt one scene when SpongeBob is about to walk outside to take out the trash but then stops, the night sky outside the window is normal, but in the next scene when the camera zooms out of the glass door, the night sky is green with misshapen flower clouds. The sky remains as such for the rest of the episode.\n\nBefore Squidward says the three signs that signal the approach of the hash-slinging slasher, the wrinkles on his forehead disappear for a shot.\n\nWhen Squidward tells SpongeBob that the issue was not that the Slasher had not washed his hands, Squidward's eyes overlap with his eyebrows.\n\nWhen SpongeBob laughs after Squidward admits he was kidding, his buck teeth disappear for a frame.\n\nIn one shot while SpongeBob is screaming, his mouth closes during each one as if he was speaking at the same time.\n\nWhen Squidward tries to stop SpongeBob's screaming session, his eyes are not aligned with his eyebrows.\n\nWhen SpongeBob is mopping the ceiling, the water from the bucket does not fall to the ground.\n\nThe cash register is missing for half of the episode. As Squidward is telling the story, it returns.\n\nWhen Squidward says, \"And he appears with the ghost of the bus,\" and, \"He opens the door, and approaches the counter,\" the \"Order Here\" and \"Galley Grub\" signs are missing.\n\nThey disappear again when the walls are covered with green slime.\n\nNear the beginning when Squidward is about to leave, the Galley Grub sign reads, \"Gally Grub,\" and when SpongeBob shouts, \"Are you ready to rock, Squidward?\" it reads, \"Gallay Grub.\" At another point, the Order Here sign reads, \"Order Hear.\"\n\nAn \"Open Forever\" neon sign is seen on the Krusty Krab in one shot. However, when the \"hash-slinging slasher\" approaches the Krusty Krab, the sign is gone.\n\nThe Chum Bucket does not appear across from the Krusty Krab.\n\nWhen Squidward and SpongeBob are shaking under the misconception that the Hash-Slinging Slasher approaches, the red line under SpongeBob's mouth flickers between normal and invisible.\n\nThe storyboard artists are not credited in this episode. Only the storyboard directors are credited.\n\nThis also happens in \"Rock Bottom,\" \"The Fry Cook Games,\" and \"Sandy, SpongeBob, and the Worm.\"\n\nVideos[]\n\nReferences[]"
