Rolo Tomassi

Grievances

(Ipecac Recordings)

It’s quite fitting that British bonkers punk/metal/prog band Rolo Tomassi’s first US release (and fourth overall) is with Mike Patton’s Ipecac Recordings. It doesn’t take but two songs to understand how little Rolo Tomassi cares for genre norms. Grievances is an alarmingly abrasive listen, separated by stark periods of wonderful beauty. Of course, because the Sheffield-based band is so musically adept, these musical transitions feel assured and meticulously planned, albeit by a mad scientist. How else do you explain how united “Stage Knives”, “Estranged”, and “Raumdeuter” sound, despite drawing from a wide assortment of musical wells? Rolo Tomassi, after a series of solid yet not quite there releases, has gotten much closer to achieving a perfect balance between art and punk.

To wit, Rolo Tomassi is artistic in a very modern sense. Their music is brash and abrasive, drawing influence from luminaries like The Dillinger Escape Plan, Converge, and Blood Brothers; however, at the heart of even the heaviest moments on Grievances, the band approaches the music from a pensive distance. Hell, even the recording quality leaves the album feeling distant, as if the band doesn’t want to be too close to the airing of its grievances. Regardless, Rolo Tomassi are a masterclass in how to constantly surprise yet maintain a sound. Grievances almost never feels it veers off to left field just because. There’s always a purpose, even if that purpose is just to provide musical context. The British band’s American debut is impressive, showcasing admirable sonic bravery. (Nicholas Senior)
