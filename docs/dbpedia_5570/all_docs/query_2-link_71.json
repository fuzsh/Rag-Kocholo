        "text": "Dillon Phipps May 10th, 2023 - 5:14 PM\n\nBritish mathcore band, Rolo Tomassi, is coming to Austin, Texas on June 11th! Their brand new tour was just announced and includes 15 stops. The tour starts on June 6th and includes special guests Callous Daoboys and Pound. Tickets are still available here!\n\nRolo Tomassi was formed in 2005 in Sheffield, England. Members include lead singer Eva Korman, James Spence on backing vocals, piano and synthesizers, Chris Cayford on guitar, Nathan Fairweather on bass guitar and Al Pott on the drums. The band is known for their strong ethics in DIY. When they formed they had the goal to keep the band as DIY as they could. They handmade their first songs and DIYed their own shows. They even passed out their first 3 track Demo by hand to people who came to their local shows.\n\nIn September of 2008, they released their album Hysterics, although not listed on streaming platforms due to their DIY ethics during their starts. Within the next year, they started their “Subs Club” series. They released a new single every 3 months on 7’ vinyls and they all had unique covers and remixes. It was a fun project that fans looked forward to every 3 months. Later in 2009, they played at Austin’s South by Southwest festival and received positive feedback from the city. In October of 2009, the band finished recording their next album Cosmology and released it in May of 2010. These two albums did not make it onto streaming platforms until 2015 and are now available to listen to on all devices. They released their 3rd album, Astraea, on November 4th, 2012.\n\nTheir next 3 albums are a trilogy. The trilogy includes Grievances, Time Will Die and Love Will Bury It and their most recent album, Where Myth Becomes Memory. With Grievances coming out in 2015, this trilogy was over 7 years in the making. Unlike the album before, Grievances has a dark feeling and uses pianos and violins for a darker and ominous feeling. They have also started their own record label named Destination Moon. Here, they have released an assortment of rare material that cannot be found on any of their albums. It includes acoustic versions of their songs and remixes they created of their own works. It also includes covers of Throats that they have recorded.\n\nTheir music is exciting and has odes to many different music genres. Some of the most apparent genres the band can be categorized into are screamo, Nintendocore, alternative rock, metal, rock and hardcore. Their earlier works are better known for their jazzy sounds and experimenting with screamo and mathcore. Along with their music, they are known for their incredible stage presence. The band members have been called “insane hardcore acrobats” when on stage. This combination is the perfect recipe for an exciting show one does not want to miss!\n\nWhen? June 11th, 2023\n\nWhere? Come and Take It Live (2015 E Riverside Dr bldg 4, Austin, TX 78741)\n\nTime? 7:00 pm CT\n\nAges? All ages welcome but no re-entry for attendants under 21"
