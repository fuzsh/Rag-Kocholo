        "text": "The big day is almost here! Morgan Wallen is probably on his way to Minnesota, where he will play two back-to-back shows at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis.\n\nMorgan announced his first show at the venue back in September. It sold out so quickly that he added a second date shortly after. The more Morgan, the better, right?\n\nPacking For The Show?\n\nHis first show will be Thursday (June 20th), followed by an encore on Friday. If you are getting ready to head to the cities, you will want to make sure you have everything you need and brush up on what is and isn't allowed inside the stadium.\n\nWho Is Opening For The Show + When Do Doors Open?\n\nThis lineup is great! Newcomer Bryan Martin will kick things off, followed by Nate Smith and then Bailey Zimmerman.\n\nRELATED: Our B105 Concert Calendar\n\nDoors open at 4:30 p.m. and the show kicks off at 5:30 p.m. This gives you time to grab a drink and some merch before taking your seat!\n\nTicket Details\n\nAttending concerts is definitely different post-pandemic, especially when it comes to how you bring your tickets to the show.\n\nMake sure you have your tickets downloaded onto your phone before you head to the stadium so you don't hold up the line. Service is also spotty so this will save you a big headache.\n\nRELATED: Join Us Every Saturday For The B105 Pontoon Party!\n\nIf you need something at the box office, it will be open at 10 a.m. on both Thursday and Friday. The ticket office is located on the northwest corner of U.S. Bank between the Legacy and Polaris gates.\n\nShould You Bring Cash & A Purse?\n\nNope! U.S. Bank Stadium is now completely cashless.\n\nThey also have a clear bag policy so only bags that are clear plastic, vinyl or PVC are allowed into the venue. Bags cannot exceed 12\" by 6\" by 12\" to be allowed inside.\n\nPlan Your Transportation\n\nEvent organizers also offered up a few other tips for concert goers, like reminding everyone to plan their transportation to and from the concert.\n\nThe U.S. Bank Skyway route will be open both show dates from 2 p.m. to 1 a.m. If taking public transportation, make sure to check the schedule and plan it out before heading to the show.\n\nYou can read about the clear bag policy, along with transportation details and the like, on U.S. Bank's website now."
