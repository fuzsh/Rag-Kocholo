That compilation was even praised by the ever difficult to please Anthony Fantano, and unsurprisingly I didn’t particularly love it (my opinions rarely align with Fantano’s). I didn’t care particularly for the production’s tendency to let the noisy harmonic squeaks overwhelm the mix, burying the actual instrumental writing, or the fairly sloppy vocal performance, and the very mathcore-esque slapdash pile-up of riffs and breakdowns has just never been a form of song structure or composition that impresses me much. However, though ‘Songs for the Firing Squad‘ didn’t astound me, tracks like “Self Help Specialist Ends His Own Life” did solidify my interest in the band, showcasing an interesting creative vision and the potential for the band to become something truly special. That said, the band’s debut album ‘The Correlation Between Entrance and Exit Wounds‘ honestly snuck up on me (which is more on me being a bad critic and not paying attention to when new albums are coming out), and as a result I went into the album with no inclination of the direction the band chose to take. So, how did ‘The Correlation Between Entrance and Exit Wounds‘ come out?\n\nWell, simply put this is one of the best metalcore albums of the year, offering a better produced, more focused, more mature, and more emotionally complex take on SeeYouSpaceCowboy’s chaotic, noisy, early metalcore-influenced roots. Longer song lengths allow the band to develop their musical ideas better than their earlier work. The result is an album that feels incredibly artistic, using its raw, chaotic nature as a tool to create emotive power rather than simple shock value as seen on their compilation album. As such, ‘The Correlation Between Entrance and Exit Wounds‘ reminds me a lot of Rolo Tomassi’s ‘Time Will Die and Love Will Bury It‘ from last year; though SeeYouSpaceCowboy lack Rolo Tomassi’s lush, almost symphonic textures and longform progressive metal influenced songwriting, they have a similar sense for building atmosphere and emotional stakes. Of course, I do have a couple criticisms I would like to address now so as not to detract from the praise I’m going to pile on as I dig into the writing. Though it works incredibly well contextually, the interlude “Have You Lost the Plot” has a high-pitched static squeak in the right side of the mix that is simply painful to listen to with headphones, and the final track “The Phoenix Must Reset” ends rather abruptly, without feeling truly complete to me; though it does have the positive effect of making me want to spin the album again. Well, with those minor nitpicks out of the way, lets dive into the content.\n\nCompositionally this album is as frantic, chaotic, and brutally heavy as the band’s past work, full of pummeling riffs, pinch harmonic and panic chord squeals, driving breakdowns, as they infuse DIY hardcore with the youth and vigor that emanated from scenecore bands like Attack Attack. However, as I mentioned previously, longer song lengths help the writing feel more impactful. Rather than songs being maybe a single riff, some noisy pinch harmonics on a brief bridge, and a breakdown, songs take on more complexity, as the band are able to use more diverse song structures to give tracks more direction. It also gives the band the opportunity to write more melodic passages, such as on “Late December” and “The Phoenix Must Reset.” The two instrumental tracks “A Space Marked ‘Escape’” and “No Words, No Compensating Lies” feature lead guitar lines that almost sound like something August Burns Red might write. The production has significantly improved, with the feedback on the higher pitches much better cleared out on the mix, allowing the phenomenal instrumentation to shine. The guitar, bass, and drum tones are still very raw, natural, and biting, but the soundscape is much cleaner.\n\nConnie Sgarbossa’s vocal performance has also vastly improved. Her screams are much clearer than they ever have been, while still retaining her raw, visceral, almost deranged delivery and tone. When she changes into her spoken word delivery, rather than the weird artificially high squawk seen on past songs like “I’m a Trans-Continental Railroad, Please Run a Train on Me,” she instead leans into her deeper, huskier natural voice. There are also some true sung vocal lines, particularly on “Dissertation of an Idle Voice,” which features a haunting melody behind Connie’s screams. Lyrically this album is deeply personal. Again “Late December” stands out, a heartbreaking tribute to a friend Connie lost to suicide. “Put on a Show, Don’t Let Them See You Fall,” serves as encouragement to those who feel marginalized, coming from her position as a trans-woman. These personal lyrics, Connie’s emotive delivery, and the fantastic instrumentation come together for one of the most haunting listens I’ve had this year."
