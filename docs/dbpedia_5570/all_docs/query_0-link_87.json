On the one hand, I want to keep Everything Is Noise a place about music, a place to experience a certain escapism from the turmoil of the world. Nonetheless, I want to express my support for the people in the Ukraine facing an invasion, brought into their lives by Wladimir Putin and the Russian government. I urge you to participate in ways to help the people there to get through those hellish times, either with donations or other ways of support. Please keep in mind that there are multiple ways to help those people in need, so wherever you are, you can do something good. For the people who are experiencing this war directly: I hope for a quick ending of the fights, and for you and your loved ones to stay as safe as possible. This is a disastrous scenario for the whole world, and I can’t even comprehend how confusing, disturbing, and dangerous it is for the people in the Ukraine.\n\nIn these strange times, music becomes even more important as something positive, inviting, and motivating. That’s why I was so happy to experience a stream of fantastic records in February, in many shapes and forms. Escape from reality for a bit and delve into some truly beautiful albums!"
