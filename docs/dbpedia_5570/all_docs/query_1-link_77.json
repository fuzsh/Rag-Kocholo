        "text": "Tag: Punk\n\nMy Favourite Albums of 2019\n\nThere’s a lot that I’ve been grateful for this year, and I am happy to report that 2019 has been a pretty solid year for yours-truly (if not the world at large). I took up running, which meant I took up heavy music again, and I got slightly better at speaking Chinese, even if I… Read More My Favourite Albums of 2019\n\nRate this:\n\nRecord of the Day #15 – Trash Talk, Eyes & Nines\n\nI’ve worked a few jobs across my twenty-two years of living, and my first and favorite role was a relatively straightforward one. Between the ages of thirteen and seventeen, I delivered papers around the neighborhood in which I lived, putting in a shift six days a week so that I could afford music magazines and CDs… Read More Record of the Day #15 – Trash Talk, Eyes & Nines\n\nRate this:\n\nRecord of the Day #10 – Trap Them, Sleepwell Deconstructor\n\nI’ll have to keep this one brief, like the actual record itself. Trap Them’s debut LP Sleepwell Deconstructor clocks in at just over twenty-one thunderous minutes, twelve tracks of gritty hardcore punk/grindcore/hardcore. However you want to classify it, it shreds, a devastating record produced by Converge’s own Kurt Ballou. This thing is fierce, and its a record… Read More Record of the Day #10 – Trap Them, Sleepwell Deconstructor\n\nRate this:\n\nTop 101 Records of 2016\n\nI listed 101 records that I’ve enjoyed this year, as my field of interest dictates that I must. It gets real.… Read More Top 101 Records of 2016\n\nRate this:\n\nThe Wonder Years – No Closer To Heaven (Review)\n\nSince first hearing The Upsides some five years ago, in an old friends bedroom, The Wonder Years have always been a constant in my musical life, each of their records an anchor to a particular period of time, realigning with each new release. The bands second record was for the angst-riddled teenager I was back then, hating… Read More The Wonder Years – No Closer To Heaven (Review)\n\nRate this:\n\nDonovan Wolfington – How To Treat The Ones You Love (Review)\n\nFuzzy and infectious second from the best named band in whatever genre Donovan Wolfington are right now. I can’t think of many bands hailing from New Orleans, and even if I could, Donovan Wolfington would probably be better than them. The Louisiana natives caused ripples within their respective field with the release of DIY debut Stop… Read More Donovan Wolfington – How To Treat The Ones You Love (Review)\n\nRate this:\n\nSorority Noise – Joy, Departed (Review)\n\n‘I might not be as dark as I think’ Sorority Noise vocalist Cameron Boucher sings midway through the sixth track on the bands second record. Art School Wannabe, the song in question, is upbeat and oddly carefree, and the line feels a little off given that it follows Your Soft Blood, which is undoubtedly the… Read More Sorority Noise – Joy, Departed (Review)\n\nRate this:\n\nGallows – Desolation Sounds (Review)\n\nIf their eponymous last record wasn’t enough proof already, the Gallows of the 2010’s are not the same Gallows that released Orchestra Of Wolves or Grey Britain, and if I wasn’t a huge fan of both those records I wouldn’t even mention them in this review. I have to though, because after a masterpiece like… Read More Gallows – Desolation Sounds (Review)\n\nRate this:\n\nGnarwolves – Gnarwolves (Self-Titled) [Review]\n\nWhen Brighton trio Gnarwolves announced an LP consisting of their first three EPs a few months back I decided to take the opportunity and sell the 7″ versions of these EPs, seeing as I wouldn’t be playing them (and could do with the money). As you do, I listed them on eBay, and as the… Read More Gnarwolves – Gnarwolves (Self-Titled) [Review]\n\nRate this:\n\nBasement – Further Sky EP (Review)\n\nAll it took was a single tweet of ‘Hi’ back in January to send the internet into frenzy – could Basement really be back? The answer was a resounding yes, and now six months later the band are releasing their first material since 2012’s exceptional Colourmeinkindness, and that material comes in the form of EP Further… Read More Basement – Further Sky EP (Review)\n\nRate this:\n\nDikembe – Mediumship (Review)\n\n‘It’s been a long time coming / I spent a long time rotting before I got going’ A few months back Dikembe sent out a tweet instructing critics to refer to their new record as ‘feebleviolence’. Being some kind of critic I thought ‘Okay, I’ll roll with it’, and now that I’ve listened to the… Read More Dikembe – Mediumship (Review)\n\nRate this:\n\nMöngöl Hörde – Möngöl Hörde (Self-Titled) [Review]\n\nI’ll listen to pretty much anything with Frank Turner’s name on it. He could play two seconds of the triangle on a twenty-minute track and I’d likely lap it up. I was a latecomer to the long-gone Million Dead, finding them long after their split after discovering Turner’s solo material, but I loved what I… Read More Möngöl Hörde – Möngöl Hörde (Self-Titled) [Review]\n\nRate this:\n\nSam Russo / Brendan Kelly – Split The Tip (Review)\n\nI used to read Kerrang a lot as a kid, and I vaguely remember a cover feature they ran one week pitting the UK music scene against the US equivalent. I didn’t really care for it at the time, and I care for it even less now, but I know some publications are still somewhat fixated… Read More Sam Russo / Brendan Kelly – Split The Tip (Review)\n\nRate this:\n\nSorority Noise – Forgettable (Review)\n\nI should really start this review by saying that Forgettable is anything but. It’s a cheap and clichéd line, but I wanted to get it out of the way as soon as possible. Sorry, let’s move past it. Chances are you’ll already be familiar with a few of the members that make up Sorority Noise,… Read More Sorority Noise – Forgettable (Review)\n\nRate this:\n\nThe Menzingers – Rented World (Review)\n\nThis is the second time I’ve written this review, and initially I tried to be objective and write about Rented World without dwelling too much on its predecessor, which is arguably the best punk-rock album of the last decade, and one of my favourite records of all time behind The Gaslight Anthem’s The ’59 Sound. I wanted… Read More The Menzingers – Rented World (Review)\n\nRate this:\n\nThe Used – Imaginary Enemy (Review)\n\nThe Used are a band who’ve built their career by doing things their own way, and their records have always been memorable in distinct ways, but Imaginary Enemy is their most concise and rallying yet, taking the voice they’ve established over the last decade and giving it renewed purpose. In this sense Imaginary Enemy is… Read More The Used – Imaginary Enemy (Review)\n\nRate this:\n\nI Am The Avalanche – Wolverines (Track-By-Track Review)\n\nI’m a little later than I’d planned with this review, and so I figured I’d dumb things down a bit and try a track-by-track review, something I haven’t done before. I Am The Avalanche’s last album Avalanche United is one I still spin on a weekly basis, so I wanted to cover it’s follow-up, and… Read More I Am The Avalanche – Wolverines (Track-By-Track Review)\n\nRate this:\n\nLung Season – 2014 (Review)\n\nLung Season are the latest band to sign to American label Giant MKT, and they’re set to release their debut 7” 2014 on March 11th, although it’s currently available to stream here. Whereas the releases name may be considered unimaginative the three tracks that 2014 contains are brilliantly unrestrained, brimming with enough energy and potential… Read More Lung Season – 2014 (Review)\n\nRate this:\n\nThe Hotelier – Home, Like Noplace Is There (Review)\n\nThere’s a reason that Home, Like Noplace Is There is one of the years most anticipated releases, and thankfully the hype that surrounds it is entirely justified by the nine tracks that feature. Tiny Engines have a reputation for only releasing great music and The Hotelier’s sophomore release is probably the best they’ve put out,… Read More The Hotelier – Home, Like Noplace Is There (Review)\n\nRate this:"
