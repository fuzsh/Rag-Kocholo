        "text": "I've been a metalhead since I was about 10 years old and fell head over heels for groups like KoRn, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot... and of course - Deftones. My tastes over the years have expanded as I exposed myself to, and grew to appreciate, various subgenres from Death to Thrash to Black to Doom and Grind, etc.\n\nWhile my interest in other genres of music has come and gone, metal has always managed to keep things exciting after nearly two decades later of being a fan of the genre. There are still bands out there who somehow manage to bring something new to the table by combining the genre and new and interesting ways.\n\nWith metal declining in popularity alongside rock in favor of rap and pop music, it's important to note the bands who introduce new life into the genre. For me, these bands are leading the way to what the future of the genre will be.\n\nThese four bands in particular are the ones I catch myself listening to most...\n\n1. Rolo Tomassi\n\nFar and away one of the most unique groups I have ever heard is Rolo Tomassi. The genre-blending fusion of this band's sonic onslaught has only gotten more intense and intricate with each release and they've recently put out one of the most greatest albums I've ever heard with 2018's Time Will Die and Love Will Bury It. Rolo Tomassi is a group which shifts effortlessly between styles and has created a presentation all their own somewhere between Eva Spence's raspy black metal shrieks and calming singing as they harmonize alongside the bands unique combination of mathcore riffs, jazzy drumming, blast beats, and clever usage of synth. I love this band like no other, and only wish they'd come tour the United States one day so I can finally catch them live.\n\n2. Deafheaven\n\nPioneers of the blackgaze movement, Deafheaven proudly picked up where Alcest left off and arguably did their sound better than Alcest ever had. California has been home to a stellar black metal scene for a long while now, but it wasn't until those groups began to encorporate shoegaze and post rock into their sound that people really started to take notice. Deafheaven also gives me hope by not only throwing one of the most electric live shows I've ever attended, but by also the diverse crowds who show up to these sets. You'll see everyone from the purest of metalheads rocking NAILS back patches to kids in Tera Melos tees and chicks in Siouxsie and the Banshees DIY dresses. Deafheaven speaks on behalf of everyone \"alternative\" and they do one hell of a job at it. Never maintaining the same sound between albums, the band never fails to surprise me ever since blowing me completely out of the water when they dropped Sunbather in 2013.\n\n3. Power Trip\n\nIt's difficult to hold a conversation about modern metal without bringing up Power Trip. These guys have street cred with purists from all walks of the fandom from the true kvlt purists to the aging headbangers of thrash's golden days. While I've heard some argue that Power Trip plays things too safe by wearing their influences on their sleeves - I can't help but argue that they take the great bands before them from Pantera, to Discharge, to Exodus - and flip their thrashy sound in a way which manages to feel modern with the infestuous hooks anyone would be proud to pump their fist and bang their head to. Power Trip pack a raw authenticity which is hard to ignore. While not being overly complex, they don't need to be. These guys fucking shred and make the crowd jump - that's what matters most. I only hope their fan base continues to grow and these guys are one day considered among the all-time greats. They deserve it.\n\n4. Revocation\n\nI've said it before, and I'll say it again: David Davidson is a guitar god. His ability to shred as hard on his 7 string as he does on top of pulling off full vocal duties for Revocation is nothing short of amazing. Revocation's Outer Ones from 2018 stands the test of time as one of my favorite death metal releases ever, and it never fails to pump me up on a long drive home to or from work. Not enough attention is paid to these guys and their intricate song stylings. It takes a lot of talent to be noticed in their genre of choice, and somehow Revocation stands taller than their peers with their own special blend of technical riffs and complex beats which only serve to complement Davidson's top tier guttural growls. Top tier band right here who gets better with every release. The fact that they don't take themselves too seriously helps loads as well. I can't wait to hear what they put out next.\n\nSooo.. Metal-Era - who excites you most? I'm always on the hunt for something new!"
