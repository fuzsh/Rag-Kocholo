        "text": "Sheffield quintet Rolo Tomassi have come a long way since their DIY beginnings in 2005. Cosmology was recorded in Los Angeles, produced by Diplo and mastered by Howie Weinberg (Nirvana, Faith No More, Smashing Pumpkins). Their first demo was recorded in a shed. No surprise, then, that this time around the band aimed for a more accomplished, complete sound.\n\nWhile Cosmology is certainly less jazzy and fractured that its predecessor Hysterics, it somehow comes off sounding like it owes more to the likes of Dillinger Escape Plan than anything you might have expected Diplo to bring to the table. There are less unexpected changes and disjointed transitions and on the whole the experience is a smoother one, with a few tracks merging into each other. This ultimately leads to the band throwing its metal, hardcore punk and jazz influences into the blender to create more cohesive sections, rather than fencing their influences off from each other.\n\nThat is certainly not to say this album lacks edge or intrigue. The growling intensity of Eva Spence' vocal style is still unnerving and sometimes makes the leap to outright frightening, dominating the mix with its gravelly tone. This is no more apparent than on the opening trio of tracks, which fly by in a four-minute flurry. Intro 'Katzenklavier' gives way to 'Agamemnon', a frantic punk hybrid behemoth that playfully switches up time signatures and rhythms. 'House House Casanova' is equally brutal and clocks in at just over one minute, about long enough for you to recover from its grinding one chord beginning.\n\nOn the flip side of this are more subdued tracks such as 'Kasia', which is reined in by creepy 8-bit keyboard lines and more melodic vocals, before rising to a synth-driven climax. Meanwhile, 'Unromance' borrows heavily from the symphonic guitar arrangements of Amputechture-era Mars Volta tracks like 'Viscera Eyes', injected with the trademark Tomassi thrash, of course.\n\nThe album gathers in pace and scope as it progresses, concluding with the eight-minute title track. Opening with a wavy, psychedelic guitar line, 'Cosmology' stands out as a good example of how the band haven't given up on exploring new combinations of sounds. It is probably the closest thing to a ballad they have ever written, bolstered by an unexpected, blissful rock out that places it well in to post rock territory."
