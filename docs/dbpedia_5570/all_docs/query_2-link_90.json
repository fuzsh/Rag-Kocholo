        "text": "Rolo Tomassi have announced their new album Where Myth Becomes Memory, due for release on 4th February 2022 via MNRK.\n\n“This is a really important album for all of us,” explains keys/vocalist James Spence. “Of anything we’ve done, it’s the one I’m most proud of. I think it’s the most ambitious and creative that our band has ever sounded and something that we’ve all needed to get through the last few years. We can’t wait to share it and to have you help us bring it to life.”\n\nThe band have also released a video for their brand new single Drip.\n\n“When we start the writing process for each record, we always wait for the first song that clicks,” adds guitarist Chris Cayford. “It feels similar to our music but is also intangibly different to the extent we know it’s the next step and we need to build the album around it. This was the song that did that.”\n\nWhere Myth Becomes Memory is available to pre-order HERE.\n\nSee Rolo Tomassi and Pupil Slicer at one of the following dates:\n\nFebruary 2022\n\nThu 10th – ANTWERP, BE – Trix\n\nFri 11th – PARIS, FR – Péniche Antipode\n\nSat 12th – HAARLEM, NL – Complexity Festival\n\nMon 14th – BERLIN, DE – Cassiopeia\n\nTue 15th – PRAGUE, CZ – Strahov 007\n\nWed 16th – BUDAPEST, HU – A38\n\nThu 17th – VIENNA, AT – Arena\n\nFri 18th – MUNICH, DE – Feierwerk\n\nSat 19th – COLOGNE, DE – MTC\n\nMon 21st – NOTTINGHAM, UK – Rescue Rooms\n\nTue 22nd – MANCHESTER, UK – Club Academy\n\nWed 23rd – BRISTOL, UK – Fleece\n\nThu 24th – LONDON, UK – Oval Space\n\nTickets are on sale HERE."
