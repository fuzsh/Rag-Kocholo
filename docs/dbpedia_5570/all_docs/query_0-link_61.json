        "text": "Ay, slime writhers. We hope you’re all well. It’s been about a month since our last podcast episode. Though we broke our promise on keeping the episode output to a new one every three weeks, I was in the middle of a home move, which made it difficult to find time to slice this episode’s audio up. Fortunately, we already have another episode recorded (and a new one that will be recorded in the next week or so), so anticipate our schedule to resume unabated.\n\nWith that out of the way, this iteration is chock-full of debuts. Be it EPs or full albums, we cover an extensive array of tones, from stomping and melodic metalcore to unhinged, brutal “free jazz”. Black metal is abundant and diverse, reaching corners that harbor circus music, creeping atmospheres, and soul. The death metal here is spacey, excoriating, and abhorrent. We also noticed that many artists featured on this one synthesize a smattering of genres together, which inadvertently catapulted our word slop into echelons unfathomable. You can find all of the artists we chat about, in roughly chronological order, in the list down below."
