With three critically applauded full-lengths now behind them, many events have transpired for the UK quintet since their last trip down under. We’ll let vocalist/keyboardist James Spence take it from here…\n\n“As far as we’re concerned, it’s been long overdue that we return to Australia and we’re delighted to have the opportunity to come back and play a more extensive tour following the trips we made across in 2010. Since we were last over, we’ve had two new members join the band and released a new record called ‘Astraea’. We can’t wait to play this new set of songs for you and to show our new guys Nathan and Chris that Australia is one of the best countries to play shows in in the world.”\n\nThey’ll have a couple of native guests to warm up this run of intimate shows…\n\nBringing their own brand of polyrhythmic, noise-riddled insanity to the table is Wollongong steeds TOTALLY UNICORN. Their reputation for maniacal and unpredictable live shows has been well and truly cemented through the band’s relentless touring of the last few years. Get horny!\n\nMelbourne lads STOCKADES are set to prove themselves on what will be their third and most extensive national tour yet. Playing a hyper-technical style of melodic, epic, and unusual post-hardcore, the band brings together disparate elements in a pained but truly beautiful fashion.”"
