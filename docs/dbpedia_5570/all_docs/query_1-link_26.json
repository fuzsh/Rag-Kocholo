        "text": "Lover of music, not genres. Non ashamedly a fan of plenty of Pop acts and a couple normie metal bands like A7X. Them, BTBAM, and Dream Theater are basically his 3 most important bands in my formative years of music taste. He is the drummer and singer for local band Astronauta. Currently studying Economics in hopes of escaping Argentina. Also a former osu! tryhard, Bojack Horseman/How I met your mother/Seinfeld fan.\n\nWhen not reviewing Jonah is a vocalist, and a vocalist for the progressive metal band Empire Bathtub. Outside of the musical world he also loves Dungeons & Dragons, videogames, sci-fi and fantasy films and shows, and his beautiful wife.\n\nHusband, father of two, huge prog fan, and huge movie buff (especially horror). Always up for talking about music and movies.\n\nHe likes to explore new music, play video games, fish, and watch anime, he’s also trying to get buff too.\n\nA man of many half talents. Currently sitting on multiple unreleased indie-folk projects that are 100% definitely going to come out someday. His introduction to prog was through a combination of discovering Rush in middle school and his dad already being a prog fan. Due to this late discovery, however, he has been left with an absolute mess of a music taste as seen in the “Favorite Bands” section. Outside of music, he tends to enjoy video games, horror movies, and a few TV shows as well as spending time with his girlfriend.\n\nMan with far too many side projects for his own good. Ask him about his band, or his novel, or his game, or his other game (can’t get those mixed up now). In his spare time, he can be commonly found running through yet another playthrough of Fallout: New Vegas.\n\nA neurotic white man from the UK trapped inside the body of an identical neurotic white man from the UK. Spends much of his time uprooting himself and living in different countries. While doing this, enjoys listening to a variety of music ranging from death metal to smooth jazz. When not disappearing into an album, can be found watching old movies, reading something strange, playing games of all sorts or writing his own Dark Heresy campaigns. Writes biographies in the third person.\n\nDan discovered the seminal melodic death metal masterpiece Heartwork by Carcass at the tender young age of 13 and has never looked back. Constantly seeking the most boundary-pushing music out there, his listening habits cover astounding ground, but not much really sticks long-term. He creates music of his own as ISA (alongside several anonymous projects) and dreams of retirement so he can be free of the soul sucking tech startup machine that keeps him from spending long days in the woods and long nights with his DAW.\n\nWannabe audiophile that spends his money on headphones, records, plants, and steam games he’ll inevitably never play. British, but moved to Norway to follow his newfound love of black metal and also girlfriend. Gateway to progressive metal attributed to Danny Carey at the 2:50 mark of “Ænema”, the rest is history.\n\nCertified progressive/metal surface skimmer. I am a student of linguistics and cognitive science and a prospective lawyer. When not studying or listening to the 10 most popular bands in prog, I like sci-fi TV and movies (think Star Trek nerd). I am also a fitness fanatic who obsessively counts calories (whenever the gyms are open). Lastly, I am horrible at guitar.\n\nExactly two of the following statements about Tim are true:\n\nTim…\n\n…made it his lifelong quest to find gems in whatever genre he can find and has thus far only failed in punk and speedcore.\n\n…is a certified tornado connaisseur.\n\n…invented the light bulb in 1878.\n\n..is. childish whenever he can be and tries to be an adult when needed.\n\n…doesn’t mind easy-listening music, especially soulless commercial crap.\n\nFurthermore, Tim is an electronic musician, a hardcore gamer, a not so hardcore streamer, a tabletop roleplayer, a dadaist zealot, and a terrible student with a lot of passion for history (or: learning from other people’s mistakes).\n\nAside from working on music, plays various CCGs – especially dead 90s ones. Main ones currently are Vampire: The Eternal Struggle and Mythgard.\n\nMusic gear putz and husband of one, this straight edge city slicker is still riding the high of his band’s first release two years ago. Other hobbies include: Throwing money at expensive records, tattoos and tattoo culture, games that take too long to play. I don’t stream music, but just assume I am always listening to Welcome to the Black Parade.\n\nEngineering student, cyclist, gamer, and all-around-nerd from California. When not writing reviews for the blog, Andrew is probably riding his bike or staring at unreadable code.\n\nWhile Andrew doesn’t directly write for the Prog Subway often, he does handle all of the social media posts for the blog. A lover of primarily modern prog rock, Andrew spends his days wrestling with the desire to check out new prog bands, while also wanting to chill out to some psych rock or indie rock. While not a musician, he does love to spend time honing his singing abilities, even if his three dogs don’t tend to appreciate his “art.”\n\nOur fellow trash-talker all the way from the country-shaped pub that is Ireland. When not seen with headphones on and a confused, furrowed brow; Mark will usually be found eating, wrestling his dog, following walkthroughs for old video games, or writing unplayable riffs in Guitar Pro."
