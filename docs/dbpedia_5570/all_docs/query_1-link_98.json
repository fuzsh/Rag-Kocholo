        "text": "Filtering by Tag: music\n\n68: Chris Lee-Rodriguez (Really From & I Kill Giants) & the Pedagogy of Nostalgia\n\nWELCOME TO THE EDUPUNX PODCAST\n\nChris Lee-Rodriguez is a brilliant musician, educator, and all-around good person. Chris is the guitarist and vocalist for the Boston-based jazzy emo band, Really From, and previously lead the math punk act, I Kill Giants. Chris recently released his first solo project with an EP called, “It Could Happen,” which he self-released on May 3. You will hear a number of these tracks throughout the episode!\n\nChris teaches young people how to play guitars and a number of other instruments - an experience that he reflects on in detail in this episode. This conversation also covers a lot of arenas of interest to our listeners including how Hurricane Maria impacted him and his family in Puerto Rico, to his disgust for capitalism and Shark Tank (to my chagrin), as well as Chris’ three pieces of being a good person.\n\nThis episode was recorded in a practice space - where other bands were practicing, so you may hear random bouts of song in the background here and there.\n\nMUSIC NOTE:\n\n- This week you got to hear tunes from the Chris Lee-Rodriguez’s debut release, “It Could Happen,” which he self-released on May 3.\n\n- Chris’s solo sound takes on a number of the styles he’s presented throughout his various projects over the years - including expanding into more of his classical Spanish guitar stylings that compliment the more chaotic moments of the album.\n\n- On this episode, you got to hear the tracks, “Written by the Golden Gate Bridge,” “Dream Song,” and “Hurricane is a Taino word.” You can check out the album through the Chris’s Bandcamp page, and through all of the streaming platforms!\n\nTHE CONNECTEDU NETWORK\n\n- This week, you got to learn about the ConnectEDU Network, of which this podcast is now a contributing member!\n\n- ConnectEDU Network connects the unique perspectives and expert insight of higher education through podcasting.

Kevin is a multi-talented musician who has been on a wild musical journey to get to where he is today. Starting out playing in a Christian metalcore band, Exiting the Fall, Kevin eventually veered into more chill outlets as his interests in music evolved. Eventually those efforts would become the Salem, MA-based band, Valleyheart.\n\nDuring this conversation, Kevin and I dig into his spiritual roots and how they have influenced, defined, and evolved during his life and musical ventures. The conversation also features a bit about the realities of booking DIY tours - playing not only in basements, but in restaurants and boxing rings as well. There’s also a great meditation or two on the influence Sufjan Stevens has had on both my life and Kevin’s life.\n\nThis is a fun and thoughtful conversation that I know you will love. AND you get to hear some beautiful music throughout. Valleyheart will be on tour with My Epic this month and into June. The band will embark on a summer run of dates with Red Jumpsuit Apparatus - you can check out their tour dates here!\n\nMUSIC NOTE:\n\n- This week you got to hear tunes from the debut Valleyheart album, “Everyone I’ve Ever Loved,” which was released on December 14 through Rise Records.\n\n- Valleyheart is a brilliant rock band the presents each song with expertly layered lush atmospheres and soundscapes while retaining a perfect amount of raw emotion. Fans of From Indian Lakes, Manchester Orchestra, and Copeland will love these guys.\n\n- On this episode, you got to hear the tracks, “Agnosia,” “Friends in the Foyer,” and “Fourth of July,” which is a cover of the brilliant Sufjan Stevens song. You can check out the album through the band’s Bandcamp page, and through all of the streaming platforms!\n\nTHE CONNECTEDU NETWORK\n\n- This week, you got to learn about the ConnectEDU Network, of which this podcast is now a contributing member!\n\n- ConnectEDU Network connects the unique perspectives and expert insight of higher education through podcasting.

Dylan grew up playing baseball and was even a collegiate pitcher - which gave him a fascinating look into the college experience from the standpoint of a student athlete. Dylan and I broke down the lack of self-care that exists for a majority of student athletes, and how Dylan eventually developed his own path through education and even the punk rock realm.\n\nDylan and I sat down in my kitchen after a hefty Red Robin meal and got right down to business. The conversation often meanders through various life experiences - including exploring education options and opportunities throughout college while eventually finding worth in making music. And then there’s a slight detour into a cheesecake taste test (not brought to you by Cheesecake Factory)!\n\nSpanish Love Songs is on the rise right now and the band is doing some really great stuff, so make sure to check them out beyond this interview! Enjoy!\n\nMUSIC NOTE:\n\n- This week we shared tunes from the new Spanish Love Songs album, “Schmaltz,” which came out in March through A-F Records!

Liuzzo is also a music teacher, mentor, and purveyor of musical instruments. This conversation centers on the lessons learned while educating the generation of musicians, while also discussing ways to make scenes more inclusive to femme musicians and how to get men to take up less space and listen.

The group began in 2004 as a coalition of community and faith groups, dedicated to stepping up efforts to stop the deaths of migrants in the desert and to achieving the enactment of a set of Faith-Based Principles for Immigration Reform.\n\n- The group is utilizing volunteers who hike through the desert trails and leave water, food, socks, blankets, and other supplies. Under the direction of our medical team, volunteers provide emergency first-aid treatment to individuals in distress.\n\n- Finally, No More Deaths is currently working on legal defense projects for folks migrating into America, while also documenting the abuse and human rights violations that occur while being detained by US Border Patrol.\n\n- Please consider donating (either money, supplies, or time) to No More Deaths - No Mas Muertes today!\n\nMUSIC NOTES:\n\n- This week we shared tunes from the new Lilith single, \"I'll Come Over // In Real Life,\" which came out on June 1 through Disposable America.\n\n- Lilith is a Boston-based pop n rock band\n\n- The cassingle is currently available FOR DOWNLOAD on their bandcamp site, so you have no reason to not download this album right now!

And it just so happens that Josh, the bassist and vocalist of the band, initially went to college to be a teacher and was planning to continue into the field until the Great Recession of 2008 derailed those plans. Even though he watched his educator friends drop out of the field, he realized that he had other options - like music!\n\nThe band recently released a new LP, \"Waiting,\" through our friends at 6131 Records and it truly kicks some major ass. Fans of Dinosaur Jr., Basement, Fiddlehead, and Fugazi may dig the hell out of this album.\n\nWe also dig into how weird genre classifications work, as well as claiming straight edge after getting sober, the art of piano tuning, teaching little kids how to play guitar, and a bunch about random movies. The episode was recorded at Cafe Maddies in Quincy, Mass - so there is some noise and chatter in the background.\n\nADVERTISING NOTES:\n\n- This was a rough week for me and a few others, so I wanted to hype the National Suicide Prevention lifeline.

And during that time, we have had so many fascinating conversations with a bunch of awesome people. One thing that has been only merely touched on is information about me (Craig) - so Katy had the great idea of the two of us sitting down to chat about my exposures to the worlds of education and punk and the podcast. Truly breaking down the edu, the PUNX, and the podcast!\n\nWe dig into how I grew up as a first-generation college student who loved school, and developed into punk kid who challenged authority at every turn, adapting DIY ethics, and eventually starting a podcast that connects people with those things in common as well. While there have been many pieces of my life strung together throughout the episodes of this podcast, here's a true chance to learn a bit more about me, the guy behind the podcast!\n\nMUSIC NOTES:\n\n- This week we shared tunes from the new Retirement Party album, \"Somewhat Literate,\" which was released on May 25 through Counter Intuitive Records.\n\n- We shared the songs, \"Scene 48,\" \"Grand Am,\" and \"Truck Stop Casino.\"\n\n- The album is currently available FOR FREE DOWNLOAD on their bandcamp site, so you have no reason to not download this album right now!\n\n- And hey, if physical music is your deal, you can snag the vinyl pressing or a CD from the folks at Counter Intuitive Records, like we did over the weekend!\n\nAs always, you can CHECK OUT THE NEW SPOTIFY PLAYLIST!\n\nADVERTISING NOTES:\n\n- This was a rough week for me and a few others, so I wanted to hype the National Suicide Prevention lifeline.

This week, we welcome our friend and the owner of Limited to One, Kristian Sorge, to the podcast! Kristian opened Limited to One just under a year ago and has already caught on as one of the must-visit record stores in the world, due to its focus on carrying very limited pressings of rare and hard-to-find records. We dig into a lot of our favorite record stores, how we like things organized, and some of the things we don't like in record stores!

Jaclyn O'Connell is back with me this month - and we're joined by Lesley University senior, Kaera Wyse, who books gigs, attends gigs, and loves encouraging people to get to the gig. Kaera also has a knack for intentionally booking diverse lineups with the expressed intent to create better representation in the DIY scene. We dig into how to construct bills, what our ideal bills look like, and whether it's okay to show up to a gig late, or to leave early. There's a lot to cover in this one and we really dig into it. Hope you enjoy!\n\nMUSIC NOTES:\n\nThis episode featured a bunch of new tunes!\n\nHere's a full list of the jams you heard this week:\n\n- \"Lay Low,\" by Fiddlehead\n\n- \"Somewhere a Judge,\" Hop Along\n\n- \"Cubic Zirconia,\" No Thank You\n\n- \"Hollow Body,\" Many Rooms\n\n- \"Capture the Flag,\" War on Women\n\n- \"Rituals,\" Rolo Tomassi\n\n- \"Regan,\" Tuxis Giant\n\n- \"Symmetry,\" Wye Oak\n\n- \"Buffalo Buffalo,\" Spanish Love Songs\n\nAs always, you can CHECK OUT THE SPOTIFY PLAYLIST!\n\nMake sure you follow Jaclyn's project over at inbetweenspins.com - and follow on Twitter and Instagram to check out all of the goodies she's gonna share with the world!

Shawna is an activist for human rights, social justice, and gender equity - and is the founder of the Baltimore chapter of Hollaback, which is an initiative to combat street harassment. Shawna has also been facilitating workshops on sexual assault prevention - which she hopes to bring to college campuses, along with the bands' performances.\n\nWe spoke with Shawna about the creation of the new War on Women album, the state of politics, and whether the #MeToo movement is actually going to make a difference in the conversation and prevention of sexual assault moving forward. This conversation is also important because we address how to call-in folks when there are disagreements and learning opportunities as allies and how we can all stand to be a little more patient with each other.\n\nMUSIC NOTES:\n\n- This week, we played tunes from the new War on Women album, \"Capture the Flag,\" which is out this Friday on Bridge 9 records!\n\n- We played the songs, \"YDTMHTL,\" which features vocals from Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill, Le Tigre, and Julie Ruin, as well as the song, \"Lone Wolves.\"\n\n- If you like what you heard, make sure you visit Bridge 9 Records and snag yourself a vinyl copy, a CD, or a digital copy of the album - you will want to have this in your ears as we move forward with the resistance in 2018!\n\nAs always, you can CHECK OUT THE SPOTIFY PLAYLIST!\n\nADVERTISING NOTES:\n\n- Make sure you follow Jaclyn's project over at inbetweenspins.com - we just posted a new episode of the podcast element of the project, so give that a listen!\n\n- Follow In Between Spins on Twitter and Instagram to check out all of the goodies she's gonna share with the world!

The talk is called, \"Survival Ain't Pretty,\" and it's a talk that I've delivered a few times now, and I love doing it because it allows me to include my music and my poetry throughout the talk of me describing my life as someone who has lived with, survived, and struggled with ADHD, addiction, and mental illness.\n\nThere is a lot covered in this talk, and I know it might feel like a lot to take in, but after having done this podcast for over 9 months now, I felt it was time to truly let folks in on who I am as a person, especially at such a pivotal moment in my life and my exploration of mental health support services. Being vulnerable like this isn't easy, but it's something I've become quite accustom to over the years.\n\nIf you like this talk that I deliver, please feel free to reach out with your thoughts, and if you'd like to book me to speak on your campus - please use my website (visit my Public Speaking page) or email me at CraigBidiman@gmail.com. I also cover the topics of sexual health, sexual assault prevention/consent, and leadership/authenticity.\n\nAnd if you're interested in seeing some video from this talk, here is a link to me performing, \"Sit Still.\"\n\nReminder: This episode was bumped up due to technical difficulties with this week's In Between Spins episode, which will post this weekend, so stay tuned!\n\nMUSIC NOTES:\n\n- You get to hear tunes from my EP, \"Farewell,\" as well as live recordings of me performing the song, \"Taking its Toll,\" from my 2013 EP, \"With Foreign Lips and Strange Tongues,\" AND a new song that's yet to be officially released, \"Full of Fear.\"\n\n- I also perform two spoken word pieces on this episode - one is called, \"Bastard Son,\" and is also on the \"Farewell\" EP, the other is a brand new piece called, \"Sit Still.\"\n\n- If you like what you heard, please visit anotherpoormusician.bandcamp.com!\n\n- Don't forget!

This conversation is full of advocating for mental health support and community building, we both share out personal experiences with mental illness and survival - and share a number of ideas for how you can find support and help your friends as well.\n\nMUSIC NOTES:\n\n- This week you heard tunes from the new self-titled album from Honey and Salt, which is due out on Spartan Records on April 6!\n\n- Spartan Records is offering 20% off you next purchase through their webstore at SpartanRecords.com - just enter the promo code: EDUPUNX at checkout and it'll be added to your order!\n\n- I played the songs, \"A Nihilist Takes up Knitting,\" and \"Simple Errors\" during this episode, and if you liked what you heard from Honey and Saly, definitely check out the album when it drops in a couple weeks!\n\nAs always, you can CHECK OUT THE NEW SPOTIFY PLAYLIST!\n\nADVERTISING NOTES:\n\n- This week we featured Punk Talks, which just celebrated its third year of existence, and in that time, it has toured around the country to spread its message while gaining the support of bands and industry professionals in the community for the positive impact it has had on mental health awareness in emo, punk, and DIY.\n\n- It has been endorsed and supported by bands such as Modern Baseball, Turnover, You Blew It, Free Throw, Somos, Spraynard, Dikembe, and many others.\n\n- Make sure to visit PunkTalks.org for more information!\n\n- You don't have to be sad to make great music.\n\n- I also plugged the Art of Survival, my nonprofit that makes pieces of art for trauma survivors.

He's also the owner of Table-Turned, which is a vinyl subscription service that allows folks to pick a genre of their choice, and each month they receive a new record in the mail! Dane has a huge heart for music and for his students, which you get to hear throughout this episode, which is full of stories and insight to his busy life - balancing full-time work as an educator, father, husband, and record label owner/vinyl subscription owner.\n\nDane and I sort of feel like kindred spirits at times throughout the conversation, as our ethics and interests align very well - so well that this conversation could have easily ran double in length. We get into what it's like being an ultra authentic educator and what that looks like in terms of being an accessible resource for our students, and how we bring a lot of ourselves into our work. And how when we get home, we take out the remaining energy we have on our creative efforts.\n\nMUSIC NOTES:\n\n- This week, I featured tunes from the new Man Mountain album, \"Infinity Mirror,\" which comes out THIS FRIDAY through Spartan Records. Man Mountain is a fantastic post rock instrumental band from Detroit, and I've been looking forward to a full-length from them for a while now!\n\n- You got to hear the song, \"Memory Trace,\" which is off the new album, and if you like what you heard, head over to Spartan Records right now and snag yourself a digital copy, a CD, or one of the few remaining vinyl copies they have left!\n\n- I also played bits of the song, \"Lucerna,\" throughout the episode, which is the second track on the band's 3-track EP, \"To Call Each Thing By Its Right Name,\" which came out in 2013.\n\nAs always, you can CHECK OUT THE NEW SPOTIFY PLAYLIST!\n\nADVERTISING NOTE:\n\n- This week we hyped Dane's vinyl subscription service, Table Turned!\n\n- Table-Turned is a DIY record-of-the-month club.

It's also apropos because of the lyric, \"Marathon runner, my ankles are sprained.\"\n\nAgain, if you're interested in snagging her first album, visit 6131 Records to pick up a copy of it!

And long before she was selling out theatres all over the world, and opening for the likes of Iron and Wine, Jason Isbell, and Paramore, she was gigging in basements, VFW halls, and living rooms. Julien's DIY roots are one of the main reasons I wanted to chat with her.\n\nThis is an expansive chat that covers a variety of topics from mental health to recovery, to the political landscape and the education system. Julien is one of the most brilliant young minds in the world today, so it was incredibly fun to pick her brain in such a relaxed and genuine manner.\n\nMUSIC NOTES:\n\n- You get to hear tunes from Julien's new album, \"Turn Out the Lights,\" which was released in October through Matador Records. You can still snag physical copies through their store!\n\n- I share snippets of her songs, \"Hurt Less,\" \"Turn Out the Lights,\" and \"Appointments.\"\n\n- During Jaclyn's ad, you also get to hear some of Julien's song, \"Brittle Boned,\" from her debut LP, \"Sprained Ankle,\" the roots of which is chronicled in this conversation.

Foreclosure is an emotionally dense album. Throughout our conversation, Michi and I get into how channeling very personal source material can make for a very cathartic experience - especially when being present in the moments of which you're channeling.\n\nWe also dig into Michi's work as a music therapist, where she understandably gets to nerd out a bit about how music impacts the brain - spoiler: it all comes down to rhythm - and how music can literally help people heal from traumatic injury. It's truly one of the most educational and informative conversations I've had on this podcast, and I'm sure you will love the hell out of it.\n\nHere's a great Boston Globe article about the power of Michi's music therapy work.\n\nMUSIC NOTE:\n\n- You get to hear a bunch of tunes from the new Nature Shots LP, \"Foreclosure,\" on this episode!\n\n- You hear the tunes, \"three,\" \"what is the word for when you are screaming and no one can hear?\" and \"a prayer; begging,\" throughout this episode.\n\n- If you like what you hear, check out natureshots.bandcamp.com to listen to the entire album, and reach out the Michi if you would like to snag a cassette copy for yourself!\n\nAs always, you can CHECK OUT THE NEW SPOTIFY PLAYLIST!\n\nADVERTISING NOTE:\n\n- This week we hyped the vinyl subscription service, Table Turned!\n\n- Table-Turned is a DIY record-of-the-month club.
