        "text": "Punk jazz artists list, with photos, ranked best to worst by votes. List of good punk jazz bands includes a filter so you can sort by the groupsâ€™s label and what albums they've put out. This list of the top punk jazz bands in the world includes all musicians who have released recordings that have gotten distribution, and is an up-to-date list. Punk jazz groups and artists are shown below along with any additional genres in which their music belongs. If available, you can also see information about where all punk jazz bands on this list got started. These are truly the greatest punk jazz bands of all time, since the most famous punk jazz artists ever are listed, and the order is decided by actual fans of the best punk jazz music.\n\nYou can click on the punk jazz band names to see more information about that particular notable punk jazz group. If they're near the top of the best punk jazz artist list, though, then they should have at least some information available. All the top punk jazz bands named on the list also have discographies on their pages if you click on the punk jazz band names themselves.\n\nThe list you're viewing is made up of different artists like Chad Smith and Greg Ginn. Dowvote the artists you don't like and upvote the ones you do. The order changes depending on votes. If you're not a fan of Lydia Lunch or Bill Laswell, then vote those down so that the list takes your preferences into account.\n\nAll important, significant and iconic names in punk jazz music history deserve your votes, so make sure to choose wisely. You can only vote once on this list.\n\nThe list includes all new punk jazz bands, and if there are any missing on the list, you can always add them yourself. Just make sure they aren't already on the list and check your spelling, because this is already an accurate compilation of the best examples of punk jazz, as well as a good place to start if you're asking yourself, or friends, exactly how to get into punk jazz music. Especially since the bands at the top of the list will at the very least be the best choices if you're looking for a list of good punk jazz bands with which to start out. No point in listening to them if they aren't actually good or even half-way decent punk jazz bands.\n\nThis list answers the questions \"who are the best punk jazz bands of all time?\" and \"who is the greatest punk jazz musician ever?\"\n\nIf you know enough about the genre, please vote based on the quality of the band's music instead of just voting for the most popular punk jazz bands that you might've heard of, but not really listened to closely enough to cast an informed vote.\n\nShare the list after re-ranking it to fit your opinions and making it votable to see how all your friends vote. {#nodes}"
