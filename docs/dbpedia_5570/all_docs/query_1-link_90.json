In an effort to gain a share of the social media pie, artists are rewarded for blending in, not standing out. Mick Rock helped to create the underground music scene just as much as any of the musicians he photographed. Vanessa Thorpe's recent article in the Guardian promoting Rock's archival release also touches",

        "text": "I had to read this several times and read the Guardian piece as well, this article totally misses the mark and doesn't understand what has happened since the 1970's. In the time of Mick Rock, bands were signed to labels who recorded, produced their music and distributed it. The first time I heard \"Raw Power\" was on one of the best radio stations in the US, they played a radio station only live performance of that song. Photographers worked for the labels, for the few fan magazines that were available and many freelanced.\n\nIt is easy to beat up social media, I'll get to that.\n\nToday bands record, produce and distribute their own music sans the record label. They source out artists for album cover work and seek their own photographers and videographers for their photos and videos. Individual musicians and bands have dedicated YouTube channels to show off their music. There are lots of online publications that a photographer can get experience and potentially move up to a paid position. This does not mean that the best are picked up, it just means there are opportunities.\n\nFor the last ten years I have covered metal music in the VA/DC/MD area and I can tell you that no metal band I ever heard of has ever had a viral hit of any kind as a result of the use of social media. I can point to rap and hip-hop artists who have exploded as a result of social media and the help of celebrities who paved the way for them to go viral. Social media works great for famous people. If you are not famous, your mileage may vary.\n\nAs far as being \"underground\" I can't think of a group of people who are virtually non-existent to the world than my friends who play thrash, death and black metal. The local radio stations and the music magazine pay them lip service if they notice them at all. The music isn't popular so they don't pay attention to them. That is about as \"underground\" as you can get. I think there are plenty of underground bands all over the world, but you have to find them. This means you are going to small clubs and bars with varying levels of security and may not be in the nicest part of town. I don't see too many social media influencers in the circle pit at a local or National Act show for that matter.\n\nSocial media is a favorite for photographers to beat up on because it allows people who have little to no experience or skill get published and \"liked\" by their friends. There isn't much you can do about that. Social media does allow for a level of collaboration between musicians like no other platform. My friends on a regular basis talk shop with major musicians about making music and making it \"their way\" so there are tangible benefits.\n\nDo I think social media is going to destroy underground music, no it isn't. Is social media treating photographers fairly, no it isn't. When a guy can take a fuzzy, off color photograph of a band member playing at a bar and all the friends who know nothing about photography chime in, I just sit back and laugh. When they want photos for publication, they know who to talk to.The bigger problem is the pandemic and what is going to happen to live music when venues close and performance opportunities dwindle. This is something me and my friends think about all the time."
