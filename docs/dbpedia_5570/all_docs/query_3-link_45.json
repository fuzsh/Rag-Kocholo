        "text": "It’s no exaggeration to say Rolo Tomassi’s 2018 opus, Time Will Die and Love Will Bury It, set a benchmark for all other bands to follow when trying to incorporate shoegaze and dream pop elements into heavy music. This reviewer even bought a copy on CD and played it on constant repeat for six months. Few artists can appeal to Dillinger Escape Plan and Lush fans at the same time, but the Yorkshire group could teach Deafheaven a thing or two about striding both worlds. You can see their influence on a new generation of bands from Pupil Slicer to Svalbard, but how does album number six shape up when you consider vocalist, Eva Korman (née Spence), spent the entire lockdown with her American husband in New Jersey?\n\nYou can guarantee Rolo Tomassi’s music will be experimental and bipolar, and Where Myth Becomes Memory is no exception to this pattern. Opener, ‘Almost Always’, builds from an ethereal guitar distortion and illuminates under the radiant voice of Korman like My Bloody Valentine spiked with ketamine. The band enjoy the challenge of rescuing the most jagged of melodies from the rubble of their noise, almost as if they’re chasing an exhilarating experience that will evade them. You have to admire their efforts to hide the sombre reality of their mood space, but this is what defines them. Even the dastardly heavy, ‘Cloaked’, has a glowing chorus of virgin clean vocals among the psychopathic screams. How does Korman retain her fortitude among these sorrowful lamentations?\n\nThe heavy moments on this record are colossal. ‘Mutual Pain’ is a savage outburst that ends in the caress of a bedtime lullaby, whereas the exquisite ‘Labyrinthine’ reveals the true foundations of the contemporary Rolo Tomassi sound. It took three listens, but this reviewer thinks he can identify the colour palette to their current sound. Gone are the mathcore and post-hardcore elements to be replaced by a crushing post-metal take on dream pop. If you want an equation, how about Neurosis meets Saint Etienne?\n\nOf course, nothing is adequate to describe the music of Rolo Tomassi. They’re one of those bands that can fit into at least eight genres without being a part of any. ‘Closer’ and ‘The End of Eternity’ might remind you of Pure Reason Revolution, but one wonders if this mix of distortion and overwhelming beauty is where the Smashing Pumpkins should have anchored their sound with 2000’s Machina/The Machines of God. Listen to the pathos in Korman’s voice on the last track. You’ll need a brave face to sit through this one unaffected by the regrets of yesteryear.\n\nSome of the die-hards might lament the band’s evolution away from mathcore, but there’s no need to worry about the heavier parts disappearing from their repertoire. Tracks six and seven – ‘Drip’ and ‘Prescience’ – go off in a berserk extreme metal direction just when you’re settling into the rhythm of things. The former thrives on a technical thrash riff, and the latter goes one better with a myriad of precise alt-picking rhythms. It gets to the point where you don’t even notice the genre-hopping because of the effortless coherence of the music. And why do you feel like you’re floating during the most brutal moments of this record? Few bands can achieve this sensation in their audio art.\n\nThe only thing missing from this album is an iconic song that can achieve the status of an instant classic. But that might be due to the consistency and high standard of the tracks as one experience in chronological order. Look beneath the surface and you’ll find little to criticise here.\n\nRolo Tomassi might be one of the most acclaimed bands of the last decade, but the approbation is justified. This is another emotional rollercoaster that unites the worlds of alternative rock and extreme metal in a sparkling silhouette of beauty and brutality.\n\nJVB\n\nVerdict\n\nRelease Date: 04/02/2022\n\nRecord Label: MNRK Heavy\n\nStandout tracks: Cloaked, Labyrinthine, Drip"
