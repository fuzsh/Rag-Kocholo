        "text": "Led by siblings Eva Korman and James Spence, Britain's Rolo Tomassi emerged in the late 2000s with an uncompromising sound that incorporates an eclectic blend of math-hardcore, acid jazz, and progressive punk. Taking influence from diverse artists like U.S. metallers Converge, prog rockers King Crimson, and jazz saxophonist John Coltrane, they found early success on Hassle Records with their Diplo-produced sophomore outing, Cosmology, before starting their own label to release 2012's Astraea. The album introduced a new lineup and a more streamlined sound that continued on subsequent records Grievances (2015), Time Will Die and Love Will Bury It (2018), and Where Myth Becomes Memory (2022). Naming their group after a fictional character in Curtis Hanson's neo-noir film L.A. Confidential, singer Eva Korman (n√©e Spence) and her brother, keyboardist James Spence, formed the band in Sheffield in 2005, along with guitarist Joe Nicholson, bassist Joseph Thorpe, and drummer Edward Dutton. A regular fixture on their local rock circuit, Rolo Tomassi released various self-funded EPs through the indie label Holy Roar before signing to Hassle Records in 2008. In the same year, they performed at the Download Festival, supported Gallows and Throats on their U.K. tours, and released their debut album, Hysterics. In 2010, they recorded their follow-up, Cosmology, with M.I.A. producer Diplo, collaborated with Biffy Clyro for a performance on Channel 4, and released a compilation, Eternal Youth, featuring 36 previously unreleased tracks, which saw release on their own label, Destination Moon. Both Nicholson and Thorpe departed in 2012, and were replaced by Chris Crayford (No Coast) and Nathan Fairweather (Brontide) in time for their third album, Astraea, which appeared later the same year. Following a year of touring, Rolo Tomassi began writing for their fourth studio album, 2015's Grievances, which took on an even heavier tone than previous records. It also introduced another new member, Tom Pitts, who replaced Edward Dutton on drums. After its release, the band followed a similar pattern of touring and writing for two years before heading back to the studio to record their fifth full-length. Time Will Die and Love Will Bury It saw release in 2018, this time aiming for a more optimistic and colorful approach. Three years later, the group issued the laser-focused Where Myth Becomes Memory, which skillfully straddled the line between intimate and grandiose.\n\n&copy Jon O'Brien & Liam Martin /TiVo"
