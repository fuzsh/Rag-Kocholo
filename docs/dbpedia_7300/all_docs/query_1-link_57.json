        "text": "For me, no trip to Southern California is complete without immersing myself in filmmaking history. On my first visit to Los Angeles, I tried to fit in as many studio tours as possible, just to be able to walk in the footsteps of some of my favorite stars. The tour at Warner Brothers, in particular, caught my attention as there was a tour specifically focused upon classic cinema. While they did deviate from the classics on a few occasions to show off the more modern stops on the tour that tourists usually prefer, I was all the more excited to explore the studio’s storied past and to personally see different artifacts connected to Hollywood’s Golden Age and its iconic stars. This article focuses upon the history of classic cinema and how it is highlighted in the current Warner Bros Classic Tour.\n\nUpon going through security, I waited in a lovely gathering place as several other visitors and I waited for our tour groups to assemble. The visitor’s area has a Warner-themed coffee shop in addition to a fine display that showcases they studios history and major films. Being of Polish descent, I was also excited to see the word “welcome” in many different languages upon my entrance, including a Polish translation. I thought this was a nice nod to the Warner family history, as three of the four founding Warners were born in Poland.\n\nOnce the tour group had assembled, we were led into a theater and shown a film depicting the history of the studio. The film prefacing the tour offered strong contextual information about the studio, its impact upon the industry, and its legacy today. Prior to heading out in our movie touring car, we chatted with our tour group members, received our tour badges, and toasted the studio with complimentary champagne.\n\nAs we got started on our tour, we were taken through many different sets that were grouped into themes. For example, the studio has a section that is meant to look like small-town USA, another to portray New York, others for Chicago, and so many more. Of course, since the studio is quite active, some locations were not able to be visited due to the need for “quiet on the set” and for the studio work to continue on without interruption. As a result, each tour will vary to a degree.\n\nWhile making our way through the studio, I highly enjoyed picking out the different sets and connecting them to different films I had seen over the years. It is fascinating to see how malleable the sets can be to fit the needs of a given film but certain elements of the facades remain consistent. Here are a few connections, classic and modern, that I was able to make on the tour:\n\nCasablanca (1942):\n\nEast of Eden (1955):\n\nThe Music Man (1962):\n\nLa La Land (2016):\n\nAs we visited the different sets, we learned about the different film in which they appeared. We also were able to stop inside of some of them to get a sense of how filming inside and outside of these venues worked. It was also interesting to touch some of them, as parts of the building were brick whereas others were rubbery.\n\nWhile movie soundstages may not be as thrilling for some people, I enjoy passing them and learning about which films were shot in them. Though we did not enter the soundstages, each of them was labeled with a plaque that listed some of the major productions that were housed in them.\n\nHere is the history behind the studio soundstages I passed and photographed on the tour:\n\nStage 1:\n\nStage 1 was built in 1936. Some of the films shot here include:\n\nNow, Voyager (1942)\n\nYankee Doodle Dandy (1942)\n\nPrincess O’Rourke (1943)\n\nThis is the Army (1943)\n\nMildred Pierce (1945)\n\nThe Treasure of Sierra Madre (1948)\n\nStrangers on a Train (1951)\n\nCalamity Jane (1953)\n\nA Star is Born (1954)\n\nThem! (1954)\n\nThe Lone Ranger (1956)\n\nOcean’s Eleven (1960)\n\nStage 6:\n\nStage 6 was built in 1927.

One of the tallest stages in the world, Stage 16 was raised foot by foot in 1935 to its current height of 98 feet for the Marion Davies and Clark Gable film Cain and Mabel (1936). Some of the films shot here include:\n\nGold Diggers of 1935 (1935)\n\nThe Charge of the Light Brigade (1936)\n\nThe Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (1939)\n\nSergeant York (1941)\n\nYankee Doodle Dandy (1942)\n\nThe Big Sleep (1946)\n\nThe Adventures of Don Juan (1949)\n\nThe Old Man and the Sea (1959)\n\nA Summer Place (1959)\n\nStage 20:\n\nStage 20 was constructed 1935.

Some of the films shot here include:\n\nThe Roaring Twenties (1939)\n\nThe Letter (1940)\n\nSergeant York (1941)\n\nNow, Voyager (1942)\n\nThis Is The Army (1943)\n\nWatch on the Rhine (1943)\n\nMildred Pierce (1945)\n\nThe Big Sleep (1946)\n\nJohnny Belinda (1948)\n\nCalamity Jane (1953)\n\nA Star Is Born (1954)\n\nSayonara (1957)\n\nThe Spirit of St. Louis (1957)\n\nDamn Yankees (1958)\n\nStage 25:\n\nStage 25 was constructed 1935. Some of the films shot here include:\n\nThe Charge of the Light Brigade (1936)\n\nThe Adventures of Robin Hood (1938)\n\nKnute Rockne: All American (1940)\n\nHigh Sierra (1941)\n\nKings Row (1942)\n\nNow, Voyager (1942)\n\nYankee Doodle Dandy (1942)\n\nPrincess O’Rourke (1943)\n\nAuntie Mame (1958)\n\nWhile on the tour, we also happened to pass by other buildings of interest, including Bette Davis’s dressing room and Jack Warner’s office.\n\nThe soundstages were not the only connections to classic films and performers. A particularly humbling moment on the tour included a stop at the stately World War II Memorial, honoring the various Warner Bros talents who also happened to serve in the war.\n\nAnother exciting stop on the tour included a visit to the studio prop house. Containing a vast amount of film props that are each labeled and organized carefully, it is a fascinating sight to behold.\n\nOf the many different props here, these stood out as my favorites:\n\nThe Casablanca globe used in publicity shots.\n\nA Casablanca piano.\n\nThe Maltese falcons.\n\nThe prop house continues to be active today to meet the needs of current film and television productions.\n\nAs an archivist and film historian, I am especially excited to encounter costumes and other artifacts that were crucial to the production of classic films. I think that much can be gained from studying these items in their original material form and that working with these pieces can be a moving experience. The last stop on the tour was a museum, which showcased many of these incredible pieces.\n\nThe collection included costumes from the following films:\n\nCasablanca (1942):\n\nRebel Without a Cause (1955):\n\nMy Fair Lady (1964):\n\nIn addition, the collection also profiled costumes worn by different actors and actresses aside from grouping them into one particular film.\n\nSome of the actresses featured included:\n\nElizabeth Taylor,\n\nOlivia de Havilland,\n\nJoan Crawford,\n\nand Lauren Bacall.\n\nAs for actors, some costumes worn by James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson were also displayed.\n\nAs with the prop house, this museum area also has a sizable amount of film history on display. There are a wide range of props and costume pieces here, in addition to awards that commemorate the achievements of the studio and its talents.\n\nOf course, I had a few favorite items in the collection that I was especially honored to see. Among them were:\n\nJack Warner’s phone and phone book\n\nand a microphone used on the set of the first feature-length motion picture with not only a synchronized recorded music score but also lip-synchronous singing and speech–The Jazz Singer (1927).\n\nBy the time I finished my tour, it was evening. I managed to glimpse the Warner Bros tower on my way out, all lit up for the night.\n\nOverall, I think that the Warner Bros Classic Tour is the best of the bunch for fans of classic cinema. In addition to all of the history encountered here, the guides do a fine job of connecting with their tour attendees individually and learning about which classic stars or classic films are the most interesting to them. My guide asked each one of us about this and did his best to incorporate these points of interest into the tour. For the record, I mentioned that I loved the Busby Berkeley production unit and the Gold Digger films, and the various soundstages in which Berkeley worked were pointed out to me as we passed them on the tour.\n\nI appreciate their efforts to make this tour meaningful to every attendee and highly recommend partaking in this tour offering."
