        "text": "Real World Studios is a renowned recording facility located in Box, England. Founded by musician Peter Gabriel in the late 1980s, the studio was built with the intention of creating a creative and collaborative space for artists from around the world to come together and make music.\n\nPeter Gabriel felt that traditional recording studios were often sterile and lacked the atmosphere necessary for fostering true artistic originality. Embraced in its breath-taking natural environment, Real World Studios was designed to break away from this mould and provide a unique environment that promoted experimentation and cultural exchange.\n\nReal World’s versatile recording and mixing and post-production studios are some of the best sounding and most acclaimed in the world. They house an array of the finest audio equipment ever made, operated by a dedicated team of recording, mixing and mastering engineers.\n\nOver the years, Real World Studios has hosted numerous musicians and bands, including the likes of Tom Jones, Beyoncé, Harry Styles and The 1975. The studio’s dedication to cutting-edge technology, acoustics, and global music influence has solidified its reputation as one of the premier recording facilities in the world as well as being the home to world music festival WOMAD and Real World Records. Through the creation of Real World Studios, Peter Gabriel has established a lasting legacy that continues to inspire and empower artists to push creative boundaries."
