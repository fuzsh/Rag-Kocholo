        "text": "Stay saddled up, Yellowstone fans!\n\nOn May 5, Paramount announced that the beloved neo-Western series starring Kevin Costner is coming to an end after its fifth season — however, its corresponding streamer shared exciting details regarding the Dutton family's future.\n\nThe remaining episodes of the first half of Yellowstone season 5 became available to stream on Peacock on May 25, while the second half will air in November 2024 after being pushed back one year due to the writers' strike.\n\nWhile this will mark the end of the original series,Yellowstone will live on thanks to the various spinoffs of the Taylor Sheridan-created franchise. Among the spinoffs already released include 1883 and 1923, while two new series have been ordered: a prequel called 1944 and a Michelle Pfeiffer-led series called The Madison (previously announced as 2024).\n\nThe latter was previously announced, a sequel series rumored to be a Matthew McConaughey-led spinoff. It's slated to debut on Paramount Network and Paramount+ in December (unlike the original Yellowstone series, which is available to stream exclusively on Peacock.)\n\n“Within five years, we grew Yellowstone from a hit U.S. cable show with five million viewers into a global hit franchise with over 100 million fans around the world and multiple extensions — and we’re just getting started,” said Chris McCarthy, president and CEO of Showtime and MTV Entertainment Studios, per The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nRead on to learn about every Yellowstone prequel and sequel that are to come, in addition to the ones that've already been released.\n\n1883\n\nTelling the origin story of the Dutton family featured on Yellowstone, 1883 follows their 19th-century ancestors James and Margaret Dutton as they embark on their wild journey west from Texas to Montana through the Great Plains. Lawless lands, bloody gunfights, danger, and dust (lots of it) are promised in each of its nine (and counting) episodes.\n\nA star-studded cast was corralled with Tim McGraw and Faith Hill as leads. They are joined by multi-award winners Sam Elliot and Eric Nelsen, in addition to Isabel May, LaMonica Garrett, Audie Rick, Emma Malouff, Dawn Olivieri, Marc Rissmann, Anna Fiamora, James Landry Hébert, Alex Fine, Gratiela Brancusi, Nichole Galicia, Stephanie Nur, Amanda Jaros, Noah Le Gros, and Martin Sensmeier.\n\nKeep a close eye out in the second episode because Tom Hanks makes a cameo, playing a general named George Meade in a flashback sequence. 1883 consisted of ten episodes and concluded on Feb. 27, 2022.\n\nThe first two episodes premiered in December 2021 on the Paramount Network, but the rest of the series was exclusive to its streamer, Paramount+ (unlike the entirety of Yellowstone which aired on Paramount).\n\nBut now, the full season of 1883 will air on Paramount Network beginning June 18 at 8 p.m. ET/PT. The special broadcast will include extended featurettes at the end of each episode.\n\nWhen ViacomCBS' chief programming officer teased more episodes following its finale, fans speculated whether that meant an extension of season one or if a season 2 was underway. Turns out, neither!\n\nInstead, the Yellowstone spinoff will be getting an offshoot of its own, titled Lawmen: Bass Reeves. (Still, however, there's been no explicit mention that 1883 has been confirmed for a season 2.)\n\nLawmen: Bass Reeves\n\n1883 will merge with Sheridan's previously announced limited series, Bass Reeves, to form another spinoff, titled Lawmen: Bass Reeves. (It was originally called 1883: The Bass Reeves Story, but received a title change in April.)\n\nThe upcoming show is described as an anthology series with future installments to follow other iconic lawmen who have impacted history in subsequent seasons, according to Variety.\n\nThe logline for the Bass Reeves season states it will \"bring the legendary lawman of the wild west to life. Reeves, known as the greatest frontier hero in American history, worked in the post-Reconstruction era as a federal peace officer in the Indian Territory, capturing over 3,000 of the most dangerous criminals without ever being wounded.\"\n\nIt will star two-time Emmy nominee David Oyelowo in the title role of Bass Reeves. The actor previously voiced his excitement to be a part of the series and work alongside Sheridan in an interview with Deadline, saying, \"The reality is that he is one of the best storytellers on the planet.\"\n\nHe added, \"My whole thing is that we've got to tell a story worthy of that history, but worthy of a global audience and he's one of those rare guys, and I've worked with a few of them, and he's one of those rare ones who can really do that. It's a big deal.\"\n\nOyelowo will be joined by actor Dennis Quaid, who plays Deputy U.S. Marshall Sherrill Lynn in the upcoming spinoff, which is currently in production in his home state.\n\n\"Riding horses, shooting guns. You know, making mayhem at 4 in the morning,\" Quaid joked while speaking with Fox News Digital about joining the Yellowstone universe.\n\nNo release date has been set for 1883: The Bass Reeves Story.\n\n1923\n\nHelen Mirren and Harrison Ford star in 1923 (originally titled 1932) which premiered on Dec. 8, 2022, on Paramount Network and its streamer in a special simulcast event. They play husband and wife, matriarch Cara Dutton and patriarch Jacob Dutton, respectively.\n\nThe series chronologically follows the events that unfolded in 1883 (hence its title) — which saw the Duttons make their dangerous trek to Montana. It follows the couple, along with their children, as they run the family farm in the aforementioned state while navigating the challenges of the early 20th century, which include pandemics, a historic drought, the end of Prohibition and the Great Depression.\n\nThe teaser — which dropped during the season 5 premiere of Yellowstone in November 2022 — gave a glimpse into the chaos of the time, showing multiple battles both on the ground and on horseback. The central characters get in on the action, with a shot of Mirren's Cara, injured and pointing a rifle at someone, and Ford's Jacob looking desperately to the side as he points a gun off camera.\n\nFord told reporters in December that the formation of the project is what ultimately got him hooked on the role. \"The writing and the ambition of the piece that's evident from the scope and scale of it, [drew me to the role,]\" he explained. \"And the precision of his language and dialogue, and the character.\"\n\nThe series, which also stars Marley Shelton, Jennifer Ehle, Sebastian Roché and Darren Mann, was confirmed for a second season, which will include eight episodes, Deadline reported. 1923 is available to stream exclusively on Paramount+.\n\n6666\n\nPronounced \"Four Sixes,\" 6666 details the raw and authentic perspective of a real cattle ranch — this time in West Texas, rather than Montana like depicted in Yellowstone.\n\n\"The Sixes is one of the oldest ranches in Texas, one of the oldest ranches in the country... One of the oldest functioning cattle ranches, horse training, breeding facilities in the country,\" White told Entertainment Tonight. \"I'm really excited for people to see the real, gritty, not glamorous world of real-life cattle ranching, now in modern times.\"\n\nA 6666 premiere date remains up in the air, in addition to whether or not the series will be exclusive to Paramount's streaming service. The cast has also yet to be revealed.\n\nA Matthew McConaughey-led spinoff\n\nMatthew McConaughey was reportedly in talks to star in a Yellowstone spinoff in February as Costner was considering exiting the show to focus on directing and starring in the upcoming Western film Horizon, according to Deadline.\n\nAt the time, ViacomCBS President Chris McCarthy left details in the air regarding the McConaughey rumors. However, a spokesperson for Paramount said \"Matthew McConaughey is a phenomenal talent with whom we'd love to partner.\"\n\nAs of March 28, President McCarthy confirmed in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that the rumored McConaughey-led spinoff of the popular Paramount+ series is moving forward — whether or not star Costner returns to Yellowstone.\n\nWhile McCarthy couldn't share any new details about the upcoming projects, he did tell THR that the franchise \"wouldn't be what it is today without Kevin and we hope that that stays for a long time to come.\"\n\nOn May 5, Paramount announced that its streamer has ordered another sequel in the Taylor Sheridan-created franchise; however, it didn't specify whether it would be the one with McConaughey as its lead.\n\nThough untitled, the upcoming spinoff is said to have Yellowstone in its name. It is slated to air on Paramount+, making it the first series in the franchise with Yellowstone in its name to be released on Paramount's streamer.\n\nOn Nov. 2, the Paramount Network announced that the spinoff series is tentatively titled 2024. The working title implies the sequel will be set in the present and air after the main series wraps.\n\n\"It’s expected to continue exploring the Dutton family dynasty with new characters and locations, as well as some existing characters,\" per The Hollywood Reporter.\n\n1944\n\nAnother prequel, 1944, was announced on Nov. 2, said to follow in the footsteps of 1883 and 1923. However, McCarthy said details on the series \"are scarce at the moment,\" including the title which is \"working.\"\n\nHe was sure to confirm, though, that 1944 \"will take audiences on a thrilling, new and unexpected journey with the complex and compelling storytelling that has become a hallmark of the franchise.\"\n\nThe Madison\n\nThe next installment in the ever-expanding Yellowstone universe, titled The Madison, was confirmed on Aug. 8. It was previously announced as 2024 before the name latest change.\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer will executive produce and star in The Madison, which will be a \"heartfelt study of grief and human connection following a New York City family in the Madison River valley of central Montana.\""
