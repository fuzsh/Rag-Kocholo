Kyoto Animation\n\nFounded in 1981 by the visionary couple Yoko and Hideaki Hatta, Kyoto Animation stands as a venerable institution in the world of anime production. The studio derives its name from the culturally rich Kyoto Prefecture, which it calls home.\n\nWhat truly sets this studio apart from its peers is its unique approach to production. Unlike others that rely on freelancers, it boasts a dedicated team of salaried animators who prioritize the pursuit of artistic excellence over meeting stringent production quotas.\n\nOver the years, this distinctive philosophy has given rise to a distinct and recognizable Kyoto Animation style. The studio’s portfolio includes beloved works such as”\n\nViolet Evergarden\n\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\n\nFree!\n\nClannad\n\nA Silent Voice\n\nTragically, in 2019, a devastating fire reduced the Kyoto Animation studio to ashes, claiming lives and invaluable resources.\n\nHowever, the studio’s resilient spirit has led to its remarkable resurgence, warming the hearts of fans worldwide as it continues to create exceptional anime and nurture its distinctive approach to animation.\n\n>>>Read more: Question to fans of animation, is anime a cartoon?\n\n#4. Ufotable\n\nEstablished in the year 2000 by former employees of TMS Entertainment’s Telecom Animation Film division, Ufotable may be a relatively recent addition to the anime scene, but it has already left an indelible mark.\n\nSince its inception, Ufotable has produced a series of remarkable anime titles, including “God Eater” and “Fate/Zero.” However, what truly catapulted Ufotable to stardom was its involvement with the Demon Slayer franchise.\n\nThe studio’s adaptation of “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba” from the original manga was a monumental success. This gripping series captured the hearts of viewers and became a cultural phenomenon in Japan and beyond.\n\nUfotable’s crowning achievement came with the release of “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba: The Infinity Train,” a direct sequel to the anime series.\n\nIn 2020, this film shattered box office records, becoming not only the highest-grossing Japanese film of the year but also claiming the title of the highest-grossing Japanese film of all time.\n\n#5. Studio Bones\n\nStudio Bones, founded in 1998 by industry veterans Masahiko Minami, Hiroshi Osaka, and Toshihiro Kawamoto, emerged from the roots of Sunrise Inc.\n\nThis transition was amicable, with no ill will between the two studios, as evidenced by their subsequent collaboration on the 2001 masterpiece, “Cowboy Bebop: The Movie.”\n\nThroughout its existence, Studio Bones has left an indelible mark on the world of anime, with a string of successful series under its belt.\n\nNotable productions like “Fullmetal Alchemist,” “Mob Psycho 100,” and “My Hero Academia” have earned the studio a devoted following.\n\nTragically, the studio faced a setback when co-founder Hiroshi Osaka passed away from cancer in 2007, leaving a void in the anime world. However, Studio Bones persevered and welcomed new talents, Makoto Watanabe and Takahiro Komori, to its board of directors.\n\n#6. WIT Studio\n\nWIT Studio, a subsidiary of Production I.G, maybe a newcomer in the realm of Japanese anime, but its rapid ascent has left an indelible mark.\n\nEstablished in 2012 under the guidance of Tetsuya Nakatake, WIT Studio swiftly made waves with its first major project, the anime adaptation of Hajime Isayama’s blockbuster manga, “Attack on Titan.”\n\nDebuting in 2013, “Attack on Titan” captured the imagination of viewers worldwide and garnered acclaim as one of the finest anime series ever produced.\n\nWIT Studio continued to helm two more gripping seasons before the reins were handed over to MAPPA Studios for the fourth season.\n\nBeyond the colossal success of “Attack on Titan,” WIT Studio has lent its artistic prowess to other notable projects, including:\n\nVinland Saga\n\nKabaneri of the Iron Fortress\n\nThe Ancient Magus’ Bride\n\nThe studio is esteemed for its ability to craft distinctive and captivating visual styles tailored to each unique show, solidifying its reputation as a rising star in the anime industry.\n\n#7. MAPPA\n\nFounded in 2011 by industry veteran Masao Maruyama, MAPPA Studio (short for Maruyama Animation Project Produce Association) emerged as a beacon of creative freedom in the anime world.\n\nMaruyama’s departure from Madhouse was driven by a desire to escape corporate constraints and embrace artistic liberty.\n\nMAPPA’s inaugural anime, “Kids on the Slope,” showcased their talent and set the stage for a remarkable journey. Subsequent releases which have solidified their position as a powerhouse in the industry include:\n\nYuri!! On Ice\n\nBanana Fish\n\nJujutsu Kaisen\n\nThe final season of “Attack on Titan”\n\nIronically, their success brought its own set of pressures, echoing the corporate environment Maruyama sought to escape. In 2016, he decided to pass the torch to Manabu Otsuka as CEO, allowing younger hands to lead.\n\nDespite the transition, MAPPA Studio continues to flourish, standing as a testament to its unwavering commitment to artistic expression and its enduring impact on the world of anime.\n\n#8. Sunrise\n\nFounded in 1972 by former employees of Mushi Production, Sunrise has evolved into a colossal presence within the anime industry. With over 10 sub-studios under its banner, Sunrise has achieved recognition as one of the largest anime studios in history.\n\nSunrise is synonymous with the mecha-anime genre, acclaimed for its iconic “Gundam” series and its numerous spin-offs. Yet, its versatility extends beyond mecha, as evidenced by its involvement in producing classics like “Cowboy Bebop” and “Outlaw Star.”\n\nOne distinctive aspect of Sunrise’s legacy is its role as a breeding ground for talent. Six former Sunrise employees have gone on to establish their studios, attesting to Sunrise’s knack for spotting and nurturing the industry’s brightest talents.\n\nThis phenomenon doesn’t diminish Sunrise’s stature but rather underscores its ability to cultivate and shape the future of anime. With an enduring legacy and a diverse portfolio, Sunrise remains an essential pillar of the anime world.\n\n#9. Toei Animation\n\nToei Animation is a venerable institution in the world of Japanese animation, with a history dating back to its founding in 1948 as Japan Animated Films.\n\nIn 1956, it was acquired by Toei Company and renamed Toei Doga in Japan and Toei Animation internationally. Later, in 1998, Toei Doga also officially adopted the name Toei Animation worldwide.\n\nThe studio’s illustrious legacy includes a string of iconic anime productions that have left an indelible mark on global pop culture. “Dragon Ball Z” and “Sailor Moon” are prime examples of Toei Animation’s contributions, achieving immense global success.\n\nAdditionally, Toei Animation is the creative force behind “One Piece,” one of the longest-running and most beloved anime series in history, along with its spin-off movies.\n\n#10. Trigger\n\nIn just over a decade, Studio Trigger has etched its name in the annals of anime history as a studio renowned for its distinctive style and creative flair.\n\nEstablished in 2011 by former Gainax talents Hiroyuki Imaishi and Masahiko Otsuka, Trigger wasted no time in making its mark.\n\nHiroyuki Imaishi’s previous work on Gainax’s “Gurren Lagann” showed his unique talent for blending vibrant animation with sharp visual humor, setting the tone for its signature style. The studio’s bold and eye-catching animation has become its trademark.\n\nTrigger’s breakout series, “Kill la Kill,” remains a standout in its portfolio, recognized as one of its most iconic works.\n\nThe studio has also produced gems like “Little Witch Academia” and “Space Patrol Luluco,” further solidifying its reputation for pushing the boundaries of artistic expression in anime.\n\nFor those seeking anime that oozes coolness and artistic panache, Trigger is undoubtedly the go-to studio.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we reflect on these remarkable studios, I hope this journey through the best animation studio for anime has provided insight into the rich and diverse tapestry of this art form.\n\nEach studio’s unique contributions have collectively enriched the world of anime, leaving an enduring legacy.
