A spokesman for the Central Japanese Association states: \"We teach the fundamental principles of America and the high ideals of American democracy. We want to live here in peace and harmony. Our people are 100% loyal to America.\"\n\nDecember 7, 1941\n\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor. Local authorities and the F.B.I. begin to round up the leadership of the Japanese American communities.

Most would spend the war years in enemy alien internment camps run by the Justice Department.\n\nFebruary 19, 1942\n\nPresident Roosevelt signs Executive Order 9066 which allows military authorities to exclude anyone from anywhere without trial or hearings. Though the subject of only limited interest at the time, this order set the stage for the entire forced removal and incarceration of Japanese Americans.\n\nFebruary 25, 1942\n\nThe Navy informs Japanese American residents of Terminal Island near Los Angeles Harbor that they must leave in 48 hours. They are the first group to be removed en masse.\n\nFebruary 27, 1942.\n\nIdaho Governor Chase Clark tells a congressional committee in Seattle that Japanese would be welcome in Idaho only if they were in \"concentration camps under military guard.\" Some credit Clark with the conception of what was to become a true scenario.\n\nMarch 2, 1942\n\nGen. John L. DeWitt issues Public Proclamation No. 1 which creates Military Areas Nos. 1 and 2. Military Area No. 1 includes the western portion of California, Oregon and Washington, and part of Arizona while Military Area No. 2 includes the rest of these states. The proclamation also hints that people might be excluded from Military Area No. 1.\n\nMarch 18, 1942\n\nThe president signs Executive Order 9102 establishing the War Relocation Authority (WRA) with Milton Eisenhower as director. It is allocated $5.5 million.\n\nMarch 21, 1942\n\nThe first advance groups of Japanese American \"volunteers\" arrive at Manzanar, CA.

He is shot despite the guards' knowledge of his mental state.\n\nMay 16, 1942\n\nHikoji Takeuchi, a Nisei, is shot by a guard at Manzanar. The guard claims that he shouted at Takeuchi and that Takeuchi began to run away from him. Takeuchi claims he was collecting scrap lumber and didn't hear the guard shout. His wounds indicate that he was shot in the front. Though seriously injured, he eventually recovered.\n\nMay 29, 1942\n\nLargely organized by Quaker leader Clarence E. Pickett, the National Japanese-American Student Relocation Council is formed in Philadelphia with University of Washington Dean Robert W. O'Brien as director. By war's end, 4,300 Nisei would be in college.\n\nJune 1942\n\nThe movie \"Little Tokyo, U.S.A.\" is released by Twentieth Century Fox.

Dillon Myer is appointed to replace him.\n\nJuly, 27 1942\n\nTwo Issei -- Brawley, CA farmer Toshiro Kobata and San Pedro fisherman Hirota Isomura -- are shot to death by camp guards at Lourdsburg, New Mexico enemy alien internment camp. The men had allegedly been trying to escape. It would later be reported, however, that upon their arrival to the camp, the men had been too ill to walk from the train station to the camp gate.\n\nAugust 4, 1942\n\nA routine search for contraband at the Santa Anita \"Assembly Center\" turns into a \"riot.\" Eager military personnel had become overzealous and abusive which, along with the failure of several attempts to reach the camp's internal security chief, triggers mass unrest, crowd formation, and the harassing of the searchers. Military police with tanks and machine guns quickly end the incident. The \"overzealous\" military personnel are later replaced.\n\nAugust 10, 1942 The first inmates arrive at Minidoka, Idaho.\n\nAugust 12, 1942 The first 292 inmates arrive at Heart Mountain, Wyoming.\n\nAugust 27, 1942 The first inmates arrive at Granada, or Amache, Colorado.\n\nSeptember 11, 1942 The first inmates arrive at Central Utah, or Topaz.\n\nSeptember 18, 1942 The first inmates arrive at Rohwer, Arkansas.\n\nOctober 20, 1942\n\nPresident Roosevelt calls the \"relocation centers\" \"concentration camps\" at a press conference. The WRA had consistently denied that the term \"concentration camps\" accurately described the camps.\n\nNovember 14, 1942\n\nAn attack on a man widely perceived as an informer results in the arrest of two popular inmates at Poston. This incident soon mushrooms into a mass strike.\n\nDecember 5, 1942\n\nFred Tayama is attacked and seriously injured by a group of inmates at Manzanar.

It is later determined that Wakasa had been inside the fence and facing the sentry when shot. The sentry would stand a general court-martial on April 28 at Fort Douglas, Utah and be found \"not guilty.\"\n\nApril 13, 1943\n\n\"A Jap's a Jap. There is no way to determine their loyalty... This coast is too vulnerable. No Jap should come back to this coast except on a permit from my office.\" Gereral John L. DeWitt, head, Western Defense Command; before the House Naval Affairs Subcommittee.\n\nJune 21, 1943\n\nThe United States Supreme Court rules on the Hirabayashi and Yasui cases, upholding the constitutionality of the curfew and exclusion orders.\n\nSeptember 13, 1943\n\nThe realignment of Tule Lake as a camp for \"dissenters\" begins. After the loyalty questionnaire episode, \"loyal\" internees begin to depart to other camps. Five days later, \"disloyal\" internees from other camps begin to arrive at Tule Lake.\n\nNovember 4, 1943\n\nThe Tule Lake uprising caps a month of strife. Tension had been high since the administration had fired 43 coal workers involved in a labor dispute on October 7.\n\nJanuary 14, 1944\n\nNisei eligibility for the draft is restored. The reaction to this announcement in the camps would be mixed.\n\nJanuary 26, 1944\n\nSpurred by the announcement of the draft a few days before, 300 people attend a public meeting at Heart Mountain camp. Here, the Fair Play Committee is formally organized to support draft resistance.\n\nMarch 20, 1944\n\nForty-three Japanese American soldiers are arrested for refusing to participate in combat training at Fort McClellan, Alabama, as a protest of treatment of their families in U.S. camps.

This case challenged the constitutionality of the entire exclusion process.\n\nJanuary 2, 1945\n\nRestrictions preventing resettlement on the West Coast are removed, although many exceptions continue to exist. A few carefully screened Japanese Americans had returned to the coast in late 1944.\n\nJanuary 8, 1945\n\nThe packing shed of the Doi family is burned and dynamited and shots are fired into their home. The family had been the first to return to California from Amache and the first to return to Placer County, having arrived three days earlier.

The war in the Pacific would end on August 14.\n\nMarch 20, 1946\n\nTule Lake closes, culminating \"an incrediblle mass evacuation in reverse.\" In the month prior to the closing, some 5,000 internees had to be moved, many of whom were elderly, impoverished, or mentally ill and with no place to go.\n\nJuly 15, 1946\n\nThe 442nd Regimental Combat Team is received on the White House lawn by President Truman. \"You fought not only the enemy but you fought prejudice -- and you have won,\" remarks the president.\n\nJune 30, 1947\n\nU.S. District Judge Louis E. Goodman orders that the petitioners in Wayne Collins' suit of December 13, 1945 be released; native-born American citizens could not be converted to enemy aliens and could not be imprisoned or sent to Japan on the basis of renunciation. Three hundred and two persons are finally released from Crystal City, Texas and Seabrook Farms, New Jersey on September 6, 1947.\n\nJuly 2, 1948\n\nPresident Truman signs the Japanese American Evacuation Claims Act, a measure to compensate Japanese Americans for certain economic losses attributable to their forced evacuation. Although some $28 million was to be paid out through provision of the act, it would be largely ineffective even on the limited scope in which it operated.\n\nJuly 10, 1970\n\nA resolution is announced by the Japanese American Citizen League's Northern California-Western Nevada District Council calling for reparations for the World War II incarceration of Japanese Americans. This resolution would have the JACL seek a bill in Congress awarding individual compensation on a per diem basis, tax-free.\n\nNovember 28, 1979\n\nRepresentative Mike Lowry (D-WA) introduces the World War II Japanese-American Human Rights Violations Act (H.R. 5977) into Congress. This NCJAR-sponsored bill is largely based on research done by ex-members of the Seattle JACL chapter. It proposes direct payments of $15,000 per victim plus an addtional $15 per day interned. Given the choice between this bill and the JACL-supported study commission bill introduced two months earlier, Congress opts for the latter.\n\nJuly 14, 1981\n\nThe Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) holds a public hearing in Washington, D.C. as part of its investigation into the internment of Japanese Americans during Workd War II. Similar hearings would be held in many other cities throughout the rest of 1981. The emotional testimony by more than 750 Japanese American witnesses about their wartime experiences would prove cathartic for the community and a turning point in the redress movement.\n\nJune 16, 1983\n\nThe CWRIC issues its formal recommendations to Congress concerning redress for Japanese Americans interned during World War II. They include the call for individual payments of $20,000 to each of those who spent time in the concentration camps and are still alive.\n\nAugust 10, 1988\n\nH.R. 442 is signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. It provides for individual payments of $20,000 to each surviving internee and a $1.25 billion education fund among other provisions.\n\nOctober 9, 1990\n\nThe first nine redress payments are made at a Washington, D.C. ceremony. One-hundred-seven-year-old Rev. Mamoru Eto of Los Angeles is the first to receive his check."
