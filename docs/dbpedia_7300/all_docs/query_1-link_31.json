        "text": "Biographical Note\n\nThese papers reflect the activities and history of the Hardaway family of Columbus, Georgia. These papers primarily concern Benjamin Hurt Hardaway, Senior (1866-1928), his son Benjamin Hurt Hardaway, Junior (1891-1963) and his son, Benjamin Hurt Hardaway III (1919-2017), but also include significant materials on earlier members of both the Hardaway and related families\n\nBenjamin Hurt Hardaway was one of the sons of Robert Archelaus Hardaway (1829-1899) and his wife Rebecca (Beca) Hurt Hardaway (1837-1887). This collection also relates very closely to the papers of Robert Early Hardaway (MC 256), who also descended from Robert Archelaus Hardaway. The bulk of this material, however, relates to Benjamin Hurt Hardaway III.\n\nBenjamin Hurt Hardaway III was born on September 28, 1919 in Columbus, Georgia and died there on October 29, 2017. He married Sarah McDuffie in 1945. They had four daughters.

He served as an aide-de-camp to Lt. General Manton S. Eddy. After the war, he returned to his home in Columbus and assumed his part in running the family businesses, including the Hardaway Construction Company and the local Ford dealership, as well as serving on the boards of various banks and businesses, including the Royal Crown Cola Corporation. He was also a member of the Rotary Club, the Chamber of Commerce and many sports-related organizations, including the Wildlife Legislative Fund, the Wildlife Conservation Fund, Masters of Foxhounds of America, and many others. He also supported such diverse causes as the U.S. Equestrian Team, the National Infantry Museum, and many pro-hunting and pro-trapping lobbying organizations. He was an active member of Saint Paul's Methodist Church.\n\nScope and Content\n\nThese papers document primarily the life and activities of Benjamin Hurt Hardaway III but also cover other members of his family across a wide range of interests.

Some are agendas, where social and business appointments were noted. Some are business workbooks, where the activities of the various Hardaway business were tracked, including information on bids received and offered, expenses, income, etc. Some are personal diaries that focused more on social and family activities. Some are yearly and some are monthly. There are some years that have multiple \"diaries\" where personal and business activities are kept separate, and in some years they are mixed. For the sake of convenience they are all referred to \"Diary\" in this finding aid.

They were generally left as found. In a few cases, however, materials were moved to other existing folders. Topics include: thank-you notes; holiday and birthday cards; invitations; health; the Infantry Museum; books; church activities; the documentary and book about his life (Never Been Outfoxed); newspaper and magazine articles; vacations; birthdays; hunting and anti-hunting issues. There is significant overlap with materials relating to the Midland Foxhounds, as well as some overlap with the Itineraries and Genealogy files. The correspondence reflects the extremely peripatetic nature of this generation of Hardaways, but there is a certain rhythm to their year. The year began with January's annual Masters of Foxhounds Association gala in New York City with concurrent attendance at the annual meeting of the Moles (an engineering organization), followed by the annual meeting of the Alfalfa Club in Washington, D.C. Then would follow an annual fox hunt in Virginia with a concurrent meeting of the Wildlife Legislative Fund/Wildlife Conservation Fund, usually in April, then a summer vacation in the highlands of North Carolina, grouse hunting in England in August, and in later years the Columbus Steeplechase and the Upatoi Polo Games to end the year. In between these recurring events were visits to family and friends, many hunting trips involving foxes, cats, and birds, as well as fishing trips, among many other interests.\n\nFolder 22 - General Manton S.

Lord Allendale was known as \"Wenty\". In later years of the syndicate, the arrangements were managed by Lord Allendales' son and heir, also known as \"Wenty\". Members could opt to stay either one week or for both weeks and their dues were based on the length of their stay. BHH III participated in these hunts from 1962 through 1992 and was the head of the syndicate from 1981 through 1991. These materials document the membership, dues collection, payments to Lord Allenhead and his staff, and indicates how many grouse were killed and by whom over the 30 years that the syndicate operated. Besides correspondence with members concerning dues, dates, logistics, etc., there is also extensive correspondence with Allenhead Hall staff, the Connaught Hotel and other lodgings, wine and food shops in the village of Hexham, etc. Letters signed \"Podge\" are from Patricia Blundell-Brown.\n\nFolder 1 - Membership Lists, 1961-1990\n\nFolder 2 - Membership Ledger, 1981-1991 This ledger includes the names of members, dues collected and expenses paid.\n\nFolder 3 - Bank Statements & Deposit Slips-U.S. Banks, 1981-1989 These are records of the Allenhead Syndicate with Citibank, First National Bank of Columbus and the Bank of the South.\n\nFolder 4 - Bank Statements, Deposit Slips & Correspondence-Barclays Bank, 1981-1985\n\nFolder 5 - Bank Statements, Deposit Slips & Correspondence-Barclays Bank, 1986-1990\n\nFolder 6 - Syndicate Accounts, 1981\n\nFolder 7 - Syndicate Accounts, 1982\n\nFolder 8 - Syndicate Accounts, 1983\n\nFolder 9 - Syndicate Accounts, 1984\n\nFolder 10 - Syndicate Accounts, 1985\n\nFolder 11 - Syndicate Accounts, 1987\n\nFolder 12 - Syndicate Accounts, 1988\n\nFolder 13 - Syndicate Accounts, 1989-1990\n\nFolder 14 - Correspondence, 1979-1980\n\nFolder15 - Correspondence, 1981\n\nFolder 16 - Correspondence, 1982\n\nFolder 17 - Correspondence, 1983\n\nFolder 18 - Correspondence, 1984\n\nFolder 19 - Correspondence, 1985\n\nFolder 20 - Correspondence, 1986\n\nFolder 21 - Correspondence, 1987\n\nFolder 22 - Correspondence, 1988\n\nFolder 23 - Correspondence, 1989\n\nFolder 24 - Correspondence, 1990-1992 The Allenheads syndicate was dissolved at the end of 1990 although it took some time to close out all its accounts.

Benjamin H. Hardaway, III and Dr. Jack C. Hughston were elected Joint Masters with Ben Hardaway acting as huntsman. The pack at first consisted of July hounds that Ben had since a teenager. The hunt was given considerable support by the officers at nearby Fort Benning, Georgia, who were deprived of their sport when the United States Army sold all of their horses in 1948 and the Infantry School Hunt was disbanded. The Midland Fox Hounds bought horses, saddles and pink coats from the Fort Benning dispersal. We still have the infantry blue as our hunt colors. From 1948 to the present, Midland has established hunt countries with varying terrain and hunting conditions in Georgia and Alabama. These are regularly hunted four days a week. For this incredible asset we are indebted to our gracious landowners. Ben Hardaway hunted the hounds for 45 years and gave up the horn to Mason Houghland Lampton in 1997. Since then Mason has carried on the same breeding regiment for blending the cry, nose and speed of the July foxhound with the tractability and confirmation of the English Fell foxhound. The Midland crossbred hounds have been drafted by many packs internationally as a source of the highest performance in hunting.\n\nFolder 1 - Midland Fox Hounds/Midland Riding Center-Financial Statements, 1965-1967, 1972\n\nFolder 2 - Midland Fox Hounds-Reports, Membership, etc., 1960s\n\nHorses\n\nFolder 3 - Midland Fox Hounds-Horse Show, 1968\n\nFolder 4 - Midland Fox Hounds-Horse Show, 1970\n\nFolder 5 - Midland Fox Hounds-Horse Show, 1971\n\nFolder 6 - Midland Fox Hounds-Horse Show, 1972\n\nFolder 7 - Midland Fox Hounds-Horse Show, 1973\n\nFolder 8 - Midland Fox Hounds-Horse Show, 1974\n\nFolder 9 - Midland Fox Hounds-Horse Show, 1975\n\nFolder 10 - Midland Fox Hounds-Three Day Horse Trials, 1977-1979\n\nFolder 11 - Midland Fox Hounds-Horse Show-Mailing Lists, 1970-1971 & nd\n\nFolder 12 - Midland Fox Hounds-Pony Club, 1964-1966\n\nHounds\n\nFolder 13 - Midland Fox Hounds-Hounds-Breeding and Care, 1967-2005\n\nFolder 14 - Midland Fox Hounds-Hounds-Kennel/Whipper-In, 1977-1979\n\nFolder 15 - Midland Fox Hounds-Hounds-Lurching & Coursing, 1978\n\nFolder 16 - Midland Fox Hounds-Hounds-Photographs, circa 1968\n\nFolder 17 - Midland Fox Hounds-Hounds-Puppy Show, May 19-26, 2006\n\nFolder 18 - Midland Fox Hounds-Hounds-Puppy Show, April 28-30, 2012\n\nFolder 19 - Midland Fox Hounds-Hounds-Vet Records, 1968-1977, 2001\n\nStables\n\nFolder 20 - Midland Fox Hounds-Design for new stables, 1971\n\nHunts\n\nThese folders document mainly joint hunts or races with the Midland Fox Hounds and other organizations.\n\nFolder 21 - Shamrock Stables Horse Show, 1958-1959\n\nFolder 22 - Summer Hill Farm-Point to Point Races, 1971\n\nFolder 23 - Moreland Hunt, February 1988\n\nFolder 24 - Piedmont Fox Hounds, December, 1989\n\nFolder 25 - Piedmont Fox Hounds, December 1991\n\nFolder 26 - Midland Fox Hounds-Opening Hunt Weekend, October 16-20, 2003\n\nHorses\n\nThese folders relate to three horses owned in partnership with BHH III and others.\n\nFolder 27 - Brave Actress (Bay Filly), 1973-1979\n\nFolder 28 - Fast Diplomat, 1973-1975\n\nFolder 29 - He's Trouble (Carlisle's horse), 1970-1971\n\nRadnor Hunt/Bryn Mawr Hound Show\n\nFolder 30 - May 25, 1986\n\nFolder 31 - May 24, 1987\n\nFolder 32 - June 2-3, 1988\n\nFolder 33 - June 1-3, 1989\n\nFolder 34 - May 31-June 2, 1990\n\nFolder 35 - May 28-31, 1992\n\nFolder 36 - May 27-31, 1993\n\nFolder 37 - June 2-4, 1994\n\nFolder 38 - June 1-3, 1995\n\nFolder 38 - May 31-June 2, 1997\n\nFolder 39 - June 4-6, 1999\n\nFolder 40 - May 30-June 1, 2003\n\nRolex Kentucky Three Day Event\n\nFolder 41 - May 27-June 5, 1987\n\nFolder 42 - April 27-May 2, 1988\n\nFolder 43 - April 28-30, 1989\n\nFolder 44 - April 27-30, 1990\n\nSouthern Hound Show, Monticello, Florida\n\nFolder 45 - April 6-8, 2006\n\nFolder 46 - April 4-5, 2008\n\nFolder 47 - April 16-18, 2010\n\nFolder 48 - April 8-10, 2011\n\nFolder 49 - April 4-5, 2014\n\nUnites States Equestrian Team\n\nFolder 50 - 1966-1978\n\nFolder 51 - 1979-1982\n\nFolder 52 - Seoul Olympics, 1988\n\nUnited States Pony Clubs, Inc.\n\nFolder 53 - Correspondence, 1965\n\nFolder 54 - Correspondence, 1966\n\nFolder 55 - Correspondence, 1968\n\nFolder 56 - Correspondence, 1969\n\nFolder 57 - Correspondence, 1970\n\nFolder 58 - Correspondence, 1971-1973\n\nFolder 59 - Reports, Handbooks, Etc., 1967-1970\n\nFolder 60 - Tests, 1962-1966\n\nFolder 61 - Tests, 1966-1972\n\nSeries 6 - Box 4 - Recurring Sport-Related Events and Organizations (U-W)\n\nUpatoi Polo Club\n\nFolder 1 - 2005\n\nFolder 2 - 2006\n\nFolder 3 - 2007\n\nFolder 4 - 2008\n\nFolder 5 - 2009\n\nFolder 6 - 2010\n\nFolder 7 - 2011\n\nFolder 8 - 2012\n\nVirginia Foxhound Club\n\nFolder 9 - 1986\n\nFolder 10 - 1987\n\nFolder 11 - 1988\n\nFolder 12 - 1990\n\nFolder 13 - 1991\n\nFolder 14 - 1993\n\nFolder 15 - 1995\n\nFolder 16 - 1996\n\nFolder 17 - 1997\n\nFolder 18 - 1998\n\nFolder 19 - 1998\n\nFolder 20 - 2002\n\nFolder 21 - 2003\n\nFolder 22 - 2005\n\nFolder 23 - 2006\n\nFolder 24 - 2007\n\nFolder 25 - 2008\n\nFolder 26 - 2009\n\nFolder 27 - 2010\n\nFolder 28 - 2011\n\nFolder 29 - 2012\n\nFolder 30 - 2013\n\nFolder 31 - 2014\n\nWildlife Conservation Fund of America (WCFA)AndWildlife Legislative Fund of America (WLFA)\n\nThese organizations were very interrelated and their records are filed jointly under WCFA/WLFA.
