        "text": "Elizabeth Taylor was one of the first celebrities of the 20th century whose private life threatened to eclipse her work on-screen.\n\nBetween being on studio lots since she was a child, starring in some of the biggest films of Hollywood's golden era and her seven marriages (and one remarriage) there was barely a time over Taylor's decades-long career that her life wasn't treated as tabloid fodder.\n\nIn Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes, director Nanette Burstein draws on Taylor's personal archive as well as a series of interviews that the movie star (who died in 2011) did from 1964 with the late journalist Richard Meryman.\n\nThe documentary premiered at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year, where it was nominated for The Documentary Prize.\n\nHere's what we learnt.\n\nWarning: This article discusses domestic violence and suicide.\n\nHer parents didn't want her to be an actor\n\nAlthough her star would shine the brightest in her young adulthood, Taylor started out in Hollywood early — appearing in her first film, 1942's There's One Born Every Minute, at just nine years old.\n\nIt was a step into a career that was frowned upon by her parents, art dealer Francis Lenn Taylor and stage actress Sara Sothern.\n\n\"You were not pushed into it by your parents at all?\" asks Meryman.\n\n\"Oh absolutely not, If anything they didn't want me to be an actress,\" Taylor tells Meryman.\n\n\"My father particularly, my mother was more understanding because she was an actress herself, but I was the one that pushed.\"\n\nHer first marriage was a 'horrendous mistake'\n\nTaylor's first marriage to hotel heir Nick Hilton in 1950, when he was 24 and she was just 18, was crowned Hollywood's Wedding of the Year by the press. Taylor confesses that her desire to get married had more to do with her infatuation with the concept of romantic love.\n\n\"I was not prepared to be an adult, I had been sheltered, protected and the repercussions were that I made horrendous mistakes,\" Taylor says.\n\nTaylor initially refuses to talk about her first husband in detail beyond his \"kicking me in the stomach and forcing me to have a miscarriage.\"\n\n\"The wedding was lovely, but then came disillusionment and also a couple of split lips,\" she continues.\n\n\"I had left because Nick was always in a temper … I couldn't really go back to that life of such mental and physical abuse ...\"\n\nShe knew her marriage to Mike Todd would end in tragedy\n\nTaylor's third marriage was to the \"love of her life\", Academy Award-winning producer Mike Todd, 25 years Taylor's senior and the only one of her husbands that she didn't divorce.\n\nTaylor remembers when Todd demanded a meeting with her just days after her split from second husband Michael Wilding.\n\n\"Mike charged in, we went to a deserted office, and he plunked me down, turned a chair around and started on a spiel saying that he loved me and there was no question about it we were going to be married,\" she says\n\nWhen the pair married in 1957, Taylor's matron of honour was cinema icon Debbie Reynolds who was then married to crooner Eddie Fisher, Todd's best friend.\n\n\"I always had a feeling of inadequacy as a student and as a human being, with Mike, I learned to enjoy life much more and not feel ashamed of not knowing something,\" Taylor says.\n\nSix months after the birth of their daughter Liza, Todd died unexpectedly in a plane crash.\n\n\"It was funny, I had a feeling and so did Mike all through our marriage that something was going to happen,\" Taylor says.\n\n\"It was too good to be true and when it did happen I was so unprepared. The death of the person I had put all my trust in, it was really more than I could handle.\"\n\nTwo weeks after Todd's death, Taylor was back at work filming Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.\n\nShe attempted suicide while married to Eddie Fisher\n\nReynolds recounts visiting Taylor after Todd's death to find her near catatonic, telling Fisher to stay with the young widow while Reynolds looked after Taylor's children.\n\n\"There was a trance-like thing about me after Mike's death … it seemed almost certain that I was heading to disaster and I could not stop myself,\" Taylor says.\n\nIt soon came to light that Fisher and Taylor were having an affair.\n\n\"I was keeping Mike alive while talking to Eddie. I never loved Eddie, I liked him, I felt sorry for him and I liked talking to him about Mike,\" Taylor says.\n\nIn 1959, Taylor married Fisher just three hours after his divorce from Reynolds. The backlash from the public towards Taylor was significant.\n\nFisher isolated Taylor.\n\n\"We never went out … it was like being locked up. I started to sleep 14,15 hours at once.\"\n\nTaylor confesses that at one point in the marriage, it got so much that she attempted suicide by taking a large quantity of sleeping pills.\n\n\"I did it deliberately, calmly … I was fed up with living. I would rather be dead than face another divorce,\" she says.\n\nTaylor later expresses regret over the attempt and the consequences her death would have had on her two (at the time) children.\n\nShe didn't want to be a sex symbol\n\nIn 1960, Taylor bargained for a US$1 million salary to play Cleopatra in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's historical drama, making her the first actor to ever be paid that amount for a film.\n\n\"I enjoyed dealing with the studios and I was quite the businesswoman,\" Taylor says.\n\n\"When you ask for $1 million and you get it, you don't feel like a piece of meat, you feel like a big steak.\"\n\nAt the same time, the press began to insinuate that her big payday was connected to her status as a sex symbol.\n\n\"I don't think I am, I really don't. I don't want to be a sex symbol,\" she says.\n\n\"I'm very proud of being a woman and I think sex is absolutely gorgeous but as far as being a sex goddess, I never thought of myself that way.\"\n\nShe was condemned by the Vatican and hounded by the press\n\nBetween bad weather and Taylor's pneumonia-induced tracheotomy, it would take more than three years for Cleopatra to make it to cinemas.\n\nDuring reshoots, Taylor struck up a covert romance with co-star Richard Burton while still married to Fisher and Burton was married to actress Sybil Burton.\n\n\"I loved Richard, I didn't want his marriage to break apart. Sybil was a wonderful woman but I couldn't help loving him. It was a fact,\" Taylor says.\n\nThe affair whipped up intense press interest from paparazzi hungry for Taylor's next high-profile scandal.\n\nShe says the press would hound her car for miles, dressing up as workmen and priests to try and gain access to her home.\n\nThe scrutiny over Taylor and Burton's relationship got so bad that the Vatican weighed in, calling Taylor 'a despicable woman' and suggesting that her children should be taken away from her.\n\n\"A day after that someone was outside the studio trying to blow me up with a bomb …. It was really a horrendous week,\" Taylor says.\n\nFisher's emotions over the betrayal resulted in frightening behaviour.\n\n\"Eddie at night-time would sit up, he had a gun, every time I would start to nod my eyes and fall asleep he would stroke my arm and say 'I'm not going to kill you, I wouldn't shoot you, you're too pretty.' All night long,\" Taylor says.\n\n\"I ran from the house, I was so scared.\"\n\nTaylor divorced Fisher in 1964, marrying Burton 10 days later in a private ceremony.\n\nShe didn't think punishment was waiting for her in the afterlife\n\nTowards the end of The Lost Tapes, Taylor admits that she feels guilt over her affair with Burton and how it affected his children.\n\nMeryman then asks if she has any worries over how the situation played out.\n\n\"Do you mean do I think I'll be punished in hell?\" Taylor pointedly clarifies.\n\n\"I don't think we can plan on being rewarded or punished afterward, I think we must pay on this earth. We must do our penance, now.\"\n\nLater, Meryman asks her to define who Elizabeth Taylor is.\n\n\"All I know is that I was a movie star, that once or twice did a very capable job of acting. I am not satisfied with what I am, I am not satisfied with what I've done. I want to improve.\""
