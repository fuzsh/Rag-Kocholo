        "text": "Matting agents are added to wood coatings to help achieve a natural wood look, but traditional matting agents also reduce a coating‚Äôs chemical resistance, transparency, and durability. The result is a final product that may look great in-store but can‚Äôt withstand the wear and tear of everyday use.

That's why we host an internal ‚ÄúLecture and Learn‚Äù series with one-day seminars featuring some of the most renowned and respected minds in our fields. Our guest speakers come from storied universities like MIT and Columbia University in the U.S. and premiere institutions from Manchester to Tokyo to Beijing. Past speakers have covered topics ranging from new paradigms in catalyst design to plastics recycling to chemical engineering approaches to catalytical reduction of CO2. Although these sessions are exclusive to Grace‚Äôs researchers , their impact is substantial, helping to ensure that our R&D scientists and engineers are always at the forefront of scientific advancements and furthering Grace‚Äôs commitment to excellence and innovation. üîî For more on Grace, be sure to follow and turn on our bell notification. #ContinuousLearning #ResearchAndDevelopment #Catalysis #MaterialsScience #Careers\n\nTraditional catalysts can be inefficient, leading to lower yields and higher production costs, impacting overall profitability. ActivCat¬Æ catalyst is our solution, taking things a step further with unique activation qualities that ensure optimal performance and economic benefits. For example, a leading plastics manufacturer improved their production efficiency by 20% and reduced catalyst costs by 15% after switching to ActivCat¬Æ catalyst. Our unique licensor independence means you have the freedom to choose the best catalyst for your needs, avoiding restrictive agreements and premiums. See how ActivCat¬Æ catalyst can transform your operations: https://lnkd.in/eK3eWsUD #ChemicalEngineering #CatalystTechnology #Innovation #Efficiency\n\nConnect with Grace at the Latin American Refining Technology Conference (LARTC) from September 3-5 in Cartagena, Colombia! Stefan Brandt, Market Development Director Energy Transition, FCC, will be on hand to discuss the critical issue of plastics recycling when he presents on the co-processing of chemical recycling products in fluid catalytic cracking units. While mechanical recycling requires a high purity of plastic waste, the collection and sorting of mixed plastics makes advanced chemical recycling another important route to help generate value from plastics recycling and produce lower carbon intensity products. During Stefan‚Äôs presentation, learn more about a successful collaboration between Grace and a European refining company with assets in Latin America to develop plastics recycling risk assessments and the predict the impact of co-processing on FCC yields, product qualities, and overall economics.

The presentation drew focus on gender diversity, misunderstood LGBTQ+ terms and strategies for creating a supportive and inclusive workplace. ‚ÄúWe were thrilled with the support from all employees in helping GPS achieve our mission. A big thank you to our leaders for fostering a safe space for everyone,‚Äù said Sarut Jianrattanasawat GPS Chair. We appreciate all our team members who joined us virtually and in-person in Columbia. Kudos to the GPS team for organizing a great event! #Inclusion #Diversity #LGBTQ #DEI\n\nIron tolerance is known to be a significant challenge for refiners, which is why we‚Äôre excited to announce some major strides in this area, ensuring our fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts can offer you enhanced metals tolerance. Join us on August 14 for a webinar where we'll share our breakthrough research and details about the new Grace Iron Deactivation Protocol (Grace-IDP‚Ñ¢). The Grace-IDP‚Ñ¢ protocol helps unlock significant research potential to improve FCC catalysts and help refiners avoid iron poisoning in their units. üôå Meet our speakers: ‚û°Ô∏èGary Cheng ‚û°Ô∏èLuis Bougrat ‚û°Ô∏èShankhamala Kundu Learn more: https://lnkd.in/dSu-8mz3 #Webinar #FCC #Catalyst #Innovation #Refining\n\nWe‚Äôre excited to see you at CPHI Milan, a must-attend event for the pharmaceutical industry!

While white roofs and walls can reduce indoor temperatures in the summer by as much as 30%, dirt and grime can reverse the effect. For coatings formulators, incorporating colloidal silica into architectural and industrial coatings can help: - improve dirt pickup resistance - keep paint fresh to maintain its aesthetic appeal - reduce üî• heat absorption - ensure that heavy equipment paint withstands the üí™ toughest conditions Read our blog to learn more about the benefits of colloidal silica: https://lnkd.in/ew6kH4Sp #Coatings #Paints #NanoTechnology #SurfaceProtection #durability\n\nFormulating nutraceuticals? Meet your new best friend! üåü SYLOID¬Æ XDP transforms challenging oily liquids into free-flowing powders without the need for solvents. Optimized for lipid-based systems, it ensures high load capacity and stability. Say goodbye to formulation headaches and hello to efficiency. Swipe through to see how SYLOID¬Æ XDP can help transform your processes. https://lnkd.in/d8c2fz85 #Nutraceuticals #Innovation #Formulation\n\nAs the polyolefin industry looks to maximize performance and sustainability with efficient and innovative production processes, the right polyethylene (PE) metallocene catalyst platform can help. Case in point: The unique activation chemistry of Grace‚Äôs ActivCat¬Æ catalyst enables approximately 40% lower catalyst consumption during PE production. Using less catalyst can minimize the environmental footprint, conserve precious raw materials, and contribute to a more sustainable future. üí° Learn more about how the catalyst you choose can maximize PE production AND help meet sustainability objectives on our blog: https://lnkd.in/dRXeuJWH #Sustainability #ChemicalEngineering #Polyolefins #Catalysts"
