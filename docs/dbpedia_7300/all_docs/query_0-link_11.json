        "text": "A brief Autobiography....\n\nIn the mid-1950's Seymour wrote a short autobiography...\n\n\"I graduated P.S. 10 in Manhattan where I won a gold art medal, the results of a contest for graduates. I attended the High School of Commerce taking their commercial art course, and studied at the National Academy of Design, where I took evening classes.\n\n\"An annex of Commerce was close to the Bray Studios, and I worked there after school and Saturdays coloring drawings for, Colonel Hezaliar, an animated cartoon they were producing. On leaving school I worked for various commercial artists, but was anxious to do animated cartoons. I managed to find employment in a small company, L.F. Cornwell, producers of a series called Ebinizer Ebony, which was being made in color in a now extinct process called Kelly color. I worked there from 1924 to 1925. I started as an office boy and within the year was one of their three animators.\n\n\"About this time I heard of an opening for an Inbetweener at Max Fleischer's Out of The Inkwell Studios, which was one of the largest Studios. I was fortunate enough to be able to join their staff and work under animators who were the top men in the industry. I was there for two years when I was offered an opportunity to go to MGM Studios in California as a junior writer. I had been with Fleischer from 1925 to 1927. I spent six months at MGM writing sub-titles to silent pictures, but when sound arrived there was no longer a need for titles and I was let go, along with the other writers.\n\n\"Sound was a great shot in the arm to the animated cartoons. After leaving MGM, I came back East and worked with an outfit that produced cartoons based on a popular comic strip called Joe Jinks. The pictures, unfortunately, never got out of the projection room. From there I worked as an Inbetweener at Loucks & Norling, producers of industrial pictures and the famous characters, Mutt & Jeff. The pictures got to the screen but fell short of enough excitement to make a series. I was with this studio for 6 months, in 1928, when I left and returned to the Fleischer Studios.\n\n“Due to my former experience with the Inkwell Studios, I was able to secure a position as an Inbetweener at the Fleischer Studios, where I remained for 14 years, from 1928 to 1942. I was at the studio for about six months when I became an animator. About a year later I was appointed a head animator, a position I enjoyed up to the time the studio embarked on its first feature length cartoon, Gulliver’s Travels, which was made in the Fleischer’s Florida Studios. With a group of writers I worked on the development of the screen adaptation, and when the picture went into production, I was made director of animation. When the second feature length cartoon, Mr. Bug Goes To Town, went into production, I worked in an advisory capacity and took over the direction of the shorts that were being produced concurrently with the feature. Included in the shorts were the tremendously popular Superman pictures.\n\n“As a director I made Talkartoons, Bouncing Ball screen songs, Betty Boop, and commercial cartoons, and government animated pictures for the army and navy. The studio entered into an agreement with the King Features Syndicate to test their newspaper character, Popeye the Sailor, for an animated cartoon. I made the first Popeye which was incorporated into a Betty Boop picture. When it was screened in the theaters, it was a bomb-shell and overnight success. That was the start of the Popeye series which eventually resulted in over 300 pictures.\n\n“When the Fleischer Studios closed, Sam Buchwald, Isidore Sparber and I formed the Famous Studios, which we ran from May, 1942 to May, 1953---11 years.\"\n\nNOTES: After the death of Sam Buchwald in 1951, Famous Studios continued to be run by Seymour and Izzy. In 1956, Paramount Pictures assumed fuller control of the studio, renaming it Paramount Cartoon Studios, with Seymour and Izzy remaining in management positions. Izzy died August, 1958. Seymour was still working at Paramount Cartoon Studios when he died of a heart attack in 1964 at the age of 56.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\n\"How a Cartoon is Produced\"\n\n“How a Cartoon is Produced” on page 6 of \"Paramount News\" (Volume III No.11 March 12, 1951) shows the basic steps in the process of creating a cartoon (click to enlarge image)… the accompanying text is as follows…\n\n“Our cameraman spent all last week with Producers Isadore Sparber and Seymour Kneitel photographing the various steps necessary to make one of the popular Paramount cartoons. Little did we realize the amount of hard work that goes into the making of the ‘exhibitor’s best program builder.” But suppose you join us on a personally conducted tour of the cartoon studio. First, let’s meet Irving Spector as he completes the last sketch of a Popeye story in preparation for a final story conference. With the story approved, Animator Nick Tafuri is shown 2. as he strikes a pose for the action he is about to draw. His pencil sketches are photographed by Matthew Gentilella 3. for reviewing by head animator and director, who will assign the work to assistant animators and “fillers-in” 4. Now, with the animation well under way, Bob Owen, Bob Connavle and John Zago prepare the backgrounds. 5. Aftr the animators pencil sketches are traced in black ink, Alice Rehberg, Ruth Gorman and Joan Saracina match the transparent acetate sheets for the next step which is the coloring. 6. Here Peter Ignatenko, Eugene Babitchev and Maria Serianni prepare the colors in the paint laboratory. 7. As an added precaution, Alice Ament matches the colors as she test-paints some of the transparent sheets. 8. It is at this point that Music Director Winston Sharples creates and arranges special music as 9. Morris Manne and Bernice Steinberg edit the cartoon for sound effects and dialogue. 10. The completed cartoon is screened for the staff and with the approval of Producers Sparber and Knitel (sic), Leonard McCormick photographs the main title and another top-notch Paramount cartoon is ready for selling and booking. It’s just as easy as that!\"\n\n\"Paramount News\" Vol. III No.11 March 12, 1951: Collection of Virginia Mahoney\n\n↧\n\nArticle 22\n\nFamous Studios\n\nOn May 25, 1942, an agreement was signed transitioning the former Fleischer Studios into the new Famous Studios. Shown on the left is the original agreement between the three principals (click to enlarge).\n\nIt states: \"THIS PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT, made and entered into this 21st day of May, 1942, between SEYMOUR KNEITEL, ISIDORE SPARBER and SAM BUCHWALD, for and in consideration of the sum of Ten Dollars and other valuable considerations paid by each of the partners hereto to the other,...\"\n\nItem 1 states: \"This partnership will hereafter be known and operated under the name of FAMOUS STUDIOS and its object and purpose is to produce motion picture cartoons under a management contract with Paramount Pictures, Inc.\"\n\nPartnership Agreement- 4 pages- Collection of Virginia Mahoney\n\n\"Paramount News\"\n\nMarch, 1951\n\nThis cover from “Paramount News,” an in-house Paramount publication shows Seymour Kneitel, in the foreground, and Izzy Sparber, examining a reel of film, surrounded by some of the studios famous characters. (click to enlarge image)\n\nAll character images are the copyright and trademarks of their respective owners.\n\n↧\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\n1932 Christmas Card\n\nDrawn by Seymour Kneitel in 1932 while he was working at Fleischer Studios, this Christmas card celebrates not only Christmas but the impending birth of Seymour and Ruth’s first child, son Tommy, born January, 28,1933. Animation staffers exchanged these unique personalized cards for Christmas, weddings, surgeries, and any number of other events! Exchanging these personalized Christmas cards was a wide spread practice at the studio.\n\nShown here is the original art for the card as well as the final card. These cards were usually printed with only one color ink, usually black, and color was added by hand. Also, there was usually a space left on the card to personally fill in the name of the recipent.\n\nCollection of Virginia Mahoney\n\n↧\n\nStart to Finish!\n\nA Christmas Card\n\nStart to Finish!\n\nSince it’s interesting to see how a concept progresses from the first glimmer of an idea to the final printed piece… thought you’d enjoy this card Seymour did for Christmas, 1935, when son Tommy was almost age two.\n\nThe first sketch, was done on Fleischer Studios 8 1/2” x 11” animation paper and is just the beginnings of a idea.\n\nThe second image is the more developed final artwork, 7 1/2” x 11” and on thin board. The gray color is an overlay of two different acetate dot screens laid over the black inked drawing.\n\nThe last image is the final printed card, 4 1/4” x 5 1/4,” and ready to be hand colored! Gee , I wish I had one of the hand-colored ones... BTW: the dot screens on the middle image are slightly out of register but can't be fixed without damage to the artwork.\n\nCollection of Virginia Mahoney\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nBachelor Dinner for Seymour Kneitel...\n\nDecember 1931\n\nThis photo of Seymour Kneitel’s bachelor party was taken exactly eighty years ago, in New York City at the Blue Ribbon Restaurant, December, 1931. Seymour (front row center) met his future wife, Ruth Fleischer, while both were working at Fleischer Studios. Max Fleischer, Seymour’s soon to be father-in-law is in the front row, far left.\n\nThe staff at Fleischer Studios during the late 1920’s and 1930’s often celebrated occasions like this together. Staff also joined the studio sports teams (bowling, baseball etc), played cards and gambled together, partied together, and the men held these bachelor dinners.\n\nFleischer Studios was a training ground for animators and other animation specialists.While many worked their entire careers with Fleischer Studios (and it’s successor studio Famous Studios) others went on to work at any number of other emerging animation studios…. sometimes even returning later to work again at Fleischers. Many of the men in this photo went on to become prominent and well known figures in animation.\n\nIt’s interesting to note that, as with Seymour, virtually all these men would have begun their careers in the early days of silent black and white film…. worked through the introduction of sound, color, and 3D…..and by the end of their careers where producing animation for Television!\n\nSeated front row left to right are Max Fleischer, Seymour Kneitel, Roland (‘Doc’)Crandall. Standing behind them are Frank Paiker, Willard Bowsky, Al Eugster,Ugo D'Orsi, Reuben Timinsky, and possibly Dave Tendlar (present but not visiblein this copy of the print). Back row: Sam Stimson, Charles Shettler, SamBuchwald, unknown, Izzy Sparber, Tom Bonfiglio (who later changed his name toGoodson), Ralph Sommerville, Myron Waldman. Collection of Ginny Mahoney.\n\n↧\n\nA Love Story...\n\nMy parents were married on December 24, 1931. They met while both were working at Fleischer Studios. They remained completely devoted to each other through raising three children and dealing with the sometimes-challenging politics of the animation business.\n\nMy dad had married Ruth Fleischer, the boss’s only daughter. When they met, my father Seymour was a young animator at Fleischer Studios. Another Fleischer animator, Shamus Culhane, in his autobiography, Talking Animals and Other People, notes: “The marriage made no difference in Seymour’s status in the studio: he was never given, nor did he ever ask for, special handling from the management.”\n\nIn another post I’ll share more about my mother. She was in some of Max Fleischer’s very early films, including roles in his short-lived and little known completely live action series ‘Carrie of the Chorus.’ Before working at the studio she had been dancing ‘on the road’ in an all girl troupe. In the late 1920’s she joined the staff of Fleischer Studios as an inker, progressing to head of the Coloring Department- and then to head of the Inking Department.\n\nIn an interview with historian Mike Barrier my mother talked about working at the studio “When I met Seymour, everyone became involved in the romance…It was a family; everybody knew what everybody was doing. The great part of it was, after work, we didn’t just all go away and forget each other.” This was a close-knit staff that spent considerable time together outside the office .\n\nAs they started life together it was with the background of the Great Depression, which began with the stock market crash of October 1929. Although many bussinesses closed or struggled to survive, this was not true of the movie business. Films and animated cartoons were an inexpensive escape from the troubles of daily life. In fact, there was so much creativity and technical progress during this time (at a number of animation studios) that the 1930’s is often referred to as “The Golden Age of Animation.”\n\nSeymour’s Letter of Contract from Fleischer Studios (below) shows the typical salary of an animator in the early1930’s….eighty dollars a week. The second letter reflects the huge success and popularity of Fleischer films that allowed a bonus to be distributed to employees Christmas 1931.\n\n↧\n\nMERRY CHRISTMAS FROM SEYMOUR!\n\nAnother original card from Seymour and Ruth, who are yet again facing the Christmas season waiting for the birth of a baby. At the time Seymour was working for Fleischer Studios.\n\nChristmas was a hugely important holiday for the Fleischer Studios people. Staff came from many different backgrounds, many of them were first generation Americans... and they represented many different religions. But no matter their background or religion, they all seemed to think Christmas was yet another great way to have a good time together.\n\nThey had a really big and crazy Christmas party in a rented theater or restaurant, exchanged these hand made and personalized Christmas cards with each other… and had a rousing good time. To see more about how Fleischer Studios staff celebrated Christmas, including more of the original Christmas cards created by staff... plus rare footage of a home made movie during one of these 1930’s Christmas parties….\n\ngo to…\n\nFleischerstudios.com\n\nClick on the word 'Museum' near the top of the page (under Fleischer Studios). This will take you to the Fleischer Studios Museum site where you can click to enter the exhibit, entitled 'Christmas.'\n\nEnjoy and Merry Christmas…\n\nand watch this Blog in early 2012 for the next postings on some of the interesting ‘technical’ things Seymour was involved with.\n\n↧\n\nSEYMOUR, IZZY, and \"THE BIBLE\"\n\nCover of \"The Standard Production Reference,\" missing front label.\n\nCollection of Virginia Mahoney\n\nCover label: Collection of J.J. Sedelmaier.\n\nTHIS JUST IN! J.J. Sedelmaier noticed I was missing the label on the cover – and sent me a scan of his label. What a gift! Now I know for certain the year it was first officially distributed…1940. Thanks J.J.!\n\nThis document, ‘The Standard Production Reference,’ often referred to as ‘The Bible’ was in use at Fleischer Studios by 1940. It was developed by Seymour Kneitel and Izzy Sparber for the use of “animator’s and their assistants.” Originally intended for Fleischer Studios staff it continued in use as the official manual for Famous Studios as well. The need for such a document shows how complex the industry had become since the animated films of the early 1900’s.\n\nIn a 1935 article published in Fleischer Animated News and written by animator Bill Turner, he reflected on the earlier less complex days of a fledgling animation industry…..\n\n“All that was needed to go into business in those days was a Parker pen and pencil set. There were no separate departments, everyone working in one room about as large as a good sized doll house. Such departments as Music, Story, Timing and Background were unheard of....... The pictures were run on a portable projector against a wall. In place of a dark room, the camera magazines were loaded in a black bag or overcoat.”\n\nBy 1935 when Bill Turner wrote the above, the animation industry had evolved to a much higher level of complexity with separate departments for such functions as story, animation, inking, paint mixing, opaquing, background, timing and music. In addition the increasing popularity of animated films led to increases in staff size (when Fleischer Studios moved to Florida to make Gulliver’s Travels in 1938 their staff grew to over 700 employees). All this growth created a need to formalize procedures to insure an orderly flow of work within a studio.\n\nSeveral studios developed some form of in house ‘manual’ to answer this need. The Fleischer Studios manual, ‘The Bible,’ is sixty-one pages long. In addition to detailing procedures, it provides sample jobsheets to accompany work as it moves through departments, includes guidelines for dealing with special effects, and information on the use and limitations of various special animation cameras (Approach, Large Field, Set-Back etc.), plus a myriad of other issues that are reflected in the index (below). Since ‘The Bible’ was such an excellent guide to animation production in general it was often used as a reference by other animation studios.\n\nAnimation historian Mark Langer notes that “… the Standard Production Reference later became a guide by which other animation companies were organized or by which they regularized production….. For at least thirty seven years after the demise of the Fleischer Studios, “The Bible” was the most commonly used reference work within New York animation studios.”\n\nThis is the first of two posts containing selected pages from that document. These pages show how complex the animation field had become by 1940, and the broad knowledge now required of an animator.

The scope of this document reflects how complex the making of animated films had become, and the broad knowledge then required of animators.\n\nThis has a lot of technical information about how things were done…. the details of which may put some to sleep.

But stay tuned…coming soon… posts of a more popular nature!\n\nclick to enlarge an image\n\nCollection of Virginia Mahoney\n\n↧\n\nHAPPY VALENTINES DAY!\n\nHere’s a Valentine that my dad, Seymour, made for my mom. Living with an animator meant we might receive a one of a kind hand-made card like this at special times. Don’t know the year for this card, but it was typical.\n\nThis is also a Valentine from my dad celebrating Popeye! Seymour was Head Animator/Director* on 91 of the 230 theatrical Popeye cartoons made between 1933 and 1957, including the very first Popeye (these figures do not include any of the later made for TV Popeyes). The earliest Popeye films were made during his time at Fleischer Studios, they continued through the change-over to Famous Studios, and later to Paramount Cartoon Studios.\n\nPopeye, a character created by Elzie Segar, first appeared in the comic strip Thimble Theatre. Olive Oyl and her boyfriend, Ham Gravy, were the original stars of this strip. Popeye appeared as a minor character in 1929, ten years into the strip’s already very successful run. Popeye quickly became so popular he replaced Olive Oyl as star of the strip. In 1933 Popeye made a ‘test’ appearance in Popeye the Sailor, a film in the Fleischer’s popular Betty Boop series. Popeye was immediately a huge success on film and soon was starring in his own Popeye the Sailor series. He became the most popular animated film character of his day.\n\nA number of notable changes accompanied Popeye’s move to the world of film, some of which can be seen in his very first picture. In the comic strip Popeye derived strength from rubbing the Wiffle Hen, with spinach being used only sparingly. But on film the Fleischers consistently made spinach the source of Popeye’s super strength. Also, this first picture introduced Popeye’s famous theme song, “I’m Popeye the Sailor Man.”\n\nHere’s a typical Popeye film directed by Seymour, “Little Swee’ Pea,” released in 1936. Note the wonderful 3D effect that’s created through the use of a stereoptical camera process (also known as the ‘set-back') that was developed at Fleischer Studios.\n\n\"Little Swee' Pea\" 7 minutes....click on video to enlarge for viewing\n\n*All occurrences of Popeye, Olive Oyl, and Bluto are © 2011 King Features Syndicate, Inc. TM Hearst Holdings, Inc.\n\nAnyone on staff could submit a cartoon story idea, and if it was used a staffer could earn a few extra dollars. Here’s a story idea (below) from Izzy Klein, who in this case was in the story department (many ideas came from animators and other staff). His story concept is so similar to the story in “Lil Swee’ Pea” that I wonder if it might have inspired this film. One can see just how thin the plot is (this is typical), and how dependent the final story would be on a series of ‘gags.’ You can click on the text to enlarge...\n\nSince anyone could submit story ideas, some are handwritten, some typed… any form was acceptable. They’re really fun—sometime later I’ll post a big group of these ‘story ideas.’\n\n*During the time of Fleischer Studios film credit for direction always went to Dave Fleischer. In reality, Dave acted more as Producer and Production Supervisor. The actual ‘direction’ of each film was handled by the Head Animator… who was the first animator name listed in a film’s credits.\n\nPopeye card and Popeye typed story idea: Collection: Virginia Mahoney\n\n↧\n\nThe Golden Age of 3D!\n\nCould this be describing today? … No!…. What’s considered ‘The Golden Age of 3D’ was actually from 1952 to 1955!\n\nFilm-makers have attempted to create the ‘illusion of depth’ since the earliest days of film. Experiments with 3D movies as we know them—with glasses—actually started as far back as 1897! But most attempts were for novelty, or impractical, and never got off the ground as a serious format for film until the 1950’s.\n\nPatent drawing for invention of ‘set-back.’ Patent filed in 1933, and granted in 1936 to Max Fleischer. (click on to enlarge for viewing)\n\nWhen Seymour worked as an animator at Fleischer Studios in the 1930’s they were using a completely different method to create the illusion of depth. It was technically called ‘the set-back’ and was used in many Fleischer films. This process, patented by Max Fleischer, involved building large miniature sets that sat on a turntable. Painted drawings on clear celluloid sheets were placed in a special holder in front of the set. A special camera placed in front of the holder sequentially photographed each cell … after which the set was turned ever so slightly. When projected this created a terrific 3D effect… and in spite of considerable expense, was used in many Fleischer films. A number of other animation studios developed their own multiplane process with the same goal in mind—achieving a 3D effect.\n\nPhoto: Dave Fleischer shown with 'set-back' for opening scene of Mr. Bug Goes to Town Fleischer Studios, released December 1941. Collection: Virgnia Mahoney\n\nAn interesting thing happened to the film industry in the early 1950’s. Movies had reached a low point in attendance--- television, an increasingly popular medium had taken away the audience! Attendance in theaters fell from 90 million in 1948 to 46 million in 1951. A favorite joke in our house was of a man standing at the box office asking what time the feature started, and the box office girl asking... \"What time can you be here?\" In 1952, just as theaters were desperately looking for something special they could offer the public, along comes the film Bwana Devil, the first popular 3D film in what would be referred to as 'The Golden Age of 3D.' Suddenly theaters could offer something TV could not...3D!!!\n\nPoster for Bwana Devil explaining the 3D process, 1952 (click on to enlarge for viewing)\n\nCollection: Virginia Mahoney\n\nBwana Devil was made in a dual strip process, which meant it required two projectors with a special motor to properly sync the projectors, a special silver projection screen… and polarized glasses* worn for viewing. Most films made during this time used this process. Bwana Devil was hugely popular with the public. It not only brought the audience back to the theaters—it started a whole stream of 3D films that were made between 1952-55.\n\nDuring this time Famous Studios made two animated 3D films, Popeye, The Ace of Space, (released 1953) and a Casper film, Boo Moon, (released 1954). To take advantage of 3D, both films used outer space as a setting. The Popeye was directed by Seymour, and the Casper film by both Seymour and Izzy Sparber.\n\nAdvertisement for the Trade for Popeye, The Ace of Space. Famous Studios, 1953.\n\nPopeye and Bluto are copyright 2011 King Features Syndicate, Inc. TM Hearst Holdings, Inc.\n\nCollection: Virginia Mahoney\n\nI remember going to the screening of the 3D Popeye film with my dad. He got a great charge out of the fact that the opening ‘gag’ in that 1953 film Popeye, The Ace of Space--- is the same ‘gag’ that had been used in the very first Popeye film made in 1933…. that of Popeye having to cross a great chasm by tossing a rope to the other side and pulling the other side to him. Re-cycling a good ‘gag’ was very common in those days. Popeye, The Ace of Space can still be seen at 3D Film Festivals today.\n\nBelow is the Agreement between Famous Studios and Paramount Pictures dated July 1953 stating that during the contract period of 1953-54 Famous will make twenty four cartoons that will include both a Popeye and a Casper in 3D.\n\nHere’s a 2D copy of the Casper film Boo Moon that was originally made in 3D. When Casper arrives on the moon the tiny inhabitants treat him like Gulliver…another bit of story re-cycling! You’ll also notice King Luna is a take-off on King Bombo from the earlier Fleischer Studio's film Gulliver’s Travels.\n\nBoo Moon, starring Casper the Friendly Ghost, Famous Studios- released 1954.\n\nAll character images are the copyright and trademarks of their respective owners.\n\nHowever, ‘The Golden Age of 3D’ was a passing fad, brought down by problems inherent in the 3D process used. The use of two projectors required them both to be exactly in sync—but film repairs due to tears, or even a sloppy projectionist could result in the two reels being out of sync, resulting in viewer headaches and eyestrain. Also, the process required a special silver screen best viewed from the center with sideline seating often unusable. By 1955 3D was finished, and films using a wide screen format, that didn’t have these problems, were becoming popular. CinemaScope was to be the new fad.\n\n3D periodically re-enters our lives. Some film historians see this occurring in 30 years cycles, pointing to ‘The Golden Age of 3D’ in the 1950’s, the brief 3D resurgence in the 1980’s (Friday the 13th Part 3, Amityville 3-D, Jaws 3-D, etc.)– and in 2008 a new wave of 3D films started up again, energized by the release of the 3D film Journey to the Center of the Earth.\n\nThe impetus behind this most recent 3D resurgence is again related to failing attendance at the box office. Since we can all now view large screen hi-def films in the comfort of our homes. theaters once again needed something unique to lure the public back. Again, the answer is 3D… this time enhanced with additional dazzling effects. When the film Avatar came out in 2009 it was released in 2D, RealD 3D, Dolby3D, Xpan 3D, and IMAX 3D. New and improved 3D films are suddenly abundant --- though so far we’re still wearing glasses…..\n\nAn interesting end to this story……Animation historian\n\nMichael Sporn has a post on his blog about Larry Riley who had worked at Fleischer Studios:\n\n\"Larry also told of a 3D process he’d developed for Paramount in the 50’s when the movies were all going 3D…Larry offered to give me the camera on which he shot these films- he had it stored in his basement. He was afraid it would get thrown out when he died. I didn’t have room for it.”\n\nLarry’s grandson later told Michael another collector took the camera to keep it from destruction…. hopefully this bit of history is safely out there…somewhere….\n\n*Most 3D viewing glasses during this time were polarized, with each lens the same gray tinted color- as opposed to the alternative type 3D glasses which have red/blue lenses.\n\nOnline References include:\n\nWikipedia\n\nOdd Culture\n\nMichael Sporn Animation\n\nFor the history of many amazing early 3D attempts see:\n\nhttp://widescreenmovies.org/WoddCultureSM11/3D.htm\n\n↧\n\nSEYMOUR, IZZY, E.G. LUTZ, and \"THE BIBLE\"\n\nThis past January I posted several pages from the Standard Production Reference, the Fleischer Studios document developed by Seymour Kneitel and Izzy Sparber for in-house use. Often referred to as \"The Bible,\" this is such an interesting piece of animation history I've now posted the complete document on this blog. To view it go to the black bar near the top of this page and click on “The Standard Production Reference.”\n\nSome Background:\n\nIn my dad’s library there was a copy of the book Animated Cartoons by E.G. Lutz. Prior to the development of in-house animation manuals, such as the Standard Production Reference, Lutz was the first and most important book that existed on animation and how to do it. First published in 1920 it covers the early history of animated film, technical information, details on how to animate people and animals in various activities… walking, running etc, plus ideas on how to create comedy on film. Below I’ve posted a few spreads from Lutz to give an idea of the book early animator's such as my dad used as a reference. (FYI: click on images to enlarge for reading)\n\nTo view more images and information about this very interesting Lutz book see Michael Sporn’s excellent discussion on his animation Blog: http://www.michaelspornanimation.com/splog/?p=2812\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nPOPEYE FOR PRESIDENT!\n\nIt’s politics as usual in this 1956 film Popeye for President! Popeye and Bluto are both running for President and need only one more vote to break the tie… and that vote belongs to Olive Oyl. Dirty tricks abound as they vie for her vote.\n\nPlanned to be timely, this film was released in 1956 just as a real Presidential campaign was in progress. Dwight D. Eisenhower, the extremely popular Republican President was being challenged by Democrat Adlai Stevenson. This was a rematch from four years earlier when Eisenhower first defeated Stevenson.\n\nSome other interesting things to note. The 'story credit' in this film is given to Jack Mercer. In addition to story development, Jack Mercer also did the voice of Popeye. Mercer had been working as an in-betweener at Fleischer Studios in 1935 when he was overheard by Lou Fleischer singing in Popeye’s gravelly voice. Lou immediately put Mercer to work doing Popeye’s voice. In addition to working as an animator in training Mercer became an extremely versatile voice artist providing Popeye’s voice as well as the voices for many other Fleischer films.\n\nJack Mercer and Popeye Collection: V. Mahoney\n\nMercer had a real talent for developing story ideas. He submitted hundreds of them, many of them ideas for Popeye films. Although Famous Studios had a story department all staffers were encouraged to come up with story ideas, and if a concept was accepted a staffer was paid an extra fee.\n\nHere’s two story proposals that were submitted to Famous Studios for a film to be titled Popeye for President--- both were written by Izzie Klein, who was part of the Famous Studios story department. These are two different proposals for a film with that same title, neither of which were used, though one has a slight resemblance to the final film of that name. It may be that Jack Mercer, who received the screen story credit for this film, used this basic idea and elaborated on it, producing the final story. You can click on the pages to enlarge for reading...\n\nThe two story proposals below, “TWO SCRAMBLED YEGGS“and “GUIDES AND DOLLS” are samples of other story ideas that were submitted by Jack Mercer. I get a big kick out of reading these stories in this early form…….\n\nBTW- Seymour Kneitel was the Director of Popeye for President.\n\nScripts: Collection of Virginia Mahoney\n\nPopeye, Olive Oyl and Bluto are copyright King Features Syndicate, Inc. TM Hearst Holdings, Inc.\n\n↧\n\nABOUT INKERS AND OPAQUERS...\n\nOne of the great aspects of being part of an animator’s life was being on the receiving end of some very personalized artwork.\n\n(click to enlarge)\n\nThe drawing above was given to me as I was leaving for my first year of college after having spent the summer of 1954 working at Famous Studios as an opaquer—coloring animation cells. My dad is the fellow helping me to the door. He never would have hired me … but when I went to an employment agency looking for a summer job they told me of an opening at Famous Studios. Without telling my dad I interviewed (though surely the person interviewing made the connection) and I got the job.\n\nBefore this I’d had little idea of what it took to make an animated film. For people who were on the bottom of the ladder—like inkers and opaquers-- it was hard work that involved a lot of sitting over a desk with a slanted back-lit light table for a surface--- lots of eye and back strain. Didn’t take long to notice that just about everyone wore glasses. And everyone punched in and out daily on a time clock. As an opaquer one would get assigned to a series of cells, maybe 15 or so, that had already been inked on the front. The image on the cell was often not even a whole figure—all 15 cells might be of just an arm! So one never got the drift of what the whole cartoon might be about. After receiving the allotment of cells one visited the paint department, which was right in the opaquing area. This is where you’d pick up the several colors that were specified on a sheet that came with the drawing—it was so important to use the exact color specified to insure color consistency throughout the film. Next, one sets to work painting on the reverse of the cell—and staying within the lines! As each cell is painted it’s moved to shelves above the desk to dry. Humid days were awful- nothing dried and there might be cells sitting around the room on every flat surface, high and low, with every available fan in service.\n\nHaving performed adequately—the following summer I was hired as an inker—sitting again at the same type desk—but this time laying a clean cell over an animator’s drawing and using pen and ink to draw a black line on the cell to define an animator’s drawing. Inking had a few additional challenges—one of which was making the ink adhere to the cell—since the tendency was for a cell to repel ink. This required putting a kind of talc on the cell—not too much—not too little. Plus one had to develop some skill at making a black line that was consistently the same.\n\nThe high points were learning more about the whole process of animation and meeting a fantastic group of people. They worked hard—but when party time came they were ready for a good time. And any time there was a special occasion, when someone left, or was sick, or got married… there would be these memorable one of a kind cards.\n\n↧\n\nTHE FIRST WOMAN ANIMATOR!\n\nIn 1933 Lillian Friedman, while working at Fleischer Studios, became the first woman EVER to work as an animator at any studio.\n\nFrom the early days of animation—and up until 1933—women were generally hired only in the lowly role of inker or opaquer. If talented and lucky they might advance to the position of inbetweener. But they NEVER worked as animators.\n\nIt was accepted thinking in the industry that women were not capable of the creativity required to be an animator, plus there was resistance to women entering this male dominated field. The article below from a Paramount 1936 promotional booklet includes the statement “Nobody knows just why, but women generally are not successful as cartoon animators.”\n\nThere’s also a telling 1938 letter that can be found online, typed on beautiful Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs stationary. It’s a response to Miss Mary V. Ford who wrote Walt Disney Productions concerning a job… the reply states “Women do not do any of the creative work in connection with preparing the cartoons for the screen, as that work is performed entirely by young men. For this reason girls are not considered for the training school....The only work open to women consists of tracing the characters on clear celluloid sheets with India ink and filling in the tracings on the reverse side with paint according to directions.\"\n\n(click to enlarge for viewing)\n\nArticle from Paramount promotional booklet for \"Popeye The Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor\" 1936 Collection: Virginia Mahoney\n\nPopeye copyright 2011 King Features Syndicate, Inc. TM Hearst Holdings, Inc.\n\nIn 1933 Lillian Friedman, an employee of Fleischer Studios, became the very first female to be hired as a commercial animator at any animation studio. She had joined Fleischer Studios as an inbetweener in 1931 at the age of nineteen. Animator Shamus Culhane recognized that she was highly talented and advocated for her advancement to animator. It was no easy job to convince the other animators to accept a woman working in that position. In addition, Shamus points out in his book Talking Animals and Other People, he had to devise tricks to make her accepted in the all male environment… and even though Lillian achieved animator status she was paid considerably less then her male counterparts.\n\nThe film below, Pudgy and the Lost Kitten, gives screen credit for animation to Myron Waldman and Lillian Friedman. This copy of the film has German sub-titles which I always thought reflected how popular these films were overseas- but 'The Crazy HR' has corrected me... \"This was for many years a 'lost film,' meaning nobody knew about the existence of any copy of the cartoon. This has subtitles because it aired on the Channel ARTE during their show \"Cartoon Factory.\" (ARTE is a German Channel)\n\nFilm: Pudgy and the Lost Kitten\n\nBetty Boop and Pudgy copyright Fleischer Studios, Inc.\n\nThe Internet Movie Database (online) credits Lillian with animation work on 11 films made with Fleischer Studios between 1934 and 1938—and shows she received screen credit on seven of these films, and was uncredited for her work on the other four. However, IMDb did not include her animation on Sindbad the Sailor which the above article attests to—or a reference elsewhere to her animation on Betty Boop’s A Language All Her Own. So Lillian animated on a total of at least thirteen films, with six of them uncredited. The lack of screen credit is not unusual since generally, although several animators may work on a film, no more than two animators received on-screen credit. Lillian remained at Fleischer’s until 1939 when she resigned to be with her family full time.\n\nFor work purposes animators at the time were assigned to ‘units,’ each unit run by a head animator. While working as an animator at Fleischer Studios Lillian worked in three different units, each headed by a different animator… Shamus Culhane, Myron Waldman, and my dad… Seymour Kneitel.\n\n(When giving credit to trailblazing women animators I should also mention Laverne Harding who in 1934 went to work for another famous studio, Walter Lantz, becoming only the second women animator in the industry.)\n\nSources:\n\nBook: Talking Animals and Other People by Shamus Culhane\n\nPopeye Paramount Promotional brochure for Popeye the Sailor Meets Sindbad the Sailor 1936\n\nRay Pointer online comments\n\nDisney rejection letter:\n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/polaroid/632255233/\n\nThe Internet Movie Database (IMDb)\n\nBook: Who’s Who in Animated Cartoons by Jeff Lenburg\n\n↧\n\nGETTING PERSONAL...\n\nMy dad was always in an animation state of mind. He didn’t turn it off when he came home at night. He would get hysterical over a good ‘gag’ or joke (before the days of e-mail good jokes were widely shared in person with the re-telling of it a craft in itself). Sitting at the dinner table was an occasion for dad to gather input from the family for anything he might use at work. In fact, if we suggested a corny cartoon title that was used, we could earn five dollars! This generated a lot of hackneyed one-ups-manship between my two brothers, mother and myself. My brother Tommy swore he came up with the idea for the character ‘Goodie the Gremlin’ and he never got paid!! (Goodie starred in four Noveltoons, the first appeared in 1961.)\n\nIn addition, all kinds of life events were acknowledged with one of a kind creations. Here’s a selection of some of these unique drawings made by my dad, Seymour Kneitel.\n\nI especially like the one above made for my mother… it shows that humor at our house was neither high-class nor subtle.\n\nA Valentine for my mother has a bit of a spelling problem, but love the sentiment. In 1937, while Seymour was working for Fleischer Studios, the studio relocated to Florida. During and after that re-location there were many times when one of my parents might be in New York and the other in Florida. Besides several separations during the complex New York to Florida move, there were a number of film production activities not supported in Florida that required Fleischer staff traveling to New York.\n\nEnvelopes and letters were great places for a drawing...\n\nThe P.S. in the letter “Give my regards to Bimbo” is a reference to a real life dog they had called Bimbo.\n\nThese last three drawings are all on Fleischer Studios animation paper. When these drawings were done, animation studios each had their own preference as to the size of the paper, the type of paper, and the system of holes at the top that held the paper in place. Details such as these can be useful in identifying from which studio a drawing might have originated. The drawings below were made between 1931 and about 1938 during the time Fleischer Studios used this distinctive paper... 8.5” x 11” sheets punched with three holes at the top that fit their unique animation peg system. This paper was made specifically for them by Hammermill and is watermarked ‘Management Bond.’\n\nThis drawing on Fleischer animation paper looks like they’re temporarily separated again!\n\nThis must refer to changes around the house after the birth of first son, Tommy… which would date this and the drawing below about Feb. 1934.\n\nHere's a sketch made about the same time.. interesting to speculate on where he was going with this...\n\nI back-lit and enlarged one of the drawings (below) to show the ‘Management Bond’ watermark. The Fleischer’s continued to use this type of paper until about 1938 during the making of Gulliver’s Travels.\n\nAll items, letters, envelopes, drawing in this section: Collection of V.

My parents met while both were working at Fleischer Studios and they became one of the many studio romances that led to marriage.\n\nThe signatures on this card are a good survey of some well known people working for Famous Studios in the 1950’s...\n\nAl Eugster, Dave Tendlar, Nick Tafuri, Tom Johnson, and William Henning were long time animators—all had worked for both Fleischer and Famous Studios—as well as other studios. Bob Little and Liesel Howson, also long time employees, painted the animation backgrounds. Leonard McCormick was responsible for camera work and Win Sharples scored music for the cartoons. Jack Mercer was best known as the gravelly voice of Popeye….. Ellsworth Barthen and Mike Myer were story writers……and Mina Morrisey was Head of cel painting. Just to mention a few……\n\n↧\n\nYET MORE PERSONAL...\n\nSeymour’s granddaughter, Karin Kneitel, has offered to share some of the personal family items that she owns. Her father, Tommy Kneitel, was Seymour and Ruth’s first child. Tommy was born Jan. 28,1933, and is the infant/young child in these drawings.\n\nClick on any item to enlarge\n\nAt the time of Tommy’s birth Seymour was an animator for Fleischer Studios in New York City.\n\nNot sure why Seymour is staying at this Brooklyn Hotel (see below). I’m speculating that since Tommy was born in a Brooklyn hospital Seymour might have moved temporarily into the Hotel St. George to be closer. In the 1930’s women had longer maternity hospital stays then they do today.\n\nWow—stockings!!! These were probably made of silk or rayon (then called ‘artificial silk’) since Nylon had not yet been invented!\n\nStockings still seem to be the gift of choice. Tommy looks maybe 4 or 5 years old, so these stockings are likely still made of silk or rayon. It will be a couple more years--- 1940—before Dupont makes nylon stockings commercially available.\n\nIn 1933 Fleischer Studios signed a five year contract with King Features to make Popeye films. This pencil drawing that Seymour made for Tommy probably a few years later is curious in that Popeye wears a sailor tie (not used in the comic book or film drawings of Popeye) and he has a slightly different collar treatment.\n\nDone in 1938 or ’39, this is a drawing by Tommy himself! Seymour writes: “I showed Tommy a pencil-test of Gulliver- where a derrick was trying to lift his foot- he didn’t say anything but drew this picture and showed me it- Good isn’t it—Seymour.” Note that this drawing is on Fleischer Studios animation paper that uses the Fleischers distinctive hole punch system at the top.\n\nSince this letter mentions visiting the Worlds Fair it must date from either 1939 or 1940. As I’d mentioned in an earlier post- Seymour and family were often separated with one in New York and the other in Florida (or vice versa)—with Seymour often traveling between the two locations. At this time the Studio was in Florida and a number of filmmaking activities that were not supported in that Miami location had to be carried out in New York.\n\nA cute drawing by Seymour showing Tommy thanking ‘Max’ for a check. ‘Max’ is Tommy’s grandfather, Max Fleischer.\n\nHere’s a letter from Max Fleischer to grandson Tommy dated Jan. 1944. Max by this time was commuting between New York and Detroit while directing animation for the Jam Handy Organization. Here Max draws himself as a ghost carrying a corned beef sandwich!\n\nThanks for sharing these Karin!\n\n↧\n\nSERIOUS BUSINESS...\n\nShown left to right: 1947 \"March of Dimes\" Poster Girl Nancy Drury, Seymour Kneitel holding 4 1/2 year old son Kenny. Far right is Ken's grand-dad Max Fleischer. Taken in the Polio Ward of Knickerbocher Hospital, N.Y.C. Note the poster of Popeye on the back wall.\n\nMy dad loved his work… he loved to draw and he’d laugh hysterically at a good ‘gag.’ So it would seem that every day he’d go off to work wonderfully happy. Often he did. But like any other kind of show biz… the show had to go on and the business of animation had to go forward no matter what difficult times might be happening in your personal life.\n\nOur family was greatly impacted—as so many others were—by the terrible polio epidemic that peaked in the 1940’s and 50’s. Worse as the summer months approached, polio struck down children as well as adults, both paralyzing and killing. Polio was second only to the atomic bomb in surveys of what Americans feared most.\n\nMy two brothers, Tommy and Kenny, contracted polio within weeks of each other in June 1946. They were to remain in the polio ward of New York’s Knickerbocker Hospital for fourteen months receiving the only effective treatment that existed at the time, Sister Kenny hot packs.\n\nThe only time I saw them during those months was when they were taken outside on the porch pictured in the photo above. It was several stories above the ground. Periodically my parents would take me to a spot below where I could look up and wave to them. Tommy is on the bed in the very front, Kenny is in the 3rd crib back from the front.\n\nAs a parent I’ve often looked back and wondered how my dad—a devoted father—managed to every day go to the business of making cartoons with this heavy weight in his heart.\n\nSources:\n\nWikipedia\n\nSeavey, Nina Gilden, Jane S.

Released in 1945 as part of the Paramount Famous Studios Noveltoon series Casper soon became so popular he earned a series of his own. He went on to star in 55 theatrical films for Famous Studios before that series ended in 1959.\n\nCasper, as his fans know, was a gentle ghost with no interest in scaring people. Real ghosts mocked him for his mild manner, and humans were frightened by his translucent appearance. But little children and animals quickly recognized that Casper only wanted to play and make friends.\n\nCasper was unique among Famous Studios characters since he was an original creation and not based on another character (e.g Little Audrey was based on Little Lulu, and Herman and Katnip were similar to Tom and Jerry, etc.).\n\nIn fact, there’s an interesting story about Casper’s origins (although a few details are a bit murky). Credit for Casper’s creation goes to both Seymour Reit and Joe Oriolo. In 1939 Casper was featured in a children’s book they created together. Apparently Reit wrote the story and Oriolo illustrated the character. The story generated no interest, so while Reit was away serving in the military, Oriolo- who at the time was working for Famous Studios-- sold the character and story to Famous Studios... for two hundred dollars!!! Who could have guessed that this character would eventually inspire a whole supporting cast of ghostly characters, that it would generate over 55 theatrical cartoons, it’s own TV show, that the character would be sold to Harvey Brothers who then put Casper in comic books—and in 1995 Universal Studios would produce a highly successful computer generated Casper film! Neither Reit or Oriolo benefited beyond the initial $200 payment. In fact disagreement developed between the two over their respective roles in Casper’s development.\n\nClick to enlarge image\n\nChristmas Card from Harvey's. Date unknown. Collection: Virginia Mahoney\n\nSt. John’s publishing began producing Casper comics in 1949- and in 1952 the license for Casper comics was assumed by Harvey Comics. Harvey purchased Casper (as well as other Famous characters) outright in 1959 and all these characters soon appeared on the TV show Matty’s Funday Funnies. Some of the Casper films had previously been purchased in 1956 by TV distributor U.M.&M.T.V. Corp. When these films were packaged for television the original credits were often removed and replaced with new credits that included a reference to U.M.&M.T.V. Included below is a link to one such film A Hunting We Will Go, since it’s interesting that in the screen credit where it should have read Featuring Casper the Friendly Ghost, the ‘replaced’ credits instead read Featuring Caspers Friendly Ghost.\n\nInteresting controversies among Casper fans have to do with whether Casper is actually a dead child! And if so…how did Casper die?? At some point the ‘dead child’ concept was replaced by the concept of Casper belonging to a particular class of supernatural beings…ghosts! However when Casper appeared in Harvey Comics in the ‘60’s and ‘70’s it appeared that Casper was a ghost because his parents were already ghosts when they married. It wasn’t until the 1995 Casper feature film that the ‘dead child’ idea was revived along with an account of how Casper had died…. of pneumonia at the age of twelve due to overindulging in a day of sledding! The film even disclosed Casper’s full name… Casper McFadden.\n\nI’m including a few typed and hand-written Casper ‘story ideas.’ These are only a few of the over seventy five Casper story ideas I found among my dads things. Story ideas could be submitted by people who worked in the story department… or by anyone else in the Studio. If a story was used one could earn a few extra dollars. I love that often the stories submitted were totally hand-written— even the typed ones were pretty messy looking when measured against today’s standards. It didn’t seem to matter---\n\nClick on any image to enlarge\n\nThe first 'story idea' below was written by one of Casper's creators, Seymour Reit. It's two pages long and was submitted together with three other stories. The note at the top indicates that all four were purchased for $100. and adds \"additional sum if any used (to make up to $300).\" Not dated. Collection: Virginia Mahoney\n\nThe story idea (and drawing) below were submitted by Dave Tendlar. Dave began working at Fleischer Studios in 1931, and worked there and at its successor, Famous Studios, until the mid 1950's. He worked as both an animator and Director. After Famous Studios he continued to work in animation for a number of other studios including Terrytoons and Hanna-Barbera. Note that both pages are on pegged animation paper, and that Casper is still looking chunky (later he became more sleek). Dated Sept. 12, 1949. Collection: Virginia Mahoney\n\nThis last story idea below is by my dad, Seymour Kneitel. As the boss he was always looking for ways to keep costs down-- he's titled this \"Chisel angle for a Casper picture.\" It involves a clever re-use of old footage. Dated Nov. 12, 1956. (Thanks to the comments below from 'J. Lee' who points out this is likely the idea for the film Ghost Writers which was released in 1958- that films on-screen credit for direction is given to Seymour Kneitel, and for writing to Jack Mercer. I would guess that Mercer may have taken this brief premise and expanded it. Staff in those days were very versatile- in additional to writing stories, Jack Mercer was an assistant animator and the voice of Popeye!) Collection: Virginia Mahoney\n\nPS: Seymour Kneitel directed many of the Casper films- next post will be more about some of the people behind the scenes who worked on Casper films.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nMORE CASPER...\n\nHere’s some more story ideas that were submitted by Studio staff for Casper films. I thought these really good examples of how ideas could be submitted in any form--- they didn’t need to be anything fancy… like typed! Also, they're fun to read since you can really hear the voice of the writer.\n\nThis first proposal is by George Germanetti, long time Fleisher and Famous Studios animator.\n\nClick on any image to enlarge for reading\n\nHere’s a story idea below by Myron Waldman, another long time Fleischer and Famous Studios animator. Myron likely held the record for having worked on the most Betty Boop cartoons and was responsible for animating many Casper films as well.\n\nThe story idea below was submitted by Jack Mercer—who though he submitted many story ideas and was also an assistant animator, is best remembered as the voice of Popeye.\n\nIf you think the story idea below looks a bit more ‘professional’- it’s because the writer, Larz Bourne, was actually a member of the story department!\n\nI love these story ideas because they show how staffers in the 30’s and 40’s could choose to be involved in many aspects of a film... from start to finish!\n\nAll story idea scripts: Collection of Virginia Mahoney\n\n↧\n\nHALLOWEEN BOO'S\n\nHalloween is almost here… a good reason to visit again with Casper!\n\n(click to enlarge images)\n\nHere’s a Christmas Card sent out by the Harvey brothers featuring Famous Studios characters. During the late 1940’s and early 1950’s the Harvey brothers licensed Famous Studios characters for use in their comic books. In 1959 the Harveys purchased outright the entire line of Famous Studios characters along with related films and some other character rights. The date on this card from the Harveys is likely 1972, since Casper is riding the Apollo 16 lunar capsule that was launched on April 16, 1972. (This card was likely sent to my mother since my dad had died in 1964.)\n\nHere’s a few more Casper story ideas that were submitted by Famous Studios staff.\n\nThis first story idea is by Izzy Klein, a member of the story department at Famous Studios. I’ve read that later he was an early cartoonist for the New Yorker as well as an animator for Disney.\n\nThis next ‘story idea’ is by ‘Tex’ Henson. ‘Tex’ had actually started out working for Disney and later moved to Famous Studios, in New York, where he worked on Casper films. He had a long career in animation with many distinctions having worked on films as diverse as Song of the South, Peter and the Wolf, and the Bullwinkle Show. He’s also credited with naming the characters Chip ‘n’ Dale, as well as teaching animation in Texas.\n\nThe ‘story idea’ and drawings below for Minnie the Mermaid are by Larz Bourne, long time member of the Famous Studios story department. After leaving Famous Studios he worked for Hanna Barbera and DePatie-Freleng. During this later part of his career he worked on stories for many different characters, including work on the 1979 made for TV Casper Halloween Special.\n\nThe next story is Boo Bop by ‘Mike.’ Does anyone know Mike’s last name?… (Thank you everyone who commented and identified \"Mike\" as Carl \"Mike\" Myer... now he can have proper credit for this clever story idea that actually ended up in production!)\n\nYou can find the film Boo Bop, online to watch --- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbDqon8-804 the story is different from other Casper films… and it’s definitely worth watching. It's clearly based on this story idea. It was produced in 1957 to play in theaters. When Harvey created the TV show Matty’s Funday Funnies, this film appears to have aired on that show along with many other Famous Studios films (Herman and Katnip, Little Audrey, etc.). If you watch this film online you’ll notice the original credits are missing. When the Harveys purchased rights to these characters and films the original credits were replaced with their own opening image. Thanks to Big Cartoon Database I can share with you the missing credits for the Casper film Boo-Bop.\n\nDirected by Seymour Kneitel\n\nAnimated by Tom Golden and Nick Tafuri\n\nWritten by Carl Meyer\n\nMusic by Winston Sharples (and Franz Schubert)\n\nCasper’s voice by Mae Questel (who was best known as the voice of Betty Boop)\n\nIn this case it appears that 'Mike,' who wrote the story idea, is also the one who wrote the final version used in production, and he was properly credited as Carl (\"Mike\") Meyer.\n\nReferences:\n\nBig Cartoon Database\n\nWikipedia\n\n↧\n\nMEET MY MOM!\n\nCollection: V. Mahoney\n\nThat’s my mom, Ruth (Fleischer) Kneitel--- born December 28, 1906 in Brooklyn, New York. It’s always amazed me that when she was growing up women in the United States did not have the right to vote. That wouldn’t happen until 1920, when she was 19 years old.\n\nSince this is the month of her birthday I thought I’d share some of the interesting things about my mother’s life in animation. She was the daughter of an important animation pioneer, and in 1931 she married an animator! She even worked in early animation…\n\nRuth, Essie, Richard (Dick), Max.\n\nCollection: V. Mahoney\n\nAt the time Ruth was born, her father Max had not yet begun his work in animation. (To learn more about Max Fleischer’s amazing career read Out of the Inkwell by his son, Richard Fleischer). Max had a vision that he could improve on the existing crude animation of the day.\n\nIn 1915, when Ruth was nine years old, Max patented the Rotoscope… an invention that created more fluid movement of animated characters. Working together with his brothers, Max created the very first films using that Rotoscope. This event marked the beginning of his career in animation. Since Max had meager funds, he routinely used family in these early films…. aunts, uncles, kids… including Ruth and her younger brother Dick. From these modest beginnings the Fleischers became one of the many immigrant success stories.\n\nOn the way to that success my mom didn’t miss an opportunity to be involved.\n\nRuth testing some dance moves.\n\nCollection: V. Mahoney\n\nIt was natural that Ruth, a fun loving gal, would want to be part of this exciting theatrical life. Trained as a dancer, by her late teens she was dancing on stage in vaudeville chorus lines. In 1925 Max even created a film, Ko-Ko Steps Out, that was built around Ruth and her dancing. In the film, Max is on screen while Ruth appears first on the screen with Max and then appears to jump from the screen to the stage where they interact. It was a combination of film and vaudeville! Here’s a newspaper review that tells a bit of the story. (Red Seal was a film company Max started in 1923 that produced live action comedies as well as animated films.) BTW- I’ve never found a copy of this film.\n\nNewspaper report for Ko-Ko Steps Out\n\nCollection: V. Mahoney\n\nAt the Studio, any event of note was worth a hand drawn cartoon—here’s one (below) they gave to my mother when she was appearing live with Ko-Ko Steps Out at a Rialto Theater in New Jersey.\n\nDrawing by FS staffer for Ruth, Jan. 1926\n\nCollection: V. Mahoney\n\nBelow are some other photos of Red Seal pictures Max made that Ruth appeared in.\n\nMax in center talking to Ruth who is wearing a coat and hat.\n\nThe reverse of this publicity photo from about 1924 reads: “Max Fleischer and a group of the prettiest chorus girls in New York, all of whom are engaged for his new series of two reel comedies, Carrie of the Chorus.” Ruth can be seen in this photo- she's wearing a coat and hat, and talking to Max. In this Carrie film Ruth plays the part of Carrie’s best friend.\n\nRay Bolger photo with inscription to Ruth.\n\nCollection: V. Mahoney\n\nRuth met Ray Bolger when they were both dancing on the same bill at the Paramount Theater. Bolger (later to become famous as the scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz) became a close friend and occasionally Ruth’s on stage dancing partner. Bolger earned his very first film credit when he appeared in this Carrie of the Chorus film.\n\nPublicity photo from Morning Judge. Collection: V. Mahoney'\n\nPublicity photo from Morning Judge. Collection: V. Mahoney\n\nThe two photos above are from another of Max’s Red Seal films, Morning Judge, that was released in 1926. Ruth is on the left side of the first photo. In the second photo Ruth is in the middle, standing in front. I’ve never found a copy of this and have no idea of what is going on in this film!\n\nArticle about Rayburn troupe in St. Louis Star.\n\nCollection: V.Mahoney\n\nBy 1926, when Max’s Red Seal venture was floundering, Ruth joined the Ned Rayburn traveling dance troupe as a chorus girl. Ned Rayburn was famous at the time for producing dancing stars. In the photo above Ruth is standing in the back row third from the left.When appearing on stage she sometimes used the name Ruth Dix…likely a play on the name of her younger brother Dick, who she adored. The Rayburn troupe danced in theaters all over the U.S. Ruth would have been about 20 years old at the time, and her parents, Max and Essie, were not at all happy to have her leading what they considered a wild and questionable life.\n\nTelegram from Ned Rayburn to Ruth forbidding her to smoke! Collection: V. Mahoney\n\n(Click to enlarge for viewing)\n\nJust how racy life was on the road is reflected in the 1927 telegram (above) from Ned Rayburn to Ruth.\n\nWhen Ruth returned home from a Wayburn road tour her mother made it clear that she was NOT to go on the road anymore! But Ruth had no interest in sitting idly home, so she proposed that she’d consider staying only if she could work at Max’s Studio. Max reluctantly agreed….reluctant because he knew the Studio had a staff of basically crazy, wild people, and he worried Ruth might contribute too much to that craziness.\n\nLower portion of 1930-31 Fleischer Studios staff photo. Ruth (Fleischer) is far left, second row up from the bottom. (Click to enlarge for viewing) Collection: V. Mahoney\n\nMuch to Max’s surprise and delight, Ruth became a valuable asset. She worked her way up first to Head of the Opaquing (or painting) department and later she became Head of the Inking Department. She also wrote stories for a number of cartoons. Aside from her success in the office, she was still a girl that loved to party, so she was equally popular with the fun-loving staff.\n\nThe studio is where my parents met, my dad was an animator at the time. They were an unlikely pair since Ruth loved to dance and Seymour couldn’t dance at all. But he was such a nice guy. Ruth at first thought he had a sweetheart since she’d hear him on the phone saying.. ‘hello dear’… I’ll be home soon dear.’ Turned out he was talking to his mother! My dad was in his late teens when his father died, at which point he became the main support of his mother and sister. Animator Shamus Culhane wrote…\"the marriage made no difference in Seymour’s status in the studio. He was never given, nor did he ever ask for, special handling from the management.\"\n\nFamily photo showing (l. to r.) Ruth, Kenny, Tommy, Ginny, Seymour.\n\nCollection: V. Mahoney\n\nMy mom and dad married in December of 1931. Ruth continued to work at the studio until late 1932 while awaiting the birth of their first child, Tommy. Two more children followed, myself in 1936 and Ken in 1941. In the photo above (circa 1945) we're all together in one of those fake photo set-ups.\n\nAlthough Ruth became a stay-at-home mom, she continued to write stories for cartoons and comic books, many of which were used! After my dad died in 1964 she became more active in the animation industry, working to promote a novel 3D process… but that’s another story!\n\n↧\n\nA WILD AND CRAZY PLACE!\n\nCraziness at an animation studio went beyond what the public would see!\n\nSmall drawing from border of 1930-31 FS staff photo\n\nCollection: V. Mahoney\n\nOf course there were gags galore on screen. It’s said that Dave Fleischer, who would oversee Fleischer Studios film production, wanted a gag in EVERY scene. According to animator Shamus Culhane: “Dave was a gagman with a flamboyant disregard for story structure and character motivation. His motto was a gag in every foot, and he would cram one into a scene regardless of the fact that it had very little or no connection with the story line…”\n\nOff screen—nuttiness also invaded the work day!\n\nNew staff hires were ‘tested.’ A typical new staffer was given a bucket and directed to a room to fill the bucket with ‘film sprockets.’ Or they would be sent into a dark room with a female employee –who would close the door and a few minutes later run out screaming!\n\nIn 1938 Fleischer Studios re-located to Florida where flies would abound. When the windows were open staff would catch these flying invaders, one by one, and glue tiny paper airplane wings to their backs--- after which they’d be surrounded overhead by these tiny buzzing airplanes.\n\nCard by Fleischer animator Rudy Zamora\n\nCollection: V. Mahoney\n\nWhether in New York or Florida, Christmas was a big event—for all, no matter what religion you were! Staff made Christmas cards they exchanged with each other. These cards were usually handmade- they might feature someone’s family, or characters from the studio. They might be a bit nutty or even off-color. But the highlight of the year was the party Max and Dave would give for the whole staff, usually in a large restaurant. As the staff grew- the party got bigger since by 1939 there were over 700 employees. These parties were usually wild bashes that included Santa, gag gifts, vaudeville acts by staff, plus the usual eating and drinking (for a full description of one of these wild parties and some actual film footage go to Fleischer Studios Christmas!).\n\nThe 1933 Christmas card above is by animator Dick Huemer. Huemer, (www.huemer.com/animate4.htm) recalled one nutty string of events. It... \"started when I drew big teeth on Koko… Dave started kidding me about it, baring his teeth at me every time I looked at him. Or he would draw an enormous tooth on my drawing paper when my back was turned. Then finally one night on my way home, I put my hand into my pocket and fished out a handful of teeth. Human ones. He’d gotten them from a dentist friend of his. I forgot what my next move was—probably slipping one or two into his dessert at lunch, or some other disgusting thing. And then came the morning when I raised my drawing board to switch on the light and my hand touched something slimy. There, draped over the light bulb, was the lower half of a cow’s jaw, replete with great big yellow teeth and shreds of unhealthy-looking flesh. Naturally I couldn’t let him quit while he was ahead. So I sneaked down to the street when he wasn’t looking and placed the cadaver on the motor of his Ford. I was only sorry I wasn’t there when he started to smell the roast beef on his way home. That kind of ended the whole rib.\"\n\nThe Christmas card above was to Seymour, from the studio group that hung out together and called themselves 'the gang.'\n\nGambling was a big activity for all….my mother said that when she worked at the studio (1929-31) no one went out for lunch – they played poker instead! Going to the race-track together was common—especially after the studio moved to Florida where there were dog races as well as horse races. In the New York studio someone even had a direct wire to the race-track in his office where staffers would routinely gather to check winners and losers.\n\nThey were such big betters that when the studio moved from New York to Florida their bookie moved with them! Max’s wife, Essie, was said to have had a direct wire to her bookie installed in a palm tree on their Florida property…. and Max, although greatly disturbed by the betting that went on during office hours, held a patent on a betting ‘wheel’ (above) he devised for the dog races. Below, Seymour in the middle, at the races.\n\nAnimator Shamus Culhane notes that (in the NY Fleischer days) a brownstone rooming house on 44th St. was completely taken over by Fleischer animators and became the site of the weekly gathering of card playing, drinking, and activity with ladies from the local bordello, who among other things, liked to play bridge. (Of course there were some staffers who led more conventional lives!)\n\nPersonal events—whether surgery or a wedding— usually warranted a hand made card… below, part of a get well card for Max drawn by 'Doc' Crandall.\n\nAnd milestones in the business of the studio were fodder for cartoons in their in-house publications…. Their first feature film \"Gulliver's Travels\" was produced in an incredibly short time frame, and in the midst of the studio move from New York to Florida... their jokes below speak to the insanity of that time... (the top one by Willard Bowsky, the bottom one by Bob Little).\n\nHere’s one more from the the April 1935 copy of their in-house Fleischer Animated News…. about Fleischer and ‘Bisney’ merging. This includes an interesting prediction, likely a far-fetched joke at the time, about their move to Florida... since it was May 1938 before Max and Paramount signed a contract to finance that new Florida building and move!\n\nSeems like they knew how to have fun both on and off screen! If you know of any great stories that have been passed down please post and share in comments below!\n\nMisc. References\n\nTalking Animals and Other People by Shamus Culhane\n\n↧\n\n↧"
