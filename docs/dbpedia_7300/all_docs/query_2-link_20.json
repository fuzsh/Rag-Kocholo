        "text": "It was during this period that the Fleischers partnered with Lee DeForest, a pioneer in the fledgling field of sound technology, to create the first cartoon using synchronized sound, My Old Kentucky Home, which was released in 1926 (nearly two years before Walt Disney’s 1928 Steamboat Willy, which is often erroneously attributed this distinction). The film also included another of the Fleischers’ early innovations, the “bouncing ball,” which provided audiences with the lyrics and rhythm of music so they could sing along.\n\nThe popularity of Fleischer films exploded once again with the creation of Betty Boop, who first appeared in 1930 in Dizzy Dishes. Then in 1932, the Fleischers secured the rights to animate an already well-known comic strip character by the name of Popeye. While the Fleischers didn’t create Popeye, (or Olive Oyl, Bluto or Wimpy), they did provide him with some of his most iconic traits including his use of spinach to acquire super human strength and his trademark “I’m Popeye the Sailor Man” song.\n\nUnlike other cartoon “stars” of the day, Fleischer characters like Betty Boop, Grampy, and Koko the Clown were modeled on human beings. With their surreal, edgy, often gritty, urban setting the Fleischers were part of what was referred to as the ‘East Coast Style of Animation’ as opposed to the ‘West Coast Style’ of animators, like Disney, that tended to feature farm animals and settings.\n\nToday, Fleischer Studios is alive and thriving thanks to the timeless appeal and popularity of characters like Betty Boop, a resurgence of interest in the Fleischers and their numerous innovations, some of which, like the rotoscope and the bouncing ball, are still in use today, and a growing appreciation for the many lasting contributions their work has made to our cultural history.\n\nTo learn more about the studio, its people, and the stories behind the scenes, visit our online Museum and watch some of the amazing and wild films in the Theater section. The Fleischer Studios website, like the studio itself, is growing and ever-changing so check back often."
