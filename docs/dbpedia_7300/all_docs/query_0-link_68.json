        "text": "THE LANDMARK ANIMATED MAN OF STEEL SHORTS ARE NEWLY REMASTERED\n\nFROM ORIGINAL 35MM NEGATIVES\n\nAVAILABLE TO PURCHASE DIGITALLY AND ON BLU-RAYTM MAY 16, 2023\n\n#MaxFleischerSuperman\n\nBURBANK, CA (March 8, 2023) – Warner Bros. Discovery has meticulously remastered Max Fleischer’s treasured set of 17 animated Superman shorts from the original 35mm source elements. Max Fleischer’s Superman 1941-1943 will be available to purchase Digitally on HD and on Blu-ray May 16, 2023.\n\nSuperman made his comic book debut in 1938, appearing in Action Comics #1 (dated June 1938, but officially published on April 18, 1938), and the Man of Steel’s popularity grew with his subsequent radio program. Max Fleischer gave the world’s first Super Hero his initial animated spotlight, producing 17 theatrical animated shorts from September 1941 to July 1943 that further elevated the character’s profile, and added many significant aspects to his canon – including coining many of Superman’s patented catchphrases and attributes.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery’s advanced remastering process began with a 4K, 16-bit scan of Fleischer’s original 35mm successive exposure negative. Staying true to the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.37-to-1, the highest quality raw image was then scanned and then entered into the recombine process – utilizing special proprietary software to merge the successive exposure Technicolor negatives into a single RGB color image. The end result are pristine animated shorts that have been restored to the animators’ originally intended production quality.\n\nWell known radio actors Clayton “Bud” Collyer and Joan Alexander reprised their famed The Adventures of Supermanradio show roles for the Fleischer/Famous Studios animated shorts as Superman/ Clark Kent and Lois Lane, respectively. Jackson Beck provided the voice of Perry White and the show’s primary narrator. Additional voices, many of whom had participated in the Superman radio program, were provided by Jack Mercer, Grant Richards, Julian Noa, Lee Royce, Max Smith, Sam Parker and Carl Meyer.\n\nMax Fleischer’s Superman 1941-1943 will be available on May 16, 2023 to purchase Digitally in HD from Amazon Prime Video, AppleTV, Google Play, Vudu and more, and on Blu-ray at major retailers both online and in-store.\n\nEPISODES (AND PREMIERE DATE):\n\nSuperman (Mad Scientist) – 9/26/1941\n\nThe Mechanical Monsters – 11/28/1941\n\nBillion Dollar Limited – 1/9/1942\n\nArctic Giant – 2/27/1942\n\nThe Bulleteers – 3/27/1942\n\nThe Magnetic Telescope – 4/24/1942\n\nElectric Earthquake – 5/15/1942\n\nVolcano – 7/10/1942\n\nTerror on the Midway – 8/28/1942\n\nThe Japoteurs – 9/18/1942\n\nShowdown – 10/16/1942\n\nThe Eleventh Hour – 11/20/1942\n\nDestruction, Inc. – 12/25/1942\n\nThe Mummy Strikes – 2/19/1943\n\nJungle Drums – 3/26/1943\n\nUnderground World – 6/18/1943\n\nSecret Agent – 7/30/1943\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDE:\n\nNew Featurette – Superman: Speeding Toward Tomorrow – Superman’s exploits in the Fleischer series modernized the monomyth of the Greek godlike hero and expanded and romanticized the prevalent themes of sci-fi and fantasy.
