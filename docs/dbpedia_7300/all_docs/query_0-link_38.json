Ann Powers of The New York Times reviewed the concert, \"Some singers can make each performance seem like a whispered disclosure, offered in love and trust. Such intimacy comes not from technical perfection but from the careful exploitation of individual quirks, the deployment of range and tone to express personality. Joan Armatrading, the veteran English singer-songwriter who appeared at Town Hall on Wednesday night, is a masterly creator of such artistic confidences.\"\n\nEddie Izzard begins 3 Night Stint\n\nAfter a sold-out tour of the UK, British comedian Eddie Izzard brough his hilarious one-man show Circle to Town Hall for three nights from June 22-26, 2000.

J. Harvey and Nick Cave.\n\nStephen Holden from The New York Times wrote in his review of her performance, \"To hear Marianne Faithfull spit out John Lennon's Working Class Hero in her ravaged, all-knowing sneer is to discover how a great song can accrue sharper meanings over time. ... Ms. Faithfull, who recorded Working Class Hero on her classic 1979 album \"Broken English,\" has long since settled comfortably into her persona of the debauched fallen aristocrat, a faux Victorian princess exiled from polite society, flaunting her scarlet letter as she ravenously prowls the land, an arrogant pariah. It is only pop mythology, of course, but Ms. Faithfull still plays the role for all it's worth, infusing it with considerable humor.\"\n\nGilberto Gil and David Byrne\n\nGilberto Gil, one of the stars of the tropicalia movement, which revolutionized Brazilian pop, performed at Town Hall on a double bill with American Pop star and visionary David Byrne.\n\nIn the 1960's, Gilberto's iconoclasm and cosmopolitan ambition marked him as a troublemaker; Mr. Gil was imprisoned and exiled by Brazil's military government.
