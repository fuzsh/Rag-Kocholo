Without warning, 35-year-old Manny becomes ill and dies.\n\nFor years, his children believe he had died from a cerebral hemorrhage, but the true cause of death was respiratory failure induced by an injection of morphine to halt an epileptic seizure. Diana Streisand, overcome with grief, takes Sheldon and 15-month-old Barbara and moves into her parents' home on 365 Pulaski Street in Williamsburg Brooklyn.\n\n1946-49\n\nBarbara goes to school at the Yeshiva of Brooklyn.
