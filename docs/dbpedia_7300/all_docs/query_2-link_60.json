        "text": "Established 1946, Famous Studios is looking to connect with millennials with its newest services. Famous Working Company is set up to be an innovative and creative coworking spaces, offering shooting infrastructure for the millennial workforce.\n\nCoworking spaces, the future of the workplace, have mushroomed across India at an astounding speed. With over 850 coworking spaces, most concentrated in Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, and over 179 in Tier II and III cities, India is the second largest market for flexible workspaces in APAC, second only to China. Reason enough for Mumbai’s iconic Famous Studios to launch Famous Working Company (FWC), a coworking space that aims to foster creativity and offer creators “access to the entire spectrum of services that cater to their art”.\n\nThe 73-year old studio, located in Mahalaxmi, aims to step into the future by combining creativity and innovation, and helping Gen Y build companies “that are forever inventing new ways to tell great stories”.\n\n“Members of the coworking space have access to shooting stages, in-house motion capture facility, the Phantom Flex Lab, ready-to-shoot sets, and the editing suite at a discounted price,” says Anant Roongta, Founder and Director of Famous Working Company.\n\nAnant is a third-generation entrepreneur, and the grandson of JB Roongta, the Founder of Famous Studios.\n\nAlong with all the other facilities that a usual coworking space provides, FWC offers facilities like a private 55-seated movie theater, a sound recording studio, studio spaces for shootings and events, “ready-made content spaces” such as a walk-in closet, beauty terminal, kitchen, interview set, and access to events and concerts at Famous Studios.\n\nLights, camera, action\n\nThe era of studios dawned in early 20th century, after Dadasaheb Phalke made India’s first film, Raja Harishchandra, in 1913. Phalke later moved to Nashik, where he established Hindustan Films, a studio that offered every facility —locations, actors, technicians, and post-production - under one roof. Soon after, other studios came up in Mumbai, Kolkata, Pune, Chennai, and Lahore (then part of undivided India). Mumbai houses numerous studios currently, including iconic ones such as RK Studio (now sold) and Mehboob Studio.\n\nRead more here"
