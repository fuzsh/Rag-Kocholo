The Fleischers invented the rotoscoping process, still in use today, in which a strip of live-action footage can be traced and redrawn as a cartoon. The Fleischers exploited this technique in their pioneering series Out of the Inkwell (1919–29). It was this series, with its lively interaction between human and drawn figures, that Disney struggled to imitate with his early Alice cartoons.\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 16, 2024, 5:19 AM ET (The Hollywood Reporter)\n\nAI Is Coming For Our Kids (or at Least Their TV Shows)\n\nBut if Disney was Mother Goose and Norman Rockwell, the Fleischers (Max produced, Dave directed) were stride piano and red whiskey. Their extremely urban, overcrowded, sexually suggestive, and frequently nightmarish work—featuring the curvaceous torch singer Betty Boop and her two oddly infantile colleagues, Bimbo the Dog and Koko the Clown—charts a twisty route through the American subconscious of the 1920s and ’30s, before collapsing into Disneyesque cuteness with the features Gulliver’s Travels (1939) and Mr. Bug Goes to Town (1941; also released as Hoppity Goes to Town). The studio’s mainstay remained the relatively impersonal Popeye series, based on the comic strip created by Elzie Segar. The spinach-loving sailor was introduced as a supporting player in the Betty Boop cartoon Popeye the Sailor (1933) and quickly ascended to stardom, surviving through 105 episodes until the 1942 short Baby Wants a Bottleship, when the Fleischer studio collapsed and rights to the character passed to Famous Studios.\n\n“Termite Terrace”\n\nLess edgy than the Fleischers but every bit as anarchic were the animations produced by the Warner Bros. cartoon studio, known to its residents as “Termite Terrace.” The studio was founded by three Disney veterans, Rudolph Ising, Hugh Harmon, and Friz Freleng, but didn’t discover its identity until Tex Avery, fleeing the Walter Lantz studio at Universal, joined the team as a director. Avery was young and irreverent, and he quickly recognized the talent of staff artists such as Chuck Jones, Bob Clampett, and Bob Cannon. Together they brought a new kind of speed and snappiness to the Warners product, beginning with Gold Diggers of ’49 (1936). With the addition of director Frank Tashlin, musical director Carl W. Stalling, and voice interpreter Mel Blanc, the team was in place to create a new kind of cartoon character: cynical, wisecracking, and often violent, who, refined through a series of cartoons, finally emerged as Bugs Bunny in Tex Avery’s A Wild Hare (1940). Other characters, some invented and some reinterpreted, arrived, including Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Tweety and Sylvester, Pepe LePew, Foghorn Leghorn, Road Runner, and Wile E. Coyote. Avery left Warner Brothers and in 1942 joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer’s moribund animation unit, where, if anything, his work became even wilder in films such as Red Hot Riding Hood (1943) and Bad Luck Blackie (1949)."
