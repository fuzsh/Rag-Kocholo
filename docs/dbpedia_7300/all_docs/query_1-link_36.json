Season and individual event tickets for the general public go on sale Tuesday, April 2nd @ 10:00am.\n\nAlan (aka “Al”) Jardine, guitarist, vocalist and songwriter, is best known for being one of the founding members of the California-based group The Beach Boys. Al was born in Lima, Ohio, on September 3, 1942 and met Brian, Carl and Dennis Wilson, Mike Love and David Marks after his family moved to Hawthorne, California. Al played mainly rhythm guitar and sang harmony vocals with The Beach Boys and sang lead on their No. 1 hit “Help Me, Rhonda.” In 1988, Al was inducted into the Rock ’n’ Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Beach Boys and in 2001, he was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award Grammy along with the other Beach Boys.\n\nIn 2010, Al released his first studio album, A Postcard From California, which featured guest appearances from Neil Young, Stephen Stills, David Crosby, Steve Miller, Glen Campbell, Gerry Beckley & Dewey Bunnell (America) and Flea (Red Hot Chili Peppers), plus all the remaining Beach Boys. The environmentally-themed album features Al’s originals “Don’t Fight The Sea,” “Looking Down The Coast” and “San Simeon” in addition to new versions of classic Beach Boys songs “Help Me, Rhonda” and “California Saga.” The album was re-released to a worldwide audience in 2022 from Universal Music.\n\nIn 2024, Al continues to tour with his Endless Summer Band with a special show he calls Al Jardine’s Family & Friends, featuring Carnie and Wendy Wilson (from Wilson Phillips), his son Matt Jardine plus Rob Bonfiglio (from Brian Wilson’s band), Debbie Shair (from the band Heart) and longtime Beach Boys backing band members Ed Carter and Bobby Figueroa. Matt has received rave reviews for his stunning lead vocals on songs like “Good Vibrations,” “Don’t Worry Baby” and “Surf’s Up.”\n\nAl’s setlist includes all of the legendary hits of The Beach Boys including “Help Me, Rhonda,” “California Girls,” “Sloop John B,” “God Only Knows,” “I Get Around,” “Surfin’ USA” and “Fun Fun Fun” plus the Wilson Phillips hits “Hold On” and “Impulsive.” Al Jardine’s Family & Friends show has received amazing reviews over the years and is truly an event not to be missed!"
