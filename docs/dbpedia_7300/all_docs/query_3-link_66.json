        "text": "GARY CLYDE SALZMAN May 25, 1942 – Feb. 7, 2020\n\nGary was called the “Energizer Bunny” on many occasions, because people noticed he just kept going, and going, and going. That applied to the many, and varied, projects he worked on. He liked to see things through to their completion, and he pressed on to accomplish that goal.\n\nUnfortunately, the rare, and lethal, undifferentiated anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, that he had been valiantly fighting, finally stopped him dead in his tracks. He succumbed to it on February 7 at the age of 77.\n\nGary inherited a keen intellect and a kind heart from his parents, Amy and Harvey Salzman, who taught him the value of hard work and perseverance.\n\nGary was always generous and helpful to everyone he encountered. He was a life-long learner. If he didn’t know how to do something, he would find out. He loved adventure, and he had the opportunity to do more things than most. In the 1960s he spent a couple of years teaching science at a secondary school in Ghana, West Africa, as a Peace Corps Volunteer. He drew up the plans for, and helped build, his own house in the 1970s. He spent lots of time leading his family on camping adventures not only in this country, but in Mexico, Canada, and Europe as well. Travel became a passion, and he was able to visit many unusual places. His planning skills for self-guided trips to places like Ukraine, Belize, Croatia, Nigeria, Iceland, New Zealand and Argentina were superb. Over his lifetime he visited more than fifty different countries. He thoroughly enjoyed meeting their citizens and learning about their cultures. He found that people everywhere had the same basic desires for themselves and their families. Similarities definitely outweighed differences.\n\nHe always maintained a love of science. He majored in physics at the University of California in Berkeley where he earned a BS degree. That was followed by getting both an MS and Ph.D. in physics at the University of Oregon in Eugene. He had a fulfilling career at Los Alamos National Laboratory where his interests changed from pure physics to biophysics. He was in on the ground floor of the development of the technology relating to flow cytometry. The machines themselves, and the analysis of data from them, have become clinical tools that are now widely used for cancer diagnosis. It was interesting to watch the doctors, who treated him at M D Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. They leaned in a little closer while their eyes widened when listening to him tell of his role in the development stage of an important technology with which they are all very familiar.\n\nHe leaves his loving wife, Joan, whom he met on a trail in Yosemite National Park when they were seventeen years old. They just celebrated their 55th anniversary. They continued traveling and hiking together until the end. Along the way they even co-authored a hiking book. In addition, he leaves his beloved children, Sonja (David) and Eric (Andrea), who have given him much pleasure as he watched them become interesting and accomplished adults. His grandchildren, Vivian, Adam and Brandon were special to him, because he had time to really enjoy being with them during his retirement years. He was the oldest of six children, and he is survived by four of them – Shirley (Bruce), Amy (Mike), Sally and Steve (Joan). A sister, Mary, who was killed in a hiking accident on Mt. Kilimanjaro, predeceased him. His brothers-in-law, Roger (Tony) and Roy (Russell) were also a close part of his extended family.\n\nHe mentioned often how fortunate he felt to have ended up living in Los Alamos, New Mexico for more than forty-eight years. He enjoyed the uncrowded conditions of the small town that is populated by intellectually stimulating people. Over the years many of them became close friends. He loved being in a place with such diverse physical surroundings. Mountains and valleys were always calling for another adventure.\n\nGary was very appreciative of all the helpful, knowledgeable people who oversaw his recent treatments and care. It was a team effort that helped extend his life nearly a year beyond what was originally predicted. He took full advantage of that gift of extra time. Not many ever venture to Uzbekistan, but even fewer do it in his condition. Though family living there was the real pull, he thoroughly enjoyed seeing the Silk Road cities of which legends are made. He also enjoyed all the other trips taken after his original diagnosis. More fun things were packed into that short time than many people experience in a full life. When he was home he was sustained by the attention of local friends as well as notes and calls from those afar. His devoted family was always at his side or only a call away. His was a life well lived, and he will be missed by many. He left a trail of fine memories for those who were fortunate enough to have known him.\n\nA celebration of his life will be held to commemorate his 78th birthday. This year May 25 falls on Memorial Day.\n\nArrangements through Rivera Family Funerals & Cremations of Los Alamos, 1627 A Central Ave, Los Alamos, NM 87544 (505) 663-6880 www.riverafamilyfuneralhome.com"
