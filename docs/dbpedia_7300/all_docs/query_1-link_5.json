        "text": "Paramount Cartoon Studios (PCS) was the original animation division of Paramount Pictures.\n\nHistory\n\nPCS was the production company behind several animated TV series, including Felix the Cat, Popeye the Sailor (as one of five contributing studios), The New Casper Cartoon Show, The Marvel Superheroes (as a contributor of the segment The Mighty Thor) and King Features Trilogy (as one of four contributing studios).\n\nThe company was founded on May 25, 1942 as Famous Studios after Paramount acquired the assets of the Fleischer Studios animation company from its founders, brothers Max and Dave Fleischer. Under Paramount ownership (though it continued as a separately managed company), Famous Studios continued production of its theatrical cartoon shorts, including Popeye, Superman and Casper the Friendly Ghost. In 1955, Paramount sold most of Famous' output to U.M. & M. TV Corporation (and its later successor company National Telefilm Associates), while its Popeye shorts were purchased by Associated Artists Productions (which was later absorbed into United Artists Television) and its Superman shorts went to Motion Pictures for Television.\n\nFamous Studios developed series titles for their cartoons, which included Noveltoons, Screen Songs (which later became Kartoon Musical Shorts), Go-Go Toons, Merry Makers, Fractured Fables and Modern Madcaps.\n\nIn October 1956, Paramount assumed full control of Famous Studios, renamed it as Paramount Cartoon Studios and made it a division of the film studio. In 1959, Paramount sold their remaining cartoon film library and the rights to their established characters (including Casper, Baby Huey and Herman and Katnip) to Harvey Comics (now part of NBCUniversal via DreamWorks Classics). Paramount (including PCS) was purchased in 1966 by Gulf+Western, which shut down PCS in December 1967.\n\nList of Famous Studios/Paramount Cartoon Studios stars\n\nPopeye the Sailor (1942-57 theatrical, 1960-63 made-for-TV)1\n\nSuperman (1942-43)1\n\nLittle Lulu (1943-48 theatrical, 1962 made-for-TV)\n\nSpunky Donkey (1944-58)\n\nCasper the Friendly Ghost (1945-59 theatrical, 1963-64 made-for-TV)\n\nBuzzy the Crow (1947-54)\n\nHerman and Katnip (1947-59; Herman appeared in stand-alone cartoons 1944-53)\n\nLittle Audrey (1948-58)\n\nBaby Huey (1951-59)\n\nTommy Tortoise and Moe Hare (1953-57)\n\nFelix the Cat (1958; contributing studio)\n\nJeepers and Creepers (1960)\n\nKrazy Kat (1961, 1963; contributing studio)\n\nGoodie the Gremlin (1962-63)\n\nThe Mighty Hercules (1963-66; contributing studio)\n\nThe Cat (1963)\n\nMuggy-Doo, Boy Cat (1963 short \"Boy Pest With Osh\"; redeveloped in 1965 by Hal Seeger as Muggy-Doo, Boy Fox for The Milton The Monster Show)\n\nSnuffy Smith (1963, contributing studio)\n\nBeetle Bailey (1963, contributing studio)\n\nSwifty and Shorty (1962-65, billed as Ralph and Percy in their first three cartoons)\n\nNudnik (1965-67)\n\nHoney Halfwitch (1965-67)\n\nMarvel Superheroes (1965; Mighty Thor segments)\n\n1--Inherited from Fleischer Studios."
