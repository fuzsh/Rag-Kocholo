        "text": "Background\n\nThe Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio (also known as MGM Cartoons) was the in-house division of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) film studio in Hollywood, responsible for producing animated shorts to accompany MGM feature films in Loew's Theaters. Founded in 1937 after gaining full-control of Harman-Ising Productions although both men eventually became rehired, the cartoon studio created some popular cartoon characters, including Tom and Jerry, Droopy and Barney Bear. By 1957, the studio closed due the decline of short subjects in theaters. Most of the staff formed another studio known as H-B Enterprises. The leftovers of the complete CinemaScope MGM cartoons were released for theatrical release until August 1958. The Tom and Jerry series went on hiatus for two years until Gene Deitch revived the cat and mouse team in 1960. The studio would be succeeded by Sib Tower 12 Productions (renamed MGM Animation/Visual Arts in 1966), founded in 1962 by Chuck Jones, a former Warner Bros. Cartoons employee. The MGM cartoon library is now owned by Turner Entertainment Co. along with the pre-1986 MGM library.\n\nAlthough the studio went defunct in 1957, MGM continued to use the \"MGM Cartoons\" name onscreen until 1967.\n\n1st Logo (September 27, 1930-July 18, 1942)\n\nVisuals: Just the standard MGM live-action lion logo used at the time.\n\nClosing Title: On a blue background (later changed to red on April 18, 1942), there are the words \"The End\" in white (later yellow with a \"shadow\" effect starting on September 7, 1940) script above the MGM pseudo logo saying \"A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer PICTURE\".\n\nUb Iwerks Closing Titles:\n\n1930-1933: On a black background is the text \"The End\". The MGM pseudo logo is shown on the bottom right. Sometimes, the MGM pseudo logo is absent.\n\n1933: On a black background is the text \"The End\" in an arched script and below it is Willie Whopper himself and the show's title and below is the MGM pseudo logo.\n\n1933-1934: Almost the same as first one, except \"The End\" is shown in a curved font, arched above the logo.\n\n1934: On a gray sunburst background, there is a sad image of Willie himself. Behind it is the words \"THE End\" and the MGM pseudo logo is shown below the logo.\n\nHarman-Ising Closing Titles:\n\n1934-1935: On a red or green background with musical notes swirling, the Harman-Ising Productions logo appears on the top of the screen. Below it are the big words \"The End\", in white, and on the bottom of the screen are the words \"Recorded by RCA Victor \"HIGH FIDELITY\" Sound System\". After a few seconds, the \"The End\" text fades to the MGM marquee.\n\n1935-1937: Now, on a blue or white background, the MGM marquee is tacked on the top of the screen and the Harman-Ising logo in the middle with the words \"IN TECHNICOLOR\" below it. The \"RCA Victor\" words remain at the bottom of the logo. After a few seconds, all of this fades to the words \"The End\".\n\n1937-1938: Now is the Harman-Ising logo and the MGM marquee is shown below the logo. Sometimes, the text \"THE END\" is shown above the logo.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn two Count Screwloose cartoons, the logo is followed by a gray spotlight background with the text \"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer presents\" and below is the text \"AN MGM CARTOON\" in a large font, and a copyright stamp is shown below the logo.\n\nStarting in 1939 with \"The Little Goldfish\", the logo is followed by a screen saying \"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer presents AN MGM CARTOON IN TECHNICOLOR\" with the copyright disclaimer below on a blue background.\n\nStarting in 1942 with the Tom and Jerry cartoon \"Dog Trouble\", the title is put on a red background with \"IN TECHNICOLOR\" in blue.\n\nOn the Captain and the Kids series, plus \"Jitterbug Follies\" and \"Wanted: No Master\", the end title is in black & white.\n\nOn \"Peace on Earth\", a slightly different end title was used. On a sky background, the words \"The End\" don't appear at all. Instead, the cartoon's title appears in majestic letters.\n\nOn \"Swing Social\", the end title is on an orange background. Same goes with the \"AN MGM CARTOON\" title.\n\nOn \"The Homeless Flea\", the end title is on an animation background with Homer the Flea singing.\n\nOn \"Papa Gets the Bird\", the end title is on an animation background with Papa Bear falling in the well.\n\nOn \"Home on the Range\", the end title has the words \"The End\" written in ropecast.\n\nOn \"Dance of the Weed\", the end title is on an orange pound background with the words \"The End\" written differently.\n\nOn \"The Little Mole\", \"THE END\" is written over the ocean. The MGM pseudo logo is absent here.\n\nOn \"Abdul the Bulbul-Ameer\", the end title is on a book cover with the red words \"THE END\" written in a bold Algerian font.\n\nOn the Tom and Jerry cartoon \"The Night Before Christmas\", the end title is on a red background with green Christmas bells surrounding it.\n\nOn \"The First Swallow\", the end title is on a shot of a medieval village with the red words \"The End\" written in medieval letters.\n\nDuring WWII, the \"The End\" words were moved to the top of the screen and the pseudo logo was moved to the bottom, to give space for the following advertisement: \"AMERICA NEEDS YOUR MONEY\n\nBUY DEFENSE BONDS AND STAMPS\n\nEVERY PAY DAY\"\n\nOn the Barney Bear cartoon \"The Bear and the Beavers\", the end title is in the form of a page. Then the WWII disclaimer fades onto the screen.\n\nTechnique: Live-action footage, with a printed graphic composited over it.\n\nAudio: Originally, this logo did not have music at first, just the soundbite of Coffee, Telly or Tanner's roar. Starting with the 1939 cartoon \"The Little Goldfish\", Tanner's roar is accompanied by a fanfare (a la the Alfred Newman-composed 20th Century Fox Fanfare) composed by Scott Bradley, MGM's principal cartoon conductor. This music would be modified as the years went on.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn the Captain and the Kids series, the Flip the Frog cartoons, \"Swing Social\" and \"The Bear and the Beavers\", the theme of the cartoon is played over the logo.\n\nOn original Flip the Frog cartoons from 1930 to 1932, no roar is heard.\n\nAvailability: Appears on all MGM cartoons until \"The Bowling Alley-Cat\".\n\nIt can be seen when cartoons in the Turner library were rerun on TCM (mainly The Captain and the Kids). It can also bee occasionally seen on MeTV, as part of Toon In With Me or Saturday Morning Cartoons.\n\nYou might also see this logo on some tapes.\n\nThe WWII end variant appeared on \"The Hungry Wolf\", \"The Bear and the Beavers\", \"Dog Trouble\", \"Little Gravel Voice\", \"Puss n' Toots\", \"Bats in the Belfry\" and \"The Bowling Alley-Cat\" (all released in 1942).\n\nThe Jackie logo premiered on the Flip the Frog cartoon \"The Village Barber\", released on September 27, 1930 and made its final appearance on \"Wanted: No Master\", released on March 18, 1939.\n\nThe Coffee logo premiered on the Happy Harmonies cartoon \"The Discontented Canary\", released on September 1, 1934 and made its final appearance on the Happy Harmonies cartoon \"Barnyard Babies\", released on May 25, 1935.\n\nThe Tanner logo premiered on the Happy Harmonies cartoon \"The Old Plantation\", released on September 21, 1935 and made its final appearance on the Tom and Jerry cartoon \"The Bowling Alley-Cat\", released on July 18, 1942.\n\nThis logo (with Tanner) was used on the earliest Tom and Jerry cartoons, but the much more common reissue prints replace this with the 3rd, 4th, or 5th logos, or on a few occasions, the 6th logo.\n\nAll Flip the Frog cartoons (with the exception of \"Fiddlesticks\"), alongside most Willie Whopper cartoons and the Happy Harmonies cartoon \"To Spring\" are in the public domain, so it should be easy to find on those.\n\nThis doesn't appear on the first two Flip the Frog cartoons, since they had been released by Celebrity Productions before MGM started holding the distribution rights to the series.\n\n2nd Logo (August 22, 1942-August 3, 1946)\n\nVisuals: Tanner acts as usual, except the standard ribbon is maya blue, the drama mask is maroon and is placed on a red/golden yellow sunburst background with a large grin. Below the lion ribboning is \"A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" in its signature font, and then \"CARTOON\" in a big maya blue bold font. \"IN TECHNICOLOR\" appears underneath. \"TRADE MARK\" has been removed.\n\nClosing Title: After the \"The End\" card is shown in yellow script on a blue background, it fades to \"A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Cartoon\" in the same script font. The pseudo \"A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer PICTURE\" logo is shown below.\n\nTom and Jerry Closing Title: Starting with \"Baby Puss\", a special closing title was instituted for the Tom and Jerry cartoons (which would become popular over the years). On a red background with an orange sunburst are the words \"The End\", written in white with a turquoise outline. This then fades to the words \"An M.G.M Tom and Jerry CARTOON\". Also, the MGM pseudo logo is absent.\n\nVariants:\n\nOn the first few cartoons with this logo (except for \"Blitz Wolf\"), the words \"The End\" were moved to the top of the screen and the pseudo logo was moved to the bottom, to give space for the following advertisement:\n\n\"AMERICA NEEDS YOUR MONEY\n\nBUY WAR BONDS AND STAMPS\n\nAT THIS THEATRE\"\n\nlike on the previous logo and the \"A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Cartoon\" secondary end title doesn't appear. The background is red with a shadowy statue of a Continental soldier behind the titles.\n\nA special end title was used on \"Blitz Wolf\". After the cartoon ends, the pictures irises out to a blue circle, a white one and a red one. Then, a more humorous version of the WWII text is used (adding \"of Adolf\" to \"The End\" in reference to the end of that short). Due to the mean-spirited nature of the reworded \"bond\" text, a result of America's patriotism, this end title is cut from most TV airings.\n\nOn the Barney Bear cartoon \"Wild Honey\", the end title is on a red background.\n\nOn \"The Boy and the Wolf\", the end title is on a rainbow-like background.\n\nOn \"The Shooting of Dan McGoo\", the end title is on a mountain background.\n\nOn the public domain print of \"Jerky Turkey\", \"IN TECHNICOLOR\" is blacked out.\n\nOn the Barney Bear cartoon \"Bear Raid Warden\" and the Screwy Squirrel cartoon \"Big Heel-Watha\" (both 1944), the MGM pseudo logo is dropped on the \"A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Cartoon\" secondary end title due to an error.\n\nTwo Screwy Squirrel cartoons, \"Happy-Go-Nutty\" and \"The Screwy Truant\", have end title card gags:\n\n\"Happy-Go-Nutty\": Screwy Squirrel and Meathead are chasing when they stop in front of an end title card on a black background, with the words \"The End\" in green. They realize that it is the end of the picture. They say goodbye to each other and Screwy says \"Hey! Before you leave, just what was the idea chasing me over the picture?\". Meathead says \"Because you're crazy. You take your appointment. But your ace. I'm crazy.\" Then Meathead begins to \"screw\" himself and runs from the cartoon breaking the title card. Then the screen zooms in to Screwy, who says \"You know, I like this ending. It's silly\". Then the cartoon ends and the typical \"A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Cartoon\" card appears.\n\n\"The Screwy Truant\": Screwy Squirrel brings down a title card on a water blue background with the words \"THE END\" and says: \"Well, that's that. Now that dumb officer never will know why I wasn't in school.\" Then the officer comes in and says: \"Oh yeah? Come on, now! Why wasn't you in school?\". Then Screwy replies \"Because... I've got measles!\" and kisses the officer, causing him to get the measles as well. Screwy laughs at him and the screen zooms up to the words \"THE END\", which also get the measles. This irises out and the regular \"A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Cartoon\" card fades in.\n\nTechnique: Live-action footage, with a printed graphic composited over it.\n\nAudio: A modified version of the first logo's fanfare.\n\nAudio Variant: Several Tex Avery cartoons would have Tanner roar in-sync with the music called \"Tiger Rag\" a.k.a. \"Hold That Tiger\".\n\nAudio Variant Trivia: The \"Tiger Rag\" that's played on several Tex Avery cartoons is based on the jazz music of the same name by Louis Armstrong and his All-Stars.\n\nAvailability: It premiered on \"Blitz Wolf\", released on August 22, 1942 and made its final appearance on \"Northwest Hounded Police\", released on August 3, 1946.\n\nA few Tex Avery cartoons from the era do air on TCM and MeTV.\n\nAgain, MGM edited its logos seamlessly enough that many people can't even tell that the logo was changed.\n\nThe WWII end variant appeared on \"The Early Bird Dood It!\", \"Chips Off the Old Block\" and \"Fine Feathered Friend\" (all released in 1942).\n\nThis logo was also used on many Tom and Jerry cartoons, but the much more common reissue prints use the 3rd, 4th, and 5th logos.\n\nLegacy: As said in the legacy section of the 6th MGM logo, those who grew up on Tom and Jerry consider Tanner a favorite. Same applies with the other logos. The logos had also been fondly recognized by those that admire the directorial works of Tex Avery.\n\n3rd Logo (August 31, 1946-May 17, 1952)\n\nVisuals: The standard lion logo as before, but the ribboning has been simplified and is now red; the \"ARS GRATIA ARTIS\" phrase is missing, along with the drama mask. Below the logo is \"A METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER\" in a bold bright yellow font, with a giant \"CARTOON\" below it in the same color. \"COLOR BY Technicolor\" (with \"Technicolor\" in script) follows, and the whole thing is on an upsdell red background. From 1946-1947, the words \"In Technicolor\" were seen below the logo.\n\nClosing Title: A modified version of the 2nd logo, with a thicker font and a new placement for the word \"CARTOON\". Starting in 1950, the title was changed with \"A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" now in white letters and in different font and \"CARTOON\" in red letters and in different font as well. \"MADE IN HOLLYWOOD, U.S.A.\" also appears at the bottom of the screen in white letters. Also, the MGM pseudo is dropped.\n\nTom and Jerry Closing Title: Same as the previous logo. Around 1948-49, the end title has been slightly fixed to add a border to \"and\", and the dots in between \"M.G.M\". Starting in 1950 with \"Safety Second\", the words \"MADE IN HOLLYWOOD, U.S.A.\" appear at the bottom of the screen. Shortly after, a drop shadow has been added to \"An\" and the Hollywood phrase.\n\nJohn Sutherland Closing Title: Same as above, but only the words \"The End\" in thin white outlines and red colored letters was shown and \"MADE IN HOLLYWOOD, U.S.A.\" appears at the bottom of the screen in white letters.\n\nVariants:\n\nThe final theatrical George and Junior cartoon, \"Half-Pint Pygmy\", has the duo holding up guns to their head. George pulls a blue \"The End\" background down and two gunshots are heard, shaking the card.\n\nOn the reissue print of \"The Blue Danube\", the end title is on the same blue backdrop used in the opening credits.\n\nOn \"Little 'Tinker\", the end title is on a red background.\n\nA black and white variant exists on prints of said colors. The logo is on a black background, the letters are now flat and the \"COLOR BY Technicolor\" text is omitted.\n\nTechnique: Live-action footage, with a printed graphic composited over it.\n\nAudio: An updated version of the fanfare from the first logo; by now, it began blending into the opening themes of the cartoons.\n\nAvailability: It premiered on the Tom and Jerry cartoon \"Solid Serenade\", released on August 31, 1946 and made its final appearance on \"One Cab's Family\", released on May 17, 1952.\n\nIt also plasters previous logos on to films it didn't originally appear on, as well.\n\nEdited appearances of \"The Cat That Hated People\" in Hollywood Studios' Sci-Fi Theater in Walt Disney World have the opening logo cut off (likely to avoid any mention of another film company in a Disney Park, even though Hollywood Studios was formerly known as Disney-MGM Studios) but retain the closing logo.\n\nThe John Sutherland variant was seen on \"Albert in Blunderland\" (1950), but the opening version uses the standard 1934-1953 Tanner logo.\n\n4th Logo (March 15, 1952-September 18, 1954)\n\nVisuals: Almost exactly the same as the 3rd logo, but the background's just red, \"A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" is now in script, \"CARTOON\" is in a bolder three-dimensional font and in a champagne color, the ribboning is baby blue and \"COLOR BY TECHNICOLOR\" is in a different font and in the same color as the ribboning. Otherwise the same.\n\nClosing Title: Same as the 3rd logo, although the font for the \"A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer\" and \"Made in Hollywood, U.S.A.\" texts have been slightly changed a bit.\n\nTom and Jerry Closing Title: Same as the previous logo. Starting in 1953, the \"The End\" text has a thicker border.\n\nTechnique: Live-action footage, with a printed graphic composited over it.\n\nAudio: The updated fanfare from the first logo, blending into the opening theme for the cartoon.\n\nAvailability: It premiered on the Tom and Jerry cartoon \"The Two Mouseketeers\", released on March 15, 1952 (although the next three cartoons released, \"Smitten Kitten\", \"Triplet Trouble\" and \"One Cab's Family\" still used the previous logo, so that the logo officially premiered on the Tom and Jerry cartoon \"Little Runaway\", released on June 14, 1952) and made its final appearance on \"The Farm of Tomorrow\", released on September 18, 1954. Because of the cartoons' release schedules being either posptoned or changed, around 1953, this logo would be used in tandem with the early variation of the next logo below (until the latter started being used entirely).\n\n5th Logo (September 5, 1953-August 1, 1958)\n\nOpening logo Closing title\n\nVisuals: It's similar to the last few, but now the baby blue ribboning is moved to a blue background. \"A METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER\" has been moved from the bottom ribbon to be placed on the ribbon, with \"CARTOON\" in yellow and the Technicolor line underneath it in red.\n\nVariants:\n\nSometimes, the registered trademark symbol is absent.\n\nThe logo is modified for cartoons released in CinemaScope.\n\nOn the rerelease print of \"Little 'Tinker\", the end title is on a red background.\n\nOn the Droopy cartoon \"Dixieland Droopy\", the end title is on a shoot of a night concert.\n\nA slightly different end title was used on \"The Flea Circus\". After the words \"LE END\" in a square scrolls from right to left to a pink background after a few seconds, the words \"A METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER CARTOON MADE IN HOLLYWOOD U.S.A.\" are seen.\n\nOn \"Good Will to Men\", it fades to a version of the secondary end title, written this way:\n\nA\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer\n\nCARTOON\n\nMADE IN HOLLYWOOD, U.S.A.\n\nIn the Tom and Jerry short \"Smarty Cat\", the end title has Jerry Mouse holding the camera and the word \"THE END\" zooms at us, Then it fades to the regular blue \"A Metro-Goldwyn Mayer CARTOON Made in Hollywood, U.S.A.\" end card instead of the normal Tom & Jerry end title. The reason why this likely happened was possibly due to an editing mistake.\n\nClosing Title: Again, same as the 3rd logo, except this time the titles are condensed more towards the middle, to enable widescreen compatibility. The titles were also further modified for the CinemaScope cartoons.\n\nTom and Jerry Closing Title:\n\nThe Academy version of the closing title is essentially the same as the previous versions, but this time the \"An MGM\" credit has been redrawn with thicker borders, and is noticeably smaller to accommodate flat widescreen ratios. Starting in 1956 (reissues only since the new CinemaScope cartoons were already using different closing titles), the \"The End\" text has been slightly redrawn again with even thicker borders to match the secondary closing titles. Also, \"MADE IN HOLLYWOOD, U.S.A.\" is now in a different font.\n\nFor the CinemaScope cartoons, there are three variants:\n\nFirst variant (November 20, 1954-November 19, 1955): Similar to the original title, but it's in widescreen and the background is orange. It was used on shorts from \"Pet Peeve\" to \"That's My Mommy\".\n\nSecond variant (January 17-November 6, 1956): The \"An M.G.M. Tom and Jerry CARTOON\" secondary end title from before, now in different yellow fonts and put on a blue background. It was used on shorts from \"The Flying Sorceress\" to \"Blue Cat Blues\".\n\nThird variant (December 14, 1956-August 1, 1958): On a blue background, there is a pink square on the upper-left corner, an orange rectangle in the middle of the screen and a green square on the bottom-right corner. In the pink square is the word \"an\", on the orange rectangle are the words \"M.G.M CARTOON\", and on the green square are the words \"made in Hollywood, U.S.A.\". It was first used on \"Barbecue Brawl\" and its last appearance was on \"Tot Watchers\".\n\nTechnique: Live-action footage, with a printed graphic composited over it.\n\nAudio: The updated MGM Cartoons fanfare.\n\nAvailability: It officially premiered on the Tom and Jerry cartoon \"Just Ducky\", released on September 5, 1953.\n\nIt can easily be seen on various cartoons as well as plastering previous logos on older cartoons on TCM, Boomerang, and MeTV (as Cartoon Network no longer airs classic Tom and Jerry cartoons as of January 2016).\n\nUntil 1954, because of release schedules being changed or turned upside down, the logo was used in tandem with the previous one from above, this one being permanently used starting with the short \"Neapolitan Mouse\" on October 2, 1954, and has appeared on the remaining cartoons from the MGM cartoon studio since. As told already, it made its final appearance on the last Tom and Jerry cartoon by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera \"Tot Watchers\", released on August 1, 1958.\n\n6th Logo (September 7, 1961-December 31, 1967)\n\nOpening logo\n\nVisuals: Essentially the new MGM lion design that had been put into use on films around this time, only with \"A\" and \"CARTOON\" tacked on to the bottom in red.\n\nGene Deitch Closing Title: They varied with the cartoon. On a background depending on the cartoon, there are the words \"THE END\", with \"AN MGM CARTOON\" below. \"Carmen Get It!\", however, has a group of ants come on the musical notes book to form the words \"THE END\".\n\nChuck Jones Closing Title: \"the end\" appears on black, fading to \"A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer TOM AND JERRY CARTOON\" on black, with \"Made in Hollywood, USA\" below it. On non-Tom and Jerry cartoons, It would just read \"A METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER CARTOON\" with \"Made in Hollywood, USA\" below it on the bottom right of the black screen. On Tom and Jerry cartoons where \"The End\" is seen within the final shot, the \"the end\" part is skipped and goes straight to \"A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer TOM AND JERRY CARTOON\".\n\nVariants:\n\nOn \"Switchin' Kitten\" and \"Down and Outing\", the 1957 MGM movie logo would play (without \"CARTOON\" at the bottom, and without the theme song accompanying it) followed by a screen saying \"A METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER CARTOON\", whose font and background vary depending on the cartoon. The theme song would then start whenever this screen came up. While the standard movie logo also appeared on \"Buddies Thicker Than Water\" and \"Carmen Get It!\", the second screen was not shown and the opening music played over it.\n\nOn the short \"The Dot and the Line\", the movie logo is used instead (surrounded by a red border on unrestored Turner prints) and is accompanied by a majestic horn fanfare composed and conducted by Eugene Poddany.\n\nOn Chuck Jones' Tom & Jerry cartoons, as well as the short \"The Bear That Wasn't\", the logo was modified, and Tanner replaced Leo in the circle. The text \"METROCOLOR\" is also shown below the logo.\n\nChuck Jones Tom and Jerry Variant: After showing Tanner roaring, it later fades out to reveal none other than Tom in the circle, who meows pretty angrily in an attempt to imitate a lion's roaring, and hisses. Then, the ribboning fades into a simple blue circle and moves upwards as the black background changes to orange, Tom \"roaring\" all the while. \"T\" and \"M\" appear besides it, and \"and\" appears below. \"JERRY\" appears letter-by-letter below all t hat as Jerry drops into the \"Y,\" smiling pleasantly, and waves his hand. Tom notices this and hisses.\n\nClosing Title Variant: On 1963's \"Pent-House Mouse\" (Chuck Jones's first T&J short), \"The End\" is in a completely different font. It also cuts to the \"MGM Tom and Jerry Cartoon\" screen instead of fading.\n\nTechnique: Live-action footage, with a printed graphic composited over it. For the Tom and Jerry variant, Tanner is live-action, with the rest of the logo being a traditional-animation sequence from the Chuck Jones-led animation unit.\n\nAudio:\n\n1961-1962: The updated 1st logo fanfare, plus, with the lion roar, it had three roar tracks: the 1960 roar, another which sounded like a yawning roar, and on \"Calypso Cat\" a fierce-sounding roar. Both roars were made by Tod Dockstader.\n\n1963-1967: The updated 1st logo fanfare leading into the trademark Tom and Jerry music with the 1960 roaring soundtrack. For non-Tom and Jerry cartoons, a different fanfare is used.\n\nAvailability:\n\nThe Leo version was seen on Tom and Jerry cartoons produced by Gene Deitch and William Snyder in the former Czechoslovakia, as well as on \"The Dot and The Line\", which are still rerun on Boomerang on a semi-regular basis and on MeTV as part of its Toon In with Me and Saturday Morning Cartoons blocks (all of them have also been released on DVD.)\n\nThe Leo version was also seen on 60s theatrical re-releases of some 1940-1958 MGM cartoons done in Metrocolor (mainly to mask the \"TECHNICOLOR\" references), which were kept on old television prints of Tom and Jerry shorts such as \"Puss n' Toots\", \"The Bowling Alley-Cat\", \"Sufferin' Cats!\", \"The Lonesome Mouse\", \"The Zoot Cat\", \"Mouse Trouble\", \"Quiet Please!\", \"The Milky Waif\", \"The Invisible Mouse\" and \"Saturday Evening Puss\" (with the exception of the last one, they were kept on the Spotlight Collection DVD Volume 1 and the discontinued Blu-ray Golden Collection set), old prints of \"Rock-a-Bye Bear\" on Boomerang, and the Boomerang Germany print of the Barney Bear cartoon \"Half-Pint Palomino\".\n\nThe Leo version was also seen before the Tom and Jerry short \"Mouse Trouble\" on MeTV Toons instead of the 3rd logo.\n\nLike with the 3rd logo, Sci-Fi Theater-edited airings of \"Mouse Into Space\" cut off the opening logo, but keep the ending logo.\n\nThe Tanner version was seen on the Chuck Jones-produced Tom and Jerry cartoons, plus on \"The Bear That Wasn't\" (the one where the lion does not fade to Tom and the very last theatrical MGM cartoon from the golden age of animation), which are still rerun on Boomerang on a semi-regular basis and on MeTV as part of its Toon In with Me and Saturday Morning Cartoons blocks, and all are available on DVD.\n\nLegacy: The reputation this logo has is fairly bad in general. The Leo version is quite controversial for its association with the Gene Deitch era of Tom and Jerry. The Tanner version of the logo however is well-received for its creative concept on the Tom and Jerry cartoons, but has appeared on one of the most deeply polarizing eras of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoons, when production moved back in-house at Chuck Jones' Sib Tower 12 Productions with a mostly new crew and substantially smaller budgets."
