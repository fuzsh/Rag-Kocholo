        "text": "I know New Jerseyans love a good deal. Amazon's Prime Day this year was huge.\n\nIt's almost as big as Black Friday or Cyber Monday for Amazon and shoppers.\n\nWow, According to Numerator, more than 35,500 households bought something through the online retail giant during their two day promotion. Over 180,000 individual items were sold.\n\nThe top item bought on Amazon's Prime Day was Amazon's Fire TV Stick. Along with that huge item, protein shakes, Glad trash bags, and more were on top of the list of top products bought those two days.\n\nKeep Reading: 10 of the Most Dangerous Cities in New Jersey\n\nI'm hoping you scored some great deals and I hope the products that arrived at your door do not pose a risk to health or safety, we all hope that when we buy things, especially online.\n\nAccording to The Verge reports the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission recently revealed that Amazon has done a poor job of informing customers when products they purchased through the site have been recalled.\n\nAccording to the report, Amazon sold faulty carbon monoxide detectors, hair dryers that posed a shock risk, and children’s pajamas that did not meet flammability safety standards that were all products sold through third-party sellers.\n\nThe CPSC issued recalls for these products, but Amazon’s notification to customers who purchased them simply said there may be a potential safety issue. That led to CPSC filing a lawsuit against Amazon.\n\nAs the lawsuit made its way through court, Amazon didn’t think they should be responsible for recalls associated with products sold through third-party sellers on their platform. Ultimately, Amazon was told they are responsible for issuing those recalls on July 30, 2024.\n\n5 Amazon Items That Are Under Recall"
