        "text": "Timeline of World War II\n\nWorld War II, also called the Second World War, was a global conflict during the years 1939–1945.\n\nThe principal combatants were the Axis powers—Germany, Italy, and Japan—and the Allies—France, Great Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and, to a lesser extent, China.\n\nThe war was in many respects a continuation, after an uneasy 20-year hiatus, of the disputes left unsettled by World War I and the conditions imposed on Germany in the Treaty of Versailles, ending “The Great War.”\n\nThe 50,000,000–70,000,000 deaths incurred in World War II make it the bloodiest conflict, as well as the largest war, in history.\n\nBelow are some key dates in World War II.\n\nSome of these events actually took place before the first “official” shot of WWII was fired on September 1, 1939, when Germany invaded Poland touching off the war in Europe.\n\nThere had already been fighting in the Pacific between Japan and neighboring countries. Japan’s December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor took the war to another level as the United States was thrust into this global conflict.\n\nEven today, everyone has a personal connection to World War II in their family in some manner. It’s up to you to discover what that is.\n\n30 Jan 1933\n\nAdolf Hitler becomes Chancellor of Germany\n\n1937\n\nJapanese invasion of Manchuria\n\n1938\n\nGerman Anschluss with Austria\n\n30 SEPT 1938\n\nTreaty of Munich\n\nMARCH 1939\n\nHitler invades Czechoslovakia\n\nMARCH/APRIL 1939\n\nBritain rearms and reassures Poland\n\nLATE AUG 1939\n\nRussia and Germany sign pact\n\n1 SEPT 1939\n\nHitler invades Poland\n\n3 SEPT 1939\n\nBritain and France declare war on Germany\n\nSEPT 1939-MAY 1940\n\n“Phoney War”\n\nAPRIL/MAY 1940\n\nHitler invades Denmark and Norway\n\n10 MAY 1940\n\nBlitzkrieg\n\n10 MAY 1940\n\nChamberlain resigns\n\n26 MAY 1940\n\nDunkirk (Operation Dynamo)\n\n11 JUNE 1940\n\nItaly enters war on side of Axis powers\n\n22 JUNE 1940\n\nFrance signs armistice with Germany\n\n10 JULY-31 OCT 1940\n\nBattle of Britain\n\n22 SEPT 1940\n\nTripartite Pact\n\nDECEMBER 1940\n\nBritish rout Italians in N.
