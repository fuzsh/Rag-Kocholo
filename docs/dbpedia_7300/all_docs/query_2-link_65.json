        "text": "Did you know Miami is among the US cities with the most recording studios? With over fifty recording studios in the city, artists here are spoiled for choice, but that can make it hard to pick a studio. So, we’ve compiled a list of the top five studios in Miami to narrow it down for you. You’ll be ready to book a session and start recording in no time!\n\nNo.1 – Bay Eight Recording Studios Miami\n\nSince it was established in 2015, Bay Eight Recording Studios Miami has gone through two renovations. When our founder Matthew “Formatt” DeFreitas established the studio, it already had a decades-long legacy that attracted major artists. The Bay Eight we know and love today was originally established as Midnight Blue Studios by Fabio “Estefano” Salgado over 20 years ago. Through his work with some of the biggest Latin stars of the early 2000s, Estefano helped expand the popularity of Latin music in the American market. Some of the biggest hits from the days of Midnight Blue are “Paulina” by Paulina Rubio, and “Amar Sin Mentiras” by Marc Anthony.\n\nPresently, Bay Eight features three studio rooms equipped with the latest and greatest in recording studio technology. Our SSL room, the first and largest room, is equipped with an SSL mixing console and custom Augsperger Speakers. In addition, we also have the Apollo Room, which is equipped with Genelec mastering speakers and analog preamps. Lastly, we have the Whisper room, aptly named because it features a whisper booth. In addition to recording music, Bay Eight also offers additional services; from music production to voice-over ADR work. Since Formatt took over, the studio has seen stars like Lil Baby, J Balvin, and Rick Ross. We know we’re a bit biased, but if you have any doubts about booking our studio, we’ll let out hundreds of five star reviews do the talking.\n\nHighlights:\n\nOver +20 years in Business\n\nOffers a variety of studio environments, equipped for professionals but beginner friendly\n\nA rich history of stars who have walked through its doors\n\nA strong balance of analog and digital gear, giving you digital speed with analog sound\n\nA variety of services from music production to voice-over ADR\n\nNo. 2 – Alacran Studios\n\nAlacran Recording Studios is located in Miami Beach and was founded by Alessandra and Giorgia Lo Savio. Whether for music recording, ADR sessions, or live set productions, Alacran has everything that a musician could need. Because the studio’s facilities include an extensive array of analog equipment and instruments, artists have access to all the resources they require for their projects. In addition, Alacran features a live room with a scenic view of Miami Beach and a multimedia room for podcasting and live band rehearsals. The owners also operate a recording studio in London.\n\nLarge recording studio that offers plenty of space for bands\n\nMainly analog gear\n\nCan record for live sets\n\nNo. 3 – 5020 by Sony\n\nOwned by Sony Music, Studio 5020 boasts a relaxed and creative atmosphere for artists. The studio is equipped with a 32 Channel Neve mixing console, and it offers Sony artists a private and professional environment. Studio 5020’s main focus is Latin musicians, and some of the biggest Latin stars in the music industry, including Jennifer Lopez, Camilo, and Lili having recorded at this studio. Ultimately, Studio 5020 is a highly sought-after recording studio for Sony Latin artists in Miami.\n\nHighlights:\n\nPrivate Studio only available for label use\n\nFeatures Neve 32-channel mixing board\n\nMainly for Sony Latin artists\n\nNo. 4 – Circle House\n\nCircle House is a well-established recording studio in Miami with a history spanning over 20 years. Founded in the mid-90s by Ian Lewis, a member of the famous reggae band Inner Circle, the studio is now owned by his son Abebe Lewis. The environment at Circle House is relaxed, with a spacious outdoor patio and pool that make it an exciting location for recording sessions.\n\nThis studio is renowned for its musical heritage. Inner Circle is best known for the “Bad Boys” theme song for the TV show “Cops” (and the subsequent Bad Boys films). Additionally, recordings like The Miseducation of Lauren Hill and Pharrell’s “Happy” have further cemented Circle House’s legacy.\n\n20+ years experience with a family history\n\nRelaxed and Spacious Environment\n\nHosts workshops for local artists\n\nNo. 5 – Criteria Recording Studios\n\nFrom James Brown to the The Bee Gees, this studio has pushed legendary hits since its dawn. Other legends that have recorded at this studio include The Eagles for their album Hotel California, Black Sabbath for their album Technical Ecstasy, and Lil’ Wayne for Tha Carter III. Criteria Studios was founded by Jazz trumpet player Mack Emeran in 1958, so it’s no wonder the studio has always attracted so many legendary artists.\n\nCriteria Studio can host several artists at one time, since it features six large recording spaces. Today, this studio continues to attract major artists like Ceelo Green, Shakira, Alicia Keys and Nelly Furtado.\n\nHighlights:\n\nFirst studio recorded in the southeast United States to own an SSL Mixing Console 1984\n\n65+ years in business\n\nFeatures 6 different studios with different mixing consoles ranging from the Neve 8078 to an SSL AWS900\n\nConclusion"
