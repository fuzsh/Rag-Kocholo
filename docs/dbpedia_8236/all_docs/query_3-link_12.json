        "text": "Castile, N.Y. -- The walls aren't so high, the valleys aren't as wide, the scenery isn't quite as spectacular.\n\nThe Grand Canyon of the East really can't compete with the Grand Canyon of the West.\n\nBut as I was ascending a steep portion of the 7-mile Gorge Trail at Letchworth State Park in western New York, I was reminded of a hike taken years before on Bright Angel Trail at Grand Canyon National Park.\n\n\"Slow and steady,\" advised an older woman, a solo hiker, who passed me and my husband as we struggled to make it back up to the top of the South Rim.\n\nYears later -- and thousands of miles farther east -- her advice still holds.\n\nTake smaller, slower steps, I told myself as I climbed up from New York's Genesee River to the top of the gorge.\n\nMy reward when I made it to the top? Sore legs -- and a spectacular view of the canyon below.\n\nLetchworth State Park\n\nGetting there:\n\nLetchworth State Park, in the far-western portion of New York’s Finger Lakes region, can be accessed from either I-90 or I-86. We took I-86 east to Exit 30, then traveled north on N.Y. 19 and 19A to the southern entrance of the park. It took about four hours.\n\nWhere to stay:\n\nModest rooms that sleep two at the\n\nGlen Iris Inn\n\nare $100; two-room suites, which sleep up to four, are $180. Or spring for the Cherry Suite, with a balcony overlooking the falls, for $225. Nearby, the Pinewood Lodge offers seven efficiencies that sleep up to four for $115. Pinewood rooms have individual TVs; the Glen Iris Inn has one TV in a communal room. Don’t expect Internet access or cellphone service in either location. Information: 585-493-2622.\n\nAlso available inside the park: 270 campsites and 82 cabins. Information:\n\nnysparks.com/parks/79/details.aspx\n\nWhere to eat:\n\nCaroline’s restaurant at Glen Iris offers fine dining in a casual atmosphere (hikers welcome) for three meals a day (dinner entrees start at $21). Or just enjoy a drink on the stone patio, a few steps from Middle Falls. Reservations: 585-493-2622.\n\nOutside the park, in the town of Mount Morris, is\n\nQuesta Lasagna\n\n, a terrific Italian restaurant with half a dozen varieties of lasagna (including Greek, seafood and — not to be missed — chocolate). Information: 585-658-3761.\n\nPark activities:\n\nHiking and scenic-overlooking are the primary activities. Admission to the park is $8 per vehicle (the fee is waived if you’re staying at the inn). Information:\n\nnysparks.com/parks/79/details.aspx\n\nor 585-493-3600.\n\nAdventure Calls Outfitters\n\nruns regular rafting trips down the Genesee River, weather permitting; rates are $30 per person. Information: 1-888-270-2410.\n\nBalloons Over Letchworth\n\noffers an alternative way to see the gorge — via hot-air balloon. Information: 585-493-3340.\n\nMore information:\n\nfingerlakeswest.com\n\nor\n\ngowyomingcountyny.com\n\nPark manager Roland Beck said he doesn't know exactly when Letchworth picked up the nickname \"Grand Canyon of the East.\"\n\n\"It's been called that as long as I can remember,\" said Beck. \"In this area, this kind of gorge is very uncommon. I think somebody probably looked at it and said, 'Wow, it kinda looks like the Grand Canyon.' \"\n\nYet there's a problem with that reasoning: Compared with the nation's grandest canyon, Letchworth can't help but come up short.\n\nBut judged on its own merits? This park, in the far-western reaches of New York's Finger Lakes region and just a four-hour drive east of Cleveland, is terrific, with challenging (as well as easy) hiking, three impressive waterfalls, white-water rafting, captivating American Indian history -- plus a charming, historic place to spend the night.\n\nEstate is now a lovely inn The park is named after William Pryor Letchworth, a Buffalo businessman who was traveling through the area by train in 1858 and fell in love with the scenery. He first purchased 200 acres, which later grew to 1,000, and deeded it to the state of New York in 1907, in part to forestall construction of a dam upriver from his property.\n\nHe called the estate Glen Iris (iris is Greek for rainbow) because of the rainbows that form above the misty waterfall outside his vacation home.\n\nThat home -- now the historic Glen Iris Inn -- is a wonderful place to spend the night, with 16 antique-furnished, creaky rooms. You'll feel like Mr. Letchworth might return home any moment (and in fact, my younger daughter described the inn as creepy -- as in haunted -- though she had no trouble sleeping after a day spent playing in the park).\n\nThe inn sits just steps from the Middle Falls, at 107 feet the highest of three main waterfalls that spill through the park, and the only one illuminated at night.\n\nEven if you're not staying overnight, stop by the inn for a look around, a drink on the front porch or a meal at the well-regarded Caroline's restaurant.\n\nAfter checking in, we hit the Gorge Trail and hiked about two miles downriver to the Lower Falls, another lovely cataract, best viewed from a footbridge that spans the Genesee.\n\nMost of the hike, however, takes place far away from the water, atop the gorge that rises in some places 1,000 feet above the valley floor. Such vertical lift makes for a series of spectacular overlooks, as well as some heart-pumping hiking.\n\nWe took a well-deserved rest break at Inspiration Point, a popular spot for weddings, with amazing views of Middle Falls and the Portage Railroad Bridge to the south, and the ribbon of a river far below, snaking north toward Rochester and Lake Ontario.\n\nThe walls of the Genesee Gorge are as fascinating as they are beautiful -- shale and sandstone, deposited millions of years ago, then cut through by slow-moving glaciers during the Ice Age.\n\nThe effect? Layers of lacy rock that fall apart when you pick at them -- too brittle and dangerous for rock climbing, but endlessly engrossing to look at.\n\nLater, in our car, we made photo stops at several other scenic overlooks, including Big Bend and then Tea Table Rock, where a slab of sandstone jutting out over the canyon used to invite picnickers to spread a blanket and enjoy a spot of tea.\n\nAvoiding rocks on the low river\n\nThe next morning, we studied the gorge from a different vantage point, from the surface of the river itself. We suited up and hopped onto inflatable rafts for a rocky trip down the Genesee.\n\nGuide Evan Parker, with Adventure Calls Outfitters, warned us from the very start: If you are expecting some nice Class VI, Niagara-type rapids. you won't find them here.\n\nRelated stories\n\nWestern New York has been plagued this summer by the same drought affecting Northeast Ohio; hence, the water level in the Genesee in late July was low -- so low, in fact, that Adventure Calls had shut down its trips on the river during the week prior to our arrival. Thankfully, a soaking rain a few days earlier allowed the trips to resume. Even so, the river was running very low, making the boat trip more an exercise in rock avoidance than thrill seeking.\n\n\"There's going to be some work involved,\" stressed Parker. We were allowed no more than four to a boat and were instructed to follow Parker's raft down the river -- \"so I can find out where all the rocks are.\"\n\nEasier said than done, for sure. Our 21/2-hour trip took nearly four hours, as we bounced from rock to rock, trying to dislodge ourselves from one just to find ourselves entrenched on another.\n\nThe highlight? When my husband exited the raft (on purpose), relieving our boat of at least a third of its weight. He swam next to us while we sailed right through the next set of rapids without getting stuck once (thanks, Steve!).\n\nOther high points: bodysurfing through New Wave Rapids and jumping into a deep hole in the rock (\"Leap of Faith\"), where scenic Wolf Creek drops down the gorge wall and empties into the Genesee.\n\nWhite Woman of the Genesee\n\nLong before we frolicked in the water -- and even decades before Letchworth discovered his country escape -- the land was occupied by Seneca Indians, who called the area \"Sehgahunda\" (the Vale of Three Falls).\n\nAfter he settled here, Letchworth, fascinated by the region's history, amassed a collection of Indian artifacts, including pottery, tools and weapons, which are on display along with some personal artifacts at the small William Pryor Letchworth Museum across the street from the Glen Iris Inn.\n\nMore interesting is a collection of log buildings located on a bluff behind the museum, including the Revolutionary War-era Seneca Council House, moved here from nearby Caneadea in 1871, and an early-19th-century cabin built by Mary Jemison for her daughter, Nancy.\n\nMary Jemison, born to Irish parents on a ship bound for America, was kidnapped as a teenager in the 1750s by the Shawnee Indians in central Pennsylvania and later adopted by the Seneca tribe. As an adult, she chose to stay with the tribe, marrying twice and bearing eight children.\n\nShe became a skilled negotiator on behalf of the tribe, earning the nickname White Woman of the Genesee. For years she lived on land in what later would become Letchworth State Park before relocating in 1831 to a reservation in Buffalo, where she died in 1833.\n\nIn 1874, Letchworth had her remains brought back to the park, where her burial site is marked by a statue of Jemison with her first son, Thomas, on her back.\n\nAn inscription on the base of the statue pays tribute to Jemison, \"whose home during more than 70 years of a life of strange vicissitude was among the Senecas upon the banks of this river and whose history inseparably connected with that of this valley.\"\n\nHigh above that river, pondering the life of Jemison and others on this land, I couldn't quite make out the water below, my view blocked by a leafy stand of trees.\n\nBut I could clearly hear the roar of Middle Falls a short distance away, the hypnotizing sound of water on rock.\n\nIt drew me back to the river's edge.\n\nAs impressive as the Grand Canyon? Perhaps not. But in its own way, just as inspiring."
