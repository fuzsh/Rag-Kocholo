        "text": "2. The Chemical Hygiene Officer (CHO) is responsible for chemical hygiene in the District.\n\n3. Science Teachers will work with administrators, the CHO and other employees to develop and implement appropriate chemical hygiene practices. They should monitor use and disposal of chemicals in the lab, see that inventories are maintained, know the current legal requirements that govern regulated substances, and seek ways to improve the chemical hygiene plan.\n\n4. The Science teacher has the responsibility for chemical hygiene in the lab including the responsibility to:\n\n* Ensure that affected personnel know and follow all safety rules, use appropriate personal protective equipment, and provide students with appropriate safety training.\n\n* Conduct regular formal housekeeping inspections including inspections of emergency equipment.\n\n* Know the current legal requirements concerning regulated substances.\n\n* Ensure that the facilities are adequate for any material being used.\n\n* Lesson plans should include all possible hazards, preventive measures and emergency responses for each hazard.\n\n* Develop and follow sound personal chemical hygiene habits.\n\nLETCHWORTH CENTRAL SCHOOL CHEMICAL HYGIENE PLAN\n\n29 CFR 1910.1450, Chemical Hygiene\n\nTHE LABORATORY FACILITY\n\n1. DESIGN\n\n* An appropriate ventilation system should have air intakes and exhausts located to avoid recirculation of contaminated air.\n\n* The facility should provide adequate, well-ventilated storerooms, laboratory fume hoods, and sinks.\n\n* Other safety equipment shall include eyewash stations and located in The Chemistry Room 227 a drenching shower.\n\n2. VENTILATION\n\n* Natural Dilution: This system should provide a source of air for breathing. It will not be relied upon for protection from toxic substances released into the lab.\n\n* Hoods: A laboratory fume hood should be provided for demonstration. Each hood will be monitored for adequate performance by teachers annually, document and record.\n\n* Modifications: Any alterations to the ventilation system should be made only by qualified personnel and if testing indicates that worker protection from airborne toxic substances will continue to be adequate.\n\n* Quality: Airflow should be six air changes per hour. The hood face velocity should be maintained 80 - 120 linear feet per minute, at minimum. CFR 1910. 1450\n\n4 – 12 air changes per is adequate general ventilation for a science lab/OSHA\n\nThe NYS SED Chemical Storage guidelines will be utilized whenever possible. Revised February 2016\n\nLETCHWORTH CENTRAL SCHOOL CHEMICAL HYGIENE PLAN\n\n29 CFR 1910.1450, Chemical Hygiene\n\nComponents of The Chemical Hygiene Plan\n\n1. PROCUREMENT\n\n* No container will be accepted if leaking or without an adequate label and Material Safety Data Sheet.\n\n2. STORAGE\n\n* Toxic substances should be segregated in a chemical storage cabinet off limits to unauthorized individuals.\n\n* Stored chemicals should be examined at least annually for replacement, deterioration and container integrity by the teacher. Amounts will be stored in the smallest practicable quantity. Yearly inventories will be conducted and unneeded items will be disposed of. Contact the GV BOCES health and safety office for assistance.\n\n* Chemicals will be stored in accordance with accepted standards of compatibility. An inventory list arranged alphabetically will be posted in the storage room. Material Safety Data Sheets will be arranged alphabetically and located in the storage room.\n\n3. DISTRIBUTION FROM STORAGE AREA\n\n* Chemicals should be diluted prior to leaving the storage area.\n\n4. AIR MONITORING\n\n* Monitoring of airborne concentrations of toxic substances may be appropriate when testing or redesigning hoods or when highly toxic substances are used on a regular basis which is not anticipated, or when using chemicals that require initial monitoring.\n\n5. HOUSEKEEPING\n\n* Housekeeping and inspections will be performed at least biannually by the Chemical Hygiene officer. The GV BOCES will inspect annually during the fire inspection. The purpose of this is to identify hazards and determine whether to implement control measures such as ventilation, modified work practices or additional personal protective equipment. Suitable facilities for the quick drenching of personnel exposed to corrosive or injurious chemicals will be used for eyewash and shower emergencies. This device will be inspected at least quarterly by the CHO. Informal inspections will be continuous. Eyewash fountains and safety showers should be inspected and tested quarterly. Records of testing and inspections should be maintained. Procedures for restarting out-of-service equipment should be established. Stairways and hallways should not be used as storage areas. Access to exits, emergency equipment, and utility controls should never be blocked.\n\n6. MEDICAL PROGRAM\n\n* The nurses are trained in first aid and available during working hours. Medical consultations will be provided in case of spills or emergencies where employees show signs and symptoms of overexposure.\n\n7. PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND APPAREL\n\n* Splash Goggles\n\n* ANSI approved safety glasses\n\n* Chemical resistant aprons\n\n* Gloves\n\n* Hair ties\n\n* No open toed shoes\n\n8. RECORDS\n\n* Accident reports will be written and retained for all accidents involving injuries, and property damage.\n\n* Inventories, Safety Data Sheets and records indicating attendance at Employee Right to Know Training and chemical hygiene training will be maintained in accordance with OSHA.\n\n* Maintain records of measurement of employee exposure and any medical consultations and exams that are conducted for [30 years or for the duration of employment plus 20 years, whichever is longer, or in accordance with 1910.20].\n\n9. SIGNS AND LABELS\n\n* Emergency telephone numbers will be posted on interior lab doors and office * Identifying labels must show contents of containers and associated hazards.\n\n* Location signs for safety showers, eyewash stations, first aid equipment, exits, areas where food and beverages are prohibited and warnings at areas where unusual hazards exist will be posted.\n\n10. SPILLS\n\n* In the case of a spill, the administration will be notified immediately by phone. It is the responsibility of the administration to evacuate school if necessary. In the case of a fire or major spill, the employee is responsible for evacuating the premises by pulling the fire alarm. GV BOCES Health and Safety Office should be notified immediately at 585-346-4105\n\n* The written emergency action plan is located in the Superintendent’s office and will be communicated to all personnel. Spill control procedures will include approved containment, cleanup and transportation methods as directed by the GV BOCES Safety Officer or other qualified personnel.\n\n11. INFORMATION AND TRAINING\n\n* Employees will be trained upon initial assignment concerning chemicals available, procedures, location of the chemical hygiene plan, location of Material Safety Data Sheets, and method of hazard identification (refer to paragraph F of occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals in the Chemical Hygiene standard). Training will be covered by CHO or the GV BOCES Health and Safety personnel. Particularly hazardous chemicals (carcinogens, reproductive toxins, mercury etc.) will not be used. If their use is anticipated or a chemical is newly deemed particularly hazardous, proper provisions will be made in accordance with 1910.1450(e)(3)(viii).\n\n12. WASTE DISPOSAL PROGRAM\n\n* The waste disposal program should specify how waste is to be collected, segregated, stored and disposed of. Unlabeled containers of chemicals and solutions should be promptly identified and disposed of if need be. Indiscriminate disposal by pouring waste chemicals down the drain or adding them to refuse for landfill burial is unacceptable. Contact CHO and GV BOCES Health and Safety office to arrange for a hazardous waste disposal pickup through certified waste haulers.\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nGENERAL LABORATORY RULES/STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES\n\nI.
