In this book, he outlined a utopian city based on the ideal of linking people together with nature and combining the benefits of ‘Town’ and ‘Country’. This book began the foundations of the Garden City Movement, which went on to influence the building of towns such as Welwyn and Letchworth in England, using some of Howard’s principles. Howard’s work also provided some of the origins of thought which influenced the creation of the Housing and Town Planning Act of 1909.\n\tThese slides will have been used in a lecture from JR James, at the Department of Town and Regional Planning at The University of Sheffield between 1967 and 1978, to illustrate the ideals of Howard, and to show the origins of Town Planning itself.",
