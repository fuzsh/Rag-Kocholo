        "text": "Grand Gorge in the Empire State\n\nBy Carolyn Wixson Haga\n\nIt's a magnificent chasm all right, with sheer shale and sandstone cliffs rising 550 feet; three gushing falls, one over a hundred feet high; river rafting; some 70 miles of hiking trails that, when snow-blanketed, do double duty for cross-country skiers; and a forest that harbors nearly every species of eastern North American tree, several species of wild orchids, and a variety of birds, from barred owls to herons.\n\nThe place? New York's Letchworth State Park, home of the so-called \"Grand Canyon of the East,\" a 17-mile gorge cut into the central part of the state by the Genesee River on its way north to Lake Ontario. Although overshadowed by New York's other wonder, Niagara Falls, 60 miles to the northwest, the 14,350-acre preserve has noteworthy attractions. In addition to a series of three falls that stairstep downriver and provide much of the gorge's visual drama, there are striking rock formations, including pillar-like Cathedral Rock, creations of some 350 million years of sedimentary deposits and erosion.\n\nVisitors can best view the park's centerpiece gorge from an overlook at the Mount Morris Dam. Other popular viewpoints are the stone footbridge near Lower Falls; the footpaths that seem to cling to the gorge's walls; and the Glen Iris Inn and Restaurant, former country retreat of the park's founder, William Pryor Letchworth.\n\nThis 19th-century Buffalo industrialist and early conservationist was said to have been drawn to the site in 1858 by a rainbow arching over one of the fallsand soon bought land here. Letchworth deeded these holdings to the state of New York in 1907, an estate that included thousands of trees he planted on this landscape once scarred by lumbering. Today his mansion's 6 guest rooms and suites are named after tree species in the park.\n\nThe Seneca Indians, who preceded Letchworth here, called the gorge Seh-ga-hun-da\"vale of the three falls.\" The canyon walls are permeated with tales about the Senecas, among them the story of a woman and papoose who perished here and whose spirits are said to roam the surrounding forest of red cedars, maples, pines, and oaks in the shape of white deer; and the true story of Mary Jemison, an 18th-century settler who was kidnapped by Indians in a raid that killed her family, and chose to remain with her captors on land that later became part of the park. This \"White Woman of the Genesee\" is buried in the park near the Jemison cabin and the Letchworth Museum, which houses pioneer and Native American artifacts and features a restored Seneca Indian Council House.\n\nAn upstanding Quaker, William Letchworth was initiated as a blood brother into the Seneca Nation for his ardent efforts to protect this land and its native people. Visitors claim they can still see his rainbowin the hues reflected in the spraying falls or in the vibrant trees that attract autumn leaf-peepers. This wouldn't surprise the Senecas. They believed that the sun lingered over their wild gorge, pausing to appreciate its beauty.\n\nThe main entrances to Letchworth State Park are on State 19A south of Castile, New York, and 35 miles southwest of Rochester off I-390 in Mount Morris. Other entrances are in Portageville (closed in winter), and Perry."
