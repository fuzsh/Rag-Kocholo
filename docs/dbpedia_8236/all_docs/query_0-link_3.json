        "text": "The historical value of stereo images cannot be overstated. But as we have noted on other pages, sometimes the label on the back of the stereocard is also useful in exploring the Park's past.\n\nHere is the back label by local photographer George Washburn from Castile. Washburn's views are well known to local historians and covers a variety of Portage area subjects.\n\nNote that Mr. Washburn advertised that his studio offers \"photography in its different branches with the moder nimprovements.\" We wonder what he would think of today's digital technology!"
