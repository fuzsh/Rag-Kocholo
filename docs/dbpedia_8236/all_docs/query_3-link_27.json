        "text": "Photo: Scott Schild\n\nThe tragic history of Letchworth State Park\n\nLetchworth State Park is one of the most beautiful natural areas in the country -- voted the best state park in America in fact. But with that beauty comes a tragic history of accidents, disasters and more. Here's a history of fatal incidents in the park's history, some to serve as a reminder to always be careful and use your best judgment when visiting.\n\nUser submitted photo | Michael Tracy\n\nMay 1865\n\nThe Portage Wooden Bridge in Letchworth is iconic, but working on it resulted in at least one death. Luther Stanton lost his balance while working on the high railroad bridge, and fell to his death, according to LetchworthParkHistory.com.\n\nRead more\n\nPhoto: Screengrab from LetchworthParkHistory.com\n\nJuly 4, 1876\n\nA tornado ripped through Letchworth and neighboring area, destroying more than a dozen buildings and injuring many others, according to LetchworkParkHistory.com. There was one fatality: a young boy named Matson, aged 7 or 8, was found dead after the storm, presumably killed instantly as his back broke.\n\nRead more\n\nPhoto courtesy of Matt Champlain\n\nMarch 1903\n\nFor many years two trains–the Erie and Pennsylvania Railroads—ran through the park, resulting in many wrecks, according to LetchworthParkHistory.com. One of those wrecks resulted in W.E. Potts of Olean being pinned against the boiler head by a freight car. He was pinned for four hours, with his legs crushed and almost his entire body scalded. He later succumbed to his injuries.\n\nRead more\n\nPhoto: Screengrab from LetchworthParkHistory.com\n\nAugust 1917\n\nAn automobile filled with 11 people plunged over an embankment near upper Portage Falls, resulting in two deaths, according to LetchworthParkHistory.com. \"The car in its descent turned twice over, end for end, run out into the river in shallow water right side up and headed in the same direction as when it went over the bank,\" the Rochester Times Union reported. Evienia Tomanovitch died at the scene and Grace Dillon later died at an area hospital.\n\nRead more\n\nJuly 1936\n\nA fisherman found the body of Peter Willowry in the Genesee River Gorge.
