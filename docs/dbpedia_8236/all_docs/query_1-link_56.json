        "text": "About the book\n\n“This is a very well-produced and attractive book written by five members of the Letchworth Local History Research Group, with contributions from another six, and edited by Janet Capstick and Philippa Parker, who should all be congratulated on an excellent production.” Chris Barney, Industrial Archaeology Review\n\n“Excellently illustrated throughout with a bibliography I would recommend this book to the local historian and anyone with connections to Letchworth. It is a valuable addition to the history of the town.” Jane Tunesi, Hertfordshire People\n\nIn spite of being named the first ‘Garden City’, Letchworth was conceived as a model industrial town built on enterprise and employment.\n\nNever intended to be merely a pleasant place to live, it needed to be large enough to encourage the mass movement of manufacturers and their employees from overcrowded cities and to function as a self-supporting new town.\n\nIn this richly illustrated account, Letchworth Local History Research Group look in detail at the town’s foundation in the early 1900s and the energetic organisation and administration that enabled it to get off the ground quickly and successfully.\n\nBased on new research into a wealth of source material, the book puts to rest some of the enduring myths about the garden city, revealing a nuanced picture of the founding of a working community.\n\nThe collaborative efforts of First Garden City Ltd (FGC), the development company for the new town, are a key focus."
