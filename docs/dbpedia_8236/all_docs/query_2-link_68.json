        "text": "If you’ve explored our Blazing A Trail Centennial timeline, you’ll know that the creation of New York’s state park system was influenced in part by two larger social movements: A new environmental conservation movement that sought to protect open spaces from development, and a growing social reform movement that sought to address the inequalities that arose during America’s Gilded Age of the late 1800s.\n\nThe state park system was founded on the value of the outdoors to public physical and mental health, and the pressing need to preserve land for public use. In a statement supportive of the 1924 State Park Plan, then-state senator Nathan Straus Jr. said:\n\n“The city dweller often forgets that he is closely related to the other members of the animal kingdom. Like the other members, he loves the earth and the trees and craves contact with the soil. Sensing instinctively the need of the open country, the wealthy city man joins a golf club and organizes a fish and game reservation where he can enjoy camping and outdoor life. The city dweller of moderate means has the same cravings and the same needs. But when he takes his family out for a Sunday, or for a longer outing, he finds himself on a congested road hemmed in by private property, which is marked with the sign “No Trespassing.” Where is he to go? The answer is, the state park.”\n\nContinue reading Celebrating A Century Of Affordability At State Parks →\n\nMemories need a sense of place, and for a century, New Yorkers have discovered it at a New York State park or historic site. With more than 250 parks, each as diverse and beautiful as the memories they host, it’s no wonder so many people hold moments at a state park dear. Whether they’re milestones like a wedding or graduation, or a simple annual family tradition, the parks have been backdrops to the scenes of the lives of millions for 100 years.\n\nThere are more memories in our parks than pine needles on trees in Moreau Lake State Park and grains of sand on Jones Beach. It’s our privilege to share with you three of these precious memories.\n\nContinue reading Your Unforgettable Moments At State Parks →\n\nOn April 8, New York State Parks and Historic Sites welcomed people from around the world to share a once-in-a-generation total solar eclipse. Thousands of people enjoyed a rich, memorable experience thanks to the hard work of our staff over a two-year period.\n\nPublic Information Officer Angela Berti of the Niagara Region led this effort on behalf of State Parks and represented our agency on the statewide Eclipse Task Force.\n\nOur Park Police used their expertise in peacefully managing large crowds to keep our visitors safe. Countless staff worked behind the scenes and on the front lines to open selected campgrounds for the occasion, plan educational programming, get the word out to the public, make sure our parks were in top condition, and ensure the safety of our visitors.\n\nAs Chief of Staff and Commissioner Pro Tempore, I am filled with pride and gratitude for all the hard work of our staff in preparing for this remarkable event. Enjoy reliving the day with photos from around our parks and sites!\n\nContinue reading Total Eclipse Of The Parks →\n\nWith its spectacular scenery, Letchworth State Park is one of the most beloved parks in our system. But a crucial part of its story is the power of thinking differently.\n\nWilliam Pryor Letchworth, the park’s namesake, was deeply interested in epilepsy, traveling the country and the world in the late 1800s to study how it was treated. It’s not unreasonable to imagine that Letchworth would be proud to know that the park bearing his name is now home to a first-of-its-kind nature trail designed to meet the needs of people with an often misunderstood and stigmatized condition: autism.\n\nContinue reading Share Your Story: Conrad Baker on the Autism Nature Trail at Letchworth →\n\nWhen it comes to planning a vacation or getaway, New York State Parks has overnight options for all kinds of adventures – and budgets!\n\nWhile some enjoy sleeping in tents away from it all in remote, natural settings under the stars, others crave a few more amenities. Whether you prefer booking rustic cabins and bringing your RV, staying in fully equipped cottages, or resting your head at a historic inn or resort with the comforts of home, State Parks has something for everyone.\n\nOur Parks system includes 8,148 campsites, 967 cabins and cottages, 18 yurts, three inns, and – yes – a lighthouse. There are countless adventures for every type of stay. Get a map handy and explore highlights from some of our most interesting properties to inspire your next stay.\n\nLa Isla Bonita\n\nIf you have a boat or have access to renting one, answer the siren song of the water and consider the benefits of staying on one of three island parks in the Thousand Islands that are only accessible by boat.\n\nCanoe Point, Cedar Island, and Mary Island State Parks offer a quiet camping experience with plenty of dock space for a one-of-a-kind island excursion.\n\nWho’s On Deck?\n\nWhy worry about clearing your campsite for the tent when you can enjoy a level platform? Platform camping provides a wooden deck floor for pitching your tent on a smoother and more even surface.\n\nMany campgrounds across the state have platforms including Harriman and Lake Taghkanic State Parks in the Hudson Valley.\n\nCabins and Cottages and a Lighthouse (Oh My!)\n\nThe perfect place for a family reunion on the Great Lakes? Check. Lakefront luxe in the Finger Lakes for a bachelorette wine-tasting weekend? Check. Thousand Islands waterfront cabin for anglers telling fish tales about the day’s catch? Check. Memories to last a lifetime? Check, check, check.\n\nRobert Wehle State Park features a private setting that accommodates eight, and includes a compound with a main house, guest quarters, studio, and formal gardens set cliffside along the Lake Ontario shorefront.\n\nFans of America’s pastime can stay at a cottage at Betty and Wilbur Davis State Park near Cooperstown and head to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, then go old school and listen to a game on the radio from the cottage’s front porch.\n\nContinue reading Sweet Dreams: Explore State Parks’ Remote Islands, Cabins, Resorts and More →"
