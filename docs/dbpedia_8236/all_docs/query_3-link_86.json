        "text": "How much does Girlguiding cost?\n\nThe cost of our membership fees (‘subs’) will vary from area to area. This is dependent on everything from the unit’s activities to the cost of hiring a meeting place. Register your details, find your local unit and speak to your local volunteer team about costs in your area.\n\nWhere can I buy uniform and what does my child need?\n\nOur online shop has everything and more for your uniform needs. Each of our age groups has its own uniform, but uniform should never be a barrier to girls joining guiding. Check out our policy on inclusive uniform.\n\nI haven’t heard from my local unit. What do I do?\n\nYour local volunteer team will aim to get in touch within 3 weeks of registering interest. Our volunteers are very busy and they give us a lot of their time, so this may sometimes take a little longer.\n\nHow do I add another child or register multiple children?\n\nOnce you’ve registered one child via the register now button above, you can add another child from within your GO account using our GO guide for parents and carers.\n\nI’ve already registered and would like to change my details. Where can I do that?\n\nIf you've already completed the registration form, you can log in to check your progress, contact a unit or change any details including your preferred unit. Find out more about checking or changing your registration enquiry.\n\nHow do I move my child to another unit?\n\nGo to 'How do I transfer my child to another unit?' on our GO guide for parents and carers.\n\nWho can be part of Girlguiding?\n\nAt Girlguiding, we want everyone to feel welcome and have an equal sense of belonging. We value and celebrate the different experiences of our members. We’re proud to welcome people from all backgrounds including disabled people, LGBTQ+ people, people of colour and those of all religions or philosophical beliefs and none. You can read more about our diversity and inclusion strategy and what we have achieved so far, as well as what it means to us to be including all.\n\nGirlguiding will not disclose information you provide to volunteers, members or parents, unless your consent is given to do so."
