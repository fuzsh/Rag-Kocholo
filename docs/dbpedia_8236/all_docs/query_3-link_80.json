When will the fall colors reach their peak? Find out with our 2024 fall foliage map! Plus, here’s a list of 21 great places to see autumn’s colors.\n\nWhen Do Fall Leaves Change Color?\n\nLeaves can change their color from as early as mid-September all the way through early November. Typically, the second and third week of October are the peak times, but it shifts depending on where you live and your local weather conditions.\n\nFoliage starts to change in the northern-tier states out West and in the Midwest by late September. By October 4, the leaves in some areas will be past their prime.\n\nMuch of New England as well as the Pacific Northwest, will be at or near peak fall color by October 11.\n\nA little further south in the Blue Ridge Mountains, it looks like mid-October is your best bet.\n\nFall Foliage Color Map\n\nBelow is an animated map showing the progression of fall colors across the U.S. based on foliage reports from Almanac readers. Of course, past results do not necessarily indicate what will happen this year, but it should give you a fairly good idea of how fall leaves typically progress. In this depiction, yellow marks the beginning of foliage season, orange and red are peak season, and brown is past peak.\n\nWhere Do the Fall Leaves Change Color?\n\nHere are some of the best places to see fall foliage in the United States. Perhaps some of these destinations are near you! We welcome your tips on other great places to see fall’s colors.

However, here are a couple of surprises:\n\nThose vivid leaf colors were actually hidden underneath the green all along! As sunlight decreases and cold increases, tree growth slows, and the production of green chlorophyll in their leaves begins to slow, revealing fall leaves’ brilliant yellow, orange, and red.\n\nNot all tree leaves change color. It’s “deciduous trees” (oak, birch, beech) with broad leaves that show off those gorgeous reds, yellows, oranges, and even purples.\n\nWant to read more about fall leaves? Check out this article: Why Do Leaves Change Color?\n\nHow Weather Affects Leaf Color\n\nAnother important part of leaf-peeping is knowing the right time to go! For the best experience, not only should leaves be near their peak colors, but the weather should be agreeable, too.\n\nAvoid rainy, windy days, when the leaves (and you) will be soggy. Strong wind in late fall can even result in prematurely bare trees, so keep that in mind while planning.\n\nSome say that a lightly overcast day actually improves the colors of the leaves, making them pop against the somber skies.\n\nOthers prefer to bask in autumn’s brilliance under blue skies and full sun—and we can’t say we blame them!\n\nNow, you’re ready to enjoy the fall colors.
