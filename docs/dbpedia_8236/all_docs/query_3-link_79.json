DHL Express’s fast, secure and reliable worldwide delivery service is available at selected Ryman, Safestore, WHSmith and Robert Dyas stores, as well as 100s of independent stores nationwide.\n\nWe recommend that you complete your parcel details online before you visit to save time in store. Please remember to check what you can and can't send with DHL as some items are prohibited. To check that your parcel will fit into one of our free envelopes or boxes and how much it will cost, take a look at our size and price guide.\n\nWe also have our own DHL Express Service Centres, where we have an additional weighing and measuring capability for when you’re using your own packaging instead of the free boxes and envelopes that we provide at all our DHL Service Points."
