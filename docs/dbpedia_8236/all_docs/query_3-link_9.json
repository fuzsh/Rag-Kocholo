        "text": "This wonderful group of photographs was shared by Carolyn Swanton of Rochester NY. They were probably taken around 1924 on a trip to Park by the Wray family of Rush , New York. Among them was young Charles Wray (1919-1985). This might have been his first visit to the Park but it certainly was not his last - in the early 1980s the Park's we had the pleasure of meeting him when we invited him to Letchworth and the Park Museum to discuss the Native American artifact collection. (See an article detailing the life and work of archaeologist Charles F Wray. For more information on the Wray family, see an article written by Carolyn for the Mt Hope Cemetery newsletter, \"The Epitaph\" )\n\nAbove: Looking down river from the west bank above the Middle Falls. Note the iron railing that had been installed for visitor safety. Similar railings were also found at the Lower Falls area. The railing was removed during the Civilian Conservation Corps era in the 1930s. The Slide are is also visible in the distance.\n\nBelow: This shot of the Middle Falls was probably taken from the front lawn of the Glen Iris.\n\nThe last two images were taken of the gorge. Below left: This view is taking looking down river from the roadway in front of Pinewood Lodge. Inspiration Point is located in the center of the photograph. This might have been taken by the Wray family on a later visit to the Park. Below right: Much has changed since this photograph was taken. The Mt. Morris Dam is now located in this part of the gorge. As we look at this picture we have to keep in mind a couple of important facts - this part of the Valley, known as the High Banks, was not part of the Park when the Wray Family visited in the 1920s. It also wasn't easy to travel from the Highbanks to Letchworth Park in those days - the Park road wasn't built until the 1930s. The Wrays would have had to travel on several rural roads to go between the two scenic attractions.\n\nAgain, we thank Carolyn Swanton for sharing this wonderful photos with us!"
