        "text": "Letchworth State Park, which we co-authored, was published in 2008. It is now in its sixth printing. Chapters include \"The Falls,\" \"Glen Iris,\" \"Council Grounds,\" \"Lower Falls and Wolf Creek,\" \"Vanished Villages,\" and \"Highbanks and the Modern Park.\" The book includes the stories of the Seneca, pioneers, Mary Jemison, William P Letchworth, and much more. Lovers of Letchworth Park will also find Nunda, Portage, and Genesee Falls published in 2011 to be of interest. When first settled in pioneer times, the lands which now make up the southern portion of the Park was in the town of Nunda. By the time Mr. Letchworth arrived in 1859, the falls and environs were part of Portage to the east, and Genesee Falls to the west. So the history of Letchworth Park is interwoven with the history of the three towns and plays an important role in the book."
