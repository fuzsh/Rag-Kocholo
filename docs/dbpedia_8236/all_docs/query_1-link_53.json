        "text": "In value-driven design to explore why people buy Louis Vuitton bags. The purpose is to change the way people think about luxury branding and purchasing behavior. Materials (High-quality leather): People need to know that the high-quality leather used in Louis Vuitton bags signifies durability and luxury, attracting those who seek premium products. Design (Iconic pattern and Shapes): The iconic patterns and unique shapes of Louis Vuitton bags are instantly recognizable, creating a sense of identity and style. Craftsmanship (Detailed and meticulous stitching): Companies are spending thousands of dollars on manufacturing, but without understanding the value of meticulous craftsmanship, they miss the mark. Detailed stitching showcases the brand‚Äôs commitment to perfection. Exclusivity (Limited editions and high price): Keep in touch to learn more about how exclusivity works. Limited editions and high prices create a sense of scarcity and desirability, making the bags more coveted. Pattern (Unique logo pattern): In today's world, a unique logo pattern is more than just a design‚Äîit's a status symbol. The distinctive Louis Vuitton monogram is a powerful visual cue of luxury. Celebrity Use (Frequently seen on celebrities): To grab attention, brands need endorsements. Seeing celebrities with Louis Vuitton bags creates a powerful psychological connection and aspirational desire. Experience (Luxurious in-store experience): A luxurious in-store experience enhances the allure of Louis Vuitton, making the purchase feel special and exclusive. Reputation (Reputation for Luxury): Louis Vuitton‚Äôs longstanding reputation for luxury and quality draws customers who want the best. Understanding these psychological triggers can transform your approach to creating compelling, value-driven designs. #valuedrivedesign #neuromarketing #designthinking #advertising #GraphicDesign #neurodesign #3d #consumerbehavior #marketing #business #branding #psychology #digitalmarketing #socialmedia #contentmarketing #Ahsannazram\n\nWWD has mentioned that PORTS 1961 has appointed Francesco Bertolini, who joined the Milan-based label in 2019, as head designer for the brand (the article is attached). The history of Ports is long and full of events. The brand has changed owners, designers, headquarters, and most importantly, aesthetics. I have been following the brand since it launched the 1961 label in 2004. The reason may be surprising to many: this is the only brand, in my opinion, that should have stuck with copying... Prada. We live in a time when fashion trends come from different sources‚Äîsocial media platform influencers versus luxury brands like before. There is a slight issue here: in the past, designer brands not only provided original ideas but also set standards for cutting, colors, prints, etc. This was done by professionals. Currently, the best quality of the \"influencers\" pushing trends through TikTok is their charisma and energy, which contribute to the current situation in dressing. On the other hand, designer brands are moving their ready-to-wear collections into the marketing category, and as a result, are moving ahead without the customer in mind(as long as clothes look great on all the endless runways we have through out the world)... However, Prada has always stood separately, and Ports 1961 started its rebranding in the 2000s by creating an affordable \"Prada.\" It was probably a good idea, giving customers who couldn't afford the original a great way to dress in this specific aesthetic. I thought it was interesting (I wanted the Prada look to be approachable). Currently, the brand is fully focused on China, where the majority of its business comes from. The style is \"housewife who can't afford CHANEL and Loro Piana.\" My wish: can we do \"the woman who can't afford Prada\"? Please. Prada is becoming too conceptual. This is both good and not. Ports 1961 can give clients a little of the Prada style, slightly watered down. Sorry for such a wild idea, but we need to protect fashion from TikTok stylists‚Äîsomehow. #wwd #bof #fashion\n\nDo you shop your #Business and #Organizational solutions from retail department stores or from designer chic boutiques? #CEO #DigitalLeadersSolutions #BelongLeaders The answer depends on whether you want your business to stand out in the crowd or blend in like wallpaper... Those who get their business solutions from big retail outlets can only expect the same as everyone else... But those who get their solutions from chic boutiques, or better still, tailored to their specific needs, will build a more compelling brand presence and market reputation. Most customers want something haute couture ‚Äì unique, tailored, and exceptional. Are you ready to elevate your business to that level? #DigitalCulture #BelongingCulture\n\nLouis Vuitton is the epitome of luxury branding.

Also known as ‚Äòstealth wealth‚Äô, this subdued yet premium mode of dressing is leaving its mark on popular culture. As the term implies, there‚Äôs more than meets the eye when it comes to quiet luxury. At its core, quiet luxury is a resurgent fashion movement that emphasizes investment in high-quality, minimalist pieces that have timeless appeal. This is ‚Äòanti-bling‚Äô ‚Äî the other end of the scale to popular avant-garde designer brands who experiment with bold logos and ostentatious patterns. The quiet luxury convert is less concerned with projecting wealth than creating a wardrobe full of high-end everyday staples that speak to a more sophisticated understanding of style. To the untrained eye, it‚Äôs likely to go under the radar. Think neutral colours, smart tailoring, clean-cut lines and elite craftsmanship. Think logo-less Loro Piana baseball caps, Brunello Cucinelli cashmere sweaters and practically everything from The Row. And yes, there‚Äôs a sustainability element too. By its very nature, quiet luxury aesthetic rejects the vagaries of seasonal fashion, trusting instead in time-honored design. This mirrors the ‚Äòbuy less, buy better‚Äô line towed by those who promote conscious consumption. At Chameleon Collective Recruiting, we take immense pride in our expertise in luxury hiring. Our bespoke approach ensures that we match the perfect candidates with the right luxury brands, creating synergistic partnerships. When you choose us, you're selecting a partner who shares your passion for excellence and understands the art of luxury like no other. #LuxuryRecruiting #LuxuryTrends\n\nüí° ‚ö° How a 175-Year-Old #Luxury #Brand Stays Young: The Blueprint of Loewe's Strategic Collaborations for Long-Term Success in the Luxury Market... #Loewe has once again demonstrated its innovative approach to fashion through its recent collaboration with On , blending high fashion with performance wear.
