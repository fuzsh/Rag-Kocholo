        "text": "Total travel time (5 minutes)\n\nFor information regarding the actual Village please refer to my tour on “Letchworth Village, Theils NY”. This tour will describe the actual cemetery which is located a few miles from the actual village and in the town of Stony Point.\n\nWhat is very sad about this cemetery is that graves markers do not consist of names but numbers and a majority of those interred were children. It’s also odd that the actual cemetery is not actually near the village and makes one wonder why?\n\nSince the children housed at Letchworth Village were wards of the state one wonders if their treatment was entirely ethical. We do know that the Polio vaccine was tested here in 1950. (Please copy and paste the LOHUD article below).\n\nhttps://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/rockland/stony-point/2018/10/04/look-letchworth-village-meet-people-who-impacted-village/1443112002/\n\nThere are also allegations of non-ethical treatment of these children. For sake of this tour I will refrain on any of that discussion however wanted to point it out. At its inception, Letchworth was an ideal facility where learning impaired children were taught to be productive members of society and trained in a vocation. Sadly most articles seem to capitalize on it’s less than perfect history. I’ve spoken to a few people who were familiar with the facility when it was in operation and have received nothing but positive information. Google searches, sadly, overwhelmingly report the opposite. I will leave that discussion for you to explore. Needless to say, the cemetery is surreal, tucked away, and out of view. From 1914 to 1967 0ver 900 children were buried in its confines. Their head stones are plain metal markers forged with numbers and lacking dates and/or names.\n\nIn 2007 a memorial plaque was erected with the identify of those buried here as well as the epitaph : THOSE WHO SHALL NOT BE FORGOTTEN. But the names do not correlate to any of the numbers on the markers so it would be difficult to tell whom is buried where.\n\nYou can google directions on line as they are pretty easy to find. However for some reason Google maps will direct you to the area across the street and not the actual cemetery so while driving please look on both sides of the street. You should be on Cal Hallow road. There is an easy to spot Marker on the road and that will guide you.\n\nThere is a small graveled parking lot. Please park and head onto the gravel trail. You will walk about fifteen meters and the cemetery will come into view with the Monument and seating being the first thing you see.\n\nThe graves liter a small hill. An overwhelming majority are mere numbers however there are a few scattered which are more conventional and complete with names and dates.\n\nThe monument which was erected in 2007 contains the names of the interred but not ages nor dates. There is also no way of determining which grave belongs to which name; However please spend time to pay your respects. There is a small seating area in front of the monument.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this tour, enjoy nature, and most of all RESPECT OUR HIDDEN HISTORY!\n\nIf you like what you saw, don’t forget to JOIN MY BLOG or SHARE MY BLOG .
