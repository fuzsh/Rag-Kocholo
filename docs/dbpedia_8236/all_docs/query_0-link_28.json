        "text": "Today marks the opening of a new “nature trail for all” with the Autism Nature Trail (ANT) at Letchworth State Park in Upstate New York.\n\nA grand opening ceremony was held this morning, Oct. 1 at 11 a.m. in the park to celebrate the trail which has been designed to allow visitors with autism and other developmental disabilities to push boundaries, explore new activities and develop skills. According to the governor’s office, the trail is the first of its kind in the nation.\n\n“Our hope is that the Autism Nature Trail will become an exemplar, widely replicated, taking from what we learned in the seven-year process of creating a first-of-its-kind experience in nature. While others retrofit public places to make them accessible, we have created an accessible place and made it public—and that has made all the difference,” Loren Penman, an Autism Nature Trail co-founder and member of the Genesee Regional Park Commission said.\n\nAs reported by RochesterFirst, this trail has been in the works since 2017 and construction began in 2021 with the support of $3.3 million in private funding. The $3.7 million dollar project has created a one mile out-and-back hiking loop that includes eight marked sensory stations, each designed to address a different sensory experience in a safe and supportive environment. They include:\n\nSensory Station: where a collection of leaves, moss, fossils, animal fur, acorns and other objects are to be touched, handled, and even smelled\n\nSunshine Slope: a gentle maze in an opening that includes a viewing platform, three cuddle swings, and an “Alone Zone”\n\nMusic Circle: where a variety of nature-inspired musical instruments encourage creativity, either alone or with others\n\nCuriosity Corner: an open space with a gliding seat, ant-shaped boulders, and access to a shortcut back to the beginning of the trail\n\nReflection Knoll: a quiet point halfway on the trail under a canopy of trees, with etchings of woodland creatures hidden in the boulders\n\nMeadow Run and Climb: a place with paths to run, jump and balance along serpentine berms and an obstacle course\n\nDesign Zone: where visitors can manipulate materials from along the trail into patterns and structures\n\nPlayful Path: a place of twisting paths with different surfaces including coarse gravel, log rounds, and sand\n\nThe Nook: an area of carefully spaced seating set under a natural canopy\n\nCelebration Station: As the final stop on the trail, this area has a place for visitors to express themselves through writing and drawing about their experiences while visiting the ANT.\n\nThe trail is also set up to allow for safe social distancing and planned interaction. The ANT is completely ADA-compliant with trails both wheelchair and stroller accessible. It can be found near the Humphrey Nature Center in Letchworth State Park with full access to a large parking area, restrooms and WiFi.\n\nProgramming for the trail comes from the nearby Perry Central School District in Wyoming County and Rochester’s Camp Puzzle Peace, an Adirondack summer camp for families living with developmental disabilities. Camp Puzzle Peace already has a list of theme weekends scheduled for October to play on fall foliage, animals getting ready to hibernate, and some trick-or-treating practice on the trail.\n\nIf parents are unsure about how their child will do with hiking the ANT, Camp Puzzle Peace encourages them to register for one of their assisted walks.\n\nOften called the “Grand Canyon of the East,” Letchworth State Park is one of the most picturesque places in Western New York. It boasts nearly 600-foot cliff walls and three major waterfalls along 17 miles of the Genesee River. There are four entrances to the park, and its mass covers nearly 15,000 acres.\n\nIn 2020 the state park opened a new Lower Falls Recreation Area filled with new table games, badminton and pickle ball courts, bocce and shuffleboard, as well as a fitness loop.\n\nFind more information about the Autism Nature Trail including guidebook, event schedule, and more activities, visit their website.
