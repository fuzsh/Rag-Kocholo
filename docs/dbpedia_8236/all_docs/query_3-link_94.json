        "text": "Flexi Season tickets are valid for 8 days of travel within a 28-day period. Please note: If you select 1 year, you are entitled to 12 tickets valid for 28 days each, as most commuters are entitled to 4 weeks of annual leave plus bank holidays. If you are travelling 3 days a week, you will need more than one Flexi Season ticket in a month.\n\n7-Day Season tickets are valid for 7 consecutive days and are a cheaper option if you travel 3 or more days within 7 days.\n\nMonthly Season tickets are valid for a full calendar month. You can also purchase a Custom Season ticket for longer than a month at the same discounted rate.\n\nAnnual Season tickets are better value than monthly tickets if you need 10 months or more of travel, offering you the equivalent of 12 weeks worth of free travel a year.\n\nPay as you go with contactless is not included in the Season Ticket Calculator, however it could be a good option for your regular travel depending on your journey and preferences. When you pay as you go with a contactless card or device, you can benefit from daily and Monday to Sunday caps into and within London.\n\nVisit our pay as you go with contactless page for more information."
