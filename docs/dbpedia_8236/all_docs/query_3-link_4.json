        "text": "Letchworth State Park in Western New York is beautiful and awesome. How awesome? Here are 12 facts about the park that we found to be particularly amazing.\n\nScott Schild | sschild@nyup.com\n\nThe park is huge\n\nIt travels along the Genesee River for more than 17 miles. It covers parts of two counties, Livingston and Wyoming, and is within parts of five different towns: Leicester, Mount Morris, Portage, Castile and Genesee Falls. There are four entrances to the park, and its mass covers nearly 15,000 acres.\n\nScott Schild | sschild@nyup.com\n\nThe waterfalls in Letchworth are some of the most beautiful in the East\n\nThere are many vantage points which offer stunning views of the cascades and the surrounding woodlands. The three main falls are named in a rather plain (some might say dull) fashion: Upper, Middle and Lower. In total, there are nearly 50 waterfalls in the park.\n\nmuseumofdisability via flickr\n\nThe Park is named for William Pryor Letchworth (1823-1910)\n\nHe made his fortune in the iron business and was involved in charity work for most of his adult life. A special passion of his was the treatment and care of the mentally challenged, the poor and endangered juveniles. He served with distinction on many national charitable boards and conferences. He bought the initial property on which the park is located and later bought other large tracts of surrounding lands.\n\nDrew Chenelly via flickr\n\nLetchworth built his mansion,Glen Iris, here beginning in 1859\n\nHe named it such after a rainbow he spotted the very first time he stepped off a train while traveling through the future park. An old Indian saying told of the \"sun lingering longer over the glen here than any other place it shone.\" He added the word iris, which is a synonym for a rainbow. Today, Glen Iris is a beautiful restaurant and overnight inn which offers great food and eye-popping views of the park. One of the guest lodges, The Stone House, is located across from Inspiration Point, giving it one of the best views on the grounds.\n\nJim Shanks via flickr\n\nInspiration Point is considered to be the premier viewing point in the park\n\nIts scope includes miles of the Genesee River roaring below and the sheer 600-foot walls of the canyons on either side. Two of the three large falls can be seen from this vantage point. Letchworth State Park is known as \"The Grand Canyon of the East.\"\n\nJim Michalowski via flickr\n\nThe grave of Mary Jemison is one of the most popular sites in the park\n\nJemison, the \"White Woman of the Genesee,\" was captured by Shawnee Indians when she was 15 years old and was adopted into their tribe. She later married a Delaware Indian named Sheninjee and bore him a son named Thomas (after her own father). After Sheninjee's death, she married a Seneca Indian and had six more children. Mary was a beloved member of the tribe and was a skilled negotiator in dealings with tribal land issues. She died in 1833 in Erie County at the age of 90 years old. Nearly 40 years later, William Pryor Letchworth took interest in her story and had her body moved back to the park where it was reinterred next to a cabin she had lived in. A magnificent statue of Mary, in full Indian dress, stands near her grave.\n\nScott Schild | sschild@nyup.com\n\nIn 2016, nearly 750,000 people visited Letchworth State Park\n\nThis ranks it as one of Upstate New York's Top 5 most visited state parks, behind Allegany, Green Lakes, Saratoga, and Niagara Falls State Park.\n\nScott Schild | sschild@nyup.com\n\nThe Portage Viaduct is the name a train trestle which crosses over the park at Upper Falls\n\nThe Erie Railroad Company built its first wooden bridge here in 1852. At the time, it was the tallest and longest wooden bridge in the world. It was destroyed by fire and the railroad built a newer iron bridge in its place in 1875. The bridge is still in use (sporadically) today. Although the view from the bridge surely has to be one of the best anywhere, it is illegal to walk across it. A new $70 million bridge was approved in 2014 and is in the planning stage.\n\nFred O'Bryant via flickr\n\nThe Mount Morris Dam is situated near one of the entrances to Letchworth State Park\n\nIt was built between 1948-1952 to mitigate flood damages in the Genesee River Valley and the Rochester urban areas further north. The cost was $25 million. Thousands of visitors, to the dam and Letchworth Park, stop here for the aerial view of the massive concrete dam and the park downriver. The William Hoyt Visitor Center here offers full amenities, picnic areas, restrooms, a gift shop and food.\n\nThis photo of Letchworth State Park is courtesy of TripAdvisor\n\nIn a 2015USA Todaynewspaper poll, Letchworth State Park was named the best state park in the United States\n\nNot a bad feather in the cap considering there are nearly 8,000 state parks in the country!\n\nCarl Mueller via flickr\n\nLetchworth State Park is truly a hiker's paradise\n\nWith more than 65 miles of hiking trails, you can seek out (on foot) all of the wonders the park has to offer. There are 21 numbered trails (and one \"secret one\") including Gorge Trail (7 miles), which offers a view of Inspiration Point; Footbridge Trail (.05 miles), which is short but offers the only way over the gorge from east to west via a stone bridge; Smokey Hollow Trail (2.5 miles), which takes you past several of the park's smaller waterfalls; and Gibsonville Trail which takes you by an old abandoned Civilian Conservation Camp from the 1940s.Want to know a secret? Ask for directions to the whopper of them all, the Letchworth Trail (20 miles). This trail is part of the 900-mile long Finger Lakes Trail System, and it is unnumbered in the park.\n\nRyan Livingston via Facebook\n\nOne of the newer traditions in the park is the Letchworth State Park \"Dollar Blessings\" ritual\n\nHikers leave rolled up dollar bills along the hiking trails for others to find. These bills are accompanied by handwritten blessings and messages of inspiration.\n\nScreengrab from LetchworthParkHistory.com\n\nThe tragic history of Letchworth State Park"
