        "meta_description": "An official Path Through History Site! Letchworth State Park is known as the “Grand Canyon of the East.” This 14,350-acre scenic park features year-round recreation and scenic beauty including three large waterfalls between cliffs, as high as 600 feet in some places, each carved by the Genesee River and surrounded by lush forests. There are 66 miles of hiking trails within the park but you can easily bike or drive to each scenic spot of interest as well. The park’s new Autism Nature Trail (the ANT) is a one-mile hiking loop that includes eight marked sensory stations, each designed to address a different sensory experience in a safe and supportive setting, using nature and natural materials as the tools for skill-building. Letchworth offers trails for horseback riding and biking, as well as nature, history and performing arts programs, guided walks, tours, whitewater rafting, kayaking, a pool for swimming, games area, and hot air ballooning. Feel the sprays of Middle Falls while eating lunch at Glen Iris Inn, within the park itself. Winter offers snowmobile trails, cross-country skiing, and tubing. Be sure to check out the popular Humphrey Nature Center and the William Pryor Letchworth Museum.",
