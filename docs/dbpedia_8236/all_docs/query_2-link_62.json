        "text": "The status of households depended on their land and resources. The largest groups recorded are:\n\nVillagers and freemen: around 40% of households, villani, socmani and franci homines were small-scale landholders, owning on average 30 acres of land, and two oxen for ploughing.\n\nSmallholders and cottagers: around 35% of households, bordarii and cotarii owned about 5 acres of land on average and might have had a share in the villagers' plough teams.\n\nSlaves: around 10% of households, servi owned no land of their own, belonged to the lord, and may have been used as ploughmen.\n\nDomesday records the heads of families, so the total population was probably around five times larger.\n\nOther households are sometimes noted, including priests, widows, burgesses (townspeople), and Frenchmen (probably a local military presence).\n\nFor more information, see the Hull Domesday Project's guide to the peasantry and occupations.\n\nArable land was recorded in different units, including:\n\nPloughlands, carucates, hides: A ploughland (terra carucis or carucata) was the area that could be ploughed by eight oxen in a year. Generally around 120 acres, though the area varied depending on the quality of the land. Learn more.\n\nPlough teams: Groups of eight oxen (which indicated how much land could be ploughed): sometimes belonging to the peasants and sometimes to the lord.\n\nOther taxable resources were also recorded, including:\n\nWoodland: Usually quantified by the number of pigs it supported. About 15% of the country was forested in 1086.\n\nMeadow and pasture: Used to graze animals, typically sheep.\n\nMills: Water mills were the main source of power besides oxen: more than 6,000 are recorded in Domesday.\n\nFisheries and salthouses: Important economic resources: the salt industry is the most fully documented industry in Domesday. Tax on fisheries was often paid in fish.\n\nFor more information, see the Hull Domesday Project's guide to manors and to weights and measures.\n\nLivestock was not consistently counted in Domesday Book. It is mainly recorded in Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk, and sometimes in Cornwall, Devon, Dorset and Somerset.\n\nWhere livestock is recorded, it counts only the animals belonging to the lord.\n\nNonetheless, sheep, goats, cows, pigs, cattle, and cobs (horses) are all recorded in substantial numbers. Sheep are by far the most numerous animal recorded.\n\nFor more information, see the Hull Domesday Project's guide to livestock.\n\nMost entries record the total annual value of the estate in 1086 and 1066. This was probably to help the Crown calculate how much tax the lord should be charged.\n\nSome estates gain in value between 1066 and 1086: others lose value, and some are wiped out entirely.\n\nFor more information, see the Hull Domesday Project's guide to taxation and tax assessment.\n\nDomesday carefully records the owners of each manor (estate) in 1086, as these were the people liable for tax. All land was ultimately owned by the Crown, but held by lords, who provided military resources or tax in return.\n\nTenant-in-chief in 1086: The main landholders listed in Domesday Book. Either King William himself, or one of around 1,400 people who held land directly from the Crown, mostly Norman knights.\n\nLord in 1086: The immediate lord over the peasants after the Conquest. Sometimes the same as the tenant-in-chief, sometimes a tenant granted the estate in return for tax.\n\nDomesday also records the equivalent owners before the Conquest in 1066. For more information, see the Hull Domesday Project's guide to landholding."
