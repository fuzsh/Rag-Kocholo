        "text": "Meet The Team: Tony Bannister - Digital Print Operator Tell Us About Your Printed Easy Journey: I started seven and a half years ago when it was Falkland Press, initially printing on a Series 3 HP Indigo press. Now, I predominantly run our two Series 4 B2 HP Indigo presses. Fun Fact: I'm a lifelong Arsenal fan, supporting them at home, away, and abroad. These days, you‚Äôll often find me cheering on my local non-league team, Bishop Stortford, on a Saturday afternoon. ‚öΩ What Do I Like About My Job: The changes and advancements in the digital world have kept this old boy on my toes! Plus, I've made some really good friends along the way.\n\nMeet The Team: Julius Mhuka - Digital Print Night Shift Supervisor Tell Us About Your Printed Easy Journey? I joined the company in February 2016. I operate machines including HP Indigo 12000, 100K, 7900, 7K, 6800, and 6700 in the digital department. I began my printing career in 1986 as a print finisher apprentice and transitioned to a digital printer in 2006. I hold a BA in Print Media Management. A Fun Fact: I play darts and am a devoted family man. I don‚Äôt worry about things I cannot solve. I love life! üéØ What Do You Love About Your Job: I thrive on solving machine issues and exchanging work ideas with my colleagues. I'm driven to work smarter and am very quality conscious. #meettheteam #printedeasy #behindthescenes\n\nMeet The Team: Alex Franklin - Finishing Operator Tell us about your Printed Easy working journey? I started in 2021 as a bench hand after finishing maternity leave from my previous job. I was seeking a role that fit around my children, and after speaking with my friend Jon (Printed Easy MD), he offered me a part-time position, and I haven‚Äôt looked back. Since starting, I've worked in various departments and roles, such as collating, binding, and operating the Multigraphs (short-run scoring & folding machine). A Fun Fact: I love chicken Sunday roasts swimming in gravy‚Äîthe more gravy, the better! üçó What Do You Love About Your Job: The people. Everyone is so friendly and welcoming, which makes me look forward to work.\n\nThrowback Thursday Join us on a journey through time as we look back at the evolution of our factories over the years! üè≠ 1.

I joined Printed Easy, which was then a small subsidiary of Falkland Press, as their General Manager in 2015. As Printed Easy expanded over the years, we shifted our focus entirely to the online space and eventually closed Falkland Press. I now predominantly manage marketing, design, UX, and all aspects of Printed Easy's presentation. I've been in the printing industry since 1998 but have focused on the online side of the industry since its inception around 2010. Fun Fact: I was a bit of a trance raver back in the late '90s and early 2000s. ü§™ What Do I Like About My Job: Pretty much everything. We‚Äôre a very dynamic business with extremely talented team members, so no day is the same. If I had to pick one thing I really enjoy, it‚Äôs diving into thousands of cells of data and trying to find a pattern‚ÄîI'm a bit of a data nerd.
