        "meta_description": "During the late 19th century, William Pryor Letchworth was a businessman, humanitarian, and philanthropist that thought of the idea of creating a mental health community village that would serve mentally and physically mentally disabled individuals of all ages. Letchworth’s ultimate goal was to build an alternative living environment that had included a countryside farming area where patients could work and grow their own crops. He wanted his ideal mental health facility to strain away from the inhumane asylums that were popular during that time period.  However, William Pryor Letchworth died before seeing the facility open and began to function. Letchworth Village Asylum became a place where patients dealt with horrific treatment and endured an experience that was far from a positive environment for those who had struggles with their mental health. What was supposed to be a rehabilitation center for the mentally disabled, ended up becoming a living nightmare that was kept secret away from the public.",

        "text": "The Letchworth Village grew to become more than 130 buildings on 2,000 acres and was designed to care for and board about 3,000 patients. The final completion of Letchworth Village occurred quickly in which the institution resides at the heart of three towns: Haverstraw, Thiells, and Stony Point. The acres surrounding the mental facility provided a vast amount of leisure space for patients. In addition to Letchworth Village being constructed to be a more humane environment for the mentally disabled, it also benefited nearby towns due to employing about 10,000 locals during the mental institution's peak. There were separate living spaces and training facilities in order to segregate children, women, men, and the elderly. The construction for each of the dormitories was only to be two stories and to house only 70 patients. The structure included in the large area of land at Letchworth Village Asylum were a hospital, laboratory, dining halls, housing arrangements for faculty. Other additional buildings on the asylum’s land included a gym, theater, Sunday school, firehouse, boiler house, laundry rooms, a refrigeration plant, bakery, storehouse, workshops, and administrative offices.\n\nLetchworth Village was described and promoted to be the most ideal place for an individual who was mentally disabled and praised highly by the public. However, over time rumors began to surface on how the patients at Letchworth Village were being neglected, malnourished, and mistreated by the faculty and medical staff. Many of the children of Letchworth Village suffered through the most cruelty and mistreatment from the staff members. The children often looked sick and endured extreme cases of malnourishment due to the lack of food, water, and basic necessities, based on the recollections made by staff and visitors at Letchworth Village. There were many reports made that alleged the neglect of the patients and accused Letchworth Village of having poor funding.\n\nBy 1921, there were approximately 1,200 patients at Letchworth. Then by the 1950s, the village was overpopulated with over 4,000 patients. And by the 1960s, the number of patients increased to over 5,000. Due to overpopulation issues, the state had made the decision to not build more structures, leading to patients being packed into dormitories. The majority of families of the patients were responsible for overpopulation due to them abandoning and neglecting their relatives at Letchworth Village and never returning or visiting. Over time the state of New York and Letchworth Village was discontinuing the operation of the majority of its structures and relocated patients into group homes. Letchworth Village Asylum closed down in 1996 due to methods of segregating patients that were developmentally disabled were replaced with a method toward normalization and inclusion into society. The state has made efforts to sell the property but failed to. Most of Letchworth Village’s structures were due to be demolished in 2004 in order to create a 450-unit condo development, but the plan has evidently been seized. Today, the remains of the Letchworth Village Asylum are damaged due to failing building structure, wildlife, mold, and graffiti from individuals who have passed through the site.\n\nThere is a site only a mile away the remains of the Letchworth Village Asylum named The Nameless Cemetery, that can be visited in the current day. At The Nameless Cemetery, there are hundreds of t-shaped markers with only numbers labeled on them to represent the deceased patients from Letchworth Village. Not many visit the gravesites and it was by requests of the families for the graves of the deceased to remain nameless even after death. Few of the deceased patients' families made efforts to remember their relatives or to have their family names inscribed on the stones of the mentally challenged. In the last few years, the New York state agencies and advocates funded the creation and installation of a memorial plaque now placed at the front of the cemetery. The memorial plaque is inscribed with the words \"Those who shall not be forgotten\" and a list of the silent deceased patients.\n\nLevine, David.
