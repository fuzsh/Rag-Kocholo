Letchworth State Park, also known as the "Grand Canyon of the East," is one of the most scenically magnificent areas in Upstate New York and the entire country. The Genesee River flows North through the gorge over three major waterfalls between cliffs as high as 600 feet in some places and surrounded by lush forests. Visitors can choose among 66 miles of hiking trails that are also available for horseback riding, biking and cross-country skiing. Letchworth offers nature, history and performing arts programs, guided walks, tours, a summer lecture series, whitewater rafting/kayaking and hot air ballooning. In 2015, Letchworth won the USA TODAY Readers' Choice Award for Best State Park in the United States! Letchworth came out on top of the 19 other state parks nominated for the contest, chosen from over 6,000 parks across the nation.
