Propsearch.ae is a Dubai property portal that hosts ads from a number of local real estate agencies. In addition we offer a comprehensive set of community and building guides to help property buyers, renters and investors learn about the areas and buildings that they may wish to live or invest in.

Any enquiries sent regarding a specific property go directly to the estate agent that advertised the property and Propsearch does not play any role in any transactions that may result. Enquires that are sent directly to Propsearch are forwarded to a trusted partner agency that is best suited to handle the enquiry.

Please note that whilst we have a large database of buildings and developments, Propsearch is not a property developer, nor an agent, nor an architect, nor a construction contractor.
