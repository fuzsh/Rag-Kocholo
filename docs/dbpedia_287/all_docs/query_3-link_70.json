        "text": "Hours\n\nOpens 1/2-hour before sunrise; closes 1/2-hour after sunset.\n\nRoads\n\nMany roads inside the park are one-way. Five Mile Drive offers access to Owen Beach, Fort Nisqually, the off-leash dog area and many stunning viewpoints. All parking is free.\n\nTrails\n\nMiles of foot trails crisscross the park. Primary trails have signage while secondary trails do not. None are designated for bicycles.\n\nRemember: Please don’t feed wildlife.\n\nDune Peninsula\n\nThis brand-new park is the result of three years of transformation from Superfund toxic wasteland to expansive parkland.\n\nWith sweeping views of Puget Sound and Mount Rainier, Dune Peninsula offers 11 acres of trails, landscapes, “sail mound” viewpoints, a small pavilion and plenty of benches and tables for picnicking.\n\nWilson Way Bridge\n\nConnecting the peninsula and Ruston Way with the rest of Point Defiance Park is the 605-foot-long, 50-foot-high Wilson Way foot bridge. Slides and stairs offer a fun way to descend to the marina from the east end of the bridge.\n\nOwen Beach\n\nA favorite place to relax and enjoy our beautiful shoreline, Owen Beach offers picnicking, kayaking, low-tide exploration and more.\n\nPoint Defiance Park is full of wildlife, from harbor seals lounging on rocks to orcas cruising off-shore, from deer nibbling on leaves to bald eagles swooping overhead to fish.\n\nThen there are the massive Douglas firs and Western red cedars, undergrowth of green salal and ferns, and tiny insects and fungi. You’ll even find our iconic Pacific Northwest banana slug, one of the biggest in the world.\n\nExplore and connect with wildlife in parks – but let them stay wild. Please don’t feed them, touch them or interfere with them. We all call this planet home."
