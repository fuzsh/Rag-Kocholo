        "text": "Street Sweeping within the Urban Services District is scheduled from March through November, weather permitting. During this period, city street sweeping services are provided to curbed and uncurbed residential streets and to the Central Business District.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT\n\nResidents who have signed up for Street Sweeping Alerts will receive an alert one week prior to Street Sweeping being conducted in their general area. A second alert will be sent one day prior to the actual sweeping of their street.\n\n\"No Parking\" signs will be posted prior to 12 p.m. on the business day before street sweeping will occur. Residents should not park on designated streets 7 a.m. until 5 p.m. even if it appears a street has been swept because the street sweepers may return.\n\nNo Parking Zones cover both sides of the street even though signs may be posted on only one side of the street. Vehicles parked on streets scheduled for cleaning are subject to citation and/or towing.\n\nStreet Sweeping will be conducted each day on either east/west bound streets or north/south bound streets to allow residents to find alternate parking.\n\nResidents are prohibited from blowing leaves out of their yards and sidewalks onto a public roadway in accordance with City Ordinance 97.071. Those in violation of this ordinance may have the areas in front of their residence omitted from being swept because street sweeping vehicles are not designed to collect large amounts of leaves.\n\nSIGN UP FOR STREET SWEEPING ALERTS\n\nTo subscribe to street sweeping alerts, visit Louisvilleky.gov and click on \"Address Lookup.\" Enter your address and choose it from the dropdown. Click on Street Sweeping Reminders to sign up to be notified by email or text.\n\nUnsubscribe or edit your subscriptions\n\nVisit the GovDelivery help center\n\nWhy is street sweeping important? It helps remove debris from the gutter and roadsides that would otherwise go into storm drains, causing water pollution.\n\nORDINANCES\n\nCity Ordinance 72.037: Parking Restricted to Allow Street Cleaning\n\nThe Director of Public Works and Solid Waste Management Services is authorized to designate daily street sweeping areas for cleaning. The Director shall post suitable \"No Parking\" signs on the street to be cleaned the day prior to its cleaning. Vehicles parked on a posted street on the designated cleaning day is in violation of this ordinance and a citation to include a civil fine of not less that $20 and not more than $100. For more information on parking ordinances and paying or appealing parking tickets, contact the Parking Authority (PARC).\n\nCity Ordinance 72.128: Impoundment of Vehicles Improperly Parked\n\nIn addition to civil citation and fines, Metro Louisville Government may impound a motor vehicle parked, stopped, or standing upon a street or public way in violation of the ordinance for prohibiting parking. Louisville Metro may condition the release of an impounded vehicle upon the payment of any outstanding unpaid citations, towing, handling, and storage charges imposed, unless the owner or other person entitled to possession challenges the validity of the impoundment pursuant to City Ordinance 72.129. A vehicle may be released to the owner or other person entitled to possession only upon proof of ownership or right to possession.\n\nCity Ordinance 97.071 (2) and (3): Removal of Materials on Public Roadways"
