Speed cameras may be fixed or portable, and are placed along the roadway to automatically record speed limit violations. After a sworn law-enforcement officer affirms the violation, a speeding citation is mailed to the owner, lessee, or renter of the vehicle as determined by the license plate.\n\nSpeed Camera Programs in the Region\n\nIn 2020, the Commonwealth of Virginia passed a law authorizing the use of speed cameras in school zones and work zones. Alexandria is joining several communities across Virginia in implementing a speed camera program, including Arlington County, Fairfax County, and the City of Fairfax. Speed cameras are also widely used in Washington, D.C. and Maryland.\n\nSpeed Camera Safety\n\nSpeed is a primary factor in how often crashes occur and how severe they are. The likelihood that a crash will kill or severely injure a person increases as speed increases. The City’s Vision Zero goal is to eliminate fatal and severe crashes by 2028, because no loss of human life is acceptable on our roadways.\n\nSpeed cameras are a critical tool in improving traffic safety. The U.S. Department of Transportation has identified speed cameras as a proven safety countermeasure. According to USDOT, speed cameras can reduce crashes by over 50%. Speed cameras also free up traffic safety officers in the City to handle other duties and provide better enforcement coverage citywide.\n\nSpeeding is a significant contributor to deaths on our roadways and is particularly hazardous to people walking, especially older adults and children:\n\nHigher speeds increase a driver's reaction time and braking distance:\n\nHigher speeds reduce a driver's field of vision:\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat are speed cameras?\n\nSpeed cameras are a tool to automatically record speed violations. After a sworn law-enforcement officer affirms the violation, a speeding citation is mailed to the owner, lessee, or renter of the vehicle as determined by the license plate.\n\nWhy is the City launching a speed camera program?\n\nThe City’s Vision Zero goal is to eliminate fatal and severe crashes by 2028. Speed safety cameras are a proven tool for reducing speeding, changing driver behavior, and building safer communities. Speed safety cameras also free up traffic safety officers to handle other duties to better meet citywide traffic enforcement needs.\n\nThe City of Alexandria utilizes state-of-the-art digital cameras and proven violation detection technology to help decrease potential violations and collisions at school zone locations across the city.\n\nSpeed safety cameras have been shown to be effective in pedestrian-related injuries and reducing crashes by more than 50%, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Most importantly, communities that use speed safety cameras consistently report safer roads around their schools. The program helps ensure that drivers pay more attention and obey traffic control devices.\n\nWhere are speed cameras allowed?\n\nThe Code of Virginia allows the use of speed cameras in school zones and work zones.\n\nWhere are school zone speed cameras located?\n\nSchool zone speed safety cameras are located within 15-mile-per-hour school zones at the following locations.
