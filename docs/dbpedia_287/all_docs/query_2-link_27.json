In the Amsterdam dialect moving house was/is indicated by pulling on a rope (coming down from a pulley hanging on one of those hooks.)\n\nHouses in Amsterdam which were build as homes and never as storage area are also build with the hooks, I think up to this day, as people still use the methods. I think even as recent as the last 10 years, there were still hooks build onto the buildings."
