From sculpture like Martin Puryear’s stately Pylons, to Mary Miss’ intriguingly beautiful land and water installation South Cove, to Agnes Denes’ pioneering environmental work Wheatfield – A Confrontation, BPCA has a long history of presenting art from a diverse range of artists that powerfully transforms public space, encourages social cohesion, and promotes awareness about cultural, environmental, and civic challenges. As part of its strategic plan, BPCA has renewed its efforts as a place that cultivates the art for our time, evidenced by recent temporary installations such as Sunrise/Sunset (Revolution) by Autumn Ewalt and Dharmesh Patel, the debut of Blessing of the Boats by Muna Malik, and The House That Will Not Pass For Any Color Than Its Own by Mildred Howard."
