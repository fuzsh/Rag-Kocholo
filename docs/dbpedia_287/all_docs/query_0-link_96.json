        "text": "University Canada West has two easily accessible campuses in downtown Vancouver. Our stunning new Vancouver House Campus, located at 1461 Granville St. and our West Pender Campus, located at 626 West Pender St. in the historic London Building.\n\nOur new campus at Vancouver House is in one of the highest-profile developments in Vancouver’s recent history. The campus includes more than 90,000 square feet of space in two of the podium buildings in the iconic Vancouver House development, a globally recognized project designed by architect Bjarke Ingels of BIG.\n\nVancouver House is in the Beach District, Vancouver’s newest neighbourhood, and is near Granville Island, Sunset Beach, English Bay and Vancouver’s 28-kilometre seawall, the world’s longest uninterrupted waterfront path.\n\nOur West Pender Campus currently occupies six floors of The London Building, a heritage office building that dates back to the early part of the 20th century. It is in the heart of Vancouver’s financial district and just steps away from public transit, including the Waterfront SkyTrain Station, bus routes and the SeaBus terminal. The vibrant and lively neighbourhood is full of restaurants, stores, entertainment options, shopping centres and fitness facilities."
