        "text": "In October 2009, the Walkway Over the Hudson State Historic Park opened as a legacy project of the Hudson-Fulton-Champlain Quadricentennial. The park provides access to the Hudson River's breathtaking landscape for pedestrians, hikers, joggers and bicyclists. The bridge deck stands 212 feet above the river's surface and is 6,768 feet (1.28 miles) long, making it the longest, elevated pedestrian bridge in the world.\n\nThe Poughkeepsie-Highland Railroad Bridge was built in the late 19th century to link New York and New England to an extensive, nationwide railway network. For decades, it was a major rail corridor for both freight and passengers.\n\nAfter a fire in 1974, the bridge was abandoned and sat for decades as an orphaned relic. The park was made possible due to the unwavering commitment of the community, who, through a non-profit organization called Walkway Over the Hudson, forged a public-private partnership involving the State of New York, the federal government, neighboring municipalities, private corporations and other not for profit groups. The amazing result of this partnership is Walkway Over the Hudson State Historic Park, one of the Hudson Valley's top attractions.\n\nRide the glass elevator up to the park or down to the Poughkeepsie waterfront and be treated to great views of the surrounding scenery and the structure of the bridge. The elevator is located at Upper Landing Park (83 N. Water Street, Poughkeepsie, NY), a short walk from the Poughkeepsie Train Station. While there is no vehicular parking at Upper Landing, parking can be found in the surrounding area. Visit http://upperlanding.org/parking/ for details. Although leashed pets are allowed on the Walkway, only service animals are permitted on the elevator. Bicycles can be brought on the elevator.\n\nThe park offers interpretive signs and a Talkway Over the Walkway cell phone tour. There is also an audio tour available online in English, Spanish and Mandarin at https://walkway.org/walkway-audio-tours.\n\nReminders:\n\nCheck the Hours of Operation tab to find opening and closing times.\n\nThe Golden Park Pass does not apply at this park.\n\nThere are access points to the park on both sides of the Hudson River:\n\nEast side of the River (Dutchess County) 61 Parker Avenue Poughkeepsie, NY 12601\n\nDirections:\n\nBy train: Walkway Over the Hudson State Historic Park is located just 4 blocks north of the Metro North and Amtrak station in Poughkeepsie. If the elevator is open, exit the station via the Water Street exit and walk north for five minutes to Upper Landing Park, on the left. Otherwise, take a 15-minute walk to Washington Street to climb the staircase up to the bridge.\n\nBy car: take Route 9 to Route 9G north (Marist Drive). Bear right onto Washington Street. Proceed on Washington Street for 0.5 miles. Turn left on Route 9G/Parker Avenue. Walkway's parking lot is on the left side.\n\nWest side of the River (Ulster County) 87 Haviland Rd.
