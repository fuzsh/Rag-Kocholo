        "text": "Origins\n\nIn the 1620s, English colonists began to enslave Native people in and around Boston. Later, English colonists captured and enslaved Native people during the Pequot War (1636-1638) and King Philip’s War (1675-1676).\n\nEnslaved Native people worked in households, farms, and various industries. English colonists also trafficked many captured Native people to places as far away as the Azores, Barbados, Bermuda, Jamaica, and Madagascar. There are still descendants of these Native people living in the Caribbean today.\n\nIn July 1637, Captain William Peirce sailed the Desire from Boston with 17 enslaved people from the Pequot Nation, including 15 children, eventually selling the enslaved Pequots in the Caribbean. In February 1638, the Desire returned to Boston carrying cotton, tobacco, and the first recorded arrival of enslaved Africans.\n\n“We sent fifteen of the boys and two of the women to Bermuda, by Mr. Pierce…Mr. Pierce, in the Salem ship, the Desire, returned from the West Indies after seven months…and brought some cotton, and tobacco, and negroes, etc., from thence” Governor John Winthrop’s Journal, 1637-1638\n\nThe Desire’s voyage began a cycle of trafficking local Native people to the West Indies where they were sold as slaves in exchange for African captives and other goods.\n\nProminent townspeople of Boston and the surrounding area enslaved many members of the Pequot Nation. Governor John Winthrop enslaved Wincombone and her children as domestic servants and messengers\n\nWincombone was the wife of Pequot Sachem (leader) Mononnotton and known for her patience, intelligence, compassion, and diplomacy. Following the Fairfield Swamp Fight during the Pequot War of 1636, English colonists captured Wincombone and her children.\n\nNative people were first to be enslaved in Boston.\n\nBy 1700, there were more than 1000 enslaved Africans and Natives living in New England. Over the next six decades, the enslaved population grew dramatically and became overwhelmingly African. Between the 1630s and the 1760s, more than 17,000 enslaved Africans arrived in New England.\n\nDuring Metacomb’s Rebellion (King Philip’s War) of 1675, English settlers captured and enslaved more Native people from the Massachusett, Wampanoag, and Nipmuc nations.\n\nBefore 1700, most enslaved people in Boston were Native American.\n\nMany Native enslaved people maintained connections to their nations despite their status.\n\nPaul Cuffee and Crispus Attucks both had Wampanoag and Black parents. Enslaved Black men outnumbered enslaved Black women in Boston 3 to 2 resulting in many children born from Native and Black couples. Cuffee found ways to use his Native and Black heritage to find wealth and success as a ship captain and merchant. Attucks, a sailor,was the first person killed during the Boston Massacre on March 5, 1775.\n\n19th century depiction of the events of the Boston Massacre in 1775 emphasizing the death of Crispus Attucks, a Black and Wampanoag man.\n\nThe Boston Massacre Site Marker is located at the intersection of State and Congress Streets, near the approximate location of the violent confrontation.\n\nEnslaved people in Boston worked as domestic servants, artisans, and sailors. Boston’s enslavers used slaves in their own homes or businesses or hired their labor out to others. Some allowed their enslaved people to conduct their own business, although the enslaved would not financially benefit.\n\nEnslaved people were visible on the streets of Boston because their daily tasks brought them in close contact with other Bostonians.\n\nBy 1720, there were more than 1500 enslaved people living in Boston, or about 12% of the town’s population at the time. Enslaved people would make up between 10-12% of Boston’s population throughout the early and mid 1700s. Boston was the center of New England slavery and more than 30% of the region’s enslaved population lived in the town. As such, enslaved people were always readily available for purchase or sale. Beyond those buying and selling enslaved people, many Bostonians supported the slave trade including printers, who facilitated slave sales through advertisements in local newspapers.\n\nSome Bostonians participated directly in the trafficking of enslaved people:\n\nThey trafficked enslaved Native people and exchanged them for African captives in the Caribbean until the 1680s.\n\nMost commonly, they trafficked enslaved Africans between places in the Americas.\n\nInfrequently, they engaged in the transatlantic slave trade, which trafficked captives from Africa to the Americas.\n\nFaneuil Hall is known as the “Cradle of Liberty,” yet Peter Faneuil built the fortune that paid for this building, in part, by buying and selling enslaved people.\n\nPeter Faneuil was personally responsible for trafficking African captives to Boston where they were enslaved.\n\nCaesar was an enslaved Black boy living in the same house as Thomas Apthorp, the young white son of Charles Apthorp, one of the richest men in Boston. Charles Apthorp, like Peter Faneuil, was a slave importer and dealer.\n\nThe Apthorp mansion stood on what is now State Street. There, Caesar and the other four people enslaved by the Apthorps, Will, Scipio, Ben, and Mimbo, were expected to serve members of the family. These people helped care for Charles and his wife, Grizzell Eastweek. They also helped raise their eighteen children, including Thomas.\n\nCaesar lived alongside and helped to support the Apthorp family’s luxurious lifestyle, but he was unable to experience that lifestyle for himself. Apthorp luxuries included a custom whizzer toy for Thomas found during an archaeological dig at Faneuil Hall.\n\nWhy Silhouettes? There are almost no surviving depictions of people of color in early Boston. These silhouettes aim to humanize these individuals whose appearances we do not know, though we recognize that using images of other people to represent known once-living individuals is problematic. Consider how race, wealth, privilege, and other social structures led to the ways individuals are depicted in this exhibit.\n\nEnslaved Bostonians worked in four main categories of labor: household service, unskilled work, skilled craft, and seafaring. Within these areas, enslaved people could work directly for their enslaver, be hired out by their enslaver, or set the terms of their own labor.\n\nEnslaved labor was crucial for Boston’s economy. Enslaved people worked in nearly every major industry in and around Boston, including farming, shipbuilding, distilling, and construction. Without slave labor many of these industries would have collapsed. Working in these industries meant enslaved people were skilled workers.\n\nCharlestown potters Isaac and Grace Parker were enslavers of Jack and Acton in the 18th century. Their pottery was important for the local economy and export during the middle decades of the eighteenth century. Wares from this pottery were found during archaeological digs at Faneuil Hall, and can also be found as far north as Nova Scotia and as far south as South Carolina.\n\nJack and Acton were exceptional potters who created some of the most striking domestic ceramics in 18th-century America.\n\nMany Boston artisans enslaved people, using their labor to improve the success of their businesses. We only know of Jack and Acton’s presence at the pottery works of Grace and Isaac Parker in the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston because they are listed as chattel property in Isaac’s estate.\n\nEnslaved men like Jack and Acton provided a wide variety of labor at the pottery works. Archaeologists have excavated the Parker pottery in Charlestown and also found wares that had been made there during excavations at Faneuil Hall. These pottery goods were very popular and vessels likely made by Jack and Acton have been found as far north as Nova Scotia and as far south as South Carolina.\n\nEnslaved men worked on ships, performed work in their enslavers’ businesses, were day laborers, and performed domestic labor. Domestic workers would have been responsible for driving vehicles, horse care, running errands, general labor, and cooking.\n\nEnslaved Bostonians worked in homes and were trained craftspeople, day laborers, and sailors.\n\nThese ceramic fragments were found at Faneuil Hall by archaeologists and were likely made at the Parker Pottery by Jack and Acton.\n\nEnslaved sailors were relatively common, and often the items in ships’ holds were directly related to enslaved labor. Sugar molds found archaeologically at Faneuil Hall were made by enslaved people in the Caribbean. They were then filled with molasses-rich sugar by enslaved sugar plantation workers, sailed to Boston on ships employing slave labor, sold to refineries where the molasses was turned into rum by enslaved distillers, and then served at taverns with enslaved workers.\n\nTo control enslaved people, town and colonial officials passed restrictive laws targeting people of color, regardless of whether or not they were enslaved .\n\nIn Boston, enslaved and free people of color had a 9pm curfew, could not possess firearms or liquor, were prohibited from gathering in groups, were prohibited from marrying white people, and were not allowed to join civic associations such as militias.\n\nPunishments for breaking these laws ranged from public whipping to exile to hanging.\n\nFollowing his death in 1743, Peter Faneuil’s estate included five unnamed enslaved people. His brother Benjamin Faneuil inherited this estate and presumably became the enslaver of the five individuals, possibly including Peter.\n\nWhile most resistance was non-violent, some enslaved people used arson, assault, poisoning, or murder to fight back. Any violent resistance was met with immediate, dramatic punishment, often death.\n\nAlthough there was never a large slave rebellion in Boston, in April and May 1723, there were a series of arsons targeting politicians which convinced many white Bostonians that enslaved people sought to burn the town down. One enslaved man, Diego, was ultimately apprehended, interrogated, and executed after confessing to the crime.\n\nEnslaved people resisted their enslavement, but violent resistance was often punished by death.\n\nIn large homes near Boston in what are today the neighborhoods of Roxbury and Dorchester, many enslaved people worked on farms and rural estates. At the Shirley-Eustis House in Roxbury, at least five enslaved people, including multiple children, worked on the estate, served the occupants of the house, and caring for Governor William Shirley’s horses and farm.\n\nJane was an infant enslaved by Governor William Shirley. She was baptized at King’s Chapel on April 1, 1746. Historian Aabid Allibhai describes Jane’s experience in his study of the enslaved people at the Shirley-Eustis House in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston:\n\n“Jane was likely torn from her parents, either given away to Shirley for free by an owner who viewed her as an economic burden or given to him as a gift; enslaved children in New England, in the words of Massachusetts Historical Society founder Jeremy Belknap, ‘were given away like puppies.’”\n\nJane was one of many enslaved children in colonial Boston. Although some were from local slave marriages, Boston enslavers were frequently indisposed to having extra mouths to feed.\n\nWhile infants were often unwanted by enslavers, white Bostonians did purchase many 7- to 15-year-old children from Africa and the Caribbean. These children could be raised in white households and learn a trade.\n\nEnslaved children \"were given away like puppies.\"\n\nA Boston advertisement for an enslaved girl to be given away in the July 22, 1765 edition of the Boston-Gazette and Country Journal.\n\nA Boston advertisement for the sale of two enslaved boys, in the August 25, 1766 edition of the Boston-Gazette and Country Journal.\n\nJane and Sebastian, an enslaved couple, managed to create a life for themselves and their daughter Jane despite being forced to live in separate homes by their enslavers.\n\nSebastian lived in the home of his enslaver, John Waite, and Jane lived in the home of her enslaver, Deborah Thayer, around 1700 near the intersection of what is today Washington and Winter streets. Despite Sebastian presenting his daughter for baptism and being listed as the head of their family, Jane resided with her mother and was the property of her mother’s enslaver. Although there is a lack of archival documents associated with many Black Bostonians, Sebastian’s, Jane’s, and little Jane’s story suggests that enslaved families in Boston were centered around the mother, not the father as with European and West African families.\n\nTheir daughter Jane was baptized in 1701 in the First Church where their family worshiped in the separate gallery space above the main congregation, a seating area for enslaved people and servants. We have no record of Jane and Sebastian marrying.\n\nIt was not until 1705 that free and enslaved people of color were allowed to marry other people of color, including free Blacks, mixed race people, Natives, and fellow enslaved people. This law also forbade people of color marrying white people. With the permission of their enslavers, many enslaved Bostonians married.\n\nIn 1705, enslaved Bostonians were legally allowed to marry but only to other people of color.\n\nBoston Schoolmaster Nathaniel Williams and his wife Anne Bradstreet enslaved Hagar and Richard in their home on School Street from 1708-1734. Through enslaved labor, the Williams household was able to educate Boston’s future leaders and participate in the elite lifestyle of Boston’s genteel class.\n\nArchaeological work at the Boston Latin Schoolmaster’s house revealed hundreds of sewing pins as well as cowrie shells. Archaeologist Kathleen von Jena connected the cowrie shells and pins to Hagar and Richard, a Black man also enslaved by the Williams family. Von Jena suggests Anne may have run a sewing school for upper class girls who were not able to attend the Latin School but were still expected to learn decorative sewing as part of their upbringing.\n\nMany of these wealthy girls would also have enslaved women at their homes doing the bulk of the sewing work. Hagar’s work in the Williams’ home allowed the white women in the household to pursue a more leisurely lifestyle.\n\nThe Williams family was part of the 25% of Boston families who enslaved people. Like Hagar, 71% of enslaved women performed domestic labor in homes. Her tasks included making and mending clothes, childcare, food preparation, and tending yard animals, orchards, or gardens.\n\nSewing Pins and cowrie shells from the Boston Latin Schoolmaster's House, likely associated with Hagar, a woman enslaved by the schoolmaster's family in the early 18th century.\n\nDetail of a 1723 John Bonner map showing the location of the Free School (Boston Latin School) and the neighboring schoolmaster's house on School Street, now the Old City Hall property.

Leventhal Map & Education Center at the Boston Public Library.\n\nChloe Spear was a pillar of her community, running a Boston boarding house that also served as a multicultural gathering space. In her 1815 will, Chloe bequeathed hundreds of dollars to her family as well as Black community members.\n\nChloe was born in Africa around 1749 and was enslaved in the early 1760s by Boston merchant John Bradford and his wife. In the Bradford home, Chloe engaged in several occupations, including nursing sick neighbors and children. Though some enslaved people were encouraged to read, when Chloe began to learn, John Bradford threatened to hang her by her thumbs and whip her if she continued.\n\nShe met and married Cesar Spear,with whom she had seven children. After Massachusetts abolished slavery in the 1780s, the Spears purchased property on White Bread Alley, now Harris Street in the North End.\n\nChloe outlived her entire family. Her estate reflects her incredible life as a free woman after decades of enslavement. Her estate inventory, shown below, includes many everyday household items, as well as several luxury goods including an ebony tea table, a mirror, and pictures.\n\nChloe Spear, born in Africa, enslaved in Boston, and later freed, gave hundreds of dollars to Black Bostonians upon her death.\n\nPeter Fleet, an enslaved printer, worked at the print shop of Thomas Fleet, carving woodblock prints to illustrate written text among other responsibilities. Peter literally left his mark on much of the work he created, effectively claiming it as his own.\n\nPeter Fleet, enslaved at a Boston Print shop, left his own initials on this woodcut print. “The Prodigal Daughter”, Graphic Arts Collection, Special Collections, Firestone Library, Princeton University.\n\nPhillis Wheatley, the famed enslaved Black poet, was born in Senegambia in 1743, kidnapped as a child, and taken to Boston where she was enslaved by John and Susanna Wheatley. Phillis learned to read and write, becoming the first Black woman to publish in British North America. Phillis used the words of her poetry to critique the newly freed country that still practiced slavery:\n\n“With thine own hand conduct them and defend\n\nAnd bring the dreadful contest to an end —\n\nForever grateful let them live to thee\n\nAnd keep them ever Virtuous, brave, and free —\n\nBut how, presumptuous shall we hope to find\n\nDivine acceptance with the Almighty mind —\n\nWhile yet (O deed ungenerous!) they disgrace\n\nAnd hold in bondage Africa’s blameless race;\n\nLet virtue reign — And those accord our prayers\n\nBe victory ours, and generous freedom theirs.”\n\nWhile some enslaved people were able to publicly express their identity and resistance, still others did so in private. This included private gatherings and keeping objects like cowrie shells and blue beads with African traditional meanings.\n\nEnslaved people never lost their identity, their personhood, or their cultural connections to their ancestors.\n\nCharles Bowles was one of many enslaved people who found means of escaping enslavement.\n\nAt the age of fourteen he enlisted in the Massachusetts militia during the 1775 Siege of Boston. Two years later, Bowles decided “to risk his life in defense of the holy cause of liberty,” joining the Continental Army where he would serve until the end of the War of Independence in 1783. Now free, Bowles went on to become a farmer and minister in New Hampshire.\n\nThroughout the 1760s Black people in Boston called out the hypocrisy of white colonists demanding their freedom from British “slavery” in the lead up to the American Revolution.\n\nEnslaved and free Black Bostonians began agitating for an end to slavery. They used many methods such as purchasing their freedom, advocating for manumission (the act of an enslaver freeing an enslaved person), joining the military, running away, or suing for their freedom in what was called a freedom suit.\n\nPrince Hall, a Black man who received his freedom in 1770, founded the first Black Masonic lodge in 1775. African Lodge Number One became a center of the Black community and Prince Hall was a tireless advocate for the rights of Black people.\n\nHall was one of many free and enslaved Black Bostonians forced to form their own community support structure, including churches and civic organizations. These organizations became important community centers and places to advocate for abolition and civil rights.\n\nEnslaved people engaged in a constant battle to resist slavery and find freedom. By the early-1760s, many enslaved people had achieved freedom, creating a free Black community in Boston. Although this population remained relatively small—just a few hundred people in the 1760s and 1770s—free Black Bostonians were important champions of abolition and civil rights during the Revolutionary Era.\n\nZipporah Potter Atkins was one of Boston’s free Black residents. She was born in 1645 to an enslaved couple, Richard and Grace. Richard and Grace were enslaved by Captain Robert Keyne and lived at his home at what is now the corner of Washington and State Street.\n\nUsing an inheritance from her enslaved father, Zipporah became the first Black person to own property in Boston, purchasing land in what is today the Boston Greenway near the North End\n\nMany other Black and Native people were either born free, freed by their enslavers, or arrived in Boston as free people during the 17th and 18th centuries. Despite their freedom, racism made it difficult for free Black Bostonians to find stable jobs and support themselves and their families.\n\nFree Black Bostonians were tireless champions of civil rights and abolition during the colonial and revolutionary eras. Between 1773 and 1777, Black Bostonians, free and enslaved, petitioned the colonial and revolutionary governments for their freedom seven times\n\nNot all Black Bostonians were enslaved.\n\nAfter twenty years of activism by enslaved and free Black people and their allies, slavery officially ended in Massachusetts in 1783.\n\nDick was the son of Binah, a woman enslaved by John Morey of Roxbury. At 5 years old he was sold into indentured labor to David Stoddard Greenough at the Loring-Greenough House in Jamaica Plain. He should have been freed in 1783, but Greenough bought the boy in 1785 and enslaved him until his 21st birthday. Many towns, such as Boston and Roxbury where Dick lived, also required Black parents to bind their children out as indentured servants, threatening to destroy Black families and communities in the aftermath of slavery.\n\nDespite the success that Black Bostonians had during the Revolutionary Era, enslavement, often by other names and means, lingered on. Judicial authorities had little ability to enforce the 1783 Commonwealth v. Jennison decision that had declared slavery incompatible with the 1780 Massachusetts Constitution.\n\nMany white Bostonians were unconcerned about the fate of Black people following the “end” of slavery. This indifference created opportunities for unscrupulous people to kidnap and sell free Black people out of the state to places where slavery was still legal.\n\nBlack children, especially, were often victims of kidnapping and continued bondage. Unfreedom continued beyond the legal end of slavery."
