        "text": "Unless you see any other restrictions, such as permit zones, paid parking meters, street sweeping signs or posted time limits, you can park in one spot for up to 72 hours.\n\nIf you are parked beyond this time, you can be issued a warning and be given a parking ticket or even towed. This holds effect even if you have a permit to park in that area, such as a disabled placard or residential parking permit\n\nIn summary, in order to avoid a ticket for violating the 72-hour rule, be sure to move your car to another spot.\n\nStreet cleaning signs and regulations prevent vehicle owners from blocking the path of street sweeping trucks, which keep our streets clean. Once a street sweeping truck has swept the curbside, you can park your car there, even if the posted sweeping hours have not expired.\n\nAlways check for street sweeping and parking signs. Look 100 feet in both directions for any parking signs and double check the curb to see if there are any color curb markings. Note that you can't park until the street has been physically swept during street sweeping hours. See any defaced, deficient or missing parking signs? Please call 311.\n\nThe preferential residential parking system was created to foster the safety, health and welfare of all San Francisco residents by cutting down on unnecessary personal motor vehicle travel, noise and pollution. It also aims to promote the use of public transit and improvements in air quality, convenience and attractiveness of urban residential living areas. The main goal of the program is to provide more parking spaces for residents by discouraging long-term parking by people who do not live in the area. There are now 28 residential permit areas in the City.\n\nSee if your address qualifies for a Residential Parking Permit.\n\nIf you don't have a permit in a permit area, you will need to move your vehicle after the posted time limit, time limits are usually one to two hours. As well, the law requires you to move one block away or at least one-tenth of a mile, about 500 feet. In short, do not simply drive around and then park in the same block, or you can get a parking ticket.\n\nBlue zones are parking spaces for people with a valid disabled parking permit. With the exception of street cleanings, tow-away zone restrictions or when restricted by a special event or a construction permit, blue zone regulations are effective 24/7. For more information about parking with a disabled placard, please refer to your disabled placard identification card from the DMV. Never block access to a blue zone or park in one without a valid placard/permit. The fine is severe and your vehicle may be towed.\n\nBlue zones are normally located in areas with high public use, such as:\n\nParking lots and garages\n\nDense commercial areas\n\nNear public parks and playgrounds\n\nHere's a list of blue zones on public streets.\n\nGreen curbs are reserved for short-term parking situations that do not exceed 10 minutes. Standard effective hours are 9:00 am to 6:00 pm, Monday through Saturday. Green meters will either have a 15 or 30 minute time limit in metered areas. Cars parked in a green zone in excess of posted time limits can receive a ticket. Cars bearing disabled plates or placards are exempt from the time limits for green curbs.\n\nGreen meters/curbs are usually used for:\n\nSmall neighborhood grocery/deli convenience stores\n\nDry cleaners\n\nFlorists\n\nAudio-visual repair shops\n\nShoe repair shops\n\nPostal shipping centers\n\nHardware stores\n\nVideo rental stores\n\nATM machines\n\nYellow zones are only for active freight loading and unloading by commercial vehicles. Be sure to watch out for signs close by or stencils on the curb for effective hours. Note that if the sign specifies that the area is in a tow zone, vehicles without a commercial license plate parked in a yellow zone will be given a parking ticket and will be towed.\n\nLoading zones for six-wheel trucks are noted by signs only. Six-wheel trucks can use this zone when signed for six wheels or more. Six wheel loading zones can typically be distinguished by their red-capped meters in metered areas. Yellow zones are usually reserved for large companies or properties that deliver and receive a lot of shipments.\n\nWhite zones are designed for passenger loading and unloading during key hours and have a time limit of five minutes. Nearby signs or stencils on the curb should usually list the effective hours. When loading or unloading, the driver needs to stay with the vehicle at all times - limited exceptions apply at hospitals and preschools. Vehicles parked in a white zone can receive a citation and be towed. White zones are typically used for:\n\nHospitals and medical offices\n\nSenior centers\n\nRestaurants with a 100 or more seats\n\nValet parking, hotels, apartment or condominium buildings with over 50 units\n\nTheaters, churches or other large places of worship or assembly\n\nSchools and government buildings\n\nYou can pay by coin, pay-by-phone, credit card (Visa, MasterCard and Discover) and the SFMTA parking card. Please see below for a description of meter types:\n\nRed and Yellow Meters - Red and yellow metered parking locations are reserved for commercial vehicles during the day but regular cars can park outside the hours specified. To be safe, be sure to read the small signs attached below the meter.\n\nGreen Meters - Green metered parking locations are limited to 30 minutes during regular hours.\n\nMotorcycle Meters - These meters are for motorcycles only.\n\nIf you get a parking ticket and want to dispute it, you need to do it within 21 days from the date the ticket is issued or from the date of the first notice. Protests will not be considered after that length of time has expired. Don't pay for a parking ticket if you decide to dispute it. For more information on how to pay for a parking ticket, please visit the SFMTA site."
