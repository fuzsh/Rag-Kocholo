That being said, we would never recommend something to you that we donât stand behind 100%.\n\nWhere to Stay in San Francisco: The 4 Best Places to Stay\n\nFor this guide, weâre going to jump right into it, because weâve got a lot of ground to cover.\n\nOur philosophy when it comes to deciding on a place to stay is to first choose the neighborhood, then move on to finding a great hotel, hostel, or apartment in that area.\n\nThe reality is that, depending on what youâre looking for, there are other neighborhoods not included in this guide that might meet your needs. But these are the ones that we think are the best for 99% of travelers, and weâve shown our work, doing our best to explain why we think that.\n\nIn general terms, we think that the best places to stay are located within the âdowntown coreâ, which weâre calling the triangle made up of the Financial District, Union Square, and Nob Hill.\n\nWeâve also included a neighborhood (really, a combination of a couple of adjacent neighborhoods) if youâre looking for a place to stay that has a bit more of a neighborhood feel.\n\nThe biggest problem with finding a place to stay in SF is the fact that, outside of that downtown core (and Fishermanâs Wharf), there really are very few hotels and guesthouses. The city has very much intentionally grouped hotels near Union Square, saving real estate in the rest of the city for residents.\n\nHowever, there are a few places that weâll cover below where there are some good places to stay that will offer a less urban, more residential feeling, which is generally what we prefer when weâre traveling.\n\nFor each of the neighborhoods below, weâve created a structure to help you figure out if itâs the right home base for you.\n\nHereâs what weâll cover:Â\n\nAn overview of the neighborhood and our experience with it. Weâve personally been to and explored (more than once) all of the areas on this list, so weâll try to give you a little bit of our perspective on what makes each area special.\n\nPros and cons of staying in this area. The things you need to know to make your decision.\n\nHighlights of the neighborhood. Coffee shops, restaurants, parks, etc that we enjoyed, and think you probably will too.\n\nA collection of a few places to stay that stood out to us. Sometimes itâll be because they have rooms with Golden Gate Bridge views, sometimes itâs the rooftop pool, sometimes itâs that the hotel offers a great value given the location.\n\nNow, weâre well aware that a few of you are currently ready to throw your left shoe at the screen, saying âI donât have time to read all of that, JUST TELL ME THE BEST PLACE TO STAY!â\n\nWell, hereâs a quick summary of this guide if youâre short on time (though weâd recommend reading the section of the place you end up staying for tips and places to add to your list!).\n\nOur overall top recommendation for visitors of all kinds is Nob Hill. We lived in Nob Hill for years before leaving San Francisco, and itâs our favorite part of the city. It also happens to be super central, full of good places to eat and drink, and has a couple of great hotel options. Weâve personally stayed at Petite Auberge on our first return to the city after moving away, and itâs a lovely French-themed B&B in a nice location near the bottom of the hill (they also have a sister hotel called the White Swan Inn a few doors down, which gets slightly better reviews). We also walked by the Stanford Court Hotel on California Street at the top of the hill on a daily basis for years, and were delighted to see that it recently got a full remodel (and is where weâd probably stay on our next trip).\n\nIf youâre on a budget, youâll find a better selection of affordable options near Union Square. While itâs convenient in terms of location and the fact that it has the highest concentration of hotels in the city, the neighborhood itself sucks. Itâs all chain stores and chain restaurants, and if you stay here, weâd advocate for spending as little time as humanly possible near the hotel, and as much time in literally any other part of the city (except maybe the Tenderloin). We love CitizenM hotels (and have stayed in multiple locations around the world), and would recommend their highly rated location in San Francisco (not great for families or those who want bigger rooms, though).\n\nIf youâre in San Francisco for business or you want to stay on the waterfront â known as the Embarcadero â stay in the Financial District. Walking the Embarcadero â the waterfront strip at the eastern edge of the city â is a must-do while youâre in San Francisco, and the Financial District is adjacent to it. FiDi itself isnât particularly interesting (especially on the weekend, when it is DEAD), but the Embarcadero is excellent. If you want to stay on the waterfront, you have two options. 1 Hotel San Francisco is gorgeous, but trends towards the luxury end of the spectrum. The Harbor Court Hotel is in a similar location with a more affordable price tag.\n\nIf you want a more residential area where locals actually live, check out the area near Alamo Square. In the guide below, weâve sort of smushed together a couple of adjacent neighborhoods to form one big strip between the downtown core and the residential neighborhoods near Golden Gate Park, and we think this would be a lovely home base for exploring the city. The biggest problem is that there arenât that many places to stay. Weâd look at either the Grove Inn, a guesthouse right off of Alamo Square (where youâll find the Painted Ladies and all the beautiful Victorians and Edwardians), or the Hotel Kabuki in Japantown.\n\nHereâs a map of the areas we recommend so you can get a feel for how they fit together from a geographical perspective.\n\nA brief note on Airbnb (and other vacation rentals) in San Francisco: Despite being headquartered in San Francisco, it is functionally illegal to rent out an entire house or apartment that you donât live in for the majority of the time in SF. Which is why you will see very few offerings on the market, and those that do exist are often a private room. We could go on and on here about why you shouldnât use Airbnb in cities with a tight housing market (soâ¦all of them?), but the takeaway is to choose hotels in SF (because theyâre really your only option).\n\nNob Hill: Our #1 Recommendation (Where We Lived)\n\nLook, we should probably acknowledge the fact that weâre absolutely biased here. Alysha lived in Nob Hill when we met a decade ago, and a few years later when we decided to move in together, we moved into a tiny apartment in the heart of Nob Hill.\n\nThe fact that Alysha chose to continue living in Nob Hill for a few more years should be as good a stamp of approval as you could possibly need. We lived here until we quit our jobs and moved out to bet it all on this travel website in early 2020 (WHOOPS).\n\nItâs central. Itâs charming. It has tons of places to eat and drink. Itâs a great place to live, and it will absolutely make a great home base for exploring the city.\n\nHowever, all that said, we also stay here when we return to SF, and absolutely stand by our recommendation based on our own experiences here as residents and visitors.\n\nIt is at the top of a hill, so take that into account if you have mobility issues. You can always call a Lyft or Uber to get around though. Parking is notoriously difficult, so itâs probably best to visit Nob Hill without a car if you can (you donât need to rent a car in SF anyway).\n\nPros and Cons of Staying in Nob Hill\n\nHere are the pros and cons of staying in Nob Hill as we see them as former Nob Hill residents and current tourists.\n\nPros of Staying in Nob Hill\n\nItâs charming. Tree-lined streets (we particularly like Hyde Street, which is where we used to live and has the advantage of the cable car running along it), great views out over the city and the Bay, lots of activity at all hours. Thereâs a reason we chose to live in Nob Hill (which was a budgetary stretch for us and the tiny apartment we lived in didnât have room for a dresser in the bedroom, but it was worth it!).\n\nItâs full of great places to eat and drink. This is probably the best part about Nob Hill. Between the options in the neighborhood along Polk and Hyde (and Bush) and the options in neighborhoods immediately adjacent to Nob Hill (Chinatown and North Beach), there is so much good food to be had here.Â\n\nItâs central with good transit connections. While itâs not walkable to BART â the Bay Areaâs version of a subway â we donât think thatâs really super relevant if youâre going to be staying in SF anyway. Instead, we think the bus and cable car connections are the important things to look for, and Nob Hill has that. You can take the cable car down to the Embarcadero, Union Square, or Fishermanâs Wharf (both lines run right through Nob Hill), and thereâs a ton of bus routes that will take you elsewhere (including a route up Van Ness that will take you to the Golden Gate Bridge).\n\nCons of Staying in Nob Hill\n\nParking is a nightmare. When we moved to Nob Hill, Matt got rid of his car because parking is just horrible. Itâs dense, and thereâs not nearly enough parking spots for the number of people that live here (not to mention visitors). PLUS thereâs a time limit (two hours) on most parking in the neighborhood unless you have a residential parking permit. If youâre staying here and you have a car, plan on paying to park your car at the hotel.\n\nâ¦Itâs a big hill. When people talk about the fact that San Francisco is a city full of hills, Nob Hill is usually the one theyâre referring to. Itâs nice to walk down the hill to, say, North Beach or the Embarcadero, but thereâs no getting around the fact that, at some point, youâre going to have to go back up (and the Cable Car or the 1 â a bus route â are a good way to avoid walking).\n\nLack of options means itâs expensive. Nob Hill is fairly residential â at least as far as a central neighborhood in SF can be residential â and there really arenât that many options in terms of places to stay. There are a few really good options that weâll cover below, but theyâre popular and youâll want to book early.\n\nNob Hill Highlights\n\nHere are some of our favorite places in Nob Hill, in no particular order.\n\nThe view from the Alice Marble Tennis Courts: Right near the top of Lombard St on Hyde St, youâll find one of our absolute favorite views in the city from a public tennis court (Matt used to play basketball here). You can find it here on Google Maps, and you can see out to the west to the Pacific Ocean and Golden Gate Bridge from here.\n\nThe view from the top of California Street: Another quintessential San Francisco view is the view from the top of California Street where it starts to head down the hill towards the Financial District and the Bay Bridge. Bonus Points if you get a cable car in the foreground. Hereâs the spot on Google Maps.\n\nThe Coffee: Two of our favorite coffee shops in San Francisco are right here in Nob Hill. First is the Coffee Movement, which brings in specialty coffee from roasters all over the world (mostly light roast) and brews it perfectly (with fun specialty drinks too!). Second is Saint Frank, which is a roaster on Polk St that has more interior seating and a more traditional menu.\n\nUpcider: A great cider bar with an unbelievable number of taps and bottles of cider available (food is NOT gluten free).\n\nBobâs Donuts: There are a lot of fancy, modern donut shops in SF, and this one isâ¦not that. Itâs a good old school donut shop in the sense that thereâs a giant wall of donuts that cost less than $5 each, the interior looks like itâs straight out of a 90âs sitcom, and they have one of those drip coffee makers with a hot plate. However, I used to bring these into work for big meetings and random Fridays, and people would go CRAZY for them. NOT GLUTEN FREE.\n\nThe nightlife: There are a ton of great places for a night out in Nob Hill (in addition to Upcider above), and it depends on what youâre looking for. Go to the Tonga Room for tropical cocktails in a fun environment (itâs like a Rainforest Cafe in that it has over the top decor and it rains, but WAY better). For good cocktails, go to Hi-Lo Club on Polk. For a good vibe and cozy bar, head to Peacekeeper. For craft beer, go straight to Liquid Gold on Hyde St. For wine, Robberbaron is the spot.\n\nThe Best Places to Stay in Nob Hill\n\nThere are a couple of places to stay in Nob Hill that we think youâll like, but youâll need to be prepared for the price tag. This is one of the nicest areas in the city, and the prices here reflect that.\n\nPetite Auberge: A French-Inspired B&B (Where Weâve Stayed)\n\nAfter we moved out of the city, we decided to do a quick staycation and return to our old stomping grounds in Nob Hill.\n\nWe chose Petite Auberge because, along with the sister hotel next door â the White Swan Inn â it feels like the most charming hotel in the area.\n\nIn fact, itâs much closer to a bed & breakfast than a hotel. They describe it as part bed & breakfast, part boutique hotel, which seems accurate based on our experience.\n\nThe guesthouse sits in a nice spot on Bush Street, walkable to Polk Street and a bunch of great bars and restaurants, walkable to the Financial District and Ferry Building, and walkable to BART.\n\nNext door is one of the best pizza spots in the city â Del Popolo â which actually does room service for Petite Auberge. Up the block on Bush is one of our favorite cocktail bars in the city, Peacekeeper.\n\nThe point is that the location is great.\n\nBut what about the rooms? Theyâre very French-feeling, with floral print wallpaper and wooden furniture. Some rooms have a fireplace, which we very much enjoyed. The rooms are fairly spacious too, which is surprising for a city like San Francisco, which is known for tiny apartments.\n\nLike many buildings in San Francisco, the building is a little bit dated. You can hear the people above you (though, oddly, not next to you) as they move around, and the pipes are loud. But nothing too crazy at all.\n\nThe other thing thatâs cool about this place is that there are various inclusions â breakfast with coffee from local roaster Equator Coffees and pastries, complimentary wine during happy hour in the afternoon, and tea, coffee, and bottled water available throughout the day.\n\nThereâs a nice outdoor patio area where you can enjoy said complimentary beverages, though it was closed when we were there and we had to go to the White Swan Inn next door.\n\nParking is expensive, however, at $50+ a day (only valet available), so weâd recommend avoiding bringing a car here if you can.\n\nThe Stanford Court Hotel: A Mid-Range Hotel in a Perfect Location\n\nWe used to live about five blocks away from Stanford Court, a boutique hotel in Nob Hill, and I regularly walked by it on California Street on the way to catch the bus to work (or on the cable car!).\n\nThis is the best value hotel in San Francisco, at least in our opinion.\n\nThe location couldnât be better â itâs right on top of Nob Hill, and itâs right along California Street, one of the main thoroughfares to get downtown. The famous San Francisco cable car is quite literally outside the front door.\n\nThey took a break in 2020 and early 2021 to completely remodel the place, and it is looking fantastic. Rooms have modern amenities â including USB charging ports! â and all rooms have a mini-fridge in the room.\n\nPlus, youâll have access to their fitness center (which is actually surprisingly nice with Peloton bikes), and you can rent real bikes for free (though, good luck riding them anywhere other than on top of Nob Hill).\n\nYouâll have good coffee from Equator in your room, and tea from Mighty Leaf tea. Both of which are among the best coffee / tea options Iâve ever seen in a hotel room.\n\nLast but not least, they allow pets. But there is a $50 pet fee, which includes a goodie bag with treats and toys for the pup.\n\nWhite Swan Inn: Sister Property to Petite Auberge with an English Theme\n\nThe White Swan Inn is a sister hotel of Petite Auberge above.\n\nThis place is right on the border of Nob Hill and Union Square on Bush Street, but weâre including it here mostly because it is much closer to the Nob Hill aesthetic than the one you find in Union Square.\n\nYouâll find a similar set of amenities here as you do at Petite Auberge: free Wifi, breakfast, evening wine, and in-room fireplaces. The amount of food that these two places give you for free is pretty awesome.\n\nThe biggest difference between the two is that the White Swan Inn is English-inspired, rather than French.\n\nHoliday Inn Golden Gateway: The Best Value in Nob Hill\n\nIn terms of charm, the location of this Holiday Inn isnât the greatest.\n\nItâs right on Van Ness, which is a major thoroughfare with multiple lanes that cuts through the city North/South (itâs also part of Highway 101). Thereâs not a tree in sight, and the walk along Van Ness is loud and full of fumes from the thousands of cars that pass by every single day.\n\nHowever, in terms of practicality, it honestly doesnât get better than this. Being right on Van Ness means great bus connections to BART and other neighborhoods. Plus, itâs about a block from Polk and Hyde, two great stretches of places to eat, drink, and shop, and itâs walkable to Pacific Heights on the other side of Van Ness.\n\nFor what itâs worth, my mom has stayed at this hotel before when she was visiting us in Nob Hill (our apartment was too small for visitors) and itâs a good value.\n\nIs it the sexiest hotel in San Francisco? Probably not. Is it a good, affordable (by San Francisco standards) hotel in a good location? Absolutely.\n\nThey have a fitness center onsite, and have self-parking available for $40 a day (with in and out privileges), which makes this a good option if you have a car and you want to stay in Nob Hill.\n\nBonus points for the fact that they do not have a âdestinationâ or âamenityâ fee here, so the price you see is the price you pay.\n\nUnion Square: The Most Convenient Option for First Timers in SF\n\nAs weâve gotten older and, crucially, more experienced as travelers, weâve come to realize that neighborhoods like Union Square serve an important function for travelers.\n\nSure, itâs not the coolest neighborhood in San Francisco (weâd argue that it actually might be dead last in that ranking), but sometimes you need something more convenient than trendy, especially for a shorter trip or a business trip.\n\nAnd that, my friends, is where Union Square comes into the picture.\n\nUnion Square is basically the centerpoint of the city. Itâs at the base of Nob Hill, and is roughly equidistant to the Mission District, North Beach, and the Embarcadero, and it has â by far â the best selection of hotels in San Francisco.\n\nHowever, itâs also full of chain stores and restaurants (this is where youâll find the Cheesecake Factory and Macyâs, as an example), and thereâs really no highlights to speak of (weâve even omitted the âneighborhood highlightsâ section below because we truly have nothing to put in it).\n\nThe best part about Union Square is that itâs easy to get to other parts of the city, and thatâs why you would choose to stay here (along with the fact that it has a high concentration of hotels, including some relatively affordable options).\n\nOne thing to know if you stay here: The infamous Tenderloin â which youâve likely heard about â is immediately to the west of Union Square (weâd call the border somewhere around Jones Street). I used to walk to work through the Tenderloin on a daily basis, and though itâs not quite as bad as some news reports make it seem, itâs sad to see some of the mental illness and substance abuse on full display in parts of the neighborhood. We wouldnât walk through the Tenderloin at night â just take a rideshare or taxi home if you have to go through it.\n\nPros and Cons of Staying in Union Square\n\nHere are the pros and cons of staying in Union Square as we see them.\n\nPros of Staying in Union Square\n\nItâs as central as it gets. Itâs a 5-10 minute walk (uphill) to the best parts of Nob Hill, and a short ride away from the Mission District, North Beach, and the Embarcadero. In terms of a good central location, it would be hard to beat.\n\nGreat public transit connections (including BART). That central location also means that Union Square has good connections to other parts of the city. Thereâs also a BART Station in the neighborhood (Powell Street Station), which will connect you to the Mission or to places in the East Bay or South Bay like the airport or Oakland. Speaking of the airport, if you fly into SFO, you can take BART to Powell and walk to your hotel from there, saving time (traffic to and from the airport at peak times is no joke) and money (itâs ~$10 one way, compared to ~$30-40 for a rideshare).\n\nThe best selection of hotels of all price ranges. Something weâve noticed as visitors more recently is that there really arenât a whole lot of hotels outside of the main tourist areas like Union Square and Fishermanâs Wharf. Which is arguably good for residents, but makes it hard to find a place to stay in some of the cityâs cooler neighborhoods. Union Square has the best selection of hotels of any neighborhood in SF, ranging from bougie luxury hotels to more affordable options.\n\nCons of Staying in Union Square\n\nItâs lifeless and charmless. Other than MAYBE catching the Hyde Street Cable Car, thereâs really no reason to come to Union Square. Itâs exclusively a utilitarian choice thanks to its central location and good connections to the rest of the city, and we would advocate for not eating a single meal here.\n\nItâs adjacent to the Tenderloin. As we mentioned above, the Tenderloin â San Franciscoâs roughest area â is immediately to the west of Union Square. If youâre not used to seeing a visible homeless population, it will almost certainly make you uncomfortable. Itâs something to be aware of, especially for families with kids.\n\nThe Best Places to Stay in Union Square\n\nHere are a few places to stay in Union Square that caught our eye.\n\nGenerally speaking, weâre going to try to focus on hotels that are on the eastern end of the neighborhood, which is further away from the Tenderloin and closer to Nob Hill, the Financial District, and the Embarcadero.\n\nCitizenM San Francisco: Our Favorite Hotel Chain in the World\n\nCitizenM Hotels are one of our favorite hotel chains in the world, and at the time of writing weâve stayed at three different CitizenM locations around the world (London, Boston, and Seattle â though not at the San Francisco locationâ¦yet).\n\nThis is our NUMBER ONE recommendation in Union Square, and itâs not close.\n\nWeâve recommended them in Seattle, among other places, and would recommend the CitizenM in Union Square here in San Francisco based on our experiences at their other locations.\n\nWhich, spoiler alert, is their whole thing â every CitizenM room around the world is nearly identical, with a huge bed, blackout curtains, and a compact footprint.\n\nIn a city full of expensive, old school, hotels, this is a nice, refreshing, modern change of pace that we very much appreciate.\n\nTheyâre a Dutch hotel chain that has basically made staying in a hotel super easy and streamlined, with all the amenities that modern, younger travelers are looking for (USB charging, climate controls via iPad, and more) while simultaneously stripping out the unnecessary pieces (fluffy robes and slippers or sitting areas, for example) to offer a great value.\n\nThe other thing we like is that, in the interest of simplicity and ease, theyâve stripped away all the slightly different room types you find in most hotels (small vs. small deluxe vs. small deluxe with partial city view), and thereâs exactly one room type available: a small room with a king bed.\n\nNot ideal for groups who arenât comfortable sleeping in the same bed (though, itâs probably about the same price to get one room here as it is to get two rooms at most other SF hotels), but perfect for couples and people who donât mind sharing a bed.\n\nItâs right in the heart of Union Square, a block from the cable car and Powell Street Station (where you can hop on BART to get to/ from the airport or Mission District), and walkable to the Financial District and Ferry Building.\n\nOh, and no silly âamenityâ fees added on! No parking or pets, though.\n\nHotel Emblem: A Stylish Hotel on the North Side of Union Square\n\nWe love the creative vibe of this hip hotel, from the writerâs alcove filled with books in the lobby, to eclectic guest rooms with unique artwork and unusual touches.\n\nYouâll have free WiFi in the rooms, a 55â flat screen TV, book butler, Bluetooth audio system, luxury bath amenities by ROIL and a Nespresso coffee and tea maker!\n\nSome rooms have additional accessibility for those with limited mobility, plus the hotel allows you to bring your pet with you for an additional charge of $75 per pet, per stay.\n\nIf you plan to drive in San Francisco, valet parking is also available at a cost of $58 per night. So probably donât stay here if you plan on having a car, or arrange for alternate parking at a nearby garage for your trip.\n\nThereâs a $34 a day amenity fee, which is honestly absurd, but is a reality of hotels these days.\n\nKeep that in mind when youâre looking at prices, because it can take things from âgood dealâ to âtoo expensiveâ really fast, and itâs better to know that youâre going to be hit with that fee ahead of time to avoid any unpleasant surprises.\n\nPalihotel San Francisco: A Beautiful Hotel on the Border with Nob Hill and FiDi\n\nThe gorgeous Palihotel San Francisco is on the border between Union Square, Nob Hill, and the Financial District, and offers great access to all three. Plus, itâs a few blocks from Chinatown, which is well worth exploring.\n\nThe hotel, set inside a charming, historic building, has 82 king and queen rooms, a full service restaurant, bar and lounge.\n\nGuest rooms feature exposed painted brick walls, Smeg fridges, minibars, 43â HDTVâs, custom bath products and work spaces. They are comfortable and stylish, offering en-suite facilities and a spacious space to relax in after a day of exploring San Francisco.\n\nIf youâre traveling to San Francisco with a car, you can self-park at Palihotel for $45 per night (which is honestly relatively affordable) and bring your dog with you for an additional charge of $100 per pet, per stay (though they have to be 30lbs or less).\n\nNoPa, Alamo Square, & Japantown: Where to Stay for a More Local Feel\n\nSo weâre grouping a bunch of different distinct neighborhoods here because, for the most part, they offer a very similar vibe, theyâre adjacent to each other, and they collectively offer an alternative to the very urban feel of the previous neighborhoods weâve talked about so far.\n\nThe main reason is that there are very few places to stay in this part of the city â which is a strip of land west of the downtown core of Union Square, Nob Hill, and the Financial District â and it doesnât make sense to have a separate section for each area when thereâs one or two places to stay.\n\nIf youâre looking for a more local vibe, where itâs more residential and youâre more likely to get caught up in the day-to-day life of a resident of San Francisco, this is the best place to stay.\n\nThe disadvantage is, of course, location, but weâd argue that the location here is still pretty good â albeit a little less convenient for places like North Beach and the Embarcadero â because of the proximity to Golden Gate Park, the Richmond, and the Sunset.\n\nIf youâre looking at a map, when weâre talking about this area, weâre essentially talking about the area between Divisadero Street and Filmore Street â two of the best stretches in the entire city when it comes to food, drinks, and shopping â from the Panhandle at the southern end to California Street at the northern end.\n\nThis area is much more residential, with the beautiful Victorian architecture that has become synonymous with San Francisco thanks to the Painted Ladies in the opening shots of Full House.\n\nHowever, those bustling thoroughfares â Divisadero and Filmore â are where youâll find a lot of great places to eat, drink, and shop.\n\nAdd in a couple of great parks â Alamo Square and Lafayette Park are our favorites â and the proximity to Golden Gate Park, and youâve got yourself an ideal home base for exploring the city.\n\nPros and Cons of Staying in NoPa / Alamo Square / Japantown\n\nHere are the pros and cons of staying in this more residential area as we see them.\n\nPros of Staying in NoPa / Alamo Square / Japantown\n\nThe green spaces. We love a good urban green space, and this area has TONS of them. Between Alamo Square â home of the Painted Ladies â and Lafayette Park (our former local park) â youâve got a couple of great options right outside your front door. Then, a 5-10 walk away is the Panhandle and Golden Gate Park, the best urban park in the country (Matt lived a block away for several years, and it helped him finally enjoy the long walks that Alysha dragged him on every Sunday morning).\n\nThe plethora of food/drink/shopping options on Fillmore and Divisadero. As weâll cover in the highlights section below, there is no shortage of great places to eat, drink, and browse here.\n\nThe proximity to the coast and Golden Gate Bridge. Donât get us wrong â itâs still a journey to get from here to the coast. But it is absolutely a faster, more direct journey than, say, from Union Square, which will take 15-20 minutes longer. And we definitely think a key part of yourSan Francisco itinerary is seeing Ocean Beach, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the stretch of coast in between (which is known as the Lands End Trail).\n\nCons of Staying in NoPa / Alamo Square / Japantown\n\nItâs not as central as the pieces of the downtown core. Itâs going to take longer to get to the Embarcadero, Mission, and North Beach. Basically, the pro of being close to the park and coast is offset by the con of being further from everywhere else.\n\nThere are far fewer places to stay (especially GOOD places to stay). This is a much more residential area, which means fewer hotels and guesthouses to choose from.\n\nAlamo Square / Japantown Highlights\n\nHere are a few places in the neighborhood that we like, and think you will too.\n\nNopalito: One of our favorites, Nopalito is a Mexican restaurant that has plenty of gluten free options and good cocktails. Get the pozole if itâs on the menu (and itâs a little chilly).\n\n4505 Burgers and BBQ: A good barbecue spot right on Divisadero with a nice little outdoor seating area.\n\nB Patisserie: Somewhere in the running for the best bakery in San Francisco (NOT GLUTEN FREE), go early for their best selection of pastries, including the ever-popular Kouign Amann.\n\nRoam Burger: One of our favorite spots when we lived in the city, we would walk to Filmore to eat here (they have gluten free buns, but toast and prepare them in the same spaces so you should ask them not to toast it â fryer is gluten free, last time I checked). Good burgers with fun, creative toppings, and great sweet potato fries.\n\nOaktown Spice Shop: We love this spice shop, but have only been to their locations over in the East Bay in the past. Now they have a location right on Fillmore, which is great! Good place to get hard-to-find spices and things like chiles for homemade salsas.\n\nBrendaâs Meat and Three: A famous southern spot with a location in the Tenderloin with lines around the block, this location on Divisadero Street is much more low key (though still popular) and offers a very similar menu. Beignets are the star of the show here, with a variety of different flavors happening. They also have creative breakfast sandwiches for $5 on weekday mornings, which are a steal of a deal. NOT GLUTEN FREE (but we used to bring visitors here).\n\nThe Best Places to Stay in NoPa / Alamo Square / Japantown\n\nHere are a few places to stay that stand out to us.\n\nThe Grove Inn: A Reasonably Priced Guesthouse on Alamo Square\n\nThe Grove Inn, which is literally a block away from the Painted Ladies, is one of a few hotels here that is worthwhile. Itâs quiet, clean, and central.\n\nYouâll be smack dab in the middle of Hayes Valley, the Fillmore District, and NOPA, which is a great place to be. Rooms are simple and spacious, and there are a variety of configurations and sizes depending on what your group looks like.\n\nSome of the rooms have bay windows, which will bring in more natural light.\n\nOne thing to know here is that they do not have parking, which means youâll be braving the street parking (which has a two hour limit unless you have a residential permit and is very competitive regardless) or parking in a garage nearby.\n\nItâs also not pet-friendly.\n\nHotel Kabuki: A Charming Hotel in Japantown with Nice Amenities\n\nThis charming hotel â which my mom has actually stayed at when she visited us a few years ago â is located right in Japantown, which is a nice part of town to be in because itâs fairly residential, but has connections to other parts of the city thanks to express buses running up and down Geary Blvd.\n\nThey have a range of room options, from the traditional single king or two doubles, to rooms with balconies and city views and a little more space to spread out. All are bright, with nice big windows and clean, modern design elements.\n\nThey have a big gym as far as hotel gyms go, with free weights and Peloton bikes.\n\nHowever, they also charge an amenity fee of $35 a day, so factor that into your budget.\n\nThey welcome dogs under 30 pounds (for a $100 fee), and they have onsite parking in the small outdoor lot next to the hotel for $45 a day, or in a nearby garage for $29 a day (but no in/out privileges).\n\nKimpton Hotel Enso: A Solid Mid-Range Option in Japantown\n\nThis Kimpton location is also right in Japantown, a few blocks from the hotel above, so it shares a lot of the same location benefits.\n\nRooms are fairly basic as far as decor goes, but theyâre spacious and comfortable, with your usual configurations like a single king bed or two queen beds. Some rooms have city views, balconies, or a private patio off of the courtyard.\n\nWe said the design is basic, but we will admit that we were drooling over the green tile they use in their showers (weâre big suckers for colored tile, and are in the planning phase of a bathroom remodel).\n\nIn terms of amenities, they have a fitness center, a big communal courtyard, and a hosted wine hour every afternoon with complimentary refreshments.\n\nWe do like that their pricing is transparent, with no SURPRISE hidden âamenityâ or âresortâ fees tacked on at the last minute â itâs all included in the room rate.\n\nPets are allowed without an extra fee, and self-parking is available onsite for $49 a day.\n\nThe Financial District / Embarcadero: Business Travelers and Waterfront Views\n\nWe have mixed feelings about staying in San Franciscoâs Financial District. On the one hand, itâs a convenient location that will put you within walking distance of a few key landmarks â like the Ferry Building, the Embarcadero, and even Oracle Park (home of the San Francisco Giants).\n\nNot to mention the fact that itâs adjacent to North Beach and Nob Hill, where youâll find great places to eat and drink.\n\nHowever, the main downside is that on the weekends, it is DEAD. Businesses are closed, the streets are eerily deserted, and thereâs just not a whole lot going on. And chances are if youâre a tourist, youâre visiting San Francisco on a weekend.\n\nThe main advantage is absolutely the location â which is good, and offers connections to the rest of the city via the cable car, buses, streetcars, and BART stops in the neighborhood.\n\nPlus, itâs nice to be within a few blocks of the Embarcadero, the waterfront stretch that runs along the San Francisco Bay under the Bay Bridge, and is one of the most beautiful parts of the city.\n\nPros and Cons of Staying in the Financial District (& the Embarcadero)\n\nHere are the pros and cons of staying in FiDi as we see them.\n\nPros of Staying in the Financial District\n\nThe Ferry Building is AWESOME. Despite being a major tourist attraction, this is a place that we would absolutely come to as residents. We would often roll out of bed and make the trip down the hill from our apartment in Nob Hill to the Ferry Building Farmers Market on Saturday mornings. Inside, there are a bunch of local vendors from cheese to ice cream to coffee (and the best gluten free bakery in SF â Mariposa â which is a staple of our gluten free guide to San Francisco), and itâs a fun place to browse.\n\nWalking Distance to Nob Hill, North Beach, and the Embarcadero. And Soma and Oracle Park, where the Giants play. Itâs a nice central location, and youâll be able to walk a lot of places.\n\nGood transit connections. It should come as no surprise that a central business district has really good public transit connections. Youâll have easy access to buses to other parts of the city, BART to get to the Mission (or East Bay or South Bay, if you need), and Cable Cars and Streetcars to get elsewhere.\n\nCons of Staying in the Financial District\n\nItâs DEAD on the weekends (outside of the Embarcadero). Outside of the working hours (and the hours on either end of them), the Financial District is DEAD. Which is not surprising since itâs primarily a place for business, but is something to keep in mind. Youâll find that some places are closed on weekends because the demand just isnât there to justify being open.\n\nItâs about as far as you can be from Golden Gate Park and the Bridge. Which isnât the end of the world, especially if you plan to do them at the same time, but is something to know.\n\nThere are no residents here, so thereâs no âlocal vibeâ to speak of. This may or may not be something you care about, but we generally like to stay in a place where real people actually live so that we can get a brief taste of local life. However, you might also not care and just want a central, convenient place to stay.\n\nThe hotel options lean expensive. Another fact thatâs probably not all that surprising given that this area caters to business travelers, but the hotels here all lean towards the luxury end of the spectrum.\n\nFinancial District (& Embarcadero) Highlights\n\nHere are some places in the Financial District or on the Embarcadero that we enjoy.\n\nThe Ferry Building: We already kind of covered this, but this is a must-do while youâre in San Francisco (especially on Saturday morning when the Farmers Market is happening). A few highlights for us from the permanent vendors: Heath Ceramics (we have plates and mugs from them, which are made right in the Bay Area), Mariposa Baking Company (the best gluten free bakery in the city), Humphry Slocombe for creative ice cream flavors. But there are new vendors every time we come back, so best to walk around and see for yourself!\n\nKokkari: A very nice place for lunch or dinner that serves Greek food. This was on Alyshaâs food bucket list of places to return to one last time that we put together when we left the city behind. Get the Saghanaki â a pan-fried squeaky cheese â and thank us later. Make a reservation because itâs popular.\n\nAsha Tea House: Alyshaâs favorite tea spot in the Financial District.\n\nThe view from Pier 7: This is one of my favorite views in San Francisco. Looking out towards the bay, you have Treasure Island and the Bay Bridge. Looking back towards the city, you have the skyline (including the TransAmerica Pyramid). You can find it here on Google Maps.\n\nThe Best Places to Stay in the Financial District\n\nHere are a few places to stay in the Financial District that stood out to us.\n\nThe first two options are on the Embarcadero, next to the Ferry Building, where youâll be right along the water (which weâre into).\n\n1 Hotel San Francisco: A Luxury Hotel Option on the Embarcadero\n\nLocated right on the water,this luxury hotel is probably our top pick in this area, though it is a bit of a splurge (even by San Francisco standards).\n\nThe rooms are all bright and full of light, and are relatively big as far as hotel rooms go.\n\nThere are a lot of choices here, ranging from a traditional king room to a two queen room, with some rooms facing the city side and some facing the water side of the hotel (the latter comes with an extra charge, as you might have guessed).\n\nThey also have some less traditional room types, like their suites with more seating area, and their suites with a private terrace that has a view of the Ferry Building.\n\nThe one thing we donât like is that they charge a $45 a day amenity fee, which covers things like access to the gym, the use of free bikes and a courtesy shuttle, andâ¦filtered water?\n\nWeâd love for them to just include it in the room price instead of doing this bait-and-switch, but itâs something you should know going in so you can add it to the budget.\n\nPets are allowed (with no added fee!). Parking is valet only and costs $75 a day (with in and out privileges).\n\nHarbor Court Hotel: A More Affordable Waterfront Option\n\nIf youâre looking for a slightly more affordable stay right on the Embarcadero,this charming mid-range hotel just down the street is a good option.\n\nItâs not as pretty as the other two options in the neighborhood, but the prices reflect that (remember the context that itâs still San Franciscoâs Financial District). And the location is equally good!\n\nRooms here are significantly more compact than other hotels in the area, but they have everything you need for a comfortable few nights.\n\nOne thing to know is that they donât have rooms with two beds, so if you arenât comfortable sleeping in the same bed as your travel companion OR youâre traveling with a small group and need space for three or four people, this probably isnât the place for you.\n\nThey do charge an amenity fee of $34.35 (plus tax) that covers access to their gym and use of the hotelâs bikes, continental breakfast, and light refreshments during their afternoon wine hour.\n\nThey have onsite valet parking for $70 a night (with in and out privileges), and allow pets (with a $100 fee per stay).\n\nThe Jay, Autograph Collection: A Brand New Boutique Hotel with Huge Rooms\n\nAt first, we took a surface level look at this boutique hotel in the heart of the Financial District and said something like âlooks nice, but the prices seem highâ (which is something we said about every hotel here, to be fair).\n\nHowever, after our second pass at choosing hotels for this guide, we realized that the rooms here are HUGE, which at least partially explains the price. Weâre talking over 400 square feet, which is roughly double the average hotel room size (more than double for some of the more modern hotels on this list).\n\nThe rooms â did we mention that theyâre huge? â come in a variety of configurations with one or two beds, and no view, a skyline view, or a view out over the Bay.\n\nThey also have suites, which are slightly bigger and closer to a one bedroom apartment (without a full kitchen, though).\n\nYes, prices are high, but one thing we are impressed by is the fact that thereâs no âresortâ or amenity fee that gets added on sneakily at the end (and you still have access to amenities like a gym).\n\nPets are welcome, though it costs $125 per pet per stay, which comes with a nice little welcome basket with a dish, treats, and bed.\n\nThey do have valet parking available, but itâs a whopping $82 a night. Best to stay elsewhere (or park at a nearby garage) if youâre coming with a car (which we wouldnât recommend anyway).\n\nWhere NOT to Stay in San Francisco\n\nWhile the neighborhoods above are the places we would recommend staying, we also wanted to cover a few neighborhoods that weâd avoid for one reason or another.\n\nFishermanâs Wharf: Fishermanâs Wharf is sort of like Union Square in the sense that itâs a neighborhood thatâs basically geared entirely to tourists (we can count on one hand the number of times we went to Fishermanâs Wharf when we lived in SF), but it has one important difference: itâs a FAR less convenient location. Which is why we wouldnât stay here. Visit (maybe) for part of a day, get chowder in a sourdough bread bowl, check out the sea lions, go out to Alcatraz, and call it a day (and stay elsewhere).\n\nThe Tenderloin (and Civic Center): The Tenderloin is the one neighborhood in San Francisco that we avoid if possible, though it is worth noting that I (Matt, which is important) walked along the edge of the Tenderloin for several years to and from work and never really felt unsafe (but Iâm also a white man of above average height whoâs used to being in cities, which definitely plays a part). Aside from the fact that thereâs really no good hotels in the Tenderloin, it just wouldnât be a comfortable place to stay for a wide variety of reasons.\n\nThe Mission District: Look, we love the Mission, and would spend as much time as you can afford exploring it when youâre in town. Itâs probably the single best food and drink neighborhood in SF, and thereâs plenty to do and see (and eat and drink) to fill the better part of a day on your visit. However, itâs not a good place to stay because thereâsâ¦nowhere to stay. Itâs very residential, and itâs perhaps the most heavily gentrified area in San Francisco. Visit (often), but stay elsewhere.\n\nThe Castro: We love the Castro â it has some great parks, places to eat and drink, and going to a Moana singalong with friends at the Castro Theater is among my (Matt again!) favorite experiences of my time in San Francisco. However, once again, itâs very residential, and there are exactly two hotels or guesthouses that I know of in the neighborhood.\n\nThe Richmond or Sunset: Too far. Thatâs the single reason why we wouldnât recommend staying in either the Richmond or Sunset, which straddle Golden Gate Park on its northern and southern edges. We both lived in the Richmond at separate times, and joke that it actually takes longer to go from the Richmond to the Financial District than from our apartment in Nob Hill to Oakland. Both are lovely places to explore â particularly the Inner Richmond along Clement Street and Geary Blvd â but not a good place to stay."
