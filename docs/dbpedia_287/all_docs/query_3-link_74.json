        "text": "Diamond City, also referred to as the \"Great Green Jewel,\" is a fortified settlement in the Fens neighborhood of Boston in Fallout 4.[1] It was built within Fenway Park, a pre-War baseball stadium.[RPG 1]\n\nBackground[]\n\nPre-War[]\n\nBefore the Great War, Fenway Park was Boston's baseball stadium, which hosted the Swatting Sultans. On the afternoon of October 23, 2077, Fenway Park would have hosted the seventh game of the 2077 World Series, featuring the Swatting Sultans against a rival team from Texas. If the Sultans won, they would have obtained the first World Series win for Boston since 1918.[2] However, this never came to pass, as the Great War struck on the morning of October 23. Boston's star pitcher Matt Murtagh and two of his teammates, Nathan Broadhurst and Jim Walker, had been warming up in Fenway Park when the war struck, and the stadium's high walls spared them from the initial nuclear devastation.[3]\n\nPost-War settlement[]\n\nIn 2130,[4] the settlement Diamond City was founded within Fenway Park. Its distinctive green color is visible on the tall, reinforced wall, earning the left-field wall nickname the \"Green Monster.\"[5]\n\nWith its own police force, public school, robust agriculture and industry, and a great deal of economic influence across the region, it is by far the most prosperous settlement in the Commonwealth. Diamond City Radio, which can be heard across the Commonwealth, is a symbol of its prosperity and might.[5] Despite this, it is still a shantytown contained within a baseball stadium, showing humanity's struggle for survival in 2287 and the difficulties involved with trying to reclaim the Boston area. As such, Diamond City also doubles as a shelter during the reclamation of Boston.\n\nWith the years of pre-War baseball long past, Diamond City was founded in the stadium's stead.[5] The settlement established itself as a safe haven for settlers of the Commonwealth, thanks to what its residents affectionately referred to as \"the Wall.\" Later decades saw Diamond City grow into the Commonwealth's largest and most prosperous community.[6] It developed a degree of social stratification, as wealthier residents came to occupy properties in the settlement's exclusive Upper Stands neighborhood, built in the elevated stadium seating. These overlooked the Lower Fields (the baseball field itself,) where those with less means took up residence.[7][RPG 1]\n\nThe stadium and its residents have experienced several significant events since the War. In 2180, the Commonwealth Minutemen defended the city from an attacking horde of super mutants, causing the militia's rise to prominence.[8] The Broken Mask incident that occurred fifty years later, in 2229, had a far more lasting impact. A visitor named Mr. Carter suddenly opened fire at a centrally located Diamond City bar, killing several citizens. After Diamond City security took him down, an examination of his remains revealed that he was a synth.[9] This single incident planted seeds of fear that eventually blossomed into full-scale paranoia about the Institute and its abductions.[10] Since the event, the fear has only escalated due to regular and unexplained disappearances that have persisted for over half a century.[11]\n\nThe city continued to grow despite these troubles, affecting the Commonwealth in many ways. One of its more dubious contributions is Goodneighbor, a settlement founded in 2240 by a group of criminals banished from the city, who quickly turned the new town into a haven for activities frowned upon in Diamond City.[12] In 2272, a new restaurant named Power Noodles was established in the city market, with a Protectron known as Takahashi at the helm. The restaurant rapidly became a staple of Diamond City culture. Piper Wright and her sister Nat also immigrated to the city to found Publick Occurrences, a newspaper dedicated to changing the city for the better. Her activism has galvanized support for fixing the city's problems, such as corruption among the Diamond City security officers, poorly maintained infrastructure, and lack of maintenance on the Wall separating the city from the wasteland.[13][14]\n\nDiamond City fell prey to a surge of anti-ghoul sentiment, fanned by mayoral candidate McDonough and his anti-ghoul Mankind for McDonough platform. He won the election thanks to the votes of the upper stands citizens, and issued the anti-ghoul decree of 2282 in his inaugural speech. The resulting pogrom was carried out by people the ghouls once called their neighbors, and saw entire families thrown out of the city into the surrounding ruins to perish. The ghouls' abandoned belongings were confiscated by the remaining humans, pacifying the poorer residents of the field.[15]\n\nIn 2286, nearly five years later, Pastor Clements lost control over the All Faiths Chapel when it was occupied by the Children of Atom, who opposed the exile of the ghouls. During their brief time in the city, the cult were well-liked among the people of the Lower Fields for their vocal criticism of the Upper Stands residents. They were also supported for opposing the authority of the Minutemen, who were active in the city at this time.[RPG 2] The cult ultimately attacked Diamond City under the leadership of the Last Son of Atom and were subsequently driven out of Boston.\n\nIn 2287, McDonough remains in power, posing as the city's defender while secretly ensuring the city does not interfere with the Institute's plans. As an infiltrator, he is very capable in his role, although his cover is starting to fray at the edges.[16] Some residents have come to believe McDonough has been replaced by a synth, a suspicion spread by Piper and Nat as part of their investigative journalism.\n\nSociety[]\n\nDiamond City is divided between people living on the former baseball field, now known as the Lower Fields, and those residing above in the stadium seating stands, now known as the Upper Stands. The former comprise the city's laborers, craftsmen, farmers, and other workers, while the latter are caravan owners, merchants, and other individuals who control the lion's share of the city's wealth. McDonough exploited this divide and favored the city's elite, who may have wanted the ghouls gone merely to improve their view.[15]\n\nDiamond City is the only settlement in the Commonwealth that guarantees a free education to all children, regardless of their social or financial status.[17] It also hosts a non-denominational chapel open to all religious adherents, giving them a quiet, safe space to pray and worship. Power is provided by a fusion generator tower in the heart of the city's market, giving its denizens access to cheap electricity.[Non-game 1] The irony of nuclear power first destroying the world and then giving Diamond City its main advantage is not lost on the more scientifically-inclined members of the community.[18]\n\nFood is provided to the city by independent farms across the Commonwealth, such as Abernathy farm. However, a much larger supplier is the Codman family, who own both the orchard within the walls and the Codman family farms, which provide brahmin meat to Choice Chops.[19][20]\n\nThe community of Diamond City tolerates synths living within as long as they serve the community, allowing Nick Valentine to even run his own public detective agency. Nick gained entry to Diamond City by saving the daughter of the city's former mayor, Henry Roberts, when she eloped with a caravan hand (who turned out to be part of a gang of kidnappers). Over time, Nick was able to cultivate a level of respect amongst the populace, as he never hid his identity as a synth (and with his face and body couldn't have anyway), and worked several odd jobs to prove his worth to the community until he started his detective agency.[21] Despite this, some other residents are shown to be scornful of synths, not wishing to affiliate with them. Myrna of Diamond City Surplus is particularly paranoid, openly questioning all visitors to her store, voicing conspiracy theories about synths and their behavior, and even planning to start a full anti-synth movement.[22]\n\nLayout[]\n\nDiamond City is split into social classes, with the rich and powerful residing in the Upper Stands, and the common people, both housed and unhoused, living in the Lower Fields below. The center of the city is the market, which is approached by the main entrance stairs from the southwest. Surrounding the market are four main streets laid out along the old baselines: First Street to the south, Second Street to the east, Third Street to the north, and Home Street to the west. The poorest residents sleep under shelters in the area north of Third Street, where they tend a small number of crops (consisting of mutfruit and tato plants). The northern section of the city beyond these shelters features an outdoor auditorium, a brahmin pen, and a much larger crop field. There is also a small irradiated lake to the east of Second Street, where the city's water is purified and sold by Sheng Kawolski.\n\nFood can be harvested from the small and large crop fields or the greenhouse, or bought from vendors. Purified water can only be obtained from vendors. All standard crafting stations are available for use in the market. A bed may be rented at the Dugout Inn, or permanently obtained by gaining access to either Home Plate or Kellogg's house.\n\nBuildings[]\n\nUnmarked locations are in italic type.\n\nInhabitants[]\n\nCompanions\n\nNick Valentine\n\nPiper Wright\n\nResidents\n\nAnimals\n\n2 brahmin\n\n27 house cats\n\nToro\n\nGeneric\n\n20 Diamond City security officers\n\n18 unnamed residents²\n\n2 Eyebots\n\n1 Police Protectron (inactive)\n\nFormer residents\n\n¹ Replaces an unnamed resident while present\n\n² Two residents will be replaced by faction members after completion of the main questline\n\nNotable loot[]\n\nNine Nuka-Cola Quantums are found throughout the city:\n\nTwo are in Kellogg's house, in the hidden room.\n\nTwo are in the Cooke residence, on the tables on the second floor.\n\nTwo are around Power Noodles, on the counters.\n\nOne is in the Dugout Inn, on the shelves behind the bar.\n\nOne is in Polly's house at Choice Chops, on an end table opposite the entrance.\n\nOne is outside Sheng Kawolski's house, on the metal shelves to the left of the entrance.\n\nEight Nuka-Cherrys are found throughout the city:\n\nThree are in Kellogg's house, in the hidden room.\n\nThree are in the Dugout Inn, with two on the shelves behind the bar, and the third under the bar.\n\nOne is in Myrna's house at Diamond City Surplus, on a table near the first-floor entrance.\n\nOne is in Doc Crocker's house, on the wooden shelves to the left of the first-floor entrance.\n\nThree Join the Railroad holotapes are found throughout the city:\n\nOne is in Abbot's house, on the metal shelves opposite the entrance.\n\nOne is in the Dugout Inn, on a nightstand in the bedroom opposite the kitchen.\n\nOne is in Fallon's Basement, on the dresser on the upper platform.\n\nGwinnett ale brewing subroutines holotape - In the Colonial Taphouse, on a shelf under the bar.\n\nRobCo Fun with the Zeta Invaders mini-game holotape - In Valentine Detective Agency, on the desk in the back.\n\nLive & Love issue #9 - In the schoolhouse, near the beds on the first floor.\n\nMini nuke - In Arturo's house at Commonwealth Weaponry, on a table opposite the bed on the first floor.\n\nBig Boy, a unique Fat Man - Sold by Arturo Rodriguez.\n\nOld Faithful, a unique laser pistol - Sold by Arturo Rodriguez.\n\nProtector's armor - Sold by Arturo Rodriguez.\n\nRockville Slugger - Sold by Moe Cronin.\n\nChampion chest piece and right arm - Sold by Becky Fallon.\n\nHazmat suit - Often sold by Becky Fallon.\n\nWastelander's chest piece - Sold by Myrna or Percy.\n\nGeneva's ensemble - Worn by Geneva.\n\nRed leather trench coat and press cap - Both worn by Piper Wright.\n\nNotes[]\n\nThe first time one enters Diamond City, Mayor McDonough will give a speech to a small group of residents where he proclaims \"I am NOT a synth,\" and then praises the Wall.\n\nAfter the Sole Survivor finishes the quest Jewel of the Commonwealth, the front gate remains raised. By using a jet pack (or console commands if on PC), one can reach the platform with the crane arms above. There, one can interact with either crane, which will instantly reset the gate to its original position and then slowly raise it again.\n\nIf the Sole Survivor completes the main quest line for a major faction, all the flags in the city will be replaced with the faction's flag, and members of that faction will be wandering the city.\n\nIf the Institute ending is chosen, Gen 1 synths will be found in the market. If the Sole Survivor communicates with them, they state they're in the city to spread the presence of the Institute. Diamond City security will explain that the synths suddenly appeared, but as they weren't causing any trouble, they were allowed to stay. Some synths will be crafting weapons or armor, while others may be browsing the stores in the market. Myrna, who previously seemed to have an aversion to synths, allows them to browse her store, and will no longer comment about hating synths.\n\nOn the in-game dates of Halloween and Christmas, the market is decorated appropriately for the corresponding holiday. On Halloween, the decorations include banners, plastic pumpkins, and paper cutouts of cats, skeletons, and pumpkin men. The Christmas decorations consist of strings of colorful lights and Christmas trees. Furthermore, the Christmas decorations will be displayed from Christmas day through New Year's Eve. However, in order for these decorations to appear, the Sole Survivor must visit Diamond City at least once on Christmas Day; otherwise, the decorations will not appear on any of the subsequent days.\n\nFour baseball bases around the city are labeled with tally marks as home plate, first base, second base, and third base; Diamond City security will occasionally encourage the Sole Survivor to run the bases, hinting that doing so would be worthwhile. Starting and ending at home plate, running over each of the bases in order will grant the Homerun! trophy/achievement. Also, the city's street names are named after their respective bases, including Home Street.\n\nThere are two wanted posters in the city: one is next to Swatters, and another is just inside the Dugout Inn. Upon reading the posted notices, both assign the same radiant quest tasking the Sole Survivor with killing a raider, ghoul, or super mutant marked on the map at a randomly selected location. Although the notice indicates there is no reward except what is looted from the targets' corpses, some quest completion XP will be granted upon killing the marked enemy. A new bounty will appear on the posters as soon as the current one is complete.\n\nThere is a hidden diner just outside Diamond City; see that location page for details on how to access the area and its contents. Heading west from the diner along the edge of the Diamond City roof leads to the upper section of the entrance gate (near a rubble-filled area with a skeleton, two ammo boxes, and a first aid box). From there, careful jumping or use of a jet pack provides access to one of the large yellow beams holding the main gate in place, which may be activated to close the gate. The gate will not immediately close; the player character will need to first enter an interior cell for the gate to properly close. Once closed, the player character can open the gate from the ground by simply activating it.\n\nClimbing the partially destroyed building outside the northwest corner of Diamond City and using a jet pack to reach the city roof affords access to a duffle bag and an explosives box to the south. Other minor loot is found on the east side of the city roof accessible by jet pack, including a large toolbox near a skeleton, a cooler, and two stimpaks and a dose of Addictol on a crate.\n\nDespite ghouls being banned from Diamond City, if Hancock or Billy Peabody, an intelligent child ghoul found during the quest Kid in a Fridge, is taken to the city, they will be allowed inside. Edward Deegan may also be encountered inside the Dugout Inn to initiate the quest Special Delivery.\n\nSometimes while waiting in the market, an Assaultron may spawn. While not hostile to the player character, it will attack other characters in the city. It may spawn as a glitch after hacking a robot with the Robotics Expert perk and not shutting it down or destroying it.\n\nIn the Boston Bugle building, a newspaper article on a terminal indicates that on October 23, 2077, the day of the Great War, the team was to play Game 7 of the World Series. The article optimistically predicts that after decades of failure, the team would finally win.\n\nIf one uses a mod to make their power armor jet pack have considerably eased height limits and Action Point drainup, they can surpass the invisible barriers positioned on top of the stadium and explore the surrounding area. The map is crudely textured and non-solid, and reaching a certain distance from Diamond City will transport the player to a pitch black screen where they can only interact with the pause menu.\n\n[]\n\nWhen at this location, companions make comments.\n\nLocation comments Character Comment Cait \"If we're looking for some action, I'm bettin' we'll find it here.\" Codsworth \"So this is the famous Diamond City. I suppose I hoped to find more of a gem than a dusty home base. Civilization \"in the rough\" if you will!\" Curie \"Are we going to see this baseball game? How exciting!\" Danse \"It's a shame these people have to live in fear, sheltering in this old stadium when all those perfectly good buildings are still standing outside.\" Deacon \"Diamond City. Watch what you say. If the Institute chose one place to infiltrate - we're walking right into it.\" Hancock \"Diamond City, huh? You know they ain't real fond of Ghouls in this town.\" Nick Valentine \"Even good people do crazy things when they're scared. Ought to be Diamond City's motto.\" Piper \"It's big, loud, full of corrupt officials and brown-nosing citizens. But it's home.\" Preston Garvey \"Mayor McDonough has always been against the Minutemen. I never quite understood why.\" (entrance) \"Things are looking up around here now that McDonough's gone.\" (entrance after killing McDonough) MacCready \"Haven't been to Diamond City in years, but I'll tell you... nothing's changed.\" Strong \"Stinks like humans here.\" X6-88 \"Good place to stock up on supplies, if you can stand the smell.\"\n\nAppearances[]\n\nDiamond City appears in Fallout 4, Fallout Shelter Online, and Winter of Atom. It is mentioned in Zoe's diary in the Automatron add-on[23] and by Lizzie Wyath in the Nuka-World add-on.[24] It is also mentioned in a question in the Fallout Shelter weekly quest Game Show Gauntlet.\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nDiamond City is modeled on the real-world Fenway Park. For example, the Wall is based on the real-world location of \"the Wall\" or the \"Green Monster,\" popular nicknames for the 37-foot (11.33-meter) left-field wall at Fenway Park. In the real-world Fenway Park, there is also a large Coca-Cola sign approximately in the same location and style as the Nuka-Cola sign in the game. Likewise, the Mass Fusion billboard mounted on a building behind the Wall mirrors the placement of a large real-world advertisement for the Citgo gasoline company made of neon lights. The real sign was rigged so that it could light up the letters C, IT, and GO in sequence (\"See it go\") when a home run was hit. Finally, there is a single red seat in the northeast bleachers near the GNN sign, representing the \"Lone Red Seat\" where Ted Williams hit the farthest ball in Fenway Park history in 1946, 502 feet from home plate.\n\nQuest designers who contributed to the writing of Diamond City as a whole included William Shen, Liam Collins and Emil Pagliarulo, who also worked on the Diamond City companions Piper Wright and Nick Valentine.[Non-game 2]\n\nArtist Nathan Purkeypile designed much of Diamond City's layout, lighting, and cluttering.[Non-game 3][Non-game 4] It was the first location he worked on for the game, as the developers knew from the beginning that they wanted iconic stadium lights, and that the main quest would point towards the stadium as a \"beacon\" or landmark that could help the player navigate the Boston area.[Non-game 5]\n\nPurkeypile also implemented the seasonal decorations seen in Diamond City, a feature he had in mind since the first designs for Diamond City were created in 2011.[Non-game 6]\n\nAtop the press box serving as the mayor's office above the main entrance are five red flags reading \"World Series Champions\" with the years 1903, 1912, 1915, 1916, and 1918. Banners displaying these years also hang from the stands at intervals on the south and west sides of the stadium. In the Fallout universe, the team never won the World Series again after 1918, and the Curse of the Bambino was never broken. In the real world, the Red Sox finally won the World Series after an 86-year drought in 2004.\n\nThe team's retired numbers in the game, as seen on the bleachers below the Nuka-Cola sign, were 1, 4, 6, 11, 13, 21, and 33. The first three of those numbers are equal to retired numbers of the Boston Red Sox, and belong to Bobby Doerr, Joe Cronin and Johnny Pesky, respectively. Diamond City resident Moe Cronin also shares his last name with Joe Cronin.\n\nAt one point in development, Diamond City was intended to have an additional business, \"Safe at Home Hotel and Bar\". The business appears on an early placeholder texture for the city's signs, and proper texture for the business's signage can be found in the game's texture archives.\n\nAmong the game's texture files for Diamond City is a cropped image of the real-world Fenway Park and its surroundings from a satellite mapping service, labelled as \"TestLayout01\". This image is likely a leftover from very early development, when the layout of Diamond City was still being determined.\n\nThe cell for Diamond City still exists in the files of Fallout 76, but it is empty.\n\nBugs[]\n\nPC Xbox One Sometimes, when using the exterior lift from the mayor's office, then activating the second button before the elevator reaches the bottom, the guard rail will extend as if the player were to disembark, then retract upon arrival as if the player is still riding the elevator. Activating the elevator and leaving Diamond City, or entering a building before the elevator stops moving and reloading the game, may fix this. [verified]\n\nPC Sometimes, when using the elevator to the mayor's office with a companion, the companion may be transported to the green trash can at the base of the main entrance stairs in Diamond City, and become stuck there. Walking outside of Diamond City to the Fens (manually, without fast-travel) will sometimes free the companion in this situation. Using the console command moveto.player after selecting the companion's refID can also rectify this issue. [verified]\n\nPC Playstation 4 Any items placed in the mailboxes, including the one in front of the Sole Survivor's Home Plate residence, will be displayed as owned. Stealing will then be the only way to access the items. [verified]\n\nPlaystation 4 Xbox One After completing the quest Unlikely Valentine, two Triggermen may spawn in Diamond City each time you travel to the city. Most of the civilians in Diamond City will attack the mobsters. There is currently no fix for this issue.

Too many good folks not willing to get their hands dirty and too many assholes taking advantage of it. Look at what happened to Diamond City. Before McDonough took over, it was a half-decent place to live. A little stricter than I usually go for, but not terrible. I thought he and I had a pretty happy childhood. But then he decides he's gonna try and get elected with his anti-Ghoul crusade - \"Mankind for McDonough.\" Before ya know it, you got families with kids lining up to drag folks they called \"neighbor\" out of their homes and throw 'em to the ruins.\"\n\nThe Sole Survivor: \"How could they do something like that?\"\n\nJohn Hancock: \"There'd always been a pretty big gulf between the folks living in the stands and folks down on the field. McDonough ran on it because he thought enough of those Upper Stands assholes would vote for him. Guess he was right.\"\n\nThe Sole Survivor: \"It could have gone worse. At least they left with their lives.\"\n\nJohn Hancock: \"And how long do you think those folks lasted in the ruins? The city condemned those Ghouls to die. Cowards just got someone else to pull the trigger. I remember storming into his office above the stands after the inauguration speech. He was just standing there, staring out the window, watching as the city turned on the Ghouls. He didn't even look at me, just said: \"I did it, John. It's finally mine.\" Should have killed him right there, but I don't think it would have changed anything. Instead I pleaded with him, begged him to call it off. He said he couldn't. He had nothing against the Ghouls. He was just carrying out the will of the people. And he couldn't betray the voters. And then he smiled. That hideous, fucking mile-long smile. He never smiled like that when we were kids. I didn't even recognize him.\"\n\n(Hancock's dialogue)\n\n↑ McDonough: \"Welcome, welcome. Good to see you again.

There's a farm out there run entirely by Ghouls, if you can believe it. They might be a problem in the future. I ran on a campaign of strict \"No Ghouls Allowed\" politics. When you build up a scapegoat, you need them to remain distant and scary. But Ghoul settlements breed Ghoul sympathizers. Let our mutual friends know we might need to... give them a reason to be less friendly... The full details are in my report, along with some other points of interest. Here it is.

Located in the remains of Boston’s revered baseball stadium, the city houses several businesses and scores of people in divergent social classes. Every resident shares a common bond; they survived under the shadow of the great green wall—that monument to the ingenuity of humankind and their consummate protector.\n\n[01] All Faiths Chapel\n\nA multidenominational church open 24 hours a day, run by the friendly Pastor Clements. Sit on a pew in the church to gain benefits of the Quiet Reflection perk.\n\n[02] Publick Occurrences\n\nThis location is named after the newspaper, which is written, edited, and published by Piper. Her little sister Nat sells copies at the front of their office. She also publishes stories, such as “The Synthetic Truth,” and is currently on the outs with the mayor. Inside the office, you can read her terminal notes and steal some chems and ammo.\n\n[04] Fallon’s Basement\n\nThis premiere (and only) clothing store sells a variety of prewar attire at the best prices, as well as helpful outfits, like hazmat suits. The proprietor Becky Fallon tells everyone she’s a direct descendant of the original Fallon family. Aside from a large supply of cram, the only item of note is a Holotape you can listen to regarding the Railroad.\n\n[05] Power Noodles\n\nThis noodle bar was built up against the fusion generator tower in the center of the settlement, where the pitcher’s mound was. The Protectron chef, Takahashi, has a single phrase—“Nan-ni shimasho-ka?” or “What would you like to have?”—and a single item to trade. Noodles, naturally.\n\n[10] Swatters\n\n“A swatter never runs out of bullets!” as Moe Cronin is fond of saying. He runs this store specializing in baseball equipment and almost nothing else. Barter with Moe to obtain a unique bat, and speak to him for a couple of quests that can net you some Caps.\n\n[13] Chem-I-Care\n\nThis is a popular establishment, thanks to the genial owner, Solomon. Selling a complete variety of chems and healing supplies, Solomon may have convinced the populace that the benefits of his wares outweigh the risks. Pick the lock of his house (Novice) for a few more chems to steal inside.\n\n[14] Mega Surgery\n\nDespite the corrugated roof, this is a state-of-the-art medical facility offering healing, cybernetic grafts, and even facial reconstruction. Fancy a change in appearance? Sit down under Doctor Sun’s scalpel! There are some other goings on here too; check the listed side quest before descending into the surgery cellar (Advanced).\n\n[15] Choice Chops\n\nFresh Brahmin meat is available from the sullen butcher, Polly (who’s a frustrated poet), or Mole Rat meat if you’re feeling adventurous. You can break into Polly’s house (Novice) if you want to hack her terminal (Novice).\n\n[18] The Wall\n\nThe great green wall has protected Diamond City for as long as anyone can remember. Only Abbot spends time here keeping the stage from falling into disrepair, the Brahmins fed, and the wall painted.\n\n[22] Science! Center\n\nThe foremost center of scientific experimentation and discovery in Diamond City, run by the enthusiastic Doctor Duff. Her colleague is a little tired of Duff’s prattling. Take a quiz with Duff if you want. Snoop on Scara’s terminal (Master) if you can.\n\n[27] Dugout Inn\n\nThis is the primary watering hole of Diamond City. Many of the residents go here in the evenings to grab a drink. Occasionally, the place has guests who are traveling through the Commonwealth, as there are rooms available (and mattresses to sleep on) for 100 Caps. Though the Russian twins who run this place are identical in their features, their personalities are completely different.\n\n[30] Colonial Taphouse\n\nThe snobbish denizens of the upper area sip their alcohol from this establishment. Receive a dressing down from Wellington in the exterior seating area, then head inside for a pint and a punch if you’re not careful. Look for the Holotape and a floor safe (Advanced) behind the bar.\n\n[32] Codman Residence\n\nBreak in through the door (Advanced) to the home of the oldest family in Diamond City.
