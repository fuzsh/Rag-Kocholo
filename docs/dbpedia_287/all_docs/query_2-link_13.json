        "text": "Public walkway that follows the edge Boston Harbor\n\nBoston HarborwalkLength47 mi (76 km)LocationBoston, MassachusettsEstablished1984TrailheadsNumerous access pointsUseWalking, bicycling, inline skatingDifficultyEasySeasonYear roundSightsBoston HarborHazardsFollows edges of piers, some stairs; portions of proposed route are incompleteWebsitewww .bostonharborwalk .org\n\nBoston Harborwalk is a public walkway that follows the edge of piers, wharves, beaches, and shoreline around Boston Harbor. When fully completed it will extend a distance of 47 miles (76 km) from East Boston to the Neponset River.[1]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Harborwalk is a cooperative project of the City of Boston,[2] the Boston Planning and Development Agency,[3] the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection,[4] The Boston Harbor Association,[1] and private property developers. Since 1984, the project has established parks, walking paths, educational sites, transportation facilities, and other amenities along the harbor. Many developers of private land along the harbor have been required under the provisions of the Boston Zoning Code[2] and of Chapter 91 of Massachusetts state law[5] to set back new buildings from the water and to provide publicly accessible waterfront pathways.[6]\n\nA map of the proposed route[7] shows that the completed Harborwalk will consist of a continuous trail from Charlestown in the north to Dorchester in the south, plus many other discontinuous trail segments. A map[8] and trail guide[9] describe the current status of the route. An interactive map[10] highlights sights along a portion of the walk in downtown Boston. As of 2016, 38 of the originally planned 47 miles (76 km) of trail have been completed.[6] Following the September 11 attacks, plans to extend the Harborwalk to the four miles of shoreline around Logan Airport were abandoned.[11] As an alternative, planners are now considering an inland route connecting the Harborwalk through the East Boston Greenway to Constitution Beach.\n\nConnections to other trails\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Harborwalk connects with many other trails. From north to south, these include the following:\n\nEast Coast Greenway\n\nEast Boston Greenway\n\nFreedom Trail\n\nCharles River Bike Paths\n\nMillers River Trail\n\nSomerville Community Path extension\n\nRose Kennedy Greenway\n\nWalk to the Sea[12]\n\nSouth Bay Harbor Trail\n\nLower Neponset River Trail\n\nQuincy RiverWalk[13] to Squantum Point Park\n\nPublic art\n\n[edit]\n\nSculptures and memorials, including some by noted artists, have been placed at many locations along the Harborwalk. Playful fish sculpture benches by Judy Kensley McKie and sculptures by Susumu Shingu and David Phillips have been created for Eastport Park, South Boston.[14] Sculptures by Tony Smith, Willem de Kooning, Luis Jimenez, Dennis Oppenheim, William G. Tucker, and Sol LeWitt are located on the University of Massachusetts Boston campus.[15] Between the Institute of Contemporary Art and the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse, a series of artworks by Ross Miller evoke moments in the history of Fan Pier.[16] \"Untitled Landscape\"[17] by David von Schlegell is located at Harbor Towers.\n\nThe East Boston part of the walk travels through an outdoor sculpture park, HarborArts, situated in a working industrial shipyard, the East Boston Shipyard and Marina.[18]\n\nAn interactive musical sculpture, \"Charlestown Bells,\"[19] by Paul Matisse (grandson of the painter Henri Matisse) is located along the walkway of the Charles River Dam. The bells were installed in 2000, but had fallen into disrepair before a 2013 restoration.[20]\n\nMemorial sculptures found along the Harborwalk include a memorial to firefighter Robert M. Greene at Castle Island in South Boston;[21] a Korean War Memorial at Shipyard Park in the Boston Navy Yard in Charlestown;[22][23] and a United States Maritime Service memorial in the North End's Langone Park.[24]\n\nHistorical exhibitions\n\n[edit]\n\nAlong the Harborwalk are several indoor and outdoor displays of historical materials, some of which are available for view 24 hours a day. A selection from the archive of Norman B. Leventhal's collection of Maps of Boston Harbor and Massachusetts Bay[25] is located in the lobby of the Boston Harbor Hotel.[26] In the lobby of Building 114 at the Boston Navy Yard is an exhibition of boat models, photographs and boat building tools.[27] The Maritime Museum at Battery Wharf[28] was built by the developers of the Battery Wharf Hotel[29] as \"mitigation\" under the state's Chapter 91 law,[5] to compensate the public for private use of waterfront land.\n\nNotable attractions\n\n[edit]\n\nPiers Park\n\nPiers Park III (under development)[30] [31]\n\nInstitute of Contemporary Art Watershed annex[32]\n\nEast Boston Shipyard/HarborArts[18]\n\nLogan Airport\n\nLogan Airport Boat Dock[33]\n\nConstitution Beach\n\nNorth of the Charles River\n\n[edit]\n\nCharlestown\n\nSpaulding Rehabilitation Hospital\n\nThe Bunker Hill Monument\n\nBoston Navy Yard, home of the USS Constitution, the USS Constitution Museum, and the USS Cassin Young\n\nPaul Revere Park\n\nThe Zakim Bridge, the Charlestown Bridge, and the Charles River Dam\n\nTD Garden and North Station\n\nNorth End\n\nCopp's Hill\n\nCoast Guard Base Boston\n\nChristopher Columbus Waterfront Park[34]\n\nFaneuil Hall and Quincy Market\n\nNew England Aquarium\n\nHistoric wharves, including Union Wharf, Lewis Wharf, Long Wharf, Central Wharf, India Wharf, Rowes Wharf, and Russia Wharf\n\nCustom House Tower and the Custom House District\n\nFerry service to Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area\n\nHarbor Towers\n\nSouth Station\n\nSite of the Boston Tea Party\n\nNorthern Avenue Bridge\n\nFort Point Channel and Fort Point, including the Fort Point Pier[35] kayak launch site\n\nMoakley Courthouse on the Fan Pier[36]\n\nBoston Children's Museum\n\nMartin's Park\n\nInstitute of Contemporary Art\n\nBoston Fish Pier\n\nLeader Bank Pavilion\n\nHarpoon Brewery (Tours [37])\n\nInnovation and Design Building [38]\n\nCastle Island\n\nCarson Beach\n\nUniversity of Massachusetts Boston\n\nEdward M.

MBTA Boat services stop at the Navy Yard in Charlestown, at Logan Airport in East Boston, and at Long Wharf and Rowes Wharf downtown.\n\nFuture development\n\n[edit]\n\nNew segments continue to be added to the walk as development occurs along the edge of the harbor. A 2012 report prepared for The Boston Harbor Association concluded that approximately 60% of the total possible length of the Harborwalk has been completed.[41]\n\nIn 2019, construction was completed on a residential building[42] on the site of the former Anthony's Pier 4 Restaurant in South Boston.[43] The Harborwalk extends around the new building.[44]\n\nThe St. Regis residences,[45] a development proposal on a site adjacent to Pier 4, was opposed by an environmental group that argued that the proposal's accommodation of the Harborwalk was inadequate.[46] Construction began in 2019.[47]\n\nIn October 2018, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh announced a comprehensive climate change adaptation proposal to protect the Boston Harbor coastline from flooding.[48] In February 2022, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker announced an $8.2 million project to construct a 0.7-mile shared-use path from Tenean Beach on the Neponset River Reservation to Morrissey Boulevard and that will connect the Lower Neponset River Trail with the Harborwalk via Morrissey (including a 670-foot boardwalk in the salt marshes near the National Grid gas tank) that will be included in the $9.5 billion in federal funds the state government received under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.[49][50] In May 2023, the route for the Morrissey-Neponset walking trail connection was in the process of being cleared by Massachusetts Department of Transportation contractors.[51] In March 2024, UMass Boston graduate students and Friends of the Boston Harborwalk held a virtual public meeting to discuss and formulate a proposal for potential locations along the Dorchester segment of the Harborwalk for new signs and visual displays.[52]\n\nImage gallery (from North to South)\n\n[edit]\n\nHarborwalk sign at HarborArts, East Boston Shipyard and Marina\n\nNear the northern end of the Charlestown branch of the Harborwalk, with the Tobin Bridge\n\nHarborwalk next to Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Charlestown\n\nCharlestown near the Boston Navy Yard\n\nConstruction of the Harborwalk, with the Charlestown Bridge and the Zakim Bridge\n\nThe Harborwalk formerly crossed Fort Point Channel on the Old Northern Avenue Bridge\n\nPier 4\n\nFish Pier\n\nHarpoon Brewery\n\nInnovation and Design Building\n\nThe JFK Presidential Library and Museum as seen from the Boston Harborwalk on the Columbia Point segment\n\nBoston Globe photo essay\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
