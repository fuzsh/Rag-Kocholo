        "text": "Yellowstone Fishing Regulations\n\nClick the arrows on the right-hand side to expand each section below and learn more.\n\nYou are responsible for following all park regulations. Consult Yellowstone’s park newspaper, Camp in the Backcountry page, or rangers at visitor centers and backcountry offices to learn more.\n\nStay on established trails in thermal areas for your safety and to protect these fragile areas.\n\nDo not discard fish carcasses or entrails along stream banks or the lake shore as they will attract bears.\n\nDo not feed any animals, including birds, squirrels, and coyotes.\n\nBears and other wildlife may appear in areas frequented by people—even on trails, boardwalks, and along roads. Do not approach wildlife and remain at least 100 yards (92 meters) away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards (23 meters) away from all other wildlife.\n\nBe alert—watch for bears and bear sign, like fresh tracks or scat.\n\nMake noise in areas where visibility is limited.\n\nCarry bear spray and know how to use it.\n\nAvoid hiking or fishing alone. Try to stay with a group of three or more people.\n\nDo not run if you encounter a bear.\n\nBeginning Nov. 1, 2024, Yellowstone National Park will expand fishing access by allowing for year-round fishing opportunities at two locations in the park.\n\nThe Madison River from the Wyoming/Montana state line downstream to the park boundary near the West Entrance in West Yellowstone, Montana.\n\nThe Gardner River from Osprey Falls downstream to the confluence with the Yellowstone River near the North Entrance in Gardiner, Montana.\n\nOther fishing areas in the park will continue to be available during the standard fishing season, which is from the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend through Oct. 31 each year.\n\nExceptions are noted in each of the regional regulations.\n\nHours are daily from sunrise to sunset. Fishing with an artificial light is prohibited.\n\nSome areas are closed to human entry, have trail or seasonal closures, off-trail travel and daylight hour limitations, or party size recommendations. See the Bear Management Area restrictions in the Backcountry Trip Planner for specific rules and information.\n\nStreams may be temporarily closed due to low water levels and high water temperatures to protect fish populations.\n\nAnglers 16 years of age or older must be in possession of a valid Yellowstone National Park fishing permit to fish in the park. State fishing licenses are not valid and aren't required.\n\nThree-day permit: $40\n\nSeven-day permit: $55\n\nSeason-long permit: $75\n\nAs of May 1, 2023 fishing permits are available to purchase online via Recreation.gov.\n\nPark rangers may check permits and inspect tackle, fish, creels, or other containers where fish or tackle may be stored.\n\nAnglers 15 years of age or younger have two options:\n\nChildren 15 or younger may fish without a permit if they are fishing under the direct supervision of an adult who has a valid park fishing permit.\n\nChildren 15 or younger may obtain a free permit that must be signed by a responsible adult. With this permit, a child can fish without direct adult supervision.\n\nWith either option, the accompanying adult is responsible for the child’s actions and must ensure the child complies with all fishing regulations and provisions.\n\nTo reduce the potential for introduction or spread of aquatic invasive species, footgear with absorbent felt or other fibrous material on the soles are prohibited while fishing in Yellowstone.\n\nEach angler may use only one rod which must be attended at all times and used for angling only—intentional snagging of fish is not allowed.\n\nOnly lead-free1 artificial lures (e.g. spoon or spinner) or flies may be used. Leaded fishing tackle such as leaded split-shot sinkers, weighted jigs (lead molded to a hook), and soft lead-weighted ribbon for nymph fishing are not allowed.\n\nHooks must have points that are barbless2, or the barbs must be pinched down by pliers. Lures may have only one hook with a single, double, or treble configuration. A single pointed hook is the best choice for fishing in Yellowstone. Treble hooks (3 points) can severely injure fish and are often constructed with toxic lead solder.\n\nEach fly may have only one hook. Up to two flies may be used on a single leader (commonly referred to as “dropper,” “dry and dropper,” or “hopper and dropper”).\n\nExcept for feathers and other typical fly-tying materials, the hook must be bare. No organic or inorganic baits are allowed. Organic baits include fish or fish parts, minnows, salmon eggs, worms, insects, or foodstuffs such as bread and corn. Inorganic baits include rubber worms and plastic “twister” tails.\n\nScented attractants (liquid and solid baits) are illegal. Putting any substance in the water for the purpose of attracting fish (chumming) is illegal.\n\nExceptions\n\nNon-toxic split-shot, sinkers, and jig heads molded with bismuth-tin, molybdenum, or tungsten are allowed. Lead core line and heavy (> 4 lb.) downrigger weights used to fish for deep-dwelling lake trout are permissible because they are too large to be ingested by wildlife.\n\nArtificial lures are not allowed on the Firehole River, Madison River, and lower Gibbon River below Gibbon Falls. These streams are fly fishing only.\n\n1 Birds, such as loons, waterfowl, cranes, and shorebirds, are vulnerable to lead poisoning. While we can do little about natural hazards, we can minimize the effects of lead on these species. Yellowstone National Park bans most lead tackle. Terminal tackle must be lead-free. Large downrigger weights used to fish for deep-dwelling lake trout are permissible because they are too large to be ingested.\n\n2 Yellowstone has adopted a barbless hook rule to reduce handling time and injury, and improve the overall condition and appearance of fishes, especially in heavily-fished waters.\n\nIt is the responsibility of the angler to be able to identify fish by species. Unintentionally killed fish should be returned to the water so they can be consumed by wildlife.\n\nParkwide\n\nAll native fish must be released unharmed, including cutthroat trout, mountain whitefish, and Arctic grayling.\n\nNative Trout Conservation Area\n\nNo possession limit for nonnative fish, including brown, brook, rainbow, and lake trout. You may harvest as many nonnative fish from this area as you want.\n\nAll rainbow trout, brook trout, and identifiable cutthroat/rainbow hybrids caught in the Lamar River drainage, including portions of Slough and Soda Butte creeks, must be killed—it is illegal to release them alive.\n\nAll lake trout caught from Yellowstone Lake must be killed— it is illegal to release them alive.\n\nAll smallmouth bass caught in Yellowstone Park must be killed and reported—it is illegal to release them\n\nalive.\n\nNonnative Trout Tolerance Area\n\nAll native fish must be released unharmed. Possession limits exist for nonnative fish in this area. An angler must cease fishing in the area immediately after filling the possession limit.\n\nFirehole River, Madison River, lower Gibbon River (downstream of Gibbon Falls)—possession of up to five brook trout is allowed. Catch and release all rainbow and brown trout. Whitefish are an important native species in the Madison River and they must be released.\n\nLewis River system above Lewis Falls, including Lewis and Shoshone lakes and their tributaries— possession of five combined brook, brown or lake trout; only one of which may be a brown trout.\n\nSkin must remain attached so the fish species can be visibly identified.\n\nGills and entrails may be removed in the field, but must be discarded only within the waters where the fish were caught.\n\nDispose of fish and/or fish entrails within the waters where the fish was caught but not within 100 feet (30.5 m) of boat ramps, docks, or backcountry campsites.\n\nFish can also be disposed of in park trash cans.\n\nFishing is restricted from all road bridges, marinas and boat docks, except from boat docks located at backcountry locations on Yellowstone Lake. Accessible fishing platforms and ramps are located near Madison Junction and at Grant Village boat launch.\n\nAll vessels—including float tubes— require a boat permit.\n\nTransporting or introducing invasive species is prohibited: make sure you clean, drain, and dry boats and gear before arriving for your Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS) inspection.\n\nAll vessels also require a life vest for each passenger, and an emergency sound device such as a whistle or air horn.\n\nAll vessels must be checked by National Park Service inspectors to ensure that they are free of aquatic invasive species before entering any park waters.\n\nTo better ensure survival of hooked fish, follow these guidelines. Please help us maintain quality fisheries within the park for future generations to enjoy!\n\nHandling\n\nFor all native fish and any nonnative fish you intend to release, bring the fish in as quickly as possible. Do not play the fish to exhaustion.\n\nAlways make sure your hands are wet if you must handle the fish. Dry hands damage a fish’s protective mucous film.\n\nHold the fish with one hand around the tail section and the other beneath the belly, just behind the pectoral fins.\n\nNever grab or hold a fish through the gills unless it is already dead.\n\nIf you want a photo of the fish, make sure the photographer is ready before you handle the fish. Make it quick.\n\nUnhooking\n\nUnhook the fish in quiet water such as an eddy or slow spot. Do not drag the fish across land.\n\nUse forceps or small needle-nosed pliers to quickly remove the hook.\n\nTackle, Lures, and Hooks\n\nHooks and lures typically have barbs when purchased. With small pliers you must pinch down the barbs. Without barbs more skill is required in landing and bringing in fish, but hook removal is easier and less traumatic to the fish.\n\nSpinning lures typically have three hooks called treble hooks. With wire cutters you can snip off one of the hooks or snap one off with pliers; you also must pinch down all the barbs. Two hooks are still effective, easier to remove, and less traumatic.\n\nIf the fish is deeply hooked, cut the line, do not pull out the hook. Most fish can survive with hooks left in.\n\nExhausted Fish\n\nNever just throw a fish back into the water. If a fish becomes passive, it is probably close to exhaustion.\n\nGently remove the hook within calm water, then lightly cradle the fish with your hands to see what it does.\n\nIf it struggles to keep itself upright, hold the fish around its tail and beneath its belly with its head facing upstream into the current.\n\nMove the fish gently back and forth toward and away from the current. You should notice the gills opening and closing due to the rush of water. This is like giving a fish mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.\n\nWhen the fish has recovered, it should swim away on its own.\n\nFloy Tags\n\nPark biologists are conducting a study to determine fish movement patterns and population sizes in Yellowstone Lake and several other park waters. Biologists have attached a Floy tag near the fish’s dorsal fin. The tags are typically orange or yellow in color and have a unique identification number.\n\nIf you catch a tagged cutthroat:\n\nRecord the tag number (photo or written) and release the fish unharmed.\n\nNote the location the fish was caught.\n\nCall or text 406-404-4877 and report the tag number and location of catch.\n\nIf the fish accidentally died, please include that detail in your report.\n\nVolunteer to Help Manage Yellowstone Fisheries\n\nThe activities necessary to preserve and restore native fish varies by species and drainages across the park. In order to promote the preservation of native fish in Yellowstone, the park has designated the Native Trout Conservation Area for special management. Within that area, fishing regulations are structured so that recreational anglers help selectively remove nonnative species from the area without damaging the native fishery. In some areas, anglers' harvests will help to save the native fish and the natural ecosystems they support.\n\nAnglers have contributed to the fisheries database by reporting their catch. This information helps monitor the status of fisheries throughout the park. Since 1979, anglers have been asked to keep records on fishing trips - stream or lake visited, time spent fishing, fish species caught, lengths of fish - to help park managers understand fisheries status and track changes in specific populations. Decisions about how best to achieve native fish preservations and recovery goals must be based in sound sceintific research and consistent with the mission of the National Park Service.\n\nDuring the 2024 Fishing Season, Yellowstone National Park will not be collecting angler surveys. Please check back next year for a national creel survey program that will benefit the park.\n\nAngler groups have also lent support to management actions, such as closing the Fishing Bridge to fishing in the early 1970s. Yellowstone cutthroat trout support a $36 million annual sport fishery to the local economy. Also, money generated from fishing licenses helps fund research on aquatic systems and restoration projects.\n\nDecisions about how best to achieve native fish preservation and recovery goals must be based in sound scientific research and be consistent with the mission of the National Park Service. In past years, a team of fishing volunteers assisted the fisheries program with several other projects. These projects included nonnative species removal, species composition, fish barrier evaluation, and injury and mortality rates of barbed and barbless hooks. Their extensive help collecting data and biological samples allows park biologists to learn about many more areas than park staff would have time to access.\n\nVolunteer Fly-fishing Program\n\nAgain this year, a team of fishing volunteers assisted the fisheries program with several other projects in the volunteer fly-fishing program. Sponsored by Yellowstone Forever, projects include nonnative species removal, species composition, fish barrier evaluation, and injury and mortality rates of barbed and barbless hooks. The volunteer cadre's extensive help collecting data and biological samples allows park biologists to learn about many more areas than park staff would have time to access.\n\nFishing Areas & Regions\n\nFish in Yellowstone's Northwest\n\nReview specific regulations to fishing in the northwest region of Yellowstone.\n\nFish in Yellowstone's Northeast\n\nReview specific regulations to fishing in the northeast region of Yellowstone.\n\nFish in Yellowstone's Southwest\n\nReview specific regulations to fishing in the southwest region of Yellowstone.\n\nFish in Yellowstone's Southeast\n\nReview specific regulations to fishing in the southeast region of Yellowstone.\n\nTake a look at this comparison to see the differences between westslope cutthroat trout (native fish) and rainbow trout (nonnative fish).
