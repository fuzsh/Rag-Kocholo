        "text": "2 Whole-life carbon assessments\n\nCurrent Government policies on decarbonising the built environment and addressing whole-life carbon\n\n10. The Government states that decarbonising UK industry is a core part of its ambitions for a green industrial revolution. The Government seeks to decarbonise industry in line with net zero, while remaining competitive and without pushing emissions abroad. The Government states that it also understands the importance of properly accounting for carbon, which is why it is “working to ensure that the whole life of building materials is accounted for, including the impact of any embodied carbon.”\n\n11. In March 2021 the Government published its Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy. The strategy considers new policy approaches which government could introduce to accelerate the market for low-carbon industrial materials, including construction products. The Strategy seeks to build upon the commitments in the Clean Growth Strategy and the 25 Year Environment Plan to increase the use of low-carbon materials in construction.\n\n12. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities’ role in the planning process and setting building regulations also offers levers to decrease the environmental impacts of construction. From 2019 to 2021 the Government ran a consultation on the Future Homes Standard and Future Building Standard. These standards seek to deliver an uplift in energy efficiency standards for new homes and buildings, improve ventilation and mitigate overheating in residential buildings. Changes to certain building regulations including Part L (fuel and power) are coming into force in June 2022: these changes represent a stepping-stone towards the Future Homes Standard.\n\nSource: WLCN, LETI and RIBA (2021)\n\nThe Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy\n\n13. The Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy, which the Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy issued in March 2021, sets out how the Government seeks to decarbonise the construction sector. Under the Strategy, the Government has committed to:\n\nimprove the transparency of embodied emissions data by launching a call for evidence on emissions reporting and defining low-carbon products between 2021–2022;\n\ndevelop a proposal by 2023 for how carbon reporting of industrial products could be achieved;\n\ndevelop proposals for new product standards and product labelling which may include assessment of the embodied carbon of industrial products: the Government states that this could be implemented from the mid-2020s onwards;\n\ntest different methods of doing embodied carbon assessments, including examining the use of whole-life cycle assessments;\n\nconsider whether existing certification systems such as Environmental Product Declarations, could be used or made mandatory to determine the environmental impact of intermediary industrial products; and\n\ndevelop a set of indicators for low-carbon materials which appropriately reflect relevant considerations such as embodied carbon and life cycle assessment.\n\nThe Future Homes Standard\n\n14. In January 2021 the Government published the response to its consultation on the Future Homes Standard which it launched in October 2019. The new standard will be introduced in 2025 and will set energy efficiency standards for new homes and extensions. The standard will comprise a series of amendments to Part F (ventilation) and Part L (conservation of fuel and power) of the Building Regulations for new homes. The Standard establishes measures that seek to ensure that from 2025, an average home will produce at least 75% lower CO2 emissions than one built to current energy efficiency requirements. It aims to achieve this through increasing energy efficiency requirements and promoting the installation of low-carbon heating systems (such as heat pumps). The Standard will require homes built from 2025 to be ‘zero carbon ready’: that is, they should not require further energy efficiency retrofit measures to become zero-carbon. The Standard is solely concerned with energy efficiency measures, thereby only addressing the in-use operational carbon of buildings.\n\n15. Non-government organisations and industry groups have welcomed the Standard but have said it does not go far enough in decarbonising new homes. The UK Green Building Council (UKGBC) said it was:\n\nregrettable that the Standard won’t be implemented until 2025, despite it being widely trailed that it would be brought forward to 2023.\n\n16. UKGBC recommended that the Government set out a trajectory for tightening Building Regulations to ensure that by 2030 all new buildings operate at net zero carbon for regulated and unregulated energy including embodied carbon. In a letter to the previous Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, Robert Jenrick, the CCC issued a series of recommendations to address what they saw as deficiencies in the Future Homes Standard. This included recommending that full definition of the policy should be set now and legislated before 2024 to give the market certainty. The letter pointed to the scrapped Zero Carbon Homes policy, which it said left many investments stranded and “weakened industry confidence”. The CCC noted that Scotland would be introducing equivalent standards in 2024.\n\n17. Despite publication of the Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy and the Future Homes Standard, there remains nothing in national policy that requires embodied carbon emissions to be measured, or controlled, other than on a voluntary basis. The Government said that its engagement with industry on embodied and whole-life carbon to date suggests that for large and small developers measuring embodied carbon is unfamiliar territory. The Government said that the methodology for the in-use and end-of-life embodied carbon emissions in construction is to be addressed in a cross-government working group on Government construction metrics run by the Infrastructure and Projects Authority (IPA).\n\nIndustry and stakeholder views on whole-life carbon\n\n18. In 2019 the Climate Change Committee (CCC) published its report UK Housing: Fit for the future? This report made several recommendations to Government on sustainable building, including incentivising the use of wood in construction and developing policies to minimise the whole-life carbon impact of new buildings.\n\n19. The CCC noted that there was no easily accessible source of ‘whole-life’ cost information to allow simple comparison between the costs of green infrastructure solutions (e.g. timber) and traditional grey infrastructure solutions (e.g. steel and concrete). AECOM, in a report produced for the CCC, recommended that embodied and sequestered carbon be considered in the buildings standards framework. AECOM provided three options for this to be achieved:\n\n(1) Government could monitor embodied carbon and lead with mandatory reporting and reduction through its own procurement;\n\n(2) that “whole life carbon intensity limits” be set in Building Regulations for relevant elements, product types and materials; or\n\n(3) a scheduled introduction of whole building lifecycle carbon intensity targets in building regulations could be considered.\n\n20. Many who made submissions to this inquiry observed that little to no progress had been made against the CCC’s recommendations on sustainable new housing. The School of Architecture and Built Environment (SoABE), University of Wolverhampton, summarised why action had been limited explaining that: decarbonising the structural fabric of new homes remains entirely voluntary within the construction industry; there was little evidence, outside of a specialist niche, that there was widespread awareness, understanding or skill to deliver a low-embodied carbon built environment; evidence suggested that the public’s awareness, understanding, or demand for low embodied carbon products, including buildings, might be limited; and there was a need for further research and piloting in the field of decarbonising the structural fabric of buildings before policy and incentives were fixed.\n\n21. Dr Jannik Giesekam, Lecturer, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Strathclyde, suggested that there was no current trend towards any reduction of the total annual embodied carbon emissions associated with development of the UK built environment. This is demonstrated by the dark orange line labelled ‘capital carbon’ in figure 1 below. In some sectors the term ‘capital carbon’ is used instead of ‘embodied carbon’.\n\nSource: Dr Jannik Giesekam (Research Fellow in Industrial Climate Policy at University of Leeds) (SBE0075)\n\n22. In its recent assessment of the Government’s Heat and Building Strategy, the CCC said that the Government’s strategies gave no consideration to the issue of embodied carbon associated with constructing new buildings. In the CCC’s view, this posed a specific risk in the Government’s approach to newbuild homes. The CCC recommended that the Government introduce practices which minimise the embodied carbon of new build homes.\n\n23. Architects, academics, and industry bodies noted that positive action responding to the CCC’s recommendations had been taken by local authorities and cities. The Greater London Authority (GLA), the West Midlands Combined Authority and other local authorities have started to introduce planning policy on whole-life carbon emissions. The GLA’s guidance means that all projects referred to the Mayor must undertake whole-life carbon assessments.\n\n24. We heard consistently that the construction industry was willing and able to conduct whole-life carbon (WLC) assessments, if the Government were to set a national methodology for assessments and make tools for assessment freely available. Industry stakeholders said this would allow for consistent and comparable assessments to be made. Currently, there is no standard software tool for the UK for measuring embodied carbon. Dr Joe Jack Williams, Associate, Researcher, Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios said:\n\nWe are seeing a groundswell within the industry looking at the issue of whole life carbon and embodied carbon […] There are a number of different standards out there and we are trying our best to align them […] What would be helpful from Government is a line in the sand to say, “This is the standard approach” and that is what we are asking for in many ways.\n\nViews on costs associated with whole-life carbon assessments\n\n25. Witnesses also indicated that conducting whole-life carbon (WLC) assessments and reducing the embodied carbon of projects need not cost more than traditional carbon-intensive construction methods. Mesh Energy, an energy consultancy, assessed the embodied and whole-life carbon associated with a building project under scenarios using a range of materials. The study provided a range of outcomes in terms of carbon and cost, with the least and greatest impacts as shown in Figure 2 below. Mesh Energy’s figures demonstrate that a steel frame is the most expensive and least carbon efficient choice over the project’s lifecycle. On the basis of these figures, for a similar lifecycle cost, a form of timber material could be used in construction which would entail significantly less embodied carbon and whole-life carbon emissions.\n\nCross Laminated Timber ASHP\n\n409\n\n1,110,815\n\n£9,732,339\n\nSteel Frame ASHP\n\n759\n\n1,705,555\n\n£9,842,762\n\nConcrete Frame ASHP\n\n517\n\n1,293,456\n\n£9,763,475\n\nTimber Frame ASHP\n\n423\n\n1,136,289\n\n£9,706,344\n\nCross Laminated Timber Gas and Electricity\n\n446\n\n1,705,635\n\n£9,632,480\n\nSteel Frame Gas and Electricity\n\n770\n\n2,255,387\n\n£9,734,667\n\nConcrete Frame Gas and Electricity\n\n529\n\n1,842,964\n\n£9,655,380\n\nCross Laminated Timber Biomass\n\n409\n\n1,075,704\n\n£9,642,746\n\nSteel Frame Biomass\n\n733\n\n1,625,455\n\n£9,744,933\n\nConcrete Frame Biomass\n\n491\n\n1,213,356\n\n£9,665,646\n\nSource: Mesh Energy (SBE0040)\n\n26. For small housing projects, we heard that WLC assessments were more expensive to undertake than energy performance certificate (EPC) assessments. The increased cost is understandable, given the scope of a WLC assessment compared with an EPC. Peter Conboy, Development Director, igloo Regeneration Ltd, a company focusing on developing low-carbon housing projects, said:\n\n[WLC assessments] are significantly more costly than an EPC. An EPC—12, 13 years after the introduction—is now down as low as £30 a home sometimes, depending on the house type […] We are not anywhere near that level [for WLC assessments […] We are talking £200 to £400 a property, minimum. It will come down but it will only come down when we standardise.\n\n27. For large-scale developments (10 housing units or more), Dr Giesekam said that costs for WLC assessments may be negligible. He also commented on the different factors affecting costs:\n\nFirst, the costs are really variable. What are you assessing, when is it being done and how? Are you paying external consultants to do it? Are you using tools to support your assessment? Are they free ones or are they licensed ones? Is it your first time doing an assessment, in which case it is going to be very time-consuming and costly? Or are you just updating the standard design that you already have?\n\nThe other point is that you have to consider these costs relative to scale … . If you are doing large-scale developments such as this, the cost is relatively negligible compared to the overall cost of the scheme.\n\nHe did not advise using WLC assessment for single properties, a requirement he considered to be “overly onerous”.\n\n28. Dr Giesekam’s analysis of the cost of whole-life carbon assessments was corroborated by Adam Mactavish of Currie & Brown, an asset management and construction consultancy. He said that the time taken to conduct assessments had greatly reduced over the last 20 years and that for simple structure building projects, conducting assessments was relatively straightforward. He noted that the more routine these assessments were, the more standard solutions could be deployed to enable assessments to be even quicker and more efficient.\n\n29. When asked whether reducing embodied carbon leads to additional costs, Dr Alice Moncaster, Senior Lecturer at the School of Engineering and Innovation, The Open University said:\n\nIt should not do. If you reduce embodied carbon there are two ways of doing it. You can choose to use less material, which should cost less. The other is to use a lower carbon material, which on the whole means it has used less energy in its manufacture so again should cost less. Once it becomes normal, the costs of the low embodied carbon building should be lower than the cost of the high embodied carbon building, however it is obviously down to what is normal in industry and what skillsets people have.\n\nIf we replace a concrete frame and all brick and block houses with timber-framed houses, then you can reduce embodied carbon by about half. However, if you do not have the skillset to do that, and if you do not have the supply chains to provide that, you will not realise those cost savings. In theory, it should be a cost saving.\n\n30. There was consensus in the evidence we heard that the standardisation of the WLC assessment process, through regulation, would substantially reduce costs. This in turn would reduce the costs of low-carbon construction.\n\nScheduling the introduction of whole-life carbon assessments\n\n31. Government commitments to the introduction of WLC assessments have lacked a clear timeline for implementation, an issue consistently raised by our witnesses. Dr Giesekam told us that while the Heat and Buildings Strategy and the Net Zero Strategy represented “a step forward on embodied carbon in terms of there being some future commitments around it”, the timeline was “very vague”. He said:\n\nIn particular, in the net zero strategy, we had the statement that, “Government aims to support action in the construction sector by improving reporting on embodied carbon in buildings and infrastructure with a view to exploring a maximum level for new builds in the future.”[…] We also saw, in the Government’s response […] to the annual progress report from the Committee on Climate Change [for 2021], a commitment again around embodied carbon but, again, with no timeline stating when they intended to enact this or what the details of that would be.\n\n32. The architects who gave evidence to us consistently recommended that a clear timeline for the adoption of WLC assessment as a mandatory requirement for construction was needed to increase professional knowledge and capability in embodied carbon and provide the necessary signals for the construction industry to invest in managing it. The Architects Climate Action Network have recommended that mandatory reporting be introduced in 2022, followed by the introduction of limit values in 2025, which will then be reduced over time. The Part Z campaign, which seeks to introduce mandatory WLC assessments as part of building regulations recommends a similar timeline, with the introduction of mandatory assessments starting in 2023.\n\n33. Will Arnold, Head of Climate Action, The Institution of Structural Engineers, said the only remaining barrier to introducing whole-life carbon assessments in the UK, was the lack of a timeline for its implementation:\n\n[W]e have methodology; we have a way of reporting; we have the skillset throughout the industry. Not all of industry has upskilled yet. Those that have have typically done it in the last two years … In the last two years, everything you see today has happened in that period of time. In another two years, even without regulation you will probably see the same movement again. But with firm deadlines you will see more of that. To me that sort of time period is the only real barrier that needs to still be overcome. To overcome it you need to set dates in stone.\n\nAction on whole-life carbon in other countries\n\n34. Internationally, whole-life carbon and embodied carbon regulations exist at a national level in some European countries and at a state level in the United States. For example:\n\nThe Netherlands: since 2013, the ‘Building Decree 2012’ requires new residential and office buildings larger than 100m to have whole-life carbon calculations and carbon mitigation cost estimates using a national methodology.\n\nFrance: from early 2022 the new ‘RE2020’ will require whole-life carbon calculations for all new housing projects with an emphasis on the use of wood in construction. Reduction targets will be set incrementally to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The scheme has been running since 2016 on a voluntary basis to build a database and upskill the sector.\n\nCalifornia: the ‘Buy Clean California Act’ applies to infrastructure projects and public buildings and sets out ‘Carbon Intensity Limits’ on certain construction materials.\n\n35. Figure 3 provides a high-level overview of embodied carbon policy developments in several comparator countries and states.\n\n36. In European countries where there is regulation at building level (for example, the Netherlands, France, Finland, Sweden), a national methodology is provided in line with European Standards for assessing life cycle carbon. Many of these jurisdictions are engaged in multi-year programmes to develop policy targeting embodied or whole-life carbon assessment or reduction. This typically takes the form of introducing a life cycle or carbon assessment requirement drawing upon common underpinning policy infrastructure such as a national methodology, product database and approved tools. Often an initial period of embedding reporting (typically 3-5 years) is followed by the introduction of targets and a long-term ratcheting down of target levels.\n\n37. There is no standard assessment tool in the UK for measuring embodied carbon, as a result there can be variation between outputs depending on which tool is used, and inconsistency in assessments across industry. Dr Giesekam estimated that by the mid-2020s many of the UK’s comparator countries would have introduced embodied carbon targets through policy instruments. He said that if the UK did not follow suit it would be an outlier compared to typical comparator countries.\n\n38. Dr Giesekam argued that there was scope for the UK to learn from emerging international best practice and the diverse range of policies that will be implemented in the short to medium term. He recommended that this be supported by a formal structure, for instance an Embodied Carbon Policy Observatory, which could also provide a platform for knowledge exchange, technical support and training, and independent assessment of policy effectiveness. In the absence of any formal structure, responsibility to monitor international developments ought to be allocated to officials in relevant Government departments.\n\n39. Dr Giesekam observed that many of the countries highlighted in Figure 3 had also introduced complementary policies requiring increased disclosure of product information, and incentives targeting related policy areas such as reduced waste, increased circularity or promotion of specific design options like timber construction. He recommended that a similarly complementary package of policy measures be adopted by the UK.\n\n40. Dr Alice Moncaster said that there was evidence that the introduction of regulations to reduce embodied carbon in countries such as France has had a rapid impact on industry behaviour and construction material supply chains, significantly reducing the carbon emissions from construction.\n\nEmbodied carbon methodology, standards and tools\n\n41. Since 2011, European Standards have been provided to ensure a level of consistency in the assessment of life cycle carbon and other quantified environmental information. These formed the basis of British Standards that set out the structure for carbon assessments, such as BS EN 15978, for Buildings, and BS EN 15804 for Environmental Product Declarations. In the evidence we received, the BS EN 15978 standard ‘Sustainability of construction works: Assessment of environmental performance of buildings calculation method’ was consistently identified as the accepted industry-leading standard for measuring and reporting the embodied carbon impacts of buildings in the UK. This standard comprises the overarching framework under which additional items of guidance provide further detail and consistency in approach.\n\n42. Additional guidance available includes the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Professional Statement on Whole Life Carbon. This was developed in response to the inconsistent application of BS EN 15978 in the UK, which many attribute to the lack of a mandatory national methodology. It aims to provide principles and practical guidance for whole-life carbon assessment to be adopted across UK industry.\n\n43. In support of, and consistent with, the RICS Professional Statement methodology, increasing quantities of guidance on whole-life carbon good practice are being published by professional institutions in the built environment, including the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE), the Institution of Structural Engineers (IStructE), the London Energy Transformation Initiative (LETI), the UK Green Building Council: (UKGBC), the Architects Climate Action Network (ACAN) and others.\n\n44. Alongside the RICS methodology and supplementary guidance, various software tools are available for professionals seeking to carry out embodied carbon assessments and life cycle assessments at both product and building level; some of these tools are free to use. The variety of tools used in the UK market lead to variations in WLC assessment results, creating inconsistencies and reducing comparability of outputs. Inconsistencies largely arise from variations between the data sources used and assumptions made when undertaking WLC assessments. Dr Giesekam observed that:\n\nThe primary gap preventing consistent assessment across the sector is not a lack of underlying standards or guidance but the lack of prescriptive assessment boundaries and defaults that are typically prescribed within a national methodology.\n\n45. Although it is not officially the UK’s prescribed methodology, we repeatedly heard from practitioners and academics that the RICS methodology was used by industry as the way to implement the British Standards for embodied carbon assessment. RIBA, LETI, ACAN and others recommended that the RICS methodology be adopted as the UK industry standard. RIBA considered the RICS methodology to be the most comprehensive and consistent approach available to UK industry. This was supported by the UK Green Building Council, The Alliance for Sustainable Building Products (ASBP), academics from the University of Sheffield and others.\n\n46. The Greater London Authority’s (GLA) new London Plan, introduced in March 2021, requires all developments over a certain size to calculate embodied impacts following the RICS methodology. The GLA told us that the methodology had so far worked without any fundamental issues.\n\n47. The Concrete Block Association and Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers voiced concerns over certain aspects of the RICS methodology. The Concrete Block Association, which is a trade association for UK producers of aggregate concrete blocks and their suppliers, recommended that the RICS methodology be updated to use “more realistic wastage rates” and “up to date EPDs for concrete blocks”, to reflect the environmental performance of buildings more accurately. CIBSE argued that the RICS methodology could under-estimate operational carbon emissions from energy use because it only covered regulated energy uses. This could create a discrepancy between calculated and actual energy use in buildings. CIBSE said that aside from this concern it broadly supported the RICS methodology. Dr Giesekam summarised the status and accessibility of whole-life carbon methodology, standards, tools and regulation in the UK:\n\nWhat we have had over the last decade is essentially the development of the RICS methodology, and a huge body of guidance […] from all of the professional institutions, various voluntary initiatives and so on, that have attempted to put in place all of the key bits that you need to do this consistently. Fundamentally, they have been hindered by the fact that all of that has been done on a voluntary ad hoc basis. It has not been co-ordinated through some central policy or regulation that is driving it. It is much easier, if you are a practitioner in any of the other countries that have developed this, to do these assessments, because I have a standard national database I go to, I have a set of tools that are accredited to it, I have one standard in national methodology that I use. It is very simple. We do not have that in the UK and we are not going to develop that on a voluntary basis. That will only be done through regulation.\n\nWe were told that the lack of a Government-approved methodology for, and requirement to, undertake assessments had led to a complex and uneven playing field, which was making WLC assessments less accessible and adding to the cost of assessment for those that did them. Jane Anderson, a board member of the Alliance for Sustainable Building Products (ASBP), told us that a common approach was “not as difficult as people [made] out”:\n\nThere is a willingness to take this on board. If everybody is doing it together there is a level playing field. Part of the problem is that a lot of organisations that are doing this are suffering […] because they have to pay to make these assessments, to invest in the staff and training, while lots of other people do not have to do that. They have been regulating this in the Netherlands since 2012 and we must up our game.\n\nPeter Conboy, Development Director, igloo Regeneration Ltd told us that costs of WLC assessments would only come down when the assessment methodology and tools are standardised.\n\n48. When we asked Ministers whether the RICS methodology could be adopted as the official national methodology for whole-life carbon assessments in the UK, Lord Callanan, Minister for Business, Energy and Corporate Responsibility at the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy responded:\n\n[The RICS methodology] is quite complicated. It would incorporate advances in carbon assessment methodolog[y] and reporting. It is one of the options that we are considering for taking forward, but there are alternative views as well and there is some opposition to that.\n\n49. Eddie Hughes MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, summarised potential drawbacks in the use of RICS methodology:\n\nthe RICS approach is fundamentally a paper-based approach where you have to fill in forms and calculations along the way, whereas in the 21st century we need some sort of online process that feeds into the data. But to get to that position you need all the constituent data that then feeds into the process to be available […] While RICS is the system that has been around the longest and has gathered momentum for that reason, it needs to be a bit slicker and a bit smarter.\n\n50. The Ministers’ analysis of the RICS methodology ran counter to the weight of evidence we received which suggested widespread industry support, confidence and use of the RICS methodology and willingness for the methodology to be adopted as the UK standard. Jane Anderson noted that whilst the RICS methodology might be more complex, the software tools used by most firms actually to undertake WLC assessments based on the RICS methodology were easy to use. Jane Anderson said that only larger firms with the appropriate funds and expertise tended to interface directly with the RICS methodology.\n\n51. Lord Callanan did accept the requirement for a “standardised, widely accepted assessment methodology”, which he said the Government was exploring. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy is also considering whether to fund an update of the RICS methodology to aid consistency of reporting, to make the methodology more accessible and more transparent for use in housing, infrastructure and retrofit, and more suited to assisting the sector in delivering on the Government’s net zero carbon commitments. Damitha Adikaari, Director for Climate Science and Energy Innovation, Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, told us that the RICS update would also seek to address issues associated with the lack of consistent data sources and measurement metrics.\n\nBuilding regulations and whole-life carbon\n\n52. Building Regulations control how buildings are to be designed or modified on the public policy grounds of health, safety, and environmental performance. They establish minimum standards for the design and construction of, and alterations to, virtually every building. The Building Regulations 2010 cover the construction and extension of buildings for England and Wales and these regulations are supported by Approved Documents. Approved Documents set out detailed practical guidance on compliance with the regulations. Building regulation is generally a devolved matter.\n\n53. The detailed requirements of the Building Regulations in England and Wales are scheduled within 16 separate headings, each designated by a letter (Part A to Part S), and covering a discrete aspect of practice, such as structure (Part A), fire safety (Part B), and conservation of fuel and power (Part L).\n\n54. The England and Wales building regulations relevant to carbon emissions appear to focus exclusively on operational energy reductions: that is, improving energy efficiency in buildings. No building regulations address embodied carbon emissions from buildings or the embodied carbon costs of actions to reduce operational energy use. Decarbonising the structural fabric of newly built properties remains an entirely voluntary activity within the construction industry.\n\n55. The Future Homes Standard, due to be introduced in 2025, also does not include any measures to address embodied carbon emissions. During consultation on the Standard, some stakeholders raised concerns over the lack of provisions on measuring and reducing embodied carbon. Architects Climate Action Network have called for whole-life carbon to be considered in amendments to the design aspects of building regulations for both new buildings and retrofitting of buildings. IStructE have highlighted that using this approach to building design can help to ensure that low operational carbon design does not inadvertently increase embodied carbon and vice versa.\n\n56. In response, the Government said that it intends to carry out longer-term work to examine a wider scope around how new buildings can be designed and constructed to be fit for a zero-carbon future.\n\n57. In July 2021, whole-life carbon experts, with the support of representatives from the construction industry, published a report that proposed amendments to the Building Regulations 2010. The proposals were described by the authors as a ‘proof-of-concept’, to demonstrate how embodied carbon could be incorporated into UK regulation and were termed ‘Part Z’. The proposals outline requirements for the assessment of whole-life carbon emissions, and limiting of embodied carbon emissions, for all major building projects. The proposals seek to introduce mandatory assessments ahead of setting carbon limits, giving industry and policymakers time to converge on these limits by 2027.\n\n58. The authors have provided a draft on an Approved Document to go alongside Part Z, which they state is aligned with the RICS WLC assessment methodology and guidance and recommendations from RIBA, IStructE, UKGBC and LETI on embodied carbon. The staggered introduction dates for WLC assessments and then carbon targets are modelled on timescales set by other countries. The proposal has widespread industry support from over 130 firms, many operating internationally, spanning major construction companies, professional institutions, architectural firms, engineering firms, property developers, asset managers, and environmental consultants. A Bill seeking to enact Part Z was recently introduced to the House of Commons.\n\n59. As we have set out above, some European countries and states of the United States have enacted building regulations that require mandatory assessment of the whole-life and embodied carbon emissions of buildings. The Green Construction Board among several other witnesses recommended that the Building Regulations be updated to include mandatory whole-life carbon assessments, and progressive ratcheting up of carbon targets for buildings. For example the UK GBC recommended that:\n\ni) At the next uplift, the Government should phase in requirements for the assessment of whole-life carbon, starting with larger developments;\n\nii) In 2025, requirements should be introduced for all developments to assess and disclose whole-life carbon impacts, and targets for reductions should be phased in, starting with larger developments;\n\niii) In 2030, targets should be introduced for all developments to make reductions in whole-life carbon.\n\nThe planning system and whole-life carbon\n\n60. The application of Building Regulations is separate and distinct from ‘Town Planning’ and ‘planning permission’; the Building Regulations control how buildings are to be designed or modified on the public grounds of health, safety and environmental performance, while ‘planning permission’ is concerned with appropriate development, architectural quality, the nature of land use, and the appearance of neighbourhoods. Therefore, both must be considered when building works are to be undertaken.\n\n61. Some local authorities have gone beyond current national planning policies and regulations to consider whole-life and embodied carbon in their Local Plans. These plans set planning policies in a local authority area.\n\n62. Under the Greater London Authority’s London Plan, projects referred to the Mayor of London are mandated to calculate whole-life carbon emissions through a nationally recognised methodology and to demonstrate actions taken to reduce emissions (Policy SI 2). WLC assessments are recommended for all other major buildings within the GLA’s jurisdiction. Under the London Plan, current WLC assessments are conducted according to the British Standards Institution’s BS EN 15978:2011, using the RICS methodology.\n\n63. Rhian Williams, Principal Strategic Planner to the Greater London Authority, told us that there had been few barriers to the introduction of this policy:\n\n[T]here weren’t a lot of real fundamental objections to us introducing policy on whole life carbon. [… I]t was something that was recognised in the industry and by a lot of the community that responded […] that this was something that was lacking and it wasn’t something that the Government were sharing leadership on. It was a real opportunity for us to try to move things forward.\n\n64. The inclusion of embodied carbon and whole-life carbon assessments have been introduced in the city plans of other local authorities, such as the West Midlands Combined Authority (2021), Brighton & Hove City Council (2008), and in draft form in Central Lincolnshire (2022). Several submissions recommended that the GLA’s approach to calculating whole-life carbon be adopted and rolled out as national policy.\n\n65. Will Arnold, of the Institution of Structural Engineers, explained that the planning system and building regulations were needed in tandem to reduce the embodied carbon of construction:\n\nBy requiring teams to assess whole life carbon at concept stage, an early stage in the project, it means that when the design team is small, when strategic decisions are yet to be made, it elevates the importance of carbon and it puts it on a par with having to deliver this on time and on budget, which means people are talking about it early enough to make the right decisions.\n\nWithout having that at planning stage, it is a can that gets kicked down the road. If it is a requirement, a regulation, you don’t do that, so it is an important thing.\n\n66. When we asked Ministers whether mandatory whole-life carbon assessments could be expected within the proposed Planning Bill, Ministers acknowledged the work of local authorities in this area. Eddie Hughes said:\n\nyou are absolutely right about the innovative work that other councils are doing and it will be good for us to see how they progress and how other people embrace it … . There is an obvious symbiotic relationship between planning and building reg[ulation]s and we need to work as Government to make sure that we maximise that.\n\n67. Catherine Adams, Director of Net Zero and Greener Building, Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said:\n\nlocal authorities can go above and beyond [building regulations] for planning procurement. We see that happening in local authorities in specific areas where they have chosen to go further than the minimum standards and what they are expecting to see in their local area.\n\n68. The responses of the Minister and his official suggest that the Government does not currently intend to introduce mandatory whole-life carbon assessments as part of the planning system, but welcomes local authorities introducing whole-life carbon requirements within their Local Plans.\n\nOur view on whole-life carbon assessments\n\n69. There is no Government policy requiring the assessment or control of embodied carbon emissions from buildings. As a result, no progress has been made in reducing these emissions within the built environment. This inaction remains despite the built environment making up 25 per cent of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions and the UK’s Nationally Determined Contribution, made at COP26, committing the UK to achieve a 68% reduction in the UK’s carbon emissions by 2030. This is only eight years away. This is an extremely short time frame within which to start assessing and substantially reducing embodied carbon emissions. The first step must be a requirement to undertake whole-life carbon assessments for buildings so the industry can start measuring and then controlling for this carbon.\n\n70. A broad cross-section of the construction industry is willing and able to undertake whole-life carbon assessments. In the absence of an approved UK national methodology, the RICS Professional Statement on WLC is used as the accepted industry methodology for WLC assessments. Alongside this, various further guidance and software tools have been developed. As a result of the lack of an approved national methodology, the variety of assessment tools and interpretations for WLC that have developed appear to have created inconsistency, have unnecessarily increased the cost of WLC assessments and have led to an uneven playing field in conducting assessments.\n\n71. The Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy is currently considering the possibility of funding an update of the RICS methodology. This update is intended to make the methodology more accessible and more transparent thus addressing the concerns raised by Ministers to us about the RICS methodology. Once the national methodology and requirement to undertake whole-life carbon assessments is in place, the cost of undertaking assessments is likely to be minimal.\n\n72. The UK is slipping behind comparator countries in Europe in monitoring and controlling the embodied carbon in construction. If the UK continues to drag its feet on embodied carbon, it will not meet net zero or its carbon budgets. There is significant opportunity for the UK to learn from emerging international best practice on how to introduce whole-life and embodied carbon regulations.\n\n73. Local authorities are mandating WLC assessments of their own accord. Evidence so far shows that the policy is achievable and is working, with few barriers to its introduction. Introducing mandatory WLC assessments for buildings could be an easy way for the Government to dramatically reduce carbon in construction. The industry has repeatedly asked for an ambitious, clear timeframe for when whole-life carbon assessments will become mandatory. This timeline should align with the introduction of the Future Homes Standard, which should itself be brought forward to 2023. This will help bring together efforts to tackle operational and embodied carbon within the same timeframe.\n\n74. We recommend that Ministers immediately assign responsibility to the relevant member of the BEIS Departmental Board to monitor international policy developments in embodied carbon, with a remit to feed observations into the development of UK policy on embodied and whole-life carbon.\n\n75. We recommend that the Government introduce, not later than December 2023, regulations to mandate whole-life carbon assessments for buildings above a gross internal area of 1000m, or which create more than 10 dwellings. This requirement should be established in Building Regulations, and ought to be reflected in the planning system through national planning policy. Local authorities should be encouraged and supported to include this requirement within their Local Plans ahead of the introduction of national planning requirements.\n\n76. The timeline for the Future Homes Standard should be brought forward to December 2023 to align the timeframes for addressing operational and embodied carbon. This will help provide the industry with the confidence it requires to construct low-carbon, energy efficient buildings.\n\n77. We recommend that following the introduction of whole-life carbon assessments, the Government should develop progressively ratcheted carbon targets for the built environment, to match the pathway to net zero set out in periodic carbon budgets. These ratcheting targets should be reported on annually, and progress reports towards achieving these targets should be published annually as part of the Net Zero Strategy indicators.\n\n78. We recommend that a clear timeframe for the introduction of mandatory whole-life carbon assessments and ratcheting targets should be set by Government by the end of this year.\n\n79. In our view, the RICS Professional Statement on whole-life carbon assessments is fit for use and already familiar to UK industry. We recommend that, as soon as possible following promulgation of the planned update of the Statement, the Government should seek to establish the RICS methodology as the UK industry standard for whole-life carbon assessments.\n\n3 Building materials\n\n80. To decarbonise the construction of new buildings, fewer materials need to be used more efficiently, and the carbon content of the construction materials that are used needs to be reduced. The construction industry currently relies principally on brick, concrete, steel, timber, diesel fuel and, increasingly, plastics. Buildings must be fit for purpose, meet the necessary Building Regulations and be safe, so issues relating to structural performance, durability, integrity and safety are essential.\n\n81. Steel and concrete are the predominant building materials in the UK, chosen for their stability, longevity and resilience, yet both are highly energy intensive to create. During our inquiry into Energy Efficiency of Existing Homes, we heard that sustainable building materials were under-utilised in the UK, despite being well established in other major European countries. Sustainable products include insulation made using natural fibres; breathable mineral, clay and lime-based plasters; renders, mortars, and paints; and structural components made predominantly from timber. Natural materials, such as wood, sequester carbon, while lime-based renders, plasters and mortars have lower embodied carbon compared to equivalent cementitious materials due to the lower energy inputs during manufacture. The Alliance for Sustainable Building Products (ASBP) told us that interest in the use of natural materials had grown in the last 18 months, although progress in their use remained stubbornly slow.\n\n82. The Government has stated its commitment to increasing the use of low-carbon materials in construction, including timber. In the Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy, Ministers have committed to exploring a range of policy options that can support this ambition, including improving the transparency of embodied emissions data, product labelling, product standards, and changes to public and private procurement approaches. The Government also said that the National Model Design Code, published in July 2021, had been prepared with consideration of the role which well-designed places will play in reducing embodied carbon and environmental impact.\n\nThe National Model Design Code\n\n83. The National Model Design Code (NMDC) provides guidance on the production of design codes for developments. The Government states that the NMDC encourages the careful selection of materials and construction techniques in improving efficiency and reducing their environmental impact.\n\n84. The emphasis in NMDC is on energy efficiency. It notes that codes may set standards for new developments to meet relating to embodied energy and whole-life carbon to improve the sustainability of the construction, but no supporting detail is provided. The Code twice mentions embodied carbon, which it refers to as “embodied energy”; but the text of the Code offers no explanation of how to assess embodied carbon, what the impact of embodied carbon is or how to mitigate these emissions.\n\n85. Contributors to our inquiry broadly welcomed the Code but found that its content was not ambitious enough to address the climate and nature emergencies and that there were significant challenges to its implementation. A frequent concern was the apparent lack of priority given in the Code to green infrastructure. Green infrastructure refers to a network of multi-functional green space, which supports natural and ecological processes. Examples include parks, playing fields, woodland and green roofs. There was concern that the Code did not take a whole-area approach where the role of green infrastructure could be integrated into the built environment early in the planning process and within spatial plans.\n\n86. Wildlife and Countryside Link argued that designing for enhanced biodiversity should run “as a golden thread” throughout the Code, with the benefits of the integration of nature into development clearly cross-referenced throughout the Code and its supporting guidance.\n\n87. The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers (CIBSE) argued that under the proposed overhaul of the National Planning Policy Framework and the new NMDC, it was unclear how planning at the strategic local authority and regional scale would occur and what guidance and requirements would need to be followed. CIBSE suggested that this could threaten the delivery of zero carbon infrastructure by local authorities.\n\n88. Asked why there was no explanation of ‘embodied energy’ and little priority given to green infrastructure, Minister Hughes said:\n\nGovernment is there to set intentions, direction of travel, to give broad-brush guidance, and then it is for people to interpret locally to ensure that their interpretation and use of that code best suits their local circumstances. Sometimes I think less detail is better because that is less prescriptive and allows for more innovation […] We are seeing some, but not all of the big product manufacturers who are listing embodied carbon elements in the products that they are producing, and so sometimes it is not necessary for the Government to be prescriptive about something.\n\n89. The Minister’s assertion that detailed guidance on embodied carbon in construction was not necessary ran contrary to the majority of evidence we received from the construction industry, which consistently requested that the Government issue a national methodology, recommendations for tools and a requirement to undertake whole-life carbon assessments.\n\nOur view on the National Model Design Code\n\n90. The National Model Design Code represents a good start to the task of improving efficiency and reducing the environmental impact of materials used in construction. Regrettably, in its current form it does not provide the ambition or detailed guidance necessary if it is to make a meaningful contribution to addressing the climate and nature crises which the country faces. The code does not provide the supporting detail which design codes require to set standards related to whole-life carbon. The definition of ‘embodied energy’ it uses is confusing, and it offers no guidance on how to assess embodied carbon or how to mitigate these emissions.\n\n91. We recommend that the Government should change the term embodied energy to embodied carbon in the National Model Design Code and provide a clear definition of embodied carbon and whole-life carbon in the NMDC based on the WLCN, LETI and RIBA definitions. The Government should provide guidance on how to assess embodied carbon by setting a national methodology for whole-life carbon assessments, as we have recommended in Chapter 2 above.\n\nUsing materials more efficiently\n\n92. The carbon footprint of construction materials can be reduced by using materials in a resource efficient matter. LETI, the Embodied Carbon Group and UK Concrete all told us that that buildings often had redundancy in their design which could be reduced. We heard that efficient, simpler configurations of structure and façade can dramatically decrease the embodied carbon of buildings, regardless of material. Witnesses repeatedly stressed that if the Government were to mandate whole-life carbon reporting, and progressive carbon targets for building types, designers would follow by rationalising the design of buildings to conserve carbon.\n\n93. Professor Ramage explained why there were few current incentives to design efficiently:\n\nOne of the issues we have is the labour to design efficiently is far more expensive than the cost of the material when you design inefficiently. This is where Government regulation that has a penalty for inefficient design—that is, larger embodied carbon—will allow any infrastructure to be better designed.\n\n94. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs sought views on how to support greater resource efficiency in construction in its Consultation on the draft Waste Prevention Programme for England: Towards a Resource-Efficient Economy, issued in March 2021. The Department’s draft Programme proposed to:\n\nenable a shift in the design of construction products to encourage greater reuse and use of recycled materials;\n\nconsult on Extended Producer Responsibility, for “certain materials in the construction & demolition sector”, by the end of 2025;\n\nexplore how embodied carbon can be reduced through waste prevention solutions; and\n\nuse the planning process to promote sustainable resource use in new construction—which could include, for example, a preference for reuse and refurbishment of existing building stock or setting embodied carbon targets for new developments.\n\n95. The consultation closed in June 2021: the Government is yet to respond.\n\nConcrete and cement\n\n96. Concrete is a popular building material due to its longevity, fire, rot and flood resistance and low maintenance requirements. Globally, concrete is the second most widely used commodity after water. The UK has around 1,000 concrete production facilities, providing 95 per cent of the UK’s concrete demand.\n\n97. 90 per cent of construction and demolition waste is recovered or recycled to produce materials such as concrete, brick and asphalt, but it is generally downcycled for use as aggregate. The UK leads Europe on the market share of secondary and recycled aggregates, which make up 28 per cent of supply.\n\n98. Cement is one of the key ingredients of concrete: cement production is largely responsible for concrete’s carbon footprint. The Mineral Products Association (MPA) reports that concrete and cement production contribute around 1.5% of the UK’s total annual CO emissions. While some other construction materials (such as steel) have higher carbon footprints per unit mass, the emissions per functional unit and large amounts of cement consumed makes concrete a considerable contributor to CO2 emissions and therefore a key focus for emissions reduction.\n\n99. The construction industry is trying to reduce emissions from the production of concrete through increasing energy efficiency, fuel switching and changing product formulations. The MPA told us that the industry had reduced its carbon emissions by 53 per cent since 1990. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that more recently, the emissions reductions trajectory has been less pronounced, with a 10 per cent reduction in total emissions from the manufacture of cement between 2008 and 2019. In the MPA’s net zero roadmap, carbon capture technology makes up 61 per cent of the sector’s planned direct emissions reductions to 2050.\n\n100. Professor Ramage observed that future emission reductions for concrete might be limited because of the unavoidable CO2 emissions (known as ‘process emissions’) which occur during the chemical reactions necessary to produce a cement binder called clinker. He added that future reductions in energy efficiency per tonne of steel and cement were estimated to be limited to no greater than 24% and 13%, respectively. Reductions in process emissions from concrete will require innovation in cement manufacture: this is already happening in the UK, where some manufacturers are blending different cementitious materials to reduce the need for high-carbon clinker.\n\n101. Chatham House research has highlighted that the use of clinker substitutes will be a significant challenge requiring regulatory and technical changes, as well as material and process innovation, particularly as the supply of certain substitutes is reliant on other industrial processes which are being phased out (in the case of coal) or replaced (steel). There is also a limit to the proportion of clinker substitution that can be used.\n\n102. Chatham House noted that there was scope to increase the availability of traditional clinker substitutes in the short term through regulation. For example, in the Netherlands, the use of clinker substitutes has been facilitated by bans on waste disposal for fly ash, sewage sludge and the disposal of concrete waste in landfills. This has encouraged coal and steel companies to find markets for their waste products as clinker substitutes. Chatham House recommended that regulations regarding waste products could include incentives to screen, test and reprocess fly ash and blast furnace slag from older disposal sites. This could increase the availability of clinker substitutes in the short-term while addressing environmental concerns about these older disposal sites.\n\n103. Other types of lower carbon cement are being developed. Some novel cements are now commercially available, though others are at earlier stages of development. Large-scale uptake has been limited. Elaine Toogood, of UK Concrete, pointed out the need to share knowledge about the commercial availability of low-carbon concrete products more broadly across the construction industry to stimulate demand. A further barrier to the development and use of low-carbon cements is that many of the standards, design codes and testing protocols for cement are based on traditional cement. The British Standards Institute has nevertheless indicated that niche cements under development could undergo rigorous UK-specific validation testing to provide the evidence base needed to approve them for general purpose applications.\n\n104. The Government acknowledges the challenges in the production of low-carbon cement in its Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy and has set itself actions to address these barriers.\n\nAction 4.5 in the Strategy states that the Government will “work with the cement sector to explore options to decarbonise sites in dispersed locations”. As part of this, the construction sector is carrying out demonstrations of a ‘zero carbon fuel mix’ for cement kilns, funded by the BEIS fuel switching programme. Further research, funded by the BEIS Industrial Energy Efficiency Accelerator Programme, is enabling the sector to formulate and demonstrate new low carbon multi-component cements for the UK market;\n\nAction 6.5 states that Government will “support advancements in product innovation”, including support for alternative cements; and\n\nAction 6.1 states Government will “support innovation in fuel switching technologies, including low carbon electricity, hydrogen and biomass.”\n\n105. The UK also co-leads the UN Industrial Deep Decarbonisation Initiative with India. This initiative seeks to stimulate demand for low-carbon industrial materials by working to standardise carbon assessments, establish ambitious public and private sector procurement targets, incentivise investment into low-carbon product development and design industry guidelines. Under the initiative the UK wants to focus on how to use collective public procurement action to enhance the demand for green industrial products.\n\nOur view on concrete and cement\n\n106. We welcome the Government’s investment in the development of low-carbon cements as set out in the Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy. Alongside research and development, more needs to be done to raise awareness of low-carbon cements within the industry and amongst the public, to generate demand and increased investment in these products.\n\n107. The Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy should invest in raising awareness within the industry and amongst the public on the existence and benefits of low-carbon cement and continue to encourage research and development into new low-carbon products.\n\n108. We recommend that the Government investigate possible ways, beyond public procurement, to incentivise the use of low-carbon cement to ensure that these cement alternatives become the product type of choice by 2030. This should include an assessment of the feasibility of restricting the disposal of a range of waste products, so as to facilitate their use as clinker substitutes, as is the case in the Netherlands.\n\nSteel\n\n109. In the UK, 95 per cent of all single-storey industrial buildings and 65 per cent of multi-storey non-residential buildings are framed in steel. In 2019, the steel industry contributed to around 2.7 per cent of annual UK CO emissions. The integrated steel works in Scunthorpe and Port Talbot are the two largest industrial sources of UK carbon emissions. Together, they manufacture 78 per cent of UK-produced steel.\n\n110. In the EAC’s inquiry on Technological Innovations for Climate Change: Green Steel, witnesses highlighted the construction sector provides an opportunity to support the decarbonisation of steel production, describing the sector as “an ideal vehicle to push net zero products through”.\n\n111. Steel is typically produced by heating iron ore, coke and lime in a blast furnace. The chemical reaction of reducing iron ore in the blast furnace leads to process emissions of CO . Most steel produced in the UK and globally is via the blast furnace technique.\n\n112. Steel can also be produced in an electric arc furnace where scrap steel is used as the raw material and the furnace is heated using electricity. This process does not produce process emissions of CO2; therefore, it could be used as a low-carbon way to produce steel that does not require carbon capture. However, electric arc furnaces require large amounts of electrical power and water cooling, and their low-carbon credentials rely on decarbonisation of the electricity grid.\n\n113. There are a variety of ways to reduce emissions from steel production. These include:\n\nswitching to lower carbon fuels as alternatives to coke (for example, hydrogen);\n\nusing carbon capture technologies alongside blast furnace production to sequester emissions from continued coal use;\n\nimproving the energy efficiency of both blast furnace and electric arc furnace steel production processes, and\n\nincreasing the recycling rates of other steel products (for example steel packaging) to increase the availability of scrap metal.\n\n114. The Government’s Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy cites carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) and the use of electric arc furnace as two of the major decarbonisation options for steel production sites. In 2019 the Government released a consultation on the Clean Steel Fund with the aim of identifying barriers to decarbonising the steel sector and the technology options required for clean steel. Responses to the consultation highlighted that one of the main barriers was the high cost of electricity. They also highlighted that the three main decarbonisation technologies (switching to lower carbon fuels such as hydrogen, use of carbon capture technologies and improving energy and material efficiency) all required further development to reduce the financial and technical risks. In the Government’s response to the consultation, it concluded that in the short term, more immediate decarbonisation gains could be made by maximising recycling and reuse capabilities of steel, rather than attempting to fully decarbonise the primary production of steel.\n\nSteel recycling\n\n115. Steel is one of the most recycled materials. In the UK, 94 per cent of steel is recycled when a building is demolished. However, a 2018 OECD study predicted that the proportion of iron and steel produced through recycling would not change before 2060 globally, due to growth in overall demand for metals and growth in the amount of scrap metal available.\n\n116. During the Committee’s inquiry into Technological Innovations for Climate Change: Green Steel, whilst the ability of recycled steel to meet future global demand was contested, written submissions generally agreed that there is room for the UK to make further use of its domestic scrap. Scrap steel recycling uses electricity and decarbonisation of the electricity grid gives the potential for a virtually net zero steel recycling process. The UK produces 11.3 million tonnes of scrap steel a year. Of this, 2.6 Mt is used in in domestic steel making, while the rest is exported. In oral evidence, Professor Barbara Rossi argued:\n\nWe are generating in the UK every year about 10 million tonnes of scrap and studies show that this is likely to increase to 20 million tonnes within the next decade. That is due to the fact that in the 1970s there was a boom in the construction sector… in the UK we are seeing that our needs for steel are stabilising at around 10 million tonnes to 12 million tonnes per annum … Studies also show that if we were to electrify all our current activities with what we have today, with the green electricity that we produce, we would possibly be able to get 70% of our steel made.\n\n117. The British Metals Recycling Association told us that the UK exports most of its steel scrap because it does not have the electric arc furnace capacity to use more. British Steel admitted that the UK had been slow to adopt electric arc furnace production.\n\n118. Industry experts have highlighted that the relatively high industrial price of electricity in the UK can deter greater use of scrap recycling. Witnesses also noted that the steel market could be volatile by comparison with the concrete market, while the current low availability in the UK of electric arc furnace-produced steel often resulted in clients choosing European steel manufacturers.\n\nSteel reuse\n\n119. Steel products can be designed for direct reuse. Since steel reuse involves minimal reprocessing, the resulting emissions are far lower than for steel recycling. The concept of ‘Design for Manufacture and Assembly’ promotes the reuse of steel components, by using standardised parts and designing structures that can be dismantled and repurposed.\n\n120. Steel reuse is not yet common practice in the UK. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Infrastructure and Projects Authority are exploring how to increase steel reuse in the construction sector.\n\n121. A principal barrier to greater steel reuse is the collection, storage, testing and certification of used steel components. This was summarised by Dr Joe Jack Williams of Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios:\n\nOne of the key issues of reusing steel […] is the reuse supply chain. Lining up buildings that need those steel beams at the same time is very rarely going to happen, so you need places to store them, which is cost intensive. Also there is warranty in building, so [there is a need to establish] that [a reused] steel member is still a valid steel member for the structural application that it will be used for.\n\n122. Dr Williams stated that performance verification and the insurance market needed to catch up with the ability to reuse steel in construction. Louisa Bowles, of LETI, suggested that storage and a cataloguing process could be made available at local authority level, so that steel could be stored properly, catalogued, checked, and warrantied for reuse. Designers should then be made aware of what materials are available through “local area networks.” Dr Williams saw a role for Government in the insurance and warranty aspects of steel reuse, through underwriting the risk of reused steel.\n\n123. There was consensus amongst witnesses that the most effective way to encourage development and use of low-carbon materials like reused steel, was to set a legal requirement to measure whole-life carbon and introduce progressively more stringent carbon targets on buildings.\n\n124. The Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy commits the Government to “considering the implications of the recommendation of the Climate Change Committee to set targets for ore-based steelmaking to reach near zero emissions by 2035.” In collaboration with the Steel Council, the Government seeks to address this action and consider the business environment necessary to support the transition. The Government has already set up demonstration funding for the £250 million Green Steel Fund which aims to enable the transition to lower carbon iron and steel production through supporting new technologies and processes. In response to the Clean Steel Fund Call for Evidence, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy concluded that the Clean Steel Fund would not be released until 2023, to allow the sector to develop decarbonisation plans and to allow time to align the fund with the Industrial Energy Transformation Fund and Net Zero Hydrogen Fund.\n\nOur view on steel\n\n125. The reuse of steel components is not yet common practice in the UK. One of the main barriers to steel reuse is the collection, storage, testing and certification of used steel components. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Infrastructure and Projects Authority are already investing in how to better promote recycling and reuse of steel, alongside long-term investment in decarbonising the primary production of steel.\n\n126. Mandating whole-life carbon assessments for buildings, as we have already recommended, would be a simple, material neutral way of encouraging the greater reuse and recycling of steel components.\n\n127. The Government should work with local authorities to investigate effective and appropriate ways to store and catalogue steel components for reuse and to communicate the availability of components across local area networks of constructors prepared to reuse steel.\n\n128. We are making further recommendations to Ministers regarding green steel, following up on issues arising from our inquiry into Technological Innovations and Climate Change: Green Steel.\n\nTimber\n\n129. 28 per cent of new build homes in the UK used timber frames in 2016. There are large variations in timber uptake across the component nations of the UK. Timber use in Scotland is high (at 83 per cent in 2016), while its use in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland is comparatively low, at 23 per cent, 31 per cent, and 17 per cent, respectively.\n\n130. The CCC has recommended that the use of timber in UK construction increase to 40 per cent by 2050 and has called on the Government to introduce policy to support this. Timber Development UK told us that in their view neither DLUHC or BEIS had developed or implemented any policies which incentivised the use of low-carbon materials to reduce the embodied carbon impact of construction.\n\n131. While materials need to be appropriately used and selected for their required purpose, many of the academics and architects we heard from recognised that the use of timber (subject to forestry management) in place of concrete, masonry and steel was one of the most successful strategies to reduce embodied carbon. This conclusion is borne out by analysis from the International Energy Agency, which conducted a meta-analysis of over 80, mostly European, case studies of the embodied carbon in individual buildings.\n\n132. Significant obstacles remain and a lack of incentives persists preventing greater uptake of structural timber products. These include issues arising from fire risk and insurance, price volatility, securing sustainable and local supply chains, and addressing skills gaps in the use of timber.\n\nThe Government’s position on timber\n\n133. Both in the Government’s Clean Growth Strategy and its 25 Year Environment Plan the Government has committed to increasing the use of timber in construction. In the England Tree Action Plan, Defra also committed to providing financial support to:\n\ndevelop innovative timber products through the Forestry Innovation Fund;\n\ndevelop a policy roadmap on the use of timber in construction;\n\nincrease public demand for sustainably sourced timber;\n\nwork with Homes England to increase timber use in the delivery of housing programmes; and\n\nencourage research into barriers to the uptake of timber.\n\nDespite these initiatives, contributors to the inquiry consistently told us that there were limited incentives and significant challenges to using timber in construction in the UK, not least in securing consistent quality sources of domestic supply.\n\nChallenges associated with timber use in construction\n\nMaterial safety and fire risk\n\n134. In 2018, as a consequence of the Grenfell Tower fire in June 2017, a ban was introduced on the use of combustible materials in the external walls of residential buildings with a floor above 18 metres. The ban restricts the use of structural timber in a building’s external wall. Several contributors told us that this affected the use of timber in construction, as the ban did not differentiate between external cladding and a building’s structural wall, causing technical specification problems.\n\n135. RIBA said that the implementation of the ban would have a detrimental effect on innovation in structural timber as development and testing might now not be undertaken. RIBA recommended that the ban should not include the building’s primary structure, which is often used to limit carbon emissions. Professor Michael Ramage, representing the Centre for Natural Material Innovation, University of Cambridge, said that the ban threatened to limit timber’s application to residential and low-rise buildings and had already inhibited growth in the engineered timber industry. Sam Liptrott, Director at OFR, a fire and risk consultancy, said that:\n\nThe ban has effectively completely torpedoed any chance of using timber in high rise or medium-rise residential across the country. We have seen multiple schemes—10 or 15 timber residential schemes—that have died as a result of the ban.\n\n136. UKGBC, academics from Sheffield University and RIBA said that the Government must undertake further research into the use of structural timber within external walls to determine and quantify its performance when subjected to real fire loads. Academics from Sheffield University also recommended that existing legislation be examined to identify any unnecessary restrictions on the use of mass timber. Michael Ramage said that research has demonstrated that timber, used as a primary structural material, could provide sufficient fire protection when encapsulated in non-combustible material:\n\nThe combustible materials ban has had a disproportionate effect on timber construction and one government policy is making another government policy, [net zero], untenable. There needs to be a middle ground where we can acknowledge that combustible materials as cladding are a bad idea, but timber as a structural material can be built fire-safe and that should be independent of a combustible material ban on cladding.\n\n137. Will Arnold, Head of Climate Action at the Institution of Structural Engineers, told us that current building regulations did not contemplate the use of modern timber materials, creating further barriers to developers seeking to use timber:\n\n[W]ithin the building regulations and within the codes, the codes that deal with fire in buildings do not account for how timber behaves in fire in buildings. The codes also do not tell you what timber detailing will pass muster from a fire point of view and what will not.\n\nThere is a bit of a gap here. It is filling that gap, either by the development of some kind of framework or standard or something that linked the existing fire codes back to how timber behaves in a fire, and/or standards for details, which is where a lot of the problems come from.\n\n138. In 2020, the Government launched a consultation on proposed amendments to the combustible materials ban, including expanding it to hotels, hostels and boarding houses, and lowering the height threshold of the ban to 11 metres. The consultation closed in May 2020. The Government response is yet to be published.\n\n139. In its 2021 Progress Report to Parliament, the CCC recommended that the Government clarify the position of structural timber in the ban on combustible materials, underpinned by further research where needed to ensure there are no barriers to the safe use of timber in buildings. Michael Ramage recommended that the clarification and amendments were necessary to focus the ban of combustible materials on cladding panels only, so as to make a clear distinction between cladding and primary structure.\n\n140. On the subject of testing and research, Minister Eddie Hughes said that:\n\nLord Goldsmith has convened a committee, across Government Departments and interacting with industry, to look at how we make best use of timber, what the blockers are to it being used and ensure that we work with the sector to develop that testing.\n\nInsurance against timber framed buildings\n\n141. Materials safety perceptions have also affected the availability and cost of insurance for timber framed buildings. Architectural practice HTA Design LLP told us that insurers and asset managers were “either refusing to take over buildings with wooden construction or [were] increasing the insurance premiums.”\n\n142. The evidence we received suggested that the cost of insurance was now playing a decisive role in material and building design choices and that there was a potential reluctance to use timber for construction, even in buildings not directly affected by the ban on combustible materials. Sam Liptrott said that in the last 12 months alone he had worked on “six mass timber office buildings that have flipped from timber to steel and concrete because insurance could not be procured for those buildings.”\n\n143. Minister Hughes told us that Government was aware of the issue and was working with insurance companies to develop a proportionate risk-based approach to timber products.\n\nSustainable and local supply chains\n\n144. In 2020, the UK imported over 80 per cent of the timber it consumed. The UK was the second largest net importer of forest products in 2016 (see Figure 4 below). Most global production of timber has come from North America, Russia, China and Brazil and global production is increasing over time to meet rising demand. The World Bank estimates that global timber demand will quadruple by 2050, which may create challenges for sustainable timber production and lead to greater land tenure disputes and biodiversity loss. The recent sanctions on importing materials from Russia will exacerbate these pressures on supply from remaining timber exporting nations.\n\n145. The CCC has recommended that the Government develops a UK policy roadmap on the use of timber, including policies to support sustainable UK wood supply chains. The CCC has also recommended the strengthening of governance over forest risk commodities, so as to manage land use and deforestation risks. The Environment Act 2021 introduced provisions to make it illegal for large businesses in the UK to use forest risk commodities produced on land illegally occupied or used.\n\nSource: Forest Research (2016)\n\nSkills gaps\n\n146. Structural engineers and construction teams have only recently been trained to design and build with modern timber products. National skills in the management of hardwood forest and forestry wood science are in decline due to increasing levels of imported timber. This is creating skills gaps in the UK construction sector.\n\n147. Sam Liptrott told us that:\n\nThe issue we have with timber is there is a relative paucity of competence when it comes to the ability to design and build in timber. It is not a common building type. There are not very many timber buildings in the UK. We do not have a long history of building in timber in the same way, for example, as in Scandinavia or mainland Europe. That means when it comes to having some form of reliability and trust that the designer and constructors will do the right thing and understand what the right thing is, insurers are—somewhat understandably—a little bit reticent.\n\nWays to support timber in construction\n\n148. Primarily, witnesses and written evidence submissions recommended that the Government support greater research into the safe use of timber products so regulations and bans could be refined, and insurance markets opened. Witnesses who were more confident in the safety aspects of timber recommended policies which directly supported greater use of timber in construction.\n\n149. Recommendations on how to support the timber industry included:\n\nInvestment in greater research and testing: Will Arnold, of the Institution of Structural Engineers, recommended developing an evidence base and running more testing of how timber behaves in fire and how fire risks could be mitigated. He said that current knowledge was not on the same level as that of other materials and knowledge gaps needed to be filled so the blanket ban could be made more specific and nuanced. Sam Liptrott told us that currently the private sector was providing the funds for research, but it was not being matched by Government funding. He said that whilst Government had been investing in research to underpin the next iteration of building regulations, none of this was focused on timber. Minister Hughes agreed that the Government needed to support testing of new timber products and keep up with the pace of innovation in this sector.\n\nMandating whole life carbon assessments: several witnesses recommended the mandating of whole-life carbon assessments, a measure which would give automatic incentives to the construction industry to start choosing lower-carbon materials, leading to greater timber use.\n\nTargets for use of low-carbon material: these targets could either be for specific wood products or general embodied carbon targets for buildings.\n\nPublic procurement: for example mandating use of wood in public buildings. France has mandated that all new public buildings must contain 50% natural materials (timber, hemp, straw). Professor Ramage recommended a similar policy be introduced for UK construction to create the demand volume and predictability needed to stimulate a domestic natural building materials industry in the UK.\n\nOur view on timber in construction\n\n150. Significant obstacles to the uptake of timber products in construction remain. These include issues regarding fire risk and insurance, price volatility, securing sustainable and local supply chains, and addressing skills gaps in the use of timber. The Government has made little progress in addressing these barriers since the Climate Change Committee’s 2019 recommendation for an increase in the use of timber in construction.\n\n151. The post-Grenfell prohibition on the use of combustible materials in external walls has had a disproportionate impact on the use, innovation and testing of structural timber. Material safety perceptions have also affected the availability and cost of insurance, making it near impossible for developers to use timber in high rise or medium-rise buildings. There has been a substantial delay in the Government’s response to its consultation on amendments to the combustible materials ban, which closed in May 2020. This delay is unacceptable: it has left the construction industry without the guidance and confidence it needs to invest in timber structures.\n\n152. Whilst timber is often the most appropriate material to use to lower the embodied carbon of a building project, it cannot be assumed that this will always be the case. Timber use, from appropriate sources, should be verified as the best whole-life carbon answer to a given construction project, in comparison to other alternatives. Timber use should be seen in the context of UK, European and global forestry resources. A major increase in the use of timber in UK construction will put pressure on existing timber resources.\n\n153. The Government must develop a coherent policy, joined up across Departments, to address the need for increased tree planting to address biodiversity and climate change concerns and the need for sustainable commercial plantations using appropriate tree species to meet the demand for domestic timber in construction. Government has committed to developing a policy roadmap on use of timber in construction. This should be delivered by the end of 2022 at the latest: it must comprehensively address the afforestation commitments made in the England Tree Action Plan and the need for timber construction products.\n\n154. In response to this report, Government should set out how its strategies to develop green jobs will address the need for skills in timber use in construction.\n\n155. The Government must invest now in further research and safety testing on the use of structural timber. The outcome of such research must inform a review of all relevant building regulations so as to render them properly applicable to modern timber materials and to ensure that fire safety regulations can take account of how modern timber materials behave in fire. The Government’s response to the consultation on proposed amendments to the combustible materials ban must now include clarification of the Government’s position of structural timber in the ban on combustible materials. The Government’s response to the consultation should be issued at the latest before the House rises for the 2022 summer recess.\n\nEnvironmental Product Declarations\n\n156. Throughout the inquiry we heard that a lack of Environmental Product Declarations for a wide range of materials was limiting developers’ ability to choose low-carbon materials sourced in the UK.\n\nSource: One Click LCA Ltd (2022)\n\n157. Elaine Toogood, of UK Concrete, said EPD data was needed so that designers could input it into whole-life carbon tools at an early stage and make informed decisions on low-carbon design. She recommended that the Government provide incentives to collect this data and publish it transparently, by establishing a requirement in its own procurement practices.\n\n158. Louisa Bowles, of LETI, told us that more companies and suppliers were realising that having an EPD to report their data gave them a competitive advantage. The barrier her firm had encountered was the lack of a centralised national database of EPDs. Designers therefore had to call individual suppliers to seek the information, a time-consuming practice which was beyond the reach of smaller practices with less resource. The data and evidence ought to be collated in an accessible resource which would be free to use. EPD data on European products was more readily available than products and materials sourced in the UK, presenting a challenge to the construction of low-carbon buildings with locally sourced materials.\n\n159. France , Germany and the Netherlands all have Government-funded EPD databases. In the absence of a similar UK Government initiative, Jane Anderson, Board Member, The Alliance for Sustainable Building Products (ASBP), said that RICS was currently developing a national database of generic data and embodied carbon data from EPDs.\n\n160. Dr Jannik Giesekam, of the University of Strathclyde, agreed with Louisa Bowles’ analysis concerning the lack of EPDs in the UK:\n\nYou only have a few hundred [EPDs] that were produced in the UK, compared to about 10,000 or so globally. Countries like France have much better data availability than we have in the UK at present, partly because of the requirements that they have had in place for a number of years now. Overcoming that barrier will require some degree of intervention .\n\n161. Dr Giesekam noted that some countries had introduced complementary measures alongside mandating whole-life carbon assessments to address the issue of data availability. Suppliers in France who wish to make an environmental claim about a product must produce an EPD to substantiate it. We heard that these practices were advancing the availability of data to inform carbon assessments of buildings. Some countries have provided subsidies or financial support to smaller manufacturers to enable them to produce EPDs for their materials.\n\nOur view on environmental product declarations\n\n162. There is a lack of Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) data for a wide range of materials, limiting the ability of developers to choose low-carbon materials. The UK is falling behind European counterparts where EPD data is far more widely available, resulting in developers choosing European materials over locally sourced UK products. The lack of EPD data makes conducting whole-life carbon assessments more laborious and expensive than necessary.\n\n163. The Government should encourage development of a centralised national database of EPDs and, through its own procurement practices require the collection and publication of EPDs. The EPD database should be digital, freely available to end users, and user-friendly.\n\n164. To limit ‘greenwashing’, the Government should introduce measures requiring suppliers who wish to make an environmental claim about a construction product to produce an EPD to substantiate it.\n\n165. The Government should conduct a cost-benefit analysis of whether to provide advice or financial support to smaller manufacturers to enable them to produce EPDs for their materials.\n\nOverall conclusions on building materials\n\n166. There is availability of low-carbon and recycled building products to meet current demand, however there are insufficient incentives for product manufacturers to develop new low-carbon materials and for developers and designers to use these products. The Government has invested in initiatives and programmes, set out in the Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy, to encourage the development and use of low-carbon materials. This is welcome; but as there is no requirement to conduct whole-life carbon assessments of building projects, there remain limited incentives to reduce the embodied carbon of building projects and thus develop and use low-carbon materials.\n\n167. In our view, the most effective way overall to encourage resource efficiency and the development and use of low-carbon materials, whether low-carbon concrete, steel, timber, or any other material, is to establish a mandatory requirement to measure whole-life carbon and introduce progressively more stringent carbon targets on buildings.\n\n168. The Government should also issue its response to the consultation on the draft Waste Prevention Programme for England: Towards a Resource-Efficient Economy not later than the date the House rises for the 2022 summer recess. This will be over a year since the consultation closed. Industry and stakeholders require clear direction on future plans for waste prevention and resource efficiency now.\n\n5 Retrofit and reuse of existing buildings\n\n185. The construction, demolition and excavation sector is responsible for 62 per cent of the total waste generated in the UK. It is estimated that 80 per cent of buildings currently standing will still be in use in 2050: if the UK is to meet its net zero goals, the majority of these will require retrofitting to become energy efficient.\n\n186. There is a clear policy imperative to reduce the consumption of resources in the building and construction sector, to reduce waste material arising from demolition and replacement of existing properties, and to prioritise work to reduce emissions attributable to the built environment.\n\n187. The evidence we received consistently recommended that retrofit and reuse be prioritised over new build in order to conserve resources, reduce waste, minimise embodied carbon emissions, and provide a cost-effective solution to delivering on housing demands. For example, Portsmouth City Council decided that when undertaking major refurbishment of Wilmcote House (a high-rise housing estate), after accounting for the cost of demolition, rebuilding, disturbance allowance and rent loss, and the savings on building maintenance, a high quality refurbishment was cheaper over a 30-year-plan than demolition and replacement. The Chartered Institute of Buildings (CIOB) noted that even when using lower carbon materials to construct new building, this approach was less effective at conserving energy than reusing or repurposing existing buildings. Green Alliance, citing research they had commissioned, claimed that long term vacant properties could fulfil between 14 and 46 per cent of new housing needs to 2030 across different metropolitan areas.\n\n188. Pressure on local authorities to meet social housing need whilst having limited access to grant funding, creates a complex environment in which to balance retrofit, demolition and the need for new low-carbon buildings, and can sometimes lead to demolition being prioritised over retrofit.\n\nGovernment policy on reuse and retrofit\n\n189. In its submission to this inquiry the Government stated that it understood the importance of properly accounting for carbon, “which is why we are promoting the benefits of reusing and retrofitting ahead of demolition.” The Departments of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and of Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said that both departments were allocating funding across several existing government schemes to support reuse and retrofit, including:\n\na) the Local Authority Decarbonisation (LAD) Scheme, which aims to support the ambition set out in the Clean Growth Strategy, that as many social homes as possible are improved to Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) band C by 2035;\n\nb) the Home Upgrade Grant (HUG), which aims to provide energy efficiency upgrades and low-carbon heating to low-income households living off the gas grid in the worst performing homes in England;\n\nc) the Social Housing Development Fund, which aims to improve the energy performance of social rented homes. Wave 1 involves up to £160 million being made available to registered Providers (RPs) of Social Housing, including Private and Local Authority (LA) providers in England to support the installation of energy performance measures in social homes by 31st January 2023 taking a “worst first, fabric first, lowest regrets approach”; and\n\nd) the new Energy Company Obligation (ECO) scheme, which will require larger energy suppliers to install energy efficiency and heating measures to people’s homes across Great Britain.\n\n190. Evidence we received nevertheless disputed the Government’s assertion that it was prioritising retrofit ahead of demolition, citing reforms to permitted development rights which allow for the demolition of properties without planning permission, and inequity in the liability for value added tax (VAT) incurred by new-build and retrofitting solutions. The latter complaint was addressed in part by a change to the VAT regime for energy saving materials announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Spring Statement in March 2022, an announcement made after the evidence to this inquiry had been gathered.\n\nPermitted development rights\n\n191. Permitted development rights (PDRs) allow the improvement or extension of homes “without the need to apply for planning permission, where that would be out of proportion with the impact of the works carried out”. Developments benefitting from PDRs are still required to comply with Building Regulations.\n\n192. In June 2020, PDRs were extended so that a proposal to demolish and rebuild a vacant and redundant residential or commercial building would not require planning consent if the demolished building was to be replaced by a residential property.\n\n193. RIBA told us that the extension of PDRs meant that local authorities now had less control over many changes to the built environment in the areas under their planning jurisdiction. An independent review undertaken for the Government in 2020 concluded that permitted development conversions “seem[ed] to create worse quality residential environments than planning permission conversions”. The properties it assessed which had been constructed under the revised PDRs were found to be significantly below the nationally described space standards, with implications for overheating, amenity space and natural light.\n\n194. Several submissions criticised the changes to PDRs as running counter to environmental commitments, as the changes were perceived to encourage demolition and rebuild over retrofitting. The written evidence we received presented a broad consensus that retrofit and reuse of existing properties was substantially more effective at conserving carbon than demolition and new build, even when the new construction used lower carbon materials.\n\n195. The UK Green Building Council (UKGBC) called the reforms a “highly retrograde step” that should be withdrawn, In UKGBC’s view, PDRs should be restricted (for example, to small-scale, low-impact development that is unlikely to be contentious), and the regime should be reformed to include much stronger sustainability requirements, such as securing higher energy efficiency, air quality standards and access to green spaces.\n\n196. Rhian Williams, Principal Strategic Planner for the Greater London Authority, told us that PDRs involving conversion of buildings from commercial to residential with demolition and rebuild was not something that the Mayor of London supported:\n\n[C]ommercial to residential [conversion] …. often results in poor quality accommodation, affecting the health of high streets and London’s economic success. It is a way of missing out on lots of our important policies. It reduces contributions for affordable housing and other important infrastructure … . [and] it means that we cannot apply those environmental and sustainability qualities […], so it is an issue.\n\n197. The Institution of Structural Engineers and academics from the University of Sheffield said PDRs should not be allowed where properties were to be replaced with housing, as this only incentivised demolition. Dr Asif Din, Sustainability Director at Perkins & Will, a global design practice proposed that buildings ought to be demonstrably unfit for purpose before demolition could be authorised. The Heritage Alliance believed that demolition should remain fully within the ambit of the planning permission process, so that environmental and sustainability factors could be assessed with rigour.\n\nThe Government’s position on permitted development rights\n\n198. The Government told us that PDRs “make an important contribution to housing delivery while making best use of existing buildings and avoid building on greenfield land.” The Government said that reforms to PDR to allow for greater demolition came with requirements on the developer to provide the local planning authority with a report for the management of the construction of the development, including the proposed use of materials, and the plans for the disposal and recycling of waste generated by the development.\n\n199. The planning system in England is under comprehensive review: a Planning White Paper was published in August 2020 , together with a consultation paper on reforms to the current planning system , and the Levelling Up White Paper of February 2022 also has significant implications for planning policy. In written evidence to the Committee, the Government undertook to ensure that “the reformed planning system supports our efforts to combat climate change and help bring greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.”\n\n200. When we asked Ministers about the potential of PDRs to incentivise demolishing buildings over retrofitting, Minister Hughes contested the point:\n\nLargely, [demolition rather than retrofit] is not what is happening [… .] I have seen lots and lots of examples of the conversion from commercial to residential and that seems like an appropriate use [… .I]n some circumstances there are unintended consequences with people taking the type of action that you are explaining. I am not altogether sure that it is of a significant enough nature at the mome"
