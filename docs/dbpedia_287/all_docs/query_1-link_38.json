Individuals who believe a vehicle has been parked in the same location on-street for a period of more than 72-hours may call the Alexandria Police Department to report the vehicle. Enforcement officers respond by placing a check-notice on the vehicle. Enforcement returns after a period of 72-hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. If a vehicle has not been moved, the vehicle is subject to enforcement.\n\nResidents may apply for temporary exemptions to the rule. A temporary exemption may last up to 14 days. Residents must park within 1/8 mile of their homes, and all on-street restriction signage is still applicable.\n\nApply for an exemption\n\nFor more information, please see:\n\nCity Code Section 10-4-8: Parking for more than 72 Continuous Hours\n\n72-Hour Rule Review"
