        "text": "Radiation Protection Activity\n\nDuring the Cold War, the threat of a nuclear war caused many people to build fallout shelters. Fallout shelters were designed to protect people from radioactive dirt and debris that can fall out of the air following a nuclear detonation. While fallout shelters are no longer commonly built, the basic principle remains the same: during a radiological emergency, concrete walls act as a protective barrier between you and radiation outside. This activity is intended for middle and high school students.\n\nOn this page:\n\nObjectives\n\nNext Generation Science Standards\n\nMaterials and Resources\n\nTime\n\nDirections\n\nCommon Core State Standards\n\nPrintable Worksheets and Classroom Aids\n\nObjectives\n\nStudents will:\n\nTour a fallout shelter or research information about fallout shelters.\n\nExamine the concepts of buildings as shielding and shelter in place.\n\nNext Generation Science Standards\n\nThe concepts in this activity can be used to support the following science standards:\n\nPS4. Waves and Electromagnetic Radiation\n\nMaterials and Resources\n\nEach italicized document title can be found at the bottom of this page, and is available for printing and distribution.\n\nRadiation Protection: Teacher Background Information\n\nVocabulary Materials\n\nEmergency Planning and Preparedness Quiz (one per student, pair or group) and teacher answer key\n\nFallout shelter; determine if there is a fallout shelter location in your school or community\n\nFallout Shelters Worksheet (one per student, pair or group) and Fallout Shelters Teacher Answer Key\n\nBuildings as Shielding image (one per student, pair or group)\n\nStudent computers with Internet access to: (optional)\n\nReady.gov\n\nProtecting Yourself from Radiation\n\nA copy of your school’s emergency response plan (optional)\n\nTime\n\n45-60 minutes, not including optional activities or extensions.\n\nVocabulary\n\nDose\n\nIonizing radiation\n\nRadiation\n\nRadiation exposure\n\nRadiation protection\n\nDirections\n\nStart with a vocabulary activity if students are not familiar with radiation and the terms used in this activity, or provide students with the terms and definitions.\n\nAsk students to hypothesize what they might do in the event of an airborne radiation incident. Explain that these events are rare, but might occur, for example, in the event of a traffic accident if a tractor trailer is carrying materials that may pose a risk, a natural disaster (such as Japan’s Fukushima nuclear power plant incident or other historical nuclear power plant incidents), or a terrorist attack. Student answers will vary, but may include going to a basement or other shelter for protection.\n\nDistribute the Emergency Planning and Preparedness Quiz if using it as a pre-test. Have students complete the quiz. NOTE: the quiz can be used as a pre- and/or post-test based on your preference. Review the correct answers after students have completed the post-test. If using the quiz as a learning tool only, let students know the quiz is meant to be a fun way to determine what students know and learn and will not be graded.\n\nExplain that the United States and Soviet Union were in a race to develop atomic weapons between 1947 and 1991. This period was known as the Cold War. Many people were fearful of a nuclear attack and many fallout shelters were built during this time. These shelters were designed to protect people from the nuclear fallout should a nuclear explosion occur.\n\nAsk students:\n\nWhat is nuclear fallout? Particles of radioactive debris that fall from the atmosphere following a nuclear explosion. Exposure to gamma radiation is a primary concern because gamma radiation can pass through many kinds of materials, including our bodies.\n\nHow does a fallout shelter serve as a form of radiation protection? It serves as shielding.\n\nTour or research a fallout shelter. Students may visit a designated fallout shelter location within your school or community or research the Greenbrier Bunker (also known as Project Greek Island. The Atomic Heritage Foundationmaintains information about the bunker which may be useful to students.\n\nProvide students with a copy of the Fallout Shelters Worksheet. Have them answer questions 1–5 while touring or researching a fallout shelter. Review their responses as a class. Internet resources may include the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), among other resources found online.\n\nProvide students with a copy of the Buildings as Shielding image. Have students examine the radiation dose reduction factors within the two images, answer questions 6 and 7 on the Fallout Shelters Worksheet, and discuss and compare their responses.\n\nAsks students:\n\nWhy do the third floors of the 5-story building and office/apartment building offer more protection than the first and second floors? Because when the radiation falls and settles on the ground, the first and second floors are closer to the radiation source. Therefore, the third floor offers more shielding.\n\nWhy are we not able to completely avoid exposure to radiation? Gamma radiation can pass through many kinds of materials. Additionally, it is very difficult to completely seal off a building to avoid exposure. Radiation may enter through doors, windows, ventilation systems and other cracks or openings.\n\nDistribute the Emergency Planning and Preparedness Quiz if using it as a post-test. Have students complete the quiz and review the correct answers.\n\nOptional extension: Direct students to:\n\nDevelop a plan with their family in the event of an airborne radiation incident when advised to remain indoors. Resources may include:\n\nReady.gov\n\nProtecting Yourself from Radiation\n\nReview your school’s emergency response plan to determine where students should go in the event of a radiation emergency.\n\nCommon Core State Standards (CCSS)\n\nThe concepts in the Buildings as Shielding activity align with the following:\n\nCCSS English Language Arts Standards for Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science, & Technical Subjects\n\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.SL.6-12.1 Comprehension and Collaboration\n\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.SL.6-8.2 Comprehension and Collaboration\n\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RST.6-12.4 Craft and Structure\n\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.WHST.6-12.9 Research to Build and Present Knowledge\n\nCCSS Mathematics Standards:\n\nCCSS.MATH.PRACTICE.MP2\n\nCCSS.MATH.CONTENT.6.RP.A.3\n\nCCSS.MATH.CONTENT.7.SP.A.1\n\nCCSS.MATH.CONTENT.HSN.Q.A.1\n\nPrintable Worksheets and Classroom Aids\n\nEmergency Planning and Preparedness Quiz (one per student, pair or group) and Fallout Shelters: Teacher Answer Key.
