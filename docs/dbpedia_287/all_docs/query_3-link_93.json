        "text": "1920 Seattle's Hotel.\n\nIn 1922, plans for financing the hotel were formulated by a group of about 400 prominent citizens known as the “Community Hotel Corporation.” A bond drive was organized so that anyone could take part by investing in the venture. Public response to the proposal was tremendous and Seattleites purchased $100 bonds and raised $2.7 million dollars for the hotel. The Seattle Times held a contest with a $50 prize to whoever submitted the best name for the hotel, chosen by the board of the Community Hotel Corporation. 3,906 entries were submitted and one name, submitted in several variations, pleased the committee the most. They settled on The Olympic, for which 11 entries had been submitted and the first submitted won the prize. The hotel officially opened its doors on December 6, 1924 with a grand opening gala that had all of Seattle talking. Lights illuminated the exterior walls and two large spotlights on the hotel roof swept the sky. A one night stay with bath would have cost about $3.50.\n\nThe year 1960 saw another Presidential campaign, along with visits to the hotel by both Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy. But neither vice president nor the senator from Massachusetts could compare to Crown Prince Akihito and Crown Princess Michiko of Japan, who toured the United States to commemorate the centennial of the first trade and friendship treaty between the two countries. The Imperial Highnesses arrived in Seattle on October 4, 1960 and thousands turned out to witness a rare visit by Japanese royalty. Throughout 1961, most people were preoccupied with construction going on just north of downtown, especially the Space Needle towering above it all. Businesses throughout the city started getting ready for the millions of visitors expected for the upcoming World’s Fair. The Seattle’s World’s Fair—known as Century 21—opened on April 21, 1962. Only a few weeks after the fair opened, The Olympic Hotel was bursting with celebrities, such as a visit from President John F. Kennedy celebrating the Senator Warren Magnuson’s 25th year in Congress. In 1968, one of the largest campaign crowds gathered in University Plaza to see Presidential nominee Richard Nixon. More than 5,000 people jammed the street to hear the candidate talk from a speaker’s platform set up in front of the entrance.\n\nAs the 1970s began, The Olympic continued to host royalty and was officially placed on the National Register of Historic Places and preparations soon began for the closure of the hotel for a major restoration project.\n\nBefore The Olympic was closed for remodeling, the front desk was inundated with calls from people who wanted old room keys. Charity groups were given keys for fundraising purposes, but those who wanted to own part of the hotel’s past had plenty of opportunity. On October 16, 1980, quite possibly the largest estate sale in Seattle history opened for business as the hotel sold off just about everything. Even the doors to the guest rooms were up for grabs. Within weeks, the building was picked clean, except for the original 1920s chandeliers in the lobby. After a $62.5 million entire restoration, The Olympic re-opened for business on Sunday, May 23, 1982 and continues to define the epicenter of the city."
