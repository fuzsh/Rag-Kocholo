Today, we are pleased to announce the successful completion of this acquisition. SonicWALL is now Dell SonicWALL.\n\nThis acquisition holds incredible promise for our customers as it opens up new opportunities for rapid growth of the company and advancement of our solutions. You should expect us to become even more visible and we hope you’ll see us in many more articles like this Next-Generation Firewall Comparison test from Network World in which SuperMassive outperformed devices from Check Point, Fortinet and Barracuda Networks.\n\nOver the past three years, Dell has taken significant steps to develop its software and services portfolio to help customers keep up with demands like cloud computing, consumerization of the enterprise and the increasing demands for secure, anytime-anywhere access to applications and data. Dell is committed to investing in the future of Dell SonicWALL’s product lines. As a result, you will continue to see new and leading-edge Network Security and Data Protection solutions from Dell SonicWALL and our expanded infrastructure will deliver even greater support for our customers. With all of our employees remaining at the company, the way you do business with Dell SonicWALL will be no different from what you are accustomed to.\n\nWe truly appreciate the trust you have placed in SonicWALL over the years and look forward to continue providing you with the highest-quality network security and data protection solutions available. Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact your local Dell SonicWALL representative.\n\nThe part that kills me is the “Business as usual, only better.” It makes me chuckle everytime I read it. It reminds me of this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUvu-9yDnUE (not a rick-roll).\n\n@Dell_Technologies\n\nReviving an old thread, because I just found this group and this post about Dell taking over Sonicwall is pinned… Sonicwall has changed hands again and is no longer under Dell’s umbrella.\n\nFrom: A Message from Bill Conner <A_Message_from_Bill_Conner@SonicWall.com> Sent: Tuesday, November 8, 2016 9:11 AM Subject: A message from our CEO SonicWall Bill Conner President & CEO, SonicWall Dear valued SonicWall customer: We have some big news to share and I want you, our valued customers, to hear it directly from me. As you may be aware, Francisco Partners and Elliot Management entered into an agreement this past June with Dell to acquire SonicWALL along with other entities in the Dell Software Group. As of today, this transaction has been completed and SonicWall has announced that we have launched independent operations. SonicWall’s 4+ year relationship with Dell has been highly productive and will continue. There are however, certain aspects of being part of a very large organization that no longer require our attention or resource, and this is good for everyone who relies on SonicWall. We’re once again solely focused on delivering to you the best possible network security solutions through our highly skilled network of resellers and intend to do so at an accelerated rate. We know that strong security is central to your organization’s ability to make progress. We know you need to be certain that you’re safe from advanced security threats without imposing a lot of complexity. And, we know that you need a partner whom you can rely on, one who continually evolves their technology to stay ahead of cyber criminals. For the past 25 years, SonicWall has done just that, and we intend to push even more aggressively to defeat these advanced threats. In fact, SonicWall recently released one of the most advanced tools on the market, the cloud-based Capture Advanced Threat Protection service to stop zero-day attacks in their tracks along with several other advancements across our lineup. In the coming years, we will continue to serve organizations of all sizes as well as large distributed organizations most notably in campus education, retail, healthcare, financial and government institutions. We will also continue our tradition of teaming exclusively with channel partners to specify and deploy the best network security, remote access security and e-mail security solutions for each customer. Lastly, I’m honored to tell you that I have been asked to serve as President and CEO of the new SonicWall. I’ve spent the bulk of my career in the cybersecurity industry, most recently as CEO of Silent Circle and previously as CEO of Entrust, President of Data Networks and President of Enterprise Networks at Nortel Networks. In this new capacity, I want you to know that I’ll be driving our progress in four specific areas: leadership in next-generation firewall features; cloud-based GMS UI, UX and API capabilities; next-generation SonicOS and hardware platforms; growth in our core market segments. I invite you to follow our progress through my blog. We truly appreciate the trust you place in SonicWall and look forward to continue serving you with the strongest and most reliable security solutions today and for years to come. Regards, Bill Conner President and CEO PS: Should you have any questions or require more information, please do not hesitate to contact us at customervoice@sonicwall.com."
