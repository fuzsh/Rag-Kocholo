I attempted to import the CRL list, but get the following error: CRL Error - Verification failed using CA certificate. No further errors appear in the logs. Without the CRL list the certificate won't verify and it doesn't appear under the \"Administration\" page so I can select it for use via HTTPS.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nEdit: From Sonicwall when I attempt to use my HTTP published list:"
