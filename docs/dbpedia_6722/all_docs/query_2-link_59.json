        "text": "High-Performance Network Security\n\nProtect against advanced threats and exploits in real-time\n\nBlock evasive intrusions and attacks hiding in encrypted traffic\n\nMonitor and control of application traffic\n\nCentralize security management, analytics and reporting\n\nThwart command and control communications and data exfiltration\n\nScale your security for data center modernization\n\nScale your security for data center modernization To enable the growing digital business, expectations for IT organizations to lead and deliver value, responsiveness and security has reached an all-time high. Innovative services plus increased data and capacity requirements compel IT leaders to address new operational challenges through data center modernization. SonicWall provides a network-based model for scaling network security to solve complex and demanding data center operations - all at a low cost.\n\nStop advanced threats with network security segments\n\nModern threats take advantage of all areas of your network to succeed. In order to stop advanced attacks, networks need to be divided into security segments to contain and mitigate threat propagation. However, defining logical segments is only part of the solution. Effective segmentation requires an integrated, dynamic network security approach to comprehensively enforce the integrity of each and every segment, and do so manageably and affordably.\n\nAdvanced Gateway Security Suite (AGSS)\n\nLeverage SonicWall Advanced Gateway Security Suite (AGSS) to deliver a multi-engine sandbox, powerful anti‐virus, anti‐spyware, intrusion prevention, content filtering, as well as application intelligence and control services. An upgrade over CGSS, this package features Capture Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), a multi-engine sandbox that runs and inspects suspicious files, programs and code in an isolated cloud-based environment.\n\nComprehensive Gateway Security Suite (CGSS)\n\nGet the most from your deep packet inspection firewall with the SonicWall Comprehensive Security Suite (CGSS) subscription. CGSS includes gateway anti-virus, anti-spyware, intrusion prevention, application intelligence and control service, content/URL filtering and 24x7 support. Combine security, productivity and support in a single, bundled solution that lowers TCO.\n\nGateway Security Services\n\nEnable your business firewall to provide real-time network threat prevention with SonicWall gateway anti-virus, anti-spyware, intrusion prevention and application intelligence and control. Block the latest blended threats — including viruses, spyware, worms, Trojans, software vulnerabilities and other malicious code. Guarantee bandwidth prioritization and ensure maximum network security and productivity with granular policies for both groups and users.\n\nCapture Advanced Threat Protection\n\nThe cloud-based SonicWall Capture Advanced Threat Protection Service scans a broad range of files to detect advanced threats, analyzes them in a multi-engine sandbox, blocks them prior to a security verdict, and rapidly deploys remediation signatures. The result is higher security effectiveness, faster response times and a lower total cost of ownership.\n\nContent Filtering Services\n\nGain a cost-effective, easy-to-manage way to enforce protection and productivity policies, and block inappropriate, unproductive and dangerous web content in educational, business or government environments. SonicWall Content Filtering Service lets you control access to websites based on rating, IP address, URL and more. You get the ideal combination of control and flexibility to ensure the highest levels of protection and productivity, which you can configure and control from your network security appliance, eliminating the need for a costly, dedicated filtering solution. Extend enforcement of your internal policies to devices located outside the firewall perimeter by blocking unwanted internet content with the content filtering client.\n\nContent Filtering Client\n\nExtend the enforcement of web policies in IT-issued devices outside the network perimeter. Although it doesn’t require a firewall, it can be optionally coupled with SonicWall Content Filtering Service as an ideal combination to keep students and employees off of dangerous or non-productive websites by switching to cloud-enforced policies even when they are using roaming devices.\n\nSupport Services\n\nBenefit from advanced technical assistance and ongoing software and firmware updates with SonicWall Dynamic Support. The service includes:\n\nTelephone and web-based support 24x7\n\nDirect access to highly-trained senior support engineers\n\nAdvance exchange hardware replacement in the event of a failure\n\nAccess to electronic support tools\n\nTotalSecure Hardware & Services Bundle\n\nEnjoy the convenience and affordability of deploying your firewall as a SonicWall TotalSecure solution. This combines the hardware and services needed for comprehensive network protection from viruses, spyware, worms, Trojans, key loggers and more — without the complexity of building your own security package.\n\nComprehensive Anti-Spam Service\n\nBlock threats from your email server and stop spam at the gateway by adding SonicWall Comprehensive Anti-Spam Service (CASS) to your SonicWall firewall. Rapidly deploy your spam firewall software with one-click activation of up to 250 users.\n\nEnforced Client Anti-Virus and Anti-Spyware Software\n\nExecute an innovative, multi-layered, anti-virus internet security strategy with SonicWall firewalls and Enforced Client Anti-Virus and Anti-Spyware software. You get SonicWall Reassembly-Free Deep Packet Inspection anti-malware at the gateway, and enforced anti-virus protection at the endpoints. You can redirect any user with a non-compliant endpoint to a web page to install the latest Enforced Client Anti-Virus and Anti-Spyware software. Provide automatically updated security definitions to the endpoint as soon as they become available. Plus, you can automate enforcement to minimize administrative overhead."
