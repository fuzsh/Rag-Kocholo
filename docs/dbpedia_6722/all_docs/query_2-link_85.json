        "text": "Globalization Partners helped SonicWall succeed and grow internationally.\n\nSonicWall has seen a number of organizational changes throughout its 30-year history, from its early days as an innovator in SMB network security to its decade as a public company, its five years as a part of Dell and the past five years of private ownership following divestiture.\n\nWhen the time came following the Dell divestiture to set up new systems and processes to manage employees scattered throughout Europe and Asia, there was only one obvious answer: use Globalization Partners’ global employment platform.\n\n“We had a few countries under Globalization Partners when we split from Dell, but the larger balance was with another provider. However, Globalization Partners quickly proved to be our go-to partner because of their commitment to service, attention to detail, investments in technology, and excellent communication. As time went on, we eventually standardized around Globalization Partners and have never looked back,” said Bryce Ashcraft, Vice President of Global Human Resources at SonicWall.\n\nDownload the case study to find out:\n\n– How Globalization Partners can act as an expert advisor to organizations going through change.\n\n– Why selecting a global employment platform with a wholly owned infrastructure can prevent costly mistakes.\n\n– How Globalization Partners helps companies retain and hire top talent anywhere in the world."
