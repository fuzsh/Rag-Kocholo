It currently has more than 300,000 customers.\n\nDell said it “looks forward to welcoming SonicWALL’s approximately 950 employees to the Dell team,” and plans continued investments to grow its business.\n\nThe transaction was approved by the board of directors of each company. Additional terms of the transaction were not disclosed. The transaction remains subject to customary conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of Dell’s FY13.\n\n“We are building a strategic software portfolio to address the needs of our customers with key assets in the fast-growing and highly profitable IT security solutions business. Our customers see security as a key IT concern for the foreseeable future,” John Swainson, president, Dell Software Group, said in the announcement.. “SonicWALL gives Dell access to unique intellectual property resources and technology that position us well in fast growing parts of the software security business.”"
