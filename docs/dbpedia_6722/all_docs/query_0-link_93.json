        "text": "Flag\n\nVisionary Leader\n\nIn his three decades of leadership, Bill Conner has re-engineered product lines, built world-class service organizations, re-aligned global sales organizations, and created industry-leading marketing campaigns. As Entrustâs President and CEO, Conner quickly re-engineered the technology-led company to be customer- and market-driven, creating a best-in-class company. Upon taking Entrust private in 2009 with the private equity firm Thoma Bravo, he reset corporate priorities to take advantage of new market dynamics such as SaaS and mobility.\n\nContributing to the strong growth were record customer renewal rates exceeding 98%. In 2013, Entrust was purchased for a record 6.5 times the 2009 investment.\n\nAfter he was appointed President and CEO of Silent Circle, Conner quickly repositioned the consumer privacy company into a mobile Enterprise Privacy Platform (EPP) focused business. This included creating the marketing category, re-engineering the products and the global cloud delivery, and re-building the sales, service and marketing functions.\n\nWhen Comodo Certification Authority was acquired by Francisco Partners in October of 2017, Bill was named Executive Chairman of the Board. The acquisition represented a strong blend of technology, innovation and execution, as SSL certificates became further entrenched in organizationsâ security protocols with the growing security risks associated with the massive growth in online and Internet of Things (IoT) traffic. Connerâs appointment and investment by Francisco Partners supported the companyâs accelerated growth as it focused attention on the CA business, given the significant opportunity in the market. Bill oversaw the companyâs rebrand to Sectigo, and expanded the business to reach a âRule of 70,â with a 3x return on investment.\n\nHeadstone\n\nGuiding Expertise\n\nConner is a staunch supporter of public-private partnerships on cybersecurity, and is regularly called on to share his expertise with global leaders at major financial institutions, enterprises and governments. He served as co-chair of DHSâs first public/private task force on cybersecurity.\n\nOver the years heâs been recognized with numerous awards, including being named a finalist for SC Awards âSecurity Executive of the Yearâ in 2022. Other honors include being awarded SC Mediaâs 2017 Reboot Leadership Award, named as one of the âTop 25 Most Influential Executivesâ for 2017, named to the Top Midmarket IT Vendor Executives for 2017, Marketing Computers âMarketer of the Yearâ, Tech Titans âCorporate CEO of the Yearâ, Federal Computerâs âTop 100 Awardâ, and the âNational Youth Science Camp Alumnus of the Year.â"
