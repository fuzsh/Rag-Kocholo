FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Array Networks to Deliver First Highly-Resilient “Open Sandwich” Layer-3 Scalable Architecture Leveraging Dell SonicWALL Next-Generation Firewalls Design scales to 100 Gbps of deep packet inspection to assure deployment-ready solution for high-volume secure web traffic Milpitas, CA – September 1, 2015 – Array Networks (www.arraynetworks.com) today announced a partnership with Dell (www.dell.com) to promote the industry’s first highly- resilient “open sandwich” Layer-3 architecture for scaling next-generation firewalls (NGFWs). Leveraging the open firewall sandwich design, Dell SonicWALL SuperMassive NGFWs can be horizontally scaled using Array Networks’ APV Series application delivery controllers (ADCs) to overcome the challenges posed by the dramatic increase in secure web-based content and applications. The open-sandwich design scales above 100 Gbps of deep packet inspection (DPI) performance while gaining network simplicity, highest security efficacy and N+1 resiliency. What’s more, the firewall sandwich architecture solves the enterprise’s most complex and demanding data center operations challenges at a considerably lower cost. Array ADCs are high-performance platforms that distribute traffic across multiple Dell SonicWALL NGFW nodes, interfacing to them through a Dell Networking S-Series switch and providing Layer-3 load balancing to ensure the Dell SonicWALL SuperMassive firewalls perform at the highest possible level. The solution ensures persistent throughput for outbound traffic, as well as inbound traffic such as SIP calls that originate from the WAN. The open sandwich concept is designed to support Dell SonicWALL NGFWs in conjunction with almost any third-party switch or load balancer. Dell Networking S-Series switches and Array APV Series ADCs are the first commercial-grade solutions to be tested and deployed in this configuration. “This combined Array/Dell solution offers unique synergies for education institutions, service providers and other businesses with high-volumes of secure web traffic,” said Paul Andersen, Sr. Director of Marketing at Array Networks. “Both Array and Dell are industry leaders in price- performance and innovation in their respective markets. In addition, the joint solution is both tested and proven to give users the assurance of a deployment-ready solution.” “Dell is committed to offering compelling solutions that provide both exceptional levels of security and that are highly scalable to support the massive data, capacity and connectivity demands of our large enterprise customers,” said John Gordineer, Senior Director of Product Marketing for Dell Security. “The open firewall sandwich architecture and our collaboration with\n\n2. Array Networks is yet another example of this commitment to making security a business enabler.” For more information about the open sandwich Layer-3 architecture for scaling next generation firewalls, download the joint Dell and Array Networks Solution Brief.
