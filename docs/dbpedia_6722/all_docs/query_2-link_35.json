        "text": "I have had this happen with 2 different customers lately and haven’t really come up with a solution.\n\nThe user connects to a Sonicwall GVC VPN successfully, but then cannot ping or RDP to their office PC. So they end up calling me and I check it from my home office and with the exact same settings, I can connect fine. We go through the whole process of re-booting everything from their PC to their ISP modem to the office router, and nothing fixes it. Then the next day, having made no changes, it starts working again. I suspect something fishy with the IP routing. On the one I was working on just now, from the remote PC, I can ping the office gateway, but cannot ping the office PC. I had one guy who had both a laptop and a desktop at his house. The laptop was wireless and would work at the same time the wired desktop would not, even though they were on the same subnet. FWIW, I have seen this happen on both ATT and Charter/Spectrum home internet connections.\n\nAnybody else ever run into this? Thanks for any wisdom you may want to send my way.\n\nHmmm. That is strange. I guess two things that I can think of that might be worth a try. First, can the customer be configured to use the SSL VPN and try that instead? That might rule out something specific to the Global VPN.\n\nAnother thing that I would personally look at is the RDP client they are running. That might sound strange, but I’ve encountered different issues with an RDP client, and it turned out there was a bug in a specific version.\n\nAnother thought, although this is unlikely to have an effect, may be to make sure that your client is up-to-date on their BIOS. I have encountered issues with other types of authentication having problems that rely on the TPM recently.\n\nAnyway, there are a few thoughts, maybe something will help.\n\nWell I thought I had this one put to bed, but apparently not. The one remote user from overseas that was having trouble is now working, but the home office for the people that own the CPA firm is still having problems. I went to their house on Friday. They have a desktop and a laptop. The laptop can successfully connect to an rdp host on the office network. The desktop cannot. They are both connected to the same home wifi and same VPN.\n\nI called SW support on Friday and talked to a guy for close to an hour. He did a remote session on the firewall and on the non-functional remote desktop client. He did all sorts of testing, looking at logs, etc. After an hour he basically gave up and said that the firewall was not blocking anything. This morning, I went into their office and changed the IP on the host computer. That didn’t solve anything. I am at a loss for what else to try on this. We ended up getting a Splashtop account so the guy could work from home for now, but he would prefer the old method. If anyone has additional words of wisdom, I am all ears. Thanks!"
