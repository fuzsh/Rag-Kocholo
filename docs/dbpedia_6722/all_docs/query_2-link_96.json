To adjust for growth we decided to implement a 255.255.248 subnet.\n\nUpon changing this in our Sonicwall's LAN interface, our WAN connections quit working normally. We have 2 WAN connections, one used for outgoing traffic and the other for incoming traffic. The second is also setup as the failover for the first.\n\nPinging anything whether inside or outside the network would return handfuls of packets and then deny everything for minutes before returning another handful of packets.\n\nI don't know that it's the WAN ports that were at fault, but they are what show up in the error log.\n\nFor example:\n\nCategory Message Source Destination WAN Availability Probing succeeded on NAT Static IP x.x.x.x, 0, X2 4.2.2.1, 53, X2, a.resolvers.level3.net WAN Availability WLB Resource failed x.x.x.x, 0, X2 WAN Availability WLB Failover in progress x.x.x.x, 0, X2 y.y.y.y, 0, X1 WAN Availability The network connection in use is NAT Static IP y.y.y.y, 0, X1 WAN Availability Probing succeeded on NAT Static IP y.y.y.y, 0, X1 4.2.2.2, 53, X1, b.resolvers.Level3.net WAN Availability Probing succeeded on NAT Static IP y.y.y.y, 0, X1 4.2.2.1, 0, X1, a.resolvers.level3.net WAN Availability WLB Resource failed y.y.y.y, 0, X1 WAN Availability Probing failure on NAT Static IP y.y.y.y, 0, X1 4.2.2.2, 53, X1, b.resolvers.Level3.net WAN Availability Probing failure on NAT Static IP y.y.y.y, 0, X1 4.2.2.1, 0, X1, a.resolvers.level3.net WAN Availability WLB Resource is now available y.y.y.y, 0, X1 WAN Availability Probing failure on NAT Static IP x.x.x.x, 0, X2 4.2.2.1, 53, X2, a.resolvers.level3.net WAN Availability Probing failure on NAT Static IP x.x.x.x, 0, X2 4.2.2.2, 0, X2, b.resolvers.Level3.net WAN Availability WLB Resource is now available x.x.x.x, 0, X2 WAN Availability WLB Failback initiated by preemption due to a more preferred interface being operational y.y.y.y, 0, X1 x.x.x.x, 0, X2\n\nThis all happened in the course of about 20 seconds, and would repeat itself.\n\nWe were told it was a cabling issue when talking with Sonicwall Support, but can't find where we might have double up any of the cabling. I also wonder why we wouldn't have the same problem on the 255.255.255.0 subnet.\n\nIf there was a NIC with two IPs in the same subnet somewhere would that cause what we're seeing?\n\nHelp?"
