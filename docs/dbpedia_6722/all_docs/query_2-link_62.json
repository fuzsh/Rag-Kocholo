The Sonicwall client is stuck on \"connecting\", and the log says \"The peer is not responding to phase1 ISAKMP requests\".\n\nThe weird thing is that this is not an issue with my own PC, only my work laptop (Lenovo W530 running Windows 7 64-bit), and this has only appeared recently. This ought to rule out any problems with my ISP blocking VPN, or issues with the router itself.\n\nMy company's IT department says that they cannot see anything in their logs when I'm trying to connect. My conclusion is that something is wrong on the laptop itself. Disabling the firewall does not help.\n\nCan the VPN connection be blocked in other ways? What should I be looking for?\n\nEDIT: This problem has \"magically\" disappeared, without any changes done in my network. I can only assume that this was caused by some network glitch with my ISP."
