        "text": "1990 – Sreekanth Ravi sells his company, Generation Systems, a manufacturer of graphics expansion cards for the Mac. While preparing to sell the company, he sees a need for creating networking solutions for the Apple Macintosh product line. At the time, the Macintosh’s built-in networking technology, LocalTalk, was limited to 230Kbps and Ethernet expansion cards for the platform were very expensive, starting around $1000.\n\n1991 – Sreekanth and his brother, Sudhakar, found Sonic Systems. The company’s focus is the manufacture and support of Ethernet adapters and related software for Apple’s Macintosh product line of desktop computers and servers. The company’s first product, an Ethernet card for the NuBus and SE expansion slots, ships in late August of that year. The name ‘Sonic Systems’ is meant to convey speed; as they were attempting to move the Apple Macintosh market from LocalTalk to Ethernet the name was deemed appropriate.\n\n1992 – Apple OEMs Sonic System’s software for connecting LocalTalk to Ethernet.\n\n1993 – Sonic Systems expands its product lines to include Macintosh AAUI transceivers, 10/100 Ethernet Bridges, NuBus/PCI Ethernet cards, Appleshare printservers, and 10Mb hubs/switches.\n\n1994 - As Apple begins to incorporate network functionality into their systems, the need for third-party peripherals begins to vanish. Sonic Systems takes its protocol knowledge and starts to focus on external appliances, first developing MicroSCSI, a product that connected legacy Macintosh computers to Ethernet. Sonic Systems also converts its bridge software to hardware for a product it calls the MicroPrint.\n\n1995 - Sonic Systems releases its first Internet appliance product: the QuickStream/3, a three-port multi-protocol remote access server. The engineering effort behind the QuickStream/3 produced an extensible, embedded controller architecture running a real-time operating system (RTOS) that provided the basic building blocks for future network appliance products.\n\n1996 – The company looks into getting a firewall for their Internet connection and is shocked to discover that firewalls – even software ones – cost upwards of US$20K. Sonic Systems has less than 40 employees at this time, and only minimal connectivity needs of the Internet (not that there was much to access at that time). Outraged, Sreekanth asks his brother to look into building an affordable NAT/firewall appliance. Sonic Systems also releases a WWW/FTP/SMTP/DNS software server suite for the Apple Macintosh product line – their last dedicated Apple Macintosh product.\n\n1997 – Sonic Systems releases the Bandit, an Internet access device which delivers high-speed Internet connections at a low cost by aggregating up to three modems to create one virtual connection to the Internet which can be shared by an entire network. In October, they release the Interpol – the first security appliance for small to mid-sized businesses needing a secure, affordable, and easy-to-administer Firewall/NAT solution. The Interpol ships with firmware 1.0.4; all versions of SonicWALL security appliance firmware descend from this version.\n\n1998 – Sonic Systems renames the Interpol appliance to the SonicWALL receiving a letter from the actual Interpol organization asking them to stop using their name.\n\n1999 – Sonic Systems releases the SOHO and PRO appliances. The company later changes name to SonicWALL, Inc. and files to go public in August. SonicWALL moves its offices to the Borregas location in Sunnyvale. Firmware 4.0 is released.\n\n2000 – SonicWALL commences secondary offering in March of 3.5 million shares. Also releases the GEN2 series products – the TELE2, SOHO2, as well as the LB and LB-PCI. SonicWALL also debuts their Global Management System version 1.0 – a Windows-based software packaged designed to manage multiple SonicWALL appliances. SonicWALL purchases Phobos in November for US$268 million.\n\n2001 – SonicWALL releases the SSL-R, SSL-IA, SSL-PCI, and most importantly the GEN3-series appliances – the TELE3 and the SOHO3. SonicWALL purchases Ignyte Technology, SecureCom (John Gmuender’s company), and RedCreek.\n\n2002 – SonicWALL releases the GX 250 and GX 650; these are the first enterprise-level products in the company’s product portfolio. CEO Cosmo Santullo resigns in August. The SOHO TZW is released and runs the hybrid SonicOS Standard 1.0, which was based upon the 6.x codebase and added a next-gen user interface (UI). Deployment issues with the GX-series quickly results in a massive company rethink of what “enterprise” actually means. The Ravi brothers depart from day-to-day operations at SonicWALL.\n\n2003 – The GEN4 era begins! SonicWALL develops SonicOS Standard and SonicOS Enhanced for the new TZ 170, PRO 3060, and PRO 4060-series appliances are released in September running SonicOS 2.0, the first hardware and software to support fully-configurable bidirectional NAT, WAN load-balancing, zone-based policy, and more than three user-configurable interfaces.\n\n2004 – SonicWALL releases the TZ170W, TZ170SP, TZ170SPW, PRO 1260, PRO 2040, PRO 5060, and distributed wireless w/ SonicPoint. SonicOS 2.5 released in August, and then SonicOS 3.0 is released in December with the new UTM engine.\n\n2005 – SonicWALL purchases enKoo and Lasso Logic. SonicOS 3.1 is released to address the issues introduced in 3.0 and adds anti-spyware support. The PRO 4100 is released. In engineering (well, on John Gmuender’s desk) work begins on what will become the GEN5 hardware platform and the multicore version of SonicOS Enhanced. The SSL-VPN 2000 is released.\n\n2006 – SonicWALL purchases MailFrontier. SonicOS 3.5 is released and added support for Virtual Access Points (VAP) and Layer 2 Bridge mode (L2B), which allows a PRO-series device to be dropped into any 10/100/1000 Ethernet link and perform bi-directional scanning for antivirus, antispyware, content filtering, and IDS/IPS. Work on SonicOS 4.0 begins in early winter;\n\n2007 – SonicWALL purchases Aventail. The “Gen4.5” products – the TZ 180, TZ 180W, TZ 190, and TZ 190W – are released in the winter and spring. SonicOS 4.0 is released in August. The biggest news is saved for the end of the year, though, as the first GEN5 appliances are released, the NSA E-5500, NSA E-6500, and NSA E-7500, culminating almost three years of effort across all teams and departments in the company. Upon launch they are three of the world’s most powerful UTM appliances.\n\nTo be continued ...."
