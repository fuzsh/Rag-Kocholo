        "text": "I’m not quite sure this is going to a good thing. In my past experience, Dell has not been too channel friendly and has seemed (to me) to operate better in the direct sale model. I’m sure things are a changing and at the higher levels of Partner Direct, maybe it might be better.\n\nI’ve worked with Sonicwall almost since inception and have participated as a VAR with a number of companies over the years and have had a positive experience. With Dell looking to acquire Sonicwall, I wonder how the smaller SMBs are going to fare given Dell’s direct sale model.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nPretty indifferent right now, we’re a small-med business, and I actually purchased my Sonicwall NSA 240’s through Dell (and renew my subscriptions through them), what I find more interesting when stepping back is looking at Dells overall goals… they acquired Message One a few years back, Kace a few years ago, I believe they recently acquired AppAssure which I didn’t realize (I use Replay through a managed service). I know last year when I was talking to my rep about upcoming projects and managed a new ip phone system, they wanted to handle that as well. I generally buy most of my software through them as well.\n\nThey are seriously trying to move towards being a one house shop for all your technical needs.\n\nI continue to watch this with great interest.\n\nIf I have one beef with Dell its the yearly rotation of sales teams I’ve been getting the last 2-3 years. That’s been annoying. It seems like each year they change their philosphy about how the sales teams should be structured (last year it went from having a structured team to contacting whatever team you want, now its a structured team based on geographic location).\n\nSupport has been great with Sonicwall though I can’t always say the same for Dell.\n\nI literally renewed support agreements for 2 years on our Sonicwall devices just yesterday. Here’s to hoping that I don’t regret that decision.\n\nEdit - +1 on the dislike of the yearly sales team rotation. I understand the need to realign as business changes, but it seems to be too frequent with Dell.\n\nMaybe the scale will change things. I can tell you that buying a Sonicwall from Dell has got to be more expensive than other resellers. In fact, I just ordered an upgrade today from one vendor and they were so much cheaper that any other. I don’t see that happening with Dell.\n\nI wonder what other resellers are going to think. I realize Sonicwall is not a market leader, but they, like Watchguard and others, seem to fill the niche in the SMB arena and I just don’t think that bodes well.\n\nI can’t speak toward the channel partner angle much b/c I haven’t been partnered with a company that Dell took over. I’ve been mostly happy with their VAR partner model given their otherwise direct model.\n\nI’ve been a SecureWorks customer since 2003 and really appreciated the high quality service and customer support. I was a little nervous when Dell acquired them but for what it’s worth everything has been great. We actually went through a contract renewal since then and they didn’t even raise prices (which SecureWorks has done in the past). Mgmt and employees are all intact and running the show pretty much autonomously.\n\nI also know the top engineer at Compellent and he’s been happy about Dell having taken over. Seems like they didn’t shake things up too much there either.\n\nWhat I’m getting at is it seems like they hire good people (or rather take over good companies) and get out of the way. If they continue that trend I’d suspect everything should be just fine if not better. You have to ask yourself why they’re doing this. It’s to add to their security portfolio (and intellectual property). I bet Dell welcomes having a highly successful channel program already built in to it."
