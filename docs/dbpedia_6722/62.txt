Bengaluru: Last year Francisco Partners and Elliott Management acquired Dell software Group and made SonicWall as an independent company. At the same time in November, SonicWall created the SonicWall SecureFirst Partner Program.

The company has surpassed the aggressive financial and operational metrics set across sales, partner engagement and support including shipping its three millionth firewall. This momentum has positioned the company to receive recognition from partners, as per a SonicWall blogpost.

More than 15,000 partners have registered for SecureFirst with 4,000 partners new to SonicWall and more than 10,000 hours of training have been completed through SonicWall University, along with more than 19,000 successful exams, it said. Signing up from 90 countries, the company’s channel ecosystem includes resellers, integrators, managed security service providers and security consultants.

“We have the right management, the right channel partners, the right technology and the right services so businesses can run more effectively and fear less,” said Bill Conner, SonicWall President and CEO.

In March 2017, SonicWall introduced SonicWall University, driven by intelligence gathered from SonicWall’s Capture Labs and threat researchers. SonicWall offers the training and accreditation program that is designed to focus and educate partners on current cybersecurity threats, along with new global marketing programs and incentives to help channel partners reach and protect enterprises around the globe.

Partners are engaging with SonicWall University for training. The university has provided more than 10,000 hours of online training and administered more than 19,000 successful exams. Participants are also completing specializations focused on key areas, such as ransomware, email threats and encrypted threats.

“The active engagement of our partners in our SecureFirst Partner Program and SonicWall University have exceeded our greatest expectations with 50 percent growth in partner deal registration that reflects $250M in new pipeline,” said Steve Pataky, Vice President of Worldwide Sales and Channel. “Since SonicWall became an independent company 100 percent focused on cybersecurity and 100 percent focused on channels, we have moved at a blistering pace to deliver cutting-edge support and education to our partners.”
