Origin, Meaning, And History Of Suman

Originating from the Sanskrit script, the Indian name Suman is a concoction of the Sanskrit prefix su (सु), which means ‘good,’ and manas (मनस्), which means ‘mind.’ As a result, this beautiful name translates to ‘good mind’ or ‘well-disposed.’ Other connotations associated with this moniker include ‘cheerful,’ ‘intelligent,’ ‘wise,’ ‘ingenious,’ ‘good repute,’ ‘favorably disposed,’ ‘happy,’ and ‘pleased’ (1). Furthermore, in H.H. Wilson’s Rig Veda Sanhita, the 1856 English translation of the ancient Indian collection of Vedic Sanskrit hymns, Rigveda, the term suman is referenced and translated as ‘together’ (2).

On another note, this moniker is typically adopted by both males and females, primarily among the Hindu communities. One of the common spelling variations of this name is Sumana. Moreover, the name Suman may also be alternatively transcribed as Sumon in Bengali. Some possible nicknames for this moniker include Sumi, Suma, and Sam.

The name Suman is famously associated with Acharya Surendra Jha, nicknamed Suman Ji. Jha was an established Indian Maithili poet, author, publisher, editor, and elected legislative assembly and Parliament member. He was also a social reformer and a promoter of the Mithila culture. He wrote over 40 books in the Maithili language and received the Sahitya Akademi Award twice, once in 1975 and then in 1995.

In addition, the name Suman is also shared by a river called the Suman Gol—a tributary of the Chuluut River—in Arkhangai province, Mongolia. It is also the Indian localized name of the Arabian jasmine, which is also known by its scientific name, Jasminum sambac.

Suman has made a few appearances in the fictional world. For instance, in Sri Bhaskarabhatla Krishnarao’s fiction novel Yuga Sandhi, Suman is the name of a Maharashtrian girl who is friends with a Muslim girl named Ayesha. Another notable mention is the 2007 fictional graphic novel Suman Crosses the Karnali River by The Engineering is Elementary Team.
