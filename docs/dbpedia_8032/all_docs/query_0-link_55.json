        "text": "Odysseus, stand aside. Amita Suman’s journey from the scorching, remote Nepalese village of Bhedihari to the Lancaster Ballroom at The Savoy is an epic to rival Homer’s. Better: it’s worth a trilogy. Between the clay hut of her birth and today – a successful actress with a starring role in the cult fantasy series Shadow and Bone and an invitation to all the most exclusive parties in town – is an unrelenting fight for freedom. There are treetops and cobras; collapsing cliffs and tiny ‘thingies’ in the purple Nepali sky, which she later learnt were planes. There is a treacherous, thrilling journey to Kathmandu; a new life in Britain – a shy arrivée in the bluster of Brighton; and a battle to master English that develops into a passion for words so strong that now each one slips through her lips like a love letter.\n\nRead More\n\nWhy the Shadow and Bone cast, led by Tatler cover star Amita Suman, is the chicest TV clique of them all\n\nYour guide to who’s who in the series that has attained cult status\n\nNow 25, Suman has a spirit that soars. She is Britain’s riveting rising star – dazzling on Bafta red carpets, at home in Annabel’s – and she feels this triumph deeply. Sitting before me in Hally’s, a laid-back Californian-style café in Parsons Green, she is straight-backed and poised. The location was her choice: after all, she was a Chelsea girl last year, living in Fulham, spending time at The White Horse (affectionately dubbed The Sloaney Pony) and The Prince, watching riverside sunsets and reading poetry in the Bishop Porteous Library at Fulham Palace, before moving to Brixton. She twists a glass of oat-milk latte between her fingers and says it: ‘Someone like me isn’t meant to be living their dream. I really, really am. And I’m not complaining.’\n\nThe signs of Amita’s success are gentle. It’s the softly cut khaki Reiss jumpsuit and black blazer; the exquisite, tumbling lengths of black hair she takes care not to sit on; the Chanel watch on her left wrist (she is now an ambassador for the brand). The way she says ‘I’m in a very fortunate position’ when she talks about her search to buy a house in south-west London, or the WB Yeats anthology poking out of a deep red Aspinal of London bag, given to her by… ‘I shouldn’t say who’. She might have been born royal.\n\nAmita, though, is clearly a girl’s girl. ‘My friends from Brighton live two minutes away,’ she says. ‘I’m around at their house all the time. That’s the only reason why I picked Brixton… and the food!’ Girls’ nights follow a familiar format: ‘We end up laughing at absolutely nothing until we almost run out of oxygen. Then we get the vanilla Häagen-Dazs out and watch movies.’ Chick flicks are favourites (The Proposal is ‘such an iconic movie’) but Amita also loves classics like Pride & Prejudice with Keira Knightley (‘she’s the queen of period drama’) and a little David Lynch.\n\nNights out are spent at pubs and bars in south-west London and Soho, rather than clubs. ‘I love a glass of red wine, I love a good margarita. A picante. A negroni,’ she reels off. ‘But not with prosecco – I just like a good bog-standard negroni. Or Jack Daniel’s neat. I’m sounding so hardcore right now, but I’m really not. That’s only on very rare occasions.’\n\nSo you wouldn’t find her on the sticky dancefloor of Infernos, the Clapham nightclub that’s every It girl’s one-time ironic night out? She shakes her head as if to say ‘no’, and then all that poise cracks into a knowing smile. ‘I mean, it can be fun. We go in there to be really silly and look absolutely bonkers on the dancefloor and not give two shits about anybody else. It’s amazing.’ And if Shakira’s Hips Don’t Lie comes on, it’s game over. ‘We get absolutely into it. You commit yourself 100 per cent and it’s so good.’\n\nAmita’s a perfect sort of friend: a firecracker on the dancefloor and fiercely loyal when the time is right. ‘I’m the one you come to when you just need to have no barriers and speak freely,’ she says. ‘Maybe because I’ve had such a crazy life, it’s forced me to mature a lot quicker than the average person. I hate saying that. But I’ve been through a lot in life.’\n\nFrom on-screen princesses to real-life royals: Tatler celebrates the glamorous actresses – including cover star, Amita Suman – who bring fantasy and fairytale to life\n\nRead More\n\nToday, Amita’s world is so expansive, so serendipitous that she can hardly believe it; but things weren’t always that way. She was born in the summer of 1997 in Bhedihari, southern Nepal – a village of just over 800 households with a population of fewer than 6,000 – and life was hand to mouth. Her parents built the clay house they lived in, which would leak in the monsoon season; they farmed their own food; there was no clean water, no electricity and no school. ‘I remember so much of it, because it was so different,’ she says. ‘We had absolutely nothing.’ Disconnected from the rest of the world, completely unaware that it even existed, Amita used to climb the tallest trees – 30 feet into the sky at five years old – ‘to try and get that one teeny, tiny mango that hadn’t been picked yet’, she says. From the tops of the trees, vast land stretched out ahead. ‘If you looked really, really far into the distance, you could see the mountain haze. I didn’t know what that was,’ she says, childhood wonder flitting like fireflies in her cacao eyes. ‘All I knew was what I could see and what I could touch. The only tales I knew were the magical ones where gods go on different quests.’\n\nGods aside, ‘You had to make your own food, grow your own food, hunt for your own food. If we wanted spinach, I’d be picking it in the field for, like, six hours. And you know how spinach gets when you cook it,’ she says, making a schh sound and clenching her hands. At harvest time, the children weaved hay into rope and made tree swings. ‘They would always break. We’d spend all day swinging and going really high. And one person would always fall. Luckily, no broken bones, because if you broke a bone or got a major injury you would just die. I don’t know how I’m here today.’\n\nSuman speaks about death with striking frankness. It came knocking a good few times, after all. Like the day little Amita turned around to find the village crowded at the entrance of the hut and a cobra by her side ready to attack. ‘Don’t move! Amita, do not move an inch!’ they said. And she froze, terrified of being bitten, but not of dying. Her grandfather, a former champion wrestler, battered it with a stick and saved Amita’s life. Others were not so lucky: the cobra had killed two villagers that week.\n\nRead More\n\nWATCH: Dazzling April cover girl Amita Suman teams up with Shadow and Bone co-star Jessie Mei Li for Tea With Tatler\n\nAs she graces the cover of the April issue, Suman joins forces with her fellow Netflix star to tackle Tatler’s deviously difficult game\n\nBut everything changed the day Amita discovered television. It was during a festival that one of the villagers brought out a minuscule TV and a search began for an electricity source to boot it up. ‘And this black-and-white image appeared,’ she says. ‘I really can’t remember what it was, or what I saw: all I remember is how it made me feel. I thought there was another planet inside this TV. I started touching it and talking to the people. I asked, “Can you hear me? Show me how I can be there with you.” I used to sit with my grandfather for hours and pray to be that person on that TV. It was then I knew what I wanted to do in my life.’\n\nAt seven years old, her chance came to cross the glass and join the other side of that world. Some years earlier, Amita’s father had met an English woman in Nepal. They fell in love, married and relocated to Brighton. Now it was Amita’s turn. In jeans and T-shirts, carrying baby-pink puffer jackets with furry hoods sent from England, Amita and her sister began their odyssey, making their way from Bhedihari to Birgunj by horse and cart, then over the mountains by bus to Kathmandu. ‘It’s like the most dangerous journey you can do,’ she says. ‘It was incredible and really scary. You’re literally driving on cliffs, and sometimes the bus driver would stop and show you all the buses that are falling down. It’s not a real road. I was so excited by this whole thing, I never worried about leaving my home behind. The world was changing right in front of me.’\n\nThe two little girls arrived at Heathrow, gobsmacked, into a freezing cold, soaking wet October, and settled with their father and stepmother in Brighton. ‘The trees didn’t have leaves on them,’ she remembers. ‘It was raining. Getting dark at four o’clock: what is that?’ Everything was new – the sea, school, trains, British manners and mannerisms – and it was her stepmother who led her through it all. ‘She is such a role model in my life,’ says Amita. ‘I love her so much, I really see her as my mum.’ Slowly, her first languages evolved from Bhojpuri and Hindi to English. Now she’s been here for so long, she feels ‘more British than Nepali’ – marked by statements like ‘the Queen dying was one of the biggest tragedies of the 21st century’. Her real mother resettled too, five years later, in Worthing. They remain close.\n\nWhen the opportunity arose to do drama at high school, she grabbed it with both hands and never let go. ‘I felt like such an outsider in this country but I found my self-worth in drama,’ she says. ‘It gave me this freedom and confidence to live life through something else and forget about the person I was. My stepmum always said, “If that’s what you want to do, that’s what you will do.”’ Her dad wasn’t so sure; stability was what he wanted for his daughter, who had been through so much.\n\nBut she was accepted into several drama schools, and once again followed the path of fate. She chose the Academy of Live and Recorded Arts in Wandsworth, and her ascent was rapid. Suman landed one-off roles in Casualty and Doctor Who, and then a recurring role in the fantasy series The Outpost. In 2019, the part of Inej came up in Shadow and Bone, a new series set in the fictional Grishaverse, intertwining two of Leigh Bardugo’s fantasy works: the Shadow and Bone trilogy and The Six of Crows. Both share feverish cult followings. ‘When I saw the fan art, I felt like I was staring into the soul of this person already,’ she says. ‘I had this weird sixth-sense connection with the character. She was written specifically for a brown person. The way it was done was just perfect. And I love fantasy, I love action movies.’\n\nSerendipitously, the part became hers; and suddenly she was trending on Twitter. ‘I will never do it again, but I put my name in the search bar and the response was a big breath of relief. Everyone was relatively happy. It was a big bang of a start into what this world [of fantasy] was going to be like and how much it meant to all of these people. So I felt accepted, but I will never give that power to anyone else. The pressure was insane; I was nervous on set every single day, but it was the best experience of my life.’\n\nHer lifestyle is becoming more gilded by the day. Last month, radiant in a burnt-orange satin slip dress, Amita raised a glass alongside Emma Mackey, Ben Radcliffe and Freddy Carter at Vanity Fair’s glittering Bafta party. In the past year, she has sat next to Luke Thompson at Wimbledon on the VIP invitation of Ralph Lauren; dazzled in a white suit at the BFI London Film Festival Luminous Gala; and turned heads at Comic Con in New York. She has been spotted at Ham Yard Hotel film screenings and the Serpentine Summer Party – and she is a regular on the guest list at Annabel’s (she also loves Aqua Shard and Claridge’s).\n\nAmita is living her own fantasy: is she happy? ‘I am. I really am,’ she says, although last year was ‘a bit of a toughy’ after a break-up with her partner of four years. ‘Professionally, the best; personally, the worst year of my life, learning some big lessons, and still not having any regrets.’\n\nNext up, Amita’s ‘so ready to do something gritty. Something like Monster, with Charlize Theron. Or a Bond movie – it’s so British, and I’ve never seen someone from my background [in one] before.’ Her character would be ‘a great fighter. Quite cunning.’ She’d also like to work with David Lynch. Could it be that Amita’s sights are set on Hollywood? Her eyes sparkle wide. ‘I hope it’s on my cards,’ she says.\n\nOnce upon a time, in the treetops of Bhedihari, Suman looked up to the stars and dreamed. Now she’s a star herself, and she’s about to go supernova.\n\nThis article was originally published in Tatler’s April issue, on sale 2 March."
