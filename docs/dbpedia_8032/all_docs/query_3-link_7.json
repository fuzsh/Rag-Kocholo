        "text": "Longtime fans of the CBS series \"NCIS\" will be thrilled to hear that popular will-they-or-won't-they couple Ziva David and Tony DiNozzo will soon be back on their screens. And now, we know the cast who will be joining them.\n\nParamount+ announced July 15 the full cast of characters who will be starring alongside fan-favorite actors Cote de Pablo and Michael Weatherly.\n\nThe streaming service previously announced May 7 that the show will be appropriately titled \"NCIS: Tony & Ziva.\"\n\n“It makes it really easy because the fans will know exactly what the show is,” de Pablo joked in a video announcing the news.\n\nThe show, which is produced by CBS Studios, has officially started filming in Budapest, Hungary, according to the July 15 release.\n\nParamount+ announced on Feb. 28 that the company has ordered 10 episodes of a spinoff series starring the two characters. Ziva and Tony — frequently referred to by their portmanteau couple name \"Tiva\" by fans — will pick up their story where things left off in the longtime original series.\n\nThe two did end up together, with a daughter named Tali, and moved to Paris. In the new series, according to the release, that's where the spinoff show will begin.\n\nRead on to learn more about the show and its cast, including the actor playing the couple's daughter.\n\nWhat is 'NCIS: Tony & Ziva' about?\n\n\"When Tony’s security company is attacked, they must go on the run across Europe, try to figure out who is after them and maybe even learn to trust each other again so that they can finally have their unconventional happily ever after,\" according to a previous release.\n\nThe show will mark the sixth series in the \"NCIS\" universe; in addition to the original show, there are \"NCIS\" series set in Los Angeles, New Orleans, Hawai'i, and Sydney (though NCIS: Hawai'i was recently canceled.)\n\nIn the Feb. 28 Paramount+ statement, Weatherly and de Pablo said they've been \"talking about this story for many years.\"\n\n\"The world of Tony and Ziva (and daughter Tali) promises to be an action-packed roller coaster fueled by love, danger, tears and laughter,\" the two said in the statement. \"We also want to acknowledge and thank the fans from around the world who supported the ‘TIVA’ movement for years. To this day, they say hello in grocery stores and on the street to tell us how much these characters mean to them and ask what Tony and Ziva are up to now. This is for you!\"\n\nIn the video shared on May 7, de Pablo alluded to an action-packed series.\n\n\"I expect intrigue, romance, the background of Europe, impossible situations that will make our life very complicated but somehow a little something about love,\" she said.\n\nDid Tony and Ziva end up together in 'NCIS'?\n\nIn the original series, which premiered in 2003, Ziva and Tony finally got together in Season 10. The two evidently slept together only for Ziva to decide to stay in Israel as Tony returned to the United States.\n\nNearly two years later, in the Season 13 finale, Tony is informed that Ziva died in an explosion at her Tel Aviv home and left behind a daughter — their daughter — named Tali. He then leaves \"NCIS\" to go raise their child.\n\nEventually, it's discovered that Ziva faked her own death and went into hiding for her and Tali's safety.\n\nIn Season 17, after the threat to Ziva's safety has been solved, Tony and Ziva are believed to have reunited (off-screen) in Paris and planned to raise their child together.\n\nIn the July 15 release, Paramount+ says \"NCIS: Tony & Ziva\" \"picks up after Ziva’s supposed death when Tony left the NCIS team to go raise their daughter.\"\n\nThe two have been raising their daughter together.\n\nWhen will the spinoff premiere?\n\nNo premiere date has been announced at this time.\n\nIn the video shared on May 7, Weatherly said they plan to film the show \"this summer,\" and in the July 15 press release, Paramount+ announced the series had started filming in Budapest.\n\nWho is in the ‘NCIS: Tony & Ziva’ cast?\n\nOn July 15, Paramount+ shared the names of the new series regulars who will join the two stars in a press release.\n\nAccording to Paramount+, the cast is as follows:"
