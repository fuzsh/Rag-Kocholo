        "text": "Dale Carnegie, the guru of public speaking and influencing people, said a person's name is the sweetest word for him in any language. You better remember names, and hope they do not change.\n\nPeople, thankfully, do not change names so much. But companies seem to be changing names all the time. The reasons are different: sometimes a change of business and sometimes a change of ownership. Another one is when a larger unlisted brand merges into a smaller listed company. The smaller company, after merger, changes its name to the more recognisable brand.\n\nLet us look at some of the prominent name changes in 2012. The complete list can be found on the BSE website:\n\nPiramal Healthcare Ltd changed its name to Piramal Enterprises Ltd in September 2012, clearly a reflection of diminishing share of healthcare in its portfolio of businesses after the sale of its main business to Abbott.\n\nAreva T&D Ltd changed to Alstom T&D Ltd in March 2012 after Alstom acquired the business globally. Other similar examples: Aventis Pharma Ltd changing to Sanofi India Ltd and Henkel India Ltd to Jyothi Consumer Products Ltd.\n\nSometimes the acronym becomes the name. Here are some examples: Financial Eyes (India) Ltd changed to FE (India) Ltd in July 2012. Great Offshore Ltd changed to GOL Offshore Ltd – ostensibly to take the word 'Great' out of its name after a split.\n\nSome more prominent names: Future Capital Holdings Ltd changed its name to Capital First Ltd. Kale Consultants Ltd changed to Accelya Kale Solutions Ltd. Monnet Ispat Ltd changed to Monnet Ispat & Energy Ltd – clearly a new business line being reflected in the name.\n\nAnd the quirky changes: India Home Loans Ltd dropped the 's' in 'Loans' to become India Home Loan Ltd in November 2012. Phoenix Mills Ltd added an article to become The Phoenix Mills Ltd in April 2012. Solar Industries India Ltd changed to Solar Industries India Limited – expanding the Ltd to Limited. Yamini Investments Ltd changed to Yamini Investments Company Ltd.\n\ndel.icio.us · digg this · spurl · reddit · furl this"
