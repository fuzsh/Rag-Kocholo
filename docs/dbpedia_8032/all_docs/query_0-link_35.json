        "text": "New Delhi: Shekhar Suman and Adhyayan Suman, who were also part of 'Heeramandi', have commented on Sanjay Leela Bhansali's niece, Sharmin Segal's performance in the Netflix show. Actor Shekhar Suman's son Adhyayan Suman commented on Segal's performance. Sharim Segal has been at the receiving end of criticism ever since 'Heeramandi' released on Netflix.\n\nAfter a month-long attack on her, Sharmin recently rejected criticism in an interaction about charges of nepotism.\n\nShekhar Suman in Sharmin Segal\n\nRecently, in an interaction with Bollywood Hungama, when Shekhar Suman was asked his honest opinion about Sharmin's performance, he said he can understand why she chose to play her character, the demure Alamzeb, the way she did.\n\nAdhyayan Suman on Sharmin Segal\n\nOn the other hand, Adhyayan Suman was more open about Sharmin. He said, \"I think it’s very important to not live in a bubble. It’s very important to accept any sort of reality, not just Heeramandi, per se. It’s very important to understand who you are, it’s very important to understand whether you have it in you to fight the next 15-20 years. It’s important for you to not lie to yourself.”\n\nAdhyayan said that it was only because he took criticism seriously himself and worked on himself to be a better actor after having been written off by the industry. \"If she is being criticised for her performance, she should come out and speak to people. The audiences are very gentle, they’ll give you another chance if they feel you’ve worked hard.”\n\nShekhar Suman defening Sharmin Segal\n\nShekhar, on the other hand, said the trolling was unfair. Although he did not share that Sharmin did not do well in the show, he tried to justify some of the choices made by Sharmin while also indirectly hinting that her performance was 'expressionless'. He said, \"If you think there is some credibility to the criticism, do some quick thinking about why they’re saying that, and if you feel they have a point, correct yourself and prove them all wrong. And if they’re doing just for the heck of it, then ignore them.”\n\nThe veteran actor also said given Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s record, the acclaimed filmmaker would not have cast someone if he was not confident in their skills.\n\n“I think they’re being too harsh on her. There are different schools of acting. If she wasn’t right, Bhansali saab wouldn’t risk his name, his career, his reputation on a girl just because she’s his niece,” Shekhar Suman added.\n\nSharmin Segal defending her performance in Heeramandi\n\nRecently, Sharmin Segal broke her silence about the trolling and defended her performance in the show. She told News18, \"I had given my all to Alamzeb’s character. We tend to fixate on the negatives but there are so many positives that have also come along, which we don’t talk about. It’s perhaps not interesting enough to talk about positives and we tend to look over them to some degree.”\n\nAbout Heeramandi\n\n'Heeramandi' is a epic-period drama that fictionalises the infamous Lahore area of the same name. The courtesan-kingdom in the pre-partition era held great power in political and social fields. Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Heeramandi' stars Aditi Rao Hydari, Manisha Koirala, Sonakshi Sinha, Sanjeeda Shaikh and others."
