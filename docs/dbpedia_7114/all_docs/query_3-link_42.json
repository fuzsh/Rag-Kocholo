        "text": "In the multifaceted world of art valuation, provenance—the documented history of an artwork's ownership—plays a pivotal role. Much like a biographical account of a masterpiece, this lineage offers insights, validates authenticity, and often dramatically influences an artwork's market value. The art museum, an institution dedicated to preserving and showcasing art, often intersects with provenance, shedding light on the deep interconnectedness of an artwork's history and valuation. The Artwork's Biography: Provenance's Impact on Value Just as historians rely on sources to piece together past events, art collectors and enthusiasts look to provenance to understand an artwork's journey. For instance, a painting that has graced the walls of a renowned art museum often gains added significance and market value. The reason is twofold: Authentication and Quality Assurance: A detailed provenance provides a roadmap that helps verify an artwork's authenticity. Suppose a piece has been a part of a notable art museum's collection or exhibited there. In that case, it adds a layer of validation. Such documentation can quell doubts and apprehensions, ensuring potential buyers of the artwork's genuineness. Historical and Cultural Significance: An artwork's history can weave a compelling narrative. Suppose a significant figure owned a painting or was part of an influential exhibition at an esteemed art museum. In that case, it gains a rich backstory, which can enhance its allure and monetary value. Highlighting Provenance: Notable Sales and Auctions The art market, including the world of art museums, has witnessed several instances where the provenance of a piece, intertwined with its association with renowned figures or art museums, has impacted its sale price. For example: Paintings with provenance linking them to victims of art theft during World War II, once recovered, have attracted significant attention. Their tumultuous history, often detailed in major art museum exhibitions, adds cultural significance and market value. Artworks that were once part of prestigious private collections and subsequently donated to or exhibited in renowned art museums often fetch higher prices at auctions. Their association with esteemed institutions and collectors is a testament to their value and significance. The documented journey of an artwork, especially its intersections with revered institutions like art museums, acts as both a shield against forgery and a beacon highlighting its significance. As art becomes a sought-after commodity, provenance becomes more critical, bridging history, authenticity, and value. https://lnkd.in/eeye2NEX #ProvenancePower #ArtMuseumImpact #ArtworkBiography #HistoryMeetsValue #GuardiansOfAuthenticity #ArtAuctionAllure\n\nIn the multifaceted world of art valuation, provenance—the documented history of an artwork's ownership—plays a pivotal role.

What moments, from the perspective of these two decades, do you consider the most interesting and satisfying in its past activities? Count Gonzaga Myszkowski The fact that the gallery exists and is celebrating its 20th anniversary can be seen as evidence of its success and the exceptional work put into its development. The longevity of its existence can speak to its significance and impact in the world of art. Sebastian Gabryel I wonder if the goal you set for yourself when you established the gallery has changed over the years. Is it still the same idea? And if you were to describe it, would it be \"less is more\"? Count Gonzaga Myszkowski The goals and objectives of an art gallery can evolve over the years in response to changing trends, and for example, we expanded into the metaverse. I haven't changed... Sebastian Gabryel Your atelier is located in the heart of Poznań. Is this a blessing or more of a curse? (laughter) Count Gonzaga Myszkowski An atelier in the heart of the city can be perceived both as a blessing and a challenge, depending on the circumstances and perspectives. Sebastian Gabryel It's worth mentioning that the works can be seen not only in Warsaw but also in Paris. Where exactly? And from both an artistic and purely personal point of view, what place does Paris hold for you today? Count Gonzaga Myszkowski The exhibition was ultimately held in Monaco Monte Carlo on a yacht in the Hercules port. It received positive reviews and recognition, which is certainly a sign that the artistic project was successful and could attract the attention of viewers and art critics. It's wonderful that my art can be appreciated on the international stage, and this success may open up new possibilities for the further development of my artistic career\n\nType in use - Maiola for the 100PY exhibition /// (From our archives) In 2018, to commemorate the centennial of the founding of Czechoslovakia, a unique exhibit was organized to bring the country’s history closer to people. The exhibition, titled '100py' [a play on words in Czech meaning 'footprints'] told the story of the country through five generations of the fictitious Němcova family from the Czech city of Pilsen. Subtitled ‘One hundred years of the Republic as seen by five generations,’ the exhibition made extensive use of our Maiola typeface. Visitors were able to walk through the exhibition at the DEPO2015 culture hub in Pilsen, look at period objects and think about the dilemmas that five generations of the family had to solve. ”It's actually three exhibitions in one,” said exhibition curator Jiří Sulženko. Maiola, designed by Veronika Burian, was selected as the main typeface of the event visual material. It was seen on the brand, the signage, and exhibition. Maiola is a contemporary typeface that is mindful of its heritage. It is intended for high-quality printed text and thus handles its expressive tendencies with care to equalise the important issues of legibility and personality. Its glyphs have purposeful and subtle irregularities which enhance its dynamic spirit. Find out more about Maiola at our website (link in comments). Interested in trying out Maiola? Our Premier programme provides 30-day test licences to our trusted partners so they are able to create mock-ups and present projects to their clients.

He turns it into a landscape, a Party. The components and effects of the forest are the products of nature: rain, water, mud, sand, light, shade, materials, branches, reflections, colors, silence, stones, courtyards, architecture, trees, leaves... Inventor of the \"Tapioca Technique\", where reality is transfigured by émotions and subjectivity, and creator of movement: \"the reflections of color\" Francis MBELLA is a visual artist of subjective hues and reliefs. An alumnus of the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts de Paris, he has held over 300 solo exhibitions and conferences worldwide. Chevalier des Arts et Lettres and Médaillé du Cercle des Arts de Paris, he was awarded the Mérite culturel de la Ville de Paris in 1990 by Jacques CHIRAC, then Mayor of Paris, and the Mérite culturel de l'Etat de Californie (USA) in 1994 in Sacramento by the then Governor Peter BARTON WILSON. He was awarded the same distinction at the UN (United Nations Organization) in Geneva in 2004 by its Director General, Sergeï ORDZHONIKIDZE ; Francis MBELLA distinguishes himself by his technique; indeed, color and relief are creative forces for him. Color works matter, it is a true activity of matter, it lives from a constant exchange of forces between matter and light. Thus, through the fatality of primitive dreams, Francis MBELLA renews the cosmic dreams that bind man to the elements, to fire, water and celestial air, to the prodigious materiality of earthly substances. From then on, for him, color has depth, it has thickness, it develops both in a dimension of intimacy and in a dimension of exuberance. He likes to link opposites. He prefers fusions, effusions and agreements to exclusions and ostracisms. His aim is to combine an intense taste for spontaneity with a desire to construct and organize the painted surface: \"What arises spontaneously,\" he says, \"finds its order of construction in the architecture of my paintings.

However, from now on, visitors will be able to explore the smell of historic objects in a completely new and little-explored way. This project is truly groundbreaking,\" Elżbieta Zygier, Chief Conservator of the National Museum in Kraków, says. Developed through chemical analysis, the pen attempts to replicate how the object itself would have once smelt. ... Part of the Odotheka project, the world's first library of scents of historic objects, Sawoszczuk's team are working in collaboration with colleagues at the ­Ljubljana University and Slovenian national museum to recreate the scents of nine other objects of great importance to Polish and Slovenian heritage. ... For decades, arts venues have contemplated ways to make the experience of viewing something more engaging through multi-sensory techniques. ... \"We [the research team] were joking that it's near 4K sightseeing now, so you not only use your eyes to see the objects, not only use your ears with the audio guide, not only use your touch because, outside of the showcase of 'Lady with an Ermine', there is the 3D copy of it, so you can touch the copy,\" Sawoszczuk says. All of this, along with scents, hopefully creates a genuinely immersive experience that enhances our understanding and emotional response to what we're viewing. More importantly, the addition of tailored smells could greatly improve gallery and museum experiences for those that are blind or partially sighted, helping them to feel more connected to historical objects. \"One of the big parts of this project is surveying the emotions of people after the exhibition. We will also do the same with blind people and ask them if this way of sightseeing with the smell is for them attractive, and how it influences their emotions about the exhibition itself. This is what we want to gather,\" Sawoszczuk says.\" #mediapsychology #transmedia #accessibility #museum #innovation #storytelling #archaeology Jean-Pierre Isbouts Krishna Stott Christy Dena Geoffrey Long Kerry Opel, Ph.D., ABC-CC\n\nTHE ART GENE Well, it is Caravaggio or not? Spain’s Prado Museum confirms rediscovery of lost Caravaggio, 'Ecco Homo' to be unveiled May 27 2024. (source: Associated Press) The painting was due to be auctioned in 2021, but was held back as it was suspected to be a Caravaggio. Now its authenticity has been confirmed by Spain’s Prado Museum it will go on display from May 27 until October in a one piece exhibition permitted by its anonymous owner. Once believed to have been part of the private collection of Phillip IV of Spain, it is attracting interest and much discussion - as to whether it truly appears to be created by the Italian master - and as there are only 55-60 works by Caravaggio in existence, it is set to become one of the most valuable old master artworks in the world, according to the Prado. Interesting enough in April 2021 Spanish authorities stopped the painting - then believed to have been painted by Ribera - from being auctioned and put an export ban on it after the museum alerted the government it could be a Caravaggio. The starting price at the ill fated auction? 1500 euros, whereas an original Caravaggio would be worth millions. The painting is not allowed to leave Spain without government permission. (These photographs show the restoration.)\n\nI like to complete this series about Naples and surroundings, and the Posillipo School of landscape painting, with a post dedicated to Capri, likely the best known of the islands which crown the Neapolitan Gulf. Nevertheless, not so much the touristy Capri of today, but rather as it was around the mid-nineteenth century. Below, in the top images, its rural and marine sides, respectively depicted by Neapolitan artists belonging to the School of Posillipo. On the left: Giacinto Gigante, “View of Capri” (watercolour and tempera: Capodimonte Museum, Naples). On the right: Consalvo Carelli, “Marina of Capri” (oil painting: San Martino Museum, Naples). Lower, two works more by C. Carelli, both of them in private collections and undated, executed in the second half of the century anyway: on the left, “Capri” (oil on cardboard); on the right, “Capri, Tiberius Bridge” (oil on canvas, partial view). Although an elite tourism was already present, the Romantic Capri of G. Gigante and C. Carelli was still anchored to its traditional rhythms. It's also true that they, and other painters of various nationalities, who depicted the island, indirectly contributed to its tourist development, until this assumed its current mass dimension. If the natural beauty of the places didn't change a lot, and was indeed enriched by archaeological or cultural resources, generally the same can't be said of the lifestyle of the local population. Slowly, an original agricultural and fishing or artisanal economy converted to hotel industry, or a trade of imported luxury goods. In a few words, Capri became a symbol for modern international tourism, but also an early lesson on its merits and defects, worthy of being studied as such too. Pictorial or picturesque, art history may help us remember its essence, why it grew a pole of attraction before any other Mediterranean island; and perhaps lead us to reflect on what to do, so that it and similar privileged sites aren't contaminated or denaturalized.\n\nThe winner of the Loewe craft prize was announced yesterday. Mexican artist Andres Anza is the winner. The Loewe craft prize is a big deal. The article below discusses the problematic hierarchy between craft and art. This is a question people love to debate, often in such obscure ways that one doesn't know what is being discussed or what are the points being made. That being said, the conversation is relevant inasmuch as putting craft on equal footing with art will enable the craft artists to sell their pieces at a higher price point. You will notice that the author indirectly dismisses functional craft - \"craft is an idea\" - “there is nothing aside from the categorical label that distinguishes objet from oeuvre”. The issue here is that she’s effectively dismissing skilled craft - and that leads to crafts becoming endangered and then extinct. There is no art craft without basic craft skills being honed and perfected."
