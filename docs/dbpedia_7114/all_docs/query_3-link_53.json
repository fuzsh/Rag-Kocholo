        "text": "The most intriguing part of the Sharks’ meeting with free-agent-to-be John Tavares in June was the appearance of Hasso Plattner, the German-born founder of tech giant SAP and primary owner of the team since 2013.\n\nPlattner has made only a handful of public appearances in representation of the team and hasn’t spoken with any media about the Sharks since moments after the 2016 Stanley Cup Final defeat. Had there not been any TV cameras outside of Tavares’ agent’s office that day in Los Angeles, it’s possible no one would even have known that the 74-year-old was as much a part of the pitch to the top-line center as anyone in the organization.\n\nAlthough the Sharks ended up being the runners-up in the Tavares sweepstakes, as the center signed in Toronto, one member of the front office came away impressed by Plattner’s solicitation.\n\n“In the free-agent meeting we had, seeing Hasso Plattner describing his feelings and strengths about the San Jose organization and where we’re at, and the passion for it — I’m sitting in the meeting and I’m getting chills, and I already work for the team,” Sharks scouting director Doug Wilson Jr. told The Athletic in July.\n\nSo when the Sharks got deep into trade talks with the Ottawa Senators about acquiring Erik Karlsson, it was Plattner who got on the phone with the elite defenseman and his wife, Melinda.\n\n“He was (involved) in several conversations with both Erik and Mel,” general manager Doug Wilson said.\n\nEven though he typically remains out of public view, it’s not uncommon for Plattner to make himself available when he’s needed, Wilson said.\n\n“If we could have done (the Tavares meeting) without you guys knowing that, that he was there and sat in traffic and drove for 2 1/2 hours each way, and flew, and all that — he does that all the time,” Wilson said. “And I mean this — this organization starts at the top, and there might not be a better owner in sports than Hasso.”\n\nIt’s probably fair to assume that Plattner was speaking to Karlsson not just about joining the Sharks for the coming season, but about signing an extension with the club, too, as the 28-year-old has just one year remaining on his current contract, carrying a $6.5 million salary cap hit.\n\nWilson doesn’t ever speak about ongoing contract negotiations, so he wasn’t willing to indicate on Saturday how close an extension might be for Karlsson. Still, he expressed a high level of confidence that something will get done.\n\n“We wouldn’t have done this deal if we weren’t very comfortable of that opportunity,” Wilson said. “That’s why I was able to have discussions with the agents, and with Erik. Look at the (Sharks) history, that’s all I can say.”\n\nThe history, of course, includes guys like Joe Thornton, Brent Burns, Marc-Edouard Vlasic, Evander Kane and Martin Jones, who have passed up the opportunity to become unrestricted free agents to remain with the organization.\n\n“When you have the type of ownership that we have and the type of team and the type of players, and you look at it from a player’s point of view, what they are looking for — I think we fill all those boxes,” Wilson said. “I had conversations with people, and came to the comfort zone of where we’re at today.”\n\nKarlsson will command a monster salary, probably somewhere along the lines of Drew Doughty’s eight-year, $88 million extension that he signed in July.\n\nBut Plattner is almost certainly willing to spend it. After all, the Sharks were ready to give Tavares at least that much.\n\n“Top players are going to get paid well, and they deserve to get paid well,” Wilson said.\n\nThe Sharks also have no concerns about Karlsson’s surgically repaired ankle that affected the start of his 2017-18 season, and prevented him from training properly last summer. Just about one year ago, Karlsson revealed that doctors removed “half my ankle bone” and replaced it with an artificial tendon, according to the Ottawa Sun.\n\n“You get to do your tests and medicals and all those things prior to (the trade), and that was part of it. … He’s 100 percent,” Wilson said. “We did our research. This guy is tough as nails, too.”\n\nWilson continued: “Spending time with him was really impressive. I’ve always admired him as a player, but spending time with him … it’s not only him wanting to be great and win Norris Trophies, he wants to win Stanley Cups. You spend any time around him, and you guys will get to know him, he’s an amazing young man.”\n\nEven though he now has a locker stall in the dressing room at the practice rink next to fellow blueliner Justin Braun, Karlsson has yet to arrive in San Jose. As of Saturday afternoon, Wilson still didn’t know when the visa issues would be sorted out.\n\nRegardless, Karlsson should be in camp with plenty of time before the Oct. 3 opener at SAP Center against Anaheim. Getting him acclimated to his new surroundings in the preseason is decidedly better than this kind of major deal happening in mid-season.\n\n“We’ve talked about adding a difference-maker, I think (it) really brings some juice and energy to this group. Whatever the timing was that we were going to pursue this, it came to fruition,” Wilson said. “Sooner is better than later, because you get to start the year, you get some continuity, you get integration, system play, so that’s really good.”\n\nFinalizing a contract extension for Karlsson would be preferable sooner rather than later, too. In the meantime, Wilson is at least fortunate that he doesn’t have to worry about the ultimate provider of those tens of millions of dollars.\n\n“We’ve got an ownership group with Hasso that is bold and supportive, and do the things we need to do,” he said. “I realize how fortunate I am to have that, and his participation in this.”\n\n— Reported from San Jose\n\n(Top photo: Uwe Anspach/picture alliance via Getty Images)"
