        "text": "Julius Holtz`s work explores cross-genre interfaces between sound art and electro-acoustic music by combining contemporary music with media arts concepts.\n\nMultisensory music he investigates by introducing interaction between the audience, visuals, spatial sound environments, and musical form. This practice has led to new interdisciplinary formats with sound as their focus. Created in 2018, the audiovisual installation „Klang-Raum-Skulptur“ was the impulse for the „The New Infinity“ production by Berliner Festspiele.\n\nOften appearing on stage as a performer, Julius performs in many of his pieces and has interpreted the music of his fellow composers. In recent years this practice has led to collaborations with Marisol Jiménez, Ensemble Mosaik, and Ensemble Tzarah. Sharing insights into his artistic research, Julius has lectured at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam and MIT.\n\nBorn in 1982 in Bremen, his musical background was initially in the club context of the 90s in Berlin, where he devoted himself to various projects as a DJ and producer. Later, he studied composition and acoustic communication at the University of the Arts in Berlin. While studying, he worked as a sound designer alongside Cory Arcangel, William Basinski, and Maryanne Amacher.\n\nHe has received funding and scholarships from the Senate of Berlin, Musikfonds, INM Berlin, and the Goethe-Institut.\n\nHe performed and exhibited his work at prestigious festivals and institutions. These include Wet Sounds Festival in London, Festival of Future Nows in Berlin, Centro de Cultura Digital in Mexico City, Steirischer Herbst in Graz, Ultima Festival in Oslo, Martin-Gropius-Bau in Berlin, Goethe-Institut in Hanoi and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C.\n\nJulius Holtz`s work explores cross-genre interfaces between sound art and electro-acoustic music by combining contemporary music with media arts concepts.\n\nMultisensory music he investigates by introducing interaction between the audience, visuals, spatial sound environments, and musical form.
