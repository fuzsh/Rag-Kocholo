        "text": "What is the AI Campus?\n\nThe AI Campus is a digital learning platform specialising in the topic of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which has been publicly available as a beta version since July 2020 and is being continuously developed. As a research and development project, the AI Campus is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF).\n\nWho is the AI Campus aimed at?\n\nThe AI Campus is aimed at students, professionals and other lifelong learners who are interested in Artificial Intelligence. It is also aimed at universities, research institutions and companies that want to participate in the AI Campus with their own learning offerings or integrate learning offerings from the AI Campus into their teaching.\n\nWhat is the goal of the AI Campus?\n\nThe vision of the AI Campus is an AI-competent society. The learning platform wants to impart AI competencies and inspire more people for the topic. Learners should be empowered to understand, question and help shape AI developments. In this way, the AI Campus addresses the acute shortage of skilled workers and at the same time strengthens a responsible approach to AI across the board.\n\nWho is developing the AI Campus?\n\nThe AI Campus is being developed as an R&D project with funding from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) jointly by the Stifterverband, the Charité, the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), the Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University (DHBW), the FernUniversität in Hagen, the Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI), the Humboldt University of Berlin, the mmb Institute and NEOCOSMO. Since 2022, the Dieter Schwarz Foundation has been funding a regional hub of the AI Campus in Heilbronn with a focus on Baden-Württemberg. The Stifterverband manages and coordinates the project through an AI Campus office in Berlin. Numerous other actors and institutions are involved as partners.\n\nWhat types of learning opportunities can I find on the AI Campus?\n\nFrom podcasts to videos and courses to \"micro-degrees\" - the AI Campus provides learners with a diverse selection of high-quality learning opportunities on various AI topics bundled on one learning platform. All learning opportunities aim to impart AI competences at an academic level. Own learning offers are developed as \"AI Campus Originals\" especially for the AI Campus. Existing learning offers from other platforms are selected based on academic quality standards and recommended as \"externals\" on the AI Campus. Our learning opportunities are all openly licensed and available free of charge.\n\nWhat topics does the AI Campus cover?\n\nThe AI Campus covers both fundamentals and interdisciplinary issues and in-depth studies of individual areas and topics in AI (such as machine learning). In addition, there are specific offerings that specifically cover the needs of individual professional fields or subject areas (such as AI in medicine, AI in education, etc.) The learning opportunities are continuously being expanded.\n\nIs prior knowledge necessary for participation in the AI Campus?\n\nFor introductory courses, no prior knowledge of the subject is necessary beyond basic mathematical knowledge. Advanced courses require previous knowledge. You will find the respective prerequisites in the description of the learning offer. All courses aim to teach AI skills at an academic level.\n\nDo I have to be enrolled at a university to use the AI Campus?\n\nIn general, you do not have to be enrolled at a university to use the AI Campus learning opportunities online. However, some courses can also be embedded into degree programmes in blended learning format, which also ensures ECTS credit. For this, enrolment is necessary in individual cases.\n\nAre the courses recognised by universities?\n\nSelected courses can be awarded ECTS credits and recognised or credited in agreement with the respective university. The AI Campus cannot give a general confirmation of recognition. Please contact your university with your specific request.\n\nIs the AI Campus also available in English?\n\nSelected courses are available in English. The range of English-language courses is being expanded on an ongoing basis.\n\nCan certificates be obtained on the AI Campus?\n\nCurrently, confirmations of participation can be obtained for all online courses on the learning platform and records of achievement for selected online courses. The following applies to all online courses on the AI Campus learning platform: A AI Campus certificate of participation is awarded to all those who have accessed at least 50 percent of the learning content. A AI Campus certificate of achievement is awarded to those who have achieved at least 60 percent of the total points in the sum of all assessed tasks in the course. For more information on the AI Campus certificates, which are being gradually piloted and implemented, see our blog post.\n\nAre there time constraints for completing learning opportunities?\n\nSome learning opportunities can be completed at your own pace, others have time limits. You will find this information in the description of each learning opportunity.\n\nIs the AI Campus free of charge?\n\nThe use of all learning offers of the AI Campus is free of charge. All AI Campus Originals are also subject to open licensing (usually CC BY-SA 4.0), which enables free subsequent use of the learning offerings and, for example, integration into one's own teaching. All curated offerings are also only selected if they are available free of charge as a basic offering. Only examinations and the issuing of certificates may possibly incur costs for external learning offers recommended on the AI Campus.\n\nHow can I create a learning offer for the AI Campus myself?\n\nWe are always open to new learning opportunities and look forward to hearing from you with your ideas!\n\nIs there the possibility of a partnership or cooperation with the AI Campus?\n\nCooperation with other platforms and initiatives is considered to be a guiding principle in the implementation of the AI Campus. We are very happy to exchange ideas about possibilities of cooperation in order to jointly develop innovative learning opportunities and to reach as many learners as possible."
