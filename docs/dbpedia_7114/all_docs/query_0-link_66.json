SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner built the freshly inaugurated Museum Barberini to house his art collection. The first show features Monet, Renoir and other Impressionists.\n\nImage: picture-alliance/AP Photo/B. von Jutrczenka\n\nA reflection of time\n\nDressed in the historic robes of a Roman palace, the new Museum Barberini is located in the heart of Potsdam, situated just outside of Berlin. The reconstructed building doesn't just fill a hole on Potsdam's old market square, it also serves to enrich the museum landscape in the Berlin region at large.\n\nImage: picture-alliance/dpa/R. Hirschberger\n\nHigh-ranking guests\n\nThe opening of Museum Barberini was celebrated with pominent visitors including German Chancellor Angela Merkel und Microsoft founder Bill Gates.\n\nImage: picture-alliance/AP Photo/B. von Jutrczenka\n\nThe patron\n\nSAP co-founder SAP Hasso Plattner is one of the wealthiest people in Germany. He is a patron of the sciences and the arts. Plattner says he wants others to be able to enjoy his art collection - one that is worth millions.\n\nImage: Museum Barberini, Potsdam\n\nStepping forward\n\n\"Der Jahrhundertschritt\" - or, \"the step of a century\" - is the title of the statue that graces the courtyard in Museum Barberini. It is the work of the late sculptor Wolfgang Mattheuer, who hailed from the former East Germany (GDR). Hasso Plattner's collection features works from the former GDR as well as Impressionist and Classical Modern paintings.\n\nImage: picture alliance/dpa/B. Settnik\n\nHonorary citizen\n\nHasso Plattner, who was born in Berlin, is respected as a generous supporter of the sciences and arts. Potsdam has named him an honorary citizen.\n\nImage: Helge Mundt, Museum Barberini, Potsdam\n\nOpening with Impressionists\n\nClaude Monet didn't only paint water lilies, but also a series of haystacks. This painting from the series was created in 1891 and is among the Impressionist works featured at Museum Barberini's opening exhibition.\n\nImage: Museum Barberini, Potsdam\n\nMood lighting\n\nClaude Monet also painted Les Petites Dalles on multiple occasions - the dramatic cliffs on the coast of Normandy. This work from 1884 depicts the steep cliff at low tide. The play of light on the water and rocks made Les Petites Dalles an ideal motif for the Impressionists.\n\nImage: Museum Barberini, Potsdam\n\nFrost in Giverny\n\nThis work, \"Frost in Giverny,\" is a 1885 work by Claude Monet. The master of light is the star of the Museum Barberini's opening show. Like many other Impressionists, he aimed to relish the moment and capture it on canvas.\n\nImage: Museum Barberini, Potsdam\n\nThe director\n\nArt historian Ortrud Westheider was the director of the Bucerius Kunstform in Hamburg before she took over the Museum Barberini in April 2016. How will the new museum establish itself on the international art scene? The opening exhibition sets the bar high.\n\nImage: Museum Barberini, Potsdam\n\n9 images\n\n1 | 99 images\n\nStefan Dege kbm\n\n01/23/2017January 23, 2017\n\nhttps://p.dw.com/p/2WEYR\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSend us your feedback\n\nYour feedback"
