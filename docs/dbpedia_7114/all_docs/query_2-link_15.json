        "text": "Since I last wrote here, I moved to Germany. That still feels strange to write. If you can believe me, it really did sneak up on us.\n\nMy partner, Casey, and I touristed in Berlin in summer 2011 and loved it. Thatâs no surprise. A visit to Berlin is catnip for the modern creative geek, from the hackerspaces to the silkscreen studios to the long, chilled-out canal-side brunches discussing philosophy and world affairs and travel and art.\n\nBack in San Francisco, Casey started taking evening courses in German. (No, we had no idea that weâd be moving here. No, I didnât find it weird that heâd suddenly decided to learn German. Neither would you, if you knew him.)\n\nThen things took an unpleasant turn in our charmed Bay Area techie life: we got evicted from our nice big rent-controlled apartment in Noe Valley, San Francisco. We were in a much better position than many people who have lost their housing in the Bay Area, but it stung nonetheless. Iâm not going to add to the chorus of despairing âwhatâs happening to the Bay Areaâ essays; letâs just say that some time away from SF was starting to look pretty good.\n\nThis was about when I got introduced to the people at the School of Design Thinking (the âD-Schoolâ) at the Hasso-Plattner-Institut, officially part of the University of Potsdam, and they offered to host me as a lecturer for a semester. It seemed like a no-commitment way to live the good life in Berlin for six months; my husbandâs company was ready to let him work remotely from Europe, and I had an institution ready to host me. I had every intention of going back to my job at Sliced Bread, the badass UX design firm I like to call âSilicon Valleyâs secret weapon.â We packed a few suitcases, put most of our stuff in storage in San Francisco, and proceeded to have one hell of a summer teaching, creating, exploring, chatting, drinking, and butchering German grammar.\n\nThen we had a problem. We did not want to leave Berlin.\n\nThe end date of our visa loomed. When the director of the advanced program at the D-School took paternity leave (yes, this is a thing in many countries besides the US) and I got offered a position as his temporary replacement, we couldnât resist. Then he didnât want the job back. So hereâs where this story takes a turn we did not expect: less than a year after moving to a foreign country, I got offered a pretty sweet permanent job.\n\nThe D-School building, nestled in a suburban forest outside Potsdam.\n\nSo now Iâm in charge of our Advanced program at the D-School. You may not know much about what we do, but Iâm going to try and change that. In a nondescript 1990s building, in the woods outside Potsdam, we are doing much more than teaching human-centered design. We are building people who can collaborate, who are oriented towards action and change, who can oscillate between strategy and details. I hear over and over that these are the people we need more of in the world, and this is exactly what weâre teaching.\n\nWhat is the deal with this program? Weâre one of eleven departments of the Hasso-Plattner-Institut, a computer science institute in Germany. The HPI is, in turn, a part of the University of Potsdam. The D-School is a year-long certificate program, not a degree. Our students already study or work in another area; this is an add-on to their normal study of design, law, engineering, fine art, languages, whatever. We teach and work in English, because some of our students, and some of our projects, are international.\n\nIf youâve heard of the Stanford d.school, where I used to work, this is sort of the same idea. Iâd say our broad aims are the same: do a really, really good job educating creative leaders. Officially, theyâre sister institutes. However, the structure is pretty different, which gives the two schools a very different feel and different community. The Stanford d.school is centrally located in a huge university, so students can attend whatever lectures, classes, or workshops they have time for. However, you have to be a current Stanford student to be a part of the Stanford d.school. The HPI D-School, on the other hand, is really pretty separate from the university. We only have one offering, which is an in-depth program that demands 20 hours a week for 4 months. The HPI D-School admits recent grads as well as current students, and many come to Berlin specifically for this program. Think of the Stanford d.school as a busy train station, and the HPI D-School as a woodland retreat.\n\nAs the manager of our Advanced program, I get to lead as both a teacher and a designer. I oversee and mentor 8 teams of 5 students, all working on product or service design projects with organizational partners (past partners have ranged from Volkswagen and Bosch, to a federation of banks, to a prison in Berlin). I create our curriculum and teach some of it. I lead a team of 17 part-time faculty who are so incredibly good that it makes my spine tingle to work with them. I manage relationships with project partners, help set the strategy for the program, and of course do all those things that come with any teaching-flavored job, like admissions and communications. Itâs a ludicrous amount of work, but I wake up every day feeling like thereâs a reason behind it. Fortunately, I get to do most of it in English, though Iâm working hard on my German so that I can communicate better with our organizational partners and with my German students and colleagues.\n\nTranslation: âyou will have a lot of variety at your job.â Iâll say.\n\nSo, now that this is my official new job, Iâm planning to write quite a bit more here about what Iâm doing out in the woods in Potsdam. I have a very strange but very interesting job to do here, and the least I can do is share some of it with you: I can tell you endless war stories about cross-cultural communication, explain the top mistakes students make when trying to figure out product ideas, and show you our most inspired teaching techniques. I hope Iâll make you laugh, get you thinking, and, best of all, give you something to try."
