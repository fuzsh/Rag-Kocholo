        "text": "This article forms part of the archives of Business Insider South Africa, which was published as a partnership between News24 and Insider Inc between 2018 and 2023.\n\nHasso Plattner is one of the top 100 richest people in the world, and co-founded SAP.\n\nHis foundation has donated R100 million to the SA's Solidarity Fund.\n\nSAP stands accused of paying roughly the same amount to companies associated with the Gupta family.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 76-year old Hasso Plattner announced that his foundation has donated R100 million towards South Africa’s Solidarity Fund.\n\nThe Solidarity Fund is focused on providing food relief to struggling South Africans as well as funding and arranging medical interventions, including procuring emergency personal protective equipment. So far, the fund has received R2.6 billion in donations\n\nPlattner, who owns the Fancourt Hotel and Estate in George with his wife Sabine, has a longstanding involvement with South Africa.\n\nHere’s what we know about him:\n\nPlattner founded one of the world’s most successful companies\n\nHe was born in 1944, in war-torn Berlin. After his parents divorced, he was sent to a strict military-style school in the south of Germany as a teenager. His father was an eye surgeon, but Plattner studied engineering (like his grandfather) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.\n\nHe told the Financial Times that he wanted to be a rocker – but realised it wouldn't work with his German accent\n\n“I would have liked to grow up in Liverpool and become a rocker. I would have put my boots on, jeans and a leather jacket, and long hair and played the guitar. (But) when you have a language like this, you can’t start singing.”\n\nInstead, he started his career as a programme developer with the American company IBM in Germany in 1968.\n\nFour years later, seeing a gap in the market, Plattner and four of his colleagues proposed that IBM develop standardised, off-the-shelf accounting and payroll software for companies, which at that stage were forced to use expensive, customised programmes.\n\nBut IBM was focused on selling big machines, and rejected the proposal. So Plattner and his colleagues resigned to launch Systems Applications and Products (SAP), with borrowed money and equipment. SAP quickly gained traction, and would became a behemoth in business software to manage operations and customer relations. It has more than 100,000 employees worldwide, serving 400,000 business customers.\n\nHe changed the way businesses work\n\nPlattner served as SAP’s CEO from 1997 to 2003, and has been described by Bloomberg Businessweek as a “red-meat-for-breakfast” executive, who “figures out what is wrong and fixes it with his own bare hands”.\n\nWhile there has been some criticism of his confrontational style – Plattner has reportedly described himself as “a Berliner – fast, loud, obnoxious, industrious, brutally open” – he is credited with spearheading a successful strategy to drive the company forward. After SAP realised that it was being left behind in embracing the internet at the end of the 1990s, he is credited with coming up and driving a brand-new strategy within days. He quickly lead the launch of SAP software programmes which could be accessed online via a portal (mySAP.com).\n\nWhile he retired as CEO in 2003, he became chairman of SAP’s board and continued to be hands-on.\n\nIn fact, he became involved in researching and contributing to a project that would speed up complex computations, which then became SAP’s flagship HANA database server product, launched in 2011. The product allowed businesses to quickly process huge volumes of data.\n\nHe recounted the start of the Hana project to the Financial Times: “I got a nice bottle of red wine and it was a nice day to sit in the shade with blank paper and pens and an eraser and I said [to myself]: ‘Do I have any idea how I would build a new enterprise office system?’ I got a few ideas and passed them to my group of PhDs. And I said: ‘Let’s have a day of open discussion about what a future system could look like.’ We basically defined the foundation of a radical system – the radicality was no redundant data. Never store data twice . . . that was the start of Hana.”\n\nHe’s among the 100 richest people in the world\n\nAccording to Forbes, he’s currently worth $15.5 billion – making him the 96th wealthiest person on the planet.\n\nHe owns the San Jose Sharks ice hockey team, and has a keen interest in sailing and golf.\n\nPlattner and South Africa\n\nPlattner first visited South Africa in 1971, when he still with IBM. Over the years, his wife Sabine became involved in various African conservation projects, and established horse farms in South Africa.\n\nIn the 1990s, they bought a house in Constantia, and then in 1994, the couple acquired Fancourt after Masterbond – in essence a pyramid scheme – collapsed. By 2000, they had invested close to R1 billion in the estate. They also run various upliftment programmes in the country.\n\nPlattner served on former president Thabo Mbeki’s advisory council on information, society and development, and established the Hasso Plattner School of Design Thinking at the University of Cape Town.\n\n\"South Africa has become a home from home for me and my family for decades. I am aware of the challenges and always eager to help create opportunities, through our own social responsibility projects or by supporting other impactful initiatives like The Solidarity Fund,\" Plattner said on Tuesday.\n\nWhy does 'R100 million and SAP' ring a bell?\n\nTwo years ago, SAP admitted that it paid R128.6m to companies linked to the Gupta family. It faces allegations that the money was kickbacks to secure contracts from Transnet and Eskom.\n\nAs the details of these allegations leaked in 2017, Plattner “profoundly apologised to the people of South Africa” in an open letter to Biznews.\n\n“The news about questionable sales commissions by SAP in South Africa was brought to my attention by my daughter Kristina. As you can imagine I was shocked and asked for an immediate investigation and suspension of the SAP people involved,” he wrote.\n\nReceive a daily update on your cellphone with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:"
