        "text": "The Hasso Platner Institute of Design at Stanford University, also known as the d.School, is an academic school within Stanford University centered around “design thinking” that conducts engineering and design projects in technology, consumer goods, business processes, and more. The school was founded in 2004 by mechanical engineering professors at Stanford with funding from German businessman Hasso Plattner, co-founder of software company SAP. The school is known for classes that encourage teams of students to launch businesses and develop web and mobile applications in partnerships with governments, nonprofit organizations, and companies.\n\nWhile much of the work of the school is nonpolitical, the school is a member of the U.S. Alliance for Election Excellence, a coalition left-of-center election nonprofits created in 2022 as an initiative of the Center for Tech and Civic Life (CTCL) that is funded by the Audacious Project.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Hasso Platner Institute of Design was founded by professors at Stanford University in 2005. The institute was funded with a $35 million donation from Hasso Platner, a billionaire German businessman who co-founded software company SAP. At its founding the institute was described as an effort within the engineering school to promote design thinking as part of the “evolution of design from form and style toward thinking and strategy.”\n\nDavid Kelley, a professor of mechanical engineering at Stanford was the founding director of the institute and among the first engineers to employ the concept of design thinking, which his biography describes as “developing solutions with iterative prototyping, and inspiring ideas for the future through storytelling.”\n\nProjects and Activity\n\nStudents of the Hasso Platner Institute of Design have launched several companies and products throughout the existence of the institute. Examples include Embrace, a sleeping bag that helps raise the body temperature of low-birth-weight infants for use in developing countries; d.light, a company that manufactures inexpensive LED lights for rural villages without electricity; and a 2009 iPhone and iPad application called Pulse News Reader.\n\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\nThe Hasso Plattner Institute of Design has adopted left-of-center language and programs centered around Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) through its “Designing for Social Systems Program.” One blog post from the program within the institute discusses the institute adopting an “equity lens” and states that challenges faced by “social systems practitioners” are “largely rooted in inequity: current and historical oppression, active and passive discrimination and bias, intentional or merely complicit structural exclusion.”\n\nU.S. Alliance for Election Excellence"
