The primary objective is to equip a new generation of researchers with a sound understanding of the interconnectedness between climate change and human health to address global public health challenges. The lectures will provide an extensive overview on cutting-edge methods in climate research and epidemiology and explore how artificial intelligence can be applied to answer cross-domain research questions. Participants will have the opportunity to expand their knowledge base, acquire new skills and become part of a growing global network.\n\nJoin us for an intensive week of learning and interdisciplinary exchange with leading experts.\n\nProgramme\n\n>> The programme in detail\n\nBenefits of participation\n\nCutting-edge learning: Immerse yourself in an exciting 5-day school on\n\nState-of-the-art research on climate dynamics and their impacts on global health\n\nEpidemiology of infectious diseases and their susceptibility to climate change\n\nNovel AI approaches in current resarch on climate change, public health, and data analytics\n\nInteractive engagement: Participate in lively discussions, exchange ideas and experiences and network with peers and experts from around the world\n\nCertificate of participation: Receive a certificate for successful participation in the Summer School\n\nParticipation details\n\nLimited places: 40 places are available at the Summer School\n\nFees: The registration fee includes access to all curriculum-based activities, a lunch per day and refreshments. Travelling expenses and accommodation must be covered by participants themselves\n\nStandard fee: 450 €\n\nReduced fee: 150 €\n\nRegistration information\n\nRegistration is open and closes on 15th June 2024.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming you to the CLIMADEMIC Summer School 2024 in Berlin!\n\nContact information\n\nRobert Koch Institute\n\nCentre for Artificial Intelligence in Public Health Research (ZKI-PH)\n\nLudwig-Witthöft-Str. 14\n\n15745 Wildau\n\nGermany\n\nEmail: zki-ph@rki.de\n\nWebsite: www.rki.de\n\nAbout the CLIMADEMIC project\n\nThe CLIMADEMIC project aims to identify, systematise and predict the coupling mechanisms between the Earth's changing climate and the dynamics of pandemics. State-of-the-art numerical climate models and datasets will be used in combination with the latest findings in infection biology, disease dynamics and bioinformatics. Artificial intelligence and causal inference methods will be used to bridge the interdisciplinary gap between the different research branches and to reveal the governing inter-dynamic processes as formalised causal expressions. This will make it possible to predict the evolution of pandemics under different future scenarios of climate change. CLIMADEMIC will provide a new level of understanding of global and regional climate-related threats to human health, which is a prerequisite for the development of mitigation strategies.\n\nThe Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) is funding this project within the framework of the Strategy „Research for Sustainability\" (FONA) www.fona.de/en.\n\nFurther information"
