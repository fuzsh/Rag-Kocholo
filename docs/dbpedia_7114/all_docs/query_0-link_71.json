The peptide corresponds to a unique sequence from the N-terminal extracellular portion of the receptor protein (antibody = Ab 5HT2-N). This peptide was chosen based on its theoretical antigenic index and for specificity to the 5-HT2 receptor. In dot blot analysis, antisera detected 2 ng-2 micrograms of synthetic peptide at dilutions of 1/200-1/20,000. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector containing the 5-HT2 cDNA displayed intense immunoreactivity with crude and affinity-purified Ab 5HT2-N. In contrast, no immunoreactivity was seen in control experiments when: (1) non-transfected or vector transfected COS-7 cells were used; (2) pre-immune sera was substituted for primary antisera; (3) primary antisera was omitted; or (4) antiserum was pre-adsorbed to 10 microM synthetic peptide. Immunohistochemical analysis of sections of perfused rat brain revealed intense immunolabelling of a subset of neurons in regions of the ventral forebrain, dorsal hippocampus, striatum, cerebral cortex, and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDT). An especially dense band of small cells was seen in layer 2 of pyriform cortex. There was a very high concentration of labelled cells in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus. In situ hybridization histochemistry with a 5-HT2 antisense cRNA riboprobe showed a pattern of hybridization in forebrain similar to the pattern of immunolabelling with Ab 5HT2-N. Western blot analysis of proteins extracted from the LDT revealed a single protein species reacting with the antibody. This reactivity is not present in the pre-immune sera and is blocked by the synthetic antigen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1993LK26000014\n\nView details for PubMedID 7689908\n\nAbstract\n\nWe determined the affinities of clozapine and 21 other typical and atypical antipsychotic agents for the cloned 5-hydroxytryptamine-1C (5-HT1C) receptor. For these studies, 5-HT1C receptors were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells using the vector pSVK3-5HT1C. We discovered that clozapine and several other putative typical and atypical antipsychotic agents (loxapine greater than tiosperone greater than SCH23390 greater than fluperlapine greater than rilapine greater than chlorpromazine) had relatively high affinities (7-30 nM) for the cloned 5-HT1C receptor. Other antipsychotic agents (risperidone greater than tenilapine greater than mesoridazine greater than thioridazine greater than cis-fluphenthixol) had intermediate affinities (30-100 nM), whereas many other antipsychotics (fluphenazine greater than spiperone greater than amperozide greater than melperone greater than thiothixene greater than haloperidol, metoclopramide, pimozide, domperidone, sulpiride) had low affinities (greater than 500 nM) for the cloned 5-HT1C receptor. The results indicate that although several putative atypical antipsychotic agents have high affinities for the cloned rat 5-HT1C receptor, the spectrum of drug binding does not correlate with the atypical nature of these compounds.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1992HJ01900060\n\nView details for PubMedID 1347569\n\nAbstract\n\nRats were injected with 15 mg/kg (i.p.) mianserin or vehicle (saline) for 4, 10 or 21 days and 5-HT2 receptor binding and mRNA levels measured. Treatment with mianserin induced a substantial decrease in 5-HT2 radioligand binding (44-59% decrease; P less than 0.05 vs. control). No changes in the amount of 5-HT2 or, as a control, beta-actin mRNAs were found (P greater than 0.05 vs. control). These results indicate that mianserin decreases 5-HT2 radioligand binding without altering steady-state 5-HT2 mRNA levels.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1991FU51900011\n\nView details for PubMedID 1879460\n\nAbstract\n\nWe investigated the regulation of 5-HT2 and 5-HT1c receptors and their corresponding mRNAs during rat brain development. This study showed that 5-HT2 and 5-HT1c receptors increased markedly during ontogeny. 5-HT2 receptors, measured with [3H]ketanserin or [125I]lysergic acid diethylamide binding, increased 8-fold between embryonic day 17 (E17) and postnatal day 13 (P13). 5-HT2 receptor mRNA levels, quantified by probing Northern blots of total RNA with a synthetic oligonucleotide cDNA probe, multiplied 13-fold between E17 and P5. The developmental pattern of 5-HT2 receptor and mRNA expression appeared to correlate with the serotonergic hyperinnervation of the cortex which occurs between P2 and P17. 5-HT1c receptors, measured with [125I]lysergic acid diethylamide under site-specific conditions, increased 2-fold between E17 and P27, 5-HT1c mRNA increased 5-fold between E17 and P27. Interestingly, the developmentally induced variations in 5-HT1c receptors did not precisely correlate with mRNA alterations. Further study of the factors responsible for these alterations could help to explain the molecular and biochemical mechanisms responsible for modulating receptor levels in vivo.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1991FL33200006\n\nView details for PubMedID 2015654\n\nAbstract\n\nBoth the 5-hydroxytryptamine2 (5-HT2) and 5-HT1c receptors may be regulated by a large number of endogenous and exogenous factors. The 5-HT2 receptors, for example, may be decreased by acute and chronic treatment with many antipsychotic agents, some antidepressants, and receptor-specific agonists. Similar to the 5-HT2 receptor, the 5-HT1c receptors may be decreased by acute and chronic treatment with the antidepressant mianserin. The 5-HT2 receptors appear to increase during perinatal development and are reported to be elevated in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of victims of suicide; the 5-HT1c receptors display supersensitivity following ablation of serotonergic terminals with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine. The molecular details responsible for these changes remain unknown, though with the recent cloning of the cDNAs for the 5-HT2 and 5-HT1c receptors the occasion is particularly favorable for mechanistic studies aimed at determining how these alterations occur. Preliminary information suggests that developmentally induced alterations in 5-HT2 and 5-HT1c receptors may be due to transcriptional regulation while changes caused by mianserin treatment might be due to posttranslational processes (e.g., proteolysis, internalization, phosphorylation, covalent alterations). Insights into the molecular means by which 5-HT receptors are regulated could have profound influences on our understanding of pharmacologic, developmental, and psychopathologic processes.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1990EP13500015\n\nView details for PubMedID 2078277\n\nAbstract\n\nRadioiodinated human beta-endorphin was cross-linked to opioid receptors from rat brain membranes using the bifunctional reagents bis-[2-(succinimidooxycarbonyloxy)ethyl] sulfone (BSCOES) and disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS). Major radiolabeled bands migrated with Mr values of 65,000, 55,000 and 33,000, however the presence of the 55 kDa band was variable. The 65 kDa band was characterized as the mu-receptor: the binding of [125I]beta-endorphin to this band was displaced by mu-selective ligands and blocked by alkylation of the receptor by mu-specific, but not delta-specific alkylating agents. The cross-linked receptor underwent alterations in mol. wt. during development. Early in development, embryonic day 18 and postnatal day 1, the [125I]beta-endorphin-labeled material migrated as a single band of mol. wt. 55 kDa. By day 21 postnatally the higher mol. wt. band of 65 kDa was present, as was material of 53, 47 and 43 kDa. Although the protein labeled early in development migrated with a mol. wt. of 55 kDa similar to the delta-receptor isolated from NG108-15 neuroblastoma-glioma cells, competition studies suggest this protein is not the delta-receptor. The 65 kDa band, tentatively identified as the mu-receptor, was present in adults but not detected in neonates, despite competition binding data indicating the presence of mu-sites. The results suggest that the 55 kDa band found in the 1-day-old neonate may be an immature form of the mu-opioid receptor that undergoes posttranslational modification, perhaps glycosylation, during development.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1989T043100012\n\nView details for PubMedID 2540924\n\nAbstract\n\nProtein kinase C (PKC), a calcium- and phospholipid-dependent kinase, is highly enriched in rat brain, where it may function in signal transduction processes. We purified rat brain PKC to homogeneity by a three-column procedure of diethylaminoethyl-cellulose, phenyl-Sepharose, and protamine-agarose with a yield of 16% and a final specific activity of 9,600 pmol of [3H]phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate bound/mg of protein. The pure protein consisted of a doublet of 80 and 78 kilodaltons. Rabbit antibodies prepared against a beta-type PKC synthetic peptide sequence (RAKIGQGTKAPEEKTANTISK) showed high specificity and sensitivity for PKC and recognized only the 78-kilodalton form of PKC. Micropunches (300 microns in diameter) of rat hippocampal subregions were solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer, electrophoresed on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose. PKC was visualized by 125I-protein A autoradiography and quantified by densitometry. The highest concentrations of PKC were found in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer (0.43 +/- 0.04 OD), with the lowest amounts in the CA3 and CA4 pyramidal cell layers (0.11 +/- 0.02 and 0.085 +/- 0.006 OD, respectively). These results demonstrate a simple way of preparing antibodies against domains of PKC. We also describe a procedure for quantifying the relative amounts of PKC in discrete brain regions.\n\nView details for Web of Science ID A1989R374400030\n\nView details for PubMedID 2908889"
