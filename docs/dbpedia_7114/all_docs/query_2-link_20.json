        "text": "University in the German city of Potsdam\n\nNot to be confused with the State University of New York at Potsdam in the United States.\n\nThe University of Potsdam is a public university in Potsdam, capital of the state of Brandenburg, northeastern Germany.\n\nThe university is mainly situated across three campuses in the city. Some faculty buildings are part of the New Palace of Sanssouci which is known for its UNESCO World Heritage status.[4]\n\nThe University of Potsdam is Brandenburg's largest university and the fourth largest in the Berlin-Brandenburg metropolitan area. More than 8,000 people are working in scholarship and science.\n\nIn 2009 the University of Potsdam became a winner in the \"Excellence in Teaching\" initiative of the Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft (Business innovation agency for the German science system).\n\nThe University of Potsdam was formed in 1991 by the amalgamation of the Karl Liebknecht College of Education and the Brandenburg State College, as well as several other smaller institutions. As the university in large part emerged from the College of Education, emphasis today is still placed on teacher training.\n\nSome parts of the university are located in historical buildings that have been named as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. The university library and the Institute of History can be found in a part of the commons in the park of Sanssouci, at the New Palace, as can the Institute of Mathematics in the former stables.\n\nThe other campuses, Babelsberg and Golm, are also of historical interest. The oldest buildings of the Golm campus were built in the 1930s to house the Luftwaffe's intelligence department. After World War II the College of Law of the East German Ministry for State Security moved in.\n\nThe current Faculty of Law is located in Babelsberg/Griebnitzsee in the former presidial and administrative buildings of the German Red Cross (1939/40). Other lecture halls and buildings were built in the 1950s directly behind the Schloss Babelsberg for the Academy of Justice and the East German state.\n\nAs the largest university in the state of Brandenburg, the University of Potsdam mainly stretches across three campuses on the city's outskirts:[4]\n\nNew Palace, Sanssouci (Am Neuen Palais): Faculties of Philosophy, Institutes of Mathematics and Sports. The university's main campus, which includes the Auditorium Maximum, is situated in the immediate proximity of Park Sanssouci. The Communs – the prestigious annexes of the New Palace are home to some of the institutes of the Faculty of Arts. The eighteenth century baroque buildings, which disguise their former purpose as the Palace's offices and service rooms with staircases, porticos, cupolas, and rich ornamentation, are currently home to the university's presidential office and administration. The Institutes of Sports Science and Sports Medicine as well as the Institute for Mathematics can be found on the Campus Am Neuen Palais.\n\nGolm: Faculties of Humanities, Mathematics and Science. Most institutes of the Faculty of Science as well as the Human Sciences Faculty are located in Potsdam-Golm, forming one of the largest science parks in the region. Three Max Planck Institutes and two Fraunhofer Institutes as well as the start-up center GO:IN have already settled here.\n\nPotsdam-Babelsberg/Griebnitzsee: Faculties of Law, Economics and Social Studies, Institutes of Computer Science, the Hasso Plattner Institute for Software Systems Engineering. Campus Griebnitzsee is situated along the city border with Berlin, not far from the famous Babelsberg film studios, and houses the law faculty and the faculty of economics and social sciences. The Institute of Computer Sciences is also located here and benefits greatly from its proximity to the Hasso Plattner Institute for Software Systems Engineering, a completely privately funded co-institute of the University of Potsdam. Other small institutes and departments exist in the City of Potsdam. The Botanischer Garten Potsdam is the university's botanical garden.\n\nAt the beginning of the winter semester of the 2020/2021 academic year, roughly 22,000 young people were studying at the University of Potsdam.[5] The University is placing particular emphasis by establishing four university research focuses. Constantly increasing third-party funding volume testifies to the quality of the research conducted at the University today. The University of Potsdam also has successful, productive cooperative agreements with more than 30 non-university research institutions in the region. With interdisciplinary research agenda, the area of excellence links the departments of Psychology, Linguistics, and Sports and Health Science. UP offers more than 150 degree programs in various fields, offered in German as well as other languages, notably French and English.\n\nAs is common in Germany, the University of Potsdam's teaching and research programmes are carried out along the lines of faculties. The university contains the following faculties:\n\nThe Digital Engineering Faculty, jointly established by the University of Potsdam and the Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI), is the first privately funded department of a German public university.\n\nThe Law Faculty's curriculum offers the basic and required courses necessary to become a fully qualified lawyer. This training includes civil law, criminal law, and public law. At Potsdam, the areas of concentration in research and teaching comprise the fundamentals of law, civil judicature, business law, international law, public administration as well as business, tax, and environmental criminal law. All these areas offer ample opportunity for specialized study. Additional events for training and continuing education for practitioners in the municipal realm are offered by the Institute for Local Government Studies and in international relations by the Human Rights Centre. Furthermore, a German-French law program exists in cooperation with University Paris Ouest-Nanterre/La Défense.\n\nIn recent years, the University of Potsdam's Philosophical Faculty has redefined itself in the spirit of cross-disciplinary cultural studies. Research and teaching at the Institutes for Religious Studies, Jewish Studies, Jewish Theology, Philosophy, History, Classical Philology, German Studies, English and American Studies, Romance Studies, Slavic Studies as well as Art and Media are devoted to a broad understanding of culture that is defined by including all aspects of human life.\n\nDrawing from the broad range of faculty specialties, the thematic concentrations of \"Cultures in/of Mobility,\" \"Forms of Life and the Know How of Living\" as well as \"Region and Identity in Europe\" were created. This emphasis in regard to content encourages interdisciplinary cooperation, but it also incorporates perspectives that are outside the Philosophical Faculty's traditional subject canon. The Focus Area Unsettled Cultures, for example, investigates among others the history and cultural practice of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and thereby combines different areas of study, such as theology, literature, ethics, medicine, and cosmology.\n\nIn the spirit of research-based teaching, new academic programs such as Mobility Studies are being developed to complement the already existing interdisciplinary Master's programs in Jewish Studies, Communications Linguistics, Military Studies, European Media Studies as well as others. Furthermore, the faculty highly values the intensive support of young scholars. The graduate colleges, graduate schools, and externally funded projects under the auspices of the Philosophical Faculty offer young scholars the opportunity for interdisciplinary and international cooperation.\n\nWith the Cognitive Sciences and the Educational Sciences, the Faculty of Human Sciences includes two of the interdisciplinary focus areas of the University of Potsdam that operate beyond faculty boundaries. The Cognitive Sciences' excellence is based predominantly on the Collaborative Research Centre \"Information Structure: The Linguistic Means for Structuring Utterances, Sentences and Texts.\" Empirical research is currently being expanded in the educational sciences, and it is closely linked to teaching. In the education and training of aspiring teachers in all faculties, the Faculty of Human Sciences occupies a central role.\n\nThe \"Area of Excellence Cognitive Sciences\" and the \"Focus Area Educational Sciences\" are divided into further research clusters and teaching units. Instruction in the departments of psychology, linguistics, sports, and health science is organized into educational science and teacher training. The research emphases are language, action and behavior, health, professional and popular sports, school and classroom as well as teaching across the life span.\n\nIn the future, the existing potentials in the area of health sciences and prevention will be developed into another focus area. The research area in health is currently already well connected with the support systems for professional sports. The Faculty of Human Sciences mediates between theory and real life in a variety of ways. It is a service provider for the city of Potsdam and the federal state of Brandenburg. It maintains several consultation centers for psychotherapy and speech therapy as well as a university clinic. The university clinic is currently licensed as an examination center of the German Olympic Sports Confederation. Ultimately, a regional health network will be developed in cooperation with other service providers.\n\nFurthermore, the faculty is actively striving for more quality in training students by establishing national and international Master's and graduate programs and developing a system of quality assurance in teaching.\n\nWith business administration and economics, political and administrative sciences, and sociology as fields of study, the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences has continuously renewed itself and created its own unique and independent brand label. Research and teaching are closely intertwined. The faculty is considered one of the most important German institutes for research, training, and consulting in the areas of policy research and administrative sciences. Another concentration in the field of innovation and technology is currently being developed.\n\nFollowing a multi-theoretical approach, researchers are investigating the interactive relationship between politics, economy, and institutions at different levels and in different fields of activity. The interdisciplinary approach allows for a study of the interplay between the economy, public and private institutions, and policy-making. Problems of governance between state, economy, and civil society are just as much a concern as problems of governance within the very differentiated public sector. Political and administrative scientists, sociologists, and economists are working on collaborative projects. The interplay of different research approaches and methods creates empirical and theoretical knowledge that transmits a complex and differentiated picture of socioeconomic, cultural, and political developmental processes in modern societies—domestically as well as internationally.\n\nThe Faculty is very engaged in linking research and teaching to practice. Therefore, the outcomes of research in the areas start-up, consulting, and innovation directly benefit the faculty's Institute for Start-up and Innovation (BIEM CEIP), a central service institution for aspiring entrepreneurs. The Institute for Local Government Studies (KWI) conducts collaborative research with the law faculty in examining issues faced by municipalities in the new Länder and offers continuing education to its elected officials. Furthermore, the faculty's Potsdam Center for Public Policy and Management (PCPM) ensures active national and international knowledge transfer with its research and consulting projects as well as opportunities for academically-focused continuing education. The German Center for Higher Education Development considers the Master's and Ph.D. programs offered through the PCPM to be among the very best in Europe. Among these are the EAPAA-accredited international postgraduate Program in Public Policy and Management for public sector professionals in English language with the (MPM) Master of Public Management and its three streams: Public Policy and Administration (PPA), Global Public Policy (GPP) and GeoGovernance (GG), the German-French Master of European Governance and Administration (MEGA) and the Executive Master of Public Management (EMPM) Program with the Hertie School of Governance.\n\nThe Faculty of Health Sciences is a newly found joint faculty of the University of Potsdam, the Brandenburg Medical School Theodor Fontane and the Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus-Senftenberg (still under development).\n\nUnder its roof, the Faculty of Science at the University of Potsdam contains the Institutes for Biochemistry and Biology, Chemistry, Nutrition Sciences, Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Computer Sciences, Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy as well as the University of Potsdam Botanical Garden. Especially the study programs in Geoecology, Geoscience, Nutrition Science, Polymer Science, and Software Systems Engineering are in high demand.\n\nThe faculty has been strong in gaining external funding and has established future-oriented concentrations and productive core areas in research and teaching. Five of the university's eight focus areas are part of the Faculty of Science: Earth Sciences, Functional Soft Matter, Functional Ecology and Evolution, Complex Systems, and Plant Genomics/Systems Biology. The faculty's own concentrations, such as teacher training in mathematics and natural sciences, sensibly complement the focus areas by supporting their interconnectedness and contribute to their continuous advancement and renewal.\n\nThe close cooperation between the natural sciences and extramural research institutions in the Berlin-Brandenburg region, already intended in the University of Potsdam's founding concept, was praised very early on by the German Council of Science and Humanities. The collaboration with several institutes of the Max Planck Society, the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, the Helmholtz Association, the Leibniz Association, and the Hasso Plattner Institute for Software Systems Engineering exemplify this extensive networking. Currently, there are more than 40 joint professorships with these institutions.\n\nThe university is the largest institution of higher education in the state of Brandenburg. It has repeatedly received the \"Excellence in Teaching\" Award from the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder in the Federal Republic of Germany. The University of Potsdam offers 170 degree programs. It is not considered a \"Volluniversität\", i.e. a university offering courses in all traditional disciplines, since it does not comprise institutions for degrees in Medicine and Engineering. It also offers English-language Master's degree programs and courses. In addition, the university provides seminars, workshops and Executive Master's degree programs to career entrants and managerial staff.[6]\n\nStudents in Brandenburg are not charged for tuition. There is, however, a small administrative fee for each semester, which includes a public transport ticket for Berlin and Brandenburg for six months and amounted to EUR 304.16 in 2020.[7]\n\nThe University of Potsdam confers the following academic degrees for its undergraduate and graduate programs:\n\nBachelor of Arts (B.A.)\n\nBachelor of Education (B.Ed.)\n\nBachelor of Science (B.Sc.)\n\nFirst State Examination in Law or Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.)\n\nMaster of Arts (M.A.)\n\nMaster of Education (M.Ed.)\n\nMaster of Science (M.Sc.)\n\nMaster of Business Administration

Prospective educators are prepared for their work in schools and future educational challenges through the provision of well-founded subject knowledge, educational science competencies, didactic expertise, and a substantial practical component.[13]\n\nCurrently, the University of Potsdam offers educational programs for the following teaching qualifications:\n\nPrimary School Teacher Education\n\nPrimary School Teacher Education with a focus on Special Education\n\nSecondary School Teacher Education (general subjects)\n\nSecondary School Teacher Education (vocational subjects) (only Master's degree programs)\n\nSpecial Education Teacher Education\n\nIn the teacher education programs at the University of Potsdam, two subjects are combined, each with equal weight. An exception is the Special Education Teacher Education program, where one subject is studied in combination with two areas of specialization.\n\nThe teacher education programs at the University of Potsdam are characterized by a significant practical component, including five accompanying internships. These internships include an orientation internship (classroom observation) during the bachelor's program, an integrated entry internship (classroom observation) for primary school teacher education students, an internship in pedagogical-psychological fields (e.g., in a kindergarten), and subject-specific didactic internships in the chosen teaching subjects (comprising observation and independent teaching).\n\nIn the master's program, a full teaching internship is completed at a school (comprising observation and independent teaching), accompanied by a Psychodiagnostics Internship (application and practice of psychodiagnostic methods). The teaching internship can be completed both domestically and abroad.\n\nAn exception is the master's program for teaching at Secondary Level (vocational subjects). For this teaching program, the teaching internship is waived, but the preparatory service is extended to 18 months. However, an orientation internship, an internship in pedagogical-psychological fields of vocational education, and subject-specific didactic internships in both subjects must still be completed.\n\nIn the winter semester 2023/2024, 20,406 students were enrolled at the University of Potsdam. International students make up 15% of the student body. 4,444 new students took up their studies at the Potsdam alma mater in the winter semester 2023/2024.[14]\n\nLaw Faculty: 2,754\n\nFaculty Of Arts: 4,916\n\nFaculty Of Human Sciences: 3,882\n\nFaculty of Economics and Social Sciences: 3,433\n\nFaculty Of Science: 4,840\n\nDigital Engineering Faculty: 975\n\nFaculty of Health Sciences: 0 (still under development)\n\nThe students are represented directly by the Student Parliament, the General Students' Committee (AStA) and the Departmental Student Representative Committees.\n\nMore than 60 student organizations are registered as associations at the university. They enable students to pursue political or cultural interests, organize social projects, such as a student-run crisis hotline, and establish contacts beyond their degree program. The University Athletic Department offers up to 200 different courses for a small fee. This also includes unusual sports like historical sword fighting. There are dining halls on every campus run by the Potsdam Association for Student Affairs with main courses starting at EUR 1.50. The Association for Student Affairs also provides accommodation for 2,855 students in the city of Potsdam. The \"Nil\" club on the Am Neuen Palais campus has been run by students since 1999. In Potsdam's city center, students also manage the Student Cultural Center \"KuZe\" and the \"Pub à la Pub\" bar.\n\nWithin faculties, teaching and research activities may be further decentralised through departments, graduate schools or institutes. For example,\n\nPCPM, Potsdam Center for Policy and Management, which has earned the University of Potsdam a reputation as one of the leading competence centers for Governance and the Public Sector. A recent reputation study by the German Association for Political Science has declared the University of Potsdam one of the three most important German universities and research institutions in the area of policy research and administrative sciences.[15] The Center for Higher Education Development considers the Master's and Ph.D. programs offered here to be among the very best in Europe. Among these are the EAPAA-accredited international postgraduate Program in Public Policy and Management for public sector professionals in English language with the (MPM) Master of Public Management and its three streams: Public Policy and Administration (PPA), Global Public Policy (GPP) and GeoGovernance (GG), the German-French Master of European Governance and AdministrationEuropean Governance and Administration (MEGA) and the Executive Master of Public Management (EMPM) Program with the Hertie School of Governance.\n\nBIEM-CEIP, Institute for Start-ups, Entrepreneurship and Innovation\n\nKWI, Institute for Local Government Studies\n\nThe Hasso Plattner Institute for Software Systems Engineering is the first, and currently the only university institute that is completely privately financed. Hasso Plattner, co-founder and advisory board chairman of the software company SAP, created the opportunity for a unique academic elite-education in IT systems technology. Meeting the demands of the industry, about a dozen professors and more than fifty additional visiting professors and lecturers are currently training about 450 highly talented young people in the Bachelor and Master's programs to become IT systems engineers.\n\nThe Hasso Plattner Institute of Design integrates product design, engineering, and business management education, in cooperation with Stanford University. While it is located in Stanford University, it is a joint project and a degree with respective content is also offered through the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam.\n\nThe Abraham Geiger College is the first rabbinical seminary in Central Europe after 1945. When the Nazis closed the Higher Institute for Jewish Studies (Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums) in Berlin in 1942, it meant the end of an era that had begun with Abraham Geiger. In 1836 Geiger had called for the founding of a Jewish theological department at a German university that would be dedicated to Jewish tradition in the spirit of academic freedom. Today, the Abraham Geiger College provides education for rabbis and cantors for Jewish communities in Central and Eastern Europe. Besides vocational training, participants go through a regular university program of study that is integrated into the extensive curriculum of the School of Jewish Theology at the University of Potsdam and that must be completed with a B.A. for cantors and an M.A. for rabbis. After completing the degree and contingent upon agreement of supervisors and mentors, the rabbinical college then recommends candidates for ordination into the Jewish clergy.\n\nThe Moses Mendelssohn Center for European-Jewish Studies focuses on the history, religion, and culture of Jews and Judaism in European countries. A special accent is placed on the history of relations between Jews and their non-Jewish environment. On the one hand, research is concerned with the problems of social integration and acculturation faced by Jews, and on the other hand it focuses on comparative social historical questions related to living conditions and to geographical as well as social mobility. Further areas of research include hostility towards Jews as well as historical and contemporary antisemitism.

Students or post-graduates can apply for a wide variety of scholarships, but the conditions and opportunities vary according to the country of origin and field of study. Other scholarship providers also have varying prerequisites regarding country of origin, field of study, prior academic performance, the duration of the scholarship, etc.\n\nThe prerequisites and the weighting of the various criteria for stipends are determined by the individual profiles of the foundation providing for the scholarships. For example, one's previous marks or grades are weighted differently by the various foundations. For some foundations, previous marks are weighted as the main criteria, and the social situation of the applicant is given significantly less weight. For other scholarships, good marks are important in order to receive a scholarship, but this does not mean that an applicant qualifies for one. Many foundations give significant weight to financial need, engagement in the civil society, or a developed personal profile. Willingness to participate in the respective foundation's programme is also important to some foundations.
