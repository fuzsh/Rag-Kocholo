        "text": "Just coming back from a wonderful breakfast event with about 30 participants from many fields at the American Council on Germany, talking about #DataQuality and #AI (of course). The questions we discussed ranged from data preparation (\"open\" data served as pdf-file) to measuring completeness to the differences of AI and privacy policies in the US and Europe. Many thanks to Steven E Sokol for the kind invitation and to Joann Halpern for making the connection!\n\nHow Design Thinking helps innovate 💡 Yesterday we were invited to Hasso Plattner Institute NYC by its director, Joann Halpern. The New York office expands HPI's global reach and is part of the global Design Thinking Alliance. Despite the breathtaking view, I would like to share the following insights with you: 🏳️🌈 Multidisciplinary teams: With diverse teams, ideas can be generated beyond everyone's own discipline. This is faster and more sustainable. 💭 Variable space: Where do you get your best ideas? In the shower, while exercising? Ideas are best generated in a flexible working environment. That is why flexible furniture and lots of moderation tools are highly recommended. 🔄 Iterative process: By using a human-centered and iterative process, teams arrive at desirable solutions. You should go for quantity and fail early and often. Even if you can't implement the whole design thinking approach, you should at least aim for parts of it. Thank you for the invitation, Joann Halpern! It was our pleasure!\n\nHow Design Thinking helps innovate 💡 Yesterday we were invited to Hasso Plattner Institute NYC by its director, Joann Halpern.

This morning at the SAP and Hasso Plattner Institute NYC offices, we learned about some of the cutting-edge #research being conducted by Prof. Vaibhav Bajpai and his research group at #HPI. We also had the opportunity to experience Prof. Bajpai in action, and there is no question that he deserves the #TUM teaching award he received several years ago before joining the faculty of HPI. I was particularly intrigued to learn about #DNS resiliency and efficiency as well as the performance trade-offs associated with encrypting DNS traffic. Prof. Bajpai introduced us to a forward-looking protocol design that harmonizes performance with #privacy, resulting in the best of both worlds: enhanced privacy for DNS and #securewebcommunication. 👏 Kudos to the audience for the great questions during the Q&A. Many new networks were formed both prior to and after Prof. Bajpai's outstanding presentation. A very special thank you to Katja Schroeder for bringing so many of your colleagues to the event and to HPI Professor Gerard de Melo, who joined us after engaging in an enlightening book discussion at the German Consulate General New York yesterday.\n\nEarlier today, in partnership with the German Consulate General New York, the Hasso Plattner Institute NYC organized a breakfast discussion featuring Prof. Hilke Schellmann, author of \"The Algorithm: How AI Decides Who Gets Hired, Monitored, Promoted, and Fired and Why We Need to Fight Back Now,\" and Prof. Gerard de Melo, chair of Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Systems at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam, Germany. The lively discussion, enriched by insightful questions from Prof. de Melo and convincing responses by Prof. Schellmann, focused on the ethical and social implications of #AI, including #privacy concerns, #algorithmicbias, and the impact on employment. Comments from both speakers highlighted the transformative potential and the stark challenges of AI in our society. The discussion, which involved active participation from an engaged audience, also touched on the need for #regulatoryframeworks and #ethicalguidelines to govern AI development and deployment. I highly recommend \"The Algorithm,\" which is written in a very accessible style and provides readers with a comprehensive overview of the current state and future potential of AI, blending engaging narratives with in-depth research. Thank you, @Carsten Ruepke and Anna Ophira Schwarzkopf for the outstanding collaboration!"
