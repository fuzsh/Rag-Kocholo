        "text": "The first AIDHeal Symposium will provide insights into current research on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in healthcare. Experts from Berlin-Brandenburg and around the world are coming together to discuss cutting-edge AI applications in molecular medicine and clinical practice and to explore how digital health technologies will develop in the future.\n\nThe online symposium is aimed at scientists from the basic and applied sciences, at engineering and software development experts, and at medical professionals from all disciplines and levels of experience. Students and PhD candidates as well as interested citizens are also invited to participate in the discussion. The AIDHeal Symposium is organized by the Digital Engineering Faculty and the Potsdam Graduate School of the University of Potsdam, the Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI), the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association (MDC) and Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin (HU Berlin). The symposium will be held in English.\n\nRenowned experts like Dr. Marina Höhne from Technische Universität Berlin, Professor Ariel Dora Stern from the Hasso Plattner Institute and Harvard Business School, and Professor Thomas Fuchs from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, will speak about their current research. Their work touches on key challenges facing our society: What potential does AI have to better understand the causes and effects of disease? How can we use neural networks to improve the predictive power of AI? And what will the healthcare of tomorrow look like? There will also be a series of short talks on artificial intelligence and digital health. Professor Oliver Günther, President of the University of Potsdam, and Professor Thomas Sommer, interim Scientific Director of the MDC, will open the symposium.\n\nDigital Healthcare, Made in Germany\n\nThe newly formed AIDHeal Network, led by spokespersons Professor Christoph Lippert (HPI), Professor Thoralf Niendorf (MDC) and Professor Sonja Greven (HU Berlin), aims to bring together expertise on data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence and digital health in Berlin-Brandenburg. It also seeks to intensify research activities and create new training opportunities in order to increase the international visibility and competitiveness of Digital Healthcare, Made in Germany.\n\nThe AIDHeal Network is comprised of the University of Potsdam, the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Technische Universität Berlin, the Berlin Institute for Health at Charité, the German National Cohort, the Hasso Plattner Institute, the Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics, Berlin Research 50, the Helmholtz Information & Data Science Academy and numerous industry partners.\n\nDate and time: January 28, 2022, 9:30 a.m. – 3:00 p.m., online\n\nFurther information\n\nRegistration and program\n\nData science at the MDC\n\nNiendorf Lab\n\nContact at HU\n\nProf. Sonja Greven\n\nHumboldt-Universität zu Berlin"
