        "text": "Valsight supports value-driver-based planning, forecasting and simulations and the interactive analysis of results. Driver models describe the essential business contexts of a business model and are the basis for flexible, transparent simulations of effects. The creation of driver models can be done by business users in a graphical, no-code, drag-and-drop user interface. To model more complex cause-and-effect relationships, an integrated formula language is also available. The software is available in the cloud (leveraging AWS or other cloud infrastructure providers) and also on premises.\n\nWith Valsight, finance and controlling teams can simulate, analyze and present scenarios flexibly, transparently and quickly. Leveraging the scenario manager, users can directly enter new insights, either derived from a company’s business environment or regarding the development of certain drivers, and then immediately include them in the respective scenario. Driver-based forecasts can be created using automated updates of actual values and may include statistical functions (e.g., LOOKUP, ARIMA). To adjust forecast values, driver-based actions can be entered. With the option to quickly and flexibly create new scenarios, a larger spectrum of values can be calculated and analyzed for each KPI.\n\nPlanning and simulation results can be analyzed ad hoc and interactively via multiple diagrams, dashboards and an integrated presentation mode. Integrated collaboration features and commenting capabilities support data-related discussion of results. Workflow functionality is available as standard to control planning, forecasting and simulation processes. Programming skills are not required to set up and run Valsight, so integration into the existing infrastructure can therefore be completed in a relatively short timeframe. Automatic transfer and simple structuring of basic data via various integration options and interfaces from other systems are provided.\n\nIn addition, Valsight offers consulting support to set up and manage the driver models and simulations as part of the license agreement. Users can opt for a paid pilot phase to experience the benefits of the simulation software.\n\n78 percent of Valsight users are planning users – significantly above the survey average of 69 percent – reflecting the fact that Valsight is essentially a planning, forecasting and simulation tool with supplementary analytics capabilities. This is also born out in its typical use cases. Customers leverage Valsight mainly for financial planning (62 percent) but also operational planning (48 percent). Here, planning takes place at different aggregation levels. Valsight is used for strategic planning (76 percent) and budgeting (48 percent). Besides planning, customers mainly use it for dashboards/BI applications (50 percent), ad hoc query (43 percent) and analysis (37 percent). Many respondents also plan to use it for forecasting (47 percent), strategic planning (22 percent) and operational planning (22 percent) in the future.\n\nValsight targets mid-sized and large companies across all industries. 73 percent of our sample of Valsight customers come from large companies (more than 2,500 employees) with a median of 30 users (including 25 using planning functionality), but the mean of 63 users (50 for planning) indicates there are also some larger implementations.\n\nWith 27 top ranks and 29 leading positions across three different peer groups, Valsight once again achieves an outstanding set of results in this year’s Planning Survey. Convincing ratings in numerous important KPIs help to consolidate its position as an effective planning, forecasting and simulation product that delivers considerable benefits to customers. Companies can benefit from using Valsight in terms of increased transparency of planning, more precise/detailed planning and reduced planning complexity. Overall, these benefits lead to a better quality of planning results for many customers. All the Valsight users surveyed said they would “definitely” or “probably” recommend their planning product to other organizations – a strong result and a great indicator of customer satisfaction with the vendor and its product."
