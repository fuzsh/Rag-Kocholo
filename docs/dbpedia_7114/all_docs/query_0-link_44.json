        "text": "TEDx events are independently organized conferences that seek to create a unique experience by inviting inspiring speakers to share and spread their ideas. TEDxESCPBerlin is entirely organized by students of the ESCP Europe Business School and took place on the Berlin campus.\n\nThe event was held under the topic “World of Opportunities”. In a time with increasing global mobility, we experience new chances for progress every day. Be they big or small, be they in a personal or organizational context – we ourselves decide whether to embrace these opportunities or not. They may seem menacing at first and you may have to gather all your courage to take on the challenge. Still, it is worth it!\n\nWe aim to provide a platform where the smartest thinkers, greatest visionaries, and most fascinating personalities from diverse backgrounds will inspire others and be inspired themselves. They all have in common that they took on a challenging opportunity they were either given or created themselves. Every speaker is given up to 15 minutes to talk about a project he has worked on or any other insight he has gained and would like to spread.\n\nTEDxESCPBerlin…A recap:\n\nOne long journey that began in September 2012 culminated in what was for us one of the greatest days in our lives: TEDxESCPBerlin on February 16th.
