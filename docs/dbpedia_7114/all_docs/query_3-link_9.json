        "text": "When German software giant SAP (SAP ) runs into a glitch, Hasso Plattner, its red-meat-for-breakfast co-CEO, figures out what is wrong and fixes it with his own bare hands, if necessary. That's how he responded in February, 1999, after he got the bad news at an executive retreat that the company was hopelessly behind on the Internet. Unless SAP did something fast, this would end its era of dominance as the leading maker of run-the-company software applications for the world's big corporations.\n\nPlattner reacted like a man shot out of a cannon. In a matter of days, a series of frenetic brainstorming sessions yielded a brand new strategy, which he personally christened mySAP.com. SAP's array of software programs would be made Net-ready before the end of the year, and millions of office workers from Berlin to Bangkok would tap into the Net and their own companies' networks on computer screens with SAP's logo on them. \"We want to be the portal through which businesspeople access everything,\" he said later. \"It's like AOL (AOL )--for corporations.\""
