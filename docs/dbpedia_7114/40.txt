Under Plattner, the Sharks have always been in the playoff hunt but just can’t make it over the hump. Since he first invested, the team has made the playoffs all but two seasons. In that time they’ve collected five division titles, one Presidents’ Trophy and have reached the Stanley Cup Final once.
