Award-winning documentary in which Bert Haanstra portrays the Dutch population with all its peculiarities, all and sundry (Jan en alleman). Many scenes are shot with a hidden camera. In sound and image, Haanstra shows that Dutchmen, all neatly recorded in the municipal register, lived in a very well-organized and orderly country in 1963. Simon Carmiggelt does the voice-over in the film, which attracted more than 1.5 million visitors and won a Golden Bear in Berlin in 1964.
