        "text": "By Ruud Hisgen (Direct Dutch Institute) for IamExpat\n\nIn February each year we are all anxious to see who will receive an Academy Award, or “Oscar”, at the biggest awards night in the film industry. Unfortunately this year no Dutch films, directors or actors have been nominated. So instead – to avoid any awkward silences if you’re discussing the Academy Awards with a Dutch person – we’re diving into film history for you. We look at eight Dutch actors, directors and films that have all won an award at the biggest night in showbiz. So sit back and relax, here’s what you need to know (and which names to drop) when talking Oscars with the Dutch.\n\n1. Audrey Hepburn, “Princess Ann” in Roman Holiday, Best Actress (1953)\n\n1953 was the first year that the Academy Awards ceremony was televised. And who appeared on the tiny screen in millions of homes to accept her award and speak these modest words, “Too much… I am truly, truly grateful and terribly happy”?\n\nYes, this charmingly skinny young woman of 24, whose real name was Audrey Kathleen Ruston (daughter of a British banker and a Dutch baroness) actually grew up in the Netherlands.\n\nAudrey Hepburn was nominated five times in all for best actress and will be remembered forever for her role in Breakfast at Tiffany’s.\n\nDid you know that her debut as a film actress was acutally in a Dutch feature film? No? Then read on!\n\n2. Bert Haanstra, director of Glass, Best Short Documentary (1958)\n\nThe Dutch remember Haanstra (1916-1997) for his funny documentaries like Alleman (The Human Dutch, 1963, voice Peter Ustinov and Simon Carmiggelt) and feature films like Fanfare (1958).\n\nDespite winning an Oscar for his short documentary Glass, Haanstra should have also won for his magnificent drama film Dokter Pulder zaait papavers (Doctor Pulder Sows Poppies) which screened in 1975. If you’ve mastered some Dutch, seek out a copy of this often overlooked film. It’s wonderfully acted and filmed.\n\n3. Charles Huguenot van der Linden, director of This Tiny World, Best Short Documentary (1973)\n\nCharles Huguenot van der Linden (1909-1987) was a Dutch filmmaker who is now completely forgotten. For over fifty years he made beautiful films which were far ahead of his time. Unfortunately he never got his breakthrough.\n\nIn 1948 he made a funny short film for KLM, which was called Nederlands in zeven lessen (Dutch in seven lessons). This film is worth watching because it was the film debut of Audrey Hepburn. And yes, she is speaking Dutch and she looks ravishing.\n\nImagine, Audrey Hepburn’s first acting lines were in Dutch! She says:\n\n“Ik ben stewardess bij de KLM” (I am a stewardess for KLM)\n\n“Moet je me zien in mijn pakje” (you should see me in my ensemble…)\n\nand at the end: “Goodbye!”\n\nTwenty-five years after this short film, Huguenot van der Linden heard that he was nominated for a short documentary about antique toys. He couldn’t imagine himself ever winning this big prize, so he didn’t bother to fly across the ocean. Instead, the American ambassador presented the Oscar to him in The Hague.\n\n4. Børge Ring, director of Anna & Bella, Best Animated Short Film (1984)\n\nBørge Ring (1921) shows two sisters looking and laughing at photos of their younger days together. It’s a poignant eight-minute film which has a surprisingly bitter ending.\n\nAudrey Hepburn accepting the Academy Award for Best Actress, 1954.\n\nNederlands in zeven lessen (Dutch in seven lessons), 1948, directed by Charles Huguenot van der Linden."
