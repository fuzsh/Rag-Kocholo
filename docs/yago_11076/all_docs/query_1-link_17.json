You post, and literally within minutes, I have resumes of people who are available for work now! Changed my life!”\n\n- Ed Horwitz Executive Producer\n\n“Staff Me Up's reputation as the place to go for non-scripted jobs makes sourcing the best candidates easy! The site is very responsive and I'm able to at-a-glance see a candidates entire experience which really speeds up the process.”\n\n- Matthew Deucey Executive Director\n\n“Staff Me Up is the best way I've found to connect with the right people who are available right NOW. When people reply to a job, I know they are ready to work, and their contact information always stays up to date (unlike other production guides or even my own list!)”\n\n- Leslie Wilson Line Producer\n\n“I can't remember the last person I hired where I didn't first go to Staff Me Up. The filters make it so easy: just today I needed a Production Manager, so I looked through who was marked \"Available\" and also had at least eight PM credits, and hired someone 20 minutes later. I'm not sure how line producers ever got along without it.”\n\n“Has Staff Me Up been great for my career? Heck, yes it has! I decided to pay for a year subscription and was called the next day for a job that I applied for, which meant that in that one day of work, my subscription was paid in full. I have 11 additional credits thanks to SMU and more to add. I think the best feature is being able to see when a job poster has reviewed your application. I love SMU.”\n\n“As a producer, Staff Me Up is a dream come true. When I’m ready to book a shoot, it’s the first place that I turn to. I use it every week to hire crews nationwide for projects of all scales. The interface helps me identify top candidates in a quick and efficient way, and connect with local and remote freelancers to develop ongoing professional relationships.”\n\n“Staff Me Up has more jobs in television and broadcasting production than any other job website I've subscribed to. I love that it is specialized to this field -- other job sites just don't understand the nuances in production.”\n\n“Staff Me Up is more than a staffing site. It’s a community of industry professionals from every level of production. It’s an amazing tool that has saved me time and money in the hiring process. It has helped me find long-term employees as well as last minute hires.”\n\n“Staff Me Up has been evolving into the best online service I have found as a freelancer in over 15 years of working in the industry. Being somewhat off the beaten path, near Pittsburgh, PA, I find there are many quality jobs posted on the site in my region that I can apply to. The work alerts are clean and easy to use, and I can filter jobs in a way that works for me. I have been booking at least a job a month through Staff Me Up.”"
