Haanstra made many documentaries and documentary shorts. I’m posting two for you to check out, here: one is called Glas (1958), and the other, Zoo (1961). Both titles are self-explanatory: Glas shows us glass-blowers inside a Dutch factory; Zoo watches people and animals walk around a zoo. Or, if you like, a dierentuin.\n\nThis is Glas:\n\nIt reminds me of the sequences that used to air on “Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood” when I was younger–do you know which ones I mean? They would take the viewer inside a peanut butter factory, for instance. Haanstra’s version is, of course, much more sophisticated. I love the way the glass blowers are made to seem like jazz musicians, inflating their cheeks like trumpeters."
