        "text": "YILMAZ GUNEY'S ''Yol,'' which will be shown at the New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center today at 9:30 P.M. and tomorrow at 6:15 P.M. is a big, angry epic of contemporary Turkey, a film whose political and ethnic concerns are likely to be equated -wrongly - with cinematic achievement.\n\n''Yol'' comes to New York decorated with honors. It shared the top prize at this year's Cannes Film Festival with Costa-Gavras's far more accomplished ''Missing'' and, in addition, it took two other subsidiary Cannes awards, the International Critics' Prize and the International Catholic Prize.\n\nMr. Guney, the film's writer and director, is now as much of a legend throughout Europe as in his native Turkey, where he has spent a lot of the last 20 years in jail on various political charges. An actor and an author as well as a film writer and director, he is obviously a personality to be reckoned with. Among other accomplishments, he directed three films from his prison cell, writing their screenplays in minute detail, and then attending to the casting and the shooting via couriers.\n\nMost of ''Yol'' was apparently shot in this manner. As the production neared completion, Mr. Guney escaped from jail and fled to an unidentified European country where he edited the footage himself. When he arrived at Cannes for the film's official presentation, the critics and the public went wild with excited praise.\n\nHere, clearly, was a more romantic and more dedicated figure than any fiction film - including ''Yol'' - is likely to present. Mr. Guney sounds like a fascinating man, but it would be overstating the case to suggest that ''Yol'' should be shelved and the director put into release instead.\n\n''Yol'' is a large, decent, ponderous panorama of a movie about five prisoners in one of Turkey's ''open'' prisons - this one on the island of Imrali in the Sea of Marmara - who receive one-week passes to visit their families in eastern Turkey. They include one fellow whose wife has betrayed him. The woman is being held prisoner, in chains, by her family in a remote mountain village until the husband decides what should be done with her.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
