        "text": "A master of startling imagery, vigorous storytelling, and political commitment, Yilmaz Güney (1931–1984) is a legendary figure in Turkish cinema and undoubtedly the best-known and most controversial filmmaker the country has produced to date. While pursuing degrees in law and economics, Güney made a name for himself as a talented writer of fiction whose political outspokenness landed him briefly in prison. After becoming a comedic star, Güney founded his own production company in the 1960s just as Turkey was experiencing political unrest. Imprisoned for the murder of a right-wing judge—the facts of which remain obscure and controversial—Güney completed three scripts which resulted in 1978’s The Herd and 1982’s Yol (Palme d’Or winner at the Cannes International Film Festival) before escaping prison in 1981. Often compared to Pier Paolo Pasolini, the two filmmakers were both controversial political figures before they directed films and tragically died in their mid-50s at the height of their fame. The series continues April 6–7.\n\nThanks to Erju Ackman (freelance film programmer) and David Pendleton (Harvard Film Archive). Film descriptions courtesy of Harvard Film Archive."
