        "text": "Before dawn on September 12, 1980, a right-wing military junta took power in Turkey. Between 1980 and 1985, the military government arrested 750,000 members of the Turkish student movement; blacklisted 1,683,000; tried 230,000 in 210,000 lawsuits; sentenced 7,000 to death; revoked the citizenship of 17,000; and denied 388,000 the right to obtain a passport. The government admits that 400 people disappeared (the true number is undeniably higher); another 400 died in prison. This military intervention was directly connected to actions taken by the United States government. The Carter administration’s involvement in the coup was later acknowledged by former National Security Council specialist and CIA Ankara Station Chief Paul Henze, who reported to Carter: “Our boys did it”. Below is a glossary the artist compiled pertaining to the history of this coup d’état.\n\nCarter Doctrine: In 1979, the Iranian Revolution and the subsequent end of the US-Iranian intelligence relationship created a gap in the CIA’s coverage of the southern part of the Soviet Union and a reduction in US military installations near the oil-rich Persian Gulf. This led to the formulation of the policy, Carter Doctrine, proclaimed by the US President Jimmy Carter in his January 1980 State of the Union address: the US would use military force to defend its national interests in the region.\n\nPaul Henze: Paul B. Henze (1924 – 19 May 2011) was a former CIA and National Security Council specialist in psychological operations. Henze was the CIA station chief stationed in Turkey and Ethiopia during the 1970s and ’80s. He served in the Carter administration as a deputy to National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski.\n\nTurkish Army Special Warfare Department (SWD): The Turkish Army Special WarfareDepartment, commonly known under the acronym SWD, was the special forces unit of the Turkish Army. Founded in 1965, the SWD was funded and trained directly by the United States. During the Cold War, they closely cooperated with the CIA, and they supported the Grey Wolves in their violent campaign comprising bomb attacks and mass shootings that killed thousands of people, including students, lawyers, journalists, public officials, and labor organizers from 1970 until the 1980 coup d’état.\n\nThe Grey Wolves: The Grey Wolves, officially known under the name Ülkü Ocakları, are a Turkish far-right ultranationalist organization. Known members of the Grey Wolves were involved in assassinations of activists, students, intellectuals, labor organizers, officials and journalists between 1976 and 1980. Due to their consistent use of political assassination and violence, the organization became known as the \"death squad\" performing public killings. According to Turkish authorities, 220 Grey Wolves’ members carried out at least 694 murders. Non-governmental estimates of their victims range from 5000 to 6000 across the late 70s. Their most violent political attack was the Maraş massacre , committed in December 1978, as they killed over 100 Alevis. They are also alleged to have been the force behind the Taksim Square massacre of May 1, 1977.\n\nAlevism: The Alevis are a minority group in Turkey, and account for approximately 25 percent of the population. As a minority group, the Alevis have had a long political tradition of defending other persecuted and oppressed populations. Therefore, Alevis turned in large numbers to leftist and socialist movements during the 1970s and 1980s. Individuals from Tunceli played a key role in left labor organizations, and as retaliation from the government, their community suffered political violence and oppression subsequent to the 1980 military coup.\n\nMaraş Massacre: The Maraş massacre is the name commonly given to the mass killing of more than a hundred Alevi civilians in the city of Kahramanmaraş, Turkey, in December 1978. The 23rd of December, the far-right organisation of the Grey Wolves stormed the quarters where Alevis resided in Kahramanmaraş, destroying habitations and shops. Many key buildings of public and political life, including the local office of the DİSK , were destroyed. The casualties were brutal: more than 111 people were killed, and hundreds of Alevi-owned houses and shops were destroyed. Although 500 perpetrators of the incident were later indicted by the Turkish government, the investigation and its results were kept classified by the government. The real political force behind the organisation of the incident was never identified.\n\nTunceli: Originally known as Dersim, Tunceli is a province located in the Eastern Anatolia Region of Turkey. Tunceli is the only province in Turkey with an Alevi majority.\n\nMetin Kemal Kahraman: Metin Kemal Kahraman are an Alevi folk band, formed in 1991 by the two eponymous brothers. The band included at times other musicians, such as Serdar Keskin from Istanbul and Dorothea Marien from Berlin. Metin Kahraman was the first in his family to become involved in politics. Spending months in prison for his political engagement after the military coup of 1980, he moved to Istanbul from Tunceli upon his release. His brother, Kemal Kahraman, after moving to Ankara to attend university, joined Devrimci Yol in 1987, following the footsteps of his brother in his engagement with the Turkish left. After a demonstration protesting the treatment of Palestinian youth in Israel, he was arrested. Unlike Metin, Kemal experienced extensive torture, and spent several years in prison. Upon his release in 1991, he moved to Germany for asylum. They started recording music at that time, between Berlin and Istanbul. Building on their familiarity with Alevi oral poetry and the political music of the 1970s, the brothers extensive musical oeuvre attempted to bridge both traditions over their five albums. Metin Kemal Kahraman’s seminal third album, Yaşlılar Dersim Türküleri Söylüyor , is an effort in the documentation of a long oral tradition, being a collection of poetry and songs performed by elderly men and women from Tunceli .\n\nTaksim Square Massacre: The Taksim Square Massacre is the name given to the mass killing of protestors on the 1st of May 1977 in Taksim Square, Istanbul, Turkey. The May Day protest was organised by DİSK , and was attacked by anonymous armed men. Casualty figures vary between 34 and 42 persons killed, and 126 and 220 injured. Over 500 demonstrators were later detained by the Turkish government, and 98 demonstrators were indicted. None of the perpetrators were caught or indicted. The massacre was part of the wave of political violence perpetrated by the Grey Wolves that marred Turkey in the 1970s.\n\nBloody Sunday: “Bloody Sunday” is the name given to the counter-revolutionary response to a leftist protest that occurred on February 16, 1969, in Istanbul's Beyazıt Square. Students, as well as labor party supporters and union members gathered in Beyazıt square to protest the arrival of the American Sixth Fleet in the Bosphorus, which they saw as another symbol of US imperialism, and of the support the Turkish government was providing to America’s imperialist efforts. Meanwhile, unknown to protestors, members of the Grey Wolves were planning the violent suppression of the leftist protest. Around four pm, protesters were attacked at Taksim Square, and the clash turned bloody. The day resulted in the death of two protestors and numerous injuries. The 1977 Taksim Square Massacre is sometimes referred to as the Turkey’s \"second Bloody Sunday\".\n\nDİSK: The Confederation of Progressive Trade Unions of Turkey (Türkiye Devrimci İşçi Sendikaları Konfederasyonu, or DİSK) is a radical labour union founded in 1967 as a breakaway from the Confederation of Turkish Trade Unions. After the 1980 military coup, the National Security Council suspended the activities of DİSK and its affiliated unions. All their assets were confiscated and put under trustee administration. 52 DİSK leaders were arrested and put on trial with the threat of the death penalty. The military court decided in 1981 to close DİSK and to ban its members from political life.\n\nYılmaz Güney: Born Yılmaz Pütün, Yılmaz Güney was a Kurdish film director, scenarist, novelist, and actor, whose devoted his career to representing the resilience and the plight of working class people in Turkey. In September 1980, Güney's works were banned by the military junta, and he was sentenced to be incarcerated for nine years. After escaping from prison in 1981 and fleeing to France, Güney won the Palme d'Or at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival for his film Yol. Güney’s films made a striking use of the split between image and sound to conjure displacement and disorientation, evoking the sense of loss caused by militarism. Creating a cinematic language that transgressed his condition of incarceration, most of Güney’s movies were filmed by his collaborators Zeki Ökten and Şerif Gören, while Güney was incarcerated for his political opinions.\n\nYol: Translated as “The Road,” Yol is a 1982 Turkish film directed by Şerif Gören and Yılmaz Güney. The screenplay was written by Yılmaz Güney, and it was directed by his assistant Şerif Gören while Güney was incarcerated. In 1981, when Güney escaped from prison, he edited the film himself in Paris. The film is a portrait of Turkey in the aftermath of the 1980 Turkish coup d'état: the interwoven destinies of the people and the authorities are shown through the stories of five prisoners given a week's leave.\n\nİlhan Erdost: İlhan Erdost was a Turkish publisher and worked for Sol Yayinlari, a social justice oriented publication house. After the 1980 coup, he was taken into custody for possessing and printing banned publications. The book whose possession occasioned the arrest was Friedrich Engels’ Dialectics of Nature . Ilhan Erdost was beaten to death by soldiers the 7th of November 1980 in Mamak Prison.\n\nMetris Military Prison: Metris Military Prison is a state penitentiary in the Esenler district of Istanbul. The facility was established by the Ministry of National Defence on April 17, 1981, for use as the main incarceration center during the martial law era which followed the coup . The artist’s mother was incarcerated in Metris military prison from 1981 to 1984 for her political views. Twenty-nine inmates escaped from Metris on March 25, 1988, while it was still being administered by the military. Of the escapees, eleven were sentenced to the death penalty, and eight to life imprisonment. They were all members of leftist organizations such as TKP/ML, the Revolutionary Path (DEV-YOL) and the Communist Party of Turkey.\n\nDevrimci Yol: Devrimci Yol (The Revolutionary Path), commonly known as DEV-YOL, was a Turkish political movement with many supporters across Turkish trade unions. Devrimci Yol entered the political scene in Turkey on 1 May 1977 as a revolutionary party who emphasized anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggles. More than 30,000 members of DEV-YOL were jailed in the four months following the military coup. Members of DEV-YOL were detained all across Turkey, and tried in military courts. The defence in the main trial of members of Devrimci Yol at Ankara Military Court included the following lines: \"In many areas of life and many cities in Turkey, followers of Devrimci Yol can be found. They carry the name because they defend a common political view on the fight against fascism and the general problems of the revolutionary fight in our country.\"\n\nİbrahim Kaypakkaya: İbrahim Kaypakkaya was a political activist and the founder of the revolutionary fraction of the Turkish Communist Party (TKP/ML). After being brutally tortured by the military for over 4 months, Kaypakkaya was executed in Diyarbakir Prison in 1973. He was only twenty-four years old at the time. Despite his youth, he was a key activist in Turkey, known for his defence of Kurdish cultural self-determination and his class critique of Kemalist ideology, the state program established by the founder of the Turkish Republic Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. After his execution, Kaypakkaya became a symbol of revolutionary solidarity to his supporters during the times of martial law.\n\nF-Type Prison: Officially called F-type High Security Closed Institutions, F-Type Prisons are high-security prisons designated by the Turkish Law 5275 on the Execution of Sentences, which directed that prisoners sentenced to aggravated life sentences would be held in isolated cells. They were created in 2000 by the Turkish government to house prisoners in single cells and to succeed to the former model of open ward prisons."
