His father, Hamit Pütün, was a Zaza-Kurd and his mother, Güllü Pütün, was a Kurmancî-Kurd. He regarded himself as an “assimilated Kurd.” His parents moved to Adana where they worked as laborers in cotton fields. He studied law and economics at the University of Ankara and Istanbul. As evident from his filmography, Güney worked as an actor’s assistant before becoming a director. He first appeared as an actor in Atif Yilmaz's <em>This Land’s Children</em> then he started working with Atif Yilmaz as an apprentice screenwriter and assistant. He played the lead role in Atif Yilmaz’s 1958 film<em> This Land’s Children</em> and made his directing debut in the 1966 film, <em>At Avrat Silah</em>, in which he also served as director and lead actor, learning from his experiences in the industry rather than from any formal schooling in the country’s film schools.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Güney worked for nearly two decades and a half, directing around twenty films.

He made his first film <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274343/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 153, 0);\">At Avrat Silah</a>, or Horse, Woman, Gun, it’s a story about the main character Alicik, who was raised on the mountain like a son, who crosses paths with a pristine mayfly. The two's love for one another makes life difficult. Five years later, Güney directed another film called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umut_(film)\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 153, 0);\">Umut</a> (1970) in which an illiterate horse taxi driver named Cabbar, performed by Güney, is instructed to use the proceeds of an old phaeton with two worn-out, half-dead horses to support his large Kurdish family. The family struggles to survive in filthy, wet quarters while Cabbar's business is not doing well. Despite his debt, he keeps buying lottery tickets, which are his only remaining source of hope. He ventures into the desert searching for a fabled sunken treasure after a luxurious Mercedes parked next to the sidewalk struck the horse. Cabbar is left weak after the incident and realizes that the \"poor and strong\" benefit from the current order. The film concludes with an interesting and memorable scene in which Cabbar, who has abandoned his wife, children, and mother in the pursuit of treasure, opens his hands to a God he does not know and begins to turn around in the middle of arid lands. He's gone insane. The film was banned by Turkey's <em>Film Control Commission</em> at the time of its initial release, but went on to win prizes at the second prize in the Adana Golden Boll Film Festival, the seventh in the Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival, and was screened at the 23rd Cannes Film Festival in 1970.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of Güney’s greatest and most famous films,<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yol\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 153, 0);\"> <em>Yol</em> </a>(1982), follows the story of three families searching for freedom.

Güney creates the characters’ Kurdish identities using specific strategies so that the characters’ struggles serve as a metaphor for the struggles of all Kurds living within the Turkish state, even though the film is in the Turkish language and none of the characters ever explicitly identify as being Kurds. Instead, he incorporates the Kurdish struggle into specific cinematic techniques to avoid showing it as the primary source of the anguish and sorrow that his characters go through. For example, <a href=\"https://libstore.ugent.be/fulltxt/RUG01/002/785/471/RUG01-002785471_2019_0001_AC.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(255, 153, 0);\">Kurdish references</a> are not obvious but are hidden in discussions about resistance, folkloric music, language, and guerilla chants. For example, in <em>Yöl</em> two Kurdish characters in the film, Omer and Seyit, face difficulties with their traditions.

Güney portrayed Kurdish identities in this film using clothing, music, symbolism, character names, and location.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yilmaz Güney is one of the most important and influential figures in Kurdish cinema and was perhaps the first Kurdish director to depict the Kurdish identity in Turkish cinema. He captured the essence of Kurdish life with his style and approach, while also using it as a metaphor for Turkish society. His films are full of love, beauty, and death, but they also reflect the oppression and repression that pervade Kurdish citizens' lives in every way. On September 9, 1984, in Paris, France, Yilmaz Güney died of stomach cancer and was laid to rest in Paris's Père Lachaise Cemetery. His work continues to impact modern filmmakers who openly acknowledge his influence.
