        "text": "A graduate from the influential IDHEC film school, Marin Karmitz was initially assistant director to the filmmakers Jean-Luc Godard, AgnÃ¨s Varda, Jacques Rozier, Yannick Bellon and Pierre Kast. In 1964, he directed his first short film, Nuit noire Calcutta, based on a screenplay by Marguerite Duras. In 1965, he worked with Samuel Beckett on the adaptation of ComÃ©die. In the same year, the film was selected to open Venice International Film Festival and shocked audiences with its avant-garde material. Forty years later, the film would be recognized at the Venice Biennale and shown in museums around the world. Marin Karmitzâs first feature-length film was Seven Days Somewhere Else with Jacques Higelin in 1967, which was also selected at Venice International Film Festival. After May â68, he directed two films: Comrades (1970) and Blow for Blow (1972), which would be screened at all the international festivals. After founding mk2 Productions in 1967, Marin Karmitz launched a distribution company in 1974: mk2 diffusion.\n\nBeing unable to find distributors and operators to promote his politically charged films, Marin Karmitz opened â14-juillet Bastilleâ (future mk2 Bastille) in 1974. It had three screens in an area unfamiliar with art-house world cinema, with theatres showing only karate and pornographic films at that time. mk2 diffusion enabled him to build A library of international films that the established networks rejected, which would be shown at â14-juillet Bastilleâ. A forum for stimulation and protest where numerous debates were held, â14-juillet Bastilleâ laid the foundations for the model that mk2 has been developing for over forty years: screening films in their original version. It also redesigned the interior of traditional theatres with a piece by GÃ©rard Fromanger in the foyer, a bookstore and exhibition space.\n\nFrom 1974 onwards, the â14-juilletâ cinemas helped developing the opportunity of seeing films in their original version in Paris. The takeover of Studio Parnasse in 1976, a cinema founded in 1931 which was transformed into the iconic mk2 Parnasse with three screens, then of â14-juilletâ Beaugrenelle in 1979 (four screens then six), put mk2 on Parisâs cinematographic map and allowed it to promote diverse, thought-provoking filmmaking. mk2 continued to produce feature-length films and gained international renown in 1977, winning the Palme dâOr at Cannes Film Festival with Paolo and Vittorio Tavianiâs Padre Padrone.\n\nThe 1980s marked mk2âs commitment to promoting quality filmmaking from around the world. After producing Marco Bellocchioâs A Leap in the Dark (1980) and Jean-Luc Godardâs Every Man for Himself (1980) in particular, mk2 presented eight films to the Cannes Film Festival in 1982 and won five awards, including the Palme dâOr for Yilmaz GÃ¼neyâs Yol, The Road, the Jury Prize for the Taviani brothersâ The Night of San Lorenzo, Best Screenplay for Jerzy Skolimowskiâs Moonlighting and the Golden Camera for Romain Goupilâs Half a Life.\n\nRelying on its critical and commercial success, particularly after producing Francis Girodâs The Good Pleasure in 1984, mk2 established its position in French cinema and consecutively produced Claude Chabrolâs Cop Au Vin in 1985 (for whom Marin Karmitz would produce eleven other films), Alain Resnaisâs MÃ©lo in 1986, Etienne Chatiliezâs Life is a Long Quiet River in 1988 and Louis Malleâs Au revoir les enfants, which won the Golden Lion in Venice in 1986 and seven CÃ©sars in 1988. 1988 also brought the success of Claude Chabrolâs Story of Women, which mk2 produced, and Percy Adlonâs Bagdad CafÃ©, which it distributed. mk2 became the leading French distributor.\n\nTen years after the takeover of the Paramount OdÃ©on following the collapse of the Parafrance network, which led to mk2 OdÃ©on in 1986 (five screens), mk2 moved into the boathouses created by Gustave Eiffel for the 1878 World Fair. The opening of the â14-Juillet-sur-Seineâ in 1996, which had six screens in the heart of Parisâs 19th arrondissement, allowed mk2 to develop its vision of cinema, making it a forum for stimulation that revitalized life in the community and a platform at the crossroads of the arts, developed with artists and designers. A crack den in Paris, the Stalingrad area was deserted after dark by its residents and tradesmen. Heckled at first by local youths, the 14-Juillet-sur-Seine teams involved them in the cinema, making it a focal point that had something for everyone. The community venture led to a film, Jacques Doillonâs Little Fellas, which was released in 1999.\n\nThe 1990s were also marked by the first collaborations with two major filmmakers in its cinematographic history: Krzysztof Kieslowski, for whom Marin Karmitz produced the Three Colours trilogy (1993â1995), and Abbas Kiarostami with The Wind Will Carry Us (1999). To date, mk2 has produced four other Kiarostami films, ABC Africa (2001), Ten (2002), Certified Copy (2010) and Like Someone in Love (2012), and distributed two others, Five in 2005 and Shirin in 2010. The company brought together all its activities under the name âmk2â in 1998.\n\nmk2 expanded its catalogue, first by acquiring FranÃ§ois Truffautâs production company in 1999, Les Films du carrosse, which enabled mk2 to distribute the directorâs work, then in 2000 by acquiring a major catalogue, CIBY 2000, which included the films of Mike Leigh, David Lynch and Emir Kusturica. In 2001, the Chaplin family outsourced the representation of all its titles to mk2. With the creation of âmk2 Ã©ditionsâ in 1999, mk2 DVDs gained a world-recognition for editing, by developing unique savoir-faire in producing innovative content with directors and industry professionals. Continuing its publishing activities, mk2 founded its free monthly magazine TROISCOULEURS in 2002, which presents film and entertainment news from Paris. That same year, the creation of mk2 multimedia (future mk2 agency) enabled the group to diversify its activities and unique positioning, using its expertise in advertising and communication.\n\nThrough its distribution activities, and particularly its âmk2 dÃ©couvertesâ (âmk2 discoveriesâ) collection, mk2 has been able to bring Bolivian, Senegalese, Iranian, Bangladeshi, South Korean, Danish and Russian films into cinemas, to mention just a few. In the early 2000s, mk2 won the Palme dâOr with Gus Van Santâs Elephant in 2003. Afterwards, mk2 distributed Gerry (2004) and Last Days (2005) and produced Paranoid Park in 2007, which won the 60th Anniversary Award at the Cannes Film Festival. After producing Michael Hanekeâs Code Unknown (2000), mk2 also produced his film The Piano Teacher in the following year, which won the Grand Prix at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, as well as the Best Actor Award for Benoit Magimel and the Best Actress Award for Isabelle Huppert, who would receive a CÃ©sar for the role in 2002.\n\nThe first half of the 2000s marked a turning point in mk2âs operational activity with the opening of the mk2 BibliothÃ¨que complex (fourteen screens, progressively extended to twenty today) in 2003 and the launch of mk2 Quai-de-Loire in 2005. The former has two restaurants, a store, cafÃ© and bar. Located in the heart of a fast-growing area, at the foot of Franceâs National Library, it was developed with designers: Martin Szekely created a seat for two (Loveseatâ¢), the lightning was designed by Jacques Bobroff and the plates of the CafÃ© BibliothÃ¨que by Sonia Rykiel. With the aim of creating a meeting point for all forms of artistic expression, mk2 opened its cinema with an exhibition of the biggest artists from Rue Louise Weiss, the epicentre of Parisâs galleries in the early 2000s. Quai-de-Loire was also developed with artists and designers: the store was outfitted by TsÃ© & TsÃ© and its neon exterior was created by Martial Raysse, where he placed his piece SinÃ©ma, les anges sont avec toi. A statue by Martial Raysse has also been placed at the exit to the screens in mk2 BibliothÃ¨que.\n\nWhen the UGC unlimited card was launched in 2000, mk2 partnered PathÃ© to create an alternative cinema pass and so balance the Parisian market. But mk2 was evicted from the Beaugrenelle centre and lost control of the mk2 Beaugrenelle cinema in 2007, which had been sold to PathÃ©. mk2 ended its partnership with PathÃ© and joined UGC, creating a card that offers access to the worldâs best range of unlimited cinema and opening the doors to the biggest networks and independent theatres.\n\nAfter taking the helm of mk2 in 2005, NathanaÃ«l Karmitz involved the company in the technological transition, making it the first fully digital cinema network in 2009. The gamble paid off and in 2009 mk2 BibliothÃ¨que generated the biggest audience for James Cameronâs Avatar, the first major 3D event in modern filmmaking, in France. The technology cut cinema from its ties and enabled another operating model: the first private made-to-measure cinema, Germain Paradisio, was launched in 2010. The cinema has a wide range of films in its digital catalogue and 24 seats in the heart of the Saint-Germain area, in a luxurious venue designed by India Madhavi. Five other made-to-measure cinemas in unusual locations soon followed: Silencio in a club designed by David Lynch (2011), Miss Cinema and Madame Cinema in the Palais de Tokyo (2014), and one screen at the heart of the MusÃ©e de la Chasse (2016).\n\nForty years after its creation, mk2 exported its programming model and vision of the cinema to Spain. In 2014, mk2 acquired Andalusiaâs leading network, Cinesur, which had 9 cinemas and 110 screens. Over there, mk2 developed at a regional scale the work of revaluation of urban space started in Paris with the opening of mk2 Bastille in 1974. To achieve this, mk2 apply the same formula of its success: a new programming of original version films with subtilties, combining independent and popular cinemas, retrospectives, festivals and cultural events.\n\nmk2âs Spanish network continued to expand in Madrid with the acquisition of the Palacio de Hielo in 2017, the cityâs largest cinema, as well as Cinepaz in 2021. Therefore, mk2 has the biggest cinema network in Andalusia, making the group the 3rd largest operator in Spain, with 5 million admissions in 2019.\n\nIn 2008, Elisha Karmitz founded mk2 Agency which became MK2+ in 2019. As an advertising agency and creative studio, MK2+ designs communication campaigns and special events for brands and cultural institutions.\n\nSince 2016 and the launch of mk2 VR, the first permanent room dedicated to virtual reality in Europe, MK2+ has been developing an expertise in the production and distribution of immersive experiences. MK2+ has distributed a virtual reality solution for professionals around the world, including a collaboration with Paris Saint-Germain for the creation of an interactive and immersive tour of the Parc des Princes produced and operated by MK2+: PSG Experience.\n\nPursuing its commitment to auteur cinema, mk2 films continues to promote recognized or promising filmmakers and talents who share an original perspective on the world. In 2010, Juliette Binoche won the Best Actress Award in Cannes for Abbas Kiarostamiâs Certified Copy, which mk2 produced. 2010 also marked mk2âs first collaboration with the Quebecois director Xavier Dolan, for whom it distributed Heartbeats. mk2 has since produced Laurence Anyways (2012), Tom at the Farm (FIPRESCI Award in Venice, 2014) and Itâs Only the End of the World (Canneâs Grand Prix in 2016) and distributed Mommy (Jury Prize in Cannes and Best Foreign Film, 2014) in France.\n\nMost recently, mk2 co-produced Pawel Pawlikowskiâs Cold War (Directorâs Prize at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival), or Joachim Trierâs The Worst person in the World (Best Actress Award for Renate Reinsve at the Cannes Film Festival 2021), and exported CÃ©line Sciammaâs Portrait of a Lady on Fire (Screenplay Award at Cannes in 2019) and Carla SimÃ³nâs AlcarrÃ s (Golden Bear at Berlin in 2022).\n\nIn 2018, Marin Karmitz received the Golden Palm of Honor at the Cannes Film Festival for his entire career.\n\nIn 2019, mk2 continues to support the fight for democratization and access to culture that Marin Karmitz has been leading for the past 50 years with a new special offer for young audience: â¬4.90 per ticket for those under 26.\n\nSince the opening of the first mk2 theater in 1974, mk2 cinemas mostly represent gateways to the world and spaces of exchange and debate that allow citizen commitment. mk2 Institut extends this vision by programming conferences with personalities from the intellectual and cultural world, inviting discussion to imagine the world of today and tomorrow. Among the participants, Esther Duflo, FranÃ§ois Sureau, and Fran Lebowitz have been featured.\n\nIn 2020, mk2 launched mk2 Curiosity, a very unique video-on-demand platform that offers a selection of free films every week, selected by mk2 programmers.\n\nIn 2010, mk2 created the Paradiso brand to rethink the cinema experience by reinventing the pre- and post-screening phases. Paradiso has become the laboratory for new approaches to cinema with the CinÃ©ma Paradiso festivals, which combines cinematic, musical and gastronomic experiences in exceptional locations. After the success of the 2013 and 2015 editions at the Grand Palais, the festival now takes place in the cour CarrÃ©e of the Louvre Museum since 2019. CinÃ©ma Paradiso has become a must in the Capital and is now available in a more intimate and mobile version: CinÃ©club Paradiso at La Seine Musicale since 2020, but also for the first time outside of Paris, at the Villa Carmignac on the island of Porquerolles, in 2022.\n\nFollowing on from Paradiso festivals, in 2021 mk2 opened the Hotel Paradiso, the worldâs first cinema-hotel, in the heart of eastern Paris. Through a high-quality hotel service, the Hotel Paradiso makes cinema an art of living by offering unique cinema experiences: rooms equipped with a giant screen and projector, cinema karaoke, and open-air cinema on the roof.\n\nThey have been produced by mk2\n\nJean-Charles Tacchella (1974), Gerhard Schirmbeck et Serge July (1975), Paolo et Vittorio Taviani (1977, 1982, 1985, 1987), Yannick Bellon (1978), JosÃ©e Dayan et Malika Ribowska (1979), Marco Bellocchio (1980), Jean-Luc Godard (1981), Jean-Louis Comolli (1981), Ken Loach (1981, 1987), Yilmaz GÃ¼ney (1982, 1983), Jerzy Skolimowski (1982), Romain Goupil (1982), Patrick Blossier (1982), Francis Girod (1984), Alain Tanner (1985, 1986), Claude Chabrol (1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1991, 1992, 1994, 1995, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2002), Jacques Doillon (1985, 1998), Ruy Guerra (1986), Alain Resnais (1986, 1989), ThÃ©o Angepoulos (1986), Luigi Comencini (1987), Louis Malle (1987), Etienne Chatiliez (1988), Claire Denis (1988), Pavel Lounguine (1990), Jean-Claude Gallotta (1991), CÃ©dric Klapisch (1992), Lucian Pintilie (1992, 1994, 1996, 1998), Djibril Diop Mambety (1992), Bartabas (1993, 1996), Krzysztof Kieslowski (1993, 1994), Jiri Menzel (1994), Pierre Grange (1995), Mohsen Makhmalbaf (1996, 1997, 1998), Charles Belmont (1997), Arturo Ripstein (1997), Lodge Kerrigan (1998), Samira Makhmalbaf (1998), Abbas Kiarostami (1999, 2001, 2002, 2010, 2012), Jonathan Nossiter (1999), Dante Desarthe (2000), Michael Haneke (2000, 2001), Tareque Masud (2002), RaphaÃ«l Nadjari (2002), Philippe Leclerc (2003), Hong Sang-Soo (2003, 2005), Michelle Porte (2003), Serge Frydman (2004), Gus van Sant (2007), Olivier Assayas (2009, 2012), Abdellatif Kechiche (2010), Walter Salles (2012), Xavier Dolan (2012, 2014, 2016), Jia Zhang-Ke (2015, 2017), Pawel Pawlikowski (2017)"
