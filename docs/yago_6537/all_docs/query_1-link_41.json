        "text": "Four years ago, in Paris, I was shown a film by young Turkish director, Yilmaz Guney. It was called “Umut,” the Turkish word for “hope,” and I liked it very much. The film maker, also “Umurs” leading actor, was in jail - for a second time. He had been imprisoned at the age 20 because of a short story he had written which the Turkish Government of the time considered Communist propaganda. His second conviction was on a political charge: Guney had provided harbor for antiGovernment agitators.\n\nMaker - now in jail - and ponders the nature of violence, of politics and of art.\n\nAt that time there was talk of a general amnesty for political prisoners and, to urge amnesty in the case of Yilmaz Guney, wrote an appreciation of “Umut‐ for the Istanbul newspaper, Milliyet.

Top: Prisoners (none of them in prison garb) move around freely in Toptashi's central dormitory a grotesque motion for them something to be ridiculed. After I'd seen the film, for the rest of that day, I felt anxious about them. “What's going to happen to those people?” I asked.\n\nIn a Turkish jail Yilmaz Guney read my text. My question, he told friends, gave him the idea for his next film. Freed from prison and filled with a passion for his new project, he wrote the scenario swiftly, collected his actors and technicians and began to turn the cameras at a resort called Yumurtalik on the south coast of Turkey.\n\nNot for long. A few days after he began filming, he was again in jail. was informed that he had killed a man ‐a judge.\n\nAfew weeks ago, was in Turkey again, this time as a guest of the Prime Minister, Bulent Ecevit, whom I'd met in New York. He had asked me then what my interest in Turkey was. “I'm writing a novel,” I said. “I hope by what I write or, later, film that I can bring Turkey and Greece little closer together. That's my ambition.”\n\n“That's my ambition too,” he said. some silver cigarette box on his table. It was inscribed with the signature of Constantine Caramanlis, the Prime Minister of Greece. At Mr. Ecevit's suggestion, they had met at a Swiss resort, talked, and become friends.\n\nMr. Ecevit's own hope is to liberalize Turkish life and I benefited from that. He provided me with a car and a chauffeur who was instructed to take me anywhere I wanted to go; with a professor of history, Mete Tuncay, to answer my questions; and with Mrs. Canan Gerede, a film maker and scriptwriter, to bridge the gap to any peasant woman might want to talk to. He also insisted on giving me a bodyguard: There had been more than 550 killings by terrorists in his country within a year.\n\nWe drove a total of 2,500 miles through western Turkey. Istanbul was our last stop and there I was urged by friends to visit Yilmaz Guney in jail. was glad to go, not only because wanted to meet Guney, but also because of my reaction to the film “Midnight Express.” which I'd seen before left New York. While that film is well made technically and its atmosphere of Istanbul streets vivid, I thought it racist at the core. Movies have always doted on unredeemable villains, and sadism has become a variety of entertainment. “Midnight Express” was presentation of the blood‐guzzling Turk with which I was all too familiar.\n\nMy people are Anatolian Greeks, a minority subject to the Turks since the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Even in the best of times, they lived by the Turks’ mercy and, inevitably, by their own cleverness and guile. They became famous for it. When my uncle brought us to America in 1913 (I was 4 years old), it was a liberation psychologically as well as physically.\n\nOne of my earliest memories: 1 am in my grandmother's warm, scented bed (cloves and garlic) and she is telling me stories in Turkish. They are good stories and I fight off sleep. My grandmother knew no Greek, even read her Bible in Turkish. What Turkish I still have dates from those days. Some of her tales were funny, telling of tricks the Greek subject people played on the Turk‐how sly those infidels, the gayvius, had to be to survive! Other tales were of terror; incidents from a massacre she'd witnessed.\n\nI rememberthe first time I went back to Turkey as a grown man. I was almost 50, had a reputation and so forth, but my mother begged me not to go. “Those people will kill you,” she said. And when I scoffed at her warning, she cried. “You don't know them!”\n\nBetween my grandmother and my mother, I was brought up to dread the Terrible Turk. So, although I had asserted with the most absolute conviction that “'Midnight Express’ is not only racist, it's antihuman,” something old and deep inside me needed to be reassured. Perhaps, I thought, men who get their names in the newspapers are shown only the good side of everything. For this reason, I was particularly eager to visit Toptashi prison.\n\nI took the precaution not to announce my visit beforehand, so that no celebrity's tour could be arranged. I would simply show up at the prison gates early Saturday morning, the first day of Bayram, the great national religious holiday, when the wives and children of prisoners are allowed to visit their men.\n\nWe arranged to leave the hotel at 8 in the morning. Crossing the great bridge over the Bosporus, we came to the Istanbul suburb of Uskudar. As we approached the prison, there were the same slogans on the walls we'd seen throughout the trip: “Not Russia, not America!” “A Free Turkey or Death!” And from the anarchists: “Long Live the Revolutionary Terrorism of the Proletariat !”\n\nToptashi stands behind a high, long, yellowish wall of concrete, flanked at the corners by irregular, somewhat shapeless towers. Across the cobbled street there is a mosque. I expected to see whole families waiting outside the prison walls. But it was an hour before visiting time and only a single woman stood near the long metal staircase that led to the the reception room where the prisoners were to meet their families. A knock on the door to the reception room brought no response. We went to one of the corners of the jail, where we found the headquarters of the chief of the gendarmerie, responsible for guarding the outside of the building. To my surprise, we were admitted immediately. The officer in command was not there; it was a holiday for him too.\n\nAs soon as we sat down, a young soldier with a bullet head and crew cut, wearing a gray‐green field uniform, offered us cologne. This is the standard flourish of hospitality in Turkey. The guest cups his hands and the sweetsmelling fluid is poured to him. He rubs his palms together, then spreads the cologne over his face and neck. A few\n\nI minutes later, another husky soldier brought us strong tea in tulip glasses set on small saucers, three cubes of sugar at the side. Tea is offered immediately to all visitors everywhere in Turkey; it is always strong and taken very sweet.\n\nThese young soldiers guard only the outside of the wall and do not mix with prisoners. They are country boys, drawn from another part of the land simple‐minded but good‐hearted and particularly respectful of age. (The farther east one goes in Turkey, the more conservative and religious the people.) Boys and girls in Turkey are taught to respect their fathers and revere their grandfathers. On Bayram Day they kiss their elders’ hands, then bend to touch them with their foreheads. When an older man enters the room, they rush to offer a chair, tea and cologne.\n\nBut these kids carry quick death. Their automatic weapons look as if they had been manufactured in the United States. No, I was told, they were being made in Turkey now; but the model, yes, it was American.\n\nThere is nothing like the 24‐hour attendance of a bodyguard to make one aware of how easily a life can be taken.\n\nDid you ever hear a pistol shot in crowded city? It doesn't ring out; it may make a pop not much louder than a cap pistol as it kills. In a city like Istanbul or Izmir, an assailant can disappear into a crowd in a matter of seconds.\n\nSalih Tekin, my bodyguard, did not appreciate my freewheeling ways. All through the journey, he was always four or five feet behind me, and he always went out a door before allowing me to follow. At night, when we checked into an accommodation, he would inspect the room reserved for me, entering it before I did, opening the closet and the drawers of the bureau, turning over the mattress, looking under the bed and on top of the water closet. Vases holding flowers, he told me, were favorite containers for explosives. Only after he'd finished his inspection did he admit me into my room. Then he'd contact the local police and arrange for two of their men to sit outside my room all night. If the terrorists’ purpose was to demonstrate that Mr. Ecevit's Government could not control its people, what better way to do it than to knock off the Prime Minister's guest?\n\nMrs. Gerede, the film maker, is an In 1973, Yilmaz Guney - then clean‐shaven= appeared in on Istanbul military energetic and impatient soul and after we'd had our tea, she walked behind the absent commander's desk, picked up his phone (“She's been here before,” thought) and dialed a number - that of the prison itself. She asked for Yilmaz Guney. When she hung up, she said, “Come! Yilmaz is going to let us in.”\n\nThat is what happened. We went down to the street again, walked along the long yellow wall to the metal staircase, climbed to the steel door. Mrs. Gerede rapped on an eye‐level panel and a small steel shutter slid open. She looked in and said, “There he is.”\n\nSmiling welcome, he opened the door. I couldn't figure it out. Was no other certification necessary? Just my name and his wish to see me? Could prisoner in Turkey let visitors into jail?\n\nPutting his arms around me, he pulled me to him and kissed me on both cheeks. I'd not seen the man until that instant. Yilrnaz's appearance surprised me; he was much slighter than I'd expected. His shoulders - as remembered from his leading role in “Unto[.” - had been well‐pacbed. In those days. he'd walked with a star's swagger. like a hero of legend. Now there was something gentle and kindly about him; ascetic as well. In jail for his third term, he had lost 20 pounds.\n\nWe were in a large, square reception room with walls of dirty gray concrete. There were benches, a few old easy chairs and a jet‐black sofa. Yilmaz pulled me to the sofa and threw his arm around my shoulders. Speaking in great rush, so that I needed a translator, he told me how much my films had meant to him. He knew them intimately; cast, details, scenes.\n\nIt struck me that I didn't see any guards. When Guney opened the door for us, the man at his side might have been one, but you couldn't have guessed it from his appearance. He wore a suit coat over an open‐collar shirt, while Guney wore an old brown sports coat over an open‐collar shirt. They behaved like old friends. By now, they probably were.\n\nI stayed with Yilmaz inside that prison from 10 in the morning until 3 in the afternoon and I didn't see a man in uniform. Almost immediately, I asked Yilmaz if I could make a tour of the place. Re retorted, ‘KW cause,” bat added that we'd have to go through the formality of asking anorova. from the prison governor, the mudur. He pointed to a door directly off the reception MOM.\n\nThe mudur was alone in his office and he looked lonely. On his desk was a large blue box of chocolates, trimmed with holiday ribbons - a Bayram gift. The man was perhaps 45 years old, had the kind of dark curly hair our shampoo ads call oily and was dressed in a blue business suit which displayed, at the vest, a rather loud tie. Again we were provided with cologne and served tea in tulip cups. It was obvious that he and Yilmaz were close and equal friends. In fact, the mudur treated his prisoner as a celebrity, a glamour figure. It was Yilmaz who put him at his ease with me.\n\nOf course we could visit the prison, the mudur agreed. Yilmaz would show us around. About taking pictures, however, he had some hesitation. He asked me to leave my camera on his desk until he'd made a phone call. He didn't want the responsibility for any photographs that I might take and cause to be published. If it was O.K., he'd send my camera to me, wherever I was. Saint, my bodyguard, offered to leave his American‐made. 45 behind. The mudur accepted the weapon, nodded, smiled. Then he offered us chocolates which were delicious but - like every confection in that country - too sweet for my taste. We washed the candy down with the tea and we stood to go. The mudur embraced mu, kissing me on each cheek. I have never been kissed so often by so many men.\n\nYilmaz led us down a flight of stairs, concrete edged with metal strips, to the ground floor. Here was a large rectangular bin, waist‐high, filled with broken bits of dark, peasant‐style bread: the leavings of the prisoners to be fed to cattle. Through another door, we passed into a small courtyard which contained a scraggly tree, its trunk whitewashed, and three untethered sheep.\n\nBayram is the great traditional holiday in that part of the world and its ritual is the oldest on earth: the sacrifice of a life to gain the favor of a god. For this occasion, sheep are brought home by the head of each family in the same spirit that we bring home Christmas trees. The slaughter is usually done within the family circle, even children witnessing. ('God made the Iamb to be slaughtered,” a boy of 8 said to me.) The head of the family makes single deep cut across the throat, the blood empties through the slit, the nostrils and the mouth, then the animal keels over and kicks out its life. The warm body is skinned, the edible guts - still steaming - are set aside, and the carcass dismembered. By tradition, one third of the meat goes to the general poor, one third to needy neighbors; one third to the family itself. Bayram is observed in prison, as everywhere else, and the animals were there, waiting.\n\nOn the other side of the courtyard, Yilmaz had taken out a key and opened a &Or painted tight green_ The small square room behind the door was his study, a place provided by the prison's authorities for him to write. Here were a small table, two chairs and two bookshelves filled with books and magazines.\n\nPolitical prisoners everywhere carefully study the law by which they are bound. On Yilmaz's bookshelves were three heavy, leather‐bound volumes. When I asked him how long he'd be in prison, he took down one of these books and read us the Turkish law which applied in his case. Then he told us he was being tried on three counts, even while he was serving this sentence. These trials were for political actions and, if he was convicted, the penalty could be death. He didn't seem to take the threat seriously.\n\nWhy not? Had he been in jail so many times and threatened this way so often that it had become his way of life? But then the whole atmosphere of the prison astonished me: Yilmaz's workroom, his ease and grace in confinement, the casualness of the guards‐ if they were guards - and the friendliness of the mudur.\n\nAfter, I found out that every respectable intellectual in Turkey has served a sentence in jail. Prof. Mete Tuncay, the historian and philosopher Mr. Ecevit assigned to me, had served four months. My friend Yashar Kemal, the novelist, who is frequently mentioned for the Nobel Prize in Literature, had done time. His wife and translator, Thilda, had also put in four months. It had become a sort of distinction.\n\nLike any author, Yilmaz dug out copies of his books and inscribed them I to me. It was a get‐together of P.E.N. members - the same scene I've enjoyed with other authors in other circumstances.\n\nI had begun to be concerned that our tour might end in this courtside study, so I asked Yilmaz again if I could see the rest of the prison. He said to follow him, behaving as if his privileges were unlimited. He led us across the courtyard. through another door, up a flight of stairs. Again there were no visible guards or check points. Prisoners went freely up and down the stairs.\n\nWe entered a very long room. We were in a dormitory: the living quarters for - at a glance - 100 men. The room was high enough to hold a double tier of bunks. Almost all were occupied by prisoners at their ease, talking, reading, playing backgammon, some of them still asleep. They were all free to move around as they wished. Yilmaz led us slowly through the passageway between the facing tiers of beds. Most of the men didn't bother to look up. At the far end of the room were the men imprisoned for the most serious crimes, many murderers among them. Here also were prisoners for political actions which had brought them equally heavy sentences. I saw no one confined or restrained; but, of course, there must have been parts of the prison I never got to see, where more violent inmates were locked up.\n\nAt the end of the long row, on the upper level, was Yilmaz's bedroom. We climbed a flight of stairs with narrow treads. Red curtains of a heavy home‐spun material covered the opening. Yilmaz's roommate was there to greet us - a man of about 45 who'd killed a policeman and a guard. He'd been in jail for 17 years. (As we edit this piece for The Times, I learn that this man has escaped.)\n\nWe were invited to sit on two low mattress beds between which a crate served as a table. The two men had made their space into a room that was their own. There was even wallpaper - sky‐blue with a pattern of flowers.\n\nYilmaz made sure we were comfortable. Then, sitting at my side, he gripped my shoulders and asked us to stay for lunch. He passionately needed to prolong our visit. Of course we agreed.\n\nGarments - civilian clothing - hung from nails on the walls. Yilmaz had a radio, a worldwide receiver which kept him in touch with current events. His roommate had a tiny Japanese TV. I asked Yilmaz where there was a picture of his wife.\n\n“A man doesn't hang up his wife's picture here,” he said. A tense young prisoner with a deferential air came in with cologne which we took in cupped hands.\n\nYilmaz had spent most of his adult life in jail - and for the moment, there was no end in sight. How had his wife endured this?\n\n“Fatos has learned to accept my being in prison as natural,” Yilmaz answered.\n\n“I haven't seen any guards here,” I said.\n\n“They're here,” Yilmaz replied. “But they dress like we do and most of them are our friends.”\n\n“Do they beat prisoners?” asked, thinking of “Midnight Express.”\n\n“It could happen,” he said. “But the guard who did it would be in danger. lie might not ever beat another man.” “The restrictions don't seem tight,” I said. “Couldn't you escape?”\n\n“Any time I wanted to,” he said.\n\n“Why don't you?”\n\n“I'm safer here.”\n\n“But if you were free, couldn't you leave the country?” “The ruling class would like me to leave,” he said. “But will fight for our cause until the end - and on our soil.”\n\n“Do you fear for your life here?”\n\n“My friends watch over me,” he said. “The man who tried to kill me wouldn't survive five minutes.”\n\nThe red curtains parted and the decorous young criminal reached in the first of three large round trays of food brought in from a local ovenshop: a ragout of tomatoes in which to dip bread, a dish of rice speckled with giblets and currants, and a lamb kebab. Yilmaz asked us to dinner. We ate directly from the trays.\n\nI described the scenes I'd seen on Cyprus two years before - the makeshift towns of refugees and their terrible misery. “Did you think the Turkish invasion of Cyprus was right?” I asked. “Was that war necessary?”\n\n“That was not a war,” he said with some disgust. “A war is when two armed forces meet on equal ground. That was an aggression against an unarmed people.”\n\n“Even your liberals think that the invasion was justified,” !said.\n\n“I know,” he said. “But Cyprus should not be controlled by the Greeks or by us. It must be independent. Unaligned!” “What about the Kurds?” asked.\n\nThe Kurds - a minority who live in eastern Turkey around Lake Van and the Iranian border - are known for their explosive rebelliousness and fierce independence. They've long had a separatist movement. One of the counts for which Guney was being tried while he was in prison is that he had openly espoused their cause.\n\n“When we defend the rights of the Turkish minority in Cyprus,” Yilmaz said, “we must also be considerate of the rights of the minorities in our own country.”\n\nHe talked like a pedagogue, reminding me of instructors I'd known, untroubled by doubt, at the Workers’ School in New York during the 30's.\n\nAs we ate the rice and lamb, I asked him how he saw America's influence in the region. He answered that the influence was heavy: the direct investment of dollars in enterprises like Istanbul's Intercontinental Hotel (where I was staying); the participation of American capital in large industrial and commercial companies (we'd seen a Ford tractor plant far out on the Anatolian plateau); the agreement between the United States and Turkey in which a provision exists that the arms provided cannot be used without United States’ permission.\n\n“But that was not honored in Cyprus,” I said.\n\n“We cannot be an American colony,” Guney answered, shutting me down.\n\nThe young prisoner parted the coarse red curtains again and the trays, half empty, were handed out to him. He returned with a dessert of ekmek kadayifi, shortbread soaked in sugar water, so sweet it was almost bitter.\n\nI told Nihnaz the suggestion I'd made to Mr. Ecevit - that he should be allowed, during the remaining years of his sentence, to make a film there in the jail. I had said to the Prime Wmister that “Midnight Express” confirmed the stereotype of the sadistic Turk in the eyes of the world ar.3 a film by Guney made in Toptashi prison might be the only convincing response. (Weeks later, I learn that Guney has just finished making a fourminute film in Toptashi.)\n\nIt was time to go. Now many of the prisoners emptied down into the passage between the double‐tiered blinks. Word had gotten around that I'd made “Viva Zapata,” a film which had been on their TV a few nights before. They'd responded to the theme, tiers y libertad‐ one that has always concerned the Turkish peasantry.\n\nThe mudur had sent my camera down to me during lunch, so it was all right for me to take pictures. But it was dark in the long, low room and the photograph I made (see Page 33) won't win any prizes. The reception room was packed with dusters of prisoners and their families. Men were embracing their kids, kissing them again and again, at the same time asking questions of their wives, swiftly and anxiously. They knew that another shift of visitors was waiting outside.\n\nThe feelings exposed were so private that, although I've been photographing the intense emotions of actors for more than 30 years, I couldn't bring myself to use my camera. While the men were overjoyed and the women stricken, the children often seemed frightened by the intensity of the adults. Many of them, I'm sure, could not recall seeing their fathers anywhere except in this drab gray room with its raw concrete walls. I stood in awe against the wall, watching the family groups in their joy and anguish.\n\nIt was then that I was told the mudur wanted to see me in his office and that it was urgent.\n\nWith him was a man introduced by the title of “Inspector General,” and he was all worked up because I'd been allowed to take photographs. He railed at me for more than half an hour, so quickly and so passionately that (my Turkish being what it is) I missed most of what he said. He seemed to be making the same point again and again: that there were other far more modem prisons in the country than Toptashi. Why hadn't I visited one of them?\n\n“But I like it here,” I said.\n\nI could see that he thought my remark foolish and untrue. He became extremely heated and quite eloquent. Yilmaz, seated at one side, showed no reaction except a slight smile which I thought gently mocking.\n\nDuring the Inspector General's harangue (“Why you come to this old prison? We have many modem ones clean, up‐to‐date”), the mudur, looking especially cordial, came out from behind his desk, holding the bottle of cologne. We cupped our hands. The Inspector General continued talking as he spread the sweet‐scented liquid over his face and neck.\n\nI was expecting him to ask me to surrender the film in my camera, but he didn't. Abruptly he concluded what he had to say, wiped his moist forehead and rose to his feet. Then he kissed me on both cheeks, saying something about my “fame” as a film director, and left the room.\n\nI didn't know exactly what he'd hoped to accomplish by storming at me. My guess is that it was simply so it could be said later, in front of witnesses, that he'd told me I might be making an unfair judgment. The Inspector General had taken out insurance.\n\nHe kissed Yilmaz on both cheeks, too, before he left.\n\nI thanked the mudur for allowing me the freedom of the place. He gave me his card and I left.\n\nIn the reception room, a guard in civilian clothes blew his whistle. It was time for this shift of visitors to leave.\n\nWhen Yilmaz and I said goodbye, he held me hard. felt he wanted more of me than I'd been able to give him. And I wondered: Was his absolute certainty on every issue, so typical of third‐world people, better than my ambivalence? My training as a director has been to see both sides of any conflict. My favorite quote is from Jean Renoir: “Everyone has his reasons.” Guney's thought is programmatic, concerned with correct choices and courses of action.\n\nOutside, the long narrow staircase, which had been empty when we arrived, was packed with the next shift of visitors: women and children, the poor and the abandoned. We had trouble getting through.\n\nWho were You seeing?” one ‘Saying goodbye, Yilmaz held me hard. He wanted more than I could give. Was his certainty, so typical of third‐world people, better than my ambivalence?’ of these women asked Mrs. Gerede.\n\n“Yilmaz Guney,” she answered.\n\n“More Communist propaganda!” the woman said scornfully.\n\nOn the way home, we were all sad. Professor Tuncay was particularly disturbed. “Guney's politics are killing his talent,” he said. “What's going to become of the film maker in the man?” A sensitive, good soul, Mete Tuncay had experienced the encounter as a tragedy of wasted talent. “I forgot to ask him,” I said later. “Did he kill the judge or not?”\n\n“Of course not,” Mrs. Gerede said. “He is falsely ac“I should have asked him,” said.\n\n“Anyway,” she said,'he was a fascist judge.”\n\n“Suppose you were that dead judge's daughter,” asked. “What would you say then?”\n\n“I hope I wouldn't allow my feelings to interfere with my intelligence,” she answered. “There is a man,” Mrs. Gerede said later, “who can tell you exactly what happened the night the judge was killed.” This man was Onat Kutlar, the head of the film department of the Ministry of Culture in Istanbul. I ran into him at a party given for me on my last night in Turkey. I asked him if he would tell Mrs. Gerede exactly what had happened so she could write it down for me. Here is Onat Kutlar's statement:\n\n“One day in August 1974, I went to Yilmaz Guney's house. Being old friends, we used to discuss his film projects. With great emotion, he started telling me about his next film. It was to be called ‘Endtshe’ [Anxiety].\n\n“The central character of this new film would be an agricultural worker in Chukurova near Adana. This strange worker, somewhere between a saint and a madman, would search the horizon with a fixed gaze as he crouched before his tent. And he would think, ‘Something will happen, surely something will happen, something terrible and frightening! Something must happen!’ This thought filled him with anxiety. The film would be the story of this man.\n\n“That very night, Guney left for Adana. A few days later, we heard about the murder. was not there to witness it, but ”\n\nSo, I thought, Onat Kutlar was not an eyewitness after all!\n\nHis statement continues: “Nevertheless, knowing Yilmaz, having listened to eyewitnesses, and having read all the reports concerning the incident, I can reconstruct how it happened.”\n\nI doubted if anyone could be trusted to do that.\n\nHis statement continues: “Yilmaz Guney throughout his career as a director, beginning with his first film and in the film roles he's acted, has become a symbol of the oppressed - a folk hero, a combination of saintliness and courage.”\n\nThat I believed. I'd seen the way the other prisoners had looked at him.\n\nOnat Kutlar's statement continues: “A few days after he'd begun to film ‘Enclishe,’ while he was working in a crowded restaurant, making a scene in which a gun is fired, the following incident took place: A judge with fascist tendencies, who was against the atmosphere which surrounded Yilmaz, insulted him. Very drunk, he also slandered Guney's wife. The owner of the restaurant tried to draw the judge hack to the table where his own wife sat, but the judge continued to shout insults. Everyone around Yilmaz watched quietly. Yilmaz remained silent. This angered the judge even more. He began to feel ridiculous, came back and swore again. His friends rose. Simultaneously Guney and his friends rose. The judge picked up a chair and flung it at Yilmaz. Yilmaz fell. At that instant, a gun‐shot was heard. The judge died.”\n\nBut who fired the shot?\n\nThe statement continues: “The radio, mouthpiece of the party in power at that time. immediately proclaimed Vilmaz the murderer. That same night, the attorney general of Yumurtalik was replaced. The new prosecutor also declared Yilmaz the murderer. Guney was tried, convicted, and is now in Toptashi Prison.”\n\nOf course, I was dissatisfied with the statement. Onat had not been an eyewitness. He was reporting hearsay and, I'm afraid, telling it as he wished the event to go down on the record. History is always rewritten, sometimes while it is still warm.\n\nA few days later I was in Paris and spent part of a day with some Turkish self‐exiles: a painter and his wife, a novelist and his wife, a documentary film maker and his Swedish wife. I spoke of Guney and my impression of Toptashi prison.\n\n“But you know that every Turkish prison is not like the one you describe,” the documentary film maker said. He spoke from experience.\n\n“I know,” I responded. “But the one I describe, I saw.” Then I brought up the question. “I didn't ask Yilmaz,” said, “whether or not he killed the judge. Nor did he ever say.”\n\nThe self‐exiled painter told me something I had not been told in Istanbul. At the investigation that followed the killing, men stood up to testify that they, not Yilmaz, had killed the judge. “From all sides,” he said, “men jumped to their feet and proclaimed their guilt for the murder.” “I believe Yilmaz did it,” the novelist said. “He had the greatest possible provocation. The judge shamed him in a way no man should tolerate, cursing him again and again and insulting his wife publicly. He forced Yilmaz to kill him to save face and his self‐respect.”\n\n“But what about the people at the investigation” I asked, “who stood up and said they'd killed the judge?”\n\n“That is what makes me believe it was Yilmaz,” the novelist said. “That more than anything.”\n\nMy friends dropped me off at my hotel; we said goodbye.lt was my last night in Paris and I didn't want to sleep just yet. needed to pull my impressions together before I got back to New York. Walking down the Rue de l'Odeon, I came to the Boulevard St. Germain. Although it was late, that street was still stirring.\n\nAll through my journey, I'd had the feeling that moderat. ing forces‐Mr. Ecevit, for an example - were keeping in check tensions and conflicts that might result in an explosion of the greatest violence. One morning the newspapers is Izmir’ reported that the Prime Minister himself had been attacked in his office by members of the police force not physically, it was stressed but verbally, vehemently and hatefully. Mr. Ecevit's reported reaction was, “Let's not make too much of it.”\n\nI recalled the night in the small provincial capital of Isparta when I was wakened by the sound of an explosion. A bomb had been thrown into a house near our hotel. A man's leg was blown off. The next morning two young men of a right‐wing family, taken into custody, wouldn't explain why they'd done what they had. I remembered Toptashi prison as the plac t where I had the most reasoned conversation of my trip, and also as one of the more peaceful places had visited. “It's safer here,” Yilmaz had said.\n\nOf course, all this violence wasn't only over there. My house in New York has been broken into three times. Every ground‐floor window along our Manhattan street is barricaded. Only recently my stepson, aged 15, and a schoolmate were attacked on Columbis Avenue and 70th Street by a gang of adolescents very little older than they are. These young raiders from the north didn't ask for money, nor did they want anything the boys wore or carried. They simply wanted to slam our kids around.\n\nOur side ran into a drugstore. Later the owner walked them home — their bodyguard.\n\nNow, as I strolled down the Rue de Rennes, I came upon wide‐ranging street fight. There must have been at least 20 young men involved. The swirl of fists and feet from curb to curb halted traffic. stood with the other spectators, back against the wall of a building.\n\nOur sympathies were unenlisted, of course; we didn't know the issues. But it struck me that even the participants might not. What made the fight so vicious? What would constitute victory? What prize was sought? Who had to be defeated? What could be gained? What lost?\n\n1 had the impression that recurred again and again during my journey: Not only had good young men lost confidence in the ethics of their elders and the programs of their governments but they no longer believed — or even clearly knew — their own values. They spoke for no solution. They had no alternative to offer.\n\nWe're all sitting on a volcano, I thought.\n\nIt was then that 1 recalled Yilmaz Gurney's hero, the agricultural worker in the film he didn't get to make; the odd fellow, half saint, half madman, crouched in front of his tent saying, ‐Something will happen, surety something will happen, something terrible and frightening. Yes, something must happen!” ■"
