        "text": "ANKARA, Turkey -- Film director Yilmaz Guney, who won the 1982 Cannes Film Festival for his film 'Yol', was stripped of his citizenship Thursday by the military government.\n\nGuney, believed to be living in exile in France, was serving a murder sentence when he escaped from Turkey in 1981.\n\nThe famous Turkish film director turned up briefly last spring to accept the international critics prize at Cannes, then flew out immediately to an undisclosed location because he feared for his life. Turkey has demanded his extradition from France.\n\nThe government order stripping Guney of his citizenship was ratified by the military government, along with an order for Turkish singer Cem Karaca, who is living in exile in Europe.\n\nKaraca sang left-wing songs supporting human rights movements in Turkey.\n\nGuney was sentenced to 14 years in prison in absentia after he fled a civilian prison where he was jailed in 1976 for the murder of a prosecutor. He fled his homeland while on home leave from prison.\n\nHe also was sentenced to 14 years in jail by a martial law court after being found guilty of praising communism and fomenting class struggle in his book 'On Fascism.' He received a seven-year sentence for another of his books."
