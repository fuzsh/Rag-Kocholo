        "text": "Arnie Kogen is an American comedy writer and producer. He has written for TV, film, and is a longtime writer for Mad Magazine. Among his hundreds of Mad bylines, Kogen has written more than 100 film or television parodies. Born in Brooklyn, New York City, New York to Jewish parents, Kogen contributed to Mad soon after college at New York University. He wrote for many of the top stand-up comics of that time including Don Adams, Morty Gunty, and Jan Murray. He moved on to writing for Candid Camera, The Les Crane Show, The Jackie Gleason Show and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. In 1965 he co-wrote the feature film Birds Do It, starring Soupy Sales. He moved to California with his family in 1968. His many variety and sitcom credits include The Dean Martin Show, The Carol Burnett Show, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, The Rich Little Show, The Tim Conway Show, The Golden Globes (1972–1975), Donny and Marie, An Evening at the Improv, Newhart, Empty Nest, and MADtv. Kogen has written comedy material for many entertainers including Steve and Eydie, Totie Fields, Flip Wilson, Jackie Vernon, Sammy Davis, Jr., Debbie Reynolds, Connie Stevens and Shelley Berman. Kogen has won 3 Emmy Awards (7 nominations) and one WGA Award (3 nominations). His son Jay Kogen, also a comedy writer, was an original writer for the animated television series The Simpsons. His late daughter, Jill Arons, worked at The Bingo Bugle.\n\nAfter first entering the entertainment business as a comic writer and performer, writer-director-producer and occasional onscreen performer Barry Levinson developed into a courageous filmmaker who took creative risks while scoring big commercial hits in several different genres. Having formed a comedy duo with actor Craig T. Nelson, Levinson became an Emmy-winning writer for \"The Carol Burnett Show\" (CBS, 1967-1978) before graduating to independent filmmaking with the poignant semi-autobiographical \"Diner\" (1982). With \"The Natural\" (1984), Levinson directed a lasting homage to the greatness of baseball. In the latter half of the decade, Levinson scored two huge hits: the manic comedy-drama \"Good Morning, Vietnam\" (1987) and the Academy Award-winning drama, \"Rain Man\" (1988), both of which announced him as one of Hollywood's top directors. Meanwhile, he ventured into television by directing and producing episodes of \"Homicide: Life on the Streets\" (NBC, 1993-2000) while maintaining a steady onscreen presence with \"Bugsy\" (1991), \"Sleepers\" (1996) and \"Wag the Dog\" (1997). Movies in the 21st century included \"Bandits\" (2001), \"Envy\" (2003) and \"Man of the Year\" (2006).\n\nWilliam E. Richmond (December 19, 1921 – June 4, 2016) was an American film and television comedy writer and producer, as well as a musician, actor and composer. He co-wrote the screenplays to numerous popular films that starred Jerry Lewis. These films included The Nutty Professor, The Errand Boy and The Ladies Man. He also made cameo appearances in some of Lewis' films as well, such as a piano player in The Patsy. Later in his career, he wrote and/or produced for numerous television shows, including Laugh-in, Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color, The Carol Burnett Show, I Dream of Jeannie, Welcome Back Kotter, Three's Company, The John Larroquette Show, Wizards and Warriors, All in the Family, Blossom and Kate & Allie. He won three Emmy Awards for his writing work (shared) on The Carol Burnett Show for the years 1974, 1975 and 1978."
