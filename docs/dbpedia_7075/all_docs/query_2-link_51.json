        "text": "Thanks mjp and chronic for helping me make these available to the good folks here...\n\nCan anyone tell me if either of these are collected in a book?\n\nI had them sent to me out of my NY storage place,\n\nwanting to sell them\n\nBut now that I have them, I of course don't want to sell :eek:\n\nHow much did that 'best Bukowski letter ever offered on e-bay!' go for?,\n\nyou know, that great one line letter where he fessed up to misspelling 'alcohol.'\n\nAnyway,\n\n1 of these might be sold in a private sale, and I don't know how much to ask;\n\nany advice?!\n\nThanks guys\n\nAlso, I've got 2 later poems too that I'm putting up here..\n\nZoom\n\nThat two line spelling correction letter sold for $610? Wow. Maybe I'm crazy, but I think that's ridiculously high for that. The '84 letter here is 10 times the letter that thing on eBay was. I don't think they compare.\n\nIf that note/afterthought sold for six bills I wouldn't let either of these go for less than a grand. The poems, I don't know. I was never a fan of the computer printer poems, so I never followed their prices really. I'm sure someone else did.\n\nI'm just shocked that \"letter\" sold at that price.\n\nfirst of all: thanks for sharing!\n\njust next: Don't sell!\n\nWhatever you get for it will be gone in a few weeks and after that you neither have the letters nor the money.\n\nNot selling means, the letters will last. They will still be with you in decades. How much is that worth? (in money?)\n\nAnother reason: given the economy now, you won't ever get what they're worth at the moment.\n\nAnd very important: Things like these, I believe, do not belong into private collections at all. They need to be professionally preserved, archived and available for the public. (how about a lending - not even donating - to the Huntington?)\n\nBut IF you do sell: don't forget to make the best possible scan / color-xerox-copy of them before!\n\nNow the Antiques Roadshow\n\nThanks for the comments and info;\n\nyou're all right.\n\nHand written letters, then\n\ntypewriters, then\n\ncomputer printers and\n\nnow e-mail. You're right Pessimist (and mjp, about the poems)...\n\nJust makes you wonder what our next 'advancement' will be.\n\nAnd Roni,\n\nthese letters are in a 'private collection' now, so... maybe passing them on to another is OK. Just having had them on hand for a while was, as they say, Priceless. I'd love to see them in a book.\n\nPurple Stickpin, thanks for the info. I thought I had made that 'letter' a \"watch item\" too... glad you did.\n\nAnd Bukfan, I'm more than happy(tickled really) to share... but I do need the $, and that's OK, I'm ready to let go. Time to invest in myself :)\n\nAnyway, as funny as life is, I was working in San Jose this weekend at a Home Garden and Gourmet Show and my buddy (boss, co-inhabitor, chauffer (HA!)) was pushing me to bring the letters to an auctioneer booth. Anyway, it was the guy from Antiques Roadshow,\n\nGary Sohmers\n\n(gray hair in a pony tail, glasses),\n\nand I wouldn't go,\n\nso this guy of course\n\ncomes to my set-up and my buddy jumps up\n\n\"Hey, have you ever heard of this guy 'Buck-owski' (that's how he says it)? My friend has some letters by him.\"\n\n\"You mean Charles Puke-owski? Yeah, he's a famous poet.\"\n\nAnyway, now I have 2 signed postcards from this guy\n\n(wooo-whooo)\n\nand he's read the letters and has asked for scans (which I've since sent)\n\nand he said he'll do some research\n\n(hadn't ever heard of Steve Richmond)\n\nand let me know values and/or best way to sell.\n\nIt was a hoot meeting him and his throwback-flower girl female companion...\n\ndidn't recognize either until I got his signed 'card'.\n\nImpressed he knew this 'Puke-owski' character....\n\nSo just heard back from the guy ->\n\nSorry to take so long ... been on the road and Rita did a little research ... they could sell for big bucks in the proper auction ... I couldn't give you an estimate other than to show previous prices realized at auction ... but suffice to say it would be thousands.\n\nLet me know if you would like to consign these for auction or you can try PriceMiner for previous auction sale prices. http://www.priceminer.com/a/3123/4\n\nLet me know if I can be of service.\n\nNice to meet you in AZ.\n\nThanks for watching \"Antiques Roadshow.\"\n\nGary\n\nOk, it was San Jose, not Arizona, and I don't watch the show\n\n:o\n\nAnyway, thanks Chuck (I mean Gary).\n\n:D\n\nAnyone a member of price miner?\n\nI'm not any closer to coming up with a fair price......\n\nHi,\n\nI think that the letters are great, but I think that the Antiques Roadshow \"Expert\" is wrong. Thousands? Each? I would say that they would probably sell for $750 - $1250 each, but only if stnickl is interested. At ebay auction without him interested, I think that you'd have a tough time finding a bidder. At a PBA auction or similar, I think that it would be a tough sell.\n\nBut that is just my opinion.\n\nStill, if I wanted to sell something like this, I'd try listing them here, then ebay.\n\nBill\n\nDavid, we probably should have said \"That's great, I'll sell it to you then!\"\n\nAnd just to give you all the heads up,\n\nI'm slowly working at putting the 1984 letter up on e-bay...\n\nand Bill, I'm going to have a low (very low) opening bid\n\nto encourage bidding->\n\nToo many big ticket items shouting 'No Reserve' have insane opening bids and this ain't gonna to be one of 'em.\n\nAnd this isn't going to have a bunch of bids only to go unsold because of an inflated Reserve;\n\nNo Reserve on this so yeah, I'm almost certifiably nuts.\n\nAnd for full disclosure, I was offered $1000 for this letter with neither of us really knowing what to ask/offer/accept so I came up with this brilliant idea of letting the market dictate the price.... so yeah, I'm thinking it should go for more,\n\nbut you know, 'should' and 'did' can be very different.\n\nAhh, what's the worst that can happen :eek:\n\nShit, someone stop me\n\nWell Bill, (and I was ready to shit....)\n\nDid you see my response to a question I received?,\n\nand that I posted?\n\nI wouldn't buy from me either,\n\nnot with that jarbled response I gave.\n\nEgads, I can not multi-task\n\n(was on the phone at the time when I stupidly responded)\n\nI feel bad for a member here who offered the 1k,\n\nbut I just really didn't know the value in todays market so wanted to see what it would fetch.\n\n(personally, I think it is worth even more than what it went for..... (and he hasn't paid yet)) but that's ok)\n\nThere was a bid retraction somewhere too,\n\nand my next highest bidder was a first timer\n\n(registered though in June)\n\nand I don't like to sell to them\n\n(but damn it, I didn't say that in the auction).\n\nWill let you all know what happens\n\nI've got three letters from Bukowski dated 83- 84, Of course I wouldn't want to sell them but have always wondered how much they're worth. All from San Perdro with enevelopes and little drawing of the man with bottle as usual.\n\nPlus I have a copy of Cardiff magazine Second Aeon N0 13 which includes three poems by Buk, two of which ( \"poem for dante\", and \"the condtions\") don't seem to be listed on this site's database.\n\nDon't think i made it clear that the letters were addressed to me after sending him somewritings. Lovely, supportive replies which I like to re-read when I'm feeling like shit. They obviously haven't been published - and they are funny and worth reading - as I'm the only person who's read them - except for a few mates.\n\nWho would I contact about getting them published in future collections?\n\nYou would want to contact Ecco, BUT, I would be surprised if they include them if they are even planning on putting out any more books of general letters. They seem to use ones that are addressed to publishers and poets that he knew for a while (Menebroker is an example).\n\nPlus, I believe that Bukowski kept a copy of all correspondence except for fan mail.\n\nCan anyone (I'm looking in the direction of Spain) confirm this?\n\nThe pre 1958 correspondence was pretty much \"lost\" up until recently, and not everything has been uncovered. B. did keep fan mail in the 70s thru the 90s for sure. Maybe not all fan mail, but a great amount nonetheless.\n\nIf I were to edit a volume of letters, content would trump \"names,\" if you know what I mean."
