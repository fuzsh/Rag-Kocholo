        "text": "LONDON — Born a slave on Staten Island in 1763, Bill Richmond left America in 1777, never to return, and spent most of his life in Britain. But it was not until he was 40 years old that he began bare-knuckle boxing — a brutal sport that brought him fame, prestige and an invitation to the coronation of King George IV.\n\nYet even in his adopted country, where he has been called the world’s first black sporting superstar — or stereotype, some would say — Mr. Richmond’s remarkable life story is largely forgotten.\n\nNow, almost two centuries after his death, in 1829, he is back in the limelight as a search begins in earnest for Mr. Richmond’s remains.\n\nAs part of a rail upgrade, one of London’s main stations is being redeveloped, prompting the excavation of a burial ground containing the remains of an estimated 45,000 Londoners, including Mr. Richmond.\n\nAs archaeologists pick their way through the huge site, clearing topsoil with diggers and exhuming by hand those buried here, they are hoping to identify and rebury the boxer who transcended the raw racism of his age to emerge a sporting hero. For his fans, this is a big moment.\n\n“He was the pioneer of black sporting endeavor,” said Luke G. Williams, author of a biography “Richmond Unchained,” who sees his subject as the forerunner of giants like Jesse Owens and Muhammad Ali. “He was the first black sportsman to achieve celebrity. There had been no one before him who had reached that level of national prominence.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
