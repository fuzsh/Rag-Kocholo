        "text": "Built at the crossroads of Native trade routes, Shockoe Slip’s name is derived from the former Shockoe Creek, an homage to the Powhatan/Algonquian phrase “Shacahocan.” Downtown Richmond has always been a place where people, languages and goods have mingled. In 19th Century Shockoe Slip, Richmond's original Great Basin stood between 8th and 11th, and Cary and Canal Streets, and was connected by a series of locks to the Richmond dock, making the neighborhood a center for commerce and shipping.\n\n​\n\nNow known for its scenic, cobblestone streets, Shockoe Slip is still home to some of Richmond’s most beloved and long-standing Shockoe Slip restaurants and small businesses, the Kanawha Canal, creative businesses like the Martin Agency and many of downtown RVA’s hotels. Shockoe Slip is a must-see part of downtown Richmond for locals and visitors to see all of the best that Richmond has to offer.\n\nShockoe Slip takes the best elements of downtown Richmond - the James River, the history of the city, creativity and culture - and brings them all together. Explore public art and discover the monumental changes downtown Richmond has gone through over the years, walk along the Riverfront Canal Walk or opt for something more adventurous like a bike ride on the Virginia Capital Trail, a protected and dedicated trail that spans 52 paved miles and starts (or ends) in downtown Richmond’s Shockoe Slip.\n\nBasket & Bike, 1301 E.
