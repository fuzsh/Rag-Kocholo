        "text": "Church Hill, one of Richmond’s most beloved neighborhoods, is also its oldest. The City of Richmond was founded there in 1737, and the American Revolutionary War kicked off with Patrick Henry’s famous “Give me liberty, or give me death!” speech at St. John’s Church.\n\nIn fact, the view of the James River from Libby Hill Park is what gave Richmond its name – William Byrd II thought it bore a striking resemblance to the view over the Thames river in Richmond, just outside of London.\n\nToday, Church Hill is a thriving neighborhood full of residents, small businesses, and vibrant parks. Want a little food with your history? The dining scene in Church Hill is as diverse as the neighborhood is old. Which is to say, very. Explore for yourself at any of the spots below, or let us show you all our favorites on a Church Hill Food Tour!\n\nRealizing that there was a need for Texas-style barbecue in Virginia, Alamo BBQ brought its award-winning brisket to Church Hill. They playfully describe their location as just 5 minutes from downtown Richmond, and much closer than Texas. We can’t argue with that! And we also can’t argue with flavor – Alamo puts out the kind of barbecue that RVANews called “gloriously smokey and flavorful” while Zagat deemed the combination of flavors “perfect.”\n\nAlamo BBQ was also named to our list of Richmond’s best barbecue restaurants.\n\nA German restaurant in Church Hill! But not just any run-of-the-mill German restaurant, this one was named restaurant of the year by Style Weekly in 2014, and doubles as a butchery (Metzger means butchery in German). You’ll find classic German dishes such as Flammkuchen and Schnitzel on the menu, along with a selection of German beer and wine. Don’t miss out on the macaron ice cream sandwiches!\n\nMetzger Bar & Butchery was also named to our list of Richmond’s best ethnically-inspired restaurants!\n\nMillie’s is a Richmond institution, having opened in 1989 – before Church Hill became one of the city’s hottest neighborhoods. An open kitchen that allows you to see chefs preparing food, and tiny jukeboxes at each booth, give Millie’s the character that brings people in, while fresh ingredients and delicious food bring people back. Head over for Sunday brunch (but go early) to try the famous Devil’s Mess!\n\nWe named Millie’s Diner as one of our favorite spots for breakfast!\n\nThis award-winning pie shop brings New Zealand’s savory pies to Richmond (plus a few sweet ones, too, because what’s a pie shop without something sweet?)! Proper Pie’s menu changes daily, depending on what’s made that morning, but you’re sure to find a variety of meat and vegetarian savory pies that are as delicious as they are adorable (at 5-inches, these personal-sized pies can definitely be described as adorable). If dessert is your speed, you should try a slice from a variety of fruit, cream, or nut pies."
