        "text": "William Blake Richmond [also known as Sir William Blake Richmond] was born at 10 York Street, London, England on 29 November 1842 and was the son of the painter George Richmond (1809â1896), a friend of William Blake. Because of poor health he was taught at home and received lessons in art from John Ruskin (1819-1900). From 1858 to 1861 he attended the Royal Academy Schools in London, where he won two silver medals. In 1866 he travelled to Rome and spent three years studying the Old Masters. Richmond's early work was heavily influenced by Pre-Raphaelitism, however, by the 1870s, possibly as a result of his time in Rome, his paintings had shifted to classicism. and later to aestheticism. Richmond first exhibited at the Royal Academy in London in 1861 and continued to do so frequently until 1916."
