Bishop Barry C. Knestout expresses his sorrow and compassion to the victims and their families affected by this tragic situation and applauds the courage it took to come forward. Bishop Knestout has determined that St. John the Apostle parish would benefit from new pastoral leadership. Fr. Rob Cole will no longer serve as pastor effective June 12, 2024. Bishop Knestout appreciates Fr. Cole’s dedication and service as the pastor to this community for more than 15 years. While this decision and transition will be difficult, the bishop appreciates the patience and support of the community. Fr. Esteban De Leon, V.F., pastor of Star of the Sea Catholic Church, will continue to serve as St. John’s temporary administrator until a new pastor is assigned in the near future.\n\n###\n\n[post_title] => Catholic Diocese of Richmond Concludes Investigation at St. John the Apostle in Virginia Beach [post_excerpt] => [post_status] => publish [comment_status] => closed [ping_status] => closed [post_password] => [post_name] => catholic-diocese-of-richmond-concludes-investigation-at-st-john-the-apostle-in-virginia-beach [to_ping] => [pinged] => [post_modified] => 2024-08-05 13:13:09 [post_modified_gmt] => 2024-08-05 17:13:09 [post_content_filtered] => [post_parent] => 0 [guid] => https://richmonddiocese.org/?p=137855 [menu_order] => 0 [post_type] => post [post_mime_type] => [comment_count] => 0 [filter] => raw ) [3] => WP_Post Object ( [ID] => 137605 [post_author] => 112 [post_date] => 2024-05-20 11:31:14 [post_date_gmt] => 2024-05-20 15:31:14 [post_content] =>\n\nMay 17, 2024\n\nWe are pleased that Governor Youngkin has vetoed SB 237/HB 609 and SB 238/HB 819. These bills threatened to compel organizations to provide and pay for contraceptives and even some abortion-inducing drugs and devices against their deeply and sincerely held beliefs. In SB 237/HB 609, the asserted “right” to contraception was alarmingly broad: It would have applied even to minors seeking sterilization procedures – in direct conflict with Virginia’s parental consent law.\n\nThese two sets of coercive, expansive, and extremely harmful bills were rightfully rejected for many reasons, including those that previously led Hobby Lobby and the Little Sisters of the Poor all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. We are grateful to Governor Youngkin for protecting life, liberty, and parental rights. We also thank the more than 2,000 people who used the Virginia Catholic Conference’s action alert regarding this legislation to provide vital input to the Governor’s office. Your participation matters and your voices were valued.\n\n###\n\nRead the statement on the Virginia Catholic Conference website.

The appropriate civil authorities and law enforcement agencies are involved. The Diocese is also investigating to confirm whether the Diocese’s Safe Environment regulations or other policies were properly followed. The protection of our children is of the upmost importance to the Diocese. Fr. Rob Cole, Pastor of St. John the Apostle parish, is on temporary leave from the parish while this matter is investigated. The Diocese will not reach any conclusions until the investigation is completed. Know, however, that the Diocese is committed to ensuring that our institutions provide an environment where our children are safe and thrive. During this time, Bishop Barry Knestout has appointed the Very Reverend Esteban De Leon, VF, pastor of Star of the Sea Catholic Church, as temporary administrator of the parish. Similarly, the Office of Catholic Schools will provide additional support to the school administration. Please keep all involved in your prayers.\n\n###\n\n[post_title] => Announcement Concerning St. John the Apostle, Va.

Earlier this spring, teachers representing each of the 23 diocesan schools were nominated for their dedication to Catholic education, their witness to the Catholic faith, their instructional expertise and selfless work in service to students, families, and the overall school community. Teaching professionals gathered at St. Michael the Archangel Catholic Church, Glen Allen, to honor and celebrate their colleagues for their exceptional work in Catholic education. Before the awards reception, Bishop Barry C. Knestout celebrated Mass with Catholic educators. “There is a great practicality to Catholic education and the work you do each day…you’re struggling with day-to-day trials: temperaments, personalities, gifts and abilities, and the whole range of human experiences,” said Bishop Knestout. “There’s something so beautiful and so good about Catholic education. People are drawn towards it, and it’s a beautiful mission with a great impact.” One educator from each of the diocese’s 23 schools was selected for their demonstration of excellence in and outside the classroom. Each winner was carefully reviewed and chosen by a committee. Three teachers received a Diocesan Award for Excellence in Catholic Education and a fourth received the esteemed Elizabeth Ann Seton Award. The award’s namesake, Elizabeth Ann Seton, was the first United Sates-born canonized saint. She is the patron saint of Catholic schools and teachers.

Yet, our commitment must not wane; indeed, I encourage you to move forward, so that the Church will be, always and everywhere, a place where everyone can feel at home…”\n\nIn the Catholic Diocese of Richmond, the Office of Safe Environment (OSE) continues to move forward through efforts to protect minors, the vulnerable and to listen to the voices of victims.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_119225\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"400\"] Bishop Knestout greets Pope Francis during his \"ad limina\" visit to Rome, Dec. 3, 2019. (Photo/Vatican Media)[/caption]\n\n“The Church uses this month as an opportunity to recognize our past weakness and sins, in failing to protect the innocent. We bear within us, as a Church, grief for injuries committed, and regret for our failures and neglect,” said Bishop Barry C. Knestout. “As the Holy Father noted, much of our service in accompanying victims and survivors is carried out confidentially. But there are visible signs of our assistance, of our vigilance and the measures taken to safeguard minors.”\n\nThe action we have taken and the services we provide are published in an annual report by the Office of Safe Environment. During April, OSE will host multiple events at the Pastoral Center in observance of Child Abuse Prevention Month. They are:\n\nA Mass for Victims of Child Abuse livestreamed on Tuesday, April 16, at 12 p.m.\n\nA Rosary for Children and Families recited Thursday, April 18, at 10 a.m. Students from Saint Bridget Catholic School, Richmond, will join Bishop Knestout in praying the rosary for those in need of healing.\n\nDay of Service for Sleep in Heavenly Peace, Thursday, April 25, 8:30 a.m. – 12:30 p.m. The Pastoral Center staff will partner with Sleep in Heavenly Peace to build beds and collect bedding for children in need.\n\nFor more information on the efforts of the Diocese of Richmond to protect children and the vulnerable, visit the Office of Safe Environment.\n\n###\n\n[post_title] => \"Our Commitment Must Not Wane\" [post_excerpt] => [post_status] => publish [comment_status] => closed [ping_status] => closed [post_password] => [post_name] => our-commitment-must-not-wane [to_ping] => [pinged] => [post_modified] => 2024-08-05 13:17:22 [post_modified_gmt] => 2024-08-05 17:17:22 [post_content_filtered] => [post_parent] => 0 [guid] => https://richmonddiocese.org/?p=137201 [menu_order] => 0 [post_type] => post [post_mime_type] => [comment_count] => 0 [filter] => raw ) [7] => WP_Post Object ( [ID] => 137191 [post_author] => 112 [post_date] => 2024-04-10 15:45:35 [post_date_gmt] => 2024-04-10 19:45:35 [post_content] => April 5, 2024\n\nStatement by Bishop Burbidge and Bishop Knestout on Governor Youngkin’s Vetoes of Abortion Shield Legislation\n\nWe welcome and are very grateful for Governor Youngkin’s vetoes of SB 15, SB 716, HB 519, and HB 1539. These bills would have given abortion providers who violate other states’ pro-life laws an unprecedented safe harbor in Virginia. The Governor’s rejection of these bills respects decisions other states have made to protect life. Of particular importance, the Governor’s action prevents abortion providers in Virginia from prescribing and mailing chemical abortion drugs to women and girls in other states without being subject to consequences for violating those states’ laws. Chemical abortions are now the most common form of abortion in the United States. As Governor Youngkin’s vetoes have made clear, it would be dangerous and wrong to give abortion and those who provide it an elevated protected status in Virginia law. We urge the General Assembly to reverse the extremely harmful path it chose this year. Instead of attempting to make Virginia a preferred destination for abortion, its focus in future sessions should be to enact policies that would protect mothers and their children from the tragedy of abortion, and that provide pregnant women and new mothers and families the support they need.\n\n###\n\nView statement on the Virginia Catholic Conference Website.

Knestout announces the appointment of Dr. Michael Riley as superintendent of schools for the Catholic Diocese of Richmond, effective July 1, 2024. He replaces the current Interim Superintendent, Dr. Jennifer Bigelow, who will conclude her time as interim superintendent on June 30, 2024. “My experiences in Catholic education, from teaching to leading as a principal, have been deeply personal and enriching,” said Dr. Michael Riley. “They taught me the importance of understanding the challenges and joys that come with each role. As superintendent, I want to use this firsthand knowledge to support our principals in providing the best possible environment for both teachers and students. I believe that by nurturing our educators and providing them with the tools they need, we can create a space where students thrive academically and spiritually, shaping them into individuals who make a positive impact in our society.\" For the past two years, Dr. Riley has served as associate superintendent of school operations for the diocese. He brings 25 years of Catholic education experience to his new role. Prior to serving in diocesan administration, he was Charlottesville Catholic School’s principal for ten years, where the school received two National Blue Ribbon awards for academic excellence. Additionally, Dr. Riley has served in several administrative and teaching roles in Catholic education. Dr. Riley graduated from Barton College with a Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education degree. He received his Master of Education and Doctor of Education in Educational Policy, Planning and Leadership from the College of William and Mary. Dr. Riley and his wife have two children who have both attended Catholic schools in the diocese. “Each school has its own unique story, its own traditions, and its own challenges. I'm eager to celebrate those differences and work collaboratively to address the specific needs of each community,” said Dr. Riley. With the assumption of his new role, Dr. Riley will serve on the Bishop’s Cabinet and work in partnership with the Diocesan Advisory School Board, a consultative board to the bishop of Richmond and superintendent of schools. The Diocese of Richmond has more than 9,400 total enrolled students in 30 elementary, middle and high schools throughout the diocese.\n\n###\n\n[post_title] => Superintendent of Schools Appointed for Catholic Diocese of Richmond [post_excerpt] => [post_status] => publish [comment_status] => closed [ping_status] => closed [post_password] => [post_name] => superintendent-of-schools-appointed-for-catholic-diocese-of-richmond [to_ping] => [pinged] => [post_modified] => 2024-08-05 13:18:30 [post_modified_gmt] => 2024-08-05 17:18:30 [post_content_filtered] => [post_parent] => 0 [guid] => https://richmonddiocese.org/?p=136871 [menu_order] => 0 [post_type] => post [post_mime_type] => [comment_count] => 0 [filter] => raw ) [9] => WP_Post Object ( [ID] => 136786 [post_author] => 112 [post_date] => 2024-03-14 15:02:49 [post_date_gmt] => 2024-03-14 19:02:49 [post_content] => [post_title] => Deceased Priest Added to Catholic Diocese of Richmond’s Clergy List [post_excerpt] => [post_status] => publish [comment_status] => closed [ping_status] => closed [post_password] => [post_name] => deceased-priest-added-to-catholic-diocese-of-richmonds-clergy-list [to_ping] => [pinged] => [post_modified] => 2024-08-05 13:19:14 [post_modified_gmt] => 2024-08-05 17:19:14 [post_content_filtered] => [post_parent] => 0 [guid] => https://richmonddiocese.org/?p=136786 [menu_order] => 0 [post_type] => post [post_mime_type] => [comment_count] => 0 [filter] => raw ) [10] => WP_Post Object ( [ID] => 136574 [post_author] => 106 [post_date] => 2024-02-24 02:20:06 [post_date_gmt] => 2024-02-24 07:20:06 [post_content] =>\n\nFor Immediate Release: February 23, 2024\n\nIt is the desire of the Catholic Diocese of Richmond, the Office of Catholic Schools, and our school communities to work with students and their families when special circumstances arise. This is and remains an ongoing, collaborative effort with the Bromley family as they are part of our Catholic community. We all agree the most important goal is for Logan Bromley to be set up for academic success, so he can complete the remainder of his senior year and ensure all necessary safety precautions are in place through an agreed upon action plan that best supports Logan.\n\nWe all want Logan to participate in extracurricular activities and events at Catholic High School and Logan is welcome to be present on diocesan school property. All of us want to ensure that there is appropriate family and school support for Logan at on-campus extracurricular activities and other school events to create a safe environment for him under the guidance of his doctors. Thanks to the diligence and commitment of Logan’s parents, Catholic High School and the diocesan Office(s) of Catholic Schools and Human Resources, we have partnered to develop a mutually agreeable plan for Logan’s continued education and participation in school sponsored events.\n\nBishop Knestout understands the importance of a student’s senior year. Equally important, he appreciates the need for a student to continue their relationship with God, experience the sacraments, and achieve the academic success that a Catholic education provides. It is his desire Logan Bromley be allowed this opportunity under the mutual plan put in place.\n\nLike any student in our Catholic schools, our wish is each and every student continues to flourish in a safe, productive and Christ centered environment.\n\n###\n\n[post_title] => Joint Statement from The Diocesan Office of Catholic Schools and The Bromley Family [post_excerpt] => [post_status] => publish [comment_status] => closed [ping_status] => closed [post_password] => [post_name] => joint-statement-from-the-diocesan-office-of-catholic-schools-and-the-bromley-family [to_ping] => [pinged] => [post_modified] => 2024-08-05 13:19:49 [post_modified_gmt] => 2024-08-05 17:19:49 [post_content_filtered] => [post_parent] => 0 [guid] => https://richmonddiocese.org/?p=136574 [menu_order] => 0 [post_type] => post [post_mime_type] => [comment_count] => 0 [filter] => raw ) [11] => WP_Post Object ( [ID] => 136395 [post_author] => 112 [post_date] => 2024-02-05 10:44:48 [post_date_gmt] => 2024-02-05 15:44:48 [post_content] => February 5, 2024 Legislation to legalize physician assisted suicide is moving rapidly in this year’s Virginia General Assembly session. The Senate and House have both taken steps to advance this lethal measure. Within the next week, floor debates in one or both chambers are likely to occur. We are alarmed and deeply saddened by this development. Human life is sacred and must never be abandoned or discarded. At this critical moment, we implore the faithful across our two dioceses: Please contact your state Senator and Delegate. Urge them to reject assisted suicide legislation, using the alert provided by the Virginia Catholic Conference. To access the alert, click here. Every suicide is a tragedy. Assisted suicide facilitates tragedies and makes the most vulnerable even more vulnerable. Legalizing it would place the lives of people with disabilities, people with mental illnesses, the elderly, and those unable to afford healthcare – among others – at heightened risk of deadly harm. In the few states where assisted suicide is legal, this troubling reality has already taken root. For example, insurance companies have denied coverage for cancer treatment and other life-saving procedures but offered to pay for cheaper suicide drugs instead. And in Oregon, only 3.3% of the patients who died by assisted suicide since its legalization in 1998 were referred for psychiatric evaluation. People facing the end of life are in great need, and must be accompanied with great care and attentiveness. To address each of their needs and alleviate their suffering, patients deserve high quality medical, palliative, and hospice care – not suicide drugs. Please tell the members of the Virginia General Assembly who represent you not to bring assisted suicide to our Commonwealth.\n\n###\n\nRead the statement on Virginia Catholic Conference's Website.

I offer my prayers for his family, his friends, and the clergy, religious and lay faithful of the Diocese of Houma-Thibodaux. “As priestly colleagues and in our episcopal ministries in the archdiocese, we worked together on a number of projects for the pastoral care of the people of Washington. I knew him as a good friend, a faithful priest, a capable past director of the Spanish Catholic Center and Vice President for Mission of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Washington. He was a dedicated auxiliary bishop of the Church of Washington. “He is remembered with affection and his passing is a significant loss for the Church. He will be dearly missed. “I ask all in the Diocese of Richmond to offer prayers for fellow Catholics in the Diocese of Houma-Thibodaux that Christ and Our Lady will sustain them and provide divine consolation during this time.

The mention of peace is prevalent this season. We read it in cards, sing it in hymns and hear it in Scripture and homilies. Given the uncertainty that comes with terrorism, unrest and war, it might be difficult to align what we read, sing and hear about peace with what we are witnessing in the world. We struggle with the nature of conflict and war and wonder how we can solve it. Yet, in readying our hearts throughout Advent to welcome the Prince of Peace, and by continuing that welcome during this Christmas season, we can act upon our desire for peace – especially this time of year. No one of us has an answer that would be universally accepted. What we do have, however, is the capability to touch the hearts of those closest to us – our families, friends, colleagues and neighbors. Each of us can look at people in our own lives with whom reconciliation is needed and then act upon it. It might be with someone at work or with a relative you will see at a family get-together. Is there a way you can move at least one step in that direction – even a small step that will lead toward healing? Consider how you prepared yourself for Christmas by making room for Christ in your heart. The next step is to share that peace with family members and others. Although it might seem cliché, charity begins at home. If we are in conflict interiorly or among family and friends, that is where we must look first. Through this reconciliation, we can have an impact. As we share in Christ’s Paschal Mystery, which is at the root of reconciliation, peace and unity, ask for the grace to be a resolver of conflict, to be a peacemaker. By our attitudes and hopefulness, this is who we are called to be – even when the world in which we live might discourage and disparage them. Let us hold in our hearts Jesus’ words at the Last Supper: “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give it to you. [Emphasis added] Do not let your hearts be troubled or afraid” (Jn 14:27). May 2024 be a year in which your heart is filled with peace, and in which together we work for the peace that Jesus taught and exemplified. With kindest personal regards, Most Rev. Barry C. Knestout Bishop of Richmond\n\n###\n\nLea la traducción al español de la carta de Navidad del obispo Knestout.\n\n[post_title] => \"Prince of Peace calls us to healing, reconciliation.\" Bishop Knestout's Christmas Letter - 2023 [post_excerpt] => [post_status] => publish [comment_status] => closed [ping_status] => closed [post_password] => [post_name] => prince-of-peace-calls-us-to-healing-reconciliation-bishop-knestouts-christmas-letter-2023 [to_ping] => [pinged] => [post_modified] => 2024-08-05 13:22:18 [post_modified_gmt] => 2024-08-05 17:22:18 [post_content_filtered] => [post_parent] => 0 [guid] => https://richmonddiocese.org/?p=136053 [menu_order] => 0 [post_type] => post [post_mime_type] => [comment_count] => 0 [filter] => raw ) [14] => WP_Post Object ( [ID] => 135951 [post_author] => 112 [post_date] => 2023-12-04 16:13:26 [post_date_gmt] => 2023-12-04 21:13:26 [post_content] => December 4, 2023\n\nRoanoke Catholic Community Celebrates Historic Elevation of Parish to Minor Basilica\n\nBasilica of Saint Andrew celebrates its official designation; Bishop Knestout blesses Basilica markers\n\nROANOKE, Va. – As the Roman Catholic Church entered the Advent Season, the Catholic faithful of Roanoke gathered, Sunday, Dec. 3, 2023, to celebrate the blessing and recognition of the parish as a minor basilica by the Vatican. After receiving special approval from the Vatican’s Congregation for Divine Worship and the Sacraments, Sept. 6, 2023, Bishop Barry C. Knestout returned to Roanoke to officially bless the insignia and signs representing a basilica and its connection to the Holy See. A Mass was celebrated with more than 400 Catholics in attendance. “St. Andrew Basilica is a beacon of prayer and faith in the Roanoke Valley. We can come and see where Jesus lives, hear his words, and find the answers to our deepest spiritual longings and needs,” said Bishop Knestout. “As a former architect, I appreciate the beauty and dignity of this space as it has become a place of pilgrimage for Catholics and non-Catholics who visit the city. May God continue to bless this parish community and may this new basilica continue to be a light to all who visit.” The Basilica of St. Andrew becomes the 93rd basilica in the United States. With this designation, the Diocese of Richmond has two minor basilicas and a total of three in Virginia. The other basilica is the Basilica of Saint Mary of the Immaculate Conception in Norfolk, which received the elevation in 1991. The third basilica is located in the Diocese of Arlington. In seeking designation as a minor basilica, a parish needs to demonstrate uniqueness in its architecture, history or pastoral outreach. St. Andrew Church has strong features in each of those areas. St. Andrew’s Catholic Church was first established in 1882. The newly designated basilica sits on one of the highest hills in Roanoke and overlooks the city. “We are greatly honored by this distinction. There are too many people to acknowledge but a heartfelt thanks to all the parishioners and staff at the Basilica of St. Andrew whose prayerful support and faithful service provided over all these years is what has made the church worthy of this distinction,” said the Rector of the Basilica of St. Andrew, Fr. Kevin Segerblom. “A building is just a building without a strong community of faith. So, I pray that God may continue to bless us and use this community and basilica to bring more people to Christ, just as St. Andrew did.” During the Mass, the official Vatican decree was read and the physical marks of the basilica were blessed. The Basilica of Saint Andrew currently has more than 1,500 registered families and two years ago completed a restoration of its interior and exterior. More information about the basilica, its symbols, and this special designation can be found on the parish’s website.

On Sept. 25, Our Lady of the Rosary Mission and the Catholic Diocese of Richmond finalized the purchase of the former Bank of America building in downtown Crozet for $1.72 million. The building and one-acre lot is the first permanent location and building owned by this Catholic community. Following the purchase, members of Our Lady of the Rosary began minor renovations on parts of the building. Bishop Barry C. Knestout plans to celebrate the first Mass at the location on the Memorial of Our Lady of the Rosary, Oct. 7, pending approval by Albemarle County. The community is a mission of the Church of the Incarnation in Charlottesville. “The Church of Richmond gives thanks that the Mission of Our Lady of the Rosary can look to the future with the hope of something new and have an environment in which the community can gather and strengthen the life of the Spirit among them” said Bishop Barry C. Knestout. “From the point of view of a bishop, it’s very rewarding. I am grateful that we can further the growth of this community and expand the ability of the Church to spread its mission.” In 2016, Bishop Francis X. DiLorenzo officially decreed the community as a mission congregation. On Oct. 4, 2020, Bishop Knestout officially named the Catholic community Our Lady of the Rosary, announcing the mission’s name under the patronage and dedication of the Blessed Mother. This marks the first time since his installation as bishop of Richmond in 2018 that Bishop Knestout has established and named a mission within the diocese. “This purchase gives the community a real chance to grow,” said Msgr. Timothy Keeney, pastor of Church of the Incarnation. “We hope with a new space that is our own and a morning Sunday Mass time, the enthusiasm will continue, and progress will be renewed.” This development has been a goal for the Catholic community for more than 10 years after the community celebrated its first Mass at the former Field School in 2014. Despite the complexities of COVID and the hurdles of an extensive property search, the purchase remains a historic milestone in the life of the Catholic faithful and the Diocese of Richmond. “It’s been tough for everybody because we wanted to move faster but we had a couple of false starts. For one reason or another, we couldn’t find suitable locations,” continued Msgr. Keeney. “This [bank location] is out of the box in terms of finding a location, but the Crozet Catholic community is happy about the location. We have a space where we can start to celebrate liturgies. We can have a daily Mass, scheduled confessions, space for parish events and formations. But most of all to have the reserved Eucharist for prayer and worship. All were impossible before the purchase of this building.” On Saturday, Sept. 30, Our Lady of the Rosary will hold an open house for its community of approximately 300 families to view the new property.\n\n###\n\n[post_title] => Former Bank Now Home for Our Lady of the Rosary Mission in Crozet [post_excerpt] => [post_status] => publish [comment_status] => closed [ping_status] => closed [post_password] => [post_name] => former-bank-now-home-for-our-lady-of-the-rosary-mission-in-crozet [to_ping] => [pinged] => [post_modified] => 2024-08-05 13:26:11 [post_modified_gmt] => 2024-08-05 17:26:11 [post_content_filtered] => [post_parent] => 0 [guid] => https://richmonddiocese.org/?p=135481 [menu_order] => 0 [post_type] => post [post_mime_type] => [comment_count] => 0 [filter] => raw ) [17] => WP_Post Object ( [ID] => 135455 [post_author] => 112 [post_date] => 2023-09-22 20:00:30 [post_date_gmt] => 2023-09-23 00:00:30 [post_content] => September 22, 2023 RICHMOND, Va. – Charlottesville Catholic School, Charlottesville, and Saint Gregory the Great Catholic School, Virginia Beach, are two of ten Virginia schools awarded the coveted National Blue Ribbon School Award in 2023. The awards were announced Sept. 19 by U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona’s Office. Charlottesville Catholic and St. Gregory were recognized for academic excellence under the Exemplary High-Performing School category. They are the only Virginia Catholic schools to receive the award this year. “The quality of education our schools provide is only one of many threads in the fabric of our Catholic schools,” said Bishop Barry C. Knestout. “Our schools remind students to develop and use their God-given skills and talents for their own good and for the good of society. This recognition elevates the awareness of the value of a good, Catholic education and the quality that we are able to offer in our Catholic schools. I congratulate St. Gregory and Charlottesville Catholic Schools for all the work involved on this achievement as a Blue Ribbon School.” In all, the U.S. Department of Education recognized more than 350 schools as National Blue Ribbon Schools for 2023. This award is granted based on each school’s progress in closing achievement gaps among students on assessments and overall academic performance. “I am grateful to God for this wonderful opportunity,” said Kika Glass, interim principal at St. Gregory. “Our school is recognized for high standards in education, as well as, for the fact that our families, communities, instructors, administrative and support staff, all work together toward common goals. SGGS now serves as a model of effective and innovative teaching for our entire state and schools throughout the nation.” For Charlottesville Catholic, this is the third Blue Ribbon Award. Previously, the school received the recognition in 2005 and 2014. “We are beyond excited that Charlottesville Catholic School has been awarded a National Blue Ribbon Award for academic excellence,” said Vada G. Fallica, principal of Charlottesville Catholic School. “This award is a testament to the commitment and dedication of our students, staff, faculty, parents, and all members of the CCS community.” Interim Superintendent of Schools Jennifer Bigelow added that every year “a select group of private schools are awarded the Blue Ribbon in the Exemplary High-Performing School category.” She continued, “National Blue Ribbon schools recognize non-public schools as “Exemplary High Performing” if the student achievement in English and Mathematics is among the highest in the country (top 15%) measured by nationally normed tests.” Recipients of the award represent the diversity of strengths in Virginia schools while also demonstrating core strengths of each school. A National Blue Ribbon School flag is flown at awarded schools to serve as a symbol of exceptional teaching and learning. Since the first National Blue Ribbon award in 1982, the U.S. Department of Education has granted 10,000 awards to over 9,700 schools.\n\n###\n\n[post_title] => Two Catholic Schools in the Diocese of Richmond Designated 2023 National Blue Ribbon Schools by U.S. Department of Education [post_excerpt] => [post_status] => publish [comment_status] => closed [ping_status] => closed [post_password] => [post_name] => two-catholic-schools-in-the-diocese-of-richmond-designated-2023-national-blue-ribbon-schools-by-u-s-department-of-education [to_ping] => [pinged] => [post_modified] => 2024-08-05 13:27:39 [post_modified_gmt] => 2024-08-05 17:27:39 [post_content_filtered] => [post_parent] => 0 [guid] => https://richmonddiocese.org/?p=135455 [menu_order] => 0 [post_type] => post [post_mime_type] => [comment_count] => 0 [filter] => raw ) [18] => WP_Post Object ( [ID] => 135386 [post_author] => 112 [post_date] => 2023-09-11 15:45:18 [post_date_gmt] => 2023-09-11 19:45:18 [post_content] => For Immediate Release: September 11, 2023\n\nCatholic Diocese of Richmond Statement Following Charges Against a Former Catholic School Teacher\n\n(RICHMOND) - On Sept. 11, 2023, Daro Ing, a former third-grade teacher at Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic School (OLOL) was indicted on multiple counts of taking indecent liberties with a child and aggravated sexual battery.\n\nOn May 2, 2023, the school administration was made aware of an accusation against Mr. Ing and immediately removed him from the classroom, placed him on administrative leave, and contacted the authorities. OLOL leadership cooperated fully with the Henrico Police Department and Child Protective Services investigations. The diocese and OLOL will not be able to comment on or answer any questions regarding this case while the legal process continues to move forward.\n\nMr. Ing was hired in January 2022. He underwent a background screening, fingerprinting, and reference check, and he completed child safety VIRTUS® training, as mandated by the Diocese of Richmond.\n\nBishop Knestout recognizes the courage it took for the children and families to come forward.

However, I am immensely grateful for our law enforcement community who, despite the chaos, were there to respond swiftly and bring order to a confusing scene. “In this month of June, in which we celebrate the Sacred Heart of Jesus, may our Lord bring consolation and healing to the lives affected and suffering because of yesterday’s violence.

At the time of the motu proprio and the subsequent release of the Responsa ad Dubia, published by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments on December 18, 2021, I instructed the priests presently celebrating the antecedent liturgy that they were free to continue supporting the communities utilizing this form of the Mass, after requesting permission from me personally. At that time, I relayed to the communities that a time of study and reflection would commence in order to determine the most appropriate course of action to remain faithful to the Holy Father's directives. In June 2022, I requested permission for several parishes to continue the celebration of the Traditional Latin Mass in their parish churches. Following a response on July 6, 2022, from the Dicastery for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, I am implementing the motu proprio in the Diocese of Richmond. The Very Reverend Brian W. Capuano, J.C.L., Vicar for Vocations and Interim Director of the Office of Worship has been delegated to care for the communities attached to the Missal of 1962 and will assist these communities and the priests designated to assist them in the proper ordering of the Mass in fidelity to the directives issued by the Holy Father in Traditionis Custodes. While I recognize that these new directives will result in some changes to the liturgical life in a few of our parishes, I invite the faithful to a robust adherence to the Gospel and the teaching of the Church. May we pray together for the grace of the Holy Spirit to enliven our faith through the sacred liturgy as we seek a unity in liturgical practice and fidelity to the Church.

Burbidge of the Diocese of Arlington and Bishop Barry C. Knestout of the Diocese of Richmond issued the following statement on Governor Northam’s signature of legislation that drastically expands abortion coverage in Virginia: “Governor Northam has crossed yet another tragic threshold by inserting abortion without limits into Virginia’s health benefits exchange. We decry the enactment of this deplorable policy, which is built on the destructive lie that abortion is healthcare. We are saddened when we contemplate the increased number of unborn lives likely to be lost as a result. “The exchange is a virtual marketplace created under the federal Affordable Care Act, through which an estimated 240,000 Virginians access their health plans. Under state law for the past decade, plans participating in Virginia’s health exchange were prohibited from covering most abortions. This fundamentally pro-life provision undoubtedly saved many lives. Starting July 1 of this year, however, that provision will be eradicated from our law. Consequently, and tragically, health plans in the exchange will be allowed to cover abortions for any reason. “In many cases, people receive public subsidies to purchase these plans. Beginning July 1, even these taxpayer-funded plans can cover abortions without limitation. This means that taxpayers will be forced to fund plans that cover abortion on demand. “Without despair, and with maximum determination, we will continue our advocacy for the preeminent priority of protecting unborn children from this threat. So many lives, who have no voice except ours, depend on it.”\n\n###\n\nThe Diocese of Richmond\n\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Richmond is under the leadership and pastoral care of Bishop Barry C. Knestout.

I continue to pray for increased vocations to the Little Sisters and to other consecrated religious communities so that their missions may be strengthened in the years to come.” To read the full press release from the Little Sisters of the Poor, click here.\n\n###\n\n[post_title] => Bishop Barry C.

We not only place before our Lord those who have COVID, but we pray for all who are undergoing treatment for illnesses that affect their bodies. “We remember the elderly, the weak and the vulnerable, that they receive care that provides them with the healing they seek while respecting their human dignity. “We hold up in prayer the terminally ill, that they no longer see illness and death as a tragic end, but as a heroic passage from this life to eternal life with our loving and merciful God. “We know that illness, like the inevitability of death, challenges our faith like no other experience. Long illness accompanied by extended periods of suffering or pain can produce anger, resentment, despair and isolation. It is a grace of our faith and the presence of God in our lives if we can experience such trial, but come through it with faith, peace, thanksgiving and hope. “We pray for those who suffer from mental illness, especially PTSD and addictions of any kind. May they accept the treatment necessary for them to learn how to live a fruitful life despite their illnesses. “We pray for family members of the sick and for their caregivers. In bringing comfort to those in need, they are following the example of Jesus. May they know that God is always with them and that the Holy Spirit will guide them in the decisions they make and the service they provide. “Finally, we continually offer prayers of thanksgiving for our health care personnel, volunteers, support staff, priests, men and women religious who, as Pope Francis notes 'have helped, treated, comforted and served so many of the sick and their families with professionalism, self-giving, responsibility and love of neighbor… they chose not to look the other way but to share the suffering of patients, whom they saw as neighbors and members of our one human family.'\n\n“As our Church marks this World Day of the Sick, our Holy Father reminds us that we must match our words with actions in reaching out to the sick, that we must personally be the presence of Christ to them.”\n\n###\n\n[post_title] => Bishop Knestout's Message for World Day of the Sick 2021 [post_excerpt] => [post_status] => publish [comment_status] => open [ping_status] => closed [post_password] => [post_name] => bishop-knestout-message-for-world-day-of-the-sick-2021 [to_ping] => [pinged] => [post_modified] => 2021-02-11 12:55:36 [post_modified_gmt] => 2021-02-11 17:55:36 [post_content_filtered] => [post_parent] => 0 [guid] => https://richmonddiocese.org/?p=126073 [menu_order] => 0 [post_type] => post [post_mime_type] => [comment_count] => 0 [filter] => raw ) [26] => WP_Post Object ( [ID] => 124713 [post_author] => 2 [post_date] => 2020-11-10 12:55:14 [post_date_gmt] => 2020-11-10 17:55:14 [post_content] => For Immediate Release: November 10, 2020 (RICHMOND, Va.) – Earlier today, the Vatican published an extensive report following an investigation of Theodore McCarrick, former cardinal of the Catholic Church (1930-2017).

None of the accused priests are currently serving in active ministry, nor have they recently served in ministry for the diocese. The diocese has not reached any conclusions regarding these allegations, rather this statement serves to announce the beginning of its inquiry into the allegations. Until this inquiry concludes, the accused are not deemed to have committed the acts alleged. At the same time, Bishop Knestout acknowledges it takes great courage to come forward to report allegations of this nature. “While the alleged incidents are from the past, we recognize the pain is still a deep and present reality for victim survivors of abuse and for their loved ones,” said Bishop Barry C. Knestout. “We continue to pray for their healing and for their loved ones who support them.” Bishop Knestout has prohibited all of the named diocesan clergy from any public ministry in the diocese while the allegations are being reviewed. As part of the Church process into the allegations, the Diocesan Review Board will make recommendations to Bishop Knestout. Based upon its findings, the Diocesan Review Board’s recommendations will assist Bishop Knestout with an appropriate response to the allegations. Then, Bishop Knestout will make a final determination. The Diocese has also notified the civil authorities. Fr. William Dinga, Jr. | Status: Retired Without Priestly Faculties Allegations of child sexual abuse have been made against Fr.

Knestout. \"Nuestras directrices han sido desarrolladas en base a protocolos de salud pública y estatales y en base a las circunstancias actuales, por lo que los protocolos pueden cambiar con el tiempo\". Las directrices enviadas a los sacerdotes el 13 de mayo por la oficina de Preparación de la diócesis detallan las instrucciones y la orientación a las parroquias, incluyendo el distanciamiento social de seis pies y el uso de cubrirse la cara por parte de todos los parroquianos reunidos de 3 años en adelante. Para más directrices y pautas específicas, véase \"Directrices para volver a la misa\". Lo que necesitas saber\". La reapertura sigue la orden ejecutiva 61 del gobernador Ralph Northam, que permite que los lugares de culto tengan servicios de hasta el 50% de la ocupación del área más baja del culto en el templo y otras directrices recomendadas. Durante este tiempo, el obispo Knestout continúa dispensando a los católicos de la obligación de asistir a misa los domingos y días festivos. La dispensación es debida al límite de capacidad para las liturgias reduciendo el número de feligreses y reconociendo a los individuos que se definen como \"vulnerables\". La dispensación está en vigor hasta nuevo aviso. \"Esperamos el día en que todos nos reunamos de nuevo, en que la distancia física no nos limite y podamos alegrarnos de la fuerza y la gracia que se nos ofrece en la Eucaristía\", dice el obispo Knestout. \"Sepan de mi profunda gratitud por su paciencia, apoyo y cooperación mientras trabajamos juntos como una comunidad católica durante este tiempo\". Las parroquias continuarán abiertas durante sus horarios regulares. Se les anima a que continúen con lo siguiente: misas en vivo, programar la celebración de misas públicas con tiempo adicional entre una y otra para permitir que el espacio de culto se limpie y desinfecte, y publicar las homilías y las grabaciones de las misas en el sitio web de la parroquia. Los católicos que tengan preguntas sobre la reapertura de las iglesias deben contactar con sus parroquias o [email protected] [post_title] => La celebración de misas públicas se reanuda en la diócesi de Richmond [post_excerpt] => [post_status] => publish [comment_status] => open [ping_status] => closed [post_password] => [post_name] => la-celebracion-de-misas-publicas-se-reanuda-en-la-diocesi-de-richmond [to_ping] => [pinged] => [post_modified] => 2020-05-15 17:51:06 [post_modified_gmt] => 2020-05-15 21:51:06 [post_content_filtered] => [post_parent] => 0 [guid] => https://richmonddiocese.org/?p=121806 [menu_order] => 0 [post_type] => post [post_mime_type] => [comment_count] => 0 [filter] => raw ) [30] => WP_Post Object ( [ID] => 120362 [post_author] => 2 [post_date] => 2020-03-16 14:32:08 [post_date_gmt] => 2020-03-16 18:32:08 [post_content] => UPDATED March 17, 2020 Bishop Barry C. Knestout has prohibited gatherings of more than 10 people for any ministry within the Catholic Diocese of Richmond. This is an updated directive from the March 16 press release issued by the diocese in light of Governor Ralph Northam’s press conference on Tuesday, March 17, in which he announced that gatherings of 10 or more people will be banned within the commonwealth.\n\n(en español)\n\nMarch 16, 2020\n\nDear Brothers and Sisters in Christ, As anxiety and concerns about the possible spread of COVID-19 takes root throughout this land and so much of the world, the Lord is speaking to us, calling us to a deeper relationship with him. This age may seem to be a time of fear and isolation, but we have an opportunity to see it in a new light, as a retreat into the desert with Our Lord and to encounter God in solitude and prayer. As Psalm 91 says:\n\n“You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day, nor the plague that prowls in the darkness, nor the scourge that lays waste at noon. A thousand may fall at our side, ten thousand fall at your right, you it will never approach; his faithfulness is buckler and shield.”\n\nGiven the necessary restrictions to public gatherings in the Commonwealth of Virginia, to ensure the common good, to provide for public health and safety, and yet to maintain the mission of the Church allowing access to the sacraments, to Church teaching and to works of charity in a way appropriate to the circumstances of our age, as well as to renew our spiritual vitality as a diocese during a time of Jubilee, I am instructing the following to take place within our diocese. As a suspension of all public celebrations of Mass, on Sundays, holy days and weekdays in the Diocese of Richmond takes place, and as the days grow longer and the light of spring begins to shine, opening our eyes to the goodness of God, I invite all the faithful in their homes and in the solitude of their hearts to draw close to Christ our light in prayer and interior desire for the Lord who dwells within our hearts – asking for the grace of forgiveness, recovery of our spiritual sight and of an awakening of desire for God to be strengthened within us. This weekend, during a private celebration of Mass at the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart and in the midst of our Jubilee year, I will celebrate Mass without a congregation, asking God’s grace and forgiveness, consecrating our diocese to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary. So that you may join me in this moment, it will be streamed live for the faithful. Each priest is to celebrate his daily Mass in private in the church or a chapel on behalf of the intentions of his parish and for the universal Church to assist all those affected by COVID-19. For the time being, I am instructing that during the daylight hours all of our parish churches are to keep their doors open for the possibility of private prayer or devotion. As the People of God of necessity go to the grocery store for food, they can also drop by their parish church to sustain their spiritual lives. If quarantines or greater public restrictions are put in place limiting to a greater degree public movement and gatherings, or if more than 50 people recommended by the CDC gather in the church building, it will be closed to further access from outside. While open, a porter, assigned by the pastor, is to be stationed during the daylight hours at the one unlocked door of the church so that no more than 50 people at any one time may be in the Church. Individually, and always keeping an appropriate social distance from one another, parishioners are free, during a time of fear and uncertainty, to come at their discretion during the day for personal devotion, communion by desire, to pray the rosary or the Stations of the Cross. I am also asking at this time that the Blessed Sacrament be move to the center of the large or main body of the church. Our Lord is to be reserved and secured in the tabernacle, clearly visible in the larger main body of the church throughout daylight hours especially Saturday and Sunday - so that during private devotion and prayer, appropriate social distancing can be maintained, which is impossible in the smaller adoration chapels. Priests are to be available for personal confessions at specific times of the day in a large adjacent room that would allow security, limited access and provide at least six feet of space between them and any penitent. Pastoral care by the priest to the sick is of utmost importance during this time. If a priest is unable to visit the sick for whatever reason or concerned with visiting sick because he fits one of the vulnerable categories, he will contact his dean. Communion will not normally be brought to any other parishioner who is homebound or who cannot attend Mass. Prayers for communion by desire will be widely available in the church and the parish website. Communion, if requested, will be brought to those who are near death when administering Viaticum. Lay volunteers will not be visiting the sick in any official capacity. Deacons may visit the sick using their discretion, taking into consideration their age or immunocompromised status. Essential charitable efforts to the poor and vulnerable will continue with some adaptations. Restrictions will be in place for no more than 25 people in a building at a time. It will be recommended that only individuals who are not within vulnerable groups or immunocompromised be the ones to assist the poor. Hot food service or seated food service in soup kitchens will be discontinued and replaced by grab-and-go options. All surfaces, including restrooms, must be sanitized frequently. Drop-off locations for donations should be outside the main facility thus limiting those who may be exposed to larger groups. With these provisions in place, we will continue with the Church’s mission: teaching the faith, celebrating the sacraments as needed in this age, and care for the poor, even as we support the common good and assure the health and well-being of our neighbor. As the world responds to this emergency, we turn our attention to the Holy Spirit to give us strength and courage in times of trial and suffering. We offer our prayers to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and ask the intercession of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. May we know the depths of the Lord’s merciful love and may Our Lady keep us in the mantle of her protection to intercede for us in our time of need. With the assurance of prayers for you and all affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, I am,\n\nSincerely in Christ,\n\nMost Reverend Barry C.

Burbidge of the Diocese of Arlington and Bishop Barry C. Knestout of the Diocese of Richmond issued the following statement on the passage of companion abortion bills yesterday and today by the Virginia House of Delegates (HB 980) and the Virginia Senate (SB 733) respectively: We ask all Catholics to step into the public square and to be witnesses of the Gospel on which our faith is founded. Because we believe that all life is a sacred gift from God, it is imperative for all people of faith to continue to speak and act on behalf of the unborn, especially those who will die if this legislation is enacted. We are saddened and deeply disappointed that a majority of Virginia’s elected leaders have chosen to pass bills that strip Virginia law of many longstanding provisions that protect unborn children and the health and safety of women. A just society respects life from the moment of conception until natural death, and we continue to call upon the Virginia General Assembly to reject any legislation that increases abortion access. Let us pray that members of the General Assembly will be guided by the love of God in opposing legislation that will result in the death of innocent human life. At the same time, we ask for all to pray for the mothers of these children that they will give them life and that we will support them in their needs. As the Senate now takes up consideration of HB 980 and the House takes up consideration of SB 733, the Virginia Catholic Conference urges pro-life Virginians to continue to voice their strong opposition to these bills. Voices of truth must be heard by our elected officials. This year’s Virginia March for Life is extraordinarily important, and we urge people throughout both the Arlington and Richmond Catholic Dioceses to join us on February 13 to show that Virginians are pro-life and expect their legislators to vote that way.\n\n###\n\n[post_title] => Statement by Bishop Burbidge and Bishop Knestout on Passage of Abortion Bills [post_excerpt] => [post_status] => publish [comment_status] => open [ping_status] => closed [post_password] => [post_name] => statement-by-bishop-burbidge-and-bishop-knestout-on-passage-of-abortion-bills [to_ping] => [pinged] => [post_modified] => 2020-01-31 09:07:56 [post_modified_gmt] => 2020-01-31 14:07:56 [post_content_filtered] => [post_parent] => 0 [guid] => https://richmonddiocese.org/?p=119664 [menu_order] => 0 [post_type] => post [post_mime_type] => [comment_count] => 0 [filter] => raw ) [32] => WP_Post Object ( [ID] => 119449 [post_author] => 2 [post_date] => 2020-01-17 12:00:29 [post_date_gmt] => 2020-01-17 17:00:29 [post_content] => January 17, 2020 It is with great sadness that I have received a letter from Bishop-Elect Susan Haynes stating that, due to the controversy of the proposed use of St. Bede Catholic Church for her consecration as the bishop for the Episcopal Diocese of Southern Virginia, she has decided to find another location for the ceremony to take place. In granting permission for this ordination to be held at St. Bede, we were welcoming, as the Fathers of the Second Vatican Council encouraged, those who have in common with us “the written Word of God; the life of grace; faith, hope and charity, with the other interior gifts of the Holy Spirit” (Decree on Ecumenism, 3). We were following the example of St. John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis who enthusiastically engaged in ecumenical outreach and hospitality. We look forward to continuing our ecumenical dialogue with the Episcopal community, and to working with Bishop-Elect Haynes in fortifying the long standing, cordial relationship between our communities and our joint service to the poor. As I assure Bishop-Elect Haynes of my prayers for her and the community she leads, I ask our Catholic faithful to pray for them, too, and to pray that the fruits of the Holy Spirit, along with humility, kindness, gentleness and joy, be expressed and strengthened in all our faith communities.

Barry C. Knestout, bishop of Richmond. “I am deeply saddened to see them leave our region as their departure will leave a profound void within our community that is irreplaceable. Yet, I am immensely grateful for the decades of humble service, selfless work, great love and devotion they have provided to the most vulnerable in our community. On a personal note, I have a very fond affection for the Little Sisters, as I witnessed firsthand their compassion and accompaniment of the dying when they lovingly cared for Cardinal James Hickey until his death in 2004 at the Jeanne Jugan Residence in Washington, D.C. While not a diocesan entity, I understand the impact such a difficult decision will have as this transition process moves forward and the current challenges the Little Sisters face as they work to continue to fulfill their mission around the world. I know our Catholic community holds the Little Sisters in high regard and I ask the faithful to keep them in your prayers in the weeks and months to come. Be assured of my continued prayers for them as well. Through the intercession of Saint Jeanne Jugan, and our Blessed Mother, Mary, may the Little Sisters continue to be guided in their work as they seek to make Jesus Christ present in the world.”\n\n###\n\nThe Little Sisters have served continuously in the Diocese of Richmond since 1874.

Knestout Statement Following the Holy Father’s Appointment of the Most Reverend Mark Brennan as Bishop of the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston\n\nI offer my congratulations and best wishes to Bishop Mark Brennan on his appointment by Pope Francis as shepherd of the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston. Having known Bishop Brennan for more than 40 years, I am certain that he will guide and serve the people of the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston with great pastoral care and dedication. He is a pastor’s pastor, one who is prayerful, modest and lives a simple life with an attitude of service to God and to the mission of his Church and people. Throughout my life, my path has crossed with Bishop Brennan’s many times. As a teenager, he served as parochial vicar at my home parish in Bowie, Saint Pius X. During my college years, he helped me discern my call to the priesthood and continued to offer me spiritual guidance in the years that followed. In my last year of seminary, Bishop Brennan became vocations director for the Archdiocese of Washington and was the one who provided the final recommendation to Cardinal Hickey to ordain me as a priest. I know Bishop Brennan will be a skillful administrator and provide gentle, careful and competent oversight for the financial and pastoral needs of the Wheeling-Charleston Diocese. The clergy, consecrated religious and lay faithful of the diocese will benefit greatly from his wisdom, counsel and great pastoral care. I look forward to working alongside him in the Baltimore province in the years to come. I assure Bishop Brennan of my prayers for him and that the people of our diocese will keep him in prayer as he is c"
