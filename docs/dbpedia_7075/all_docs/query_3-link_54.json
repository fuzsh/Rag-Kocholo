Judge Victoria Pratt learned that when the courtroom behaves differently, people behave differently. If you're not getting the results in business you want it could be because of how you're behaving. You may not be treating people with respect. You may need to act differently. What you put out comes right back at you. Judge Pratt put out love and what she got back surprised her. Show people the respect they deserve and act accordingly - you'll be shocked by the results :) Video Credit: TED #Motivation #Inspiration"
