        "text": "A MADly Idiotic Birthday!\n\nHappy 73rd birthday to the most prolific and longest-running writer in MAD Magazine history, MAD‘s Maddest writer Dick DeBartolo! Dick’s work first appeared in MAD #69, March 1962 (a piece he sold to the magazine while he was still in high school), and he has had work in 469 issues and counting ever since. He also has the record for the most consecutive issues appeared in with 452 (#103 to present). Dick’s work outside of MAD includes being a long-time writer for TV games shows and a popular podcast called “The Daily Giz Wiz” formerly on TWiT TV and now independently produced , appearances on TV and radio, etc. I did the above “caricature” of him for a piece in the “All Monkey issue” of MAD, where I portrayed the staff as monkeys or apes. Choosing Dick’s matching “monkey” was kind of a no brainer:\n\nHe also wrote a terrific book called Good Days and MAD that is a very funny peek behind the scenes of the magazine, and is an especially great look at Bill Gaines through the eyes of a very good friend, up through Bill’s passing. A must read for fans of MAD.\n\nDick wrote the very first piece I ever had published in MAD, “Gadgets to Really Make your Home Theater Like Going to the Movies” from #399, Nov. 2000. Since then we have collaborated on twenty-one other features, including nine movie parodies and eleven TV parodies. It’s always a pleasure working on one of his scripts.\n\nHappy Birthday, Dick!"
