        "text": "Yes, students at the University will be able to look forward to receiving two degree certificates as they will be gaining two degrees in one. The Richmond American University London dual degree is possible because, in addition to being able to award its own degrees in the UK, the University holds US degree-granting authority from the State of Delaware under accreditation by The Middle States Commission on Higher Education. Richmond is the first University to achieve this combination of US and UK degree-awarding powers. Please see here on the website for more information.\n\nYes. If your documents are not in English, please also provide official English language translations for them to be considered for application. We recommend you use UKVI translation requirements for guidance when finding a translator. If your application includes any documents which are not in English or Welsh, you must also include a translation of each document. Each translation must contain:\n\nconfirmation from the translator / translation company that it is an accurate translation of the original document\n\nthe date of the translation\n\nthe full name and signature of the translator, or of an authorised official of the translation company\n\nthe contact details of the translator or translation company; and\n\n(if you are already in the UK and are applying for further leave) certification by a qualified translator and details of the translator or translation company’s credentials.\n\nIf you do defer your start to the next academic intake, your fee status will not change from the one listed on your offer letter IF you are changing from a Fall intake to the following Spring (e.g. Fall 2024 to Spring 2025). For those changing to Fall to the next Fall, Spring to Fall, or Spring to Spring, the fees will change because they are reviewed for each academic year.\n\nAny English language score below the minimum grade required and published on the website (UG – English language requirements, PG – English language requirements) will unfortunately not be accepted (eg. a score of 59 in one of PTE exam’s modules for a postgraduate applicant). If you have not passed your test, please reschedule to take it again whenever possible and submit your results to our admissions department as soon as available. This is to ensure you may move forward to the next application stages and make it in time for your chosen academic intake. If you can’t afford or otherwise are not able to retake an in person test, we do have an online test we accept called the ELLT – you can see this here.\n\nYour CV should show all professional and educational experience, as well as a brief explanation of any employment gaps. You will also need to include a bulleted list of all job duties and responsibilities undertaken within each role, regardless of the number of years that you have been working. Please also label qualification titles and levels accurately so they match the file names provided as supporting documents with the application.\n\nWe don’t have a specific deadline by which an applicant must accept their offer, however, if you are considering joining our Fall intake, we would advise submitting your Offer Acceptance form by the end of the Spring (and by the end of Fall, if you are considering joining our Spring intake) to leave yourself sufficient time to go through the application process (as well as UK student visa process, if applicable), and avoid the potential disappointment of your preferred degree programme becoming full.\n\nYou will need to submit an Offer Acceptance form just as if you had applied through our website directly, however, to enable us to process this, we would require you to have accepted our offer on UCAS Track, by logging into UCAS and choosing us as your Firm choice. When this has been done, please confirm this via email and we will proceed with your form, which will enable us to progress your application.\n\nIf you have experienced an issue during your interview (e.g. Internet connection issues, no one joined the link), you may be able to reschedule a slot by re-using the link that was provided to you with your invite e-mail, if it is still recent. If you were unable to do so, please contact us at [email protected] as early as possible and we will request a new link for you.\n\nPlease do not pay anything to us before your interview. The deposit is only due when the following criteria have been met:\n\nThe student’s offer is unconditional\n\nThe student has accepted the offer by completing the offer acceptance form\n\nThe student successfully completes a pre-CAS interview\n\nIf the interview is successful, the student will receive an email from our Student Finance team with details of the deposit amount and instructions of making payment.\n\nUnfortunately, we are not able to offer applicants a second interview for the same entry term. You are welcome to defer your offer to the next intake, for which there would be another interview process – if you wish to do so, please email our admissions office ([email protected]), who will update your application record accordingly.\n\nYes, you can. The application process is the same as the normal process. Once you submit an application, our Registry team complete a TCE (Transfer Credit Evaluation) to determine how many credits you can transfer to us. We would look to give you as many credits as possible – both from your High School Qualifications and your University classes. You need to study with us for a minimum of 45 US credits (normally 3 semesters/1.5 years) to get a Richmond degree. You can read more about credit transfer by clicking here – we can only give you credit for university courses at grade C, 50% or above.\n\nYou can view and download your unofficial transcript via your Self Service account if you still have access to it. If you no longer have access to Self Service, I’m afraid you will have to order your official transcript as we are not authorised to send transcripts (official or unofficial) electronically.\n\nIf you would like a virtual copy of a graduation/verification letter you can order one from the Richmond store here. Transcripts are mailed and will take 2-3 days for courier, or around 3-4 weeks for international standard orders. The replacement diploma can take up to 8 weeks to be sent to you.\n\nAs a US institution, applicants transfer individual credits, rather than transferring into a specific year as they would do when completing a standard UK degree (e.g., you won’t be able to join us on a top up degree giving you direct entry into the final year of your chosen degree programme). When you have submitted your final transcripts and your offer has been made unconditional, these transcripts are referred to our Registry Services department who will assess your transfer credit eligibility by undertaking a TCE (Transfer Credit Evaluation). This will confirm which previously completed credits are eligible for transfer, the number of classes you will need to complete as part of your Richmond degree and provide you with an estimated time of graduation.\n\nIf you need a student visa to study, you must apply for one after receiving and accepting an unconditional offer from us. To that end, it is crucial that you submit an application to us while leaving a reasonable time frame to apply for a student visa. We recommend this is at least 6 months before your preferred entry term.\n\nStandard Visitor visa: If you are coming to the UK for less than six months and do not plan to do an internship or voluntary work as part of your studies then you need a Standard Visitor visa\n\nStudent Route visa: If you are coming to the UK for more than six months, or less than six months but plan to undertake an internship or voluntary work as part of your studies then you will need a Student Route visa\n\nFor information and guidance about how to apply for a Standard Visitor visa and the documents you will need to prepare please see our visa guidance document.\n\nNationals of the USA, Japan, South Korea and other non-visa nationals who are planning to travel to the UK via the Republic of Ireland, and enter the UK as a short-term student can find more information on the UKCISA website.\n\nAll other Visa nationals can find more information regarding entry to the United Kingdom on the Government Home Office website.\n\nIf you are planning on arriving in the UK via the Common Travel Area, you should apply for UK entry clearance as a visitor before travelling to the Republic of Ireland. More information can be found on the UKCISA web pages.\n\nA CAS number (Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies) is an electronic 14 digit reference number that you will need in order to apply for your Student Route visa. You must have a CAS before making a Student visa application. A CAS is an electronic document issued to you by the institution that you have chosen to study at. Your CAS will be valid for use in a Student visa application for six months from the date that it was generated by your institution. Please refer to the Admissions section for more information on deposits and further steps.\n\nIf you are an incoming undergraduate student, you will not receive access to your university email until you firmly accept your offer or pay our deposit (if applicable). You will be sent an email explaining how to log into your university email. Once you have done so, you will be asked to complete a Pre-Orientation Checklist, this is a brief online form that confirms your place at Richmond American University London.\n\nIf the steps within the Pre-Orientation Checklist have been completed and we do not need any additional information from you, then in the week leading up to Orientation you will receive an email invitation to the university portal, Blackboard. This is where the majority of orientation will take place.\n\nKeep an eye on your inbox!\n\nIf you submit the Pre-Orientation Checklist, but it is incomplete or a staff member contacts you for additional information based on your responses, those tasks need to be completed prior to receiving an invitation to Blackboard.\n\nIf you are having any trouble with this, please email [email protected]\n\nAll Richmond American University London students receive a personalised email address, like this: [email protected]\n\n(eg: [email protected]).\n\nYou can access your email from any University PC or off-campus via Office365 from this webpage here (please favourite it for future reference).\n\nTo log in to O365 use the following information:\n\nUser name: [email protected]\n\nPassword: Richmond, followed date of birth in UK format (DDMMYY) e.g. Richmond202000\n\nYou will then be prompted to enter a new password of your choosing, please be mindful of our origination’s password requirements.\n\nYour password must:\n\nBe at least 8 characters long.\n\nNot include your first or last name.\n\nContain a special character (#~(){}[]!£$%^&*?<>+-=_;:’,)\n\nContain a number.\n\nContain an upper- and lower-case letter.\n\nThere are 3 available networks:\n\nRICHUNI. Login with your University username and password.\n\nRichmond-Guest. Register your details on the browser page.\n\nEDUROAM a worldwide wifi service provided by universities across the globe. Connect using your University email address (e.g. [email protected]) and password (Note: If your Connect button is greyed out, you may need to change the CA certificate settings to ‘Don’t validate’).\n\nIf you are using an Android please make sure you select The EAP method as PEAP.\n\nPhase 2 authentication as MSCHAPV2\n\nSet Online certificate status to Do not Validate\n\nIf you require assistance connecting your laptop, tablet or phone, staff will be available at IT helpdesk (Student Hub) during orientation and beyond, 10am-4pm Monday-Friday (excluding University Holidays and Closures).\n\nPlease note that we cannot guarantee connection for other devices, such as games consoles, TVs etc.\n\nYou will get your student ID as part of arrival check-in process. To expedite this process, please submit your photo in advance (if you haven’t already). Here are directions on how to do so:\n\nRichmond American University London requires a passport style photo of all new students in order to process their ID cards. Your photos must show a close-up of your full head and shoulders. It must be only of you with no other objects or people, facing forward and looking straight at the camera. The photo must meet our standards or your photo will be rejected and you will be required to resubmit a new image.\n\nIn order to avoid long waiting times on orientation day, please use the following web application to take a passport photo of yourself www.epassportphoto.com. Once your photos are ready, please save them as a JPG file with your full name and send them to [email protected].\n\nRichmond will ask all students interested in housing to complete a pre-booking form. This form is to verify your admission status and to clarify your housing contract length. Visiting students, graduating seniors and students enrolled to study abroad at one of Richmond’s partner organisations will be offered an 18-week contract. All other degree students will be offered a 40-week contract. Once your booking form is complete, we will contact you with a unique link to apply for housing with iQ West Hampstead. You can then check availability and book the room of your choice.\n\nIf you are a visiting student for one semester, you will be required to pay the housing for the full term upfront. You will receive an invoice from our finance team. If you are a degree student, you are able to pay in 3 equal instalments per term. You will need to enrol yourself on this payment plan with the finance team directly. If you are a visiting student or degree student looking to use financial aid or scholarships to pay for housing, you will need to provide our finance team with a proof of loan/scholarship and complete the payment after the money has been disbursed to you.

You can write about why you wish to study in London or at Richmond, what your desired major is and why or any other topic, perhaps a part of your personality or life that you feel is not represented in any other section of your application.
