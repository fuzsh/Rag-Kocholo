        "text": "Donna Meade is a former Mercury-Polygram recording artist and a member of Virginia’s Country Music Hall of Fame. A singer, musician and songwriter since age 14, Donna was a cast member of the 1973 revival of the Old Dominion Barn Dance.\n\nIn 1981 she moved to Nashville and soon began appearing on local and national TV, while headlining in the World Famous Stockyard’s Bullpen Lounge. In 1989, Donna landed a recording contract with Mercury-Polygram Records and was signed as a songwriter with the prestigious music publisher Sony/Tree. While appearing on The Nashville Now Show starring Ralph Emery, the rising star and New Female Vocalist of the Year nominee met her future husband Jimmy Dean. For over two decades they resided in Richmond, performing & writing songs together & traveling the world promoting Jimmy Dean Foods.\n\nSince Dean’s passing in 2010, Donna is enjoying performing again as well as producing the Old Dominion Barn Dance. She is the writer of the Barn Dance theme, and her childhood sweetheart and husband of 13 years, Jayson Stevens, serves as production manager. Donna is proud to revive and preserve Virginia’s venerable country music show by presenting the best in traditional country and Bluegrass entertainment, and is honored to be serving as hostess!\n\nLee Blasingame is a multi-talented comedian, singer, voiceover artist and master of ceremonies who has endeared himself to our audiences since this revival began. As a member of the 1990s cast of The Old Dominion Opry in Williamsburg, VA, he was the perfect choice for featured vocalist, comedian and announcer for the Barn Dance.\n\nLee’s professional credits also include performing at Busch Gardens and Nashville’s Opryland, where he appeared alongside country music legend Brenda Lee. You may have also heard his voice on feature-length animated movies for the Christian Broadcast Network, or seen him on television’s The Forensic Files and The New Detectives.\n\nWith his comedic characters like Barney the Janitor, Jerry Clower and Elvis, Lee always adds great fun to our show, and as a featured vocalist he always delivers a first class performance with his amazing voice. The Barn Dance is always proud to present this versatile and talented performer!\n\nA natural born performer originally from Atlanta, Ga. Patsy Hockaday always knew she wanted to sing. Her musical journey includes performing with different bands throughout the years, and being honored with a standing ovation by Patsy Cline’s mother and sister after singing a medley of Cline’s hits.\n\nPatsy, with her warm vocals and personality to match, is not only a seasoned performer but also a former Worship Leader, having spoken and sung for many Women’s Ministries and other Ministry Events. In 2012, she formed her own band in Fredericksburg, VA. called Patsy and the Country Classics. To promote their band, she entered the Ms. Senior Virginia Pageant, where she won the title much to her surprise. Patsy was even more surprised when she competed in the national pageant against 42 other contestants, becoming Ms. Senior America 2014.\n\nSince that time, Patsy has won many accolades and awards for her country and gospel recordings, and we’re sure you will enjoy this talented lady for her performance on our show.\n\nThese ladies with roots in Appalachia, Virginia are true coal miner’s daughters. Deanna, Betty and Mary have been singing and playing music since they were young girls, heavily influenced by their mother and father who sang and played in their family’s band. The Mullins Sisters continue on with the family’s legacy, playing and singing with their own popular group around the Central Virginia area.\n\nDeanna is an accomplished songwriter, singer and musician who plays piano and guitar, Betty is also an accomplished singer and musician who plays bass guitar, and Mary lends her amazing vocals to the group that rounds out their impeccable blend of sibling harmonies. Whether singing background vocals or as featured vocalists in the spotlight, these extraordinarily talented ladies always shine bright on the Barn Dance!\n\nAfter impressing the judges with his energetic performance in our 2022 Talent Search, winner Scotty Batten was invited to join our cast in 2024.\n\nAt just 24 years old, Scotty’s story is pretty amazing in itself. A lifelong native of Greene County, Virginia, this determined and accomplished young man has spent almost a decade serving the citizens of Greene County through police, fire, EMS, and funeral services, all while honing his talents as a singer and songwriter.\n\nScotty’s musical journey began while singing in his school’s talent show as a third grader, and continued for years at church and other settings. His passion for music and living a life of service has inspired him to write his own music and donate his time and talents at benefit concerts, while helping to raise funds for various organizations and individuals in need in his community of Ruckersville. In 2023, Scotty purchased his hometown’s premier funeral home where he’d been employed for many years, now called Batten Funeral Home.\n\nWe proudly present this exceptional young man and are sure you will enjoy Scotty’s talents!\n\nFRONT ROW : MICHAEL HOCKADAY, BOB LAWLER, RYLAND TINNELL, AUDIE STANLEY AND JW BELDEN.\n\nThe Barn Burners consist of some of Central Virginia’s most talented Country Rockers. A member of our staff band since 2014, Ryland is the only steel guitarist ever inducted into Virginia’s Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nThe word ‘dynamic’ describes our keyboard player, J.W. Belden, a multi-talented and much sought after musician who hails from a Grammy award-winning family. Also a member of our band since 2014, J.W. brings great energy to the stage with his amazing skills on piano, organ and strings.\n\nBesides playing bass guitar for the Barn Burners, Audie Stanley is also a talented vocalist who sings bass for our Old Dominion Barn Dance Quartet. As a second generation Bam Dance performer, Audie’s father, Cotton Stanley, was a star on our show during the 1950 ‘s with his popular Bluegrass band. Audie is a former member of the Robbin Thompson Band and currently performs with the local group Honky Tonk Heroes.\n\nBob Lawler is an amazing multi-instrumentalist who adds great versatility to our band, playing rhythm and lead guitars, banjo, mandolin, fiddle, steel guitar and drums. A veteran of local bands, Bob is in much demand and plays regularly with several different groups in the area.\n\nDrummer and featured vocalist Michael Hockaday hails from Ruther Glen, VA, and is the newest member of our band. He is also a veteran of local bands, and currently enjoys playing music with his talented wife Patsy and their popular group, Patsy and the Country Classics.\n\nAll five of these incredible musicians are hard-working and dedicated to bringing the best music possible to the Barn Dance, and we are proud to have such an amazing group as our staff band. With so many hot musicians, the Barn Burners are guaranteed to burn the house down!\n\nBarn Dance Fiddler Diane Hossinger is known for her powerful and energetic fiddle playing. Originally from Newport News, VA, and classically trained from the age of 9, she began performing country music in 2008 and hasn’t looked back.\n\nDiane began her professional career performing at Busch Gardens and has since performed along the East Coast and in Bermuda. She has spent the past several years entertaining audiences with her fiddle playing and background vocals in Richmond based band, Harley Boone. Diane is the newest member of our cast and says she is honored to be a part of the Old Dominion Barn Dance."
