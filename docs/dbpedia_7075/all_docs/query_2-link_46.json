        "text": "Democratic leaders in the Virginia Senate thought they could go their own way on the scheduling and policy agenda for a rare June special session. But things didn’t go according to plan Tuesday as the Senate spent a whole day in Richmond without taking up a single bill.\n\nSupporters of bills to legalize skill games and reverse recent cost-cutting measures imposed on a program that allows some military families to get tuition-free college filled a meeting room Tuesday morning to see the Senate act on the two hot-button issues that were expected to be on the agenda.\n\nVirginia Senate set to take up military tuition program, skill games\n\nThe Senate committee that was supposed to get the day rolling Tuesday morning gaveled in an hour late as senators repeatedly ducked in and out of backroom huddles. And when the Senate Finance and Appropriations Committee meeting got underway, Chair Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, announced the committee wouldn’t be voting on either topic after all.\n\nWhen that committee meeting ended, Democrats leaders hinted they had a backup plan in the works as they headed to the Senate floor. When that plan also failed to gain traction, the Senate wrapped up its day without much of anything happening except speeches.\n\n“I’m livid. It’s ridiculous,” said Norfolk military wife Suzanne Wheatley. “I took a day out of my life, I took a day out of my child’s life, to be here.”\n\nThe lack of action left both issues in limbo as the Senate left town again with a vague agreement to reconvene by July 1.\n\nWheatley and several other people who traveled to Richmond Tuesday expressed disgust over what they saw as a round of political sniping over veteran benefits that went nowhere and gave them no clarity on what the state intends to do about the Virginia Military Survivors and Dependents Education Program, or VMSDEP.\n\n“It’s a move-the-goalposts exercise,” said Stafford County military veteran and advocate Caitlin Goodale-Porter.\n\nVMSDEP waives public higher education for spouses and children of military members killed or severely disabled as a result of their service. Alarmed by a spike in the numbers of students using the benefit and the associated costs for state colleges, policymakers recently changed the rules of the program to make fewer families eligible for it.\n\nA bipartisan budget deal approved last month imposed a stricter Virginia residency requirement, prevents the waivers from being used for advanced degrees or a second undergraduate degree and requires participants to first pursue other forms of financial aid and only use VMSDEP for remaining costs.\n\nThough Democrats have pointed out many Republicans backed the VMSDEP changes before demanding that they be reversed, Democrats are split over whether they should go along with Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s call to immediately repeal the VMSDEP reforms. The inaction Tuesday gave Republicans an easier opening to argue dysfunction in the Democratic-controlled legislature was preventing a policy misstep from being fixed.\n\nLucas refused to docket a bill backed by the Senate Republicans and at least four Senate Democrats, numbers that could’ve given the legislation enough votes to pass in a chamber where Democrats hold a slim 21-19 majority.\n\n“I stand with our military heroes, first responders, and their families today who are stunned that Senate Democrat leadership failed to even consider a simple bill, supported by a bipartisan majority of Senators, to reverse the changes to VMSDEP by fully repealing the language, and addressing this in the full light of day,” Youngkin said in a statement late Tuesday afternoon. “These men and women deserve so much better.”\n\nTwo Democratic lawmakers — Sens. Jennifer Boysko, D-Fairfax and Suhas Subramanyam, D-Loudoun — were absent from the Capitol Tuesday as they both competed in a congressional primary election the same day. Given the lack of votes in the Senate, it’s unclear if their absence affected Democrats’ decision to not bring any bills to the floor. All 19 Republicans were present, giving the GOP equal voting strength to Democrats with Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears acting as the tie-breaker.\n\nBoth parties in the House of Delegates have expressed support for passing a complete repeal bill like the one Lucas blocked when the House returns to the Capitol on June 28.\n\nDemocratic leaders in the Senate said it was Republicans who were being intransigent by refusing to work with the majority party.\n\n“The Republican caucus wouldn’t cooperate with us on any of the two solutions we proposed,” Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, told reporters after the Senate finished for the day.\n\nLucas had filed a bill partially rolling back the VMSDEP changes by ensuring that anyone using VMSDEP to enroll in classes this fall wouldn’t be impacted by the eligibility changes and exempting the families of veterans killed or wounded in combat with a 90% disability rating. Democrats have said that proposal would reduce the disruption to college plans military families say they’ve experienced since the budget was passed, while also moving the program closer to its original purpose of helping families impacted by war instead of being a more open-ended benefit.\n\nAt the committee meeting, Lucas faulted the governor as she explained the decision to not take up her own bill. On Monday, Youngkin’s office had said the governor would not act on a skill game bill until the General Assembly had fully repealed the VMSDEP changes.\n\n“Yesterday the governor seemed to indicate that he wouldn’t sign a skill game bill until after the VMSDEP changes are repealed,” Lucas said. “I’m not going to pit constituents against each other. We care about all of you. We need solutions on both issues. And we’ll have to continue working in both.”\n\nLucas announced that she was creating a legislative work group to study VMSDEP and directing the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission to take a deeper look at data showing how the program is or isn’t working as intended. Youngkin has already convened his own task force to study the program.\n\nDemocrats proposed another VMSDEP fix: simply delaying the effective date of the changes until Oct. 1 while the work group conducted its research. That idea went nowhere, Surovell said, because Republicans wouldn’t agree to help Democrats with procedural votes to get it onto the floor Tuesday.\n\nVirginia House and Senate will take up military tuition benefit on different days\n\nWhen questioned by reporters as she left the Capitol, Lucas didn’t give a clear answer on what she would do if the House sends the Senate a VMSDEP bill like the one she blocked Tuesday.\n\n“I’ll make up my mind then,” she said.\n\nIn floor speeches, several Republicans senators blasted the process as fundamentally undemocratic, suggesting Lucas’s rule over her committee shouldn’t outweigh the majority opinion of the 40-person Senate.\n\nThe bill to fully repeal the VMSDEP changes, said Sen. Glen Sturtevant, R-Chesterfield, has “majority support in the Senate.”\n\n“And yet despite these folks getting up early today and driving here, they didn’t get to have that bill heard,” he said.\n\nRepublicans could have attempted to bring the full repeal bill to the floor over Lucas’s objections, a little-used parliamentary move that effectively lets the full body override the wishes of a committee chair. Sen. Bryce Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, said the GOP chose not to use that “nuclear option” out of deference to Senate tradition. But he took exception to Lucas’ decision not to docket the repeal bill he co-sponsored and said he’s unsure what might happen when the House sends over its version.\n\n“I’m not confident of anything right now to be honest with you,” Reeves said. “Other than we wasted a bunch of taxpayers’ money coming down here with our thumbs up our butt getting nothing done.”\n\nSen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, accused Republicans of politicizing the issue and taking a “my way or the highway” approach to the conversation.\n\n“It has become more of a political discussion than a policy discussion,” Locke said.\n\nSurovell told reporters the criticism of how Lucas is wielding her power is overstated, because committee chairs frequently have to decide to docket some bills and not others in the compressed time frame of a special session.\n\n“I don’t know why it should be any different now that there’s a Black woman chairing the committee,” he said.\n\nFriends of VMSDEP, the main advocacy group opposing the recent eligibility changes, blasted Lucas for her actions Tuesday. In a statement, the group said Lucas and other skill game supporters had “hijacked” the day to “try to unleash an unprecedented expansion of gambling across the commonwealth” instead of addressing the needs of veterans.\n\nAdvocates for legalizing skill games were also left wondering what the Senate’s decisions Tuesday meant. In a statement, the pro-skill game Virginia Merchants and Amusements Coalition said it hopes lawmakers “will come together on a resolution when they reconvene.”\n\nby Graham Moomaw, Virginia Mercury\n\nVirginia Mercury is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

That’s changed over the past year in what’s colloquially referred to as “Medicaid Unwinding” as provisions of federal law have expired.\n\nA top reason for disenrolling people from Medicaid is that they no longer meet the financial requirements to be eligible — such as income at or below 80% of federal poverty levels.\n\nWhile the ineligibility data could point to higher incomes which can be a good thing for people, policy analysts at The Commonwealth Institute caution that is not always the case when it comes to health insurance coverage.\n\nFinancial disqualifications from Medicaid don’t always mean someone has health insurance otherwise, TCI policy director Freddy Mejia explained.\n\nExamples could be someone having a combination of part time jobs tallying up to their overall income — which wouldn’t entail employer-sponsored insurance — or people might have a temporary spike in income through seasonal work that kicks them off eligibility for Medicaid.\n\nThere are also non-financial reasons to be removed, which can include procedural hiccups like not submitting proper paperwork for reenrollment on time.\n\n“We’re seeing a lot of people come off Medicaid enrollment, but we don’t have a clue what is happening with them,” Mejia said. “Future data will take time to see who is uninsured or not after this.”\n\nMedicaid is a state and federal program that provides insurance coverage to low-income people or people with disabilities. For some people, having Medicaid or even employer-offered insurance may not be enough. For instance, Virginia’s free clinics report an uptick in patients in recent years.\n\nSome of these patients are dubbed “ALICE patients,” — or asset-limited, income-constrained, employed people.\n\nRufus Phillips, CEO of the Virginia Association of Free and Charitable Clinics, said the demographic was contributing to patient uptick even before the pandemic.\n\n“The pinch is much greater on what we used to know as the middle class,” he said.\n\nThe clinics around the state have been a key point of healthcare access for some of Virginia’s poorest residents along with immigrant and refugee families. They are also a resource for people who are between jobs and insurance coverage — the “safety net to the safety net,” Phillips said.\n\nMejia noted how more uninsured people can continue to strain Virignia’s free clinics and Federally Qualified Health Centers who may need to serve larger populations than their resources will be able to handle.\n\nIn the meantime, there are still about 69,000 people who are still awaiting redetermination for Medicaid. A spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services said that number is a backlog of members that are about 3% of the “total unwinding cohort.”\n\nby Charlotte Rene Woods, Virginia Mercury\n\nVirginia Mercury is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

And with crossings at the U.S.’s southern border higher in recent years, immigration policy is a key platform in this year’s elections and a top issue for some Virginia voters.\n\nViginians’ views varied on presidential hopefuls’ immigration stances\n\nRepublican presidential nominee and former President Donald Trump’s vision, and the GOP’s, has been to continue constructing a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and to ramp up deportations of those who’ve entered the country illegally. Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris’, and Democrats’, vision has been to enhance pathways to citizenship and address root causes that lead to spikes in migration. They’ve also attempted to work with Republicans on boosting funding for border security, but efforts have failed.\n\nAt the state level, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares have been critical of the Biden administration’s border policies. Both endorsed Trump when he won primary elections this spring and both joined him when he held a rally in Chesapeake this summer.\n\nTrump has an established history of false claims about immigrants. He alleged without proof that other countries are releasing droves of people from prisons and mental institutions to come into America, among other claims.\n\nThat rhetoric is a “desperate racist play to bring out white suburban voters,” said Del. Alfonso Lopez, D-Alexandria, who is among Virginia’s delegates who will vote for Harris at the Democratic National Convention this month.\n\nMeanwhile Loudoun County resident and longtime Republican activist Jo-Ann Chase said Trump’s hardline stance on immigration is one of the reasons she was excited to vote for him last month at the Republican National Convention as a Virginia delegate.\n\n“We are white, brown and Black,” Chase said of Latino and Hispanic voters, a group with which she personally identifies. A lifelong Republican, she’s spent time working on outreach for the party, particularly to Hispanic and Latino communities. She also served on Youngkin’s Virginia Latino Advisory Board.\n\nChase said that she hasn’t been bothered by Trump’s rhetoric painting migrants from Latin countries with a broad stroke as criminals. In a speech announcing his first presidential candidacy in 2015, Trump said that Mexico “isn’t sending their best” and that immigrants are “bringing crime, they’re rapists.”\n\nChase said it never offended her.\n\n“I understood that he didn’t say that everyone was like that — but there were a lot of people like that,” she said. “And to ensure that [violent criminals don’t enter], he was going to make sure that the individuals coming across the border did it the right way.”\n\nBorn in Puerto Rico, Chase has always been an American citizen, but she’s lived stateside and been active in Republican politics for much of her life. She feels the border policy during the Biden-Harris administration has been “rewarding” people for breaking the law by entering the country illegally. As she’s canvassed on behalf of the GOP over the past few months, a top concern she’s heard from potential Republican voters in Virginia is immigration policy and border security, she said.\n\nFormer state delegate Elizabeth Guzman, who is originally from Peru, said she is excited to cast her vote for Harris at the DNC this month. Guzman said she thinks her daughters will see Harris’ candidacy and“believe that they could be presidents one day,” since Harris is, like them, the daughter of immigrant parents.\n\nShe and Lopez said that recently, they’ve been frustrated by how Republicans are framing their party as soft on the border, because Democrats were working with them on the bill this year to bolster border security.\n\nLopez alleged that Republicans reneging on the bill — a move that included one of its patrons — allowed immigration to remain a key talking point for Trump’s campaign, and that of congressional representative hopefuls, going into November.\n\nIt’s “hypocritical with a capital H” for the GOP to say “look at all this horrible stuff on the border” when they weren’t following through on a solution months prior, Lopez said\n\nMichelle Mittlestadt, a communications director with the Migration Policy Institute, said the GOP messaging is “an expected move” given the salience of immigration for the party.\n\nImmigration will continue to be a hot topic, regardless of whether Harris or Trump win the White House or which party controls Congress, Mittlestadt said. But, determining which parts of immigration and border security policy will take center stage is the question.\n\nContinuing challenges, inside and outside the state\n\nSeventy percent of new U.S. citizens last year reside in 10 states, including Virginia, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers in Virginia have proposed legislation to support some of its immigrant populations, such as bills this year to allow undocumented minors access to state-funded healthcare and eligibility for careers in law enforcement to certain immigrants. The healthcare bill failed in committee and the law enforcement bill passed with bipartisan support before it was vetoed by Youngkin.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. immigration policy at the national level has been rather stagnant for decades.\n\nTypically, to become a U.S. Citizen, people have to apply and have met certain criteria to continue the process. That includes having been a permanent resident in the U.S for at least five years — or in other words, have held a green card or special visa for that amount of time.\n\nPeople in the immigration process can usually apply for special visas through family stateside sponsoring them or being married to a citizen. Others may qualify for refugee status. Some people — like the thousands of migrant farmers employed in Virginia — may hold temporary work visas. Others seek employment-based green cards so they can live and work in the U.S. permanently.\n\nBut there’s a cap on employment-based green cards at 140,000 per year, a number that hasn’t moved in decades.\n\n“People that come here illegally do so because they can’t come legally,” Mittelstadt said.\n\nWith an estimated population of 11 million undocumented people in America, she said “that is a sign of the fact that the legal immigration system does not match employer, family reunification, and humanitarian protection needs.”\n\nAddressing the cap on green card types would be a place to start, she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Guzman noted some other “low hanging fruit” she hopes federal lawmakers could agree on, like pathways to citizenship for Temporary Protected Status holders and DACA recipients.\n\nTPS holders are people coming from specifically designated countries that are dealing with issues that endanger citizens, such as ongoing armed conflict or environmental disasters.Some of these people may wish to live in America permanently as a result.\n\nDACA stands for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The roughly decade-old program has allowed for some children of undocumented immigrants to remain stateside, but it doesn’t guarantee them the opportunity to become citizens.\n\nCreating the DACA program was the “last time Congress really worked” on immigration issues successfully, Lopez said.\n\n“You have to be able to pull multiple levers at the same time,” Mittelstadt of Migration Policy Institute said. “It can’t just be in border enforcement. It can’t just be dealing with root causes in Central America. It can’t just be, you know, individual ad hoc actions.”\n\nAddressing immigration issues will take sustained collective action by local, state and federal leaders, she said. Until then, she said, one thing remains apparent.\n\n“The immigration system that we have today is not firing on all cylinders.”\n\nby Charlotte Rene Woods, Virginia Mercury\n\nAs Virginia schools reopen for a new school year, most of those serving low-income students or those identified as “at-risk” will receive $371.3 million in additional funding over the next two school years, according to the state budget.\n\nLawmakers redirected approximately $650 million each year and added around $180 million yearly to develop the at-risk program. Most localities have opted into the program, which helps to provide sufficient funding for schools to serve low-income students in Virginia.\n\nData from the Department of Education shows that at-risk students comprised approximately 43% of Virginia’s total enrollment last year.\n\nUnderfunded schools, under-resourced students\n\nThe state investment comes after localities urged lawmakers to address Virginia’s historical underfunding of its school divisions. This was backed by a July 2023 study from the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission that found Virginia schools receive 14% less state funding than the 50-state average, roughly $1,900 less per student.\n\n“Any additional money that the state provides to local governments to the local school divisions to help restore the balance in the funding relationship to what it should be based on the JLARC [recommendations] is greatly appreciated and is a good first step,” said Jeremy Bennett, director of intergovernmental affairs for the Virginia Association of Counties.\n\nBennett said the report shows that local governments and school divisions are “paying billions more than they’re required to by the state because we recognize that the cost of providing quality education is higher than what is recognized on the state’s current funding formula.”\n\nDel. Rae Cousins, D-Richmond, who carried unsuccessful at-risk add-on legislation based on JLARC’s recommendations, said changes to the program will help support at-risk students with potentially more one-on-one instructional time, more nutritional school meals, and before-and after-school programs.\n\n“Our schools just didn’t have the resources that those [at-risk] students needed to be successful,” Cousins said.\n\nLocal leaders said funding formulas that underestimated the needs of school divisions and a cap on the number of support positions the state would fund enacted amid the Great Recession in 2007 have contributed to the lack of funding.\n\nLawmakers partially lifted the cap last summer by investing $152 million in school support positions, but funding levels were never restored.\n\nRecommended changes for the at-risk program\n\nAfter finding the previous add-on program for at-risk students relied on outdated free lunch data, JLARC recommended changing the state code and language in the Appropriation Act to designate the at-risk add-on program as a Standards of Quality funding program, which would signify that the funding is “essential for providing Virginia K–12 students with a quality education.”\n\nResearchers also recommended changes to allow for the federally-approved Identified Student Percentage (ISP) measure to calculate funding for all at-risk programs that relied on outdated free lunch estimates.\n\nAccording to the two-year budget lawmakers adopted in May, funding would be allocated based on each school division’s weighted ISP.\n\nAs part of the new program, 60% of funding would be distributed to divisions using a flat per-student rate, and 40% would be distributed using a variable rate based on the concentration of poverty in each school division.\n\nSchool divisions that opt into the program will receive a minimum 11% basic aid add-on per estimated at-risk student and an additional add-on to basic aid varying between 0% and 37%, depending on the number of at-risk students relative to other school divisions.\n\nSen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, carried legislation that would have added at-risk add-on funding to the Standards of Quality, as well as updated the funding formula to “ensure that money designated for our highest-need students doesn’t go unused,” in a statement to the Mercury.\n\nHowever, the legislation was incorporated into an unsuccessful bill vetoed by the governor after the legislature failed to accept his recommendations. If the bill had been successful, the program would have been a mandatory part of the Standards of Quality.\n\nThe Joint Subcommittee to Study Elementary and Secondary Education Funding, which will be meeting for the first time on Sept. 16, was created to provide direction and oversight of Standards of Quality funding cost policies and make recommendations.\n\nLocal governments that opt into the at-risk add-on program are responsible for providing a local match to receive state funding.\n\nby Nathaniel Cline, Virginia Mercury\n\nVirginia Mercury is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.
