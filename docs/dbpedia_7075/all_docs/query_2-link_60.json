Such issues include, but are not limited to, obtaining informed consent prior to using tissues from clinical sources if individually identifiable, the need for education of research volunteers about what may happen to biospecimens collected for future research, and the need for transparency about forms of compensation or whether or not gain-sharing from research results is possible or even appropriate.5 In this column, we call attention to efforts by Tuskegee University and the Commonwealth of Virginia to preserve the legacy of Henrietta Lacks and to the unfolding ethical and policy impacts of the Henrietta Lacks story.\n\nThe Story\n\nHenrietta Lacks was a 31-year-old African American woman with five children. She was born to a poor Southern tobacco farmer and worked the same land as her enslaved ancestors. She was raised in Clover, Virginia, where she is also buried. In 1951, she complained to doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital’s Gynecology Clinic in Baltimore, Maryland of spotting between her menstrual periods. Johns Hopkins was the only hospital near her that would treat Black patients. An examination of her cervix revealed a lesion confined to the cervix. A biopsy of the cervix was performed, and four pieces of tissue were taken, some sent to the pathology department for diagnostic evaluation, and some given to Dr. George Gey’s tissue culture laboratory at Johns Hopkins. While Henrietta Lacks gave “operation permit” or consent for surgery, no one asked her permission to collect or share her samples for other reasons. It is worth noting that consent to medical procedures had been in place since 1914 after the court case Schloendorf v. Society of New York Hospital, 211 N.Y. 125. Consent for medical research was codified in the Nuremberg Code of 1949, and informed consent became popular in medical practice in 1957 following Salgo v. Leland Stanford Jr. Board of Trustees, 154 Cal. App. 2d 560. Lacks was diagnosed with “epidermoid carcinoma,” with definite invasion of the stroma, and an aggressive form of cancer, adenocarcinoma of the cervix.6 As she was seen at that time as a poorly educated, indigent Black female without health insurance and with modest finances, she was placed in the hospital’s ward for impoverished people. During the next several months, she received radiation treatment, which failed to prevent the spread of the cancer. She developed severe abdominal pain and experienced failure to void urine. Mrs. Lacks died on October 4, 1951 at the age of 31.6-7\n\nBiopsy and Culture\n\nHenrietta Lacks’ cervical biopsy was shared with George Gey, MD, director of the Tissue Culture Laboratory in the Department of Surgery at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, who collected specimens from surgical procedures performed at the hospital. Mary Kubicek, an investigator in Gey’s laboratory, cultured Lacks’ cells, which grew robustly compared with other cells. The cells from her cancer were named “HeLa” after the initial letters of her first and last names.8 For many years, credit was not given to her as the originator of the HeLa cell line. The cells were misrepresented as belonging to “Harriet Lane” or “Helen Lane.”9-12 Working with his wife and collaborator, Margaret Gey, Dr. Gey showed the prolific nature of HeLa cells.13 Later characterization revealed that HeLa cells contain human papilloma virus 18 DNA and changes in expression of microRNAs, which are associated with aggressive adenocarcinomas.14-15\n\nProduction and Distribution of HeLa cells\n\nDr. Gey generously shared the cells with scientists interested in cell research, including Dr. William F. Scherer. Notes from Tuskegee researchers, Russell Brown and James H. Henderson, found in the archives at Tuskegee University, indicate that Dr. Scherer, an outstanding researcher of poliomyelitis at the University of Minnesota, provided Tuskegee scientists with an original seed culture of the HeLa cell line in April 1953. The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis chose Tuskegee Institute for the project upon the recommendation of Charles Bynum, a science teacher and first Black foundation executive in the country. Bynum envisioned that locating the factory at Tuskegee would bring much needed funding, jobs, and training opportunities for young Black scientists.16 The cell culture was brought by plane to the Tuskegee Institute (now University) George Washington Carver Research Foundation. With this resource, Brown and Henderson spearheaded the mass production and distribution of HeLa cells, and thus contributed to research on poliomyelitis and vaccines.17\n\nThe Henrietta Lacks Legacy at Tuskegee University\n\nTuskegee University’s Carver Foundation was an early site selected to mass-produce HeLa cells and distribute them to laboratories for polio vaccine testing and other research projects from which we all reap benefits. Today, through the university’s Legacy Museum, Tuskegee continues to honor the legacy of Lacks’ cells and to demonstrate the impact her life has had on medical and research bioethics. Housed in John A. Kenney Hall—adjacent to the Tuskegee University National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care—the Legacy Museum is a part of the consortium of museums managed by the university and the National Parks Service on the grounds of the campus. The museum’s two permanent collections focused on bioethics issues are “The Patient, The Project, The Partnership: The Mass Production and Distribution of HeLa Cells at Tuskegee University” and “The United States Public Health Service Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male, 1932–1972.” During the First Bioethics Conference on Cancer Health Disparities Research held at Tuskegee University in Tuskegee, Alabama from January 18 to 20, 2012, the HeLa Cell Exhibit was presented as “The Patient, The Project, and the Partnership” by the Morehouse School of Medicine/Tuskegee University/University of Alabama Comprehensive Cancer Center Cancer Research Partnership to convey the importance of the groundbreaking, historic role of Tuskegee University in the production and distribution of HeLa cells. It addressed Tuskegee’s role in the HeLa cell narrative.\n\nThousands of local, state, national, and international visitors have viewed the exhibit, and many have left behind useful reflections. Here are some examples: “Humbling experience, grief-stricken, inspired, moved, awed, and a whole lot more—with deep gratitude” (N.C.), Long Beach, CA, 2019; “I was enlightened and educated about a part of history I never knew” (B.D.), Orlando, FL, 2018; “Grateful for the information about Henrietta Lacks. I will certainly treasure the memory of this visit” (L.S.), Trinidad and Tobago, West Indies, 2017; “I think it was wrong that they took her cells. They should have asked her first. I am glad she is helping others all over the world” (J.S.), Tuskegee, AL, 2015; “I was informed about Henrietta Lacks while working at the Bioethics Center, but viewing the exhibit and hearing her family member’s perspectives was truly a moving experience” (W.T.) Tuskegee, AL, 2012.\n\nOn February 15, 2018, Tuskegee University students, faculty, and staff held a dialogue session with two of Henrietta Lacks’ grandchildren, David Lacks Jr. and Jeri Lacks-Whye, after a shared experience of reading Rebecca Skloot’s New York Times bestselling book, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. Skloot brought attention to Lacks’ transcendental importance to science, which led people to become interested in the Lacks family and the legacy of Mrs. Lacks.\n\nIn addition to the above visit, members of the Lacks family have visited Tuskegee for talks and other events. These invited visits put a personal face on the dark history of medical experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and ongoing concerns about informed consent. In their appearances, the family members have shared what it meant to find out, decades after the practice began, how Henrietta’s cells were used in laboratories around the world, and are still bought and sold for profit. Their talks have raised complicated questions about who owns our bodies, whether we control our cells, and who should share in the profits made from selling the cells. Although there is public support for the scientific knowledge gained from using the cell line, informed consent and issues of trust must be paramount.2,4 These issues are especially relevant today in the era of genomic studies and big-data science.5 In today’s environment, with genotyping, genome sequencing, and big-data analytics, the collection, storage, and research use of biospecimens and data raises questions about informed consent, ethical oversight, data sharing, privacy, confidentiality, commercialization, access to research results, and the ability to withdraw from research without penalty.5 The cautionary tale of Mrs. Lacks has challenged traditional notions of privacy and has led to regulatory and policy changes instituted to protect patients’ interests in medical care, particularly when they choose to participate in scientific research.\n\nThe Henrietta Lacks Legacy Continues with The Commonwealth of Virginia’s Henrietta Lacks Commission\n\nThe Commonwealth of Virginia is taking a lead in contributing to the next chapter of Mrs. Lacks’ legacy. As the state where she was born and raised, Virginia is proud to be the first in the country to recognize and emphasize Mrs. Lacks’ legacy in a historic way.\n\nIn July 2018, with the unanimous passing of Senate Bill 171, the Governor and the legislature of Virginia established the Henrietta Lacks Commission (HLC).18 The Commission is charged with creating the Henrietta Lacks Life Science Center (HLLSC), a biomedical cancer research and treatment facility to honor Mrs. Lacks in her hometown of Clover, Virginia. To celebrate both the legacy of Henrietta Lacks and the inception of the Henrietta Lacks Commission, Governor Ralph Northam proclaimed September 23–29, 2018 as Henrietta Lacks Legacy Week.19 During Henrietta Lacks Legacy Week, the Virginia Department of Health’s Office of Health Equity spearheaded a number of events and learning opportunities welcoming community members, legislators, health care professionals, and children to learn about the legacy of Mrs. Henrietta Lacks. The 2018 observation of Henrietta Lacks Legacy Week was the first of its kind in the nation. While it has not yet been determined if this will be an annual event, plans are underway for a 2020 celebration to commemorate what would have been Mrs. Lacks’ 100th birthday.\n\nAs a part of its foundational work, the HLC is exploring, from a community perspective, the impact of personalized medicine, informed consent, and the social and cultural dimensions of clinical research on racial health inequities. The mission of the Henrietta Lacks Commission is to uplift and honor the legacy of Mrs. Henrietta Lacks, while also working to increase the representation of minorities in clinical research to achieve health equity and to promote community engagement and relationship-building between researchers and communities.\n\nMembers of the HLC are participating in community panel discussions and key-informant conversations with diverse academic partners, medical experts, and community organizations to consider and understand the bioethical challenges ahead for the HLLSC. As the HLC explores these complex bioethical topics, the information derived will shape treatment and research efforts, community engagement strategies, and advocacy platforms in establishing the HLLSC. For instance, the events in Mrs. Lacks’ life and others have eroded trust between African Americans and researchers.20-22 The HLC will use its platform, through a community-informed bioethics lens, to tell the story of Mrs. Lacks, while leading development of the HLLSC. In the era of precision medicine, rebuilding trust and maintaining trustworthiness between African American communities and researchers are bioethical issues that require attention.\n\nThe creation of the Henrietta Lacks Commission lays the foundation for the next realization of Mrs. Lacks’ legacy. However, it is not without challenge. While the legislation proposing the creation of the Commission passed Virginia’s legislature unanimously, the legislation was not accompanied by funding. This makes the task before the Henrietta Lacks Commission much more challenging, yet ripe with opportunities for partnership and diverse funding streams. In addition, the Commission has established an Advisory Board to harness the talents and insight of diverse leaders in broad professional arenas, such as academicians, architects, clinical researchers, clinicians, hospital executives, philanthropists, and many more, to reach the goal of creating the Henrietta Lacks Life Center. In the immediate future, the Henrietta Lacks Commission will seek the financial support and invested interest of multi-sector stakeholders towards bringing this next realization of Mrs. Lacks’ legacy to fruition.\n\nThe Impact of Henrietta Lacks’ Story on the Ethics and Policies for Biospecimen Research\n\nAs displayed in the exhibit, the power of the immortal HeLa cells has been, and continues to be put to good use in scientific research laboratories to advance patient and medical care. A search of PubMed with the term “HeLa cell” yielded references to 134,217 publications. Of this number, NIH grants supported 56,270, indicating the extent to which this biospecimen has advanced scientific and medical research. The story of HeLa cells is an exceptional case that has moved from academic circles to broader audiences. This case has generated public discussions and spurred questions about research use of human biospecimens and practice.23-26 For instance, in 2013, a team of researchers posted the whole genome sequence of one strain of HeLa cells online and claimed that they broke no rules.27 This intensified criticisms about privacy and informed consent.28 The researchers removed the sequence from the public domain and met with the NIH director and the Lacks family to formulate an arrangement whereby the NIH-funded researchers would deposit the data in a controlled-access database. Applications to use the data would be reviewed by a committee that includes representation from the Lacks family.29\n\nAlthough a biospecimen obtained from one individual might not be used to produce data that are particularly valuable, privacy is still of concern. When such specimens are obtained from hundreds of people and combined with other kinds of data (such as electronic medical records and associated demographic groupings), useful data can be produced, but privacy concerns are magnified.30 At present, relevant ethical considerations and changes in regulatory and biospecimen research policies are focused on shared interests concerning access to the benefits of research, and promoting a balanced view of protection of autonomy of donors.\n\nNew Bioethical Sensitivities inspired by the HeLa Cell Story\n\nIn an era with challenges of genomic research and big-data sciences, Henrietta Lacks’ story has prompted new ways of performing research on biospecimens at the levels of individual researchers, institutional sponsors, and society. Our systematic search of the literature on studies and narratives on related practices for the last 10 years yielded a list of 10 practices with ethically sound foundations (see below). These practices are consistent with findings from consultation with academic research colleagues, community members, and insights from former research participants. We recognize that this list may not be fully inclusive of all bioethical sensitivities inspired by Mrs. Henrietta Lacks story, but felt it important to include it here in our attempt to honor her legacy.\n\nDiscussions about property rights, ownership, and inventions regarding biospecimens are now commonplace.31\n\nEthics and policy questions about informed consent to guide future directions in light of the new sensitivities are stimulated by the HeLa cell story.32\n\nResearchers are employing better communication with patients about how research should be accomplished with biospecimens and data.33\n\nResearchers are now raising patient awareness that, when clinical specimens are collected during procedures, the default position is that although residual tissue can be included in research, patients may opt out.34-35\n\nResearchers must now provide adequate information to patients and ensure comprehension for them to make an informed, voluntary, and meaningful choice.36-37\n\nResearch institutions must now provide opportunities to object to use of biospecimens and to register that decision.34,37\n\nInstitutions must now provide transparent and accountable oversight processes.37-38\n\nOpportunities for community engagement must now be part of research design.39\n\nPublic input on stewardship of data is now the prevailing custom.40-41\n\nVarious models of informed consent that take into account the best interests of patients are being considered and debated.42-44\n\nAs we have demonstrated, the story of Henrietta Lacks’s (HeLa) cells grown from her cervical tumor and shared globally, and the experiences of her family have brought attention to the need to reflect on how well-intended actions can have unanticipated consequences.4 The cultured HeLa cell line was essential in developing the polio vaccine, uncovering the characteristics of cancer and viruses, and assessing the effects of ionizing radiation on the body. Advances in in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping have also been traced to the use of HeLa cells. Despite her legacy as the matriarch of medicine, Henrietta Lacks has remained unknown to many. The legacy of Mrs. Henrietta Lacks lives on.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nDr. Stephen Sodeke will like to acknowledge the support received from the following grants which allowed this work to be completed: U54MD007585; U54 CA118948; 1 UL1TR001417; OT2OD025284, and 5P30AG031054 respectively from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, the National Cancer Institute, National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, and the National Institute on Aging.
