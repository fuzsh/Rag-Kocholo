        "text": "Born \"Luther Robinson\" in Richmond’s Jackson Ward on May 25, 1878, Bill “Bojangles” Robinson became the world's preeminent tap dancer of his day, best known for his Broadway performances and film roles.\n\nAt around age 5, Robinson began performing in Richmond’s local minstrel shows. According to Robinson himself, he got his famous nickname \"Bojangles\" during his childhood years spent in Richmond. Over the next few years, he performed with traveling troupes, which led to much success in musical, comedy, and dancing performances in vaudeville acts up and down the East Coast.\n\nMr. Robinson returned to Richmond and enlisted in the United States Army, serving in the Spanish-American War and, several years later, in World War I. Upon completion of his military service, he continued to tour with vaudeville shows, ultimately gaining national acclaim after starring in several stage revues on Broadway and starring in more than a dozen films.\n\nBill \"Bojangles\" Robinson died on November 25, 1949, and his body lay in repose at the 369th Infantry Regiment Armory in Harlem, New York. An estimated 32,000 visitors paid their respects before his burial in the Cemetery of the Evergreens in New York.\n\nIn the years following his death, Mr. Robinson received several notable tributes. In 1973, the Astoria Beneficial Club of Richmond installed a bronze statue of Mr. Robinson at the intersection of North Adams Street and West Leigh Street — the site where Robinson paid to have a traffic light installed in an effort to keep Armstrong High School students safe. Mr. Robinson was posthumously inducted into the National Museum of Dance’s Hall of Fame in 1987. And in 1989, a resolution by the United States Congress declared that \"National Tap Dance Day\" is to be recognized each year on May 25, the birthday of Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson.\n\nDesignation Area:\n\nThe portion of Leigh Street from its intersection with North 3rd Street to its intersection with North Belvedere Street has been given the honorary designation of Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson Boulevard.\n\nDownload the Council Ordinance:\n\nLearn more about this Honorary Street Designation by downloading a copy of the legislation. The Council Ordinance below is in PDF format:\n\nOrdinance # 2021-176"
