        "text": "Richmond has been known as the City of Roses and the Lawnmower Capitol of the World. It has had a car named after it, a rose, two movies and a song, and it is the cradle of recorded jazz.\n\nHere are quick takes on those pieces of local history.\n\nCity of Roses\n\nRichmond became the City of Roses because of E. Gurney Hill’s dream of growing roses year-round, which ultimately led to the town’s worldwide recognition as \"The Rose City.\"\n\nHill built greenhouses and organized a company in 1881 to fulfill his dream. He traveled the world, seeking specimens with which to experiment and cross-pollinate. The rose creations grown locally were not just a commodity, they were a local tradition that received worldwide acclaim for more than a hundred years. Hill's Roses made Richmond \"The Rose City.\"\n\nLawnmower capitol\n\nRichmond was the Lawnmower Capitol of the World not because residents cut a lot of grass, but because an Englishman had shown local businessman Elwood McGuire, who had a shop on Main Street, a rotary lawn mower that inspired McGuire to perfect a newer, better mower with open, revolving cutters.\n\nMcGuire founded, along with another company, a major lawnmower manufacturing plant that sold mowers throughout the world. These Richmond-made mowers trimmed American lawns during the first half of the 20th Century and were world-renown.\n\nThe Richmond automobile\n\nRichmond had a car named after it. The town’s love affair with locomotive combustion vehicles began in 1898 when traveling minstrels brought a Locomotive Steamer to town, a very antiquated forerunner of what would become an automobile. The minstrels left, but the contraption remained, bought by a local man. A love affair had begun.\n\nRichmond residents began building cars in 1901, and the local automobile industry flashed and faded, with some early automakers holding on until the Great Depression.\n\nOne such company, the Wayne Works, produced The Richmond Auto from 1901-1916. They also produced The Wayne Auto from 1904-1905, the cars being named for the town and county, respectively. Examples of Richmond-made cars can be found at the Wayne County Historical Museum at 1150 N. A St.\n\nRichmond’s Rose\n\nRichmond had a rose named after it. By any other name, a rose is a rose, but the Richmond Rose was special. It was a large red flower shaded between the so-called cardinal color and the magenta tint. It had a trademark long, straight stem and surpassed all standards of rose perfection at that time, producing five times as many blooms in a single season.\n\nThe bloom almost never came off this rose, so to speak, and the Richmond Rose was worth a fortune before E. Gurney Hill of Hill’s Roses marketed his special creation in November 1904.\n\nThe song of Richmond\n\nRichmond had a song named for it. \"The Richmond Rag\" was written in 1908 by May Aufderheide, whose days here were among the happiest of her life. Her father was a successful pawnbroker in Indianapolis who set up a publishing company to print her compositions, which she wrote from 1908 to 1915.\n\nOne of her almost 20 works was \"The Richmond Rag,\" a lively melody reflecting her fond feelings for the little town by the Whitewater, a song expressly named for the city because she was happiest here.\n\nRichmond-themed movies\n\nRichmond had two films named for the town that were shot here locally: \"Richmond’s Hero\" and \"A Romance of Richmond.\"\n\nThe Evening Item-sponsored \"Richmond’s Hero\" premiered on Jan. 17, 1924, to capacity crowds at The Washington Theatre. The locally created motion picture was the first filmed here and had local residents in key parts.\n\nNationally known radio great Harry Frankl had the lead, playing a henpecked husband having various misadventures in the town environs, including at the depot and a furniture store.\n\nThe Evening Item-sponsored \"A Romance of Richmond\" premiered at The Murray Theatre the week of July 20, 1926. This was a more straightforward drama that included Mayor Lawrence A. Handley as the father of the heroine.\n\nNot much of the plot is known except two villains played by Richmond residents came to sudden and violent ends in the story.\n\nNeither film received national distribution, and no copies exist today.\n\nThe cradle of recorded jazz\n\nTo music historians, Richmond is the \"cradle of recorded jazz\" because of the talent that gushed from its Whitewater River Gorge during the early 1900s. The Gennett music label was a game-changer in American music.\n\nThe 35-acre musical wonderland, as part of the Starr Piano Company, produced some of the greatest music makers in the world, recording early giants such as Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton, Bix Beiderbecke and Hoagy Carmichael. A rendition of Carmichael's legendary \"Stardust\" — one of the most recorded songs of the 20th century — debuted on the label.\n\nThe recording studio’s “hillbilly” harmonics evolved into bluegrass and country. Performers such as William Harris, Charlie Patton, Blind Lemon Jefferson and Willie Baker created a framework for blues that was the precursor to rock and roll.\n\nThe small studio by the railroad tracks also won a landmark David-versus-Goliath lawsuit that changed the competitive nature of the recording industry and allowed an across-the-board freedom that ultimately freed lesser-known musical genres such as country, gospel and rhythm and blues to flourish."
