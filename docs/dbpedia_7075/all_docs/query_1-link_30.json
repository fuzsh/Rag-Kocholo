        "text": "Originally published on Jamii for Black History Month 2018\n\nWhen we’re told about black people at the turn of the nineteenth century, stories of prestige and renown are hidden from us by the usual account of slavery and colonialism. But Georgian Britain did have its black celebrities, and boxer Bill Richmond, the world’s first black sports star, was one of them.\n\nBill Richmond was born a slave in the United States in 1763 but spent the majority of his life in England. When he first arrived here it was to Yorkshire, where British soldier Hugh Percy funded his formal education as a cabinet-making apprentice. Being highly intelligent and intellectual, it would often be commented that Richmond had exceptional wit; though his literacy and gentlemanly mannerisms often meant he was the target of racist abuse from his white counterparts. It would partly be his combination of his thoughtful demeanour with his successful boxing exploits that would win him celebrity status in England.\n\nRichmond moved to London and launched a boxing career, having his first professional fight in 1804 at the age of 36. Despite losing the match to veteran boxer George Maddox, he came back to secure a succession of victories and cement his renown as a talented sportsman. In 1809 Richmond challenged Maddox to a rematch and won; with his winnings, he became landlord of The Horse and Dolphin Pub in Leicester Square."
