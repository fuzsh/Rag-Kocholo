        "text": "Grizzlies forward Zach Randolph has played in 591 NBA games, and he was on the floor for more than 18,000 minutes.\n\nSo he can be forgiven for losing track of exactly how long those games are, right?\n\nWhen interviewed on live television following Memphis’ 109-99 win over Phoenix, Randolph was proud of the way his team played.\n\n“We just finished the whole game,” he said. “We played the whole 42 minutes.”\n\nIn case you’re not familiar with the National Basketball Association, its games last 48 minutes.\n\nYet, 42 wasn’t the most important number of the night for Randolph, as his 20 rebounds and 23 points were much more crucial than his knowledge of the clock.\n\nIf Randolph has a sense of humor about it, he should ask the Memphis scoreboard operator to put 10:30 on the game clock to start the next game.\n\nPhoto of the Day\n\nWhat should be the caption for this photo? Leave your suggestion in the comments section below.\n\nQuote of the day\n\n“We fought like hell for [Wade Phillips]. Things just didn’t go our way.”\n\n–Cowboys defensive lineman Jay Rayliff, to ESPN.com, denying the theory that the Cowboys quit on their coach\n\nComment of the day\n\nThat is some very interesting logic, Mr. Danny … if that’s your real name."
