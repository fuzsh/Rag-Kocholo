        "text": "One of the last remaining players from a bygone era of the NBA is calling it a career, as Marion native and former Michigan State star Zach Randolph announced his retirement Friday.\n\n\"I gave this game my all, and it gave everything back and more,\" Randolph said via Twitter. \"Basketball will always be a part of me. From Marion, to East Lansing, to Portland, NY, LA, Memphis, Sacramento and everyone in between â€” thank you all for an incredible journey.\"\n\nRandolph is hanging up his sneakers after 17 NBA seasons between five different teams. Randolph last played in the NBA during the 2017 season with Sacramento.\n\nThe 6-9 lefty was drafted 19th overall by the Portland Trail Blazers in 2001 after one season at Michigan State.\n\nFor his career, Randolph averaged 16.6 points and 9.1 rebounds per game. \"Z-Bo\" rose to prominence as a member of a Portland Trailblazers squad featuring Rasheed Wallace, Bonzi Wells and Damon Stoudamire known as the \"Jail Blazers\" because of their frequent run ins with the law.\n\nHe made the All-Star game twice as a member of the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nIn addition to his two All-Star nods, Randolph won Most Improved Player for the 2003-04 season, and was All-NBA third team for the 2010-11 season.\n\nIn high school, Randolph led the Giants to state championship victory as a senior. The burly big man earned McDonald's All-American honors, but he finished second for Indiana Mr. Basketball behind former Indiana Hoosiers star Jared Jeffries.\n\nFollow IndyStar sports producer Akeem Glaspie on Twitter at @THEAkeemGlaspie."
