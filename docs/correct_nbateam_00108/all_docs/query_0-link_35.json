        "text": "It's unfortunate that Knicks fans won't get to see guard Cuttino Mobley play in Mike D'Antoni's offense. Not that he necessarily would have made a huge difference, but he did seem to be a good fit as a veteran who excels in transition. \"Cat\" Mobley was mostly a fan favorite throughout his NBA career, and this offense fit his fading skill set well enough that he may have seen a resurgence to his glory days in Houston.\n\nBut upon news of his retirement (due to a heart condition, one similar to the impairment that took the life of college stud Hank Gathers and Celtics star Reggie Lewis), that scenario is clearly not to be. It's also clear that his potential contribution was valued about as much as Stephon Marbury's. Which is to say, the Knicks could could take it or leave it. So long as \"it\" was definitely gone before 2010.\n\nMike D'Antoni insisted after the flurry of deals that left the Knicks worse for 2008 -- but sitting pretty for the impending Summer of Dreamy Basketball Players -- that the moves were done for personnel reasons as much as cap space. No one believed him, but at least he had plausible deniability. That's gone now.\n\nNormally a team acquiring a player with a health defect that forced his immediate retirement would look to void the trade, but General Manager Donnie Walsh is making no such plans. In other words, he doesn't care, he would have traded Zach Randolph for your surprisingly spry grandmother and two bloggers from NBC New York just to be rid of the poisonous contract.\n\nIt's really too bad he didn't make that deal instead; word around the league is that Grandma has serious hops."
