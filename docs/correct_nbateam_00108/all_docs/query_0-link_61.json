Randolph has helped transform the Memphis Grizzlies into a perennial playoff team. In his first playoff run with the team, the eighth-seeded Grizzlies beat the top-ranked Spurs in the first round, something that had only been accomplished once before in NBA history. Prior to coming to Memphis, Randolph spent two seasons split between the New York Knicks and Los Angeles Clippers. He was initially the 19th overall pick of the Portland Trail Blazers in the 2001 NBA Draft and spent the first six seasons of his career with the franchise. Randolph built his way into a successful pro, winning the NBA’s Most Improved Player Award in his third season with averages of 20.1 points and 10.5 rebounds per game. In his one collegiate season at Michigan State, the Spartans reached the Final Four. Randolph won two Indiana state titles at Marion High School and was MVP of the McDonald’s All-American game as a senior. His Zach Randolph Community Assistance Fund and annual Thanksgiving Turkey and Ham drive benefit the needy in the Memphis area.\n\nBook Zach Randolph for your Next Event\n\nDisclaimer: AthleteSpeakers assists companies seeking to hire talent like Zach Randolph for speaking engagements, virtual meetings, appearances, product endorsements, and business sanctions.
