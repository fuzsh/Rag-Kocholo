        "text": "Scouting Report\n\n\"Z-Bo\" was a top scorer and rebounder in the NBA. Blessed with a hefty frame, long arms, good coordination and nice hands in the post, he could bully his way for easy buckets and boards inside the paint area. Extremely physical, he also had a nice shooting touch and was a very good passer for a big man. Became a clutch player over time. While quick, he was not very fast or fluid so he did not excel in an up-tempo system (an issue that increased with advanced age). Was not much of a shot blocker. Sometimes he took unneeded fouls under the hoop. Was somewhat injury-prone. Earlier in his career, he was suspended several times for various incidents."
