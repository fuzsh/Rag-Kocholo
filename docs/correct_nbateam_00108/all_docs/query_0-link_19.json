        "text": "OAKLAND, Calif. — In a move that would make perfect sense for all parties, the Knicks and Kings have discussed an Enes Kanter-Zach Randolph swap, according to ESPN.\n\nHowever, according to an NBA source, the Knicks will need an extra futures asset — perhaps a future second-round pick — to pull the trigger. The report said a third team may be needed, and that a deal is not close to happening.\n\nThe trade of expiring contracts would give Sacramento a piece for a playoff push, relieve the Knicks of a potential headache in a disgruntled Kanter, and they would not be taking on any salary against their 2019-20 salary cap.\n\nAccording to sources, the Knicks want to move Kanter as long as they don’t take back any contracts that spill into this offseason’s cap space. Randolph fits the bill and plays power forward — where the Knicks are less fortified. The Knicks would also consider waiving Randolph and signing a prospect or obtaining another young player via trade.\n\nBoth Kanter and Randolph are on expiring contracts. Coincidentally, Knicks GM Scott Perry signed Randolph to the Kings deal in the summer of 2017 before leaving for the Knicks. Randolph, who would be making his second stint for the Knicks (2007-09), played for coach David Fizdale in Memphis. He has been completely out of the mix in Sacramento, not having played a game all season.\n\nKanter was demoted for second-year man Luke Kornet at the start of their concluded six-game trip. When rookie center Mitchell Robinson comes back from a groin strain in about a week, Fizdale said, he would try to juggle three centers, but that is only a challenge.\n\nKanter has been vocal about his displeasure about not starting if the Knicks do not win.\n\nKanter is playing for a new contract, and his statistics are bound to be affected, especially when Robinson returns and Fizdale still wants to see more of 3-point-shooting Kornet.\n\nThe Knicks had their eyebrows raised over Kanter’s inflammatory rant in Los Angeles on Friday about his decision not to go to London amid his political war with Turkish leaders. It came after the Knicks broke an eight-game losing streak, against the Lakers. A Knicks official said Kanter wasn’t making the London trip because of visa issues — which Kanter later denied.\n\nKnicks owner James Dolan is close to Kanter, and Kanter is one of his son’s favorite players, according to a source. Dolan supported Kanter’s decision not to play in London.\n\nOne person familiar with the Knicks situation told The Post they want to do good by Kanter, who met with Perry on the trip after which he said he did not request a trade. However, it’s clear Kanter wants to win – and that’s not happening this season in the Big Apple."
