        "text": "The diamond grill that lines the entire mouth of Memphis rapper Moneybagg Yo shined bright for the cameras outside the gym full of screaming students at Airways Achievement Academy. Zach Randolph knew not to pass up a chance to promote his client.\n\nIn that moment, the man affectionately known as Z-Bo instinctively morphed from the basketball player he’s been for more than 15 years into the music mogul he might become.\n\n“Show them that $50,000 smile,” Randolph said to laughter.\n\nRandolph was in South Memphis Friday afternoon to announce a $10,000 scholarship donation to Shelby County Alternative Schools on behalf of his Memphis-based music label, N-Less Entertainment.\n\nYou read that right: Randolph owns a record label along with business partner Marcus Howell these days, and their biggest act is a rising local star on the Memphis rap scene. In fact, Z-Bo will be at Beale Street Music Festival Sunday when Moneybagg Yo performs a set.\n\nRandolph still isn’t done with basketball and he still hasn’t closed the door on playing for the Grizzlies again. More on that later.\n\nBut let’s first talk about this foray into the music industry because the collaboration with Moneybagg Yo might hold a more promising future than his playing career at this point.\n\nIt began in the fall of 2015 when Moneybagg Yo put out a mixtape called “Federal” and local promoter DJ Larry Live took the project to Randolph and his partners.\n\n“It was just me. I was independent. It was just me doing my own thing in the streets,” Moneybagg Yo said Friday, “and (DJ Larry Live) said, ‘I really believe in this kid. I think he can go to the top.’”\n\nBy July 2016, N-Less Entertainment was part of Moneybagg Yo’s extensive collection of mixtapes and street albums as he rose up the charts.\n\nMoneybagg Yo’s past five releases have reached at least No. 21 on the Billboard top 200, including “Federal 3X” in 2017, which out-sold Bruno Mars and Ed Sheeran the week it came out.\n\n“He’s the hottest in the city and we were starting this company,” explained Randolph, whose label also features local artists DeeMula, MudBruddaBo and Fredo. “I told him, ‘Let’s do it. Let’s do it for the city.’ In this generation, this culture, music and sports combine, so it was a great thing.”\n\nThe basketball part of Randolph’s life is a little more complicated right now. He's a free agent, having just finished a two-year, $24 million contract with the Sacramento Kings. But he didn’t appear in a single game this past season even though he was healthy, instead relegated to being a mentor.\n\nRandolph did this without complaint.\n\nSeeing him Friday, though, was a reminder of how rare it is that an NBA career ends on a player’s terms. Because Randolph isn’t ready to call it quits. He’s still working out here in Memphis, where he lives with his family during the offseason, hopeful another team will give him a chance.\n\n“I want to be a Hall of Famer. Just go down as one of the best to ever do it,” Randolph said. “I want to play a couple more years.”\n\nHow realistic that wish might be for a 37-year-old forward is for NBA executives to decide. You hope music, or whatever else Randolph does after basketball, can eventually fill that void in his life.\n\nBut it makes you wonder if it was ever possible to author a happy ending to the Core Four era.\n\nLike Randolph, Tony Allen didn’t play a single minute in the NBA this year even though he hasn’t officially retired. Then there’s Mike Conley, who had a career year for the Grizzlies but made it clear this offseason he would welcome a trade elsewhere to a contender.\n\nMarc Gasol is probably the only member of the Grizzlies’ greatest foursome in an envious situation, playing a major role for the Toronto Raptors in the NBA Playoffs.\n\n\"Whatever the Grizzlies gonna do, whatever Mike does, the city is going to support him,” Randolph said. “Just like Marc, like Tony. This is grindfathers and this is going to be our city forever.”\n\nIt’s what made Randolph’s appearance Friday just as meaningful as all those MLGW bills he paid over the years. He hasn’t moved on from Memphis, even if the Grizzlies may have moved on from him.\n\nLast October, he and Moneybagg Yo joined forces to visit top Memphis basketball recruit James Wiseman at his home. Tigers coach Penny Hardaway said he wasn't involved — “James is a big fan of Moneybagg’s and I’m a big fan of his and he’s a fan of mine,\" Randolph said Friday — but Wiseman signed with Memphis a few weeks later.\n\nIf it wasn't clear already, there’s an eternal bond between Randolph and this community, whether it’s through music or basketball.\n\nSo when asked about a potential return to the Grizzlies for one last hurrah, Randolph’s answer came with a smile that shined as brightly as the rapper who now works for him.\n\n“You never know,” he said. “The Grizzlies will forever be in my heart. I’ll forever be a Grizzly.”\n\nYou can reach Commercial Appeal columnist Mark Giannotto via email at mgiannotto@gannett.com and follow him on Twitter: @mgiannotto\n\nMore Memphis Grizzlies coverage from The CA\n\nColumn: Memphis Grizzlies must do what's best for them, not Mike Conley, this offseason\n\nNew face: Zach Kleiman is the 30-year-old prodigy who will determine the Memphis Grizzlies future"
