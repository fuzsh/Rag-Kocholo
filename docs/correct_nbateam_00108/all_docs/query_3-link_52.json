        "text": "LOS ANGELES – Veteran NBA forward Zach Randolph was arrested on a marijuana charge after several police cars were vandalized when a large gathering became unruly at a Los Angeles housing project, authorities said Thursday.\n\nRandolph, 36, was taken into custody late Wednesday on suspicion of possessing marijuana with intent to sell, according to Los Angeles Police Department Officer Liliana Preciado.\n\n“The charges are false and misleading,” Randolph’s agent and attorney Raymond Brothers told The Associated Press on Thursday. “We’re looking at all options to resolve this matter.”\n\nPolice on patrol observed a crowd drinking, smoking pot, blasting music and blocking streets at the Nickerson Gardens project in Watts, Preciado said.\n\nOfficers called for backup when the crowd grew and people began throwing bottles and rocks.\n\nFive police cars and one sheriff’s vehicle ended up with smashed windows and slashed tires. No officers were hurt.\n\nOfficers also arrested Stanley Walton, 43, on suspicion of carrying a gun as an ex-convict, Preciado said. She didn’t know if Walton has an attorney.\n\nPolice recovered two guns, impounded two vehicles and seized narcotics, Preciado said.\n\nRandolph, a 16-year league veteran, spent eight seasons with the Memphis Grizzlies before signing with the Sacramento Kings in July. The Kings issued a statement Thursday saying the team was aware of the situation and would have no further comment at this time.\n\nThe two-time NBA All-Star played for Michigan State University before being drafted in 2001 by the Portland Trail Blazers. Randolph also played for the New York Knicks and Los Angeles Clippers."
