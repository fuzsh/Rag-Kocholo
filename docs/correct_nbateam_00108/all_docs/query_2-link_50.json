        "text": "Grizzlies forward Zach Randolph has missed four straight games because of a sore and swollen right knee. The team’s leading rebounder said there is no timetable for when he will return. “I don’t have a target date yet. I’m just trying to get it right and get the swelling out,” Randolph said. “I want to get comfortable playing on it. We’ll see how it is in a couple of days. I’ll probably get it checked out again.”\n\nGasol and Griz brass can’t start talking about a new deal until mid-December when Gasol is eligible for a contract extension. If Gasol signed an extension then it would be limited to three years. Becoming a free agent next summer makes Gasol able to sign a five-year deal with the Griz or a four-year pact with another team. Either way, he figures to command the maximum salary for a player with his years of service. And Gasol would improve his total financial package by at least $50 million by waiting. “It’s not going to be an issue with his situation,” forward Zach Randolph told the Associated Press. “It shouldn’t be. Believe me if Memphis don’t want him, there’s a lot of other teams that want him, so I don’t think he’s going anywhere.”"
