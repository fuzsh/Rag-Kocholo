        "text": "You remember Gilbert Arenas and Zach Randolph, don’t you? They were stars of the NBA from the mid-2000s and through the early 2010s.\n\nArenas was a dynamic guard for the Washington Wizards who could score in bunches – once dropping 60 points in a single game – who made three All-NBA teams and was made infamous by one wild locker room incident (he now sometimes says ridiculous things about the WNBA).\n\nRandolph was a bit undersized, yet an incredibly imposing throwback power forward who was twice an All-Star and who was the heart and soul of those grit-and-grind Memphis Grizzlies teams. Arenas and Randolph briefly played together in the 2011-12 season for Memphis.\n\nWell, they’re both in their 40s now and several years into retirement. But we’re about to see their surnames on the back of jerseys in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThat’s because the daughters of both former standout NBA players will suit up for Jeff Walz’s Louisville Cardinals’ women’s basketball team next year as the cornerstones of an impressive recruiting class.\n\nMackenly Randolph (a 6-foot forward) and Izela Arenas (a 5-foot-9 guard) have been high school teammates at Sierra Canyon in California. And now, they’re going to join forces at Louisville in the Atlantic Coast Conference.\n\nFeel old yet?\n\nBoth players are tabbed as top 100 recruits in the 2024 class, and they’ll be paired with a third top-ranked prospect in Tajianna Avant-Roberts of IMG Academy. All three will play in the Jordan Brand Classic on April 21 in Brooklyn, N.Y.\n\nHere’s what Walz – who has guided Louisville to four Final Fours since 2009 – said about them…\n\nOn Randolph:\n\n“Mac displays a relentless pursuit of excellence. She is a tremendous leader on and off the court and brings with her a championship mindset. Her energy is contagious, and her versatility will be showcased in our system. If you need a rebound, she will pursue it. Need a bucket, she’ll manufacture points. She will win the hearts of the Cardinal faithful with her hustle, toughness and determination. She is a bonafide winner.”\n\nAnd on Arenas:\n\n“Izela is a bonafide scorer on an elite high school team. She hunts shots and is creative off the bounce. She also is an unselfish teammate and a great facilitator on the break. Izela is a consummate gym rat and has a love affair with the game. She is a proficient scorer from the 3-point line and can also attack off the bounce. Her toughness and grit are unmatched, and she will no doubt light up a room with her presence.”\n\nRandolph chose Louisville over offers from Notre Dame and her father’s alma mater Michigan State, among others. Arenas also had offers from her dad’s school, Arizona, as well as Oregon and Iowa State."
