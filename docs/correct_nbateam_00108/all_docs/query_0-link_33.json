During last night's game, Zach Randolph begins to run his mouth on the bench while Quentin Richardson stands up to say something back. Then little Nate Robinson gets in on the action. As Zach throws a cup of water at him, Robinson retaliates by throwing his towel. Not a big deal in terms of action against each other, but it's a pretty clear message that this team is still falling apart and there is absolutely no leadership. What the hell was Isaiah doing the whole time?"
