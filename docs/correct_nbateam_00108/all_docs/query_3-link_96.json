Randolph, who retired from the NBA upon the conclusion of the 2018-19 season, will serve as a team captain for team Trilogy, according to a press release from the league.\n\nYahoo’s Chris Haynes first reported the news.\n\nRandolph averaged 10.8 points and 6.7 rebounds per game over 33 games during his one season at Michigan State.\n\nFrom there he went on to have a long and successful career in the NBA. Randolph averaged 16.6 points and 9.1 rebounds and made two All-Star teams during his 17-year career. He is most known for his presence during the Memphis Grizzlies “Grit ‘n Grind” era in the mid 2010s, but also played for the Portland Trail Blazers, New York Knicks, Sacremento Kings and Los Angeles Clippers in his career.\n\nThe Big 3 season will kick off on June 20 in Memphis, Tennessee."
