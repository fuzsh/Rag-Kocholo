        "text": "In 1973 the New York Knicks were crowned champions of the basketball world. There was no three-point line. The NBA/ABA merger was three years away. The arrival of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird double that.\n\nIn the 47 years that’s spanned since their last title, the Knicks have fluctuated between being a Finals contender and a punchline, the latter of which the dominating identifier over the past two decades.\n\nWeird trades. Draft busts. A sexual assault scandal. Incompetent ownership. Locker room drama. High-profile executive hires. Stadium ejections. You name it, the Knicks have experience with it.\n\nWith Leon Rose now in charge as president of the Knicks, his first order of business isn’t to acquire assets or lay out a five-year championship plan. It’s to distance the New York Knicks brand from that of the past and draw a line in the sand.\n\nThat’s a tremendous task, and an undertaking that will take years to implement. It is not a short-term plan, and requires more than an updated logo and alternative colors (although everything should be in the play at this point).\n\nThis needs to be a mission that ends in swaying people’s opinion on what the franchise is, and what it values. The only way to do that is to actually implement change and not try to quick-fix their way out of the hole they’ve dug themselves over the past 20 years.\n\nQuick-fixes have often been New York’s go-to. Former GM Isiah Thomas would make what felt like weekly trades to shake things up, in trying to make a splash.\n\nHere’s Stephon Marbury’s reaction to the Knicks acquiring Zach Randolph from the Portland Trail Blazers in 2007.\n\nAs it turned out, nobody turned out to be \"scared now\". Randolph played a grand total of 80 games for the franchise before getting shipped off to the Clippers.\n\nYears later, the Knicks decided to invest $60 million in Phil Jackson to turn the team around as an executive. It did not work out well.\n\nIn a league where chemistry, symmetry, cohesiveness and careful planning are the key ingredients to a successful team, the Knicks would often throw money at problems with the idea that everything would be fixed, sooner than later.\n\nIf Rose aspires to be successful with one of the league’s most controversial franchises, he needs to do this differently. Unlike his predecessors, and owner James Dolan, Rose is going to need a heap of patience and have the ability to play the long-game.\n\nGetting the Knicks back to a level of respectability opens doors. Look no further than how the Los Angeles Clippers turned themselves around. In the span of six years, they went from being one of the most dysfunctional franchises in all of sports, to being a highly respected NBA championship favorite who over the course of one summer acquired two primetime superstars.\n\nWhen disgraced owner Donald Sterling was replaced by Steve Ballmer, the latter decided to lay the groundwork to change the narrative. Lazy behavior and racial undertones got replaced with professionalism and an organizational-wide focus on work ethic and environment. Under Sterling, few Clippers employees wanted to be there. Under the current regime, it’s one of the most attractive jobs in the industry.\n\nOne might think it starts with putting in the work. That’s certainly a tremendously large part of it. But more than that, it starts with the decision of cutting ties to the past and starting fresh. No longer is it remotely acceptable to be the laughingstock. No longer can you survive in important jobs without taking accountability. No longer can you turn a blind eye to incompetence, just to save a co-worker’s job.\n\nThere needs to be an overhaul in mindset.\n\nFor the Knicks, and Rose especially, the challenge is navigating this new reality with Dolan still at the helm. A new culture needs to established with Dolan, not without him. Is that possible? That’s something we’ll learn over the next few years.\n\nFor now, Rose’s job is laying the necessary groundwork for a culture change. That means identifying the people, both internally and externally, who he believes can move the franchise forward, as well as saying goodbye to the people who can’t.\n\nThe goal isn’t to just impress agents so they’ll sway their clients in New York’s direction. The goal is to implement permanent change, so the Knicks brand will function as an asset for them moving forward.\n\nThen, and only then, can the Knicks return to relevance.\n\nAnd let’s be honest. Even if we’ve had our laughs at their expense, we’ve reached the point of punching down. Making fun of the Knicks doesn’t have the same feel anymore. It’s too easy. Too broad. Too conform.\n\nFor everyone’s sake, the laughs need to die. That’s your cue, Mr. Rose."
