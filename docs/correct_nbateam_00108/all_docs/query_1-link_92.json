        "text": "Earlier today, the Memphis Grizzlies confirmed plans to retire the jerseys of former franchise greats Zach Randolph and Tony Allen during the 2021-22 season. Randolph, whose decorated career split largely between the Grizzlies and Portland Trail Blazers, will have just jersey recognized on Dec. 11 when Memphis takes on the Houston Rockets.\n\nRandolph recorded a career in Memphis in which he was a two-time NBA All-Star and averaged 16.8 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 2.0 assists on 47.6 percent shooting over eight seasons.\n\nThrough his reliable, bruising, back-to-basket, pick-and-pop and face-up game, the Grizzlies made three trips out of the Western Conference First Round. In 2013 they made their franchise’s only appearance in the Western Conference Finals. Randolph also became the first player in their franchise’s history to make an All-NBA team via a Third Team nod in 2010-11, per Evan Barnes of Memphis Commercial Appeal.\n\nBefore finding a second home in Memphis, Randolph made his mark as a standout for the Trail Blazers, helping headline a frontcourt that included the likes of Rasheed Wallace, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Arvydas Sabonis.\n\nIndividually, Randolph’s most fruitful years came as the fulcrum of Portland’s low post offense. He averaged 20.2 points and 9.6 rebounds on 46.1 percent shooting over his final four years with the Blazers. He was recognized with the NBA’s Most Improved Player of the Year award with Portland in 2003-04, spending six seasons there in total."
