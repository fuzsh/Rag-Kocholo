        "text": "Randolph announced his retirement from the NBA on Friday, Clevis Murray of The Athletic reports.\n\nThe 38-year-old was waived by the Mavericks in February and has been unable to latch on with a new team over the last 10 months. Randolph averaged 16.6 points, 9.1 rebounds and 1.8 assists over his 18-year career with the Trail Blazers, Knicks, Clippers, Grizzlies and Kings.\n\nThe Mavericks are expected to waive Randolph, whom they acquired Wednesday in a trade with the Kings, Mark Stein of The New York Times reports.\n\nShortly after the Mavericks' 99-93 win over the Hornets, it was revealed that Barnes had been shipped away to the Kings in exchange for Randolph and second-year forward Justin Jackson. Dallas likely only agreed to take back Randolph and the remaining money on his two-year, $24 million expiring contract for salary-matching purposes, as the veteran doesn't otherwise have a future on a rebuilding team. The playoff-contending Kings didn't have a need for Randolph either -- the 37-year-old has yet to play a single minute this season -- but that probably has more to do with their glut of frontcourt options. According to Stein, Randolph is expected to have a \"sizable buyout market\" once he's free to sign with other teams at a more cost-effective deal. Though Randolph is just one season removed from averaging 14.5 points, 6.7 rebounds and 2.2 assists in 25.6 minutes per game, he seems unlikely to receive close to that level of playing time no matter where he might wind up.\n\nRandolph has been waived by the Mavericks, Shams Charania of The Athletic reports.\n\nAs expected, the 18-year veteran won't play a game for the Mavericks and will instead hit the free agent market. According to Mark Stein, there could be a \"sizable\" amount of teams looking to add Randolph. He's just one season removed from averaging 14.5 points, 6.7 rebounds and 2.2 assists across 25.6 minutes.\n\nThe Kings agreed Wednesday to trade Randolph and Justin Jackson to the Mavericks in exchange for Harrison Barnes, Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN reports.\n\nRandolph has been out of the rotation all season in Sacramento, not even logging a single minute of run. On a Dallas squad that doesn't fancy itself as playoff contenders, it's tough to see a path to playing time for the 37-year-old. The Mavericks most likely agreed to take Randolph back in the deal for salary-matching purposes, as Jackson, a 2017 first-round pick, looks to be the main target here. Don't be surprised if the Mavericks look to reroute Randolph elsewhere prior to Thursday's trade deadline or buy out the money left on his two-year, $24 million contract shortly thereafter.\n\nThe Kings have engaged with the Knicks on trade talks surrounding Randolph and New York center Enes Kanter, league sources tell Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN.\n\nWojnarowski notes that no trade is imminent, but both sides are eager to shed the expiring contracts attached to the big men. While Kanter has been a key scorer and rebounder for New York's second unit this season, Randolph has been a healthy inactive throughout the 2018-19 campaign. As a 37-year-old on a team ripe with plenty of younger frontcourt prospects, Randolph doesn't project to have a role with Sacramento at any point moving forward and likely wouldn't see meaningful run with the Knicks or any other team either.\n\nRandolph is not expected to see playing time in the foreseeable future, James Ham of NBC Sports Bay Area reports.\n\nAfter averaging 14.5 points and 6.7 rebounds for the Kings last year, Randolph has taken a back seat as the Kings attempt to develop a slew of young bigs. Randolph is a steady contributor of points and rebounds when given the opportunity but would need significant injuries to occur in order to become a reasonable fantasy asset this season.\n\nRandolph will be held out of Friday's game against the Pelicans due to a coach's decision, Jim Eichenhofer of the Pelicans' official site reports.\n\nRandolph will hit the bench with the Kings looking to give minutes to the younger players on the squad. After averaging 25.6 minutes per game a season ago, he won't take the floor for the first two contests of the year.\n\nAt Kings media day, coach Dave Joerger implied that both Randolph and Kosta Koufos could see reduced roles this season, Jason Jones of The Athletic reports. \"I'm not saying those guys won't play, but our bigger priority is to play as many young guys as possible,\" Joerger said.\n\nWhile Joerger's words may not be in the best interest of Randolph, himself, it's nonetheless refreshing to hear that the Kings will lean into their youth-heavy roster, which features second-year players Justin Jackson, Harry Giles, De'Aaron Fox and Bogdan Bogdanovic, as well as No. 2 overall pick Marvin Bagley, among others. Last season, Sacramento's rotation was muddied with a mixture of young players and veterans, and it was often difficult to discern which players Joerger would favor on a night to night basis. The rotation could still take some time to settle, but at the very least it appears as though Joerger is ready to embrace a rebuild, rather than a misguided attempt to compete for the eighth seed, even in a year in which the Kings don't control their own first-round pick. In 2017-18, Randolph's first in Sacramento, the veteran appeared in 59 games and averaged 14.5 points, 6.7 rebounds and 2.2 assists per game.\n\nRandolph could see his workload reduced as a result of the Kings selecting Marvin Bagley with the number two overall pick in the 2018 NBA Draft.\n\nRandolph signed a two-year, $24 million contract with the Kings last summer and played a significant role on the team in 2017-18. He appeared in 59 games, averaging 14.5 points, 6.7 rebounds and 2.2 assists in 25.6 minutes. However, with Sacramento bringing in power forward/center Bagley, Randolph's role could fall by the wayside as the team looks to continue the rebuild.\n\nRandolph averaged 14.5 points, 6.7 rebounds and 2.2 assists across 59 games played with Sacramento in 2017-18.\n\nDespite playing in the lowest amount of games since the 2011-12 season, the 35-year-old showed no signs of slowing down as he increased his scoring, assists and blocks per game from last year. In addition, Randolph also improved his field-goal and free-throw percentages to 47.3 and 78.5 percent respectively. However, the former Michigan State star will look for a new home next year when free agency opens this summer.\n\nRandolph (coach's decision) did not see the floor during Friday's 94-93 win over the Grizzlies.\n\nRandolph went from projected starter to a DNP-CD, marking his eighth straight absence. The 17-year veteran was apparently healthy enough to play Friday after recently battling an illness, so it remains to be seen if he'll take the floor in the Kings' penultimate game of the season against the Spurs on Monday night.\n\nRandolph, as the result of a late lineup switch, will not start during Friday's contest against the Grizzlies, Jason Jones of The Sacramento Bee reports.\n\nDue to an illness and personal reasons, Randolph has missed the team's past seven games. Originally, it appeared he would start and play Friday. However, due to a late lineup switch, Randolph won't be in the starting five. As a result, there's no guarantee he'll take the floor."
