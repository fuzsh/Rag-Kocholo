        "text": "Zach Randolph calls himself a pioneer. I'd say he's more desktop computer in the age of the iPad.\n\nWhen the real work of basketball needs getting done, the former Michigan State star remains about as sturdy as ever. But even Randolph knows he's become something of a relic in this era of big-man three-point shooters.\n\n\"The last of a dying breed,\" Detroit Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy called him.\n\nRandolph made his annual trip to the Palace on Wednesday night, a 34-year-old power forward whose back-to-the-basket game is a throwback. In his prime, his assortment of post moves and fadeaways flummoxed the best of his generation. He was a 6-9 forward who thrived below the rim.\n\nPistons led Grizzlies escape with 93-92 victory\n\nHis team, the Memphis Grizzlies, paired that on-the-block moxie with center Marc Gasol, an old-school tandem that pushed deep into the Western Conference playoffs a few times. These days, Randolph is a complimentary part on a team unlikely to get past Golden State or San Antonio or even the Los Angeles Clippers. Yet he's enjoying himself as much as ever. That's how it goes when you're 34 and still playing professional basketball for a living.\n\nRandolph played only one season at MSU, and he remains Tom Izzo's only one-and-done NBA player. He's also the most accomplished pro Izzo ever coached.\n\nPerhaps one day Draymond Green will surpass Randolph. He's already ahead in number of titles. The Warriors, after all, are the defending champs. But even Randolph can't believe he's the best MSU's produced under Izzo.\n\n\"Ain't that something?\" he said Wednesday night, an hour before tip-off, chatting with me as he joked with teammates, while asking locker-room attendants to track down a little pre-game snack.\n\nAlthough the Indiana native spent less than 12 months in East Lansing, he considers MSU his second home.\n\n\"I have the package, so I watch them all the time,\" he said, grinning. \"I mean, they're the No. 1 team in the country.\"\n\nRandolph, not surprisingly, is an admirer of Denzel Valentine, the team's multi-talented leader, and while he loves the toughness ethos Izzo has always preached, he digs the skill and spacing the current Spartans exhibit maybe more.\n\nIn that way, Randolph was ahead of his time. Never a rim-rattler, he relied on misdirection, footwork, balance and soft, soft hands. Sure, he was strong, but what made him a 20-point, 10-rebound force for so many years was his basketball acumen and flat-out skill.\n\nNo. 1 MSU rolls over Maryland-Eastern Shore, 78-35\n\nRandolph may represent the past in the positioning he takes on the floor, but the tricks he uses to put the ball in the basket are straight from the present.\n\n\"Athleticism only lasts so long,\" he said. \"It's about fundamentals. There are a lot of players that can run and jump but not a lot of players that can shoot and handle it. Shooting off the backboard? Making a reverse lay-up? Those are skills.\"\n\nRandolph has them. Or had them ... enough to survive 14 years in the league. This is his 15th with below-average hops and lateral quickness relative to the rest of the NBA.\n\nHow much longer he plays, he isn't sure. He just knows he still loves being in the league, still loves trying to put the ball in the hoop. Still loves the NBA life.\n\nIt's a long way from his impoverished childhood in Marion, Ind. That life, he said, is why he left MSU after a year and never looked back.\n\nEven though he wants to go back ... for a game, something he hasn't been able to do because of his schedule.\n\n\"I talk to coach (Izzo) every now and again, but I've only seen them in person once since I left,\" he said.\n\nHe's looking forward to returning to East Lansing when he finishes playing, sitting in the stands, watching a program he helped build, honing in on the guys with the skill."
