        "text": "Zach Randolph\n\nClass of 2000 School Marion HS, IN Height and Weight 6'8 270lbs Reach, Wingspan 8'08, 6'11 Position Center/Power Forward 98-99 Ratings #6 (SN)(FS), #41 (ATH), #23 (HS) #1 (BG) 97-98 Ratings #21 (HS), #29 (FC) Academically Eligible Needs GPA and SAT boosts Status Active AAU Team No Excuses (1998)\n\nPlayer Summary · Player News · Game Stats · Season Stats · Honors · IHSAA Schedule\n\nPlayer Summary\n\nZach Randolph has been nicknamed \"Baby Shaq\" by fans. The shaven head and impressive body make it an accurate nickname, but has a handful of inches to grow to reach the height of Shaq. Randolph is a handful in the paint. His wide body makes it very difficult for players to get around, and his defense is improving. It doesn't take much for him to win position to gather in rebounds into double-figure amounts. Offensively he can move around well, and knows that his job revolves around being in the paint. Depending on how he grows will determine if he develops into a college center candidate. Word is that he could be at 6'10 and 300lbs by the time he touches the collegiate hardwood. Right now (as a sophomore) he is a big body with a host of interior skills. Has shown a shot out to 14 feet. Areas to work on would be extending his range when playing at the forward spot, and staying in the game. He runs well, but isn't close to the kind of speed a Cameron Stephens has in the open court. A high major Division I prospect that most schools either are, or will be chasing, and will make a great post player on the next level. Randolph helped lead Marion HS to the 4A championship game against Pike HS as a sophomore, scoring 18 points and 8 rebounds in 24 minutes in the game. He averaged 17 points, 12 rebounds and 3 blocks as a sophomore. His early list includes Purdue, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan State, Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan, with more to be added soon. Purdue is in a very good position with Zach, as he thinks highly of the staff and the program and has called Purdue \"the big one\" on his list. Randolph has already made unofficials to the Purdue campus, but remains open. He likes the Big Ten and the ACC. Randolph had a career high 30 points on 12/5/98 against Anderson.\n\nCurrent Player News\n\n7-18-99...Purdue is still among Zach's top five, according to this CNNSI article. The author also adds Zach hasn't ruled out early entry into the NBA. 7-16-99...The rumors have been around forever concerning the friendship between Zach and Marcus Taylor. This article from the Lansing State Journal talks about that relationship, plus takes a look at Zach's recruitment from the Michigan State point of view. Bob Gibbons is now ranking Zach the best post player in the nation, also ranking him as the #2 player overall at last week's Nike Camp. 7-13-99...After spending most of the week at the Nike Camp in Indy taking as many looks at the known Purdue recruits I could, as of the final round of games Saturday evening I was ready to give Randolph the crown of being the most impressive power player to come from Indiana since Robinson. And maybe...even better than Robinson. That was until the Saturday evening matchup against 7'1 rising junior Tyson Chandler from California. The most interesting aspect of camps like these are the individual matchups that occur, putting head-to-head two players of the same position while surrounded by equally solid teammates. Sort of mimics the kind of talent they will have around them in college. A little on Chandler first. This is the first time I've seen him play, but I have heard about him since he was in the 8th grade. An article in some paper years ago discussed the fact that this kid already had scholarships offers on the table from high Division I programs before he had even hit high school. Chandler is a legit 7'2 and has a great body (not too thin, not too bulky). What makes him special is he is a very intelligent player, especially defensively. His wingspan allows him to block shots flat-footed, and he has enough strength to keep opponents from pivoting. In comes Randolph, who had been dominating his opponents the entire camp. The only complaint I had heard of Randolph pre-camp was his tendency to cruise. But he couldn't here, and he didn't. Surprised me with his consistently aggressive play. Could muscle position against anyone at the camp. Until the matchup against Chandler. When the two players took the floor, Chandler continued doing what he had been offensively, although Randolph did seem to get rebounding position on him several times. Offensively, Randolph was shut down. Randolph was only able to score later when Chandler got a 3 minute bench penalty for hanging on the rim. What may be useful, since Michigan State seems to be the leader for Randolph, is how to shut him down. Although it helps to be the best center in the nation, I think if any center follows the same principles they can be successful against him. Chandler did a few simple things. He NEVER left his feet on defense. He used his arms to make sure Randolph didn't shoot over him. So, Randolph tried aggressively to pivot around him. Chandler had a wide stance, and simply shuffled a foot in one direction or the other as Randolph would bang side-to-side. And he held his ground. Randolph tried to get his arms around the sides of Chandler to push him out of the way, but couldn't muscle him. Three simple skills...don't leave your feet, keep your arms up, and stay between your opponent and the basket. Randolph would get the ball in the post several times a possession, would attempt to pivot around Chandler while dribbling, pass the ball back out ot the perimeter, muscle better position on Chandler, call for the ball, then try to pivot around him again. After a while, Chandler's teammates caught on to Randolph's attempts to pivot, and would send a guard around the front of Zach to limit his motion. They stripped him once by curling around the backside of Chandler. I have to admit, this was a clinic on how to defense a 270-pound, 6-foot-9 post player. Chandler never made an attempt to deny the ball into the post to Randolph, which also helped. Randolph is quick on his feet, and if you position yourself around the side of him to deny the ball, he will use his great hands to catch the inlet anyway and duck right under you for the basket. Randolph played a total of maybe 5 minutes. He had one 4 minute series against Chandler, played for another minute or so when Chandler went to the bench for a penalty (technical fouls bring an automatic 3 minute bench penalty). Chandler played close to 20 minutes. Once Zach played that first series against Chandler at the beginning of the game, he went to the bench and never came back on the court. He wasn't injured. Coincidentally or not, Zach's trip to the bench for the remainder of thegame happened just after Tom Izzo showed up and made his presence known. Randolph is also very strong in transition, but never really got that part of his game going. When he does, he is impossible to defend unless your are very good at setting up in the post for a charge and are able to take a hard shot to the body. Randolph still amazes me with his soft touch around the basket. The perfect combination of power and finesse. This was strictly a half-court, post-up battle. This whole scenario is rather ironic, since it was just last year at the Nike Camp that Randolph made his name by outplaying the then #1 player in the nation. Marvin Stone was a rising senior and heralded by many to be the best player in the nation. This 6'9 kid named Randolph, a rising juniorat the time, came in and stopped him. I wonder what player will come up and knock Chandler off his pedestal next year? The argument could be made that Randolph is a power forward, so his ability to get around a 7'2 center isn't such a concern. Many scouts in attendance had Randolph as the #1 power forward and Chandler as the #1 center. A few notes from his Nike Camp bio...Favorite NBA player: Shaq... Favorite NBA team: LA Lakers...Favorite Subject: Science...Life's Goal \"To get an education and make it to the NBA\"...What Basketball Has Taught You About Life?: \"There are more important things in life than basketball.\" For a little blurb on his thoughts about Purdue, check out this Indianapolis Star article. 7-3-99...Zach again denied any suggestion he had committed to Michigan State in a newspaper article today. Stating he loved the Purdue coaches, he is still looking around. We are still hearing he would like to stay close to the midwest, and that Michigan State, Purdue and Marquette are top choices with several others schools lagging behind. 6-27-99...The North squad won the game they needed to win a medal this weekend, taking the bronze with a 122-105 win over the East. The top five scorers for the North were players from either the state of Indiana or Illinois. Leading the team were Andre Brown (22 points) and Aaron Carr (22 points), followed by Randolph (20 points), Imari Sawyer (16 points) and Rodney Powell (16 points). Randolph also added 15 boards to finish with his fifth straight double-double. For the tournament, Zach established records for most points scored (102) in the Festival and most rebounds recorded (93), also finished as the Festival's leading scorer (20.4 ppg), leading rebounder (18.6 rpg) and was ranked fifth in field goal percentage (.525), fifth in steals (1.8 spg) and tied for 13th in assists (1.8 apg). For info on the medal game, go to the USA Basketball site. 6-26-99...Another good performance, this time in 30 minutes and a starting role. Zach scored 20 points and added 14 rebounds (9 offensive and 5 defensive). However, the North squad lost another game and will play for the bronze medal tomorrow against the East team who beat them 91-84 yesterday. The game will place Zach and Kevin Garrity as opponents. For a game summary of game four, click on this USA Basketball link. (stats below) 6-26-99...Zach continues to dominate in Colorado, coming off the bench to score 14 points and grab 20 boards in only 23 minutes of playing time. The North team dropped its third game of the festival, this time a 99-98 heartbreaker to the West squad. North will play the undefeated South team Saturday evening, with a chance to move on to either the gold or bronze medal game on Sunday. A wrapup of game 3 can be found on the USA Basketball site. (stats below) 6-25-99 Update... The North squad dropped the second game to the East squad 91-84, leaving them with an 0-2 record. Randolph again led all scorers with 17 points and 18 rebounds, his second double-double of the festival. Through two games, Zach leads all scorers with a 23.0 per game average and leads all rebounders with 22.0 per game. (stats below) 6-25-99...Zach Randolph has been chosen to participate in the USA Basketball Developmental League this summer. Forty-four players from across the country were chosen to participate on one of four teams that will play each other June 25-27 at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs. The USA Basketball event also includes off-court seminars on topics such as the meaning of representing your country, the Olympic experience, drug education, gambling awareness and media training. Randolph will be joined at the Festival by two other recruits known to be considering Purdue, 6'11 center Kevin Garrity (East) and 6'6 wing guard Nick Anderson (South). In the opening round, Randolph's North squad lost to the South squad 99-95. Zach Randolph dominated, setting Festival records for the most field goals attempted (24) and made (12), and for total rebounds (26). Zach scored 29 points and had 19 offensive rebounds and 7 defensive boards. No one on any of the four teams scored more than 20 points after the first round of games Friday afternoon. For a summary of the game, check out this USA Basketball link. Below is the schedule of games this weekend... Game 2 - Friday evening - North vs East, South vs West Game 3 - Saturday morning - North vs West, South vs East Game 4 - Saturday evening - #1 vs #4, #2 vs #3 Game 5 - Sunday - Winners of Game 4, Losers of Game 4 This should also put to rest the speculation that Zach Randolph had to miss the state AAU championship this weekend with Spiece South because he was fulfilling his sentencing obligations in Marion. In fact, the required amount of time was satisfied earlier in the month and Zach will instead be missing the state AAU tournament due to USA Basketball obligations. Since Spiece South won the national championship last year (without Randolph I might add), they will get an automatic invitation to nationals this year and do not necessarily need to win the state championship to qualify. 5-11-99...USA TODAY named Zach Randolph to their All-USA honorable mention team, plus listed Zach as one of the top 15 players in Class of 2000. 4-29-99...Zach will be teaming up with fellow Purdue prospect Brandon Jones at the Spiece tournament this coming weekend. The two will play on the defending national championship AAU squad Spiece South. The following is a list of Spiece South's pool games to be held Friday and Saturday. The toughest game of the three looks to be the 3:30pm matchup with Tim Thomas Playaz, which features a few nationally ranked east coast prep school kids. FRI 10:00pm vs. Chicago Demons (Co-Rec #10) SAT 11:00am vs. Peterson Engineering (Co-Rec #10) SAT 3:30pm vs. Tim Thomas Playaz (Mackey #1) 4-02-99...An article from the Indy Star catches us up on the rather rough spring Randolph has had. Unconfirmed rumors floating around say Randolph has already made a decision to attend Michigan State, but being a popular rumor and a rumor based in truth are sometimes two very different things. 2-21-99...Zach Randolph has been suspended indefinitely from the Marion basketball team due to off-the-court issues. 1-26-99...A scouting report from the Marion vs Lafayette Jeff game this past Friday night... \"Zach Randolph has a presence on the court some people notice, other don't, many times thinking he isn't trying. Well Against Lafayette Jeff, Zach had a very productive quite game. Jeff had no one to match up with Zach, so most of the night they played zone and surrounded Zach with 2 or even 3 guys. Marion has a good team with depth, yet Zach is very much the focal point of most defensive schemes. Marion and Zach pretty muched cruised along in the game, until late in the 1st quarter when Jeff put a little run on them. Zach started working hard under the basket and got a few easy hoops. Jeff tried to full court press, to slow Marion down, but it was not very effective, the Giants just have to many guys withquickness. One of these players stood out from the rest, a freshman named Isaac McClung. This kid is an up and coming player, put him on your to watch list. he doesn't look to score, but he broke the press many times all by himself, dribbling through traffic under control with very good speed. He ran the point most of the night and did not get rattled by the press or Jeff's trap. He eluded the double team by making good decisions and passes. Keep this kid in mind, he can really handle the ball. He also is broad shouldered, he isn't skinny, he has tone on his body already. Most people know what Zach Randolph looks like, BIG shoulders, huge hands and a long wing span. Zach doesn't' jump out of the gym, he doesn't position himself all that well on defense, but he has very soft hands and is much quicker than you think. One of the best moves he made during the game came at the end. After a missed free throw, Zach rebounded the ball and went back up, he couldn't get a shot off with his left hand, so while in the air went to his right hand for a nice little spinning underhand dip. Not bad for 6'8\" 255#, who happens to be left handed. Zach really didn't play hard on defense, but he has flashes where he shows what he can do, when he wants to position himself on the block, there isn't much a high school player can do about it. He still has 1-1/2 years of development, but right now he looks like a top 100 player and definitely a top 50 player in the JR. class. Those big ole soft hands just seem to caress the ball, he has a soft touch in situations when most kids are bricking it off the board. He played well, but he really wasn't pushed tonight. Unofficially, I had Zach with 24 points, 15 rebounds, 4 blocks and 1 or 2 assists. He isn't a bad passer! Marion may be a year away, but they are pretty good right now with lot's of options. Look for a deep run in the tourney.\" (scouting report by Dallas) 1-24-99...Zach Randolph paid another visit to Mackey Arena, this time to see the Boilers beat Michigan. For those of you who taped the game, you can catch a good look at Randolph somewhere within the last five minutes of the game talking to Purdue's Cam Stephens when the camera takes a shot of the bench. 1-20-99...An update on the recruiting of Zach Randolph from the Indianapolis Star. 12-12-98...Some comments on Randolph can be found in this Kokomo Tribune article from Marion coach Moe Smedley and Kokomo coach Basil Mawbey. 12-11-98...Marion defeated Kokomo 66-55 Thursday. Randolph finished the game with another good night, 21 points and 20 boards. For a review of the game, check out this Kokomo Tribune article. 12-12-98...Assistant coach Frank Kendrick was seen out on the road Thursday watching practices at Marion and Northwestern. 12-05-98...With Gene Keady in attendance, Zach scored a career high 30 points in a 79-63 win over Anderson. For a game summary, check out this Indy Star report. 12-4-98...A rundown of some of the schools active with Randolph... Purdue, Michigan State, USC, UCLA, Louisville, Kentucky, Arizona, and NC State. Purdue and Michigan State still look to be leaders, with a decision coming \"sooner than you think\", according to Randolph. 11-25-98...The Giants started the season with a 93-47 rout of Anderson Highland. Marion outrebounded the Scots 59-30 with Randolph collecting 25 boards to go with his 26 points. 10-19-98...A blurb from an Ann Arbor News article this summer. Randolph is talking about the influence of shoe companies in the recruitment of high school players. \"Sure, they want something,\" said Zach Randolph, a junior-to-be from Marion, Ind. \"But we want something, too, and that's to be noticed. It's a tradeoff.\" Asked if he thought the accusations were true that players are \"steered\" by AAU coaches or street agents toward colleges that have certain shoe contracts, Randolph laughed. \"I've heard about it, yeah, but I think somebody would be awfully stupid to pick a school because it wears Nike or whatever,\" he said. \"Me? I'm picking the best place for me to play. If they wear Nike, great. If they don't, that's fine, too.\" 9-15-98...Randolph has been a busy man recently as his recruitment really starts to pick up after a very good Nike Camp showing. In the race for quite a while have been Michigan State and Purdue. We have heard reports of Izzo making plenty of visits to the Marion area to check out Randolph, and now it seems Randolph has been to East Lansing a couple times as well. Randolph's most recent visit north has been to witness the dedication of a new MSU athletic center. MSU also brought in a few of their former athletes, plus another junior prospect Marcus Taylor. Taylor is rated as a top 5 junior prospect. Rumors of a Taylor/Randolph package deal have already surfaced, but I think we know how those usually pan out. Thanks to a fellow Boiler fan who recently spoke to Randolph in Marion, we know that both Purdue and MSU are high on his list. Also on the list are Michigan, Arizona, Utah and Kentucky. Randolph is said to be a fan of Rick Majerus, but his mother's wish to keep him close to home may eliminate the Utes and Arizona when the times comes to make a decision. Randolph said Indiana is not in the picture which shouldn't bother Knight much since he has his eyes on 6'9 Bloomington junior Jared Jeffries. 7-9-98...Randolph is making a very big name for himself at the Nike Camp in Indianapolis. According to Lexington Herald Leader reporter Jerry Tipton, Zach \"competed as though it were the seventh game of the NBA Finals. He bodied Stone repeatedly and played with an unmistakable zeal.\" Clark Francis of Hoop Scoop spoke of Zach's play against the #1 senior in the nation as a \"total domination\", and even USA TODAY gave Zach a mention today. From a source at the camp who has said Zach is playing a combination of power forward and center, Zach is a legitimate top 10 player at the camp, and and early leader as the best junior at Nike. Video of Randolph appeared in the Indianapolis media on Wednesday, showing a host of power moves around a sizable defender (likely Stone). One baseline drive and a soft flip up over a defender, plus the target of a quick pass in the paint which he immediately put up with a finger-roll with his left hand, around a defender who was obviously thinking he was defending a right-handed shooter. 7-6-98...A scouting report from a guy from my old stomping grounds around Marion on Zach Randolph...\"When I first saw Zach playing his freshman year at Marion I said you have to be joking. This kid has no business being on a basketball court but boy has he come a loooooong way. The first time I saw him he was a tall, scrawny kid with athletic ability and big heart but absolutely no coordination. He could barely walk without tripping over his own feet. You have to give him and Coach Smedley a lot of credit because he has developed into a man. This kid can absolutely dominate the boards and has very nice footwork under the basket. He has really developed an offensive game and is a great shot blocker. I see that he has Purdue on his list of schools. He would be a great player for Purdue to try and get. I think he could really prosper under Coach Keady. He still has a lot to learn and develop but he is going to be a great player. If he keeps developing and adds some strength he has NBA potential. I would not be surprised if he grows a couple more inches before he graduates either.\" (scouting report by Philip Parker) 7-1-98...Zach has been extended an invitation to the Nike Camp to be held next week in Indianapolis. 6-29-98...Peegs from the IU Basketball Recruiting Page has this scouting report on Randolph from the Indiana State AAU Tournament. 6-28-98...Doug Griffiths, writing for the Indianapolis Star, has this update on Randolph. Most of the comments in the article were taken from an interview at the Spiece tournament. Since that time, Randolph has made an unofficial visit (6/22) to Michigan. 3-28-97...A last second miss by Andrae Betts was short and the Giants lost their first ever IHSAA championship game. Pike switched to a 1-3-1 zone in the final minutes and used freethrows to win the game 57-54. Marion finishes the season 24-3. A scouting report from the game... \"Rodney Smith impressed me more than he has. Will be a good player for the Boilers in time at the small forward position. Will need to develop a better shot but his form is not bad. If Randolph grows any more he may be lethal in the post with his strength, good hands and he keeps the ball high and gets it on the glass quickly. I wonder if he might get invited to the Nike camp now. Kincaid is a nice player but I don't think he is as good as the Hoop Scoop and others rate him. He does not handle the ball well for a 6-1 guy, doesn't defend well and is very frail. Chris Thomas had a nightmare game but he has enormous potential. He needs to learn to play the game at a faster pace and be more aggressive. Maybe he just looked casual cause that Andre Betts guy was so quick. Andre will be a steal for a low Division One or Div II program. Best team won.\" (scouting report by Peegs) Purdue recruit Rodney Smith on Randolph...\"Randolph is a great player. He's so big we couldn't get around him.\" 3-21-98...When your 6'8 and pushing 250 pounds, you can say just about anything you want on the basketball court and not get much of a response. But it wasn't Zach Randolph who was running his mouth in Marion's Semistate win over Crown Point, rather his teammate JoJo Williams. \"Randolph is a great player and would compliment you from time to time,\" said Crown Point's Westforth. \"Jojo was the only one talking.\" Randolph quietly scored 17 points and grabbed 12 boards in Marion's 76-63 victory in the Class 4A Semistate at Mackey Arena. \"Their size was a big factor,\" said Crown Point guard Kurt Klepsch. \"We couldn't budge that 6'8 guy.\" Westforth agreed. \"That guy was huge, and a lot stronger than I thought.\" Crown Point was outrebounded 37-23 in the game. \"Their big guy (Randolph) didn't even have to jump and his hands were on the rim,\" said CP guard Damean Clinton. \"He made it impossible to rebound.\" Marion moves on to the Semistate championship game tonight against Elkhart Central. (stats below) 2-27-98...Among the prospects present from the Illinois game, was one of the state's top sophomore big men Zach Randolph from Marion High.
