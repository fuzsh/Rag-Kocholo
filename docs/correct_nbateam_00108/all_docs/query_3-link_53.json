        "text": "I've never known exactly what becomes of all of our bad memories as fans. Granted, in the case of Zach Randolph, these were at one time entirely warranted. After all that early promise, Randolph morphed into a goon in Portland. With the Knicks, he was second only to Stephon Marbury and his bunga bunga SUV as a symbol of Isiah Thomas-era excess. He put up numbers, sure, but even Eddy Curry managed that kind of mirage—one partly a function of the New York tabloid sports press, whose vitriol can, at times, be seen as self-loathing blowback for the pointless hope they inspire.\n\nRandolph found trouble, packed on pounds, became a running joke, and one day woke up in Memphis, a franchise that couldn't figure out how to sell itself. NBA teams don't usually have this problem. But then something peculiar happened. Maybe it was the low-profile market of Memphis (though Portland certainly had that), lessons finally learned, or a locale appealed to Randolph. He flourished, picking up where he left off when the Blazers first anointed him their go-to star of the future, and tore through the West right up to the edge of the Conference Finals.\n\nNow Randolph is out for 6-8 weeks with a torn MCL, leaving this aspiring power without its rock down low. Randolph long ago redeemed himself; the clock is now ticking on when he can serve as redeemer, lurching back onto the court to revive the Grizzlies' playoff plans. They should have no problem securing a trip to the postseason even with Randolph out, but if he can't return, there's little chance of repeating last season's magnetic showing. That's even with Rudy Gay, the team's obligatory high-flying swingman, healthy and active; he missed 2011's run due to an injury of his own. Zach Randolph used to be the subject of gallows humor; the last 24 hours have brought loving tributes to his unathletic prowess disguised as humor. Randolph, all touch, timing and stubbornness, rarely, if ever leaves the ground, and makes the most of an economy of movement.\n\nMemphis needs Zach Randolph back so they can retain legitimacy. But we all need Randolph, perhaps to an exaggerated degree. His career arc, a cliche that hardly ever comes true and thus needs all the fodder it can get, reinforces a certain moralistic view of sports. He's a good guy now, a scourge transformed. Actually, he's gone so far that figuratively speaking, we would all leave our kids with him. It's a model of redemption so extreme that it should be impossible. Either that or maybe he was never as bad, or today isn't as good, as we want him to be. It's idiotic to think that a menace to society could, in a manner of years, turn into a shimmering knight. Everything Randolph was saddled with in Portland and New York—maybe that came from us, not him."
