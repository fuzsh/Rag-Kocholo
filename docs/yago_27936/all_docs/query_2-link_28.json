        "text": "I recently watched the 1994 remake of Miracle on 34th Street for the first time. I’d seen the 1947 original before, so I was fully expecting a recreation of the famous court scene. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find something totally different. There was no direct proof that Kris Kringle is actually Santa Claus based on physical evidence from the post office. Instead, there was a beautiful illustration of the fact that we, as a country, already believe in a Being we can’t prove the existence of.\n\nYou can watch the scene here. It’s less than two minutes in length, and it’s well worth your time on this fine Christmas Day.\n\nThis is an example of a remake improving upon the original. The original’s solution to the central problem comes across as more of a fluke than anything. An outside power saves the day when the lawyer’s best efforts prove inadequate. But in the remake, Kringle’s lawyer hatches a brilliant plan to convince the judge once and for all that there is no case against his client. In both films, the happy ending relies on the federal government to make it work. But the remake makes so much more sense to me.\n\nI love that I live in a country that values God above everything else. It’s not our superior firepower, bravery, or luck that has established the United States of America and preserved it until today. Rather, it is our faith in God that has done all of that.\n\nNot just any god. The God of Israel. Jehovah. The Son of God. Jesus Christ. The Savior of the world is the God of this land. And we will serve Him and have faith in Him, or we will lose everything special about us and be swept off the face of the Earth. That is our position.\n\nSo yes, it is perfectly valid to take some things on faith. I cannot prove in worldly terms that there is a God. But I have faith in Him. I put my trust in God, as every American has since the days of the Pilgrims.\n\nThis is the Deja Reviewer wishing you a Merry Christmas!\n\nThe image is the copyright of its owner."
