        "text": "-May contain spoilers.\n\nMany people only know Marty Feldman as Igor in 1974's \"Young Frankenstein\". And, I'll admit, unless one does some research, that's all one can really ever know. It's a shame that his other stuff, such as this film, has gone more unnoticed. Anyway...\n\n\"In God We Tru$t\", from what I've heard and read really did horribly at the box office, and the critics just seemed to rip it to shreds! It's as if they couldn't find anything good about it. Well, I can. I really enjoyed this film. Maybe it wasn't well received because to me, in this movie, Feldman doesn't play his usual silly, comic relief based roles. I mean yes, he's funny in this film, but he has a much more straight role than in his other films, and yeah...he actually acts and emotes. Also, maybe romantic comedies weren't as big then, who knows? Or maybe the press just didn't think Marty Feldman had the right to play a serious, or semi-romantic role. Regardless, I feel that in this film, Feldman gets to showcase his real acting ability, and he's really great in this movie. And there's great support from the likes of Peter Boyle, Andy Kaufman, Richard Pryor, etc...\n\nLooks-wise, Feldman was not the \"conventional leading man\", but in this film, I feel he makes it work. His \"By the way, I think I love you...do you mind?\" is delivered in an absolutely convincing and adorable way...\n\nSo yes, maybe this film is more a cute, sweet, sort of movie...but why did all of Marty Feldman's films have to be silly, manic, or zany? I think if anything the fact that he did different things shows his versatility. The concept of this film, a monk who really doesn't belong in the monastery, having to go out into the imperfect and corrupt world, falling in love with a prostitute, etc...I mean, it's great. All I can really see that is wrong with it, is simply the fact that unlike most Feldman movies that make one go, \"HA HA!\" this may make one go...\"Awww\".\n\nSome deep lines too, such as \"It may not be the best of all possible worlds but it's the only one we've got\" and \"Doubts are about the only certainties I have right now.\" Maybe I'm not with the popular opinion, but I enjoyed it and give it 8/10."
