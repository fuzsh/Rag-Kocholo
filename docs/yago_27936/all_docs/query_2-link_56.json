        "text": "Andy Kaufman (born January 17, 1949, Queens, New York, U.S.—died May 16, 1984, Los Angeles, California) was an American comedian, actor, and performance artist. His groundbreaking and experimental comedic acts made him one of the most influential comics of all time.\n\nKaufman grew up with ambitions to become a performer, stoked in many ways by his passionate fandom of professional wrestling. He entertained at children’s parties while himself a young man and, while studying television at a junior college in Boston, he had a campus TV show, Uncle Andy’s Fun House. He returned to New York City and began performing in comedy clubs.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nOver time, Kaufman developed a unique routine that was just as much performance art as it was stand-up comedy. (In fact, Kaufman always insisted that he was not a comedian and had never told a joke onstage but was instead an “entertainer.”) Kaufman’s stage routine centered around unexpected comedy-show acts, which over the years ranged from reading sections of the novel The Great Gatsby to singing the repetitive folk song “99 Bottles of Beer” to completion. The most notable character in his chameleonic performances was “Foreign Man,” an awkward immigrant from a fictional country who would, among other things, selectively lip-sync to the theme song of the Mighty Mouse cartoon or do a series of bad and heavily accented celebrity impersonations before culminating in Kaufman’s own impeccable Elvis Presley impersonation. A much less sympathetic Kaufman stage creation was Tony Clifton, a foul-mouthed lounge singer who constantly berated his audience. Kaufman (and, occasionally, his friend and writing partner Bob Zmuda) would wear a fat suit, makeup, wig, fake mustache, and sunglasses to create Clifton, which allowed him to insist that Kaufman and Clifton were two different people—a ruse that he maintained all of his life and that Zmuda perpetuated by appearing in public as Clifton after Kaufman’s death.\n\nKaufman quickly became a comedy sensation in New York, which led to appearances on Saturday Night Live (1975– ), including a famous debut as Foreign Man on the show’s first episode that introduced America to his signature “cringe humor.” He then adapted Foreign Man into the character Latka Gravas on the sitcom Taxi (1978–83). However, outside of costarring in two feature films (In God We Tru$t [1980] and Heartbeeps [1981]), Kaufman did not use the increased exposure that came with starring as a lovable eccentric in a hit television show to broaden his appeal. Instead, he actively tried to alienate the public through a series of confrontational or simply bizarre talk-show interviews—as well as starting an apparent brawl during a live broadcast of a sketch-comedy show that turned out to be scripted—which culminated in yet another unexpected career turn: his stint as a professional wrestler. He took on the persona of a chauvinistic wrestling “heel” and began challenging women—and only women—to wrestling matches. Kaufman promoted himself as the “Inter-Gender Wrestling Champion of the World” and claimed an unbeaten record against all of his opponents. At this time, he also had a staged fued with pro-wrestling star Jerry “The King” Lawler that included a match between the two and a notorious fake fight on an episode of Late Night with David Letterman."
