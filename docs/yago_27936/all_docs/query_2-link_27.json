        "text": "The highly anticipated latest installment of the “God’s Not Dead” franchise is set to hit theaters this fall and this powerful film could not come at a better time.\n\nPremiering exclusively in theaters on September 12, “God’s Not Dead: In God We Trust” centers on contemporary issues related to freedom of speech, religious liberties, and the role of faith in public life, making it relevant to current societal debates.\n\nGreat American Pure Flix is excited to partner with this franchise in its latest theatrical release! This partnership aims to connect faith values to everyday life, including civic responsibilities regardless of political affiliation or views.\n\nThe film tells the story of Reverend David Hill (David A. R. White), who feels compelled to enter a congressional race after the sudden death of a favored incumbent. Meanwhile, his opponent is determined to push religion out of the public square, causing even greater division in a time of profound political, civil and spiritual turmoil. As David navigates the treacherous waters of modern politics, his faith and principles are put to the ultimate test as he strives to be a beacon of hope and optimism for many people yearning for spiritual and moral leadership.\n\n“‘God’s Not Dead: In God We Trust’ serves as a bold reminder that complacency can erode our liberties, freedom, and faith when we fail to actively defend and uphold them,” said producer Michael Scott. “If we truly believe in a faithful God who is ‘good all the time,’ we must be willing to speak out and stand firm in our beliefs, even in the face of great risks and opposition.”\n\nIn addition to White, the film also stars Isaiah Washington, Dean Cain, Samaire Armstrong, Ray Wise, Scott Baio and Charlene Tilton. There will also be guest appearances by Governor Mike Huckabee, Raymond Arroyo, and of course, the fan-favorite, Grammy Award-Winning band Newsboys.\n\nThe famous Christian rock band is also set to release a new song next month that will also be featured in the film. The song, “In God We Trust,” will be released on July 19 as part of the band’s new album, “Worldwide Revival: Part One.”\n\n“New song, new movie,” the band posted on Instagram last month. “We’re stoked to be working with our GND movie fam again & can’t wait for you to see more of what we’ve been working on!”\n\nGreat American Pure Flix is partnering with Pinnacle Peak Pictures to bring this faith-inspiring film to the big screen, and we are confident that fans will leave the theater feeling a sense of hope and purpose in the midst of this election season.\n\n\"God's Not Dead: In God We Trust\" explores the enduring relevance of faith in public life and the critical fight to keep religious values at the heart of governance,” read a post on the film’s Instagram page. “Featuring a star-studded cast and powerful message, this film calls on believers to stand firm in faith and make their voices heard.”\n\nMark your calendars for September 12, and keep an eye out for tickets, which will soon be available on Fathom’s web site. In fact, you can even sign up to be notified when tickets are on sale."
