        "text": "“We’re stoked,” the band’s official Instagram channel said.\n\nThe Newsboys, of course, are known for more than simply God’s Not Dead films, having had 35 songs chart on Billboard’s Hot Christian Songs list and 33 No. 1 radio hits dating back to their launch in the 1980s.\n\nBut to many movie fans, they are the rock band in the God’s Not Dead films. The first release in that franchise, the hit film God’s Not Dead (2014), featured a Newsboys song of the same name. (The song was actually released two years prior to the film.) The second film in the series, God’s Not Dead: A Light in Darkness, included the Newsboys’ tune Guilty. Both movies showed the band in concert.\n\nMeanwhile, the Newsboys are weeks away from releasing their latest album, Worldwide Revival: Part One, the first part of a two-part album. One song from the project, Heaven on Earth, already has nearly 1 million YouTube streams.\n\nThe band’s goal with the album, Agee said, is to “spark revival everywhere we go.”\n\nThis summer, the Newsboys are on their Worldwide Revival Nights tour.\n\n“The crowd gives you an energy, and you know that everybody out there is going through something in their lives,” Agee said. “That’s why we listen to Christian music -- to hopefully be uplifted and to be pointed toward the King. And so it just never gets old.”\n\nAsked what advice he would give Christians living in a dark culture, frontman Michael Tait told Crosswalk Headlines, “Keep doing what you’re doing. Don’t fret, don’t fear. That won’t help you one bit. God’s in control -- we either believe it, or we don’t.”\n\nPhoto Credit: ©SWN/Capitol Christian Music Group"
