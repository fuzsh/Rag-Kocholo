        "text": "Pinnacle Peak Pictures is bringing a slate of faith-based films to the Cannes market, including a new installment in the “God’s Not Dead” franchise.\n\nEntitled “God’s Not Dead: In God We Trust,” the film will be released theatrically in the U.S. this fall, but, like the rest of Pinnacle’s slate, foreign territories are available to buyers. The new “God’s Not Dead” film follows the series’ protagonist, Rev. David Hill (played once again by David A.R. White), who, with the help of a skilled political strategist, runs for political office on a platform of preserving “religious freedom” and healing divisions. The cast also includes Dean Cain, who appeared in the first film in the franchise and is best known for “Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman,” as well as Isaiah Washington (“Grey’s Anatomy”) and Ray Wise (“X-Men: First Class”).\n\nIn addition, Pinnacle Peak Pictures will present “Disciples in the Moonlight,” which it describes as a a film set in a “dystopian future where the Bible has been outlawed.” The film is set for a theatrical release on July 24 in the U.S. It stars Todd Terry (“Breaking Bad”), Brett Varvel (“American Underdog”), Baylee Toney (“The Redeemer“) and Myles Clohessy (“Classified”).\n\nLastly, Pinnacle is bringing ”Average Joe,” a legal drama about “a soldier turned high school coach” who “battles in the courts” for the “religious freedoms of all.” The film stars Eric Close (“American Sniper”), Amy Acker (“Cabin in the Woods”), Austin Woods (“American Horror Story”) and Annabelle Holloway (“The Walking Dead”). The film will be released in the U.S. this October.\n\n“The team at Pinnacle Peak Pictures has produced three excellent new films to go along with our library of popular titles,” said Ron Gell, the company’s vice president of international sales and distribution. “Audiences have shown they are hungry for uplifting, suspenseful and dramatic features with top production values and exceptional casts, which is why I’m looking forward to a busy sales season this year in Cannes.”"
