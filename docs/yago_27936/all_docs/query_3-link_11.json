        "text": "“Then Jesus said, “Did I not tell you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?” – John 11:40\n\nWe are always told to have faith and to trust God. In certain situations, that is easier said than done. We sometimes think things will be easier if we take it into our own hands. Nobody ever said having faith would be easy, but it will be worth it and here is why.\n\n1. He Knows Better Than We Do\n\nGod knows everything we are going through at this very moment and everything we will go through in the future. He knows the best way to handle every situation so we get the best possible outcome and we need to trust him with that. We need to follow his path and trust that he knows best, because he does.\n\n“But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.” – James 1:6\n\n2. All Things Are Possible With God\n\nHe knows the desires of your heart. If you trust in him with the things that you want most, he will take care of it. He knows what is best for your life. If you feel like your goals are hard to achieve or even impossible, think again. Anything is possible with God. He has your back and will help you through anything, all you have to do is have faith.\n\n“‘If you can’?” said Jesus. “Everything is possible for one who believes.” – Mark 9:23\n\n3. He Is Worthy Of Our Trust\n\nHaving faith is having trust. You have to trust with your entire being that God has your back that he will help you and take care of you. He knows what is best, but to truly embrace what he has planned for you, you have to fully trust. Our trust is not foolish, for our God is both faithful and good. Dig into Scripture. Acquaint yourself with the promises of God, with his longsuffering faithfulness to the Israelites, to Abraham, to us all. Get to know the character of God and your joy and willingness to trust in Him will abound.\n\n“Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight” – Proverbs 3:5-6\n\n4. He Knows What He Is Doing\n\nGod knows exactly what he wants for your life. He has a purpose for you and has everything planned out. He knows who you are going to marry, how many kids you are going to have, what job you will have and every other detail of your life, both big and small. He knows what you are going to do tomorrow, next month and years down the road. Do not doubt his plan, because he knows all and he has a perfect plan."
