        "text": "“Some people argue that “under God” is a form of prayer, and thus it is unconstitutional to have schoolchildren recite it. However, a careful reading of the Pledge of Allegiance reveals that we are not pledging allegiance to God. We are, instead, pledging allegiance to a republic. The Pledge then describes the republic as one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. In other words, it acknowledges the Founders’ declaration that our freedom comes from God, not the state.\n\nThroughout America’s history, as Jefferson (18th century), Lincoln (19th century), and King (20th century) attested, the American people’s freedom — the freedom of your neighbors, your co-workers, your children, and their teachers, are because we are one nation under God. Take that principle away, remove it from our national consciousness, and we will lose the very basis for the freedoms we so easily take for granted. As Jefferson warned:\n\n‘God who gave us life gave us liberty. Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God?’ (Inscribed in stone at the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, DC)\n\nIn today’s war of ideas, people will not defend what they do not cherish, and they will not cherish what they do not understand.”\n\nJan. 31, 2018\n\n“Illinois attorney Louis Albert Bowman had good reasons for proposing this addition to the draft version back in 1948 [officially added in 1954]. First, he recognized that a Judeo-Christian worldview has formed the bedrock of American culture, law and government since the nation’s founding. Second, he understood that the First Great Awakening had united the American people around three truths: a belief in God-given inalienable rights; a belief in God’s higher law; and a belief in the equality of all people before God. Third, he knew that these convictions, which fueled the struggle for independence, have held our nation together for almost 250 years. In short, he saw that without faith in God, there would have been no U.S.”\n\nJan. 6, 2021\n\n“From this day forward, the millions of our school children will daily proclaim in every city and town, every village and rural school house, the dedication of our nation and our people to the Almighty. To anyone who truly loves America, nothing could be more inspiring than to contemplate this rededication of our youth, on each school morning, to our country’s true meaning.\n\nEspecially is this meaningful as we regard today’s world. Over the globe, mankind has been cruelly torn by violence and brutality and, by the millions, deadened in mind and soul by a materialistic philosophy of life. Man everywhere is appalled by the prospect of atomic war. In this somber setting, this law and its effects today have profound meaning. In this way we are reaffirming the transcendence of religious faith in America’s heritage and future; in this way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which forever will be our country’s most powerful resource, in peace or in war.”\n\nJune 14, 1954\n\n“The addition of the words ‘under God’ to the Pledge, and the school district’s policy and practice of teacher-led recitation of the Pledge, do not violate the Establishment Clause… Indeed, the best evidence suggests just the opposite: The Establishment Clause was designed not just to prevent the establishment of a national church but to prohibit the federal government from interfering with state encouragement of religion as the states exercised their core police powers to protect the health, safety, welfare, and morals of the people. To hold that the Constitution prohibits the State or school district from allowing the recitation of a pledge that acknowledges the existence of God would ignore the history and intent of the First Amendment and would undermine the efforts of the States to foster the kind of moral virtue the Founders thought essential to the perpetuation of republican institutions.”\n\nApr. 30, 2007\n\n“As the Pro/Con site demonstrates, our national and state governments have included references to God or a Supreme Being since their inception. These phrases, while unquestionably religious in nature, truly have taken on a more historical context and, as such, their coercive effect seems, at most, minimal. The notion that we must excise all references to God from our government despite our Founding Fathers’ own references to God at the time they were embracing the First Amendment seems nonsensical. In my view, when the likelihood of coercion is speculative, the reference to God minimal and, in part, historic, and the adult’s participation voluntary, I do not believe the Establishment Clause prohibits the use of the phrase ‘under God’ in the Pledge.”\n\nNov. 3, 2005\n\n“Americans want to preserve our national pledge, which represents our devotion and loyalty to our country. Hand upon heart, little children across the country should be able to continue reciting this pledge without the fear of it being stripped away by activist judges. Our pledge distinguishes us from many other nations that also proclaim their patriotism. We as Americans are free from an established church and are ensured with the privilege to worship as we choose. Our pledge simply emphasizes that freedom.\n\nThe words ‘under God’ in our Pledge remind us of the many struggles our Founders had to endure through history to secure the freedoms we now enjoy. It is an oath uniting us as a nation and a promise to maintain the honor of our country.”\n\nJuly 19, 2006\n\n“The words ‘under God’ in the Pledge of Allegiance are not an unconstitutional establishment of religion. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held this to be the case…\n\nTo continue to allow school children to recite the Pledge of Allegiance in its current form does not establish a particular religion or advance a non-secular agenda. To the contrary, the recognition of a creator who is the source of all rights, by the United States government, is the first step towards properly administrating protecting the rights of all American citizens.”\n\nDec. 2003\n\n“The recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, when considered in its entirety and in its full context, cannot be considered a religious exercise. First, the words ‘under God’…are a historical statement, not a supplication, as would be the case in a prayer or similar religious exercise. Second, the words of the Pledge, read as a whole, are clearly the words of a patriotic statement, not of a religious invocation… This perception is strengthened by the physical acts that accompany the Pledge, such as turning to view the flag. The entire focus of the activity is the flag, which students recognize as a patriotic symbol, not as a religious one. The fact that the flag, rather than God or religion, is the focus of the Pledge, is the very reason why some religious students choose not to participate in its recitation.”\n\nDec. 2003\n\n“I was starting second grade when I first recited the pledge of allegiance. The same year, my mother and I had just immigrated to the United States in search of a better life.\n\nLike that day 30 years ago, today the pledge still does not speak to me or even encourage patriotic introspection. It’s not due to a lack of appreciation for my new homeland, however.\n\nThe pledge’s history is deeply rooted in nativism and white supremacy… At worst, the pledge’s disturbing history excludes countless communities, including my own family. At best, reciting the pledge has become a perfunctory exercise of rote memorization…\n\nThe upgraded version should read: “I pledge allegiance and love to our indigenous and immigrant heritage, rooted in the United States of America, to our civil rights for which we strive, one voice, one nation, for equality and justice for all.”\n\nInserting the word “love” in the upgraded pledge anchors us to a genuine patriotic affection for civic virtue, collaboration and respect for each other. This is a sharp contrast to the past and current misguided nationalism that very often breeds cultural, religious and ethnic intolerance.”\n\nJan. 22, 2019\n\n“The words ‘under God’ should be removed. They negate the pledge’s “One nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.” To meet that high standard, a nation’s citizens must learn and respect the beliefs of others. Then it can draw upon the strengths of numerous traditions to form a true consensus about moral and ethical standards for our time. Google “Pledge of Allegiance.” One of the first entries is a video, A Primer for Kids on the pledge. The page for “under God” has two images: a Bible with a cross on it, and an image of Jesus Christ, his red heart prominent. That common message is not “One nation, indivisible.” To restore Earth and survive, we must learn from and care for each other.”\n\nJan. 6, 2021\n\n“I think its removal is inevitable. I’ve never felt comfortable with mixing political power and religious identity. Mixing the two never seems to turn out well for religious or cultural communities, bending always in the direction of political power and threatening the rights of whichever religious or cultural community is currently out of favor. In its original 1892 form it said, “I pledge allegiance to my Flag and the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.” This form of the pledge didn’t harm the exercise of religious liberty in any way. When it is removed, we will return to the founding norm of separation between church and state, ensuring the survival of both. Seeing our current obsession with divisive politics — embraced by some as a kind of insane virtue — I believe mixing the two remains a losing proposition for people of faith everywhere.”\n\nJan. 6, 2021\n\n“I think [the phrase] should [be removed] — but not for the reasons you’d assume. I don’t believe we need a pledge of allegiance. The pledge suggests that I belong to one country instead of the planet. I think of myself as a global citizen. I don’t like the idea of indoctrination into ideas and principles that we don’t actually practice. We say ‘one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.’ While we may be one nation — we are deeply divided and the principles of liberty and justice for all are simply not reflected in our society. To say this untruth falls ‘under God’ seems so contrary to what I understand about the concept of God. Frankly, I don’t think any God would want to be associated with these arbitrary words. “\n\nJan. 6, 2021\n\n“The language under God may not be establishing a particular sect of religion but it does establish the sects of religions that believe in God. Therefore, it excludes those who do not have that same belief. The writers of the amended Pledge [to include under God] may not have had the intent to establish religion but the intent is largely irrelevant to its actual effect…\n\nTaking under God out of the Pledge would not be an attack on anyone’s freedom… I would suggest that the use of under God is not necessary to remind the government of the natural freedoms we have. The version of the Pledge before the amendment in 1954 reads as follows:\n\n‘I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.’\n\nI believe that this version of the Pledge accomplishes all the same goals of promoting freedom and patriotism without establishing any religion. Since the original version of the Pledge did not have the phrase under God it would be natural for the country to readopt an older version of the Pledge.”\n\nFeb. 8, 2015\n\n“The First Amendment states ‘Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.’ As I understand it, this resulted from the Framers’ awareness of the persecution and animosity that inevitably accompanies state religions. With this in mind, they made the decision to ensure religious freedom by keeping the government out of that sensitive area. Personally, I think this was a good idea. And even if I didn’t, it’s one of the fundamental rules of our society. Thus, when I see our Pledge of Allegiance containing the words ‘under God,’ I see a gross violation of one of our foremost Constitutional mandates.”\n\nJan. 30, 2009\n\n“The current version of the Pledge of Allegiance, as amended in 1954 to include the phrase ‘under God,’ violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment… The Pledge is not ceremonial deism as defined by this Court. Reciting the Pledge is an active swearing of loyalty to one’s country, not a passive reading or even reciting of a historical document. Furthermore, the phrase ‘under God,’ like all other phrases in the Pledge, has a distinctive meaning: that this country is presently a nation ‘under God,’ not a historical acknowledgment that it was founded under a god…\n\nThe use of the current version of the Pledge in public schools violates this Court’s coercion analysis. Reciting ‘under God’ is a religious act. Children, while theoretically having the right to opt out of reciting the Pledge, may not do so because of fear of exposure as outsiders, because they do not have the capacity to do so, or because they wish not to appear unpatriotic to their teacher and classmates. Furthermore, the wish of parents for their children not to recite the Pledge may be ignored, indoctrinating them against the parents’ will.”\n\nFeb. 12, 2004\n\n“Daily affirmation of the existence of a specific monotheistic God, or even a generic monotheistic god, is a religious affirmation even if it is draped in the Flag. Thus, a public school district policy that requires teachers to lead willing students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance with the phrase ‘under God’ violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment…The phrase ‘under God’ does not qualify as mere ceremonial deism when included in a daily teacher-led recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance by public school elementary students. It is a government sponsored claim of the existence of a single deity that excludes believers in all other deities and excludes those who do not believe in any deity.”\n\nFeb. 10, 2004\n\n“The peoples of our nation are not united in their understanding of the meaning of the word ‘God,’ or even in their understanding of what it would mean for this Court to reverse the Ninth Circuit’s decision. In fact, contemporary arguments about the meaning of the word ‘God’ are rife with particularized religious content. In such an environment, this Court should not sanction a Pledge of Allegiance that separates Americans into the preferred and the marginalized…\n\nIn other words, it is because ours is a nation of individuals under God, or more accurately, it is because ours is a nation grounded in each individual’s relationship with the Divine (however conceived by conscience), that a policy requiring teachers to lead school children in the recitation of a Pledge of Allegiance, which includes the words ‘under God,’ is unconstitutional.”\n\nFeb. 13, 2004\n\n“Turning from proclamation to politics, however, requires much duplicitous testimony. In public, politically powerful preachers will declare that the nation must acknowledge allegiance to God and will contend that the public square would be naked without meaningful references to Deity. In court, slick lawyers will argue that the oath in the pledge does not establish a religion because the words ‘under God’ have ‘no significant religious content.’ How fundamentalist Christians can so callously profane the name of their Lord – making it legally meaningless and publicly bearing false witness about it – reveals something about the depth of either their understanding or their spirituality, especially when they are leading a simultaneous crusade to post the Decalogue in public places.”\n\nOct. 2005"
