        "text": "GOD is not dead in Hollywood, but he's been feeling awfully funny lately.\n\nIn his latest movie incarnation -- Morgan Freeman in the comedy ''Bruce Almighty,'' opening May 23 -- God is unorthodox enough to let some clown named Bruce (Jim Carrey) give omnipotence a spin. Yet like movie Gods long gone, the new one undoubtedly speaks volumes about his times, if we have ears to hear.\n\nThis is not your father's cinematic deity. That would be the glee-free being glimpsed in Cecil B. DeMille's ''Ten Commandments'' (1956), or rather, not glimpsed; Moses, played by Charlton Heston, contends by turns with a pillar of light, animated lightning bolts and a Voice. When speaking via burning bush, God is Mr. Heston's voice slowed down; in the Golden Calf scene, He's a combination of Mr. Heston, other men and DeMille himself.\n\n''DeMille never admitted his voice was one of those used in the voice of God,'' a sound man, Ed Penney, told the film historian Katherine Orrison. ''He was afraid people would crack wise. 'DeMille has always acted like God -- now he's talking like God.' '' Ms. Orrison's 1999 book about the making of ''The Ten Commandments,'' ''Written in Stone,'' demonstrates that playing God was precisely his style.\n\nThe God of the Old Hollywood Testament was authoritarian, like His creators, but no more so than the conventional God-fearing movie audience itself. Not even DeMille could afford to look impious. ''He kept a Bible on the lunch table,'' said the film's composer, Elmer Bernstein, by telephone. He added that he had found it ironic that the Hebrews in the Exodus scene were actually ''Egyptian army guys'' marching to a tune that DeMille decreed should sound like ''Onward Christian Soldiers.''\n\nFew dared break the lockstep of orthodoxy. If God and fun kept company onscreen, it was in the carefully circumscribed world of black film. In the stereotype-ridden but rousing 1936 adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play ''The Green Pastures,'' God isn't a mere dancing light of faith but a tall man in a dark suit: Rex Ingram, as De Lawd, is the apotheosis of the Southern preacher. The film begins with a defensive prologue: ''Thousands of Negroes in the Deep South visualize God and Heaven in terms of people and things they know in their everyday life. 'The Green Pastures' is an attempt to portray that humble, reverent conception.''\n\nThus immunized, the film lets fly some rather subversive imagery: New Orleans jazz orgies; stabbings; a little kid angel riding a clumpy, cottonlike cloud across Heaven as if it were a bucking bronco, hollering like a wild Tchoupitoula, ''Woowoowoo, I'se a Indian!'' Ingram anchors the jocose fantasy with extraordinary New Testament warmth and Old Testament gravitas. His baritone is a more plausible voice of God than Heston and DeMille put together.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
