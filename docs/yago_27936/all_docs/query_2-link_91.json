        "text": "It should probably be pointed out from the outset that Winshluss's In God We Trust is not for everyone. Readers of a religious nature or sensitive disposition may want to avoid this, as it doesn't pull any punches.\n\nThat disclaimer out of the way, let's get down to the book. French cartoonist Vincent Paronnaud - aka Winshluss - is best known on these shores for his epic retelling of Pinocchio, one that was very much not aimed at children.\n\nIn his new graphic novel In God We Trust, he turns his attention on Christianity. The anthology of stories deals with everything from traditional Old and New Testament tales to the secret rock and roll life (and death) of Pope John Paul II.\n\nIn doing so, he casts a critical eye over many of the attitudes expounded by the church and its followers, as well as pointing out the logical and moral inconsistencies of some of the oldest religious myths and parables.\n\nIt's easy to be blinded by the vitriol that Winshluss obviously feels towards religion - his hard-drinking, lecherous God makes it hard to miss - but balancing that, there does seem to be an underlying current of affection for the material, of the kind reserved for an embarrassing and politically incorrect uncle. Often his strips tear into injustice, corruption and inconsistency rather than the act of belief itself. And whatever his feelings, Winshluss definitely knows his material well.\n\nWinshluss particularly emphasises the ugly side of his art style for this book. His characters are deformed, grotesque and often filthy looking, and his colours muddy, all in service of the unflattering portrait he has created. He does not vary his art style as much as he did in the patchwork that was Pinocchio, but there is still a lot of variety here - pastiches of romance and superhero comics, vintage advertising and apocalyptic paintings, as well as a more straightforward approach to humour strips.\n\nHis recurring characters are easily identifiable, from one-eyed God to the burly Jesus, and Mary, whose genuine beauty stands out most starkly in the comic's dark landscape. Beneath them, humanity blurs together in a heaving mass.\n\nIn God We Trust is a hard read, at turns hilarious and horrifying. At times, Winshluss's rage at the things people do to themselves and others can feel overwhelming. His humour is frequently on the nose, and if it doesn't seek to offend it certainly isn't afraid to. However, people who find themselves uncomfortable with many of the ideas and realities of organised religion are likely to find much that resonates.\n\nIf you've ever raged at the Catholic Church's part in the African AIDS crisis or the attitudes of 'born again' Christians, or wondered whether Superman could beat God in a fight and what on earth the parable of the Prodigal Son is supposed to be about, you'll find something to identify with here."
