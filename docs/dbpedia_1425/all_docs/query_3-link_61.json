        "meta_description": "Kicking off 2005 in full-on DnB style with a monologue from Armando Iannucci’s Time Trumpet radio series, a not entirely serious look at music through the ages, which glues this set together. Steaming in with Pendulum’s remix of Concord Dawn’s ‘Tonite’ we’re into 170bpm dance floor destruction straight away and it rarely lets up. I loved Pendulum early on, before and around the first album, I felt they really revitalised DnB for a while after years of it going down a dark, minimal 2-step path which sounded like music for ketamine and a good kicking rather than the euphoric party it had been just a few years before. The Good Looking stable and its ilk were too soft for me back then although I’ve reappraised that since, mellowing with age and all. Back then I wanted my DnB hard and fast, with intricate drum programming and stomping basslines and Pendulum bought all that back with a twist and a swing only previously heard in the Brazilian styles of DJ Marky and Shy FX & T-Power. Of course it all went horribly wrong once they became a stadium band and started using guitars but for a few years there were some great singles and remixes.  There were a spate a white label DnB reworkings of RnB/Pop hits for a good while too in the mid 00s, post-bastard pop where hip hop and soul met in the charts and then got a good rinse out on the ...Read more…",

        "text": "The missing #172 upload (no, I didn’t notice either until a couple of weeks later). This is one of the tapes my ex-wife had squirrelled away that she wanted digitised and it’s one I didn’t have a copy of, a short set drifting from jazz to hip hop to funk and pop. The set starts with a classic Solid Steel jingle, ‘The Ninth World’ read, I think, by Matt Black’s dad.\n\nAround the mid-late 90s the Ninja crew were regularly DJing across Europe and thus had access to piles of ECM jazz at cheap prices and bassist Barre Philips was a particular favourite of mine along with Jon Abercrombie and Eberhard Weber. Stanley Clarke’s ‘Concerto for Jazz / Rock Orchestra’ was on my radar as I was so into the sample at the end of DJ Shadow’s In/Flux on the Headz 2 compilation that I had to track it down. I ran upon a copy of his Journey To Love LP in the now closed Discovel (sp?) record shop in Montreal – you’ll know the part when you hear it. Echoes was an alias of my old friend Bundy K. Brown, ex of Tortoise and a future collaborator at this point in time, ‘Continental Drift’ was new back when this was recorded and was apparently very influential on a young Kieran Hebden aka Four Tet. Bundy worked in the Chicago record store Dusty Groove and was a little more keyed into what was happening on the electronic music scene than the other members of the band and made several sample-heavy beats and jazz-infused tracks and remixes around this time which caught my ear.\n\nThere’s an identified track at the end of the Echoes single, a distorted drum thing for a minute or so but I can’t identify it. KRS-One’s ‘Step Into A World’ was also new around 1997, transposing ‘The Champ’ into a new form alongside Blondie’s ‘Rapture’ which is why the Mohawks original comes next. Part 2’s ‘Automatic’ and ‘Prelude To Cycle 6’ were both taken from his sole EP for Jazz Fudge which was also current and one of the series of sleeves I put together for the label. The Human League’s ‘Being Boiled’ slots between them and needs no introduction, not sure why I felt the need to feature it here though. Water Melon’s cover of Fleetwood Mac’s ‘Albatross’ is something you wouldn’t immediately equate with the Japanese group but it totally works and is just one of the treasures to be found of the Pussyfoot label’s ‘Fish Smell Like Cat’ compilation album.\n\nTrack list:\n\nBarre Phillips – Mountain Scape\n\nStanley Clarke – Concerto For Jazz / Rock Orchestra\n\nEchoes – Continental Drift\n\nKRS One – Step Into A World (Rapture’s Delight)\n\nThe Mohawks – Champ\n\nPart 2 – Automatic\n\nThe Human League – Being Boiled\n\nPart 2 – Prelude To Cycle 6\n\nWater Melon – Albatross\n\nA mix of two halves, broadcast 21 years ago with a rap-heavy first half and a Xmas-themed second. LCD’s second single was a short, sharp shock of a 7” after the extended epics of their debut 12” and proved they weren’t a one-hit wonder. I saw them play it that year at the Supersonic festival in Birmingham and met James and Nancy backstage, before they went stratospheric. I remember dropping Un-cut’s ‘Midnight’ at the appropriate hour on New Year’s Eve in Newcastle that year, paired with the Gift of Gab monologue during his mix of DJ Shadow’s ‘Midnight In A Perfect World’ and the place going off. The Christina Aguilera Drum n Bass mix was so rough and ready it would pummel any naysayers into submission (same with Beyoncé and Britney mixes of the same era). Any decent pop song of the age would get a white label DnB makeover by someone for a few years in the early 00’s, it may well be the same now but I don’t check for them. Most were sold in specialist shops around London with no info other than a title and I’ve still no idea who made this one. Into the hip hop now with Notts’ finest The P Brothers from their Heavy Bronx Experience series #4 featuring Eddie Cheeba and Sadat X from over the pond – hard as nails golden era styles made in the UK.\n\nPerverted Monks were a collective associated with Afu-Ra and Jeru The Damaga but never quite hit their heights. The imaginatively-titled ‘Freestyle’, from their third single uses the backing tracks from Nas’ ’Nothin’ and another I forget as a bed, one of a number of those Bollywood-sampling hip hop tracks from around this time, kicked off by Missy’s ‘Get UR Freak On’. Soulwax makeover DJ Shadow’s ‘6 Days’ with a blatant re-edit of the B-52’s ’52 Girls’ and it just works. This was during the height of the mash up craze and they were riding high on the success of their ‘As Heard on Radio Soulwax 2’ compilation. It only appeared on a promo 12” and I’d bet it was a European A&R decision to get them to remix Shadow as it doesn’t fit into anything he was doing at that stage. Punjabi MC’s tune was huge in the UK with it’s jingling hook and Knight Rider bass line, as ubiquitous as Missy’s the year before, getting reworks all over the place in a multitude of styles. The Old School mix was by a duo billed as Banks and Sullivan who seem to have a number of aliases with one release to their name on Discogs. A mystery white label using the a cappella from ‘OK’ by RnB pop band Big Brovaz over ‘Mundian To Bach Ke’ was something I used to play a lot in sets and may or may not have been legal. Dan The Automator revisits his own production again for a third rework of ‘Bear Witness’ from the Dr Octagon album with Q Bert back on cuts before Edan smokes the party with his own ‘MC’s Smoke Crack’ remix. Pitman lightens the mood with his Rob Base & DJ E-Z Rock pastiche and the Polyphonic Spree arrive to prepare us for the Christmas section of the mix.\n\nIt’s fair to say that my Xmas mixes maybe aren’t the kind of thing you’d want to put on in the background as you unwrap your presents or tuck into dinner, they swerve all over the place like a Santa who’s had too many brandy’s. Or indeed the manic Ella Fitzgerald version of ‘Jingle Bells’ I try to valiantly keep in time over Tino’s ‘Christmas Is Here’. I wanted to include ‘Coldcut’s Christmas Break’ but it’s generally so terrible I could only manage a few minutes (sorry Matt and Jon but we’ve had this conversation). But how easy is it to make a credible Xmas record? I’d say very difficult and the ones I can happily hear on any given day of the year let alone during the Yuletide period would fit in a very small stocking. The Treacherous 3’s effort occupies a special place because of its inclusion in the Beat Street film and their beat box gag with a young Doug E. Fresh at the end. Milly & Silly’s 1973 ‘Getting Down For Xmas’ is from the Christmas Groove compilation and the mix of Bubba Sparxx’s ‘Ugly’ and Wings’ ‘Wonderful Christmastime’ weirdly works somehow. This was no doubt downloaded from the web amid the whole mash up craze of the time, hence no credit and the inclusion of snippets of early Cassetteboy from their Festive Christmas CD around the mix. The mood takes a darker turn with Hell Interface (aka Boards of Canada) and their ‘Soylent Night’ from the V/Vm Whine & Missing Toe CD until Tino rides back in to save the day with an ethereal jingle groove. Sirconical is usually known for huge, crashing beats but his take on ‘Silent Night’ is genuinely beautiful and comes from the Twisted Nerve Christmas Stocking Filler 7”.\n\nOK, that’s it for this year, have a good one, see you on the other side as I take a break for a week and come back with more 90’s cassette encodings in 2024. Thanks to all subscribers new and old, especially those who have hung in there for the whole hog, I think I can see the end in sight finally as the CDr folder is nearly done, the DAT box is dry and the cassette drawers are nearing completion – I reckon the mix archive could be completed next year. Although there is that USB from Paul Johnson still to go through…\n\nTrack list:\n\nLCD Soundsystem – Give It Up\n\nUn-cut – Midnight (MIST 2003 mix)\n\nChristina Aguilera – Dirrty (D&B mix)\n\nThe P Brothers – Come On Down\n\nPerverted Monks – Freestyle\n\nDJ Shadow – 6 Days (Soulwax mix)\n\nPunjabi MC – Mundian To Bach Ke (Oldskool mix)\n\nBig Brovaz – OK (Punjabi Rmx)\n\nDan the Automator – Bear Witness III (Once Again)\n\nEdan – MCs Smoke Crack (remix)\n\nPitman – It Takes Tea\n\nThe Polyphonic Spree – Soldier Girl (Orchestral)\n\nTino – Christmas Is Here\n\nElla Fitzgerald – Jingle Bells\n\nColdcut – Coldcuts’ Christmas Break (edit)\n\nTreacherous 3 feat.

I also just noticed that I missed MS172 – which is all ready to go but will have to wait until next year as I have a Xmas mix for next week.\n\nI’m not sure why this is called a ‘Tour Mix’, it’s not a live set for sure but I could have conceivably made it on the laptop on tour – maybe I was out with DK promoting our ’Now, Listen Again’ mix CD, I’d have to check dates. Anyway – Zero db tackle Sun Ra for the opening and I think this only came out on their own Reconstruction compilation of remixes rather than on any official Sun Ra release. John Cale then trades places with James Murphy for his LCD Soundsystem cover, which sounds a bit strained and painful in hindsight now. Next up is the first of three Mr76ix tracks from his 3 (Minority of 1) album on Skam with a magnificent tempo switch down into Def Tex’s ‘Bomber’ – what a bassline! Def Tex were great, always inventive hip hop and this was from their second album on Son Records.\n\nBattles seemed to explode out of nowhere but they’d already made three singles before signing to the label and ‘Race:In’ came from their debut LP, Mirrored. Kidkanevil’s ‘5th Gear’ features Latyrx’s Lateef The Truthspeaker in a horny flute ode to getting down to it with a subtlety rarely present in rap. But here’s another with Pharaoh Monch expertly remixed by Optima Espacio into some sort of slow build electro gospel banger. There’s a guitar solo over a breakdown FFS! Keeping on the love-tip; an overlooked DJ Shadow B side from his Outsider album era sees him mining a psych funk angle on ‘Love, Love’. This was only on the CD single and later download of the ‘This Time’ single, no idea why it didn’t make the album and the non-LP cuts and remixes were frequently better than some of the material on that record IMO.\n\nOh Pepe Deluxe, how I loved (and still do love) their Spare Time Machine album, two tracks here sum it up – tightly constructed, immaculately produced sunshine psychedelia. They really string out the intro to ‘Apple Thief’ but when it kicks in it’s well worth the wait. ‘Go For Blue’ also inspired a colour-based mix of songs shortly after this including ‘Purple Rain’, ‘Mellow Yellow’ and ‘Mr Blue Sky’ but that’s already on the web. I’m wondering where I heard Candie Payne’s track from as I don’t remember buying it, maybe a promo or a compilation – whatever, she’s got that 60s doom pop sound nailed. Mr76ix sounds like he’s been listening to the last track on Selected Ambient Works II and put some rave beats to it and Battles are back again with the epic ‘Atlas’ – remember that great video of them in the mirrored box? Mr76ix plays out over the breakdown of this with a beautiful beat-less piece called ‘Romanticism’ before we’re back into that drawn out guitar trade off that builds into the final section.\n\nTrack list:\n\nSun Ra – Satellites Are Spinning (Zero db remix)\n\nLCD Soundsystem – All My Friends (John Cale version)\n\nMr76ix – H.A.A.R.P.\n\nDef Tex – Bomber\n\nBattles – Race:In\n\nKidkanevil – 5th Gear feat. Lateef The Truthspeaker\n\nPharoah Monch – Body Baby (Optimo Espacio mix)\n\nDJ Shadow – Love, Love\n\nPepe Deluxe – Apple Thief\n\nPepe Deluxe – Go For Blue\n\nCandie Payne – I Wish I Could Have Loved You More\n\nMr76ix – Spirit of Man\n\nBattles – Atlas\n\nMr76ix – Romanticism\n\nNineteen years ago today this show aired on Solid Steel and served as a round up of a current crop of music that had come my way over the previous months. There’s a large rap quota in this hour-long set, mostly from the independent sector and what you could call ‘backpack rap’ (although I wouldn’t). A particularly trippy Solid Steel jingle opens the show by Pedro Chamorra and I have no idea who Levi is/was or where the track featuring BC and Saul Williams came from, nothing’s coming up on Discogs. Diplo’s ‘Big Lost’ is from his debut Florida LP and is still a classic, DK and I were such a fan of this record and props to Big Dada for spotting his talent early on. Not sure if the northern chaps chatting about record collecting over the top are Mark and Lard from 6 Music (or were they on XFM back then?). Natural Self was putting out 45s in the early 00’s on Tru Thoughts and here remixes The Limp Twins (Will ‘Quantic’ Holland and Russell Porter) from the Shapes Yellow TT comp. More Brighton-based music next from the Catskills label with a track from Infinite Potential’s debut 12”, As The Record Revolves – some very tight scratching on that.\n\nThe Perceptionists were a US group including Mr Lif and Akrobatik and ’Medical Aid’ was one half of a split debut 12” with another group, 4th Pyramid on Definitive Jux. Mark Rae’s ‘Reach Out To Me’ was from his third album, Into The Depths, with vocals by Veba – should have been a big hit. Busdriver’s first album for Big Dada contained the ‘Kev’s Blistering Computer…’ track and I just found out that he did a third for the label in 2014 that completely passed me by somehow. I loved Busdriver most of all of that Mush crowd, full of personality and an incredible flow, love how the DJ D-Styles cuts up the little blip noise from Herbie Hancock’s ‘Rockit’ for the chorus here too. In the liner notes Busdriver is credited with ‘Vocal Tension & Lyrical Release’, D-Styles with ’Turntable Blasphemy’ and producer Daddy Kev with ‘Strange Rhythmic Noise’. Diverse with Vast Aire came from the Chocolate Industries label as they moved into hip hop territory, with production by RJD2, another artist – like Diplo – who was adjacent to DJ Shadow in the production stakes around this time.\n\nBack over to the UK for Bristol’s Hundred Strong which was the brainchild of Ben from the Purple Penguin record shop, always a destination when we hit the city in the 90s. I used to get sent M.Craft promos in the 00s and I always REALLY loved a couple of tracks on them, I really should investigate his back catalogue a bit more, seems this was from his debut single on 679 Recordings. I don’t recall this Massive Attack song at all, it sounds more like a Barry Adamson take on The Man With The Golden Gun than the band’s usual material. Seems it was from a soundtrack they did to a film called Danny The Dog which can be had extremely cheaply on Discogs although it looks like it was done by 3D alone without Daddy G from the credits.\n\nQuannum released a double A-sided single for their US tour in 2004 and this is the Shadow-produced cut, all drum machines and synths rather than samples and points the way to his work later on. Blade’s ‘Scream’ came from his ‘Pop Idol’ single and is that Mr Thing on the cuts? DFA’s Juan MacLean work over Air in fine electro ‘drug chug’ style before the term was even coined. Sounds like I was caning outer space samples from Megatrip’s Soundbank CDs over the top too. 4 Hero go all Beatles-y with the mellotron on their remix of Chunking’s ‘Making Music’ (another Brighton band!) and then it’s back to the Anitcon crew with Sixtoo from his Ninja Tune 10” ‘BodyAche Summer’ EP – yet another producer up there with Shadow but moving in his own directions. In between this and Max & Harvey’s ‘Untitled Dialogue’ (another 10” on Ninja) I use a piece of speech about seeing sound that I would later fashion into a track on my Search Engine album. One half of Max & Harvey (named after the duo’s dogs I think I was once told) was Paul Frankland aka Woob and also Journeyman – they only released one single on Ninja but all their other releases are available on their Bandcamp and are excellent.\n\nhttps://maxandharvey.bandcamp.com/music\n\nTrack list:\n\nPedro Chamorra – Solid Steel intro\n\nLevi feat.

I’d just discovered Mr. Bungle’s amazing ‘California’ album via old school friend Steven Baker (RIP) and still hold it in high regard as their masterwork to this day – I seriously recommend it as an example of incredible song writing collage and masterful playing, I mean come on, Dave Lombardo plays drums and a song called ‘None of them knew they were robots’ has to be good, right?. Not being a Streets fan I used the instrumental, non-Mike Skinner vocal version of Grafiti vs The Bug’s only single and filled in some of the vocals with spoken word snippets from Megatrip’s aforementioned Soundbank collection. I’d only just discovered Akufen’s My Way LP from the previous year and absolutely caned it around this time, still a peerless release that will forever be associated with painting a picture for my Dad’s 60th birthday where I listened to it on repeat.\n\nAmalgamation of Sounds, always good value, LFO’s ‘Freak’ absolutely killer tune, RIP Mark Bell, caned that Five Deez ‘Funky’ a cappella for years over all sorts of tracks in clubs with DK. Hey, this mix is pretty slamming now, oh here comes DJ Zinc with Dynamite MC to tear the roof off with ‘People 4’, one of his most creative tunes of the era, a beats/rap match made in heaven. Big tempo switch up and then Reprazent homies Krust and Die cut in with a further switch up from 33 to 45rpm – this section is reminiscent of my club sets at the time, fast-moving shifts through different styles and we’re into the Nextmen and Cyantific’s computer game-flavoured ‘High Scores’ before sliding into another DnB cut that Spotify tells me is ‘Future Sonic’ by Tele Music but I have no memory of. Dipping out of the club and back into radio land with another Mr Bungle cut, ‘The Air Conditioned Nightmare’. This is another example of the band’s seamless collage style, mixing examples of different artists and musical styles into one song and making it work. I swear I once heard a live set from them where they sounded like they were tuning through a radio dial and switching music styles every few bars.\n\nThe mix into Jackson’s ‘Utopia’ isn’t too smooth but this track is similar to Akufen’s in that it takes tiny snatches of voice and re-edits them into a patchwork melody, the female vocal was a recording of his mother apparently and this was played from the original French release before he got picked up by Warp. I really should have taken it out of the mix faster rather than leave it under the Matthew Herbert Big Band, it’s painful. I loved this record (Goodbye Swingtime) and Matt’s move away from his earlier experiments for a full live band experience. Seeing them at The Big Chill one year blew me away – always inspirational. Four Tet needs no introduction of course but back in 2003 he was still building his rep with this single from his third album, Rounds. Next up, the Returner is a lesser-used alias of Mark Pritchard, creating a fine DJ tool in his ‘Throwdown No.1’ of which I proceed to cut up two copies before editing into Loon’s Schoolly D-quoting, Kelis-featuring ‘How Do You Want That’. This was a Neptunes-esque production despite not being by them and shows how much they’d influenced contemporary hip hop by this point. We finish up with Schoolly’s classic ‘Saturday Night’ because, why not? Live two copy cut ups from DJ Code Money, you can even hear the records jump and wobble in places, pure hip hop and swearing on record way before NWA made it hip. I think the final spoken word coda may have been from John Cage although it sounds like someone impersonating him rather than his actual voice.\n\nTrack list:\n\nPinnochio – Clock Sequence\n\nJohn Book – eBay Trauma Centre\n\nMr Bungle – None of Them Knew They Were Robots\n\nGrafiti vs The Bug – What IS The Problem?\n\nAkufen – Late Night Munchies\n\nAmalgamation of Sounds – Sharm\n\nLFO – Freak\n\nFive Deez – Funky (a cappella)\n\nDJ Zinc feat.

It’s also a very short tape as the whole mix is only 30 minutes long and that’s both sides! The Outer Limits (and later, Alexei Sayle) both hail from the original Comic Strip Presents album, recorded live at the Comedy Store before The Young Ones TV show propelled them all to fame. The Average White Band’s ‘Work To Do’ used to be on our answerphone, partly in jest that I used to work all hours and Sister Goose & The Ducklings ‘Super Shine #9’ is from the Gordon’s War OST. Marc Moulin was a new passion around this time due to a dodgy boot ‘reissue’ of his Sam’ Suffy album and the (re)discovery of his band, Placebo. You’ll notice a high quota of French artists on this tape as my ex is a huge Francophile and I wanted to showcase a few bits for her. Yusef Lateef is from his excellent Gentle Giant LP and the Gainsbourg cut was probably from some dodgy bootleg compilation as there were many floating round at the time.\n\nDimitri From Paris opens the B side with a fake trailer from the La Yellow 357 compilation on Yellow Productions. DJ Cam’s track is from his debut LP, Underground Vibes which is followed by the exceedingly un-French ‘Detttwork SouthEast’ by Black Twang, a perfect encapsulation of the South London vibe on vinyl. Blackanized 360 never really get remembered but this Edinburgh duo had some tunes back in the day when Acid Jazz was turning into Trip Hop and ‘Vibe’brations is from their debut 12” – ironically sampling the same source as an early Blackalicious 12” – it can be had for pennies on Discogs. The Herbaliser up next with their second single from their forthcoming second album, Blow Your Headphones, featuring What What and an oddity to close with Steady B’s ‘Rocking Music’. This is really a DJ track, sans Steady but featuring his DJ, Tat Money, and bears similarities to Jazzy Jeff’s ‘A Touch Of Jazz’ before the tape runs out.\n\nTrack list:\n\nThe Outer Limits – Lenny Flowers\n\nAverage White Band – Work To Do\n\nSister Goose & The Ducklings – Super Shine #9\n\nMarc Moulin – Humpty Dumpty\n\nYussef Lateef – Jungle Plum\n\nSerge Gainsbourg – Meurtre á l’extincteur\n\nAlexei Sayle – Break\n\nDimitri From Paris – Bande Announce (The Trailer)\n\nDJ Cam – Dieu Reconnaitra Les Siens\n\nBlak Twang – Dettwork SouthEast\n\nBlacka’nized 360 – Vibe,brations\n\nThe Herbaliser – New & Improved feat. What What\n\nSteady B – Rockin’ Music\n\nMore hoovering up the recent crop of promos and new finds in the second Bits & Bobs show of 2007 (not too great with the titles there but I was juggling 20 month old twins at the time).\n\nStarting concurrently, the Emperor Machine remix of White Line Circus makes an excellent bed for Break Reform’s ‘Cut A Map In The Soles of my Feet’ even if I say so myself. Both killer tunes in their own right and I seem to remember that the La Boca sleeve design for ‘Rocket Ride’ is one of their best of the era when they were designers for DC Recordings and the label bearly put a foot wrong for a few years. The Bamboos, still going strong on Tru Thoughts, this time with Ohmega Watts paraphrasing Double Trouble’s ‘At the Amphitheatre’ rap from Wild Style. Skipping a couple of tracks I had completely forgotten that Lost Idol made stuff with heavy beats like this, always one to watch for, glad I was hip to his stuff in 2007. Kids In Tracksuits featured a certain Matt Cutler who most will now know as Lone and I think this track comes from their ‘Get Your Kit On’ EP.\n\nThe RamaSutra track is a bit of a tune, seems it was one of the last things he put out in 2003, not sure how I was playing it in 2007. Bit of a sharp cut into !!!’s ‘Myth Takes’ and then into AmmonContact’s ’Drum Riders’ from their album on Ninja at the time, Cut Chemist on the cuts. DJ Dren’s ‘Wot Da Hell’ is from the excellent ‘CTRL C / CTRL V’ comp from 33 Throwdown Recordings, must dig that out again as it has all sorts of cut up goodness on it. Remix heat from Cherrystones for Pedro and more Emperor Machine, this time on his own track but again with a female vocal over it from another track, I seemed to have a thing for this at the time. The song in question is Stephanie Dosen’s cover of ‘Within Without You’ which doesn’t quite work tuning-wise and certainly should have been mixed out by the time The Dragons’ ‘Peace Garden’ arrives in the mix. We were on the cusp of releasing their unissued debut album on Ninja at the time and this track comes from a soundtrack, ‘A Sea For Yourself’.\n\nUp next, an unidentified vocal talking about originality before an Eno track from the second compilation of Curiosities, a pair of collections put together by one of Eno’s studio assistants at the time I believe from selections of the vast catalogue of unreleased material he had. Having been absorbed in Eno’s Lighthouse station on Sonos for most of this and last year – a constant stream of over 400 previously unreleased tracks from his archive – I can see what prompted these CDs. They were meant to be a series but only two were ever released, maybe they didn’t sell or maybe the compiler moved on? Friction = Fire’s Dunmore East was the last track on an Irish compilation on the Alphabet Set label which I must have been given when I performed one of the Head soundtrack gigs over there and Peter Wyngarde’s short outro comes from the actor’s very odd solo album to round things up.\n\nTrack list:\n\nWhite Line Circus – Rocket Ride (Emperor Machine remix)\n\nBreak Reform – Cut A Map In The Soles Of My Feet\n\nThe Bamboos feat. Ohmega Watts – Get In The Scene\n\nYoko Ono w. Shitake Monkey – O’ Oh\n\nNatalie Walker – No One Else\n\nLost Idol – We Can Find Love\n\nKids In Tracksuits – Real Axe\n\nRegal – Capt.

Promos were starting to come in digital form as it was quicker and cheaper to produce CDrs with paper inserts in plastic wallets than mail out 12”s after weeks(!) away at the pressing plant. I think streaming and digital promos were maybe just starting around this time too but the music industry was still in freefall from digital downloading and any costs that could be cut would be. Dublin’s Kormac kicks off the show this week before we’re quickly into ‘The Riddle’, produced by The Sugarman and voiced by Harry Dean Stanton. This came to me via a promo CD and the group were apparently a trio of reclusive South Londoners who self-released this single (with remixes from Ashley Beedle and more) and an album which was possibly promo only. I’m not sure if the vocal is sampled from anywhere but that’s quite a cameo for a debut single if not. DJ Pandaj hails from Italy according to discos and Mirrorsystem was an offshoot of Steve Hillage and Miquette Giraudy’s System 7 project for the more ambient side as their main group became more techno-orientated. They cover Jam & Spoon’s ‘Stella’ to fine effect before The Bamboos’ try their hand at Max Segdley’s ‘Happy’. And is that Matt Berry talking about Fairlight samplers before it kicks in?\n\n!!! (aka Chk Chk Chk)’s ‘Yadnus’ is still such a tune, love that swinging glam beat on anything. DJ Kentaro featuring Spank Rock from his debut Ninja Tune LP next and you’ve never felt smaller as a DJ than when you have to step up to play after him in front of a home crowd in Tokyo, truly humbling. Tiga’s ‘You Gonna Want Me’ takes inspiration from Altern8’s ‘Infiltrate 202’ which in turn sampled Candi Staton’s ‘I Know’ vocal (amongst other things) and this version is the Van She remix. Deekline & Wizard’s collaboration with SOTO on Ghetto Blast Ya uses the metronome tick as a percussion device and I think I must have played the radio mix of Tim Deluxe’s ‘Let The Beats Roll’ here as I remember a much longer intro on this than here. l played this to death in the clubs for a while back in the day, there’s a great dub version too if you’re not into the vocal.\n\nThe Chris Carter feat. Fine Cut Bodies track is almost speed garage and I’d forgotten that Mark Spiler tune, how crazed, not sure what time signature that’s in. Pendulum’s ‘Blood Sugar’, this came out between their first and second albums and was kind of where I checked out as the next record upped the guitar quota and left me a bit cold. Fracture and Neptune were (are) always good value and were spearheading a kind of return to Photek-era DnB in the 00’s. Can you tell the DJ Fresh mix of DJ Shadow is off vinyl? I had to turn it up on the file here as the drop from the previous track was like a cliff face – such a killer club track but that abrupt ending was always difficult to get out from. Fracture & Neptune are back to play us out with a big Steve Miller Band sample on ‘Ventura’ and there’s a random drugs spoken word collage to finish. Back for part 2 next week…\n\nTrack list:\n\nKormac – Mr Heidi Hi (intro)\n\nThe Sugarman – The Riddle\n\nDJ Pandaj – The Lazy Trip Project\n\nMirrorsysytem – Stella (Duende mix)\n\nBamboos – Happy\n\n!!! – Yadnus\n\nDJ Kentaro – Space Jungle\n\nTiga – You Gonna Want Me (Van She remix)\n\nDeekline & Wizard vs SOTO – Ghetto Blast Ya (VIP)\n\nTim Deluxe – Let The Beats Roll\n\nChris Carter feat.

It’s strange mix of skanking batucada with theremin top line mixed with circus clowns and children cheering (yes, really). Totally unhinged and unlike anything else, I once found five copies in a bargain bin for £1 each and proceeded to give them to anyone who would take one. Here’s his follow up, under another of his many aliases – ‘Safari-Hari’ – an equally audacious romp through the jungle if less on the crazed side but beautifully packaged in a cardboard shopping bag as part of the Onze Sports double 7”.\n\nMr Melvis – ‘A Walk Through The Powerhouse’ was featured on a 2xCD compilation of “Strange and unusual music from the Exotica Mailing List” put together by my friend Otis Fodder on his Comfort Stand label. Otis and I had met online when he started the 365 Days Project in 2003, posting a weird and wonderful track or album every day via the WFMU website. This was a great resource in the early days of file-sharing on the web and the whole project is a wonderland of treasures. Otis was a resident in Montreal at the time (or was it Toronto?) and we later met up a few times when I toured over there, bonding over our love for strange music from the margins. Despite saying ‘never again’ once the year was up, he repeated the feat through 2007 and both are still archived online. http://wfmu.org/365/\n\nAnyway, Mr Melvis is covering a favourite, Raymond Scott’s ‘Powerhouse’ before we subtly shift into a deep house masterpiece of a remix by Charles Webster that totally captivated me when I heard it. Doing away with all but a single phrase from Martina Topley-Bird’s ‘Soul Food’ Webster grooves on a cappella cooing and deep bass pads and I could listen to this all day, I wouldn’t call myself a deep house fan but this could covert me. M*A*R*Y was a Richard X alias, this track was the sole release on a split 7” single with Liquitex until 2022 when an archive album appeared called High Noise Cassette – no doubt the product of lockdown hard drive excavation like so many of us. The Emperor Machine was a no brainer for me as soon as I heard Andrew Meecham’s analogue radiophonic stylings and this was the beginning of a golden run of releases on the DC label through the 00’s. NSM I don’t remember much about but it was short for New Sector Movements, IG Culture’s loose collective of broken beat collaborators.\n\nI don’t remember this DJ Zinc boot of ‘Milkshake’ either, no idea where I got that, dodgy offbeat mix by me there too, sloppy. Coldcut remix the Dr Who theme, this was another that came and went with little fanfare although there’s plenty of work in there transforming it into a half time dub with female vocal replacing the main melody. In fact I can’t find any info about it on Discogs so I’m wondering if it even came out? I asked Jon More and he confirmed that the Beeb shelved it, to quote the Guardian: “The best series of songs inspired by Dr Who is annoyingly locked away in a record company vault. In 2004 the BBC planned an album called Resistance Is Futile: Doctor Who Remixed, which was to feature St Etienne (who finished recording There There My Brigadier), 808 State (The Master’s theme), The Orb and Coldcut. But production delays had it jostling with the launch of the revamped TV series and it was scrapped.” I’ve spun the infamous outtake of Tom Baker in the vocal booth over the beginning which was a popular meme doing the rounds in the early days of file downloading. LCD Soundsystem’s amazing ‘Yeah’ still sounds utterly relevant and exciting and I’m thinking I must have compiled some of this mix using my old Numark CDJ as the pitch shift up and subsequent phase FX into the DJ Zinc track after bear all it’s hallmarks. Bit of Kylie over the top there before the switch and that’s quite a tempo increase, hold tight! ‘Next Tuesday’ was from Zinc’s Faster album, a decent attempt to make a well rounded dance album covering all styles rather than just club bangers.\n\nAaaah, Sixtoo and Damo Suzuki – what a track, what a beat, could listen to this all day, was so proud to have had a hand in bringing Rob to Ninja Tune back in the day, wasn’t for everyone but it floated my boat. This is a really random selection, we go through the heavy Krautrock-isms of Sixtoo to dark electronic rap via the Shadow Huntaz and then acoustic pop from Air. P-Love’s ‘Clausland Man Rd’ from his time on Bully Records (with my dodgy scratching over the top) into Ricci Rucker’s ‘New Dirt’, always interesting on the scratch/beat tip – rounding out a truly eclectic selection of contemporary tracks of the day.\n\nListening back to this (and a lot of the mixes in this archive) I’m reminded how much music soundtracks our lives and how I’m not currently soundtracking the present day by recording shows of current music and digging finds. I guess I didn’t expect to be listening back to these mixes nearly 20 years later and getting so nostalgic for the eras they evoke. Maybe when this is over I’ll start something new but it’s a big commitment and I’m not sure I could do it every week anymore. Maybe a new kind of show, I don’t know, what kind of music-related show would you tune in to?\n\nTrack list:\n\nDigital Onze – Safari-Hari\n\nMr Melvis – A Walk Through The Powerhouse\n\nMartina Topley-Bird – Soul Food (Charles Webster’s Bangin’ House Dub)\n\nM*A*R*Y – 73 Club\n\nThe Emperor Machine – Expanding in Reproduction\n\nNSM – Trying Times\n\nKelis – Milkshake (DJ Zinc remix)\n\nDelia Derbyshire – Dr Whooligan (Coldcut remix)\n\nLCD Soundsystem – Yeah (Stupid version)\n\nDJ Zinc – Next Tuesday\n\nSixtoo feat. Damo Suzuki – Storm Clouds and Silver Linings\n\nShadow Huntaz – Razbar\n\nAir – Cherry Blossom Girl\n\nP-Love – Clausland Mtn Rd\n\nRicci Rucker – New Dirt\n\nI’ve completely forgotten which show these were recorded for on 6 Music or why they needed two 16 minute mixes (if anyone remembers please drop a comment) but they’re on a disc with a private mix I did for my then wife in February of 2004. Parts of this resemble DJ sets of the day including the whole ‘Clapping Song’ routine with multiple copies on 7” that I’d switch between in quick succession. J Star who kicks things off did a series of white label reggae mash-ups at the time that were some of the best around, crazy to think people were actually pressing these bootlegs on vinyl but I suppose it’s no different to the multitude of 7” re-edits doing the rounds today. As the real Cure morphs into Kurtis Rush’s Missy Elliot/George Michael medley I thought I’d better double check if my memory was still correct as to who was behind the name. Yes, Kurtis was in fact Erol Alkan who made a trio of white label mixes around 2001/2002 and was also rumoured to be behind the Kylie/New Order blend that she premiered at the Brits that year.\n\nChuck Brown & The Soul Searches’ pre-Go Go classic ‘Ashley’s Roach Clip’ is immediately recognisable for the drums that Eric B & Rakim nicked for their ‘Paid In Full’ classic. I add in a Jungle Brothers acappella which really needed to be chased along with the wavering tempo. Coldcut of course remixed ‘Paid In Full’ into an even bigger classic and it’s their ‘instrumental’ of the mix under the title ‘Not Paid Enough’ that begins the second mix, with Martine Girault’s beautiful ‘Revival’ over the top which was enjoying a errrrm… revival at that time. Out of this is the Play School breakbeat monster ’Bang On A Drum’ that Coldcut sampled for the outro of their remix and then we get into some country and western hip hop comedy with Ricky V. Valentine who I’m still no wiser as to the identity of. This little skit appeared on a 12” on the C Side Trax label and Ricky was never heard of again. This Kid Named Miles’ cover of ‘Ring of Fire’ didn’t leave my DJ box for about five years I think, always a great end of nighter and Nicky Thomas’ version of ‘Soul Power’ pads out the end of the mix.\n\nTrack list:\n\nPts.1&2\n\nJ Star – No Diggity\n\nThe Meters – Hand Clapping Song\n\nShirley Ellis – The Clapping Song\n\nMalcolm & The Humphries Singers – The Clapping Song\n\nRay Russell – The Clapping Song\n\nPia Zadora – The Clapping Song\n\nThe Cure – Close To Me\n\nKurtis Rush – George Gets His Freak On\n\nChuck Brown & The Soul Searchers – Ashley’s Roach Clip\n\nThe Jungle Brothers – Jimbrowski (acappella)\n\nColdcut – Not Paid Enough\n\nMartine Girault – Revival\n\nPlay School – Bang On A Drum\n\nRicki V. Valentine – Ghetto Classics\n\nThis Kid Named Miles – Ring Of Fire\n\nNicky Thomas – Soul Power\n\nTony Morley was the guest this week – who had then just launched his Leaf label – still going strong all these years later and releasing great music too. We met through Chantal aka Mira Calix (RIP) who interned at 4AD where he was working at the time and DJ’d with him at Robin ‘Scanner’ Rimbaud’s Electronic Lounge at the ICA. We invited Tony to play at both Telepathic Fish and onto Solid Steel and later he and I would go on a possible midlife crisis pilgrimage to Dusseldorf together to see the old men of techno perform their Man Machine and Computer World albums but that’s another story. This mix is a weird one, the selection is all over the place and the mixing too, maybe I was too busy chatting and not concentrating much, consider this all about the selection rather than any mix skills.\n\nStarting as I ended a few weeks back with Jimi Tenor’s ‘Cafe Europe (live)’ (which Jon refers to as easy listening funk) there’s an oddity from a Flora Purim promo that was doing the rounds with remixes of her back catalogue – the best of which was the Guy Called Gerald one which is horribly out of tune with Jimi for a few bars at least. This clatters into a Doctor Rockit track from his Ready To Rockit EP on Clear, ‘Cameras & Rocks’, where this Matthew Herbert alias took his usual modus operandi of making tracks solely from sounds listed in the titles. After this is some unknown breakbeat track, possibly from the American New Breed label but I can’t place it and neither can Spotify but the Jaziacs & Snowboy tune after I had not heard in years and bought back many good memories. Hunt this 12” down (starting at 99p on Discogs) it’s a great snapshot of the acid jazz/trip hop crossover happening at the time which a huge dose of old school scratching over ‘Beat Street Strut’ on this track.\n\nPC used to do a great impression of the Doctor Rockit track next, the opener of the aforementioned Clear EP but I’m not sure what the big electronic interference is that suddenly appears, possibly a mixing desk mistake! Then the DnB is back with Luger, from guest Tony Morley’s Leaf label, this was the third release I believe. An odd trio of Keith LeBlanc tracks follow from his Global 2000 album under the name Spike (he’d dropped the ‘DJ’) which was CD only, unusual for me to play three in a row from the same artist. Jimi Tenor is back and then Bjork thunders in after what was most likely an advert break there – tune! Some un-ID’d DnB after – maybe more Droppin Science? and then another tune that I’d not heard in years. Gliderstate’s ‘Landscapes’ – what a beautiful piece of music – airy, melodic DnB with hints of jazz that still retains some weight via those pushing hi hats driving it along. More Clear business with the best title from the Greg Fleckner Quartet’s ‘A Gentle Intro To The GFQ’ 12” in ‘Oi, That’s My Bird’ but definitely not a good mix with Gliderstate, ouch. I’m not sure I even tried to mix Up, Bustle & Out’s ‘Ninja Principality’ out of this but it still sounds tough, Clandestine Ein could program them beats.\n\nTrack list:\n\nJimi Tenor – Cafe Europa (live)\n\nFlora Purim – What You See (Ghost of Flora’s Dream remix by A Guy Called Gerald)\n\nDoctor Rockit – Cameras & Rocks\n\nUnknown – Unknown\n\nJaziacs & Snowboy – Give It Up Me\n\nDoctor Rockit – Hello\n\nLuger – Pass Agent (Leaf)\n\nSpike – Change\n\nSpike – Story Of Violence\n\nSpike – The Mark\n\nJimi Tenor – Europa (Main Theme)\n\nBjork – Army Of Me\n\nUnknown – unknown\n\nGliderstate – Landscapes\n\nGreg Fleckner Quartet – Oi, That’s My Bird\n\nUp, Bustle & Out – Ninja’s Principality\n\nSummer 1995 was a busy time, Ninja Tune had released their first compilation, Ninja Cuts: Funkjazztical Tricknology in March which had bought in the first big flush of attention for the label and we were working on the Coldcut Journeys By DJ mix and the next DJ Food album, A Recipe For Disaster. We were still a few months away from the LP launch party at the Blue Note that would give birth to the infamous Stealth night but things were flowering for the label and its slowly expanding roster of artists like The Herbaliser, 9 Lazy 9, The London Funk Allstars, Up, Bustle & Out and Funki Porcini. Another label that was hitting a purple patch was Rising High who were diversifying out of the hardcore that had made their name with artists like Wagon Christ, Bedouin Ascent, Plug and Witchman. The opening track here is by Luke Vibert and comes from the label’s Further Self Evident Truths 2 compilation, a beautiful example of his Throbbing Pouch era trip hop and newly discovery love of drum n bass under his Plug alias.\n\nJoe Nation released a sole 12” on the Chill Out Label and the group consisted of a certain Jonathan Moore – note the spelling of the surname – not the Jonathan More of Coldcut but someone who would go on to play a crucial role in the Ninja Tune label for some years to come. I think I’ve written about Jonathan before, largely under his Voda alias, he occupied a small studio in the same building as Ninja Tune in the 90s and later moved up to occupy the whole of the top floor of the building. He mastered recordings for a living as well as occasionally making music and he was in high demand as both the label and others around the area grew. You can see his Voda label and credit on many Ninja and Ntone releases of the time. He worked as an engineer on Mixmaster Morris’ third album, Coldcut’s records and also engineered the collaboration Coldcut and I did with Grandmaster Flash. I really liked him and, as his empire grew, he eventually moved out and had a large studio up in Soho, mastering, editing and duplicating for all and sundry. The last job I remember doing with him was the remastering for the Cookie Monster/Pinball Number Count 12” that the label released as well as cutting a video for it at his place which would place it around 2003 I think. I looked him up and and he now lives in Bristol and runs a TV subtitling service, I hope he’s well.\n\nMore DnB with Danny Breaks from an early Droppin’ Science release, remixed by Origin Unknown, I was still working part time in Ambient Soho around this time and would grab these releases when they came in. Others I would grab were anything on the Pharma label out of Germany, usually on coloured vinyl and a mixture of downtempo acid and electro from the Air Liquide/Jammin’ Unit/Cem Oral/Khan collective with a million aliases. The two tracks here from Kerosene and Zulutronic were from the label’s first two releases and the label would be active for the next five years releasing a mixture of dubbed out acid beats and bleeps. Now, a slight diversion but bear with me, it is relevant to what comes next.\n\nA funny thing happened to me the other day as I was walking down the back streets of Peckham, looking at stickers on lamp posts and eyeing up a particularly decorated one that D’Face had stuck about ten different designs on. A man walking his dog passed by and suddenly asked if I was Kev? Yes, I replied, not sure if someone had played a trick on me and stuck a label on my back. Turns out he follows me on Instagram and had seen I lived locally, posted a lot of street art bits and also had a connection to Leicester. We got chatting and he revealed that not only did he come from there but also made music and that I had once reviewed one of his releases favourably for Muzik magazine in the 90’s. After more chat it transpired that he was one half of the Headphonauts – a group who released two singles in the mid 90s and then disappeared (as far as I knew) and that no one else I’ve ever talked to even remembers – how random is that!? Anyway, this opened the floodgates and it turns out Ali Gibbs (for it was he) moved to London and started making music solo under the name Nebraska, recording for various labels and running his own, Friends & Relations. We met up again a week or so later and he furnished me with a lovely pile of his back catalogue which included a release by Rex Mitsui, ‘Heddohõn Shõ Ryokõ’ which is the missing link between the Headphonauts’ work and his solo Nebraska releases. Thank you Ali, I now have closure not only on the NT album (read last week’s entry) but also of what happened to the Headphonauts, plus I made a new friend. Isn’t life weird sometimes?\n\nBack to the tunes, some upfront pressure from an unknown called DJ Food – taken from a 12” promo for a Ninja label showcase in Koln I think – mixes out of the aforementioned Headphonauts’ track ‘Adverse Pt.3’. We get a snatch of the Wagon Christ remix of Witchman’s ‘Red Demon Loco’ (not ‘Watchman’ as Matt Black reads later) and what I love about this is that Luke time-stretches the already slow beat to half time and then stretches it again to half of that, complete with all the sonic aberrations that the technology of the day gave the sound. This just leaves the gate open for a good run of Gescom’s electro-fied ‘Pulz’ from their 12” release on Clear, another sleeve that I helped assemble from a mass of tags Rob and Sean provided of local Manchester writers, like I said, it was a busy year.\n\nPS: For those wondering about the 4/11/95 date on the tape, it was about 10 minutes of As One, B12, Black Dog-esque tracks from another mix, nothing to write home about mix-wise so I’ve not included it. Back with more 1995 beats next week…\n\nTrack list:\n\nWagon Christ – Wet Leg\n\nJoe Nation – Zvona (45-8 Mix)\n\nDanny Breaks – Firin’ Line (Origin Unknown remix)\n\nKerosene – Nurse City\n\nZulutronic – Sodotronic\n\nHeadphonauts – Adverse Pt.3\n\nDJ Food – Spiral\n\nWitchman – Red Demon Loco (Wagon Christ remix)\n\nGescom – Pulz\n\nA very funk and beats-orientated set from 20 years ago starting with the Quantic Soul Orchestra featuring Alice Russell where I’m cutting the Melle Mel line, ‘Don’t push me’ from ‘The Message’ in and out. The Hieroglyphics consisted of Del Tha Funkee Homosapian, Souls of Mischief and more and ‘Let It Roll’ comes from their second album, ‘Full Circle’. The Good Dr Rubberfunk now lives in my hometown of Reigate weirdly and his Bossa For The Devil was always a favourite whilst DPF was on Ninja-affiliated hip hop label Son. DJ Revolution and Sinbad’s turntable face-off is genuinely hilarious in places as well as jaw-dropping technically, a turntablism track which invites multiple listens. In the wake of the ‘sexed-up’ Iraq dossier the country was on the march and unhappy about being dragged into a bogus war alongside the US. I took Color Me Badd’s ‘I Wanna Sex You Up’ and cut up a load of news footage over the top to tell the story, it’s an obvious idea but I’m still pleased with it.\n\nReturning to normality we get a version of ‘The Champ’ by the Skatalites, J Rocc cutting up breaks and then two P Brothers Heavy Bronx joints in succession. For me, The P Brothers perfectly channelled a specific period of 80s hip hop that I love and gave it an extra dose of grit. Never slavishly retro and using many UK MCs, the only others to do it so well were Edan and DJ Format. Pest’s gloriously wonky ‘Already Said’ is still one of those Ninja Tune oddities of the era and then we’re back for more J Rocc and a very slick breaks cut up by Cut Hustlers which may or may not have had something to do with DJ Razorcuts but I’m having trouble finding info on it. It features Statler and Waldorf – the two old men from the theatre box in The Muppets – which is why it leads into DJ Streetsahead’s brilliant 1987 remix of Was (Not Was) where they also feature and was the first time I heard the break from ‘Hot Wheels (The Chase)’ cut up.\n\nBooty Babes’ mash up of Britney over the Massive Attack-sampled ‘Mellow Mellow Right On’ by Lowell will be an ear worm for the rest of the week with 100 Strong’s sensual ‘Brain Busy’ complimenting its laid back vibe perfectly. I added samples and scratches about hitting and crying over the chorus to mirror the vocal, at one point tracking two different scratch patterns, one for each ear – I had more time back then, pre-kids. Aesop Rock’s ‘Freeze’ was a Blockhead-produced cut on Def Jux but then things take a bit of an odd turn with Backini’s electro swing ‘Company B-Boy’ which hasn’t dated too well. I do love that Andrews Sisters sample though, mainly because of its inclusion in Art of Noise’s ‘The Army Now’ but the whole thing goes on far too long. Luckily there’s the bizarre humour of Kid Koala awaiting us at the other end and the low end ‘Caravan’-sampling skank of Galaxian’s ‘Fresh’ to finish but the set drags at the end I felt, could have stopped around the 50 minute mark.\n\nTrack list:\n\nQuantic Soul Orchestra – Pushin’ On\n\nHieroglyphics – Let It Roll\n\nDr. Rubberfunk – Bossa for the Devil\n\nDPF – Yadda Yadda\n\nDJ Revolution feat. DJ Spinbad – Head to Head\n\nFlexus – I Wanna Flex U Up\n\nSkatalites – Champ\n\nJ Rocc – Play This (one)\n\nP Brothers – Ich Nichten Lickten Das Mark Evans\n\nP Brothers feat.

The former pairs ‘Come Together’ with Mary J Blige’s ‘Family Affair’ and the latter glitches up ‘Because’ and adds beats – two of the better examples around at the time when the internet was awash with such things. Incidentally I was just watching a video about AI mash ups and I think we may be on the cusp of the next iteration of the mash up although this time round they’ll be ‘original/unreleased’ tracks by artists no longer with us in every style conceivable. The Future Sound of London turn in a suitably Beatles-esque remix of Robert Miles, sounding more like their Amorphous Androgynous alias which isn’t surprising seeing as they had reactivated it in full psychedelic mode earlier in the year.\n\nAn at the time unreleased Sixtoo instrumental is up next with dialogue from a DJ Shadow interview about digging over the top as well as a snatch of Alvin Lucier’s ‘I Am Sitting In A Room’ – which prefigures its usage on my own Raiding The 20th Century mix some two years later. Suktekh’s ‘Privacy’ is a beautiful, brooding Rhodes piece from his ‘Fell’ LP and JG Thirlwell’s Manorexia alias is reactivated for the spooky ‘Canaries In The Mineshaft’. Boards of Canada’s ‘From One Source All Things Depend’ was a bonus track on the Japanese CD of Geogaddi and liberally samples children talking about God from a Tony Schwartz’s The Sound of Children LP. Food was/is a jazz group fronted by Iain Ballamy and ‘Freebonky’ is from their second album, Organic & GM Food which I have to admit that I down to for the gorgeous Dave McKean artwork. The William Burroughs dialogue comes courtesy of Steinski’s ‘Audio Collage 6’ which was on a Cdr of his work he’d given me when I visited him in New York. Finishing up is 80’s Baby, a vaguely horrible concept which seeks to recreate popular songs in a sickly-sweet twinkly lullaby style to play to your child at bedtime. Various different eras were covered and on the 80s edition was a version of Gary Numan’s ‘Cars’ which I thought I’d run the original under in the distance. George Carlin rants about cars and driving over the top just to ram the message home.\n\nTrack list:\n\nBad Production – Bad Production\n\nAvril plays The Beatles – Becoz\n\nRobert Miles – Paths (FSOL Comic Mix)\n\nSixtoo – Untitled\n\nSuktekh – Privacy\n\nManorexia – Canaries In The Mineshaft\n\nBoards of Canada – From One Source All Things Depend\n\nFood – Freebonky\n\nSteinski – Audio Collage 6\n\n80’s Baby – Cars\n\nGary Numan – Cars\n\nBack in 2004 when DK and I had our monthly Solid Steel night residency downstair at Ruby Lo in the west end we decided to put on a boat party for the end of summer. I think it was DK’s idea and he wanted to have a door price that included a free BBQ on entry which was to be served from the deck while people came on board. I won’t post the terrible flyer I made at the time but it did contain the line ‘All hands on decks’ which made me laugh. We co-opted our wives to help serve alongside James Mountain (Solid Steel DJ and Ninja employee at the time) and provided a load of burgers, hot dogs and salad for people our of our own pockets. DJs on the night were Dean Smith (on the top deck whilst food was served), James, Matt Black, PC, Harley Harl, DJ Yoda, Diplo (then still relatively unknown but fast rising as a star in his own right), DK and myself.\n\nHarley Harl and James Mountain (Solid Steel)\n\nMatt Black (Coldcut)\n\nDK (Solid Steel)\n\nThe boat we booked was on the dock on the North side of the Thames and the owners were a tad shady, so much so that when we started admitting people it was obvious that other people were coming on board without tickets and going to another part of the boat we didn’t know about. When confronted we were told that there was another private party on board and that it would be Ok, no one would cross over but we knew this was BS. Too late, the party had started and the deck was filling up and the weather was great for a late summer evening. The place was packed and there were three rooms, a main one and a more chilled one plus a couple of bars, at one point we gave everyone free lollies too. The set here is mine from the main room, complete with crowd noise and scrappy mixing but if you imagine a cramped top deck cabin with 100 or so sweaty people crammed in then you get the picture.\n\nPC (DJ Food)\n\nDJ Yoda\n\nYours truly (DJ Food)\n\nI think I was on either before or after Yoda but sadly missed most of his set as I had to sort stuff out with the food side of things. We had a problem with Diplo as he was flying into the UK that afternoon and coming straight to the boat to play and with no contact we were winging it as to whether he’d turn up in time or not. Luckily he did, literally minutes before he was due to play and proceeded to turn out a storming set – phew! DK went to see the boat owners afterwards to sort out the money and we ended up not having to pay for the boat hire as a result of all the nonsense with the other party – they certainly must have made a fortune on the bar that night anyway.\n\nMe and Diplo on the boat, it was sweaty!\n\nPhotos by Elisa Parish, Graham (Fraser?) and another unknown photographer.\n\nI’m not going to go through every track as there are many classics here most will know – keep an ear out for the switch up out of ‘Tour de France’ into Roni Size though – that was a moment. I loved this era of DnB, loads of fun, heavy rolling beats, synth bass lines and pop vocal hooks – check the Britney bootleg. I know Pendulum fell off but ‘Another Planet’ will always be a monster tune for me – never failed back in the day. The Carmel of ’Nujazzkiller’ isn’t the British jazz artist but a one-off on the Fluid Ounce label for 2002.\n\nTrack list:\n\nStas – Solid Steel Intro\n\nDouble Trouble – Live At The Amphitheatre\n\nSugarhill Gang – Rapper’s Delight\n\nBeastie Boys – Triple Trouble\n\nBeastie Boys – Triple Trouble (Graham Coxon mix)\n\nThe Chemical Brothers – Leave Home\n\nBoom Bip – Cords Will Be the Death Of Me\n\nQuantic feat.

The file comes from a huge caché of shows given to me by Paul Johnston and I’ve yet to fully go through them to see what I have or don’t have on his list. Paul has had a couple of mixes featured on Solid Steel over the years and they are always packed out with hilarious samples and a ton of work. He kindly shared his stash of shows with me so that I could fill in some gaps, thanks Paul. Here’s one he did back in the day – Smoke Filled Adventures\n\nKicking off with some Alec Empire from his Low On Ice album and a fine piece of twisted filter breakbeat, followed by some excellent unknown acid trip hop – I’d really like to know what this is but it would require a deep dive into the record collection – anyone know? Some vintage Orbital with the opener from their second album appears and then we splice into a break and cello track that again I can’t recall. DJ Food’s’ Spiral’ from the then-current ‘A Recipe For Disaster’ album plays out and I’m trying something with the intro of Mantronix’s ‘King Of the Beats’ and the pitch control over this but thankfully don’t overdo it. Another unidentified snatch of cut up party business is up next and this sounds like something from DJ Smash or the AV8 label from overseas but I can’t find anything after a scour of Discogs. The use of Doug E. Fresh’s “well it started off on 8th Avenue” from his classic ‘The Show’ is the main signifier.\n\nPublic Enemy’s excellent ‘You’re Gonna Get Yours (Dub / Terminator X Getaway Version)’ is next and rumour has it that the Terminator didn’t exactly do the cuts on this but it was the Kings of Pressure’s Johnny ‘Juice’ Rosado who was also connected to the Bomb Squad. David Holmes’ ‘Slash The Beats’ has Kooner and Burns of the Sabre of Paradise’s production fingerprints all over it and is a version of the track ’Slash the Seats’ without the acid line and spoken word. Instead I add the acappella to PE’s ‘Bring The Noise’ (starting on the wrong beat!). Air Liquide’s ambient ‘Robot Wars Symphony Part 1 System Engaged’ from their The Increased Difficulty of Concentration double CD is floated over and out of both these before a classic DnB tune that I just can’t pin enters.\n\nAnyone know this? It’s doing my head in and I spent nearly an hour on Discogs looking for it, thought it might be Alex Reece at first, Robin the Fog thought Wax Doctor or DJ Pulse but I couldn’t find anything – please comment if you recognise it. *(Eduard spotted it in the comments below – thanks!) The next track IS Alex Reece by way of a remix of DJ Krush’s ‘Yeah’ on Mo Wax with Cypress Hill’s ‘Scooby Doo’ floated over it, a mix I used to do often back then. Rolling, quite literally, out of this is Autechre’s ‘Rsdio’ and we’re in slow mode so it’s as good a time as any to air DJ Shadow’s ‘In/Flux’, or at least half of it. Up next is a tune I’ve not heard in years but remember so well, Luke Vibert’s near 10 minute remix of Ruby’s ‘Paraffin’. Ruby was Leslie Rankine from the thrash band Silverfish who were always in the indie music press in the early 90s, she then teamed up with Mark Walk and made a vocal trip hop album,’Salt Peter’. Their debut album is excellent and sadly overlooked although several singles were released with remixes by all sorts of contemporary artists and Vibert’s is one of the standouts, all time-stretched vocals and playful twists and turns. The track succeeding this is again lost in the midsts although sounds very familiar, so many records and so many years ago, it’ll come along some day. We play out with Small World’s ‘Dual Tone’ on Hard Hands, a chugging bass banger that got many an airing back in the day.\n\nNo mix next week as I’m on holiday, see you in two weeks…\n\nTrack list:\n\nAlec Empire – 22.24\n\nUnknown – unknown\n\nOrbital – Time Becomes\n\nUnknown – unknown\n\nDJ Food – Spiral\n\nUnknown – Unknown\n\nPublic Enemy – You’re Gonna Get Yours (Dub / Terminator X Getaway Version)\n\nDavid Holmes – Slash The Beats\n\nPublic Enemy – Bring The Noise (acappella)\n\nAir Liquid – Robot Wars Symphony Part 1 System Engaged\n\nGlider State – Atmosphere\n\nDJ Krush – Yeah (Alex Reece remix)\n\nCypress Hill – Scooby Doo\n\nAutechre – Rsdio\n\nDJ Shadow – In/Flux\n\nRuby – Paraffin (Wagon Christ remix)\n\nUnknown – Unknown\n\nSmall World – Dual Tone\n\nA late August show with Matt Black and I at the controls in which I kick off with three tracks straight from The Sound of MZEE compilation – a German label obsessed with Britcore rap. The two No Remorze tracks are straight out of the Hijack book of hardcore hip hop but with a German slant. Find their first album if you can, amazing record. Hearts of Darkness were the first release on Manchester label The Ruf errr… Label, releasing a couple of 12”s in the mid 90s before the label went full on hip hop. Alex Reece’s classic swinging remix of DJ Krush’s ‘A Whim’ should be familiar to all Mo Wax heads out there but Chronicles of Intense was lost in the mists of time to me and only Matt’s brief back track near the end gave any clue to it. Also lost is the identity of the stumbling breaks-y DnB cut after it that sounds like it’s nearly tripping over its own shoelaces, even more so when I turn it down to 33 rpm. As ever, if any of you recognise it, please leave a comment. UPDATE: Found it! The Committee – Profound Love on Creative Wax (but played here on 33rpm).\n\nKirk DeGiorgio’s Elegy slides in nicely and I discovered Kirk has not one but two compilations of rare material on his Bandcamp page featuring a whole host of bits and pieces from singles, comps and the like, no doubt excavated during lockdown – nearly 75 tracks in all spanning 1991-2014 – the man’s a genius. BPMF is a US 12” I picked up whilst working in Ambient Soho, really odd four-tracker that I still have somewhere on the Rancho Relaxo label. ‘Untitled #4’ is a bubbling acid thing that grooves away nicely out of Kirk’s track and then into Redcell (aka B12, a version of which also on a companion release to the Elegy track – ART 7.1/B1214.1). ‘Primitive Lites’ was taken from the then-new ‘Time Tourist’ LP and later featured in our Blech mix, still sounds like a futuristic city at night to me. Meat Beat Manifesto’s ‘That Shirt’, from their criminally under-appreciated Satyricon LP, still makes me laugh and exclaim, ‘It’s a Ben Sherman!’ whenever I chance upon one of their fine wares. Autechre’s ‘Second Bad Vilbel’ from the Anvil Vapre EP plays us out, brand new at the time, we didn’t know how good we had it, this was just another single on white label back then. I think it was either for this or the Keynell EP where I was staying at Sean and Rob’s after a gig in Sheffield and they were sampling kitchen utensils for beats and percussion sounds.\n\nTrack list:\n\nColdcut – Solid Steel intro\n\nNo Remorze – Interlude\n\nNo Remorze – Condemned To Death\n\nFast Forward – Day Of Infamy (Instrumental)\n\nHearts of Darkness – Don’t Fight The Featherweight\n\nColdcut – Solid Steel jingle\n\nDJ Krush – A Whim (Alex Reece remix)\n\nChronicles of Intense – Prophecy\n\nThe Committee – Profound Love\n\nElegy – /P Switch\n\nBPMF – Untitled #4\n\nRedcell – Infinite Lites (Primitives mix)\n\nMeat Beat Manifesto – That Shirt\n\nAutechre – Second Bad Vilbel\n\nAn approximation of a DJ Food club set around 2004, this is the kind of thing I was playing out at the time via two decks and a CDJ, still using vinyl, no Serato yet. Kicking off with Peloton’s entry for the Solid Steel intro competition which we’d conducted via the Ninja Tune forum. Sounds like I was plundering the Megatrip Soundbank collection of spoken word for samples featuring the word ‘more’ too over Roots Manuva and Ty’s ‘Oh You Want More?’. This, Alex Cartana and the Rootz n Works rework of Prince’s ‘Sign of the Times’ were examples of the Bangra rhythm style made popular by Missy and M.I.A. around this time. Speaking of Missy, here she is with Timberland over a bit of ‘Dark Lady’ although I can only hear The Human League’s ‘Being Boiled’ with this since our second Solid Steel mix CD.\n\nA little funk section from That Kid Named Miles, Quantic Soul Orchestra (featuring Alice Russell), Roy Budd (from the ‘Vigilante! Remixes EP) Nostalgia 77 and Bobby Shad – (from Coldcut’s Life:Styles compilation of the same year) before a brace of hip hop numbers from Edan & Insight, a mash up of Obie Trice by Dizzy Bull and classic UK old school from Caveman. Back to the funk with classic Roy Ayres and I get scratch happy with Double Dee & Steinski’s James Brown cut up, ‘Lesson 2’ before things go into the unexpected with the I Royals’ reggae cover of the Coronation Street theme. This was possibly the first outing on the show too for my now good friend Stephen Coates’ Real Tuesday Weld with his ‘Bathtime In Clerkenwell’.\n\nAnother Solid Steel intro entry, this time from DJ Flywheel, for a change of tempo into Billy Squier’s (big) beat break into Steve Miller’s equally classic B-Boy sample-fest and general all round anthem, ‘Fly Like An Eagle’. Not sure what I was thinking with this section, it’s a very odd selection of tunes, possibly more linked by tempo than anything else although Floormaster Squeeze (aka Coldcut) goes pretty nicely into Japan’s ‘Visions of China’. Japan into Serge Gainsbourg into Boards of Canada – not something I’d attempt most days but it sort of works, especially the Indeep track over the top of the latter, something I’d repeat years later in my ‘O Is For Orange’ mix. We end as we began with another jingle competition entry, this time from Laptop Nancyboy, I wonder what happened to them?\n\nTrack list:\n\nPeloton – Solid Steel intro\n\nTy feat.

Obsession with bootlegs and mashups was still relatively new at this stage and the discovery of Cassetteboy was a key link in the chain. Their meticulous cut ups of TV and radio shows added to the (toilet) humour of the movement and made sure nothing ever got too serious. That they would end up doing material for the Guardian website was something I doubt any of us could have foreseen. This mix is strewn with excerpts from The Parker Tapes, their debut album on Barry’s Bootlegs (an offshoot of Spymania who first gave us Squarepusher), parts of which I would also include in my Raiding the 20th Century mix some years later.\n\nAmon Tobin’s Out From Out Where LP was released this summer and the track ‘Back From Space’ opens the show before Antipop Consortium’s amazing ‘Ghostlawns’ creeps in, still sounding as fresh as the day it was released. The clipped minimalism of Murcof took everyone by surprise when he debuted on Leaf, coming on like a classical Akufen, the beauty of which I totally spoilt by running a Cassetteboy Jamie Oliver sketch over the top – “I’m gonna whack my old man, right up his alley” – yes, quite. Monkey Magic’s ‘More Than We Know’ I had to look up – seems it was a lone 12” on the Deep-Water label and I’m not sure if the Monkees cut up at the end was part of the track or not. Cujo aka Amon Tobin’s sole album was reissued on Ninja Tune around this time and it’s great to hear the contrast although I quite like the cheesy silliness of ‘Popsicle’ myself, sounding more like something Tipsy would have put out than his later material.\n\nSinewave – ‘Attack Of The Triffids’ – this was Canadian drum n bass artist, Mark Wiebe, not sure where I got this, maybe given it on tour? That guy has some drum editing skills, I do love rediscovering all these old tracks when digging out 20+ year old shows. Apani B Fly’s ‘Ghost Cauldrons’ was a hip hop that was remixed by Blacklodge and Patrick Pulsinger, the latter of which proceeded to cut up Herbie Hancock’s electronic rendition of ‘Cantaloupe Island’ from his Japanese Dedication album all over the track. Computer Jockeys’ ‘Ping Pong’ was another that had me reaching for Discogs and this appears to have first been released in 1999 on the Harvest label – yes, that Harvest – but was included on a compilation is 2002 which is probably how I found it. Steinski’s remix of Moloko’s ‘Small World’ was taken from his Nothing To Fear Solid Steel mix CD that never was – and now Roisin Murphy is a fully fledged Ninja artist.\n\nAnother brief Cassetteboy interlude precedes Edan w Eric Ferguson’s ‘Clinical Rhymes’, an old school freestyle over classic B Boy beats – Edan still untouchable, just wish he’d make more records. Herbert remixing Fridge wasn’t a pairing I’d have ever put together but it works as Matthew Herbert smooths out the rough edges and adds female vocals to beautiful effect. More Cassetteboy before we finish with a rather jovial Witchman remix of The Orb and the tape is ejected.\n\nTrack list:\n\nAmon Tobin – Back From Space\n\nAntipop Consortium – Ghostlawns\n\nMurcof – Maiz\n\nMonkey Magic – More Than We Know\n\nCujo – Popsicle\n\nSinewave – Attack of the Triffids\n\nApani B Fly – Ghost Cauldrons (Patrick Pulsinger remix)\n\nComputer Jockeys – Ping Pong\n\nMoloko – The Id (Small World – Steinski version)\n\nEdan w. Eric Ferguson – Clinical Rhymes\n\nFridge – Ark (Herbert Fully Floooded mix)\n\nCassetteBoy – Your Love is Like Benelyn\n\nThe Orb – Ow Much? (Witchman 2975 mix)\n\nKicking off 2005 in full-on DnB style with a monologue from Armando Iannucci’s Time Trumpet radio series, a not entirely serious look at music through the ages, which glues this set together. Steaming in with Pendulum’s remix of Concord Dawn’s ‘Tonite’ we’re into 170bpm dance floor destruction straight away and it rarely lets up. I loved Pendulum early on, before and around the first album, I felt they really revitalised DnB for a while after years of it going down a dark, minimal 2-step path which sounded like music for ketamine and a good kicking rather than the euphoric party it had been just a few years before. The Good Looking stable and its ilk were too soft for me back then although I’ve reappraised that since, mellowing with age and all. Back then I wanted my DnB hard and fast, with intricate drum programming and stomping basslines and Pendulum bought all that back with a twist and a swing only previously heard in the Brazilian styles of DJ Marky and Shy FX & T-Power. Of course it all went horribly wrong once they became a stadium band and started using guitars but for a few years there were some great singles and remixes.\n\nThere were a spate a white label DnB reworkings of RnB/Pop hits for a good while too in the mid 00s, post-bastard pop where hip hop and soul met in the charts and then got a good rinse out on the dance floor. Here, Beyoncé’s ‘Naughty Girl’ gets the treatment, apparently by T.C. from Bristol. The DJ Deval track I barely remember but it was on Reformed Recordings, a sub label of Formation. Fracture & Neptune were the first producers I remember who paid homage to Photek and Hidden Agenda with their early records. More Pendulum with ‘Back 2 You’, much more electronic than their later work and then Dynamite MC, for my money one of the best MCs to hold it down over DnB, breaks, hip hop or garage over the years, so funky. Here he trades verses with Skibadee to brutal effect, this used to go down a storm. That rework of Britney’s ‘Toxic’ is just too fast isn’t it? I think was the first release on a label called Toxic who also released the earlier Beyoncé retool.\n\nZen ‘Monster Munch’ – had to look this up, thought it might have been an alias of DJ Zinc but no, it’s another Reformed release, what a bassline! HUGE hoover bass! Fracture & Neptune back again, with the second track from their 12” on Breakin’, this time sampling Vangelis’ Blade Runner, what’s not to like? Ghost People I had to look up too and then realised that the artist name was actually Influx UK and I’d had it round the wrong way all these years – whoops, those white label promos! More early Pendulum with ‘Trail Of Sevens’ which starts out more like Link’s ‘Chameleon’ than their later stuff, then there’s that breakdown and the rave synths come in with that bass bounce and precision percussion and we’re in some rapid-fire car chase scenario. Fracture & Neptune are back for another slice, ‘Too Doggone Funky’ is a perfect example of how to dig for breaks and not always fall back on the ol’ faithful Amen. Killer track, love it when DnB goes out on a jazz trip like this, will have to go and dig the 12” out, I had a big DnB cull a few years back but I’m pretty sure this didn’t go – again taking notes from the Photek school of production, could be ‘KJZ’ part 2.\n\nWe’re back in Pendulum territory again although this is DJ Fresh from his Breakbeat Kaos label (no.2 actually) that he ran with Adam F and which Pendulum were associated with early on. And here’s a DJ Deval track I definitely remember, his remix of RSL’s ‘Wesley Music’ – a rare case of a 130bpm anthem being retrofitted into a new speed and genre without losing the vibe of the original although it’s a bit long! My attention span doesn’t run to five minutes of one track in the mix these days it seems. But suddenly – Cheese! Richard that is – ha ha I’d forgotten this too, one of the best to do it but what a rude awakening, then it’s exit stage left from Iannucci’s museum of lost keyboards. See you next week.\n\nTracklist:\n\nwasps – Stolen Solidly intro\n\nArmando Iannucci – Museum of Lost Keyboards\n\nConcord Dawn – Tonite (Pendulum Remix)\n\nBeyonce – Naughty Girl (Unknown remix)\n\nDJ Deval – Jah Creationz\n\nFracture & Neptune – Untightled\n\nPendulum – Back 2 You\n\nDynamite MC feat.
