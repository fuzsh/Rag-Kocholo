        "text": "2019 was home to an abundance of amazing full-length projects, here are some of The Pit London’s favourite offerings.\n\nEmily Fortune’s Picks\n\nROMderful - Press L to Continue\n\nThe Birmingham-based producer and multi-instrumentalist dropped his first official solo project just at the beginning of the year to huge acclaim. Featuring friends of his such as rapper KayFaraway to international artists such as Dounia and TOBi, ROMderful managed to capture his colourful world and create a refreshingly new sound whilst trying to reimagine a golden age of R&B.\n\nJuls - Colour\n\nHaving spent a lot of his career producing for various renowned artists, most namely Mr Eazi, Juls proved with this project he had kept the best tracks for himself. ‘Colour’ comes as a fusion of so many eclectic sounds, feelings and features. From the dark and gritty Kojey Radical feature, ‘Normal’ to the emotional, ‘No Lie’ featuring Knucks, XamVolo and Che Lingo, this project explores an incredible amount of ideas whilst bringing together some of the best in the scene.\n\nCollard - Unholy\n\nBringing his melodic, screeching soul, the London based artist really created something different. From the upbeat feeling of, ‘Greyhound’ to the simplistic, yet dark Kojey Radical feature, ‘Ground Control’, Collard didn’t hold back. With recognition coming from not only his peers but Sir Elton John, it would be an understatement to say this project didn’t give a little something for everyone.\n\nTramell Mugarura’s Picks\n\nFemdot - 94 Camry Music\n\nChicago has been churning out sensational talent as of late and no list would be complete without mentioning Femdot. The Illinois native and recent Biology graduate released heavyweight album ‘94 Camry Music’ and you can tell every detail was considered down to a molecular level. On the closing track, ‘Snuck To Matty’s’, Femdot’s storytelling ability comes into full affect with a 6 minute tale that you can envision in your minds eye due to the rappers ability to make the smallest details seem highly important.\n\nMelo-Zed - Zachary\n\nWhen it comes to breaking sonic boundaries, look no further. ‘Zachary’ is an explosive unyielding form of expression for the young London artist. The project is likened to that of Thundercat, Sun Ra, Flying Lotus - experimental but not pretentious. It features some the the UK’s rising talent such as Lex Amor and Lord Apex, putting them on backing tracks out of their comfort zone yet making them sound at home. Melo-Zed stretched his abilities on ‘Zachary’ and leaves the listener wondering what his manic mind has left to offer.\n\nMother Nature - Saturn Return\n\nIf you’re looking for conscious Hip Hop club bangers then Mother Nature’s ‘Saturn Return’ is the project for you. Hailing out of Chicago, Illinois, the duo comprised of emcees T.R.U.T.H and Klevah, exude soul, power and wisdom through their bars. ‘Saturn Return’ is a deep dive into the soul of two individuals that have battled the pressures of their own vices, only to come out the other side on top and stronger than ever.\n\nAmy Hurford’s Picks\n\nEgo Ella May - So Far\n\nThe dedicated artistry of Ego Ella May’s ‘So Far’ caught my attention this year. As a Jazz fan who finds herself seeking empathy surrounded by coolness, this album answered my prayers. I listened to it in its entirety with no breaks. I was totally encapsulated by the phrasing. The project is in no way overstated, the harmonies speak to each other. It’s heavy, yet leaves necessary space to breathe. For me, it was like feeling her detach from herself at will, and the musical arrangements are more than sublime, they are almost like time travel.\n\nK The Infinite - MERKABA\n\nAn entirely confessional heavyweight of a project was released this year. ‘MERKABA' was born from a broken spirit. The album drapes over the scaffolding of civilisations, and truly reaches for God at absolute heartbreak. That heartbreak was a catalyst for an already established talent and powerful intellect, the musicians who, of course, are the flesh of the whole thing evidently saw this. ‘MERKABA’ musically leaps and glides around you and each musician is a selfless Jazz giant. The headline show was amazing and I can’t wait to see the process this artist exposes in 2020.\n\nJerome Thomas - Mood swings (Volume One)\n\nThere are 40,000 known fans of the musical offerings of extraordinary singer Jerome Thomas and his Foechestra. How many unknown we will undoubtedly find out in 2020. Jerome drew his line in the sand with ‘Mood Swings (Volume One)’, it felt as if there could be no further denying of the artists’ stake in the game. We still have much to learn about this enigmatic man, at once deeply sensitive and yet a monster force on stage. ‘Mood Swings’ gave us our second full dose of a life lived in almost constant musical production and strict disciplines of body mind and soul. It sings of man’s most pure desire akin to music, love. It swirls, drowns, floats and promises more.\n\nSolange - When I Get Home\n\nSolange has been a beacon of hope for me this year. I knew the album would be good, but she actually broke the barrier with ‘When I Get Home’, it isn’t like anything else you’ve ever heard. Her recent medley from the Tonight Show provided so much pure art I nearly threw up. It’s too late in the game for me to try to describe it to you, everyone had something to say about it. But to be honest, its originality alone put it a cut above the rest. Solange is her own artist, her whole catalogue is about growth now.\n\nKieran Spooner’s Picks\n\nD-Block Europe - PTSD\n\nThe wave Gods of the UK’s scene - finally artists that can compete in the US market! An act you could avoid was D-Block Europe and their second project of the year ‘PTSD’! At first, I was sceptical that the project had 28 tracks but this, for me, drove home their range and the number of different ways you can talk about cunnilingus. Young Adz is the star man of DBE, but that is not to say Dirtbike LB is not getting better and better. With 2 dates at Alexandra Palace and a third tape expected before 2019 is out, nobody can compare to their work rate in the studio!\n\nHeadie One - Music x Road\n\nI have not always been the biggest fan of Headie One, but it is fair to say with his growth this year through countless features and his debut album ‘Music x Road’, he has solidified himself as one of my favourites of 2019! A solid album from start to finish, ‘Music x Road’ showed the potential Headie has to go further than the UK Drill sound that he originally built his name from. Witnessing first hand the headline show at Brixton Academy, the people want Headie to win and this album provided enough bangers to keep them completely satisfied!\n\nSnoh Aalegra - Ugh, Those Feels Again\n\nI am a huge fan of Snoh Aalegra! I have been following her music for years now and it is only a matter of time until Snoh is one of the biggest acts in the world. ‘- Ugh, those feels again’ is a solid body of work which oozes class and is the musical embodiment of a chandelier! Her show earlier in the year at Shepherds Bush Empire was an intimate show for her early fans. Next year I expect a Brixton Academy size venue. Also a special mention for Snoh coming down to our show on Reprezent earlier this year. A true superstar in waiting!\n\nWretch 32 - Upon Reflection\n\nWretch 32 is one of those artists that when they release a project, the whole culture stops and listens to what he has to say. ‘Upon Reflection’ was only announced a day or so before the album dropped and it felt like Christmas had come early for me and the rest of my timeline. This is a testament to the type of artist Wretch is. Wretch is a true wordsmith who does not receive the mainstream attention he deserves. However on this album, I think this was the first project where that was no longer a concern of his, and let me tell you, the art benefitted.\n\nStormzy - Heavy Is The Head\n\nI know you are probably reading this thinking “wtf”. How can I add an album that came out mid-December to a yearly round up of albums of the year? I can explain. The whole release of this project from Stormzy has been nothing short of top class. A monumental year where he headlined Glastonbury with only one album released. It looks like with the second album Big Mike is gonna need a bigger stage! Sampling classic UK staples such as ‘Baby Boy’ by Big Brovaz on ‘Rachael’s Little Brother’ to Tracey Beaker’s theme song on ‘Superheroes’, it shows Stormzy is using this album to cement his place within British folklore rather than international success. It is clear he understands his career is a journey and not everything has to be achieved within the first two albums. International success will come. The album has a vulnerability on it that we do not get from a lot of UK artists within our culture, therefore this had to get a place.\n\nAlfred Afari’s Picks\n\nslowthai - Nothing Great About Britain\n\nslowthai has been nothing short of great this year. Although he is still at an early stage in his career, he has already cemented his space among the greats. Showcasing a side of Britain that is usually not seen by the wider UK, he brings a platform to topics that clearly affect him deeply and needs to speak on. He speaks on all of these issues perfectly as seen in 'Inglorious’ featuring Skepta and the introspective UKG inspired banger ‘Toaster’. He even embodied this theme of broken Britain and being its saviour with his sold out tour with tickets being sold at just £5. This album takes the listener on many twists and turns with slowthai making genres his bitch!\n\nSkepta - Ignorance Is Bliss\n\nCertified rap legend Skepta delivers another one for his catalogue. The project is not 'Konichiwa' nor does it try to be. What you get is a mature Skepta ready to show his vulnerability. At this stage in Skepta’s career we can only be happy he still blesses us with tracks. Notable banger is the UKG hit 'Love Me Not' which samples Sophie Ellis Baxter’s classic 'Murder on The Dance Floor'. The track also has one of the best UKG rap verses of the year from B Live. The vinyl is definitely one to add to your collection as it shows the thermal print of whatever is placed onto it. It is great to see a legend such as Skepta still continue to push boundaries in his roll out.\n\nKaytranada - Bubba\n\n2019 has been an amazing year for R&B and Kaytranda’s album has been an amazing late entry showcasing some amazing talent on some amazing beats. I would have to class this as future R&B with the type of beats that Kaytranada uses and his use of the vocalists. Features such as Kali Uchis, SIR, Estelle, and many more. Teedra Moses absolutely kills her feature.\n\nBurna Boy - African Giant\n\nBurna Boy is really pushing some of the most amazing Afrobeats. It is very authentic and unapologetically African and it’s great to see it get the recognition that he actually deserves. The Fela Kuti influence is on full blast with Burna even developing his own dance moves. 'Gum Body' is a collab that I didn’t even know I needed but it slaps so hard. Having to follow on from his last album and the cultural behemoth that was 'Ye', it was always going to prove to be a hard feat to follow. However, 'On The Low' is guaranteed to get the party going!\n\nKano - Hoodies All Summer\n\nThis album was everything we could have wanted from a legend in Grime. The whole album shows a mature side to Kano allowing us to understand what runs through the head of someone that is clearly content in their life but still allowing a platform to issues that affect his community. The video for 'Trouble' into 'Class of Deja', for me hits, on a personal level, having lost a friend to violence you feel so many emotions - mainly anger. This music video doesn’t hold back when showing the actual murder to the funeral, 2 events that are the worst part of the whole grieving process, but Kano expertly shows those scenarios while producing an instant classic in 'Class of Deja' featuring legends D Double E and Ghetts. It's not all deep introspective as Kano drafts in long time friend Popcaan for 'Can't Hold We Down'.\n\nSAMPA THE GREAT - The Return\n\nA distinctive voice and infectious delivery. The Melbourne based artist returns (no pun intended) with vivid yet peaceful passion that omnipresent while she spits bars about melanin and heaven over heavy sampling productions. “And I woke up from my death, less of a care to impress/'Cause uh, inner peace be the new success” are just a few lines that will keep you anchored to hear more. Seeing her live is on the to-do list.\n\nkosher’s Picks\n\nMAXO - LIL BIG MAN\n\nWith cloudy lo-fi jazz beats, Maxo puts together his album ‘LIL BIG MAN; consisting of reflective thoughts on his younger and older self. The pressure is evidently on for Maxo on records like ‘In My Penny's’ and ‘Strongside’. Maxo's style of getting his words across to the listener sounds like he's at a confessional trying to repent making it easy to cling on to what he's saying and find relatability to it.\n\nMEDHANE - OWN PACE\n\nThe sLUms collective is currently home to a lot of the most interesting acts in Hip Hop. It includes artists like MIKE and Ade Hakim, and has frequent collaborators like Earl Sweatshirt, Maxo, and Medhane. I came to learn about Medhane through his collaborative efforts with MIKE; while his sound is like that of Earl Sweatshirts’, their differences made me a fan. His latest album ‘Own Pace’ is collection of looped jazz beats where the rappers laid back style and repetition of certain lines throughout his raps is effective to get his messaging across."
