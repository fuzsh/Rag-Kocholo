        "text": "The Outlawz were formed by Tupac. He took names from old dicators and rulers and gave each one of them thier names. Tupac even gave Kurupt his nickname 'Young Gotti', and also gave Daz from Tha Dog Pound the name Dillinger... which makes him Daz Dillinger.\n\nNow on how the Outlawz met. Kastro (K-Dogg) is cousins with Tupac. He lived in Atlanta along with Edi Amin (Big Mal). They were very close and grew up together. Edi and Kastro's mothers were also very close. Also, they knew Kadafi (Yak) really well, and Kadafi is from New Jersey. So it started with those 3. Now Napoleon who is also from New Jersey, his family knew Kadafi's family very good. Kadafi's mom and Napoleon's aunt were really close. Kadafi birthday was like 2 days before Napoleon's birthday. So they always celebrated birthdays together. Then was like a period of time when they havnt seen eachother or talked to eachother. Then when they saw eachother again, Napoleon found out Kadafi was rhyming, and Kadafi's mom told Napoleon that Kadafi was Tupac's half-brother. So right there you have what was called 'Dramacydal'. The 4 members were Edi (Big Mal), Kastro (K-Dogg), Napoleon (Mutah), and Kadafi (Yak). Tupac took all them and they moved to Atlanta.\n\nNow at this time a few new members would join, which later came to be known as the Outlawz. Hussein Fatal knew Kadafi well too. And Young Noble was from Kadafi's block. Young Noble also has family in Southern California. So all 6 then hooked up when they moved to Los Angeles, California. Now Tupac talked to all the members from Thug Life and wanted them to be in the Outlawz as well to make it be 10 members. Here's the scoop on that. Rated R could not join cause he had jail problems. Macadoshis did not join cause he did not want to be around Suge Knight. He told Pac that Suge was no good, and he had seen some of the stuff that Suge would do to people. He talked about one time they were all at the mountains, and it was freezing cold, and how Suge Knight made a guy take off his clothes in front of everyone, and made him stand outside, where it was snowing, butt naked, and some of them laughed. Macadoshis said he didn't want to be around that. Big Syke (Mussollini) and Mophreme (Konami) went along to join the Outlawz as well. They did not just leave the group Thug Life, they were and are still in Thug Life, but they are also Outlawz as well. Now you have 8 Outlaw members NOT including Tupac in that number. The Outlawz later hooked up with Storm, who is the female Outlaw, and now they have 9 members. Storm has a scar on her face, and is said to be really crazy in the head. Tupac always thought she was sorta a female version of him in a way. I feel Storm could crush ANY female rapper out there if they went head to head, including Eve, Trina, MC Lyte, whoever. Later, Young Ritzy (Gonzoe) joined the group. Besides Gonzoe who joined late, the other 9 Outlawz were put together very fast.\n\nThe Outlawz are not gangsta rap. They started thug rap with tupac, but now they are past that. A lot of people say how 2Pac lyrics affect them and their lives. 2Pac trained them, and when you hear their lyrics they are very powerful. What they have to say is better then a lot of the commercial bull-shit that it getting played everyday on most radio stations and MTV. They came with the single 'Baby Dont Cry' as their first single. A lot of people wondered, and some critized the move. They felt women needed to hear this song right now. The Outlawz dont just want a hot record right now, they want to be great forever, and that's where the word 'Immortalz' came from, which is why they are the Outlaw Immortalz. 2Pac told them, make records for the girls, dont try to impress guys, the girls are the ones who buy the records, also, they know a song like that will be played on forever, down the line, people will be listening to baby dont cry ya gotta keep yea head up.\n\nThe Good Die Young is a song that will touch home on a lot of us. This is another version of Life Goes on. Just listen to the lyrics. Napoleon, who was raised without his parents, who were killed... Young Noble saying which is worst, Storm, Al, Pac or Yak? The Storm he is referring to is Nico Storm, NOT the female Outlaw Storm. Nico was someone they knew in New Jersey. He is also mention by Hussein Fatal on his solo album. Kastro in the song talks about the way the world is, things that are happening these days, that are very true. Then Edi says that if you dont raise ya kids right, you'll see exactly why the Good Dies young... Now, just hearing that alone, does that make you think, wow that was a great message to send? If not, you need help, and you are brainwashed too damn much by commercial music, and you are a MTV clone.\n\nThe song 'As The Word Turns' is another powerful track, with the Outlawz. Tupac said it best at the end of the song: Money come and go, hoes come and go, friends come and go, foes come and go, but his soldiers stay eternal. The Outlawz will forever keep Makaveli alive. NO ONE else is!!! Napoleon says \"nigga talking thug, walking all thru your squad\"... he's talking about the FAKE tough guys like Mobb Deep. Saying thug life is still theirs. That's Bull-shit, they never started Thug life, or Thug rap. He also says in his verse, he serves 'em, like Pac told him too. Edi talking about the haters only came, when 2Pac was ready to catch his millions. Just a very powerful song.\n\nAnother song is 'U Can Be Touched'. This basicly says no one on this earth is more then another person. Just cause you think you have it all, or you think no one can harm you, U can still be touched. A quote from Napoleon in the song is \"I ain't afraid to die, I want to see what's after this. I'm living blind writing rhymes til they capture this. And if we die let the world understand why\". That right there is a powerful statement. Saying he's aint afraid to die, and that he wants to see whats after this life. Kastro says \"My nigga.. Lonnie just got hit with 10... 10 years. For trusting a friend, they left him stuck in the Penn\"... A lesson on trust right there. Trusting a friend, and sometimes that is what trust get's you, in the hospital, in jail, or even killed. You hear Young Noble say \"Even when we get a job, we fucking it up. Like it can't happen to us, I could never be a bum. Yeah right, you wound up one\"... Basicly someone saying I cant be tocuhed, I would never be a bum, and he says yeah right, you COULD be one. So basicly this song U Can Be Touched is saying in many ways of life, everyone can be touched, weather it's no longer havin a job, money, a house, or even living and being alive, U CAN be touched!\n\nWhen the Outlawz worked with Pac, whoever came up with their flow verse got on a song. That taught them. They could never take a beat home. They would record 3 songs in one day. FULL SONGS. Below are the meaning of what Outlawz and Thug Life, and below that you will find information on each Outlaw along with a picture of each person. There is also quotes from the Outlawz songs. If you havn't, read the quotes, act as if someone is telling you what they are saying, and you will also feel the powerful meaning of their words.\n\nOperating\n\nUnder\n\nThug\n\nLawz\n\nAz\n\nWarriors\n\nZ\n\nThe\n\nHate\n\nU\n\nGave\n\nLittle\n\nInfants\n\nFuck\n\nEverybody\n\nMakaveli-\n\na.k.a 2Pac (Niccolo Machiavelli)\n\nEdi Amin-\n\na.k.a Big Mal (Idi Amin)\n\nYoung Noble-\n\na.k.a.

I felt that most people who do books are in desperate need to grab a few dollars. That wasn't the case with me. I felt there was so many books out speaking on me, speaking on Pac, speaking on Death Row. There's a lot of question marks I need to put periods [on]. It will be aggressive, plus there will be some educational things for the kids.\"\n\nKnight also said that some MCs should educate themselves on Shakur's history before thinking about using his music. He praised Jay-Z for sampling Tupac's \"Me and My Girlfriend,\" was disappointed by Nas' participation in last year's \"Thugz Mansion\" and had disdain for Daz because he gave out some unreleased Pac vocals to be used on the street smash \"The Realest Killas\" with 50 Cent.\n\n\"Pac can go hard in the paint on anybody when he wanted to and I'm gonna ride with him regardless, but I know Pac didn't have a real disliking for Jay,\" Knight said of some of the old disses Shakur levied at Young Hova on the Makaveli album. \"[Pac] didn't have a disliking to him where if he saw [Jay] he wanted to try and take his head off.\n\n\"I think it was a situation that we get older, we grow,\" Knight explained signing off on Jay-Z's use of the music from \"Me and My Girlfriend.\" \"If Jay wanted to do something that he felt great about, if he wants to do something that's positive and is also not being disrespectful to Pac, why not? Sometimes we gotta be able to open our eyes up.\"\n\nKnight raised an eyebrow when he heard the Tupac/ Nas collaboration \"Thugz Mansion\" last year. Although Nas was asked to participate in the project by Shakur's estate, Suge said if it were up to him, the two MCs' vocals would have never been on the same track.\n\n\"I think it's real disrespectful to Pac,\" he lamented. \"You gotta put a price on fame; it can't be to the point where you'll do anything for a hit. Be a man and have respect. If you can't respect nobody else, respect yourself. Don't go [do a song] knowing a certain individual didn't care for you. I could see Jay-Z doing what he did more than Nas on the same song with Pac, because Nas and Pac is from two different worlds.\"\n\nObviously, Dogg Pound gangsta Daz and Tupac were from same world: They were signed to the same label, hung in the same circles and made several recordings together. Still, Knight admitted anger at Daz's use of the Tupac vocals, some of which he independently sold, others he simply gave away. An unreleased Tupac verse has appeared on the song \"The Realest Killas,\" which was produced by Red Spyda and features 50 Cent.\n\n\"That's bootleg stuff,\" Knight calmly iterated. \"Anything that Daz did, that's bootleg stuff. It's only obvious anything that 50 Cent do on [a mixtape] with Pac, it's bootleg. You gotta look at the respect level of it.\"\n\nKnight is planning to release his own Tupac music in conjunction with Shakur's mother, Afeni. He does not know exactly when those songs will see the light of day.\n\n\"We still have some stuff on him that is great, but at the same time, it's not about just doing anything on Pac,\" the label executive clarified.\n\nSource:MTV.com\n\nNEWS UPDATE\n\nDarryl on April 23rd, 2003\n\nThe website was down.. and is going thru a minor change wish should better the site.
