        "text": "Section I: The Grand Upright Precedent\n\nIn 1991, Biz Markie asked for a lift and got a lawsuit. That year, Markie, the old-school New York City rapper less well known by his legal name, Marcel Theo Hall, and best known for his 1989 song “Just a Friend,” released his album I Need a Haircut to a lukewarm critical reception and modest sales. Included in the album was the forgettable song “Alone Again,” in which Markie raps a litany of complaints about his lack of reliable and helpful friends, spending the first minute of his song focusing on an acquaintance’s unwillingness to give him a ride in a Harlem snow shower. Pedantic as the song may be to most listeners, it did contain two musical component of interest to others in the entertainment industry: the looped piano melody and four-word refrain of Irish singer-pianist Gilbert O’Sullivan’s far more successful 1972 single “Alone Again (Naturally).” Markie had sampled, or used a portion of, O’Sullivan’s recording despite O’Sullivan’s explicit refusal, as owner of the copyright to his own song’s composition, to grant Markie and his record label the rights to do so. Seeking an immediate injunction against release of Markie’s record, the record label Grand Upright Records, Ltd. which had since obtained title to O’Sullivan’s copyright, sued Markie and his record label, Warner Bros. Records Inc. for copyright infringement in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\nIn a blistering and at times blusterous decision issued on December 17, 1991, nearly four months after Haircut’s release, Federal Judge Kevin Thomas Duffy not only ruled for Grand Upright and ordered the defendants to cease distribution of the Markie’s album, but even referred the defendants to the district’s U.S. Attorney for criminal prosecution. Beginning his succinct opinion with the damning statement, “Thou Shalt Not Steal,” Duffy accused Markie and Warner Bros. of “callous disregard for the law and for the rights of others[1].” Though his opinion did not provide evidence to demonstrate that the defendants had acted with malicious intent, Duffy did observe that Markie and Warner Bros. willingly permitted the sale of his album, including the O’Sullivan samples, despite believing that they lacked the necessary authorization from O’Sullivan to include his protected work. The judge also accused the defense council of incompetence, noting their failure to conduct standard discovery of the plaintiffs and their reliance on a long-obsolete technical statute regarding copyright transfer to win the case. In the absence of any serious assertions by the defense that there existed an artistic right to sample others’ work, Duffy decided the case exclusively on the grounds that the plaintiffs owned O’Sullivan composition and that the defendants had used it without consent.\n\nIn the context of the particular matter before him, Judge Duffy’s ruling had a just effect. Markie’s artistic contribution in “Alone Again” gave the impression of an amateur in a high-school lunch-break rap battle; verbally muddled, lyrically sloppy, and acoustical uninspired, “Alone Again” sounded like an afterthought included in the album to bring it to thirteen tracks. As a matter of impression, Markie’s lyrics seemed almost to showcase O’Sullivan’s sampled work, with the latter providing the sole variation in lyrical pitch and the only actually music in the song. However, as a matter of legal precedent, Duffy’s ruling was disastrous for the art of so-called “old school” hip hop, which relies upon intensive sampling both as a vehicle for its practitioners’ rhythmically spoken word and, at is best, to ameliorate an artist’s message or “message” in a particularly track. In his decision, Duffy made two statements that bore heavily on the legal status of common sampling practices in the hip-hop community. In the first section of the ruling, the judge laid out his framework for deciding the case, writing,\n\nDefendants admit \"that… ‘Alone Again’…uses three words from ‘Alone Again (Naturally),’ composed by Gilbert O'Sullivan and a portion of the music taken from the O'Sullivan recording.”… The only issue, therefore, seems to be who owns the copyright to the song “Alone Again (Naturally)” and the master recording thereof made by Gilbert O'Sullivan.\n\nIn effect, Duffy dismissed the notion that any amount of a copyrighted work could be incorporated by another artist without the permission of the copyright holder. The judge made clear the implication of this assumption in the third section of the verdict, in which he states, “Each defendant who testified knew that it is necessary to obtain a license – sometimes called a ‘clearance’ – from the holder of a valid copyright before using the copyrighted work in another piece.” The critical word in the sentence was “knew;” rather than observe that Markie and his agents believed that they had an obligation to obtain prior clearance for the use of a protected work, Duffy chose to affirm that belief, implying that it was true. The judge’s statement had no qualifications; apparently oblivious to the gravity of the finding, Duffy was ruling that any use of copyrighted material, no matter the amount or the natural of the reproduction, by another artist or intellectual-property distributor without prior issuance of a license to do so from the legal owner of the given copyright, was illegal.\n\nSection II: De Minimis and Fair Use Threatened\n\nIn his effort to project disapproval of what he termed “rampant [stealing] in the music business[2],” Judge Duffy himself submitted sloppy work, neglecting to exempt from his licensing requirement several forms of unauthorized use and reproduction of copyrighted work explicitly authorized by the Copyright Act of 1976, upon which Duffy’s decision was legally grounded. However, even assuming that Duffy did not intend to overrule the statutory law, and that he or any other judge would certainly apply those legal exemptions should a relevant case present itself, his decision in Upright was irresponsibly broad and ill-conceived, both in its ignorance of the ambiguities of sampling law and in its unintentional establishment of a convoluted and counterproductive licensing regime.\n\nNo doubt floored by the flagrancy of Markie’s act of infringement, Duffy did not think to consider two unsettled areas of the federal copyright statute that arguably permit hip-hop artists to engage in limited forms of sampling without ever obtaining a license: the de minimis defense and the doctrine of fair use. The de minimis defense, from the Latin de minimis non curat lex (“The law does not concern itself with trifles”), derives from the notion that some violations of statutory law are too insubstantial to warrant the intervention of the courts. A common defense in cases of copyright infringement, a valid de minimis claim generally requires that a sample of a copyrighted work be so minimal or so greatly altered as not retain a “substantial similarity” to the original composition[3]. Though the subjectivity of such a standard is immediately apparent, the primary methods that American courts have employed to determine substantial similarity only emphasize the difficulty and arbitrariness inherent in establishing the validity of the de minimis claim at trial. In the context of music sampling, the most established method of de minimis adjudication is to ask an “ordinary observer” – a layperson with no technical knowledge of the work in question, and perhaps a jury collectively – whether he (or they) find the defendant’s work to have an “aesthetic appeal” apparently indistinguishable from that of an allegedly infringed-upon composition[4]. In other words, if an untrained ear recognizes the sample as clearly belonging to the longer original composition, the sample lacks de minimis exception from copyright-infringement law and the sampler may be held liable for restitution and penalties.\n\nOwing to the unreliability intrinsic in the employment of a subjective layperson to make the technical judgments required for de minimis claims, musical copyright-infringement defendants tend to favor of the more statutorily recognized and less restrictive fair-use defense. Comprising Section 107 of the Copyright Law of the United States,[5] the Copyright Law of 1976’s “Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use” policy recognize the legal legitimacy of the fair use claim as a legal argument per se and attempts to provide a general framework for the judicial to use in judging the validity of a particular such claim by a musical-infringement defendant. The body of the law states:\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions sections 106 and 106A [which enumerate a copyright-owner’s exclusive rights to his protected work], the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright.[6]\n\nThough some of the protected forms of fair use are generally clear – the nature of news reporting, classroom use, and scholarship seem general clear – others are sufficiently broad to encompass limited forms of musical sampling. “Criticism” and “comment” of included samples both manifest themselves in many hip-hop tracks, even if in direct or subtle manners. Some hip-hop artists may, in their songs, establish an imaginary dialogue with their samples, as Eminem does with brief recordings of two sanctimonious-sounding social commentators in his 2004 song “Yellow Brick Road.” However, many more seem to use their samples to contribute to the positions or themes they discuss in their respective works, or to critically emphasize some cultural flaw or social inanity they find apparent in particular sampled works (this concept is more broadly discussed in Section IV). Regardless of the specific nature of an artist’s sample-laden track, or “subsuming work,” the fair-use doctrine provides potentially extensive sanctuary for hip-hop artists engaged in musical social criticism who are seeking to sample relevant compositions without the costs and bureaucratic difficulties associated with negotiating sampling licenses.\n\nSampling artists whose work does not constitute criticism or commentary of a sample in the most literal senses have a friend in the clarification guidelines provided in Section 107 to aid the courts in applying the statute. The four points of consideration provided in the Section are vague to the point of specious. As Section 107 continues:\n\nIn determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—\n\n(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;\n\n(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;\n\n(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and\n\n(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\n\nLike the prescriptive half of the section, this second half, apparently dedicated to clarifying the first, comprises a scale of clarity. A judge could reasonably understand point (3) to be a general reflection of the de minimis principle and point (4) to reflect a desire by Congress to give lenience in the assessment of copyright infringement to uses of copyrighted works that would presumably pose little or no threat of commercial competition with the original composition. In contrast, the first and especially second points are almost maddeningly vague as a matter of binding judicial procedure. Judges are directed to consider “the purpose and character of the use, including” – but not, apparently, limited to the intention of the sampler or other appropriator to profit from the use. The statute offers no guidance in how to weight the importance of those plans relative to the broader “purpose and character” of the use, and does not even clarify whether nonprofit or commercial use is to be preferred. Of course, when compared to a directive to consider “the nature of the copyrighted work,” point (1)’s intentions are relatively clear.\n\nFaced with the choice between the relatively clear but vulnerable de minimis method and the far broader yet more arbitrary and less reliable fair-use standard for determining the eligibility of a given sample for exemption from copyright-infringement action, many samplers specializing in extremely brief or highly altered samples might choose the devil they know better and argue a hypothetical infringement defense under the de minimis regime. However, for the past three years, that option has become greatly less accessible to them, following the ruling of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in the 2005 case of Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films. In the case, Bridgeport, a one-man copyright-holdings firm,[7] sued the ghetto-rap group N.W.A., claiming copyright infringement because the group had altered and then five times looped a two-second guitar riff from Funkadelic’s “Get Off Your Ass and Jam,” to which Bridgeport claimed copyright. In an example of the convolution of the contemporary American copyright-ownership regime, Funkadelic had given N.W.A. permission to use the sample, assuming that it held title to its own work. The Appeals Court found Bridgeport to be the lawful owner of the Funkadelic song and ordered N.W.A. to pay Bridgeport damages.[8]\n\nIn its decision, the 6th Circuit, whose authority to set binding common-law precedent over federal district courts encompasses Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee, ruled that the de minimis defense was invalid per se in the context of sample.[9] The court first recognized a component of the copyright statute unique to musical compositions: when a song is composed and then recorded, distinct copyrights are issued to the composer of the composition, the arrangement of notes and sounds that define the song, and to the owner of the “master recording,” a particular disk or album designated as the official physical record of the song, serving a function similar to that of a master key. To legally obtain the right to reproduce, distribute, or otherwise commercially use a song, the court noted, one must receive respective clearances from both the bearer of the composition copyright and the owner of the master recording. The court observed that Section 114(b) of the Copyright Law states, “The exclusive right of the owner of copyright in a sound recording… is limited to the right to duplicate the sound recording in the form of phonorecords or copies that directly or indirectly recapture the actual sounds fixed in the recording.”[10] Based on that standard, the court reasoned:\n\nThis means that the world at large is free to imitate or simulate the creative work fixed in the recording so long as an actual copy of the sound recording itself is not made. That leads us directly to the issue in this case. If you cannot pirate the whole sound recording, can you \"lift\" or \"sample\" something less than the whole? Our answer to that question is in the negative.\n\nThe court continued:\n\nFurther, the rights of sound recording copyright holders… \"do not extend to the making or duplication of another sound recording that consists entirely of an independent fixation of other sounds….\" (17 U.S.C. § 114(b)) The significance of this provision is amplified by the fact that the Copyright Act of 1976 added the word \"entirely\" to this language…. In other words, a sound recording owner has the exclusive right to 'sample' his own recording.\n\nThus, the court regarded the addition of the word “entirely” into the statue in 1976 as deeply significant, arguing that it implies that the bearer of the master-recording copyright alone has the right to produce a recording or copy of any amount of the master recording without license. Summarizing its line of reasoning, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals explained the impact of their decision with Duffy-esque clarity: “Get a license or do not sample.”[11] The court had thus rejected the legitimacy of the de minimis defense by musical samplers, siding, albeit more thoughtfully, with Judge Duffy on the question of whether the copyright statute respects a sliding scale of liability. While the court specifically did not rule on the validity of the fair-use defense, writing, “We express no opinion on [the defense’s] applicability to these facts,” it gave no hint that it would find such a defense compelling if confronted with it in the future, and, based on its refusal to acknowledge any overwhelming artistic justification for overriding what it regards as a settled statutory law prohibiting sampling, the court likely would be loath to permit sampling on vague free-expression grounds.\n\nIn the same paragraph ordering sample-seekers to obtain licenses for their desired works, the court argued that such an absolute approach was compatible with artistic expression and the culture of sampling. The court first argued that, if one wished to sample a work without a license, they were free under Section 114(b) to record their own performance of the relevant notes in a studio, seeing as it did not violate the master-record bearer’s exclusive right to the actual original recording. Second, the court posited, the free market would keep licensing fees reasonable, since artists would simply refuse to purchase licenses if the exceeded the cost of reproducing the song in a studio. Finally, the court noted that there was no credible risk of inadvertent violation of the law because the act of sampling an actual recording requires such a deliberate and affirmative decision to do so.\n\nThe court got its third justification right. Owing to its apparently fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of sampling and of the functionality of the music industry, the court got its first two justifications wildly wrong.\n\nSection III: The Aftermath\n\nThe Sixth Circuit’s surprising reversal of the district court’s verdict in Bridgeport only reinforced a convoluted, inefficient, and otherwise dysfunctional sampling-license regime that had developed in large part in response to Judge Duffy’s insufficiently considered opinion in Grand Upright fourteen years earlier. As a product of that and later decisions rejecting samplers’ appeals for recognition under fair use and de minimis statutes – many of those other cases apparently looking to Duffy’s established precedent on the matter in the entertainment-industry-heavy Southern District of New York – the American recording industry began to develop something akin to a private bureaucracy to handle sampling and other low-volume licensing requests. Major record labels, particularly those representing successful hip-hop artists, began turning their attention to negotiating for legal clearance to use brief samples in their clients’ tracks.\n\nWhat the Sixth Circuit had not anticipated is that the process of negotiating licenses to produce or redistribute copies of a copyrighted recording was vastly less streamlined and standardized than the financial power and development of the American entertainment industry might suggest. Even today, licensing negotiations for the use of songs in an ancillary context, for example, in a motion picture, are private and ad hoc, and do not follow and consistent pricing guidelines. Transactions between major record labels or those labels and film or television studios may demonstrate a greater consistency due to the presumable skill and preparatory research of each side’s negotiators and the sizeable sales data and institutional knowledge retained by each side, allowing each party to better estimate the value of securing a deal. However, as the terms of such deals are generally guarded to protect the labels’ and studios’ negotiating positions, aggregate data is virtually non-existent and wholly unreliable. Among smaller entities lacking for negotiating teams and sophisticated financial models, the outcomes of negotiations over the right to license of song or album for public presentation or commercial remixing wary wildly.[12]\n\nThe effort required to obtain a license to commercial distribute copies of an already-released work to consumers for private use is significantly more streamlined as a product of federal compulsory licensing requirements in Section 115(a)(1) of the Copyright Law. Per the statute:\n\nWhen phonorecords of a nondramatic musical work have been distributed to the public in the United States under the authority of the copyright owner, any other person, including those who make phonorecords or digital phonorecord deliveries, may, by complying with the provisions of this section, obtain a compulsory license to make and distribute phonorecords of the work. A person may obtain a compulsory license only if his or her primary purpose in making phonorecords is to distribute them to the public for private use, including by means of a digital phonorecord delivery.\n\nIn other words, once a song has been released publicly, anyone may compel the master-recording owner to issue them a license to further distribute the work to private consumers for their personal use, all in exchange for royalties. Section 115(c)(2) even specifies the exact royalties owed in exchange for a compulsory license, putting the fee at “either two and three-fourths cents, or one-half of one cent per minute of playing time or fraction thereof, whichever amount is larger.” As a result, the system for full-song distribution is generally orderly and consistent.\n\nSuch is not the case in the sampling market. Because the cost to sample a two- or three-second segment of a song would be negligible under the compulsory-licensing framework, because sampling often involves some manipulation of the segment, in violation of Section 115, and because the sampling market is relatively limited, volatile, and ad hoc, no common licensing regime exists for hip-hop artists looking to obtain the rights to use part of a particular song. In its place is a sort of licensing Wild West in which copyright-holders are often arbitrary and inconsistent, legal ownership of a particular recording is often difficult if not impossible to establish, one must negotiate individually with the respective owners of the composition and master-recording copyrights, and the costs of sampling a well-known artist can be prohibitively expensive.\n\nIn an interview, Kathleen Merrill, President of the Parker Music Group in Los Angeles and an experienced representative of artists seeking to obtain and negotiate distribution of sampling licenses, described the state of the sampling licensing regime as “pretty non-existent,” saying there were “basically no standards” for what artists can expect to pay or extract in negotiations for a sampled work. In many cases, established artists are willing to grant sampling licensing “for the cost of the paperwork,” regarding a young artist’s request for permission to use their work as flattering and respectable in an era of flagrant copyright infringement by consumers. However, because the right sample a song also requires legal clearance with the owner of the master recording, the cost to obtain a sample is often control of the resulting work.\n\nMajor labels or copyright accumulators, such as Bridgeport Music, have little interest in inspiring the creative spirit beyond its potential to reap future profits. Because of a several precedent-setting court decisions on the nature of sampling law over the past two decades, and specifically Grand Upright and Bridgeport, prospective hip-hop artists have no choice but to negotiate, often with virtually no leverage, against experienced and unsympathetic industry executives or copyright hoarders. According to Merrill, a new artist seeking to sample almost any established artist’s tracks can expect to cede at least fifty percent ownership of the final product to the bearer of the master recording, in addition to a negotiated advance with the label or copyright-holder of several thousand dollars and an assortment of legal fees to complete the licensing transaction. Almost like selling one’s soul to the devil, the cost of popularizing one’s work may be the loss of it to Hollywood. Merrill said that federal rulings on the legality of sampling had, despite the Sixth Circuit’s prediction, only “muddied the waters.” “A lot of these decisions will be struck down,” she predicted. The laws “conflict with each other and with the copyright law,” she added. “It’s going to take years and we’ll have to look at the copyright statute itself.”[13]\n\nSection IV: An Appeal for Fair Use\n\nIn its oblivion toward the nature of hip-hop, the Sixth Circuit in Bridgeport asserted that financially limited sampling artists could reject excessive licensing fees by simply creating their own renditions of their desired works. The suggestion belied a fundamental misunderstanding not only of the musical nature of the genre but of its cultural roots and identity. To suggest that the principle intention of a hip-hop sampler seeking a particular track was to obtain an acoustically appealing beat even demonstrates a degree of disrespect for the artistic legitimacy of hip-hop.\n\nMany hip-hop artists satisfy themselves with appealing beats, and millions of their fans, many of them the wealthy concert-goers who lack any appreciation of the genre beyond the high-life image its biggest, and often most culturally isolated and distant, stars project. For those rappers, the B.o.B.s and Drakes of the music industry, licensing fees are no object and the desire to sample an old-school or even more-historic track is often mitigated by the far more lucrative prospects of collaborating with one another, often resulting in another instantiation of the hip-pop marriage that dominates Top 40 stations and has consistently earned strong ratings over the past decade.\n\nIn the midst of hip-hop’s movement away from its roots, are more traditional, and often more musically attentive, artists who recognize the capacity of a subsuming work to transform the nature of a sample, giving it new meaning in the context of a carefully constructed track.\n\nWhen a sampled clip is of a distinctly different genre, era, or mood than the sampler’s subsuming piece, tends to serve one of two roles: to identify the new piece, and often its artist, with the era or style of the sampled song, or to contrast ironically with the overall message or attitude of the subsuming work. The 2003 Black Eyed Peas hit “Shut Up” provides a particularly clear example of the first intention. The group loops the quintessentially funky beat of George Clinton’s 1979 song “(Not Just) Knee Deep), overlaying it with a minor-key violin melody and their own musical lyrics. As if to emphasize the Peas’ determination to give their song a funky vibe, band member apl.de.ap (Allan Pineda Lindo, Jr.) opens the “Shut Up” music video by conducting the violinists while wearing an exaggerated top hat and the sort of large, colorful suit popular in the late 1970s and ‘80s with funk musicians.\n\nIn contrast to the Peas’ effort to identify with Clinton’s legendary funk sound through a sampling of his beat, contemporary mega-rapper Kanye West liberally samples from an earlier work to provide ironic contrast with his own message in his 2005 Grammy-winning song “Diamonds from Sierra Leone.” West incorporates the 1971 Shirley Bassey song “Diamonds are Forever” in the track, several times repeating the eponymous chorus line without overlaying his own lyrics. The result is a song in which he contrasts Bassey’s subject’s materialistic love of diamonds with his own protest against the global gem market’s complicity in the blood-diamond atrocities of Sierra Leone’s Charles Taylor era.\n\nBoth roles for samples – as cultural homage and object of cynical contrast and derision – represent editorial commentary and artistic expression. In associating their own works with older songs, generally those of historically black-dominated genres, sampling hip-hop artists give tribute to that historical legacy. These samples become icons, representing their respective genres or affiliated subcultures. Far beyond a simple effort to use an appealing beat, samplers often use such well-known or genre-representative jazz, blues, or funk songs to lay claim to the legacy of their own genre’s stylistic predecessors and to convey a sense of cultural continuity between past and present.\n\n“Icon samplers” may seek to inspire a sense of nostalgia among their listeners, using iconic musical sounds to ground the new track, in listeners’ minds, in the sampled song’s home environment and era. To sample a blues record might remind the listener of Renaissance Harlem, while the use of an N.W.A. rap would psychologically establish a sampler’s work in the context of the Los Angeles ghettos of the early ‘90s. As a result, such “iconic sampling,” integrates not only the sampled song’s sound but also its theme and, to the extent one exists, artistic or political statement. Merely by its inclusion in the new song, the iconic sample acts as the sampler’s endorsement of the sample’s original artist and as an efficient vehicle with which to convey an artistic statement, often without requiring a single lyric. The sample becomes more a form of speech, even if light-hearted, than of auditory appeal; the artist fundamentally transforms the beat, melodic arrangement, or whole musical segment that comprises the sample into a second form of lyric.\n\nArtists whose samples of others’ work are carefully limited in content, represent a small minority of the sampler’s lyrics and melody, and demonstrably assist in communicating clearly apparent artistic, philosophical, or political expression deserve immunity from licensing requirements and royalties on fair-use grounds. In their capacity to transform the character of a chosen sample by incorporating it into their own hip-hop, such artists turn it into a vehicle for comment and criticism as required under the fair-use provision of the Copyright Law. Taking themselves with the seriousness demonstrated by musicians in many other genres, this socially conscious and artistically dedicated segment of the broader hip-hop community deserves to be regarded with equal seriousness by the law on the question of transformative fair use.\n\nTo that end, a proposal:\n\nCongress should institute a “Sentence Standard,” permitted artist to use very limited samples of others’ copyrighted work without the bureaucratic difficulties and prohibitive costs associated with the contemporary sample-licensing regime. Under the Sentence Standard, samples would be treated as artistic statements or commentary, in keeping with the fair-use standards of Section 107. The term “Sentence Standard” derives both from the intended brevity of license-exempted samples and the succinctness of their artistic expression, implying that the sample’s expression be no longer or more complex than a single, simple sentence. The lyrics of such license-exempted samples would be permitted, roughly, to express a single, brief, unsophisticated sentiment, such as Haddaway’s plea “Don’t hurt me” in Eminem’s “No Love” or Gilbert O’Sullivan’s “I’m alone again” in a more committed and developed version of Biz Markie’s eponymous rap. Longer selections, like the extended sample of Bassey’s “Diamonds are Forever,” would not be eligible for license exemption, as their inclusion substantively effects not only the editorial but also the aesthetic nature of the subsuming product. That distinction between editorial and aesthetic impact, coupled with firm restrictions on the length of an exempted sample, would be the key factor by which to determine the eligibility of a given sample.\n\nIn light of judicial erosions of de minimis and fair-use exemptions under existing copyright statute, and of the dysfunctional nature of a sample-licensing regime that ultimately restricts the public’s access to others’ artistic contributions, it is apparent that sampling law must be reformed. Given the distinct and inconsistent nature of the sample-licensing market, a compulsory licensing scheme would likely be economically inefficient, under-pricing extremely popular portfolios like George Clinton’s in a pay-by-the-second scheme while still potentially pricing the most earnest future hip-hop artists out of the market. Given the time limits imposed by the Sentence Standard on license-exempt samples, the public distribution of an included sample taken from a particular song would pose no competitive threat to the original composition; replaying a two-second sample one hundred times cannot replicate the pleasure of a strong three-minute single. If anything, a more liberal distribution of samples could help to draw public attention to those samples’ original works, with the samples functioning like teasers for their longer songs.\n\nThe dual legacy of Grand Upright Records, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Music Inc. and Bridgeport Music, Inc. v. Dimension Films, LLC has been one of needless complication and manipulation of the music industry at the cost of legitimate artistic expression and the public interest. Each decision’s respective judges would be wise to reconsider not only the technical language of the copyright statue but also the language of the document that authorized it. Per Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution, “The Congress shall have the Power… To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.” At its core, the purpose of the American copyright system is to promote human flourishing and intellectual development by creating strong incentives for intellectuals to contribute their ideas and efforts. As it stands today, the American copyright system fails to achieve that ultimate end by denying even the original composers of a work the ability to fully and independently permit others to build upon their work. Likewise, it denies access to a whole category of artistic and political expression, messages conveyed not always in words but also often in the context of music and general sound. With so little cost to original composers and other owners of their work, it is time for the United States to recognize the legitimacy of limited and regulated sampling as a form of genuine artistic expression.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBridgeport Music, Inc. v.

December 21, 2010.\n\nPunk, like other subcultures, aims to collapse traditional forms of meaning: safety pins are stripped of their utilitarian status and worn as grotesque ornaments; swastikas, a taboo emblem, are disassociated from Naziism, rendered meaningless (aside from the shock they provoke) and sewn onto leather jackets. Similarly, punk music selects a common, proletariat language (a musical structure that is directly appropriated from pop music) and subverts it to create a new language of youthful dissent. A minute but profound instance of this is the deliberate use and transformation of count-ins in punk songs.\n\nCount-ins generally appear before a song and are used to set the tempo and time signature in an ensemble. They began making their way into recorded music in the 1960’s with the rise of garage rock, a major precursor to punk. Garage bands were often made up of inexperienced young men and the count-in was essential in helping them start at the same time and keep tempo with each other in live performances, which were the only platform for these young bands. Once garage bands began releasing recorded music, the count-in made its auspicious debut, flouting the anti-ability and informality of their music. In “I Saw Her Standing There,” the opening song on The Beatles’ debut album, Paul McCartney (who can’t read music) rattles off a playful “1, 2, 3, 4!” which remained in the track because the producer wanted to create the immediacy of a live performance.\n\nWith the explosion of punk in 1977, the count-in revived its presence in recorded music as both an essential tool and purposeful signifier of inexperience. Johnny Ramone, albeit with more fervor, shouts out the same “1, 2, 3, 4!” heard in “I Saw Her Standing There.”\n\nTo begin to expand the use and eventual transformation of count-ins to a global context, Japan’s Guitar Wolf offers an excellent example of how easily musical phrases and styles are translated around the world.\n\nBesides adopting Ramones-esque dress, stance, attitude and monikers (members include Guitar Wolf, Bass Wolf and Drum Wolf) (0:00-0:20), Guitar Wolf also utilizes the familiar “1, 2, 3, 4!” (at 4:25) that begins at least 80% of Ramones songs. What’s particularly interesting about this count-in is that Guitar Wolf, who conducts themselves mostly in Japanese, shouts the numbers in English. This can be seen as using a familiar language with a pre-defined meaning and re-applying it to communicate your own ideas, such as legitimizing yourself as “punk music” through the use of the count-in.\n\nAfter the initial stale recycling of the predictable “1, 2, 3, 4!” count-in, punk bands began transforming the count-in through the misuse of language (a particularly offensive act), infusing them with a tone that reflected the spirit of punk, and eventually becoming playfully self-aware of their use of the count-in.\n\nThe earliest instances of the deconstruction of traditional count-ins are characterized by a jumbling of numbers and languages. Chainsaw shows this through their simple, nonsensical count-in of “1, 2, 5, 7, 8!” before their cover (in English!) of Velvet Underground’s “What Goes On.”\n\nThis stylization, like count-ins themselves, derive from the practices of punks’ pre-punk garage brethren, as heard in Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs’ “Wooly Bully,” which mixes English and Spanish numbers.\n\nSimilarly, an Italian band with a curiously German-derived name, Hitler SS starts their song “Slave” off by blending German and Japanese (“Eins, Zwei, Drei, Bonsai!”). This scrambling of geographic references is both unnerving and silly, which are usually two of the main goals of punk music.\n\nThis absurd misuse and transformation of the count-in was not always without purpose though, as seen in Joy Division’s “Warsaw.” The number shouted in the beginning (“3, 5, 0, 1, 2, 5, Go!”) is a prisoner of war serial number for Rudolph Hess, a Nazi officer with a controversial role in World War II. The song then goes on to give a (rough) biographical account of Hess’ life.\n\n“Warsaw” begins the trend of punk count-ins, which had already strayed from their strictly utilitarian purpose in garage music, once again becoming functional, but in a more complicated, evocative way. Count-ins began to not even feature numbers, but instead words that allowed for infinitely more interpretations. Early incarnations of this idea can be heard in Wire’s “12XU,” which opens with a count-in baring the same name.\n\nThe incorporation of a song’s title in the count-in is, like the count-in itself, a holdover from punk’s reliance on live performances, as shouting the song title would cue the audience (and sometimes even the other band members) into what song was about to be played. To show it’s persistence over the course of 30 years, Nobunny’s “Mess Me Up” is another great example of this:\n\nLe Tigre takes this idea even further, not incorporating the song title at all, but instead proclaiming “He took the bomb,” before launching into a Devo-esque deadpan repetition of a few synthy chords.\n\nIt’s important to keep in mind though, that just as one giveth, one can taketh away; thought count-ins gained the ability to embody deeper meaning, they could very easily regress back into nonsense. The Offspring (who, after producing the highest-selling album on an independent label, became a little more mainstream in their sound, but not in their spirit) demonstrates this return to absurdity in their (mis)use of a phrase taken from the beginning of a Def Leppard song. “Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)” begins with a nasally, inane utterance of “Gunter glieben glauchen globen,” a German-inspired, nonsensical expression.\n\nBesides the extensive mishandling of language in count-ins, punk bands also imbued count-ins with very distinct attitudes that embodied the boredom, frustration and rebellion of punk music. An early instance of this is in The Stooges’ (pre-punk pioneers) “Raw Power,” which begins with Iggy Pop foregoing the effort of shouting numbers or words and instead spitting out a guttural grunt.\n\nThis stylization carried directly over to punk, as heard in Blondie’s “Living in the Real World,” which bitterly criticizes conforming to an average life of marriage, kids and a 9-5 job. This fear is rampant in the punk community and is reflected perfectly in drummer Billy O’Conner’s screams that gradually build up to an explosive “1, 2, 3, 4!”\n\nReflecting some of punk's more visceral frustration is Big Black’s “Passing Complexion,” which starts with an abrasive “1, 2, 1, 2, FUCK YOU!” and then assaults the listener with a barrage of ting-y, repetitive riffs that is no doubt the soundtrack to falling on a bed of nails..repeatedly.\n\nMost of the time however, punks aren’t as severe and serious in their offensiveness as Big Black’s Steve Albini. Since it’s mainly a youth subculture, punk is often playful and has the ability to take a good-humored approach to itself and its predecessors. This is also aptly reflected in punk count-ins as bands began to ironically self-reference the once-innocuous count-in. This further stylization can be heard in Flipper’s “Nothing,” which starts with “OK, 1..wait, everybody start at the same time, ok? 1, 2, 3, 4!”\n\nNot only are punk bands including the count-in to reference their anti-ability, but they are now commenting on their use of the count-in as a hallmark of informality (meta, huh?). Even more puzzling and exciting is the exploitation of this self-irony by the Yeah Yeah Yeah’s, whose members are conservatory-trained in jazz (Brian Chase) and a self-proclaimed violin “child prodigy” (Nick Zinner). Punk bands that no longer feel the need to tout their anti-ability and are actually advanced musicians are still using the count-in, not for its utilitarian purposes, but to tie themselves to punks’ roots and legitimize their musical endeavors.\n\nOnce a self-referential language is adopted, one is able to advance the creative stylizations of their art and redefine what their language signifies. This can be seen in the abundance of genre-bending punk covers (Punkin Pie’s “Bone Digger,” which covers Paul Simon’s “You Can Call Me Al,” or Thee Headcoatees’ “Don’t Wanna Hold Your Hand,” which playfully distorts The Beatles’ “I Wanna Hold Your Hand”) or Black Flag’s bold re-working of what a “punk” looks like by growing their hair long and wearing Dockers. This same spirit of constantly redefining the sound, language and aesthetics of punk through referencing (and consequently tearing down) one’s idols and influences is also reflected in punk count-ins. The Discocks’ (Japanese) “Voice of Youth” (along with many other songs) shows this in their incorporation of the count-in into the chorus, transforming it into an agentive, rallying cry.\n\nThe most extreme and advanced incarnation of the count-in can be heard in Cornelius’ (also Japanese) “Count Five or Six,” a song whose backbone is created by the robotic repetition of “1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6” throughout the entire song. Near the middle though, effectively playing with our expectations, the numbers begin to stop before 6, get mixed up, repeated and sped up.\n\nThe fantastic evolution and continuous redefinition of why a count-in is used and what it signifies echoes the same transformations occurring throughout the trajectory of punk music. It’s amazing that something that takes up no more time than a few seconds can carry such heavy implications, but through the in-depth study of the intersection of music, sound and culture, it becomes more apparent that seemingly minute occurrences such as count-ins manage to cross borders of time and place and come to mean something truly astounding.\n\nSpanglish Rap: Code-switching Nyoricans\n\nHip-hop is one of the few cultural phenomena that has been translated and re-appropriated within hundreds of varying cultures. Although American hip-hop often sets the tone for what appears globally within hip-hop culture, hip-hop is no longer solely attached to its American roots. Hundreds of countries have copied and transformed hip-hop culture into their own unique versions. Graffiti, break dancing, rapping and DJing are each a unique and integral part of hip-hop culture. Of these four main hip-hop arts only one significantly shows the breath and depth of the cultural re-appropriation hip-hop has experienced around the world.\n\nRapping if one of the few musical phenomena that has a truly global presence. Rap can be heard in almost every language and seen on every continent. Rap is so ubiquitous throughout the world due to its accessibility, ease of creation and ease of adaptation. American rap music is widely circulated throughout the world. Rappers such as The Notorious B.I.G, Tupac Shakur, and the Wu-Tang Clan are widely recognized in countries ranging from Cuba to Pakistan. Furthermore rapping is so prevalent because it is the easiest form of hip-hop to come to learn and embrace. Rap in its most basic form does not require any specialized equipment, art supplies, or lessons. People can simply begin writing rhymes over simple beats that they hear or make. In addition, the lyrical content of a rap song is totally up to its creator. This is the foremost reason for rap music’s global popularity. Rap music can be adapted to fit within the constraints of various religious affiliations, languages, socioeconomic classes and cultural norms. For example, rappers in Muslim countries do not rap about drugs, exploiting women or Allah out of observance of their religion. The lyrics, methodology and style of a rap song are highly reflective of an artist’s experience.\n\nIn recent years the culture and content of American rap music has been seemingly streamlined due to the popularity of mainstream artists. It is often forgotten that like American culture, rap music is still growing. In the past twenty to thirty years’ multilingual rappers have carved out a small niche in the American rap music scene. The concurrent use of multiple languages is often referred to as code-switching.[1] Many multilingual rap artists in America rap in both Spanish and English. At first glance, multilingual rap may be viewed simply as a way to appeal to a wider audience. But after much exploration I have found that multilingual rap is much more than this. Multilingual rap is a shining example of a recent cultural re-appropriation of rap music within America.\n\nDJ Tony Touch is a Puerto-Rican American rapper; break dancer and hip-hop DJ hailing from Brooklyn, New York. Born Joseph Anthony Hernandez in 1969[2], DJ Tony Touch began his career in hip-hop as a break-dancer. In the late 1980’s DJ Tony Touch performed with a local hip-hop coalition named the Rock Steady Crew. The Rock Steady crew is a consortium of rappers and break-dancers originally from New York City. Towards the mid 1990’s DJ Tony Touch soon moved his way into DJing and turntablism. DJ Tony Touch rose to fame producing a myriad of rap mixtapes that included many famous artists such as The Wu-Tang Clan, Mos Def, KRS-One, Big Daddy Kane and Wyclef Jean. In the late 1990’s, DJ Tony Touch began rapping himself. His music is quite unique given the fact that DJ Tony Touch raps in both Spanish and English. The language he uses within his raps is often referred to as Spanglish. Furthermore his music mixes traditional Latin musical elements with more general hip-hop aesthetics.\n\nOne of DJ Tony Touch’s most famous song is entitled Dimelo. Dimelo is a Spanish slang meaning, “tell me” or “What’s up?” In the song, “Dimelo” is used in the chorus of the song, in a call and responses format. The background singer chants “Que tu quiere huh? Dimelo!”.\n\nThis song begins with a waning trumpet and a simple conga beat very reminiscent of traditional salsa music. The following example shows the similarities this song has with more traditional Latin music. This song is entitled Amor Para mi by Ramon Orlando and its opening sequence showcases the congas and horns DJ Tony Touch was obviously influenced by.\n\nIn his song, DJ Tony Touch can be heard switching effortlessly between Spanish and English. About halfway through his first verse, he inserts a Spanish phrase that works effortlessly in this song.\n\n“They hardly got their feet wet\n\nme I get respect\n\neast west, they be like he's fresh\n\npredelo\n\naqui esta tú papo me muelve yo\n\nim knockin' crews out they shoes\n\noh gee homes pay lots of dues”[3]\n\nDJ Tony Touch’s use of Spanish in this song fits the metrical scheme of the lyrics. The intonation and cadence of his Spanish doesn’t seem to throw off the flow of the song. Furthermore, the underlying beat of the song is an obvious nod to his Latin heritage.\n\nThe following track is another example of DJ Tony Touch’s multilingual rapping style. This song is entitled Spanish Harlem by the Cocoa Brovaz. On this track DJ Tony Touch makes a guest appearance in the intro as well as the 1st verse.\n\nThis song is a more traditional hip-hop track and lacks the underlying Latin music influences. This is due in large part because DJ Tony Touch is only guest starring on this track made by the Cocoa Brovaz. During DJ Tony Touches verse, you can clearly hear him interjecting various Spanish words and colloquialisms. This track stands in opposition to my first example in regards to the amount of Spanish used. In the 1st track, DJ Tony Touch raps mostly in English but interjects a complete Spanish sentence. While in the second track, he merely sparingly inserts Spanish words almost as lyrical accents. A transcription of his verse from Spanish Harlem can be seen below.\n\n“It's Tony Toca, the one that's got you screaming \"Esta loca\"\n\ndalle juevo Is my mic Leggo my Eggo\n\nSpanish Harlem all the way to San Diego\n\nmake it happen\n\nyou know, like movin yayo\n\ni set my product, that shit's far from narcotics\n\nmantequilla not manteco oh senso mia\n\ncocoa brovaz, hurricane, mida mida\n\nton touch sound doofy eatin fajitas\n\nchillin in the b-boy stance “\n\nin my Adidas\n\nwhile senoritas be screaming Buenos Dias\n\nrock steady by now you know the steelo\n\nmi correo still gets down on the leelo\n\ntahino indians welcome to my teepi. “[4]\n\nThe overarching questions I sought answers to in my research of this cultural re-appropriation of hip-hop in America were how and why. How did multilingual rappers such as DJ Tony Touch rap in Spanish? And why did they choose to do so? Rapping in Spanish is actually much easier than rapping in English. The lexicon available to Spanish speakers is actually much larger than English speakers. Spanish is a non-monotonic language. A monotonic language lacks intonation when spoken. Many languages are monotonic and this greatly inhibits artists’ ability to rap in them. For example, Japanese is a strictly monotonic language. Japanese’ rappers have come to create a new language of words containing stresses and varying intonations. Spanish words are often stressed in specific places denoted by a stress mark, but the language allows for that stress to be placed wherever need be. This is due in large part to the variety of Spanish accents there are. Spanish spoken by a native of Spain sounds much different than that spoken by a native of Mexico.\n\nSpanish is also an inflected language. Inflection is the changing of a word’s ending to indicate a change in grammatical usage.[5] The Spanish language also contains many words with similar cadences and endings. This allows for a great deal of flexibility in rhyming and word choice when rapping in Spanish. For example in the beginning of his first verse in Dimelo, DJ Tony Touch says “ Prendelo”. The word prendelo actually has three different meanings in Spanish depending on its context and endings. Prendelo can mean to turn something off or on, (i.e. the lights), to carry something or to be arrested by the police. In these lyrics it means to turn something on. In addition, the lack of steadfast grammatical syntax allows for people rapping in Spanish to arrange their lyrics in a manner that best fits the beat. For example in English, the subject has to come first in a sentence, while in Spanish the subject of the sentence is subsequently understood in the verb ending and can come much later. The grammar and syntax of Spanish makes it a language that is very easy to rap in. This is why multilingual rapper such as DJ Tony Touch finds it so easy to switch back and forth between English and Spanish.\n\nDJ Tony Touch’s multilingual rap style is reflective of his bi-lingual upbringing in New York City. Most 2nd and 3rd generation Puerto-Rican Americans in New York City speak both Spanish and English. As of 2000 an estimated 2 million Puerto-Ricans live in New York City and the adjoining burrows.[6] This is said to be the largest population of Puerto-Rican Americans outside of Puerto Rico. This large concentration of Puerto-Rican American in New York City is largely attributed to the passage of the Jones-Shafroth Act. The Jones-Shafroth act was passed on March 2nd, 1917 and made all Puerto Ricans US citizens.[7] This lead to a large and steady influx of Puerto-Ricans into New York City and the surrounding areas during the 1940’s, 50’s and 60’s. Many Puerto-Ricans from New York City refer to themselves a Nyoricans, in order to distinguish themselves from actually natives of Puerto Rico. [8]There is a strong Puerto-Rican community throughout New York City and DJ Tony Touch’s music is reflective of that. DJ Tony Touch’s effortless code-switching can be greatly attributed to his bi-lingual upbringing and desire to represent the experience of Puerto-Rican Americans in New York City.\n\nIn conclusion, Spanish English code-switching is a great example of cultural re-appropriation of rap music within America. Rap can be transformed to tell a variety of stories in myriad of manners. In addition, the adaptation of the Spanish language so that its rhythmic pattern and intonation and general flow fit within the mainstream aesthetic of rap music is the driving force behind rap music creativity and evolution today. Rappers such as DJ Tony Touch, often discover new ways to portray their culture and experience through rap. Though the process is not as always easy as with multilingual rappers, the final product is sonically and lyrically beautiful nonetheless.\n\n[1] Coffey, Heather. “Code-Switching”.

As such, he is an artist that successfully establishes a point of sonic compatibility between religion and culture that makes his music authentic and real at its root.\n\nBorn in 1979 as Matthew Miller, Matisyahu grew up in White Plains New York as a Reconstructionist Jew. He attended Hebrew School a couple times a week while also finding time to organize Jam sessions with his friends where he would beat box and explore his creative limits among various genres. A trip to Israel and a stay at the Alexandra Muss High School when he was 16, inspired him to become more dedicated to Judaism. It was this trip in fact, that influenced his decision to become a Hasidic Jew in 2001. To this day, he keeps his religious dedication intact while simultaneously pursuing his passion for music, more often than not, by combining the two. “Before I was religious, to me music was soul.” He said, “I looked at the world through the lens of whatever CD I was listening to. In Judaism, there's another type of food for the soul, another type of spiritual sustenance that comes through the mitzvahs and Torah learning. In Judaism, praying and learning what you love to learn changes the lens that you have without using something external.” (Rohr Chabad House Stanford)\n\nThe world of music is somewhat shrinking due to the vast number mediascapes propelling music across cultural and national boarders. As a result, artists from different cultures are given the opportunity to dip their toe into several genres of music and create an innovative sound by way of fusion. Matisyahu is an artist that adapted the use of cultural fusion in music. The two most prominent sonic and stylistic elements of Matisyahu’s music come from Rastafarian and Jewish influences. Matisyahu fuses the contemporary styles of rap, beat-boxing and hip-hop, with the more traditional vocal disciplines of jazz's scat singing and Judaism's hazzan style of soulful prayer—more often than not rolling it all into a dominant background of reggae music with its signature Dem bow beat.\n\nThis track, Ancient Lullaby, was released in 2006 on his album “Youth”. Listen to the Reggae melodic plays, the Dem Bow beat and Matisyahu’s Jamaican inflected accent.\n\nAt 3:05 the song becomes strictly percussion, drum element, melodic style/guitar drops out.\n\nMatisyahu credits his music to influences by Bob Marley, Phish, God Street Wine, Rabbi Shiomo Carlebach. And book: Toward a Meaningful Life by Rabbi Simon Jacobson for the lyrical inspiration to Youth’s title track.\n\nWith its heavy rock beat and the absence of an accent this song, “So High, So Low” (2009) shows a different side of Matisyahu’s versatility.\n\nListen to the vocal discrepancy between the beginning and the middle (around 1:20) when his accent comes back in…also notice that in this more recent album, the Jewish/religious aspect is not there.\n\nWith so much versatility in his music, even among individual tracks themselves, his music can sound a bit synthetic and sampled at times. However I believe his music is authentic in the way he structures and layers the Dem bow bass, rap lyrics and melodic Reggae fragments in his tracks.\n\n“Escape” (2009)\n\nSignature Reggae beat.\n\nAfter listening to the tracks, one has to wonder, why the reggae component? Why combine Reggae with the Jewish religion? Matisyahu's rise to fame raises a series of questions about the visual and sonic influence of race, religion and cultural appropriation in music. Essentially, his music is judgment of authenticity. Mark Fink from Paste Magazine claims, “much of the controversy I know of stems from the traditional Jewish community who question the authenticity of his observance level, or if he became more religious as a way to legitimize and market his music.”(2) With this in mind, a lot of artists who become popular have the habit of becoming lost and conforming to a more mainstream sound in order to stay in the limelight. Fame and notoriety can sometimes limit an artists ability to year off the sound that they became famous for and their music can become too safe and consistent. However, Matisyahu was not and still is not into following the mainstream and going with the flow. For he refuses to be a slave to a genre or a sound….to be confined to a category of music. “Breaking out of slavery is definitely a theme in my music. We are so busy being influenced by money, by society, by external pressures, that our true identity and abilities can be hidden.”(3) With the garb-black hat, tzitzis and beard that accompany his Jamaican-inflected accent, he combines elements of Reggae with religious references of Judaism in his music that creates sonic and cultural tension. It is this tension that sets him apart from other mainstream artists who create a more generic, sampled, commercial ‘sounds exactly like this other song’ sound.\n\nFrom a religious standpoint, his music truly is authentic. Both Rastafarianism and Judaism claim figures from the Old Testament as their forefathers, both speak of Zion, both send a message of truth and love to their followers. Rastafarians even claim to be descended from the children of Israel. Rastafarianism is a religious movement that came out of Jamaica. It is not a highly organized religion; it is a movement and an ideology. Many Rastas say that it is not a \"religion\" at all, but a \"Way of Life\". Today, awareness of the Rastafari movement has spread throughout much of the world, largely through interest generated by reggae music; the sonic backbone of Matisyahu’s music. And from a melodic standpoint, the minor-key melodies of reggae aren't so far removed from the melodies Matisyahu would have heard, and sung, when he attended the Carlebach Shul, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. On the whole, Matisyahu’s music draws from two very concrete and compatible religious sources.\n\nI think the vast majority of people that respect what he does are in it for the message or the idea expressed through almost every song in his albums. Matisyahu himself has claimed something similar when, in a recent interview with Rolling Stone, he said, \"In any Bob Marley song, you hear lots of powerful quotes from the Torah,\"(6) and added that it was reggae's recurring references to Jewish symbols that first attracted him to the genre. The message of “truth” and “love” that reggae music sends to its followers are echoed throughout the majority of Matisyahu’s lyrics and even in his track names, “Motivate”, “Youth”, “One Day”, “Dispatch the Troops”.\n\nMatisyahu also incorporates elements of hip hoop into his music, primarily in rhythmic and lyrical plays. This nature of incorporating various message oriented subgenres into music as means to deliver a message reminds me a lot of how Mot de Passe in “I love hip-hop in Morocco” incorporated French into her rap even though most of the people listening to her spoke Arabic. She built her own path of rap and veered off of mainstream Moroccan rap so she could “make it” and place herself in her own category. Matisyahu used hip-hop and reggae to do the same and incorporate religion into his music. As such, he liberates himself from being a “phony” copycat in a genre.\n\nThis interview draws on Matisyahu’s social consciousness what kind of music he provides for his fans and why it can be unique for them.\n\nHis music gives us an opportunity to explore how fusion influences fan base. How is it that he is so successful when his music is so controversial, who resonates with his music? How does the culturally layered quality of his music influence his fan base? Matisyahu’s fan base spans an extraordinary spectrum of cross-generational multi-faith fans: “girls in trashy spaghetti strap tank tops; yeshiva boys with their tzitzit (ritual fringes), a goodly sprinkling of middle aged hippies”(4)…etc. His music is sonically familiar to many different types of people who may recognize the broken Jamaican accent and the various “foreign” sounding instruments that are associated with various genre stereotypes. The fans can find something about his music that resonates with them even if they do not understand the cultural significance behind it. Seeing as his music is not strictly reggae nor is it strictly religious, it is easy for people from different cultural and religious backgrounds to relate to it…to find a part of it that resonates with them. It also relates back to the desire fans have to experience something exotic…to be a part of a religious ecstasy that issues through his music.\n\nI think it's because they see that he is “doing his thing”. While many artists have gotten sonically lazy, with exceeding samples and auto-tuning every pitch Matisyahu wins a personal space for himself in the industry by \"doing you,\" like the hip hop phrase \"do you do you.\" It's really about doing you.\n\nReferences:\n\n(1) http://chabadstanford.org/article.htm?MM_on_Hassidic_Reggae_Superstar-101\n\n- Rohr Chabad House at Stanford, Jewish Student center\n\n(2) http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2009/08/matisyahu-light.html\n\n(3) http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/376771/jewish/Matisyahus-Passover.htm\n\n(4)http://www.ou.org/index.php/shabbat_shalom/article/4204/: OU.org\n\n(5) http://www.scaruffi.com/history/reggae.html\n\n(6) http://blog.horizonrecords.net/2009/10/17/matisyahu-plays-here-live-thursday-nov-12-at-6pm/\n\nCalifornia Meets...\n\nEstradasphere is an eclectic rock band which draws on various global sounds to create their music. They describe their music through invented genres such as “Bulgarian Surf”, “Romanian Gypsy-Metal” and “Spaghetti Eastern”. However, at its core is a “Gypsy Jazz” ensemble, consisting of a guitarist, violinist, and bassist, with a drummer and saxophonist adding additional layers to songs. The members are all graduates of California’s university system where they met, and display an educated awareness of the issues involved with global sounds and their transmission. This is best demonstrated through their respect of origins of their global sound sources.\n\n...France or Romania?\n\nSince the core of the band is a Gypsy Jazz ensemble, this is the most obvious global sound that Estradasphere draws on in the creation of their music. Gypsy Jazz arose in Paris in the 1930‘s. It was started by Romanian immigrants to France who played in the French capital. Not only does Estradasphere draw on a global sound to create their music, but the source itself is a result of the shifting ethnoscapes which characterize and create global sounds.\n\nNo one is more associated with Gypsy Jazz than Django Reinhardt. Despite the fact that his left hand was crippled in a fire, rendering his pinkie and ring finger useless, Reinhardt is a guitar virtuoso. Since Reinhardt is the best known performer of, and often credited with starting, the Gypsy Jazz style of music, he is the best example of what that style is. As such, he is useful for comparing to Estradasphere in demonstrating their respecting of origins.\n\nReinhardt’s “Minor Swing” is characterized sonically by a violin over rhythmic guitar chords. This combination is reproduced in Estradasphere’s song “The Return (Unplugged)”. Both have the guitar setting the rhythm with a violin leading over it interspersed with virtuoso caliber finger work on the guitar. This similarity shows that Estradasphere is aware of and respects the origins from which it draws sound. While the comparison is most obvious in this particular set of songs, it is very common to hear strains of Gypsy Jazz throughout the entire Estradasphere catalog.\n\nRomania.\n\nGypsy Jazz is one of the major components of Estradasphere’s global sound, but there are other sources of inspiration which play as important of a role in their overall sound. Like Gypsy Jazz, most of these sources can be traced back to Eastern Europe. One of the finest examples of Estradasphere drawing on Eastern European musical styles, is their song “Hora Bucharestu vs Narodno Kolo”.\n\n“Hora Bucharestu vs. Narodno Kolo” in addition to providing an excellent example of Estradasphere’s global sound sources, is also a commentary on mash-ups. Mash-ups take two or more songs and overlay them in a coherent manner to create a new piece of music. Typically this involves popular songs which have already proven appealing in the mass media market. However, in Estradasphere’s case, a majority of the song is composed of two pieces of traditional Eastern European music.\n\nWhile there is slight tweaking of the traditional music’s spelling in Estradasphere’s song title, it is not a significant enough of a change prevent anyone curious enough to investigate from discovering the origins of the source material. A Hora is a traditional dance and the associated music which originated in the Balkans. It is especially common in Romania and Bulgaria and also is the national dance of Israel. Since Bucharestu follows Hora in the title, it is clear that the specific Hora that Estradasphere is drawing on originated in Romania. Like a traditional Hora, this song is performed with guitars, violins, saxophones, and contrabasses. Estradasphere once again respects the origins of its source material by performing this folk music with traditional instruments, though it does lack an accordion which is a staple instrument of Romanian Horas.\n\nNarodna muzika means folk music in the Bosnian, Bulgarian, Serbian and Macedonian languages. It is a traditional music originating in the Balkans as well. Likewise for Kolo, which is a folk music and dance native to Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia.\n\nPop and Ethnomusicology? Gotta Keep 'em Seperated!\n\nOddly enough, sandwiched between these two pieces of folk music is a brief interlude featuring two pop songs: “Walk Like An Egyptian” by The Bangles, and “Come Out And Play” by The Offspring. While the pop songs seem quite out of place at first, it seems as to be that Estradasphere is using the juxtaposition to provide a commentary on mash-ups. To understand what that commentary is, it is useful to examine their choice of pop songs more closely.\n\n“Walk Like An Egyptian” was a hit in 1986 in the United States and had a gimmicky dance associated with it. The song and dance relies upon the cliché of how humans are depicted on ancient Egyptian monuments. This stands in stark contrast to Estradasphere’s nuanced approach to drawing on global sources when composing their music.\n\nThe inclusion of The Offspring’s “Come Out And Play” includes the only lyrics in the mash-up: “You gotta keep ‘em separated”. The inclusion of these lyrics and only these lyrics is significant. It can be read as a commentary by Estradasphere. The band is stating that in order to have successful pop music, one has to separate global sounds from their origins, and in the process reduce it to a cliché. Estradasphere does not do this themselves and in doing so have chosen to reduce their chances for fame and commercial success to that of a cult following. In this way, not only does Estradasphere respect the origins of the global sounds they draw on, but use a pop song to provide a clever comment on those who do not.\n\nIf there are any doubts to listeners that Estradasphere is providing a commentary on those who use global sounds without respecting origins, they would be removed with a close listening of the song “Spreading the Disease”. This song is poking fun at the World Music genre. It contains all the clichés of a New Age World Music song such as something the World Music band Deep Forest would perform. The song has the effect of lulling a listener into a state of relaxation, only to blast their ear drums with heavy distorted guitar and thundering drums. The entire song is very tongue in cheek. They lyrics and the inflection the vocalist takes on demonstrates the mocking tone of the song. However, it is Estradasphere’s title that is perhaps the best evidence of the tongue in cheek nature. By including a New Age World Music song on their album and naming it “Spreading the Disease” they are saying that World Music is a disease and their performance helps it spread (this however is another tongue in cheek comment. The performance is mocking the disease not spreading it).\n\nCalifornia Meets Romania Meets Japan\n\nIn addition to Eastern Europe, Japan has also strongly influenced the band, especially through video games. Two excellent examples of this influence are the songs “Cloud Land” and “Super Buck II”. They demonstrate how Japan is another global sound source for Estradasphere.\n\n“Cloud Land” emulates the sonic qualities of an 8-bit video game such as those found on the Nintendo Entertainment System. The flat electronic music would sound right at home on any cartridge based video game. The title itself is a reference to the popular Super Mario Bros. series of games, which often featured a cloud based levels.\n\nNot only do they emulate the sound of older video games, but on their album “Buck Fever”, they take an easily recognizable video game song and reimagine it thought the lens of a distinctly American style of music: jazz.\n\nThe song “Super Buck II” is a jazz arrangement of the main theme from the popular 1988 video game Super Mario Bros. II. The song title is very similar to the video game’s title, except “Mario Bros.” has been replaced with “Buck”, a reference to the Estradasphere album it appears on, “Buck Fever”. Here Estradasphere takes the theme music and gives it their own uniquely American spin. Jazz has been called one of the few original American art forms, and it provides an interesting juxtaposition when placed into the context of global sounds. The results not only show Estradasphere’s Japanese influence, but also show their ability to mix cultures to produce a truly global sound.\n\nSo What?\n\nSo what do all these examples that Estradasphere provides tell us about global sounds? It shows us that there is a right way and a wrong way to make music which draws on global sounds. The wrong way is exemplified by groups like Deep Forest and The Bangles, who respectively appropriate various global sounds and mash them together without respecting origins to form a World Music paste, or who only draw from stereotypes and cultural clichés. It is irresponsible in the sense that they are not presenting authentic representations of cultures and lead people into accepting stereotypes and clichés as authentic.\n\nConversely, Estradasphere exemplifies a more responsible use of global sounds. When they use traditional music, they pay attention to origins and display a high degree of artistic integrity by not only faithfully reproducing global sounds, but by producing music which is conscientious of the issues surrounding global sounds. They mock those who create inauthentic world music.\n\nWith world music in the Deep Forest and Bangles camp, listeners are exposed to various ethnic representations which are clichéd or inauthentic. This is done in an attempt to appeal to all tastes and produce a commercially successful product. The result is a product which is inauthentic and perpetuates the stereotypes.\n\nEstradasphere style world music on the other hand, proudly displays its origins and respects them in the performance of their music. There is also an obvious element of artistic commentary present. When Estradasphere juxtaposes Eastern European folk music with a cliché based “ethnic” song like “Walk Like an Egyptian”, they are showing the absurdity of cultural clichés like the laughable Hieroglyphic inspired dance.\n\nListeners who still have doubts about the global nature of Estradasphere’s sound are encouraged to consider the label a majority of their albums have been released on, Web of Mimicry. Web of Mimicry was started by guitarist Trey Spruance. Spruance’s own band, Secret Chiefs 3 is an American band with music inspired by Sufi mysticism and contains elements of Middle Eastern musical modes combined with American styles such as surf rock and heavy metal. A great example of this can be sound in their song \"Jabalqa\" which uses a musical scale native to the middle east combined with technoesque drums. As the record label’s name suggests, Spruance is interested in bands that mimic regional sounds.\n\nAnother example of a Web of Mimicry band who utilizes global sounds would be Dengue Fever, an American band with a lead vocalist who sings in Khmer. Dengue Fever is named after a disease which is found only in tropical regions such as Southeast Asia. They draw on Southeast Asian sounds in the composition of their music. They also have at one point covered an Ethiopian Jazz musician’s composition, further demonstrating the global sources of not only Dengue Fever’s sound, but that of the Web of Mimicry label as a whole.\n\nTL;DR\n\nTo summarize, Estradasphere, and the Web of Mimicry label as a whole represent the responsible use of global sounds. This stands in contrast to the way pop bands or “World Music” bands use global sounds, which is typically irresponsible and full of cultural stereotypes. The respect of origins, along with the artistic criticism of those who don’t, demonstrate Estradasphere’s responsible use of global sounds.\n\n“My musical journeys have reminded me\n\nthat the interactions brought about by globalization\n\ndon’t just destroy culture; they can create new culture\n\nand invigorate and spread traditions that have existed for ages.” – YO-YO MA\n\nThe word “globalization” often elicits two very different reactions. Some embrace its ability to facilitate both world-wide access to different cultures and ideas and opportunities for innovation resulting from this openness. Others decry globalization as a malicious force that destroys civilizations by relabeling everything and everyone in a single (Western) guise. Cellist Yo-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble (founded in 1998), have tried to bypass these two extremes through exploring musical traditions from along the famed Silk Road, the trading route that spanned the Eurasian continent for nearly two millennia and an example of globalization before our time. The Ensemble’s vision is to strike a careful balance between combining different musical cultures to create interesting new works while still remaining faithful—musically and otherwise—to original traditions (“The Silk Road at a Glance”). One way in which the Ensemble seeks to accomplish this goal is through commissioning pieces, such as Shane Shanahan’s Night at the Caravanserai.[1] The main melody of Shanahan’s work utilizes modal and melodic concepts from Persian classical music as a sonic building block to provide this melody with a clear modal and melodic structure, while the numinous flute section references the mystic musical traditions and styles of the ney and shakuhachi to establish the registers in which both instruments perform and their respective rhythms. In both parts of the song, the arrangement of Persian melodic ideas and instrumentation and the creation of new themes for the flutes evidence Shanahan’s own compositional stamp on this music. These new elements, however, neither overwhelm nor show Shanahan straying far from the musical principles and histories he employs. The percussion section lends the song much unity with its constant presence, preventing listeners from getting lost throughout most of the piece. However, the biggest problem with Night lies in one particular transition section, which does not adequately link two very distinct parts of the piece, and, therefore, the musical traditions within them, thus failing to give the song as much unity as it could have had.\n\nThe various sounds that Shanahan draws upon originated in countries along the Silk Road, a trade route that developed as early as 138 B.C., when the Chinese first started producing silk and then distributing it westward. The route came to be used for trading other goods as well as religions, ideas, and music between modern-day Turkey and modern-day Japan. The railroad made the route effectively obsolete but not until the beginning of the 20th century. Thus, when discussing the Silk Road, we are dealing with an enormous historical, geographic, political, and religious context, nearly two thousand years of history in which Rome would fall, Islam would rise, and a plethora of empires and states would come and go, as the map in Fig I below evidences (“The Silk Road”; \"Maps of the Silk Road\") . The Silk Road itself was obviously not the only trade route crisscrossing Eurasia for 1800 years. Rather, it become integrated into a much broader “single international trade system” that comprised both land and sea routes (Beckwith XX). Dotted along this system were caravanserais, small roadside inns that provided shelter and food for travelers and their animals between towns. These generally consisted of square buildings with a central courtyard for camels and others beasts to rest in, with baths and housing for the human travelers around the courtyard. The choice of title for our song, Night at the Caravanserai, references these structures as location where people from many different places would have gathered, if only for a night. The caravanserais thus symbolizes the Silk Road Ensemble’s goals, as places “[w]here strangers meet,” to quote one of their album titles, where ideas and musics were traded, though the extent to which the kind of cross-cultural exchange actually occurred in the inns is debatable (“Consider”).\n\nLet’s now examine more specifically those musical traditions from along the Silk Road that feature most prominently in the sections of Night we will analyze later. The first of these musics is that of Persia, modern-day Iran. Music that can be called “classical Persian” was first developed during the reign of the Sassanian dynasty, from the second to the seventh century A.D. The Islamic conquest in the seventh century ushered in new influences from Arabic music but Persian musicians were still widely popular in courts across the Islamic empire. During the Abbasid dynasty, shortly after the Islamic conquest, a more relaxed and more “secular” government allowed for scholars like Abu Nasr Farabi to conduct much scholarship on musical theory and performers to develop the Persian tradition more fully (Harmoz 3-4). As Shiite—a more stringent branch of Islam—control over the government increased, or decreased, hostility toward music-making and theorizing increased or waned (Harmoz 3-7). Out of this history, emerged complex and still highly debated (about whether they were actually “Persian” or not) musical ideas and concepts. One of the more standard and accepted of these was the mode, a configuration of pitches and intervals similar to but not the same as the Western scale. Each mode had a sahed, a note that any given song would return to often and that an improviser would emphasize. Each mode contained its own set of foruds, standard ways of ending sections of a certain part of the song or the song itself (see Figs III and IV). These are similar to the radifs, “melody models upon which extemporization takes place…[where] certain elemental melodic features remain which g[a]ve the piece its identity” (21, 23, 25). These three elements became combined during the Qajar dynasty (18th to 20th centuries) into a more complex system that Shanahan, interestingly, does not really use in his piece. At this time, various modes were grouped into dastgahs, “a set of pieces [radifs], traditionally grouped together, most of which have their own individual modes….” (18). Shanahan seems to have made a conscious decision to use only a single individual mode, the mahur, (see Figure II) for Night, not a complete dastgah, thus choosing to bypass a later development in Persian theory, perhaps seeking a more “authentically” Persian sound, before Western influences of the Qajar reign had made their impact on Persian culture (6-7).\n\nAn example of the mahur as played on the santur to get a sense of the notes Shanahan is working with.\n\nShanahan also employs the music of two flutes from two mystical religious sects that were producing their own unique sounds at the same time as Persia was developing its own tradition. In Japan, Fuke Zen Buddhism was one example of a great infusion of Chinese culture that came to the home islands in the seventh century A.D (McQueen and Hughes 5-6; Tzuneko 14-5). At the same time as the religion came to Japan, the shakuhachi, what would become its primary instrument, also arrived, a bamboo, end-blown flute that Fuke monks used in performing suizen, “blowing Zen,” where the very act of playing the flute was a form of meditation. The shakuhachi became a symbol of privilege and power when in the seventh century, the Japanese shogunate formally established Fuke as an officially sanctioned order, conferring on it special rights and privileges. The shakuhachi could only be used either in temple services or during takuhatsu, when the monks went house to house asking for alms. Shanahan references in Night the famed honkyoku melodies the monks played during this period of prominence, before the shogunate, for unclear reasons, revoked the decree granting them their exclusive prerogatives in 1847. These songs are characterized by slow tempos that gradually gather speed, with no set time signature to establish a constant beat. Instead, the flutist plays free form, using “short melodic units each played in a single breath” (Tzuneko 145-60). The melodies of the shakuhachi generally try to emulate sounds in nature, such as bird calls or waterfalls (\"Shakuhachi\").\n\nAn example of the traditional shakuhachi style.\n\nAnother example, with some Zen philosophical ideas at the end.\n\nAnother meditative bamboo flute was also in use at this time, across the Silk Road region but in particular in the western Muslim countries, like the Ottoman Empire. The Sufi Islamic mystics employed the ney in their rituals for the purpose of achieving zikr, “the ritual event…[and/or] act of fulfilling” Sufis’ core principle: “‘Remember God as often as possible!’” Zikr was thus intended as communion or union with the divine Himself (Hammarlund 1). The ney was one of the most important instruments for achieving zikr. It was, and still is, “a symbol of the human soul that has to be totally void so that it can resonate. This reed…carries a very important symbol through its emptiness: for the human soul to approach and connect to the Divine, it must be empty and pure….” (“Sufi Music”). As a result of this desire to connect with God, the ney employs more abstract “heavenly” melodies, that often appear in low registers and sound “horse and fiery,” even “sensual….” (\"Ney, or Nay\"; Hammarlund 2). In one section of Night, both the shakuhachi and the ney feature prominently in a mystical conversation, with both flutes and their rich traditions brought directly into contact as the instruments trade melodies back and forth.\n\nExample 1 of traditional ney music, with the the notes displayed to follow along with.\n\nExample 2 of traditional ney music, also with displayed sheet music.\n\nThe other critical instruments in Shanahan’s work are those in the percussion section. The riq, the dumbek, and the hand cymbal are very commonly to Middle Eastern music. The riq (the name is apparently only used in Egypt) is a tambourine, while the dumbek is one of the most frequently used drums in the Middle East. It generally emits two distinct sounds. Bass tones are called “doums” while higher notes are known as “teks” and the drummer will go back and forth between the two and their variations, as the drummer in Night does throughout the song. The shaker drum is also heard here. All of these percussion elements are found throughout much of Night, creating a rhythmic backbone (Donald).\n\nIn the main theme to Night, (such as when it appears at 1:38) the Persian musical concepts we discussed above function as a crucial sonic foundation upon which the entirety of this section is structured and built. The mode used, mahur, supplies Shanahan’s notes here so that our ears are thus not confused or jarred by non-modal notes that would not only sound bad but also mar the faithfulness with which Shanahan has brought the mahur into this song (Shanahan). As the melody descends and ascends, the ensemble keeps returning to a single note, which is likely the mahur’s sahed, its most widely used note. Persian theory is also referenced with melodies. As we noted before, Persian music is composed of certain “pieces” or melodic tropes that reoccur often, known as radifs. The ascending and descending line that reoccurs in each iteration of the main theme likely references or even copies one or several Persian radifs. There is a chance, given the similarity of these riffs to the different forud assigned to the mahur mode (See Figures III and IV) that Shanahan is utilizing foruds here. However, this is unlikely, since it appears that the foruds were more of a development connected to the later paradigm of the dastgah, which Shanahan does not reference much if at all in this song. Moreover, the accomponyning booklet for Night's CD only mentions the mahur, and one would think that, given their self-proclaimed attention to maintain musical traditions, the Ensemble would be inclined to indicate explicitly that the dastgah idea was being utilized in this song (Accompanying Booklet).\n\nAnother key element of this section is instrumentation, since non-Persian instruments are employed, such as Western strings and the Chinese sheng and pipa (Accompanying Booklet; \"The Silk Road\"). Yet, because all of these instruments are in the same modal context, playing largely in unison, there is no sense of any one instrument (and thus any one culture or tradition) sticking out or overpowering everything else. The tenor of the instruments causes them to speak with a very similar (though not uniform) voice. The constant drumming of the dumbek and riq, providing a steady beat underneath this melody, offers the listener some sonic guide posts to latch onto and follow over the course of the song, so that he does not get lost or confused but has something familiar to guide his listening. The main melody thus accomplishes well the goals of the ensemble. It maintains several key elements of Persian music—the mahur, the sahed, and the radif—while using them to maintain a certain harmonic consistency. This is complimented by similar-sounding instruments whose individual personalities still come out at spots. Underlying everything is the constant beat of the percussion section. In the midst of all this reference to traditions, new ideas, new arrangements of instruments, and new arrangements of melodies— even the creation of new ones—evidence Shanahan’s own creative thinking and guiding hand. But the composer’s presence does not overwhelm the other parts of the piece. The new melodies and the instruments do not overpower the mahur or the radifs but rather build off of the melodic and rhythmic guidelines that these have established.\n\nWhen the melody ends, Shanahan transitions nicely to the next portion of the piece, when the shakuhachi and ney emerge as the melodic focus (2:48). First, only the percussion plays a slower doum-tek rhythm to set the scene, joined by the Western string instruments on a similar sounding ostinato. This lead-in prepares us to move from the very lively main melody to a mysterious, almost meditative section. Shanahan maintains the percussion beat and string ostinato throughout this section, a feature that guides listeners through this much more free-flowing part, where both the shakuhachi and the ney do not follow a constant beat. The ney enters first, in a manner reminiscent of its typical use in Sufi rituals, with low, deep, rasping tones, while it largely stays in this range, making music on much longer breaths than the shakuhachi. The Japanese flute at first goes back and forth with the ney, but then emerges as the more dominant voice, playing quicker, short melodic bursts. The CD booklet states that Shanahan himself composed this “countermelodies” for the two flutes (Accompanying Booklet). Still, although the specific arrangement of rhythms and ideas are his, by keeping the ney in its lower, earthier register, and assigning the shakuhachi shorter riffs that probably are only intended for a single, short breath, Shanahan has still made some reference to the musical traditions from which these instruments have come. The generally mystical and meditative atmosphere also alludes to the original contexts in which Fuke monks and Sufi mystics would have used these instruments. Shanahan, therefore, uses them to create his own melodies, but he largely only does so within the sonic and musical parameters their original uses have set for him.\n\nHowever, when we have accounted for the successful uses of the two flutes, this section is not totally well-executed. There is still some sense (though by no means a major or overwhelming one) that this part of Night is a little bit too mystical or free-flowing, even a little confusing to follow. The percussion helps to ameliorate this problem but not completely. There are some points when it is unclear what is going on melodically in the interplay between the ney and shakuhachi or what musical idea Shanahan is exactly trying to get across. Perhaps, a counter to this criticism is that this is exactly the composer’s point—to make this section referencing Islamic and Buddhist mysticism as numinous and spiritual as possible. Maybe this is the case, but, there is still a sense in this section that we don’t know where we are—that we are not even in some heavenly realm.\n\nAside from this relatively small problem, the piece’s weakest section comes right after the flutes finish their dialogue, in Shanahan’s transition to when the percussion take center stage. As the shakuhachi becomes more agitated and the strings become more vocal and emerge from the background, eventually all of the instruments accelerate until they rapidly merge together and devolve into a single mass of sound, like a bunch of different leaves being crunched up into a big ball. It is very unclear what Shanahan is trying to accomplish here. At other parts of the song, like between the main melody and the beginning of the flute section, Shanahan links the two parts well. We are lead surprisingly seamlessly not only between musical ideas but between countries and musical transitions. But here, we are lead from a place where we have some (though not a complete idea) of where we are into another space where things are completely confused, where we have lost our sense of where the piece is going. Shanahan, therefore, muddles the links between his adept treatment of Middle Eastern and Japanese flute traditions and a section using Middle Eastern drums.\n\nOur examination of these three sections of Night at the Caravanserai illustrates one possible way to creatively combine and reshape musical traditions without ruining them in the process. In trying to strike this delicate balance, Shanahan had to decide both how much he would draw on the Silk Road’s musical traditions versus his own musical ideas for composing this piece, as well as exactly how he would actually incorporate all those ideas into the new song so that they worked together. For the main melody, he integrated Persian music theory as both an overall structure that provided the notes from which the melody would be drawn, and as a source for some very specific melodies—the radifs we discussed before. The arrangement of those radifs and the instrumentation as well as the percussion parts were not taken from Persian music, but rather were Shanahan’s own ideas. Yet they did not feature so prominent a role that they overwhelmed the Persian aspects of the main theme nor so little of one that they were nonexistent. They were built on top of and out from the foundation the notes of the mahur and (primarily) the rhythms of the radifs provided them. Similarly, the musical traditions of the ney and shakuhachi serve as a sort of guide for the composition of that part of the song. Shanahan has chosen two instruments from similar musical traditions that were used for similar purposes. He has composed music for the two flutes that references those traditions. Though they perform Shanahan’s own melodies, each instrument stays in the same register it typically used during a religious ceremony, while the ney plays its traditional longing, earthy notes and the shakuhachi flitters above somewhat like a bird might. He perhaps takes his fascination with the atmosphere of Zen and Sufi mysticism too far, however, verging on creating confusion for the listener about "
