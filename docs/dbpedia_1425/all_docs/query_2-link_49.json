I’m the type of person who does everything at the last minute, so I’m rushing around with no time to tidy up.\n\nWhich albums are you listening to most right now?\n\nI like different music including dance, R&B, house and even classical. But at home, the album I’m listening to the most at the moment is by an urban artist called Ray J."
