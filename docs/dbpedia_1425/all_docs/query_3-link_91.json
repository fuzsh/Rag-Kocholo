Through the Cloe's Corner co-collaborative and co-working space in Brooklyn, New York, Luv's organization, Women With Voices, provides peer-based support, entrepreneurial resources, financial education, and business seminars to advance women across all industries and ethnicities.  She is also co-owner of Brook Brovaz Studio in Brooklyn, where she manages the Brook Brovaz – a team of music producers and composers whose music is used in some of today's most popular television shows and films. Her company has worked with some of the hottest up & coming to multi-Platinum, Grammy Award-winning artists, as well as servicing musical compositions to major companies in TV, Film, Ads, Video Games, and Mnemonics.   Cloe Luv is a representative for the new face of America. Her many ventures are an organic outgrowth of her entrepreneurial acumen. Former New York City Mayor, Michael Bloomberg’s team, recognized the work Cloe is doing with Cloe’s Corner. His now suspended 2020 presidential campaign had set up their campaign offices at Cloe’s Corner, with Bloomberg’s former campaign manager tapping her for advice on how his organization can better serve women and minorities.",
