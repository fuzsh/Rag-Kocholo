Some dimwitted record company belatedly gets wise to the fact that reality TV sells records, decides to create the ultimate hybrid of crass pop TV hell - the Big Brother Band. Starting with 12 members, one gets evicted with every single, until there's just one group - with all the useless ones in it, who walk away with a course of Geri-style vitamin injections.\n\nAll sound too Fame Academy? Try Big Brovaz, the UK's brightest new hip-hop-hopes who've\n\nalmost\n\ndone it that way. A couple of years ago, a collective of 16 London MCs and singers hooked up on compilation album Big Brovaz - Watching You.\n\nBut feeling the urge for crew camaraderie, they whittled down to three boys and three girls (J-Rock, Flawless, Skills, Dion, Nadia and Cherise) and became Big Brovaz, a group in their own right. The selection process? \"Er,\" giggles girl brova Nadia, \"I think we were just...\"\n\n\"We've got bright personalities, very bubbly,\" says J-Rock. \"We're very talented also, so the talent shines through. It was very evident to see why! We never had any bad points!\"\n\nHip-hop bravado. Love it. So want to do any boasts while you're here?\n\n\"The music we make is very different from other kinds of music around. People talk about the same things, stuff that they have and the bling bling and the ice and all that and the cars. We're coming with the things that we've grown up doing. We're telling people how it is and what we're here to do. The things we'd like to have, instead of saying what we've got.\"\n\nThe Bash Street Crew? Or how about the UK's OutKast, seeing as their single Nu Flow bears a blinging resemblance to The Whole World?\n\n\"We had the song recorded before they came out with their version,\" says J-Rock firmly, \"but their song came before ours. It's not like we were intentionally doing something to sound like OutKast.\"\n\nWhatever, as a UK crew with enough eye on pop wonders, no talk of guns and some splendid circus skills displayed in their video, we're going to (brace yourselves) keep watching Big Brovaz.\n\n\"We're emulating like the greatest show on earth,\" says J-Rock.\"\n\nAnd are they the greatest show on earth?\n\n\"If you ever come and catch a Big Brovaz show you'll say that yourself!\"\n\nNu Flow is out this week through Epic."
