        "text": "'Can I have your digits, s'il vous plait?\" The male half of boy-girl hip hop sextet Big Brovaz have been in Paris for just under an hour, and already they're asking young ladies on the Champs Elysées for their phone numbers.\n\n\"It's the international language, innit?\" confides Randy, the most outgoing of the three, as his bandmates, J-Rock and Flawless, throw moody poses in an attempt to persuade one perplexed teenager that they really are internationally famous pop stars. Well, if they're not now, they shrug, they will be soon.\n\nBig Brovaz set an astonishing precedent at this year's Brits nominations by joining the Best Urban Act shortlist after releasing just one single. Cynics and the uninformed would suggest that this reflects a paucity of imagination on the part of the organisers, but, luckily for Big Brovaz, their debut was no ordinary Top-40 hit. At odds with the effectively rigged nature of today's charts, in which hit-hungry record companies encourage fans to buy singles in the first week of release to guarantee a short-lived number one, Nu-Flow was released last October and left the charts only a month ago.\n\nFor more than three months, their catchy, vaudevillian single was aided by its uniqueness in a pop climate that increasingly values conformity over originality. It jumped to number three, dropped to number seven, hopped back up to number four and eventually started a graceful float down the hit parade early in the new year.\n\nIn a year when urban music - broadly R&B, hip hop and soul - broke through to achieve a hold on the mainstream charts that was only broken by television pop contest winners, the Brits finally proved that they had a finely-tuned ear to the ground by inaugurating the new category. Big Brovaz were prime candidates for nomination, alongside Romeo and Ms Dynamite.\n\nWe meet in central Paris as the band prepares for a Sony France showcase gig at a hip hop club in the basement of Planet Hollywood. It's a last-minute arrangement squashed in between a hectic round of promotion for their latest single, OK, the release of which was put back repeatedly as Nu-Flow refused to give up its Top-40 tenure.\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" yelps the diminutive Nadia, who, like Cherise, grew up worshipping the chart-friendly soul balladry of Mariah Carey. \"You would not believe some of the shoes we've seen today!\"\n\nThe girls bound into Planet Hollywood with a selection of the finest goods the rue St Honoré has to offer. Nadia, 23, was working as a receptionist at her local Reading Travelodge as recently as two years ago, daydreaming of emulating the success of her heroine. Cherise was the recipient of a Mobo Best Unsigned Act award in 2000, which led to an ultimately fruitless record deal. The remaining girl member, Dion, in her words, \"grew up with the church\".\n\nBig Brovaz became a sextet shortly before signing a record deal with the Epic label last year, having numbered 14 for five years as a Brixton-based underground act. Unlike So Solid Crew, to whom they're too often, too lazily compared, their raison d'être hasn't been to bring the underground to the masses, but to create the kind of hybrid of hip hop and pop that has, thanks to acts such as Nelly and Outkast, led to \"urban\" becoming the biggest-selling genre in American music.\n\nIt helps that this is the band's own idea: Flawless, J-Rock and Randy have essentially given up their backgrounds in hard rap to allow Big Brovaz to evolve into its current, idiosyncratic state.\n\n\"We'd long had enough of being broke,\" says Flawless over a glass of champagne before the show. Washington DC-born J-Rock agrees: \"I've been rapping with Randy since we were kids, as a group called Out-4-Justice, but we weren't getting anywhere. My mum's in her sixties, and she never used to be able to listen to our old stuff. Now she really likes what we do. I want us to appeal to all ages.\"\n\nThey hit the stage just after midnight, with Justin Timberlake, a horde of enthusiastic Parisians and the assembled Sony grands fromages all present and correct. Two hours of ceaselessly perfectionist rehearsal pays off as Nu-Flow and OK, renamed \"a va!\" for one night only, rock the house."
