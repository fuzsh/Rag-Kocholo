        "text": "I love there Nu Flow album. Used to have it on CD back in the day. Must have thrown it out but about 6 month ago i purchased the album off Itunes and still love listening to it.\n\n0\n\nwow! completely forgot about these guys, anyone know what happened to them?\n\nTwo of the girls went on to create the dance duo Booty Luv. If you dont know them by name you probably will by hearing there songs.\n\nSure i heard one of the guys has been in prison. Not entirely sure. I might have to take a trip over to Wikipedia and see.\n\n0\n\nI remember being about 13-14 when Nu Flow was in the charts. It reminds me of some old friends I used to hang about with as we'd play this song all the time and so I'm kind of glad nobody remembers this group because it harbours up to many memories for me. Good song though!\n\n0\n\nTwo of the girls went on to create the dance duo Booty Luv.

I might have to take a trip over to Wikipedia and see.\n\n\"To add to this disappointment, rapper Flawless (Temi Tayo Aisida) was stopped at LAX airport and was found to be smuggling over 2.2 grams (0.07 ounces) of Cannabis into the UK. This resulted in his sacking from the group in 2004, leaving the remaining 5 group members and two producers to carry on without him\" - Big Brovaz wikipedia page.\n\n0\n\nI was 12 when they were around, I remember Nu Flow and Favourite Things being in the charts. I have Nu Flow on my ipod.\n\n0\n\nslightly o/t, but I rememer reading an article in heat about them before they came out.\n\nIt was around the time of the first few series of the show bb, so i think they were trying to imply the two things were related\n\nI always liked OK\n\n0\n\nI just found an old mp3 player and I rediscovered this band. They had some really good songs.\n\nNu Flow, OK, Favourite Things, Baby Boy.\n\nAlso Big Bro Thang which they tried out for Eurovision was brilliant\n\nBig Bro Thang was a top tune and brill live performance on the Euro qualifying show, gutted this didn't become the huge hit it deserved to be.\n\n0\n\nTheir second album was much better than their debut.\n\nHad they remained a six piece, I think things would have played out differently. Losing Dion proved to be the final blow for them, sadly.\n\n0"
