        "text": "verifiedCite\n\nWhile every effort has been made to follow citation style rules, there may be some discrepancies. Please refer to the appropriate style manual or other sources if you have any questions.\n\nSelect Citation Style\n\nSome of the most innovative artists of the Western world were only around for a decade or two during which they managed to make waves and leave an indelible imprint on the history of art. Spanning 600 years, here is a list of 13 of them. Who knows what they may have accomplished had they had a little more time on earth?\n\nTomasso Masaccio (1401–1428): 27\n\nIt is remarkable to imagine making such a splash in a lifetime that spanned less than three decades, especially when there is no record of your life before the age of 20. Nothing is known of Masaccio, master Florentine painter of the early Italian Renaissance, until 1421. In just seven years, he transformed art with his mastery of linear perspective and ingenious use of chiaroscuro—dramatic light and dark. In other words, he could create in two-dimensions the illusion of three, as in his fresco of the expulsion from Eden (c. 1427).\n\nGiorgione (1478–1510): 32\n\nFamous and highly esteemed in his day, very little substantive information remains on High Renaissance Venetian painter, Giorgione. He is credited with having introduced the practice of painting with pigments that had been mixed with oil and flexible resins on canvas, which resulted in a luminous, jewel-like effect. Only five paintings that can be reasonably attributed to him survive. He was a contemporary of Titian, who went on to have the career Giorgione might have—had he not been killed at age 32 by the plague.\n\nRaphael (1483–1520): 37\n\nA High Renaissance painter and architect, Raphael was considered a master painter by the age of 17. In 1508, at the age of 25, he was given the prestigious honor of painting the private apartment of the Pope at the Vatican. His iconic fresco painting there, The School of Athens, includes 52 figures set within a grand, vaulted architectural structure that gives an unrivaled illusion of depth in this period. He was younger than his contemporary Michelangelo but died 43 years before him on his own 37th birthday.\n\nAntoine Watteau (1684–1721): 37\n\nAn artist of the Rococo period, Watteau’s fame arose from his Fêtes Galantes, whimsical and theatrical paintings of Frenchmen and women outdoors singing, dancing, flirting, and relaxing with one another. His fantastical, shimmering compositions were influential across the arts, in poetry, theater, and costume. Watteau was sickly and frail for many years, some say since childhood, and died at age 37, probably from tuberculosis.\n\nTheodore Gericault (1791–1824): 33\n\nGericault is known for his monumental, dramatic canvases. At age 21 he entered his first Salon competition with Charging Chasseur, a nearly 12-foot-tall painting, and ran off with the gold medal. His next big success was with his best-known painting, The Raft of the Medusa, which took the Salon of 1819 by storm, but the effort of such an enormous work caused him to suffer a nervous breakdown. His health continued to fail. Recognizing he was nearing his end, he sketched preparatory drawings for several large-scale paintings, which, of course, were never realized.\n\nGeorges Seurat (1859–1891): 31\n\nSeurat made a career of counteracting the practices of the Impressionists, becoming rather controversial in his nine short years as a working artist. A founder of the Neo-Impressionists, his Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte (1884-86) may be one of the most recognized works of art in the Western world. Seurat invented Pointillism, a method of applying paint as tiny dots so as to capture the maximum concentration of color. He died suddenly, possibly from meningitis, at the height of his career at age 31.\n\nVincent van Gogh (1853–1890): 37\n\nVan Gogh may be the most legendary of the artists we lost too soon. The artist whose works now bring in tens of millions of dollars at auction is said to have sold only one painting in his short life. Van Gogh was an extremely prolific painter as well as a prolific letter writer. The content of this correspondence offers critical information that has been used to interpret the artist’s work since his death. The letters also provided insight into the emotional struggles which eventually led to his suicide by gunshot at age 37.\n\nAmedeo Modigliani (1884–1920): 35\n\nThis famous Italian portraitist was afflicted by a tubercular lung and struggled with delicate health throughout his short life. To make matters worse, or to ease his pain, he abused alcohol and drugs heavily. Sadly, he was not particularly successful in his lifetime, but earned his fame posthumously, as many great artists unfortunately do. When Modigliani died from a bout of tubercular meningitis at age 35, his lover and muse, painter Jeanne Hébuterne, killed herself and their unborn child the following day by jumping from their apartment window.\n\nEgon Schiele (1890–1918): 28\n\nA critical player in the development of Austrian Expressionism, Schiele had a successful career as an artist, but it was not without controversy. The artist’s overtly erotic images, particularly of children who came to his studio and sat for him in the nude, drew criticism and eventually led to an arrest in 1912 on charges of abducting and raping a minor. These charges were lifted and replaced with offenses against morality, but his work was toned down after that. He was drafted and survived WW I—during which he was able to continue to work on his art—and enjoyed enormous success at the 49th Vienna Secession in 1918. However, a few months after the exhibition he died from Spanish influenza at age 28.\n\nEva Hesse (1936–1970): 34\n\nAfter fleeing Nazi persecution in 1939 and enduring her mother’s suicide, Hesse pursued art, attending excellent schools, earning scholarships, and eventually studying under Josef Albers at Yale University. Hesse is known for creating sculptural works with unusual materials. Just as her career was taking off in the late 1960s, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor and died within a year at age 34.\n\nYves Klein (1928–1962): 34\n\nA conceptual, and somewhat megalomaniacal, artist and Judo black belt, Klein was destined for greatness, at least according to him. He is known for monochromatic paintings as well as for his clever and provocative installations, such as a display of 11 canvases painted all blue which gestured toward Picasso in the exhibition title: “Monochrome Propositions: Blue Period.” He also staged an exhibition called “The Void,” which showed nothing but an empty gallery with freshly painted walls. Performative works like this make some critics today call him a brilliant precursor to Postmodernism. At age 34 he died suddenly of his third heart attack in two months.\n\nKeith Haring (1958–1990): 32\n\nHaring made an art form of popularizing art. The artist started out covering New York City with graffiti. His quirky figural imagery garnered a popular following. He moved on to creating large-scale murals throughout the world, often recruiting children to help him. His work went mainstream and found its way into fashion, in particular. He opened a shop to capitalize on his good fortune, The Pop Shop, but a year later, in 1987, was diagnosed with AIDS. Before he died at age 32, he worked furiously, creating as much art as possible and established the Keith Haring Foundation to raise consciousness about AIDS and continue to do the work of promoting art in the lives of children after he was gone.\n\nJean-Michel Basquiat (1960–1988): 27\n\nSelf-taught and fiercely independent, Basquiat shook up the art world when the graffiti he and his circle of friends were leaving all over New York City under the name SAMO (“same old shit”) caught the attention of the art world in the late 1970s. He emerged from the underground and became an art star overnight, showing in his first public show in 1980. He became friends with Andy Warhol and found himself the subject of articles by important critics in major publications. At the height of this frenzy, at age 27, the artist was found dead from a heroin overdose."
