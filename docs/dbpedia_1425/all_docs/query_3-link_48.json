His stage name is taken from the initials of his real name, Fabiano Montesano. Famoe is originally from the city of Santicelli/Cosenza in Calabria, Italy but is currently based in Suessen/Stuttgart, Germany. He owns a record label called “Rap & Rhymes Records.”\n\nFamoe started as a hip-hop dancer when he was only six years old, often mimicking his idol Michael Jackson’s moves. However, it was an album by hip-hop superstar Nelly called Country Grammar that inspired him to turn to rap. In 2001, he joined a music video clip contest in Germany as he was encouraged by his dance teacher. Famoe reached the final round of the competition, and this started his career in dancing.\n\nRap & Rhymes Records was founded by Famoe in 2003, where he met his friend Nino, who was a former hobby remixer. Later that same year, with Nino’s help, he recorded his first-ever EP called Dancing in My Block. He also made his first single entitled This Life, also produced with his friend Nino. Famoe released his debut album in 2006 titled “The Italian Stallion,” which had over 1000 CDs in circulation.\n\nOver the last decade, Famoe has worked with numerous recording labels, such as Universal Music, Sony Music, and Kontor Records. He has also worked with top producers in the dance genre like Stephan Endemann and Alex Christensen, who helped with his records as well. He changed his stage name from Fantastical to Famoe in his quest to continually improve his branding.\n\nFamoe is motivated by his drive to make unique music as he deems it to be rare in modern-day music. He always wanted to do things he feels passionate about and create music his way. Going with the flow in the entertainment business is good, according to Famoe, but every artist should aspire to be different and unique.\n\nA self-confessed 90s kid, Famoe considers hip-hop legends like 2Pac, Jay-Z, Nelly, 50 Cent, and Timbaland his musical heroes. However, it’s Eminem, whom he cites as the biggest influence in the style of music he’s making. Famoe had the privilege of being the opening act for artists like Blackstreet, Public Announcement, Dru Hill, Shai, 112, DJ Nassr, and many more. He’s had numerous collaborations, both on stage and on record, with some of those artists.\n\nFamoe is slowly increasing social media to his fame as well, as he has ventured lately with Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and Officialfamoe.com. His graphic novel Soundtrack is also currently in the works, set for production by JayMo, which he plans on releasing for the Kill Journal that is directed by Adam Lawson & Ari Wiener. As well as other projects like an EDM Record entitled “It’s ya Boy’’ by Famoe & Lynx that will be published by a US Label called SoCal Records, an EP called “Paradigm” that includes Artist features such as TQ & Big Brovaz by the end of the year and 2 official Soundtracks for an Independent Movie War from the Archives directed by Godfidence Losu, with Actor Hasaan Rasheed.\n\nFamoe also released more original materials with some artists he worked with such as: Kurupt, Spider Loc, Serius Jones, Donnie Klang to name a few.\n\nDespite experiencing some success as a musician, Famoe continues to work on releasing music that is unique. He wants to set his own mark and wants people to remember him as someone who did things differently. For Famoe, it’s not about becoming the best artist, but doing what you love.\n\nWebsite:\n\nhttps://officialfamoe.com\n\nSpotify:\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/artist/6hNvnZ9WpT7fg62z9sKVqL?si=3Xrj8wbRQVep_QLOmFhXHA\n\nInstagram:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/itsfamoe/\n\nFamoe:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Famoe/\n\nYoutube:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/officialfamoe\n\nTwitter:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/itsfamoe\n\nCheck out the thisis50.com Source-Link here:\n\nhttps://thisis50.com/2021/09/28/versatile-recording-artist-famoe-is-doing-things-his-way-and-succeeding-at-every-step/"
