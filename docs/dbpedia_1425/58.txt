BIG Brovaz first hit the music scene in 2002 with their massive hit Nu Flow.

From 2002 to 2004, the London based R&B band went from strength to strength with bangers like Favourite Things and O.K.

It was a heartbreaking moment for everyone when the band called it quits in 2004 due to poor record sales.

14 years after their short-lived music career, we take a look at what Dion, Nadia, Cherise, J-Rock and Randy are up to.

(Sorry, we couldn't find 6th member Flawless)

Nadia Shepherd was one of the three girls in the original band along with Cherise and Dion.

We know what you're thinking, she looks no different.

But a lot has changed in the musicians life since the split of Big Brovaz.

The singer is not only now a mother, but is still pursuing her music career in the band Booty Luv with former Big Brovaz band member Cherise.

Rapper in the band, Randy, has changed a lot since 2002. Including those gold teeth.

Like Nadia, the artist has continued his music career.

Randy joined forces with former Big Brovaz member J-Rock to start their own band Party Dark.

We can't get over how much Dion has changed since her time in the hip hop band.

The artist shows off a toned down look on her Twitter.

Although it's not very clear what Dion is up to these days, in her Twitter bio she describes herself as: "Singer/Songwriter/Vocal Coach Music"

How grown up does J-Rock look?

Since the band Big Brovaz split, the artist has continued his career with Randy in Party Dark.

The star has also become a Dad to three sons.

The rapper also does a lot of work to raise awareness of autism after one of his son's was diagnosed with the illness.

We hardly recognised Cherise!

The singer has transformed since her days in Big Brovaz.

The former R&B singer has continued her career with Nadia in girl band Booty Luv.

It doesn't look like there are any signs of a potential reunion between the band members, but we can still dream.
