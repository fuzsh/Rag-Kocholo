Life is a puzzle without a solution, a series of bleak, frustrating moments shadowed by the guaranteed absurdity of death. This, more or less, is the lesson  or perhaps the premise  of “You, the Living,” the new film by the Swedish director Roy Andersson. The film is slow, rigorously morose and often painful in its blunt reckoning of disappointment and failure. It is also extremely funny.

And not always in an edge-of-the-grave, morbid way. At first, or on a preliminary viewing (gourmand of masochism that I am, I’ve seen it twice), the friendly affirmation of the title seems ironic, almost to the point of cruelty. (It also echoes the name of Ayn Rand’s first novel, “We the Living.”) “You”  that is, We, sitting meekly in the audience, anxious mirror images of the sad characters on screen  are mired in misery and confusion and might as well give up. But then the irony redoubles and reverses, and by the end the generosity of Mr. Andersson’s vision is apparent. It becomes clear that we have been watching a deadpan but nonetheless heartfelt affirmation of human existence, which may be fragile and pointless but is still worth something.

“You, the Living,” only the fourth feature Mr. Andersson has made in a career that began more than four decades ago, enfolds its considerable aesthetic and intellectual ambition in a plain, dry, beautifully made wrapper. The director, a prolific and inventive maker of television commercials, works in the comic tradition of Buster Keaton and Jacques Tati, constructing visual gags that are at once painstakingly elaborate and gratifyingly simple. Using a mostly stationary camera, he turns the frame into a kind of live-action newspaper cartoon panel. The jokes are sometimes broad, sometimes sublimely subtle and sometimes, somehow, both at once.

He exploits the comic potential of certain musical instruments (the banjo, the sousaphone and the bass drum, most notably) and the incongruous music of thunder, machinery and the Swedish language. Much of the dialogue is spoken directly into the camera, as people, mostly played by nonprofessional, plain-looking actors, catalog their woes or recount their dreams. These are dramatized with somber care, and they are no more inscrutable or haunting than the waking reality they punctuate.

In the world of “You, the Living,” the appalling keeps close company with the banal, and any sense of what it all might mean is kept at arm’s length. But while the film is abstract and elusive, it is never dull or inaccessible. The drab color scheme  muted blues and washed-out yellows  attains a delicate, painterly beauty, and the disconnected scenes have the force and coherence of short poems. Zen limericks, perhaps, or vaudevillian haikus.

Mr. Andersson’s world is patently unreal. His apartment buildings, bars, offices and barbershops are sets, a simulated reality only a little less grand (if a lot less manic) than the fake Manhattan constructed by Philip Seymour Hoffman’s character in “Synecdoche, New York.” But the emotions that circulate through this world  envy, desire, befuddlement, pity, impatience  could hardly be more recognizable, and the artifice of their setting only makes that familiarity more vivid.

The sad-sack Swedes who populate this picture are a strange and curious lot, sometimes wantonly expressive, sometimes the opposite. But their exotically ordinary appearance is Mr. Andersson’s cleverest sleight of hand. The title of this movie is meant literally. It’s about you.
