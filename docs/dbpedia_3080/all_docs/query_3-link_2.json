        "text": "Ableism 101\n\nWhat it is, what it looks like, and how to become a better ally\n\nAs buzzwords like social justice, equity, and inclusion permeate our collective consciousness, it’s essential for advocates of progress to remember another ‘ism,’ one that is frequently left out of conversations.\n\nAbleism.\n\nThe world wasn’t built with people with disabilities in mind, and because of that, the world we live in is inherently “ableist.”\n\nSo…what is ableism?\n\nAbleism is the discrimination of and social prejudice against people with disabilities based on the belief that typical abilities are superior. At its heart, ableism is rooted in the assumption that disabled people require ‘fixing’ and defines people by their disability. Like racism and sexism, ableism classifies entire groups of people as ‘less than,’ and includes harmful stereotypes, misconceptions, and generalizations of people with disabilities.\n\nWhat does ableism look like?\n\nAbleism can take many forms including:\n\nLack of compliance with disability rights laws like the ADA\n\nSegregating students with disabilities into separate schools\n\nThe use of restraint or seclusion as a means of controlling students with disabilities\n\nSegregating adults and children with disabilities in institutions\n\nFailing to incorporate accessibility into building design plans\n\nBuildings without braille on signs, elevator buttons, etc.\n\nBuilding inaccessible websites\n\nThe assumption that people with disabilities want or need to be ‘fixed’\n\nUsing disability as a punchline, or mocking people with disabilities\n\nRefusing to provide reasonable accommodations\n\nThe eugenics movement of the early 1900s\n\nThe mass murder of disabled people in Nazi Germany\n\nBut what about ‘everyday’ or minor ableism? What does that look like?\n\nChoosing an inaccessible venue for a meeting or event, therefore excluding some participants\n\nUsing someone else’s mobility device as a hand or foot rest\n\nFraming disability as either tragic or inspirational in news stories, movies, and other popular forms of media\n\nCasting a non-disabled actor to play a disabled character in a play, movie, TV show, or commercial\n\nMaking a movie that doesn’t have audio description or closed captioning\n\nUsing the accessible bathroom stall when you are able to use the non-accessible stall without pain or risk of injury\n\nWearing scented products in a scent-free environment\n\nTalking to a person with a disability like they are a child, talking about them instead of directly to them, or speaking for them\n\nAsking invasive questions about the medical history or personal life of someone with a disability\n\nAssuming people have to have a visible disability to actually be disabled\n\nQuestioning if someone is ‘actually’ disabled, or ‘how much’ they are disabled\n\nAsking, “How did you become disabled?”\n\nWhat are ablest micro-aggressions?\n\nMicro-aggressions are everyday verbal or behavioral expressions that communicate a negative slight or insult in relation to someone’s gender identity, race, sex, disability, etc. In the case of ableism:\n\n“That’s so lame.”\n\n“You are so retarded.”\n\n“That guy is crazy.”\n\n“You’re acting so bi-polar today.”\n\n“Are you off your meds?”\n\n“It’s like the blind leading the blind.”\n\n“My ideas fell on deaf ears.”\n\n“She’s such a psycho.”\n\n“I’m super OCD about how I clean my apartment.”\n\n“Can I pray for you?”\n\n“I don’t even think of you as disabled.”\n\nPhrases like this imply that a disability makes a person less than, and that disability is bad, negative, a problem to be fixed, rather than a normal, inevitable part of the human experience.\n\nMany people don’t mean to be insulting, and a lot have good intentions, but even well-meant comments and actions can take a serious toll on their recipients.\n\nWhat can we do to recognize and avert ableism?\n\nBelieve people when they disclose a disability\n\nSimilarly, don’t accuse people of ‘faking’ their disability\n\nListen to people when they request an accommodation\n\nDon’t assume you know what someone needs\n\nNever touch a person with a disability or their mobility equipment without consent\n\nKeep invasive questions to yourself\n\nDon’t speak on behalf of someone with a disability unless they explicitly ask you to\n\nTalk about disability with children and young people\n\nIncorporate accessibility into your event planning\n\nLearn more about being a good disability ally here."
