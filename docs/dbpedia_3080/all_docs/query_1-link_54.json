        "text": "Only just getting the hang of last yearâs slang? Well too late, forget it. A whole new host of (somewhat nonsensical) terms have landed and itâs time to add them to your linguistic arsenal.\n\nWith TikTokâs continued reign over our society, the app has begun to dictate a lot of the slang that ends up in our daily rotation. Although not all these terms and phrases are brand new, theyâre certainly popping up everywhere â and will likely continue to do so in the year ahead. Iâve (once again) taken it upon myself to compile this new lingo into a handy list for your reading (and learning) pleasure.\n\n1. Cheugy\n\nThis word (pronounced choo-gee) has swooped in to replace old fan-favorite âbasicâ. It refers to the painfully mainstream or, along the same vein, someone hanging onto things that were cool years ago but would now be deemed basic or âcheugyâ.\n\n2. Rent free\n\nCanât stop thinking about someone? Sounds like theyâre living rent free in your mind. This is most often used when you canât get something out of your brain â whether itâs a song, video, experience or person. Theyâre stuck in there and theyâre not even paying rent for the space theyâre occupying.\n\n3. Vibe check\n\nIs someone acting shady or negative? Sounds like they didnât pass the vibe check. This describes when you check in on someoneâs vibe and assess what itâs giving. Good vibes? Youâve passed the vibe check.\n\n4. Main character\n\nThis one is fairly self-explanatory. When you call someone the main character, theyâre basically the core person in a situation. For example, in a video where someone seems to really stand out or is especially well dressed, funny, etc. you can identify them as the âmain characterâ or as having âmain character energyâ.\n\n5. Caught in 4k\n\nCaught someone red-handed and have the receipts to prove it? Youâve caught them in 4k with solid, digital evidence. Another popular phrase on TikTok, it can often be accompanied by the camera emoji to really bring home the fact that youâve been exposed.\n\n6. Understood the assignment\n\nYou can use this for someone that is really killing it in some (or any) aspect of their lives. Theyâre giving it their all and doing an amazing job. Whether itâs related to something theyâre doing, wearing, etc. they really understood the assignment.\n\n7. Bussinâ\n\nYou can use this when something is really, really good â often relating to food. If youâre eating a really great meal you could say, âThis food is bussinââ. Want to add some extra emphasis? Just double up: âWow this pizza is really bussinâ bussinââ.\n\n8. The blueprint\n\nThis describes when someone is so perfect, or did so well at something, that they are deemed the original (comparable to âOGâ). They are the blueprint, an icon, a legend. They did it first and the rest simply followed in their exemplary footsteps.\n\n9. Ate that\n\nThis essentially refers to someone doing a great job. For example if someone is performing a very impressive dance, when theyâre done, you might turn to your friend and say âthey ate thatâ. It can also be abbreviated to âthey ateâ or even âleft no crumbsâ (since, as we established, they ate it all).\n\n10. Sending me\n\nYou know when someone responds âIâm screamingâ or âI literally canâtâ when they burst out laughing? You can use âthis is sending meâ in the same way. If you watched a video you found hilarious, you could say âthat sent meâ. You can even spice it up by elaborating a little further, for example âthat sent me into orbitâ (aka it sent you so far, you ended up in space)."
