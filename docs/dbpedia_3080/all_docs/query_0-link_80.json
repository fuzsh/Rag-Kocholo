        "text": "With so many students from different locations, backgrounds and interests, studying at Summer@Brown you'll join a community of peers who bring broad and deep perspectives to living and learning together.\n\nOutside of class, you’ll participate in workshops, activities and events—scheduled from morning to night—that inform, engage and entertain. Along the way, you’ll make new friends from around the world and learn to live independently and responsibly: skills that will prepare you well for life in college and long after.\n\nSummer@Brown provides the opportunity to embrace the challenge of college-level academics without the pressure of formal grades and credit, in classes taught by instructors just as interested in your learning as you are, alongside students just as engaged as you.\n\nYou will be in class for three hours daily, five days a week—along with about three additional hours of out-of-class work individually or with your classmates each day. Expect to be challenged and to engage with your instructor and fellow students through reciprocal inquiries, actively joining class discussions and group work as well as individual study. When and where you study is up to you. Summer@Brown provides you with the freedom and responsibility to determine when and how you will complete your out-of-class work while still engaging in Student Life activities, workshops and events taking place throughout each day. The program does not set your schedule, allowing students to begin to learn how best to manage their time in ways that will prepare you for your first year in college. No matter when your class meets—morning, early or late afternoon—you’ll have the opportunity to engage with students taking other courses through a variety of activities that help you grow as a student and as a person. See Life on the Brown Campus for more information."
