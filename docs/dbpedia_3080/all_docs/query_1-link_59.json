But don’t let that intimidate you! You can start exploring English’s vast and daily use of English words with regular practice and a solid foundation of basic words.\n\nTo kickstart your journey, we’ve compiled a list of commonly used words in English you can incorporate into daily conversations. Knowing just 500 words is enough to get you started as a beginner, and if you can learn 1,000 words, you’ll be well on your way to becoming conversational.\n\nBut why stop there? Expanding your vocabulary with more complex and nuanced words will allow you to express yourself more clearly and effectively. You’ll no longer have to rely on the exact tired words like “awesome” and “beautiful” to express your feelings. Instead, you can impress others with words like “poised” and “atrocious.”\n\nIn this blog, we’ll explore common English words used in daily life to help you on your journey. Let’s dive in and start building your English vocabulary today!\n\nAlso Read:\n\nLatest IELTS Writing Task 1 2024: Vocabulary & Bar Chart\n\nLatest Vocabulary for IELTS Speaking: Definition & Best Sample Questions\n\n125+ Common English Words Used in the Daily Life\n\nHere is a table with the 125 most common English words used in daily life\n\nThe list of words from A to H is given below.\n\nThe list of words from H to N is given below.\n\nThe list of words from O to T is given below.\n\nThe list of words from U to Z is given below.\n\n50+ Advanced English Vocabulary\n\nUsing advanced vocabulary in daily life is important for various reasons.

Yeah, we’ve all been there. But there’s a solution – it’s all about building a strong vocabulary!\n\nHere’s why expanding your word power is a fantastic idea and essential for effective communication:\n\nExpressing Better: A wider vocabulary lets you articulate your thoughts and feelings more precisely. No more scrambling for “like” or “um” – you’ll have the perfect word at your fingertips!\n\nGood Conversations: Imagine having interesting and engaging conversations instead of the same old back-and-forth. A rich vocabulary is your ticket to more stimulating discussions.\n\nBoost your Confidence: Feeling comfortable expressing yourself clearly boosts confidence in any situation, whether ordering coffee or giving a presentation.\n\nNew Perspectives: The more words you know, the more you’ll understand when you read. Complex books and articles will become more accessible, opening doors to new knowledge and ideas.\n\nSound Better: Let’s face it, using various words makes you sound more articulate and well-educated. It’s a great way to make a positive impression!\n\nHow to use good vocabulary in your IELTS exam?\n\nIELTS (International English Language Testing System) is a standardised test that assesses the language proficiency of non-native English speakers. Organisations and institutions worldwide use it to measure the language ability of candidates who want to study or work in countries where English is the primary language.\n\nIt consists of 4 modules, namely:\n\nSpeaking\n\nListening\n\nReading\n\nWriting\n\nUsing good vocabulary can help you achieve a higher score on the IELTS exam. A wide range of vocabulary helps you understand the reading passages and lets you express yourself effectively in writing and speaking tasks.\n\nIELTS examiners look for candidates who can use precise and varied vocabulary to convey their message accurately. Thus, building a strong vocabulary through reading, listening, and practice is essential to achieve a high score in the IELTS exam.\n\nHere are some tips on how to use good vocabulary in your IELTS exam:\n\n1. Read widely: Reading books, newspapers, and articles in English can help you learn new words and phrases.\n\n2. Make a list of new words: Keep a notebook handy to write down new words. Review them regularly to reinforce your memory.\n\n3. Use synonyms: Instead of repeating the same words repeatedly, use synonyms to express the same idea. This will demonstrate your range of vocabulary.\n\n4. Practice using new words: Use the words you have learned in your writing and speaking practice. This will help you become more comfortable using them naturally.\n\n5. Use descriptive language: Instead of generic adjectives like “good” or “bad,” use more descriptive words that convey the same meaning. For example, instead of saying “good,” you could say “excellent,” “wonderful,” or “outstanding.”\n\nBy following these tips, you can improve your vocabulary and increase your chances of achieving a higher score on the IELTS exam.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIn conclusion, building a strong vocabulary is essential for effective communication, whether in daily life or for standardised tests like the IELTS. It allows you to express yourself precisely, engage in meaningful conversations, boost your confidence, gain new perspectives, and make a positive impression.\n\nRemember, preparing for the IELTS exam can be daunting, but you can achieve your desired score with the right guidance and practice.\n\nThe LeapScholar IELTS Prep App is here to help you prepare for the exam with ease and confidence.
