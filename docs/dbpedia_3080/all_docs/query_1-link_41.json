        "text": "A multimodal text conveys meaning through a combination of two or more modes, for example, a poster conveys meaning through a combination of written language, still image, and spatial design. Each mode uses unique semiotic resources to create meaning (Kress, 2010). . Each mode has its own specific task and function (Kress, 2010, p. 28) in the meaning making process, and usually carries only a part of the message in a multimodal text. In a picture book, the print and the image both contribute to the overall telling of the story but do so in different ways. In a visual text, for example, representation of people, objects, and places can be conveyed using choices of visual semiotic resources such as line, shape, size, line and symbols, while written language would convey this meaning through sentences using noun groups and adjectives (Callow, 2023) which are written or typed on paper or a screen.\n\nImages may simply illustrate or expand on the written story, or can be used to tell different aspects of the story, even contradicting the written words (Guijarro and Sanz, 2009, p. 107).\n\nEffective multimodal authors creatively integrate modes in various configurations to coherently convey the meaning required, ‘moving the emphasis backwards and forwards between the various modes' (Cope and Kalantzis, 2009. p. 423) throughout the text.\n\nThe complexity of the relationships between the various meaning or semiotic systems in a text increases proportionately with the number of modes involved. For example, a film text is a more complex multimodal text ​​than a poster as it dynamically combines the semiotic systems of moving image, audio, spoken language, written language, space, and gesture (acting) to convey meaning.\n\nEAL/D learners and multilingual multimodal texts\n\nMultimodal texts incorporating English and EAL/D learners’ home languages can be a source of authentic model texts. For EAL/D learners and other students who are plurilingual, it is important to consider how English and home languages can be integrated through different modes.\n\nThese include:\n\nvideos with speech in one language and subtitles in another\n\nbilingual picture books with text in multiple languages\n\ninstruction manuals with information presented in pictures and translated into multiple languages\n\nrestaurant menus with images, dish names and descriptions in different languages.\n\nMultilingual multimodal texts demonstrate clearly the author’s word and visual choices. Examples of discussion questions around the multimodal text could be:\n\nWhich languages are used in the text and why?\n\nWhy did the author choose these languages and not others?\n\nWhat function does each language have?\n\nHow would the text be different if it were only in one language/English?\n\nHow do you read/understand texts that include languages you don't know?\n\nWhat are the advantages of watching a film with subtitles versus dubbing?\n\nWhy are certain words in the novel written in another language, and italicised?\n\nModes​\n\nThe foll​​owing overview of how meaning can be composed through different semiotic resources for each mode (spoken language, written language, visual, audio, gestural, and spatial) is informed by The New London Group (2000), Cope and Kalantzis, (2009), and Kalantzis, Cope, Chan, and Dalley-Trim (2016). EAL/D learners engage with all of these meaning making practices through multicultural and/or multilingual lens.\n\nCurrently, there is extensive pedagogic support for teaching meaning making through spoken and written language, and some resources developed to support teaching meaning making in the visual mode, through ‘viewing’. However, as yet there are few resources available for teaching young students how to comprehend and compose meaning in the other modes.\n\nWritten​​ meaning\n\nConveyed through written language via handwriting, the printed page, and the screen. Choices of words, phrases, and sentences are organised through linguistic grammar convention​​​​s, register (where language is varied according to context), and genre (knowledge of how a text type is organised and staged to meet a specific purpose). See: Writing and Reading and Viewing\n\nIn bilingual or multilingual texts, written meaning may be conveyed through different scripts and laid out differently, whether typed or handwritten. EAL/D learners may also write words from their home languages using English letters (transliteration).\n\nSpoken (​​oral) meaning\n\nConveyed through spoken language via live or recorded speech and can be monologic or ​​dialogic. Choice of words, phrases, and sentences are organised through linguistic grammar conventions, register, and genre. Composing oral meaning includes choices around mood, emotion, emphasis, fluency, speed, volume, tempo, pitch, rhythm, pronunciation, intonation, and dialect. EAL/D learners may make additional choices around the use of home languages to create mood or emphasise meaning. See: Speaking and listening pedagogic resources​.\n\nVisual ​​meanin​​g\n\nConveyed through choices of visual resources and includes both still image and moving images. Images may include diverse cultural connotations, symbolism and portray different people, cultures and practices. Visual resources include: framing, vectors, symbols, perspective, gaze, point of view, colour, texture, line, shape, casting, saliency, distance, angles, form, power, involvement/detachment, contrast, lighting, naturalistic/non-naturalistic, camera movement, and subject movement. See Visual literacy metalanguage.\n\nAudio me​​aning\n\nConveyed through sound, including choices of music representing different cultures, ambient sounds, noises, alerts, sil​​ence, natural/unnatural sounds, and use of volume, beat, tempo, pitch, and rhythm. Lyrics in a song may also include multiple languages.\n\nSpatial meanin​​g\n\nConveyed through design of spaces, using choices of spatial resources including: scale, proximity, boundaries, direction, layout, and organisation of objects in the space. Space ​extends from design of the page in a book, a page in a graphic novel or comic, a webpage on the screen, framing of shots in moving image, to the design of a room, architecture, streetscapes, and landscapes.\n\nGestural meaning\n\nConveyed through choices of body movement; facial expression, eye movements​ and gaze, demeanour, gait, dance, acting, action sequences. It also includes use of rhythm, speed, stillness and angles, including ‘timing, frequency, ceremony and ritual’ (Cope and Kalantzis, 2009. p. 362). Gestures and body language may have diverse cultural connotations."
