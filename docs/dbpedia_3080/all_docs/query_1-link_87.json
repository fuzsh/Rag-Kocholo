        "text": "According to OnePoll, the average American spends more than eight hours a week in the car commuting to work or school, running errands or traveling to meet friends or family.\n\nWouldn’t it be great if you could optimize all this time in the car by mastering a foreign language?\n\nWell, you can.\n\nIn this post, we’ll discover nine resources that let you learn a language while driving. Plus, learn the five steps to maximizing your learn-while-driving time.\n\nContents\n\n1. Michel Thomas\n\n2. Pimsleur\n\n3. Teach Yourself Complete Courses\n\n4. Living Language\n\n5. Assimil\n\n6.

Click here to get a copy. (Download)\n\n1. Michel Thomas\n\nSummary: This course makes you speak from the beginning, with no reading and writing required.\n\nMichel Thomas is a language learning product that has been around for a long time, and their entire method focuses on oral language.\n\nCurrently, Michel Thomas offers audio-based courses in 18 languages, including French, Spanish, Japanese and Arabic.\n\nI love that Michel Thomas courses focus on conversational skills right from the get-go, honing in on common vocabulary and phrases.\n\nRather than rote memorization, these courses had me using the language actively and engaging in mock conversations with native speakers. This is a great way to prepare for real conversations that you could have with native speakers later.\n\nMuch of Michel Thomas’ instruction is in English as an added benefit. I found that this helped me to grasp various language concepts more easily.\n\n2. Pimsleur\n\nSummary: An audio course heavily focused on verbal communication to improve your listening and speaking skills.\n\nPimsleur is also a well-known audio-learning resource, and they have courses in more than 50 languages, including German, Ukrainian, Chinese and Persian.\n\nThe audio lessons are 30 minutes each—the ideal length for my car journey to work!\n\nThe lessons focus on conversational topics, helping learners build a strong core vocabulary and get a handle on common grammar structures.\n\nThis core vocabulary and grammar will be beneficial for creating meaningful sentences in your target language.\n\nWhile once an audio-only course, I was happy to utilize some new features to the program—such as the flashcards, quizzes, pronunciation tools and reading practice—which I’ve found to be a great source of extra practice after driving.\n\n3. Teach Yourself Complete Courses\n\nSummary: Textbook-accompanying audio recordings with tons of listening activities and a focus on everyday conversations.\n\nFrom my experience, the Teach Yourself series is one of the most well-rounded approaches to language learning, focusing on all four major language learning skills and to-the-point grammar.\n\nTeach Yourself courses are actually based on a textbook, but each unit comes with native audio dialogues and other recordings. Lessons span common vocabulary topics with in-depth grammar analysis and countless exercises.\n\nWhile using these courses, I completed the lessons in the textbook first and then listened to the dialogues while driving.\n\nThis is a great way to enhance listening and speaking skills and vocabulary retention in the long term.\n\nAdditionally, Teach Yourself offers audio-only apps through the “Get Talking, Keep Talking” and “Coffee Break” series. These are shorter podcasts aimed at teaching one bite-sized chunk of the language at a time.\n\n4. Living Language\n\nSummary: Textbook-based courses with audio units you can complete for vocabulary reinforcement after each chapter.\n\nLike the Teach Yourself courses, Living Language courses match audio learning with a workbook in more than 20 languages.\n\nIn my experience, the lessons are particularly effective for speaking and listening practice as they revolve around a particular dialogue and topic.\n\nA transcript of this is given in the workbook alongside specific vocabulary and grammar notes, and each lesson comes with audio recordings and dozens of workbook exercises.\n\nAfter doing the lesson in the workbook, I listen to the dialogues repeatedly while driving. This keeps the newly-learned vocabulary in the forefront and allows me to get used to various sentence structures.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the Living Language website no longer exists, but all of the textbooks and audio CDs are still available on third-party selling sites like Amazon.\n\n5. Assimil\n\nSummary: Textbook courses that let you learn mostly through audio if you choose. The focus is on receptive and productive language skills.\n\nFounded in 1929 by polyglot Alphonse Chérel, Assimil is the oldest language learning program on our list!\n\nIt offers hundreds of courses in foreign languages, and with many 21st-century advancements, these courses are available as an app.\n\nThe method behind Assimil is to teach languages intuitively, having learners assimilate the sounds, words and grammar structures of the target language.\n\nI’ve found this immersion method to be particularly useful, especially at the start of learning a new language.\n\nIn fact, there are two phases to an Assimil course.\n\nThe “Impregnation Phase” has lessons of 30 to 40 minutes aimed at helping learners absorb the language naturally through listening and reading.\n\nThe “Activation Phase” allows students to use the language creatively and fluidly, focusing on written and oral production.\n\nBoth phases are ideal for learning a language while you drive, as they activate the two hands-off skills of listening and speaking. Assimil courses can be audio-based, textbook-based or a combination of both.\n\n6. Linguaphone\n\nSummary: Native speaker recordings with optional accompanying texts that improve active speaking and listening skills.\n\nLinguaphone’s philosophy is simple, and it revolves around three steps: listening, understanding and speaking.\n\nEach lesson starts with native audio for listening, and then the audio is dissected by the accompanying text for comprehension.\n\nI love the speaking step: rather than just repeating words and phrases, Linguaphone has you create new sentences, translating from English into the language you’re learning.\n\nThis allows you not only to imitate the native speakers and perfect the accent, but also to use the language actively.\n\nLinguaphone offers courses in 16 languages, including Turkish, Korean and Greek available for MP3 download directly to your phone.\n\n7. LanguagePod101\n\nSummary: Podcast courses that cover everything from native conversations to grammar explanations.\n\nUnless you’ve lived under a rock for the past 10 years, chances are you’ve encountered LanguagePod101 before.\n\nPerhaps most popular because of its YouTube videos, LanguagePod101 offers podcast-based courses in more than 30 languages, all available on an app.\n\nSome of their most popular include FrenchPod101, SpanishPod101 and GermanPod101.\n\nEach lesson revolves around a podcast, whether an audio clip of a native dialogue or a more lecture-like lesson dissecting a grammar concept or vocabulary haul.\n\nWhile the podcasts can stand alone, the LanguagePod101 online platform features written tutorials, flashcards and transcripts, videos available in-app and on YouTube and more.\n\nThis is perfect for reinforcing the learning you’ve done from listening while you drive!\n\n8. News in Slow\n\nSummary: Slowed-down podcast recordings designed for language learners that deliver the news completely in your target language.\n\nWho doesn’t like to catch up on the news while driving?\n\nNews in Slow is not really a language learning course, but rather an app and podcast aimed at upper beginner and intermediate learners.\n\nIn each 15 to 30-minute lesson, top news stories are presented in the target language in simplified vocabulary and with slow, clear pronunciation.\n\nCurrently, News in Slow offers four languages: Spanish, French, Italian and German.\n\nEach lesson comes with a PDF document, built-in English translations and flashcards for enhanced learning.\n\nI found it most useful to listen to each news podcast first for big ideas (see step 2 of “How to Learn a Language While Driving in 5 Steps”) and then go through the accompanying PDF to fill in the blanks.\n\nThe best part is that new News in Slow lessons are produced weekly.\n\nThis means that you have an endless stream of target language content ready for you at your level. And since it is based on current news, the words you learn are directly applicable to your language learning journey.\n\n9. Speakly\n\nSummary: App with 15+ hours of conversations that focus on teaching the most commonly used words.\n\nWhile not solely a listening-based app, Speakly combines many language learning skills with an extensive audio library in seven languages.\n\nThese include Spanish, French and Russian but also lesser-studied languages like Finnish and Estonian.\n\nThe best part about Speakly is that it focuses on teaching the “4000 most statistically-relevant words.” In other words, you’ll learn the most frequently used words (aka, the most important ones) first.\n\nThis will make navigating common conversations in your target language easy around applicable topics like directions, food and shopping.\n\nWhile the app does have study options for writing, it boasts more than 350 conversations and 100 hours of study time.\n\nEach conversation also has speaking input options for learners to focus on pronunciation and fluidity.\n\nWhy Learn a Language While Driving?\n\nWho says you need a desk or a classroom to learn a language? Turns out you just need a steering wheel and car speakers.\n\nA Good Way to Use Dead Time\n\nIt’s not uncommon for us to see time in the car as dead time: we have to keep our eyes on the road, our hands at ten and two and our attention focused on driving safely.\n\nHowever, with more than eight hours a week spent in the car, we can utilize some of our other senses to engage in meaningful language learning.\n\nIn fact, just 100 hours are needed to meet the CEFR A1 level for languages like French. At eight hours a week, you could reach this in 13 short weeks.\n\nFocus on Audio Learning\n\nSince your hands are occupied, learning a language while driving will help you focus on listening skills.\n\nThis is one of the four major language learning skills alongside speaking, writing and reading. And though it is often overlooked, it should comprise about 25 hours of the 100 hours needed to reach the CEFR A1 level.\n\nWith audio-only learning material, driving can train your ear to the language. Repeating the same audio lessons also allows you to retain words and grammar structures more easily.\n\nWatching videos in your target language is also a great idea for extra audio learning when you’re not behind the wheel.\n\nFor example, the authentic videos on FluentU let you hear exactly how a language is used in different contexts, and you’ll pick up more natural speech as a result. Plus, it comes as an app which makes for easy learning on the go (just not while driving, of course!).\n\nFluentU takes real-world videos—like music videos, movie trailers, news and inspiring talks—and turns them into personalized language learning lessons.\n\nWith FluentU, you hear languages in real-world contexts—the way that native speakers actually use them. Just a quick look will give you an idea of the variety of FluentU videos on offer:\n\nFluentU really takes the grunt work out of learning languages, leaving you with nothing but engaging, effective and efficient learning. It’s already hand-picked the best videos for you and organized them by level and topic. All you have to do is choose any video that strikes your fancy to get started!\n\nEach word in the interactive captions comes with a definition, audio, image, example sentences and more.\n\nAccess a complete interactive transcript of every video under the Dialogue tab, and easily review words and phrases from the video under Vocab.\n\nYou can use FluentU’s unique adaptive quizzes to learn the vocabulary and phrases from the video through fun questions and exercises. Just swipe left or right to see more examples of the word you're studying.\n\nThe program even keeps track of what you’re learning and tells you exactly when it’s time for review, giving you a 100% personalized experience.\n\nStart using the FluentU website on your computer or tablet or, better yet, download the FluentU app from the iTunes or Google Play store.

(Expires at the end of this month.)\n\nSpeaking Practice Without the Pressure\n\nRemember how I said that speaking was a major language-learning skill in addition to listening? Well, talking to yourself in the car is a great way to practice speaking skills!\n\nYou can repeat words after the resource you’re using, honing in on pronunciation and increasing the accessibility of new vocabulary in your long-term memory.\n\nYou can even practice speaking all alone. This removes the stress and pressure of speaking a new language with a partner.\n\nHow to Learn a Language While Driving in 5 Steps\n\nStep 1: Preload and Queue Apps for Learning\n\nThis post couldn’t come without a disclaimer, so here it goes.\n\nLearning a language in the car should not be a distraction to driving. I never recommend writing anything down, reading or fiddling with your smartphone during driving.\n\nYou need to focus on driving safely first and following the steps to learn a language safely.\n\nThis is my language learning in the car routine: first, I preload the lesson data from my chosen app before I start driving so I don’t have to do so while I’m driving.\n\nIf I think the lesson may be too short, I use the “repeat” feature so I can listen to the lesson multiple times.\n\nI do this using Android Auto, but similar features are available through Apple CarPlay. In a pinch, a smartphone with an AUX cord will do the trick as well.\n\nI then press play, I throw my car into DRIVE and I’m cruising to foreign language fluency.\n\nStep 2: Listen for Big Ideas\n\nOn a first listen to an audio lesson—especially as a learner attempting to reach the CEFR A1 level—don’t get hung up on the details. You won’t understand every word, trust me!\n\nInstead, you should focus on the “gist” or the main idea of the lesson. This should include looking out for key vocabulary or grammar structures, or maybe even attempting to understand the big idea of a listening comprehension activity.\n\nStep 3: Repeat, Repeat, Repeat\n\nNow you’re ready for a deep dive: listen to the same lesson many times and repeat new vocabulary as you hear it.\n\nThis will ensure you hear important target language vocabulary used over and over again, anchoring it in your head.\n\nI also recommend you look up unknown words in between listens—while parked, of course.\n\nWrite these down and review them often. This will help aid in comprehension, allowing you to fill in gaps you may have missed during a first listen.\n\nStep 4: Write Down What You Remember\n\nAfter repeating the lesson multiple times, its content should become familiar to you.\n\nSo familiar, in fact, that I challenge you to write down what you remember the next time you’ve arrived at your destination—all in your target language.\n\nSummarizing information is an important skill to have for A1 and A2 learners, and you should include all main ideas and as much new vocabulary as you remember.\n\nYou could also turn this into a full-fledged writing activity, focusing on the finer details of the lesson to maximize learning potential.\n\nStep 5: Recite the Lesson to Yourself\n\nAs a final step, the student becomes the teacher: give the lesson back to yourself as if you’re giving a lecture to someone else about the topic. Don’t forget to do this in the target language.\n\nThis will further internalize everything you’ve learned and allow you to create novel sentences with key vocabulary. For an extra challenge, give this lesson unscripted.\n\nWho knew that driving and mastering a language weren’t mutually exclusive?\n\nWith these nine apps and your new language learning while driving skills, you can commute your way to fluency in your new language.
