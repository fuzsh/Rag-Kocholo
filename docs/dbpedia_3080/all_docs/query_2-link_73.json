        "text": "Yes! We offer a group discount for reservations of 15 or more guests! Click here to learn more.\n\nOccasionally, other special offers and discounts are available. You might find these promotions via email, social media, or in your mailbox. If you would like to receive notifications of these special offers, be sure to sign up for our mailing list.\n\nMissing any part of the show is no fun! While we understand this and would love to seat you immediately if you arrive late, we’re not always able to do so.\n\nIn order to ensure the safety of all our guests, actors, and animal actors (who use the aisles in darkened show conditions), we cannot guarantee that we will be able to seat you immediately.\n\nThe theater doors will close promptly at show time. If you arrive after the start of the show, the House Manager will determine when and where you will be seated. Please know that we may not be able to seat you until intermission. To get the most out of your Sight & Sound Theatres experience, please plan to arrive 45 minutes before your scheduled show time.\n\nAlthough the shows are best suited for ages 5 and up, children of all ages are welcome. Children under the age of 3 may sit on a parent’s lap and do not require a ticket. Children aged 3 and older do require a ticket and their own seat.\n\nWe offer booster seats to provide young children with the best possible view. If you think your child may need a booster seat, please speak with one of our ushers when you arrive. Should your child become restless or need a break, we do offer a Family Room at both the Lancaster and Branson theaters, where you can watch a live video feed of the show.\n\nYes, we offer American Sign Language interpretation at both theaters for select dates and times. Please call us at (800) 377-1277 for more information.\n\nIn addition to sign language interpretation, the Lancaster theater also offers hand-held language translation devices. These devices provide subtitles in English as well as several other languages. The availability of these devices is limited, so we recommend reserving them in advance by calling (800) 377-1277."
