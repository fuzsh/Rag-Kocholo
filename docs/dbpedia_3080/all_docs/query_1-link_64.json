        "text": "See also:\n\nThe Imperfect Tense\n\nThe Preterite Tense\n\nThe Imperfect Tense and The Preterite Tense are both ways to talk about actions that happened in the past. Learning when to use which is one of the more frustrating things a Spanish student has to do because we just don’t think the same way in English. We have only one past tense conjugation and it tells us simply one thing — the action happened in the past. Consider this sentence:\n\nI went fishing.\n\nWhat’s the time frame of this action? Clearly the fishing took place in the past. However, we don’t know anything more about the situation than that, do we? For example: did the fishing occur once or many times?\n\nTo get across to the reader or listener important information such as when or how often this event occurred we have to add some extra information:\n\nI went fishing yesterday.\n\nI went fishing every morning.\n\nIn the first sentence we know that the fishing happened once. In the second we know it happened repeatedly.\n\nMost of the decision to use either the preterite or the imperfect boils down to the difference in the two example sentences above. In Spanish, information as to whether the event happened once or went on for a while is “built in” to the conjugation you choose.\n\nLet’s start with the imperfect ...\n\nWhen to Use the Imperfect Tense\n\nNote: For this lesson imperfect conjugations will be indicated like this: imperfect conjugation\n\nRepeated, Usual, Habitual Actions\n\nWe mainly use the imperfect tense when talking about repeated, usual, or habitual actions in the past:\n\nLos sábados yo jugaba con mi vecino.\n\nOn Saturdays I played with my neighbor.\n\nUsualmente él llegaba temprano.\n\nHe usually arrived early.\n\nMi madre siempre me preparaba desayuno.\n\nMy mother would always prepare breakfast for me.\n\nIn the first example we use the imperfect jugaba (rather than the preterite jugué) because we see this happened repeatedly, over the course of many Saturdays. In the second we use the imperfect llegaba (rather than the preterite llegó) because we know from the context that this was a usual activity. And in the third we use preparaba (rather than preparó) because this was a habitual action that happened often.\n\nWords such as “always,” “frequently,” “generally,” “never,” “often,” “usually,” “used to,” and “would” clue us into the fact that we should use the imperfect.\n\nBackground Information\n\nWe use the imperfect to describe the setting or provide background information such as what people, places, or conditions were like at some unspecified time in the past:\n\nLa ciudad era vieja y sucia.\n\nThe city was old and dirty.\n\nLa sirenita se llamaba Ariel y tenía seis hermanas.\n\nThe little mermaid was named Ariel and she had six sisters.\n\nTimes and Ages\n\nWe also use the imperfect to state the time and people’s ages in the past:\n\nIsabel tenía ocho años.\n\nIsabel was eight years old.\n\nEra la una de la mañana.\n\nIt was one in the morning.\n\nOngoing Actions\n\nSee also: The Imperfect Progressive\n\nAdditionally, we use the imperfect to describe actions that were ongoing or in progress at some point in the past. This is roughly equivalent to using the imperfect progressive. In these sentences, when the action began or ended is unimportant, it just happened to be occurring at that moment:\n\nRosa hacía su tarea a las 9:00.\n\nRosa was doing her homework at 9:00.\n\nYo dibujaba el lunes por la mañana.\n\nI was drawing Monday morning.\n\nTranslating the Imperfect\n\nBecause in English we only have one past tense conjugation, we often have to resort to adding words to get our exact meaning across. Consider these sentences. All three English sentences could be translated the same way in Spanish, and any one of the English sentences might be the best translation of this one Spanish sentence, depending on context:\n\nWhen to Use the Preterite Tense\n\nNote: For this lesson preterite conjugations will be indicated like this: preterite conjugation\n\nSingle, Completed Actions\n\nIf the imperfect is primarily used to describe actions that happened over and over again, what is the preterite used for? You’re right! To talk about single, completed actions that took place at specific points in time:\n\nEl sábado yo jugué con mi vecino.\n\nOn Saturday I played with my neighbor.\n\nAyer él llegó temprano.\n\nYesterday he arrived early.\n\nMi madre me preparó desayuno esta mañana.\n\nMy mother prepared breakfast for me this morning.\n\nSince the actions referred to in these examples are one-time events, we choose the preterite. In the first case we use the preterite jugué (instead of jugaba) because the playing we’re referring to only occurred once, on Saturday. Likewise, in the second case we choose the preterite llegó (instead of llegaba) because we’re referring to one arrival, yesterday. And lastly, mother prepared breakfast once, this morning.\n\nTime cues such as length of time, or a specific year, season, month, day, or time of day indicate that we should be using the preterite.\n\nThe Imperfect vs. The Preterite\n\nDifferences in Meaning\n\nThis might be a good time talk about why it’s called the “imperfect” tense. It doesn’t have anything to do with quality, but rather the idea that the action is “incomplete;” it doesn’t have a specific beginning or end. Because we’re using the imperfect and not attaching a definite time frame to these actions, we’re indicating that when they began and when (or if) they ended is unknown or unimportant. For example:\n\nMarcos se sentía enfermo.\n\nLa plaza estaba decorada para la fiesta.\n\nEsmeralda tenía que regresar a casa.\n\nHacía frío.\n\n“Marcos was feeling sick.” (We don’t know exactly when he started feeling bad or if he’s now feeling better.) “The plaza was decorated for the party.” (Who knows for how long?) “Esmeralda was supposed to return home.” (We’re not sure when or if she did.) “The weather was cold.” (When or if the weather changed isn’t important.)\n\nOn the other hand\n\nLet’s look at the same examples, this time with preterite conjugations and definite time frames. Now we are explicitly stating when the action started, lasted, or ended, and therefore indicating that the time frame is important. Because of this we are subtly indicating that a change has occurred:\n\nLa semana pasada Marcos se sintió enfermo.\n\nLa plaza estuvo decorada por un mes.\n\nEsmeralda tuvo que regresar a casa el martes.\n\nHizo frío hace dos días.\n\n“Last week Marcos got sick.” (Marcos started feeling sick last week.) “The plaza was decorated for one month.” (But it isn’t anymore.) “Esmeralda had to return home on Tuesday.” (And she did.) “The weather was cold two days ago.” (But it’s much warmer now.)\n\nNote: Due to their meanings, some verbs tend to be conjugated in the imperfect tense and some verbs are more naturally preterite. Because the verb soler means “to usually” or “to be in the habit of” it cannot be used in the preterite.\n\nDue to the differences in emphasis between a preterite and imperfect conjugation, some verbs will have significant differences in meaning when translated. Hopefully by now these variations will make some sense to you. Notice how the preterite tends to signal a change:\n\nThe Imperfect and the Preterite Together\n\nSee also: The Imperfect Progressive\n\nIt’s not at all uncommon to have both preterite and imperfect conjugations in the same sentence. In fact, it happens a lot. The imperfect (or the imperfect progressive) is used to explain what was happening when a preterite action occurred:\n\nLos perros dormían cuando Carlos entró.\n\nThe dogs were sleeping when Carlos entered.\n\nCuando llegaron a la carretera el tiempo hacía calor.\n\nWhen they reached the highway the weather was hot.\n\nYo me caí mientras que estábamos corriendo.\n\nI fell while we were running.\n\nFor Visual Learners\n\nIf you’re still having trouble with the imperfect and the preterite, sometimes it can be advantageous to imagine a time line. On the right side is the present (we’ll ignore the future for now). Toward the left is the past.\n\nIf you know with any certainty when the action happened, you should be able to pinpoint on the time line (with an arrow) exactly when it happened. For example:\n\nOn Saturday his friend went to the baseball game.\n\nOn the other hand, if you find it difficult to pin down, you may have to indicate only an indefinite range (with a squiggly line) of the action. For example:\n\nHis friend was a good baseball player.\n\nSo, what good does this do us? Whenever you would draw an arrow, you should use the preterite; whenever you would draw a squiggly line, you should use the imperfect. Like this:\n\nEl sábado su amigo fue al partido de béisbol.\n\nSu amigo era un buen jugador de béisbol.\n\nAnother example:\n\nEsperanza broke her arm when she was a girl.\n\nThis sentence has two verbs which both go on the time line: “broke her arm” and “was a girl.” One of the verbs was a one-time event, the other was a situation with an indefinite time frame so we’ll use both an arrow and a squiggly line.\n\nTherefore the translation is:\n\nEsperanza rompió su brazo cuando era niña.\n\nOne more example:\n\nWhen Paco was a boy he lived in Oslo for a year.\n\nChildhood has a vague, indefinite time frame so we draw it with a squiggly line. But what do we do with “lived”? It is neither a one-time event, nor is it indefinite. It’s actually a range; we know Paco moved to Oslo and left a year later. Since you can pinpoint a beginning and/or and end of an action on a timeline, you should treat it like you would a one-time event.\n\nTherefore:\n\nCuando era niño Paco vivió en Oslo durante un año.\n\nImperfect vs. Preterite: A Final Note\n\nOne of the reasons learning the preterite and imperfect is so difficult is that it’s not an exact science. Sometimes you can switch from one tense to the other without substantially changing the meaning of the sentence. Other times you’ll completely change the meaning. There may be times when reading Spanish that you won’t be able to tell why the author used the conjugation he or she did because it won’t seem to follow any of the rules. Just roll with it. As you get more and more used to reading Spanish, you’ll be able to pick up on the subtle nuances that let you know why a verb is conjugated the way it is."
