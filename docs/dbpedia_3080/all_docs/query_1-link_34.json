        "text": "The language barrier is often one of the most prominent concerns for foreigners who want to live in Japan, but how are things now?\n\nYou may have heard that Japan may not have the most open culture when it comes to foreign languages, but historically, there‚Äôs a reason for that. Being the island nation that it is, the country has been closed off to the outside world for much of its history, especially considering the fact that the true streamlining of international travel only dates back to the last few decades.\n\nWhat‚Äôs more, with a long history under its belt, Japan has mostly stayed homogenous in terms of its population, which meant that speaking only Japanese was the norm, and learning a second language wasn‚Äôt a true necessity.\n\nAdding the culture of shame that shuns making any mistakes, learning a new language and putting it into practice was simply not an option for many. Even if English had been compulsory in schools before 2011, students would‚Äôve been too shy to speak up for fear of saying something wrong and embarrassing themselves.\n\nHowever, while the idea that it‚Äôs impossible to get by in Japan by only speaking English could be deemed true a few decades ago, things are different now. The status is changing rapidly thanks to reforms to the education system and the globalization movement that‚Äôs influencing all nations on Earth.\n\nIn this post, I‚Äôll explain how common it is to find people who speak English in Japan and whether you can travel to ‚Äî or live in ‚Äî Japan as someone who only speaks English. I‚Äôll also talk about the current state of English education in Japan and how things are changing.\n\nLet‚Äôs get right into it.\n\nIn this article: üìù\n\nEnglish Proficiency Among The Japanese Population: Does Japan Speak English?\n\nTraveling to Japan Without Speaking Japanese: How Hard Is It to Find English Speakers in Japan?\n\nLiving in Big Cities Like Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto: How Widely Is English Spoken in Japan?\n\nFinding English Speakers in Japan‚Äôs Rural Areas: Is Living in The Countryside Possible Without Speaking Japanese?\n\nConclusion: Does Japan Speak English?\n\nEnglish Proficiency Among The Japanese Population: Does Japan Speak English?\n\nAs I mentioned, up until recently, speaking English wasn‚Äôt as common in Japan. The country has been struggling with an ineffective English education system for a long while, as the main goal has mostly been about passing an exam rather than being able to hold a conversation.\n\nWhat‚Äôs more, due to the culture, students have always been afraid to make mistakes, which has led them to not participate in classes. Adding the culture of shyness and being considerate of others‚Äô time to the equation, and you have a class full of students politely nodding even when they don‚Äôt understand the subject.\n\nHowever, things are changing rapidly, especially since 2011. In 2011, English education in Japan became compulsory starting from fifth grade, and this threshold has since been further lowered to third grade relatively recently.\n\nThus far, the government‚Äôs efforts seem to be fruitful. According to a report from 2022, English proficiency among Japanese students has been consistently increasing. More specifically, there‚Äôs a three percentage point increase between the statistics from 2019 to 2021 in terms of English proficiency among junior high school students.\n\nIn addition, the same report also states that English proficiency hasn‚Äôt just been on the rise for students but for English teachers as well. The number of English teachers with a proficiency level of B2 and above has also increased by 2.9 points since the previous report.\n\nAll in all, English proficiency has been an increasingly common point of concern among Japanese parents in recent years. A recent ranking shows that English lessons, or more specifically, ‚ÄúEnglish conversation‚Äù lessons, have been the third most popular tutoring subject for children.\n\nTherefore, with the help of globalization and the government‚Äôs efforts, it‚Äôs safe to say that English proficiency levels are consistently rising among the Japanese population.\n\nTraveling to Japan Without Speaking Japanese: How Hard Is It to Find English Speakers in Japan?\n\nWhile it‚Äôs true that English proficiency levels may be on the lower side among the Japanese, most are just too shy to speak up or express themselves but are able to when the occasion arises. So, if you need to ask someone for directions or go to a hotel or a restaurant, you will generally have no problem only speaking English.\n\nOf course, you may go to a bar or a restaurant and get turned away because you only speak English, but don‚Äôt be offended if this is ever the case. This isn‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt serve people who don‚Äôt speak Japanese but because they don‚Äôt speak English themselves, which makes them feel like they can‚Äôt adequately serve you.\n\nOf course, the abovementioned case is merely a rarity in big cities like Tokyo or Kyoto. Most of the time, you‚Äôll always be able to find someone who speaks English at your hotel or restaurant, so there‚Äôs no need to worry. There are also English signs in most tourist-oriented places nowadays, which makes navigation quite easy.\n\nWith this overview in mind, let‚Äôs dive deeper into specifics and take a look at what the situation is like in terms of public transport, eating out, and sightseeing.\n\nUsing Public Transport as a Non-Japanese Speaker\n\nWhen traveling in Japan, especially if you‚Äôre in one of the big cities such as Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto, you‚Äôll generally have no problem not speaking Japanese at all. There are usually English signs all over train stations and airports.\n\nYou can simply use the machines to buy your public transport tickets, which usually have a language option and can operate in English. The tickets themselves are also in both Japanese and English.\n\nAs for finding your ride and navigating the platforms, you‚Äôll also find that both English and Japanese are featured on the boards and signs. The same thing goes for when you get on the subway or bus and need to know what station you‚Äôre on. You‚Äôll see the names of the stations in English as well, so you can just relax and enjoy the ride.\n\nAccommodation as a Non-Japanese Speaker\n\nAnother thing people often worry about when they plan their visit to Japan is whether the hotel they‚Äôre staying at will have English-speaking staff. For big cities like Tokyo and Osaka, or touristic cities like Kyoto, this is an irrelevant concern as most hotel staff in these cities speak English, or at the very least, there are at least one or two people who speak English. Keep in mind that this may not be the case for smaller cities.\n\nSimilarly, many people also assume that staying at an Airbnb instead of a hotel is a gamble because they think that the Airbnb owners may not speak English.\n\nAs I explained extensively in my post on staying at an Airbnb in Japan, this is far from the truth, as most Airbnb hosts in Tokyo, Osaka, or Kyoto usually do. Of course, this may not be true if you‚Äôre renting an Airbnb in the countryside.\n\nSo, most Airbnbs in the big cities of Japan offer a very streamlined experience. You probably won‚Äôt even need to communicate with the host to get the keys, as there‚Äôs usually a key box for which you‚Äôll be provided with a code. Besides, most Airbnb hosts speak English, and if they don‚Äôt, you can also use the translation functionality on the Airbnb website.\n\nEating Out as a Non-Japanese Speaker\n\nIf you‚Äôre dining out and don‚Äôt speak Japanese, there‚Äôs no need to worry. Most of the restaurants and bars in big cities like Tokyo and Osaka that are frequented by foreigners will usually have an English menu or at least one English-speaking staff member. The same goes for restaurants and cafes around tourist spots as well.\n\nOn the other hand, even in big cities, some local restaurants may not have an English menu or an English-speaking staff member present. However, it‚Äôs quite common for menus to feature pictures of the items in Japan, which can help guide you in the most dire cases.\n\nIn a similar vein, even if there are no pictures on the menu, you may still be able to see what the food looks like. Believe it or not, it‚Äôs very common for restaurants in Japan to have plastic models of food items in a display cabinet. You can pick the one that looks the most appetizing or go for the ones that are on the top shelf, which usually are the best sellers anyway.\n\nAlternatively, if you‚Äôre in a local area, and there‚Äôs no English menu at the restaurant you‚Äôre at, you can be a little adventurous and ask the staff for their recommendations. To do so, simply say ‚Äú„Åä„Åô„Åô„ÇÅ„ÅØ„Å™„Çì„Åß„Åô„Åã (Osusume wa nan desu ka?),‚Äù which means ‚ÄúPlease recommend something,‚Äù and the staff will be happy to help you out.\n\nShopping Without Speaking Japanese\n\nAs I explained, if you‚Äôre visiting as a non-Japanese speaker, you‚Äôll generally have no trouble finding someone who speaks English in restaurants, hotels, and public transport in big cities like Tokyo or tourist cities like Kyoto. Not only is there always someone who speaks English, but you‚Äôll also see most things written in both Japanese and English.\n\nIn most big cities in Japan, things are pretty much similar when you go shopping as well, except you may not always find English-speaking staff. Most shops, especially big ones that are part of a chain, have prices and descriptions in English in addition to Japanese on the labels and on the signs in the store.\n\nThe only thing I‚Äôd personally look out for is not to enter the changing rooms with your shoes on, which may sound jarring, but it makes sense in terms of hygiene.\n\nOn the off chance that you end up in a place where no one speaks English, and none of my recommendations above work out, you can check out my post on some of the most basic phrases you can use in Japan to learn useful phrases you can use in restaurants, hotels, and other public places.\n\nLiving in Big Cities Like Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto: How Widely Is English Spoken in Japan?\n\nNow that we covered everything tourist-related, let‚Äôs talk a little bit about living in the big cities in Japan like Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka as a non-Japanese speaker.\n\nWhile you may have a generally easy time as a tourist in Japan, if you don‚Äôt speak a word of Japanese, living here is much tougher.\n\nStill, compared to the Japanese countryside, living in Tokyo, Kyoto, or Osaka is totally doable if you‚Äôre open to learning Japanese over time or at least enjoy picking up some new words and phrases here and there as you go about your day.\n\nSo, if you‚Äôre considering living in Japan, I recommend learning Japanese, even if it‚Äôs just a little bit. It‚Äôs true that Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka are all relatively international cities with a foreign population, but it‚Äôs restricted to small areas.\n\nFor instance, in Tokyo, you may find that it‚Äôs easier to get by speaking English in small areas such as the Minato or the Shibuya ward, where most foreigners live. There are also many major banks, embassies, and big IT companies located in these areas, which makes living in Tokyo without speaking Japanese somewhat doable.\n\nHowever, most people do this for a limited period, as they eventually need to deal with the government in terms of visas or the like, which is only conducted in Japanese ‚Äî with a few minor exceptions. Similar to other countries, you‚Äôll also find that the English proficiency rate is higher among younger and more educated people, but this still isn‚Äôt the case for the majority.\n\nBut‚Ä¶ What If You Don‚Äôt Speak Japanese at All?\n\nIf you‚Äôre considering living in one of Japan‚Äôs big cities and don‚Äôt plan on learning the language for whatever reasons you may have, I‚Äôm here to tell you that it‚Äôs possible, even though it‚Äôs hard.\n\nFor instance, as I explained above, you‚Äôll most likely have no trouble going to restaurants and bars in big or touristic cities that foreigners frequent, which all have menus in English in addition to Japanese, and they usually have a few English-speaking staff as well.\n\nEspecially considering the fact that you also have the power of a translation app in your palm at any given moment, you‚Äôll probably do just fine dining and drinking outside, even by yourself.\n\nThe same goes for public transport and shopping as well. You can pretty much move around freely and shop to your heart‚Äôs content without having to speak a word of Japanese.\n\nFor more serious stuff, such as moving, you can also find companies that operate in English or at least have English-speaking staff and support. I talked about all of this and how to find English-speaking companies in my guide to moving in Japan, which is sure to come in handy.\n\nAnother serious concern when you don‚Äôt speak the local language is, of course, healthcare. While this one is a bit trickier, as you don‚Äôt know when an emergency will arise, you can definitely find hospitals with English-speaking staff in big cities, especially around the areas where foreigners mostly live.\n\nSo, finding an insurance company that provides support in English, along with finding out which hospitals have English-speaking staff, is a good way to be prepared for emergencies, which will allow you to live much more at ease without speaking Japanese.\n\nWhat About Socializing and Networking?\n\nIt‚Äôs no secret that human beings are social creatures. Even though your physical needs are met, if you don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre a part of society, you may start to feel unmotivated over time. Besides, socializing is a basic human need that prevents symptoms that are related to depression.\n\nAs I mentioned, despite the country‚Äôs welcoming culture, the low English proficiency rate in Japan doesn‚Äôt exactly make it the best place for foreigners to socialize. This is why you‚Äôll need help finding like-minded individuals to make friends or network with.\n\nLuckily, Japan‚Äôs big cities like Osaka, Tokyo, and Kyoto all have a pretty diverse international scene where you can meet people that share the same interests as you. All you need to know is where to look, and you‚Äôll be glad to know that I can help with that.\n\nI talked about this in my post on the best tech communities and meetup groups in Tokyo, but Japan is no short of great international communities you can join if you‚Äôre in the tech world. Whether you‚Äôre a designer or a developer, you can find people you can be friends with or make meaningful connections that can help you advance in your career.\n\nSimilarly, Osaka and Kyoto also have great communities you can join as a non-Japanese speaker. You can check out all of these groups and communities I introduced in my posts about the tech communities in the Kansai region and the tech communities in Fukuoka.\n\nAdditionally, another great way to have an English-speaking circle is by working at international companies. Finding a job that only requires English can help you meet people with a similar background and can make living in a foreign country easier, as you‚Äôll get to speak English throughout the day.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for jobs in Japan, you can check out the job board on Japan Dev, which is updated frequently and features many listings that only require English.\n\nFinding English Speakers in Japan‚Äôs Rural Areas: Is Living in The Countryside Possible Without Speaking Japanese?\n\nAs I said, considering Japan‚Äôs low English-speaking rate, the countryside is a tough place to live for foreigners that don‚Äôt speak Japanese at all. While big city life is far more forgiving toward those who only speak English, the outskirts might not exactly agree with you.\n\nI‚Äôll come out and say it: living in Japan‚Äôs countryside as a non-Japanese speaker is tough, to say the least. Even though you may not exactly need to be proficient in Japanese, you‚Äôll still have to learn some basic words and phrases to get you through daily life.\n\nIn the countryside, towns and villages have much more closed-off communities, and there‚Äôs a sense of neighborliness that you‚Äôll miss out on without speaking Japanese. As there isn‚Äôt as much to do in the countryside, people rely on each other‚Äôs company, and interacting with others is a bigger part of daily life.\n\nSo, if you want to move to Japan‚Äôs countryside, I strongly recommend that you learn Japanese. You don‚Äôt need much ‚Äî start by learning simple things, like how to say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù or ‚Äúhow are you.‚Äù You can also check my posts on basic Japanese phrases and the best tools for learning Japanese.\n\nAlso, if you‚Äôre actually considering moving to rural Japan, I talked about Japan‚Äôs countryside, or inaka, in another post, explaining the challenges and benefits of living in the countryside and whether it‚Äôs for everyone.\n\nConclusion: Does Japan Speak English?\n\nAs I explained, Japan may not have the biggest number of English speakers, but things are surely improving as there‚Äôs a visible increase in the country‚Äôs English proficiency rate.\n\nBesides, one of the most popular professions in Japan for foreigners is working as an English teacher. According to the statistics, this isn‚Äôt a coincidence, as English lessons are among the top three most popular special tutoring subjects in Japan.\n\nThe government‚Äôs regulations and the awareness it causes among the general public certainly help, and you can travel or build a life in big cities like Tokyo or Osaka even if you don‚Äôt speak Japanese at all.\n\nYou can easily navigate your way through English signs in public transport and stations, and most of the time, you‚Äôll have an English-speaking staff or an English menu in restaurants. Besides, the translation tools we carry around on our smartphones nowadays are more than enough to get by in daily life.\n\nAs I said, there are also many communities in these cities where you can make friends. You can get a job at a company that has an international environment, like the ones we feature in the Japan Dev company list, and get by fairly easily. You‚Äôre sure to pick up some useful Japanese phrases as you live in Japan anyway, but it should be fine even if you don‚Äôt.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the countryside is a different story. As rural towns rely on a sense of community to function, it may not be the best idea to move to Japan‚Äôs inaka if you don‚Äôt speak Japanese or are not willing to learn."
