        "text": "Some of your comments and examples of Singlish:\n\nSome slangs that are more commonly used among students include \"mugging\", which means studying very hard, \"siao\", meaning to the extreme, and \"sian\", meaning tired and boring Vanessa Kin, Singapore\n\nIf something is disagreeable, people will yell \"alamak!\" Tom, Singapore\n\nGrowing up in Singapore, my parents used to frown upon the usage of Singlish, whether we were talking informally at home or with others while outside. They'd insist that we spoke proper English and even had me attend English-language tutorial classes, in addition to having English lessons at school. They'd also prohibit us from watching local TV programmes where the use of Singlish was prevalent. Consequently, I grew up not being able to hold a decent conversation in Singlish and that presented problems for my social life, e.g. ordering food at a local food centre was difficult if the stall owners couldn't understand what I wanted. The problem was especially bad during my National Service conscription period, where I had to work hard to integrate myself with the rest of the boys as we slogged through training together and also having to make sure I didn't incur the wrath of the instructors and trainers because I appeared to be too \"posh\" as it were. These days, I've learnt to switch between speaking proper English and Singlish depending on the situation I find myself in. Although I do not live in Singapore anymore at the moment, I still find myself smiling whenever I hear Singlish, and realise it's really a part of our national heritage. James Wong, Tokyo, Japan\n\nWhen I lived in Singapore, your \"sunnies\" were your sunglasses, your \"swimmies\" was your bathing suit, and I was expecting at the time, so people would ask if I had been to the \"gynie\", meaning the gynecologist! Aileen, NYC, USA\n\n\"So bad one lah\" (a random expression for something disagreeable!) Chwee, Swindon, England\n\nPhrase: Pattern more than badminton. Explanation: Style over substance Lum Wai Loon, Singapore\n\nWhen I was in Singapore I was asked questions such as \"Where you go?\" So when I went on their very modern Metro system I was amused to hear an announcement in slow and meticulous \"BBC English\" saying \"Please mind the gap\". (The gap incidentally was minuscule compared to some of those on the London Underground.) David Jenner, Bamford, UK\n\nBeing a transplanted Singaporean, I am glad (from this article) that I am perceived to be 'better educated' and not just 'atas' (snobbish!) However there are occasions when even I am baffled, most recently after watching a music video (proudly Made In Singapore!), \"Unbelievable\" where I came across the phrase \"stunned like vegetable...\" Now even I admit to being blur like sotong when it comes to this! Nicholas Tan, Salford, UK\n\nHaving lived in the region for four years, the language felt very efficient, using prepositions as words - \"Can you on the fan?\" \"Can you off the aircon?\" - to be always met with the response \"OK lah!\" Andrea, Marlow, UK\n\n\"Want to go out. Can or not?\" Question: \"Have you been to Malaysia?\" Answer: \"Ever!\" Daniel Muthuswamy, Chennai, India\n\nI may have lived abroad for many years, but I definitely retain my Singlish skills. It evolves continuously with new terms getting introduced every year I return. In Singapore, speaking Singlish builds instant rapport, and because of its nuances, people can easily distinguish between a real native or a newbie. Not using Singlish in a non-work setting when someone is evidently local makes the person appear \"jumped up\" or insecure about their culture and identity, especially if compounded by a fake foreign (ie US/UK/Aussie) accent. I'm glad that the 'establishment' are recognising the real role Singlish plays in creating cohesion within this multiracial space. Sharliza, London, UK\n\nMy favourite is \"see how\" in answer to a situation whose outcome you can't predict, so you wait to \"see how\" it turns out. Andra Leo, Singapore\n\nBeen to Singapore once. I am amused with calling someone \"uncle\" even if it's not your relative. Chitetskoy, Manila, Philippines\n\nI learnt Singlish when I went to a local school in Singapore around Siglap where the first phrase I learnt was \"relax lah brother, can tankap one corner\" from this Malay kid. But I have to say one of favourite phrase is \"boh jio! never invite me leh!\" whenever I go back to Singapore mainly to visit my dad I somehow unconsciously start speaking Singlish as my lingua franca language amongst my old Singaporean friends but I do get stumped at the coffee shops when I order the different variations. You going from \"Could I have a flat white and a bacon roll please\" in London to \"Uncle! Kopi ci Kai Ci! Kaya toast one!\" David Houghton, UK\n\nFavourite phrase is definitely \"Eh that level of jio is bo\" which is another way of saying \"bojio\", meaning \"Why you never invite me?\" Denise, Singapore\n\nI love Singlish. It is colourful, expressive and reflects the wit, humour, history and multiculturalism of Singaporeans. When I first arrived I struggled with the quick delivery, the lilt and the Malay / Hokkien / appropriated words but Singaporeans are resourceful and there was an app for that! I downloaded it and soon I was ordering limau asam boi and yong tau foo in my favourite hawker centre with confidence. A Carey, London, UK\n\nThe article misses out on the word \"Kiasu\". Used profusely in Singapore previously it has less popularity among Singaporeans now because it is a negative term denoting a behaviour emanating from intense materialism, a selfishness ( the 'Me' syndrome) and a desire to be liked at the same time as being looked up to. Choo Weng Choong, King's Lynn, UK\n\n\"Sian\" is one word in Singlish that can be used in a many contexts and accurately expresses emotions so I like it a lot because it's so efficient. Generally it means to be sick and tired of something or bored or being caught in bothersome situations you can't do anything about. E.g. English: I'm so sick and tired of going to work every day. Singlish: Everyday go work, very Sian. English: The plane got delayed. Singlish: Plane delay, Sian. Caryn, Singapore\n\nYou forgot to mention the phrase \"Same Same\" - you can go around all day and say this! it covers a multitude of meanings and everyone understands what you mean, although this phrase is not just limited to Singlish, you can use it all over South East Asia. Tom Ayre, Kristiansand, Norway\n\nMy wife is Chinese and uses lah all the time. My favourite of her expressions is when she puts her phone on silent: \"No ding dong\" Andy, Baldock, UK\n\nActually Singlish was developed in both Malaysia and Singapore, not just in Singapore alone. And the most used word in \"lah\" is a Malay word. Tones are very important. And adding a word to \"can\" with a correct tone can bring eight different meanings to can: Can ah ? - Can you?; Can la - Can; Can leh - Yes, I think so; Can lor - Yes, Of course; Can hah? - Are you sure?; Can hor - You are sure then; Can meh? - Are you certain?; Can bo? - Can or not; Can can - Confirm; Can liao - Already done Ng Wah Lok, Malaysia\n\nMy kids speak impeccable English being products of British and now Australian school system. My wife and I are often under close scrutiny from them on grammar, and use of idioms. The only way we rebel against the kids are when we speak really \"deep Singlish\" with a spatter of colloquial Malay. It's funny as we observe the kids often scratch their heads trying to decipher the words. Most of the time they only come to know the meaning when we go back to Singapore / Malaysia to visit family. It's me and my wife's only \"secret language\" around the house. I do welcome the acceptance of Singlish as more mainstream but now it means that me and my wife have to learn a new language (perhaps Russian \"govoryu Pa-russki\") to confuse the kids! Ahmad Nazhar, Perth, Australia\n\nOnly Singaporeans can understand and appreciate: Singlish is the only language in the world that expresses with emotion from text messages. Simon, Singapore\n\n\"Area Masjid Sultan is a decent makan place la...\" said my friend Ansari. A Singaporean born but now settled down with his family in Sydney. \"Makan\" is a Malay word for eat and \"Masjid\" is borrowed from Arabic for mosque. That short sentence above means, \"You can get a decent food nearby Sultan Mosque...\" Mohd Ayub Sulong, Mayfield, Australia\n\nThe Singlish expression \"WALAOEH!\" is an all-time favourite. It is used mostly to express disapproval, but can also be used to show one's disbelief, ie. a surprise. For example, when visiting a durian stall, one may say \"Walao-eh! This durian so big sia!\" Mike Lim, Singapore\n\nQuestion: \"How are you? Are you ok?\" Possible answers: Ok lah (I'm fine); Ok lor (I'm fine, I guess); Ok lah! (I'm definitely fine); Ok meh? (Am I ok? Don't think so) James, Singapore\n\nI like the long phrases because they are so unique and amusing. \"Pattern zuay guay badminton\" is a derogatory term for someone sneaky who has got lots of hidden designs. \"Chop chop Kali pop (curry puff)\" just means hurry up! Li Ching, Singapore\n\nI do like the way Singlish draws on other languages for certain words that just don't have an equivalent in English: my favourite is the loan word 'pai-kwan' taken from Hokkien. It refers to someone who is too eager for any kind of financial gain, no matter how small. For example, \"He is so pai-kwan one: when he realized that they were giving out free samples, he shamelessly jostled his way to the front of the queue, knocking over a few old ladies in the process.\" Alex Liang, London, UK\n\nThe use of 'ever' to replace 'have' is quite common. \"You go Bangkok, is it? I ever go there oready\" translates to \"You're going to Bangkok, are you? I've already been there.\" Ken, Montreal, Canada\n\nI going to watch movie, ghost movie lah , sure very nice one, you want to follow me? Today my mother cooked nasi goreng, so sedap lah, come lah I give you some.. Dewi, Italy\n\n\"No more already\" means , \" it's over long ago..\" Mukunda, Bangalore\n\nYou know a Singaporean is worth his or her salt when they hear, \"eh that guy so stylo milo (trying too hard to be stylish)\" and replies, \"yeah he think he some yaya papaya (someone who thinks he or she is very important)\" Rebecca, Singapore"
