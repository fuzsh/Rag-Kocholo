        "text": "Who is Rachel?\n\nA world-traveling, ex-opera singer with a passion for languages and human connection.\n\nConnecting with other cultures is a passion of mine, and I’ve been teaching ESL since 1999 when living in the Dominican Republic for a semester in college. I learned quickly: helping students with speaking⸺pronunciation and listening skills⸺is my real passion.\n\nI became interested in developing a pronunciation-focused resource while living in Germany under the Rotary Ambassadorial Scholarship program in 2008.\n\nMy initial idea in developing Rachel’s English was to make the kind of resource for self-study that I wished I could find for my own foreign language study. As a classical singer, I spent many hours immersed in singing in German, French, Italian, and Spanish. I studied with highly acclaimed vocal teachers and coaches and bring a body of detailed knowledge connected to the voice, placement, and the musical nature of speech to my work as a pronunciation coach."
