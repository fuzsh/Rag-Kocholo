        "text": "Just how common is your language? Do you say what or pardon? Sofa or couch? Lavatory or toilet?\n\nEtiquette expert William Hanson\n\nThese are just some examples of words categorised as U and Non-U by the linguist Professor Alan Ross in 1954. U refers to upper class and Non-U refers to non-upper class. The U and Non-U list was popularised by the socialite Nancy Mitford two years later and became a way for people to discover whether someone was upper class, or merely aspiring to be so.\n\nOn Radio 4's U and Non-U: Does Anyone Still Care?, etiquette expert and author William Hanson has updated the guidelines to create a new list that combines words from the original guide with updated language from today’s world. If you don’t want to sound common, what words should you not be saying? Here are William’s top ten Non-U words to avoid at all costs!\n\n1. Toilet\n\nThis was on the original 1950s list and, to be honest, I’d rather chew glass than use the word toilet in polite conversation. It’s a harsh word that was adapted from the French toilette which means your appearance, hence toiletries bag. Lavatory or loo is much more acceptable.\n\n2. Pardon?\n\nThe non-upper classes stole a lot of words from the French language to try and sound like they had a higher social standing. \"Pardon\" is a classic example of trying to sound upper class when you’re really not. Keep it simple and just say \"what?\" \"I beg your pardon\", however, is fine.\n\n3. Bubbly\n\nLet’s be honest. The word \"bubbly\" was invented to make people feel less guilty for serving prosecco rather than Champagne at a party. Bubbly is a big Non-U giveaway. There’s no need to beat around the bush, so no matter what you’re pouring into the glass just say Champagne or prosecco.\n\nThere is only one acceptable way to greet someone, and that is with the word hello. Hey is what horses eat.\n\n4. Lounge\n\nYou only find a lounge at an airport. Simple. When you’re in your house you relax in the sitting room or drawing room. I also don’t agree with the use of living room as a description for the room where you spend most of your time. You live in every room of your house, correct?\n\n5. Latte\n\nThis is another example of the non-upper classes using words from different languages to try and make themselves sound like they’re upper class. If you want a coffee, just ask for a coffee. It’s rare that U folk would want a faffy drink such as a latte. There’s no need to get all complicated\n\n6. Hey\n\nIf you’re so lazy that you have to shorten a five letter word to a three letter word then you are most certainly Non-U. There is only one acceptable way to greet someone, and that is with the word hello. Hey... is what horses eat.\n\n7. Banter\n\nWords popularised by TV like banter should be avoided at all costs. What does banter even mean? The upper classes don’t need to borrow words that may be in fashion for a few months, so the more traditional repartee is preferable. When Non-U speakers say that the banter is great it usually is tedious and predictable.\n\nCleese, Barker and Corbett lampooned the class system in 1966\n\n8. Vintage\n\nThere are a lot of euphemisms when it comes to words on the Non-U list. Seemingly those from the non-upper classes feel the need to avoid the obvious when it comes to language usage. That shirt you’re wearing isn’t vintage, it’s old. When it comes to furniture, there’s no such thing as vintage, it’s antique.\n\n9. iPhone\n\nOh, brand names. If you feel the need to describe things using a make or model then you’re most certainly Non-U. Those in the upper classes are confident in their social standing, so there’s no need to get all flashy. If something is ringing in your pocket, it is a phone regardless of brand.\n\n10. Movie\n\nWhen it comes to language, avoid Americanisms at all costs. I’m aware that it may seem glamorous to use words from Hollywood, but when it comes to British class, think York not New York. You visit the cinema to watch a film and never a movie.\n\nMore from Seriously...\n\nWhy Ian McMillan loves being early\n\nThe early-bird poet and broadcaster tries to arrive early to everything.\n\nWhy Ian McMillan loves being early\n\nFake wine – honestly, it’s a thing\n\nHere’s what Radio 4 has uncorked about the fake wine industry.\n\nFake wine – honestly, it’s a thing\n\nFive Steps to the Creative World of Cosplay\n\nAn insight into the world of fictional characters brought to life by devoted fans.\n\nFive Steps to the Creative World of Cosplay\n\nThe death and rebirth of Zora Neale Hurston\n\nOnce forgotten, she is now revered by everyone from Alice Walker to Solange Knowles\n\nThe death and rebirth of Zora Neale Hurston\n\nSeven of literature's lustiest lovers\n\nFrom Tom Jones to Adrian Mole, have a look at lust in literature.\n\nSeven of literature's lustiest lovers\n\nMeet the cyborgs\n\nFive people who have modified their bodies with technology.\n\nMeet the cyborgs\n\nMiles Jupp asks if a woman invented James Bond...\n\nPhyllis Bottome is little known today, but did she inspire Ian Fleming?\n\nMiles Jupp asks if a woman invented James Bond...\n\nFive ways to burst your social media bubble\n\nDJ and presenter Bobby Friction on how to escape the online echo chamber.\n\nFive ways to burst your social media bubble\n\nThe Story of The Green Book, by Alvin Hall\n\nA travel guide like no other, for black motorists in the mid-20th Century it was a catalogue of refuge.\n\nThe Story of The Green Book, by Alvin Hall\n\nApathy in the UK by Phill Jupitus\n\nThe comedian and broadcaster on boredom.\n\nApathy in the UK by Phill Jupitus\n\nWhat is a 'curvalicious' body?\n\nBridgitte Tetteh explores attitudes to female bodies in the black community.\n\nWhat is a 'curvalicious' body?\n\nSitting for David Hockney\n\nArt critic Martin Gayford learns what it's like to be painted by a modern master.\n\nSitting for David Hockney\n\nWhy having a baby needn’t subdue your inner geek\n\nFive tips from Isy Suttie.\n\nWhy having a baby needn’t subdue your inner geek\n\nMiles Davis on canvas\n\nThe legendary trumpeter's second life as a painter.\n\nMiles Davis on canvas\n\nEy Up!
