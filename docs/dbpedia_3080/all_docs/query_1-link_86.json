This article is going to cover the average cost of living in Mérida Mexico, what it’s like being an expat in Merida, the weather in Merida (the city’s biggest dealbreaker), and more.\n\nI have been in Mexico since 2018 and traveled around for a while before ultimately settling down in Merida in July 2019.\n\nIt is a beautiful, colorful city with fun cultural celebrations, great food, and plenty of day trips for the weekends. It’s also the safest city in Mexico! For me, Merida is obviously a good place to live. But will you love living in Merida Mexico?\n\nIn this article, I’m going to shine a light on life in Merida — the good and the bad — so you’re armed with enough information to see if Merida expat life might suit you.\n\nOf course, the best way to see will be to visit, but until you can, I hope this article gives you a lot of guidance.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\nWhere is Merida Mexico located?\n\nMerida is the capital of Yucatán State, one of the three states making up Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, which is in the southeastern part of the country.\n\nIt is the largest city in the Yucatan — the population of Merida, Mexico is about one million — and the 13th biggest city in Mexico.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\nMerida Mexico Map\n\nWant to see some maps of Merida that better explain the city, the best neighborhoods in Merida and more? Check out this article, Merida Mexico Map: Where is Merida Located?\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\nIs Merida on the beach?\n\nNo — Merida is further from the beach than many think! Puerto Progreso is the closest beach to Merida, and is located about 40 minutes away by car or bus.\n\nIt is one of several beaches near Merida Mexico, located on the Gulf of Mexico, and easily accessible on the AutoProgreso Bus for about $25 pesos ($1 USD) each way. These buses run every 30 minutes or so and are very convenient.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\n15 Pros and Cons of Living in Merida Mexico\n\n1. Pro: It’s the Safest City in Mexico\n\nMerida Mexico crime rates are the lowest in the country, as it’s among the safest cities in Mexico.\n\nIn fact, CEOWorld magazine called Merida the second safest city on the continent after Quebec City, Canada — while not a single U.S. city made their Top 50 Safest Cities list!\n\nIs Merida Mexico Safe for Travelers? [Locals’ Tips]\n\nMerida has also received other accolades from CEOWorld. In 2021, readers named it the #3 best small city in the world (San Miguel de Allende, Mexico was #1).\n\nSimilarly, Conde Nast Traveller magazine readers named Merida the #4 Best City in the World in 2022.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\n2. Con: Merida Weather in Summer is HOT\n\nAs mentioned, Merida ticks a lot of boxes — but if you don’t like hot, tropical weather — it likely won’t tick your boxes.\n\nTo find out how you’ll do in the tropics, plan to visit Merida during the hottest months of the year, May to September. While this certainly isn’t the best time to visit Merida Mexico, it will show you Merida at its worst.\n\nFrom May to September, even Merida locals dread the weather when daytime temperatures hover around 95°F (35°C). With the humidity, temperatures feel even a few degrees higher 🥵\n\nDuring summer nights in Merida, expect about 87°F (30.5°C), so not a huge drop.\n\n🌡 Weather in Merida: Temperature Averages\n\n💡 Living in Merida Tip\n\nThough it’s very hot in Merida, some homes don’t have air conditioning — many people, especially those native to the Yucatan, actually prefer to live without it.\n\nIf you need AC, like I do, make sure to pick a place that has it, and maybe even somewhere with a pool. Just check in any living in Merida Mexico expat forums and you’ll see how coveted a pool really is!\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\n3. Pro: Lots of Mayan & Mexican Culture\n\nMerida is known as the Cultural Capital of Yucatan and one of the best places in Mexico to immerse yourself in Mayan Culture.\n\nBesides the Mayan Ruins near Merida, including Chichen Itza, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, the city itself hosts numerous cultural events.\n\n🪅 Annual Festivals in Merida Mexico\n\nEach January, there’s Merida Fest, a citywide cultural and performing arts festival.\n\nThis large festival boasts live music, folk dancing groups, Mexican and international artists, visual arts events, and theater performances across several venues.\n\nFor the Spring and Fall Equinoxes, many gather at Dzibilchaltún Mayan Ruins to see the sun shine through the center of the Temple of the Seven Dolls.\n\nIn late October, there’s Hanal Pixan (ha-naal pick-shawn), the Mayan Day of the Dead Celebration and Paseo de las Animas, the Parade of Souls.\n\n🎉 Weekly Events in Merida Mexico\n\nOn Monday nights at 8 pm, head to the Municipal Palace in Plaza Grande (Main Plaza) to see the Lunes de Vaquería Yucateca dance production of the jarana and other folkloric dances.\n\nEach Saturday night, see a Pok Ta Pok Mayan ball game played in front of the Merida Cathedral in Plaza Grande at 8 pm.\n\nOn Friday nights at 7:30 pm, there’s Piedras Sagradas (Sacred Stones), a video-mapping show that tells the Mayan history of the Yucatan, projected on the front of the San Ildefonso Cathedral.\n\nAt 8 pm on Saturday nights, enjoy Diálogos del Conquistador (Dialogues of the Conquerors) video-mapping show projected on the front of the Museo Casa Montejo Museum — one of the best museums in Merida.\n\nAlso, in Plaza Grande, head to Domingo en Merida (Merida Sunday Market) on Sunday mornings to buy local Mayan honey, plants, handicrafts, clothing and more from vendors.\n\nOn Sunday mornings from 8 am-12 pm, the Paseo de Montejo shuts down for car traffic and is open only to bike riders during the BiciRuta, the Merida Sunday bike ride.\n\nIf you don’t want to bike, local artists and vendors line the sidewalks, selling everything from handmade art to vegan tamales.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\n4. Con: Rising Cost of Living in Merida Mexico\n\nIf Merida’s starting to sound ahh-mazing to you — you’re not alone. In the three years I’ve lived here, I’ve started to see rents going way up.\n\nWith more and more people working remotely, many from the U.S. and Europe have moved to Mexico for a lower cost of living.\n\nWith this influx of digital nomads and people moving to Merida with their U.S. Dollars and Euros comes higher price tags. While this can vary from year to year, Merida rents often rise about 8% each year.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\n5. Pro: You Don’t Need a Car in Merida\n\nOne of the things I absolutely love about Merida is that I can walk everywhere.\n\nNow, I live in Centro Historico (Historic City Center), not far from Paseo Montejo, so I’m in a walkable area. For those in North Merida, you’ll need a car.\n\nHowever, for those who want to live in Downtown Merida, there’s no need for a car. If you want to take one of these Merida day trips or even weekend trips, you can always rent a car in Merida, or take the ADO bus. For in-town trips, there’s Uber.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\n6. Con: Mexican Government Bureaucracy\n\nOne of the things I’ve learned in Mexico is patience! Everything from getting the bill at a restaurant to getting a building permit for your house can take a while.\n\nThere’s a word in Mexican slang, ahorrita, which can mean something will be done in one hour or in four months. You just never know when you hear the word ahorrita.\n\nWhen dealing with any government office, expect things to take even longer.\n\nI recently got my Mexican Temporary Residency Card, and it took about 10 hours and two visits to the Immigration Office — though I met others while waiting who were on their third visit and had to come from a neighboring state.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\n7. Pro: So Many Things to Do in Merida\n\nOne of my favorite things to do is just walk around and take photos of the beautiful historic colonial buildings in Downtown Merida.\n\nThere’s also the charming Paseo de Montejo to take a leisurely stroll, fun cantinas at night, and plenty of museums and art galleries.\n\nBesides the city itself, you have so many options for great day trips from Merida! Within 1-3 hours of Merida, there’s everything from Mayan Ruins, Merida beaches, swimmable cenotes, and even natural pink lakes.\n\nYou’re also near other great places in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula, like Izamal, Valladolid, Holbox Island, Tulum, Cancun, Playa del Carmen, Campeche State, Bacalar Lagoon — and even more places!\n\nEven if you don’t have a car, you can visit by bus or rental car.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\n8. Con: Merida Water Sucks\n\nIf you’re wondering, Can you drink the water in Merida Mexico? The answer is no!\n\nMexico tap water isn’t safe for human consumption. However, shower water is also quite harsh, as it’s filled with sarro (calcium), which will dry out your skin. A few apartments and homes have water softeners installed, but it’s not the norm.\n\nTo combat skin dryness, I use this Palmers lotion, and go through a bottle every two months! Some people also say Merida water dries out their hair, but I haven’t experienced that.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\n9. Pro: Yucatan Food is Amazing\n\nMexico Fun Fact: The Yucatan used to be its own country, which was called the Republic of Yucatan.\n\nAfter traveling to half the states in Mexico, I always tell people it should still be its own country since it’s quite different from the rest of Mexico.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons for this is most Yucatecans are of Mayan descent, versus Central Mexico and other parts of the country with primarily Aztec descent.\n\nOne such difference is the amazing Yucatan cuisine, which isn’t what many know as traditional Mexican food. The food definitely makes life in Merida Mexico more amazing.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\n10. Con: Merida is Getting Touristy\n\nMerida is one of the most up-and-coming Mexico travel destinations, so living here means sharing the town with tourists.\n\nTourists aren’t an issue per se, but it does mean things are more crowded (especially on weekends), and Merida prices will only continue to rise.\n\n11. Pro: There’s a Merida Airport\n\nMerida is pretty easy to get to, as you can fly into Merida International Airport (code: MID), located about 20-30 minutes from downtown. Keep reading for the con to the airport in Merida Mexico ⤵\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\n12. Con: Merida Airport has Limited Flights\n\nCurrently, there are only direct flights from Miami and Houston in the U.S., but the airport is currently expanding, so there should be more in the future.\n\nIf you can’t get a direct flight, the Mexico City and Guadalajara Airports have connections to MID.\n\nAnother option is to fly into Cancun International Airport (code: CUN), then head from Cancun to Merida.\n\nIt is a four-hour drive, and I recommend using Cancun Airport Transportation if you’re not planning on renting a car in Cancun for the drive.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\n13. Pro: It’s Easy to Meet People\n\nThough it has a population of about one million, Merida still somewhat feels like a small town (ok, maybe a medium-sized town).\n\nIf you live and hang out in and around Downtown Merida, you’ll usually run into the same people when you go out — which makes it easier to make friends.\n\nFor a deep dive into this topic, head to the section on How to meet people in Merida.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\n14. Con: Merida is Loud\n\nReally, all of Mexico is loud! I live in Centro Historico, the colorful and historic part of town, so I definitely live in the loudest part of town.\n\nIf you want to be in the quieter, more tranquil part of town, opt for North Merida, which is more suburban — or just sleep with good earplugs.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\n15. Pro: Good WiFi Speeds\n\nAs one of the digital nomads in Merida, I have never had any issues working online doing “normal” work or going to Zoom meetings, or even streaming Netflix.\n\nIf you’re working with big files and doing video rendering, Merida might be more hit-and-miss for you.\n\n🗣 Want more living in Merida Mexico Reddit info? Head to the r/Yucatan subreddit!\n\nIf you want to read more about peoples’ experiences with Merida WiFi, this Reddit thread will give you a good idea of what to expect.\n\nI just did a speed test from my house in Downtown Merida as I’m typing this, and I got 63.35 down and 40.73 up. We have Telmex internet.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\nWhat’s the Average Age for Expats in Merida Mexico?\n\nThe Merida expat demographic skews in the 30s-50s range, which is a bit older than many digital nomad destinations.\n\nAs you might imagine, Merida is not really a party town. There are some cool cantinas and hidden speakeasies, but this isn’t an all-party night town.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\nHow do I meet other expats in Merida Yucatan Mexico?\n\nI’m definitely an introvert, but the Merida social scene never felt very intimidating to me. People are generally nice, unpretentious, and curious about new people who move to town.\n\nTo help my fellow introverts out, here are some ways how to meet people in Merida.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\nFrequent the Same Places\n\nI used to work from Cafe Marago most days of the week; it’s the best Merida cafe for digital nomads, hands down.\n\nAfter a few weeks, I’d see the same faces of people also working online, and we’d naturally gravitate into conversations.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\nTake Spanish Classes\n\nAnother place I met people very easily was in my Spanish classes. I went to La Casita, but I’ve also heard great things about La Calle and Hola — three of the best Spanish schools in Mérida Mexico.\n\nDo I need to learn Spanish to live in Merida?\n\nWhile you can get by with English (there’s even a Merida English Library), knowing how to speak Spanish makes living in Merida 1,000 times easier.\n\nAs you’d imagine, everyone in the classes were Merida expats, so there’s a social aspect to the classes.\n\nAs an added bonus, you’re also learning Spanish so you can better communicate while living in Merida while also connecting with expat communities in Mexico Merida.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\nMerida Facebook Groups\n\nAs with a lot of Mexico, Facebook Groups are the best way to network online. Here are a few recommendations for the best Facebook groups about Merida: Mexpats Mérida,Merida Mexico Expat Community andExpats In The Yucatán.\n\n🗣 A note on Merida expat forums\n\nThey can be hit or miss, so take things with a grain of salt. I’ve got both great information from very sincere members of the Merida expat community and some of the rudest, most snarky comments from others.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\nWhat’s the best area to live in Merida Mexico?\n\nThe best neighborhood in Merida depends on your needs and wants, and your deal breakers. However, the two most popular for expats are Centro Historico and North Merida.\n\nIf you want to be near all the historic buildings and colonial architecture, that’s in Centro (Downtown Merida). For a gated community and new construction home, that’s in Merida Norte (North Merida).\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\nWhat are the best neighborhoods in Merida Mexico?\n\nThe majority of expats in Merida either live in Centro Historico or North Merida.\n\nCentro Historico, the Historic City Center or Historic Downtown Merida, is divided into smaller areas, and is about 25 minutes from North Merida. There are a lot of new construction buildings in the north, another popular area with expats.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\nBest Areas in Colonia Centro\n\nNearly any part of Centro Historico is a great area to be in — and it’s actually where I live.\n\nThe map below highlights some of the best areas in Centro by name, including Paseo Montejo, Santiago, Santa Lucia, Garcia Gineres, Itzimna, La Mejorada and San Juan.\n\n🏡 Colonias in Merida\n\nColonias (literally, “colonies”) are the older, historic areas of Merida. Centro Historico, for example, is in Colonia Centro — so if you see the word Colonia before a name, it’s one of the older parts of Merida.\n\nBesides Centro, Colonia Mexico is also popular with Merida expats.\n\n🏡 Fraccionamientos in Merida\n\nFraccionamiento (meaning “fractions,” and pronounced frac-see-oh-nah-me-en-toe) is the U.S. equivalent of a large subdivision or gated community.\n\nAll homes in the development are the same size, and all look similar. Nearly all Merida fraccionamientos are in the North.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\nAverage Merida Cost of Living\n\nIs Merida Mexico cheap?\n\nIt depends on where you’re comparing it to, as Merida is definitely cheap compared to London, San Francisco and NYC. In fact, according to Numbeo statistics, Merida is 59.3% less expensive than New York.\n\nIf you want to know, Is Merida cheap compared to other parts of Mexico? Then, not really; Merida, Mexico cost of living is actually on the pricier side for Mexico.\n\nIf you want to be near Merida, you can always save some money living on the outskirts of town or in the pueblos (small towns) not far from Merida.\n\nSome options include Izamal and Valladolid, two Mexico pueblos magicos (magic towns), as well as Uman, Motul and Espita.\n\nAs Merida is now the 13th biggest city in Merida, the cost of living isn’t what it once was.\n\nHowever, in the places listed above, you can still find the Merida prices of 5-10 years ago — where you can live pretty comfortably at $800 USD per month. Currently, I recommend people have $1,500 USD per month for Merida.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\nHow much money do you need to live in Merida?\n\nAs with most answers to questions about living in Merida Mexico, this one is highly subjective. As a ballpark figure, you’ll want a budget of at least $1,500 USD per month for a single person or $3,500 for a family of four.\n\nI live on about $1,000 USD per month for everything, but my idea of a comfortable life might be uncomfortable for you.\n\n🤑 To see my cost of living in Merida, jump to this section to read about what I pay to live in Merida Mexico.\n\nNow, there are plenty of Merida expats who live on less per month than I do.\n\nHowever, I’d say if you want a nice, comfortable life in Merida, plan for a budget of at least $1,500 USD per month. Once you arrive in Merida, you can adjust up or down from there.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\nHow much do you need to retire in Merida Mexico?\n\nIf you have no desire for creature comforts, you can live on $500 USD per month if retiring in Merida Mexico is your plan. In fact, according to Data Mexico the average Yucatan State salary in 2021 is just $5,150 pesos per month — which is about $260 USD.\n\nSince most will want some degree of comfort during Merida retirement, I’d recommend planning for at least $1,500 USD per month to cover the basics like your rent, bills, groceries and incidentals.\n\nOnce you get to Merida and get acclimated, your cost of living in Merida Yucatan Mexico may go down.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\nRenting an Apartment in Merida Mexico\n\nThere are a few ways you can rent an apartment in Merida:\n\nAirbnb or VRBO: The easiest place to find Merida Mexico rentals\n\nFacebook groups, like Merida Casitas for Rent\n\nFacebook Marketplace, in the “Rentals” section\n\nRental sites like Vivanuncions.com\n\nWalking around in an area you like, looking for Se Renta (For Rent) signs, and calling the number.\n\nAirbnb and VRBO seem the most expensive up front, but remember that those places are “move-in ready.” You just show up, it’s furnished, all utilities and the internet are turned on, etc. For the short term, these are great options.\n\n12 Stunning Airbnb Merida Mexico Options [Picked by a Local]\n\nIf you’re confident in speaking Spanish, you can branch out to Facebook Marketplace, Vivanuncios and call homeowners directly.\n\nKeep in mind that many non-Airbnb rentals will often want three months of rent upfront (first, last and security deposit).\n\nSome even charge more if you don’t have an aval (pronounced uh-vall). This is essentially a co-signer for your lease and has to be a Mexican property owner who will sign for you, saying they will pay your rent if you fail to do so.\n\nI found my apartment in a Merida Facebook group. In general, Facebook is the easiest way to network as an expat in Mexico and to find Merida apartments.\n\nThe best Merida Facebook group for rentals is Merida Casitas for Rent, but general groups, like Merida Mexico Expat Community, can be helpful for leads.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\nAverage Cost of Apartments in Merida Mexico\n\nThe answer depends on what you want and what you need in a place and if you are looking for short-term or long term rentals Merida Mexico.\n\nIt also depends on where you find rentals in Merida Mexico, as Merida Airbnbs and VRBOs have gotten pricey after Mexico started imposing a 16% tax on rental properties, and Yucatan State charges another 5%.\n\n🤑 To see my cost of living in Merida, jump to this section to read about what I pay to live in Merida Mexico.\n\nIf you’re renting on Airbnb, the average cost for a one-bedroom apartment in Downtown Merida is about $800 USD per month with all bills, taxes and fees included.\n\nFor renting a three-bedroom home in Downtown Merida with a pool, plan for about $2,500 USD per month on Airbnb.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\nBuying Real Estate in Merida Mexico\n\nCan I buy real estate in Merida Mexico?\n\nYes — Expats in Mexico can buy Merida real estate. However, Merida Mexico real estate is something you’ll want a realtor to help you navigate the ins and outs of the system.\n\nAs I’ve never done so myself, I always refer anyone who asks me about buying a home in Merida to the Real Estate Course in the Yucatan with Neil, Restoring a Colonial Home in Yucatan Experience with Greg, and the Merida Casitas for Sale Facebook group.\n\nThe only exception I am aware of is that only Mexican citizens can buy property on any of the beaches in Mexico. However, if you have a fideicomiso (bank trust), foreigners can legally buy beachfront homes and land in Mexico.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\nHow’s the Healthcare in Merida Mexico?\n\nMerida has several world-class hospitals and medical facilities, including Clínica de Mérida.\n\nIn fact, the Yucatan State Secretary of Tourism has positioned Merida as one of the best destinations for medical tourism in Mexico and all Latin America.\n\nAs you’ll read in this thread from a Yucatan expat life Facebook group, Merida has the best hospitals and health care in the Yucatan Peninsula.\n\nOf course, some doctors are better than others, so you’d have to do your own due diligence.\n\n🩺 Best Medical Insurance for Expats in Merida\n\nFor inexpensive, quality medical insurance for expats in Mexico, nothing beats SafetyWing. Their monthly plans start at just $42 USD per month (yes, you read that right!), so this is a no-brainer for basic coverage.\n\nGet your FREE SafetyWing quote below ⤵\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\nDo I Need A Visa for Mexico?\n\nNo — U.S. Passport holders and anyone from almost all of North American and Europe do not need a visa for Mexico. If you’re unsure, you can check here to see if you’ll need a visa for Mexico travel.\n\nFor most visitors, you’ll get a 180-day (six-month) FMM Tourist Visa for free upon entering the country if you come by air.\n\nIf you’re driving across the border from the U.S., you’ll pay $594 pesos (about $30 USD) for your FMM.\n\n💡 Note: More and more airports in Mexico are now doing away with the FMM card.\n\nWhen you arrive in Mexico, you will either get the FMM card or a passport stamp; both are valid and serve the same function.\n\n🚙💨 Driving from the U.S. to Mexico? Make sure you’re insured by Baja Bound — as you do need Mexican insurance to drive into Mexico.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\nIn 2021, many visitors started receiving less than 180 days. In years past, it was assumed the 180-day (6 months) visa was a given. However, legally, Mexico only has to give seven days.\n\nThe best way to ensure you get the full amount is to come with proof of your booked Airbnb or Merida hotel, a bank statement showing you have enough money to be in Mexico for six months, and a return flight already booked.\n\nAfter 3-6 months in Merida, you’ll have a better idea of what Mexico Merida living is all about.\n\nIt’s always a good idea to spend some time in the city before committing to your move — including a visit during the hot and humid summer months — to make sure Merida is right for you.\n\n🧾 Merida Bills\n\nIn Merida, your bills should run pretty low.\n\nIf you watch your energy consumption and use the AC sparingly, plan for $50 USD per month for electricity. If you run the AC all day, plan for $200 USD.\n\nWater bills in Mexico are very low, at about $10 USD per month.\n\nFor top-of-the-line WiFi in Merida, plan for $50 USD, though you can get plans for closer to $30 USD.\n\nIf you get a cell phone, your plan with calls and data should run $35 USD per month. Another option is to get a Mexico SIM Card, and pay as you go.\n\nIs the MERIDA PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION good?\n\nMerida does have public transportation, but it’s lacking. For a city of this size, the Merida population is one million, public transportation in Merida isn’t great.\n\nAs I don’t use it, there’s not much I can say — other than it exists, it leaves a lot to be desired, and buses are economical at about $10 MXN pesos ($.50 USD) per ride, depending on where you’re headed.\n\nLiving in Merida Mexico\n\nMerida Transportation Cost\n\nTo buy a car in Mexico, you’ll need your Temporary Residency Visa (which is a Mexico Green Card).\n\nHowever, renting a car in Merida for the weekend is easy, and you just need your passport and driver’s license. A weekend car rental with full coverage insurance costs about $75 USD.\n\nI recommend, and use Discover Cars any time I’m getting a Merida rental car.\n\nMany expats keep their cost of living in Mérida low by not owning a car, as it is a walkable city and Ubers don’t cost much (figure about $5 USD for a 30-minute Uber ride).\n\nPersonally, I walk, use Uber when necessary, and take buses for Merida day trips.\n\nFor eco-friendly, economical travel, the country has a great bus system. The largest bus company in Mexico, ADO, has a fleet of luxury-class buses that service the Yucatan Peninsula, and beyond.\n\nFor weekend trips from Merida, the ADO is a great option.\n\n🌮 Merida Average Monthly Food Cost\n\nOverall, food costs less than in the U.S., including groceries and food in restaurants.\n\nI like to cook at home and spend about $200 USD per month on groceries. If you stop at local outdoor mercados (markets) over indoor grocery stores, you can save even more.\n\nFor cheap eats in Merida, visit the local mercados or pick up snacks from street vendors. In Mexico, nothing beats $0.50 USD tacos on the street!\n\nWhen you want a nice dinner, there are plenty of great Merida restaurants to choose from.\n\n💸 Extras: Cleaning, Laundry, Gym, Movies, Spa, Etc.\n\nAs with many things in Merida, luxury doesn’t come with as high of a price tag as it does in many parts of the U.S.\n\n🧖‍♀️ Merida Spas\n\nSadly, there are not a lot of spas in Merida — though this Mayan Spa is super cool.\n\nFor a spa day, Hacienda Santa Cruz is one of the Merida haciendas located just outside of Downtown. Rooms are about $100 USD per night a Muyal Ha’ Spa day pass is about $30 USD.\n\n💇🏻‍♀️ Haircuts, Mani/Pedi\n\nFor hair services, some hair stylists come to your home and will charge about $500 pesos ($25 USD) for a cut.\n\nIf you go to a luxury salon, the price can double. A mani/pedi in Merida will cost about $25 USD in a nice salon.\n\n🧽 House Cleaning in Merida\n\nIn Mexico, many have someone who comes and cleans their house weekly, biweekly or monthly. Cleaning services cost about $10 USD for three hours of work.\n\n🧺 Laundry Service\n\nThere are no machines in my apartment, so I send my clothes out to a lavanderia. They pick up my clothes, wash, dry and fold them, and bring them back for about $5 USD per large load of clothing or sheets.\n\n💪 Gyms in Merida\n\nA nice gym in Merida will cost only about $10 USD per month and private studios closer to $25 USD for yoga and pilates classes.\n\nFor yoga in Merida, there’s Casa Conexion and private teachers you can find in Merida expat Facebook groups for about $7 USD per class.\n\n🎥 Movie theaters in merida\n\nI opt for Merida’s luxury movie theaters or VIP theaters with recliner seats. Tickets for the Merida VIP movie theaters cost about $6 USD per ticket, and the regular movie theaters cost closer to $2 USD.\n\n🍸 Merida Bars & Drinks\n\nEven in the most upscale of Merida cocktail bars, I’ve never paid more than $10 USD for a cocktail.\n\nIn bars and cantinas frequented by locals, you can enjoy a Mexican beer for $2 USD. However, the costs do go up a bit at bars where a lot of Merida expats hang out, like La Negrita Cantina.\n\nLiving in Merida: Frequently Asked Questions\n\nIs Merida a nice place to live?\n\nYes — If you don’t mind hot weather, Merida is an excellent place to live.
