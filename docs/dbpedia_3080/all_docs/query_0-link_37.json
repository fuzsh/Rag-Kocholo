Adding to the language complexities: Other members of his family only speak Khmer.Â\n\nFor years, apps and manual translations have filled the gap for Hoeun, but Live Translate, a feature on Googleâs Pixel phones, has made communicating across languages (and continents) much easier. It automatically translates messages as they arrive on his device â not just text-based chats but also spoken words, interpreting live audio from one speaker to another â without a separate app.1\n\nâItâs life-changing for me,â Hoeun says. âWe can text without having to switch in and out of different apps â¦ and translate in no time.â\n\nConnecting the world, one conversation at a timeÂ\n\nEven if you donât have family in another country, the global, more connected nature of the world means you may find yourself needing to speak another language. Thatâs where Live Translate on Pixel phones comes in. Only speak French? This feature can help you chat with friends and family in Spanish, Arabic, Japanese, and 17 other languages.Â\n\nDonât have an internet connection? No problem. Thanks to Pixelâs Google Tensor processor, Live Translate puts state-of-the-art speech recognition and language translation right in your pocket, no matter where you are or how strong your network is.Â\n\nOn Pixel phones, Live Translate works across text, camera, videos, podcasts, phone calls, video calls, and audio messages. That means you can read text in another language by pointing the camera at a sign or a menu, or watch a video that isnât in your native tongue with the Live Caption feature.Â\n\nWant to turn your spoken words into audio in another language? Or turn a friendâs responses into audio in your own? Googleâs Live Translate can do both. Just put your Pixel in Interpreter Mode, and voila!\n\nYou can make the Live Translate process even more seamless with Pixel Buds. Letâs say you only speak English, but youâre ordering food in a restaurant in Mexico City. Put your headphones in Conversation Mode by pressing and holding one of the earbuds and then say, âHelp me speak Spanish.â Press and hold the earbud again and start speaking in English. A window will pop up on your Pixel phone, allowing you to select Spanish as the language you want to translate. When the waiter or waitress comes by, tap and hold the microphone button, and your device will translate in real time right into your headphones.2 Amazing, right?\n\nHow to translate on your Google Pixel Buds Pro\n\nYasat Hoeun Itâs life-changing for me. We can text without having to switch in and out of different apps â¦ and translate in no time.\n\nIntroducing Google Pixel, your new interpreter\n\nThe Live Translate feature on your Pixel 8 Pro can translate more than a dozen languages for you in real time, without an internet connection.\n\nIntroducing Google Pixel, your new interpreter\n\nThe Live Translate feature on your Pixel 8 Pro can translate more than a dozen languages for you in real time, without an internet connection.\n\nSpeaking freely in any language\n\nStacie Clymo knows just how helpful Live Translate can be. A leasing and resident manager at an apartment and townhouse community, she says the feature has improved communication with her tenants. âOur residents are often from outside the US, and some do not speak English fluently,â she says.Â\n\nClymo likes to be able to get to know the people living in the community, but she doesnât speak any of their languages. Live Translate streamlines her work and lets her talk freely with just about everyone, whether sheâs making a phone call, speaking in person, or chatting over text.\n\nâOnce I got my Pixel, I started using Live Translate,â she says. âMy residents tell me the translation is spot on.âÂ\n\nLive Translate on Google Pixel 8 Pro"
