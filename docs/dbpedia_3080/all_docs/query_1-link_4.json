        "text": "The first thing you have to understand about my childhood is that it mostly took place in another language. I was raised speaking French, and did not begin learning English until I was nearly 7 years old. Even after that, French continued to be the language I spoke at home with my parents. (I still speak only French with them to this day.) This fact inevitably affects my recall and evocation of my childhood, since I am writing and primarily thinking in English. There are states of mind, even people and events, that seem inaccessible in English, since they are defined by the character of the language through which I perceived them. My second language has turned out to be my principal tool, my means for making a living, and it lies close to the core of my self-definition. My first language, however, is coiled underneath, governing a more primal realm.\n\nFrench is a pipeline to my infant self, to its unguarded emotions and even to its preserved sensory impressions. I can, for example, use language as a measure of pain. If I stub my toe, I may profanely exclaim, in English, \"Jesus!\" But in agony, like when I am passing a kidney stone, I become uncharacteristically reverent, which is only possible for me in French. \"Petit Jesus!\" I will cry, in the tones of nursery religion. When I babble in the delirium of fever or talk aloud in my sleep, I have been told by others, I do so in French. But French is also capable of summoning up a world of lost pleasures. The same idea, expressed in different languages, can have vastly different psychological meanings. If, for example, someone says in English, \"Let's go visit Mr. and Mrs. X,\" the concept is neutral, my reaction determined by what I think of Mr. and Mrs. X. On the other hand, if the suggestion is broached in French, \"Allons dire bonjour,\" the phrasing affects me more powerfully than the specifics. \"Dire bonjour\" calls up a train of associations: for some reason I see my great-uncle Jules Stelmes, dead at least 30 years, with his fedora and his enormous white mustache and his soft dark eyes. I smell coffee and the raisin bread called cramique, hear the muffled bong of a parlor clock and the repetitive commonplaces of chitchat in the drawling accent of the Ardennes, people rolling their R's and leaning hard on their initial H's. I feel a rush-caned chair under me, see white curtains and starched tablecloths, can almost tap my feet on the cold ceramic tiles, perhaps the trompe-l'oeil pattern that covered the entire floor surface of my great-uncle Albert Remacle's farmhouse in Viville. I am sated, sleepy, bored out of my mind.\n\nA large number of French words and turns of phrase come similarly equipped with dense associative catalogues, which may contain a ghostly impression of the first time I understood their use in speech. On the other hand, nearly all English words and phrases have a definite point of origin, which I can usually recall despite the overlaying patina acquired through years of use. Take that word \"patina,\" for example. I don't remember how old I was when I first encountered it, but I know that I immediately linked it to the French patiner, meaning \"to skate,\" so that its use calls up an image of a crosshatched pond surface.\n\nOther English words have even more specific histories. There is \"coffee,\" which I spotted on a can of Chock Full o'Nuts in our kitchen in Westfield, N.J., in 1960, when I was 6. I learned to spell it right away because I was impressed by its insistent doubling of F's and E's. The creative spellings reveled in by commerce in the early 1960's tended to be unhelpful. I didn't know what to make of \"kleen\" or \"Sta-Prest,\" and it took me some time to appreciate the penguin's invitation on the glass door of the pharmacy: \"Come in, it's KOOL inside.\" Then there was the local dry-cleaning establishment whose signs promised \"one-hour Martinizing.\" I struggled for years to try and plumb that one, coming up with increasingly baroque scenarios.\n\nWhen I started first grade, my first year of American schooling -- I had begun school in Belgium at 3 1/2, in a prekindergarten program that taught basic reading, writing and arithmetic -- I knew various words in English, but not how to construct a sentence. My first day remains vivid in its discomfort; I didn't know how to ask to go to the toilet. In addition, my mother had dressed me in a yellow pullover over a white shirt-collar dickey. It was a warm day, and the nun in charge suggested I take off my sweater. Since I didn't understand, she came over and yanked it off me, revealing my sleeveless undershirt.\n\nAs the weeks and months went on, I gradually learned how to speak and comprehend the new language, but between home and school, and school and home, I would pass through a sort of fugue state lasting an hour or two during which I could not use either language. For a while, my mother tackled this problem by tutoring me in French grammar and vocabulary as soon as I got home. It never crossed my parents' minds that we should begin employing English as the household tongue. For one thing, my parents' command of it was then rudimentary -- I was rapidly outpacing them -- and for another, they were never certain that our American sojourn was to be permanent. We were economic refugees, to use the current expression, victims of the collapse of the centuries-old textile industry centered in my native city of Verviers, but my parents' loyalty to their own country was unquestioned.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
