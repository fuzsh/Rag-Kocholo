        "text": "Yet as an adverb\n\nWe use yet as an adverb to refer to a time which starts in the past and continues up to the present. We use it mostly in negative statements or questions in the present perfect. It usually comes in end position:\n\nKevin hasn’t registered for class yet.\n\nI haven’t finished my breakfast yet.\n\nHas she emailed you yet?\n\nWarning:\n\nWe don’t use yet to refer to something that has happened. We use already:\n\nShe’s booked the flights already.\n\nNot: She’s booked the flights yet.\n\nWe don’t use yet to talk about events that are continuing:\n\nElizabeth is still living in Manchester. She’s not moving to London till next month.\n\nNot: Elizabeth is living yet … or Elizabeth is yet living …\n\nYet with negative statements\n\nWhen we use yet in negative statements, it shows that an event is expected to happen in the future:\n\nJason hasn’t phoned yet. (I am expecting him to phone.)\n\nI haven’t seen ‘Who Framed Roger Rabbit’ yet. (I am expecting to see this film.)\n\nYet with questions\n\nWhen we use yet in an affirmative question, it shows that the speaker is expecting something to happen:\n\nIs he home yet? (I expect that he will be home at some point.)\n\nHas your passport arrived yet? (I expect that your passport will arrive in the post.)\n\nNegative questions with yet can express an even stronger expectation that something will happen. When we ask this type of question, we expect a negative answer:\n\nHasn’t Richard arrived yet? (I strongly expect that he should have arrived.)\n\nHaven’t you done your driving test yet? (I feel you should have done your driving test by now.)\n\nYet with affirmative statements\n\nWhen we use yet in affirmative statements, it shows that a situation is continuing, even when we might expect it not to continue:\n\nThere’s plenty of time yet. (even though you don’t think so)\n\nWe’ve got a lot more work to do yet. (even though you think we have finished)\n\nYet with superlatives\n\nWe often use yet after superlatives:\n\nHis latest film is his best yet. (The film is the best one he has made up to now.)\n\nTwo hours and 15 minutes – that’s Jones’s fastest marathon yet!\n\nYet as a conjunction\n\nYet as a conjunction means ‘but’ or ‘nevertheless’. We use it to show contrast. It often occurs after and:\n\nSo many questions and yet so few answers.\n\nIt felt strange and yet so wonderful to ski in the summer!\n\nYet for emphasis\n\nWe use yet for emphasis, with a meaning similar to ‘even’, especially before more, another and again:\n\nThe cook arrived with yet another plate of cake.\n\nThe printer’s broken down yet again! (It has broken down many times before.)\n\nAs yet\n\nAs yet means ‘up to now, but the situation will definitely change’. We only use it in negative contexts:\n\nThe film shows you the most typical places, as yet untouched by tourism, and how to get there.\n\nHave yet to and be yet to\n\nWe use have yet to and be yet to in more formal contexts. We use them to refer to events which are necessary or which must happen at some time, but which have not happened at the time of speaking:\n\nThe price of the tickets for the concert has yet to be decided. (The price will be decided.)\n\nThe President and her husband are yet to arrive. (The President and her husband will arrive.)\n\nSee also:\n\nAlready\n\nAlready, still or yet?\n\nStill"
