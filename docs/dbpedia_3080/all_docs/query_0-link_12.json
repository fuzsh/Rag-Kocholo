        "text": "The Smithsonianâs Mother Tongue Film Festival celebrates cultural and linguistic diversity by showcasing films and filmmakers from around the world, highlighting the crucial role languages play in our daily lives.\n\nWhere and how do we find balance? To create balance is to connect the many branches of our existence, and to connect is to reach an enduring harmony. In 2024, the Mother Tongue Film Festival showcased films that record personal journeys and explore the drive to find balance and harmony within our world, communities, families, and selves.\n\nThank you to the visitors, filmmakers, and volunteers who helped make our ninth annual festival a success! Want to share your feedback? Please take our audience survey.\n\nFilms marked with below are available to stream in full on our website after the festival.\n\nStories of loss, revelation, and recovery can lead us on the path to restoring a sense of wholeness. In this program, youth confront generational trauma and seek to break through for a brighter future. Following the screening, stay for a Q&A with director Xun Sero.\n\nThis program is presented with support from the Embassy of Mexico in the United States and the Mexican Cultural Institute of Washington, DC.\n\nWe invite you on a poignant journey through identity and cultural revival. These films paint a vivid portrait of the struggles and triumphs in reclaiming Indigenous languages. Grape Soda in the Parking Lot and ááá¬áá (We Will Speak) each uniquely testify to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of erasure, highlighting the vital role language plays in connecting us to our past, present, and future. Join us for an evening screening that reflects on and celebrates the power of memory and words to create change.\n\nThis program is presented in collaboration with Planet Word.\n\nIn this program, two films intersect at the crossroads of love and resistance. AikÄne and Y SÅ´N illustrate the spiritual connections that can be formed and the cultural ties that can be broken in the fight against political repression. Though artistically varied, both display the transformative power of commitment, be it to a person or a cause, iterating the fight for identity as a universal narrative. Join this evening screening, followed by a Q&A, and celebrate the indomitable spirit of humanity in its many facets.\n\nThis program is presented in collaboration with Planet Word and with support from the Welsh Government in DC.\n\nThe Mother Tongue Film Festival is a public program of Recovering Voices, a collaboration between Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, the National Museum of the American Indian, the Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage, and the Asian Pacific American Center. Find related resources through Folklife’s Mother Tongue Media and Language Vitality Initiative.\n\nThis program received federal support from the Latino Initiatives Pool, administered by the National Museum of the American Latino.\n\nThis program also received support from Arenet, the Embassy of Australia in Washington DC, the Embassy of Mexico in the United States, Ferring Pharmaceuticals, the Mexican Cultural Institute of Washington DC, New Zealand Embassy to the United States of America, Planet Word, the Welsh Government in DC, and The Elizabeth and Whitney MacMillan Endowment."
