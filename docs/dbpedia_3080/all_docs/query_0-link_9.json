        "text": "Learning and mastering English opens you to a world of career, educational, and even personal opportunities.\n\nEnglish is among the top five world languages in terms of the number of speakers. As of 2022, more than one billion people speak English. This number represents an eighth of the world’s population.\n\nEnglish is one of the world’s universal languages. You will open yourself to many opportunities by adding English to your linguistic arsenal. English proficiency is a must if you are looking to follow a career in many fields, including\n\nTechnology\n\nScience\n\nAcademia\n\nDiplomatic Affairs\n\nGovernment and Public Affairs\n\nMiddlebury Language Schools was ranked the Best Foreign Language Program in 2022.\n\nPrepare for Undergraduate or Graduate Studies\n\nImproving your speaking, reading, and writing skills will make you more competitive if you’re considering going to university in the US or any other English-speaking country.\n\nWhether you’re applying for an undergraduate program or a Ph.D., English proficiency can improve your admission chances.\n\nImprove Your Performance in English Language Proficiency Tests\n\nMastering English allows you to do well in various English assessment tests, namely:\n\nIELTS (International English Language Testing System)\n\nCELPIP (Canadian English Language Proficiency Index Program)\n\nTOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language)\n\nThese tests have different rubrics and standards. English proficiency is crucial to performing well in all of them.\n\nAt the English Language School, we believe in the power of immersive learning. Here are some of the benefits of learning English through immersion.\n\nCultural Immersion\n\nAt Middlebury Language Schools, language and culture go hand-in-hand. Learning a language goes beyond sitting in a classroom: mastering English requires participating in the culture.\n\nBesides our classes, we offer non-academic activities. These activities are a crucial part of the English Language School’s curriculum. Cocurricular activities allow you to practice English in a way that seems like play. We offer activities like movie night, cooking, and even sporting activities.\n\nMastery of English Outside Academics\n\nIn an environment of English speakers, you won’t just learn grammar and vocabulary; you’ll also master other features of English. You’ll learn idioms, connotations, and collocations during your seven-week stay. Mastering these features will help you understand and use English as it’s spoken daily.\n\nLearning and Living the Language\n\nThe Language Pledge is a central part of our language programs at Middlebury. It’s a promise to write, speak, and read in English for the duration of the program. Over time, you will no longer be translating words from your language to English. Speaking English will become natural and more spontaneous.\n\nThis question is hard to answer because, ultimately, it will depend on your personal skills. Are you usually fast to pick up a language? Have you been exposed to English as a child? This will all influence your ability to learn and master the English language.\n\nOur 7-week English Immersion Program is a great way to improve your English language skills in a relatively short period. By taking the Language Pledge (and committing to speaking, reading, and writing only in English for the duration of the program), our students make impressive improvements in just two months."
