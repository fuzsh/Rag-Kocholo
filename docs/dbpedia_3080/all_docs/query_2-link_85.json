        "text": "Origins and meaning of “la dolce vita”\n\n“La dolce vita” was originally a movie by Federico Fellini and Ennio Flaiano.\n\nThe movie starred Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg as journalist Marcello and actress Sylvia and depicted life in Rome during the ’50s through 14 different episodes.\n\nBy that time, Rome had recovered from WWII and the middle classes were benefitting from Italy’s economic boom.\n\nThe lives of the aristocracy and the new bourgeoise were characterized by luxury and mundane events, which took place in Rome’s most iconic places.\n\nThe constant pursuit of pleasure and happiness had its dark sides, dramas, and decadence… but also beauty and poetry, and Fellini immortalized that in what is now one of the greatest movies in history.\n\nLife in Rome looked so picturesque and pleasant. So, now la dolce vita is an expression used to describe a life full of beauty, pleasures, and mundane events. It means a life of music, love, good music, and food…\n\n… in short, the things you’d expect to have on a Saturday night near the Fontana di Trevi.\n\nWhat’s your idea of a sweet life?\n\n“La dolce vita” shaped the idea that many people had of Italy. It also influenced many aspects of both the Italian and American cultures.\n\nFor instance, did you know that this movie is where the word paparazzi originates from?\n\nFinally, this masterpiece inspired many other directors, like Quentin Tarantino and Sofia Coppola.\n\nHowever, if you go to Rome today, you’ll find out that it’s quite different from the one described by Fellini.\n\nThe city has changed, and if you go there looking to live the dolce vita, you’ll find just mere hints of it, echoing in restaurant names and postcards.\n\nStill, it doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy it.\n\nRome is fascinating, and if you go there (possibly knowing some Italian :)) You’ll find that you can still live your own sweet life. What will it be like?"
