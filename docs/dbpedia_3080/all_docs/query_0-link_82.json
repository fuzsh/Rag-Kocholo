        "text": "English grammar can be tricky, and one area that many students find particularly difficult is prepositions. A preposition links nouns, pronouns, and phrases to other words in a sentence.\n\nI’m sorry, I know they are hard to get your head around and I wish I could make them go away, but I can’t. So, my next best offer is to try and help you get comfortable with using them. Let’s do a quick review of when to use three of the most common ones: in, on, and at.\n\nUse: When talking about time, we use ‘in’ when referring to an unspecific time of the day, a month, a season or a year.\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n“I always brush my teeth in the morning.”\n\n“My birthday is in June.”\n\n“It’s always cold in winter.”\n\n“My brother was born in 1999.”\n\nUse 2: When talking about places, ‘in’ is used to indicate a location or place. Here are a few examples:\n\n“I used to live in Florida.”\n\n“The city of Bangkok is in Thailand.”\n\n“I am in my room.”\n\nImprove your English grammar, vocabulary and more with EF English Live.

Something is on the surface of something else.\n\nFor example:\n\n“The papers are on the coffee table.”\n\n“I left the keys on the counter.”"
