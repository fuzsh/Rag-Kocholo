        "text": "'It' and 'they' are both personal pronouns in English. Their most obvious difference is that 'it' is a singular pronoun, while 'they' is plural.\n\n'They' is a subject pronoun used to refer to two or more people or things that have already been mentioned or are already known. We can use 'they' to refer to:\n\nWhen referring to singular objects that are grammatically plural, such as pants, glasses, or trousers, the pronoun 'they' must be used instead of 'it'. Pay attention to the examples:\n\nAlthough using 'it' to refer to these nouns is considered grammatically incorrect, it might sometimes be used in everyday speech.\n\nDue to a recent revolutionary awareness about gender, modern English has adapted to the use of 'they' as a singular pronoun when referring to an individual without specifying their gender. This avoids the use of gendered pronouns such as 'he/she' or 's(he)' or 'he or she'. Take a look at the examples:\n\n'It' is both a subject pronoun and an object pronoun. We can use 'it' to refer to:\n\nKeep in mind that unlike 'they', 'it' cannot be used to refer to people. One exception to this rule is when talking about a fetus whose gender is not known yet.\n\nWhen referring to a single object or thing, 'it' is used instead of 'they'. For example:\n\n'It' can be used as both the subject and object of a sentence when the real subject or object is introduced earlier or later in the context. Pay attention to the examples:\n\n'It' can also be used as a dummy subject of a sentence when you are talking about weather, time, distance, etc. For example:\n\nIf you want to refer to collective nouns like companies, teams, parties, etc. either 'it' or 'they' can be used. Although these entities are made up of multiple people, using 'it' is also grammatically correct if we want to refer to the entity as a single unit. Compare the examples:"
