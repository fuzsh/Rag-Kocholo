        "text": "Positive Role Models\n\na lot\n\nDavid Holmes' positive approach and outlook on life is evident both before and after his accident. He talks passionately about his job as a stuntman and how it was the only thing he ever wanted to do. He is selfless and generous, often showing more concern for others rather than himself. He shows great courage and perseverance in facing his situation but never tries to deny it's happening to him, describing his paralysis as \"the gift that keeps on taking.\" Holmes' friends, including Daniel Radcliffe, show great care and compassion toward him. They speak lovingly of their friend and talk about his generosity and sense of adventure. The group's friendship is very inspiring with the bond between them clear for all to see.\n\nParents need to know that David Holmes: The Boy Who Lived is an inspiring documentary about a young stuntman whose life changed forever following an accident on the set of a Harry Potter film. David Holmes was Daniel Radcliffe's stunt double (and close friend) and the Potter star plays a prominent role in the film as he hangs out with Holmes and his fellow stunt mates. Holmes' love for life is obvious both before and after his accident, which has left him severely paralyzed and an electric wheelchair user. Holmes' accident is discussed at length, as are his injuries. He is shown with a serious scar on his neck, having physio (which causes him pain), and needing the help of his friends to get from one place to another. The relationship between the group of male friends is full of compassion and support, with Holmes being the instigator for this positivity. He talks passionately about his career and remains grateful for the experiences he's had and for those that are to come. The film is careful not to evoke sympathy for Holmes -- he doesn't come across as any kind of victim -- but the film is an emotional watch. There is strong language throughout, including variants of \"f--k,\" reference to someone dying from COVID-19, and some smoking (including by Radcliffe).
