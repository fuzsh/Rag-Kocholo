And it basically means that we need both grammar and vocabulary to communicate.\n\nBut words carry more meaning than grammar. So having a wide vocabulary is really what will allow you to express yourself more effectively.\n\nYou may already know that some words are simple (e.g. animals, sad, food) while others are more advanced (fauna, heartbroken, sustenance).\n\nIn the next 5 minutes, you’ll not only find out why it’s important to learn more sophisticated words, but you’ll also discover 60 advanced English vocabulary words with examples.\n\nLet’s begin.\n\nWhy Is It Helpful To Learn Advanced English Vocabulary?\n\nImagine you received some great news and you tell one of your friends about it.
