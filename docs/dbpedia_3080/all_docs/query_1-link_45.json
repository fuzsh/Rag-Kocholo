        "text": "Quietly, J.A. Bayona‘s Society of the Snow has become a contender in this year’s Oscar race. The Netflix drama made the Oscars shortlist in four categories: best international feature (for Spain), makeup and hairstyling, original score and visual effects. Since its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival last year, the true-life tale of the Uruguayan 1972 Andes flight disaster has been gaining critical momentum.\n\nFor Bayona, who has become accustomed to big-budget Hollywood productions like Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and The Rings of Power (he directed the first two episodes of the Amazon mega-series), Society of the Snow marks something of a return to his roots. It is his first Spanish-language movie since his 2007 debut The Orphanage and, arguably, his most ambitious since the Oscar-nominated The Impossible in 2012, another real-life story of survival, starring Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor and a very young Tom Holland.\n\nIt was around the time the director began making The Impossible that Bayona became obsessed with the events of Flight 572. The story of the Uruguayan rugby team who crashed while crossing the Andes mountains, en route to a match in Chile, has been told many times before, in books, documentaries and in two feature films: The 1976 Mexploitation movie Survive! and Frank Marshall’s 1993 English-language drama Alive starring Ethan Hawke. It also served as the loose inspiration for Showtime’s Yellowjackets.\n\nBut it was Pablo Vierci’s Society of the Snow, a non-fiction account of the disaster, published in 2008 and made with the full collaboration of the survivors and their families, that caught Bayona’s interest. The other versions of the Flight 571 story, he felt, were “simplistic.” Only Vierci’s book, written “against the idea that people had in their minds [about Flight 571]” captured “the spiritual, philosophical layer” of the real story.\n\nBayona acquired the rights to Society of the Snow shortly after finishing The Impossible. It would take more than a decade to get his version to the screen, thanks largely to Netflix, which agreed to the director’s demand that this epic film, with a reported budget of close to $70 million, be shot entirely in Spanish with mainly unknown South American actors.\n\nWith Society of the Snow dropping on Netflix worldwide on Jan. 4, Bayona talked to THR about recreating the Andes in Spain, telling a snow-based story and other challenges he faced in working on the project.\n\nWatching the film I was reminded of your 2012 Oscar-nominated drama The Impossible, another incredible real-life story of survival. Do you see a connection between that movie and this story? Is there something that links the themes of the two movies in your mind?\n\nYes, there is. There’s a direct connection because I read [Pablo Vierci’s book] Society of the Snow while researching for The Impossible, already in pre-production. At that time, The Impossible didn’t have a title and actually, the title comes from Pablo’s book, from a paragraph where he repeats the word “impossible” seven times. So it was a huge influence on The Impossible because what I think is great about Pablo’s book is that he gives you the inner life of the characters. It’s not only about the fact of physical survival but also in terms of emotional survival, in terms of the human side of the story.\n\nI remember reading pages of the book to Naomi Watts and Tom Holland and giving the book to the heads of department of The Impossible. So for me it’s very difficult to separate The Impossible and Society of the Snow because Pablo’s book was a huge help for me in figuring out what The Impossible was about.\n\nWhat connects the two stories, the two films, for you?\n\nThis similar idea of survival — not just the physical but also the emotional aspect. This idea of understanding that there is something else, some bigger good that we are somehow a part of and the celebration of that. I remember a scene from The Impossible where Naomi Watts hears a baby crying. She’s with her son, Lucas (Holland), in the middle of this devastation and she wants to rescue that kid. Lucas sees his mother is badly injured and wants to take her to the hospital. But she says: ‘I’m gonna save that kid even if it’s the last thing I do.’ This idea of giving yourself to others is in Society of the Snow. One of the books I read while I was preparing Society of the Snow was Man’s Search for Meaning from Viktor Frankl, which is about how everything can be taken from you, except your will. He’s referring to the genocide, to his own experiences in the concentration camps, but it’s the same idea, this idea of dignity, of humanity, that cannot be taken from you.\n\nWhy did it take so long to make this film, given you bought the rights to the book right after making The Impossible, more than a decade ago?\n\nBecause we wanted, needed, to shoot it in Spanish and we are in an industry that can’t seem to absorb a big budget production in Spanish. We’d been trying to finance through conventional channels, in the independent market. But there was no way. Probably the ceiling for a big-budget movie in Spanish these days is around $10 million. A movie like this one would be impossible to make on that budget. So we were knocking on doors for 10 years before. When we were about to give up, we went to Netflix and Netflix offered us the money that we needed. As well as total freedom and the promise the film would be released in cinemas. So, of course, we couldn’t say no.\n\nWhy was it important to do the film in Spanish? The Impossible is also the story of a Spanish family but you changed that to English for your movie.\n\nI wanted to both films in the most realistic way possible. In the case of The Impossible, the family was a Spanish family living in Japan on holidays in Thailand. So the context was not based on nationality. And actually, María Belón, the real person who the story is based on, said yes to the film but with one condition: That the family not be given a clear nationality. That’s what she wanted. If you notice, in the movie, you never hear where the family’s is from.\n\nBut with Society of the Snow, the national context, of this group, this team from Uruguay, is essential to the story. It’s very important to understand the context, the social, political and cultural context of where they are coming from. So I thought it would be a mistake to shoot in a different language.\n\nDid you want to avoid the mistakes of the previous films made about the 1972 Andes flight disaster? [Survive! in 1976 and Alive in 1993]?\n\nThe first one was shot in Spanish but with Mexican actors with Mexican accents, which feels very weird. It’s an exploitation movie from René Cardona, Jr. and was made right after the events on a very low budget. It’s an exploitation film. I think Frank Marshall’s version is a movie that had a real impact on our generation. It was good for the time, and since it was produced by Touchstone it was shot in English. Maybe it was too soon for the families of the victims to be open about going to see a film about the disaster so the producers weren’t able to reach an agreement with them. But even though all those problems, I think they did a good job and created a film that had a real impact on our generation. I’ve got a great deal of respect for Alive.\n\nBut I think that one of the reasons why the survivors decided to sit down again, and help [Pablo Vierci] write another book 35 years after the plane crash was because they didn’t recognize themselves in how the disaster was shown and talked about, not just with the film, but with all the books, all the documentaries. The story was about the rugby team, that crashed in the Andes and ate each other. It became all about this idea of cannibalism. The heroism of the survivors was lost, it felt simplistic. So that’s why they sat down again and decided to write another book, a book written against the idea that people had in their minds.\n\nI see my film as the product of that philosophy. I got this idea from the survivors to try and take the story forward from talking about the death in the story to talking about the lives of the people involved. Our idea was to start the film by going back before the crash, to figure our what happened and who these people were who crashed in the mountains, trying to touch the philosophical aspect of the book. And we landed on the idea of telling the story through the eyes of one of the victims, touching this sort of spiritual layer that Pablo Vierci has.\n\nI spoke to your lead, Enzo Vogrincic, in Venice and he described the lengths you went in shooting this film. It sounds truly harrowing. You seem to have gone full Werner Herzog on this movie, really immersing your actors in the experience, even burying them in snow up to their eyeballs. Why this extremely realistic approach?\n\nWe wanted to stay as close as possible to the reality in order to portray the story in the most authentic way possible. So I wanted the actors to go through the same weight loss, to have their hair grow like the characters, to have the sense of loneliness because they were shooting so far away from home — most of them were from Argentina and Uruguay and we mostly shot in Spain. For me, it was about capturing moments of truth in front of the camera. The more I work with actors, the more I enjoy creating situations where you can capture unexpected gestures or moments of real truth on set.\n\nThere’s one scene at the very end of the film when they go to the hospital. [Crash survivor] Roy Harley told me when they were taken to the hospital, he remembers his father being by his side all of the time. Even when he took a shower, his father was waiting outside with the towel. I thought that was a beautiful image, the thing with the father and the towel. But instead of just shooting that, I shot the whole scene, with the actor taking the whole shower, and then the father embraces him with the towel, cuts his nails and gets him dressed. At the end of this very long take, I see the hand of the actor is shaking. And I asked the cameraman pan down very slowly and finish the shot on his hand shaking. For the actor [Andy Pruss] it was after a long journey, after 100 days of shooting and being so close to Roy Hurley the real person. That shaking hand was a gesture that spoke of the reality of the situation. The moment was unexpected, but it was a result of all the work I did with the actor. For me those are the most rewarding moments, when you get those images that surprise you but tell your story in the most powerful and meaningful, most profound way.\n\nIt seems a lot to ask of your actors, getting them to agree to this sort of boot camp where they are starving and freezing in the cold, occasionally being buried in the snow.\n\nOf course and for an experience like this you have to go hand in hand with your actors. Trust is the most important thing when I work with an actor, I really want the actors to trust me and I really want to trust my actors. I always tell them: It’s okay if you do it wrong. We are here to commit mistakes. This is not a play. If you do something that I don’t like, we will do another take but I prefer you to take risks and try what you feel is right. In that sense, this film was a performance from the very first to the very last day. They they were given all the information from their characters and the characters around them. We did two months of rehearsals, I put them in contact with the survivors, and then we provided them with the context to go through the same emotions. But everything we did was with the trust and with the blessing of the actors.\n\nI’m so proud of what they did, and the way they portrayed their characters with such responsibility and with such commitment. You normally don’t commit your entire body to a performance at this level.\n\nOf course, we have people around them at all times taking care of them. They had a group of coaches. They had a group of nutritionists supervising their health. Every week they had an examination so everything was under control and done with the blessing of the actors. And the actors really went for it. It was beautiful to see how committed they were to their performance.\n\nEnzo Vogrincic was incredibly enthusiastic about the whole experience, even with the avalanche scene. Although I have to say the idea of being almost buried alive for hours seems pretty horrific to me.\n\nYes but at the end of the shoot, at the end of the day, they still could go back to the hotel and take a hot shower. That was something that was in their minds the whole time. That, yes, this is hard but we’re going to go back to our hotel after and have a hot shower. The survivors never did that, they stayed on the mountain. So all the time they were reflecting on that, on their position and that of the people they were portraying.\n\nHow did you recreate the Andes in Spain?\n\nWe wanted to shoot in the snow in real locations. And the only way to shoot in real locations in the snow is in a ski resort because you need a place where the where the crew can set up. So we shot in Sierra Nevada in the south of Spain. At 2,400 meters. I don’t know how much is that in feet [around 8,000 feet]. Most of the shoot was there. The plane was there at that height. Once we finished there we went to the actual location of the plane crash and shot very specific shots there. Not scenes because it was impossible to bring the cast there. It was too dangerous. But we did some specific shots. We went in for 20 days or so, in the Andes and we shot every single corner of the mountain. We needed images of everything. I think the guys from visual effects did an extraordinary job in replacing all the backgrounds we shot in Sierra Nevada with those Andes images.\n\nThe location in Sierra Nevada, in the mountains, was very similar to the Andes but 10 times smaller. So we had to basically replace all the backgrounds with our actors in them, more than 1,000 shots. We had to be very careful because, since it’s a true story, the tone is very important. The moment you see the post-production you no longer believe the reality of the film. If you’re doing a movie like Jurassic World, where there’s a science fiction element, you can rely on stronger, more obvious CGI. We did use a lot of CGI in this film but it was very specifically to make things look real, as they should. We mix a lot of techniques, combining in camera with visual and special effects. When I showed the film to the survivors, they were in shock because they said they felt like they were back on the mountain, back at the same place where it all happened.\n\nWhat was the biggest challenge of shooting on locations, in the snow in the mountains as you did?\n\nI think it was the light because we were shooting in a different atmosphere. We were in the northern hemisphere and the story is set in the southern hemisphere so the light works the other way around. It’s exactly the opposite. That was good in a way because normally when you shoot a sunrise, you shoot it in the evening because it’s easier to prepare with the light, which was exactly what we did in Sierra Nevada and it worked perfectly. But working with light on snow is not easy. It looks easy but it’s very tricky with those enormous amounts of white to erase the footprint of your crew, your lights, etc. But the more we were working on it, the more we were learning how to do it. We had a long period of post-production because we started doing post, right after we started to shoot. So we were able to correct and learn as we were doing it.\n\nSo with The Impossible you did water and here you did snow. Which is harder to work with?\n\nIt’s a different kind of challenge. Working with water makes the shoot slower. Moving a lot of people around in water is always very tricky. But the big challenge with this film was that we shot on a real location so we were dependent on the weather and we had to adapt all the time to conditions to keep shooting. We needed a cover set, a soundstage, to shoot in when the weather demanded it. We wanted to stay at altitude but we were in a ski resort so we had to bring a whole industrial warehouse in from Belgium and rebuild it on the parking lot in Sierra Nevada.\n\nBut there were also very strong winds up there so there were days when we couldn’t shoot in our soundstage either and we had to go to a third place, at sea level, a huge set that looked like it was in the middle of the mountains but was down at the level of the sea, the plane in the center of it and around the set all these palm trees. It was pretty funny. The visual effects guys had a big job replacing the background on those shots.\n\nBut down there the challenge was it was super hot. It’s the south of Span, really, really hot. So the actors had to perform with all these clothes on, acting like they were freezing. I hated shooting there and the actors hated it too, wearing all these layers of clothes with 35 [95 F] degree temperature. It was insane. They were happy to go back to the cold.\n\nHas the experience of making the film this way, with a proper budget from Netflix, in the language and way you wanted to make it, changed how you want to work in the future?\n\nWhat I think is that, very slowly, throughout all the films I’ve done, I’ve become more comfortable in being less rigid with the plan I take to set. I’ve discovered I’m enjoying more and more being open to the unexpected, giving actors freedom to try and get more realistic performances. Working in a different way. That, to me, is more important than how big the budget is. It’s about how you approach the story. For this story, I can say honestly I couldn’t have given more than I did. I spent a long time really trying to profoundly understand Uruguayan culture in the 1970s. I became very close to the survivors, interviewing them for hours, establishing a personal relationship with them, and trying to understand who they were, and what were the specifics of each character. On set, I allowed the actors to bring their best to the characters, to give them space to try things. It was a less rigid structure. It felt more comfortable and the results have been more rewarding.\n\nWhat hasn’t changed is that I always give myself a lot of time. My films are always very long shoots. I shot The Impossible in 120 days, The Orphanage was like 116. This was 138. Very, very long shoots. But that’s the way I like to work, to have that space, to have that time to work with the actors. That’s where I feel comfortable. And that’s where I think I can give my best. I’d like it if I could keep working that way."
