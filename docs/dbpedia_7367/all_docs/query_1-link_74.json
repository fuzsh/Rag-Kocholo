        "text": "After taking a year off from writing, I missed this space. But I’m back with new ideas and posts to share, and I want to start with my favorite books of 2022. I set a goal to read 75 books this year, and I reached that goal with a few days to spare.\n\nKeep reading to see which titles I loved the most.\n\nMy Top 10 Reads of 2022\n\nThe Butterfly House by Katrine Engberg\n\nThe Butterfly House is the second book of a Danish crime series following two detectives, Jeppe Kørner and Annette Werner, as they solve murders in Copenhagen. In this volume, they’re trying to find a serial killer who uses antique medical tools on their victims before leaving them in public fountains. Clues lead the detectives to a hospital and former psychiatric facility where questions arise about how patients were treated.\n\nThe characters here are well-developed, the writing is engaging, and the setting is exactly what you’d want from a dark crime novel. If you’re a fan of the Dublin Murder Squad series by Tana French, don’t miss this book.\n\nDinosaurs by Lydia Millet\n\nDinosaurs was a wonderful surprise. I had never read Lydia Millet before, and I wasn’t even sure what Dinosaurs was about, but I picked it up anyway. I’m glad I did since it became my favorite book of 2022.\n\nThe story follows a man named Gil who starts a new life by walking from New York to Arizona after a breakup. Independently wealthy, Gil seeks volunteer opportunities to help bring meaning to his life. He becomes close with the family next door and embraces his new role as a friend and mentor to the couple’s young son.\n\nIf you need a lot of plot in your fiction, this isn’t the book for you. But if you want a beautifully told story full of love and hope, don’t miss this gem.\n\nHappy-Go-Lucky by David Sedaris\n\nDavid Sedaris is one of my go-to authors, one whose work I know I’ll always enjoy. Happy-Go-Lucky might be my new favorite collection from him. Many essays address his time in New York during the Covid-19 pandemic and his complicated relationship with his dying father. In true Sedaris fashion, he brings humor to bleak situations. We could all use some of that after the last few years.\n\nIf I Survive You by Jonathan Escoffery\n\nA debut of interconnected short stories, If I Survive You follows a Jamaican immigrant family after they settle in Miami. The protagonist is Trelawny, the family’s younger son, who can’t quite live up to the eldest. He believes he’s meant to be a scholar, but life unfolds differently than he expects. Though this book addresses topics such as racism, classism, and immigration, there’s plenty of humor and lightness to be found. I love this book and can’t wait to see what’s next for Jonathan Escoffery.\n\nKlara and the Sun by Kazuo Ishiguro\n\nThe Klara of this book’s title is an AF, an Artificial Friend for a sickly 14-year-old girl named Josie. Josie saw AFs in a store’s window display and immediately felt a bond with Klara, who comes home with Josie and her mother. As Klara grows to know Josie, she comes up with a plan to end her sickness. Klara and the Sun is wise and tender with important things to say about science, friendship, and what happens when those two things are combined.\n\nNow Is Not the Time to Panic by Kevin Wilson\n\nIn 1996, teenage Frankie met Zeke and finally found a friend, someone who saw her and encouraged her creativity. The two designed a unique poster and hung it all over town. The cryptic, dark artwork took on a life of its own, scaring the townspeople, who were sure something deadly was coming their way. When a reporter calls thirtysomething Frankie and wants to do a story about the Coalfield Panic, Frankie has to face her past and the choices she made with Zeke. Now Is Not the Time to Panic is a perfectly nostalgic novel about two misfits and the power of art.\n\nThis Here Flesh: Spirituality, Liberation, and the Stories That Make Us\n\nby Cole Arthur Riley\n\nI first became aware of Cole Arthur Riley through her excellent Instagram account, @BlackLiturgies. I knew I’d love her book, and I do, but it surprised me how slowly I wanted to read it. I’m usually a fast reader, but the essays in This Here Flesh deserve to be savored. I took my time, underlining sentence after sentence. In prose that often reads like poetry, Arthur Riley explores faith, family, Christianity, and the stories that shaped her. This Here Flesh is a gorgeous book.\n\nTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin\n\nTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow follows 30 years in the lives of Sam and Sadie, two childhood friends who decide to create a video game together and ultimately become business partners. I expected this book to be lighter than it is, but its depth was a pleasant surprise. Sam and Sadie are well-developed yet flawed characters I rooted for and got frustrated with in equal measure. They love each other, but this book isn’t a love story. They play and make games together, but this book isn’t about gaming. Instead, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow is a thoughtful, sprawling story about how friendship can sometimes save us.\n\nWhen Stars Are Scattered by Victoria Jamieson and Omar Mohamed\n\nWhen searching for possible book club selections for the student and staff multicultural book club I co-lead, I picked up When Stars Are Scattered. I started flipping through it and was immediately absorbed by the true story of Omar and Hassan, two brothers growing up in a Kenyan refugee camp after fleeing war-torn Somalia. Hassan has special needs, so Omar becomes his caretaker, a situation that becomes more complicated when Omar has the chance to attend school.\n\nI don’t read graphic novels very often, and I read middle-grade books even less, so I’m thankful to have stumbled upon this wonderful title. Kids and adults will both appreciate this one.\n\nYou Don’t Have to Be Everything: Poems for Girls Becoming Themselves\n\nedited by Diana Whitney\n\nAnthologies rarely, if ever, appear on my favorites list, but this poetry collection is special. Editor Diana Whitney chose poems from a diverse array of poets, including Amanda Gorman, Kate Baer, Andrea Gibson, Elizabeth Acevedo, and many more. The poems would be enough, but the book is also full of beautiful, brightly-colored illustrations. I read this book on a day when I felt down and discouraged, and it was just what I needed. Consider reading this next time you need some comfort and inspiration.\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nHere’s a list of other books I enjoy and recommend in the order I read them:\n\nAnd We Rise: The Civil Rights Movement in Poems by Erica Martin\n\nMouth to Mouth by Antoine Wilson\n\nGiovanni’s Room by James Baldwin\n\nMessy Roots: A Graphic Memoir of a Wuhanese-American by Laura Gao\n\nThe Angel of Rome and Other Stories by Jess Walter\n\nConfidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America by Maggie Haberman\n\nThe Appeal by Janice Hallett\n\nThe West Wing and Beyond: What I Saw Inside the Presidency by Pete Souza\n\nThe Stats\n\nIn Conclusion\n\n2022 was a great year for books, and there are already many 2023 titles I’m excited to read. I’d love to hear what books you loved this year. What books were your 2022 favorites?\n\nPhoto by Alireza Attari on Unsplash\n\nOne of my favorite things to do is make lists. I like to make lists of anything and everything. I especially enjoy lists that include additional lists. Welcome to this blog post, which features ten bookish categories and six recommendations per group. This post was a delight to write and reminded me of many of my favorite reads. I hope this is as fun for you to read as it was for me to put together. Enjoy the superlatives!\n\nMost Likely to Make You Cry\n\nA Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara\n\nMoving to New York to pursue creative ambitions, four former classmates share decades marked by love, loss, addiction and haunting elements from a brutal childhood.\n\nI rarely cry when I read, but I sobbed like a baby when I finished this book. Yanagihara’s real, deeply sympathetic characters earned my compassion and empathy. I felt like I was in a daze for a while after finishing A Little Life. I’m thankful for books like this that leave a mark.\n\nFor more tear-jerkers, try:\n\nThe Great Believers by Rebecca Makkai\n\nOn Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong\n\nThe Nickel Boys by Colson Whitehead\n\nTell the Wolves I’m Home by Carol Rifka Brunt\n\nThe Goldfinch by Donna Tartt\n\nMost Likely to Change Your Mind\n\nHow to Be an Antiracist by Ibram X. Kendi\n\nFrom the National Book Award–winning author comes a bracingly original approach to understanding and uprooting racism and inequality in our society—and in ourselves. Ibram X. Kendi’s concept of antiracism reenergizes and reshapes the conversation about racial justice in America—but even more fundamentally, points us toward liberating new ways of thinking about ourselves and each other.\n\nWhen I started seeing the word “antiracist,” I assumed it referred to someone who wasn’t racist. After reading How to Be an Antiracist, I realized antiracism is much more than a position or belief system. Antiracism is about our actions and decisions determining our way of being. There’s a reason this book has appeared on many recent book lists featuring Black voices.\n\nFor more blow-your-mind books, try:\n\nWhite Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide by Carol Anderson\n\nThe Fire Next Time by James Baldwin\n\nThe Fire This Time: A New Generation Speaks About Race edited by Jesmyn Ward\n\nI’m Still Here: Black Dignity in a World Made for Whiteness by Austin Channing Brown\n\nThis Will Be My Undoing: Living at the Intersection of Black, Female, and Feminist in (White) America by Morgan Jerkins\n\nMost Likely to Make You Laugh\n\nSouthern Lady Code by Helen Ellis\n\nA riotous collection of essays on the art of living as a “Southern Lady” that explores subjects ranging from marriage and manners to women’s health and entertaining.\n\nHelen Ellis is from Alabama but moves to New York City with her husband. The essays in this collection discuss how she assimilates to NYC while keeping her Southern roots. The mark of a good humor book is that it makes me laugh out loud, and this one did that repeatedly.\n\nFor more funny books, try:\n\nCalypso by David Sedaris\n\nPriestdaddy by Patricia Lockwood\n\nHere For It: Or, How to Save Your Soul in America by R. Eric Thomas\n\nOne Day We’ll All Be Dead and None of This Will Matter by Scaachi Koul\n\nI Feel Bad About My Neck: And Other Thoughts on Being a Woman by Nora Ephron\n\nMost Likely to Open Your Eyes\n\nRandom Family: Love, Drugs, Trouble, and Coming of Age in the Bronx by Adrian Nicole LeBlanc\n\nFollows two teenagers coming of age in the midst of the Bronx drug trade as they experience budding sexuality, teen parenthood, and gang identity in a social examination of the challenges of family life in the face of violence.\n\nThis book opened my eyes to many things, but the most impactful thing was finally realizing how poverty is the root of so much trauma and pain. This book is a difficult one to read, but I’m thankful I read it. I think about the characters a lot and often wonder what their lives look like today. (This book was published in 2004.)\n\nFor more eye-opening books, try:\n\nDopesick: Dealers, Doctors, and the Drug Company that Addicted America by Beth Macy\n\nChasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs by Johann Hari\n\nGhettoside: A True Story of Murder in America by Jill Leovy\n\nNothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea by Barbara Demick\n\nMissoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town by Jon Krakauer\n\nMost Likely to Inspire You\n\nBecoming by Michelle Obama\n\nAn intimate memoir by the former First Lady chronicles the experiences that have shaped her remarkable life, from her childhood on the South Side of Chicago through her setbacks and achievements in the White House.\n\nBecoming is one of those rare books that I want to hand to every high school student I work with at my schools. Obama’s passion for education and her drive to succeed should make this book required reading for any student.\n\nFor more inspiring memoirs and biographies, try:\n\nEducated by Tara Westoever\n\nI Am Malala: The Story of the Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban by Malala Yousafzai\n\nNotorious RBG: The Life and Times of Ruth Bader Ginsburg by Irin Carmon\n\nFirst Women: The Grace and Power of America’s Modern First Ladies by Kate Andersen Brower\n\nSurprised by Oxford by Carolyn Weber\n\nMost Likely to Keep You Reading\n\nAll Night Long\n\nThe Guest List by Lucy Foley\n\nAn expertly planned celebrity wedding between a rising television star and an ambitious magazine publisher is thrown into turmoil by petty jealousies, a college drinking game, the bride’s ruined dress and an untimely murder.\n\nFor this category, I looked for books I read in just a day or two. This thriller is the most recent addition to that list. I love many things about The Guest List, including the twists, but the star of the show is the setting: an abandoned island that’s rumored to be haunted.\n\nFor more unputdownable books, try:\n\nBluebird, Bluebird by Attica Locke\n\nThe Family Upstairs by Lisa Jewell\n\nThe Dry by Jane Harper\n\nThe Lies We Told by Camilla Way\n\nThe Perfect Nanny by Leila Slimani\n\nMost Likely to Keep Your Book Club Talking for Hours\n\nHomegoing by Yaa Gyasi\n\nAdd this to the list of the books that I want to hand out to everyone. No other books have opened my eyes to the horrors of slavery the way this book did. Though slavery is a thread running through the stories in this novel, Homegoing is full of love and hope. There is so much to talk about thanks to the book’s long list of characters.\n\nFor more book-club-friendly books, try:\n\nRodham by Curtis Sittenfeld\n\nQueenie by Candice Carty-Williams\n\nSuch a Fun Age by Kiley Reid\n\nMy Year of Rest and Relaxation by Ottessa Moshfegh\n\nThe Mothers by Brit Bennett\n\nMost Likely to Encourage You\n\nMiracles and Other Reasonable Things: A Story of Unlearning and Relearning God by Sarah Bessey\n\nThe author tells her story of recovering from a traffic accident and how this experience changed everything she believed about God.\n\nSometimes I need a pep talk, and this book provided one. It’s also one of the most beautifully written and compelling stories I’ve read in a long time.\n\nFor more encouraging books, try:\n\nBraving the Wilderness: The Quest for True Belonging and the Courage to Stand Alone by Brené Brown\n\nReasons to Stay Alive by Matt Haig\n\nStitches: A Handbook on Meaning, Hope, and Repair by Anne Lamott\n\nTiny Beautiful Things: Advice on Love and Life from Dear Sugar by Cheryl Strayed\n\nThe Inner Voice of Love by Henri Nouwen\n\nMost Likely to Surprise You\n\nBehind Her Eyes by Sarah Pinborough\n\nThe secretary of a successful psychiatrist is drawn into the seemingly picture-perfect life of her boss and his wife before discovering a complex web of controlling behaviors and secrets that gradually reveal profound and dangerous flaws in the couple’s relationship.\n\nI can’t think of another ending that surprised me as much as the one in Behind Her Eyes. While this book isn’t my favorite thriller, it is the one that kept me frantically turning pages until the last twist. Sometimes–like when there’s a global pandemic happening–that’s all I want.\n\nFor more surprising books, try:\n\nGone Girl by Gillian Flynn\n\nLock Every Door by Riley Sager\n\nThe Hunting Party by Lucy Foley\n\nWe Were Liars by E. Lockhart\n\nThe Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides\n\nMost Likely to Make You Feel\n\nWarm and Fuzzy Inside\n\nWe Met in December by Rosie Curtis\n\nAn American, Jess, follows her dream and moves to London where she becomes enmeshed in a love triangle with Alex and Emma all who live as housemates in a grand, Notting Hill house share.\n\nWarm and fuzzy stories are what I read the least, but sometimes I need a palette cleanser for the more substantial stories I gravitate toward in my reading life. We Met in December is a lovely book with a feel-good story. It was the perfect Christmas break book and one I can see myself revisiting when I want a sweet tale.\n\nFor more warm and fuzzy books, try:\n\nOne Day in December by Josie Silver\n\nHow to Find Love in a Bookshop by Veronica Henry\n\nSomeday, Someday, Maybe by Lauren Graham\n\nLandline by Rainbow Rowell\n\nGlaciers by Alexis M. Smith\n\nPhoto by Corey Agopian on Unsplash\n\nDespite the stress and mental exhaustion from living during a global pandemic, July went by quickly. I’m not sure how that happened, but I’m more than okay with it. I celebrated my birthday, my mother’s birthday, and my grandmother’s 96th birthday. I also watched Hamilton (along with everyone else, I think), and it blew me away and basically turned me into a new peron. More on that later.\n\nBecause of the aforementioned stress and mental exhaustion, I preferred television and music to books throughout July, though I did finish four titles (and am in the middle of reading this one). But before I talk about that stuff, let’s talk about the books!\n\nWhat I Read\n\nBring Me Back by B. A. Paris\n\nFinn and Layla are driving home from vacation when they stop at a service station. Finn gets out of the car to use the restroom, and when he returns, Layla has vanished for good. Ten years later, Finn has moved on and has fallen in love with Layla’s sister, Ellen. They’re engaged, and once they made that news public, things from Layla’s past started showing up, including clues that Layla herself might be alive and closer than they think.\n\n(MILD SPOILERS AHEAD!)\n\nThough there’s a lack of character development, Bring Me Back is gripping and held my attention, and that’s where my compliments end. The ridiculously unbelievable ending ruined this entire book for me and made me wish I hadn’t read it. I can’t remember another conclusion that I hated as much as I hated this one. I wanted to throw this book across the room, go pick it up, set it on fire, and then bury its ashes in the backyard. Since it was a library book, I opted to return it instead. If you’ve read this, what did you think of the ending?\n\nDear Martin by Nic Stone\n\nJustyce is a Black teen with a bright future ahead. He attends an elite school and is bound for an Ivy League college. When Justyce goes to help an ex-girlfriend who’s intoxicated, the police approach and assume Justyce is trying to steal her car. He’s handcuffed for hours. This incident brings to the surface issues like police brutality, racism, and belonging that Justcye tries to process by writing letters to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nDear Martin is a slim YA book that I read in one day. Nic Stone has so much to offer her readers in its pages. Justyce is a compelling, profoundly sympathetic lead character whose questions are more timely now than ever. This novel is one I would hand to any teen who likes realistic fiction, and I think it would be especially great for reluctant readers.\n\nHome Before Dark by Riley Sager\n\nMaggie is the daughter of Ewan Holt, the author of the bestselling book House of Horrors in which he tells what he claims is the true story of the few days his family spent living in Baneberry Hall. Ewan’s book recounts the strange and spooky events that led his family to leave the house behind in the middle of the night, without possessions or looking back. Maggie feels as if this book has defined her life, and she hates it.\n\nWhen Ewan dies, Maggie realizes he never sold Baneberry Hall. She has a business in which she restores old homes, so Maggie heads to the property to fix it up and maybe even get some answers for what she knows are her father’s lies. When strange things start happening, Maggie wonders if House of Horrors contains more truth than she thought.\n\nRiley Sager is one of my favorite contemporary writers. His thrillers are consistently addictive, and Home Before Dark is no different. The novel is a book within a book; chapters alternate between Maggie’s point of view and passages from House of Horrors. I almost had to put this book in the freezer, so I think this novel creeps closer to horror than any of Sager’s previous work (except for maybe Final Girls). If you’re a Sager fan or just need a good thriller to keep you occupied, don’t miss this one.\n\nThe Dilemma by B. A. Paris\n\nEven though I was still angry at B. A. Paris for Bring Her Back, I couldn’t say no to this title when OverDrive told me my library hold was available. One of the reasons I couldn’t say no was because my Kindle was right next to me, and I didn’t want to get up to grab anything else. Anyway.\n\nThe Dilemma revolves around Livia and Adam, a happily married couple with two adult children. Livia is about to turn 40, and she’s throwing herself the lavish birthday party she’s been dreaming of and planning since her 20s. There’s a secret Livia knows about, though, that’s weighing on her. And on the day of her party, Adam is carrying a secret of his own that might change everything.\n\nI knew nothing about this book going in, and that was for the best. The Dilemma is more of a family drama than a thriller like Paris’s other books, yet I still found myself getting nervous and holding my breath in certain parts. If you need a good escapist read, I think this novel will be just the thing. I couldn’t put it down and have forgiven B. A. Paris.\n\nWhat I Loved\n\nMOVIE/THEATER: Hamilton\n\nI’ve wanted to see Hamilton as long as I’ve known about it. When I found out it would be streaming on Disney+, I heard choruses of angels singing as glee filled my heart. Despite that, I tried to keep my expectations reasonable. I thought there was no chance that Hamilton could live up to the hype. I’m thrilled to say I was wrong. These words will probably sound hyperbolic, but watching Hamilton was one of the most profound and moving experiences I’ve ever had with a piece of art. I was in awe from the first second to the final gasp.\n\nMUSIC: Folklore, Taylor Swift\n\nGod bless Taylor Swift for making the album I didn’t know I needed. I’ve listened to Folklore on repeat since its surprise release and find it incredibly soothing, fascinating, and lovely. My heart has a soft spot for 1989, but I think Folklore might be Swift’s best work yet.\n\nMOVIE: Palm Springs (Streaming on Hulu)\n\nPalm Springs is a surprisingly sweet and funny romcom starring Andy Samberg (Nyles) and Cristin Milioti (Sarah). Nyles, a guest at a wedding, finds himself in a time loop in which he experiences the wedding day over and over again. He’s drawn to Sarah, the maid of honor, and wonders what forever might look like with her. I enjoyed this film immensely.\n\nMOVIE: Troop Zero (Streaming on Amazon Prime)\n\nTroop Zero is such a sweet little gem of a movie. McKenna Grace plays a girl who’s lost her mother and is obsessed with outer space. When she hears about an opportunity for Birdie Scouts to record their voice on NASA’s Golden Record, nothing will stop her from taking her shot (Hamilton reference for the win!). The film also stars Viola Davis, Allison Janney, and Jim Gaffigan. Its cast and earnestness make Troop Zero a delight.\n\nTELEVISION: The Baby-Sitters Club (Streaming on Netflix)\n\nI was unprepared for how much I was going to love this show. I was obsessed with The Baby-Sitters Club as a kid and would read any of the books I could get my hands on. (I still have my collection because I can’t bear to part with it.) I knew the characters as well as I knew myself. Thankfully, this new show keeps all the characteristics of my beloved babysitters yet modernizes them and the books’ plots for today’s audience. I’m eagerly awaiting season two.\n\nThat’s it for me. What did you read and love in July?\n\nPhoto by Pineapple Supply Co. on Unsplash\n\nI’m finally on summer vacation from work. So far, my days have included a lot of sleeping, lounging, reading, TV-watching, and general laziness. I cannot recommend these things enough.\n\nI’m excited to share what I read in June, but I’ve decided to switch up these monthly recaps a bit. In addition to the books I read, I also want to include things I loved throughout the month, whether it’s a podcast or a recipe. I’d love for you to share your favorite things too in the comments below.\n\nLet’s get going.\n\nWhat I Read\n\nThe Ruin by Dervla McTiernan\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nWhen Irish detective Cormac Reilly first started his career twenty years ago, he was called to a house in the middle of nowhere in which he found a woman who had overdosed on heroin. She left behind two kids, Maude and Jack. When The Ruin opens, Jack has just committed suicide, but his sister and girlfriend don’t believe that’s true. With the past resurfacing, Reilly is told to re-open the investigation of Jack’s mother’s death, which also might not be what it seems.\n\nI enjoyed this dark and twisty crime story. Reilly is an engaging, well-developed character who never forgot Maude and Jack and what they went through. The blurb on the cover of this book says it’s perfect for fans of Tana French, and I agree. I’m looking forward to reading the next book in this series.\n\nThe Night Before by Wendy Walker\n\nRating: 2/5\n\nLaura was devastated by an awful breakup, which led her to leave her life in New York City to move in with Rosie, her sister, and brother-in-law. Laura decides to give online dating a try, but when she doesn’t come home from a date, Rosie knows something is wrong and sets out to find her. Due to an incident in Laura’s past, Rosie doesn’t know whether Laura might be a victim or a perpetrator.\n\nThough this book is entertaining, it lacks depth and nuance. I like thrillers that have well-rounded characters and believable twists, and I don’t think The Night Before has either.\n\nThe Woman in Cabin 10 by Ruth Ware\n\nRating: 3/5\n\nLo is a travel journalist who finally has a good assignment: she gets to spend a week on a new luxury cruise that offers beautiful scenery, pampering, and fine dining. One night in her cabin, Lo hears what sounds like a scream and a body thrown over the side of the ship. She looks outside and sees blood on a partition next to her room. When she reports what happened, the head of security doubts her story. All the guests are present, the blood has been cleaned up, and Lo has a few reasons why she might not be the most reliable witness.\n\nThe Woman in Cabin 10 is a fun read that’s perfect for summer. The novel has solid pacing and just enough creepiness to keep things interesting.\n\nDopesick: Dealers, Doctors, and the Drug Company that Addicted America by Beth Macy\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nThough I read three thrillers in June, this nonfiction book was the most gripping page-turner I read all month. Beth Macy’s account of America’s opioid epidemic is utterly fascinating. She weaves together threads of poverty, addiction, politics, and a corrupt pharmaceutical company and presents a story as compelling as it is heartbreaking. If you’re looking for a better understanding of opioid addiction, this book is a must-read.\n\nMy Year of Rest and Relaxation by Ottessa Moshfegh\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nThis novel’s protagonist has a life many young women envy. She’s a young, thin, beautiful blonde who is living in NYC, thanks to her inheritance. She works at an art gallery and has an older man who’s interested in her. She’s unsatisfied and unmotivated, though, and begins seeing a psychiatrist who gives her exactly what she wants: the ability to numb everything she doesn’t want to feel and the chance to just sleep for a year.\n\nMy Year of Rest and Relaxation is worth all the hype it’s received. This novel is an absolute delight and one I wish I would have read sooner. (If you like this book, check out The New Me by Halle Butler. It has a similar theme and tone.)\n\nWhat I Loved\n\nPODCAST: To Live and Die in L.A.\n\nJournalist Neil Strauss hosts this show which investigates the disappearance of Adea Shabani, a beautiful 25-year-old aspiring actress who came to Hollywood to chase her dreams. This true-crime podcast is the first I’ve ever binge-listened. (Is that a thing? I think it’s a thing.)\n\nMOVIE: Yesterday\n\nJack has been trying to get his music career off the ground for over ten years with no luck. As he’s heading home one night after a gig, the entire world loses power for twelve seconds, and something strange happens: certain things that were once beloved no longer exist. Jack remembers the Beatles, but no one else does. He knows this is his chance to make it big, so he passes off their music as his own and quickly becomes the most famous musician in the world.\n\nI liked this film even more than I thought I would, even though the plotline has a few holes. I’ve loved the Beatles ever since I was a little kid, and this movie reminded me of why.\n\nGADGET: Chef’n VeggiChop Hand-Powered Food Chopper\n\nI LOVE THIS LITTLE CHOPPER SO MUCH. I’m not a good or fast chopper, so I use this a lot. Even though it’s not motorized, it’s fast and powerful. It can handle crunchy carrots just as well as it handles hardboiled eggs. This is one of my most used kitchen tools.\n\nWorthwhile Links\n\nARTICLE: The Ultimate Summer Books Preview of 2019 @ LitHub\n\nINSTAGRAM ACCOUNT: @things.i.bought.and.liked\n\nARTICLE: When the World’s Most Famous Mystery Writer Vanished @ The New York Times\n\nRECIPE: Philly Cheesesteak Sloppy Joes @ Dinner Then Dessert\n\nVIDEO: Under a Rock with Tig Notaro feat.

She wanted a life with less stuff but didn’t want the stereotypical home of a minimalist with white walls, gray furniture, and few possessions. The answer to Smith’s problem is cozy minimalism which allows for a warm, welcoming home made up of well-curated and thoughtful belongings.\n\nWHAT WAS GOOD ABOUT THIS BOOK?\n\nSmith’s approach makes a lot of sense to someone like me who’s intrigued by minimalism, but concerned about losing character and uniqueness at home. I appreciate how Smith shows before and after images from her own house, letting readers see what cozy minimalism actually looks like.\n\nWHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK?\n\nAnyone who feels burdened by their stuff, but still appreciates a cute throw pillow will like this one.\n\nSimple Matters: Living with Less and Ending Up with More\n\nby Erin Boyle\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nWHAT’S THIS BOOK ABOUT?\n\nBoyle tells readers about her own journey toward a simple life and encourages them in their efforts to declutter, spend wiser, and create a home with beauty and sustainability.\n\nWHAT WAS GOOD ABOUT THIS BOOK?\n\nThis book is a pleasure to read. There’s a lot of white space on each page which lets the beautiful images of Boyle’s home really stand out. I also like that Boyle addresses making better environmental choices while making purchases. That’s something I don’t think about often enough.\n\nWHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK?\n\nFans of Boyle’s blog, Reading My Tea Leaves, will love this one. People looking for inspiration about embracing a more mindful life and minimal home will appreciate this too.\n\nNine Perfect Strangers by Liane Moriarty\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nWHAT’S THIS BOOK ABOUT?\n\nNine people embark on a visit to a health resort called Tranquillum House. Some are there to lose weight, others to help heal their marriage, and some to deal with grief. Though the story is told through the eyes of all nine main characters, the primary character is Frances, a romance writer whose career seems dead.\n\nAt first, Frances embraces the healthy smoothies and midnight activities, but things start to get weird quickly, thanks to the resort’s mysterious leader. Soon, all nine guests are brought together in a way they never expected.\n\nWHAT WAS GOOD ABOUT THIS BOOK?\n\nThe thing that makes me enjoy Liane Moriarty’s books so much is her characterization. There are few things I like more in fiction than a well-rounded character. Characters don’t have to be likable, relatable, or sympathetic, but I do want them to seem real.\n\nFrances’s disappointment and frustration seem real. Napoleon, Heather, and Zoe’s grieving seem real. Ben and Jessica’s marriage struggles seem real. A lot is happening in this story, but Moriarty always makes it about her characters and their growth.\n\nWHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK?\n\nMoriarty’s fans will probably like this one, though I can see it being more divisive than her previous work. Readers who enjoy a well-paced story with dynamic characters will enjoy their trip to Tranquillum House too.\n\nTHE LIES WE TOLD BY CAMILLA WAY\n\nRATING: 4/5\n\nWHAT’S THIS BOOK ABOUT?\n\nClara is living a happy life with her boyfriend Luke. One night Luke doesn’t come home, and Clara starts to worry. She has a feeling something’s wrong, so she contacts Luke’s best friend Mac and Luke’s parents to help her find him.\n\nAs the search for Luke continues, secrets from the past are finally revealed, and the repercussions of those secrets will haunt Luke and his family forever.\n\nWHAT WAS GOOD ABOUT THIS BOOK?\n\nThis book is everything I want a thriller to be. It’s fast-paced, has surprises all throughout, and goes much darker than I expected, which I loved. I’d heard nothing but praise about this book before I picked it up, and I can say that it’s deserving.\n\nWHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK?\n\nThriller and mystery fans will be fully engrossed in this story.\n\nOne Day in December by Josie Silver\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nWHAT’S THIS BOOK ABOUT?\n\nLaurie is riding the bus and looks out the window. She locks eyes with a man sitting on a bench outside. She feels an instant connection and he does too. The man, Jack, gets up and starts walking toward the bus but it drives away.\n\nAfter a year spent thinking about and longing for this man she met but not really, Laurie’s best friend Sarah introduces her new boyfriend who just so happens to be Jack.\n\nOne Day in December follows Laurie, Jack, and Sarah over several years of their lives as they intersect in interesting ways.\n\nWHAT WAS GOOD ABOUT THIS BOOK?\n\nThis book easily could have been a cheesy, predictable story about a love triangle, but it’s not. For one thing, Josie Silver is funny, and I love finding funny fiction writing. Another thing I liked about this book is that the characters are flawed, but they see this in themselves and are working to become better people. I never ever read romance, so I was surprised by how much I loved this book.\n\nWHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK?\n\nRomance readers will enjoy this one, but I think non-romance readers might too. If you want a lighthearted, sweet, and seasonal read, One Day in December is a great option.\n\nPriestdaddy by Patricia Lockwood\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nWHAT’S THIS BOOK ABOUT?\n\nPriestdaddy is a memoir about Patricia Lockwood’s life with a zany Catholic priest for a father. She and her husband are forced to move back home with her parents for a while, so she explores her family as an adult and reflects on her childhood and her relationship toward Catholicism.\n\nWHAT WAS GOOD ABOUT THIS BOOK?\n\nLockwood made me laugh out loud, which rarely happens when I’m reading. She’s a poet, so her writing is lovely whether she’s talking about something funny or serious.\n\nWHO SHOULD READ THIS BOOK?\n\nPeople who are interested in religion and don’t mind poking fun at it’s weirder aspects will probably enjoy this most. And if you’re like me and are continually searching for well-written and funny books, make sure to give this a chance.\n\nHave you read any of these books?
