        "text": "Don’t see your class here? Send news to your class correspondent or submit directly to Class Notes Editor via email: Classnotes.editor@unh.edu, or by mail: UNH Magazine, 9 Edgewood Road, Durham, NH 03824.\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\nFollow\n\n1949\n\nIn the UNH Summer 2022 alumni magazine I told a true story about Don Lamson ’48 and hoped to entice you to send me a tale of a UNH escapade or, if you are an UNH oldster (80 and up), a funny or clever memory from the past. I only heard from two UNHers, but I was delighted to hear from them; and I’ll keep trying, by including one of my own true stories, while I was a co-ed at UNH. My sophomore year I was living in Congreve South. My boyfriend at that time devised a way of keeping in touch after hours. First, he would toss some pebbles at my second-floor window, which faced a dirt hill in back of my dorm. Then I would drop down a pint-size glass milk bottle, tied on a rope. He would put a note in the bottle, and I would pull it up, read it, laugh (always, it was funny) and send a funny answer back. Then, he’d climb up the steep hill, and we’d make gestures and faces at each other. (Co-eds had to sign-in at their dorms or sorority houses by 9 p.m. on weekdays in the ’40s and ’50s.) Kurt Danis ’87 thanked me for the story about Don and his first skis, and he said the story reminded him of something he did while riding his motorcycle to UNH in the cold New Hampshire weather. “Gloves weren’t very warm; and I couldn’t find any really warm mittens in the department stores.” So Kurt, being a typical N.H.-Yankee-do-it-yourselfer, must have thought: “Since I can’t find very warm mittens, I’ll make a pair myself.” And being 6 feet 3 inches tall, he needed some big mittens. He rode his motorcycle to Manchester and bought some Shearling sheep skin and some black suede leather in the Tandy Leather store. “At home in Goffstown I used my Mom’s sewing machine. Now, it still worked when I got finished; but to be honest, the clutch was a little worn out. I had to manually turn the wheel on the machine to get the needle to push through some difficult parts. Leather is not uniformly thick. And, yes, my mother was just a little upset!” But I’m sure Kurt loved those mittens on New Hampshire’s long, cold winter days. Kurt and his wife, Christine, live in Colorado Springs. ‘Betty’ Ahern Lamphier ’50 wrote: “Joan, I just read your ’49er class notes and loved your story of Don and his first skis. He was great! It made me remember lots of Outing Club fun at UNH. And that reminded me of some funny stories. Backpacks, which were made of tan canvas were heavy with a sleeping bag, warm clothes and snacks inside. They had to be carried up a steep hill to the Outing Club’s Jackson log cabin. On one extra steep part, my backpack pulled me over backwards. I had to have help to get up, which took quite a while, because of all the laughter!” Five of Betty’s six children migrated to Park City, Utah, to live and ski there, after Betty had taught them to ski in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. “It was a great sport for me, too,” continued Betty, “until I reluctantly hung up my skis three years ago. Now I enjoy living near the ocean and kayaking in rivers. I was so glad to see the UNH Magazine again.” Betty lives in Marshfield, Massachusetts. Spiro Anastos died peacefully at Portsmouth’s Edgewood Centre on September 29, 2022. He had celebrated his 95th birthday in July. His hometown was Newport where his parents instilled him with strong faith and a tremendous work ethic. Spiro put himself through college, majoring in business administration at UNH, and he later received a master of education degree from Northeastern University. Spiro started his career as a teacher, then school principal and then school business administrator, assistant superintendent and human resource director in Concord. Upon retirement he was encouraged to work for a couple of weeks at Concord’s busy Cat’n Fiddle Restaurant, as the bookkeeper. Ironically, that two weeks turned into 19 years. Spiro was happily married for 50 years to Elaine (Tagis), who died in 2008. Nine years ago Spiro moved to Portsmouth to live closer to his and Elaine’s (like a daughter) niece and her husband. He is also survived by several loving nieces, nephews, grandnieces, and grandnephews, to whom he was “Uncle Pip.” I have just found out why there was no 1948 Class Letter in the UNH Summer Magazine. Betty Ann MacAskill Burnett Shea, the class correspondent, and dear friend of mine in our college days, died on March 1, 2021, at her residence in Exeter. Betty had four children. She was a joyful, happy mother, grandmother and friend to so many. I feel lucky to have known such a lovely friend.\n\n1952\n\nVicki Burns ’74, daughter of Marilyn Follansbee from the class of 1952 writes that Marilyn had a great 90th birthday in June 2021, but had a stroke two months later, and is still working on regaining her speech. She is living at Langdon Place of Dover and enjoys reading emails at hmf2@comcast.net. She participated in the UNH summer program for speech PT students. Well wishes for a good recovery, Marilyn. Marilyn C. Waris Pike, also known as Pinky, has passed away, we heard from her son Dana Pike of Utah. “She majored in occupational therapy, and I often heard her say, ‘Not a day goes by when I don’t use something I learned in my OT program!’” says Dana. “Two weeks after her graduation, she married my father, Ronald M. Pike ’49. He passed away in 2019.” Condolences, Dana.\n\n1953\n\nFollowing Hurricane Ian’s deadly rampage, I tried to contact Florida classmates to find out how they fared. Said Ed Keohane’s wife, Marie: “Ed and I lost our home to Ian. Thankfully we are in Hampton to attend our grandson’s wedding. All our material possessions are gone with the wind/water. But we are fortunate to be here.” In Tampa, Barbara Pritchard Joyce reported “It just missed us. We were blessed.” Cleo Bisbas Neary at Delray Beach says, “the east side of Florida, where I live, was basically untouched, but the west side was badly hit … it’ll be a long time before we are able to visit over there.” At his California independent living facility, George Lyon teaches a creative writing course, hosts a happy hour, is on the welcoming committee, and said he will fit into his uniform on Veteran’s Day. After you’ve read this, how about dropping me a line with your news. What keeps you busy? Have you news from any classmates? I’ve received the death notices of Nancy Meyers Fischer, an arts major, of Hartsdale, New York, who died on Jan. 9, 2021, and Bernard “Barney” Robinson, a math major, of Largo, Florida, on Sept. 15, 2021. Stephen Thayer, a poultry husbandry major and AGR member, died May 3, 2022. He went on to earn a master’s, also in poultry science, and was a biologist for Sterling Winthrop Research Institute for 30 years, retiring when the institute closed. He served in the Army from 1954-56 as first lieutenant. Owner and operator of Central Texas Air Conditioning for many years, Richard Roberts died April 21, 2021. He was a chemical engineering major and a member of Phi Mu Delta. He’d served in the Korean War as a second lieutenant. William Koutrelakos, a zoology major, was a Navy corpsman for two years after graduation and later earned a master’s in elementary education, teaching in Baltimore schools, then becoming principal of three schools until retirement in 1993. He was also active in the Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Baltimore. He died June 23, 2022. Wells, Maine, resident Joanne Nelson Rhines, who met her husband, the late William Rhines ’51 at UNH, died March 11, 2022. Joanne was an accomplished pianist, quilter, Sunday School teacher and substitute church organist. She dedicated much time to St. David’s Episcopal Church in Wells. Major Cortez “Bill” Willey of Dover died July 12, 2022. After graduating with a degree in botany and forestry, he spent 20 years as a USAF supply services officer, receiving the Bronze Star for service in Vietnam. Eventually returning to Dover, he worked at Clarostat Manufacturing Co. and Cumberland Farms, but the work he enjoyed most was at McCrone’s Christmas Tree Farm. Nancy Low Baldvins, well-known in the Keene area as reference librarian at the Keene Public Library, died June 25, 2022. She earned a degree in English. Generous, she never turned down a request for baked goods for a cause. An English lit major and member of Chi O, Barbara LLoyd Greer passed away Sept. 11, 2022, in Exeter. An avid bridge player, she became an American Contract Bridge League Golden Life Master, and she and husband Wade hosted weekly bridge games at the South Lynnfield, (MA) Fire Station for many years. Betty Ford, who retired to Cape Neddick, Maine, after a nursing career, first earned a degree in zoology, then a master’s in nursing from Yale, and worked at the Boston University and University of Bridgeport schools of nursing. She died Aug. 30, 2022. Barbara Hamilton Tiger, a long-time resident of Hyde Park, New York, died Jan. 14, 2021. Dr. Stanley Z. Berry, who earned an MS from UNH and a PhD from University of California-Davis, died July 21, 2022. He taught and did research in horticulture and plant pathology at the University of California and later at Ohio State, eventually retiring from the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center in Wooster.\n\n1955\n\nThere will be little news for our class from fall. I live in Punta Gorda, Florida, and for most of you this was where Hurricane Ian came ashore just a week ago, as of this writing. We were very lucky in that our condo stood up to the challenge. A little water in the living room, power out, loss of internet and no AC. First time I experienced a storm with 150-mph winds but glad it is over. Many friends have lost everything, so we were extremely lucky. Our beloved Norris Browne passed away on Sept 24, 2022, in Connecticut, with his family at his side. He will be missed by many. As active as he was in all sports, and very generous to the UNH athletic system. We will miss him walking up and down the side lines. Tom Tracy, Len Willey, and Billy Pappas were able to get UNH to honor him at a following home game in Durham. Chris Winslow writes that he was glad to see our last newsletter in UNH Magazine (nee The Alumnus) and to get caught up on everyone. Hopes to meet with Marshall Litchfield later this month. Chris reports he lost his wife Mary Thomas in 2006. Chris still goes to Palm City, Florida, for a few winter months. Chan reported that Bill Johnston continues to be active playing a few rounds of golf each week. He hopes to visit Naples this winter for a little time with his family. Chan Sanborn met up with Bill and Loni Pappas for the opening football game with Monmouth State. Ann and Chan Sanborn were both honored at the game for their 10 years of work on the Sports Gallery in the field house and for their general support of the university. Ken Keith is doing well in Colorado. The legs are not the best but both he and wife Meriden are still enjoying life. Bill Geoffrion and wife Gibby are now living permanently in Venice, Florida, and just missed the eye of Hurricane Ian. Bob Langlois is retired in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey and enjoys all the blueberries and raspberries (they note they’re in the high-bush blueberry capital of the world). He and Marcia have five grandsons, four great-grandsons and one great-granddaughter. Sounds like a great family. Walter Read is retired in Bedford, and now has a granddaughter attending UNH. We certainly could use some news from you all, even if it is just a line or two. Let me know for our next issue: What’s the one thing in your life that you will never forget since graduation? Until then be safe, enjoy and keep that UNH smile.\n\nMichael Gordon ’57, Nancy Glowacki ’57, Carly ’57 and Jim Hellen ’57 celebrating Homecoming together!\n\n1957\n\nHELLO to news in the nearly now! Our special CLASS REUNION of 1957, was both live and partially on Zoom! We did it! The Lobster Dinner kicked off Thursday p.m.! Friday a.m. we welcomed folks on the ZOOM screen — Fritz Armstrong (Pres), Gwen Marsh Caldwell, Joan Picard Deselles, Sandra Willand Pelton (VP) Dale Fletcher Simmons — and those who were live in the room — Me (Secretary), Sylvia Roberts O’Reilly, Jim Hellen (Treasurer), Carly Hellen, Michael Gordon, Jim Yakovakis, Paul Aliopoulos, and guests Lee Perkins ’55 (husband of Ann Garside Perkins) and Deb Karmozyn ’87G, guest of Michael Gordon. Gratitude galore to UNH staff members Corena Garnas, Phebe Moore ’13 and Jacey Darrah, the guide/tech team that created the perfect casual sharing environment! We had a lively meet-and-greet, several fun toasts, a “high class” UNH golf shirt appreciation gift for Fritz’s 60+ years as a loyal presidential run, a short class meeting of updates/reports, an inspiring visit with UNH President James Dean, a “Remembering of Then and Now,” a video review of photos from the 50s, a rousing chorus of the Alma Mater, and then a class march in the upper walking track of the gym before the class lunch! You were all in our thoughts and words wishing you were there. We tried to have our reunion recorded so we could send you all a link, but alas, it did not happen. But do note that our class of 618 still has 297 classmates on the planet! So you see, there’s a lot of living yet to do and reason to stay in touch. All the campus activities were fun and added a renewing energy to our souls that weekend! EXTRA CLASSMATE NEWS! Mary Emanuel Swain, Williamsburg, Virginia, is enjoying lots of club work as a parliamentarian these days. After UNH, her husband Don Swain ’56 (SAE) was in the Air Force and Mary (Chi Omega), flew for TWA. She says, “We both miss UNH!” Bill Zimmerman and wife Ruth live in a CCRC in Keene, their hometown, so the “circle is closed.” Bill plays solo cocktail piano gigs now “because all my jazz band guys have died.” Climbing hills in hunting season is getting tougher too. On the bright side, happy summer and holidays at their home in York, Maine still prevail with the family. As for me here in Wolfeboro, I am creating a diverse action palette of playing keyboard in a country/folk/gospel jam weekly, volunteering at three different exciting community projects, joining newcomers, and mentoring assisted living friends in my CCRC. Great to be “home” again in New Hampshire! Farewells to classmates are always a poignant, personal part of this column. The obituaries are heartfelt, amazing stories of lives well-lived. A specific copy can be obtained by calling/texting me at (828) 606-5201. We now say farewell to 11 lives filled with a staggering variety of skills, interests and commitments, each one unique, gifted and engaged in full living. Charles N. Blossom Jr. 86, of Concord, April 11, 2022; Paul Wesley Stevens, 88, of Long Island, Maine, May 17, 2021; Paul D. Whitney, 98, of China, Maine, July 12, 2021; John Phillip Reid, 91, of Exeter, April 26, 2022; Wallace Smith, 91, of Laconia, May 14, 2022; Elizabeth Lunt Knowles, 86, of Topsham, Maine, May 27, 2022; George T. Karras, 96, of Gaithersburg, Maryland, June 21, 2022; Caroline S. Jones, 87, of Portsmouth, Aug. 22, 2022; Charles Russell Shillaber, 92, of Strafford, Aug. 24, 2022; Dr. Leo B. Sanfacon, 91, of Gilford, Sept. 3, 2022; Arthur Pomerleau, 88, of Portsmouth, Sept. 8, 2022. A few of us ’57ers went to Homecoming activities in October and were inspired by the outdoor update presentation on the Sustainability Institute, a high quality UNH commitment with outcomes that place UNH among the top five universities in this effort! We soaked up the sunny fall campus, picnic, live music and meeting and greeting others! Among the myriad of activities to attend was a well-done play of “Anne of Green Gables!” AND, UNH had a 21-12 win on Saturday crowning a great weekend! A little daily wisdom: “Yesterday is history, tomorrow’s a mystery, today is a gift … that’s why it’s called the present,” from Eleanor Roosevelt. Live it! And please be thinking about memories, happenings, ideas, comments and hello’s you can share with our classmates…and send them in to me for our next issue!\n\n1958\n\nIt is with sadness that I report the passing of our class president, William (Bill) Nelson. He was a commissioned officer in the U.S. Army and served in Korea. After his active service he served in the Army Reserve, retiring as a lieutenant colonel in 1986. Bill will probably be best known for his very active participation in planning multiple UNH class reunions and promoting the Class Scholarship Fund which has been renamed as the “Class of ’58 William T. and Lee M. Nelson Scholarship Fund for Excellence.” Ossie McLeod writes that he and Kathy took a cruise to Norway in June and will return to their second home in Hawaii for the winter. Bobbie Juster and Mary Ann Chase both report that they were part of the “chosen few” when Hurricane Ian impacted Naples, Florida — damage was limited to greenery in both their condo complexes. Mary Ann and husband David also mentioned that the remodeling of their house on Durham Point is going agonizingly slow primarily because of material shortage. Janet Parsons has been active researching the history of the land and families that have lived on the land that is now Covenant Living of Keene. After retiring from the Monadnock School District she joined the Cheshire County Historical Society and became involved in an archaeological dig, in charge of the paperwork and accounting. She said it was almost as bad as some science labs. Janet continues working on old census records and people’s family records. Marlen Mapes is living in Carolina Shores, North Carolina, and still enjoys an active life as do Polly and Jack McDonough. In July, my husband, Don, and I traveled to Athens, Greece, to attend a space science conference. My position as associate editor of the organization’s journal ‘Advances in Space Research’ did not leave much time to explore the city. I was a co-author on a scientific paper that Don presented at this conference. Going down memory lane, June Gong sent a picture taken shortly after graduation when she visited the Astrophysical Observatory Satellite Tracking Station on the summit of Haleakala Crater on Maui. To show what a small world we live in, the picture included Dr. Walter Steiger who, while not a UNH alumni, had lived in Warner, and, a few years later, was my boss when I worked at the University of Hawaii Manoa. This reminds me of the time many years ago, when I met and immediately recognized Mary (Todt) and Frank Johnson on a hotel elevator in Paris. In future columns I would appreciate interesting stories of chance encounters or memories of UNH staff and events. We have lost several classmates. Herbert Adams (Hanover, Maine) taught history and coached the ski team in Rumford. Beverly Bartlett (Ha’iku, Maui, Hawaii) was a social worker specializing in foster care placements. She was active in the Mauna Ala Hiking Club and was known for her love of animals. Roderick Boivin (Somersworth) had a career in banking and was active in several community and church organizations. John (Jack) Boland, Jr. (Nashua) rose to chief financial officer of the former Edgcomb Steel of New England and later continued working as CFO at Law Motor Freight and Law Warehouses. Arthur Paul Boucher (Dover) became plant manager at Kidder Press and Moore Business Forms. He served as a trustee and chairman/president for several local organizations. Thomas Fonda (State College, Pennsylvania) spent most of his career as a guidance counselor for the State College Area School District and was very active with the Boy Scouts. Gerard Pepin (Fairfax, Virginia) had an active career in the USAF receiving master’s degrees in electrical engineering from the Air Force Institute of Technology and in business management from the University of Nebraska. He pursued a PhD in artificial intelligence at Purdue University. After retiring from the Air Force, he worked in the telecommunications industry and consulted at George Mason University. Donald Philbrick (Milford) was employed by the Federal Highway Administration serving in later years as the Vermont Division Bridge Engineer. Susan Keene Proctor (Conway) taught home economics, was a guidance counselor at Kennett High School and enjoyed traveling. Lorraine Smith (Contoocook) worked for HMC Corp., Wick Building, New Hampshire National Guard and retired from the state as a purchasing agent. She loved to cook and was an expert at needlework and crochet. Eleanor Thompson (Cincinnati, Ohio) was a buyer for Korvettes Department Store, a job that allowed her to travel around the world. She later received a degree in physical therapy from Columbia and was an avid skier. I have more details on the lives of our classmates which I am willing to share, if you’d like to contact me.\n\n1959\n\nUNH Magazine regrets to share that Diane Woods, class secretary for many years for the class of 1959, passed away on Dec. 25, 2022. We are so thankful for her work on the magazine, and send our condolences to her friends and family. If you’d be interested in carrying on Diane’s legacy of collecting notes and writing a column twice a year for the magazine, please contact Corena Garnas in Alumni Relations at corena.garnas@unh.edu, or by phone at (603) 862-4875.\n\n1960\n\nHaving been in a transitional period since the start of COVID, it was wonderful receiving a hard copy of our alumni magazine in the fall. As a reminder to classmates, copies of previous issues not printed as hard copy can be found online at https://magazine.unh.edu. My husband and I returned to New Hampshire for a weekend in early October to attend a celebration of life for a dear friend. We were amazed at the stunning foliage. Family and friends from as far north as Bar Harbor, Maine, to here in southern New Jersey were impressed with the beautiful colors of fall 2022. At the recommendation of our new alumni news editor, Corena Garnas, we are asked to share a memory of our time at UNH to include comments on what was a favorite class, a favorite professor, who was the first friend you made on campus or anything else you would like to mention about a nostalgic memory. As for me, from that first day eating at Commons, now called Huddleston Hall, I remember meeting so many new classmates. It was a joy to go there and be entertained by songs of the time emitting from a jukebox. Unbeknownst to many of you, about 13 or so freshmen girls in the fall of 1956 (including me) were housed in rooms on the third floor at Commons. In any event, before the semester was over, all of us had been placed in various dorms on campus as some students decided to return home. Now I wonder if any of you have anything to share. Doug Blampied and his wife, Nancy, of Sugar Hill hosted Sam Paul last summer for some fine dining and to play golf. The Blampied home in Venice, Florida, made it through Hurricane Ian with damage to the lanai, to some trees and some bushes. Doug says he keeps in touch with Ted Sobozenski and Peter Davis. From the Hamptons on Long Island, John Hussey wrote that relocating from Pennsylvania was the right thing to do. Along with his family and two dogs, he states that they are spoiled living only five minutes from the beach. It was good to hear from Sal Perra who mentions that he sees Art Monty and his wife Pam along with Lou ’61 and Pat D’Allesandro ’61. He enjoys recounting old stories and events with them. On a recent trip through Durham, he noticed the many new buildings along with old ones and commented on some students zipping around on electric scooters. And from Fort Myers Hurricane Central, I quote Warren Wilder, “Got to have been here to believe it. The Press told an accurate tale.” He was supposed to go to his granddaughter’s wedding in Kittery, Maine, on October 5. So soon after the hurricane of September 28, I’m hoping that he was able to attend the wedding. In mid-October, I received a call from Class President Sam Paul of Granby, Connecticut, telling me that his wife Sally Anthony Paul, also a 1960 classmate and friend to many, passed away peacefully after a long battle with Alzheimer’s. Sally majored in History, served as a sophomore sphinx along with Sam, and was a member of Alpha Chi Omega sorority. Other deceased members of the class include Daniel C. Britt, who passed away in May 2022 in Portsmouth. He earned both his bachelor’s and master’s from UNH. Dan was a long-time science teacher but made a career change to art education in his 50’s. In June 2022 John Wyllie died in North Andover, Massachusetts, after a period declining health. He retired from his company Glenwood Associates in 2002. Roger F. Berry passed away in August 2022 in North Conway after a period declining health as well. After having served in the Navy, he attended UNH graduating with a bachelor of science in civil engineering. He returned to the Navy as an officer in the Sea-bees. He then worked for the state of New Hampshire and finally became a consulting engineer.\n\n1961\n\nLou and Pat Morgenstern D’Allesandro wish to greet fellow classmates and advise that Lou’s book, “The Lion of the New Hampshire Senate,” by Mark C. Bodanza (North Hill Press) is still available via Amazon.com or at your local bookstore. Lou is running for election to his 13th term in the New Hampshire State Senate and has recently completed his role as national chairman of the Council of State Governments. He and Pat recently happily celebrated their 61st anniversary. Lou also wished to advise of the passing of his brother, Paul D’Allesandro ’62, in August 2021. Harvey Galloway advises he and wife Linda spent a very pleasant fall sojourn on the Maine coast in Ogunquit where they met up with classmate Dennis Shinn and his wife Sherry Boyd Shinn ’62. Food was good, weather could have been better, a bit overcast and cloudy. Bob Lavoie and his wife D.J. moved to San Diego 11 years ago to be closer to their daughter Amy. The climate there allows them to walk two miles every day in nearby park trails mostly in the Scripps Ranch residential area where they live. They regularly attend symphony concerts and local playhouses. “We have enjoyed our annual trips to New England in the fall, most recently to visit my sisters and brother in Nashua and friends in New London. We also had a wonderful stay for a week at a Damariscotta, Maine, cottage.” Lois Stickney Magenau and Alpha Chi Omega sisters Melissa Foy Stofko, Penny Hallward Gage and an honorary one Judy Holbrook Thompson had a grand reunion at Penny’s home in Yarmouth, Maine — lobsters and all! Also several AXO’s do a twice-monthly Zoom call created by Penny. Those who participate are Penny, Lois, Judy, Brenda Ferguson Kanarian, Nancy Parry Blampied, Sally Orcutt Page, Ann Miller Patch and Lynne Wrightnour Lefelar. If anyone would like to join, let Lois know; her email address is mailto:rmagenau@aol.com. Art Monty and his wife, Pam, planned to return to their home in southern France in mid-winter, having been in Gilmanton since last spring. They made two visits to Canada to visit family and discovered a lovely lake where they spent a week kayaking and swimming and now look forward to returning to Antibes, France, with a planned side trip to Croatia. Bob Shea writes from Virginia, “If you see a white car with Virginia plates UNH 61, that’s me.” Bill Tighe says he enjoyed meeting and reminiscing with classmates at the 61st reunion, as he has done at our 45th, 50th and 55th. Fifteen of our classmates joined together in Durham, early June 2022 to celebrate our 61st reunion along with others from the classes of 1960 and 1962. Carol Pandini Trombly writes “Life is good here at the Taylor Community. It’s independent living with no worries about upkeep and maintenance. We enjoy educational programs as well as a variety of musical programs, even line dancing! Who knew being this old could be such fun! I experienced my first river cruise this past summer on the Rhone River in the province region of France. It was a beautiful experience with wine tasting and walking the cobblestone streets of charming villages but the 100-degree bright sunshine weather nearly did me in!”\n\nTop to bottom: Chuck Glenn ’63, Bob Towse ’63, Jim Twombly ’63 and UNH Athletic Director Allison Rich, on the field at the Elon game in recognition of the 1962 undefeated football team. Carroll Winch ’63 and Cheryl Dickson ’63 are holding up six fingers to mark the six decades since graduation the class of 1963 will be celebrating at its 60th reunion in June.\n\n1963\n\nThank you so much for sending me some news for the UNH magazine. Reminder: 60th Reunion, June 2-4, 2023. Reach out to fellow classmates and let’s bring together a HUGE turnout to party, reminisce and attend many activities over reunion weekend. Registration will open mid-March. Make plans to attend and make sure your friends do too! Find info and updates at: www.unh.edu/reunions. Judy Holbrook Hurlbut said the Alpha Chi Omega gals have stayed connected twice a year with Zoom. Judy pedals mostly on trails, and chairs community wide solstice ceremonies. Ginny Gross Chase paints professionally. Carol Beth Orsi Gwozdz reports that after retiring from teaching school and real estate, she spent 10 years as a docent at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Betsy Hammond Minehan is on the board of a historical society. Pam Edsall Stewart is active with the National Audubon Society. Sandy Unterman Hoeh keeps active in politics. Sue Dutoit McCarthy volunteers with the UNH marine biology program and Maggie Edmunds Roberts continues to substitute teach special reading. Becky Garside Murphy plays pickle ball and bridge and Barb Booth Snyder enjoys horses. MaryAnn Theophile Pappanikou (graduated with me from Newton High) spent a weekend with her roommate, Donna Corsini Marshall. Both MaryAnn and Donna transferred to UNH in their junior year. MaryAnn also keeps in touch with Mary Francis Pettee Carey, Carol Biscornet Smith and Marcia Patitz Crabtree. Stuart Hodgeman lives in Cornish with his wife Mauri and stays busy chopping and stacking wood and mowing his 20+ acres of land. Stuart retired as an Air Force colonel after 27 years of flying. Joseph Schiappa has been practicing law in New Jersey since 1996 after two years of active duty as an artillery officer. His daughter, Lindsay, and son-in-law helped with the practice. After 40 years, Joe and his wife, Carolyn, sold their condo in Stratton, Vermont. Joe stays connected with his Theta Chi brothers with accounts of the monthly meetings and luncheons. Dennis Lawlor has retired as an elementary school principal on Long Island, New York, in 1996. Dennis and his wife, Diana, retired to Callawassie Island, South Carolina. They have now moved to The Villages, Florida, spending eight months a year there and “snow birding” in summer months to their cottage on Lake Ontario’s eastern shore, north of Syracuse. UNH invited the undefeated team of 1962 and the Yankee Conference Champions to celebrate and be honored during the half time of the Family Weekend game against Elon — the 60th reunion of the winning season. They enjoyed the Victory Club buffet while dining in the president’s suite at Cowell Stadium. Jim Twombly, Bob Towse and Chuck (Grzebielski) Glenn represented the team on the field with Allison Rich, the new athletic director for UNH, as the team of 1962 was honored. Sue Robinson Long wrote “We have several UNH students, OT majors, who come here on Wednesdays as part of their studies, and help people here (Riverwoods Durham,) with iPhone, computer and other tech questions. They also play brain games with residents.” Sue planned to go to Hawaii (big island) in December. Andrea Desmarais Coleman and her husband, Jack, celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary a year early in Jamaica with their family. Their three daughters and spouses, along with four grandchildren, joined in the celebration and festivities. As for me, I stay connected to UNH through my sorority sisters (Chi Omega). We chat often and I had lunch with my roommate, Andrea, and Sue Chapman Clark (Alpha Xi Delta) in Concord, in September. We reminisced about our years at UNH, laughing about driving over to Dover to Mammoth Mills to buy saddle shoes. They went perfect with our Bermuda shorts with matching knee socks and crewneck sweaters. I am also very involved with the UNH football program having an endowed scholarship and setting up the Robert “Bo” Dickson Endowed Scholarship and Spirit Award. I was also very fortunate to have four grandsons attend UNH, the Kirkpatrick brothers, who played on the club lacrosse team. We tailgated frequently at the football games. If you recall, we established the Class of 1963 Scholarship Fund at our 50th reunion. We give a scholarship annually to a deserving student. Please feel free to send a donation at any time to add to the endowment. In closing, continue to send me news for the upcoming UNH Magazine in August 2023. I love hearing from you — thank you, Cheryl Kuebler Dickson aka at UNH as “Chew.”\n\n1964\n\n… has little to say (picture sad face here)! Busy day here in Sedona, with many tasks to get ready for winter, but as my column will be SO short, I will still have plenty of time to get out and about. The brother of Daniel H. Marx of Penngrove, California, wrote to share that his brother passed away in October 2021. Our condolences to his family. I must tell you, one letter arrived … an actual letter in an envelope with a stamp! (Be still my heart!) The most welcomed post came from Ruben H. Silva in Spring, Texas. Ruben graduated with a bachelor’s in chemical engineering and went on to work in the chemical, petrochemical, oil and gas industries. These positions took him to many places worldwide, but he never forgot his time at UNH. Ruben feels that our campus remains one of the most beautiful places he has seen. His memory bank stores the rolling hills, woods and creeks where he rode his bike, the permanent residents that he met there, professors and students alike, were all very kind. “May God bless Durham, New Hampshire, and UNH!” I think many of us share his thoughts, which spurs me on to request you send me some of your fond recollections. Let me know where you’ll spend the winter months and the plans you may be creating. You know I’m “standing by” as a UNH Theatre major I have always thought of my life as an ongoing Play in Three Acts; I believe I now find myself approaching this play’s resolution — what a ride! So, as befits “encore,” I shall await “more” from any one of you! Please write!\n\nLt. Col. Charles W. Thompson, ret., was surrounded by family as he was inducted into the UNH ROTC Hall of Fame in November. From left are daughters Kristen Thompson Arensberg ’92, Amy Thompson Olsen and Susan Thompson Rafferty.\n\nTop to bottom: Jude Robbins Bagrud ’66 hosted friends at her Little Moussam Lake house in Shapleigh Maine, in August.

AXO sisters Linda King ’68, Jill Feldman Brandt ’68, Suzanne Blanchard Shore ’67, Irene Goodman Carrier ’68, Missy Brigida Windsor ’68 ’76G, Jan Maddocks Sheen ’68 and Joyce Wehren Hatch ’68 all met in Portsmouth in October.\n\n1965\n\nNatalie Salatich Jacobson published a book this year, “Every Life a Story — Natalie Jacobson Reporting,” a reporter’s journal capturing highlights of 40 years in television news in greater Boston. Of course she included her years at UNH, “a pivotal time in my life,” she shares. “The book is available on Amazon in hard cover, ebook and audible. I stay connected with our alma mater serving on the College of Liberal Arts advisory board and attending football games and other events including our reunions! Best to everyone.” You can read more about Natalie’s book on page 47. Sharon Welch Dean had a wonderful time at reunion and hopes we can have a better attended 60th one. She does miss New Hampshire but continues to live in Oregon and writes about New Hampshire. Her stories in “Six Old Women and Other Stories” was published in December 2022. The six old women in the title novella graduated from UNH in 1950, well before the class of 1965. Sharon can be reached at drsdean@gmail.com. Sam Cady tells us of his recent art exhibition entitled “Anything: More Parts of the Whole Old and New” at Howard Yezerski Gallery in Boston. You can contact Sam at slincolncady@yahoo.com for future exhibit information. Maida Hoag Atkins felt the full power of Hurricane Ian at her home in Venice, Florida, including loss of power, water and cell service for four days. She thanks all of the UNH alums who reached out to her offering help and support. It makes her doubly proud to say, “I’m a Wildcat!” David Hubler ’65G and his wife Rebecca made the big move to Orlando after 45 years in northern Virginia. David’s degree, master’s for teachers of English, is being put to good use as he is a part-time tutor with the Huntington Learning Center while Rebecca has relocated her interior design practice as well. And they also survived Hurricane Ian! Betty Latham Schleder calls herself a crazy thrill-seeker and a sky diving fanatic living in Sun City, Texas. She jumps out of airplanes with residents on their 100th birthdays. She has jumped with a 103½-year-old man who broke the Guinness World record. She plans to dive again with Governor Abbott and others, including five veterans with prosthetic limbs. She says, “Life is what you make it!” Bette O’Brien Kirby passed away peacefully in June 2022 surrounded by many family members. She is survived by her husband of 56 years, Rick, and their children and grandchildren. She is preceded in death by her parents and two sisters. She was born and raised in Portsmouth and was an elementary teacher in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, and an active volunteer with the Girl Scouts. She was a member of Phi Mu sorority and is sadly missed by all her sisters. Bette fought cancer with every fiber in her body until she just couldn’t anymore. Edgar Quiet, electrical engineering major, sends greetings from Bradenton, Florida, and also had a very close call from Ian, escaping with only tree damage. They were actually in New Hampshire visiting friends and enjoying their special places. My husband, Lt. Col. Charles W. Thompson, ret., was inducted into the UNH ROTC Hall of Fame in a ceremony in November, attended by me and our three daughters, Kristen Arensberg ’92, Amy Olsen and Susan Rafferty, his sister, Elizabeth Kirby, and his cousin, John Keegan. Other members of the class of ’65 who have also been inducted in past years are Ralph Young, Armand Francoeur, Jim Murray, John Pappas, David Eastman and John Gagnon. I received multiple obituary notices from the alumni office, too many to feature all of them. If you want more information, feel free to email me directly and I will send you the obits. First are the 1965 graduate students, who all passed away in April 2022: Dr. Andrew J. Stollar in Exeter, who had a long career in education, finishing at Bentley College where he was a professor; Blair H. Campbell, who made his home in Vermont and Florida and travelled extensively, and who passed away on an April day after seeing the first daffodil of the season bloom in his yard; John P. Mahoney in Franconia, who served in the Marines and was a carpenter for most of his life. Nicholas Tzimopoulos passed away in Medford, Massachusetts. He received a bachelor’s in chemistry/mathematics and enjoyed a very successful career in education. Robert Wendell Oslin of Bessemer, Alabama, died in May 2022. He received his bachelor’s in agriculture-forestry and was a member of Alpha Gamma Rho. Richard Rogers of Fort Collins, Colorado, passed in August 2022. He completed his bachelor’s in Frankfurt, Germany, while serving in the U.S. Army. William Moran Kelly, Jr. graduated from the Thompson School of Science and Technology Program. He lived and died in Winchester, Massachusetts, in September 2022 and also was a member of AGR fraternity. Maria Kriton Sinclair of Atkinson also passed away in September, having received her bachelor’s in elementary education and enjoyed a teaching career in Londonderry.\n\n1966\n\nBetty (Liz) Thibeault and husband, Jim Marchant (Lehigh ’66), celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary in September 2022. “We enjoyed a three-week trip to France and visited Nice, St. Paul de Vence, the Luberon in Provence, and Paris.” Liz retired in 2009 and worked in information technology marketing for the former Digital Equipment Corp. and EMC the last 29 years of her career. Richard Dunn has initiated a series of podcasts for the Strategic Institute for Innovation in Government Contracting promotes innovation in government business practices including but not limited to research and development (R&D) and the way the government acquires needed new capabilities. He’s added the podcasts to other resources, print articles and videos, on the strategicinstitute.org website. Other transaction agreements pioneered by Rick when he was general counsel of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) played a key role in accelerating the government’s partnering with industry to rapidly develop new vaccines, therapies and testing methodologies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n1967\n\nGreetings from the class of 1967. We had a wonderful, low-key 55th reunion with our friends from 1965 and 1966. We’ve received many updates from our classmates who were unable to attend: One response came from Anne Boynton Awad. We were sorry to learn that Anne has been widowed twice; she has moved to a Vermont town where she has been active in her community and continues as a consultant to the federal government in integrated health care. Another Jessie Doe friend Ruth Rolland Oduor writes that she and husband Ralph also a UNH grad took a wonderful trip to Oregon to visit their son and enjoy camping and hiking along the MacKenzie River. Back home her daughter’s church is sponsoring an Afghan family with six children and Ruth helps out with tutoring the adults with English. Fond UNH memories: trying to climb the greased pole at Freshman Camp to retrieve the beanie and Outing Club adventures to Franconia Notch where they stayed in the UNH cabin! Charles Sniffen remembers the times at Ritzman Lab and his mentor Dr. Jim Holter who stimulated him to go beyond his masters’ degree. Steve Harvey thanks us for our efforts to maintain contacts with alums. Steve reports on a long-planned, strenuous, challenging, 8-day bike riding trip to Italy through the Apennine Mountains. He survived! And then enjoyed 10 days of tourist travel in Florence and Sienna with copious quantities of Italian food! Manchester’s Dave Steelman writes that he and wife Ginny Theo-Steelman ’63 ’69G have been married 53 years. They met in UNH graduate school and after a tour of duty in Long Binh, Vietnam, he returned to receive a law degree from Boston University while Ginny received her doctorate at Northeastern. Both are now retired, Dave from a 40-year career working with judges and officials on court management and Ginny from a private practice as a psychologist. They’ve traveled as tourists to more than 75 countries. We congratulate the Steelmans on their three endowed UNH scholarships as well as their individual UNH scholarships to their local high school graduates. Dave recently received an honorary appointment as affiliate professor of justice studies in the College of Liberal Arts! Our classmates will enjoy your UNH recollections and your adventures since graduation. Congratulations to all on your successes. Please write again. Dave Steelman concludes: “Take good care of yourself and your loved ones.” ’Til we meet again.\n\nTop to bottom: Berneen Bratt ’69 ’86G has been travelling and exploring in recent months. Phi Mu Deltas from class years 1967 through 1970s recently got together at The Holy Grail restaurant in Epping.\n\n1968\n\nI survived the wind and rain with no damage but the golf course was closed for two weeks. There were 12 inches of water in a two- to three-day period, and the Saint John’s River just kept overflowing leaving a big mess. I just returned from Kentucky where my friend and I co-taught a two-day sewing class to a group of 20 quilters. We also spent one day in Louisville and toured the Peerless distillery and of course had a tasting. Bill and Sandy Rothwell were not available to visit with us, but I did speak with them, and they are doing well. Paul Ambrose and his wife, Valerie, have been renovating houses in the New London area since retiring from the New Hampshire Community College System. Paul was the online education director of CCSNH after working in financial/operations management. Douglas Vaughan and his wife recently returned from a Road Scholar bus tour of seven national parks in Colorado. Cynthia Sleeper Ledger and her husband have been enjoying retirement by the Rhode Island beaches and has recently had surgery (knee replacement). Another bionic woman in the class of 1968! Dick Feren and his wife have been hosting a Ukrainian refugee who has been in U.S. since July and is working to be a U.S. citizen. The Alumni Center sent me the obituaries from our class: David K. Bamford, Michael Boronski, Roy Hewes, Robert (Skip) McLeod and Donna Willette. The 1968 55th Reunion is coming up, June 2-4, 2023! Make plans to attend another memorable weekend in Durham with old friends. Add the dates to your calendar and make sure your friends do the same. Check the 1968 Facebook group page: www.facebook.com/groups/unh1968 for updates. More info is available at: www.unh.edu/reunions. Registration will open mid-March. Greetings from central Florida.\n\n1969\n\nWOW!! At the time of this writing, it is already fall and the New Hampshire foliage is vibrant. Kathy and I enjoyed our spring and summer. Filled with several family gatherings, Ohio and the Cape, kayaking and hiking. Fourteen Phi MU Delta’s, representing the classes of ’67 to ’70, from Maine to New York, had a reunion at the Holy Grail restaurant in Epping. It was great to catch up on life after UNH and reliving old memories. Gary Ladd sent a note thanking the magazine for all the updates. Thanks to Gary for his support. Heard from Berneen Bratt (also ’86G) who is “living the dream” — five weeks in Italy, five weeks exploring U.S. national parks and an upcoming four-week Pacific cruise. Go Berneen! Our condolences go out to all the family and friends of our classmates listed in the class of 1960s in memoriam section (see Page 78). Enjoy the winter and please stay in touch — send in your news and updates for the summer issue!\n\nClassmates from 1970, ’71 and ’72 reunited to celebrate their 50th reunions in June 2022 after two years of Covid delays.\n\n1970\n\nOur class is still basking in the afterglow of our great 50th reunion. Have you seen the photos of the fun? If not, you’ll find them here www.flickr.com/photos/unh/albums. It’s not too late to send your own memories of what Patti (Gabriel) Kemen called “the best reunion ever.” Our class gathered with the classes of 1971 and 1972 by necessity, after COVID-related postponements, but many on hand agreed with Jeff Crane that this added to the fun: “Great seeing and talking with people from all three classes.” The favorite memory of our reunion chair, Craig Abbott? “Getting up at dawn to be first in line with Susan Pratt Mooney, Bob Mooney and Janet Hall Kerchner to climb the T-Hall tower and ring the T-Hall bell. Left a message near the bell for all our classmates.” Craig did the coin toss at Homecoming as well-earned recognition for chairing that committee, and I learned of Craig’s honor via a note from Eric Halvorson, the unofficial but exceptionally helpful Concord correspondent for our class. One of Eric’s favorite reunion moments came as he was leaving Adams Tower on Sunday and met one of the two dozen TKEs, a great turnout for the fraternity. Eric also enjoyed talking at Homecoming with his former roommate Bill Chase. For Jim Fiore, the reunion highlights included two talks by President James Dean. Jim said that in one the president did “an amazing review of what happened at UNH during the years of 1965 to 1972 such as what songs were popular each year.” Jim also appreciated that President Dean touched on special events, such as a Simon and Garfunkel concert and a visit from three of the Chicago 7, and that he gave background on what was occurring in the wider world, such as at Kent State and in Vietnam. Jim went to a second impressive talk by the president that included data on how highly rated UNH is in certain categories, compared with other public universities. Cynthia Herbert Adams says she was mis-listed with the class of 1969 in an earlier issue of UNH Magazine, which mentioned that she has a historical novel out, “The Red Toque: Love and Loss in the Time of Tito.” She’s a member of the class of 1970, so be sure to search online for more about her book if you enjoy following our classmates’ literary careers. Cindy’s husband, Roger A. Adams, can enjoy the reflected glory: He’s in our class, too. We are so sorry to report the loss of several of our classmates: William P. Moore ’70G, the Rev. William R. Baran; Gwendolyn Dewey and Russell Mark Saulnier ’70G. Please search online for the obituaries of these much-valued classmates, whom we will miss and remember.\n\n1971\n\nFirst, I realized I had forgotten to write about Rocky Mann who is a potter in Hull’s Cove, Maine. He remembers an “amazing clay department” at UNH and he’s been making pottery for 50 years. I don’t have space to write more, but you should check out Rocky and his pottery at his gallery on Breakneck Road in Hull’s Cove near Bar Harbor. Gail Ramsey writes that she and her husband Jim had a GREAT time at the reunion, and I will second that. “It was so much fun getting together with the class behind us AND the class ahead of us. We’re looking forward to the 55th and the 60th!” Joan Nippo writes that she also had a great time with her fellow Scott Hall classmates (me, Joan Slavin Rice and Nancy Frost, for starters) and that the committee did a great job (not to blow our own horn, but we really DID, thanks to Corena Garnas and Phebe Moore ’13 who coordinated the reunion for UNH). The food was excellent, and the venues were nicely coordinated. Joan has just retired from her 50-year career as a registered dietician in Rhode Island. She got her undergrad education in this field at UNH. Doug Knapp, one of my co-conspirators in reunion planning, just wrote to reiterate that the 50th exceeded all of his expectations. A lot of the fun was in the planning. I can second this as our committee was THE BEST and Doug hopes to see everyone again soon, maybe at a hockey game! Joanna Wakefield Smith writes of her memories of the late ’60s and early ’70s. Drugs, hippies, rock and roll and fabulous professors. Prof. Asher Moore had been to NYC over break one term in 1968 and went to see “Hair.” For the first philosophy class after he came back, he set up giant speakers, put on the recording of “Hair” and left the room. Joanna lives a more socialized, normal life now (don’t we all!). She still has horses, a love which developed at UNH in the summer riding program with Robin Culver ’71. She still does weekly carriage driving lessons with Robin even now. Sandra Gookin Lane writes that she and her husband Al are now both retired and doing well. They just celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary on the Big Island in Hawaii. Sarah Doucette writes she is deeply involved in activism for clean water and solid waste management reform in New Hampshire, prompted by a proposal for a landfill in the North Country. Her family’s attachment to the land there and the call to stewardship and social justice have been compelling for her. Thomas G. Dimitriadis offered a memory of his Greek classes with Professor John Rouman. He credits Dr. Rouman with teaching him how to study (a skill not to be taken lightly). Dr. Rouman sadly just passed away in August at the age of 96 in Durham. I also took Greek (one semester) from Dr. Rouman and remember him fondly. Thomas notes that his Greek studies have allowed him to follow the services in the Greek Orthodox Church of which he has been a faithful member since 1975. Eternal be the memory of Dr. John Rouman (you can read his obituary on page 76). Martha Whitten Howell writes she and her husband, Peter, retired four years ago to the easternmost spot in the U.S., Lubec, Maine. She says retirement is wildly busy. If you ever get to Lubec, she recommends the Lubec Brewing Company! David Goodof writes he will be retiring in May from 25 years of teaching at Salem State University. He is divorced with two sons, five grandchildren and a new one due in December. He’s not sure what he will do in retirement but he’s ready for adventure! Steve Little wrote to correct the actual members of SPICE. They were Charlie Daniels, Dave Duquette, Steve Little, Eric Sawtelle, Chris Buff Sheard, Dave DuQueen, Tom Stollar and Crawf Butler. Earlier members included Eddie Klein and Craig Abbott. (I didn’t remember that Craig — very cool!). Rich Schavone coached the Australian diving team in the Tokyo Olympics and is presently at University of Texas-Austin as an assistant coach. He’s there until May, then heading back to Laconia and Lake Winnipesaukee. If you didn’t make it to the reunion, you can’t imagine the fun you missed, but you can find the photos at: www.flickr.com/photos/unh/albums. If and when we do another one, make the effort to be there! Lastly Lizbeth Katherine Cummings died last June. She met her husband, Charlie ’70, at UNH. They were both from service families and lived in many different places. She worked at the Pentagon before they moved back to New Hampshire and she worked at Pease Air Force Base. She later became a contracting officer at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.\n\n1972\n\nPaul M. Turner writes, “Hello fellow grads. I’m still working at my insurance agency in my hometown of Farmington. Recently, my wife and I returned from a 14-day trip to Ireland which was fabulous spending that much time travelling along the entire coast and visiting where my ancestors lived.” Lou Ureneck has been named a visiting fellow of the Institute of Hellenic Culture and the Liberal Arts at The American College of Greece. Lou retired from Boston University and now is writing and traveling with his wife, Irene. They spent several weeks this summer in Greece, where he was invited to lecture.

Mary Albyn retired in 2018 after practicing occupational therapy for 44 years! Her expertise was doing hand therapy, home care and school OT. She was first married to Steve Metcalfe ’73 for 11 years and they have two daughters. Mary is now happily married to the love of her life, and they enjoy traveling together. Sadly, Mary reports the passing of Steve this summer from cancer. Desmond Peri writes that after graduating from the Whittemore Business School, he went on to get an MBA from Northeastern, after which followed a career in high tech; he eventually became a CEO. In 2000, Desmond pivoted to being an interim CEO at multiple companies. Six assignments were in Europe; he lived in Dublin for four years. Presently after completing 36 interim roles, he is now retired. Desmond reports he is spending winters in the Navy Yard in Boston and summers in his lakefront Maine camp. His three sons, ages 27 to 33, have just built their own camp on a nearby lake. Sadly, I report the passing of Benjamin F. Low, Bow, in March of ALS. He attained an MBA from New Hampshire College. Among his other endeavors, Benjamin taught Tai Chi, and climbed the majority of 4,000-footers in the White Mountains. Ben also served on the board of directors for the YMCA.\n\nTop to bottom: Congratulations to Jerry Zoller ’74, who retired as civil engineer from the New Hampshire Department of Transportation this year. He was honored for his years of service by Gov. Sununu. On a chilly September eve, Ann Dillon ’75 and husband Bill hosted a fall gathering at their lakeside camp. In attendance were friends from UNH and Freshman Camp from the class of ’75 and more. “We are calling it our first annual Senior Camp!” she says. Top row, left to right: Bill Dillon, Gary Fincke ’75, Ann Donoghue Dillon ’75 ’98G, Gary Dionne ’75; middle row: Bob Murphy ’74, Gayle Murphy ’75, Martha Byam ’75, Paul “Tank” Tanklefsky ’75, Lissa Bedor Smart ’75, Wayne King ’77, Bob Eames ’75; front row: Catherine Eames, Glenn Smart ’77, Jan O’Connor, Gay Tanklefsky, Dave O’Connor ’75, Marcia Grant Dionne.\n\n1974\n\nAnother summer has gone by way too fast and we are now well into fall, as of this writing! Hope all enjoyed the summer. Vicki Follansbee Burns lives in Dover and retired in 2014 after nearly 40 years with Raytheon. She and husband John have two children and three grandsons. She hopes to return to UNH programs. Lew McQuarrie and wife, Paulette Melanson, have relocated from Concord to a 55+ community near Annapolis, Maryland, to be closer to children and grandchildren. Lew retired from RM Clark Associates after a 40+-year career selling electrical switch gears and transformers. Lew and Paulette are involved in community activities and love to travel, recently to Gdansk, Poland. A South American trip is planned for winter 2023. Lew says “hello” to former classmates, especially Lord Hall and Hubbard Hall friends. Kenneth Epstein moved last year from the New York City area to Hilton Head, South Carolina. Kenneth recently returned from travels in Belgium, Holland and Germany. A Mediterranean cruise to the Greek Islands, Croatia and Italy is scheduled for spring 2023. Jerry Zoller retired as civil engineer from bridge design with the New Hampshire Department of Transportation last June after 47 years. Jerry was recognized by his department and Governor Sununu for his service. Please share your news and reconnect with classmates and friends. Share a memory of UNH; what was your favorite class; who was your favorite professor; how did a professor influence your life; where is the strangest or farthest place that you ran into a UNH alumni? Just some thoughts.\n\nFifty years of UNH friendship: “We met in 1972, freshman year, and continue to have a yearly summertime reunion,” says Meryl Adelson Dannenberg ’76. “We are all retired and enjoy spending our time together catching up on news about our families and reminiscing about great times at UNH. We had fun in the dorms, biked out to Madbury Farms (was that the name of the place?) for picnics and enjoyed trips to the Dairy Bar.” In front is Meryl (right) with Terri Petnov ’76; back row left to right is David GaNun ’76, Edith DeBolt Tatulis ’75, Steven Hurd ’76.\n\n1975\n\nHello classmates! I hope all of you are doing well and looking forward to better times in the years to come! We have lots of news that has built up during the pandemic! Jack Barry, graduate in hotel administration, reports being happily retired after a fun 52-year hospitality/hotel industry career. He played in the Ultimate Frisbee Alumni weekend at UNH in May and the alumni won 13-8! This brings back fond memories for him since he was a member of the group that founded the original Ultimate Team in ’72,’73 and ’74. Currently living in Franklin, Massachusetts, Jack enjoys drawing and spending time with his three grandchildren. Jim Boulanger was the UNH Cross Country and Track and Field coach for 38 years. He retired in June 2021. Jim feels like he never left town as he taught at Oyster River High school before becoming the head coach of the men’s track and field program in August ’82.Jim says today’s Durham is very different than the Durham when we stepped on campus in September 1971. After 26 years as a professor of social work at UNH, Martha Byam retired in May 2021 following a year of teaching remotely. Martha and her husband, Gary Fincke ’75, moved to their ‘right size’ house in Exeter for this next chapter. So far, she is loving retirement, and their new neighborhood. She feels fortunate to have four wonderful grandchildren, two of whom live just 10 minutes away; she does a bit of babysitting which is a treat. Martha also serves on a board for a local nonprofit and helps cook for a meals program. She and Gary are happy and well and love to see anyone who comes through New Hampshire! Susan Nordholm wrote that she has retired from a career as an attorney with the federal government. She commented that UNH taught her how to write — a rare talent these days! Currently living in Williamsburg, Virginia, to be near her sister, Susan still spends every summer in Acton, Maine, to swim! She would love to hear from UNH friends. John “Rick” Crosby sends “Greetings y’all!” He is living the good Southern retired life in New Bern, North Carolina. Reflecting back on this past “Year of COVID” he reports a very unusual accomplishment. During a seven-month period, he recorded three holes-in-one. All on the same course, same hole and exactly the same hole placement and distance. “Maybe I should have played the lottery instead of playing golf!” John wishes for all fellow Wildcats to stay safe and he hopes to see some of us this year. Paul Cote wrote that his most memorable year was his freshman year in Stoke 709. It deserved to be called the “zoo” and he hears it still does! “Michael Fudala ’74 was the RA and his girlfriend, Karen Ezyk and mine, Dori Cacavas, would frequently come from Manchester to visit on weekends,” Paul writes. They both later married their girlfriends. Regretfully, Paul lost touch with them but knows that Mike became an engineer for the state of New Hampshire and settled in the Concord area (sadly, Mike passed away at in 2008 after a motorcycle accident). Paul and Dori roamed around the states for a few years, then settled in Jackson Hole in the late ’70s. They raised two sons and have lived an outdoor life. Mike was on the fire department for 25 years, retiring as a zone chief. He also owned and operated a custom residential contracting business. Currently the facilities manager for Teton County, Wyoming, he plans to retire soon. Paul still remembers his dormmates. Not all of the names, anymore, but some: Edgar Ilves, Scott Bickford, Bernie Golden, his roommate Dale?, the “Walrus.” Like many of us, he can envision others, but names are hard after 50 years! Pete Wilhelm retired after 50 years of helping clients with their taxes, accounting and planning. He selected a suitable successor firm to take care of his staff and clients. “My wife of 16 years, Karen, and I plan to travel, garden and enjoy our success.” The Dairy Bar is always a stopover when they head north. UNH was a good choice for Pete at a tough time and he wrote, “I have always appreciated my time there.” Cathy Consentino is still living in New Brunswick, Canada, where she has been since 1993 when she and her husband emigrated, “indulging my two passions as an antiques dealer and a community volunteer.” Cathy has two springer spaniels who tend shop with her, carefully supervised by three exacting cats. She co-owns Thomas Bartlett Antiques in Chichester, and in non-COVID times, had the pleasure of working there every month. Currently, she chairs the local library, sits on a county library committee and is a past provincial board member. Cathy is also on the board of the Canadian Antiques Dealers Association. She described her life as busy and satisfying. Cathy extends the best to fellow Alpha Chi gals and the Congreve crew. “Learning to love hockey at UNH has stood me in good stead here.” Lynn Lessard wrote about winding down her seventh year on staff at the University of New Mexico by serving as a program coordinator for the School of Medicine’s Office of Professional Wellbeing. Retirement plans following a near 40-year career in journalism and healthcare communications include exploring the Northwest, more yoga retreats and stepping up activism to protect our endangered environment. Mark Freel wrote about visiting our wonderful campus with his youngest child, a high school senior. Mark is hoping he will become a fellow Wildcat. “I want him to go wherever he wants, but obviously I would be thrilled to have him follow us to that great and special piece of the world in Durham. He walked through the MUB (so similar to what it was in our days) and the quad, where I spent two formative years in Hunter Hall.” Ann Donahue Dillon organized the first annual Senior Camp, inviting members of the class of 1975 and of Freshman Camp. What a great idea! Keep sending updates — it is so nice to hear from everyone. What amazing accomplishments and careers we have all had!\n\n1976\n\nI recently went up to UNH for an Alumni Soccer function on Parents Weekend. I drove through campus and marveled at the changes and saw the fun and camaraderie of students and parents at the football game prior to my events. Attending from our era were Tom Johnson, Kevin Dewhurst ’77, Scott Davis ’78 and Pat Udeh ’84 … Onto the Alumni News: Larry Meacham writes: “My years at the university were not only about education, but also growth, which is a really an important part of the experience. During my time there I had the honor of knowing a lot of very special people, developing close friendships and having the opportunity to serve as student body president. That time prepared me for a successful career in banking which I worked in until I retired in 2019. I moved to San Francisco in 1978 where I still live, continue to volunteer in politics, and take care of our two pugs. I would love to hear from those whom I went to school with.” Ken Curchin retired to San Clemente, California, with wife Claudia to be near two granddaughters after many years in Newton, Massachusetts. “Have spent the last 25 years mountain climbing and trekking across five continents. Climbed as high as 22,800’ (Aconcagua in Argentina) and trekked to Everest Base Camp in 2022,” he shares. Ilse Andrews (also ’77G) says, “Having turned 93 in May, I have made the weighty decision to stop professional translation. After graduation I spent a few years teaching college-level English in Kobe, Japan, then 10 years teaching all levels of German at the Goethe Institute in Boston (and two summers in Germany). Until recently, I was a happy free-lance translator at home. But all good things must end, and so I have stopped all professional activities. I live in a very nice assisted living community in Sudbury, Massachusetts, and maintain many earlier friendships, especially in Exeter. I still do some private teaching of German and read German literature with friends via Zoom and Skype. My relatives in Germany (some on my late sister’s side) keep in touch very warmly.” Glenn Coppelman ’76G of Kingston was recently written up in the AAA Explorer magazine for his efforts in restoring a 1939 Chevrolet Deluxe Master Sport Sedan. He and his dad purchased it in the early ’70s, drove it, then put it away. Glenn got it out of mothballs and restored “MAC” to honor his dad. Karen Williams shares, “After 20+ years out west (Arizona and recently Colorado), moved back to New Hampshire, to Meredith, having previously lived in the seacoast of New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Maine before moving to Arizona in 1999. I’ve worked all my life as a counselor, at private alternative schools for kids with emotional issues here in the east, and then out west, in the public schools as school counselor. I also became a PATH-certified riding instructor and started a mental health program at Horses Help in Phoenix, doing that for a few years, which is what pulled me to Arizona in the first place. It’s nice to be back in New England, close to family and old friends from UNH, fresh air and four seasons, fresh seafood and ice cream stands.”\n\n1977\n\nThere’s a fascinating pattern I see from our 1977 classmate’s updates — curiosity and learning. Maybe this is the secret to growth and a sense of transcendence and joy, no matter what our age? Martha Shaw (Earth science and oceanography major) went on to work as a research diver for California State Fish and Game Department and on to Shore Processes Lab at Scripps Institution of Oceanography as a staff research associate coastal geologist. She earned a master’s degree in geology at SDSU and published her research in sediment transport. She is presently completing her PhD with University of Haifa in marine geoscience and mapping and depicting sea-level stands since the last glacial maximum 26,000 years ago. Eva Silverfine’s (environmental conservation) second novel was released in October 2022. “Ephemeral Wings” is a YA (young adult) coming-of-age fable. The story follows the journey of a young mayfly nymph. Eva credits her UNH professors, Drs. James Haney (zoology) and Alan Baker (botany), with sparking her interest in stream ecology. Dr. William Bograkos recently returned home to New Hampshire after his retirement from military medicine. He last served as a consultant for the Trauma Recovery service at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, He is currently mentoring military medical scholarship students at the University of New England, medical students through the American Osteopathic Academy of Addiction Medicine’s addiction medicine mentorship program, and the young professionals and students special interest group of the World Association for Disaster and Emergency Medicine. Robert Begiebing ’77Phd, has just published his tenth book, “Norman Mailer at 100: Conversations, Correlations, Confrontations” (LSU, 2022), commemorating the centenary of Mailer’s birth. The book is one contribution to the dozen books, two documentary films (American and European), two plays, a television series and a celebration in April 2023 at the Ransom Center at the University of Texas where the Mailer archives are stored. Bob is professor of English emeritus at Southern New Hampshire University. His Authors Guild website is at www.begiebing.com. After 43 years in the computer industry, Dawn Kimball retired in August and reports that she’s not missing work one bit as she’s busy on her Tennessee farm with horses, dogs, goats and bees who make award winning honey! Dawn’s been on a few trips in her new motorhome and is getting through a long list of things she had put off for years. Laura Gieg Kell, one of the members of the original women’s ice hockey team — which she remembers as so much fun — recently relocated from Massachusetts to Kittery, Maine. Mother of five children, Laura’s looking forward to going to more UNH events. She’s also looking to connect with Trina Hatch, another member of the UNH women’s ice hockey team. You can reach Laura at 62 Wallingford Sq. No. 102, Kittery, ME 03904. Neil Cohn has lived in the New Hampshire seacoast area for more than 50 years, liking Kittery more than Portsmouth and enjoying some of the great Kittery restaurants. Neil retired in 2020 from a career as a materials manager; the best part of his work was being part of a team. Look forward to hearing from you! I may be biased (yes), but I think there was some kind of magic in the 1970s in Durham that lives on in us. Was it coming of age in an era of possibilities? A time of affordable higher-ed? Or maybe the resilience we developed from slogging to those early classes on dark, frigid winter days.\n\n1978\n\nBob Starr is living in Orange County, California, with his wife, Kelli. He was reminiscing about his time at UNH! Bob loved to ride his motorcycle around campus and turned this passion into a lifelong career. Currently he is the corporate communications manager for Yamaha Motor Company. The job has taken him to Japan and other fascinating places around the world. He remains in touch with fellow Gibbs Hall residents and still enjoys riding motorcycles! Bob’s note got me reminiscing about life at UNH. What are your fondest memories? I remember the beauty of the campus and running late to classes. Having just moved to the Lakes Region of New Hampshire, I am reminded of how beautiful the state of New Hampshire is on a daily basis. Anyone else move recently as one heads into retirement? Karla Marie Rhoades Russell, of Atkinson, passed away April 15, 2022. She founded her own company, GEX, Inc. in 1985 along with her husband and mentored her staff to strive for excellence. Karla loved her family and friends and vacationing with her family. Karla’s infectious smile and grace will remain with those closest to her. David Jackson Moore of Bedford passed away May 8, 2022, at his home. He worked as a senior vice president at Fidelity Investments for 38 years. During retirement, he served on the board of directors at The Educational Farm at Joppa Hill. David enjoyed spending time on Lake Winnipesaukee, gardening with his wife, supporting New England sports teams, and just enjoying his family and friends. Peter Warren, of Freeport, died peacefully May 29, 2022. Peter started his own company, Warren Construction Group in 1999. His company is known for combining the best traditions of Maine craftsmanship with new construction designs, materials, and techniques. Peter measured his success in life not by how many buildings he constructed, but by the number of lives he touched. Brandon Letellier passed away September 2022; no other information is available. Joseph Mason passed away March 2019. He proudly served in the U.S. Air National Guard. He was self-employed as a lawyer.\n\nLeft to right: Author Robert Begiebing ’77Phd. These UNH ’77ers met the first week of school and are lifelong friends. Enjoying a walk on the Marginal Way in Ogunquit, Maine, in October were Lois Kelly ’77, Phil Boole ’77 and Maura Kelly ’77.\n\nFrom left to right are Nancy Dancker Hovey ’80, Lisa Roman ’80, Karen Bolton ’80 ’84JD, Carol Sargent ’78 (who was their RA, 77-78) and Betsy Ward Vaska ’79.\n\n1980\n\nHello classmates, it’s hard to believe we’re writing the 2023 class notes, yet I’m happy to welcome a fresh new year. I can only assume that you are getting out traveling more as the volume of notes material is back to a pre-pandemic trickle. Please write and send your news, it’s the most popular section of the magazine for a reason! Long-time Wildcat Donna Funteral retired after a long career on campus. Donna was copy editor of The New Hampshire, and in the pre-computer era of the ’80s, may have typeset your resume at the popular downtown business Durham Copy. Reflecting on her career, Donna shared, “In May, I retired after 12 extraordinary years with UNH Extension, and am so grateful for this unexpected career path which led me to activities (chasing a runaway goat through a field at the county fair) and conversations (chickens, so many chickens) I never imagined would be part of my job, culminating with five years at UNH Professional Development and Training where I was challenged every day and lucky to be part of such an incredible, hard-working fun team. Thank you, Extension, for work that changed my life.” Congratulations Donna. Lisa Roman wrote she had a mini reunion with some fellow “Gibbers” in Lake Placid and sent a photo of them watching ski jumping but it looks like they may have been enjoying the beer tent too! Sadly, we report the death of Marla Martin DeVane of Grafton, Massachusetts, on April 23, 2022, after a 15-year fight against young-onset Parkinson’s Disease. She was deeply loved by her family and many friends. Marla leaves behind her husband, Charlie DeVane, their three children and several grandchildren. After spending a year as an aid in a deaf classroom, Marla was inspired to complete a master’s in deaf education at Gallaudet University. She was a passionate teacher of deaf children for many years until choosing to stay home with her young family where she ran her own children’s book business. Her passion for gardening led to work at a local greenhouse where she loved creating beautiful flower arrangements. At church, Marla sang in the choir, taught Sunday School, sign interpreted for the deaf, organized prayer groups, mentored other moms and led women’s ministries. Additionally, she participated in research studies in Boston, fundraising for the Michael J. Fox Foundation, and actively engaged in a local Parkinson’s support group. Marla’s family reminds us to live life to the fullest, take long walks, get your hands dirty planting flowers, and dance while you can!

In an effort to elicit more news, I plan to ask a different question in each class letter. I’ll include your responses (and any additional news) in the next issue. First up: Which faculty member influenced/inspired you most — and why? Bruce and Joanne Pransky Frazer live outside of Nashville, Tenn. and spend summers at Joanne’s family home in Hull, Massachusetts. My husband Greg and I had a fantastic — but all too short — visit with them at the beach in September. Great hosts, delicious food, stunning scenery and lively conversation. Wendy Parker sent a wonderful update, full of her UNH memories of the classroom, Greek life, sporting events, and extra-curricular activities. “I chose UNH as it was close to my parents and grandparents and UNH was on the cutting edge. I lived in the first-ever coed dorm. I was a little sister at the first-ever coed fraternity at UNH,” she recalls. After UNH, she taught swimming around the world for the Red Cross and the Navy and enjoyed a varied career and later worked for the Navy College Office, GEICO, a Veterans Hospital, Garrett Publishing and Marriott Hotels. She and her husband have been married since 1983. She remembers the beauty of the UNH campus. “Just to walk around the campus for all of the four seasons was lovely; I had many wonderful friends… it was a very happy time in my life.” I’m sure she was inspired by her first trip to campus in 40 years. Aleka Munroe has established Aleka Artemis Mindful Arts (find her on Facebook or LinkedIn). She uses her photos of the mundane or odd to lead audiences to explore that the obvious “meaning” is just one of many possible interpretations. She says that the exercise encourages exploration of new perspectives and compassion for ourselves and others. Through botanical pounded art, she creates artwork by pounding plant material onto watercolor paper, imprinting the pigment. She uses black or gold pen to delineate the floral print. Thomas A. O’Neill died on April 14, 2022. He received his doctorate in dentistry from NYU and practiced in NYC until 1994. Since 1994, he was a partner and owner of Greenville Family Dental Center in Albany, New York. He is survived by his wife, Christine, and his brothers, Vincent and Robert. Roberta “Bobbie” Gagnon Desmarais died on April 11, 2022. She worked for General Electric in Somersworth and then served for 20 years as the executive secretary to the superintendent of schools in Dover. She was predeceased by her husband, Lionel Desmarais. She is survived by her brother, Peter Gagnon, her son-in-law, Stephen Hunihan and grandchildren Andrew, Anne, and Caitlin Hunihan. Mary Theresa Virgin Wakefield died on Sept. 10, 2021, in Annapolis, Maryland. In 1949, Mary enlisted in the U.S. Navy and served during the Korean War.

Our condolences to the families and friends of our classmates.\n\nTop to bottom: During a recent Acacia fraternity reunion hosted by John Davis ’85 and Margaret Davis ’85, three sets of brothers that were “brothers” in the fraternity during the ’80s posed for a picture. From left to right (oldest in front) Dennis O’Neil ’83 and John O’Neil ‘86, Fred Kfoury ’84 and Matt Kfoury ’89 and John Davis ’85 and Jerad Davis ’90. four consecutive fraternity presidents posed for a photo: from left to right are Doug LaChance ‘87, Mike Desrochers ‘86, Rich Mazzocca ‘85 and Peter Brown ‘84. Peter flew in from St. Louis and caught up with the brothers who served in his wedding party 35 years ago (left to right): Rich Powlowsky ’84, Peter Brown ’84, Bill Kiley ’85, Kevin Maguire ’84 and Mark Laroche ’84. The gathering featured more than 60 Acacia fraternity brothers and wives from the ’80s and was a warmup for the Acacia 75th Anniversary Reunion (for brothers of all decades), which will be held during UNH’s Big ’80s 40th Reunion scheduled for June 7-9, 2024.\n\n1982\n\nDeborah Overdeput has joined the team at Chief Outsiders, which consists of experienced, fractional chief marketing officers who engage on a consultative basis with mid-market businesses. She was also appointed as a member of the Board of Advisors to UNH’s College of Engineering and Physical Sciences. Deborah continues to enjoy mentoring UNH students in her spare time. In November 2021, Linda Maxson and her husband had the chance to visit with Professor Mike Andrew and he kindly shared his latest book, “The Place.” On a recent road trip from Bainbridge Island, Washington, to Waupaca, Wisconsin, and back, they read the book aloud to each other and discovered some amazing passages about UNH, as well as some great insights about what made Michael D. Andrew the man he is today. Linda writes that the book is a wonderful reminder of Durham in the fall! Jim Ambrose recently retired from nearly 40 years working as a senior scientist for the Nestle Purina Petfood Company in Seattle and Kansas City. He and his wife Andrea eagerly embraced retirement and sold their home and moved to North Port, Florida, on the Gulf Coast. Sadly, they were in the direct path of Hurricane Ian which tore through the west coast of Florida in late September. Jim wrote at the time that he and his wife were able to evacuate to Miami but still didn’t know the extent of the damage this powerful storm had on their home. Our thoughts are with Jim and his wife and all the other people who were affected by this terrible storm. Thomas (Toby) Weir of Rochester, New Hampshire, writes that he celebrated his 80th birthday in August.\n\n1983\n\nI spent part of a beautiful weekend in late October at the Head of The Charles Regatta which brought back a lot of memories — walking over and under the Eliot Bridge, cheering from the riverbank and watching tall young people (and some shorter ones) have a great time competing in a three-mile race upstream alongside 11,000 other athletes. UNH had two entries this year — a men’s and women’s collegiate four. More team spirit was needed to cheer them on — let’s make a plan to support them next year! Chris Avery emailed that he joined the advisory board of the Paul College of Business and Economics hospitality management program, where he is very excited to be working alongside other distinguished alumni and invites anyone to contact him with ideas and questions. Chris is also celebrating his 20th year with Cvent, a virtual, in-person and hybrid event technology company and is still having so much fun, he has no immediate plans to retire. In all his spare time, Chris is performing with The Crab Shack Band. They recently performed at The Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford with the Doobie Brothers. You can see him in action at www.thecrabshackband.com. Exciting news for our upcoming 40th reunion — yikes! We have decided to have the Big ’80s celebration — a joint venture with the classes of ’84, ’85 and ’86 on June 7-9, 2024. The Big ’80s committee is looking forward to an even larger event than they had in 2019, when they had more than 500 classmates spend the weekend in Durham and Portsmouth. We’re excited to be joining in the fun! If you are interested in volunteering for this memorable and festive occasion, please contact committee chairs John Davis ’85 at johncdavis@comcast.net or Robin Schell ’84 at rschell@jjwpr.com. We begin planning this spring and summer, so watch for more information on the Big ’80s Facebook page www.facebook.com/groups/big80sreunion.

Lamont. Fun fact: her career in early childhood started with a work study job at the Durham Infant Center. Last year, Beth was named a Salzburg Global Seminar Fellow representing the U.S. among education policymakers from 30 countries. She currently works with colleagues from China, Uganda, South Africa, and Tanzania on early education challenges. She got to celebrate her daughter Caroline’s wedding with her former “Sunnyside Road crew” — fellow ’84 alums Bethany Yovino, Maureen Leavitt and Glenn Yovino. Speaking of getting together with classmates: Can you believe it’s time to start talking about our Big ’80s 40th UNH Reunion? Everyone should hold June 7-9, 2024, for the big event! This will be a quadruple celebration that will include the classes of 1983, ’84, ’85 and ’86. We are looking for volunteers to help with planning and outreach — I’m a co-chair along with John Davis ’85 (johncdavis@comcast.net), so please email if you’d like to get involved! Phi Mu sisters from the ’80s contact Barbara Powlowsky bpowlowsky@gmail.com, who will be coordinating the Phi Mu sorority reunion that weekend. Planning is under way, so watch the Big 80s Facebook group page: www.facebook.com/groups/big80sreunion for the news and updates. Caroline Reese (Remmie) Brown wrote to say she joined the Army after graduating from UNH. During her career, she was stationed in Alabama (Fort McLellan) and Germany (Heidelberg, Manheim and Frankfurt). She earned her MBA at Troy State while in the reserves at Fort Benning (while also working full-time and raising two kids!) Caroline currently resides in Bay Minette, Alabama. She is now retired and would love to connect with old pals Christine Crimaldi, Kim Smith and Clare Kashulines. You can find her at 40880 County Road 39, Bay Minette, AL 36507. Gary Hastings got in touch to say he has retired after working 38 years at the MITRE Corporation in Bedford, Massachusetts. While at UNH, he lived in Engelhardt and has fond memories of attending many UNH hockey games in ‘Lively Snively’ and football games — he looks forward to getting back to Durham more often now. After UNH, he earned his master’s in computer sciences from Northeastern University. As a retiree, he loves having more time for landscaping and gardening at his home in North Reading, Massachusetts; volunteering; and traveling with his wife (Heidi Wiberg Hastings ’85) who also just retired. Gary and Heidi just celebrated their 35th wedding anniversary and they have three kids, Kyle, Jackson ’20 and Allison. Fun fact: Gary proposed to Heidi in 1986 on the banks of Mill Pond in Durham while visiting the campus. In May, we attended a spectacular wedding at the Thompson Inn in Durham, hosted by Maggie and David Kerkhoff for their son Jason and his bride Caroline. We enjoyed catching up with the Sigma Nu crowd, including Mike Butterfield ’83 and Julie Lake Butterfield ’82, Tom Torr ’82 and his wife, Lisa, and Steve Silva ’82. While attending the 40th anniversary of the Acacia fraternity re-chartering at the home of John Davis ’85 and Meg Kimball Davis ’85, I caught up with Barb and Rich Powlowsky. Rich continues to work for Siemans; Barb retired from her career in healthcare last year. She and Rich are enjoying the opportunity to travel more; this past year, they hiked Mount Baker in Washington state and have plans to spend three weeks in Morocco in 2023. They’re looking forward to the September 2023 wedding of their son, Evan, who resides in Burlington, Vermont. Pete Brown flew in from St. Louis to connect with all the brothers, including his former Lord Hall roommate Dave Ports, who lives in Bedford with his wife Kathleen ’91. They have a son, Sam, at the University of Evansville and a daughter, Lilly, who is in eighth grade. Dave retired from the YMCA and is enjoying his new role as ‘softball dad.’ John Beecy and Peter Kulbacki drove from Vermont for the festivities and Renney Morneau came from Berlin (New Hampshire, not Germany). Other classmates attending the celebration included Kevin Maguire, Fred Kfoury, and SAE brother Mark Laroche. Unfortunately, we lost several classmates recently. Rae Ann Hoyt Chrane of Rochester passed away in May 2022 after a courageous battle with chronic illness. A Portsmouth native, she graduated from UNH in ’84 with a bachelor’s in English and a minor in French. Rae Ann worked as a compliance administrator for Amwins Program Underwriters in Portsmouth and served for many years as the gymnastics coach at Spaulding High School. Most of us will remember Rae Ann for her devotion to UNH; she was instrumental in establishing the Class of ’84 scholarship, attended many Wildcat hockey games and stayed engaged in a variety of alumni activities over the years. She is survived by her loving husband of 33 years, Scott, her daughter Sarah and Sarah’s husband Ryan of Dover. She will be missed by many in the UNH community, including me. In June 2022, Paul Vincent Hayden of Manchester passed away unexpectedly from natural causes at age 64. He earned a bachelor’s degree in political science from UNH and spent more than four decades engaged in a business career for the automobile and hospitality industries. He is survived by many relatives, including his pride and joy, daughter Molly Grace Hayden. Corinne Walker Sterling passed away at age 60 after a lifelong career in physical therapy. She received a bachelor’s degree in pre-physical therapy from UNH, and in 1987 earned a master’s degree in physical therapy from Columbia University. Corinne was a longtime member of the Westminster Presbyterian Church and served on the executive committee of WPC’s chapter of Living Waters for the World. She organized and participated in several mission trips to Peru, assisting with the installation of water filtration systems for communities in need. She is survived by her husband of 32 years, Timothy, and daughters Whitney and Olivia.\n\n1985\n\nHi, everyone! Let’s get excited for the Big ’80s Reunion in June 2024 (June 7-9)! Whoo -hoo! You’ll be getting more updates and seeing them in the Class Notes as well. We will celebrate with the classes of 1983 through 1986. Volunteers are needed to help with planning and outreach — e-mail the co-chairs to get involved: our own John Davis at johncdavis@comcast.net or Robin Schell ’84 at rschell@jjwpr.com! You don’t have to live near UNH to volunteer. We’ll begin planning this spring and summer, so watch the Big ’80s Facebook Group Page: www.facebook.com/groups/big80sreunion for announcements of information and planning meetings. Speaking of John, in October he hosted a mini reunion for Acacia fraternity brothers from the ’80s. More than 60 people attended the event with more than 40 brothers, spouses and friends traveling to Bedford for the beautiful fall cookout catered by KC’s Rib-Shack out of Manchester. Brothers representing most of the classes of the ’80s were in attendance. Members of the class of ’85 at the celebration included John and Margaret (Kimball) Davis, Rick Mazzocca, Bill Kiley, Eric Berg, and Jim Wieczorek. Jay Feeney and Jim Lapierre ’86 who both could not attend sent messages wishing their brothers well. Members of the class of 1986 who attended included Jack Lee, Kevin Cuff, Todd Fleming, Jon George, Mike Desrochers, Steve Garabedian, Brian Giroux, Todd Riley, and Jay Barriss. Acacia will be celebrating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the UNH chapter during the Big ’80s 40th Reunion in 2024. The event will be open to brothers of all decades, so please hold the date and look for additional information later this spring. Many of you reached out via email: Jill (Belon) Leavitt lives in Vermont with her husband and would love to hear from any computer science or marching band classmates. Some of her favorite memories: Finding mail in her Stillings mail slot, weekly freshman English papers, going on a canoe trip down the Androscoggin River with my roommate Lucy McGee ’86 with the Outing Club (she distinctly remembers eating oatmeal in a coffee mug) and staying up all night discussing life with Laurie Flegert. “Pulling an all-nighter to get a computer program done and then coming out of Kingsbury with the sun coming up and feeling on top of the world (program complete),” Jill says. She also remembers crazy bleacher antics with the marching band during football games with Larry Lang as conductor, watching the gingko tree leaves fall near James Hall, a senior ocean project with Tom Schmottlach (also ’87G) and Steve Rossi — specifically riding on the Jere Chase to Isle of Shoals searching for geodetic markers and then the final presentation to professionals at the New England Center. Heidi (Wiberg) Hastings got her bachelor’s in business administration with a concentration in finance from WSBE (the old Whittemore School of Business & Economics) and received her MBA from Northeastern in 1990. She recently retired from working in finance for 38 years for various high-tech companies including Raytheon, Sybase (software), and Teleflex (medical devices). Heidi and high school sweetheart and UNH ’84 alumni Gary Hastings are celebrating their 35th wedding anniversary this month. Gary proposed to Heidi in 1986 on the banks of Mill Pond in Durham while visiting the campus. They have three adult children: Kyle, Jackson ’20, and Allison. Heidi has kept in touch with her old Jessie Doe roommates and dorm friends. Now that they’re retired, Gary and Heidi plan on getting back to Durham and the beautiful UNH campus more often. Thanks, Heidi and Jill. All my best to fellow classmates; I’m always happy to hear from you — look to this space for more updates soon!\n\n1986\n\nGreetings! I hope 2022 treated you well and 2023 is starting out strong. For most of us, 2022 meant we celebrated 40 years since graduating high school. I hope to see Priscilla Downie Thoma at my upcoming high school reunion and spend some time catching up. Did your high school class have a 40th reunion with UNH grads there? Keep those notes and e-mails coming and send photos with your UNH classmates from reunions and other gatherings. With each reunion, the ’80s music transports me back in time. What songs take you back to our time at UNH? “Burning Down the House” instantly brings back Bids Night 1983. Good times! Closer to the present, David Hall is staying young playing tennis. The tennis team alumni and current club tennis team recently played a tournament on the newly resurfaced courts at Wildcat Stadium. He reports it was a tremendous event that included great competition and he’s looking forward to next year’s alumni tournament. Best of all, David was paired with Kennedy McGrath ’25 and they won! Allyn Kunz Jones made it to campus, too. Her daughter is a junior studying nutrition, and they had a blast together tailgating at the Parents’ Weekend football game. I was delighted to hear from my chem e. classmate John Pantazopoulos. John has been married to Nancy for 32 years and has two adult children. He has been with GE Aerospace for 25 years and is currently managing logistics for an F/A 18 Super Hornet jet Navy contract. His most interesting travel assignment was working in Italy on a three-year temporary assignment running ‘Tiger Teams’ in jet engine component manufacturing. Thinking back to UNH days, John said his favorite professors were Drs. Donald Sundberg and Ihab Farag because they were the most passionate and personable. Another favorite of John’s was the food at Karl’s, which was conveniently close to Hunter Hall. His advice to current UNH students is just as applicable to those of us with mature careers. “Love what you do and take positions and opportunities that others warn you not to take! It’s then at your lowest of lows or in the most challenging of times that your future takes an upturn for the best!” Speaking of someone doing their best, did you know that Barry Zimmerman was named the Leaders Club qualifier by The Guardian Life Insurance Company of America? Leaders Club is one of the highest honors annually awarded by Guardian to financial professionals who demonstrate outstanding service and dedication to their clients. Way to go Barry! Kevin Cuff reached out with news. Since 2015, he’s been the deputy commissioner for mortgage supervision at the Massachusetts Division of Banks. Over the summer, he had the opportunity to get together with UNH cross country/track & field alumni Dan Heath ’87 and captain Rich Mazzocca ’85 to celebrate the retirement of coach Jim Boulanger ’75 after 38 yrs. We wondered together, “Where has the time gone?” How could it be nearly 40 years since we graced the hallowed halls of UNH? Well, believe it or not, it’s time to start thinking about the Big ’80s 40th Reunion. Mark your calendars now to save June 7-9, 2024, for the big event! This super-sized celebration will include the classes of 1983 throug"
