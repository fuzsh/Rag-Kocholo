        "text": "Good articles in Wikipedia\n\nA good article (GA) is a Wikipedia article that meets a core set of editorial standards, the good article criteria, passing through the good article nomination process successfully. They are well-written, contain factually accurate and verifiable information, are broad in coverage, neutral in point of view, stable, and illustrated, where possible, by relevant images with suitable copyright licenses. Good articles do not have to be as comprehensive as featured articles (FA), but they should not omit any major facets of the topic: a comparison of the criteria for good and featured articles describes further differences.\n\nCurrently, out of the 6,868,952 articles on Wikipedia, 40,082 are categorized as good articles (about 1 in 172), which are listed below. An additional 6,564 are listed as featured articles (about 1 in 1,050) and 4,432 as featured lists (about 1 in 1,550). Because articles are only included in one category, a good article that has been promoted to featured status is removed from the good articles category. Adding good and featured articles and lists together gives a total of 51,078 articles (about 1 in 135). A small plus sign inside a circle ( ) in the top-right corner of an article's page indicates that the article is good.\n\nThe process for designating an article as a good article is intentionally straightforward. Any significant contributor to an article may nominate it if they believe it meets the good article criteria. Any impartial editor may review it from the queue of good article nominations. If it meets the criteria, it is added to the list of good articles below. There are instructions for nominators and reviewers. Similarly, anyone who believes that an article no longer meets the good article criteria may propose to delist it by following the instructions for reassessment."
