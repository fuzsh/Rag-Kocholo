        "text": "Mary Jenkins, 1879-1967\n\nFounder Zonta International\n\nMary Jenkins was born in 1879 in Syracuse, NY to Arthur Jenkins, founder of the Herald newspaper. In 1903, at the age of 24, she inherited the newspaper from her father and became president of The Herald Company. “Born with printer ink in her veins,” Jenkins was a pioneering Syracuse newspaperwoman and civic leader. She was president of the newspaper until her retirement in 1957, and was quoted as having made “one of the longest contributions to continuous newspaper service in the history of New York State.”\n\nShe helped found Zonta International in 1919 in order to bring together women who had occupied important positions during the First World War. The organization still exists today. Jenkins was elected the first president of the Confederation of Zonta Clubs and the Syracuse Zonta Club, as well as an international charter member from 1919-1921.\n\nShe also helped found Syracuse Memorial Hospital, served on the board for 34 years, and was its president for 15 years. Furthermore, she was the first lay member of the Public Health Board of the New York State League of Nursing Education. In 1945, Mary Jenkins received a doctorate of humane letters from Syracuse University. She became an honorary member of the American Hospital Association in 1948. In 1950, the Jewish War Veterans named her “Syracuse’s most outstanding citizen.” Jenkins died in 1967, and is buried next to her husband in Oakwood Cemetery.\n\nSource Onondaga Historical Association\n\nFlorence Nightingale, 1820-1910\n\nEnglish Nurse, Social Reformer and Statistician\n\nNightingale gave nursing a favorable reputation and became an icon of Victorian culture.\n\nIn 1860, Nightingale laid the foundation of professional nursing with the establishment of her nursing school at St Thomas' Hospital in London. It was the first secular nursing school in the world, and is now part of King's College London. In recognition of her pioneering work the Nightingale Pledge, taken by new nurses, and the Florence Nightingale Medal, the highest international distinction a nurse can achieve, were named in her honor. Her social reforms included improving healthcare for all sections of British society, advocating hunger relief in India, helping to abolish harsh prostitution laws, and expanding acceptable forms of female participation in the workforce.\n\nNightingale was a prodigious and versatile writer. She was also a pioneer in the use of infographics, effectively using graphical presentations of statistical data.\n\nNightingale led the first official team of British military nurses to Turkey during the Crimean War between Britain and Russia (1853-56). There, more soldiers died from disease than wounds and Nightingale advised the army medical services on how to reduce avoidable deaths. She was nicknamed ‘the Lady with the Lamp’ for the night rounds she made tending to the wounded and sick. Nightingale continued in her work after the war and was instrumental in establishing a permanent military nursing service and implementing improvements to the armymedical practices.\n\nSource History Extra and Wikipedia\n\nJane Addams 1860-1935\n\nSocial Reformer\n\nAddams was an American settlement activist, reformer, social worker, sociologist, public administrator, and author. She stood out in history for her social work and women’s suffrage in the US and an advocate for world peace.\n\nJane’s accomplishments are many. She co-founded Chicago’s Hull House, one of America’s most famous settlement houses.\n\nIn 1910, Jane was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree from Yale University, becoming the first to receive an honorary degree from the school. In 1920, she co-founded the ACLU, and in1931 she became the first American woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. She has been recognized as the founder of the social work profession in the US and is known by many as the first woman public philosopher in the United States.\n\nJane helped America address and focus on issues concerning mothers, such as the needs of children, local public health, and world peace. Addams became a role model for middle class women who volunteered to uplift their communities.\n\nHull House and the Peace Movement are widely known as the key tangible pillars of Addams’ legacy. She worked with other reform groups toward goals including the first juvenile court law, tenement house regulations, an eight-hour work day for women, factory inspections, and workers’ compensation.\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nMargaret Sanger, 1879-1966\n\nBirth Control Advocate\n\nSanger was an American birth control activist, sex educator, writer, and nurse. She popularized the term “birth control,” opened the first birth control clinic in the US, and established organizations that evolved into the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.\n\nSanger used every means she could to promote her way of thinking on “birth control.” She was prosecuted for her book Family Limitation and was forced to flee to Britain to avoid arrest. She soon returned to the US to continue her work. Margaret helped legalize contraception in the United States, but let it be known that she drew a sharp distinction between birth control and abortion.\n\nIn 1916, she opened the first birth control clinic, which led to her arrest. She wanted to prevent back alley abortions and the only practical way to avoid abortion was the use of contraception.\n\nMargaret enrolled in White Plains Hospital as a nurse probationer in 1900. In 1902 she married, had three children, and moved to Westchester, New York.\n\nSanger’s political interest, feminism and nursing experience led her to write two series of columns on sex education.\n\nIn 1948, Sanger helped found the International Committee on Planned Parenthood Federation, which became the world’s largest women’s health, family planning and birth control organization. She was the first president and remained in that role until she turned 80 years old.\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nMary Wollstonecraft, 1759-1797\n\nEnglish Philosopher and Advocate\n\nUntil the late 20th century, Wollstonecraft's life, which encompassed several unconventional personal relationships, received more attention than her writing. Today, Wollstonecraft is regarded as one of the founding feminist philosophers, and authorities often cite both her life and work as important influences.\n\nDuring her brief career, she wrote novels, treatises, a travel narrative, a history of the French Revolution, a conduct book, and a children's book. Wollstonecraft is best known for A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), in which she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a social order founded on reason.\n\nAfter two ill-fated affairs with Henry Fuseli and Gilbert Imlay (by whom she had a daughter, Fanny Imlay), Wollstonecraft married the philosopher William Godwin, one of the forefathers of the anarchist movement. Wollstonecraft died at age 38, eleven days after giving birth to her second daughter, Mary Shelley, who would became an accomplished writer and author of Frankenstein.\n\nAfter Wollstonecraft's death, her widower published a Memoir(1798) of her life, revealing her unorthodox lifestyle, which inadvertently destroyed her reputation for almost a century. However, with the emergence of the feminist movement at the turn of the twentieth century, Wollstonecraft's advocacy of women's equality and critiques of conventional femininity became increasingly important.\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nMarie Curie 1867-1934\n\nScientist\n\nMarie Sklodowska Curie changed the world not once, but twice. She founded the new science of radioactivity – even the word was invented by her – and her discoveries launched effective cures for cancer. Curie boasts an extraordinary array of achievements. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize (Physics), the first female professor at the University of Paris, and the first person to win a second Nobel Prize (Chemistry).\n\nBorn in Warsaw, Poland, Curie studied physics at university in Paris where she met her future research collaborator and husband, Pierre. Together they identified two new elements: radium and polonium, named after her native Poland. After he died, she raised a small fortune in the US and Europe to fund laboratories and develop cancer treatments.\n\nMarie Curie was a woman of action as well as enormous intellect. During the First World War, she helped equip ambulances with x-ray equipment, and often drove them to the front line herself.\n\nDespite becoming ill from the radioactive materials she constantly handled, Curie never lost her determination to excel in the scientific career that she loved. Her memory is preserved by the Cancer Society that bears her name and continues to help terminally ill patients all over the world.\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nRosa Parks 1913-2005\n\nCivil Rights Activist\n\nIn 1955, Rosa Parks, an African American living in Montgomery, Alabama, challenged race segregation by refusing to give up her seat on a bus for a white person. Her protest was supported by many other African Americans and sparked the civil rights movement, which, in the 1960s, eventually won equal rights.\n\nParks, a 42-year-old seamstress in a department store, boarded her bus for home as usual after work. As the bus became crowded, white driver J Fred Blake told Parks and other black passengers to vacate their seats. Segregation laws dictated that white passengers had priority. The blacks duly moved. Except for Parks. She sat silently still. “If you don’t stand up, I’m going to call the police and have you arrested,” Blake shouted at her. “You may do that,” Parks calmly replied. Blake left the bus and returned with two policemen. “Why don’t you stand up?” one of the officers asked Parks. “Why do you push us around?” Parks answered. “I do not know,” said the officer, “but the law is the law and you are under arrest.” She was taken off to the city jail.\n\nParks’ arrest would lead to a 13-month boycott of city buses in one of the longest mass mobilizations of a black population ever witnessed in the United States. The boycott’s church-based community activism and ministerial leadership, together with its spirit of non-violence, would become hallmarks of the civil rights movement over the next decade.\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nRosalind Franklin, 1920–1958\n\nEnglish Chemist\n\nFranklin was an English chemist and X-ray crystallographer whose work was central to the understanding of the molecular structures of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA (ribonucleic acid), viruses, coal, and graphite. Although her works on coal and viruses were appreciated in her lifetime, her contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA were largely recognized posthumously.\n\nShe is best known for her work on the X-ray diffraction images of DNA, particularly Photo 51. It is an X-ray picture showing a dark cross of dots, the signature image of a concealed molecular spiral.\n\nThis led to the discovery of the DNA double helix for which James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1962. Watson suggested that Franklin would have ideally been awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Wilkins, but the Nobel Committee generally does not make posthumous nominations.\n\nAfter finishing her work on DNA, Franklin led pioneering work at Birkbeck on the molecular structures of viruses. Her team member Aaron Klug continued her research, winning the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1982.\n\nThe life-changing innovations that followed – mapping the human genome, test-tube babies, genetic engineering – all depend on understanding the chemical foundations of heredity.\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nSandra Day O’Connor 1930-present\n\nUS Supreme Court Justice\n\nO’Connor is a retired Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States who served from 1981 until she retired in 2006. Appointed by President Reagan, she was the first woman to serve on the Supreme Court. Prior to her tenure on the Supreme Court, she was a judge and an elected official in Arizona, serving as the first female Majority Leader of the Arizona State Senate.\n\nSandra was born in El Paso, Texas.

It became known for physical confrontations: its members smashed windows and assaulted police officers. Pankhurst, her daughters, and other WSPU activists received repeated prison sentences, where they staged hunger strikes to secure better conditions, and were often force-fed. As Pankhurst's eldest daughter, Christabel took leadership of the WSPU, antagonism between the group and the government grew.\n\nA charismatic leader and powerful orator, Pankhurst roused thousands of women to demand their democratic right in a mass movement that has been unparalleled in British history. Always in the thick of the struggle, she endured 13 imprisonments, her name and cause becoming known throughout the world.\n\nIn 1999, Time named Pankhurst as one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century, stating \"She shaped an idea of women for our time; she shook society into a new pattern from which there could be no going back.”\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nJoan of Arc 1412-1431\n\nMartyr and Military Leader\n\nJoan of Arc, nicknamed “the Maid of Orleans” is considered a heroine of France for her role during the Lancastrian phase of the Hundred Years’ War.\n\nJoan claimed to have received visions of the archangel Michael, Saint Margaret, and Saint Catherine of Alexandria instructing her to support Charles VII and recover France from English domination. The uncrowned King Charles VII sent Joan to the Siege of Orleans as part of a relief army. She gained prominence after the siege was lifted only nine days later. Several additional swift victories led to Charles VII’s coronation. This long-awaited event boosted French morale and paved the way for the final French victory.\n\nOn May 23, 1430, Joan was captured by the Burgundian faction, a group of French nobles allied with the English. She was later handed over to the English and put on trial by the pro-English bishop Pierre Cauchon on a variety of charges. After he declared her guilty, she was burned at the stake on May 30, 1431 at the age of 19.\n\nIn 1456, an inquisitorial court authorized by Pope Callixtus III debunked the charges against her, pronounced her innocent and declared her a martyr. In the 16th century, she became a symbol of the Catholic League and in 1803 was declared a national symbol of France by Napoleon Bonaparte. She was beatified in 1909 and canonized as a Saint in 1920.\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nAnna Mary Robertson (Grandma Moses) 1860-1961\n\nArtist\n\nBorn in Greenwich, New York, Robertson was the third of ten children born to Margaret and Russell King Robertson.

She made significant contributions to plant paleontology and coal classification, and was the first female academic on the faculty of the University of Manchester.\n\nStopes attended the University of London as a scholarship student, where she studied botany and geology. She graduated with a first class B.Sc. in 1902 after only two years by attending both day and night schools. Following this, Stopes earned a D.Sc. degree from University College London, becoming the youngest person in Britain to have done so. She studied the reproduction of living cycads at the University of Munich, receiving a Ph.D. in botany in 1904. She held the post of Lecturer in Palaeobotany at the University of Manchester from 1904 to 1910; in this capacity she became the first female academic of that university.\n\nWith her second husband, Humphrey Verdon Roe, she founded the first birth control clinic in Britain. Stopes edited the newsletter Birth Control News, which gave explicit practical advice. Her sex manual Married Love (1918) and a second book titled Wise Parenthood – which dealt explicitly with contraception – appeared shortly thereafter. A controversial figure, especially for her views on eugenics, Stopes nonetheless was a key figure in publicizing her cause. A birth control clinic was set up in a poor working-class area of north London in 1921, bringing to women worldwide the opportunity of planned pregnancies.\n\nSource HistoryExtra & Wikipedia\n\nQueen Victoria 1819-1901\n\nQueen of England\n\nVictoria was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from June 20, 1837 until her death. On May 1, 1876, she adopted the additional title of Empress of India. Known as the Victorian era, her reign of 63 years. It was a period of industrial, cultural, political, scientific, and military change within the United Kingdom marked by a great expansion of the British Empire.\n\nShe inherited the throne at the age of 18 when her uncle, King William IV, died. In a constitutional monarchy the sovereign held relatively little direct political power. Privately, she attempted to influence government policy while publicly; she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality.\n\nVictoria was physically unprepossessing—she was stout, dowdy and only about five feet tall—but she succeeded in projecting a grand image. She experienced unpopularity during the first years of her widowhood, but was well liked during the 1880s and 1890s, when she embodied the empire as a benevolent matriarchal figure. Contrary to popular belief, Victoria was immensely amused and roared with laughter on many occasions.\n\nThrough Victoria's reign, reforms of the voting system increased the power of the House of Commons at the expense of the House of Lords and the monarch. By 1867, the monarch only retained \"the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn.” As Victoria's monarchy became more symbolic than political, it placed a strong emphasis on morality and family values.\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nAda Lovelace 1815–1852\n\nMathematician\n\nA gifted mathematician, Ada Lovelace is considered to be the first computer programmer, an industry that has since transformed business, our lives and the world. In an industry still dominated by men, it’s particularly striking that the first programmer was a woman.\n\nBorn in the early 19th century to English poet Lord Byron, she had a fascination with science and mathematics that defied the expectations of her class and gender at her time. From age 4, Ada was tutored in math, prompted by her mother’s fear that she should be exposed to her father’s randy antics and moody nature.\n\nOnly 12 years old, she conceived a flying machine in the shape of a flying horse with steam powered wings. After being introduced at the age 17 to inventor Charles Babbage, her work with him ensured she would become one of the most important figures in the early history of the computer.\n\nIn her thirties, Ada became a compulsive gambler, pawning the family diamonds to pay her debts.\n\nDespite the fact her work was only appreciated posthumously, Ada Lovelace is now regarded as one of the most important figures in the early history of the computer.

She graduated from Barnard College, and then earned her Master’s Degree in Economics from Columbia University. In 1936, she married Isaac Schwartz and began her professional career with Columbia University’s Social Science Research Council. Schwartz returned to Columbia University and earned a Ph.D.\n\nDr. Schwartz’s first published paper, British Share Prices, 1811-1850, written with Arthur Gayer and Isaiah Finklestein was published in the 1940 issue of The Review of Economics and Statistics. The paper was a precursor to much of her subsequent work, meticulous in the presentation, explanation, and interpretation of data.\n\nIn 1941, Dr. Schwartz began a more than seventy-year tenure working for the National Bureau of Economic Research. It was during this time that she met and began working with economist Milton Friedman. Together, the two co-authored A Monetary History of the United States, 1867 – 1960, which was described by Federal Reserve chair, Ben Bernanke, as “The leading and most persuasive explanation of the worst economic disaster in American history.” The massive study demonstrated that changes in monetary policy have large effects on the economy and blamed a large portion of the Great Depression on the Federal Reserve; it is one of the most widely cited texts in economics today.\n\nIn 1981, Dr. Schwartz served as the Executive Director of the United States Gold Commission; the panel was responsible for recommending the future of gold in the nation’s monetary system.

Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage to pursue favorable social standing and economic security. Her use of biting irony, along with her realism, humor, and social commentary, have long earned her acclaim.\n\nWith the publications of Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814), and Emma (1816) she achieved success as a published writer. Her six full-length novels have rarely been out of print, although they were published anonymously and brought her moderate success, but little fame during her lifetime.\n\nHer posthumous reputation improved in 1833, when her novels were republished and sold as a set. They gradually gained wider acclaim and popular readership. In 1869, fifty-two years after her death, her nephew's publication of A Memoir of Jane Austen introduced a compelling version of her writing career.\n\nDuring her lifetime, Austen may have written as many as 3,000 letters, but only 161 survived. Many of the letters were written to Austen's older sister Cassandra, who in 1843 burned the greater part of them and cut pieces out of those she kept. Ostensibly, Cassandra censored her sister's letters to prevent their falling into the hands of relatives who might read Jane Austen's acid or forthright comments.\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nMother Teresa 1910-1997\n\nAlbanian-IndianRoman Catholic Saint and Missionary\n\nMother Teresa, born in Albania, was a Roman Catholic nun who lived in India for most of her life.

What began as a picture frame manufacturing company slowly transformed into a toy company when its creators began crafting dollhouses out of wooden scraps.\n\nBarbara Handler, Ruth’s daughter, was fond of paper dolls as a child. Ruth soon realized that children frequently preferred to be adults when playing. This gave Ruth the idea to craft an adult doll that was three-dimensional, not paper. The fully formed plastic doll could wear clothing made from real fabric, not the ill-fitting paper clothing used for traditional dolls.\n\nIn 1959, Ruth introduced her new doll at the New York toy fair. It was named Barbie, after her daughter. Advertisements ran during The Mickey Mouse Club and sales of the Barbie doll elevated Mattel to success beyond their wildest dreams.\n\nIn 1970, Ruth Handler was diagnosed with breast cancer. A modified radical mastectomy was performed to save her life. Consequently, she designed and constructed a realistic breast prosthetic called Nearly Me.

She came to power following a coup d'état that she organized, overthrowing her own husband, Peter III. Under her reign, the Russian Empire expanded rapidly.\n\nThere were victories over the Ottoman Empire and Russia colonized the territories along the coasts of the Black and Azov Seas. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was eventually partitioned, with the Russian Empire gaining the largest share. In the east, Russia started to colonize Alaska, establishing Russian America.\n\nCatherine reformed the administration of Russian governmentand modernized Russia along Western European lines. Military conscription and the economy continued to depend on serfdom, and increasing demands of the state and private landowners led to increased levels of reliance on serfs. This was one of the chief reasons behind several rebellions.\n\nCatherine decided to have herself inoculated against smallpox, controversial at the time. Catherine then sought to have inoculations throughout her realm. By 1800, approximately 2 million inoculations were administered in the Russian Empire.\n\nAs a patron of the arts she presided over the age of the Russian Enlightenment, a period when the Smolny Institute for Noble Maidens, the first state-financed higher education institution for women in Europe, was established.\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nBeulah Louise Henry 1887-1973\n\nProlific Inventor\n\nHenry was an American inventor in the 1930s, and was given the nickname \"Lady Edison.”\n\nOf approximately 110 inventions, she was awarded around 49 patents over her lifetime.\n\nHenry attended North Carolina Presbyterian College and Elizabeth College in Charlotte, North Carolina, where she submitted her first patents. She moved to New York City in 1924, where she devised one of her most popular early inventions, an umbrella with a snap-on cloth cover.

She has often been referred to as the \"angel of prisons.”\n\nPrompted by a family friend, Fry visited Newgate Prison in 1813. The conditions she saw there horrified her. The women's section was overcrowded with women and children, some of whom had not even received a trial. The prisoners were confined in small cells where they slept on straw.\n\nIn 1816, she founded a prison school for the children who were imprisoned with their mothers. In 1817, she helped found the Association for the Reformation of the Female Prisoners in Newgate. This association provided materials for women so that they could learn to sew patchwork. This allowed skills to develop, such as needlework and knitting, which could offer employment when they were released. She promoted the idea of rehabilitation instead of harsh punishment.\n\nShe campaigned for rights of women at Newgate Prison who were transported through the streets of London in open carts, often in chains. She visited prison ships and persuaded captains to implement policies to ensure each woman and child would get a share of food and water on the long journey.\n\nElizabeth Fry worked with other prominent Quakers to campaign for the abolition of the slave trade.

Mary became pregnant with Percy's child. Over the next two years, she and Percy faced ostracism, and the death of their prematurely born daughter. They married in late 1816, after the suicide of Percy Shelley's first wife, Harriet.\n\nIn 1816, vacationing in Geneva, Switzerland, Mary conceived the idea for her novel Frankenstein. In 1822, her husband drowned when his sailing boat sank during a storm. A year later, Mary Shelley entirely devoted herself to the upbringing of her son and a career as a professional author. The last decade of her life was dogged by illness, most likely caused by the brain tumor, which killed her at age 53.\n\nHer novel Frankenstein, remains widely read and has inspired many theatrical and film adaptations. Recent scholars have shown increasing interest in her literary output, particularly in her novels, which include the historical novels, Valperga (1823) and Perkin Warbeck (1830). Mary Shelley's works often argue that cooperation and sympathy, particularly as practiced by women in the family, were the ways to reform civil society.\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nJosephine Butler 1828-1906\n\nFeminist & Social Reformer\n\nIn Victorian Britain, Josephine Butler brought into open discussion the double sexual standard that existed in a male-dominated society. She campaigned successfully for the repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts, which provided for the compulsory and regular medical examination of women believed to be prostitutes, but not their male clients. In later life she campaigned against child prostitution and international sex trafficking.\n\nWhile investigating the effect of the Acts, Butler had been appalled that some of the prostitutes were as young as 12, and that there was a slave trade of young women and children from England to the continent for the purpose of prostitution.\n\nA campaign to combat the trafficking led to the removal from office of the head of the Belgian Police des Mœurs, and the trial and imprisonment of his deputy and 12 brothel owners.\n\nButler fought child prostitution with help from the campaigning editor of The Pall Mall Gazette, William Thomas Stead, who purchased a 13-year-old girl from her mother for £5. The subsequent outcry led to the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, which raised the age of consent from 13 to 16 and brought in measures to stop children becoming prostitutes.\n\nSource: Wikipedia & History Extra\n\nGeorgia O’Keeffe 1887-1986\n\nAmerican Artist\n\nO’Keeffe was an American artist known for her paintings of enlarged flowers, New York skyscrapers, and New Mexico landscapes.\n\nShe was born in a farmhouse in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin to dairy farmers and the second of seven children.

In the first year, it sold 50,000 bottles; by 1984, the figure had risen to 150 million.\n\nEstée Lauder's Clinique brand became the first women's cosmetic company to introduce a second line for men, which continues to be sold at Clinique counters worldwide.\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nSally Ride 1951-2012\n\nUS Astronaut & Physicist\n\nSally Ride became the first American woman to go into space when she flew on the space shuttle Challenger on June 28, 1983. At age 32, Ride remains the youngest American astronaut to have traveled to space.\n\nSally attended Stanford University, where she was a double major in physics and English. In 1978, Ride was selected to be an astronaut as part of NASA Astronaut Group. She applied after seeing an advertisement in the Stanford student newspaper, and was one of only 35 people selected out of the 8000 applications. After graduating training in 1979, she served as the ground-based capsule communicator for the second and third space shuttle flights, and helped develop the space shuttle's \"Canadarm\" robot arm.\n\nDuring a press conference prior to her first space flight, she was subject to media attention due to her gender. She was asked, \"Will the flight affect your reproductive organs?\" and \"Do you weep when things go wrong on the job?\" Despite this, Ride insisted that she saw herself in only one way—as an astronaut.\n\nAfter flying twice on the Orbiter Challenger, she left NASA in 1987. She worked for two years at Stanford University's Center for International Security and Arms Control, then at the University of California, San Diego as a professor of physics, primarily researching nonlinear optics and Thomson scattering.\n\nShe was included in the National Women’s Hall of Fame and the Astronaut Hall of Fame.\n\nQUOTE: “If we want scientists and engineers in the future, we should be cultivating the girls as much as the boys.”\n\nSally died of pancreatic cancer in 2012.\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nIsabella Lucy Bird 1831-1904\n\nExplorer and Writer\n\nIsabella Lucy Bird was born in Yorkshire, England. From early childhood Bird was frail, suffering from a spinal complaint, nervous headaches, and insomnia.\n\nIn 1854, the doctors urged a sea voyage to improve her health and her life of traveling began. Bird accompanied her cousins to the United States and wrote bright descriptive letters home, which became the basis for her first book, An Englishwoman in America. She was to become an explorer, writer, photographer, and naturalist.\n\nBird traveled to Australia and Hawaii, which prompted her second book. She then moved to Colorado. Her letters to her sister were printed in the magazine The Leisure World and comprised her fourth and perhaps most famous book, A Lady’s Life in the Rocky Mountains.\n\nShe traveled to Asia, India, Tibet, and Persia. Featured in journals and magazines for decades, Bird became a household name. In 1890, she became the first woman to be awarded the Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society and two years later was the first woman allowed to join the Royal Geographical Society. She was elected a member of the Royal Photographic Society.\n\nHer final great journeys took place in 1897 when she traveled up the Yangtze and Han rivers in China and Korea followed by a trip to Morocco where she traveled among the Berbers. She had to use a ladder to mount her black stallion, a gift from the Sultan.\n\nA few months after returning, Bird fell ill and died at her home in Edinburgh.\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nHedy Lamarr 1914-2000\n\nAmerican Actress and Inventor\n\nMost people know Hedy Lamarr as an actress but when you mention she was actually an inventor people are shocked.\n\nShe was born in Vienna and by the age of 16, dropped out of high school and started acting. When she was 19 years old, she married for the first time. Hedy ended up marrying six times and had three children.\n\nWhen WWII, started, she wanted to quit acting and help the war effort using her knowledge of munitions and secret weapons, learned from her first husband who was an arms dealer. She wanted to join the National Inventors Council but was told by an inventor, Charles Kettering, that she would be more helpful with the war effort, as a celebrity selling war bonds.\n\nWith George Antheil, she helped develop radio guidance system for Allied torpedoes, using frequency-hopping technology to defeat the threat of jamming by the axis powers. It is a technique of conducting radio signals by quickly switching a carrier among many frequency channels, using a pseudo random sequence known to both transmitter and receiver.\n\nThe two shared a patent for an invention that prevented radio signals being intercepted by the enemy. She received a patent in 1942 for technology that remains fundamental to every cell phone, Bluetooth device, and Wi-Fi network in use today. It wasn’t until the 1990s that she was properly recognized for this. She always said “Any girl can be glamorous, all you have to do is stand there and look stupid.”\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nCleopatra 69BC-30BC\n\nEgyptian Pharaoh\n\nCleopatra VII was born in early 69 BC and was the last active ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt. From her childhood tutor she learned the Greek arts of oration and philosophy.\n\nHer native language was Koine Greek and she was the first Ptolemaic ruler to learn the Egyptian language. Aside from Greek, Egyptian, and Latin, she learned many other languages, which reflected Cleopatra's desire to restore North African and West Asian territories that once belonged to the Ptolemaic Kingdom.\n\nCleopatra ruled as an absolute monarch, serving as the sole lawgiver of her kingdom. She was the chief religious authority, presiding over ceremonies dedicated to the deities of both the Egyptian and Greek polytheistic faiths. She oversaw the construction of temples to Egyptian and Greek gods, a synagogue for the Jews in Egypt, and built the Caesareum of Alexandria.\n\nCleopatra was directly involved in the administrative affairs of her domain, tackling crises such as famine by ordering royal granaries to distribute food to the starving populace during a drought. Her government attempted to impose price controls, tariffs, and state monopolies for certain goods. It set fixed exchange rates for foreign currencies, and rigid laws forcing peasant farmers to stay in their villages during planting and harvesting seasons.\n\nCleopatra's legacy survives in ancient and modern works of art. Her ancient depictions include Roman, Renaissance, Baroque, and Ptolemaic coinage, Roman sculptures, busts, and paintings, as well as reliefs and cameo glass and carvings.\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nClara Barton 1821-1912\n\nAmerican Red Cross Founder\n\nClara Barton was born in 1821 in Massachusetts.

The son of Emperor Justin I, Justinian sought to marry her and in 525 he repealed the law preventing anyone of senatorial rank from marrying actresses.\n\nWhen Justinian succeeded to the throne in 527, Theodora became Empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. Justinian called her his “Partner in my deliberations.” She had her own court, her own entourage, and her own imperial seal.\n\nJustinian and Theodora rebuilt and reformed Constantinople and made it the most splendid city the world had seen for centuries. Theodora participated in Justinian’s legal and spiritual reforms and her involvement to increase the rights of women was substantial. She had laws passed that prohibited forced prostitution and she was known for buying girls, freeing them, and providing for their future. She created a convent for ex-prostitutes, closed brothels, instituted the death penalty for rape, and expanded the rights of women in divorce and property ownership.\n\nTheodora worked against her husband’s support of Chalcedonian Christianity and sheltered and hid many Miaphysite leaders for years.

During the Battle of Beijing, the entire imperial court evacuated to Xi’an as the allied forces invaded the city.\n\nAfter the fall of the city, the Eight-Nation Alliance negotiated a treaty with the Qing government, and sent messages to Cixi in Xi’an. Cixi decided that the terms were generous enough for her to acquiesce and stop the war.\n\nIn 1902, the whole court made a ceremonial return to Beijing, where Cixi implemented sweeping reforms. She sent high officials to Japan and Europe to gather facts and draw up plans for sweeping administrative reforms.\n\nIronically, Cixi sponsored the implementation of the New Polices, a program more radical than the one proposed by the reformers she had beheaded in 1898.\n\nShe died in 1908 in Beijing.

It is believed she was an incarnation of Dorje Phagmo and was chosen by Guru Padmasambhava to help establish the Buddhist teachings in Tibet. She is considered an enlightened figure who intentionally took birth to benefit beings. She is also viewed as a role model for those seeking enlightenment, especially through the tantric path. Her life story recounts her very tangible struggles on the path and her ultimate victory—overcoming dualistic thought and compassionately benefiting countless beings. As a teacher, she used her own life story to instruct and nurture her disciples so they could learn how to attain their own enlightenment.\n\nOn an abstract level, Yeshe Tsogyal represents the enlightened feminine. Her archetype is that of the heroine who fuses the absolute and the relative into a seamless enlightened existence. In the Mother Essence Lineage, Yeshe Tsogyal and her incarnations and emanations are of primary importance, because she is the Mother of Vision, and therefore the Mother of non-dual experience. Although Yeshe Tsogyal is often referred to as Guru Rinpoche’s consort, the two are in fact simultaneous manifestations of the integrated principles of skillful means and sublime knowing.\n\nAn example of her teaching: “When you understand the dualistic mind, there will be no separation from me.

When Marie's mother died, the fourteen-year-old found herself in charge of the household, and the family moved to Nancy, where she remained for the rest of her life.\n\nHer father was a local billiards and swimming champion. He shared his love of sports with Marie. By the age of four, she could swim 4 kilometers. She grew to also enjoy many other sports. In 1890, at the age of 15, she canoed over 400 kilometers from Nancy to Koblenz, Germany.

While in Morocco, she came up with the idea of using metal skis for air ambulances so that they could land on desert sand.\n\nIn World War II, she resumed work as a Red Cross nurse with the rank of corporal and she continued her promotion of the ambulance-airplane. Marie also founded and maintained a home for wounded aviators.\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nLise Meitner 1878-1968\n\nAustrian Physicist\n\nLise Meitner was born November 7, 1878 in Vienna Austria-Hungary. She loved math and science and at age 8 recorded her earliest research in a notebook kept under her pillow. She was particularly interested in studying the colors of an oil slick, thin films and reflected light. She became the second woman to obtain a doctoral degree in physics at the University of Vienna in 1905.\n\nAs a physicist, Meitner worked on radioactivity and nuclear physics. Otto Hahn, Otto Robert Frisch and Lise led a small group of scientists who first discovered nuclear fission of uranium when it absorbed an extra neutron. Their research helped to pioneer nuclear reactors to generate electricity as well as the development of nuclear weapons during World War II.\n\nMeitner spent most of her career as a physics professor in Berlin. She was the first woman to become a full professor of physics in Germany. In the 1930s, she lost her position because of the anti-Jewish Nuremberg Laws of Nazi Germany. In 1938 she fled to Sweden and became a Swedish citizen.\n\nMeitner received many awards and honors late in her life but the 1944 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for nuclear fission was awarded exclusively to her long-time collaborator Otto Hahn. Several scientists and journalists have called her exclusion unjust. In 1992 the scientific community posthumously honored Lise by naming the chemical element 109 meitnerium after her.\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nIndira Gandhi 1917-1984\n\nIndian Prime Minister\n\nIndira Priyararshini Gandhi was born November 19, 1917 and was the daughter of Jawaharial Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India.

That resulted in an Indian victory and the creation of Bangladesh as well as increasing India’s influence to the point where it became the regional hegemon of South Asia. In a response to a call for revolution, she instituted a state of emergency from 1975 to 1977 where basic civil liberties were suspended and the press was censored. Widespread atrocities were carried out during the emergency. In 1980, she returned to power after free elections, but was assassinated by two of her bodyguards and Sikh nationalists in 1984.\n\nIn 1999, Indira Gandhi was named “Woman of the Millennium” in an online poll organized by the BBC.\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nGrace Hopper 1906-1992\n\nComputer Scientist\n\nGrace Brewster Murray Hopper was born in New Your City on December 9, 1906.

Maya was active in the Civil Rights Movement and worked with Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcom X. Dr. King asked Angelou to become the northern coordinator for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.\n\nJimmy Carter appointed Maya to the Commission for International Woman of the Year. “To know her life story is to simultaneously wonder what on earth you have been doing with your own life and feel glad that you didn’t have to go through half the things she has.”\n\nQuote: “I always wear a hat or a very tightly pulled tie when I write. I suppose I hope by doing that I will keep my brains from seeping out of my scalp and running in great gray blobs down my neck, into my ears, and over my face.”\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nLeona Woods 1919-1986\n\nScientist\n\nLeona graduated from high school at 14 and earned her degree in physics from the University of Chicago when she was 18.\n\nAfter passing her qualifying exams in chemistry, she went to work for Robert Mulliken.

She was a strong advocate of food irradiation as a means of killing harmful bacteria.\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nBeatrix Potter 1866-1943\n\nWriter and Scientist\n\nBorn into an upper middle class household, Potter was educated by governesses and grew up isolated from other children. She had numerous pets and spent holidays in Scotland and the Lake District, developing a love of landscape, flora, and fauna, all of which she closely observed and painted.\n\nAs was common in the Victorian era, women of her class were privately educated and rarely went to university. However, her study and watercolors of fungi led to her being widely respected in the field of mycology. In her thirties, Potter self-published the highly successful children's book The Tale of Peter Rabbit. Following this, she began writing and illustrating children's books full-time.\n\nBeatrix Potter was interested in every branch of natural science save astronomy. Potter was eclectic in her tastes: collecting fossils, studying archeological artifacts from London excavations, and pursued entomology. In all these areas she drew and painted her specimens with increasing skill. By the 1890’s, her scientific interests centered on mycology.\n\nPotter was also a canny businesswoman. She made and patented a Peter Rabbit doll, followed by other \"spinoff\" merchandise over the years, including painting books, board games, wallpaper, figurines, baby blankets, and China tea sets.\n\nShe continued to write and illustrate until diminishing eyesight made it difficult to continue. In all, Potter wrote thirty books. She died of complications from pneumonia and heart disease in1943 at Castle Cottage. She left nearly all her property and her book illustrations to the National Trust.\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nIda Wells 1862-1931\n\nAdvocate and Suffragist\n\nWells was one of the founders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.

When Wells refused to give up her seat, the conductor and two men dragged her out of the car. She eventually lost her court case.\n\nSoon she co-owned the Memphis Free Speech and Headlight newspaper. Wells’ news reporting covered racial segregation and exposed lynching as a barbaric practice. A white mob destroyed her newspaper office and presses.\n\nIn 1891, the Memphis Board of Education dismissed Wells from her teaching post because her articles criticized conditions in the black schools of the region.\n\nWells married, had a family, and continued to work. She was extremely active in women’s rights and the women’s suffrage movement. Ida established several notable women’s organizations such as the National Afro American Council. She also worked alongside Josephine St Pierre Ruffin and Harriet Tubman who helped found the National Association of Colored Women’s Clubs.\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nJunko Tabei 1939-2016\n\nJapanese Mountaineer\n\nIshibashi Junko was born September 22, 1939 in Fukushima, Japan. She was considered a frail, weak child but nevertheless began mountain climbing at the age of 10, going on a class-climbing trip to Mount Nasu. Although she was interested in doing more climbing, it was an expensive hobby so Tabei made only a few more climbs during her high school years.\n\nFrom 1958 to 1962, Tabei studied at Showa Women’s University where she joined the mountain climbing club. She also married another climber named Masanobu Takei and they had two children. She also formed the company, Ladies’ Climbing Club: Japan in 1969 with a slogan “Let’s go on an overseas expedition by ourselves.” During this time she climbed Mount Fuji and the Matterhorn.\n\nBy 1975, Tabei’s company formed a team known, as the Japanese Women’s Everest Expedition comprised of 15 members. She helped find sponsors and the team began the expedition early in May. Camping at 6,300 meters, the group was struck by an avalanche and was buried under the snow. Tabei lost consciousness for approximately six minutes until her Sherpa guide dug her out. Twelve days later, on May 16th, with her Sherpa, Tabei became the first woman to reach the summit of Everest.\n\nBy 1991, Tabei became the first woman to complete the “Seven Summits.” In addition to climbing, she focused on the environmental degradation of Everest caused by the waste left behind by climbing groups and preserving mountain environments. She led and participated in “cleanup” climbs in Japan and the Himalayas.\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nCarrie Chapman Catt 1859-1947\n\nSuffrage Leader\n\nCatt was a key coordinator of the woman suffrage movement and a skillful political strategist.

To this day, the Olympics do not offer an equal slate of men and women's sports. However, Milliat's pressure greatly expanded women’s representation at the Olympics.\n\nIn a 1934 interview, Milliat said: \"Women's sports of all kinds are handicapped in my country by the lack of playing space. As we have no vote, we cannot make our needs publicly felt, or bring pressure to bear in the right quarters. I always tell my girls that the vote is one of the things they will have to work for if France is to keep its place with the other nations in the realm of feminine sport.\"\n\nIn 1920, Milliat assembled a football (Soccer) team of women from Paris who toured the UK and played on behalf of France in the world’s first internationally recognized women’s football tournament.\n\nIn 1934, Milliat spoke to an interviewer from the women's magazine \"Independent Woman.\" In her statement, she advocated for women's suffrage in France. She believed women's suffrage would lead to greater support for women's sports.\n\nSource Wikipedia\n\nAmelia Earhart 1897-1937\n\nAviatrix and member of Zonta\n\nAmelia was an American aviation pioneer and author.

She returned to Philadelphia and in 1923, married George Eustis.\n\nShortly after their wedding, the couple rented a chalet in the Swiss Alps and started breeding German shepherds to work as police dogs. To help them with their project, they hired Elliot \"Jack\" Humphrey, a self-taught geneticist and animal trainer. She founded The Seeing Eye, Inc., the first dog guide school for the blind in the United States. Humphrey would later be instrumental in developing the method for training dogs, as well as students, at The Seeing Eye.\n\nFor the first three years of its existence, The Seeing Eye had no permanent facility, so trainers traveled to different cities to hold their classes. In 1931, Eustis purchased a ten-bedroom mansion in Whippany, New Jersey with enough room to house students while they were learning to work with their dogs. The school relocated to a newly constructed, and more user-friendly facility in Morristown in 1966.\n\nEustis continued to play an active role in the affairs of The Seeing Eye until 1940, when she resigned as president and took on the role of a member of the board of trustees.
