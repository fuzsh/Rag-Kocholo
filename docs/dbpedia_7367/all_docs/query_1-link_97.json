This is FC Barcelona’s home ground this football season due to works in progress at the Camp Nou. It is widely acknowledged that sport has had a positive impact on the city over the last three decades.\n\nThe last two winners of La Vuelta, Primoz Roglic in 2019, 2020 and 2021 and Remco Evenepoel in 2022, are the reigning Olympic and world champions for time trial. Their duel in this speciality, in Valladolid on 5 September, has connoisseurs salivating in anticipation, but the mileage (25) suggests that “Pucela” (the nickname of the city of Castilla y León) won’t necessarily determine the winner of La Roja (the red leader’s jersey) in Plaza de Cibeles in Madrid on 17 September, given that the mountains to follow are conducive to hard-fought battles.\n\nOnce again, this year’s La Vuelta explores some unusual difficulties. Five of the ten summit finishes are unprecedented: Arinsal, in Andorra (stage 3, after the Ordino pass that requires the protagonists to be in top condition from the beginning), Caravaca de la Cruz, in the Murcia region (stage 9), Larra-Belagua, in Navarra (stage 14), Bejes, in Cantabria (stage 16), and La Cruz de Linares, in Asturias (stage 18). But the two highlights of the route are legendary venues in cycling: the Col du Tourmalet in France and the Alto de l’Angliru. They were already supposed to form the two major stages of La Vuelta 20 until the French authorities closed the roads to the race in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. This time, they are separated by five days, on 8 and 13 September (stages 13 and 17).\n\nThe Tourmalet is the most visited pass by the Tour de France: 80 times, since the first passage through the Pyrenees in 1910. Norway’s Tobias Halland Johannessen was first up there last month. Jonas Vingegaard took the Maillot Jaune for good on those slopes, leading the group of the favourites at the summit on stage 6, but La Vuelta is taking the route in the opposite direction, on the western versant from Luz-Saint-Sauveur. At the top is the stele of Jacques Goddet, the historic boss of the Grande Boucle, and there’s a statue of a naked cyclist known as “the giant”. In the 1960s, this was the favourite pass of Federico Martín Bahamontes, the first Spanish Tour de France winner, who recently died at the age of 95. Before La Vuelta 23, the Tour de France Femmes avec Zwift also installed a finish line at the summit of the Tourmalet, which crowned Dutchwoman Demi Vollering.\n\nWhile the legendary pass in the French department of Hautes-Pyrénées is steeped in history, the Alto de l’Angliru in Asturias is a marker of modernity in cycling. While the slopes of the Tourmalet are regular, especially on the western versant, those of the Angliru require changes of pace. On the first three visits by La Vuelta, in 1999, 2000 and 2002, the maximum gradients of 23.5% at Cueña les Cabres seemed monstrous. Since then, technological advances firstly experienced in mountain biking have made the riding more accessible. It’s where Alberto Contador won his very first and very last stage on La Vuelta (in 2008 and 2017). Hugh Carthy, in 2020, became the eighth and last Angliru stage winner to date. Roglic, the eventual overall winner, had momentarily lost La Roja, which enables pure climbers to start with the highest ambitions this year.\n\nThe great equation for La Vuelta 23 is therefore whether it will be won at the Tourmalet and defended at the Angliru, or vice versa. More subtly, it will be up to the contenders for overall victory not to lose at the Tourmalet and then to impose their leadership in Asturias, not only at the Angliru but also the following day, with the double ascent of Puerto de la Cruz de Linares. But beware, La Vuelta always has one last trick up its sleeve. On the eve of the grand finale in the Spanish capital, no fewer than ten climbs are listed in the Sierra de Guadarrama over an unusual distance of more than 200 kilometres, making it the longest stage of the race. It’s reminiscent of the penultimate stage in Galicia in 2021, just the right thing for a last-minute twist!\n\nMore information about La Vuelta 23: www.lavuelta.es.\n\n*** You can see the PEZ ‘Vuelta a España Route Preview’ HERE. ***\n\nRenewi Tour 2023\n\nJasper Philipsen won the Opening Stage 1 of the 2023 Renewi Tour. The first stage of the renamed Benelux Tour ended after 180 kilometres in a bunch sprint in Ardooie, where the Alpecin-Deceuninck sprinter was clearly the best. Tim Merlier (Soudal Quick-Step) finished second and Olav Kooij (Jumbo-Visma) third. Philipsen is also the first overall leader.\n\nThe first stage of the Renewi Tour went from the coastal town of Blankenberge to Ardooie. At the finish there were five local laps of about 16 kilometres. In the Green Kilometre (formerly known as the Golden Kilometre) there were three bonus sprints.\n\nBingoal WB had Ludovic Robeet and Ceriel Desal in the ‘break of the day’. The two Belgians were accompanied by Alessandro Covi (UAE Team Emirates), Jonas Rutsch (EF Education-EasyPost) and Aaron Van Poucke (Team Flanders-Baloise). Their lead was just over 3 minutes, but then fluctuated around 1:30. It looked like the peloton would catch the leading group too early, but the five escapees were given some time and came onto the local circuit in Ardooie with a bigger lead. It was Tim Declercq who did the chase work for Soudal Quick-Step, but Jumbo-Visma, Alpecin-Deceuninck and Jayco AlUla were also at the front. In the leading group, Van Poucke was dropped 40 kilometres from the finish, shortly after the intermediate sprint. Desal, Covi and Rutsch stayed off the front the longest, although the peloton came very close with the Green Kilometre in sight. The Italian took the first sprint 2 seconds and then pulled away from the other two, taking a total of 8 bonus seconds.\n\nAlpecin-Deceuninck then took control and pulled in the escapees, but there were more sprinter’s teams getting involved in the final, due to the roads being a bit narrow. Lotto Dstny and dsm-firmenich came to the front. The nervousness caused Sam Welsford to crash less than 2 kilometres from the finish, which split the peloton. In the last kilometre the battle was for the best positioning. Arnaud De Lie had the best lead-out, but he had Jasper Philipsen on his wheel and had no answer to the speed of the Tour de France green jersey winner. Tim Merlier came up on the right for second place. Olav Kooij started his sprint too late and was third. De Lie was fourth and Dylan Groenewegen fifth. Philipsen is also the overall leader.\n\nStage winner and overall leader, Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck): “It was hectic, I noticed that a few laps in advance. But I was held in good position and that was the key to success today. It was a fun battle. Arnaud had Jasper De Buyst in front of him, and I had Jonas Rickaert who did a super good job. Before that I also had some experienced guys riding for me. Then it is nice that I can finish it like this. I had to make quick decisions, today went well. It was quite a technical sprint and the finish has also changed a bit here. Positioning is also very important. I haven’t been on a time trial bike since the Tour de France, so that will be very difficult.”\n\nRenewi Tour Stage 1 Result:\n\n1. Jasper Philipsen (Bel) Alpecin-Deceuninck in 3:51:33\n\n2.

The British sprinter of Soudal Quick-Step turned out to be more than a second faster than Mads Pedersen on the 2.2 kilometre course. Maikel Zijlaard and Danny van Poppel were both briefly in the hot seat, but ended up in third and fourth place.\n\nThe Deutschland Tour started in historic Sankt Wendel with a short prologue of 2.2 kilometres through the center. The course was flat and had five turns.\n\nThe first times set showed that the course suited the sprinters. Danny van Poppel took the hot seat with a time of 2:26, at an average speed of 56.4 kph. Sam Bennett, Marco Haller, Alex Kirsch and Rick Pluimers also went under 2.30. Rasmus Tiller was more than 1 second short of Van Poppel’s top time, while Jannik Steimle was only 41 hundredths behind the Dutchman. The first rider who bettered Van Poppel’s time was Maikel Zijlaard of Tudor, who was 42 hundredths faster.\n\nSo far it was all about fractions of a second, but then Ethan Vernon came in more than two seconds faster than Zijlaard’s time. The British rider’s time of 2:23 was too fast for man-in-form Mads Pedersen, who was just over 1 second faster than Vernon. Nils Politt and Brandon McNulty were also slower than Vernon.\n\nStage winner and overall leader, Ethan Vernon (Soudal Quick-Step): “It was a really good day. I came here from the Worlds, where I competed on the track, and I’m happy to see the form continues to be there. I went full gas from the start, found the right pacing and I am incredibly delighted with the outcome, especially as I wasn’t expecting a win today. We have more goals here as a team, we want to do a good general classification and we’ll try to give our best in the next stages.”\n\nDeutschland Tour Prologue Result:\n\n1.

Reef: “Vingegaard and Roglic will start the race both as our leaders. Roglic had an excellent preparation with a rest after the Giro and then altitude training followed by the Tour of Burgos. Vingegaard took a break after winning the Tour but then started training again, and the signals we got from him are also very good. The big goal is for one of them to reach Madrid in the red jersey.”\n\nKuss and Kelderman will support them on the climbs. It will be Kuss’ third grand tour of the season, while Kelderman has already ridden the Tour de France. “Both were very important during the Giro and the Tour”, Reef says. “We followed them up well after the Tour. Kuss crashed in the final of the Tour de France, but he recovered quicker than expected. After a period of rest, both Kuss and Kelderman have been able to resume training, and we think they are ready. Their role will be similar to their role in the Tour.”\n\nVan Baarle is also doing the Tour-Vuelta double, while Valter, Tratnik and Gesink, along with Roglic, were already in full preparation for the Vuelta a España while the Tour de France was still going on. “All four of them have their specific qualities, but above all, they are incredibly versatile. They can hold their own both on the flat and in the mountains. They will be essential throughout the Tour, starting with the team time trial in Barcelona.”\n\nUAE Team Emirates announces squad for Vuelta España\n\nAlmeida and Ayuso lead quality team\n\nUAE Team Emirates have named 8 riders for the final Grand Tour of the year – La Vuelta España.\n\nThe race will depart from Barcelona on the 26th August before concluding in Madrid three weeks later in Madrid on September 17th over a total course distance of 3157km.\n\nThe team goes into the race with a double-pronged attack on the GC with two proven Grand Tour riders at the helm. Juan Ayuso, the revelation of last years Vuelta who went on to finish 3rd in his Grand Tour debut and Joao Almeida, who podiumed at this years Giro d’Italia, will both team up with sights set on the top step of the podium.\n\nSebastian Molano comes into the race in form following his stage victory at Vuelta Burgos and will be backed in the sprints by the skill and expertise of the Oliveira brothers. The trio of Marc Soler, Jay Vine and Finn Fisher Black form a formidable climbing block with Fisher Black making his debut in a Grand Tour.\n\nAyuso: “Last years Vuelta was something special, a race I’ll always remember and it gave me a lot of confidence. We’ve been putting in a lot of work together the past months as a group and it’s gone really well. The route this year will be passing close to where I grew up or lived, so personally that will make it extra special too. As for the competition it’s going to be tough no doubt with some big rivals on the start-list but I feel we’re up to the challenge. Going in like we did last year with two leaders worked out as an advantage so I think it’s a good strategy. We can’t wait to get the racing started.”\n\nAlmeida: “The sensations are good. I feel I’m stronger than I was this time last year. I think Juan has also improved so we’re in a really good place. Last year at the Vuelta was already quite a success for us so we’re going back to aim for the same or more. We had two guys on the podium at the Tour so why not at the Vuelta too? It could be really nice.”\n\nSports Manager Joxean Matxin Fernandez (Spa) along with Sports Directors Tomas Gil (Ven) and Manuele Mori (Ita) will lead the following 8 riders:\n\nLa Vuelta Ciclista a España [2.UWT] – 26-Aug-2023 / 17-Sep-2023\n\nJoao Almeida (Por)\n\nJuan Ayuso (Spa)\n\nFinn Fisher-Black (NZ)\n\nSebastian Molano (Col)\n\nIvo Oliveira (Por) now Domen Novak (Slo)\n\nRui Oliveira (Por)\n\nMarc Soler (Spa)\n\nJay Vine (Aus).\n\nUAE Emirates is Forced to Replace a Sick Ivo Oliveira\n\nUAE Emirates had already announced the selection for the Vuelta a España 2023, but had to make a change just days in advance. Ivo Oliveira is ill and not fit enough to start in Barcelona on Saturday.\n\nDomen Novak has been called up as a replacement for the Portuguese rider. The Slovenian, who was national champion in 2019 and was close to a stage victory in the Giro d’Italia last year, will start the third Vuelta of his career. In 2017 and 2019, Novak was also at the start of the Vuelta a España, when he rode for Bahrain Victorious. Novak will be working for two leaders, João Almeida and Juan Ayuso, in the Vuelta.\n\nSoudal Quick-Step to the Vuelta a España\n\nRemco Evenepoel is ready to lead the team at the 78th edition of the race he won last year\n\nThe last Grand Tour of the season is just a few days away, and Barcelona – the city of Antoni Gaudi and his fantastic works inspired by nature – will host the start of the race for just the second time in history. Not a road stage, as was the case in 1962, but a team time trial will kick off proceedings this weekend, but its impact on the final outcome will be insignificant, and that’s because the three weeks will feature a total of ten uphill finishes.\n\nArinsal, Xorret de Cati, Javalambre, the mighty Col du Tourmalet, Larra-Belagua, Angliru and its brutal gradients, and Bejes are just some of the many hurdles the peloton will face on their road to Madrid. Add to these a 25km individual time trial in Valladolid and an insane up-and-down course on the penultimate day, and the overall picture is that of an incredibly hard edition of the Vuelta a España.\n\nRemco Evenepoel, who wrote history for Belgium and Soudal Quick-Step last year when he arrived in Madrid with the prestigious red jersey in his possession, is back at the start, his confidence buoyed by a spectacular season that has seen him win, among others, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, Clasica San Sebastian and the ITT World Championships.\n\n“It will be quite special to return at La Vuelta with bib number one on my back and the beautiful Belgian Champion jersey on my shoulders, in what will be my first outing since conquering it in late June.”\n\n“Spain is one of my favourite countries, I’ve always felt good and had a lot of success there, and hopefully the trend will continue over the next weeks. If you look over the course and the start list, you can see it’s going to be a very tough race, but I had a good preparation and can rely on a strong squad, so I have a lot of confidence and motivation ahead of the many challenges that will come”, explained the fourth-youngest rider to win the Spanish Grand Tour.\n\nThe reigning champion – who sits on ten victories since the start of the year – will be joined in Barcelona by a solid Soudal Quick-Step squad consisting of Andrea Bagioli, Mattia Cattaneo, Jan Hirt, James Knox, Casper Pedersen, Pieter Serry and Louis Vervaeke.\n\n“We have a well-balanced team for this last Grand Tour of the year, comprising strong guys for the climbs, but also riders who can protect Remco on the flat and put him in a good position ahead of the climbs. We hope to have a good start in Barcelona, then we will continue taking it day by day and see how things pan out, especially as after the first couple of stages we will know more about our form and that of our opponents. We are motivated and looking forward to what we hope will be three strong weeks in Spain”, said sports director Klaas Lodewyck.\n\n26.08–17.09 La Vuelta Ciclista a España (ESP) 2.UWT:\n\nRiders:\n\nAndrea Bagioli (ITA)\n\nMattia Cattaneo (ITA)\n\nRemco Evenepoel (BEL)\n\nJan Hirt (CZE)\n\nJames Knox (GBR)\n\nCasper Phillip Pedersen (DEN)\n\nPieter Serry (BEL)\n\nLouis Vervaeke (BEL)\n\nSports Director: Iljo Keisse (BEL), Klaas Lodewyck (BEL) and Geert Van Bondt (BEL).\n\nRemco Evenepoel is ready for la Vuelta:\n\nAlpecin-Deceuninck Present Vuelta Team\n\nAlpecin-Deceuninck has announced their selection for the Vuelta a España. The Belgian WorldTeam leaves World champion Mathieu van der Poel at home, but has a strong sprinter in Kaden Groves. The rest of the team are attackers.\n\nAlpecin-Deceuninck goes to Barcelona with several debutants to a Grand Tour. Former rower Jason Osborne is one of them, as are mountain bike World champion Samuel Gaze, track champion Robbe Ghys and Maurice Ballerstedt. Leader Groves, Edward Planckaert, Jimmy Janssens and Tobias Bayer have all ridden a Grand Tour.\n\nThe big goal of the team is to win a stage of la Vuelta. If they succeed, Alpecin-Deceuninck will have won at least one stage in all the Grand Tours since the Giro d’Italia of 2021. Most eyes will be on Kaden Groves, who is starting his second Grand Tour in his first year with Alpecin-Deceuninck. He also rode the Giro and won the stage to Salerno, although he didn’t finish in Rome. Groves won the 11th stage of the Vuelta last year for BikeExchange-Jayco.\n\nAlpecin-Deceuninck Vuelta 2023 Riders:\n\nMaurice Ballerstedt (Ger)\n\nTobias Bayer (Aust)\n\nSamuel Gaze (NZ)\n\nRobbe Ghys (Bel)\n\nKaden Groves (Aus)\n\nJimmy Janssens (Bel)\n\nJason Osborne (Ger)\n\nEdward Planckaert (Bel).\n\nAnother stage for Groves:\n\nVuelta a España (August 26 – September 17)\n\nThe victim of a fractured right scaphoid following his crash during the 4th stage of the Critérium du Dauphiné on June 7, Geoffrey Bouchard will return to competition after 80 days during the Vuelta a España. The climber from the AG2R CITROËN TEAM won the King of the Mountains classification in the 2019 edition.\n\nJulien Jurdie: “We arrive at the start of the Vuelta a España with a talented team full of ambition. The number 1 objective will be to win stages. We’d love to take a victory again this year in each of the three Grand Tours, which is something we have succeeded in doing in 2006 and 2021. Already this year, Aurélien Paret-Peintre took a stage at the Giro d’Italia and Felix Gall at the Tour de France, making the three-for-three goal within reach. Now it’s up to us! The route of this 78th edition will encourage aggressive racing. You will have to be bold and opportunistic to slip into the breakaways and take the victory.”\n\nJulien Jurdie, directeur sportif of the AG2R CITROËN TEAM, presents the eight riders who make up the squad at the start of the Vuelta 2023.\n\nGeoffrey Bouchard\n\n31 years old / 1 professional victory\n\n3rd participation\n\nBest results: 14th general classification (2021), winner of the King of the Mountains classification 2019\n\n“Geoffrey won the race against time to be at the start after his crash in the Critérium du Dauphiné on June 7 where he fractured his scaphoid. He will be looking for revenge at this Vuelta a España. Obviously, he won’t be 100% ready for the Grand Depart in Barcelona, but he will gain strength as the days go by and I am convinced that he will be a player in the mountain stages.”\n\nMikaël Cherel\n\n37 years old\n\n7th participation\n\nBest result: 4th in a stage (2015)\n\n“Mikael will retire at the end of this Vuelta a España. It will inevitably be a special moment for him, as well as for the entire AG2R CITROËN TEAM. He will be our road captain. His role will be very valuable in supervising the rest of the squad and channeling emotions where they’ll be most effective. He will also have the opportunity to play his personal card in breakaways. It would be a huge satisfaction to see him take a victory in the last race of his career.”\n\nDorian Godon\n\n27 years old / 7 professional victories\n\n3rd participation\n\nBest result: 3rd in a stage (2019)\n\n“Dorian is a rider full of character. He bounced back well after his non-selection for the Tour de France. His burst of speed will be very valuable when going for a stage win. He is a thinking rider and knows how to win races. He proved it again this season by winning the Flèche Brabançonne.”\n\nPaul Lapeira\n\n23 years old\n\n1st participation\n\n“Paul has taken a string of impressive places of honour over the past few weeks. He is an aggressive rider and reads the race well. He has already proven that at the Giro d’Italia this year when he took the King of the Mountains jersey. With his burst of speed, he could win a stage if he comes to the line with a small group.”\n\nNicolas Prodhomme\n\n26 years old\n\n3rd participation\n\nBest result: 9th place in a stage (2021)\n\n“Nicolas replaces Jaakko Hanninën who unfortunately fractured his left collarbone during the Vuelta a Burgos. He has been in very good condition since the beginning of August. He proved it by finishing on the podium in the Tour de l’Ain and then by riding strongly at the Vuelta a Burgos. His qualities as a climber will be very valuable in trying to win a stage.”\n\nDamien Touzé\n\n27 years old\n\n3rd participation\n\nBest result: 11th in a stage (2021)\n\n“Damien knows the Vuelta a España well. He is a rider who knows how to turn himself inside out for his team with his sense of sacrifice. He has proven it since the start of the season by being devoted to his leaders in every race. He will provide valuable support to guide Dorian Godon and Andrea Vendrame in the sprint finishes. He will also have the opportunity to play his card on certain stages.”\n\nAndrea Vendrame\n\n29 years old / 4 professional victories\n\n2nd participation\n\n“Andrea has already proven that he knows how to win a stage at a Grand Tour. He is a rider with many assets. He has a burst of speed that allows him to mingle in the bunch sprints, but he is also one of the very best puncheurs in the peloton. He prepared for this Vuelta very carefully.”\n\nLarry Warbasse\n\n33 years old / 2 professional victories\n\n3rd participation\n\nBest result: 8th stage (2015)\n\n“Larry will be, along with Mikael Cherel, our road captain. He is a rider who climbs very well. He prepared for this Vuelta a España by going to an altitude training camp. He’s arriving at the start in very good condition. He will have his card to play in the mountain stages by slipping into the breakaways. His knowledge of grand tours will be a major asset.”\n\nMikael Cherel will retire after the Vuelta a España\n\nMikael Cherel will retire at the end of the Vuelta a España. The AG2R CITROËN TEAM member (37 years old) will take part in the nineteenth Grand Tour of his career (7 participations in the Tour de France, 7 in the Vuelta a España and 5 in the Giro d’Italia).\n\nPaul Lapeira will be the only rider from the AG2R CITROËN TEAM to be racing his first Vuelta a España at this 78th edition. This season, he also took part in the Giro d’Italia, wearing the King of the Mountains jersey for one day, before being forced to retire.\n\nTeam Jayco AlUla name young and hungry roster for La Vuelta a España\n\nTeam Jayco AlUla have announced a young and hungry squad for the final Grand Tour of the season, La Vuelta a España, starting on Saturday 26th August in Barcelona.\n\nIrishman Eddie Dunbar and Giro d’Italia stage winners Filippo Zana and Matteo Sobrero will headline the Australian squad across the three weeks of racing, with the trio supported by an exciting mixture of youth and experience.\n\nReady For More\n\nLeading the team’s general classification fight will be Dunbar, with the 26-year-old keen to build on his seventh-place finish at this year’s Giro d’Italia, in what was his first Grand Tour as a team leader.\n\nTour of Slovenia winner Zana and recent Tour of Austria stage winner Sobrero will both be key support riders for Dunbar throughout the Spanish tour, but the pair will also be free to chase their own opportunities and hunt for stage victories.\n\nAustralian duo Michael Hepburn and Callum Scotson will add experience and horsepower to the eight-man squad, with both riders lining up for their second Grand Tour of the year after starting the Giro back in May.\n\nEddie Dunbar: “My training has been going good after Poland and I’ve been putting in a few finishing touches to my training and I’m looking forward to getting started in Barcelona.\n\nThe course is fairly difficult this year, I think on paper there can be 13 ‘GC days’, so it’s going to be intense all three weeks and you’re going to have to be switched on all the time. The stages look a bit shorter than the Giro, but like I said, I think it will be more intense racing with steeper climbs. The Tourmalet and L’Angliru will be decisive stages and it will be important to be ‘on it’ during those days.\n\nIt looks like a stacked GC field, it almost looks like the Tour de France, and it will be interesting to see how it is raced. I’ve only ever watched the Vuelta on TV, but it’s going to be a different race to the Giro I expect.\n\nFor me it’s just about going in and doing our best like we did at the Giro and we have a good squad to do that. The aim is to be there or thereabouts in the GC again, in the Giro it went pretty good, I was up there on the hard stages and if we can repeat that at the Vuelta and finish off a bit stronger, I think a good GC result can be on the cards for sure.”\n\nGrand Tour Debuts\n\nThe team will hand Grand Tour debuts to three riders, with Hagos Welay Berhe, Felix Engelhardt and Jan Maas all lining up for their first taste of a three-week tour. German Engelhardt and Ethiopian Berhe have already shown their potential in their first year as professionals with a host of standout performances to underline their raw abilities.\n\nDutchman Maas will be a valuable teammate across the 21 stages, with the 27-year-old set to play an important role in protecting the team leaders on both the flat and in the mountains.\n\nTough Start, Tougher Finish\n\nThe 2023 edition kicks off with a fast and intriguing team time trial around the streets of Barcelona that has the possibility to shake up the general classification contenders on the opening day. In true La Vuelta style, there is no easing into the race with only one classified ‘flat stage’ and three summit finishes before the first rest day as the peloton head to Andorra on day three to tackle the first summit finish.\n\nThere is no respite as action resumes on stage 10 with a time trial, before the race dips into France to take on the famous Col du Tourmalet on stage 13. More historic climbs await in the final week of racing with three testing stages in Asturias, including a summit finish of the formidable Altu de L’Angliru before the peloton eventually reaches the finale in Madrid.\n\nPieter Weening (Sport Director): “Our goal is to go for a strong general classification result with Eddie and for the rest of the guys we will look to send them up the road whenever there is an opportunity and we will look to give everyone a chance.\n\nAlready on stage three we have a mountain-top finish, so after three days of racing there will be a GC established and guys who are already minutes behind, so that gives a lot of riders, including our guys a lot of opportunities to go up the road. We will look to gamble on those days when the breakaway can stay away and those riders who don’t make the break will have the job of looking after and helping Eddie.\n\nI would say the hardest part of this Vuelta is the last eight or nine days. If you want to do a good GC it will all depend on how fresh you are in those last eight or nine stages.”\n\nTeam Jayco AlUla at La Vuelta a España:\n\nHagos Welay Berhe – (ETH) Debut appearance\n\nEddie Dunbar – (IRE) Debut appearance\n\nFelix Engelhardt – (GER) Debut appearance\n\nMichael Hepburn – (AUS) 2nd appearance\n\nJan Maas – (NED) Debut appearance\n\nCallum Scotson – (AUS) 3rd appearance\n\nMatteo Sobrero – (ITA) Debut appearance\n\nFilippo Zana – (ITA) Debut appearance\n\nTeam Jayco AlUla La Vuelta a España Stats:\n\nYoungest rider: Hagos Welay Berhe (21)\n\nOldest rider: Michael Hepburn (31)\n\nAverage age: 25.5\n\nLa Vuelta a España Debutants: 5\n\nMost La Vuelta a España Appearances: Callum Scotson (2x)\n\nTotal La Vuelta a España Appearances: 5.\n\nLanda and Buitrago Lead Bahrain Victorious Line-Up at La Vuelta a España\n\nA month after a very successful Tour de France, Team Bahrain Victorious will start the 78th edition of the last Grand Tour of the year – La Vuelta a España.\n\nThe race starts on the 26th of August with a 15km Team Time Trial in Barcelona and finishes on September 17th with a flat stage of 100km in the centre of Madrid. Between those stages, we’ll see 1 individual time trial, 3 more flat stages, 8 hilly stages, and 7 mountain stages. As Vuelta is known for its steep mountain finishes, this year’s route will not disappoint. There are 9 mountain top finishes, 5 of them first category, and 2 “hors” categories (Col du Tourmalet and Alto de L’Angliru). This is the first year after 2019 that La Vuelta is returning to the Pyrenees and will have 3 brutal mountaintop finishes (including the already mentioned Col du Tourmalet which is on the French side of the mountain range).\n\nThe first real test for the GC comes already on stage 3, with a Category 1 mountain finish as well as another Category 1 climb 20km prior, both across the border in Andorra. The GC could be shaken on stage 6 where another Category 1 mountaintop finish awaits. The toughest stage of the first week will come at stage 8 with 5 categorised climbs, with a Category 1 climb 3km from the finish line. The second week will start with a 25km individual Time Trial, which will only be an entree to the back-to-back stages in the Pyrenees, where the mountains will define who’s a contender for the final GC. The final filter of the GC battle will be fought on stages 17 and 18, where probably the toughest mountaintop finish of any grand tour awaits (Alto de L’Angliru) followed the day after with three Category 1 climbs, including the finish. The last 3 stages will see GC contenders trying to stay in the front group and not lose time all the way to the familiar circuit in Madrid where sprinters will battle for the final stage glory.\n\nHead Sports Director Neil Stephens talks about the goals for the upcoming La Vuelta: “With the solid block of riders that we present for the Vuelta España 2023, we are looking forward to using our resilience and consistency to fight for a podium finish with one of our riders. With the high level of our rivals, we will have a difficult job but we also look forward to the battle for the young riders general classification. Stage wins are always a high priority for us and we are hoping to tick as many boxes as we can on our goals and expectations list.”\n\nThe team will be led by Santiago Buitrago, who this year already finished on the podium on three occasions (Saudi Tour, Ruta del Sol, and Liège-Bastogne-Liège) and won a stage at Giro d’Italia; and Mikel Landa, who’s also been on the podium three times this year (Ruta del Sol, Itzulia Basque Country, and La Flèche Wallonne).\n\nMatevž Govekar will be our sprinter, supported by Jasha Sütterlin and Kamil Gradek. Our road captain is Damiano Caruso, and together with Wout Poels and Antonio Tiberi, they will provide mountain support.\n\nNeil Stephens continues with the breakdown of the riders’ duties and expectations: “Mikel Landa will be our Team leader. He is a highly regarded stage race rider looking forward to finishing his time at Bahrain Victorious. The Co-leader will be Santiago Buitrago. Santi is our rising star. He has won great mountain stages in the Grand Tours but still needs to prove himself in the GC battle. He is in great shape and looking forward to doing that in the Vuelta this year.\n\nMoving on to our Road Captain – Damiano Caruso. He is an extremely consistent athlete who we can depend on to be with our leaders to guide and assist them. Damiano has also done some fantastic major tours in his career and comes to this Vuelta in great shape. Wout Poels, who recently won a stage at the Tour de France, will be coming to ride the Vuelta in a mountain support role.\n\nRiding his first major tour with Bahrain Victorious, Antonio Tiberi is a highly talented young rider, who will be riding in support during this year’s Vuelta, so that he can help his teammates and also grow and learn as a major player in major tours in the future.\n\nKamil Gradek is one of our pillar workhorses, who is looking forward to making his debut in the Vuelta, while Jasha Sütterlin is another workhorse that never seems to tire. He is coming into his third Vuelta in great shape and ready to do his work.\n\nMatevž Govekar will be coming into the Vuelta to make his grand tour debut. There is no doubt that he will do some great work through this race, but perhaps the main goal for Matevz is to continue to develop and learn from his teammates.”\n\nOur Co-leader Santiago Buitrago is optimistic and humble: “I’m very excited to return to the Vuelta a España; the preparation is on the right track, we have done a very good preparation, and I hope to arrive at the Vuelta in the best shape, it is a great privilege to go to the Vuelta as one of the leaders and more with the support and experience of my teammates, we hope to do a great Vuelta. We have had good results in the Giro and Tour, and we hope that the Vuelta will not be the exception.”\n\nMovistar Team ready for 2023 men’s La Vuelta\n\n2023 LA VUELTA GUIDE | All info on the Movistar Team\n\nEnric Mas, last year’s 2nd-placed overall in the Spanish Grand Tour, spearheads Telefónica squad’s chances at 44th consecutive appearance in the event.\n\nIt’s the last big goal of the season and the Movistar Team heads into it, just like every year, with strong excitement and will of being star actors. The 2023 men’s La Vuelta starts from Catalan soil on Saturday 26th, and the Telefónica-backed squad has already decided on the eight names it will bring to the opening team time trial in Barcelona.\n\nEnric Mas, 2nd in the 2022 race, returns into racing after his crash in the Tour, and will be the leader of a roster also including Spanish road race champion Oier Lazkano. The lineup is completed by Colombia’s Einer Rubio, Portuguese duo Nelson Oliveira / Ruben Guerreiro and Spaniards Iván García Cortina, Jorge Arcas and Carlos Verona.\n\nThe ten mountain-top finishes -some of those as recognisable as the Col du Tourmalet (Friday 8th) or L’Angliru (Wednesday 13th) and the 26km ITT on stage ten (Tuesday 5th) around Valladolid, will decide the final outcome in La Vuelta, no less than the 44th consecutive appearance for Abarca Sports’ teams as well as their 13th under Telefónica’s title sponsorship.\n\nLotto Dstny Aims for Stage Victory in Vuelta\n\nLotto Dstny goes to the Vuelta with a combative, balanced group. Andreas Kron, Lennert Van Eetvelt, Jarrad Drizners, Thomas De Gendt, Sylvain Moniquet, Eduardo Sepulveda, Sébastien Grignard and Milan Menten are the riders that will represent Lotto Dstny at the 2023 Vuelta a España. The Belgian team targets a stage victory.\n\n“I think we have a strong, balanced team for this last Grand Tour of the season,” says sports manager Kurt Van de Wouwer. “We do not have one specific leader, which offers opportunities to everyone in the team. In the latest Tour de France we showed our fighting spirit almost every day and we ended with Victor Campenaerts on the podium in Paris as Super Combatif. Just like in France, we want to show our stripes every day in Spain.”\n\nThe team mixes experience with youth. Thomas De Gendt will start in his 24th Grand Tour and has good memories of the Spanish race with a stage victory in 2017 and the KOM jersey in 2018. We have three grand tour debutants in this Vuelta: Sébastien Grignard, Milan Menten and Lennert Van Eetvelt. “At 22 years old, Van Eetvelt is the youngster of the pack”, says Van de Wouwer, “Lennert already showed himself this year and took his first professional victory in the Sibiu Tour. He can now have a taste of a Grand Tour for the first time and starts without any pressure. Milan is our fast man in this team and we hope to see him in the mix in the sprint stages. He can rely on the support of Jarrad Drizners.”\n\nAndreas Kron, Eduardo Sepulveda, Sylvain Moniquet can use their climbing talents in the many hilly stages of this Vuelta. “Eduardo has shown his good form with a stage victory and the final classification in the Vuelta Castilla y Léon,” Van de Wouwer concludes, “We also expect a few things from Andreas Kron and Sylvain Moniquet in the more difficult stages.”\n\nDe Gendt’s 24th GT:\n\nTeam dsm-firmenich Reveal Stage Hunting Vuelta a España Roster\n\nThe battles for pink and yellow have come and gone, now the peloton will duke it out over 21 challenging days of racing; fighting over steep mountains, full-gas flat stages and efforts against the clock as they battle for the Maillot Rojo and more, at the last Grand Tour showdown – the Vuelta a España.\n\nKnown for its interesting and unique stage design, this year’s edition of La Vuelta is no different and provides a variety of terrain where everyone in the peloton should find something to their liking. Kicking off with a team time trial in Barcelona, mountain finishes on stages three and five should already set the GC battle alight, while the rest of the first week should see the sprinters or escape artists rewarded. Heading into week two a test against the clock once again sees the peloton return to action before a mixed bag of terrain, including a brutal looking stage 13 which features roughly 4000 metres of climbing and a finish on the Col du Tourmalet packed into 135 kilometres. Continuing to make its way across the northern part of the country before heading southwards, the action should be hot until the very end at the final stage into the capital of Madrid.\n\nTeam dsm-firmenich head to the start line in Barcelona, adorned in their distinctive two-striped jersey and ready to get stuck into what should be an exciting 21 days of racing.\n\nTeam dsm-firmenich coach Phil West expressed: “We’re looking forward to starting the final Grand Tour of the year at the Vuelta a España. We have a nice balance of experience in our line-up with four of our guys making their three-week debut which will be an important step in their development. Sportive wise, our main goal will be to search for our opportunities over the 21 days, hunting for stage results on the mixed terrain; with chances in the mountains and hilly days for our climbers, while our rouleurs will play their cards on the rolling terrain, and of course we have the sprints as well. With our line-up we are also looking to the future with our young GC talents; using it as an opportunity to learn from our more experienced riders on how to ride GC in a three-week race, which will be an invaluable experience for the coming years. As for the route, there is something for everyone throughout the three weeks with sprint stages, hilly breakaway days, and challenging days in the mountains with some famous and brutally tough climbs. As a team, we are really motivated after some nice team camps and good recent racing, and we’re excited to pin on our numbers again in Barcelona.”\n\nLine-up:\n\nRomain Bardet (FRA)\n\nRomain Combaud (FRA)\n\nAlberto Dainese (ITA)\n\nSean Flynn (GBR)\n\nChris Hamilton (AUS)\n\nLorenzo Milesi (ITA)\n\nOscar Onley (GBR)\n\nMax Poole (GBR).\n\nBardet to la Vuelta:\n\nIntermarché-Circus-Wanty Aims for the Victory in a Third Consecutive Edition\n\nIntermarché-Circus-Wanty will line up for the start of the Vuelta with the aim of conquering a stage win for a third year in a row. This Saturday 26th of August, the World Team will start its third Grand Tour of the season in Barcelona to reach Madrid on Sunday 17th of September.\n\nSelection\n\nRein Taaramäe, stage winner and red jersey wearer in the first participation of Intermarché-Circus-Wanty to the Tour of Spain 2021, is part of the selection for the third consecutive time and will start his nineteenth Grand Tour. Another experimented personality in the group, former world champion Rui Costa, will line up for his sixteenth Grand Tour in a country in which he won three times this season and in which he recently improved his best result in the Clásica San Sebastian.\n\nBelgian sprinter Gerben Thijssen, winner of three Belgian classics this season, will participate in the Tour of Spain for the third time, supported by his sprint train composed of Boy van Poppel, Julius Johansen and Hugo Page. The Dutchman van Poppel, who already started in eight Grand Tours, is his lead out. Danish rider Julius Johansen made a strong impression last year by concluding his first Grand Tour with a stunt in Madrid.\n\nTwo riders will make their Grand Tour debut, young talents Rune Herregodts and Hugo Page. Herregodts distinguished himself on the highest level with a stage podium in the Critérium du Dauphiné and a bronze medal at the Belgian time trial championship. Page just took his first professional victory in the Tour du Limousin.\n\nAuthor of an exceptional season start, Belgian rider Kobe Goossens obtained his first two successes as a professional rider on Spanish territory in January. In his second Vuelta, the climber returns in competition for the first time since the Tour de Romandie in April, liberated from the health problems who impeded him from participating to the Tour de France, like his compatriot Herregodts. These eight riders will be directed by Valerio Piva and Pieter Vanspeybrouck.\n\nPieter Vanspeybrouck (Sports Director): “The main goal for our third Vuelta is to win a stage, like we did in the two previous editions. Therefore, we created a balance between youth and experience within our team. With Rui Costa, Kobe Goossens, Rune Herregodts and Rein Taaramäe, we have four offensive elements capable of realising our ambition in the middle mountains, they have proved it. With Gerben Thijssen, we have one of the fastest sprinters in the peloton. His sprint train will focus on all possible sprint opportunities and will help him to pass the difficult stages.”\n\n“Rui Costa will line up in a good condition. With his eighth place in the Clásica San Sebastián he has shown that the Tour de France has been good for him. Rein Taaramäe also prepared himself well and will be, once more, of great value for our team. Our two experimented riders will play a key role, on and off the bike to guide our youngest elements through those three weeks.”\n\n“After a long period with health issues, Kobe Goossens is again producing promising performances in training. We’re happy to have him back, ready to return into competition in this Vuelta to make the team colours shine on the attack. Rune Herregodts has shown in the Critérium du Dauphiné that he was capable of achieving big things on the highest level. He can benefit of the total confidence and support of the team to show himself in the stages he identified as opportunities.”\n\n“Our group of climbers will benefit of a lot of liberty to race aggressively, because unfortunately we are heading to the Vuelta without our GC leader Louis Meintjes. It is a serious spanner in the works, Louis was our stage winner last year, but the collarbone fracture he sustained in the Tour de France prevented him from presenting himself at the start in good shape. I’m convinced that we will see him shining in the difficult classics at the end of the season.”\n\n“The pure sprinters such as Gerben Thijssen probably have to wait until the seventh stage for the first bunch sprint opportunity. With Boy van Poppel, Julius Johansen and Hugo Page he can rely on three riders he knows very well to bring him in the final kilometres. A couple of days before his first Grand Tour, Hugo Page received a big confidence boost in the Tour du Limousin. Our youngest rider in our selection is a true asset in case of a sprint on a hilly parcours.”\n\nVuelta a España Selection:\n\nRui Costa\n\nKobe Goossens\n\nRune Herregodts\n\nJulius Johansen\n\nHugo Page\n\nRein Taaramäe\n\nGerben Thijssen\n\nBoy van Poppel.\n\nSports Direction: Valerio Piva, Pieter Vanspeybrouck.\n\nPogačar Raising Money for Flood Relief in Slovenia\n\nOn Wednesday, Tadej Pogačar was helping to raise money for the victims of the recent floods in Slovenia. For every picture taken with fans and autographs signed, he would donate €10. He said he would give a minimum of €10,000 to the charity.\n\n“As many of you have seen on the news in recent weeks, Slovenia has been hit by devastating floods in large parts of the country,” Pogačar wrote on Instagram. Due to the high water levels and the heavy rainfall, there was devastation in several parts of Slovenia. Many people had to be evacuated and at least six people died due to the storm.\n\nTo raise money for the aid, Pogačar signed autographs and posed for photos with fans on Wednesday with fans in the Congress Square in Ljubljana from 6 p.m. “For every photo and signature, we donate €10 to charity to help with flood relief. In any case, we are going to donate €10,000,” said Pogačar.\n\nBen Wiggins Signs with Axel Merckx Team\n\nBen Wiggins will race in 2024 for Hagens Berman Axeon, the team of manager Axel Merckx. The 18 year-old Briton is the son of former Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins and was recently second at the World junior time trial championships. “This was a no-brainer for me,” said Wiggins.\n\n“I have been talking to Axel for a while and have always admired the team,” he explained. “I know the history of the team and know many riders who have taken a step through this team. I therefore immediately knew that this would be the right place for me to develop, because I want to try to get into the WorldTour.”\n\nThe sons of Bradley Wiggins and Eddy Merckx are joining forces. That also influenced Ben Wiggins’ choice. “Axel grew up in much the same situation as me because our fathers did great things in sports,” he said. “I can’t think of anyone better to get advice and guidance from. I can’t wait.”\n\n“We both have a famous surname and I can help him in everything that comes with it,” responded Axel Merckx. “It’s not something many people experience, so we have a lot of similarities in that regard.”\n\nWiggins junior can handle time trials, Classics and hilly terrain well. “I’m glad he chose us,” said Merckx. “We hope that we can contribute to his growth and development as a cyclist. His second place at the World time trial championships shows how much talent he has, but we also know that there is still a long way to go.”\n\nBen Wiggins to Hagens Berman Axeon:\n\nLast French Race for Thibaut Pinot Ends Badly\n\nThibaut Pinot would have wanted a better ending to his last French race, the Tour Poitou-Charentes. The 33-year-old Groupama-FDJ rider crashed during the second stage and was unable to continue.\n\nPinot was looking forward to racing in France for the last time in the Tour Poitou-Charentes, a four-day stage race. In the second stage to Bressuire, Pinot crashed and had to abandon. It is not yet known whether Pinot has serious injuries from his crash, but it is a significant set-back during his farewell season. The Frenchman was scheduled to end his career after the Tour of Lombardy, the classic that he won in 2018. In the spring Pinot finished second in the Tour du Doubs and the Tour du Jura, but his best result has been fifth in the final overall of the Giro d’Italia and took the KOM jersey. Pinot also rode the Tour de France and had an incredible day in front of his fans in the Vosges.\n\nWill Pinot ride Il Lombardia?\n\nArnaud De Lie Stays with Lotto Dstny Until at Least the End of 2026\n\nLotto Dstny has extended the contract of its 21-year-old leader Arnaud De Lie with two years. De Lie still had a contract for next season, but signed an additional two-season deal. That way, the Belgian will race in Lotto Dstny outfit until at least the end of 2026.\n\nAfter an impressive season with the Development Team, De Lie turned pro last year. The ‘Bull of Lescheret’ showed himself immediately, developed really fast and ended his first professional year with no less than nine victories. This season, despite a heavy crash in mid-May, De Lie’s tally already stands at seven and he took close places of honour at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Dwars door Vlaanderen and the Brabantse Pijl, among others.\n\nCEO Stéphane Heulot is therefore very pleased with this contract extension. “With the eyes on the future, Arnaud De Lie’s contract extension was a priority. We are therefore very pleased that one of Belgium’s greatest cycling talents will stay on board at Lotto Dstny. From the moment Arnaud entered the Development Team, he experienced a tremendous development and quickly became one of our leaders due to his strong performances. Everyone in the team and also Arnaud himself is convinced that there is still a nice margin for growth. This long-term commitment gives us the opportunity to take the next steps within Lotto Dstny, so that together we can realise Arnaud’s ambitions. We are already very much looking forward to what the future holds,” concludes Stéphane Heulot.\n\nArnaud De Lie explains his choice for an extended stay at Lotto Dstny. “Extending at Lotto Dstny was a logical choice for me. The team showed a lot of confidence in me from the beginning and it felt very good right away. In addition, the project the management has proposed to me for the coming years is promising. The team goes into every detail and continues to invest in performance, to bring out the best in its riders. All these things made me happy to prolong.”\n\n“The fact that I will be racing with Lotto Dstny until 2026 gives me some peace of mind and also the time to improve step by step. This year I was already able to show myself several times in WorldTour races, which proves that I keep making progress. The ambition is therefore to become competitive at the highest level in the future and win a big Classic. Which one that may be doesn’t really matter to me. And whether I am more of a sprinter or a Classics’ rider? I am lucky to be good at both but my heart still lies a bit more with the Classics. Of course, that doesn’t take away the fact that both things are possible to combine.”\n\nBefore looking to the future, some big appointments still await De Lie this season, starting with the Renewi Tour and, among others, the Canadian one-day races in Quebec and Montreal. “A WorldTour win in one of upcoming races would be fantastic. I am in very good form and it would be a very nice end to the season.”\n\nArnaud De Lie to stay with Lotto Dstny:\n\nEnd of Season for Thomas Gloag – Hit by Car While Training\n\nThomas Gloag will be out of action for the rest of 2023. The British Jumbo-Visma rider was hit by a car during a training ride and sustained a knee injury. He has since had surgery on his knee.\n\n21 year-old Gloag will now “focus on his recovery and next season”, Jumbo-Visma said on social media.\n\nGloag was in his first full season as a professional with Jumbo-Visma, after he was an stagiere with the Dutch WorldTeam last fall. In his first race of 2023, the Tour of Valencia, he took a 2nd place on the fourth stage and a 6th place in the final overall. He also rode the UAE Tour and the Tour de Romandie, which he finished 11th.\n\nGloag was also in the Giro d’Italia, his first Grand Tour. He finished after working for his teammate Primoz Roglič who won. His only other appearance was in the Clásica San Sebastián. Due to his knee injury, that was his last race of the year.\n\nThomas Gloag’s 2023 season over:\n\nEF Education-Cannondale Adds Magdeleine Vallieres and Letizia Borghesi to its 2024 Roster\n\nBoth riders aim to build on their strengths with EF Education-Cannondale\n\nMagdeleine Vallieres and Letizia Borghesi will join EF Education-Cannondale next season. The pair both have two years of experience in the Women’s WorldTour and though they have already shown themselves to be exemplary teammates, Letizia and Magdeleine are looking to grow with their new team.\n\nAt just 22-years-old, Magdeleine Vallieres has yet to find her limits. She surprised herself last year with her abilities in the mountains at both the Giro d’Italia Donne and the Tour de France Femmes. She has again proven herself to be a dependable climber this season, supporting Veronica Ewers in the American’s key races. For Magdeleine, discovering her own capabilities is part of the sport’s appeal.\n\n“I love races like Strade Bianche and the grand tours,” Magdeleine says. “I like the long races because you really get to push your limits to another level going that hard every single day. I like how you can improve so much within a race, too. In stage racing, you get to apply what you’ve learned from the stage before and keep pressing forward.”\n\nHer enthusiasm to learn and to be an effective teammate are what drive Magdeleine.\n\n“I’ve learned a lot as a rider in the WorldTour so far. If you asked me two years ago, I don’t think I always had a solid understanding of the tactics or I didn’t always know the best way to do my job as a support rider. Now I feel like I’ve gained some experience and knowledge that I can put forward to helping the team. I want to get stronger, of course, and there’s still so much more I want to learn from my new teammates so that I can be the best helper,” Magdeleine says.\n\nEsra Tromp, team general manager, is equally excited to see how much Magdeleine can still grow.\n\n“She is still very young so we still need to really find out where her limit is and how we can support her in her development,” Esra says. “She knows how to be a super helper for a lot of the riders in the team but I hope that we can develop her even more, to the point where she can also go for a result herself.”\n\nMagdeleine’s love of learning extends beyond the bike. Alongside racing, she is studying business administration.\n\n“I’ve always wanted to have a business,” she says. “I used to have one last year so I know what it’s like to be an entrepreneur and it interests me for a possible career after cycling. I’m taking it slow. Cycling is definitely my biggest focus so I make sure I don’t study too much and I am doing my degree online. It’s also nice to have something else that you can turn your mind to apart from training and racing.”\n\nThe rider from Sherbrooke, Quebec spent much of her adolescence racing cyclocross and mountain bikes in addition to road racing, but she credits her dad with introducing her to cycling.\n\n“I would also spend my summer vacations visiting my mom in Gaspésie, Quebec, which was about 1,000 kilometres from where we lived in Sherbrooke. When I was nine, my dad just said, ‘Oh, this year we’ll go there by bike.’ We did it in about nine days, camping on the way, and being self-supported. Just ride and ride and eat, that’s all I had to do every day. I really loved it.”\n\nThis off-season, when Magdeleine returns to Canada before the Quebecois winter sets in, she plans to do that same route from Sherbrooke to Gaspésie again.\n\nLetizia Borghesi is another rider who is an established team player but is still hungry to improve.\n\nHailing from the mountains of Trentino, Italy, Letizia grew up racing on all types of terrain and in all types of weather. Consequently, she has grown into a classics-style racer who loves one-day races.\n\n“The classics are really good for me,” Letizia says. “I’m good in Belgian-type weather, on the cobbles, on gravel, I have good bike handling skills. So the classics are my favourite because you have to do a lot of short efforts on the steep climbs right after tight corners while keeping your position in the bunch. I love this type of racing but I still want to improve even more to fight for results next year.”\n\nEsra believes the Giro stage winner still has room to grow.\n\n“Letizia is maybe one of the best positions in the bunch and she has the skills to go downhill or over the cobbles,” Esra says. “She’s helped with lead outs in the past but I would like to figure out if she can sometimes do a sprint for herself as well. She is not a pure, pure sprinter, but on a selective course or from a small group she can do a great result so I am curious if we can develop that a bit more.”\n\nThe 24-year-old is excited to see not only what she can do in 2024 but what the team can accomplish together.\n\n“Next year will be our first year of working together but I already think we can achieve a lot of great things together. We will have to learn to work together and to improve together, but this is a talented group and I believe in what we can do,” Letizia says.\n\nEsra is impressed with Letizia’s racing, and also by her approach to the sport.\n\n“She is really eager and would like to bring something to the team. That is cool because a lot of times, riders will think only about themselves, but she sees that team aspect a lot and that’s really important. She will be a great character to have in the team. Letizia talked about wanting the team to be her second family where there is an open culture and everybody can say what is on their mind, and still have fun with each other and encourage each other to get the best out of themselves,” Esra says.\n\nWhen she’s not training and racing, Letizia spends her time with her family, but even that time often centres around bikes. Given that her younger sister also races, her dad was a high level amateur cyclist in his youth, and her mom just enjoys going out for a ride, the entire family revolves around cycling.\n\nWhen she wants to switch off from racing, Letizia runs and hikes in the mountains near her home, often bringing the family dogs with her. She earned her first degree in sports science and is now working towards a second degree, this time in biology with an emphasis on nutrition.\n\nThere are so many aspects of next season that Letizia is looking forward to that she struggles to name them all.\n\n“I’m excited,” she says. “I’m really excited to get to know the new squad. I’m excited to make a plan to better develop my strengths and to work on my weaknesses. I’m really excited to work with this organisation. I’m looking forward to this new environment. I’m just really excited about everything.”\n\nWe’re excited, too! Welcome to EF Education-Cannondale, Letizia and Magdeleine!\n\nLetizia Borghesi to EF Education-Cannondale:\n\nAstana Qazaqstan Team Signs Lorenzo Fortunato\n\nAstana Qazaqstan Team is happy to announce the new rider for the seasons of 2024 and 2025: the Italian Lorenzo Fortunato (27) signed a two-year deal with the Kazakh team.\n\n“I am really happy to join team Astana, the team with a great history, who won all three Grand Tours with different riders. I am looking forward to meeting my new team and I hope to keep on progressing there as I did it during the last three years. I am sure with a bigger calendar which I’ll have in Astana Qazaqstan Team I’ll have more opportunities to prove myself as a team helper and as a rider who can make results. I am really grateful for this possibility to make a step into the WorldTour and I hope to pay this trust off in the next years”, said Lorenzo Fortunato.\n\nLorenzo Fortunato is a well-known Italian climber and stage-race rider with several impressing results during his five-year professional career. Lorenzo started as pro rider in 2019 with a 4th place in the Tour of Albania and a 6th place in the Tour of Almaty, but his main results came later back in 2021 when he won a stage at the Giro d’Italia atop the legendary Monte Zoncolan and the General Classification of the Adriatica-Ionica Race.\n\nIn 2023 Lorenzo Fortunato won a stage and the General Classification of the Vuelta Asturias, finished 5th in the Tour of the Alps and 6th in the Tour of Slovenia.\n\n“With all the results Lorenzo already achieved it seems like it is a good time for him to move to the WorldTour and I believe he is the rider who can make a serious step ahead in his career in our team. We see in Lorenzo a rider who can fight for a good result in week-long stage races but also in one-day classics. At the same time he has an impressive experience in the Giro d’Italia where he already got an important win on Zoncolan. Well, I am looking forward to see Lorenzo in Astana Qazaqstan Team and I am sure this move could be a successful one both for the rider and the team”, said Alexandr Vinokurov, General manager of Astana Qazaqstan Team.\n\nLorenzo Fortunato to Astana:\n\nPascal Ackermann and Michael Schwarzmann Set to reunite at Israel – Premier Tech\n\nIsrael – Premier Tech’s roster will be bolstered by the arrival of Pascal Ackermann and Michael Schwarzmann in 2024, with the German duo set to bring their sprinting prowess and a wealth of experience to the team.\n\nPreviously teammates for five years from 2017 to 2021, Ackermann and Schwarzmann will reunite in IPT colours in a move that will add depth to the team’s roster says IPT General Manager Kjell Carlström.\n\n“Our 2024 rider roster is taking great shape and we are excited to welcome a number of young riders to the team. At the same time, we wanted to bring on an experienced and proven winner to strengthen our sprint group and we believe Pascal Ackermann will be a perfect fit. Pascal has 40 wins to his name, an impressive achievement since turning professional seven years ago and he showed with his Giro d’Italia stage win this year that he is one of the fastest sprinters in the peloton. Every sprinter needs their trusted captain out on the road and in signing Michael Schwarzmann, we are welcoming an experienced lead out rider who will play an important role for Pascal and our other sprinters,” explains Carlström.\n\nWith stage wins at the Giro d’Italia and Vuelta a España to his name, Ackermann is excited for the next two years with IPT and chasing a maiden Tour de France victory with IPT.\n\n“I was looking for a team that is focused on development and working with young riders, where I can bring my experience and also benefit from a good lead out structure. I think it’s really important to be working with young riders because they are so motivated and strong, and you could see in the races this year that Israel – Premier Tech is already doing that and has one of the best lead outs, so I am really happy to join the team. I have won a lot of races and a lot of big races, but the Tour de France is still the one that is missing. I have never raced the Tour and it is one of my biggest dreams, so I think IPT is the perfect team to race with and get my first Tour de France win,” says Ackermann.\n\n“When I turned pro, Michael Schwarzmann was the guy who taught me how to be a pro cyclist and showed me how to save power, and beyond that we are friends. When I decided to come to Israel – Premier Tech, I wanted to bring him with me as I know he is one of the most experienced guys in cycling, he knows exactly what he needs to do, how to ride, when to move up, and he can teach the young riders so much. He will be one of the most important guys for me next year, and also with a rider like Rick Zabel who you can see is doing the best lead outs. I hope together we will get some nice victories.”\n\nSchwarzmann, who joins IPT on a one-year deal, is looking forward to contributing to the team’s success and helping to foster the team’s spirit.\n\n“I was really impressed by everything team management presented to me, from material, training, race program and the direction the team wants to go in. The fact that Pascal will be the main sprinter I will work with was a big factor in my decision to come to IPT. I think he saw in the past years that you need a loyal and good working team around him, and there I think I can help him during the races and also in the lead outs. To create a good team spirit and share my experience with the rest of the team is also an important point for me. I believe in this project, and I think all together we can create something big. My personal goal for the next years will be to develop as a rider. I want to be a reliable and loyal rider for the team to get the most out of it and win races,” adds Schwarzmann.\n\nHaving already signed young sprint sensation Ethan Vernon, and graduated Riley Pickrell, Nadav Raisberg, and Oded Kogut from IPT Academy, IPT owner Sylvan Adams is confident in the team’s direction for 2024 and beyond.\n\n“Pascal Ackerman is one of the top sprinters in the sport, and I’m excited to welcome him to our team. To ensure his success at IPT, we additionally reached out to sign his trusted compatriot, Michael Schwarzmann, to join our lead-out train for Pascal. With these two riders, we have significantly improved our roster for 2024, and I am confident of great results next year,” says Sylvan Adams.\n\nPascal Ackermann to Israel – Premier Tech:\n\nAlison Jackson Signs with EF Education-Cannondale\n\n‘Whether it’s me getting to be the winner or helping a teammate to make that happen, my goal is to do something that really matters’\n\nParis-Roubaix winner and current Canadian road national champion Alison Jackson will join EF Pro Cycling’s new women’s team – EF Education-Cannondale – beginning in 2024.\n\nJackson earned the biggest win of her career to date earlier this season when she won the third edition of Paris-Roubaix from a breakaway that many considered doomed. She is also a two-time Canadian road race national champion and former time trial national champion. She has won stages of the Ladies Tour, the Women’s Tour of Scotland, and Simac Ladies Tour as well as the points jersey at the Ladies Tour of Norway and the Tour of Scandinavia. Jackson has represented Canada at the road race world championships nine times, earning sixth place in 2021.\n\nFor Jackson, there were multiple reasons that made signing with EF Education-Cannondale so appealing.\n\n“EF Pro Cycling does such a good job with letting me be me and I love that part,” she says. “I can just be who I am and it’s appreciated on and off the bike. I really love the brands and partners that are on board with EF Education-Cannondale. I love the storytelling that EF Pro Cycling does, like RaceTV, so there’s a lot of other things that signing with this team adds to my life alongside bike racing.”\n\nAnyone who follows Jackson on social media already knows that the same passion and energy she puts into racing, she applies to enjoying life – and dancing.\n\n“I just want to share laughter with other people. The videos I make and the dances I do, they’re always funny in a lighthearted, positive way. If I can make people laugh and take their minds off things or just have people join in my joy, it feels good,” Jackson says.\n\nEsra Tromp, general manager of EF Education-Cannondale, recognises the importance of Jackson’s joyful approach to life but knows there is another side to the 34-year-old.\n\n“She is a rider with a big personality who shows it with a lot of fun videos and dances and she brings that fun element to the team but in speaking with her, I can see a determined and focused rider who can still learn a lot. She can also balance this racing side of her with the fun-loving side of her. This also inspires teammates to have a little bit of fun around the races. She brings experience, determination, discipline, and fun. As a rider, I think she can perform on an even higher level than she has in the past couple of years and can win even more. We’re going to help her with that,” Tromp says.\n\nWhether it’s Jackson or a teammate crossing the finish line first, winning is among the Canadian’s priorities for 2024.\n\n“I just want us to win bike races,” Jackson says. “I think that with bold riding and good legs, it’s going to be good. My personal goals will always be in the spring and I just want to take confidence from the Paris-Roubaix win to win again, ideally in some of these other classic races that I’ve had my eye on. I love racing and I always say I just want to be a difference-maker, so whether it’s me getting to be the winner or helping a teammate to make that happen, my goal is to do something that really matters in the race.”\n\nThough Jackson only started riding bikes at age 19, she has been an athlete all of her life.\n\n“As a kid, I had all this extra energy I didn’t know what to do with so my mom put me in all these sports,” she says. “When you’re from a small town, if you’re going to play sports, you have to play all the sports so there’s enough for a team.”\n\nIn her hometown of Vermilion, Alberta, population 4,000, Jackson was generally the best athlete at every sport she did, but competing at higher levels was eye-opening for her.\n\n“I was in gymnastics and we’d go to provincial finals and it’d be at another level. I’d think, ‘Oh my gosh, I am so far behind.’ It was like I didn’t know what was possible so I just wanted to keep going,” she says.\n\nDiscovering what is possible has always been a major drive for Jackson, something that team general manager Esra Trump cites as one of the many assets she will bring to the team.\n\n“She won Paris-Roubaix this year which is really one of the biggest, most beautiful races out there,” Tromp says. “That is, of course, a big achievement but I think it also says a lot about her, about setting a goal, having a dream, and going one hundred percent for it. Everyone thought in that race the peloton would catch the break but she never stopped believing and I think that is something she brings to the team – a deep sense of belief.”\n\nThis attitude is part of Jackson’s philosophy and she credits it with taking her far in life, both in and out of racing.\n\n“I’m super positive and resilient,” Jackson says. “Not everything in life is always awesome but to be able to acknowledge that and then get back to my natural state of positivity is helpful. And my resiliency goes a long way in a bike race. We lose more times than we win and we have to have that resiliency to keep coming back, to keep coming back after a crash or a disappointment. I’ve got a zest for life and storytelling. The life we live as professional athletes, we definitely collect so many stories when we’re at the bike races.”\n\nAlison, we are so excited to collect stories with you. Welcome to the team!\n\nAlison Jackson to EF:\n\nQ36.5 Pro Cycling Team Strengthens Roster with Signing of Frederik Frison\n\nThe vastly experienced 31-year-old Belgian rider Frederik Frison will join the Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team ranks in the upcoming season on a two-year deal, through 2025.\n\nWith a reputation for being a strong all-rounder with unrelenting determination, and strategic prowess, Frison brings a wealth of experience and expertise to the team. His extensive knowledge of the peloton dynamics and his ability to perform across a range of terrains make him a versatile asset, able to contribute to the team’s success in various races, particularly the classics and stage races.\n\nAfter spending eight seasons in a Belgian outfit, Frison decided it was time for a new chapter in his professional career and the choice to sign for Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team was an easy one.\n\n“This team, Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team, looked really good to me right from the beginning! There is a clear vision for the future and that’s obvious now, in the way the team works and the material and equipment used. After 8 years the same team it is a good moment to have a new chapter in my career. I think this will give me a lot of motivation! I believe I can have a free role in some classic races and help the team achieve good results. I will also have the opportunity to race with new teammates and rejoin some old ones. It will be new atmosphere and that is something I’m very much looking forward to,” said Frison.\n\nThroughout his career, Frison has had standout performances in prestigious one-day races, including podium placings and has raced in all three Grand Tours, providing great support to his teammates in both stage and GC goals. His experience and depth of talent make him a valuable new signing for Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team.\n\n“We are thrilled to welcome Frederik Frison to the Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team family,” said Doug Ryder, General Manager at Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team. “Frederik’s proven capabilities on the road, combined with his passion to race, loyalty and commitment to his own goals as well as those of the team align perfectly with our ethos. We are confident that his presence will enhance our competitive edge and elevate our performance throughout the season, particularly in the hard Classics, where he has consistently proven to excel.”\n\nWith Frederik Frison’s addition to Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team roster for 2024, the team’s prospects for success in major one-day classics and stage races are poised to expand further. He is the second new signing for our Swiss-registered team for the upcoming season after Italian Giacomo Nizzolo penned a two-year deal.\n\nFrederik Frison to Q36.5 Pro Cycling Team:\n\nJhonatan Restrepo, first signing for EOLO KOMETA 2024\n\nColombian rider Jhonatan Restrepo (1994) will wear the colours of the EOLO KOMETA team next season. It is the first confirmed signing, coming from GW Shimano Sidermec, and he is a complete, versatile cyclist, who undoubtedly will bring great joys to the professional structure of the Contador Team Foundation.\n\nRestrepo, who is in his country recovering from an injury suffered in the last Vuelta a Colombia, is breathing better and better after his rib fracture and above all, looking to be ready for his return to Europe. A call, that of EOLO KOMETA, which makes him be “very motivated. It is one of the best Professional Continental teams, the best for me. I especially emphasise that it has a lot of human quality, it is not only the cyclists but all those who are part of the structure. I’m looking forward to starting”, he assures.\n\nSince 2020 in the ranks of Androni Giocattoli, then GW Shimano Sidermec, and with the principles in track cycling, Restrepo has shone especially in the Tour of Rwanda with six stages (the last in 2022) and taking advantage of his ability when the road is up but also in the sprint in small groups. This year he has won the Giro Reggio Calabria and the first stage of the Vuelta a Tolima as the most outstanding results.\n\nBorn in Pácora, on the Cordillera Central de Los Andes, he faces what will be his eighth season as a professional with renewed motivation: “Since I knew about the options of joining EOLO KOMETA, I was very happy to know that they trusted me and I hope to pay back that trust in the best races”.\n\nHe will be a cyclist of reference, and he already has a great experience in the professional peloton. His development as a track rider gives him the ability to move in the group, to position himself very well and to read the race to be in the key moments: “I’m not afraid of contact, to get into the massive sprints. If I position myself well, I can pass the climbs and look for the victory with my speed”.\n\nAbout the team, he underlines “their combativeness. No rider of EOLO KOMETA is in the breakaway for the sake of being there, but to look for the victory. They are always looking for the best result and believing that it is possible, it can be achieved”. Looking to the future, aware of the enormous opportunity, he recognises that he would love to “compete in the Giro d’Italia, it’s everyone’s dream. But I want to be competitive from the start of the season”.\n\nManager Fran Contador refers to Restrepo by emphasising “his desire and determination, which will surely translate into results”. In this line, he shows his confidence in the role of the Colombian rider in the team’s plan: “He will be an important part of the professional structure next year”, he assures.\n\nIvan Basso also values the arrival of Jhonatan Restrepo: “He reflects our idea of growth and fits perfectly with our philosophy. He is happy to have come to us, and we are happy that he has joined our family for next season”.\n\nMegan Armitage Joins EF Education-Cannondale\n\n“I want to win. I want to be on a winning team. And I just want to enjoy myself and keep progressing.”\n\nMegan Armitage fell in love with our team when she started cycling. At first, it was the jersey. Now, we’re proud to announce that the 26-year-old Irishwoman has just signed a multi-year deal with EF Education-Cannondale.\n\nWhen Megan started riding bikes, it never even crossed her mind that she would become a pro. She was in Toulouse, doing a semester abroad, while she finished up her degree in French law. An injury was keeping her from running, so she and a friend rented some old bikes and rode up into the Pyrénées. Climbing those mountains, Megan decided that cycling was what she wanted to do. She had always been an athlete. Growing up in small-town Ireland, where she spent her childhood running around the fields of her family’s farm, she always wanted to be outside. Whether she was hiking or swimming or rock climbing, Megan knew that life was best outdoors. So, when she finished her studies and could finally push aside her law books, she moved to Belgium and started racing. Her talent, work ethic, and determination shone. In just her second year of cycling—2021—she finished second at the Irish national championships. The next year, she twice finished in the top ten on stages of the Tour Cycliste Féminin International de l’Ardèche, a pro stage race in France. Racing for a French team this season, she won the Vuelta Extremadura Féminas, plus two stages and the points competition at that race, on top of a pile of excellent results against WorldTour riders. Now, she’s coming to the team that first caught her eye, when she was wobbling out on her first rides in click-in pedals, those few short years ago. Megan can’t quite believe it. She is still just excited to ride her bike–and thrilled to start with EF Education-Cannondale next season.\n\n“I remember when I started cycling, I just loved the kit,” Megan says. “I thought it was the best kit ever! And now, when I spoke to Esra [EF Education-Cannondale team manager] about the team and the project, I loved her idea that we should mix striving for really great results and have fun at the same time. It is so easy to get bogged down in numbers and watts and data and lose why you started cycling in the first place. If you are not happy on the bike, then you are not going to be getting results, and I want to be doing this for years and years. So to have the opportunity for these coming seasons to be on a team where we look at both sides of the equation is pretty incredible. I am lucky.”\n\nMegan is also very determined. She has always been a gifted athlete, but has had to rely on her own resources and keep up a lot of belief in herself to get to where she is now. She’s earned her place on our team with a lot of pedal strokes. She is just getting started. Megan has a very clear idea of where she wants to go.\n\n“I want to get to the point where I can win races,” she says. “I want to win. I want to be on a winning team. And I just want to enjoy myself and keep progressing. I have so much to learn, having come to the sport quite late, so having a home for the next years where I can learn from other riders who have been in the game for a lot, lot longer than me and learn from the directors and Esra and even the guys on the men’s team will be pretty cool. So for me, it is just continuing to improve—and winning!”\n\nEF Education-Cannondale manager Esra Tromp thinks that Megan has the potential to do just that. The fact that she hasn’t followed a traditional road to the professional peloton might even be an advantage.\n\n“Megan is still quite new to the sport,” Esra says, “but she has a really good attitude, and that is something that I really like. She is super eager to grow and is really eager to learn and that is important when you are a young rider, to be open to new experiences. Megan did a lot of different sports before she got into cycling—running, hockey, athletics—but in the end, she loves riding her bike the most.”\n\nShe sure does. Megan is thankful that she found cycling when she did and won’t have to spend the coming years in law libraries, but does agree that her earlier education and experiences will serve her well.\n\n“Having come into the sport a bit later, and maybe having a little more maturity, will help me to keep my head on my shoulders and deal with the more stressful sides of the sport,” she says. “Having a university degree and knowing that there is life outside of this sport is also important, because it is so easy to get consumed by it and let it become your whole life.”\n\nEsra hopes that she shares her wisdom with her new teammates.\n\n“That experience of normal life will bring Megan some extra calm,” Esra says. “She will be able to enjoy her life as a cyclist even more and even better. And she will be able to help the younger riders who might struggle with that.”\n\nMegan knows one thing: she is going to enjoy the heck out of next season. Right now, she is training hard in Nice, France, where she lives with her boyfriend who is also a professional cyclist. Sometimes, he and Megan’s coach have to remind her that she shouldn’t spend every waking hour outside, exploring the mountains behind the city on her bike and then enjoying the Riviera sunshine on the beach. After her childhood in Ireland, Megan sometimes still forgets that it is not necessarily going to rain at some point in the next hour. And she is just really excited to show what she can do in her brand-new EF Education-Cannondale shirt.\n\n“I just love climbing,” she says. “And I really like hard races. I am a quite aggressive racer, so those attritional ones in the hills suit me best. My fatigue resistance is quite good too. I don’t seem to get too tired as the days go on. I get better and better, so hard races like the Tour and the Giro should suit me. And then, I absolutely fell in love with Liége-Bastogne-Liége this season. It is probably my favourite race of the whole season so far, so I would love to go for a really good result there.”\n\nMegan Armitage is going to get a lot of great opportunities next year. She’ll make the most of them. Welcome to EF Education-Cannondale!\n\nMegan Armitage to EF Education-Cannondale:\n\nFemke Gerritse Signs Three-Year Contract with Team SD Worx\n\nTeam SD Worx has reinforced itself for the next three years (until 2026) with 22-year-old Femke Gerritse. With this, the team has contracted a young talent who hopes to develop in shorter explosive climbing and on longer climbs.\n\nSports manager Danny Stam has been following Femke Gerritse for quite some time. “In several races where there was climbing to be done, we saw Femke’s talent to ride uphill. We also got good signals from several riders from our team who rode with her. Last summer, in the run-up to the Tour de France Femmes, she was with us to recon some stages. Then we noticed that she fits well with our team. We are confident she can still make the necessary steps and have therefore also offered her a three-year contract,” Stam said.\n\nPrecisely that three-year contract was a positive surprise for Gerritse. “It was already wonderful for me that the best team in the women’s peloton was interested in me. The fact that they are offering me a contract until the end of 2026 shows that they have a lot of confidence in me. It also means that in this team I will get the chance to develop further.”\n\nGerritse has been racing for Parkhotel Valkenburg since 2021. From the current Team SD Worx selection, Demi Vollering, Lorena Wiebes, Mischa Bredewold and Femke Markus also have a past with this Dutch team. “With Mischa and Femke I was still in the team together last year. They told me how well organised everything is at Team SD Worx. They are very enthusiastic about their transfer and have already been able to make great strides in their first year with Team SD Worx. I am now also ready for the switch to a WorldTeam and am convinced that I can develop further in this team.”\n\nGerritse, from Rosmalen, came into the international spotlight when she captured the mountain jersey after the third stage of the Tour de France Femmes to Epernay last year. On the tough climbs in the Champagne region, she gathered enough points to wear the polka dot jersey for four days. The mountain jersey was later taken over and won by Demi Vollering.\n\n“As a rider, I’m pretty all-round,” Gerritse indicated. “I come into my own best on the shorter, more explosive climbs. Hill classics like the Amstel Gold Race, Liège-Bastogne-Liège but also the Strade Bianche should suit me. In the Tour de France Femmes, but also in the Tour of Scandinavia, I have seen that I can also do well on the longer climbs. That is something I hope to develop further in the coming years. At Team SD Worx it is fantastic that I can be at the side of Demi Vollering and Lotte Kopecky, among others, because I can learn a lot from them. It is also a privilege to work with sport director Anna van der Breggen, who has a lot of experience. For me, this is a dream transfer.”\n\nFemke Gerritse to SD Worx:\n\nLotto Dstny and Allan Davis Part Ways\n\nAllan Davis is no longer employed at Lotto Dstny. The collaboration with the Australian sports director was recently terminated.\n\nJust before the Tour de France, Davis was hit by a personal affair. The team decided not to take him to the Tour to keep the peace, but did start an internal investigation into accusations regarding transgressive behaviour.\n\n“Without going into details, it has been decided to stop the collaboration with Allan,” says CEO Stéphane Heulot, “Lotto Dstny has its own values and standards which we apply in our daily work and in the team. We have a line that we do not deviate from and we require our employees to adhere to it. We prioritise the well-being and integrity of our team and a further collaboration was therefore impossible.”\n\nIn the meantime, the other sports directors are taking over Allan Davis’ duties and a solution is being sought for next season.\n\nNeither the team nor its employees will make any further comments on this statement.\n\nLotto Dstny and Allan Davis part ways:\n\nTeam Novo Nordisk and Novo Nordisk Confirm Three-Year Renewal of Historic Partnership\n\nThe world’s only all-diabetes professional cycling team is excited to confirm the extension of their successful partnership with principal sponsor Novo Nordisk for another three years carrying Team Novo Nordisk into 2026.\n\nIn 2021, Novo Nordisk and Team Novo Nordisk celebrated the discovery of insulin. This year, they celebrate their 10-year partnership anniversary as well as the 100th year anniversary of Novo Nordisk. The discovery of insulin and 100 years of innovation within diabetes management means that people living with diabetes now have the possibility to live out their dreams.\n\nThe extension of this partnership will allow Team Novo Nordisk to continue the important mission to inspire, educate and empower everyone affected by diabetes and show the world that diabetes doesn’t have to hold you back.\n\n“It’s already been a decade of success and life changing moments for us working together with an amazing partner like Novo Nordisk,” began CEO & Co-Founder Phil Southerland. “To be able to being a positive inspiration for people with diabetes for another three years is fantastic and it’s going to be spectacular.”\n\n“Our mission to inspire, educate and empower everyone around the world affected by diabetes is a mission that’s never ending. With our athletes racing all over the world from China and Japan, across Europe to the USA and Canada this year, we know our message is being spread and the impact the team has on every diabetes community in each country is a small step taken in the continuing journey to try and affect positive change for the near 500 million people living with diabetes around the world.”\n\nSince the last partnership extension in 2020 the team has gone from strength to strength. Celebrating the 100th anniversary of the discovery of insulin in 2021 with the landmark documentary Ride for your L1fe and team captain Andrea Peron’s first career victory in 2022 at GP Kranj in Slovenia. 2023 has marked the successful emergence of generational talents Matyas Kopecky and Filippo Ridolfo in the pro team alongside a growing ambassador program.\n\n“Our whole project continues to grow,” continued Southerland. “In 2024 we will have 20 senior pro riders, 12 development riders and an ever-expanding ambassador team of athletes from around the world competing in many different sports: from the track and field with 3 x time Chilean national 100m sprint champion Maria Ignacia Montt…to the ocean and multiple world paddle board champion Fiona Wylde all the way to the velodrome and the legendary US multi discipline national champ Mandy Marquardt.”\n\nThe next three years will see Team Novo Nordisk’ mission expanding once more to reach not only people affected with diabetes but with other serious chronic conditions around the world.\n\n“When diagnosed with a chronic condition many people think it means they won’t be able to live life the way they had hoped,” said Southerland. “With Novo Nordisk, we are ready to take on the challenge to prove that it might be possible to live the life of your dreams.”\n\n“I really want to take a moment, and give a sincere thanks to the leadership, and all the employees of Novo Nordisk,” concluded Southerland. “So often in their 100-year history as a company, they have invented a new reality for people with diabetes. And with this extension, Novo Nordisk clearly shows its desire to put patients at the center of everything they do.”\n\n“This is more than a traditional sponsorship. Team Novo Nordisk is a testament to all the employees of Novo Nordisk that live and breathe the ethos of doing what is best for people living with diabetes or with another chronic condition. I am both grateful for the opportunity and honoured that our heroes have the chance to fly the Novo Nordisk flag, as we continue driving change all around the world.”\n\n2021 Champion Wout van Aert Set for Tour of Britain Return\n\nBelgian star Wout van Aert is set to lead Jumbo – Visma at the Tour of Britain, two years on from claiming a memorable overall victory in the race.\n\nVan Aert made Tour history when he won four stages en route to being crowned the 2021 champion in what was the most successful debut for any rider in the UK’s leading cycle event.\n\nThe 28-year-old, who finished second in the UCI world championships road race in Glasgow earlier this month, has won nine Tour de France stages during his illustrious career to date.\n\nCompeting in the Tour for the 11th time, Jumbo – Visma are one of the most successful teams in race history.
