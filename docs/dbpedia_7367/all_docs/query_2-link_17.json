Typically, companies such as Sega would invest money in a sponsee, allowing them to fund their activities, in exchange for a prominent display of the brand or products Sega were trying to advertise.\n\nThe following lists instances where this has occurred. Not included are cases where Sega has helped established a venture (such as GameWorks or SegaWorld London), only to withdraw their name later on.\n\nFor official endorsements of Sega products by notable people, see Endorsements.\n\nSports\n\nNFL Players Party 1996/Super Bowl XXX\n\nSega sponsored the 1996 NFL Players Party, held at the Phoenix Civic Plaza on Thursday, January 28[1].

Sega were claiming that with incorporated NFL statistics, the game could predict outcomes with a 85-90% accuracy rate[1].\n\nNFL Players Party cards\n\nA set of 12 collectable cards were also released to commemorate the event. The set is unusual in that each card was produced by an entirely different trading card manufacturer, so no two cards share the same design (although they are all the same physical size).\n\nChecklist (front)\n\nChecklist (back)\n\nMorten Andersen (front)\n\nMorten Andersen (back)\n\nSteve Bono (front)\n\nSteve Bono (back)\n\nRobert Brooks (front)\n\nRobert Brooks (back)\n\nTim Brown (front)\n\nTim Brown (back)\n\nTony Dorsett (front)\n\nTony Dorsett (back)\n\nGus Frerotte (front)\n\nGus Frerotte (back)\n\nKevin Hardy (front)\n\nKevin Hardy (back)\n\nTyrone Hughes (front)\n\nTyrone Hughes (back)\n\nDan Marino (front)\n\nDan Marino (back)\n\nCurtis Martin (front)\n\nCurtis Martin (back)\n\nDeion Sanders (front)\n\nDeion Sanders (back)\n\n1997 NFL Players Party\n\n2001 Las Vegas Bowl\n\nSega (Sports) sponsored US college football's 2001 Las Vegas Bowl, featuring the Utah Utes and the USC Trojans.\n\nProgram\n\n2002 Las Vegas Bowl\n\nSega returned the following year to sponsor the 2002 Las Vegas Bowl, featuring the New Mexico Lobos and the UCLA Bruins.\n\nProgram\n\nBaseball\n\nBasketball\n\nLevallois Sporting Club Basket (France; 1993/1994)\n\nLevallois Sporting Club Basket team (1993/1994 Season), standing, from left to right: unknown man, assistant coach Sylvain Lautié, #7-Patrick Cham, #9-Michael Brooks, #15-Patrick Plantier, #12-Richard \"Rick\" Doyle, #8-Christian Garnier and head coach Jacques \"Jacky\" Renaud, crouching, from left to right: #14-Terence Stansbury, #11-Frédéric \"Freddy\" Hufnagel, #10-Michel Wachowiak, #6-Laurent Sénéchal and #5-Éric Fleury\n\nMichael Brooks of Levallois Sporting Club Basket blocks American professional basketball player Marcus Webb of Pau-based French professional basketball club Élan Béarnais, during a match of the 1993/94 Season of LNB Pro A, the top-tier level men's professional basketball league in France (Patrick Cham in the background)\n\nPatrick Cham\n\nTerence Stansbury\n\nMerchandise\n\nRAF Junior and Cadet leagues\n\n[4]\n\nCycling\n\nThe Sega British BMX Racing Championships 1990\n\nMain article: The Sega British BMX Racing Championships 1990.\n\nChateau d'Ax (Italy; 1993)\n\nIn 1993 Sega sponsored Italian professional cycling team Chateau d'Ax which included two-time World Road Cycling Champion Gianni Bugno (1991, 1992) and two-time Tour de France winner Laurent Fignon (1983, 1984), among others.
