The suit stems from a Times article published in June 2004 that repeated allegations made in the book, “LA Confidential: The Secrets of Lance Armstrong,” co-written by Walsh and Pierre Ballester and published in France.

Armstrong, 33, will continue his hugely-successful career with his new Discovery team, the nucleus of which comes from the U.S. Postal team, when the season begins.

With the UCI world road championships taking place in the Spanish capital of Madrid one week after the event, which starts on August 27 and ends on September 18, the race will be a meaty hors d'oeuvre and the riders will get a chance to check out the championship course over the final stretch in Madrid.

At 3239km, the course itself is 200km longer than this year’s race, with three stages over 200km (compared with one in 2004), six mountaintop stage finishes (the same), and three individual time trials (as opposed to two). The most significant change is the inclusion of the Vuelta in the UCI’s infamous ProTour.

He asked whether the seat height needed adjusting, and I said, “Nah, it’ll do,” drawing a chuckle from him in response. “Now I have to ride fast,” I said.

I recall racing in the rain in a crit next to a friend who was running cotton-cord sew up tires as opposed to my silks.

The Tour has ventured out of France before, but only within Western Europe and never before has it crossed the Atlantic Ocean. But with American Lance Armstrong having won the last six Tours and Québec looking to celebrate its founding in 1608 by Frenchman Samuel de Champlain, the project was examined. The conclusion, however, was that it would be too difficult to organize from a logistical point of view with scores of people, bikes and equipment to move and the time zone\n\nPearce-Ignatiev battle lights up LA World Cup\n\nIndoor track cycling, which was one of America’s most popular sports until World War II, is starting to rediscover its roots at the ADT Event Center in Carson, California.

And the new fans were on their feet at the end of the evening, cheering all the riders in the men’s 30km points race in which Colorado’s Colby Pearce almost pulled off a stunning victory against Russia’s immaculate Mikhael Ignatiev.

On the other side of the track was Jason Queally of Great Britain, the 2000 Olympic kilo champion, who was using this ride on the newest American indoor velodrome as a nice try-out before the world championships at this venue in March.

The team’s hope of becoming part of cycling’s top tier was hampered after Hamilton and two other of the squad's star riders failed doping tests this year.

Museeuw, who left competitive cycling in April, was banned along with Belgian racers Jo Planckaert and Chris Peers after being implicated in a police investigation last fall involving the distribution of banned substances involving a Belgian veterinarian. Despite clearing doping tests, authorities felt they had enough on the classics legend to issue the controversial racing ban.

Eschewing carbon, the Cobalt is a composite of a different kind: an aluminum base bonded to a stainless steel cover. Like all Crank Brothers products, the Cobalt combines a striking industrial aesthetic with hardcore cycling functionality. Andrew Herrick, who serves as Crank’s marketing guy (though not officially; the company does not use job titles) gave us the lowdown on how this unusual product was created.

The 30-year-old T-Mobile rider, who won the Tour in 1997 and finished second five times, is a time trial specialist who in previous years would have looked to the discipline to put time on his rivals. Next year, however, the Tour will feature one less time trial than usual when it begins with a 19km time trial instead of the usual short prologue. After a team time trial on the fourth stage, the next opportunity for Ullrich\n\nArmstrong hints he’ll skip ’05 Tour\n\nLance Armstrong is unsure if he will ride in next summer's Tour de France because he'd like to compete in other races. Armstrong, who won a record sixth straight Tour de France this year, said in Saturday's edition ofL'Equipe it is “time to move onto other things.” He has previously been somewhat evasive about whether he will return in 2005, but these were his strongest comments yet about his plans. “Honestly, I don't know if I will be at the start of the next Tour,” he told the sports newspaper. “There are a lot of other things I would like to do in cycling before retiring.

Erkaitz Elcoroiribe, team manager of Cafés Baqué, said the team will search for a new co-sponsor to step up. “What’s really sad about this situation is the marvelous team of riders, mechanics, massage therapists and other who could lose their job,” Elcoroiribe told the Spanish daily MARCA.

With the miniscule margins most bike companies have to work with, that’s not an easy task, especially considering that most of Ording’s competitors source their products in China, where labor and materials costs are but a fraction of Zipp’s. Moreover, in Ording’s quest to create the lightest, most advanced wheels and components possible, he does not shy away from expensive solutions.

Although the company’s longstanding domestic team programs made Trek a top brand among cycling fans many years ago, it was Postal power that put Trek on the map for a much wider base of casual riders. Today, Trek is a familiar name in millions of households worldwide, and the Trek brand has become the most valuable franchise in cycling.

According to the federation he died while out riding a bike with three friends at his birthplace of Bergen in the north west of the Netherlands. Knetemann's career spanned 15 years (1974-89) which saw him win 10 stages in the Tour de France and he was regarded as one of the finest classics riders in the world, winning the Amstel Gold Race twice and the Paris Nice once.

Just a month ago, he was coaching the Dutch national team at the world championships in Verona. The highlight for the 53-year-old cycling legend was the excellent performance of his teenage daughter, Roxanne Knetemann, who finished sixth in the junior women’s time trial and fifth in the road race (in which her teammates placed first and third) Then on Tuesday afternoon this week, just as Americans were going to the polls, Knetemann, a big man who always wore glasses, was out riding his mountain bike with three\n\nTrebon, Knapp great in Gloucester\n\nEver since its days as a stop on the Super Cup circuit, the Gloucester, Massachusetts, cyclo-cross race has been lovingly referred to as “New England Nationals.” The implication, that every rider worth his or her salt makes an annual October pilgrimage to the seaside Gloucester course, seemed borne out by the inclusion of back-to-back Gloucester races in this year’s Crank Brothers U.S. Gran Prix of Cyclo-cross.\n\nPerez maintains his innocence\n\nVuelta a España runner-up Santiago Perez declared his innocenceof blood doping on Sunday, just weeks after his American Phonak teammateTyler Hamilton apparently failed a similar test. \"The news I have been given is that they have detected irregularitiesin my blood as a consequence of a transfusion from another person,\" Perezsaid. \"All I can say is that I have not undergone any type of blood transfusion.

The daily suggests that the result may have come from the A sample in an out-of-competition test, adding that it is not yet certain whether the alleged blood doping involved the transfusion of Perez’ own blood or the blood of another.

The 37-year-old sprinter, who holds the record for the most number of Giro d'Italia stage wins with 42, has been plagued by injury over the past two years. He pulled out of the Giro this year after crashing and then quit the Tour de France because of a thigh injury.

In a bid to open the race and widen the possibilities for other contenders, Tour chiefs have cut down on the mountain finishes and individual time trials for next year's race. Organizers have yet to decide whether the race should include 21 or 22 teams of nine riders each.

Then again, Armstrong’s spokesman at the official race presentation in Paris on Thursday, Discovery Channel team director Johan Bruyneel, said, “If he does a three-week race, it will be the Tour.” And one can’t see Armstrong being motivated by a season that comprises just one-day classics mixed in with a few one-week stage races.
