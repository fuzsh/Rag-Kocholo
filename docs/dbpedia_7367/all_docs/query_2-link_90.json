        "text": "This paper examines the Olympic Movement in Turkey during the late Ottoman State (1896–1921). The Ottoman Empire had diplomatic and political links with Olympism from the first Games of the Modern era. From the start of the 20th century it began to make official contacts with the Olympic Movement. Turkey was not officially represented at the 1896, 1900, or 1904 Games. The first official contact with the Olympic Movement came when Mihran Kavafyan Efendi was sent as a delegate to the 1905 IOC Congress in Brussels by the Ottoman government. A significant number of athletes and officials participated in the 1906 Olympic Games, although these remain unrecognised by the IOC. Two athletes from Turkey do appear in the official report of the Olympic Games in London 1908, but only one of them took part in the competitions. It is hard to view this official participation because this was a time when the Turkish Olympic Committee had not yet been established, nor was there a Turkish member of the IOC. Immediately after the declaration of the Second Constitution in July 1908, Selim Sırrı Tarcan, who pioneered the Olympic Movement in Turkey, set about establishing a Turkish Olympic Committee (TOC). On 15 December 1908, he was co-opted as the IOC Member in Turkey. The Ottoman government recognised the TOC in the following year although formal recognition by the IOC did not come until 1911. Tarcan set about promoting the Olympic spirit and phi lo sophy of Olympism amongst the newly established Turkish sports organizations. He used the ideas he had absorbed at IOC meetings in the years before the First World War. As a result of his activities, two Armenian athletes represented Turkey, during the Ottoman Empire period, for the first and only time at the 1912 Stockholm Games.\n\nThe purpose of our work is to determine the effects of the first and second period globalization processes on the sports institutions of the Ottoman State. This aim is to be able to explain the tendency of the globalization which emerged as a continuation of each other in accordance with the spirit of the era of the Turkish sport institutions. Globalization is a very influential phenomenon on the changes of states, social and economic institutions. Globalization; can be regarded as a concept that deals with a wide variety of disciplines and markets, and establishes relationships that influence and interfere with these disciplines and markets. From this perspective, it is also a fact that the effects of countries on sports institutions are inevitable. In the study, a qualitative method called \"descriptive field scanning\", documentary or documentary study was followed. In this way, our research has been structured by the historical research method and the historical survey method with qualitative research in terms of content. Historical research methodology has been supported by archival scanning method based on reviewing, translating, reading and evaluating books, documents, files, official and private correspondence documents, foreign language information and documents The sports schools of the Ottoman state's sports institutions were weakened by the loss of their importance by being negatively affected as the economic aims of the establishment causes with the change of trade routes in the first globalization process. In the second globalization process; despite the fact that the Ottoman state was in its recent times, it tried to adapt to the socio-economic changes brought about by Globalization. At the end of this effort, importance has been given to sports and sports institutions in education, social life. He transferred both the sports institutions and the sports workforce to the state of the Republic of Turkey, which is the continuation of the Ottoman state.\n\nTurkey in the Late Ottoman period was the scene of the quests for and the efforts to indoctrinate modernization based on Western models. In this period and in all areas, modernization movements developed in physical education, gymnastics and sports, and leaders guiding such movements emerged. Selim Sιrrι Tarcan, the pioneer of physical education, modern sports and the Olympic Movement in Turkey, was appointed to key positions in which he helped physical education to be incorporated into public and military school curricula. He used his passion for sports, which started to grow from an early age, and his knowledge, which he acquired through his national and international education, and then spread on in his effort to disseminate the philosophy of Olympism across Turkey by the Olympic mission he undertook. Although his activities often faced resistance by traditional structures, Tarcan contributed greatly to the indoctrination of the concept of Olympics, and the at least Istanbul-based adoption of the Olympic Movement. One of the tools used by Selim Sιrrι Tarcan to create consciousness and awareness in contemporary physical education, sports and the Olympic Movement were periodicals and other publications. He already began to write articles in newspapers and journals and to publish books before 1908, the year in which the second constitutional period began. He increasingly continued these activities after that period, particularly after returning from Sweden, where he studied gymnastics. The most important of his publication activities was undoubtedly Terbiye ve Oyun (Education and Games), Turkey’s first scientific and pedagogical sports journal, which he started to publish as from 1911. In this study, the contributions of Terbiye ve Oyun, published during the period of 1911–1912 and 1922–1923, to the Olympic movement, which is obliged to disseminate sports, a tool to achieve holistic development of people, by a variety of activities, will be addressed.\n\nThis study seeks to investigate whether there have been any political impacts or not on the selection process of sports mega events (SMEs) in Turkey along with examples in the world and a historical record of the host nations. The SMEs are huge organizations that have been held since the very beginning of the 20 th century in various sports branches including football, volleyball and the Olympic Games. Though the selection process of the SMEs are carried out with some certain rules and principles among which are human rights issue, democracy, transportation, security and creating a unifying force for all people in the world, not everybody is satisfied with the outcomes as it is believed that the selection process is somehow under the influence of political figures or powers. Based on the findings of this study, it is seen that Hitler used the Olympic Games and the World Cup for propaganda which caused a lot of controversy while the selection of Russia, Qatar and China for hosting various SMEs led to dissatisfaction related to the outcomes. As a result of the study, it was determined that Turkey was not exposed to any discrimination against being selected the host nation for three Olympic Games in contrast to general belief by a majority of people and that in fact Turkey was awarded to host a myriad of organizations including the Mediterranean Games, Universiade, UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europe League Final. Öz: Bu çalışmanın amacı dünyadaki örnekler ve ev sahibi ülkelerinde ilişkin tarihi kayıtlarıyla birlikte Türkiye'deki mega spor etkinliklerinin (MSE) seçimi üzerine politik etkilerin var olup olmadığını araştırmaktır. MSEler, aralarında futbol, voleybol ve Olimpiyat Oyunları'nın da olduğu çeşitli spor dallarında 20. Yüzyılın en başından i MEGA SPOR ETKİNLİKLERİNDE POLİTİK ÇIKARLAR: TÜRKİYE'DEKİ DURUM 47 itibaren düzenlenen büyük organizasyonlardır. MSElerin seçim süreci, aralarında insan hakları hususu, demokrasi, ulaşım, güvenlik ve tüm dünyadaki insanları bir araya getirecek birleştirici güç oluşturma kavramının olduğu belirli kural ve ilkeler doğrultusunda gerçekleştirilmesine karşın seçim sürecinin politik kişi ve güçleri tarafından etki altına alındığı düşüncesinden dolayı herkes sonuçlardan memnun değildir. Bu çalışmanın bulgularına dayalı olarak, Hitler'in Olimpiyatları ve Dünya Kupası'nı tartışmalara sebep olacak şekilde propaganda aracı olarak kullandığı ve Rusya, Katar ve Çin'in çeşitli organizasyonları ev sahipliği yapmaya hak kazanmasının sonuçlara ilişkin memnuniyetsizlik oluşturduğu görülmektedir. Bu çalışmanın bir sonucu olarak, Türkiye'nin genel görüşün aksine Olimpiyat Oyunlarına ev sahipliği yapmak üzere gerçekleştirmiş olduğu üç başvuruda ayrımcılığa uğramadığı ve esasen Türkiye'nin Akdeniz Oyunları, Universiade, UEFA Şampiyonlar Ligi ve UEFA Avrupa Ligi Finalleri gibi birçok etkinliğe ev sahipliği yapmaya hak kazandığı belirlenmiştir.\n\nThe young Republic of Turkey paid attention to physical training system of Soviet Russia with whom she maintained relationship in terms of foreign policy since the years of War of Independence. Delegations were sent to Russia to investigate this system in 1930s. The aim was to establish the strategy to be adopted for physical training issue in Turkey. According to impressions of Turkish delegation, the year 1928 is a kind of revolution in Russia in terms of physical activities. This is due mainly to the declaration of central bureau of the party regarding improper functioning of physical training activities within the boundaries of the state. They expressed that this fact contradicted the party activities. That is why they constituted an investigation committee. The committee initiated its activities in Moscow Institute. The purpose of physical training in Soviet Union was not only sports. As it is inferred from the first five-year physical training plan and practices, educating staff who were capable of teaching, managing and imposing the principles of the party ideally was the basic objective of the physical training. Millions of laborers working in factories and the youth working in all of public institutions and army were tried to be directed towards sports and combined in these activities. Turkish delegations organized trips to Russia with the aim of investigation between years 1934 and 1937. It is clear that these reports had an effect on central structuring of Turkish Sports Institute in 1936 (after its foundation) and the foundation of Village Institutes in 1940. This study deals with physical culture system of Soviet Union in accordance with the impressions of Turkish delegation derived from their trip to Russia between 10th of July and 20th of August in 1933.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the physical education and sports studies and institutional structuring, the developments before and during Turkey Training Community Alliance (TTCA) Period in the framework of social demands within the historical process. In the study, the screening model was taken as a basis, historical and descriptive methods were used. The periodicals belonging to the period of 1922-1936 were reviewed to address how TTCA activities in physical education and sport had influenced the social life, and what sort of discussions had been made about the subject. As a result, the physical education and sport are thought to be used as suitable tools for providing the physical and spiritual development as well as fulfilling the functions which would create powerful community; and it's seen that the effort was made to practice those ideas as much as possible."
