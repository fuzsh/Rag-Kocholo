        "text": "OTTAWA, ON (September 29, 2021) — Canoe Kayak Canada (CKC) announces the retirement of Chief Technical Officer (CTO), Graham Barton following five years with the organization after returning from Own The Podium. Ian Mortimer will be assuming the role of CTO in leading the technical side of the organization effective October 1, 2021.\n\n“As a coach, High Performance Director, High Performance Advisor and more recently as Chief Technical Officer, I have had the pleasure of meeting and working with some amazing people,” said Barton. “I want to thank those who motivated me, those that mentored me and those who supported me. None of our success could have been possible without a great team behind the team and I want to thank all the people I have worked with over the years who through their support and hard work made Canoe Kayak Canada one of the leading organizations in Canadian sport. It is hard to say goodbye after dedicating your life to sport. I will miss it, but I leave with the comforting knowledge that our athletes and our system are in good hands with the new leadership team. I wish them and all our athletes all the best as they prepare for Paris 2024 and beyond.”\n\nWith over 40 years of experience in the sport system, Barton led multiple Canadian paddling teams to international success, including the most recent Tokyo 2020 podium finishers in women’s canoe, Katie Vincent and Laurence Vincent Lapointe, and four world champions at the Senior/U23/Junior World Championships.\n\nBarton built his legacy on the foundation that excellence is a process and a collaborative effort amongst many partners.\n\n“We send Graham off with mixed emotions as he has done such a tremendous job re-setting and restabilizing the organization’s high performance program,” said Casey Wade, CKC’s Chief Executive Officer. “Graham left CKC in 2009 as a very talented High Performance Director and returned as a truly exceptional CTO.”\n\nIan Mortimer will take over from Graham Barton as of October 1, 2021. Ian, a former national team canoer, has been part of CKC’s leadership team since 2014 leading and driving the development side of the organization.\n\n“It’s truly an honour to continue to work with our entire Canoe Kayak Canada community to build not just world class performances, but a community where all feel welcome and both paddlers young and old can work towards their goals and enjoy our sport,” said Mortimer. “The response to the COVID-19 pandemic within our community, and the resilience of our national team paddlers has been exemplary through these exceedingly tough times. It has underscored for me how special of a sport we have. By working together, our potential is sky high and I am excited for the challenge ahead and seeing our athletes break through to the very highest levels of our sport and reaching the World Championship, Olympic and Paralympic podium.”\n\n“Ian has proven to be an emerging leader both within CKC and the Canadian sport system. He has remarkable leadership and communication skills that will be critical in empowering our team to be among the best in the world,” said Wade. “I have no doubt that Ian will continue to build a culture of excellence that is supportive of people performing at their best.”\n\nAs the Chief Technical Officer, Mortimer will head Canoe Kayak Canada’s High-Performance strategy and National Team Programs in collaboration with coaches, athletes, officials, clubs and funding partners. He will lead the strategic long-term technical plan to ensure sustainable success across the system, including our Team Red development program.\n\nMortimer will work as part of the senior management leadership team, including a close partnership with Head Coach, Anders Gustafsson, and our world class coaching team. It is critical that this team works to ensure success throughout the system, stemming from the grassroots and club level, and progressing to the highest levels of competition.\n\nThe CKC Board of Directors and staff wish Graham Barton the very best in his retirement and congratulate Ian Mortimer on his new role.\n\nAbout Canoe Kayak Canada\n\nCanoe Kayak Canada is the national governing body for competitive paddling in Canada.

For others, Nationals has long served as a celebration of our sport, and a homecoming for friends from coast to coast.\n\nThe 2021 Nationals will look and feel a bit different, but we are committed to making the 2021 Event a truly fantastic experience – one that will reflect how far we’ve come in being able to hold a Championship in 2021.\n\nOur returning Olympians, the combination of National Team Trials, and so many new and young athletes racing at Nationals will all guarantee an incredible week.\n\nAs a competing athlete, official, coach, parent, grandparent, volunteer or spectator, all of you will make a difference in how our event goes.\n\nThe following information should help to ensure your visit to Ottawa is a successful one!\n\nHere’s what you need to know:\n\nSPECTATORS AND VIEWING AREAS\n\nYes! Spectators will be allowed at the 2021 CKC Sprint Nationals. The primary viewing area will be located on the east side of Mooney’s Bay at the finish line. The area will include a large covered spectator viewing tent for inclement weather. In addition, there will be food services onsite and washroom facilities. This will be the area closest to the action, and where medal presentations will be held for our athletes.\n\nPlease note that when in the Spectator area, spectators will be required to fill out the CKC App for tracking. Social distancing guidelines will also be in place and it is expected, masks will be required when spectators are not eating or drinking.\n\nInformally, there will also be a spectator area at the end of the race course. It is important to note this small park area will have limited capacity.\n\nFor people familiar with previous National Championships or Regattas held at Mooney’s Bay, the Mooney’s Bay park area will be off limits to all spectators. This area will serve as a restricted access area for athletes only.\n\nFor these reasons, no personal spectator tents will be permitted at either the official spectator area or unofficial park viewing area at the end of the course.\n\nThe organizing committee will be providing a large covered area at the finish line for rain and shade. For safety and viewing purposes, there is simply not room for additional tents.\n\nPlease also note the Rideau Canoe Club will be off limits for all spectators and athletes, and will be an officials and volunteer zone only. Spectating will not be possible from the Rideau Canoe Club (west) side of the venue)\n\nACCOMMODATION\n\nThe Host Organizing Committee is working with HTG Sports for hotel group booking discounts:\n\nIndividuals can book hotel rooms at the following:\n\nhttps://secure.htgsports.com/HRMS.nsf/HotelConfirmedInEvent?OpenForm&ParentUNID=A8CAB83BE076F29B852585AE004E6D57&lang=en\n\nWe would encourage group bookings for clubs, and organizations booking more than 10 rooms you can use the following link:\n\nhttps://secure.htgsports.com/registration.nsf/BTSRP_EventAccess?OpenForm&eventid=A8CAB83BE076F29B852585AE004E6D57&lang=en\n\nHTG is an event partner, and the HOC would appreciate your support in booking hotels.\n\nPARKING AND ATHLETE TRANSPORTATION\n\nThere will be onsite paid parking at Mooney’s Bay for athletes and spectators. The HOC has secured the parking area directly beside the spectator area and entrance to the Athlete Village. This will be the location where all athletes must enter the property, and will provide all spectators with the easiest access to spectator areas.\n\nThis will be the only facility offering a single-fee full day parking pass, and in and out privileges.\n\nFor athlete “drop-off” at the venue, a “quick stop” process will be in place to ensure athletes can enter the site as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n\nThe location can be access from Hog’s Back Road, on the south side, just east of Hog’s Back Bridge and the Canal Driveway. Watch for volunteers.\n\nWith morning and afternoon cohorts, this will be a busy spot. Still, we will have large volunteer team in place to ensure our athletes and spectators can get in and out quickly and safely. This will be the only entrance into the venue.\n\nATHLETES VILLAGE\n\nTo ensure the safety and security of our competitors, when in competition, all athletes will stay within the secure “Athletes Village”. This is the grass area in Mooney’s Bay Park facing the race course. Please note that only athletes racing in a morning or afternoon cohort will be permitted access to the club areas of the athlete village.\n\nPlease note, to accommodate practice time for athletes not competing in National Team Trials on August 23, 24 and 25, there will be restricted access permitted to allow practicing athletes to grab their boat, and enter the water at the south end of the facility. This will be done on a club by club basis in reserved time slots and coordinated through club coaches.\n\nFOOD AND WATER FOR ATHLETES AND SPECTATORS\n\nWhile there will be some food services available in the Spectator area, please note there will no food services and limited water access in the Athletes Village.\n\nGiven Covid restrictions, shared water access via fountains and refill stations is not permitted.\n\nWhile athletes will only be permitted to be in the Village area for a morning or afternoon session, it is strongly advised athletes plan ahead for both personal hydration and nutritional requirements.\n\nThere will be plenty of washroom facilities in the Athletes Village area, including both accessible and gender divided facilities.\n\nOTTAWA (July 7, 2021) – Canoe Kayak Canada and the Canadian Olympic Committee have announced Canada’s canoe/kayak sprint team nominated to compete at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.\n\nThe 16 paddlers are nominated for Team Canada based on their performances at the 2019 World Canoe Sprint Championships in Hungary, the CKC Olympic trials in Burnaby, B.C. and multiple internal performance assessments conducted in Canada.\n\nWomen’s canoe will make its Olympic debut in Tokyo, making the sprint program gender equal, with both men and women competing in four kayak events and two canoe events.\n\nCanada will be well represented in this new Olympic event by multi-time world champions Laurence Vincent Lapointe and Katie Vincent. The duo won gold at the 2018 World Championships, smashing their own world record in the C-2 500m event. Vincent Lapointe took home two additional gold medals at that event in the C-1 200m and C-1 5000m.\n\n“I feel a lot of love and support from the community in these final moments ahead of the women’s canoe debut,” said Vincent. “When the starter says ‘go’ in Tokyo, it will be a moment I hope all Canadians and paddlers will celebrate. It is hard not to reflect on the journey to get here but beyond the results, it’s been the wildest, most rewarding year of my life. These Olympic Games will be an opportunity to celebrate and reap the rewards of our hard work, resilience and dedication. We can’t control the outcome but we can commit to doing our best and leaving it all on the water.”\n\nTeam veteran Mark de Jonge, who won K-1 200m bronze at London 2012, will compete in his third Olympic Games. The Nova Scotia -born paddler qualified for Tokyo while competing in the men’s K-4 Olympic trials race-off with teammates Nicholas Matveev, Pierre-Luc Poulin and Simon McTavish.\n\n“It’s a huge relief to finally be nominated to the Canadian Olympic Team after five years of preparation and a lot of uncertainty over the past year,” said de Jonge. “I’m so proud of our team for staying strong through the rough patches and I am confident that our resilience and hard work will pay off when we compete in Tokyo.”\n\nAndréanne Langlois will be returning for her second Olympic Games, after competing at Rio 2016 in two kayak events – K-1 200m and K-4 500m. Langlois won four medals at the Lima 2019 Pan American Games including two gold in the women’s K-2 and K-4 events.\n\n“I believe we have an extremely strong team going to Tokyo,” said Canoe Kayak Canada’s Chief Technical Officer, Graham Barton. “We have been able to keep our athletes on the water throughout a challenging 18 months and while our Olympic nominees have not been able to compete internationally during that time, our assessments at Olympic Team Trials and throughout our preparation indicate that we are on track in each of our events. Tokyo will just be one more bubble experience that we have become accustomed to, so it won’t be a distraction. I know they are looking forward to the start of competition on August 2 and will proudly represent the maple leaf.”\n\nCanadian paddlers have been winning Olympic medals since the sport made its debut at Berlin 1936. Canada’s biggest medal haul came at Los Angeles 1984 where six medals were won, including two gold, from Larry Cain in the C-1 500m and Alwyn Morris and Hugh Fisher in the K-2 1000m. Cain added a silver in the C-1 1000m while Morris and Fisher also won bronze in the K-2 500m. These were also the first Olympic Games at which Canadian women won kayak medals, taking silver in the K-2 500m and bronze in the K-4 500m, 36 years after women’s kayak events were first included on the Olympic program. The most notable women’s kayaker, Caroline Brunet, won three straight medals in the K-1 500m at Atlanta 1996, Sydney 2000 and Athens 2004.\n\nTeam Canada’s most recent Olympic medals in canoe/kayak sprint came at London 2012 where Adam van Koeverden won his fourth Olympic medal in men’s kayak. Mark De Jonge won a bronze in men’s K-1 200m while Mark Oldershaw won bronze in the C-1 1000m.\n\nCanoe/kayak sprint will take place August 2 to 7 (Days 10 to 15) at the Sea Forest Waterway.\n\nCanadian sprint event entries will be finalized closer to the event start date.\n\n“Fun fact, the C- in C-1 and C-2 doesn’t stand for Canoe, it stands for Canadian! I’m so stoked that we have such strong paddlers, including for the first time, female canoeists, in the Canadian and Kayak events!”, said Team Canada’s Tokyo 2020 Chef de Mission, Marnie McBean.\n\nThe athletes nominated are:\n\nWomen’s Canoe\n\nKatie Vincent (Mississauga Canoe Club)\n\nLaurence Vincent Lapointe (Trois-Rivières Canoe-Kayak Club)\n\nMen’s Canoe\n\nConnor Fitzpatrick (Senobe Aquatic Club)\n\nRoland Varga (Richmond Hill Canoe Club)\n\nWomen’s Kayak\n\nAlanna Bray-Lougheed (Burloak Canoe Club)\n\nAndréanne Langlois (Club de canoë-kayak de Trois-Rivières)\n\nCourtney Stott (Balmy Beach Canoe Club)\n\nLissa Bissonnette (Point-Claire Canoe Kayak Club)\n\nMadeline Schmidt (Rideau Canoe Club))\n\nMichelle Russell (Cheema Aquatic Club)\n\nMen’s Kayak\n\nBrian Malfesi (Ridge Canoe and Kayak Club)\n\nMark de Jonge (Maskwa Aquatic Club)\n\nNicholas Matveev (Balmy Beach Canoe Club)\n\nPierre-Luc Poulin (Lac-Beauport Canoe Club)\n\nSimon McTavish (Mississauga Canoe Club)\n\nVincent Jourdenais (Club de canoe-kayak de vitesse de Trois-Rivieres)\n\nThe coaches nominated are:\n\nAnders Gustaffson (Jönköping, Sweden)\n\nChad Brooks (Lake Echo, Nova Scotia)\n\nJon Pike (Dartmouth, Nova Scotia)\n\nMark Granger (Lachine, Québec)\n\nMathieu Pelletier (Trois-Rivières, Québec)\n\nPrior to being named to Team Canada, all nominations are subject to approval by the Canadian Olympic Committee’s Team Selection Committee following its receipt of nominations by all National Sport Organizations.\n\nThe latest Team Canada Tokyo 2020 roster can be found here and the qualification tracker can be found here.\n\n-30-\n\nMEDIA CONTACTS:\n\nColleen Coderre, Communications Lead\n\nCanoe Kayak Canada\n\nC: 613-530-6217\n\nE: ccoderre@canoekayak.ca\n\nJosh Su, Specialist, Public Relations\n\nCanadian Olympic Committee\n\nC: 647-464-4060\n\nE: jsu@olympic.ca\n\nOttawa, July 2, 2021 – As provinces across Canada continue positive steps forward in recovering from the COVID-19 Pandemic, Canoe Kayak Canada and the Rideau Canoe Club announced today that they will move forward with plans to host the 2021 Canoe Kayak Canada Sprint National Championships on Mooney’s Bay from August 23rd–29th, 2021.\n\n“The Host Organizing Committee recognizes the invaluable impact Nationals will have for the mental health of our young athletes. This event will provide much needed motivation for these athletes in their training throughout the summer” said Dr. Anna Wilkinson, Co-Chair, 2021 CKC Sprint National Championships Host Organizing Committee. “We have leveraged the experience gained by Canoe Kayak Canada in running Olympic Trials to create a comprehensive plan for a safe event should the Province of Ontario continue on the current path to re-opening.”\n\n“Over the past several months, we have remained in constant contact with officials at the City of Ottawa and have worked to develop protocols that will ensure a safe event aligned with public health measures,” said Canoe Kayak Canada Director of Development, Ian Mortimer. “While we understand if there is an unfortunate step back in a national Covid recovery we may not be able to host the event, we are extremely hopeful, and are planning accordingly. Athletes across the country have missed nearly two years of competition, and for their benefit, we are committed to doing everything we can to host a safe national event”.\n\nWhile final race and event details will reflect public health guidelines at the time of the event, athletes can expect some modifications to a traditional “Nationals”. Race events and qualifications will be limited to singles boats, and the National Championships will incorporate the previously postponed 2021 National Team Trials. In addition, age specific cohorts (i.e. U18, U17, U16) have been introduced to provide more qualifying opportunities for athletes across the country.\n\nThe Sprint National Championships will also serve as an important selection opportunity for athletes to earn a nomination to one or more international competitions in September. “The Junior & U23 Worlds, Olympic Hopes Regatta and the Senior World Championships are all extremely important competitions for our athletes preparing for Paris 2024 in what is a shortened Olympic cycle due to Covid.” said Chief Technical Officer, Graham Barton. “With Tokyo in the rear-view mirror and no international competitions for these athletes for two full summers, the global competition experience this Fall lays the foundation for success in Paris and Los Angeles.”\n\nThe Host Organizing Committee and Canoe Kayak Canada have developed a safety plan consistent with public health guidelines. Current plans will ensure participants will be in zones with controlled access to allow for proper physical distancing. To accomplish this, race days will be split by age and gender to ensure a limited number of competitors in the event area at any given time. As there may not be spectator areas, Canoe Kayak Canada is planning a livestream similar to what was produced for the 2021 Olympic Team Trials in Burnaby, BC earlier this year. The venue will also be designed to allow for modifications if changes to public health guidelines change over the next two months.\n\nIt is still expected Canada’s returning Olympic Canoe and Kayak athletes will be able to return from Tokyo and compete in Ottawa for their home clubs. As many as 50 Clubs, from across Canada will have athletes competing in qualifying regattas across Canada to earn the right to compete in Ottawa.\n\nOttawa Tourism has also announced that it will continue in a lead partner role for the event. “The 2021 Canoe Kayak Canada Sprint National Championships will mark an important milestone for Ottawa as sporting events return to our community”, said Michael Crockatt, President and CEO of Ottawa Tourism. “Ottawa Tourism is proud to play a leadership role in supporting this event, and we look forward to working with the Rideau Canoe Club, Canoe Kayak Canada, and local community business partners, to make the Championships a success”\n\n– – o – –\n\nAbout the Rideau Canoe Club\n\nThe Rideau Canoe Club is one of Canada’s oldest canoe clubs, and one of the City of Ottawa’s longest continually operating sports facilities. Rideau Canoe Club Paddlers have been racing on the Rideau Canal and Mooney’s Bay since 1902. We acknowledge the Rideau Canoe Club resides on the traditional unceded land of the Algonquin Anishnabeg peoples, and the waters on which our paddlers compete has been used for centuries as a route to connect Indigenous peoples across North America.\n\nOver the past 118 years, the Rideau Canoe Club has produced 10 Olympians, and Rideau athletes have won the Sprint Canoe and Kayak National Club Championship Burgee 9 times. In 2019, 10 Rideau athletes competed for Canada internationally, and won 8 medals at the Commonwealth Games, Junior World Championships and Olympic Hopes Regatta. Rideau is currently the two-time defending National Champions, having won the 2019 Burgee in Regina, SK.\n\nFor more information contact:\n\nScott Bradley\n\nCo-Chair, 2021 Canoe Kayak Canada Sprint National Championships\n\nscott.bradley@rideaucanoeclub.ca\n\n343.549.5333\n\nThe following is an update for our sprint racing community regarding plans for hosting the CKC Sprint Nationals Championships and Selection Trials scheduled for August 23rd to 29th.\n\nThe event will be named the 2021 Canadian Sprint Canoe Kayak Championships.\n\nDecision Making Overview\n\nThe parameters around these events related to COVID-19 prevention measures and restrictions continue to be an evolving reality. The intention with this communication is to provide an overview of the current status and the COVID-19 review of these events.\n\nThe following stakeholders were engaged for expertise and feedback in the risk review process: Chief Medical Officer, CKC legal counsel, Volunteer Leadership and Athlete Reps, our partner Host Organizing Committee, government authorities and of course CKC staff.\n\nOur Decision Timelines\n\nCompleted (June 8, 2021) – Meeting #1 with Covid Task Force and Athlete Reps for consultation\n\nCompleted (June 28, 2021) – Meeting #2 with Covid Task Force and Athlete Reps for consultation\n\nJune 30/July 1, 2021 – Decision on 2021 National Championships and next steps\n\nLocation decision\n\nAfter completing our Risk Assessment of the event, CKC is moving forward with the plan for the 2021 Canadian Sprint Canoe Kayak Championships to be held at the Rideau Canoe Club in Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nAn important note for our members: we have received positive feedback from appropriate authorities on our protocols, safety plan, and event but we have yet to receive formal approval of the event from Ottawa Public Health and therefore the city.\n\nWe would like to thank CKQ for their continued support through the process of securing Montreal as the backup location and all the processes and protocols there. We would also like to thank the Atlantic Division for offering to host this regatta.\n\nPurpose\n\nDue to Covid-19 and unique for 2021 Canadian Sprint Canoe Kayak Championships will not only crown national champions but will also be used as part of the AAP Selection process and to identify athletes for the following international competitions:\n\nJunior & Under 23 World Championships (September 3-6, Portugal\n\nOlympics Hopes Regatta (September 10-12, Czech Republic)\n\nSprint and Paracanoe Senior World Championships (September 16-19, Denmark)\n\nThe events that will be part of these Championships can be found in Appendix A.\n\nLogistics Travel/Accommodation booking\n\nWe believe that the formal approval will come as the restrictions ease into July and therefore we recommend that any flights needing to be booked should be assured they are refundable or to wait until we have an official approval of the event. Information around hotel booking will come out shortly from the Organizing Committee and the recommendation would be to ensure that any accommodation booked for the event would be fully refundable until we have official approval.\n\nThe Rideau Host Organizing has partnered with HTG to coordinate Hotel Books for the event. The following links can be used to book rooms in convenient hotels.\n\nBelow is the link that allows everyone to book one room and up to 10 at a time: Individual booking link\n\nFor larger clubs want to book more than 10 rooms we request they use this link which allows them to request as many as they need: Large block link\n\nBased on Proximity to the race course and parking, we would advise using the airport hotels on Hunt Club/Gibford/Paul Anka Drive – The Hampton Inn, Homewood Suites and Holiday Inn Express. There are restaurants in the parking lot, and a mall not far away. The other strong recommendation is the Sandman Hotel on Hunt Club. Further details will follow from the Host Organizing Committee.\n\nSchedule & Events\n\nEvents & Race card\n\nThe events to be raced at the 2021 Nationals are in Appendix A. The proposed race card is in Appendix B.\n\nQualification & Entries\n\nEntries will be granted based on divisional qualification, followed by an allotted number of random entries allocated as per modified Nationals rulebook, followed by a small number of wild cards to be in reserve to be able to allocate based on a performance recommendation and extenuating circumstances (if necessary, details to be communicated in the coming weeks). Please refer to Appendix C for the initial proposal. The number of entries is also based on the proposal submitted and yet to be approved by Public Health. In the case adjustments need to be made given the number allowed onsite we will update with the final qualification in the coming weeks.\n\nRace Fees\n\nDue to the increased costs around COVID safety protocols, the combination of the events and other circumstances to ensure this event proceeds to the highest possible standard, the race fees will be $100 per entered event, to a maximum of $400 per competitor. This is a unique circumstance, and one we hope will be unique to this year with the COVID protocols.\n\nRules for the National Championships\n\nModified ICF rules during the competition will be applied to the races at the 2021 Canadian Sprint Canoe Kayak National Championships, even in those events that are solely run as a Nationals event to allow for consistency of application for officials, coaches and athletes across the full competition. Advancement from heats to semi finals to finals will be according to modified ICF rules where those events are indicated. Where there are no semifinals, standard or modified rules according to the rulebook will be applied and will be communicated in the coming weeks.\n\nFurther updates to the rules being applied for all aspects of the competition, or the modification of those rules, for the 2021 Canadian Sprint Canoe Kayak National Championships will be communicated in the coming weeks.\n\nCoaches per cohort\n\nWith the limitations on number of participants on site in a zone, there may be cases where the number of coaches desired may not be able to be accommodated.

The women’s K-4 500m team also booked their ticket to Tokyo* today with impressive back-to-back final wins in Burnaby.\n\nIt was an exhilarating day of racing with the women’s K-4 crews kicking off racing for Olympic qualification. Alanna Bray-Lougheed (Burloak Canoe Club), Andréanne Langlois (Club de canoe-kayak de vitesse de Trois-Rivieres), Michelle Russell (Cheema Aquatic Club), and Madeline Schmidt (Rideau Canoe Club) won their second K-4 500m finals of the CKC Olympic and Paralympic Sprint Team Trials, securing their nomination for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.\n\n“I think we had the first race jitters yesterday, got those over with, and then today we just put it all together,” said Russell. This event marking the first racing opportunity for the team in almost two years due to the pandemic. “Covid-19 made us learn a lot about ourselves and made us tougher as athletes and as people too,” added Langlois. “We have trained in every weather condition – hail, snow, giant waves,” said Schmidt. “It has definitely brought us closer together as a team.”\n\nLater in the morning, the Women’s C1 200m final got off to a clean start with 10-time World Champion, Laurence Vincent Lapointe (Club de canoe-kayak de vitesse de Trois-Rivieres) looking to add to her race win from Thursday. Meanwhile, Katie Vincent (Mississauga Canoe Club), who secured Canada’s berth at the 2019 World Championships, was just as hungry for the opportunity, stealing the second race win in a nail-biter photo finish across the line.\n\nThe C1 200m tie forced a race-off between the Katie and Laurence at 2pm PT. The Canadian duo lined up again to deliver yet another heart pounding performance with Katie taking the final win with only millimeters separating the two boats. Results\n\n“It’s hard to put into words (how I’m feeling) right now,” said Katie Vincent. “It’s my birthday today and I can’t imagine a better birthday present than this. It was a fight right until the end and a positive takeaway for our team that we have such a strong field of female paddlers. Four years ago, we had no group to train with and look at us now. We can take pride in the team that we’ve built and I look forward to getting in the boat with Laurence to race the C2 500m event tomorrow. It’s fun to go fast!”\n\n“We are so thrilled to see two of the best paddlers in the world racing together after such a long hiatus and a challenging period of time,” said Casey Wade, CKC Chief Executive Officer. “With respect to the women’s C2 500m event, we continue to work closely with the International Canoe Federation to secure an additional women’s canoe Olympic quota spot due to extenuating circumstances dating back to the 2019 World Championships. This will also allow us to have a second entry in the women’s C1 200m Event.”\n\nConnor Fitzpatrick (Senobe Canoe Club) and Roland Varga (Richmond Hill Canoe Club) secured their second finals win in the C2 1000m to lock up their advancement for the World Cup season.\n\nSimon McTavish (Mississauga Canoe Club) also crossed the line with another win to confirm his Olympic journey continues in the Men’s K1 1000m.\n\nMichelle Russell (Cheema Aquatic Club) celebrated another win in the K1-200m final today.\n\nThe Para Canoe finals saw Andrea Nelson (Balmy Beach Canoe Club) earn a nomination to the Canadian Paralympic Committee for inclusion on Team Canada. Additional Para athletes who won both finals but still need to meet criteria for a nomination include Erica Scarff (Mississauga Canoe Club) in the women’s KL3 200m Class while Gabriel Ferron-Bouius (Rideau Canoe Club) took top spot on the men’s side and Stefan Samoila won the KL2 Class. Mathieu St. Pierre VL2 and Mike Trauner VL3 rounded out the winners in the Va Classes.\n\nRacing takes place on Burnaby Lake over the course of four days, wrapping up on Sunday March 14.\n\nCKC would like to thank Canoe Kayak BC and Tourism Burnaby for their support of this event.\n\nTo learn more about the status of Tokyo qualifications for Canadian sprint paddlers, click here.\n\n*Prior to being named to Team Canada, all nominations are subject to approval by the COC’s Team Selection Committee following its receipt of nominations by all National Sport Organizations.\n\nWhat:\n\nCKC Olympic and Paralympic Sprint Trials\n\nWhen:\n\nMarch 11-14, 2021\n\nWhere:\n\nBurnaby, BC – Map\n\nHow to Follow:\n\nEvent Website\n\nLive Streaming\n\nSubscribe to Canoe Kayak Canada’s mailing list to get all news and results directly to your email.\n\nAbout Canoe Kayak Canada\n\nCanoe Kayak Canada (CKC) is the national governing body for competitive paddling in Canada, one of Canada’s top performing summer sports with a total of 24 Olympic medals, and a leader in the Paralympic movement.

CKC takes this responsibility and any situation involving misconduct very seriously. CKC and its Members are collectively committed to enacting and enforcing strong, clear, and consistent policies and processes for addressing misconduct.\n\nCKC’s Safe Sport Policy Manual was first approved by its Board of Directors and has been in effect at the national level effective March 1, 2020. Since this time, the policy has been in force, and the mechanisms for dealing with reporting and properly addressing Maltreatment, Harassment and Abuse within our CKC system have been operating. Details of our CKC Safe Sport Policy Manual and approach and contact information for our Independent Safe Sport Officer are available here.\n\nThrough the process of rolling out our national policy, valuable feedback from our membership has been collected and changes in the national landscape have arisen which have led CKC Staff, to make recommendations to the Board of Directors to revise certain elements of our CKC Safe Sport Policy Manual. The revisions include:\n\nClarification within the Screening Policy around which roles in our community will require which level of Screening and Education.\n\nIntegration of the newly released Safe Sport Training module developed by the Coaching Association of Canada into the Screening Policy.\n\nCreation of an independent screening process, to be managed by a CKC-mandated independent third party which will relieve member organizations from bearing this responsibility.\n\nFacilitation of the revised screening process through ckcmember.ca\n\nClarity around sharing of costs of investigations within the aligned system.\n\nAn Executive Summary of the Updated CKC Safe Sport Policy is available here.\n\nThe phase we are now entering is one of education and support to our membership in adopting the CKC Safe Sport Policy Manual within their own organizations. To facilitate this process, a membership declaration has been created and we are targeting April 1, 2021 as the date by which members will have adopted the CKC Safe Sport Policy Manual within their own organization, as well as the target to understand and comply with screening and educational requirements.\n\nAs part of our CKC 2020 virtual Summit, CKC will be offering webinar opportunities to provide full details our Safe Sport Policy Manual, including key responsibilities relevant to Member implementation, and to answer questions. The schedule and registration link for these webinars are as follows:\n\nNovember 12th – PTSO/Division Leadership Webinar: 7:30 pm EST (Registration: http://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYuf-GrrjMjHtbFilGCqtB6bDrf7h1Q4Pke)\n\nNovember 19th – Club and Member Organization Webinar: 7:30 pm EST (Registration: http://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJEkcOyqqTwsEt2FWGUNTwxOe_kGfj5M_BYf)\n\nNovember 26th – Athlete Webinar: 7:30 pm EST (Access Link: http://zoom.us/j/97661460060?pwd=ZWEzQ0pFZTFWUXJrcHJ3eGZ6Z2o5QT09)\n\nDecember 3rd – Club Webinar – French: 7:30 pm EST (Registration: http://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0uf-mqqDIvHN0viRreYLNzZMxne_JsNma_)\n\nIn the meantime, our Safe Sport Policy Manual remains in force, and our Independent Safe Sport Officer has been and continues to be available to contact for complaints or questions confidentially and to guide you through the complaint process as necessary. Further details are available below and linked throughout this page. If you have any further questions regarding the Policy itself, or any of CKC’s safe sport initiatives or programs, please contact Ian Mortimer, Director of Development (imortimer@canoekayak.ca).\n\nThe full CKC Safe Sport Policy is available here\n\nAll other CKC Policies are available here.\n\nReporting a Complaint\n\nAs described above, CKC has appointed independent Safe Sport Officers who any person within the CKC community, at any level can contact to report or discuss incidents of abuse or harassment of any kind. These officers are available to communicate in English or French, as well as officers identifying as male or female are always available based on the preference of the complainant.\n\nCKC has contracted W&W Dispute Resolution Services for this role. They may be reached directly and independently through the email address safesport_wwdrs@primus.ca. This is a confidential email address which will only be accessed by one of the independent Safe Sport Officers.\n\nReporting Abuse or Harassment is often a difficult process. To this end, a person expect the following when contacting the independent safe sport officer:\n\nAll reports will be kept entirely confidential, in line with the wishes of the person making the complaint. This includes confidentiality from CKC staff.\n\nComplaint will be followed up on in a timely manner.\n\nThe independent Safe Sport Officers are available to support persons making a complaint through the process and will provide advice and guidance on steps as and if a complaint proceeds.\n\nYour complaint will be taken seriously, and rigorously examined.\n\nComplaint will be managed in the language, and by an officer of the gender identity of your choice.\n\nShould any complaint or concern come to the attention of the CEO or any CKC representative, it will be forwarded to one of our Safe Sport Officers.\n\nSafe Sport Hotline\n\nAn independent helpline has been set up with the support of Sport Canada and the Sport Dispute Resolution Centre of Canada.\n\nAnyone with a concern, who is not comfortable reaching out to one of the CKC appointed independent Safe Sport Officers, should feel comfortable reaching out to this free and confidential service as well. Information on their services and how to contact them can be found at; abuse-free-sport.ca. The abuse free sport phone and texting line is accessible at 1-888-83-SPORT, and is monitored from 8 am to 8 pm Eastern time.\n\nTraining and Screening\n\nTraining and screening are essential elements of ensuring our CKC community is safe and free of harassment and abuse for all participants. The details of CKC’s approach through our policy are available in the Screening Policy, which is part of the Safe Sport Policy Manual.\n\nFor training, the CKC policy is set up with recommended and required training for different roles based on the risk level associated with the role and position of authority of a given individual in our community. The recommended and required training is the CAC Safe Sport Training and/or Respect in Sport – Activity Leaders Training. Coaches are also required to be Making Ethical Decisions Certified.\n\nThe Screening Requirements Matrix that is an annex to the CKC Screening Policy, outlines the Risk Levels and Associated Recommended and Required Training within the policy.\n\nAll athletes on CKC teams, staff, volunteers working on a project on behalf of CKC (running a competition), committee or board members who are covered by a CKC Terms of Reference, National Level Officials and Integrated Sport Science Team members working with CKC reams will be required to complete Safe Sport Training before April 1st.\n\nIn regards to Screening, based on member feedback, CKC has set up an online platform on ckcmember.ca through which CKC community members can submit their required screening documents to be reviewed by an independent qualified individual. This process will allow the screening process to remain independent, to alleviate the burden on club volunteers and ensure a qualified individual makes recommendations back to member organizations on cases where a relevant issue is disclosed through the process. This screening process is now in final testing, and will be available by December 1, with the target of April 1, 2021 for screening to take place ahead of the 2021 season.\n\nJUNE 1, 2020 – OTTAWA, ON – Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Canada Kayak Canada (CKC) has made the difficult decision to not proceed with nominating Sprint and Paracanoe International teams for the entire 2020 competition season.\n\nThis critical decision was guided by medical advice and extensively reviewed by the CKC leadership staff and the Sprint Racing Council. The risks associated with international travel during the COVID-19 crisis outweigh any benefit to our athletes and high performance programs.\n\n“This year has forced all of us to re-adapt, re-evaluate and re-prioritize,” said 2016 Rio Paralympian Erica Scarff. “Paracanoe athletes are no strangers to living with the unknowns but that doesn’t make our training, with no specific competitions in sight, any easier. However, this is definitely the right decision to keep us all safe and we will continue to be leaders in our paddling community to ensure we do our part in combating the spread of the virus.”\n\nWe recognize how difficult this news will be for our athletes who are working hard for a chance to qualify to race for Canada at the Olympic Hopes Regatta and ICF Non-Olympic World Championships / Canoe Sprint Olympic Events World Cup / Paracanoe World Cup. Our focus remains on staying safe, while doing whatever training is possible in each region of Canada as we collectively move through this crisis.\n\n“We committed to our team that we would inform them at the beginning of June what our decision would be based on all available information at the time,” explained Graham Barton, CKC Chief Technical Officer. “Advice from the medical community was the starting point and we didn’t get past this hurdle in terms of teams travelling internationally. I am happy that in most communities a return to the water in some form or another is now possible. We will be working with our national coaches to explore every opportunity for our team to improve their training options in the coming weeks and are leaving open for now the possibility that we may be able to compete domestically in the fall even if it is virtual or regional events. We want to thank all of our volunteers and staff for their dedication and support as we continue to navigate this unique situation.”\n\nCanoe Kayak Canada has identified the September 26th weekend as the date for a new National Regatta to be held virtually, with some in-person elements, if possible at that time. The format of this competition, and how it integrates with our National Team and Provincial/Territorial programing will be determined based on the shifting reality of the COVID-19 pandemic. Details of this new event, and other competitive options will be established with our Divisional and Provincial/Territorial partners, officials, coaches and athlete representatives throughout the month of June, with a target of announcing these plans in early July.\n\nUpdates to team selection and Athlete Assistance Program criteria will be made in the next month, in partnership with the Canadian Olympic Committee, Canadian Paralympic Committee and Sport Canada.\n\n-30-\n\nAbout Canoe Kayak Canada\n\nCanoe Kayak Canada (CKC) is the national governing body for competitive paddling in Canada, one of Canada’s top performing summer sports with a total of 24 Olympic medals, and a leader in the Paralympic movement.

Follow Canoe Kayak Canada on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.\n\nWithin the context of the current COVID-19 health pandemic, Canoe Kayak Canada (CKC) recognizes that club and Provincial/Territorial Organizations (PTSO) facilities across Canada may be subject to different access restrictions depending on the directives issued by the relevant local government.\n\nCKC also recognizes that, as the weather warms in the coming weeks and governments in different jurisdictions across Canada commence lifting physical distancing and self-isolation requirements, individuals within the Canadian paddling community will be eager to get on the water.\n\nRecently, CKC has received a number of questions regarding whether individuals can paddle independently, on their own or in a physically distanced manner with others, outside of club/PTSO activities, from private docks, or whether they can retrieve their boats and other equipment that is currently stored inside of club facilities.\n\nCKC understands that everyone wants to get back on the water as soon as possible – many of us at CKC are, literally, in the same boat.\n\nIn this regard, CKC issues the following notice that it asks all members in the Canadian paddling community to respect:\n\nClub access\n\nCKC has no control over club and PTSO facility (“club”) access, which is governed by local governments (either municipal or provincial, depending on the nature of the facility). As such, CKC asks that all paddlers respect facility access restrictions as issued by local governmental authorities.\n\nCKC also recommends that, if individuals are permitted by local governmental authorities to retrieve equipment currently inside a club, they only access personal equipment and that club equipment (boats, paddles) remain inside the club facility until access restrictions are lifted.\n\nCKC’s concern is that, if a club lets any individual take club equipment for personal use outside of club activities, liability and insurance issues may be triggered. As such, in order to err on the side of caution, CKC recommends that club equipment remain inside clubs for the duration of the access restriction periods.\n\nPaddling activities\n\nAny individual that chooses to paddle from a private dock or access point not closed due to Public Health restrictions, outside of club activities, does so at their own risk.\n\nWhile CKC does not recommend that individuals paddle on their own for safety reasons, CKC’s position is that, if individuals choose to paddle independently, and potentially on their own, they should respect CKC’s Code of Safety, particularly as it relates to cold water paddling.\n\nShould individuals choose to paddle independently, including on their own, they must do so with the understanding that the directives of local governmental authorities may not allow for safety boats to be on the water with them, which increases safety risks, especially in the sprint discipline, where self-rescue is challenging, and even more so in cold water conditions.\n\nFurther, if individuals choose to paddle independently, CKC’s position is that the directives of local government authorities as they relate to the number of individuals that are permitted to form a group – while respecting physical distancing requirements – must be followed.\n\nCKC’s position is also that clubs, PTSO’s and coaches must ensure that their members and athletes are informed that paddling activities undertaken independently from club facilities, activities or programming, until restrictions are lifted by governmental authorities, are not associated with the club, or coach. Again, as noted above, CKC’s concern as it relates to this subject is the potential for liability or insurance issues.\n\nCKC recognizes that all paddlers want to get back on the water and resume normal activities and that being prohibited from doing so is difficult. However, CKC’s main concerns are that our members stay safe and healthy so that they are able to return to the water as soon as the circumstances permit.\n\nCKC thanks all members of the Canadian paddling community for their continued understanding and their efforts in this challenging time.\n\nMARCH 23, 2020 – (OTTAWA, ON) – Canoe Kayak Canada (CKC) applauds the leadership of the Canadian Olympic Committee and the Canadian Paralympic Committee in taking decisive action to protect the health and wellbeing of our athletes and the community. We also fully support advocating for postponement of the Olympic and Paralympic Games until 2021.\n\n“On behalf of our Team we want to applaud the leadership of COC in making this difficult but necessary decision to not attend the Olympic and Paralympic Games as currently scheduled,” said CKC Chief Technical Officer, Graham Barton. “It has been a stressful week for our athletes with the cancellation of Florida Training Camp and Olympic and Paralympic Team Trials but they have been extremely supportive of prioritizing health and safety. The COC decision provides some much needed certainty and on behalf of CKC I would like to thank them for being leaders for us and the international sport community.”\n\nAs the Coronavirus (COVID-19) global outbreak rapidly evolves, we find ourselves in unprecedented times and our number one priority remains the health and wellbeing of our athletes, staff and entire paddling community.\n\nThe CKC leadership team will continue to work diligently to support our athletes during this difficult time of significant change.\n\nAs always, we are closely monitoring this global pandemic and will provide updates to the paddling community on a regular basis. We thank the community for their continued support.\n\nCKC Athlete Quotes :\n\n“This was no doubt a difficult decision for the COC but I fully support their decision for a fair and safe Olympic Games for all. We are humans first and athletes second. Although this is a difficult time, the fire and desire has not died. This situation has been a reminder for me of how grateful I am to do what we do. I am counting down the days until I can get on the start line with my favourite Canada jersey again.”\n\n– Katie Vincent, Sprint Canoe\n\n“I personally support fully the decision from the COC. Health is the most important thing and right now, it is better to focus on making sure we take care of the pandemic before thinking of sending out athletes. I hope we will get the chance to race and represent our country at the Games but not before our people’s safety is taken care of.”\n\n– Laurence Vincent-Lapointe, Sprint Canoe\n\n“I think it’s the right decision and I hope that more countries follow our lead. We all have a responsibility to help stop the spread of coronavirus right now. A delay of the Olympic Games is the responsible path and I understand that the IOC is currently exploring options. I’m confident that we will know more soon and in the meantime will be upgrading my home gym.”\n\n–Michael Tayler, Slalom Kayak (Qualified for Tokyo)\n\n“I stand by the decision made by the COC. Of course it is heartbreaking for us but we need to do what is the best for our country and the rest of the world. I hope the IOC also stands behind this decision and postpones the Games to 2021. This will allow everyone to stay healthy and be able to prepare properly for the Games.\n\n–Florence Maheu, Slalom Kayak (Qualified for Tokyo)\n\nTeam Canada Press Release (March 22, 2020)\n\nFor questions or concerns, contact Canoe Kayak Canada CEO, Casey Wade.

The health and safety of all our community members remains of the utmost importance.\n\nPlease note that this update is being provided based on the recommendations of CKC’s leadership task force, which is composed of senior staff, medical and legal experts and representative board members. The task force has been meeting regularly to monitor and adjust CKC’s organizational response to the pandemic.\n\nAs the scope and longer term reality of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to evolve, our immediate concerns for health of all participants is joined by a concern for the financial viability of our Clubs, Provincial and Territorial Organizations and the hundreds of Canadians who are employed through our sport.\n\nThis morning, the Federal Government announced significant financial support measures, which along with Provincial measures could provide relief to our community. We will work with our own team here at CKC and with our key partners in Government and the sport sector to provide guidance on what financial support and programs are being made available and any way we can assist in this support reaching those in our community who could be in need.\n\nCKC continues to strongly recommend that all member organizations and individuals adopt strict social distancing measures. Critically, all individuals who are returning from international travel (including the United States) should observe a strict 14-day self-isolation protocol and be very conscious about the people they come into contact with, especially those who may be at high risk, such as elderly persons or those whose current health situation would put them at risk.\n\nIn line with the recommendations immediately above, CKC strongly urges that all member clubs and organizations suspend all in-person activities and instead work to support athletes and other members to continue safe activity in accordance with social-distancing protocols. We have begun working with members and our partners as we look to the weeks and months ahead to form a potential recommendation on paddling activity which respects social distancing requirements and takes safety into account.\n\nGraham Barton CKC Chief Technical Officer has provided an update on training approaches in this difficult time here.\n\nThis morning, the International Canoe Federation (ICF) released its latest update on event cancelations and adjustments to Olympic and Paralympic Qualification.

Follow Canoe Kayak Canada on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.\n\nMARCH 12, 2020 – OTTAWA, ON — Canoe Kayak Canada (CKC) continues to monitor the rapidly changing landscape related to COVID-19 and its potential impact on the well-being of our athletes and coaches. To date, much of our information has come from the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC), Canadian Paralympic Committee (CPC), and the International Olympic Committee (IOC), as well as the International Canoe Federation (ICF), all of whom are following the World Health Organization lead on appropriate actions and precautionary measures.\n\nCKC’s number one priority is the health and well-being of our members, including athletes, coaches, IST support, officials, staff and other volunteers and support personnel.\n\nCKC has formed a specific leadership task force of Senior Staff, medical experts, legal counsel and representative board members to meet daily to assess the situation and adjust our measures as needed.\n\nSpecific to our National Teams and Development Programs, our CKC technical and coaching staff will continue to evaluate and adjust plans following guidance from this task force to ensure our paddlers are provided with the safest training and competition environment in the lead up to the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games and that appropriate actions can be taken if and when necessary.\n\nCKC sent out information to the paddling community concerning the spread of COVID-19 last week, and will continue to do so on a regular basis. Please understand that the sport, medical and public authority understanding of COVID-19 continues to evolve and that decisions, recommendations and guidelines may change as new information emerges. In this regard, we expect that further updates could be forthcoming within the next 24-48 hours, if not sooner.\n\nCKC is keenly aware of the community concern and disruptions related to the COVID-19 outbreak and recognize that these disruptions particularly affect our athletes and their competitive aspirations for the upcoming season. CKC will do everything within its control to ensure that disruptions to selection and Olympic qualification opportunities are minimized to the greatest extent possible and will communicate any further information that it has in relation to selection and Olympic qualification as soon as it is available. In the meantime, athletes should feel comfortable reaching out to coaches, staff, parents or other trusted individuals to share their concerns and any issues arising from this situation, or to ask questions. A CKC Mental Health resource document is available here.\n\nAs of today (March 12), the following measures will be put in place to ensure we are minimizing risk to our athletes and support staff who are currently out of the country at training camps:\n\n1) Any CKC person or team currently located outside of North America should return home as soon as possible. There is a Junior Slalom Development Camp currently in France and arrangements are currently being made for their return.\n\n2) CKC will be restricting all non-essential travel for staff, athletes and personnel, and recommend that any individuals, provincial or club teams that have not departed to camps or competitions outside of the country cancel these trips that were planned to take place in the next 30-days or until it is considered safe to resume travel. We will continue to evaluate this recommendation based on all relevant information.\n\n3) CKC further recommends that all individuals, Clubs and Provincial or Territorial Organizations consult relevant governmental health guidelines for travel, as well as ensure that all participants are fully covered with medical travel insurance. A linked resource is available for organizations to assess the risk associated with different travel and activities.\n\n4) The CKC Sprint National Team training in Indian Harbour Beach (CKC Florida Camp) will remain there and will continue training as we monitor the situation on an on-going basis. However, an area of risk for CKC is movement in and out of the CKC Florida Camp; as such the following measures will be put in place:\n\nCKC will restrict any additional athletes, family, friends and support personnel from joining or entering the CKC Florida Camp to reduce the risk for our athletes already training at the camp. This will include athletes scheduled to join the U21 training camp.\n\nAthletes and Staff currently in the CKC Florida Camp environment will be asked, at the present time, to not leave the environment for travel home or to other locations, in an effort to limit the risks associated with travel. CKC staff will specifically follow up with athletes who planned on traveling as part of their preparation over the coming weeks.\n\n5) From a medical perspective, CKC will put in place the following measures which will be further encouraged with all individuals within the CKC training environments, and within the wider CKC community;\n\nEngage in “social distancing”\n\nAvoid non-essential travel\n\nNo mass gatherings\n\nLimit changes to the environment\n\nAvoid people who are ill\n\nWash hands frequently and avoid touching your face\n\nIf you are sick, stay home or isolated and wear a face mask to avoid infecting others\n\nThe above is what you’re likely aware of, but be committed.\n\nPlease find further details here.\n\n6) We know that Event/Competition confirmation or cancellations will assist in guiding further decisions, and we will continue to engage with the ICF, COPAC, COC, CPC and our partners at the American Canoe Association, regarding these events.\n\n7) If additional restrictions are imposed by governments, this will also guide further decisions.\n\n8) We are aware that the COC, CPC, IPC, Sport Canada and OTP are meeting this afternoon to discuss further. We are hopeful that additional messaging will be forthcoming from this group and if so, we will be sure to communicate it promptly.\n\nPlease rest assured that CKC is doing everything possible to stay up to date on any and all developments related to COVID-19 and that we will continue to do so moving forward.\n\nAbout Canoe Kayak Canada\n\nCanoe Kayak Canada (CKC) is the national governing body for competitive paddling in Canada, one of Canada’s top performing summer sports with a total of 24 Olympic medals, and a leader in the Paralympic movement.

This registration system will form the backbone of our communities’ digital infrastructure moving forward and presents an opportunity for our collective growth and improvement in delivering quality programming to our paddlers, coaches, officials, administrators, and volunteers.\n\nAs a starting point, our new registration system will replace the PadTrac registration system that has been used by the sprint discipline and some other key groups in our community for the past 15 years. Using extensive feedback from the member organizations, the system is being customized for the required functionality for our varied disciplines, and member organizational structures. We are also finalizing our fully bilingual functionality for the system, which will be in place by January 1.\n\nUnlike in the previous system, individual registrants, be they paddlers, parents, officials, volunteers are able to directly register in the system. The basic concept is that all members of our CKC community will have a registration profile in the new system.\n\nAll CKC member Clubs and Provincial/Territorial Organizations will be required to register their organizations in the CKC member management system and will be able to pay fees and sign waivers through this system.\n\nThe new membership management system is open for all member organizations to use as their own membership management system with functionality for customized membership registration, online payment, event registration, and contact list management. One key benefit of using this new system will be the seamless registration in the national database, reducing the need for a duplicate registration process. Fee splitting functionality is also available through the new system, further reducing cumbersome administrative work for CKC members.\n\nCKC recognizes many member organizations have digital registration systems with which they are comfortable and currently using. To support these members, the new CKC system has the functionality to import the required membership information from these systems to facilitate registration in the national database.\n\nLooking ahead the CKC membership management system will be the foundation for continued innovation and expanded support for our member organizations, athletes, volunteers, coaches, and officials.\n\nCKC Membership Management System Q & A\n\nWhen can I access the new system?\n\nRight now! The CKC membership management system is live at https://ckcmember.ca/, and everyone is free to go make an account!\n\nHow do I access my CKC member club or Provincial/Territorial Organization in the new system?\n\nAfter you’ve created an account in the system, authorized representatives are able to request an administrator role for their member organization: https://ckcmember.ca/Registrations/Create?configId=7\n\nThese requested will be put through a CKC credentialing process overseen by CKC staff to ensure authorized representatives are given the required access.\n\nCKC staff will verify the identity and status of those looking to set themselves up in the role of a member administrator through our credentialing process, and grant this status and access to those that are authorized to hold these roles.\n\nHow do I use the system?\n\nWe understand new software can be overwhelming for new users. We want this to be easy for you! We’ve created an administrator manual for creating registrations, we’re also in the process of creating video tutorials to supplement this manual.\n\nWhen can I begin registering users in this system?\n\nimmediaC received extensive feedback from coaches, commodores, and CKC staff at the 2019 summit, and we’re currently working on customizing our sports management core application. You can begin creating registrations, memberships, and fees right now, and users will be able to register for these by January 1st.\n\nHow much does it cost to use the system?\n\nOur system is free to use. We’re working on integrating PTSO and National fees into Sprint memberships.\n\nWho can I contact if I need help?\n\nimmediaC created a manual for administrators to help familiarize admins, but if you have a question that isn’t answered by this manual, immediaC also has a monitored help desk that is active from 9:00 am – 5:00 pm EST, via email: support@immediac.com\n\nThank you!\n\nFinally, thank you for your insight and interest in using the new CKC membership management system. We’re excited to be making a system that fits the needs of every club, and we couldn’t do that without the support and feedback of CKC’s members.\n\nSincerely,\n\nIan Mortimer\n\nCKC Director of Development\n\n&\n\nIsaac Lohnes\n\nimmediaC Project Manager\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA (April 15, 2019)– Canadian Canoe Slalom athletes completed the 2019 Canoe Kayak Canada (CKC) National Team Trials of a new competitive season this weekend at the Riversport Adventures Whitewater Facility in Oklahoma City, USA. Over two days of intense competitions, canoe and kayak slalom athletes tried to secure a spot on the 2019 National teams.\n\nThe first day of competition at the combined Team Trials of Canada and USA proved to be a challenging day for some and just right for others with sub-seasonal temperatures. Both nations shared the Riversport artificial whitewater facility in Oklahoma City while athletes battled to set the fastest race runs across four Olympic events creating an international competetive atmosphere. Neither countries competition results affect the others countries selection process.\n\n“The steep fast courses pushed the paddlers while sending athletes through some of the largest and most challenging waves the Oklahoma artificial whitewater course had to offer over the weekend”, said James Cartwright, Senior Manager of Slalom High Performance Manager and Coach Development at Canoe Kayak Canada. “Our junior and senior athletes demonstrated great results and looked strong on the course this weekend and we are excited to be announcing the Official Teams later this week.”\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/CanoeKayakCAN/photos/a.2553985591343440/2557652044310128/?type=3&theater\n\nCanadian Ben Hayward (Edmonton, AB), led the field in men’s kayak for runs one and two setting the fastest times of the day both for Canada and US.\n\nOlympian Cam Smedley (Dunrobin, ON) led the men’s C1 class, but knew he had to race faster on day two of to solidify his place on the team.\n\nA challenging course set, and strict selection criteria proved to be a tough challenge requiring many athletes vying for selection to step up their performance for races 3 and 4.\n\nSaturday April 13 was planned as day 2 and trials runs 3 and 4 for the Canadians, however due to inclamite weather of high winds and heavy rain, the final two selection races were moved to Sunday April 14th. The US Team trials carried on, giving Canadian athletes an option to race for practice or opt for a rest day.\n\nSunday’s weather forecast proved to be spot on with the rain and wind blown away, sunny skies and warming weather made race conditions near perfect.\n\nTwo time Olympian and Ottawa native Michael Tayler took top place in race 3, while Ben Hayward set the best time once again in race 4.\n\nLois Betteridge (Ottawa, ON) set the fastest women’s C1 run in selection races 2 and 3 for both Canada and US. In women’s K1 event, Lois Betteridge and Florence Maheu traded off wins throughout the four selection races.\n\nFirst year Junior boys C1 paddler Finn Wakeling (Port Moody, BC), demonstrated poise and perseverance through the four selection races leading the pack and winning three of four race runs in his event.\n\nMael Rivard (Ottawa, ON) smooth style and consistent race game, dominated all four races in the junior K1 category.\n\nIn the U23 men’s K1 class Trevor Boyd (Calgary, AB) and Keenan Simpson (Montreal, QC) battled the course and each other, swapping wins with two each.\n\nIn the women’s junior K1 class, Jocelyn Taylor (Calgary, AB) international experience on artificial courses proved to help her to win 3 of the 4 selection races.\n\nCam Smedley continued to solidy his position as Canada’s top C1 paddler setting the best time after each selection race.\n\nCanoe Kayak Canada will be announcing later this week the selected athletes that will be representing Canada on the official 2019 Senior, U23 and Junior Teams. The full results of the competitions can be found online here.\n\nIn addition to the international competitions, Canoe Kayak Canada will be hosting the 2019 Whitewater National Championships in Minden Hills, Ontario from August 12 to August 18.

Some involve changes to entry procedures, others involve stricter anti-doping education rules, and others involve changes to competition formats.\n\nThe first chapter of each rules book covers laws which relate to ALL disciplines. The list below covers just some of the changes ahead of this season. It is important Federations, athletes and coaches check out all the rule changes here.\n\nATHLETE ENTRIES\n\nFirst and foremost, teams need to be aware of new requirements for athlete entries for competitions. Nominal entries will now close ten (10) days before the first day of competition (or before classification for paracanoe).\n\nThere will now be a late entry fee for any nominal entries submitted after that deadline. Under the previous rules, deadlines were different for each discipline. The ICF believes making the 10-day deadline will make it less confusing for teams.\n\nTeams will be sent reminder emails ahead of the final deadlines for world cups and world championships.\n\nANTI-DOPING\n\nThe ICF congress has endorsed a proposal to extend compulsory anti-doping education courses to all senior, U23 and junior international athletes across all canoeing disciplines.\n\nIt is important federations and teams understand that these education courses are compulsory and need to be completed before athletes compete in an international competition. Details about courses can be found here.\n\nNATIONS CUPS\n\nFrom 2019 there will only be one Nations Cup presented at each world championships. Previously cups were awarded for individual categories, but now the best performing team across the board will be recognised.\n\nCANOE SPRINT\n\nOne of the biggest changes will see “next best time” no longer used for progression from semi-finals to finals for any event with between 28 and 54 boats. There will now be three semi-finals, and the top three from each semi will go through to the final.\n\nThe next three will go to a B final, and the next three to a C final. Best times will still be used in some situations for progression from heats to semi-finals, including in events where there are more than 54 entries.\n\n“Next best times” will no longer be used in the Olympic Games, and the ICF is looking replicate the Olympic racing program.\n\nCANOE SLALOM\n\nOrganisers will now have the option adding two extra upstream gates. Previously the maximum allowed was six, but now there can be eight. The change is to provide more challenges to the athletes.\n\nOrganisers also now have the option to set a shorter course, bringing the minimum length down from 200 metres to 150 metres.\n\nEXTREME SLALOM\n\nCompetitors must now ensure their head AND shoulders now pass through the gate. Previously just ensuring your head crossed the line was acceptable.\n\nWILDWATER\n\nThere will no longer be restrictions on the width of boats used in non-ICF events. Under the old rules, all competitions had to follow the 60 centimetre rule for K1, 70 centimetre for C1 and 80 centimetre for C2.\n\nHowever in an effort to attract more paddlers, those restrictions will no longer apply for events outside world cups and world championships.\n\nThere will also be changes to introduce gender equality in finals, with an additional three places for women in the K1 sprint events, and an extra two places in C1 sprint. This will bring 15 men and 15 women in sprint finals, and 12 men and women in the C1.\n\nFREESTYLE\n\nGender equality will also now be achieved in freestyle, with three team places now available for junior women, up from the original two.\n\nCANOE POLO\n\nTeam cards have now been eliminated. Under the new system, players will now receive individual green cards, and the fourth player on a team to infringe will be given a yellow card.\n\nCanoe polo will also introduce powerplays this year, and there will be a change to the way penalties are taken. Players will now be closer to the goal, but will need to contend with a goalkeeper.\n\nGo to the ICF website to find all the rules for the coming season.\n\nOTTAWA, ON (November 9, 2018)– Canada’s most deserving and influential coaches and sports leaders will be honoured this evening at the 2018 Petro-Canada Sport Leadership Awards Gala.

When I think of where I am today, I have so many people to thank. I would particularly like to recognize Skate Canada and Patinage Québec for helping me make my dreams a reality. Lastly, I want to thank everyone who believed in me.”\n\n******\n\nJack Donohue “Coach of the Year” Award\n\nThe Jack Donohue “Coach of the Year” Award is presented to a Chartered Professional Coach (ChPC) for their outstanding contributions as one of Canada’s top coaches.

I have been incredibly fortunate to have a supportive family. I would like to thank my parents, my kids, my wife and all of my coaching mentors, particularly Peter Judge, Bobby Aldighieri, and Dave Paskevich. Coaching has been an incredibly rewarding career to this point, and that has everything to do with the athletes I have had the privilege of working with. I can’t thank them enough for placing their trust in me.”\n\n******\n\nIG Wealth Management National NCCP Coach Developer Award\n\nThis award recognizes an outstanding individual who has gone above and beyond to inspire and develop NCCP coaches in their community.

He’s been involved in the NCCP since 1980 as a participant, learning facilitator, master coach developer, and project advisor,” says Trevor Krahn, Director, Sponsorship & Community Engagement at IG Wealth Management. “We’re honoured to present the IG Wealth Management National NCCP Coach Developer Award to him this year.”\n\n“I am very proud to be recognized for my somewhat ‘outside the box’ delivery style in the courses and workshops that I teach. I like to root my delivery in the holistic model of life predicated by my Mohawk culture,” says Greg Henhawk. “As with all cultures, I believe that the present and past voices of the people contain great wisdom. I am proud to share the wisdom of my Indigenous ancestors and I try to teach in a way that illustrates and honours the voice of my people.
