While the ternary construction is the most prominent, variations on the construction produce Cantor sets with different analytic properties. In this talk, I will introduce well-known constructions of Cantor sets and spend most of the time discussing an alternative construction that I developed and analyzed in my capstone mathematics course.\n\nAnastasia Clements is a Mathematics major at West Chester University who has been studying Cantor sets in her capstone course. She plans to being taking graduate courses in the Fall as part of the Accelerated MA Program.\n\nWest Chester University Mathematics Colloquium\n\nPresents\n\nDr. Frédéric Mynard\n\nNew Jersey City University\n\nA Convergence Manifesto\n\nFriday, April 26th, 2024 3:00 – 4:00 pm UNA 158\n\nZoom Cast: https://wcupa.zoom.us/j/92405376738?pwd=Q2NmUm03OHlYSjgxOThYNXpRZ1p3dz09\n\nAbstract: The aim of this talk is to convince you, from elementary considerations, that convergence spaces, which are more general than topological spaces, are a most natural and convenient generalization, whose role for topological problems could be compared to complex numbers for problems formulated in the reals.\n\nDr. Frédéric Mynard studied mathematics at the University of Burgundy, Dijon, France, where he obtained his Ph.D. degree in mathematics in 1999. He is the Chair of the Mathematics Department at New Jersey City University. His research interests include general, set-theoretic, and categorical topology, particularly convergence space theory and its applications in topology and analysis.\n\nFor more information contact:\n\njbrazas@wcupa.edu\n\n.\n\nWest Chester University Mathematics Colloquium\n\nPresents\n\nDr. Julia Hartmann\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n\nSymmetry Groups of Linear Differential Equations\n\nThursday April 18th, 2024 3:30 – 4:30 pm UNA 158\n\nAbstract: The aim of this talk is to give an introduction to the Galois theory of linear differential equations. This theory mimics the usual Galois theory for polynomials, and it relates properties of the equation such as solvability to properties of a related group of symmetries. We will also mention a recent result concerning symmetries of differential equations over the complex rational function field.\n\nDr. Julia Hartmann is the Fay R. and Eugene L. Langberg Professor in Mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania. She completed her Ph.D. at Ruprect-Karls-Universitat Heidelberg. Dr. Hartmann is a prolific author who studies algebraic structures and their symmetries and who has published many papers in the worlds top mathematics journals. She is also active in the Association for Women in Mathematics and GeMs, which supports those in math who identify as gender minorities.\n\nFor more information contact:\n\njbrazas@wcupa.edu\n\nWest Chester University Mathematics Colloquium\n\nPresents\n\nShiv Gupta\n\nWest Chester University\n\nGalois Groups over ℚ and The Inverse Galois Problem\n\nWed. April 3rd 2024, 3:15 – 4:15 pm, UNA 158\n\nAbstract: Inverse Galois Theory is concerned with the problem/question: which finite groups appear as Galois groups over the field ℚ. Although this problem in its complete generality remains unsolved but it has been shown that the answer is in affirmative for the class of finite solvable groups and also for the symmetric groups 𝑆n and Alternating groups 𝐴n.\n\nWe will discuss some methods of finding the Galois groups of polynomials in ℚ[𝑥] and make some comments about a paper by Erbach, Fischer and McKay: Polynomials with PSL(2,7) as a Galois Group, J. Number Theory 11 (1979).\n\nDr. Shiv Gupta has been teaching at West Chester University for many years.\n\nHe loves traveling and his mathematical interests include Number Theory, Finite Groups and Galois Theory.\n\nFor more information contact:\n\njbrazas@wcupa.edu\n\n.\n\nWest Chester University Mathematics Colloquium\n\nPresents\n\nDr. Kaitlyn Muller\n\nVillanova University\n\nWhy radar?\n\nThurs. March 28th 2024 3:15 – 4:15 pm UNA 158\n\nAbstract: In a world with increasing optical image capabilities, like improving iPhone cameras, why is radar data still used to create images? In this talk we’ll discuss what radar is and why it is used in so many applications, from environmental and weather monitoring to military surveillance. We’ll highlight some of the types of mathematics used in modeling radar data and producing radar images.\n\nWe’ll also discuss what drew me to research in this area and why I’ve stayed with it for over 10 years now.\n\nDr. Kaitlyn Muller is an Associate Professor of Mathematics at Villanova University. She completed her PhD in Applied Mathematics in 2011 at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Previously, she worked as a researcher at the Air Force Research Lab and Colorado State University.\n\nFor more information contact:\n\njbrazas@wcupa.edu\n\nWest Chester University Mathematics Colloquium\n\nPresents\n\nJeffrey Hatley\n\nUnion College\n\nRational Points on Elliptic Curves over Infinite Extensions\n\nWed. March 20th 2024 3:15 – 4:15 pm UNA 158\n\nAbstract: Elliptic curves are among the most-studied objects in modern number theory. The Mordell-Weil theorem says that if 𝐾/𝑄 is an algebraic extension of finite degree, then 𝐸(𝐾), the 𝐾-rational points of 𝐸, form a finitely-generated abelian group, and much work continues to be done on classifying the groups that can arise in this way.\n\nIt turns out that, for many infinite extensions 𝐾/𝑄, the group 𝐸(𝐾) remains finitely-generated, and the same sorts of questions can be asked (and sometimes answered) in this new setting.\n\nIn this talk, we will begin by introducing the fundamental facts and properties of elliptic curves, so no prior experience with them is necessary. We will then give a survey of some of the active research being done on the structure of 𝐸(𝐾) in both the finite- and infinite-degree settings.\n\nDr. Jeffrey Hatley is an Associate Professor of Mathematics at Union College in Schenectady, NY. He completed his PhD in 2015 at UMass Amherst and works in the field of number theory. Hatley is the author of several research papers and is highly active in research with students.\n\nFor more information contact:\n\njbrazas@wcupa.edu\n\nWest Chester University Mathematics Colloquium\n\nPresents\n\nPete Clark\n\nUniversity of Georgia\n\nA Group‐Theoretic Ax‐Katz Theorem\n\nWednesday, March 6th 2024 Time: 3:15 – 4:15 pm UNA 158\n\nZoom Cast: https://wcupa.zoom.us/j/99232077993?pwd=aFZVcjBZUzgzV2l2UERHYkU5N2gxUT09\n\nAbstract: The Chevalley-Warning Theorem is a result from 1935 asserting that the number of solutions to a low degree polynomial system over a finite field is divisible by the characteristic of the field. It is an important result -- it includes a conjecture of Artin and Dickson from the 1920's -- but it is not difficult to prove: the original proof is about three pages. In 1964, James Ax gave a completely elementary ten line proof. In the same paper, Ax showed that as the number and degrees of the polynomials are held fixed and the number of variables increases, not only is the size of the solution set divisible by p but by higher and higher powers of p. The best possible p-adic divisibility here was given in 1971 by Nicholas Katz. Katz's proof is at a much higher level: you need specialist knowledge in the right subfields of number theory to understand it. Simpler proofs were found later, but none fulfills the fantasy of generalizing Ax's ten line proof of Chevalley- Warning.\n\nA 2021 work of Aichinger-Moosbauer develops a fully fledged calculus of finite differences for maps between commutative groups and uses it to give a purely group-theoretic generalization of Chevalley-Warning. Nicholas Triantafillou and I have used and extended this work: up to a few black boxes (where most of the content is indeed hidden) we give a ten line proof of a group- theoretic analogue of Ax-Katz that \"qualitatively fulfills my fantasy.\"\n\nDr. Pete L.

Smith. The Cantor Set plays an important role in many areas of mathematics, including Set Theory, Topology, and Analysis. This talk will include an undergraduate-friendly introduction to the Cantor Set and we’ll explore several consequences of its existence.\n\nI’ll also describe how the Cantor Set helped my colleagues and I solve a difficult topological problem living at the border of dimensions 1 and 2. In 2011, Jerzy Dydak asked if a map over a disk that lifts all paths uniquely relative to their starting point must be bijective or if one can “pull apart” all paths in a disk up to back- tracking to form a tree-like space called an ℝ-tree. After years of effort, it remained unclear even if one should conjecture “yes” or “no” to this question. However, this problem was resolved this year in collaboration with Greg Conner, Paul Fabel, and Curt Kent using a new Cantor-Set inspired construction.\n\nDr. Jeremy Brazas is an Associate Professor at West Chester University. He completed his PhD in mathematics at the University of New Hampshire in 2011 in algebraic topology.

The number 8 is special because of Bott periodicity, the octonions and the E8 lattice, while 24 is special for many reasons, including the binary tetrahedral group, the Dedekind eta function, and the third stable homotopy group of spheres. The number 8 does for superstring theory what the number 24 does for bosonic string theory. In this talk, which is intended to be entertaining, I will overview these matters and also some intriguing connections between the numbers 8 and 24.\n\nDr. John Baez is a mathematical physicist and Professor Emeritus at UC Riverside. He received his PhD at MIT in 1986 under Irving Segal. His research includes work on spin foams in loop quantum gravity, applications of higher categories to physics, and applications of categories in network theory.

Markl and Shnider proved the “Magical Formula” for the diagonal proposed by J-L Loday (2006). Masuda, Thomas, Tonks, and Vallette gave a set theoretic construction, which descends to the “Magical Formula” (2021). In this talk I will outline a proof that our diagonal is identical to the one given by the “Magical Formula” (S-U 2022). This result is useful because our combinatorial diagonal is easy to compute in low dimensions.\n\nDr. Ron Umble is a Professor Emeritus at Millersville University. Dr. Umble completed his PhD in 1983 under Jim Stasheff and works in the field of algebraic topology.\n\nRecently retired, he has served as a professor at MU since 1984.

One method that’s regularly taught is Change of Variable (U-Substitution) in which one differentiates a part of the function and by doing so, it makes the integral easier to solve. But what if there were cases where integrating the entire function with respect to some variable would make the integral easier to solve? Under certain conditions, Leibniz’s Integral Rule (for differentiation under the integral sign) allows us to do just that. In this talk, we will define Leibniz’s Integral Rule and its conditions, provide examples on how to apply the rule for certain integrals, and explore its limitations.\n\nFor more information about this and other upcoming colloquia, Please email\n\nDr. Jeremy Brazas\n\n.\n\n.\n\nWest Chester University Mathematics Colloquium\n\nPresents\n\nProfessor Krishanswami Alladi\n\nUniversity of Florida\n\nMy Association and Collaboration with Paul Erdös, A Legend of 20th Century Mathematics\n\nFriday, September 22, 2023 3:15 - 4:15 pm, 25 University Avenue, Room 161\n\nAbstract: Paul Erdös was one of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th century.

Under normal play, a player wins by making the last legal move. Under misere play, a player wins by \"losing\" on purpose: forcing the opponent to take the last move. Normal-play games form a partially-ordered abelian group with a natural addition operation and nontrivial relations of equality and inequality; but under misere play, much of the algebraic structure falls apart. This talk will give a general introduction to combinatorial game theory and discuss recent developments and current open problems in misere game theory.\n\nFor further information, please email\n\nmfisher@wcupa.edu\n\n(Click on the picture to access the Zoom link.)\n\nMultiscale Models for Understanding Tumor-Immune Dynamics and Optimizing Immune and Targeted Therapy Schedules\n\nWednesday, April 12 | 2:00 PM | Anderson 304\n\nAbstract: Increased understanding of molecular mechanisms that mediate the pathogenesis of cancers is leading to careful manipulation of these pathways and the development of new cell-specific approaches to cancer therapy. At the same time, advances in cancer immunotherapy have led to the reemergence of their clinical use and effectiveness. Using data-driven computational models is a powerful and practical way to optimize novel combinations of these two very different therapeutic options for clinical cancer treatment. This talk will highlight a suite of multiscale mathematical models designed to optimize targeted drug treatment strategies, alone and in combination with immunotherapy. Together with existing and newly generated experimental data, these mathematical models are poised to improve the ability to combine promising drugs for clinical trials and reduce the time and costs associated with transitioning novel therapeutic approaches from \"equations to bench to bedside.”\n\nTrachette L.

However, for complicated spaces many subgroups of the fundamental group do not correspond to covering spaces. Here we will consider inverse limits of covering spaces, which we call pro-coverings, of both CW-complexes and more general spaces. Pro-coverings give an additional tool to study the fundamental group of complicated spaces. We will show that pro-coverings are often path-connected and can be constructed as a quotient of the path space. We will use a specific pro-covering to construct a splitting of the first homology of Peano continua.\n\nCurtis Kent is an Associate Professor of Mathematics at Brigham Young University. Dr. Kent completed his Ph.D. at Vanderbilt University under Mark Sapir. He was also a postdoctoral fellow at the Courant Institute of Mathematics at NYU and at the University of Toronto.

Maybe we modern humans are such a tribe. Despite the sophistication we see in ourselves compared with our less advanced ancestors from times long past, it’s surprising how little progress we’ve made in addressing some basic problems in 3D or beyond, or when solving seemingly simple equations in ≥3 variables. We’ll survey a dozen fun topics in shapes and numbers and patterns whose basics and generalisations can be explored with little mathematical background, and which speedily lead to “what if?” questions ranging from easy to tricky to “we just don’t know.” Fruit, cakes, doughnuts, bagels, coins, boxes, cubes, primes, squares, and sums involving powers will all make appearances.

Its fundamental role makes it one of the earliest topics of study (usually first seen in a primitive form in high school). UFDs are often studied at the beginning abstract algebra level as they are the domains where the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic holds (specifically, every nonzero nonunit of the domain can be factored uniquely into primes). But the study of factorization goes far deeper than the niceness of UFDs and this is what we will explore. Mostly through examples, we will look at domains with exotic factorization properties in the zoo of commutative algebra and produce a couple of surprising examples and theorems. As a teaser, we ask if you can think of a domain where not everything factors into irreducibles. Can you think of a domain where there are no irreducibles at all? How about a ring with no irreducibles with polynomials that are irreducible? We will explore these questions and more. This talk will lean heavily on examples rather than rigorous proof to give the audience and intuitive “big picture” of some of the beauty of this field.\n\nJim Coykendall is a Professor of Mathematics at Clemson University.

About his discovery of the formulas for these numbers, Jacob Bernoulli wrote:\n\nWith the help of these formulas it took me less than half of a quarter of an hour to find that the 10th powers of the first 1000 numbers being added together will yield the sum\n\n91,409,924,241,424,243,424,241,924,242,500\n\nWe now know that Bernoulli Numbers were also independently discovered by Japanese Mathematician Seki Takakazu and his discovery was posthumously published in 1712 in his work Katsuyo Sampo where as Jacob Bernoulli's was published (also posthumously), in his Ars Conjectandi in 1713.\n\nWe shall discuss some properties of Bernoulli Numbers and talk about a conjecture and its resolution, using Kummer's Congruence, concerning the numerators of some Bernoulli Numbers.\n\nFor further information e-mail\n\nmfisher@wcupa.edu\n\nWest Chester University\n\nPresents\n\nRylee Lyman\n\nRutgers University-Newark\n\n“Train track maps on graphs of groups and CTs for free products”\n\nFriday, March 4th, from 4:30 – 5:25 PM\n\nWest Chester University, Anderson Hall 211\n\nA homotopy equivalence of a graph is a train track map when it sends vertices to vertices and the restriction of any iterate of the map to an edge yields an immersion. (Relative) train track maps were introduced by Bestvina and Handel in 1992; since then they have become one of the main tools in the study of outer automorphisms of free groups. More recently in 2011, Feighn and Handel introduced a stronger kind of relative train track map called a CT and proved their existence for all outer automorphisms of free groups after passing to a power. We extend the theory of relative train track maps to certain graphs of groups and the theory of CTs to free products (that is, graphs of groups with trivial edge groups).\n\nRylee Lyman earned their PhD in Mathematics a Tufts University, studying with Kim Raune.

It is based on a recently discovered correspondence between Shannon entropy and functions on topological simplices that satisfy an equation akin to the Leibniz rule. The correspondence relies heavily on a particular operad, which is an abstract tool with origins in algebraic topology. Explicitly, the theorem gives a new way to think about Shannon entropy from a pure mathematical perspective: it can be thought of as a derivation of the operad of probabilities. My goal in this talk is to explain what these words mean and why one might find this new result interesting.\n\nTai-Danae Bradley is a research mathematician at Sandbox@Alphabet and a visiting research professor of mathematics at The Master’s University.

Even with today’s seemingly fast pace of AI breakthroughs, the development of long-promised technologies such as self-driving cars, housekeeping robots, and conversational companions has turned out to be much harder than many people expected. One reason for these repeating cycles is our limited understanding of the nature and complexity of intelligence itself. In this talk I will discuss some fallacies in common assumptions made by AI researchers, which can lead to overconfident predictions about the field. I will also speculate on what is needed for the grand challenge of making AI systems more robust, general, and adaptable—in short, more intelligent.\n\nMelanie Mitchell is the Davis Professor of Complexity at the Santa Fe Institute.

Analytical methods almost always represent phenomena at a much simpler level than the complex structure or dynamics inherent in systems, through either simpler measured or sampled data, or simpler models, or both. As just one example, collaboration data from publications databases are often modeled as graphs of authors, in which pairs of authors (vertices) are connected if they published a paper together, perhaps weighted by the number of such papers. This graph view is also commonly found when analyzing many other kinds of data including biological, cyber, and social. But to better represent inherent complexity, researchers are striving to adopt hypergraphs, representing connections not only as pairwise, but as multi-way or higher order. In bibliometrics, where papers have multiple authors, and authors write multiple papers, hypergraphs can natively capture the complex ways that groups of authors form into collaborations as sets of authors on papers, where traditional collaboration networks can only do so via complex coding schemes. Our recent work has focused on first developing and implementing methods that extend common graph methods to hypergraphs—e.g., distance, diameter, centrality—and then using such methods to study real data sets from biology to cyber security. Moreover, the complexity of hypergraphs imbues them with significant topological properties, and we have been active in developing a theory and interpretation of hypergraph homology, through abstract simplicial complexes and other topological representations. Additionally, graphs and hypergraphs both arise in data systems with more than two dimensions, for example adding keywords or institutions to papers and authors. These four dimensions—authors, papers, keywords, and institutions—now can form a combinatorial number of hypergraphs (e.g. authors vs. papers, papers vs. keywords, institutions vs. authors, etc.). But what mathematical structure can be formed when we consider all these dimensions simultaneously? Tensors may be one such structure, but even they may be too restrictive since tensors represent a multi-relation among all dimensions, and data may only be available on certain projections. In this talk I will provide an overview of our work on hypergraphs and topology for data science, including both theory and practice of the methods we have been developing, and provide some thoughts on going beyond hypergraphs.\n\nDr. Emilie Purvine is a Senior Data Scientist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

Combinatorial information in the firing patterns of neurons often reflects important features of the stimuli which generated them. How can we efficiently extract such information?

This process for making functional materials 2D materials from 1D portable cloth dates back to prehistory, with the oldest known examples dating from the 11th century CE. Knitted textiles are ubiquitous as they are easy and cheap to create, lightweight, portable, flexible and stretchy. As with many functional materials, the key to knitting’s extraordinary properties lies in its microstructure.\n\nAt the 1D level, knits are composed of an interlocking series of slip knots. At the most basic level there is only one manipulation that creates a knitted stitch – pulling a loop of yarn through another loop. However, there exist hundreds of books with thousands of patterns of stitches with seemingly unbounded complexity.\n\nThe topology of knitted stitches has a profound impact on the geometry and elasticity of the resulting fabric. This puts a new spin on additive manufacturing – not only can stitch pattern control the local and global geometry of a textile, but the creation process encodes mechanical properties within the material itself. Unlike standard additive manufacturing techniques, the innate properties of the yarn and the stitch microstructure has a direct effect on the global geometric and mechanical outcome of knitted fabrics.\n\nSabetta Matsumoto is an assistant professor in the School of Physics at Georgia Institute of Technology. Her physics research centers around the relationship between geometry and material properties in soft systems, including liquid crystals, 3D printing and textiles. Her lab studies knitted textiles from the point of view of knot theory and as an additive manufacturing technique. She is also interested in using sewing, 3D printing and virtual reality in mathematical art and education.\n\nFor further information e-mail\n\nmfisher@wcupa.edu\n\nSpring 2021\n\nWest Chester University\n\nSpring 2021 Mathematics Colloquium\n\npresents\n\nSvenja Huntemann\n\nConcordia University of Edmonton\n\n“Enumeration of Game Positions”\n\nWednesday, April 28, 2021 from 4:00 to 4:50PM\n\nPlacement games are 2-player games in which pieces are placed on a board without moving or removing them later. Many of these games naturally break into smaller components as the game progresses, called a disjunctive sum. A common technique to determine the winner includes studying the components separately. This allows us to consider the smaller parts of the game but requires us to consider non-alternating play sequences in addition to strictly alternating.\n\nThe polynomial profile of a game enumerates the number of positions with a fixed number of pieces from each player. We can use the polynomial profile to determine both the number of options under strictly alternating play and when considering all lines of play, and thus the ratio between these two. Determining the polynomial profile relates to several enumeration problems in graph theory as well. I will discuss some known results on enumerating game positions for a variety of placement games, as well as ongoing work. Some of this work is joint with Neil McKay.\n\nSvenja Huntemann is an Assistant Professor at Concordia University of Edmonton in Canada.

There are so many things you can do with flexagons. You can create them, flex them and study them from a topological point of view. Flexagon theory is still very much in its infancy, so there is so much still to do. In this talk we will take a look at a gallery of flexagons, show you how to fold some of them, learn how to define them, see the connection between flexagons and Mobius strips, explore flexagon diagrams, meet Ann Schwartz’s mind boggling straight-strip flexagons, discuss Scott Sherman’s flexagonator and even learn about my newly found art of destroying flexagons.\n\nYossi Elran heads the Innovation Center for Science Education at the Davidson Institute, the educational arm of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.

A central concept in commutative algebra is the one of “unique factorization,” and we recall that a unique factorization domain (UFD), R, is an integral domain where one has the fundamental theorem of arithmetic; that is, every nonzero, nonunit of R can be factored (uniquely) into prime elements. Much of the focus of factorization theory involves investigation into generalizations of the UFD property in natural ways and studying their properties (for instance are these “factorization properties” preserved in polynomial extensions, power series extensions, integral closures, etc.?).\n\nThe aim of this talk will be to acquaint the audience with some of the broad stroke ideas in factorization and then specialize to a couple of types of domains that are, in one sense of the word, the “next best thing” to being a UFD. For these “near UFDs” interesting examples will be produced and some recent results will be disclosed.\n\nJim Coykendall got his PhD in 1995 from Cornell University (in algebraic number theory). After a one-year stint as the C. C. Hsiung Visiting Professor at Lehigh University, he moved to North Dakota State University from 1996-2013.

Part of the parasite’s life cycle, the asexual part, is spent in humans while the sexual part is spent in mosquitoes. Successful transmission of the parasite to humans requires that a susceptible female mosquito feed on two distinct humans - one infected with the parasite and the other susceptible, at two distinct sequential time points. In addition, the parasite must be in its transmissible form in the mosquito at the latter feeding. The bottlenecks involved in the process illuminates how the parasite, driven by the need to survive, has captured the evolutionary and reproductive needs of the mosquito to ensure the parasite’s survivability. Mathematics has a place to capture this transmission cycle dynamics in ways and quantitatively where it might be challenging biologically. In this talk, I will present the first ever mathematical model of the within-mosquito life-cycle component of P. falciparum parasites which accounts for the developmental stage transformations of the parasites from ingested gametocytes (forms of the parasite transmitted from humans to mosquitoes) to the formation of sporozoites, parasite forms transmitted from mosquitoes to humans. The model will consider the action and effect of blood resident human-antibodies ingested by mosquitoes during a blood meal, in inhibiting gamete fertilization. Model analysis and simulations will be used to explore the question of whether it is possible to control and limit the development of oocysts, precursors of the sporozoites, and hence sporozoite development within a mosquito by boosting the efficiency of antibodies that can be ingested during a blood meal, as a pathway to the development of transmission-blocking vaccines.\n\nDr. Teboh-Ewungkem is originally from Cameroon.

That is, no particular background is assumed. We present work largely due to Conway following the presentation in The Book of Numbers (Conway and Guy, 1996). The surreal numbers arise naturally in the context of games; this is in contrast with the usual impetus for a number system, which is solving equations. The surreal numbers unite ordinal infinities and the real numbers.

In this talk, I'll discuss arithmetic aspects of the fundamental group of an algebraic variety, and how it allows us to translate problems in geometry to problems in arithmetic, and vice versa. Going from arithmetic to geometry, I'll explain how number-theoretic methods can be used to obtain information about the geometry of complex algebraic varieties. And in the other direction, I'll discuss a conjectural relationship between the fundamental group and questions about rational solutions to polynomial equations—Grothendieck's section conjecture—and how methods from low-dimensional topology can be used to construct non-trivial obstructions to the existence of rational solutions, and curves satisfying the section conjecture.\n\nDaniel Litt is an assistant professor at the University of Georgia.

Such an edge coloring is known as a JL-coloring. In previous work it has been shown that for graphs in certain classes, these colorings are all obtainable in a certain way that permits classification: for instance, it is known that the essentially different colorings of Kn with n > 1 are in one-to-one correspondence with isomorphism classes of full binary trees with n leaves. We have defined a Standard Construction for JL-colorings (which we derived from the previous results) and we have shown that any JL-coloring of a connected graph is produced by this Standard Construction. Furthermore, every JL-coloring has a monochromatic edge cut. We also state some results on the sharpness of this result: specifically, what can we say about the number of colors used in an edge coloring that forbids rainbow cycles and monochromatic cuts.\n\nOne important question in edge coloring is the study of proper edge colorings; that is, an edge coloring is proper if no two incident edges have the same color. We will also discuss edge colorings which are proper and are rainbow-cycle-forbidding. In most cases, the number of colors used is relaxed in order for this to be achievable. We will see some results obtained on this question so far and take a look at what else needs to be done.\n\nAndrew completed his undergraduate degree in pure mathematics at the University of Texas in Austin in 2008.

We then define viscosity solutions for degenerate elliptic partial differential equations. After looking at a few more examples, we will pay particular attention to Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations and show (formally) that the value function of the associated control problem is a viscosity solution of the HJB equation.

Cops and Robbers is a pursuit-evasion game played on graphs. Player 1 controls a set of k cops, while Player 2 controls a robber. Player 1 chooses k (or fewer) vertices of a graph for the cops to occupy, then Player 2 chooses a different vertex for the robber to occupy. Players then alternate turns moving along edges of the graph. The goal of the cop player is to capture the robber by occupying the same vertex. The goal of the robber is to avoid capture indefinitely.\n\nThis talk will give an introduction to the game of Cops and Robbers by presenting a variety of key results and proof techniques within this area of research. We will conclude with current research directions and open problems.\n\nMelissa Huggan is an NSERC Postdoctoral Fellow at Ryerson University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\n\nFor further information e-mail\n\nmfisher@wcupa.edu\n\n.\n\nWest Chester University\n\nFall 2019 Mathematics Colloquium\n\npresents\n\nCOLIN ADAMS\n\nWilliams College\n\n“Blown Away: What Knot to Do When Sailing”\n\nMonday, September 23, 2019 from 3:15 to 4:05PM UNA 155\n\nBeing a tale of adventure on the high seas involving great risk to the tale teller, and how an understanding of the mathematical theory of knots saved his bacon.

One sequence of events is the acceleration of new scientific and manufacturing technologies which require more sophisticated statistical modeling as well as generate more complex data structures. The flexibility of Bayesian inference allows it to be more adaptable to such technological changes.\n\nAnother, change occurring is the increased amount of historical data available through modern database environments. This provides for more information to build informative priors for Bayesian inference, thereby increasing the power and efficiency of statistical inference.\n\nA third situation arising in the 21st century, is science’s disappointment with p-values as a tool for decision making. Here again, Bayesian inference can provide more adaptable and easier to interpret quantitative tools for inference and decision making.\n\nAs such, anyone seeking a long-term career in employing statistical methods needs to know how to apply Bayesian statistical methods to solve real world problems. This talk provides an overview of why it is useful to employ Bayesian methods, and it provides an example of how Bayesian statistics can be used to solve a complex and important problem. The talk will also touch upon what fundamental skills are needed to be a productive applied Bayesian statistician.\n\nJohn received his B.S. degree from the Stony Brook University with a double major in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.

Yet, do you know what the most proof-abundant geometry theorem might be that is situated on the circle? And what might be its most profound yet super-clever proof that reduces it to a statement a 3rd grader would have no trouble accepting? In this talk, we will delve into the method of Inversion in the Plane, which will not only solve this particular problem, but will open up opportunities for attacking a whole array of geometry problems that would otherwise be close to impossible to solve. Inversion in the Plane was one of the very first topics I learned while training on the Bulgarian team for the International Math Olympiads, and even to this day, it is still one of my favorite math topics that has taught me to never assume any boundaries on human imagination. Standard geometry background, no Calculus, and a certain amount of daring will be needed to engage in the talk.\n\nProfessor Zvezdelina Stankova (Zvezda) was drawn into the world of mathematics when, as a 5th grader, she joined the math circle at her school in Bulgaria and won, three months later, the Regional Math Olympiad. She represented her home country at two International Mathematical Olympiads (IMOs), earning silver medals. As a freshwoman at Sofia University, Zvezda won a competition to study in the U.S. and completed her undergraduate degree at Bryn Mawr College in 1993. She did her first math research in enumerative combinatorics at two summer programs in Duluth, Minnesota. The resulting papers contributed to her Alice T. Schafer Prize for Excellence in Mathematics by an Undergraduate Woman, awarded by the Association for Women in Mathematics. In 1997, Zvezda received a Ph.D. from Harvard University, with a thesis on moduli spaces of curves, in the field of algebraic geometry. She also earned a high school teaching certificate in the state of Massachusetts and later in California.\n\nAs a postdoctoral fellow at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) and UC Berkeley in 1997-1999, Zvezda co-founded the Bay Area Mathematical Olympiad and created the Berkeley Math Circle (BMC). She trained the USA national team for the IMOs for six years, including the memorable year 2001 when three of the six team members were BMCers, and USA tied with Russia for a second overall place in the world. She worked at Mills College 1999-2016, and she joined the faculty at UC Berkeley in the summer of 2016.\n\nZvezda’s inspiring style and passion to teach were recognized by the Mathematical Association of America (MAA): in 2004 she received the first Henry L. Alder Award for Distinguished Teaching by a Beginning College or University Mathematics Faculty Member. In 2011 MAA honored her with the highest math teaching award in the U.S., the Deborah and Franklin Tepper Haimo Award for Distinguished College or University Teachers who are widely recognized as extraordinarily successful and whose teaching effectiveness has shown to have influence beyond their own institutions. Zvezda was featured in the Salutes Program of the ABC 7 News in spring 2011. In 2012, she was listed in Princeton’s Review “300 Best Professors.” In fall 2015 she introduced a new middle school math program at Tehiyah Day School in El Cerrito, CA, and in fall 2016 she founded “Math Taught the Right Way” program for middle and high school students at UC Berkeley. Both programs are based on this textbook series.\n\nZvezda’s most enduring passion remains working at the BMC with young students motivated to discover new mathematical wonders.

To seek and obtain approval from the Food and drug Administration (FDA), a new therapy must be proven to be safe and effective. This requires testing new therapies under various conditions, initially in animal studies, then normal volunteers, and finally in patients. Proving safety and efficacy requires the use of rigorous statistical methodologies to ensure that type-1 error, i.e., the approval of an ineffective or unsafe therapy, is below the acceptable 0.05 level, while also providing high assurance (80-90% power) that a safe and effective new therapy will be granted approval. These objectives are achieved through robust study designs and analyses. Elements of good study designs require appropriate and efficient randomizations, blinded evaluations, understanding and minimizing sources of variability, selection of best statistical models, addressing unexpected and interfering factors, and correctly interpreting the results. Examples from the various stages of pharmaceutical development will be discussed.\n\nFor further information e-mail\n\nSMCCLINTOCK@wcupa.edu\n\nWest Chester University\n\nSpring 2019 Statistics Colloquium\n\npresents\n\nLife After My Masters in Applied Statistics From WCU - A Career and Research Journey\n\nDominique A. McDaniel Department of Statistics Purdue University\n\nThursday, March 21\n\n25 University Ave, Room 158\n\n4:15 PM\n\nDiseases are typically characterized by multiple measures, and subjects may choose to discontinue particular treatments due to intermediate outcomes, such as adverse side-effects. Accordingly, clinical trials for drug approvals must both evaluate treatment effects on multiple endpoints with appropriate Type I error rate control and account for intermediate outcomes to prevent biased inferences that could arise due to confounding. Existing statistical methodologies for clinical trials can only address these two issues separately, and cannot be easily extended to incorporate both simultaneously. In this research presentation, we will discuss the two critical issues of different types of multiple testing requirements for control of distinct Type I error rates, and principal strata that arise due to intermediate outcomes, in Phase III clinical trials. We will also propose a new Bayesian testing methodology that can account for the existence of principal strata while enabling more powerful testing of multiple endpoints in such clinical trials. The potential utility and power of our proposed methodology will be illustrated via simulation studies.\n\nDominique McDaniel is a PhD student in Statistics and Purdue Doctoral Fellow at Purdue University.

In particular, group theory provides a convenient setting for studying symmetry in geometry and for detecting high dimensional holes and twists in topology. By the very nature of a binary operation, it is only possible to form finite products and perform finite cancellations. However, when extra geometric structure is present, e.g. in the real line, it is possible form infinite sums and products like those introduced in Calculus II.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll provide a quick introduction to groups, focusing on free groups, whose elements are words in an alphabet. I’ll then discuss how we can extend the usual definition of group to a structure with a well-defined “infinitary operation” in which it is possible to form infinite products/words whose factors/letters might be ordered by the natural numbers or even the rationals. I’ll finish the talk with a discussion about how this kind of “infinitary algebra” is become increasingly important in algebraic topology.\n\nJeremy Brazas is an Assistant Professor of Mathematics who has been at West Chester University since 2017 and teaches most of the geometry and topology courses.

Yet many of the important works of Gauss, Abel, and Galois made no use at all of complex numbers. In most cases, I prefer the originals to the modern expositions of these works, because the originals are more constructive and make clearer the ideas that inspired them. Whether we prefer the originals or the modern versions, it is essential for historians of mathematics to understand that the originals are NOT attempts, awkward and only partially successful, to understand the modern versions. I will try to show the importance of this principle by explaining what I see as the virtues of these early works done without using complex numbers.\n\nEdwards received his Ph.D. in 1961 from Harvard University, under the supervi"
