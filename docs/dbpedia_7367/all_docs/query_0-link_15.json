Café con leche o cortado?\n\nTOP STORY: Can Primož Roglič be Competitive in la Vuelta a España?\n\nPrimož Roglič will start on Friday in Utrecht in the Vuelta a España 2022. Only this week did Jumbo-Visma decide whether the three-time winner would start. After his crash in the Tour de France, it was uncertain for a long time whether the Slovenian would be on the start-line to go for his fourth Vuelta win in a row.\n\nIt was only about two weeks before the start of the Vuelta that Roglič first started to train on the road for the first time after the crash. “I’m finally back on the road,” Roglič announced after he had been for a ride in the mountains above Monaco. For Jumbo-Visma, it is very important for the Vuelta team that Roglič starts in the Tour of Spain. Otherwise the Dutch formation would not have an obvious GC leader.\n\nIn the Tour de France, Roglič crashed on the cobble stage, but he carried on racing until stage 15 when the pain in his back was too much. Two broken vertebrae was mentioned, but never confirmed by the Jumbo-Visma team. The Slovenian has won the last three editions of the Vuelta, another win and he would be the record holder together with Roberto Heras, who won in 2000, 2003, 2004 and 2005. No one has ever won four in a row\n\nJumbo-Visma sports manager Merijn Zeeman was still skeptical about Roglic’s participation in the Vuelta a España. “It’s clear where those extreme pains came from. Primož hopes to make it to the Vuelta. It will be difficult,” Zeeman said recently.\n\nVuelta No.4 for Roglič?\n\nEuropean Championships – Men’s ITT 2022\n\nStefan Bissegger is the new European time trial champion. After a battle of seconds in Fürstenfeldbruck, near Munich, he was three tenths of a second faster than compatriot Stefan Küng, who was the title holder. The bronze medal went to World champion Filippo Ganna.\n\nThe first target time came from Mattia Cattaneo, an outside favourite. After 15.3 kilometres he set a time of 19:02 minutes, which made him 15 seconds faster than Oier Lazkano. Cattaneo didn’t enjoy that top time for long, because Kévin Vauquelin and Morten Hulgaard were faster than the Italian. Ben Healy went further below the fastest time with an 18:37 split and a 28:01 minute finish time, but his performance was swept off the tables by Stefan Bissegger. The Swiss rider clocked 18:07 after 15 kilometres. His finishing time of 27:05 minutes was almost a minute faster than Healy.\n\nWorld champion Filippo Ganna was only 24 hundredths faster than Stefan Bissegger on the first 700 meter climb, while previous European champion Stefan Küng was 6 seconds down on Ganna. Küng soon caught sight of Max Walscheid, who had started ahead of him. The German had crashed and could forget a good result. Küng managed to convert his advantage into a lead at the intermediate point after 15 kilometres. He was 1 second ahead of Ganna and 3 seconds ahead of Bissegger.\n\nIn the last 9 kilometres the decision was made. Küng and Ganna turned out to be no match for the target time set by Bissegger. Küng seemed on his way to gold, but eventually gave up 0.3 of a second to his countryman while Ganna finished 9 seconds behind Bissegger. They received the silver and bronze medals.\n\nEuropean Championships – Men ITT Result:\n\n1. Stefan Bissegger (Switzerland) in 27:06\n\n2. Stefan Küng (Switzerland) at 0:01\n\n3. Filippo Ganna (Italy) at 0:09\n\n4. Mikkel Bjerg Denmark) at 0:27\n\n5. Maciej Bodnar (Poland) at 0:37\n\n6. Ben Healy (Ireland) at 0:56\n\n7. Kévin Vauquelin (France) at 1:12\n\n8. Morten Hulgaard (Denmark) at 1:13\n\n9. Jos van Emden (Netherlands) at 1:22\n\n10. Tanel Kangert (Estonia) at 1:26.\n\nEuro TT cahamps’22:\n\nEuropean Championships – Women ITT 2022\n\nMarlen Reusser has extended her European time trial title. The Swiss rider was faster over the 24 kilometre course in Munich than World champion Ellen van Dijk, who was 5 seconds slower in second place. The bronze went to Riejanne Markus, 27 seconds behind Reusser.\n\nRight from the start in Fürstenfeldbruck the course climbed 700 metres, but there weren’t that many differences so soon. This happened on the flat sections later. Juliette Labous set a first target time after 15.3 kilometres, but Riejanne Markus, who started early, was much faster than the Frenchwoman. Markus clocked 21:15 at the timing point. At the finish, the Dutch road champion finished in 31:27 minutes and she took the hot seat.\n\nIt was only a matter of time before the two big favourites for the gold medal, current European champion Marlen Reusser and reigning World champion Ellen van Dijk. On the first climb of 700 meters, the Swiss rider managed to take an 11 second lead over Van Dijk. At the second intermediate point after 15.3 kilometres, Reusser still had an advantage over Van Dijk. The World champion had narrowed the gap to 9 seconds and had more than 8 kilometres to make up that difference. It didn’t work. At the finish she was 5 seconds slower than Reusser, so she had to settle for European championship silver again. Reusser’s winning time was 30:59.\n\nAudrey Cordon-Ragot finished fourth, well behind Markus. The only Belgian participant, Julie Van De Velde, finished seventh at 1.30 minutes from the gold medal.\n\nEuropean TT champion, Marlen Reusser (Switzerland): “It’s true that the preparation for this European Championships was far from optimal, but the last few days I have been training really hard again. So I knew it was on the cards, but every time trial is always a new challenge. I really regretted that I could only wear my European jersey once. So it’s no surprise that I really wanted to renew this title. My radio didn’t work. That was really irritating. All I heard was beeping, so I didn’t know how I was doing. Until then, I didn’t feel like this was my day. My Garmin was in my speed suit, so I had no idea of the values I was pedalling and my legs didn’t feel so good. Having Lisa in my sights gave me the mental boost I needed. I knew she could also do a time trial quickly, so the fact that I caught up with her convinced me that I was doing well after all. I’m super happy to renew my European title. I am grateful to everyone who helped me achieve this. My switch to Team SD Worx played an important role in this success. With the S-Works Shiv TT Disc I got a super fast bike and together with the staff of Swiss Cycling & Team SD Worx we worked hard on my aerodynamics. Every detail was figured out. I felt during my time trial that my bike set up felt really fast. This gold medal is the result of all that work.”\n\nEuropean Championships – Women ITT Result:\n\n1. Marlen Reusser (Switzerland) in 31:00\n\n2. Ellen van Dijk (Netherlands) at 0:06\n\n3. Riejanne Markus (Netherlands) at 0:28\n\n4. Audrey Cordon-Ragot (France) at 0:54\n\n5.

Agnieszka Skalniak-Sójka (Poland) at 1:51.\n\nEuro TT cahamps’22:\n\nPostNord Danmark Rundt – Tour of Denmark 2022\n\nOlav Kooij won the First Stage of the PostNord Danmark Rundt. In Køge, the young rider of Jumbo-Visma beat Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck) in a long sprint.\n\nThe PostNord Danmark Rundt saw the return of Egan Bernal, six months after his serious training crash into the back of a stationary bus. The 222.6 kilometre first stage was from Allerød to Køge, finishing on a local circuit of three laps. It was a stage for the sprinters.\n\nA leading group of six including Eirik Lunder (Team Coop), Adrian Banaszek (HRE Mazowsze Serce Polski), Rasmus Wallin & Sebastian Nielsen (Restaurant Suri-Carl Ras), Mads Kristensen (ColoQuick) and Nicklas Pedersen (Denmark national team). The sprinter’s teams ensured that the lead of the escapees never became too big. Bernal also tested his legs at the front of the peloton. Sixty kilometres from the finish there was a big crash in the middle of the bunch, which held many riders up. At the front; Lunder and Banaszek were dropped from the leading group, leaving Wallin, Nielsen, Kristensen and Pedersen. Due to the crash in the peloton, they were able to extend their lead of 40 seconds to over a minute.\n\nThe front part of the peloton waited for the crashed and held up riders to come back, after which they started to chase again. With 14 kilometres to go, the leading group had the peloton breathing down their neck. Pedersen tried to go alone for a while, but 10 kilometres from the finish everything was back together. Then it was up to the sprinter’s teams. Jumbo-Visma led the peloton through the technical final kilometres. The team were doing the lead-out work for Olav Kooij. Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl and Alpecin-Deceuninck came to the front a kilometre from the finish. A crash in the final caused a split in the peloton, but the battle continued at the front. Jasper Philipsen started the sprint from far out, but had Kooij on his wheel. With a strong final jump, the Dutchman took the stage victory. For Kooij it was his tenth victory of the season. He previously won two stages and the general classification in the Circuit Cycliste Sarthe, a stage in the Tour of Hungary, three stages and the general classification in the ZLM Tour and a stage in the Tour of Poland.\n\nStage winner and overall leader, Olav Kooij (Ned) Jumbo-Visma): “The goal was to win a stage and it’s great if you manage to do that at the first opportunity. It was a hectic sprint and the headwind made it extra difficult. Ultimately, I ended up in Philipsen’s wheel and saw the finish line quickly coming closer. Luckily I had the legs to pass him. On the last straight to the finish, we knew we needed enough manpower. We had to shift gears a little and luckily that worked out well. Christophe has already proven how good he is at this in the Tour. Having a lead-out like him is great. It would be nice if the jersey stays in the team.

The 20-year-old American of INEOS Grenadiers won the individual time trial on Stage 2 to take the leader’s jersey from Olav Kooij. On the 12.2 kilometre stage, Sheffield was 3 seconds faster than Mattias Skjelmose and 6 seconds faster than Christophe Laporte.\n\nOn the program was an individual time trial of 12.2 kilometres around Assens, with the intermediate point after 5.6 kilometres. Geraint Thomas started fairly early and clocked a time of 13:50 at the finish, good for an average speed of 52.9kph. Among the early starters was Johan Price Pejtersen, who conceded 7 seconds riding for the Danish national team. The next rider to come close to Thomas’s time was Mattias Skjelmose. The talented Dane of Trek-Segafredo, who has been aiming for his first professional victory for weeks, finished in 13:38 and was more than 11 seconds faster than the INEOS Grenadiers leader.\n\nSøren Kragh Andersen (DSM) made inroads into Skjelmose’s time at the time point, as did Christophe Laporte. The Jumbo-Visma Frenchman had the fastest time, but was 3 seconds slower than Skjelmose at the finish. He had to leave the hot seat and give up his spot to Magnus Sheffield. The young American of INEOS Grenadiers clocked a new top time of 13:35. Another favourite, Magnus Cort, managed to take 6th place 20 seconds down on Sheffield, while Jasper Stuyven lost 24 seconds to the American. Olav Kooij, the stage winner of the opening stage, eventually lost 1:47 to Sheffield and lost the blue leader’s jersey.\n\nPostNord Danmark Rundt – Tour of Denmark Stage 2 Result:\n\n1.

In La Souterraine, the French rider crossed the finish line with a small lead, after escaping from the peloton in the finalé.\n\nThe Tour de Limousin, a four-day stage race in the middle of France, started with a tough 176.4 kilometre stage between Verneuil-sur-Vienne and La Souterraine. Several riders tried to get away from the start, but no one managed. The bigger names in the peloton were interested in the bonuses for the first two intermediate sprints in the first 50 kilometres of the stage. TotalEnergies’ Sandy Dujardin won the first ahead of Kevin Enjoys (Groupama-FDJ) and Benoît Cosnefroy (AG2R Citroën), UAE Team Emirates’ Matteo Trentin took the second ahead of Vincenzo Albanese (EOLO-Kometa) and Dujardin. After the second intermediate sprint, a leading group of five formed, including Valentin Paret-Peintre (AG2R Citroën), Alexis Gougeard (B&B Hotels), Kenny Molly (Bingoal Pauwels Sauces WB), Joel Nicolau (Caja Rural-Seguros RGA) and Clément Carisey (Go Sport). They took a maximum of 6 minutes lead on the peloton. Halfway through the race, the peloton slowly but surely accelerated and the breakaway’s lead started to shrink. It was mainly the WorldTeams of Cofidis, Groupama-FDJ, UAE Team Emirates and Movistar who set the pace in rainy conditions. At 48 kilometres from the finish there was a crash in the peloton involving Cosnefroy, Guillaume Martin (Cofidis) and Alex Aranburu (Movistar).\n\nAt the front; the leading group tried to defend a 2 minutes lead, but the escapees were no match for the peloton and everything came together at 7 kilometres. After this merger, Groupama-FDJ’s Valentin Madouas attacked on the final climb of the day. The French rider took a small gap, but that turned out not to be enough. Movistar then led the peloton to the last kilometre. It looked like the stage would turn into a sprint, but not for Julien Simon. One kilometre from the finish, the French rider of TotalEnergies jumped away on the right side of the road, while the teams of the sprinters tried to position their leaders. Simon took a nice gap and that turned out to be enough for the victory. Earlier this year he won the Grand Prix du Morbihan in a similar way. Matteo Trentin crossed the line in second, Alex Aranburu was third.\n\n2nd on the stage and overall, Matteo Trentin (UAE Team Emirates): “Today we rode well and always together. In the end Rui did a really good job but Simon threw everyone off and he was strong up to the end. The legs are good and we are definitely ready to try again in the next few days.”\n\nTour du Limousin – Nouvelle Aquitaine Stage 1 Result:\n\n1. Julien Simon (Fra) TotalEnergies in 3:59:42\n\n2.

Benoît Cosnefroy (Fra) AG2R Citroën.\n\nLimousin’22 stage 1:\n\nThe Second Stage of the Tour du Limousin was won by Alex Aranburu. The Spaniard of Movistar was the fastest after almost 185 kilometres in a chaotic bunch sprint in the streets of Ribérac. Due to the bonus seconds, Aranburu is also the new leader in the French stage race.\n\nThe second stage of the Tour du Limousin consisted of a relatively flat stage with three climbs: the Côte des Basses Veyrinas (1.5km at 4.6%), the Côte de Siorac (1km at 5.0 %) and the Côte du Colombier (3.1km at 3%). The summit of that last hill was more than 20 kilometres from the finish.\n\nTwo riders from small French teams coloured the stage. Maxime Urruty (Nice Métropole Côte d’Azur) and Maël Guegan (U Nantes Atlantique) got more than 7 minutes ahead of the peloton. The sprinter’s teams were not worried about that. UAE Team Emirates and TotalEnergies in particular did the work for Fernando Gaviria, Matteo Trentin and overall leader Julien Simon. Due to a serious acceleration, the escapees were caught in the last 10 kilometres. Urruty was the last to be pulled in, 7 kilometres from the finish.\n\nThe expected bunch sprint came. The sprinters were brought forward by their teams in the technical final. Not a single train could make the difference, after which it was Aranburu who won the bunch sprint with a powerful finish. With his stage win, the Movistar rider scores 14 important UCI points in the fight against relegation from the WorldTour. Eduard-Michael Grosu was second behind Aranburu, ahead of Clément Venturini. The top 5 was completed by Matteo Trentin and Iván Garcia. Aranburu also took the overall lead due to his victory and the bonuses. He is 4 seconds ahead of Julien Simon, who had the leader’s jersey.\n\n3rd on the stage and 8th overall, Clément Venturini (AG2R Citroën): “I’m not far off. But it’s still too far. The team manoeuvred well up front and then I tried to be precise in my placement. I really fought until the end, without letting go; but without a rider who blocked me a bit, maybe there was a way to do better. I trained very hard in July with the goal of getting results. It’s been a long time since I raised my arms in victory and I really want to win. Tomorrow, the stage is tough and I feel that I am in good condition. We really have a great team and I hope we will achieve great things. For me, between now and the end of the season, all the races are important because I want to win.”\n\nTour du Limousin – Nouvelle Aquitaine Stage 2 Result:\n\n1.

Stay PEZ for everything Vuelta.\n\nRead the ‘PEZ Vuelta a España Preview’ HERE.\n\nLotto Soudal Announces Balanced Vuelta Team\n\nCedric Beullens, Steff Cras, Jarrad Drizners, Thomas De Gendt, Maxim Van Gils, Filippo Conca, Kamil Małecki and Harry Sweeny are the riders that will represent Lotto Soudal at the 2022 Vuelta a España. The balanced Belgian team targets stage victories.\n\n“I think we have a strong and balanced team for this final grand tour of the season”, says sports director Kurt Van de Wouwer. “We do not have a clear team leader and that offers opportunities to everyone in the team. With Thomas De Gendt we have someone who has seen and experienced it all. In 2017 he won a stage in the Vuelta and in this year’s Giro he has shown that he is still up to it. He will guide our young riders throughout their first grand tour. We have three grand tour debutants in this Vuelta: Cedric Beullens, Jarrad Drizners and Filippo Conca.”\n\n“Harry Sweeny has shown his good form in the Tour de l’Ain”, continues Van de Wouwer. “Filippo Conca, Kamil Małecki and Jarrad Drizners have also proven to be ready. Cedric Beullens could already get his opportunity during the opening weekend in The Netherlands, should there be enough wind. Maxim Van Gils will try to go for breakaways in the more difficult stages later on. And Steff Cras was 20th in last year’s GC. He will target the GC also this year and will try and fight for a good spot the entire Vuelta.”\n\nHarry Sweeny to ride la Vuelta:\n\nQuick-Step Alpha Vinyl to the Vuelta a España\n\nJulian Alaphilippe and Remco Evenepoel will spearhead the Wolfpack at the final Grand Tour race of the year\n\nRemco Evenepoel returns to Spain, the country where he took his first World Tour win, and some of his most unforgettable victories, but not before doing a short detour through Netherlands, from where the 77th edition of La Vuelta starts this Friday.\n\nHaving scored eleven victories so far this season, including a resounding triumph at Liège–Bastogne–Liège, Evenepoel will make just his second Grand Tour appearance at the race which will feature a 23.2km TTT on the opening day, a 31.3km individual time trial at the beginning of the second week and a total of nine summit finishes, before the grand finale in Madrid.\n\nA stage winner here in 2017, Julian Alaphilippe will be back for the first time since that spectacular Vuelta debut, and will be keen on showcasing his panache and rainbow jersey on what will be his last race before the World Championships in Australia. Also making the Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl team for the Spanish Grand Tour are Rémi Cavagna – a stage victor at the 2019 edition – Dries Devenyns, Fausto Masnada, Pieter Serry, Ilan Van Wilder and Louis Vervaeke.\n\n“Remco and Julian will be the leaders of the squad for this last Grand Tour of the season, one comprising many hard stages, from the Basque Country ones to those in the high mountains. For Remco, this will be a whole new adventure. He doesn’t start as a favourite for the general classification, and we will just take it day by day and see how things to”, said sports director Klaas Lodewyck. “Julian comes at the start after a tough season, but he has been working hard and will target some of the stages. The two of them have a strong supporting cast, the entire team is ready and motivated, and we look forward to the next couple of weeks.”\n\n19.08–11.09 La Vuelta ciclista a España (ESP) 2.UWT\n\nRiders:\n\nJulian Alaphilippe (FRA)\n\nRémi Cavagna (FRA)\n\nDries Devenyns (BEL)\n\nRemco Evenepoel (BEL)\n\nFausto Masnada (ITA)\n\nPieter Serry (BEL)\n\nIlan Van Wilder (BEL)\n\nLouis Vervaeke (BEL).\n\nSports Director: Davide Bramati (ITA), Klaas Lodewyck (BEL) & Geert Van Bondt (BEL).\n\nWhat can Remco Evenepoel do at la Vuelta?\n\nIPT to Play Multiple Cards at La Vuelta a España\n\nIsrael – Premier Tech has assembled an experienced and versatile team to take on the final Grand Tour of the season when La Vuelta a España gets underway on Friday.\n\nStarting with a 23 kilometre team time trial in Utrecht, the first three stages of the race will take place in The Netherlands before transferring to Spanish soil from stage four onwards.\n\nGC and stage win cards to play\n\nFocusing on both the General Classification and stage wins, IPT will look to continue its Grand Tour success after the team’s best Tour de France, says Sports Director Oscar Guerrero.\n\n“We have Mike Woods as our team leader for the General Classification. Mike has finished in the top ten overall in the past and this is the goal again this year. Out of the three Grand Tours, the Vuelta is definitely the one that suits him best in terms of the climbs and the stage profiles and I think we will see a great race from him. We also have Chris Froome who, as we saw at the Tour de France, is improving day by day and is really coming into form, so he will have a free card for the race,” says Guerrero.\n\n“Patrick Bevin, Alessandro De Marchi, Itamar Einhorn, Omer Goldstein, Carl Fredrik Hagen and Daryl Impey complete the team and when it comes to going for stage wins, all six riders have a solid card to play. In Daryl, we have a great road captain who is capable of winning, and if Paddy continues to climb like he has been, he can go for a punchy sprint finish. As always, Alessandro will be on the lookout for strong breakaway days, as will Carl Fredrik and Omer, and with Itamar, we have a good option for the sprint stages. We have a great team and I’m looking forward to seeing them race, starting with the team time trial on Friday where I think we can use our strong time trialists to get a good result.”\n\nA race with special memories\n\nHaving left the Tour de France with covid, Woods and Froome are excited to return to the Vuelta a España, a race that holds special memories for both riders. Two-time Vuelta a España stage winner Woods, who finished in seventh place overall in 2017, is confident ahead of his GC run.\n\n“I’m doing quite well after having Covid and I wasn’t impacted too long but it took me a fair amount of time to recover from the crash I sustained on stage 9 of the Tour de France so I definitely needed a bit of time off. I had two solid weeks of training where I started feeling like my old self on the bike and wrapped up a good training block in Andorra so I’m feeling confident and optimistic for the Vuelta. I think of all the Grand Tours, it is the one that suits me the best. I am really excited to do another GC run, especially at a race I have had success at in the past, finishing seventh in 2017 and also winning two stages. I got my first WorldTour win in the Vuelta and it’s a race that has always been close to my heart. I’m looking forward to getting back into the Basque Country and also kicking it off with a really cool team time trial,” explains Woods.\n\nAlthough his preparation was halted, Froome is looking to carry the team’s momentum from the Tour de France into the Spanish Grand Tour.\n\n“Covid hit me harder than expected but I’m fully recovered now and back to my normal training load. It wasn’t quite the buildup to the Vuelta that I had hoped for this year but I’m still very much looking forward to making the most of the race and helping Israel – Premier Tech get another successful Grand Tour in the bag. It’s no secret that the Vuelta is one of my favourite races on the calendar, and I can’t wait to get back to racing on the roads of Spain,” says Froome.\n\nAfter making his debut in 2021 and sprinting to two top-ten results, Israeli road race champion Itamar Einhorn is looking to go even better when he lines up for his second participation.\n\n“I’m going for the sprints at the Vuelta a España. Looking at the roster, I don’t have a full lead out train but I have a few good guys who can help me and also by myself I can make a good sprint. So hopefully, I can win a stage as I think it’s possible when everything comes together. I’m excited to start the Vuelta, it’s a really nice event and it’s really cool that we can start in the Netherlands and move around like this,” adds Einhorn.\n\nIsrael – Premier Tech at La Vuelta a España (August 19 – September 11):\n\nPatrick Bevin (NZ)\n\nAlessandro De Marchi (ITA)\n\nItamar Einhorn (ISR)\n\nChris Froome (UK)\n\nOmer Goldstein (ISR)\n\nCarl Fredrik Hagen (NOR)\n\nDaryl Impey (RSA)\n\nMichael Woods (CAN)\n\nSports Directors: Oscar Guerrero, Rene Andrle, Dror Pekatch.\n\nINEOS Grenadiers Vuelta a España 2022 Roster\n\nThe INEOS Grenadiers are pleased to confirm their line-up for the final Grand Tour of the 2022 season, the Vuelta a España.\n\nThe team is going all out to win the race, with a balance of Grand Tour-proven talent and youthful exuberance to make its presence felt throughout.\n\nLine-up: Richard Carapaz, Tao Geoghegan Hart, Ethan Hayter, Luke Plapp, Carlos Rodríguez, Pavel Sivakov, Ben Turner, Dylan van Baarle.\n\nHayter, Plapp, Rodríguez and Turner will all make their Grand Tour debuts in Spain, marking a key moment in their impressive development.\n\n2020 Giro d’Italia winner Geoghegan Hart, recent Vuelta a Burgos champion Sivakov and Paris Roubaix victor van Baarle complete the line-up, alongside Carapaz.\n\nRod Ellingworth, Deputy Team Principal said: “Our team for the Vuelta is a really exciting one; a great mix of experience and youth, which we believe will produce some outstanding racing.\n\n“To have four Grand Tour debutants in Carlos, Luke, Ethan and Ben reinforces the belief we have in the quality of our young riders and we know that they’ll provide fantastic support for Richie in his last Grand Tour with us. All four have impressed in 2022 and this will be the next big step in their development at the very highest level.\n\n“As a previous winner, and having placed second in 2020, we’re looking forward to Richie drawing on that experience and leading the team as the race heads for Madrid, in what undoubtedly will be a very exciting edition of the Vuelta.\n\n“Dylan, Pavel and Tao provide invaluable experience to complete a group we believe can deliver some incredible moments in the final Grand Tour of a brilliant season.\n\n“I know that the riders and the staff will be going all out to finish this part of our campaign on a high, and we look forward to a successful race together.”\n\nINEOS Grenadiers Vuelta a España Team\n\nRichard Carapaz – 29, Ecuador\n\nCarapaz is taking to the line for his second Grand Tour of the year, after placing second at the Giro d’Italia back in May. The Ecuadorian will start the race as team leader, supported by a mix of experienced as well as developing talent. Having placed second on GC at the 2020 edition of this race, the Olympic gold medallist is looking to go one better in Spain.\n\nTao Geoghegan Hart – 27, Great Britain\n\nThe 2020 Giro d’Italia winner comes into the Vuelta after being a key member of the winning team at the Vuelta a Burgos. This will be Geoghegan Hart’s third Vuelta a España, a race he loves. The mountain stages so synonymous with this race are where Geoghegan Hart excels and he will grab chances of his own as well as helping his team leader.\n\nEthan Hayter – 23, Great Britain\n\nFresh from his breakthrough WorldTour stage race win at the Tour de Pologne, Hayter will be fighting it out in the sprints. As one of the team’s Grand Tour debutants, the Vuelta will provide invaluable experience to Hayter as his development continues at the top level. The current GB national time trial champion will also have the chance to demonstrate his strength in the individual time trial, as well as the team time trial on the opening stage.\n\nLuke Plapp – 21, Australia\n\nPlapp stormed into his first year in the WorldTour, becoming Australian national road champion in January, then racking up three top five Young Rider jerseys as well as third on GC at the Tour of Norway. The Vuelta a España will be Plapp’s first Grand Tour, a great opportunity for the WorldTour debutant to learn and seize his chances during the race.\n\nCarlos Rodríguez – 21, Spain\n\nFour top five GCs at stage races this year, as well as the Spanish national road race title leaves no doubt about the bright future ahead for Rodríguez. Lining up for his first Grand Tour in his home country promises to be a very special moment for the talented 21-year-old.\n\nPavel Sivakov – 25, France\n\nIt was great to see Frenchman Sivakov back onto the podium in recent weeks, taking the overall at Vuelta a Burgos and second at Donostia San Sebastian Klasikoa. This will be Sivakov’s fourth Grand Tour and third hit out at the Vuelta a España, where he looks forward to sharing his experience and seizing his chances along the way.\n\nBen Turner – 23, Great Britain\n\nRecently placing 7th at the Commonwealth Games road race and 4th at the British national road race back in June, Turner has shown impressively consistent form across the year, most notably during his first full Classics season at WorldTour level, which included a hard fought 11th place at Paris-Roubaix. Another of the team’s GT debutants, Turner is relishing his ride at the Vuelta a España, and will be all in for the team.\n\nDylan van Baarle – 30, Netherlands\n\nThis has been van Baarle’s most successful year on the WorldTour, winning in style at Paris-Roubaix and finishing 2nd at the iconic Tour of Flanders. Van Baarle has been a much valued Grand Tour domestique for the Grenadiers for a number of years, and is lining up for his second GT of 2022, his fourth Vuelta a España and twelfth career Grand Tour.\n\nTeam DSM Reveal 2022 Vuelta a España Roster\n\nAn excursion into the Netherlands awaits the peloton as they take on this year’s Vuelta a España, with Team DSM revealing an eight-rider strong roster that will line-up in Utrecht to take on an action-packed 21 days of racing at La Vuelta as the curtain on the Grand Tour calendar draws to a close.\n\nGetting under way, a predominantly flat route lays ahead of the bunch in the Netherlands, starting with a fast 23-kilometre time trial through the streets of Utrecht before two days which should see the sprinters do battle for stage honours; unless the infamous Dutch wind has a role to play. Heading back to the north of Spain after their travel day, a succession of challenging and hilly terrain lends itself to exciting and attacking racing, with several tough hilltop and mountain finishes; including the brutally steep Nava finale that returns after its inclusion in 2018. Following the first rest day a long individual effort against the clock will put the racing rhythm back into the riders’ legs before they take on some days that could suit the attackers or sprinters. A handful of mountain-top finishes will also shake things up while the second week concludes at altitude with the bunch reaching 2500 metres above sea level atop Sierra Nevada. Racing concludes with a mixed bag of terrain in the final week, where every type of rider will find a route that suits them and should result in some fierce battles for the breakaway.\n\nAiming to build on their good recent form and momentum due to well thought-out and planned training, alongside targeted racing and altitude camps, Team DSM’s Vuelta a España squad are ready to take their jersey around the Netherlands and Spain as they race offensively, whilst keeping an eye on the GC throughout the three weeks.\n\nTeam DSM coach Matt Winston said: “We’re looking forward to the Vuelta and the start in the Netherlands; with some hard stages beginning with the team time trial and then two potential sprint days where we also need to be really sharp on potential crosswinds. Returning to Spain we immediately have some hard days in the Basque Country, making for a tough first week; before breakaway opportunities, a time trial, sprint stages and tough mountain days follow in week two and three. We will look to hold Thymen in the GC and not lose time early in the race, taking a day-by-day approach with him. Alongside that, we have plenty of guys that are hungry for the breakaways and will look for opportunities to go for stage results from those moves. We have a nice mix of youth and experience in our squad and we’re all excited to get the final Grand Tour of the season underway.”\n\nFull line-up:\n\nThymen Arensman\n\nNikias Arndt\n\nMarco Brenner\n\nJohn Degenkolb\n\nMark Donovan\n\nJonas Iversby Hvideberg\n\nJoris Nieuwenhuis\n\nHenri Vandenabeele.\n\nTeam Bahrain Victorious Head to La Vuelta\n\nThe final Grand Tour of the cycling season gets underway this Friday, August 19th, and Bahrain Victorious head to the ‘Gran Partida’ with a strong team & high hopes for both the GC and stage victories.\n\nLeading the line-up, and riding on home roads, is Mikel Landa, who starts the race for a 6th time. Landa finished on the podium at this year’s Giro d’Italia and was a stage winner at La Vuelta in 2015.\n\nThe 32-year-old will have some stiff competition for the red jersey in Madrid on September 11th, including Primoz Roglič (aiming for a record-equalling 4th victory) and recent Grand Tour champions Richard Carapaz, Simon Yates, Jai Hindley & Tao Geoghegan-Hart.\n\nCo-leading the team is Swiss sensation Gino Mäder, winner of the Youth Classification & 5th overall last year, as well as a stage winner at the Giro. The 25-year-old already has a stage-race podium this season, finishing 2nd at the Tour de Romandie in May.\n\nThe 77th edition of Spain’s Grand Tour starts in Utrecht, making the Dutch city the first to have hosted the opening stage of all three GTs (following Le Tour in 2015 & The Giro in 2017). Friday’s 23.3km Team Time Trial provides the very real possibility of time gaps ahead of two flat days.\n\nLead Sports Director Franco Pellizotti – himself a veteran of 13 Grand Tours, believes the opportunity is there for the team to perform well again after taking one stage, one jersey, and the Team Classification in 2021.\n\n“For the GC, we have Mikel. Let’s see how his condition is. With Gino Mäder as co-leader, we have a strong squad for all terrains. We’re looking to do a good TTT, and have 3 good stages in Holland, so we arrive in Spain without time gaps.”\n\nAs usual La Vuelta has multiple uphill finishes, with three coming early, on stages 6, 8 &amp, 9 in Asturias and the Basque Country. Whilst the overall winner is unlikely to be decided at this stage, it will be a phase of the race which could easily have a significant impact on the final standings. Pellizotti is convinced that we can make a difference on those stages too, with in-form riders Santiago Buitrago & Fred Wright.\n\n“When we get to Spain, the ‘real’ Vuelta begins, with the 1st week in the Basque Country, and the stages are demanding straight away. We’ll hope to have some fun on the breakaway days with Santiago, who’s in great shape, and with Fred on the stages that suit him.”\n\nBuitrago has won stages this season at the Saudi Tour, the Giro (where he finished 2nd in the Youth Classification), and most recently, the Vuelta a Burgos, and Wright impressed at the Tour de France before winning a medal at the Commonwealth Games.\n\nWeek 2 begins with a 30km individual Time Trial and includes three days in the mountains, most notably Stage 15. The 152.6kms between Martos and Sierra Nevada includes over 4000m of ascent and ends atop a Hors Categorie summit at 2501m.\n\nProtecting our leaders on the flatter sections of the race will be Italian youngster Edoardo Zambanini and Jasha Sütterlin, both making their La Vuelta debuts. And completing our team in Spain will be this year’s winner of the Vuelta a Andalucia, Wout Poels, and 2014 Vuelta King of the Mountains, the experienced Spaniard Luis León Sánchez.\n\nThe last phase of this year’s race is a mixture of chances for sprinters, breakaway specialists, and climbers. The penultimate stage comprises 5 categorised climbs and a 9th mountaintop finale before the traditional ceremonial ride around Madrid.\n\nThe Vuelta a España is always a fascinating, exciting, and brutal end to the Grand Tour season, and this year’s route promises more of the same. For Team Bahrain Victorious, it could provide a positive start to the closing period of the racing calendar. Pellizotti concludes: “I think we have a great team for this parcours, and I’m convinced we can get a good result on GC. And in individual stages, we have lots of cards to play.”\n\nThe 2022 Vuelta a España starts in Utrecht, The Netherlands, on Friday 19th August at 1830 CET.\n\nPreview Vuelta – “A solid group of climbers for a top ten in Madrid”\n\nFor the second time in its history, Intermarché-Wanty-Gobert Matériaux will participate at the Tour of Spain (2.UWT). The third Grand Tour of the season will start on Friday August 19th in Utrecht (The Netherlands) and head to the finish in Madrid on September 11th.\n\nThe World Team experienced a red dream in its first participation last year, thanks to the stage win of Rein Taaramäe on top of the Picón Blanco. The team then defended the red leader’s jersey of Taaramäe (2 days) and later Eiking (7 days) during almost half of the event.\n\nParcours\n\nThe Netherlands welcome the first three stages of this 77th edition, with a team time trial as opening stage followed by two entirely flat stages. The peloton will then travel to the Basque Country for three hilly stages towards Laguardia, Bilbao and the climb San Miguel de Aguayo, which welcomes the first uphill finish (12.5km at 6,6%).\n\nThe first week ends with two other uphill finishes in Asturia: Colláu Fancuaya (10.3 km at 7.8%) on day eight and Les Praeres de Nava (3.8 km at 13%) the next day. After the rest day, the only individual time trial of this edition follows the direction of Alicante on an entirely flat course of 31 kilometre.\n\nThe finish in Cabo de Gata at the end of the eleventh stage is the first opportunity for sprinters on Iberian soil, before a finish on top of Peñas Blancas (19.8 km at 6.4%) the next day. The final rest day is preceded by two mountain top finishes in Andalusia, respectively the Sierra de la Pandera and Sierra Nevada (2500 meter) on day fourteen and fifteen.\n\nThe final straight towards Madrid contains two mountain top finishes on Monasterio de Tentudía (9.3km at 5.1%) and Alto de Piornal (13.3km at 5.6%) on day seventeen and eighteen. These are followed by a short stage around Talavera de la Reina, with a double passage on Puerto del Piélago (9km at 5.9%), a tough day in the Sierra de Guadarrama leading to the Puerto de Navacerrada (1850 meter) and the closing stage in the Spanish capital.\n\nSelection\n\nThe selection under the direction of Pieter Vanspeybrouck, Valerio Piva and Jean-Marc Rossignon contains three riders who finished in the top ten of a Grand Tour this season. Louis Meintjes, the eight of the Tour de France GC, returns to La Vuelta for an eighth participation (10th in 2015, 12th in 2017). The South-African climber was provisionally in the top ten of last year’s Tour of Spain, until he was forced to abandon following a crash in the penultimate stage.\n\nHe will be accompanied by Jan Hirt and Domenico Pozzovivo, who finished sixth and eight in the Tour of Italy in May. The Czech stage winner in the latest Giro will line up for his tenth Grand Tour. The Italian climber already finished in the top ten (6th in 2013) and will start the 23rd Grand Tour of his career.\n\nEstonian rider Rein Taaramäe returns to the race in which he became the first rider of the team to wear a leader’s jersey in a Grand Tour thanks to his stage win on Picon Blanco, ten years after his success in Lagos de Somiedo. Belgian rider Jan Bakelants, who finished seventeenth of the Vuelta twice, is the other Grand Tour stage winner in the selection.\n\nSprinter Gerben Thijssen and his lead out Boy Van Poppel will participate in the Vuelta for the second time. Thijssen showed himself in 2020 by sprinting to second and fifth place in flat stages. The first stages on home soil are even more special for van Poppel, who will pass only a couple of kilometres from home in the third stage. The sprint train is completed by the Dane Julius Johansen, who will make his Grand Tour debut.\n\nPieter Vanspeybrouck (Sports Director): “The top 10 in the GC of the Tour and the Giro from Louis Meintjes, Jan Hirt and Domenico Pozzovivo reinforced our initial plans to send a solid group of climbers to this third and last Grand Tour of the season. In this way, we can increase our tactical choices in order to obtain a top ten in Madrid. We can refine our strategy after the expected chaos in the Netherlands and the explosive stages in the Basque Country. Our sprinter Gerben Thijssen has made several steps forward this season. His brilliant victory in the recent Tour de Pologne shows that he’s ready to sprint for stage victories in the flat stages. He can rely on the support of Julius Johansen and Boy van Poppel, two fixed teammates in his sprint train, who led him to the win in Poland. I’m convinced about our capabilities to win on all terrains. With Jan Bakelants and Rein Taaramäe we also have strong assets for the transition stages and in long breakaways. Taaramäe showed it in the Giro on the Etna and Bakelants did the same in the Dauphiné.”\n\nLine up:\n\nJan Bakelants\n\nJan Hirt\n\nJulius Johansen\n\nLouis Meintjes\n\nDomenico Pozzovivo\n\nRein Taaramäe\n\nGerben Thijssen\n\nBoy van Poppel.\n\nSports Directors: Pieter Vanspeybrouck, Valerio Piva & Jean-Marc Rossignon.\n\n2022 La Vuelta Marks Last Spanish Event for Alejandro Valverde\n\nLA VUELTA GUIDE | All info on Movistar Team + the Spanish GT\n\n‘Campionissimo’ from Murcia, a GC winner in 2009, spearheads Movistar Team lineup at Blues’ home Grand Tour, where ‘Bala’ has claimed major success over the years.\n\nThe 77th edition of La Vuelta, which starts in Utrecht (Netherlands) on Friday 19th, will be a hugely significant moment for the Movistar Team. It will be the last competition on Spanish soil for Alejandro Valverde, its star and reference for nearly two decades and winner of the overall classification in 2009, as well as a dozen stages and provider of unmeasurable joy over the years.\n\nFor Alejandro’s final appearance in the Spanish Grand Tour (starts August 19th, ends in Madrid on September 11th), the organisation managed by Eusebio Unzué will bring an eight-man lineup that includes, other than ‘Bala’, the likes of Enric Mas -2nd overall in 2021- Carlos Verona, José Joaquín Rojas, Nelson Oliveira, Mathias Norsgaard, Gregor Mühlberger and Lluís Mas.\n\nTwo time trials – the inaugural TTT, over 23 km, and an ITT of 30km between Elche and Alicante (Tuesday 30th August) – and plenty of mountains in the north (Pico Jano, Fancuaya, Les Praeres), Andalusia (Hoya de la Mora, La Pandera, Peñas Blancas) and the Meseta (Tentudía, Piornal, Guadarrama) will decide the outcome of the final three-week stage race this year.\n\nOur Vuelta a España roster\n\nEsteban Chaves, Hugh Carthy, and Rigoberto Urán lead EF Education-EasyPost into the Vuelta\n\nEsteban Chaves, Hugh Carthy, and Rigoberto Urán will lead EF Education-EasyPost in the race for the red jersey at the Vuelta a España.\n\nFrom the flatlands of the Netherlands, where the Vuelta is set to start, over Spain’s explosive climbs, to the finish three weeks later in Madrid, Esteban, Hugh, and Rigo will count on strong teammates in their general-classification hunt. James Shaw and Julius van den Berg will keep them at the front of the peloton and out of the wind, while climbers Jonathan Caicedo, Mark Padun, and Merhawi Kudus will lead them to the cruxes of the Vuelta’s steepest mountains—and seize opportunities to go for stage victories themselves.\n\n“With Esteban, Rigo, and Hugh in the team, we have three riders who have been on the podium in big tours,” says EF Education-EasyPost sports director Juanma Gárate. “We want to do a good GC with them.”\n\nEsteban is looking forward to his first grand tour in his EF Education-EasyPost shirt.\n\n“It’s been some time since I have ridden a Grand Tour, and this one is a special one,” Esteban says. “I’m excited to start La Vuelta. It has always treated me right, and we have a very good team this year. It will be my first grand tour with EF Education-Easypost. This makes me a little nervous, but on the other hand, it also gives me a lot of motivation, and it encourages me to ride the best I can. We have Rigo, Hugh, and me for the GC, and we will never discard a chance for a stage win, not only with us three, but also the rest of the team.”\n\nJuanma thinks that Esteban might surprise a lot of fans.\n\n“I really want to see what Esteban can do,” Juanma says. “This year is a big change for him. He has changed teams, changed trainers, changed bikes. He has had to work hard to get back to his level. He is in a good way. I think he is going to be good.”\n\nRigoberto Urán will start the Vuelta just a few weeks after finishing the Tour de France. He is hungry to show that he is still one of the best bike racers in the world.\n\n“Let’s see with Rigo,” Juanma says. “He didn’t have a good Tour de France, and now he wants to do a good GC at the Vuelta. It is hard to do two tours in a year, but he is professional.”\n\nRigo is ready.\n\n“I wasn’t in my best shape at the Tour and at the beginning of the season with some bad days and crashes, so I need some luck,” Rigo says. “Now, I feel good, motivated. Not only that, I’m excited to start La Vuelta because I know there won’t be a lot more opportunities for me at my age. The Vuelta is the only grand tour where I haven’t won a stage or been on the podium. After the Tour, I felt strong, and have been training a lot at home, so I’m in good shape. Hugh’s good, Chaves too. When I go to a Grand Tour, it’s because I feel good, and because I want to give my best for the team.”\n\nFor Hugh, a good ride at the Vuelta will mean a lot.\n\n“Hugh had a confirmation during the Giro that he is back for GC,” Juanma says. “He finished the Giro with an impressive ride on the last day on the Marmolada. His morale is high. During our last races in Spain, I saw that his level is getting better and better. He is going to be ready for the Vuelta. He is on a good track.”\n\nThe Spanish grand tour is close to Hugh’s heart.\n\n“For me, personally, the Vuelta is a special race, because my career began in Spain, and my first grand tour was the Vuelta back in 2016,” he says. “My ambition is to try and do a good GC. Above all, I want to have a good performance and do my best as always. I like this year’s course. It has a wide variety of stages and a unique feel, starting in the Netherlands. It should be an exciting three weeks.”\n\nIt sure should. The Vuelta kicks off Friday in Utrecht with a team time trial. After two more stages in the Netherlands, our team will head south to Spain to race over some of the hardest climbs the sport of cycling has ever seen, under the full heat of the Spanish sun. It’s the final grand tour of the year, but might be the most difficult. Esteban Chaves, Hugh Carthy, and Rigoberto Urán are riding for GC. That doesn’t mean we’re going to be conservative. At this Vuelta, we’re going to attack.\n\nHugh Carthy looking for a good Vuelta:\n\nTramadol Found in Nairo Quintana Blood Tests: Removed from Tour de France Results\n\nNairo Quintana’s results in the 2022 Tour de France have been cancelled. The leader of Arkéa-Samsic – who finished sixth in the Tour – has been disqualified, because traces of the painkiller Tramadol were found in blood tests during the Tour de France. The use of Tramadol in competition has been banned by the UCI since 2019.\n\nThe UCI reported Quintana’s violation. He has been penalised on the basis of the UCI Medical Rules, the purpose of which is to ensure the safety and health of riders due to the side effects of certain substances. The international cycling union has announced that traces of Tramadol have been found during two blood tests during the Tour de France (on July 8 and 13).\n\nFor that reason Quintana has been removed from the result of the Tour. The Colombian climber now has ten days to appeal this punishment to the CAS. The UCI emphasises that this is not a doping violation and that Quintana has not been suspended for this violation. He can participate in the Vuelta a España, which starts on Friday in Utrecht.\n\nTramadol can be a dangerous substance for cyclists. Besides the fact that the painkiller allows a rider to go deeper, it can also cause nausea and a spinning sensation, which can lead to a crash. This UCI rule has been in effect since 1 March 2019 and deviates from the WADA rules. If a rider is caught with Tramadol in his system, he will not be allowed to participate in the race or will be removed from the race result afterwards. The latter has happened to Quintana. Teams can also be punished if two riders test positive for the use of Tramadol.\n\nNairo Quintana Denies Using Tramadol\n\nNairo Quintana has denied ever taking Tramadol in an initial response. The Colombian leader of Arkéa-Samsic made this known on his social media. Quintana was told on Wednesday that his results of the Tour de France 2022 have been canceled due to traces of the banned painkiller.\n\n“The announcement from the UCI comes as a surprise to me. I strongly deny that I ingested that drug. I have never used Tramadol in my entire career,” said Quintana. “I want to emphasise again that I will just ride the Vuelta. On the bike I will show the best of myself for my team, country and followers. With my team of lawyers, we are now preparing for my defense.”\n\nHis team Arkéa-Samsic released a short statement on Wednesday. In it, it listed the facts from the UCI press release and indicated that the team would not comment further. Quintana, as he points out, has not committed any doping violation according to the UCI. That is why he is only disqualified in the result of the Tour. His sixth place in the final standings and all his points scored in the stages have been cancelled. There is no question of a suspension. He can appeal to the CAS sports tribunal within ten days.\n\nQuintana to loose Tour results:\n\nJonas Vingegaard Not Riding the World Championships in Wollongong\n\nJonas Vingegaard will not be part of the Danish team for the World championships in Wollongong next month. The national coach, Anders Lund, announced the absence of the winner of the last Tour de France. “Jonas Vingegaard will not be part of the World Cup squad because he has chosen to focus on other goals at Jumbo-Visma,” Lund said on the Danish Cycling Federation’s website. The 25 year-old GC rider has never competed at a World championship for professionals before. He did ride the 2018 U23 World championships in Innsbruck where he finished in 64th place.\n\nLund did announce the first four names for the road race. Mattias Skjelmose of Trek-Segafredo, Jakob Fuglsang (Israel-Premier Tech), Søren Kragh Andersen (DSM) and Magnus Cort (EF Education-EasyPost) are already assured of starting. “Those four riders all showed a very high level last season and I am convinced that they will deliver a strong performance on the tough course in Wollongong.”\n\nThe final four riders will be selected on August 29. The World Cycling Championships will be held in Wollongong, Australia, from September 18-25.\n\nNo Worlds for Vingegaard:\n\nEgan Bernal Satisfied with First Race Kilometres\n\nEgan Bernal has his first race under his belt since his crash. The Colombian, who has not raced for months after a training accident in January this year, successfully completed the opening stage of the Tour of Denmark on Tuesday. “It was a fast stage, but I felt good,” Bernal told feltet.dk afterwards.\n\n“I’m glad I got through it well,” said Bernal about the 222.6-kilometre first stage from Allerød to Køge. “No pain and a good feeling, that was the goal.” The INEOS Grenadiers climber rode his first race since September 2021, when he finished sixth in the Vuelta a España. “But it was good to be in the peloton. The first ten kilometres were a bit strange, but after that it was fine.”\n\nIn the final, Bernal was still at the front of the peloton, where he worked for his teammates. He crossed the line in 105th place, just over two minutes behind stage winner Olav Kooij. “In the final I didn’t want to take any risks, so I took it easy in the last kilometres,” explained the 2019 Tour winner.\n\nEgan Bernal back racing:\n\nNairo Quintana Extends his Contract with Arkéa-Samsic\n\nNairo Quintana has extended his contract with Arkéa-Samsic. The Colombian climber will race for the French team next season, he has been with Arkéa since 2020.\n\nFor team manager Emmanuel Hubert, Quintana is one of the driving forces of his team, together sprinter Nacer Bouhanni and all-rounder Warren Barguil. “The team is now knocking on the door of the WorldTour. Nairo’s contract extension is the result of our common will to further develop our squad. He is a world-class climber and had an exemplary 2022 season in every way, both in the short stage races and the Tour de France.”\n\nQuintana sees his current team as ‘like family’ and quickly knew that he wanted to extend his contract. “I have a lot of appreciation for Emmanuel Hubert. He reached out to me at the end of 2019 and I have not forgotten him. The team has grown since I’ve been there, and it continues to do so. We started to get good results together in 2020, and that continued last year. This great momentum has continued again this year.”\n\nQuintana won a stage and the general classification this year in both the Tour de La Provence and the Tour des Alpes Maritimes et du Var. He was also fourth in the Volta a Catalunya, fifth in Paris-Nice and sixth in the Tour de France. Tomorrow (Friday) he will start in the Vuelta a España.\n\nQuintana to stay with Arkéa-Samsic:\n\nTom Dumoulin Stops\n\nTom Dumoulin has retired from cycle racing with immediate effect. The Dutchman had already announced his retirement from cycling, but would ride a few more races this autumn, including the World time trial championship in Australia. Now, however, Dumoulin has decided to end his career with immediate effect.\n\n“Tom Dumoulin has decided to stop his cycling career immediately,” Jumbo-Visma wrote on social media. Dumoulin added: “I worked hard for it, took a lot of passion and pleasure out of it, and delivered brilliant performances. I’ll never forget.”\n\nIn a response on his own social media, Dumoulin elaborates on his farewell. “About two months ago I announced that I would retire as a professional cyclist at the end of the year. Despite the love for the bike, I noticed all spring that it wasn’t going the way I wanted and that I was ready for a new phase of life. I did have one project very high on my wish list to get there one last time and end my career with a bang. That was the World championships in Australia.”\n\n“I had the dream of tackling the road there as I did in the Games in Tokyo. With a sense of freedom, in my way, on my terms, with the support of my team and with my own intrinsic motivation as the main fuel. That brought back the fun on the bike I was looking for.”\n\n“But I notice that I simply can’t do it anymore,” Dumoulin continued. “The tank is empty, the legs feel heavy and the training sessions are not working as I had hoped and as needed for a good performance at the World championships. Since my hard crash in training last September, something has broken again. I had to interrupt the way back up again and deal with another disappointment. It was one too many.”\n\n“Even though the farewell didn’t turn out the way I hoped, I look back on my career with incredible pride. I worked hard for it, I took a lot of passion and pleasure from it for many years and I delivered brilliant performances. I will remember that.”\n\nAnd now? “Now it’s time to enjoy other things in my life and be there for the people I love. A big thank you to the team and everyone who has supported me in this fantastic career. And a special thank you to my wife, who has been there for me all these years,” concluded the 2017 Giro winner.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dumoulin should have started in the Tour of Denmark, but not now. The last race in Dumoulin’s career was the Clásica San Sebastián, at the end of July. The Dutchman did not reach the finish. He had to withdraw from the Profronde van Etten-Leur due to illness, this would have been his farewell to the Dutch public.\n\nTom Dumoulin ends his racing career:\n\nAustralian Trio Durbridge, Hamilton & Scotson Commit to Team BikeExchange-Jayco Through to 2024\n\nAn Australian trio of Luke Durbridge, Lucas Hamilton and Callum Scotson have confirmed their commitment to Team BikeExchange-Jayco, signing new two-year contracts to see them through to 2024, as three important and core members of the squad.\n\nDurbridge, one of the inaugural riders on the team, having joined the Australian outfit in its first season back in 2012, will see his new contract take his tenure with GreenEDGE Cycling to 13 seasons. ‘Durbo’ has been one of the squad’s key domestiques over the years, with no less than eight Tour de France appearances, confirming his selfless and hardworking nature and his consistency as a rider to deliver over a variety of terrain.\n\nHamilton, a 26-year-old talented climber, has gone from strength to strength over the past five years since turning professional with Team BikeExchange-Jacyo back in 2017, and has displayed his climbing pedigree on multiple occasions at the biggest races on the calendar. A rider with a lot of potential to succeed himself, but also as a hardworking teammate, Lucas will continue to be a big part of the squad’s future, as it looks to target more success in Grand Tours and hilly stage races across the calendar.\n\nFinally, Scotson, one of the team’s crucial members of the ‘engine room’, has continued to be a key foundation of many successful team line-ups as a powerhouse on the flat, assisting with sprint finishes and also a strong climber in his own right. As he begins his fifth season with GreenEDGE Cycling, the squad is confident that there is still a lot more to unleash within Scotson and value him as an important member for the future seasons.\n\nBrent Copeland – General Manager: “Re-signing these three Australian riders, Durbridge, Hamilton and Scotson was very important for us as an organisation as they have all proven to be key members of the team, on and off the bike, as hardworking teammates but also for achieving results in their own right. These three riders all have very different strengths and are very versatile riders that are very much valued on this team.\n\nDurbridge is one of the original riders to join GreenEDGE Cycling, he has been here from the start, and he knows the ins and outs of the organisation and has developed so much over the years, becoming one of the more experienced riders on the team. Hamilton and Scotson are still both young and we believe they both have a lot more left to give. As we look to the future, as GreenEDGE Cycling begins its 12th season in the WorldTour, we are very happy to continue to work with these three Australian riders that keep our culture and hardworking ethic very much alive.”\n\nLuke Durbridge: “This team is like home for me, I have been here since the start in 2012 and it is really special to continue for two more years. I thoroughly enjoy working with all the staff and riders in the team through all the highs and the lows, and the team has been supporting me every season. Team BikeExchange-Jayco is changing and continuing to get stronger with the likes of Groenewegen joining and boosting the sprint team even more and I am looking forward to continuing to be a part of the team’s success in the sprints, time trials and Grand Tours. We have big ambitions for the next two years.”\n\nLucas Hamilton: “I am really happy to be re-signing for the next two years with Team BikeExchange-Jayco, I have been with this team since I was an under 23 rider and I would really like to try and keep progressing in the general classification realm at Grand Tours. It hasn’t always been smooth sailing but in the next couple years in this team, with its support, I am really excited to see what we can do together. I love the people in this team, and I am happy to be able to stay and continue working with them into the future.”\n\nCallum Scotson: “I’m very happy to stay, over the last four years the team has had a lot of belief in me and supported me to keep improving. Recently I’ve been happy with my ability to support the team in the big races, like at the Giro d’Italia earlier this year, so over the next two years I aim to continue that. If I can find some personal success along the way, then that would be really nice too.”\n\nLuke Durbridge\n\nDate of Birth: 9th April 1991 (31)\n\nNationality: Australian\n\nJoined GreenEDGE Cycling: 2012\n\nNew Contract: 2023 & 2024\n\nTop Results:\n\n4x 1st Australian time trial championships (2012, 13, 19, 20)\n\n1st Criterium du Dauphine stage (2012)\n\n2nd Driedaagse De Panne Overall (2014)\n\n2nd Giro d’Italia stage (2015)\n\n4th Dwaars Door Vlaanderen (2017)\n\n5th Eneco Tour Overall (2012)\n\n6th Benelux Tour (2021)\n\nLucas Hamilton\n\nDate of Birth: 12th February 1996 (26)\n\nNationality: Australian\n\nJoined GreenEDGE Cycling: 2017\n\nNew Contract: 2023 & 2024\n\nTop Results:\n\n1st Coppi e Bartali (2019)\n\n1st Tirreno Adriatico stage (2020)\n\n2nd Czech Cycling Tour Overall (2019)\n\n4th Paris-Nice Overall (2021)\n\n4th Giro d’Italia stage (2019)\n\nCallum Scotson\n\nDate of Birth: 10th August 1996 (26)\n\nNationality: Australian\n\nJoined GreenEDGE Cycling: 2019\n\nNew Contract: 2023 & 2024\n\nTop Results:\n\n3rd Hammer Stavanger stage (2019)\n\n6th Australian time trial championships (2019)\n\n7th Vuelta Asturias stage (2022)\n\n7th CRO Race stage (2020)\n\n8th Santos Tour Down Under stage (2017).\n\nBahrain Victorious Sign Andrea Pasqualon, Nikias Arndt and Dušan Rajovič\n\nBahrain Victorious are pleased to announce the signings of Andrea Pasqualon, Nikias Arndt, and Dušan Rajović from the 2023 season on multiple-year contracts.\n\nThe 24-year-old Dušan Rajović is debuting in the WorldTour. Despite his young age, he has already taken several victories as a professional rider, like two stages of the Tour of Qinghai Lake (in 2017 and 2018) and of the Vuelta Ciclista a Venezuela this season, plus a stage win at CRO Race (in 2019) and Tour of Antalya in 2022. The Serbian cyclist is a sprinter with excellent time-trial skills that brought him to become 3-time TT National Champion and 4-time Road National Champion, winning both titles in 2022.\n\nDušan Rajović is looking forward to competing with the best cyclists in the world: “I’m pleased and excited to be a part of the team next year. I’m looking forward to showing my best at the biggest races in cycling”.\n\nAlong with the promising young Serbian rider, Bahrain Victorious will add the experience with the Italian Andrea Pasqualon. The 34-year-old powerful sprinter has multiple victories in his Palmares: Circuit de Wallonie (2022), 2 stage wins and overall victory at the Tour of Luxembourg (2018), the GP Plumelec (2018) and Coppa Sabatini in 2017. This season, he also took dozens of podium results and top 20 placements in the Classics (Gent-Wevelgem, Dwars door Vlaanderen, Paris-Roubaix).\n\nAndrea Pasqualon comments on signing for Bahrain Victorious: “I am thrilled to be part of this team for the next two seasons, especially as we are talking about one of the best teams in the world. I will bring my experience of these 12 years of professionalism, especially to the young riders who will become part of this project, but also fundamental support to the great champions who have been part of Bahrain Victorious for years. I will certainly be an important man both in terms of sprint and for the Northern Classics. I’d like to thank General Manager Milan Erzen for giving me this chance, and I will try to repay the trust with some great successes”.\n\nThe other experienced sprinter joining the team in 2023 is Nikias Arndt. The 30-year-old German cyclist is not only a fast finisher but also a reliable road captain and helper in the bunch sprint. In his career, he took Grand Tours victories at the Giro d’Italia (2016) and the Vuelta a Espana (2019), stage race wins at Tour de Pologne and Critérium du Dauphiné, and the one-day race Cadel Evans Great Ocean Road Race. He was runner-up and 3rd several times in the Grand Tours stages, including the Tour de France.\n\nNikias Arndt on his move to Bahrain Victorious: “I’m looking forward to starting my journey with Bahrain Victorious in the next season. In my 10-year career as a pro cyclist, I gathered a lot of experience and can’t wait to use and further develop them with the team. I believe Bahrain Victorious will help me get the best out of myself. I’m also looking forward to working with my friend and soon teammate Phil Bauhaus as I think we can move a big step forward with the team.”\n\nMichał Kwiatkowski Extends Contract With INEOS Grenadiers to 2025\n\nMichał Kwiatkowski will be lining up at the Tour of Denmark today in the knowledge that he’ll be extending his contract with the INEOS Grenadiers until 2025.\n\nThe Pole has signed a new deal which at its conclusion, will mark a successful decade of racing with the team, which Deputy Team Principal, Rod Ellingworth reflects on:\n\n“Kwiato is a bike racer to the very core, and an integral part of this team, his ability to read a race is second to none, as is his dedication to being one of the best teammates you could ask for. That’s why it’s always an absolute joy to see him take victories of his own, as he did at the Amstel Gold Race this year. I’m very happy that he will remain with us until 2025.”\n\n‘Kwiato’ has been responsible for a number of firsts for the team over the years and continued that trend in 2022, clinching a memorable first victory at Amstel Gold for the Grenadiers.\n\nThat list also includes Milan-San Remo, Tirreno-Adriatico and two wins at Strade Bianche, in addition to taking a win on home soil at the Tour de Pologne, and a memorable Tour de France stage win in 2020.\n\nCurrently in his 12th year in the WorldTour, Kwiatkowski is as hungry as ever, whether that’s adding more victories to his glittering palmarès, or playing a key support role in stage races and Grand Tours.\n\nKwiatkowski said: “I’m really happy to be able to extend my contract with the team until 2025, to spend ten years with one team shows I’ve found a team I can call home. It’s an environment which encourages learning and development; a Team that really invests a lot into its riders. I’ve seen myself grow as a rider over the years, taking some memorable wins of my own along the way, as well as playing a part in some of the biggest wins in bike racing. I’m looking forward to more of this over the next three years.”\n\nMichał Kwiatkowski to stay with INEOS:\n\nElmar Reinders Steps Up to the WorldTour Strengthening Team BikeExchange-Jayco’s Sprint Train\n\nTeam BikeExchange-Jayco is pleased to confirm the signing of 30-year-old Elmar Reinders from August 23rd 2022, through to 2024. The fast man from the Netherlands has enjoyed no less than five race victories this season and will make the step up in the WorldTour peloton with the Australian outfit, as an important addition to the team’s sprint train and classics group.\n\nWith sprint star Dylan Groenewegen and young Australian signing Blake Quick, amongst some of the names of ‘fast men’ on the squad, GreenEDGE Cycling is hoping Reinders’ experience of racing in Holland and Belgium over the years will be of great value to the team’s sprint ambitions for the coming seasons.\n\nBrent Copeland – General Manager: “We have really taken a step forward with our sprint team this season and we want to continue to develop this over the next two years. Having an experienced rider like Reinders join our team will help us to continue to move in the right direction as we strengthen our sprinter’s group.\n\nIt is very exciting for us to be able to build a team around riders like Dylan and also with some new up and coming talents we have added to our roster. We believe Reinders will fit in very well with the team and as he will be joining the WorldTour for the first time, he still has a lot to learn and with that, a lot more potential to unleash.”\n\nElmar Reinders: “I am really looking forward to joining Team BikeExchange-Jayco and to try and make a difference in the sprint races and in the Classics. It is a big opportunity for me to step in to the WorldTour and I will do everything possible to make it a success and I would like to also thank Riwal Cycling Team for their support over the past years.\n\nI chose Team BikeExchange-Jayco because I felt that they had the most trust in me and I will give my best to pay back their trust. The team looks really strong this year and I hope we will keep growing together next season as well.”\n\nElmar Reinders\n\nDate of Birth: 14th March 1992 (30)\n\nNationality: Netherlands\n\nJoins GreenEDGE Cycling: August 2022, 2023 & 2024\n\nTop Results:\n\n2x 1st ZODC Zuidenveld Tour (2016, 2021)\n\n2x 1st Le Tour de Bretagne – Stage win (2021, 2022)\n\n1st Arno Wallard Memorial (2022)\n\n1st Circuit des Ardennes – Stage 1 (2022)\n\n1st Olymian’s Tour (2022)\n\n1st Visit Friesland Elfsteden (2022)\n\nRomain Combaud and Niklas Märkl Continue their Journey with Team DSM\n\nTeam DSM are happy to reveal the contract extensions of Romain Combaud and Niklas Märkl, with both riders set to wear the team’s colours until the end of the 2024 season.\n\nRomain Combaud (FRA)\n\nAfter spending all his career riding for French teams, Combaud made the jump and joined Team DSM ahead of the 2021 season. Settling in well and gelling with both riders and staff, his personable character has shone through. In the two years with the team so far Combaud has continued to progress as a rider; picking up some solid results at the start of the year. A true team player, Combaud is always more than willing to give his all for his teammates, working tirelessly in support of the team’s finisher with some strong riding. The 2022 season also marked his debut in a Grand Tour, with Combaud lining up in Budapest for the start of the Giro d’Italia.\n\nCombaud said: “I am so happy and I feel lucky to stay in a team in which I can grow and learn every day. I’m someone who likes when things are well organised, and I really enjoy the structure of the team. I have had beautiful moments with the guys so far such as my first Grand Tour and I am very glad to carry on with Team DSM for two more years. I will continue to do my best as a teammate, working for the team’s finishers and also share my experience with the younger guys on the team. I want to continue experiencing new races, enjoy training and team camps with the guys and the team.”\n\nTeam DSM head coach Rudi Kemna continued: “Romain is really a team player, and he has impressed us both on and off the bike since joining us last year. We think that his overall level has improved with the team and he’s someone that is capable of riding on all terrains, which we’ve seen with his strong support role at various races throughout the season. As he settles more and more into the team, he’s coming out of his shell and enjoys sharing his experience with the rest of the guys on the squad; developing into a road captainship role.”\n\nRomain Combaud:\n\nNiklas Märkl (GER)\n\nA fine product of the Team DSM’s talent days before joining the Development program, Märkl has been in the team’s structure since 2018 and turned professional with the Men’s program in 2021. Last season saw him make a smooth transition to the pro ranks, proving to be a valuable teammate in the early season classics and one day stage races. Towards the end of 2021 Märkl’s continued development shone through with a good tenth on GC at Tour de Slovaquie while also helping the team to a GC podium too, before a very impressive and attacking fifth place at Münsterland Giro. This year again has seen Märkl ride well to support the team in the one-day classics and helping the team’s sprint group to a win at the Tour of Türkiye and second overall at the recent Tour de Pologne.\n\nMärkl expressed: “At Team DSM we get all of the help we need and it’s a really professional environment. I’m looking forward to continuing to work with the team and the rest of the guys in the sprint group. There are some great guys coming through and in the team already, who are really motivated to bring it to another level, so I think it will be an exciting few years. I feel at home at Team DSM. Since I have been a part of the team in 2018 everything has gone smoothly, so I want to continue with that. Looking at myself, I want to grow as a rider even more and reach another level where I can help the team and be competitive in the finales of some of the biggest races on the calendar.”\n\nTeam DSM head coach Rudi Kemna added: “Niklas has been with the team since 2018 and we’ve known him for even longer than that with our talent days. He’s taken steps each season with us and has grown as a rider and a person. In the coming years we see him as a part of our sprint group, like he is now, where he can use his power and ability well. In his first two years with our Men’s program he’s rode strongly in a support role in the classics as well and this is an area of racing we also want to continue with. With our coaching team and specialists within the team, we think we can help him reach the next level.”\n\nNiklas Märkl:\n\nMezgec Signs On for Two More Years at Home with Team BikeExchange-Jayco\n\nSlovenian lead-out man Luka Mezgec has agreed to a new two-year contract with Team BikeExchange-Jayco, which will see the 34-year-old bring his time with the Australian outfit to nine years.\n\nThe rider from Kranj has proven himself, time and time again, as one of the most reliable lead-out riders in the WorldTour peloton, and as GreenEDGE Cycling looks to the future to continue developing the depth of its sprint group, Mezgec will continue to play a crucial role in this area, bringing his wealth of experience and skills.\n\nWith young up and coming sprint talents added to the roster for 2023, plus sprint team leader Dylan Groenewegen, the Australian squad is excited for what the future holds, with many more opportunities to challenge in sprint finishes across the calendar and is pleased to see Mezgec continue to be a part of this.\n\nBrent Copeland – General Manager: “Luka is one of the most reliable riders we have on the team, and we are very happy to see that he will continue with us for two more seasons and that he is very motivated and a big part of our future vision, as we develop our sprint team. With the knowledge and experience Luka has, from riding with our team for the past seven years and from his previous experience and success, he will continue to be a key and valued member and a rider that the younger generation can learn from, and be guided by.”\n\nLuka Mezgec “With Dylan joining our team this season, I found myself in a much clearer role. Helping one of the best sprinters in the world is both a joy and a big responsibility – which I love. Working with the full sprint train this season has been very different to previous years and also a big challenge for me as a rider who often makes plans for the sprints, because the plans are much more complex now than before. But I love this challenge, and that was one of the main reasons I wanted to stay here. Obviously after already seven years with the GreenEDGE family, it feels like home and it’s amazing to see all the positive energy and dedication of every single person working with the team.”\n\nLuka Mezgec\n\nDate of Birth: 27th June 1988 (34)\n\nNationality: Slovenia\n\nJoined GreenEDGE Cycling: 2016\n\nNew Contract: 2023 & 2024\n\nTop Results:\n\n1st Giro d’Italia Stage (2014)\n\n1st 3x Volta Catalunya Stage (2014)\n\n2x 1st Tour of Slovenia Stage (2017 & 19)\n\n2x 1st Tour of Poland Stage (2019)\n\n2x 2nd Tour de France Stage (2020)\n\n2nd Bretagne Classic Ouest-France\n\n4th Tour de France Stage (2021).\n\nLuka Mezgec with BikeExchange till 2024:\n\nJumbo-Visma Development Team Signs Mattio and Nortoft\n\nPietro Mattio and Morten Nortoft will be racing for the Jumbo-Visma Development Team from 1 January 2023. The two youngsters sign a two-year contract.\n\nThe Italian Mattio, born in 2004, is in his second year in the junior category and currently rides for Vigor Cycling Team. He already got to know his future team during several training moments. “I’ve been out with the team a few times. I enjoyed the great atmosphere and good organisation. I am happy to be part of the Jumbo-Visma Development Team for the next two years. I want to experience constant development and growth here. Along with gaining the necessary experience, I’m hoping for a bright future.”\n\nNortoft has already spent almost two seasons in the U23 peloton. The Dane currently rides for Riwal Cycling Team. At Jumbo-Visma Development Team, he hopes to take the next step in his development. “I am thrilled to make the switch and can’t wait to start. It is a good step in my career. I realised this after seeing how the riders and staff work as a team up close. I look forward to working with this team.”\n\nHead of Development Robbert de Groot and his team have followed the two riders for quite some time. “We are once again bringing in two talented people with Pietro and Morten. Over the past few months, Morten has made a good impression on us. We think he will be a great addition to our team because he is exciting, strong, and has a lot of potential. We have also known Pietro for some time now. After several internships and tests, we have seen that he also has great potential. We are pleased to be working with these guys.”\n\nArne Baers & Nathan Smith Join Tormans CX & the Continental Development Team\n\nBelgian rider Arne Baers (20 year old) and Briton Nathan Smith (18 year old) will defend the colours of Tormans Cyclo Cross Team and Intermarché-Wanty-Gobert Matériaux from September 2022. Both riders signed a contract until the end of February 2024 with the Belgian structure, enabling them to combine at least two winters in the mud with Tormans Cyclo Cross Team and a road programme with the new Continental Development team in the summer.\n\nNathan Smith won the bronze medal at the latest junior cyclocross World Championships in Fayetteville. He concluded his second season in the junior category in fifth place in the UCI ranking, thanks to his six victories on home soil and World Cup podiums in Dendermonde (2nd) and Tabor (3rd). This summer he won the bronze medal at the national Cross Country championships for a second year in a row.\n\nArne Baers from Paal-Beringen also showed himself in the junior category by taking victories on the Koppenberg, in Beringen, Niel, Wachtebeke and in Leudelange. When he stepped up to the U23 ranks at the end of 2020, he raced with the pros in each event. One season later he finished six times in the top twenty in elite races and was nearly always among the fifteen best riders in U23 events last winter.\n\nThanks to these two recruitments, Tormans Cyclo Cross Team will start season 2022-2023 with a group of six riders from five different nationalities. Quinten Hermans (Belgium), Kevin Kuhn (Swiss champion) and Corné van Kessel race in the elite category. Arne Baers (Belgium), Marie Schreiber (Luxembourg U23 champion) and Nathan Smith (Great-Britain) are U23 riders.\n\nNathan Smith: “After winning the bronze medal at the World Championships I was hoping to receive an opportunity to join a Belgian team. In my opinion it is the best environment to progress. I can’t wait to step up to the U23 category in the colours of Tormans Cyclo Cross Team. I expect it to be a big challenge, but the learning process motivates me a lot. Therefore, I want to stay as often as possible in Belgium to race and to train. I’m looking forward to discover all mythical circuits and to acquire as much experience as possible. For now, the technical circuits are the ones I like most as I grew up on the mountain bike. I started racing at young age, but cyclocross and especially road racing are quite new to me. For these reasons I can’t wait to work with the UCI cyclocross team and Continental Development team. This is the first step towards realising my dream of becoming a professional cyclist!”\n\nArne Baers: “I was lucky enough to receive the support of Bart and Geert Wellens during the past two years. I made a nice progression during my first season in the U23 category, thanks to the training sessions with the pros and under the supervision of Bart, which were great opportunities to push my limits. Last winter I went through a mentally difficult period after breaking my wrist at the season start and it was thanks to the advice of Geert Wellens that I got through it. Their unconditional support enabled me to find solutions in difficult times. This proves the belief the team has in its riders. I’m convinced that I’ll continue my progression within Tormans Cyclo Cross Team, in a professional but also family environment. Also my summer road programme with the Continental Development team will be an important factor in my development. But first, I can’t wait for the cyclocross season to begin, starting with our team training camp in Spain and my first races in Vorselaar and Beringen.”\n\nBart Wellens (Sports Director): “The expansion of our structure with a Continental Development team and a women’s team will enable our riders to work all year round in a professional environment, in different disciplines and choosing from a range of different levels. The teams work in a close collaboration, exchanging expertise, establishing long term race plans tailored for each rider individually and offering them the best possible trajectory to progress. Concerning the cyclocross branch, we will continue offering our support to young talents in order to prepare them for a potential step up to Tormans Cyclo Cross Team.”\n\n“This work with young talents has proven to be successful. I’m thinking of Zoe Bäckstedt, Marie Schreiber or Emiel Verstrynge. Offering a contract to Nathan Smith was a logical choice. His bronze medal at the World Championships was an extraordinary result taking into account the fact that he couldn’t race on his own bikes. He will take his first steps in the Belgian cyclocross world and in the U23 category in our colours and will race a full cyclocross winter for the first time. This adaptation will take time, but he might also surprise us. Nathan is technically strong already, However, I’m convinced that from our training camp at the end of the month onward we can improve cyclocross specific skills such as the combination running-riding.”\n\n“Our vision is to give all young riders time to develop without pressure. That’s why we offered both Nathan Smith and Arne Baers a contract for two seasons. Arne performed well in the youth categories, especially displaying his climbing capabilities. We will do everything we can to translate this in good results in both the U23 and elite categories during the next two winters. We believe in his potential and just like in the case of Joran Wyseure last season, we want to offer him the opportunity to show what he’s capable of. It would be fantastic if Arne could follow in his footsteps.”\n\nComposition Tormans Cyclo Cross Team:\n\nElite Men:\n\nQuinten Hermans (BEL)\n\nKevin Kuhn (SWI)\n\nCorné van Kessel (NET)\n\nU23 Men:\n\nArne Baers (BEL)\n\nNathan Smith (GBR)\n\nU23 Women:\n\nMarie Schreiber (LUX)\n\nQuick-Step Alpha Vinyl Adds Junior Squad Acrog-Tormans Balen BC to Team Structure\n\nQuick-Step Alpha Vinyl will add the junior team Acrog-Tormans Balen BC to its team structure next season. Apart from the Development Team, a junior team will also be part of Patrick Lefevere’s formation.\n\nDirectVelo reports that Acrog-Tormans Balen BC, the youth team of Jef Robert, has had several talents in the team in recent years, who later grew into the professional peloton. Remco Evenepoel of Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl, Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck) and Cian Uijtdebroeks (BORA-hansgrohe) rode for the team. This year the team won Kuurne-Kuurne with Sente Sentjens. Acrog-Tormans Balen BC made a deal with Wanty-Gobert in 2019 to act as a training team for the cyclo-cross section of the pro team.\n\nLast week Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl (Soudal-Quick-Step next season) announced that it will be launching a Development Team in 2023. The U23 team Team Elevate p/b Home Solution-Soenens will become part of the team structure and will be known as the Soudal – Quick-Step Devo Team from next season. Bart Roosens, current team manager at the U23 team, will continue to manage the project.\n\nKuurne-Kuurne win for Sente Sentjens:\n\nPascal Ackermann Finger Sutured after Crash in European Championship Road Race\n\nPascal Ackermann was among the favourites for the European championship road race on Sunday, but the German had to abandon after a collision with a barrier. A day later, he assessed the damage.\n\n“After an unexpected end to my race yesterday at the European Championships in Munich, I can only say that I was lucky… I got a few stitches in my finger,” the sprinter said on social media.\n\nAckermann is on the start list with his team UAE Team Emirates for the Vuelta a España, which starts on Friday in Utrecht.\n\nIt could have been worse:\n\nKasper Asgreen Update\n\nFollowing a period of consultation with the Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl medical team, it has been decided that the Dane will bring his season to a close.\n\nAfter an eventful first part of the season that saw him tackle a full classics campaign, Kasper was involved in a nasty crash at the Tour du Suisse, that put in doubt his participation in this year’s Tour de France.\n\nThe stresses of the crash and the subsequent attempts to get him ready for the Tour has unfortunately led to Kasper developing a fatigue syndrome, meaning that his body is no longer recovering from even low intensity efforts. It has therefore been decided that he will stop racing for the rest of this season and take a period of recuperation, before focusing on his preparations for 2023.\n\nEveryone at Quick-Step Alpha Vinyl wishes Kasper a restful recovery.\n\nOut for the rest of the year – Kasper Asgreen:\n\nZwift Academy Returns, Offering Workouts for Every Kind of Rider and Pro Contracts For Those With Exceptional Talent\n\nThis year’s program is shorter and more accessible, and all workouts can be completed entirely on each rider’s schedule with fewer mandatory group rides\n\nZwift, the global online fitness platform for cyclists, today announces the launch of the revamped Zwift Academy Road cycling program, designed to help every cyclist find their strength and go further in a four-week crash course designed to help Zwifters get faster, stronger, and smarter on the bike.\n\nRegistration for Zwift Academy opens on August 15 and the events begin on Sept. 12 and end on Oct. 9, 2022. While the academy is for all riders, it’s also a talent identification program and will award two professional cycling contracts, through the Pro Contender program, for athletes who demonstrate exceptional talent and fitness through the program.\n\nFirst launched in 2016, Zwift Academy has served as a model for digital talent identification and is the first such program to offer participants a chance to earn a spot on professional sports teams. Female participants in Zwift Academy have the chance to earn a contract with the UCI Women’s WorldTour Team CANYON//SRAM Racing, and male participants have the chance to earn a contract with UCI ProTeam Alpecin-Deceuninck.\n\nThis year’s Zwift Academy Road Cycling program is designed to help participants, whether or not they want to compete for a spot on a professional team, find their strengths as a cyclist, and learn to train both their strengths and limiters to become a more complete rider. Zwift Academy also teaches participants to train effectively. Those who complete the program will receive customised workouts and training recommendations, empowering them to keep improving on their own.\n\nTo make Zwift Academy more accessible, the program has been streamlined – only the baseline and finishline rides must be completed at scheduled times. The six structured workouts and Pro Contender workouts can be completed “on-demand,” so that riders can schedule their rides at times that are convenient for them. This year’s Academy includes:\n\n1 optional Orientation Ride, taking place prior to the program beginning – 1 Baseline Ride, completed on the Legends and Lava Route, used to determine a rider’s phenotype\n\n1 Finish Line Ride, completed on the Legends and Lava Route, available only during the last two weeks of the academy\n\n6 Structured Workouts, with both short and long workout options\n\n2 Additional Pro Contender workouts, for those interested in attempting to win a pro contract\n\nAlong the way, Zwifters will earn exclusive in-game unlocks: socks for completing 25% off Zwift Academy, a sweatband for getting halfway through, a Zwift Academy kit for 75%, and custom Canyon Aeroroad paint for completing the entire program.\n\nWhile Zwift Academy is a talent identification program for professional cycling teams, most riders will enter the academy to push themselves, improve their fitness, and learn about their own type of strength as an athlete. Those who do want the chance to ride on a pro team must complete the Baseline Ride and the two Pro Contender workouts by Sept. 25 in order to be considered for the Pro Contender Program.\n\nMore information on the Zwift Academy Road Cycling Program at: www.zwift.com/eu-es/academy/zaroad\n\nThe PEZ INSTAGRAM\n\nSee our Instagram page for a quick fix on your phone: https://www.instagram.com/pezcyclingnews\n\nThe PEZ NEWSWIRE!\n\nDon’t forget to check the “NEWSWIRE” section, you can find it on the homepage, just above the PEZ Shop section.
