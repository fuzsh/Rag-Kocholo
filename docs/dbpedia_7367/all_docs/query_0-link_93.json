        "text": "December 2000\n\nHappy Holidays\n\nThe annual Holiday Reception will take place from 3 to 5 p.m. Wednesday, Dec. 6, in Meridian Ballroom. The event will be hosted by Chancellor David Werner and the four vice chancellors.\n\nProfessor Also Finds Election Woes In Tanzania\n\nSince Nov. 7, pundits have become fond of noting that problems and ambiguities with the 2000 U.S. presidential election are nothing compared with other countries where bloodshed in the streets is common during a transfer of power.\n\nThe analogy has become a cliche, but the fact remains that it's true and Dallas Browne has witnessed it first hand. Browne, an associate professor of Anthropology, recently returned from Africa, where he was a monitor for the presidential election of Tanzania and Zanzibar on Oct. 29.\n\n\"Growth is affected in the countries of Africa where there is chronic violence,\" Browne said. \"It affects everyday life, for example, agriculture; planting and harvesting are disrupted which can contribute to widespread starvation.\n\n\"If a transfer of power occurred without fighting in the streets, this would stabilize a new regime, so that the people could enjoy peace and prosperity.\"\n\nBrowne was a member of a 16-person delegation sent by the International Foundation for Election Systems in Washington, D.C., to monitor the election. That group was joined by a delegation from the European Community, the British Commonwealth, the Organization of African Unity, and the Southern Africa Development Coordination Conference.\n\nAlthough the observers were to monitor the election, the overall goal was to stave off civil war in Tanzania. \"Two factions-the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM), currently in power, and the Civic United Front (CUF)-are at odds about the union government,\" Browne explained.\n\nCUF wants to secede from the union over the issue of a tax free port, importing goods from the island of Zanzibar without taxation so they can sell to the mainland (Tanzania) at a better price. The mainland government says it will lose money and the advantage over the island merchants.\n\nTo complicate this already volatile mix, oil recently was discovered on the island of Zanzibar in the Indian Ocean, and the island government has cut a deal with the British for exclusive drilling rights.\n\nAs for the danger factor for the monitors, Browne acknowledges there was personal risk but the delegation was in the forefront of media coverage and both sides were not interested in creating an international incident. \"We believe sincerely that if democracy takes root in these countries, the world would be better off,\" he said.\n\nThe citizens of Zanzibar are hungry for a stabilized election process, Browne said. Voters stood in line for hours to vote and many of them were elderly. \"The old people had to walked as much as 30 miles to vote, standing in line in a tropical sun.\n\n\"Ninety-two percent of the registered voters showed up at the polls,\" Browne said. \"Can you imagine what would happen if 92 percent of U.S. voters turned out on election day? It would be an amazing phenomenon. And, I was equally amazed at the young volunteers who helped older illiterate citizens in the voting. This all was very moving to me.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the election could not be certified by the observers because of fraud and improprieties at polling places in 16 constituencies (precincts), Browne said. The upshod was that the CCM retained power. However, civil war did not erupt and the observers believed their presence helped the situation.\n\n\"Both sides operated during the election with great restraint,\" Browne pointed out. \"The situation is still tense there and it will continue to be until the next election four years from now. But, I think the mission was successful.\"\n\nSlow Down On U. Drive At Bluff Road Intersection\n\nKeep an eye out for your speed when driving on South University Drive at the new intersection with Bluff Road. Things have changed and construction continues.\n\nThe speed limit will be reduced to 45 on Northbound University Drive south of the campus before the bike trail crosses the road. This is about 200 feet south of where the speed limit is presently reduced. Phase I of the Bluff Road project will be completed within the next week or so, weather permitting.\n\nOnce Phase I is completed, Bluff Road will be open from South University Drive to Korte Stadium. And, watch for different traffic patterns at the new Bluff Road and South University Drive intersection. Bluff Road traffic may now be crossing the southbound lanes to enter the northbound lanes. Traffic going north may be slowing to turn left onto Bluff Road.\n\nThese are new traffic patterns so extra care should be taken. Bluff Road will remain closed to through traffic until next fall. Depending on weather, the contractor may begin phase II and III soon This will close access to Whiteside Road. Bluff Road will be closed from the stadium to Poag Road.\n\nDilliard Letter Collection Given To Lovejoy Library\n\nIt might be difficult to imagine Irving Dilliard asking advice of anyone. The retired 96-year-old St. Louis Post-Dispatch editor seems a sage on so many subjects.\n\nBut, when he was a high school student in the 1920s he was considering a career as a writer and he asked several people for advice, not the least of which were more than 100 famous authors.\n\nThe young Dilliard received 120 letters of reply with advice as varied as the authors themselves-Robert Frost, Rudyard Kipling, Bernard Shaw, and F. Scott Fitzgerald, to name a few. They answered the young man's questions, ranging from \"Should I attend a university?\" to \"Should I study liberal arts or journalism?\" and \"How did you start your career?\"\n\nThe collection of these letters, written on stationary or postcards, recently was given to Lovejoy Library by Dilliard's daughters, Doris Sprong and Mary Sue Schusky. Dilliard has been a long-time member of the Friends of Lovejoy Library and a supporter of SIUE.\n\nJay Starratt, dean of Library and Information Services, said the historic letters are a welcome addition to Lovejoy Library's collections. \"This is a truly charming and fascinating collection,\" Starratt said. \"The letters represent a 'who's who' of the Anglo-American literary world in the 1920s. We are very grateful to the Dilliard family for their generous gift.\"\n\nThe dean is correct. This is a charming and fascinating collection, if only in the fact that some of the greatest literary lights of all time deigned to reply to a high school student's query from Collinsville, Illinois.\n\nPerhaps they knew the youngster was destined for greatness himself. As a high school student, Dilliard began work at what was then known as the Collinsville Herald. After he graduated from the University of Illinois in 1927 and attended Harvard for one year, he took a job as a Post-Dispatch correspondent. He worked briefly as a reporter before transferring to the newspaper's editorial staff, serving as editor of the editorial page from 1949-1957.\n\nDuring his 30 years at the Post, Dilliard wrote or edited more than 10,000 editorials. He also wrote articles for The American Scholar, Harper's, and The New Republic. He contributed more than 100 biographical essays to the Dictionary of American Biography and edited collections of addresses and papers of Judge Learned Hand and legal opinions of Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black.\n\nAfter Dilliard retired from the Post in 1960, he taught expository writing at Princeton from 1963-1973, while holding a Ferris Professorship. He also served as the first director of Aging for the state of Illinois. In recent years, Dilliard has devoted time to a variety of projects and organizations, including historical organizations, local preservation societies, and libraries.\n\nGiven the curiosity Dilliard has exhibited throughout his distinguished career, it's really not difficult to imagine him as a young man confronting writers he admired.\n\nFrost wrote: \"I suppose I just kept writing what I wanted to write and occasionally trying to publish it; but was at it over twenty years before I published much of it.\" The poet went on to write that he \"got little out of college and less out of literary courses in college.\"\n\nWrote Kipling: \"Some men thrive on newspaper work, and others are poisoned by it, and the fact is one has to make the experiment for oneself.\"\n\nFitzgerald, who wrote one of the longest letters in the collection, recommended Booth Tarkington for the \"best prose.\"\n\nShaw sent a postcard with a terse and characteristically curmudgeonly recommendation: \"Write 5,000 words a week for five years; then you will be professionalized enough to take any literary shit that may come your way.\"\n\nIDNR Project Teaches Students, Helps Residents\n\nWhen coal was king, hundreds of mines were dug beneath what is now the Metro East area. Long forgotten, these abandoned mines pose a serious threat to homeowners as hundreds of Southern Illinois residents find out each year-and in an expensive manner.\n\n\"Mine subsidence is a very real danger in this area,\" says Robert Gibson, emergency section supervisor of the Illinois Department of Natural Resources' (IDNR) office on campus. \"Approximately one million acres of land in Illinois, most of them here in the southern part of the state, are undermined, and the subsidence of these abandoned mines have resulted in some costly consequences for homeowners.\"\n\nThe Abandoned Mined Lands Reclamation Division of IDNR's Office of Mines and Minerals has undertaken two projects with SIUE. One involves monitoring coal mine subsidence. For the past eight years, students from the School of Engineering have been hired in a series of on-going contracts with the IDNR to measure the ground movements associated with coal mine subsidence and to monitor the resulting damages to homes, schools and buildings.\n\n\"These students have had valuable hands-on experience in learning to design effective monitoring programs and in implementing level surveying techniques,\" said Gibson.\n\nBut students are also involved in a new project launched by IDNR. Estimating that in Belleville alone 70 percent of the city's residents live over mined areas-and the danger exists in other communities, including Edwardsville, Glen Carbon, and Collinsville-Gibson is using the Metro East for a pilot program working with Randall Pearson of the SIUE Department of Geography.\n\nThis pilot project includes digitally archiving maps of abandoned mines throughout the state and attaching useful coordinate information. Utilizing students from Geography to assist in research and implementation, Pearson and Gibson are using Geographical Information System (GIS) to assign coordinates for these abandoned mines that will eventually be overlayed on city maps in order to identify potential hazards.\n\nGIS is a software program that combines satellite and demographic technology to help planners make myriad decisions about varied regional issues.\n\n\"Involving the SIUE engineering and geography students in mine subsidence research and the GIS mine mapping project is a continuation of a working relationship the Department of Natural Resources has had with the university,\" Gibson points out. \"We've utilized students in research and surveying projects in the past and are counting on their participation as an important element of developing a comprehensive plan to minimize the effects of past coal mining.\"\n\nGibson introduced the project to interested students in a presentation in November, discussing the issues related to mine subsidence-the history of mining in the area, the impact of subsidence on existing structures, and the role of the Department of Natural Resource's emergency response team.\n\nThe first objective of the GIS undertaking is to archive the many existing maps of mines. With the earliest mines in Illinois dating from the middle of the 19th century, researching and indexing the maps will result in an invaluable foundation for a computerized system for cataloging mines and identifying possible dangers. \"Analyzing and recording this information will result in a system that is more accurate and, by default, useable by everyone,\" Gibson said.\n\nUltimately, he hopes GIS will be available on the Internet for area residents to access in determining if mine subsidence is a concern for their property. In the meantime, Gibson advises residents to consider adding mine subsidence coverage to their house insurance policies. \"It's an inexpensive premium, particularly if you compare it to the thousands of dollars of damage that can result from a subsidence under your home,\" he said.\n\n\"Too many residents are unaware of this danger. That's why the Geographical Information System is so important, not only to alert people but, whenever possible, to prevent costly problems before they happen.\"\n\nWomen's Basketball Looks To Get Back On Track\n\nDespite the fact that last weekend didn't turn out the way the women's basketball team expected, Coach Wendy Hedberg said there is no need to panic. \"We didn't play our game against IUPU-Fort Wayne,\" said Hedberg.\n\n\"They got in our face and we didn't adapt to the pressure. We just need to go back and work harder on some things in practice.\"\n\nThe Cougars, 3-1 overall and 1-1 in the Great Lakes Valley Conference, return to action tomorrow evening (12/5) at McKendree College. The game gets under way at 7 p.m.\n\nMcKendree will also be an opportunity for bragging rights. Misi Clark (Paris) will be playing against her younger sister, Jacque, who is a freshman guard for the Bearcats. Jessica Robert (Carlyle) also has the opportunity to play a former teammate from Carlyle High School in junior Kristin Hustedde. \"It is a big game for Misi and Jess. McKendree got off to a real good start but played some tough teams lately.\"\n\nThe Cougars then travel to Evansville, Ind., on Saturday (12/9) to take on Southern Indiana at 5:15 p.m. \"Southern Indiana is playing really well right now. They are a much better and improved team than last year and have a balanced attack.\"\n\nClark scored 19 points against both Saint Joseph's and IUPU-Fort Wayne last weekend, extending her streak to 71 consecutive games of scoring in double figures. She also recorded three steals on Saturday to move her into the No. 2 spot on the all-time steal list with 263. Clark leads the team with 17.2 points per game.\n\nKristen Boss (Carrollton) and Megan Grizzle (Salem) also had career games in the 84-37 win over Saint Joseph's. Boss finished with a career-high 10 points and nine rebounds while Grizzle added a career best 12 points. Robert finished with career highs in the 76-72 loss to IUPU-Fort Wayne. Robert finished with 18 points and five assists. She is second on the team in points per game with 11.8.\n\nMen's Basketball Hopes Win Gives Team A Spark\n\nOne win at the right time. \"The win against IUPU-Fort Wayne was a tremendous one for us at the right time of the season,\" said Coach Jack Margenthaler. The 77-72 win over IUPU-Fort Wayne on Saturday (12/2) evened the Cougars' Great Lakes Valley Conference record to 1-1 for the year and to 2-3 overall.\n\n\"We didn't play extremely well, but we got the win. It will help us to prepare for our next opponent.\"\n\nSIUE next travels to Evansville, Ind., to face No. 3 Southern Indiana in a 7:30 p.m. match up on Saturday (12/9). \"Southern Indiana is playing really well. It is one of our conference games and we have to face a team that is ranked,\" said Margenthaler.\n\nWes Pickering (Springfield, Mo.) and Luke Humphrey (Rantoul) had career games last week. Pickering led the team in the Saint Joseph's loss with a career-high 21 points and five steals. He now is second on the team with 11.6 points and 6.2 rebounds per game. Humphrey set a career best 12 points against Saint Joseph's only to break that in the win over IUPU-Fort Wayne. He recorded 19 points on Saturday and is currently averaging 8.6 points per game.\n\n\"On Saturday, Luke had the best game of his college career,\" said Margenthaler. \"I am pleased for him because he was struggling offensively, but he has come out of it.\"\n\nWrestling Faces Three Difficult Dual Meets\n\nCoach Booker Benford and his wrestling squad return to dual action this weekend against three tough teams.\n\nFirst up for the Cougars is a dual against Central Missouri State on Wednesday (12/6) in Warrensburg, Mo. The meet begins at 7 p.m. SIUE then travel to Purdue and Illinois for dual meets this weekend. The Cougars face Purdue on Saturday (12/9) at noon and Illinois at 1 p.m. on Sunday (12/10).\n\n\"These are two tough teams,\" Benford said. \"It will be a learning experience for the guys.\" The team fell to Missouri 46-0 last week in its first dual meet of the year and enter the week with a 0-1 record. \"The team lacked intensity last week and even at the Northern Iowa Open. They are facing very tough opponents.\"\n\nDecember 19, 2000\n\nSnowstorm Caused Vehicle Problems On Campus\n\nThe snowstorm last week caused a few vehicles to spin out of control and traffic personnel on campus to maintain a hectic pace, and it all caused some headaches for administrators.\n\nIt was exam week and the university was forced to close at noon on Wednesday because of dangerous weather conditions. Any exams scheduled that afternoon were rescheduled for Friday. The inclement weather schedule was posted on the university's main Web site.\n\nUniversity Police were busy helping stalled motorists with dead batteries or vehicles immobilized by deep snow. \"We de-iced about 30 cars, in which motorists couldn't get into the cars because they were iced shut,\" said University Police Lt. Tony Bennett. \"Our officers also were helping jump vehicle batteries.\n\n\"In all, we had 65 such incidents reported,\" Bennett said. \"Thankfully, these were one-vehicle mishaps and no one was hurt.\"\n\nBut, despite the problems, the snow-covered trees and shrubs on campus framed an idyllic scene as some families, oblivious to the somewhat chaotic conditions around them, sledded the hills on campus in a winter wonderland.\n\nMeanwhile......KMOV-TV and KMOX Radio in St. Louis were contributing to the confusion for some students and employees of the university, with incorrect snow-closing announcements. The problems were caused by a combination of computer breakdown and human error, according to station personnel. Spokesmen at both stations said they had identified the glitches and were addressing the problems for the future.\n\nA secondary fallout to the electronic announcement problems appeared in at least one local newspaper which also incorrectly reported SIUE would be closed Thursday. The reason for that glitch? Reporters relied on St. Louis electronic media reports.\n\nNAACP Leader To Speak As Part Of Arts & Issues Series\n\nFive Points to Freedom is the focus of the Jan. 18 visit of Kweisi Mfume, leader of the NAACP and a former Congressman, as part of the 16th Arts & Issues season.\n\nFollowing a proven format, the Arts & Issues tradition continues to emphasize quality in programming that Southwestern Illinois audiences have come to expect from the SIUE series. Mfume's presentation takes place at 7:30 p.m. in Meridian Ballroom of the Delyte W. Morris University Center.\n\nMfume's five-point \"action agenda\" encompasses civil rights, political empowerment, excellence in education, economic development, and youth outreach. Chief executive officer of the NAACP since February 1996, Mfume gave up his seat in the House of Representatives to take the position. For 10 years, he served Maryland's 7th Congressional District.\n\n\"We are proud to have Kweisi Mfume as part of the Arts & Issues family,\" says Richard Walker, coordinator of the series. \"His work in Congress and with the NAACP has been exemplary, and his presentation here will outline the issues about which he has become so passionate. Mfume has given the NAACP a clear and compelling blueprint for the 21st century.\"\n\nA native of Baltimore, Mfume became an activist in college and followed a political career that led to a seat on the Baltimore City Council, where he worked to diversify government, improve community safety, enhance minority business development, and divest city funds from the apartheid government of South Africa. In 1986, he was elected to Congress.\n\nAs a member of the House, Mfume consistently advocated landmark minority business and civil rights legislation. He successfully co-sponsored and helped pass the Americans With Disabilities Act and also authorized minority contracting and employment amendments to the Financial Institutions Reform and Recovery Act.\n\nHe also served two terms as chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and later served as the Caucus' chair of the Task Force To Preserve Affirmative Action.\n\nTickets for the Jan. 18 event are $8; students, $4. For tickets, call (618) 650-5555, or, from St. Louis toll-free, (888) 328-5168, Ext. 5555; write: Arts & Issues, SIUE, Edwardsville, IL 62026-1083; or by e-mail, rwalker@siue.edu.\n\nTickets also may be ordered on-line: www.siue.edu/ARTS_ISSUES.

He earned a doctorate in Education and Psychology in 1963 from the University of Michigan.\n\nFrom 1957-58, Brinkmann taught at Ann Arbor (MI) High School and was a research associate and a lecturer at the University of Michigan before coming to SIUE in 1963 as a faculty member in what was then called the Education Division.. He retired in 1991.\n\nMemorials may be made to Lutheran Children and Family Services or to Trinity Lutheran Church in Edwardsville.\n\nNovember 2000\n\nAIDS Quilt On Display Nov. 17 At ESTL Center\n\nThe South African AIDS Memorial Quilt will be on display Friday, Nov. 17, for area high school and college students during the day and for the general public that evening at the East St. Louis Center, 411 E. Broadway.\n\nThe East St. Louis Center for the Performing Arts is playing host to this part of the quilt's tour. The quilt is appearing in only 12 American cities.\n\nThe display, in the seventh-floor studio of the center, will be open from noon to 3 pm., with presentations beginning at noon, 1, and 2 p.m., featuring a guided walk through the quilt display, a 15-minute presentation, and a question-and-answer period. That evening, from 6 to 8, the general public may view the display. A reception will follow the presentation.\n\nThe memorial quilt was created to promote awareness \"about the devastation caused by AIDS in South Africa and to galvanize the American public to action in confronting the crisis.\"\n\nThe tour is being conducted on the heels of the XIII International Conference on AIDS in Durban. By building public interest, organizers say, the tour hopes to humanize the AIDS pandemic in Africa, educate people about the disease, and raise funds to fight AIDS and assist people living with the disease in Africa. Supporters say donations received during the tour will go directly to support grassroots AIDS Services Organizations in South Africa.\n\nHoliday Musicales\n\nThe Department of Music is offering the 13th Annual Holiday Musicales house tour from 2 to 5 p.m. Sunday, Dec. 10.

For more information or to obtain tickets, call Martee Lucas in the Department of Music, (618) 650-3799. Tickets also are available from Friends of Music members.\n\nMen's Basketball Begins GLVC Season At Home\n\nCoach Jack Margenthaler looks for his men's basketball team to start the conference season with two wins this weekend. \"These are two games we are capable of winning if we play with the ability we have,\" the head coach said.\n\nThe Cougars return home to face Saint Joseph's on Thursday (11/30) at 7:45 p.m. in the Vadalabene Center. \"Saint Joseph's is a much better athletic team this year. They come in with a 3-1 record and are a much improved team over the past year.\"\n\nSIUE plays IUPU-Fort Wayne on Saturday (12/2) at 3:15 p.m. \"IUPU-Ft. Wayne is always a team that plays solid fundamentals. We need to execute well on offense since they are a strong defensive team.\"\n\nThe Cougars fell to 1-2 on the season with losses to Northwood and Wayne State last week. \"There were times we played well in each game. We had an opportunity to see a lot of different things. It was ideal for two non-conference basketball games with the exception we did not win.\"\n\nTim Rose (DuQuoin) led the team last weekend with 20 and 25 points, respectively. Mustafa Cetin (Edmonton, Canada) also finished in double figures both games, scoring 17 and 16 points, respectively.\n\nWomen's Basketball Keys Defense To Good Start\n\nCoach Wendy Hedberg said strong defense is key for her women's basketball team to start the conference season on a winning note. The Cougars, 2-0, open up the Great Lakes Valley Conference season at home against Saint Joseph's, 0-4, on Thursday (11/30) at 5:30 p.m.\n\n\"Saint Joseph's is a very young team. I am a little concerned with the matchups because they play more of a perimeter game. However, we should be able to dominate the inside game.\"\n\nSIUE faces IUPU-Fort Wayne on Saturday afternoon (12/2) at 1 p.m. in the Vadalabene Center. IPFW brings in a record of 3-0. The Cougars defeated Goldstar last Tuesday (11/21) 101-74 in the final exhibition of the season. Megan Grizzle (Salem) led the team with 19 points while Misi Clark (Paris) added 13 points. Jill Johnson (Highland) led the team with eight rebounds while scoring 11 points.\n\nWrestling Set For Missouri\n\nCoach Booker Benford and his wrestling squad prepare for the first dual meet of the season on Tuesday (11/28). The Cougars travel to Columbia, Mo., to take on the Missouri Tigers at 7 p.m.\n\nSIUE struggled last weekend at the Oklahoma Open. Zach Stephens (St. Charles, Mo.) and Richard Ness (Belleville) each finished with a 2-2 record. \"The team is not mentally tough,\" said Benford. \"They are letting people ride them and turn them and are not effective in getting out of those situations.\"\n\nThe team travels to Cedar Falls, Iowa, to participate in the Northern Iowa Open on Saturday (12/2).\n\nSoftball Signs Three To Early National Letters Of Intent\n\nThree high school seniors have signed early national letters of intent to play softball at SIUE in 2002. Head Coach Sandy Montgomery, who led the Cougars to a 39-19 record and appearance in the NCAA Regional tournament in 2000, expects all three to make immediate contributions.\n\n\"These three players will do much to improve our team next season,\" Montgomery said. Amanda Farmer, of Columbia, plays both outfield and infield. Montgomery said Farmer is a versatile player with good speed and a strong arm. \"Amanda is a steady, sound player and can play almost anywhere on the field,\" Montgomery said. \"She batted better than .350, had a .975 fielding percentage and can steal bases.\" Farmer also ranks near the top of her class academically at Columbia High School. Farmer will join her sister, Dawn, who is a junior pitcher for the Cougars.\n\nCassie Witherell is a utility player from Abingdon. She has been first team All-Conference and team Most Valuable Player all three years at Abingdon High School. She also was named All-State by the Illinois High School Coaches Association in 1999. \"In my opinion, she is the best utility player in the state,\" Montgomery said of Witherell, who has attracted attention from some NCAA Division I programs. \"She can catch very well, play third base very well and play shortstop very well. She has even pitched and bats better than .400 consistently.\"\n\nVeronica Schmidt is a shortstop from Westmont. She is a power hitter who batted .487 last season with a slugging percentage of .730 at Westmont High School. She was named All-Conference and All-Area in 1999 and 2000 and attracted attention from NCAA-I programs and other schools in the Great Lakes Valley Conference. She figures to fill the void that will be left by the graduation of current shortstop Mandy Uhrhan.\n\nSIUE Volleyball's Rust Named Second Team All-GLVC\n\nLindsay Rust, a senior from Belleville, has been named second team All-Great Lakes Valley Conference by a vote of the league's 12 volleyball coaches.\n\nRust led the GLVC in digs per game this season with 4.05 per game. She also finished 19th in hitting percentage at 2.49, seventh in kills per game at 3.94, and 20th in service aces per game at 0.33. A three-year starter at SIUE, Rust was named All-GLVC for three consecutive seasons.\n\nShe completed her collegiate career with 1,435 kills, 1,299 digs, 127 service aces and a .231 hitting percentage. She is ranked No. 2 all-time at SIUE in both kills and digs.\n\nRust and Michelle Gilman (1995-1998) are the only two players at SIUE ever to have recorded more than 1,000 kills and 1,000 digs.\n\nThree Men's Soccer Players Earn All-GLVC Honors\n\nThree men's soccer players have been named All-Great Lakes Valley Conference by a vote of the league's 12 coaches. Brandon Gibbs (St. Charles, Mo.) was named to the first team. Eric Modeer (Hershey, Pa.) and Cress Maddox (Springfield) were named to the second team.\n\nGibbs, a senior forward, led SIUE in scoring with six goals and seven assists. His goal scoring was mostly on a timely basis with five game-winning goals, including three in overtime. He also recorded a team-best 53 shots. Modeer, a senior midfielder, picked up three goals and six assists in his final season as a Cougar. He had 25 shots while playing in all 20 games this season. Maddox, a junior back, earned his second All-GLVC distinction. The hard-nosed defender scored two goals in 17 games played.\n\nCoach Ed Huneke's team completed the 2000 season with an 11-7-2 record and an 8-0-3 record in GLVC play.\n\nFive Women's Soccer Players Earn All-GLVC Honors\n\nFive women's soccer players were named All-Great Lakes Valley Conference by a vote of the league's 12 coaches. Colleen Creamer (St. Louis) and Sara Decker (St. Louis) were named to the first team as a forward and midfielder, respectively. Backs Rebecca Mays (Springfield), Tasha Siegel (Collinsville) and goalkeeper Beth Louderman (Girard) were named to second team. Decker also was tabbed as the GLVC's Freshman of the Year.\n\nCreamer, a sophomore, scored a team-leading 10 goals and five assists for the Cougars. After just two seasons, she is now tied for eighth with Kelly Drury (1990) on the all-time scoring list with 23 goals and 14 assists. Decker caught the eye of opponent coaches with her sharp passing and timely scoring. She led SIUE in points with 27 after scoring nine goals and picking up nine assists. Mays, a senior, and Siegel, a junior, both became three-time All-GLVC selections. As a back, Mays was delegated the responsibility of marking an opponents' best offensive player. Siegel, a sweeper, was the team leader on defense and scored three goals this season to increase her career total to 12 goals and two assists. Louderman played a key role in the team's low goals against average. She recorded 103 saves and had a 0.84 goals against average in 1,812 minutes played.\n\nCoach Brian Korbesmeyer's team completed the 2000 season with a 13-4-3 record and an 8-0-3 record in GLVC play.\n\nRare Clarinet, Harpsichord Part Of Tollefsen Collection\n\nA 125-year-old clarinet, with its \"revolutionary\" 13-key system, and an 18th century harpsichord played by Marie Antoinette are in The University Museum's warehouse, near a lute that was given to Catherine the Great of Russia.\n\nThe items are part of the Tollefsen Collection owned by Lovejoy Library. Carl H. and Augusta S. Tollefsen were influential musicians in New York City during the first part of the 20th century.\n\nNot only did the couple love to play instruments, but they collected quite a few \"famous\" instruments. Eventually, the collection was purchased by Lovejoy in 1969. The Museum has custody of the instruments for storage under safe conditions.\n\nSays Therese Zoske Dickman, music librarian at Lovejoy: \"The collection is distinguished for its more than 5,000 photographs, prints, composer and musican autographs, first editions, Edison cylinder rolls, manuscripts, and scores, as well as the instrument collection, which contains both European and Asian pieces,\" she said.\n\nThe 13-key clarinet in the collection uses a system developed in the early 1800s in Vienna and Paris by Iwan Müller. The system became the standard for most clarinets until the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nClarinetist James \"Mac\" Hinson, associate professor of music at SIUE, says the system was a monumental change for clarinetists who had a tendency to play off-key because their fingers couldn't accurately cover the sound holes. Müller added keys which made the sound much easier on the ears.\n\nMüller's model was very popular with the composers of the Romantic period,\" Hinson said. \"It was a bigger sound, an emotional sound, favored by Brahms, Wagner, and Bruckner. And, the sound of the 'new' style of clarinet was much more in tune with the other instruments.\"\n\nEric Barnett, director of The University Museum, said the instruments are kept in a temperature-controlled warehouse with several thousand other artifacts. \"I would like to see these instruments carefully refurbished and put back in playing condition,\" Barnett said. \"Instruments should be played.\"\n\nHinson echoes that sentiment. \"Instruments only come alive when they are played,\" he said. \"Otherwise, they're not much more than pieces of furniture.\"\n\n'Digital Divide' Program Helping Bridge Techno-Gap\n\nEarlier this year, the School of Education received a five-year grant to fund a program that has come to be known as \"Bridging the Digital Divide,\" which has various components operating in the East St. Louis area.\n\nThat \"divide\" is a technology gap becoming wider and wider in low-income areas throughout the country, where students are lacking the basic computer and internet skills to compete in a computer-literate society.\n\nSchool of Education Associate Dean Don Baden says the program is making inroads. \"An average of 60 percent of the students in this country have access to the internet,\" Baden said. \"In the East St. Louis area, it's two percent. There are eight centers operating in East St. Louis, Washington Park, and Fairmont City that offer after school programs. Part of this grant is being used there.\n\nAmong the components of the grant is one that will provide donated computers to children and their families once they have completed some service work and some basic computer skills training,\" Baden said. \"We're also putting together an on-line mentoring program for those students who have access to the internet.\n\n\"Our first request for donations in August resulted in about 30 computers-some from individuals and some university property which was being sent to surplus. A recent 'refurbishing effort' resulted in providing 25 more computers.\"\n\nBaden is asking faculty and staff again to search their offices for computers that are useable but not being used. For more information, call Baden, Ext. 3644, or by e-mail: dbaden@siue.edu.\n\n\"If its private property,\" he said, \"we will be glad to provide an IRS contribution letter. If its university property, the equipment can be transferred to our program.\"\n\nProfessor Emerita To Be Given Honorary Degree\n\nRuth Slenczynska, an emerita professor of music and an artist-in-residence at SIUE, will be awarded an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts at the Dec. 16 commencement ceremonies. The resolution to grant the degree was passed recently by the SIU Board of Trustees.\n\nProfessor Slenczynska, a renowned pianist who has performed more than 3,000 recitals and concerts in many countries around the world and who has appeared with most of the world's great orchestras, retired from the SIUE music faculty in 1988 after 24 years of service. She has continued to teach part-time at the university and continues performing in concert.\n\nA native of Sacramento, Calif., Slenczynska gave her first public recital when she was four. Two years later, she made her European debut in Berlin and at seven played for the first time in Paris. At 16, she entered the University of California at Berkeley and worked for \"pocket money\" as a record librarian in the Music Department. She earned a degree in Psychology.\n\nShe then served as professor of Music at the College of Our Lady of Mercy in Burlingame, Calif., eventually leaving to tour with such organizations as the Boston Pops and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. Slenczynska was awarded the Golden Cross of Merit from Poland, the country of her ancestry, and was the first western artist to perform with the China State Symphony Orchestra.\n\nHer story has been featured on many television programs, including This Is Your Life, The Today Show, and 20/20, as well as in newspapers and magazines such as the Chicago Tribune, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Reader's Digest, McCall's, and Life magazine (she was featured on the cover of the first-ever edition in 1936).\n\nThe many accomplishments of the 75-year-old pianist include: playing a duet with then-President Harry Truman at the White House, performing for President John Kennedy's inaugural, and recognition from President Ronald Reagan as the first American woman to celebrate 50 years on the concert stage. She included among her friends some of the greatest musicians of the century, such as Artur Rubinstein and Vladimir Horowitz.\n\nSeveral years ago, National Public Radio featured the SIUE artist-in-residence in a video called Living Treasure, and in 1989, the St. Louis PBS affiliate (KETC-TV Ch. 9) devoted a half-hour of its St. Louis Skyline series to her performance at the piano. That segment was repeated twice by viewer request.\n\nIn addition to a lifetime of concert touring, her commercial recordings include 10 albums for the Decca Gold Label Series, three for the Musical Heritage Society, and five CDs, the most recent of which, an all-Schumann program for Ivory Classics, was released last year.\n\nOctober 2000\n\nBirger Hall Dedicated Oct. 4; Open House Oct. 6\n\nInvited guests took part in a ceremony dedicating B. Barnard Birger Hall, the new home of SIUE's Office of Development and Public Affairs, on Oct. 4. The university community attended an open house two days later.\n\nThe SIUE Foundation and Alumni Association are housed in the 12,000-square-foot facility, located on the outside of the campus' Circle Drive near the Vadalabene Center. \"This is a much anticipated moment for the Foundation, alumni, and the university,\" said G. Patrick Williams, vice chancellor for Development and Public Affairs and chief executive officer of the SIUE Foundation.\n\n\"Through the generosity of Mr. Birger, we have not only established an on-campus presence for the Foundation and Alumni Association, we have increased the two organizations' visibility and roles as integral parts of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.\"\n\nBirger, who died earlier this year, was a long-time member of the SIU Board of Trustees and a long-time supporter of the university. He also was chairman of BBB Companies, Inc., a conglomerate of auto dealerships, a real estate firm, and a construction company. In addition, he was a lifetime honorary member of the SIUE Foundation Board. Birger's bequest of his Collinsville home and property, valued at $1.3 million, enabled the university to construct Birger Hall in his honor. It was the second-largest, one-time gift to the Foundation in its history. Birger later established a challenge grant with an additional $200,000 donation.\n\nGround was broken for the building in May 1999. Korte Construction Co.; Peckham, Guyton, Albers, Viets Inc., an architectural firm; Keller Construction Inc.; and Oates Associates Inc. contributed in-kind services for the construction of the facility. Korte Construction served as the general contractor.\n\nJames Walker, newly named SIU president, attended the Oct. 4 dedication along with members of the Foundation and Alumni Association boards. Students, faculty, staff and the community took part in a public dedication of Birger Hall on Friday, Oct. 6.\n\nIn addition to office space, Birger Hall features a conference room for staff and meetings of the Alumni and Foundation board of directors, a paneled executive lounge, a service kitchen, and a special-event room for meetings and banquets. The special-event room has been envisioned as an ideal location for alumni groups to hold social activities as well as being available for rent to the public.\n\nThe building replaces the former Foundation offices located in the Tosovsky Center, a remodeled home on Highway 157. It had been donated by the Tosovsky family.\n\nIndividual support continues to be sought for the completion of a second-floor conference center with video conferencing capabilities in Birger Hall. Additional offices and an outdoor patio connected to the special-event room overlooking the campus' scenic Cougar Lake are planned as well.\n\nSeveral naming opportunities for Birger Hall's various rooms and facilities have been identified; information is available by contacting the SIUE Foundation, (618) 650-2345.\n\nSIUE Campus Formally Annexed By Edwardsville\n\nThe Edwardsville City Council formally voted Oct. 3 to annex the remaining portion of the SIUE campus not already included within city boundaries.\n\nIn 1995 the city annexed the portions of campus that included Cougar Village, Woodland Hall, a strip of property along Poag Road, University Park, and Korte Stadium. This latest annexation ensures SIUE will continue to receive fire and ambulance service from the city at no cost, while the city will realize some sales tax revenue and will be able to include resident SIUE students in census counts.\n\nDuring a brief ceremony at city hall, SIUE Chancellor David Werner said the city and the university can work together to put Edwardsville on the national map, similar to the way college towns such as Columbia, Mo., Chapel Hill, N.C., and Austin, Texas, have become well known.\n\nEdwardsville Mayor Gary Niebur said, \"Certainly SIUE is one of the good things about our community that deserves our recognition, attention and support. We have been partners in many ventures over the years, and we have built a strong working relationship that has benefited all involved.\"\n\nShout\n\nIt made 'em wanna' shout when Otis Day and the Knights (above) performed at Korte Stadium for Cougarfest 2000 on Saturday night. The group and it's signature tune, Shout, was a hit after National Lampoon's Animal House became a cult film. Below, Justin McMillian, of Granite City, was given the Jack Blake Award during the Cougarfest festivities on Sunday. Behind Justin are SIUE Men's Soccer Coach Ed Huneke, and Jim Kersting, both former teammates of Blake's, and members of the Blake family. Also in attendance were members of the Tim Tighe family, who created the annual award. Tighe also was a teammate of Blake, who died of cancer in 1997. Blake was a former All-American and a member of the Olympic soccer team; he was a Cougar from 1968-1970.

Now's your chance to talk back.\n\nDebateWatch 2000 comes to SIUE this year with the three presidential debates-Oct. 3, 11, and 17-offered on a big-screen TV in the Morris University Center and a chance to mull the issues afterwards during roundtable discussions.\n\nAccording to David Valley, professor of Speech Communication and chair of that department, information gathered-from students, staff, faculty, and the general public-at that roundtable will be sent to the national DebateWatch clearing house and compared with perceptions from similar sessions around the country. And, all that will then be disseminated to the press around the country.\n\nRefreshments will be served at 7:30 p.m. and each debate begins at 8. The three sessions are being co-sponsored by the SIUE College of Arts and Science and the Departments of Speech Communication and Political Science.\n\nWork\n\nStephen Schwartz's musical Working, based on the book by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Studs Terkel, one of Chicago's favorite sons, will be performed at 7:30 p.m. Friday-Saturday, Oct. 6-7 and 13-14, and at 2 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 8 and 15, all in the Katherine Dunham Hall theater. Terkel's work records the voices of America; men and women from various walks of life tell of their likes and dislikes, fears, problems, and happiness on the job.

OK, OK, maybe a little but it's just Midnight Madness and it's coming soon.\n\nMidnight Madness marks the official start of the 2000-2001 Cougar Basketball season on Saturday, Oct. 14, in the Vadalabene Center.\n\nThe disco band, Sable, jumpstarts the festivities beginning at 10 p.m. The first 500 students with valid ID will receive a \"Red Zone\" T-shirt. Throughout the night, students also will have four opportunities to win $10,000 and take part in other fun activities. SIUE faculty, staff and the community also are invited to take part in free activities.\n\nThe 2000-2001 Cougar players and coaches will be there to talk with fans; at the stroke of midnight, both the Men's and Women's basketball teams will be introduced to the fans followed by a 30-minute practice.\n\nMad? Come out and see ... you be the judge.\n\nJazzed\n\nMarion Miller (above) and Johnny Johnson (below) were winners of this year's Music and Jazz Music Achievement Awards, respectively, at the 12th Annual Jazz Supper Dance. The musicians each have storied careers, both on the St. Louis music scene and across the country. The SIUE Friends of Music, WSIE-FM (88.7), and the SIUE Department of Music presented the affair recently in Meridian Ballroom. The sellout crowd listened and danced to the music of the SIUE Concert Jazz Band conducted by Reggie Thomas, an associate professor of music. The evening also featured special performances by Johnson and Miller. Proceeds benefited the Friends of Music scholarship fund.

Walker will lead a delegation of faculty, researchers and key Illinois officials on an exploratory educational mission to the Republic of Cuba in November.\n\nWhile in Cuba, the delegation will participate in a series of discussions and presentations with Cuban university professors and researchers, farmers, teachers, health care workers and government officials to build mutually beneficial relationships.\n\nAmong those joining Walker on the mission are: Hazel Loucks, deputy governor for Education and Workforce Development; Paul Simon, former U.S. senator who now directs the SIU Public Policy Institute; Edgar Lopez, Illinois state representative; Lucy Sloan, member of the Illinois Board of Higher Education; Lourdes Monteagudo, executive director of the Teacher's Academy of Math and Science and a member of the Illinois Board of Higher Education; and Keith Sanders, executive director of the Illinois Board of Higher Education.\n\nSIU officials sais the mission will build strong relationships with Cuban educators, researchers and government officials that will \"pay dividends for SIU in the form of cooperative research and other partnerships.\"\n\nThe delegation also includes faculty and staff from the Edwardsville and the Carbondale campuses, including the School of Medicine, who are experts in topics of mutual interest to Cuba, such as community health care, agriculture, biotechnology, public policy and education. Plans are also being made to include a student from SIUC as a member of the delegation.\n\nEdwardsville campus officials are equally optimistic about potential benefits of the mission. \"SIUE's School of Business has developed a strong international studies program, most recently working together with the Department of Foreign Languages and Literature to begin the China Track,\" SIUE Chancellor David Werner said.\n\n\"We may yet be some years away from a Cuba Track but this trip could be the beginning of faculty and program partnerships with Cuban counterparts.\" Werner added that the mission also holds potential benefits for Illinois businesses. Delegation members will visit Havana as well as other cities and rural areas of Cuba.\n\nThe SIU mission follows Gov. George Ryan's historic humanitarian trip to Cuba last fall and a visit to SIU one year ago by Fernando Remirez, chief of the Cuban Interests Section in Washington, D.C. During his visit, Remirez invited SIU officials to Cuba to participate in a people-to-people exchange with Cuban officials. The purpose of the mission is four part:\n\n• To develop linkages with Cuba's educational system and explore the potential for SIU to offer programs and sponsor student and faculty exchanges;\n\n• To establish connections between Cuba's community health system and the SIU School of Medicine and other health care related programs;\n\n• To explore the potential for SIU to sponsor a symposium on Caribbean affairs;\n\n• To explore cooperative research opportunities, specifically in the key areas of agriculture, aquaculture and biotechnology.\n\n\"This mission is truly an exciting opportunity that I believe will lead to a number of interesting possibilities for SIUC researchers,\" said SIUC Interim Chancellor John S. Jackson. \"We have qualified faculty in areas of interest to the Cuban officials, specifically soybean research, sugar cane production, medicine and aquaculture. I look forward to good results from this mission.\"\n\nCarducci Shatters Record\n\nCarrie Carducci (Powell, Ohio) set the goal of breaking SIUE's freshman record for 5,000 meters at cross country. On Saturday (10/7), she shattered it.\n\nCarducci ran the Forest Park cross country course at the Washington University Invitational in a time of 17 minutes, 59.8 seconds. That topped the best time by a Cougar freshman previously set last season by Amanda Bozue (18:32.7). Her sub-18 minute time also was the second fastest 5,000 meters in school history.\n\nOnly Karin Beach-Pond (17:49) at the 1995 Missouri-Rolla Open has run faster. \"All she had to do was get into the competition and run with the leaders,\" said Coach Darryl Frerker. \"And she did that.\" Carducci ran the same 5,000-meter course on Sept. 8 and came within two seconds of Bozue's record. Frerker said Carducci planned on breaking the record at the course her next time around.\n\nCarducci finished 14th in her record-breaking performance at the Washington University Invitational. As a team, SIUE placed 14th of 32 teams. Frerker hopes his freshman can help guide the women's cross country team to a strong finish at the team's next meet-the GLVC Championships. The event is set for Oct. 21 at 10:30 a.m. in Evansville, Ind.\n\nOlszowka Sets Pace For SIUE Men's Cross Country\n\nDespite running the 14th fastest time in school history, Jason Olszowka (Lockport) probably could have run better, according to Coach Darryl Frerker. Frerker pointed to the sophomore's 1998 performance of Olszowka's where he ran 20 seconds better than Saturday's time of 25:48.2.\n\nBoth performances were at the Washington University Invitational. The Cougars placed 16th as a team out of 30 teams behind Olszowka. Frerker is hoping to see his other runners improve enough to challenge for a top 10 position at the GLVC Championships on Oct. 21.\n\nFrerker said he thought freshman Tyler Krauss (Freeburg) and junior Robert Old (Hendersonville, Ky.) can finish the season strong enough to help the Cougars at the GLVC meet. The GLVC men's race begins at 11 a.m. in Evansville, Ind.\n\nWomen's Soccer Remains Undefeated in GLVC Play\n\nThey're still undefeated in the Great Lakes Valley Conference. The Cougars managed to remain undefeated last weekend by downing Indianapolis 3-1 and tying No.4-ranked Northern Kentucky 1-1.\n\nThe tie broke SIUE's string of eight consecutive wins, but the Cougars have not suffered defeat since Sept. 10 when they lost in overtime to regional rival Truman State. SIUE, No. 6 in the region, takes its 11-3-1 overall and 7-0-1 mark in conference to Missouri-St. Louis on Saturday (1014) at 7:30 p.m.\n\nColleen Creamer (St. Louis) scored her team-leading seventh goal against Indianapolis. Sara Decker (St. Louis) also scored a goal last weekend and tallied two assists. Decker leads the team with eight assists and 20 points. Emily Anderson (Florissant, Mo.) recorded the only goal for the Cougars in their tie with Northern Kentucky. On defense, Rebecca Mays (Springfield) shut down the one of the top scoring leaders in the GLVC in Northern Kentucky's Betsy Moore.\n\nMen's Soccer Picks Up Key Road Victories\n\nNot only were the two wins important, but they came in dramatic fashion, said Coach Ed Huneke. \"They were important because it reinforces our position in the standings by winning two tough games on the road. And the drama in which the two goals were scored, strengthens our team's confidence.\"\n\nSIUE, who enter the week tied for fifth in the region, looks to improve on its 8-4-1 record overall and 6-2 mark in the Great Lakes Valley Conference after defeating both Indianapolis and Northern Kentucky 2-1 on the road last weekend. The team in now tied for first in the conference.\n\nThe Cougars cross the river this weekend for a match up against Missouri-St. Louis on Saturday (10/14) at 5 p.m. \"It is still a tight race and every game continues to carry significance,\" Huneke said.. \"We are resolved to approach each game accordingly.\"\n\nBrandon Gibbs (St. Charles, Mo.) scored the game-winning goals in both wins last weekend while also recording an assist. Gibbs is second in the GLVC in assists with six and is tied with Justin Huneke (Glen Carbon) for a team-leading five goals. Yuzuru Takami (Japan) added his fourth goal of the season against Indianapolis. Kevin Corrigan (St. Louis) tied the game against Northern Kentucky with his third goal.\n\nVolleyball Cougars Note Marked Improvement\n\nCoach Joe Fisher saw improvement in his team's play last weekend, and the results are proof. \"We played much better in both matches,\" he said. \"Friday night we played with desire and heart but lost to a better team, but we came back on Saturday and played with the same intensity and won.\"\n\nThe team got back on track last weekend. Despite falling to IUPU-Ft. Wayne, the Cougars battled back to defeat Saint Joseph's 3-1. SIUE, 8-12 overall and 4-5 in the Great Lakes Valley Conference, plays Southern Indiana on Wednesday (10/11) at 7 p.m. in the Vadalabene Center. The Cougars then have the weekend off before getting back into action the following weekend.\n\nIt was the supporting cast that stepped up this weekend and pleased Fisher. Andrea Voss (Breese) is second in the conference in blocks averaging 1.16 per game. Voss recorded 23 kills over the weekend. She leads the team with 25 solo blocks and 66 total blocks for the season. Kelly Schaill (Princeton) recorded 17 kills and nine total blocks on the weekend. \"Kelly and Andrea had outstanding weekends,\" Fisher said.\n\nThe coach said Meghan Daugherty (Canton) and Melissa Schaeffer (Ballwin, Mo.) also had solid outings against Saint Joseph's. Daugherty tallied six service aces, two short of the school record for aces in a match. Schaeffer finished with 10 kills and seven digs. \"Missy took advantage of getting some playing time. I was very happy with her performance.\"\n\nLindsay Rust (Belleville) continues to lead the team in kills per game (3.70), kills (281) and digs (295). Rust tallied 22 kills last weekend. She is eighth in the conference in kills and first in digs with an average of 3.88 per game.\n\nLouderman Grew Up Playing Several Sports; She Chose One To Play At SIUE\n\nFive sports. How do you choose? Especially when the one you end up playing wasn't even an option to your gender as a child.\n\nWell, in Beth Louderman's case, she just tried something new ... and then competed with the guys.\n\nNow, a senior goalkeeper for the SIUE Women's Soccer team, Louderman said her hometown of Girard didn't have competitive girls' sports when she was younger. \"So, I played soccer with the guy's team until we eventually got a girl's team.\"\n\nA tri-captain in 2000, Louderman earned GLVC Player of the Week for her performance during the week of Sept. 18. She helped the team to improve to 8-3 overall and 4-0 in conference play by recording 12 saves and two shutouts. Louderman had not allowed a goal in last 465 minutes and 17 minutes of play until Saint Joseph's scored in the second half last Friday night (Sept. 29). The Cougars are currently 10-3 and undefeated in the conference at 6-0. Louderman currently is second in the GLVC with a 0.74 goals against average mark.\n\nLouderman tried numerous sports growing up. She competed in volleyball, basketball and track in high school and played club soccer and softball. \"The high school didn't have a soccer team so I played club soccer on an all-girls team every Sunday and on the guy's team every now and then.\"\n\nHowever, it wasn't soccer that brought her to SIUE. Louderman came here in 1997 on a track scholarship and competed in the high jump and discus. She had qualified for the state high school championships in discus as a prep her junior and senior, finishing fourth in 1997.\n\nEven though she enjoyed track, something was missing. She had played soccer for most of her life and wanted to continue. So she approached Women's Soccer Head Coach Brian Korbesmeyer when she arrived on campus. \"I liked track because it was an individual sport where the only person who could bring you down was yourself,\" said Louderman. \"But I also wanted to play soccer so I tried out.\"\n\nKorbesmeyer said she came in a little unsure but wanted to give it a try anyway. \"Beth is a good athlete,\" he said. \"She likes the soccer atmosphere. She ended up earning a soccer scholarship and has turned into an excellent goalkeeper.\"\n\nThe 5-foot-9-inch Louderman said the transition wasn't as difficult as she first thought. Since she had played softball and volleyball, it wasn't hard for her to adjust to the hand-eye coordination needed in soccer. Louderman received limited time at goalkeeper in her first two seasons, but her patience at backup paid off because her opportunity came last year as a junior. She started all 19 games for the 13-6 Cougar soccer team. Louderman recorded 56 saves and six shutouts. She ranked fourth in the Great Lakes Valley Conference among goalkeepers with a 0.92 goals against average.\n\n\"She gets better every practice,\" Korbesmeyer said. \"Her athleticism keeps her moving up to the next level.\"\n\nLouderman, who is majoring in business administration, said her family has been very supportive. \"My dad has a lot to do with what I am doing,\" she said. \"He has never been pushy. He lets me make my own decisions. Even though he thinks I would do better at track, he let me make my own decision.\"\n\nIt wasn't only her track scholarship that brought her to SIUE. Her older brother also attends the university. \"I liked the fact that SIUE is small. I like the small classrooms because I know the teacher and students in my classes personally.\"\n\nSeven Straight Wins For Women's Soccer\n\nSeven wins in a row. Six wins in the Great Lakes Valley Conference. SIUE has shut out its opponents five of the last seven games and remains undefeated in the conference.\n\nThe Cougars, 10-3 overall and 6-0 in the GLVC (as of 10/2), try to extend the streak on the road this weekend. SIUE, No. 7 in the region, travels to Indianapolis for a 3 p.m. match on Friday (10/6) and then heads to Northern Kentucky to face the Norse at 3 p.m. on Sunday (10/8).\n\nNorthern Kentucky is ranked No. 1 in the region with a 10-1 record overall and is second in the conference with a 5-0 mark. Last week, the Cougars defeated Saint Joseph's 2-1 and IUPU-Ft. Wayne 1-0.\n\nBeth Louderman (Girard) allowed her first goal in 465 minutes, 17 seconds of play in the second half to Saint Joseph's. Louderman has 57 saves on the season and 0.74 goals against average, which is second in the conference. Colleen Creamer (St. Louis) scored a goal and recorded one assist against Saint Joseph's. Creamer leads the team with six goals. Sara Decker (St. Louis) also recorded a goal this weekend and now leads the team with six assists and 16 points.\n\nThe only goal scored against IUPU-Ft. Wayne came from Tasha Siegel (Collinsville) off an assist from Megan Steward (Glenarm). Siegel has three goals on the season while Steward recorded her second assist.\n\nContrast Does Not Equal Consistency For Men's Soccer\n\nThere was a contrast in our team last weekend,\" said Coach Ed Huneke. One performance was good, the next time out wasn't.\n\n\"Last Friday, we came out with a good attitude and an aggressive approach to the game and played well. But then on Sunday, we were a little flat against a good team like IUPU-Ft. Wayne. And that is what beat us.\"\n\nSIUE looks to improve on its 6-4-1 record overall and 4-2 mark in the Great Lakes Valley Conference after splitting last weekend's games against Saint Joseph's and IUPU-Ft. Wayne. The Cougars take to the road this weekend to face Indianapolis on Friday (10/6) at 1 p.m. and Northern Kentucky at 12:30 p.m. on Sunday (10/8).\n\nYuzuru Takami (Japan) and Eric Modeer (Hershey, Pa.) recorded the only two goals of the weekend for the Cougars in the 2-0 win over Saint Joseph's. Takami also recorded an assist and now has three goals and two assists on the year. Modeer's goal was his second this season. \"In addition to scoring, Takami and Modeer both played extremely well for us on Friday night,\" Huneke said.\n\nBrandon Gibbs (St. Charles, Mo.) continues to lead the team with five assists and 11 points on the year while Justin Huneke (Glen Carbon) has a team-leading five goals. Gibbs' assist total is tied for second in the GLVC.\n\nCougar Volleyball Learning The Difficult Way\n\nCoach Joe Fisher and his volleyball team are looking for something to learn from its mistakes. \"I am trying to take something from each match and learn from it,\" the second-year coach said. \"And, sometimes it is the hardest thing when you take something from a loss and learn from it.\"\n\nSIUE, 7-11 overall and 3-4 in the Great Lakes Valley Conference, looks to end its four match losing streak against IUPU-Ft. Wayne and Saint Joseph's this weekend. The team travels to IUPU-Ft. Wayne for a 7 p.m. match on Friday (10/6) and then heads to Saint Joseph's for a 2 p.m. match on Saturday (10/7). \"IUPU-Ft. Wayne is a tough place to play,\" Fisher said. \"Saint Joseph's has a new coach and a young team. I look for them to be a challenge. It will be a fight. Hopefully, we will be up to the challenge this weekend.\"\n\nFisher said turning it around is just a matter of finding the consistency. \"We need to continue to learn, grow and fix things such as consistency and the up and down of emotions.\"\n\nAndrea Voss (Breese) leads the conference in blocks averaging 1.29 per game. Voss recorded her second double figure in total blocks (10) in the loss against Quincy. Over the three matches last week, Voss tallied 20 total blocks (nine solo blocks) and 27 kills. Her .416 hitting percentage against Quincy was the fifth highest SIUE percentage of the season for players with 10 or more kills in a game.\n\nNot only was Fisher pleased with the performance of Voss but said Stosha DeShasier (Carrollton) also had a good week. DeShasier recorded 27 kills and 10 block assists in the last three matches. Lindsay Rust (Belleville) continues to lead the team in kills per game (3.70), kills (259), service aces (23) and digs (277). She is tied for ninth in the conference in kills and first in digs with an average of 3.96 per game.\n\nWomen's Tennis Prepares For GLVC Tournament\n\nPreparation. That is the way Coach Bill Logan is looking at this week of competition. The Cougars finish up regular season Great Lakes Valley Conference play at home on Tuesday (10/3) against Quincy before heading to the ITA Midwest Regionals this weekend in Indianapolis.\n\n\"Quincy gives up the chance to finish the regular season with a win,\" Logan said. \"The regionals will be tough competition and get us ready for the conference tournament the following weekend.\"\n\nOnly the top four singles players-Kim Mulherin (Belleville), Amber Stanley (Effingham), Laura Zeeb (Greenville) and Coryn Reich (Newton) - are attending the regionals this weekend. Mulherin has a 4-2 record at the No. 1 position while Stanley is 5-2 at No. 2. Zeeb and Reich enter the week with a 4-2 and 5-1, respectively.\n\nThe Cougars, who will be the No. 3 seed behind Northern Kentucky and Southern Indiana at the Great Lakes Valley Conference Tournament, stand at 6-2 overall and in GLVC play after losing 6-3 to Southern Indiana and then defeating Kentucky Wesleyan 5-0 last weekend.\n\nSIUE is the host school for the GLVC Women's Tennis Championships on Oct. 13-14. The tournament site will be split up between the Simpson Complex in Alton and the tennis courts at Lewis and Clark Community College.\n\nKatie Farrell Sets Another Women's Golf Record\n\nNew records once again. With such a young team and a young program, record-setting is becoming a regular occurrence. SIUE Women's Golf is in its third year and is stacked with eight freshmen.\n\nFreshman Katie Farrell (Princeton) broke the school record she set two weeks ago shooting an 80 this past weekend in the second round of the Indianapolis Invitational. Farrell also tied another school record she set a couple of weeks ago by finishing with a 167 in 36 holes. Farrell finished tied for ninth overall at the Indianapolis Invitational. \"She came back well the second day,\" said Coach Larry Bennett. \"Once she gets it going, she plays well. I am very happy with her performance.\"\n\nThe team finished seven strokes behind the defending GLVC champion Indianapolis last weekend. \"It is a great improvement very quickly,\" Bennett said. \"We finished tied with Bellarmine for the first time ever and beat Southern Indiana and Northern Kentucky.\"\n\nFreshman Kacy Gruenkemeyer (Salem) shot a 177 (87-90) to finish 24th while sophomore transfer Nonie Ehlke (Highland) shot a 179 (87-92) and tied for 31st. Junior Spring Riley (Salem) tied for 35th with a 180 (89-91) and freshman Kristi Novak (Highland) tied for 44th with a 188 (92-96).\n\nThe Cougars now prepare for the Great Lakes Valley Conference Championships on Oct. 9 and 10 in Columbus, Ind., at the Timber Gate Golf Course. \"It is going to be a dogfight next week,\" Bennett said. \"It will be much more exciting than in previous years. It is really anybody's tournament.\"\n\nCross Country Looks For Personal Bests\n\nCoach Darryl Frerker looks for personal records to be the goal for this weekend meet in St. Louis, Mo. \"For as young as we are, I think a personal record from everyone of them would be a success, especially since we ran that course earlier this season.\"\n\nThe Cougars compete in the Washington University Invitational on Saturday morning (10/7). The Women's 5,000-meter run begins at 10 a.m. followed by the Men's 8,000-meter run at 10:35 a.m. Last weekend, the women's team finished first. Jill Irlam (Virden) and Stephanie Mullen (Girard) looked strong last weekend, said Frerker. \"Irlam was looking for a big personal record last weekend and did just that.\"\n\nIrlam finished with a time of 21 minutes, 24 seconds, while Mullen recorded a time of 21:08. Carrie Carducci (Powell, Ohio) was the top runner in for the Cougars. Carducci placed third with a time of 19:31. The men finished in third place behind Robert Old (Hendersonville, Tenn.). \"Robbie came in first for us and had a breakthrough race along with Darren Dinkelman (Nashville),\" Frerker said. Old finished the race with a time of 28:01 while Dinkelman came in fourth for SIUE at a time of 28:40. \"Almost everyone had a personal record on our course last weekend which was good to see coming off an intense week of practice.\"\n\nJean Paterson elected president of GCSA.\n\nThe director of SIUE's Career Development Center has been elected president of the Gateway Career Services Association. The association is made up of career services professionals from 45 colleges and universities in Illinois and Missouri.

We're confident he is going to have a major impact in helping the program provide effective services for SIUE students with disabilities.\"\n\nBoyle evaluates students for potential learning disabilities, interpreting previous and new testing results. He also provides academic advisement to students with disabilities and is a liaison to faculty and staff for the student in making special accommodations in the classroom or in curriculum.\n\n\"I have wanted to work with students on the college level,\" Boyle said. \"Coming to SIUE will be a great experience as I really like the atmosphere on this campus, the people of the university community I've met, and the commitment SIUE has to providing a quality education to all students, regardless of their circumstances.\"\n\nBoyle will be developing and implementing new tests for detecting possible learning disabilities in students such as reading deficits, mental processes in writing and mathematics, attention deficit and other potential hindrances to learning. He hopes to have the tests ready for implementation by the end of the Fall Semester.\n\nBoyle has worked closely with people with disabilities since 1986. He graduated from Illinois College in Jacksonville before coming to SIUE to receive a master's in Clinical Adult Psychology. He worked for 12 years at Beverly Farms, a residential facility for people with developmental problems. He joins an active department that is responsible for the implementation and coordination of many programs, activities, and services for persons with disabilities.\n\nSIUE offers a full range of resources to support students with disabilities in an effort to eliminate any barriers to learning and help individuals reach their educational goals. Academic advising and registration, guidance and counseling, referrals to related offices and departments, and assistance in obtaining specialized equipment or supplies, support services, and special accommodations are provided by DSS.\n\n\"Whether it is extending priority registration to a student with a mobility impairment, working with instructors to provide extended time on exams for students with learning disabilities or visual impairments, or coordinating volunteer notetakers for a student with a disability, Disability Support Services is here to see that all students enjoy the full benefit of their educational experiences at SIUE,\" Floyd-Hendey said.\n\nFor additional information on the SIUE Disability Support Services office, call 618/650-3782.\n\nSuccess\n\nDress for Success of Southern Illinois, in partnership with SIUE's East St. Louis Center, has provided suits and accessories for 500 women since it began in July 1999. Through the program, a woman seeking a job can receive a complete business outfit-a suit, shoes, handbag, accessories, and hosiery-to be worn at job interviews. In addition, a client may be coached for the interview, given hair styling and make-up assistance, and also may be provided a mentor. If an interview is successful, the client may also return for another complete outfit. One measure of the program's effectiveness is that 70 percent of the women come back for that second suit. Dress for Success, 614 North Seventh St., East St. Louis (in the basement of the Neighborhood Law Office), is operated by Barbara (at left) and Sandy Parker (center) who believe the program is more than \"just come in and look pretty.\" They point out that the program helps women set long-term professional and personal goals. Here, client Melonie Polk, of Belleville, picks out an outfit for her upcoming job interview. Says Polk: \"I wore casual clothes at my last job, so I don't have anything dressy for work,\" she said. \"This makes me feel like a million bucks.\" Clothes drop-off points are located at any of the St. Clair County Head Start program locations, the SIU School of Dental Medicine in Alton, or at Rendleman Hall on the Edwardsville campus. For more information, call (618) 274-1770.(SIUE Photo)\n\nStudents Receive Funds Faster Due To Improvements\n\nThis year, SIUE students received financial aid faster than ever before because of advanced technology and improvements in procedures in the Office of Student Financial Aid, says Director Marian Smithson.\n\nSmithson credits her staff for streamlining office procedures which contributed to the higher numbers of students served. \"It was a very busy year for our office,\" Smithson said, \"and my staff worked very hard to meet our goals.\"\n\nThe office also took advantage of a new internet confirmation option to pay grants for the Illinois Student Assistance Commission's Monetary Award Program (MAP). \"In the past, award payment was delayed because we were mailed MAP confirmations, but now we can access those confirmations via the internet,\" Smithson said.\n\nIn addition, procedures for the Direct Loans program also were streamlined to save time. \"Students sign a master note for their first loan and aren't required to sign for each new loan,\" Smithson said, \"and that has helped us deliver funds faster.\"\n\nBy the second week of Fall Semester, more than 5,300 students had received financial aid totaling $13.9 million, an increase of more than 10 percent in the student count at the same time last year and a 25 percent increase in dollar amount over the same time last year. \"The university had an increase in enrollment and we were able to stay on time with our payouts,\" Smithson said.\n\n\"This means students are able to begin classes without taking out short-term loans and they're also able to get their textbooks on time. Receiving their checks in a timely manner relieves much of the stress of beginning a school term,\" she said.\n\n\"Our goal is to provide good service to students and support the university's enrollment growth.\"\n\nOctober 17, 2000\n\nInaugural Midnight Madness Event Introduced The Basketball Cougars\n\nMore than 500 spectators and fans took part in the inaugural Midnight Madness event in the Vadalabene Center this past Saturday as the Basketball Cougars took a bow amidst an evening of fun and games. Even the Chancellor got into the act.\n\nSIUE Chancellor David Werner took turns in the dunking booth while students took delight in sending him to the water below. Meanwhile, others entered several basketball competitions, playing for thousands of dollars in prize money and scholarships.\n\nNo one won the $10,000 grand prize, according to Assistant Athletics Director Nick Adams, but Matthew Pierson, a freshman from Shelbyville, walked away with a semester's worth of tuition. And, Pierson won under duress ... he was wearing only sandals on his feet.\n\n\"It was kind of hard to move around because of the sandals, plus I hadn't really shot hoops in awhile,\" Pierson said.\n\nHe was a starter on his high school basketball team through sophomore year. Nevertheless. he had a great time. \"I made a three-pointer from the top of the key to win it,\" Pierson said. \"I was thrilled to win it. I had a great time all night, especially the free pizza.\"\n\nSharing \"Shay\" Conrad, a freshman from Fairview Heights, won second place in the competition but was disappointed because the tuition would have come in handy. \"I missed the first shot and then he made his shot and I missed the three-pointer,\"she said. \"I was really confident because I needed that tuition, but it just wasn't meant to be, I guess.\"\n\nConrad won a $100 gift certificate to the SIUE Bookstore as runner-up.\n\nAt midnight, the two Cougar Basektball teams hit the court for a light workout and a few scrimmages. Men's Coach Jack Margenthaler and Women's Coach Wendy Hedberg started their first official practice at midnight by combining their workout. Students and fans who attended were treated not only to the practice but also were given T-shirts and refreshments.Adams said he was pleased with the turnout. \"I think it went amazingly well for an inaugural event,\" he said.\n\nAlcohol Awareness Week Runs Through Oct. 21\n\nVelcro madness ran through the crowd Oct. 13 as Alcohol Awareness Week at SIUE kicked off with the 13th Annual Tons of Fun, a late night social event, from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. at the Vadalabene Center.\n\nIn addition to a velcro wall, activities included a bungee run, a giant obstacle course, karaoke, a DJ/Dance, a Float-A-Note booth, scuba lessons, pumpkin decorating, a life-sized Sega, a haunted maze, and a gladiator event.

The Edwardsville City Council formally voted Oct. 3 to annex the remaining portion of the SIUE campus not already included within city boundaries. In 1995 the city annexed the portions of campus that included Cougar Village, Woodland Hall, a strip of property along Poag Road, University Park, and Korte Stadium. The city banners have been hanging from street light poles in downtown Edwardsville, interspersed with the SIUE banners. With the recent exchange between Niebur and Werner, the city's banners will soon be displayed on light poles on University Drive, alternating with SIUE's banners.

Coach Ed Huneke and his men's soccer team showed their character is strong enough to turn in a win following a tough loss. \"The Quincy loss was one of the most heart-wrenching losses,\" said Huneke of his team's 2-1 overtime game this past Friday (10/20).\n\n\"We played extremely well but had trouble finishing. The tough part was losing on a 40-yard shot with one second left in overtime.\"\n\nFollowing the loss to Quincy, Huneke said he was concerned with his team's mentality going into the Southern Indiana game. But the Cougars showed him there was no need for concern when they defeated Southern Indiana 2-1 in overtime last Sunday (10/22). \"They showed a lot of character by bouncing back and playing well again.\"\n\nSIUE, 10-6-1 overall, finished the conference regular season with an 8-3 record and a third place regular season finish in the Great Lakes Valley Conference. The Cougars face Southern Indiana in a home contest in the quarterfinals of the GLVC Tournament on Nov. 1. If SIUE wins, it advances to the semifinals in Romeoville.\n\nThe Cougars have one more game left in the regular season against Missouri-Rolla at 6 p.m. on Friday (10/27) at Bob Guelker Field. \"This is a very important regional game, since we are both tied for fifth in the region. We also are looking for momentum going into the conference playoffs next week.\"\n\nFive seniors will be recognized on Friday-Eric Modeer (Hershey, Pa.), Donny Sheehan (O'Fallon), Brandon Gibbs (St. Charles, Mo.), Ryan Franklin (University Park) and John Niebruegge (Valmeyer). Gibbs scored the game-winning goal against Southern Indiana in overtime. He leads the team with six goals, six assists and 18 points. Gibbs also leads the team with five game-winning goals, including three in overtime. \"Brandon had a good weekend. He came through again with his third golden goal of the season,\" noted Huneke.\n\nModeer leads the team with six assists, while Sheehan has started 13 games this season as goalkeeper and leads the team with three shutouts and 47 saves. Franklin started one of the eight games he played in this season. Niebruegge played two games at goal and recorded three saves.\n\nWomen's Soccer Earns No. 2 Seed After Win Over Quincy\n\nCoach Brian Korbesmeyer and his women's soccer team finished the Great Lakes Valley Conference season with an 8-0-3 mark and a second-place conference finish. SIUE, 12-3-3 overall, defeated Quincy 2-0 last Friday (10/20) and worked to a 2-2 tie after two overtimes with Southern Indiana (10/22).\n\nThe Cougars qualified for the GLVC Tournament as the No. 2 seed behind Northern Kentucky. SIUE will play host to a yet undetermined opponent in a quarterfinal conference tournament game on Nov. 1 at Bob Guelker Field. The team wraps up its regular season at home on Friday (10/27) with an 8 p.m. match up against Missouri-Rolla at Bob Guelker Field.\n\nFriday's game will also be senior night. The Cougars have three seniors on the team this season in Beth Louderman (Girard), Rebecca Mays (Springfield) and Michelle Montgomery (Granite City). Louderman has started all 18 games for the Cougars this season and recorded 89 saves and five shutouts. She is third in the conference with a 0.82 goals against average. Mays continues to be a strong defender in the backfield for the Cougars by marking the key scoring threat on the opposing teams. Montgomery has recorded two goals and three assists this season.\n\nSara Decker (St. Louis) and Colleen Creamer (St. Louis, Mo.) continue to be a vital part of the Cougars offense. At Quincy, Decker and Creamer each scored a goal, while Creamer also added an assist. Creamer also scored the Cougars' first SIUE goal on Southern Indiana. Creamer and Decker share the team lead with nine goals apiece. Decker also leads the team with nine assists and 27 points. Erin Gusewelle (Edwardsville) scored her second goal of the season and tied the game against Southern Indiana.\n\nVolleyball Uses Rest And Execution To Its Advantage\n\nCoach Joe Fisher said rest and execution were the keys to the volleyball team's two wins this past weekend. \"Having the previous weekend off helped everyone,\" said Fisher. \"The team knew going in the weekend it should come out the way it did, but the way things had been going this year nothing was certain. So, we worked on our execution and didn't worry about the opponents.\"\n\nThe Cougars swept both matches against Bellarmine and Kentucky Wesleyan. SIUE, 10-13 overall and 6-6 in the Great Lakes Valley Conference, moved into third in its division with the wins. SIUE wraps up its part of the home schedule this weekend with matches against Northern Kentucky, Indianapolis and Rockhurst. The Cougars play Northern Kentucky on Friday night (10/27) at 7 at the Vadalabene Center.\n\n\"Northern Kentucky is a different team than we watched earlier this season. They lost two key components to graduation but have talent that has stepped in. The biggest thing for us will be to shut down their middle attack.\"\n\nSIUE faces Indianapolis at noon and Rockhurst at 4 p.m. on Saturday (10/28). Indianapolis and Rockhurst play each other at 2 p.m. \"As long as we pass well and serve well, things are going to go our way,\" said Fisher.\n\nSaturday also marks the final home matches for four seniors - Lindsay Rust (Belleville), Kathy Dulle (Mt.

Schaeffer is averaging 2.00 kills per game in seven games. Andrea Voss (Breese) is second in the conference with 1.18 blocks per game. Voss leads the team with 30 block solos.\n\nCougars Reload With New Faces For 2000-2001\n\nSome introductions are in order. With a roster which holds more than three players from last season's team, SIUE Men's Basketball Coach Jack Margenthaler has nine new players who will hit the court when practice began Oct. 15 for Midnight Madness at the Vadalabene Center.\n\n\"I think almost every position is challenging this year,\" said Margenthaler, who begins his ninth season as the Cougars' head coach. \"I know every coach says that, but it's wide open. We're so young and have a lot of people who can play.\"\n\nThe three returnees from last season's 9-17 overall and 5-15 GLVC mark recorded considerable playing time last season. Nick Hartwig, a senior from South Wayne, Wis., averaged 5.3 points and 5.2 rebounds per contest last season. The 6-foot, 6-inch Hartwig can be a force under the basket. \"Nick has come back as strong if not stronger,\" Margenthaler said. \"Although he's a good rebounder, I think he's become a better rebounder because he understands the importance of that aspect of the game.\"\n\nMarty Perry, a 6-9 junior from Jacksonville, is the team's top returning three-point threat. Perry hit 23 of 41 three-pointers last season. Margenthaler said that while Perry will continue to excel from three-point range his post-up game has bloomed. \"He also has done better of being able to score and finish inside,\" Margenthaler said. \"In this league, if you can't score inside and out, you're not going to get many opportunities.\"\n\nLuke Humphrey, a 6-2 sophomore from Rantoul, played in 19 games last season off the bench and averaged 2.5 points per game. \"Luke was fortunate as a freshman to get quality time last year. He's come back stronger and more aggressive as well as more confident in his shot,\" Margenthaler said.\n\nThe newest Cougars need to impress upon the SIUE coaching staff how dedicated they are to getting better. Margenthaler said the team's goal is to return to the GLVC Tournament. That only will be accomplished by focusing in practice and every second of every game. The guard position is sprinkled with a number of players who will be battling for two or three spots on the floor. \"I think you're going to see a number of different starting lineups this season,\" said Margenthaler.\n\nJoining Humphrey at guard is 6-0 freshman Bilal Spiller, 6-0 sophomore Jewel Gibbs, 6-2 freshman Wes Pickering, 6-2 sophomore Ben Garwitz, and 6-2 sophomore Garrett Thomas.\n\nSpiller, of DuQuoin, has a great deal to learn in his first season, but the potential is there, according to Margenthaler, to break into the lineup as a point guard. Gibbs, of Carbondale, is a transfer from John A. Logan Junior College. He sat out last season, but he is ready this season. \"He has excellent jumping ability and plays hard. He could see time at the two-guard or three position,\" Margenthaler said. Pickering sat out last season as an incoming freshman but played third base for the SIUE baseball program. The redshirt season should help the Springfield, Mo., native. \"He understands by watching last year the level of play that is necessary to be successful,\" Margenthaler noted. Garwitz also hails from Springfield, Mo., and was a prep teammate of Pickering's. A transfer from Westminster College, Garwitz is a walk-on who plays the off-guard position. Thomas, a transfer from Northern Illinois University, enters his first full season as a Cougar with a reputation as a strong outside shooter. The Riverton native is No. 2 on the Illinois High School Association's all-time list of career three-pointers made.\n\nJoining Hartwig and Perry in the front court are 6-6 junior Tim Rose, 6-7 junior Glen Collins and 6-7 sophomore Mustafa Cetin. Rose is another transfer from John A. Logan Junior College. The DuQuoin High School graduate is a \"slasher\" type player who finds ways to score with better-than-average rebounding skills. Collins, of Bowling Green, Ky., transferred from Shawnee Junior College. \"Glen needs to play inside and around the basket. We need him to be a defensive player, a rebounder and a scorer off putbacks,\" said Margenthaler. Cetin, of Edmonton, Canada, transferred from the University College of the Cariboo in British Columbia. \"He has size and is an excellent outside shooter. He runs the floor extremely well for a big man, but he needs to become a more aggressive style of player.\"\n\nThe Cougars also list Jon Wolf, a freshman from Okawville, as its lone center. The 6-8 Wolf is a walk-on who Margenthaler said has potential at this level. \"I think he's made tremendous progress already. The stronger Jon gets throughout the season will be a big factor for him.\"\n\nSIUE once again faces the 12-team Great Lakes Valley Conference. Kentucky Wesleyan College, which has been to the NCAA Division II championship game in each of the past three seasons, heads the gauntlet known as the GLVC's 20-game conference schedule.\n\nThe Cougars also face a difficult non-conference schedule, which includes Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference foes Northwood University (Mich.) and Wayne State (Mich.) University. The Cougars open the 2000-2001 season with a 7:30 p.m. home game against Eureka on Saturday, Nov. 18.\n\n2000-01 SIUE Women's Basketball Aims High\n\nWith 11 returning players from an 18-9 squad a year ago and three incoming freshmen, optimism is growing for the 2000-01 Women's basketball season.\n\nAnd rightfully so. \"My expectations for the team are high because we have most of our players returning,\" Coach Wendy Hedberg said. \"We lost two starters, but both have been replaced by either returning players or incoming freshmen. We had a very good recruiting class with three All-State players.\"\n\nBut what exactly are the expectations? \"Being ranked No. 2 in the Great Lakes Valley Conference preseason poll, I believe our overall goal is to win the conference championship and go onto the NCAA Tournament. I think it is a realistic goal with these girls.\"\n\nThe Cougars have made the big dance three times, all of those appearances coming in the past six seasons-1994, 1998 and 1999. The team fell short of its third consecutive NCAA bid when they fell to Bellarmine 64-56 in the first round of the GLVC Tournament last year. However, the challenge comes in winning its first-ever conference title since joining the GLVC in 1994.\n\nThe Cougars finished last season in fourth place in the conference with a record of 13-7. Hedberg looks to her newcomers to help with the task. \"I believe each of the newcomers will see a lot of playing time this year, and possibly provide an immediate impact on how things go.\"\n\nThe Cougars return four players to the backcourt this season led by two-time All-American honorable mention Misi Clark (Paris). A senior, Clark already holds three career records at SIUE in points (1,676), free throws made (484) and free throws attempted (710). Named GLVC Co-Player of the Year last season, she also is in the top four of six other SIUE career records. The 5-foot, 10-inch guard set single season records in points per game (21.4) and free throw attempted (251). \"We have one of the "
