        "text": "Pulp and paper mill in Boyer, Tasmania\n\nTrading as Norske Skog Boyer, the Boyer Mill is a pulp and paper mill located in Boyer, Tasmania, Australia. Constructed in 1941 by Australian Newsprint Mills, the mill was the first producer of newsprint paper in Australasia. Producing 260,000 tonnes (260,000 long tons; 290,000 short tons) of product in 2020, the mill is currently Australia's only manufacturer of newsprint and magazine-grade paper. The mill's operations make a substantial contribution to Tasmania's gross state product, estimated at $390 million.[3] Boyer Mill has been owned and operated by the Norwegian pulp and paper company Norske Skog since 2000.[1][4]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSituated on a 157-acre (64 ha) site, the paper mill was constructed during the Second World War by Australian Newsprint Mills Pty Ltd (ANM) to produce newsprint paper for the burgeoning Australian newspaper industry.[5][6][7] It was the first pulp and paper mill in the world to utilise hardwood to produce newsprint.[8]\n\nSimilar to EZ Industries' Risdon zinc smelter at Lutana and Cadbury's Claremont, ANM was motivated to establish its factory along the River Derwent due to the availability of affordable hydro electricity. Following the high worker standards set by Cadbury in the region, ANM built a model village for its 175 employees, which included housing, a pool, tennis courts, meeting hall and football oval.[1]\n\nThe chainsaw had replaced the crosscut saw by 1960, speeding up the extraction of timber. Boyer Mill grew, and new equipment raised productivity. However, the workforce was gradually decreased by mechanisation and outsourcing out labour, and the Maydena neighbourhood was added to the Southwest National Park, which precluded further growth. By the close of the 1980s, Boyer Mill was on the verge of closing due to outdated equipment and international competition. When New Zealand's largest paper company Fletcher Challenge took over in 1988 the 3000-person workforce was cut to 600. In 1990, the Maydena depot was abandoned.\n\nIn 2000, Norske Skog, a Norwegian-based paper company, acquired ANM and the Boyer mill became a part of their operations. Since then, it has continued to be an integral part of Norske Skog's global paper production network.\n\nIn 2010, the mill was recognised by Engineering Heritage Tasmania as a national engineering landmark.[8]\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Norske Skog Boyer mill operates two paper machines and specialises in the production of various paper grades, such as newsprint and uncoated, high brightness specialty grades suited for offset colour printing. The mill plays a significant role in the Australian market, with annual production accounting for approximately 40% of the country's newsprint and related paper grades consumption.[3]\n\nCoal source\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Boyer Mill utilises approximately 85,000 tonnes (84,000 long tons; 94,000 short tons) of black coal per annum to fuel its coal-fired boiler.[11] Norske Skog sourced coal from Cornwall Coal's Cullenswood mine in the Fingal Valley until 2023, when its useable resources were depleted.[11][12] In March 2023, Norske Skog began sourcing coal from interstate, supplied by Yancoal from sites in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia.[11]\n\nUpgrades\n\n[edit]\n\nBis Industries constructed a state-of-the-art plantation softwood chipping facility at the mill, worth $22.5 million in 1985. The facility is owned, operated, and maintained by Bis and is used by Norske Skog. It consolidated the previous chipping operations into a single efficient operation.[13]\n\nIn 2013, Norske Skog invested $84 million to convert one of the mill's paper machines for lightweight coated paper production. The Federal Government granted $28 million, and the State Government offered a $13 million loan for the investment.[4]\n\nBoth the federal Labor and Liberal parties pledged $2 million for upgrades at the Norske Skog paper mill in 2022. The State Government has also committed $2 million, while the papermaker itself has contributed $2.9 million.[14][15]\n\nBoiler upgrade\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2023, Norske Skog initiated a feasibility study to replace its ageing coal-fired boiler at the Boyer Mill with electrode boilers. The company is in discussions with Hydro Tasmania and the State Government to explore the possibility of near doubling their power consumption through the delivery of a further 50 megawatts (67,000 hp) to the Boyer Mill per annum.[16]\n\nTransportation\n\n[edit]\n\nProduct was shipped down the River Derwent to Hobart by barge from 1941 until 1986.[17]\n\nThe Boyer Mill is a significant customer of Tasmanian rail and road networks, as well as Bass Strait shipping. Annually, the mill transports more than 1,000,000 tonnes (980,000 long tons; 1,100,000 short tons) of finished products and raw materials through these transportation systems.[3]\n\nPollution\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Boyer Mill has contributed significant pollution issues to the area, impacting both the environment and human health. Pollution linked to the Boyer Mill stems from different phases of the paper production process, encompassing pulping, bleaching, and wastewater treatment. A Commonwealth taskforce was established in 1990 to assess the mill's environmental impact.[19]\n\nSince 2001, Norske Skog Boyer has operated under strict environmental conditions and practices, complying with an externally audited ISO 14001-certified Environmental management system. Norske Skog Boyer holds Sustainable Forest Management and Chain of Custody certificates from the Australian Forestry Standard and Forest Stewardship Council certification systems.\n\nAirborne emissions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Boyer Mill's coal-fired boiler emits various air pollutants in the form of particulate matter and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Released during combustion, particulate matter consists of fine particles and gases including resin acid, sulfur compounds and nitrogen oxides. VOCs, released during various stages of paper production, are associated with smog, acid rain, greenhouse gases and air quality degradation.\n\nEstuary contamination\n\n[edit]\n\nOne of the primary concerns is the discharge of effluent into the nearby River Derwent. The mill releases wastewater in the form of sludge and wood residues that contain various pollutants, including organic matter, suspended solids, and chemical substances such as lignin used in the paper-making process. These chemicals deplete oxygen levels in the water, harming aquatic organisms and disrupting ecosystems. Pulp bleaching processes involving chlorine compounds generate toxic chlorinated organic compounds, which further contributed to water pollution. In recent years, the mill has made substantial progress in water conservation, achieving a reduction of over 60% in water usage since 1985.[3]\n\nBridgewater causeway\n\n[edit]\n\nDownstream, the convict-built, 1830s causeway connecting Granton and Bridgewater via the Bridgewater Bridge acts as a catchment for sludge and wastewater pollutants. Further to this downstream at Lutana, the zinc refinery Nyrstar Hobart has contributed to significant pollution to the estuary waters. The smelter's discharging of methylmercury (mercury) and other toxic heavy metals into the Derwent estuary greatly contributed in creating one of the most polluted river systems in the world by the close of the 1970s.[25] Studies in 2009, 2012 and 2020 have concluded that heavy metal contaminants, including cadmium, lead, zinc and mercury, risk being disturbed by the New Bridgewater Bridge construction project.[26]\n\nDeforestation\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorically, Tasmania has faced significant deforestation and forest degradation due to various industries, including logging for timber and paper production. The expansion of the paper industry, including the establishment of the Boyer paper mill, greatly contributed to the demand for raw materials, such as pulpwood from native forests.\n\nMaydena depot\n\n[edit]\n\nANM evaluated the development of a logging headquarters near Maydena in 1949,[27] and it was established in 1950, featuring a railway marshalling yard, log storage, loading facilities, offices, a store, oil depot, and a workshop for vehicle maintenance. 32 workers cottages were built nearby to facilitate the loggers.[28] By the mid-1950s, the Boyer Mill was utilising over 120,000,000 board feet (280,000 m3) of sawn timber wood fibre per annum.[29] The Boyer mill primarily sought raw materials from its Maydena depot, until its closure in the late 1980s.[30]\n\nForest assets\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2020, Norske Skog sold its remaining Tasmanian forest assets to the investment manager firm New Forests Pty Ltd for $62.5m. The sale encompassed plantations that traditionally accounted for approximately two-thirds of Boyer's annual consumption of pulpwood, totalling around 550,000 tonnes (540,000 long tons; 610,000 short tons). Following the completion of the transaction, Boyer entered into a long-term agreement with the buyer, guaranteeing an annual supply of 360,000 tonnes (350,000 long tons; 400,000 short tons) of pulpwood.[31]\n\nHealth risks\n\n[edit]\n\nPollution from pulp and paper mills can pose health risks to nearby communities. Exposure to air pollutants, including particulate matter and VOCs, can lead to respiratory issues, cardiovascular problems, and other health complications. Contaminated water sources can also pose risks to human health, affecting both drinking water supplies and the safety of fish and other seafood consumed by local communities. Historically, issues surrounding health were raised by workers at the Boyer Mill and members of the community alike.[32][33] Norske Skog Boyer established a Health and Safety Employees Fund in the early 2000s when individual employee funds were amalgamated into a unified and cohesive mill fund.\n\nAccess\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Boyer Mill is accessible via Boyer Road, Boyer. There are no public transport routes servicing the Boyer Mill.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of paper mills\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nSources\n\n[edit]\n\nNorske Skog (2022-01-01). \"Annual Review for the Boyer Mill 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021\" (PDF).
