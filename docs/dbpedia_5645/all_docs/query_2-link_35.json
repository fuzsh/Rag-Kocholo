        "text": "Renewable raw materials from responsibly managed forests are Billerud's most important resource, and we strive to source our raw materials from forests as close to our mills as possible. During 2023, 98.8% of the wood raw material for our European operations came from European countries.\n\nAbout 75% of the wood fiber used by our European operations comes from Swedish forests and the rest mainly from Norway, Finland and the Baltics.\n\nAbout 75% of Billerud's fiber volume in Europe is supplied by around 90 sawmills, forest owners associations and large forest companies, based on supply agreements. About 25% of the fiber volume in Europe is harvested by our own forest organization at private forest owners and on Bergvik Skog Öst's land. Bergvik Skog Öst's forest, which we manage, covers almost 300,000 hectares of productive forest land in central Sweden. The forest management assignment includes all harvesting, forestry and all other practical issues related to forest holdings. A service that we also offer to the private forest owners through our field purchase department.\n\nIn North America, Billerud procures about four million tons of wood fiber from wood producers in the USA and Canada. Most of our wood fiber is sourced from the Great Lakes region of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Ontario. Over half of the forest area is owned by numerous non-industrial private landowners (small holders) with the balance of the ownership represented by local, state, and federal agencies, industry, and others. The amount of wood (standing stock in the forest) is increasing in the Great Lakes region due to growth rates exceeding harvest levels. Sustainable harvesting methods ensure that forests are promptly reforested after harvest through natural regeneration or direct planting.\n\nTo read more about our department in Sweden, continue reading on our Swedish website.\n\nGo to billerud.se/skog\n\nThe fiber must originate from forests managed by recognized sustainable forestry practices, including careful planning with a long-term perspective. Responsibly managed forests include active forest management with high growth rates, while also taking into account biodiversity and social values, as well as enhanced climate benefits.\n\nBillerud values close cooperation with the most important stakeholders in the forest industry as crucial for creating a stable wood supply and achieving sustainable improvements. Our long-term relationships with forest companies, forest owners and sawmills enable us to meet the requirements for the delivery of sustainable, cost-effective fiber and responsible forestry.\n\nCertifications guaranteeing sustainable forestry\n\nWe certify according to FSC® (FSC-C023846) and PEFC (PEFC/05-31-78).\n\nAll of the raw wood material we use in our operations originates from responsibly managed forests. We are third-party certified to chain of custody standards set by the Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®), Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), and in North America, also the Sustainable Forestry Initiative® (SFI®). Billerud’s due diligence system ensures that all fiber is purchased in accordance with procedures set out by FSC Controlled Wood, Controlled Sources in PEFC Chain of Custody and comply with the EUTR and U.S. Lacey Act timber legislations.\n\nYou can find a list of all our certificates and directives\n\nRead more about our work on sustainable wood supply"
