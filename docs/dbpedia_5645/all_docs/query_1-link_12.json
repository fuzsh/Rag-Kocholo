        "text": "According to Norske Skog, a fossil CO2 reduction of around 80% has been calculated, and the NOx emissions will be reduced by around 40%.\n\nJune 27, 2024 - Norske Skog on June 25 officially opened a new thermomechanical pulp (TMP) production line at its pulp and paper mill in Skogn, Norway.\n\nNorske Skog first announced the NOK 180 million (USD 18.2 million) TMP line project in January 2023. The company received grant funding of about NOK 40-50 million from the NOx fund.\n\nKey facts about the project:\n\nThe new thermomechanical production line (TMP) replaces expensive recycled paper with fresh fibre.\n\nMore than 70% of the equipment is second-hand, reducing our carbon footprint with approximately 500 tons of CO2, and major cost savings.\n\nA fossil CO2 reduction of around 80% has been calculated, and the NOx emissions will be reduced by around 40%. The ash reduction is estimated at around 60%.\n\nHÃ¥vard Busklein, Managing Director at Skogn, said, \"As a company, we are concerned about sustainability at every step of the value chain. The vast majority of the equipment is reused from other mills in the industry, which have chosen to close or convert their production. Our skilled employees have seen this opportunity and utilized it to create a very cost-effective project.\"\n\nSkogn Mill\n\nNorske Skog Skogn is one of the largest newsprint mills in Europe. The mill has three paper machines — PM1, PM2 and PM3 — with a combined production capacity of 480,000 tonnes per year of newsprint and improved newsprint.\n\nThe NOx Fund\n\nThe NOx Fund was established in 2008 by 15 business organizations based on the NOx Agreement with the Norwegian authorities. Through the Agreement, the NOx Fund is to reduce NOx emissions in Norway and contribute to fulfilling Norway's commitments under the Gothenburg Protocol and the EU's emissions directive. The main task of the NOx Fund is to finance concrete NOx reduction measures. The Fund provides financial support to businesses to implement green technology and reduce NOx emissions.\n\nNorske Skog is a leading producer of publication paper with strong market positions and customer relations in Europe and Australasia. The Norske Skog Group operates four mills in Europe, two of which will produce recycled packaging paper following ongoing conversion projects. In addition, the Group operates one paper mill in Australia.\n\nSOURCE: Norske Skog"
