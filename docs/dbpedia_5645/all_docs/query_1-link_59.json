        "text": "The mobile phone in teen identity and subculture\n\nIn Norway two-thirds of teens own or have access to mobile phones, so how they are used and viewed by teens is an important issue. Through two surveys of mobile phone use among Norwegian teenagers, we gain insight into this technology's role in young people's lives. Clearly, though, a large role is occupied by the short messaging service (SMS), which allows transmission of text messages via mobile phone. Though messages are limited to 160 characters, they are quite economical (Ling, 2000). SMS has spurred teens to create an anglicized clique-based abbreviated language. The mobile phones also have various technical facilities including the ability to download ring tones (“hit” pop music), logos, pictures and games; mobiles are available in various brands, designs and colors. The newest ones, WAP (Wireless Application Protocol) phones, access the Internet and e-mail. Hence teen users are not only consumers but producers as well since they are free to create an individual phone by combining the above elements. The flexibility and social contact allowed by the technology mean that it has become harnessed as part of many a teen's identity project.\n\nIdentity itself is the process by which social actors use cultural attributes to recognize themselves and construct meaning (Castells, 1996). For teens, three processes are formative in constructing their identities: reflexivity, makeability and individualization (Ziehe, 1989)."
