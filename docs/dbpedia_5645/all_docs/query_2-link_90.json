At the same time, Drangsland left the board of directors, where he was succeeded by board member Arvid Grundekjøn as chair.\n\nThrough the companies Byggma ASA and Drangsland Kapital AS, Drangsland controls about 24 per cent of the shares of Norske Skog, having increased his holdings last winter.\n\nLong industrial experience\n\nDrangsland has more than 30 years of experience from the wood processing industry and other businesses as an investor, chairman and manager. He is the majority owner, and until 1 September also the CEO of Byggma ASA, which is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. Byggma is the owner of several well-known brands in the Nordic building industry.\n\nHis entrepreneurial awakenings came during a stint as finance director of Elkjøp, the leading retailer of electronics and household appliances in Norway: “For me, it was now or never. Norske Skog was about to sell part of their building material portfolio. I was fortunate when I could buy Fibo-Trespo in 1997 and Forestia in 2005 from Norske Skog. Today, I have developed Byggma into a building material group with five strong mills with a broad spectre of products, all with their base in wood processing.”\n\nAll in for Norske Skog\n\nNow, he looks forward to getting to know Norske Skog even better and sees many exciting business opportunities ahead for Norske Skog.\n\n“I invested in Norske Skog because I believe in the company and its green product portfolio. Norske Skog is in the middle of a green transformation. Publication paper machines are, and will be, converted to other products with increasing demand, like containerboard and similar products. The long-term strategic ambition will be to diversify our product portfolio through creative utilization of fibre sources, which will add value not only for our shareholders but also for other stakeholders,” says Drangsland.\n\nGreen transformation\n\nRegarding the ongoing green transformation, Drangsland points to the political ambitions of a zero-emission society in 2050.\n\n“Europe and Australia will until 2050 be dedicated to fulfilling the common commitments of a carbon-neutral industry and altered biodiversity conditions. Through our strategic choices, Norske Skog is without doubt well positioned to be a competitive business leader in the green transition,” says Drangsland.\n\nMaking the conversion projects successful\n\nDrangsland has invested about EUR 140 million in Norske Skog. He just stepped down as CEO of Byggma to pay all his attention to Norske Skog.\n\n“First: I truly believe in Norske Skog. And second: I take great interest in developing the company to create long-term value, and that’s what I intend to do full-time as CEO,” says Drangsland.\n\n“While I have great faith in Norske Skog, we face some challenges that we have to address head-on. The publication paper market continues to decline. Meanwhile, we have invested close to EUR 450 million in the two conversion projects at Bruck and Golbey. The Bruck conversion went smoothly thanks to a very competent project management group. Now, we need to ensure that the Golbey conversion projects will be similarly successful before we make other large-scale plans for further conversion of our mill portfolio,” says Drangsland.\n\nBright future ahead\n\nAbout his new role as CEO, Drangsland says:\n\n“I know Norske Skog well as an investor and from the board work, and I’m ready to get to know the team even better from the inside. Norske Skog will still be a great company to work for, and we have a bright future ahead of us,” he concludes."
