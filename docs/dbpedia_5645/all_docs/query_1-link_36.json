        "text": "Norwegian pulp and paper company Norske Skog has received NOK6.5m ($0.7m) grant from state-owned company Innovation Norway for two projects.\n\nOf the total grant, Norske Skog has received NOK4.5m ($0.5m) for the further development of microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) or nanocellulose, and NOK2.0m ($0.2m) for the development of fibreboard.\n\nThe renewable MFC will enhance paper-based products and be developed as a replacement for plastic products.\n\n\"If we succeed in producing MFC with this technology and use it in our paper production, this could reduce our costs and make us more competitive in the future.\"\n\nIt can also be used as a thickening substance in several products, such as paint.\n\nNorske Skog president and CEO Sven Ombudstvedt said: \"If we succeed in producing MFC with this technology and use it in our paper production, this could reduce our costs and make us more competitive in the future.\"\n\nInnovation Norway has already financed a pre-built pilot plant for MFC production at Norske Skog Saugbrugs, a pulp mill and paper mill located in Halden, Norway.\n\nSlated to open later this year, the MFC manufacturing plant has a daily capacity of about 1t.\n\nInnovation Norway senior advisor Erlend Ystrøm Hårtveit said: \"Creating new businesses at Norske Skog Saugbrugs is a future-oriented development within a traditional industry.\n\n\"The projects are based on world-class wood fibre competence, creating new jobs in south-east Norway.\"\n\nNorske Skog will also construct a pilot plant to develop necessary production techniques and ensure full-scale production of the new fibreboards.\n\nAs revealed in preliminary test results, the new light-weight fibreboards have a solid structure and improved insulation capabilities.\n\nThe fibreboards will be tested and developed jointly with potential customers in the construction industry."
