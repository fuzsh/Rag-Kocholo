        "text": "Tag: Skogfjorden\n\nWeekly Photo Challenge: Companionable\n\nThis week’s WordPress Photo Challenge invites us to share a picture of a”companion” with an explanation of the choice. In encouraging bloggers to interpret the theme broadly, the WordPress editor writes:\n\nYou might think “companion” refers to a person with whom you share experiences, but the definition is much broader:\n\nA person who is frequently in the company of, associates with, or accompanies another.\n\nA mate or match for something.\n\nA handbook or guide.\n\nA member of the lowest rank in an order of knighthood.\n\n(The Weekly Challenge also states: If your companion is actually a low-ranking knight, you win.)\n\nI chose this photo of myself with four (I include my daughter, even though only her blonde curls can be seen in the lower right corner) of my favorite companions. A dear friend since childhood and former roommate, who has accompanied me though each stage of my life. The daughter of another dear friend and my own daughter, a new generation seeking guidance as they grow into the women that they will one day be. Another longtime friend, a leader and mentor to hundreds if not thousands of young people over the past 30 years – who just happens to also be a knight*.\n\nThese are all companions who I have met through Skogfjorden, Concordia Language Villages‘ Norwegian immersion program. This is my fourteenth summer and my ninth on staff. As we sing in Norwegian, “Vi er kompiser på Skogfjorden!” (We are companions at Skogfjorden). This photo captures that spirit of companionship for me.\n\n*In 2009, Tove Irene Dahl, the dean of Skogfjorden, was named a Knight (Ridder) of the First Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of Merit by His Majesty King Harald V of Norway for the advancement of Norwegian language and culture in the United States.\n\nThe Order of Merit is lower than the Order of St. Olav – does that count as a low-ranking knight?\n\nIf so, what do I win?\n\nWeekly Photo Challenge: Rosemaling\n\nRosemaling, the decorative folk painting of Norway, began in the low-land areas of eastern Norway about 1750. Persons who rosemaled for their livelihood would not have been land owners but poor, city dwellers. After being trained within a “guild” they would travel from county to county painting churches and/or the homes of the wealthy for a commission of either money or merely room and board. Thus rosemaling was carried over the mountains and toward Norway’s western coast. Once farther away from the influence of the guilds, these artists tried new ideas and motifs.\n\nSoon strong regional styles developed. The Telemark and Hallingdal valleys became especially known for their fine rosemaling.Upon their exposure to rosemaling, rural folk would often imitate this folk art. Not having been taught in an urban guild, the amateur became spontaneous and expressive in his work on smaller objects such as drinking vessels and boxes.\n\nRosemaling went out of style in about 1860-1870. Rosemaling experienced it’s revival in America in the 20th century when Norwegian-Americans gave attention to the painted trunks and other objects brought to America by their ancestors.\n\nThe rosemaling pictured above were painted by Sigmund Aarseth.\n\nThey decorate the walls and ceiling of Gimle (the dining hall) at Skogfjorden,Concordia College’s Norwegian Language Village in Minnesota.\n\nHistory from Rosemaling.org\n\nTo see other interpretations of the theme Curves, click here."
