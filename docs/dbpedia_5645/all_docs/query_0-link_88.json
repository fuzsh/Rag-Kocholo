The agreement contributes to secure jobs and the long-term competitiveness of Skogn. At the same time, this is important for the forest sector in Central Norway, says Sven Ombudstvedt, CEO of Norske Skog and chairman of Norske Skog Skogn AS.",

        "text": "HEINZEL GROUP successfully completes acquisition of Steyrermühl paper mill from UPM\n\nHEINZEL GROUP is pleased to announce the successful completion of its acquisition of the Steyrermühl paper mill in Upper Austria from UPM. This strategic move reinforces Heinzel's commitment to sustainability and growth in the paper and packaging industry. The acquisition agreement for the mill including its roughly 400 employees was signed in June 2022 for a takeover in 2024. Already in March 2023 the ownership of an idled graphic paper machine in Steyrermühl was transferred to HEINZEL GROUP and a conversion project there is well on track. Once converted by the second quarter of 2024, the machine will produce up to 150,000 tons of brown and white low-grammage kraft papers per year to be marketed under HEINZEL GROUP’S well-established STARKRAFT brand. With the closing of the transaction HEINZEL GROUP has now also taken over the Steyrermühl sawmill, a local power plant run with biomass and residues, and other facilities. HEINZEL GROUP plans to develop Steyrermühl into a supply center for heat and renewable energy for both the neighboring Laakirchen paper mill and the wider Laakirchen community.\n\nSappi Europe to maintain prices of Woodfree Coated Paper for the remainder of 2023\n\nIn an effort to address prevalent supply chain uncertainties and to maintain the commercial viability of its Graphic Paper business, Sappi Europe will keep prices for its Woodfree Coated Paper grades stable at today’s level for the remainder of 2023. This commitment facilitates customers' ability to commit to business in advance of the traditionally busier fourth quarter for the printing industry. Market conditions are similar across the region, but obviously diverge between countries and segments and as such Sappi Europe’s sales personnel is always available for these individual customer specifics. Sappi Europe remains fully committed to serving the printing business and will work closely with our customers to ensure the best possible outcome throughout the print media value chain."
