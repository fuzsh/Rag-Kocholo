        "text": "In case you are fond of Brno, Scandinavian interior design and top-quality coffee, stop by SKØG Urban Hub, a multipurpose, modern place that has been attracting both locals and tourists since 2015.\n\nThe unique concept that comprises a coffee place and a bar, as well as a coffee roastery and a place for cultural events came into existence thanks to two young men, both dedicated lovers of Brno, according to whom the lovely city of Brno had been missing a multifunctional space that would serve as a gathering place for people with the same liking – an urban hub. Thus they created an excellent establishment that has become a sought after place where to meet friends, fellow students and business partners, where to organize various social and culture events, an asylum for all those who spent days working on a laptop, and at the same time a distinctive coffee roaster. SKØG Urban Hub is situated right in the city center of Brno, at Dominican Square, and covers two floors, one of which houses – among others – the Rusty Nails Coffee Roaster. This small roastery is based on the so-called third wave coffee movement and focuses on direct cooperation with coffee growers, sustainable and traceable coffee production and lighter roasts. Thanks to that, SKØG offers a wide range of truly exquisite coffee drinks. Aside from warm and cold coffee drinks, the offer includes homemade lemonades, fresh desserts, breakfasts, salads, soups and other small meals. Another reason to visit SKØG Urban Hub is the interior itself, boasting all the attributes of a hip place. ‘Skog’ in Swedish means forest and it is, therefore, only logical that the slightly industrial interior is full of wooden design elements. Whether you are meeting your friends, grabbing a quick light lunch, or spending the day working on a laptop, you will most definitely enjoy the setting of the SKØG Urban Hub!"
