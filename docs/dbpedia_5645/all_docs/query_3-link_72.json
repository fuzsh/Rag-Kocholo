Skog has webbed feet and a fin on his head, suggesting he is from a partially-marine population.\n\nHistory[]\n\nSkog was sent to download secret weapon files from an unknown target. With this knowledge, Skog's government would have the capability to destroy the \"peace-loving nation\" he was stealing from. Amy intervened by using a telephone cord to catapult herself onto Skog's shoulder. She then confused him by hitting him on the neck and pulling on his collar. When she noticed that Tekno was being harassed by a spider, Amy called out, causing Skog to believe he was hearing voices. Amy used this to her advantage, convincing Skog that she was his conscience and that he should abandon his deadly plans. The plan worked, with the agent deciding to take up stamp collecting.\n\nAppearances[]"
