Glommen Mjøsen Skog is committed to ensuring biological diversity and safeguarding the significance of forests and uncultivated land for culture, the environment and outdoor activities and for those whose work is related to forests.\n\nTwo IT environments become one\n\nIn 2019 the companies Glommen Skog and Mjøsen Skog merged.\n\nMerging their IT environments and system portfolios created a number of challenges, including in relation to the prioritisation of development work, how the systems should be operated, supplier collaboration, work processes and what systems should continue to be used. The company’s management therefore needed to set a common direction for IT and to ensure its efficiency going forward.\n\nThis created a significant need to prepare an overview of the complexity of the current situation and to create a new strategy that would set a common direction for IT and technology at the merged company. The strategy had to ensure the company would have a future-oriented and cost-effective IT function that contributed to growth and strengthened the company’s future competitiveness."
