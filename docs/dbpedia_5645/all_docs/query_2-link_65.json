        "text": "NORWAY (News release) -- Norske Skog invested in a new TMP (thermomechanical pulping) line at the Skogn mill in Norway. The new TMP line replaces recycled fibres. The availability of recycled fibres has declined in recent years while procurement and transportation costs have increased. This is due to a reduced consumption of printing paper and an increased demand for recycled fibres in the growing packaging market.\n\nBy building the new TMP line at Skogn, the Company ensures that it can produce on all machines without recycled fibres. Additionally, transitioning away from recycled fibres will result in less ash from the boilers, lower fossil CO2 emissions, and reduced NOx emissions into the air.\n\nThe project is important for the Skogn mill for several reasons. It positively impacts various environmental parameters, reduces our production costs, and is a significant strategic investment, providing both capacity and quality to explore potential future products. The profitability is also solid, and the project has a relatively short payback period.\n\nHÃ¥vard Busklein, Managing Director of Norske Skog Skogn, says: \"We are well underway with the assembly work, and work related to electrical and automation systems has begun. The schedule is on track, and we look forward to starting the new line and fine-tuning it during the first half of 2024.\"\n\nNorske Skog is a world leading producer of publication paper with strong market positions and customer relations in Europe and Australasia."
