        "text": "The National Forest Inventory is a sample plot inventory aimed at providing data on natural resources and the environment for forest land in Norway. The Inventory is conducted by the Norwegian Forest and Landscape Institute. Inventory work was started in 1919, with the different inventory cycles taking place in the following years:\n\n1: 1919-30 2: 1937-56 3: 1957-64 4: 1964-76 5: 1980-86 6: 1986-93 7: 1994-98 8: 2000-04 9: 2005-09 10: 2010-2014 11: 2015-2019 12: 2020-2024\n\nAs from the inventory cycle 2007-2011 Finnmark county was surveyed for the first time.\n\nEach inventory cycle covers the most important forest districts, while inventories in western and northern Norway have been carried out less frequently and are sometimes incomplete.\n\nThe most central users of the results from the National Forest Inventory are public administration at national and county level. The results serve as important input for the formation of forestry policies and control the effects of it.\n\nIn recent years, the demand for national forestry statistics has increased, and the National Forest Inventory is a central data source. Data from the inventories are used for example in research to develop descriptive models of forest dynamics.\n\nThe forest industry is an important user of the data. Among others thing, they need the data for strategic planning in the sawmill and pulp industry. The data are also used by educational institutions and by professionals in agriculture, forestry and environmental protection.\n\nThe only data source is the National Forest Inventory's database. One of the main tasks of the National Forest Inventory is the assessment of timber resources. Data are collected so that the volume can be computed for different tree species, diameters and quality classes. Numbers of trees and annual increments are also calculated.\n\nThe National Forest Inventory's data collection is based on data from permanent sample plots. For the entire country except Finnmark, a systematic sample plot inventory in a bond by 3 x 3 kilometres is established. In the present inventory cycle, sample plots for Finnmark are also established. The plots are visited every five years and the survey forms the basis for statistics for the whole of Norway. In order to publish data by county, temporary plots are established in the counties when each county is appraised. Each county is appraised every fifteen years. An extensive number of attributes concerning forest conditions are recorded on the plots, some of which describe the area. Parameters that characterise level of development and species composition of the vegetation, certain aspects of biodiversity, utilisation and yield capacity of the land, forest treatment, conditions surrounding forest operations, etc., are measured or estimated. Inside a 250 square metre circle, every tree with a diameter of more than five centimetres in breast height (1.3 metres above ground level) is callipered.\n\nThe sampling design has changed considerably over the years. The first two cycles were carried out as strip sampling inventories. A system of parallel strips was established throughout the area of interest, and measurements were taken within these strips. In the middle of the 1950s, the strip sampling was replaced by a systematic sample plot inventory, a method which has also been used subsequently. However, minor alterations concerning sampling design have been made several times.\n\nAn important difference between the period 1986-1993 and the previous inventory cycles was the introduction of permanent sample plots. A sub-sample of the established plots was marked in order to be able to re-measure the exact same area in future inventories. This was to provide greater possibilities for detecting changes in forest conditions. The permanent plots were re-measured during the period 1994-1998, according to a specific pattern. The inventory of one single year will provide representative results for the whole country.\n\nHighly conspicuous markings are avoided in order to prevent the location of the plots from being too obvious to passers-by. The permanent plots should represent a random sample of the forests in Norway, and should not be treated any different than the rest of the forests. A total of approximately 16 000 permanent sample plots have been established, of which about 10 500 are located on productive forest and other wooded land below the coniferous forest limit. On average, the sampled area comprises about 3 x 10 -5 of the surveyable area.\n\nBefore each field season, training is held for the field crew. During the field season, the office staff visit the field workers at least once and some controls are carried out. In most cases, a control of the assessment is done. About 5 per cent of the sample plots are surveyed once more.\n\nCorrections of the field instructions are made before every field season. A main revision is carried out every five years.\n\nIn order to estimate figures, for instance for a county, the area factor must be known. In a 3 x 3 kilometre net the area factor will be close to nine square kilometres or 900 hectares. Each sample plot will represent 900 hectares. For each tree measured, a volume with and without bark and the increment are estimated. Multiplying this with the area factor will establish how much each tree represents in this area. The volume for the growing stock in a county for instance can be found by summarising the volume of each measured tree in the county multiplied with the area factor.\n\nEmployees of Statistics Norway have a duty of confidentiality.\n\nStatistics Norway does not publish figures if there is a risk of the respondent’s contribution being identified. This means that, as a general rule, figures are not published if fewer than three units form the basis of a cell in a table or if the contribution of one or two respondents constitutes a very large part of the cell total.\n\nStatistics Norway can make exceptions to the general rule if deemed necessary to meet the requirements of the EEA agreement, if the respondent is a public authority, if the respondent has consented to this, or when the information disclosed is openly accessible to the public.\n\nMore information can be found on Statistics Norway’s website under Methods in official statistics, in the ‘Confidentiality’ section.\n\nFigures on property level are not published."
