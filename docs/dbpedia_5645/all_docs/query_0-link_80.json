Having worked at Norske Skog since 2009, the new CEO knows the group well. In fact, his track record is even longer, as he worked summers at Norske Skog Saugbrugs while he was a student at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).\n\n“I will hit the ground running. I know Norske Skog from the inside, and I have been involved in setting the strategy we have followed over the past years. I look forward to continuing to work closely with so many competent employees throughout the organization. Our employees are definitely an asset as we expand our operations to new markets,” says Tore Hansesætre.\n\nHansesætre has held several positions within strategy and operations. For the past years, he has been in charge of strategic projects, including the conversion of machines from publication paper to recycled containerboard for the packaging market at the mills in Bruck, Austria, and Golbey, France.\n\n“It feels great that the intention we announced back in 2020, is now actually becoming a reality, as Bruck is now producing packaging paper and the conversion work at Golbey PM1 is progressing well. While this market has dipped after the corona-fueled online shopping boom, we firmly believe that the underlying trend is positive, driven by online shopping and a shift from fossil-based plastic to renewable containerboard,” says Hansesætre.\n\n“There is still a substantial market for publication paper, much bigger than many predicted some years ago. We will be a competitive supplier as long as there is a meaningful market, and this intention is underlined by our investment in a new thermo-mechanical production line at Norske Skog Skogn in Norway,” Hansesætre says.\n\n“I see great potential in building additional businesses related to our mills and the supply chain we are a part of. Some of this, such as the Bruck waste-to-energy facility providing new revenues and fossil-free energy, is already operational. Other projects are earlier stage but hold exciting potential for the future,” says Hansesætre.\n\n“Obviously, this was a shock. The main thing is that, luckily, no one was harmed. It takes time to secure the area and fully assess the damage and rebuild needs, so we can’t give details or a timeline for PM6 yet. Financially, this will be an insurance case. In the meantime, PM4 is continuing to produce SC magazine paper,” he says."
