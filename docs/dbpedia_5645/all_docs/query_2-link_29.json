        "text": "Norske Skog‚Äôs EBITDA in the second quarter of 2024 was NOK 471 million, an increase from NOK 76 million in the first quarter of 2024. The second quarter EBITDA was positively impacted by insurance at Norske Skog Saugbrugs of NOK 338 million. Despite signs of positive developments in the publication and containerboard markets, closures are still required. The process to deliver a main study on the BCTMP-production project (bleached chemi-thermomechanical pulp) at Saugbrugs has started. ‚Äú - We are receiving excellent feedback from our customers on our containerboard product quality, which is promising for our plan to deliver a total of 760 000 tonnes of packaging paper from Bruck and Golbey into the market in the coming years. Despite declining markets and reduced machine capacities, we are very pleased to have achieved an increased market share with higher sales volumes in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter last year,‚Äù says Geir Drangsland, CEO of Norske Skog. Profit before tax in the quarter was NOK 311 million compared to loss before tax of NOK -382 million in the previous quarter. During the quarter, Norske Skog refinanced the EUR 150 million secured bond with a five-year NOK 1 400 million unsecured bond at a lower interest rate.\n\nThe new thermomechanical production line (TMP) at Norske Skog Skogn AS was officially opened yesterday. This was celebrated with, amongst others, Skogn employees, external companies which have contributed on the project, and the Acting Mayor of Levanger Nina Bakken Bye. Thanks to everyone who attended to celebrate this important milestone with us! A special thanks to Norske Skog Skogn employees and external companies which have been key in order to complete this project on time and within budget! üëè Arild Hegdal (Process Manager), H√•gen Buran (project Manager of the new steam converter) and Roger Mathisen (Project Manager of Switch) have all had vital roles in the realization of the new TMP line üå≤ Key facts about the Switch Project: ¬∑ The new thermomechanical production line (TMP) replaces expensive recycled paper with fresh fibre. ¬∑ More than 70% of the equipment is second-hand, reducing our carbon footprint with approximately 500 tons of CO2, and major cost savings ‚ôª ¬∑ A fossil CO2 reduction of around 80% has been calculated, and the NOx emissions will be reduced by around 40%. The ash reduction is estimated at around 60% \"As a company, we are concerned about sustainability at every step of the value chain. The vast majority of the equipment is reused from other mills in the industry, which have chosen to close or convert their production. Our skilled employees have seen this opportunity and utilized it to create a very cost-effective project,\" says H√•vard Busklein, Managing Director at Skogn.\n\nNorske Skog plans to enter the pulp market, and will initiate a main study aiming to enter the bleached chemi-thermomechanical pulp (BCTMP) market by starting production at #Norske_Skog_Saugbrugs in Halden. The new #BCTMP line will produce approximately 300,000 tons of competitive pulp to meet the growing demand, especially for products in the packaging market. \" - It is gratifying for equipment suppliers, lenders, wood and other raw materials suppliers, shareholders, and customers that we are investing in and establishing a plant for bleached chemi-thermomechanical pulp at Saugbrugs. But those who have the most reason to rejoice, are our employees at Saugbrugs. This will be the first significant investment at Saugbrugs outside of #publicationpaper in modern times,\" says Norske Skog's CEO Geir Drangsland. Norske Skog Saugbrugs has adequate access to #greenenergy, and thus will continue to deliver products with very low #carbonfootprint. Norske Skog Saugbrugs will continue to be a reliable supplier of SC-publication paper also after the start of BCTMP production. The net investment in BCTMP production will range between NOK 1.5 to 2 billion (EUR 140-180 million). The construction period is expected to last for two years starting in the second half of 2025.\n\n‚ÄúCooperation and partnership is the key to unlock new green products. Two of our partners have recently had a great development and achievements using our CEBICO products,‚Äù says Hugo Harstad, MD at CEBICO. Great honor to CTM Lyng AS, who was awarded the Red Dot Design Award for 2024 in product design for ‚ÄòEvig‚Äô ‚Äì a spotlight in the CircuLine¬Æ-series. CEBICO, which is fully owned by Norske Skog Saugbrugs AS, has delivered biocomposite as a raw material to these CTM Lyng awarded products. Hugo continues: \"CTM Lyng has taken a big leap and commitment to design for circular economy, and we want them definitely on our customer list as their spotlight ‚ÄòEvig‚Äô and other products will definitely be a beacon of sustainability.\" Now CEBICO is also selling biocomposites to Grepi Plast AS and Alfa Discs for their production of disk golf starter-set (commonly known as frisbee). The disk set will be available in stores from May. Raw materials from CEBICO reduces the carbon footprint by 70%. #sustainability #circularity\n\nNorske Skog's Bruck team presented the conversion project #STRATO at the International Munich Paper Symposium #IMPS. On March 19, #EnzoZadra as Managing Director and #KlausEibl as Technical Manager representing the company Norske Skog Bruck, together with Erich Kolmar, one of Bellmer's managing directors, proudly presented the STRATO project at the IMPS in Munich, the extremely successful rebuild of paper machine 3. There were around 380 participants from 25 countries from the paper production, clothing, chemicals, mechanical engineering, electrical automation and engineering. The project success was made possible, among other things, by the extremely close cooperation between all departments and the supplier #Bellmer. The presentation was met with great interest and extremely positive feedback from the symposium participants. In particular, the machine safety concept presented was rated by many as particularly innovative. Special thanks go to to all colleagues involved in the project for their great support. #Packaging #Pulp&Paper #sustainability\n\nH√•kon Vinne, aged 40, has dedicated 8 years to Norske Skog Skogn, currently serving as a logistics coordinator.

Over time, he gained insight into Norske Skog's inner workings and developed a deep appreciation for the company's presence and reputationüíö H√•kon values the camaraderie among his colleagues and cherishes the autonomy he enjoys in his role, preferring it to micromanagement. Looking ahead, he envisions an exciting future for Norske Skog, hopeful that the company will adapt to changing markets while continuing to innovate and produce, even if the products evolve beyond traditional newspapersüå≤"
