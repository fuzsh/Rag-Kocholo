        "text": "I am thrilled to announce the title of my forthcoming book: \"Building in Excellence: The Christian Entrepreneur's Roadmap to Eliminating Confusion and Mastering Integrity While Brand Building.\" The year 2023 has been a journey filled with writing, and this particular book holds a treasury of stories and lessons accumulated over the years, especially in the area of brand building. At the core of my work, lies my unwavering faith in Jesus Christ, who is the foundation upon which I build. \"Building in Excellence\" brings together my Christian faith and my variety of experiences â€”both triumphs and setbacksâ€”encountered in the process of building a brand. Beyond the aesthetics (though important), is the individual, youâ€”the brand builder. Your character, integrity, and community involvement all play pivotal roles in shaping a brand that can truly stand the test of time. \"Building in Excellence\" isn't merely a catchy title; it's not a work borne out of obligation but a labour of love; itâ€™s a testament to my lived experiences. I am eager to share more details soon, but most importantly, I can't wait for it to be in your hands! If you are prepared to break free from the ordinary and sculpt a brand radiating true excellenceâ€”let's have a conversation! Until then, Keep building. #BuildingInExcellence\n\nToo many business owners feel like they are just treading water. That's because they don't have the thing that keeps them riding high, and navigating forward. They don't have a ship. The legend you create - the story people tell about you - is your ship. Your brand is your ship! Your dramatic brand idea is the wind in your sails that keeps you high and dry moving forward. It's not your products, your process, the pain you solve, the jobs you do, your services, quality, or even your benefits. It's the story that makes you dramatically different, attracts interest magnetically, and gets tongues wagging. #theownership #brand #consulting #brandbuilding #brandlegend #wordofmouth\n\nOn TV for free ... how ready are you to promote your business?

It's a day to live creatively, and in business, it's important to keep the spark of creativity alive every day. National Live Creative Day was started in 2016 by Creative Promotional Products in Skokie, Illinois, and the celebration every September 14 became a hit. You can learn more about the day here: https://lnkd.in/dhshHki3 # # # A spark of creativity can come from many places, including a drawing on a cocktail napkin discussed in Chapter 1 of Write Your Business Plan, Second Edition: The business plan for one of the most successful startups ever began with a triangle scrawled on a cocktail napkin. The year was 1971, and Herb Kelleher and Rollin King were formulating their idea for an airline serving Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio. The triangle connecting the cities was their route mapâ€”and the basis of the business plan for Southwest Airlines. # # # Thanks for reading! I appreciate it and I'm glad you're here.

Here's hoping it's still an ok thing to do, if indeed you've got some news to share: We have decided that now's the time to sell Hunter & Coastal Lifestyle Magazine. Five years into this journey of a lifetime, we are truly proud of what we have done. We set out with a bit of a chip on our collective shoulders, rather tired of answering that annoying question of \"Isn't print dead yet?\" Well, we think we have added another convincing exhibit to a growing body of evidence that it's not. That there continues to be an appetite for quality publications in niche segments of the market. Yes - you need to be nimble, run a tight ship and be realistic about the monetary rewards. But then, there's the thrill of finding and sharing stories that might otherwise never be told, the joy of connecting with the community and the unique, tactile pleasure of flipping through the first copy of a new edition hot off the printing presses. The last five years have truly been the journey of a lifetime, with plenty of highs and the occasional lows when we had to dust ourselves off, take a deep breath and just keep going. Like with any great party, we've decided it's time to leave when things are at their humming best. Under the ownership of Nicole Shelley from the Newcastle Weekly, our baby will continue to grow and to flourish and we'll be happily watching on from the sidelines as we leisurely start to figure out what adventure might be next. Merry Christmas and all the best for 2024 everyone! #publishingindustry #magazines #nextchapter #proudmoment #printisnotdead\n\nWhy do many local business owners lack a personal brand? It dawned on me recently while assisting my uncle with his fish farming venture. He clocks in at 5 a.m. and often doesn't leave until 10 or 11 p.m. I know that the physical demands of running a local business like this can leave one mentally drained. After such long days, the priority becomes going home to sleep and recover for the next day, building a personal brand doesn't come to mind at all. What I'm trying to say is that local business owners are so consumed by the day-to-day operations of their business.\n\nAlways nice to see Atellier quoted as a case study in the luxury space. While carrying out some research for a client, I came across the following : \"Considering Gen Alpha is growing up on storybooks (www.atellierstories.com) and educational experiences personalised exactly for them, the expectation for customisation will only become more pronounced in the years ahead. \" Canvas8, \"Personal Worlds\" report. Also, this quote from Pine, in the same report, it's worth sharing: \"Over time, consumers have embraced the mindset of â€˜design everything around me'. Gen Y and Z con- sumers are growing up in an experience economy where we can use digital technology that allows them to revolve the world themselves and customise it. They don't even think about it being any other way â€“ that mindset is imbued within them, from almost the beginning. It's not just personalisation or customisa- tion, but individualisation.\" Joe Pine, author of 'Mass Customization: The New Frontier of Business Competition'\n\nToday I'd like to introduce you to Claudia Witticke. ðŸŒŸ Claudia used to run a local fabric store, giving offline sewing classes and selling fabrics and sewing machines. When the pandemic hit, she had to close her business and she started to offer sewing support online. Claudia could see there was a demand for online sewing classes, but she had never sold a course online, so she joined the very first round of my Launch & Sell program. Despite sometimes feeling scared, she took it step by step and sold 18 spots for her beginner class and 17 spots for her signature offer, making $15K in 10 weeks. ðŸ’ƒ Now Claudia runs a multiple six figure online business and was able to close down her fabric store for good. She is well on her way to 7 figures and she became a bestselling author too! In her own words â€¦ \"Investing in Sigrunâ€™s program was the best business decision I ever made. I made â‚¬15K - money I never expected to make! In one of my following launches, I ended up making as much money in 24 hours as my now-ex-husband made in one year. Bringing my business from offline to online made my annual revenue grow by â‚¬150K. Overall, I made â‚¬200K in my first year of online business.\" If Claudia can do it, then you can do it too! ðŸ‘‰ All you need to do is take action. #BusinessCoachForWomen #LaunchStrategy #LaunchCoach #Launching"
