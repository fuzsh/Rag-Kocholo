        "text": "Skøg Size & Modes\n\nThe SKØG rolls on 16” wheels and is the largest bike (at present!) in the Black Mountain EPOK range and is aimed at children around 4.5 years up, fitting those in the 102cm to 121cm height range, or until they are around 7 years old (depending on growth rate.) The SKØG can be ridden by taller or more confident riders as young as 4 year olds, starting off in balance bike mode, allowing them to gain confidence on the bike. Please use our sizing tool here to work out if the SKØG is right for your child based on their ability and height.\n\nThe SKØG really is three bikes in one – replacing a separate balance bike, and two conventional 14” and 16” bikes.\n\nMODE 1\n\nThe SKØG starts life as a small lightweight balance bike, which is ideal for your child to learn on. This offers them the chance to gain confidence, getting used to the bike’s geometry, brakes and riding position before they transfer to the first pedal bike mode (we recommend running the bike in this mode for a while, even if your child can already ride, as it’s such a great way to allow them to get used to our bike’s responsive steering and brakes).\n\nMODE 2\n\nWhen ready, you simply install the included PowerPack – our neat upgrade that brings into play the cranks, pedals and our unique lightweight, oil free drive belt, transforming the balance bike into a small pedal bike. The small frame with a short wheelbase and ‘reach’, low saddle height and easy low geared pedalling allows the SKØG in this mode to be more like a conventional 14” bike, so smaller riders can get on the bike safely and easily, and earlier than with a normal bike.\n\nMODE 3\n\nThen as your child grows in size and confidence, you simply adjust the UP:SCALE frame and IN:GEAR system (see here for how this works) to transform the SKOG into a large pedal bike, which increases the frame size and gearing by about 20%, making the most of the easy rolling 16” wheel size, and lasting your child for longer."
