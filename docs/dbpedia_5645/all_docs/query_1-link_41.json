        "text": "Guidelines for Charles Sturt University Foundation Trust\n\nThe Charles Sturt University Foundation Trust distributes more than 300 student scholarships every year. These scholarships are funded by individuals and organisations who strongly believe in supporting Charles Sturt University and its students.\n\nWho can apply\n\nAny Australian/New Zealand citizen or Australian permanent resident who has applied for admission to Charles Sturt University or who is enrolled in a Charles Sturt course. Both on campus and online students are eligible unless otherwise stated in individual scholarship criteria\n\nAny international students who are classified as an international student in Australia with either a full unconditional offer from Charles Sturt to study in Australia or continuing enrolment as a full-time student at a Charles Sturt University campus. The exemption is scholarships involving work placement due to citizenship requirements for work purposes.\n\nWho cannot apply\n\nInternational students studying in their home country, online or at a partnership institution.\n\nHow are applications assessed?\n\nApplicants must read scholarship criteria carefully before applying as scholarships are awarded based on the criteria for each scholarship.\n\nSuccessful applicants are selected after a series of shortlisting processes, including a review by Charles Sturt staff and donors.\n\nFrom the final shortlist of strong applicants, it is up to the donor to determine the scholarship recipient(s). Sometimes this process will include donors interviewing the strongest candidates.\n\nConditions of scholarship\n\nIf you are a recipient of a Foundation Trust scholarship, you must write a thank you letter to the donor. Email your letter to the CSU Foundation Trust scholarship office at advancement@csu.edu.au we will forward your letter onto the respective donor/s.\n\nHow will my scholarship be paid?\n\nMost scholarships valued at $5000 or less are paid in full, unless otherwise specified. Check the scholarship webpage for payment details.\n\nOngoing scholarship payments are subject to you maintaining satisfactory academic progress and continued enrolment in your course. If these conditions are not met, scholarships may be suspended or terminated.\n\nCan my scholarship be suspended or terminated?\n\nYes, if you fail to meet the criteria for your scholarship.\n\nSuspension may occur if you fail to maintain the GPA specified in the scholarship criteria.\n\nSuspension or termination of a scholarship will occur if you are excluded from your course. The scholarship may be reinstated if you resume your studies following an exclusion of no longer than one year.\n\nScholarships will also be terminated if the recipient transfers to another university or place of study. In some instances you maybe required to repay the scholarship amount to the donor via the Charles Sturt University Foundation Trust.\n\nCan I apply for an Approved Leave of Absence (LOA)?\n\nIn some circumstances, you may be granted a leave of absence which places your tenured scholarship on hold until you return to study, up to a period of 12 months.\n\nAny request for a leave of absence must be made in writing to the Charles Sturt University Foundation Trust Scholarship Office stating the expected date of return to study. Following re-enrolment, you must advise your return to study to re-activate your scholarship.\n\nThe decision to allow a scholarship to be placed on hold is entirely at the discretion of Charles Sturt University.\n\nIf the leave of absence is to be for more than 12 months you do not return to study, the scholarship will be terminated.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nTips on applying for a scholarship\n\nFor more read the information provided on the How to Apply tab on each scholarship\n\nAm I eligible to receive more than one Charles Sturt University scholarship?\n\nIn most cases students are only eligible to receive one Charles Sturt University Foundation scholarship each year.\n\nStudents who are recipients an on-going scholarship that is still current are not eligible to apply for further scholarships during the tenure of their awarded scholarship.\n\nHow do I apply for a scholarship that has financial hardship as criteria?\n\nDemonstrate financial hardship by providing\n\na Centrelink Income Statement (within the last 45 days) or\n\nYour last 3 payslips or\n\noutline your financial need in the 'Additional Financial Information' free text box in application.\n\nWhen will I be notified of my applications outcome?\n\nScholarships are assessed by Charles Sturt Scholarship & Financial Support Services once applications have closed.

If your application is successful, you may be asked to provide the original of your HSC ATAR results.\n\nWhat relevance does my Grade Point Average have when applying for scholarships?\n\nMost scholarships will have a minimum requirement of a 4.0 GPA as part of the eligibility criteria. This signifies a 'passing'grade poiknt average in your degree.\n\nYour GPA can be found by following the 'personal details' link under Administration.
