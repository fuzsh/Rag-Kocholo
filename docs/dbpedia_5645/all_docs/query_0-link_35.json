        "text": "The project was executed in phases where each phase involved improving selected elements of Skogn's production system. Examples of elements in a production system can include meeting structure, role descriptions, KPI structure, health, safety and environment (HSE) or 5S for workplace organization, among others. The order for analyzing and implementing the elements is often determined based on estimated improvement potential, as well as the ability to rapidly realize visible changes for our employees.\n\nA prioritized element in the project was to establish clear function and role descriptions for the employees in production. The purpose was to optimize resource use by clarifying expectations for each role and associated areas of responsibility, as well as to avoid overlapping responsibilities or gaps between roles. Responsible, accountable, consulted, informed (RACI) matrices were introduced as a tool to ensure efficient responsibility distribution in tasks that historically had proven to be challenging. To address the challenges of too many, prolonged and unstructured meetings that did not deliver desired results, the current meeting structure was revitalized through the project. The new structure significantly reduced the duration of meetings through meeting description templates and action lists, leading to action-oriented meetings and a higher degree of organized follow-up. Initial analyses identified a need for increased structure in parts of the factory.\n\n5S is a tool that immediately provides visible results. This helps to create trust in the project among the operators on the shop floor. Therefore, it was prioritized to introduce 5S solutions early in the project. \"Employees reported that tasks took longer than necessary because they had to spend time looking for equipment. It was, therefore, important for us to establish a good system, and 5S was introduced as part of the project. Equipment and parts were reviewed, and everything was given a fixed place with clear marking. Employees have subsequently reported that this was also an important step for workplace satisfaction\" opined Anders Laugen, Operations Manager at Norske Skog Skogn and responsible for the largest pilot area during the project.\n\nTo strengthen the link between the factory's overall goals and the individual employee's actions, a comprehensive goal management system was designed. This system involved an overview with so-called leading and lagging KPIs for all roles, from managers to operators, which provides employees with insight and support for decision-making processes.\n\nEY | Assurance | Tax | Transactions | Advisory\n\nAbout EY\n\nEY is a global leader in assurance, tax, transaction and advisory services.
