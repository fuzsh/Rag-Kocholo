        "text": "Among others, important representatives from federal and state politics, society and the press were invited to the official opening on June 22. With 210,000 t of sustainable packaging paper per year and biogas generation, the rebuild is considered a showcase project in the field of sustainability and modernization. Christopher Drexler speaks of a forward-looking project. “In total, an exemplary case, we can only congratulate Norske Skog and all responsible parties!“ says the governor of Styria. The containerboard products for corrugated board production will be marketed under the new brand name “Strato”.\n\nAn ambitious rebuild to shape our future\n\nDuring the rebuild phase, in addition to the site’s approximately 450 employees, another 500 craftsmen and specialists were working simultaneously at the company to meet the ambitious project schedule and enable the plant to restart on schedule. “It’s the transformation of a generation project, so to speak. And we got off to a sensational start with it right away,” continues Managing Director Enzo Zadra.\n\n120 million euros were invested in the rebuild of the 70-year-old newspaper machine, a waste paper treatment plant and biogas plant. This has opened up a completely new chapter in production. The new PM3 produces 600 tons of new packaging paper daily from 650 tons of recovered board. This makes the line highly efficient “We produce 100% sustainable recyclable packaging paper,” emphasizes Enzo Zadra. The new waste paper preparation plant built by Bellmer also plays an important role in this. The completely new stock preparation system and the rebuild of the approach flow system support the energy-efficient concept.\n\nREBUILD OF THE WIRE SECTION AND FORMER\n\nThe recently installed TurboFormer is a first-class hybrid former that offers the best formation and increases the capacity in the forming section of the paper machine.\n\nREBUILD OF THE PRESS SECTION WITH INSTALLATION OF A SHOE PRESS TURBOPRESS XL\n\nThe „XL“ module is the most powerful shoe module, capable of handling the highest loads and speeds while ensuring efficient dewatering and formation. The module is equipped with a hydrostatically mounted TurboRoll SZ counter roll. The TurboRoll EN, on the other hand, is equipped with a unique and patented shoe loading and lubrication system that ensures correct and even loading across the entire width.\n\nMODIFICATION OF THE PRE- AND POST-DRYING SECTION\n\nEfficient drying is guaranteed with the new TurboDryer drying cylinders in the first drying group. The stock has been optimally utilised and energy consumption in the drying section has been reduced as much as possible. The steam-heated TurboDryer cylinders are made of cast iron. The new hood from Bellmer for sustainable energy recovery, in conjunction with the energy-efficient steam and condensate system, rounds off the sustainable energy concept of the Norske Skog Bruck production plant.\n\nTURBOFILM SIZER WITH AIRTURN\n\nThe new TurboFilm Sizer ensures the best quality in paper sizing and pre-coating. It is complemented by the new Bellmer starch unit.\n\nPOPEREELER TURBOREELER\n\nRoll diameters up to over 4 metres (max. 3.2 metres in Bruck) can be wound with the TurboReeler without interruption. It is also equipped with the BellDur winding hardness control system and BellCheck diagnostic system.\n\nAUTOMATIC TRANSPORT SYSTEM TURBO TRANSPORTER PRO\n\nThe transporter guarantees safe, even and efficient transport of the jumbo rolls to the winder.\n\nTURBOWINDER\n\nThe team at Norske Skog opted for a TurboWinder to not only fully optimise the winding and unwinding process, but also to ensure the best quality of the finished rolls.\n\nThe fully automated finishing group consisting of TurboReeler, TurboTransporter and TurboWinder also benefits work safety and efficiency. The TurboReeler and the complete final group concept were customised and manufactured in Germany.\n\nNew pulpers under the press section, sizer, reeler and winder round off the scope of delivery for the STRATO project.\n\nAbout Norske Skog\n\nThe Norske Skog Bruck site was founded in 1881 and today employs around 450 people. In the past four years, a total of around 200 million euros has been invested in the conversion of paper production and future-oriented energy facilities. In addition, a power plant for regional substitute fuels has been commissioned, reducing dependence on fossil natural gas and at the same time cutting fossil CO2 emissions by three quarters. At the same time, the greater Bruck area is supplied with district heating."
