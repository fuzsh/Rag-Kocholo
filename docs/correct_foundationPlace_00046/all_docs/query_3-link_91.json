        "text": "Soon after the mixed martial arts world learned that Ilima-Lei Macfarlane missed weight for one of the signature fights of her career â one that offered her a chance to go out with a title â Hawaiiâs preeminent female fighter took to social media to express contrition.\n\nMacfarlane, who officially weighed in at 126.6 pounds Friday for her 125-pound flyweight world title triple-main event at Bellator 300, lauded her opponent and good friend Liz Carmouche, the reigning champion in the division. Carmouche, who weighed in at 124.8 pounds, chose to keep the San Diego fight, which means that if Macfarlane were to win on Saturday against her old training partner, the belt would be vacated.\n\nâFirst person I told when I knew I was going to miss weight and what did she say? She said she loves me wants me to be healthy and asked if I wanted to use her sauna,â Macfarlane, a Punahou School graduate, wrote in an Instagram post, adding a crying emoji. âWords can express how much this person means to me or what an absolute gangster she is for still taking this fight despite me (messing) it up. Weâve been through hell and back together and can say without a doubt she is my sister wife for life.â\n\nMacfarlane (13-2) edged Kana Watanabe via split decision at the Blaisdell Arena in April to set up what she described at the time as a dream fight to cap her career â a chance to reclaim the flyweight belt she lost in December 2020, and against one of her best friends. But Macfarlane, an underdog for this fight, missed weight three times on Friday, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported.\n\nThe main card will still take place at 4 p.m. Hawaii time at Pechanga Arena and be televised live on Showtime.\n\nWhen the Aug. 8 wildfires on Maui devastated the town of Lahaina, Macfarlane was one of the first people to set up a fundraiser for Lahaina families through her Na Wahine Toa Foundation. It garnered huge attention as donations poured in, reaching more than $2.6 million.\n\nCivil Beat reported in September that Macfarlane entrusted the money to Maui-based activist Tiare Lawrence, and that Meta, the parent company of Instagram, had yet to release the funds. Accusations of impropriety followed.\n\nMacfarlane wrote in an Instagram post on Aug. 29 that she had been âtrying to respond to a lot of messages and accusations with compassion, but sistah is exhausted.â\n\nIt is unclear if Macfarlane will attempt to fight again after Saturday; she acknowledged after the Watanabe fight that this fight is set up to be the last of her career.\n\nIn the undercard of Bellator 300, Hawaii's Kai Kamaka III takes on Henry Corrales in a featherweight bout. The undercard begins at 12:30 p.m. Hawaii time."
