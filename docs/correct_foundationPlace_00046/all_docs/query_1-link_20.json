His late father, who was of mixed African American heritage, and his mother, who is South Korean, were frequent targets of racism and discrimination in South Korea and the U.S. He was the first in his multiracial family to attend college right out of high school but felt unsure that he belonged, a fear common to many first-generation community college students. He stepped out of college after a year to enlist in the U.S. Army, but following his military service reenrolled in college and successfully earned a degree.\n\nBefore assuming leadership of Shoreline, Lambert served as its vice president for human resources and legal affairs, a position secured after serving close to five years in successively responsible roles in human resources at Centralia College in Washington where he negotiated contracts, developed management training programs, and advocated for diversity and inclusion in hiring practices.\n\nHis first senior executive position in higher education was special assistant to the president for civil rights and legal affairs at The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, where he was responsible for diversity training, conducting investigations, and building a culture of respect for the diverse academic, socioeconomic, ethnic, religious, and cultural backgrounds, disabilities, and sexual orientations of students, faculty, and staff.\n\nLambert holds a bachelor’s degree in liberal arts from The Evergreen State College and a juris doctor from Seattle University. He has taught as an adjunct faculty member at The Evergreen State College and Centralia College.\n\nBesides his professional experience, Lambert has taken on leadership roles on local, state, and national boards and committees, including Credential Engine, National Association of Workforce Boards, National Coalition of Certification Centers, Arizona Chamber of Commerce, and the Southern Arizona Leadership Council.\n\nLambert has also been the recipient of many awards during his years of community college service.

Dr. Whalen is a passionate leader of equity-advancing initiatives, most notably furthering the advancement of Guided Pathways and serving on several advisories and task forces for equity and anti-racism.\n\nDr. Whalen has developed a special commitment to using data-informed practices to improve the student experience. She has worked locally, regionally, and throughout California to foster leadership development that can manage and guide student success initiatives. Kristina’s years of argumentation and debate training around social justice and equity issues have led to an affinity for data literacy and storytelling. She strives to bring those affinities to collaborative problem-solving and institutional effectiveness in the service of students.\n\nHer earlier administrative service included working as an instructional dean for Fine, Applied, and Communication Arts at the Fort Mason Campus in San Francisco and serving as a department chair for five years.
