        "text": "Fundamental Resources and Values\n\nFundamental resources and values are the most important elements, ideas, or concepts to be communicated to the public about a park unit. They warrant primary consideration during planning and management because they are critical to achieving the park’s purpose and maintaining its significance. They provide a valuable focus throughout the planning process and the life of the plan and may include systems, processes, features, visitor experiences, stories, scenes, sounds, or other resources and values. They are the reasons for data collection, planning issues, management prescriptions, impact assessments, and value analyses.\n\nPatients\n\nThe patients past and present, represented through their stories, traditions, and memorabilia, are some of the park’s most valuable resources. Their presence at Kalaupapa can be experienced through the physical resources that remind us of them and the intangible feelings of their presence and spirit that impart a sense of sacredness to Kalaupapa. The stories of ʻohana who were left behind are equally compelling and offer lessons in forgiveness, love, hope, inspiration, and the perseverance of human spirit.\n\nKamaʻāina\n\nIn this context, kamaʻāina were the original native Hawaiian inhabitants of Kalaupapa prior to the Hansen’s disease era. The kamaʻāina story is represented throughout the archeological resources and cultural landscapes by the wahi pana (storied places), wahi kapu (sacred sites) and the physical remains and material culture left on the landscape. Due to its physical isolation and lack of modern development on the peninsula, Kalaupapa is one of the most intact archeological complexes in Hawai‘i.\n\nSaint Damien, Saint Marianne, Brother Dutton, and Kōkua (patient helpers) – Their Work with Hansen’s Disease Patients\n\nThe renowned work by Saint Damien de Veuster, Saint Marianne Cope, Brother Dutton, Jonathan Napela, and Ambrose Hutchison, and other kokua to care for those afflicted with Hansen’s disease are represented in stories, museum collections, and sites and structures at Kalaupapa (such as St. Philo- mena Church and cemetery, Bishop Home for Girls, Baldwin Home for Boys, Saint Damien’s gravesite and monuments, Gravesite of Saint Marianne, and Gravesite of Brother Dutton).\n\nStories, Oral Histories, and Mana\n\nPreserving and sharing the stories of those who lived, died, and are buried at Kalaupapa, also preserves their spirits, adding depth and dimension to the greater story to be told. The pervading presence of spirits can be felt and wit- nessed by visitors and residents alike and are a testament to the special sacred- ness and mana of Kalaupapa.\n\nNative Hawaiian Traditional Cultural Use\n\nThe park supports Native Hawaiian practices for perpetuating traditional knowledge, practicing mālama ʻāina — sound resource management principles — and strengthening cultural and spiritual connections to Kalaupapa.\n\nHistoric Buildings, Structures, Cultural Landscape, and Archeological Features Associated with the Hansen’s Disease Settlement\n\nKalaupapa NHP includes historic buildings, structures, cultural landscapes and archeological features associated with the Hansen’s disease settlement dating from 1869 to the present, most of which contribute to the Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement National Historic Landmark.\n\nMuseum Collections\n\nThe park maintains over 200,000 museum objects and archival materials that document Kalaupapa’s culture, history, and natural resources.\n\nEducational Values\n\nThe park provides opportunities to learn and be inspired by Kalaupapa’s Hawaiian history, the Hansen’s disease patients’ experiences, and Kalaupapa’s range of resources, all of which add to the body of medical, social science, and Hawai‘i’s ecological research. The park provides extensive opportunities for collaborative management efforts and future research opportunities.\n\nGeological Features and Unobstructed Viewshed\n\nThe scenic North Shore Cliffs are designated as a national natural landmark. The cliffs provide evidence of the massive landslide that spread underwater nearly 100 miles northward and shaped the island of Molokai. The peninsula from Kauhakō Crater Lake (one of the deepest volcanically formed lakes in the world) to lava caves provides evidence of the volcanic eruption that formed Kalaupapa approximately 300,000 years ago. The unobstructed viewshed includes sweeping panoramic views from the steep cliffs to the settlement and the majestic Pacific Ocean beyond.\n\nSoundscapes and Dark Night Skies\n\nThe general ambient quiet and the presence of dark night skies maintain Kalau- papa’s sense of place, historic setting, and feeling of isolation.\n\nTerrestrial Ecosystem\n\nKalaupapa NHP’s montane wet forest, coastal salt spray/strand vegetation, and remnant dryland forest are outstanding elements that form the terrestrial eco- system. The montane wet forest within the Puʻu Aliʻi Natural Area Reserve has received the State of Hawai‘i’s highest conservation designation. The coastal spray/strand community along the east coast of the Kalaupapa peninsula is considered the best in all of Hawai‘i by virtue of its lack of development. While the dryland forest on the rim of the Kauhakō Crater is in poor condition, it is considered the last remnant of a low elevation windward dryland forest. Two offshore islets (ʻŌkala and Huelo) are designated Sea Bird Sanctuaries and also serve as a source of rare plant propagules for restoration activities.\n\nMarine Ecosystem\n\nThe park contains a moderate diversity of marine species, some of which are rare in the main Hawaiian Islands, including one of the most active pupping areas for endangered Monk seals (īlio holo i ka uaua). The algae (limu), corals (ko‘ako‘a), and other invertebrates are mostly intact with few invasive species. The nearshore fish communities are some of the healthiest in the main Hawai- ian Islands with high biomass and a full complement of predators and other trophic groups. The park is one of the most spectacular examples in Hawaiʻi of a large underwater volcanic boulder habitat, providing refuge and spawning areas for the abundant reef life.\n\nWaikolu Stream\n\nThe perennial Waikolu Stream, eligible for wild and scenic river designation, is one of the few remaining freshwater streams in Hawaiʻi supporting all five of the endemic freshwater fish and associated invertebrate species.\n\nOther Important Resources and Values\n\nMolokai Light Station National Register District\n\nThe Molokai Light Station Historic District includes the 138-foot lighthouse listed in the National Register of Historic Places and its period of significnce spans the time period between 1908 and 1957. It is significant for its architec- ture and association with maritime history, transportation, commerce, and social history.\n\nSpecial Mandates and Administrative Commitments\n\nThis section describes the unique management structure of Kalaupapa National Historical Park and includes information about management authority, jurisdiction, landownership, designations and protected areas, special mandates, and cooperative agreements.\n\nManagement Authority and Jurisdiction\n\nKalaupapa National Historical Park differs significantly from most other national parks in that almost all of the 8,720 acres of land, 2,060 acres of submerged and offshore lands, and improvements within the authorized boundary may remain in nonfederal ownership to be managed by the National Park Service through cooperative agreements. This section describes landownership, special designations and protected areas within the park, special mandates, and cooperative agreements that are unique to Kalaupapa National Historical Park.\n\nLandownership\n\nThe National Park Service (NPS) owns 22.88 acres in which the light house, as well as the Molokai Light Station, two historic houses, and four outbuildings are located.\n\nThe Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL) owns 1,290 acres within the park boundary. The current 50-year lease between the National Park Service and the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (which could be renewed in 2041) encumbers only the 1,247-acre parcel and does not include the 43 acres at Pālāʻau State Park, which lies outside of Kalawao County.\n\nThe Hawaiʻi Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) owns 9,394 acres within the park. The National Park Service has a cooperative agreement with the Department of Land and Natural Resources to administer some of these lands. Most Department of Land and Natural Resources land is zoned Conservation — with 1,541 acres in the Molokai Forest Reserve (not administered by the National Park Service) and 2,060 acres of submerged and offshore lands including 60 acres surrounding Nihoa. The application of the Conservation zone indicates that the state has imposed development restrictions on the land to conserve, protect, or preserve important natural resources in those areas.\n\nThe Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation (DOT) owns 42.2 acres at the tip of the peninsula. This area encompasses the airport runway and adjacent lands. The Department of Transportation owns the structures at the airport facility including the terminal and three storage/maintenance buildings.\n\nR. W. Meyer, Ltd., owns 72 acres at the top of the pali east of Pālāʻau State Park.\n\nDesignations and Protected Areas\n\nWithin Kalaupapa National Historic Park are a number or geographical areas that have special designations and are administered by different agencies. These areas are listed in the following table and described in detail in this section.\n\nDesignations and Protected Areas in Kalaupapa National Historical Park Designation Date Designator Total Area of Designation (acres) Area of Designation Within Park (acres) Molokai Forest Reserve 1903 Territorial Government of Hawai'i 1,541 1,541 National Natural Landmark 1972 Secretary of the Interior 27,100 5,085 National Historic Landmark 1976 Secretary of the Interior 15,645 10,674 Seabird Sanctuaries on 'Ōkala and Huelo Islands 1981 State of Hawai'i, DLNR 9 9 Pu'u Ali'i Natural Area Reserve 1985 State of Hawai'i, Governor 1,330 1,330\n\nMolokai Forest Reserve\n\nThe Forest Reserve System was created by the Territorial Government of Hawai‘i through Act 44 on April 25, 1903. With Hawai‘i’s increase in population, expanding ranching industry, and extensive agricultural production of sugarcane and later pineapple, early territorial foresters recognized the need to protect uka (upland) forests to provide the necessary water requirements for the lowland agricultural demands and surrounding communities. Within Kalawao County, approximately 1,541 acres contain the uka areas of the ahupuaʻa of Makanalua and Kalawao and are designated as Molokai Forest Reserve. The Forest Reserve is located above the 500-foot contour and serves as a public hunting area. With its inception, the Forest Reserve System represented a public-private partnership to protect and enhance important forested uka lands for their abundance of public benefits and values. Today the tradition is carried on by the Department of Land and Natural Resources, Division of Forestry and Wildlife (DOFAW) for public Forest Reserve lands. The Division of Forestry and Wildlife focuses its resources to protect, manage, restore, and monitor the natural resources of the Forest Reserve System.\n\nNational Natural Landmark\n\nThe North Shore Cliffs were designated a National Natural Landmark in December 1972. The landmark includes 27,100 acres located along 17 miles of the northeast coast between the villages of Kalaupapa and Halawa. Approximately, one fifth (5,085 acres) of the landmark is located within Kalaupapa National Historical Park. The North Shore Cliffs represent the major episode of volcanism that created Molokai, which is among the most ancient in the Hawaiian Island chain. The North Shore Cliffs and adjacent valleys and uplands are “scenically majestic and scientifically important. The physical features of Molokai, including the North Shore Cliffs, are considered to be of prime importance to geologists in piecing together the story of how the Hawaiian Islands were formed.”\n\nNational Historic Landmark\n\nOn January 7, 1976, the “Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement” was designated a National Historic Landmark and subsequently listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NR #76002415). It includes 15,645 acres of land and waters, an area significantly larger than the boundary of Kalaupapa National Historic Park. The national historic landmark has a marine boundary that extends 0.93 miles offshore to include Mōkapu Island creating a marine area of 7,031 acres, approximately 4,971 acres larger than current park marine area of 2,060 acres.\n\nThe Kalaupapa and Kalawao settlements are historically significant as the first Hansen’s disease (leprosy) colony in American history. The national historic landmark nomination identifies the areas of significance for the settlement as prehistoric archeology, historic archeology, architecture, community planning, religion, and social/humanitarian activity. The period of significance begins in 1866 when the first people afflicted with Hansen’s disease arrived at Kalaupapa and continues to the present.\n\nIn 2004, a condition update for the National Historic Landmark Program determined the status of the Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement National Historic Landmark as “Threatened” due to pest infestations impacting historic structures, deferred maintenance, and lack of funding to maintain the numerous physical resources that contribute to its significance.\n\nAn update to the national historic landmark nomination for the settlement is in progress.\n\nSeabird Sanctuaries\n\nOn April 30, 1981, the State of Hawai‘i Department of Land and Natural Resources amended its rules regulating wildlife sanctuaries to include ‘Ōkala and Huelo Islands, located offshore of Waikolu Valley, Kalawao, Molokai. The purpose of the rules is to conserve, manage, and protect indigenous wildlife in sanctuaries. These rules include prohibited entry, landing, etc., and the removal, disturbance, injury, killing, or possession of any form of plant or wildlife (Department of Land and Natural Resources, Title 13, Subtitle 5, Part 2, Capture 125).\n\nPu‘u Ali‘i Natural Area Reserve\n\nHawaiʻi’s natural resources include geological and volcanological features and distinctive marine and terrestrial plants and animals, many of which occur nowhere else in the world.\n\nIn 1970, the Hawaiʻi State Legislature expressed the need to protect and preserve the state’s unique natural resources, both for the enjoyment of future generations and to provide baseline data to evaluate the impact of environmental changes occurring in the state. The statewide Natural Area Reserve System was therefore established to preserve in perpetuity specific land and water areas that support relatively unmodified communities of natural flora and fauna,\n\nas well as geological sites. The Natural Area Reserves System is administered by the State of Hawaiʻi, Department of Land and Natural Resources, Division of Forestry and Wildlife. The system presently consists of 19 reserves on five islands, encompassing more than 109,000 acres of the state›s most unique ecosystems. One of these areas, Pu‘u Ali‘i, is located within Kalaupapa National Historical Park.\n\nThe Pu‘u Ali‘i Natural Area Reserve, established in 1985, encompasses 1,330 acres in the southeast corner of the park between Pelekunu and Waikolu Valleys. Elevations in the reserve range from 2,250 feet at the top of the sea cliffs on the northern edge to 4,222 feet at the summit of Pu‘u Ali‘i. The Pu‘u Ali‘i NAR is divided into two management units— the North and South Units. The South Unit is fenced and encloses approximately 640 acres in the higher elevation part of the reserve, whereas the North Unit is protected by two strategic fences making up the remaining 690 acres in the lower part of the reserve. The reserve is bordered on the south by the Kamakou Preserve, which is managed by the Nature Conservancy.\n\nSpecial Mandates\n\nAdministration\n\nWith the approval of the owner, the Secretary of the Interior may undertake critical or emergency stabilization of utilities and historic structures, develop and occupy temporary office space, and conduct interim interpretative and visitor services on nonfederal property within the park. The original intent of this statement was to provide the NPS with the interim authority to spend federal funds until cooperative agreements were approved (Public Law 96- 565, Sec. 105, December 22, 1980).\n\nAuthorization of Appropriated Funds\n\nEffective October 1, 1981, there are hereby authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this title but not to exceed $2,500,000 for acquisition of lands and interests in lands and $1,000,000 for development (Public Law 96-565, Sec. 110, December 22, 1980).\n\nHawaiʻi Department of Health\n\nPursuant to HRS §326-34b, the county of Kalawao is governed by the Hawaiʻi State Department of Health, including those specific regulations relating to the care and treatment of persons affected with Hansen’s disease, except as otherwise provided by law. Cooperative Agreement CA8896-4-0001, Modification: 0001, dated March 30, 1984 and extended April 1, 2004 for 20 years.\n\nHansen’s Disease Patients\n\nHealth care for the patients shall continue to be provided by the State of Hawaiʻi, with assistance from federal programs other than those authorized herein. Patients shall continue to have the right to take and utilize fish and wildlife resources without regard to federal fish and game laws and regulations. Patients shall continue to have the right to take and utilize plant and other natural resources for traditional purposes in accordance with applicable state and federal laws (Public Law 96-565, Sec. 106, December 22, 1980).\n\nKalaupapa Memorial\n\nThe Secretary of the Interior shall authorize Ka ‘Ohana O Kalaupapa, a nonprofit organization consisting of patient residents at Kalaupapa National Historical Park and their family members and friends, to establish a memorial at a suitable location or locations approved by the Secretary at Kalawao or Kalaupapa within the boundaries of Kalaupapa National Historical Park to honor and perpetuate the memory of those individuals who were forcibly relocated to the Kalaupapa peninsula from 1866 to 1969 (H.R.410 Kalaupapa Memorial Act 2009).\n\nKalaupapa National Historical Park Advisory Commission\n\nThe Kalaupapa National Historical Park Advisory Commission was established on December 22, 1980, for a duration of 45 years (Public Law 96-565, Sec. 108, December 22, 1980, Public Law 109-54. Sec. 128, August 2, 2005).\n\nLand Acquisition\n\nLands owned by the State of Hawai‘i or a political subdivision can be acquired by the Secretary of the Interior only through donation or exchange and only with the consent of the owner.\n\nPrivately owned lands within the boundary of the park can be acquired by the Secretary of the Interior by donation, purchase with donated or appropriated funds, or exchange. The Secretary of the Interior can acquire lands, waters, and interests by any methods, except by condemnation, within the State of Hawaiʻi for the conveyance and exchange of lands,\n\nwaters, and interests within the Kalaupapa National Historical Park boundary owned by the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (Public Law 96–565, Sec. 104, December 22, 1980).\n\nLand Lease from Hawaiian Home Lands\n\nPursuant to Public Law 100-202, dated December 22, 1987, on September 22, 1992, the National Park Service entered into a lease for 1,247 acres with the State of Hawaiʻi, Department of Hawaiian Home Lands for 50 years beginning on July 15, 1991, to July 14, 2041. The current lease agreement only covers land within Kalawao county and does not include the 43 acres at Pālā‘au State Park. The leased area contains the western part of the peninsula, including the entire Kalaupapa Settlement, sea cliffs, and trail to topside. The National Park Service is obligated to pay rent annually for use and operations on the premises (General Lease No. 231, September 22, 1992, Tax Map Key No. 6-1-01:01).\n\nPatient and Native Hawaiian Staffing\n\nPreservation and interpretation of the settlement will be managed and performed by patients and native Hawaiians to the extent practical. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary shall give first preference to qualified patients and native Hawaiians in making appointments to positions established for the administration of the park, and the appointment of patients and native Hawaiians shall be without regard to any provision of the federal civil service laws. The Secretary shall provide patients a first right of refusal to provide revenue–producing visitor services, including such services as providing food, accommodations, transportation, tours, and guides. In its lease with the National Park Service, The Department of Hawaiian Home Lands has reserved the authority to give native Hawaiians a “second right of refusal” to provide revenue-producing visitor services for the areas of the park covered by the lease. Training opportunities shall be provided to patients and native Hawaiians in management and interpretation of the settlement’s culture, historical, educational, and scenic resources (Public Law 96-565, Secs. 102, 107, December 22, 1980; General Lease No. 231, September 22, 1992).\n\nPatient Community\n\nThe Kalaupapa Hansen’s disease patients are guaranteed a well-maintained community, and they may remain at Kalaupapa for as long as they wish. The current lifestyle of these patients and their individual privacy will be protected (Public Law 96–565, sec. 102, December 22, 1980).\n\nReevaluation of Policies\n\nWhen there is no longer a resident patient community at Kalaupapa, the Secretary of the Interior shall reevaluate the policies governing the management, administration, and public use of the park in order to identify any changes deemed appropriate (Public Law 96–565, sec. 109, December 22, 1980).\n\nReligious Structures\n\nThe Secretary may stabilize and rehabilitate structures and other properties used for religious or sectarian purposes only if such properties constitute a substantial and integral part of the historical fabric of the Kalaupapa Settlement and only to the extent necessary and appropriate to interpret adequately the nationally significant historical features and events of the settlement for the benefit of the public (Public Law 96–565, sec. 105, December 22, 1980).\n\nVisitation\n\nKalaupapa National Historical Park will provide for limited visitation by the general public. So long as the patients may direct, the Secretary of the Interior shall not permit public visitation to the settlement in excess of 100 persons in any one day (Public Law 96–565, secs. 102, 106, December 22, 1980).\n\nU.S. Coast Guard\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Coast Guard transferred 23 acres around the Molokai Light Station to the National Park Service. In 2006, the U.S. Coast Guard transferred the Molokai Light Station to the National Park Service, under the General Services Administration, but the U.S. Coast Guard continues to maintain the lens within the lighthouse and the historic lens.\n\nLong-Term Agreements\n\nThe Secretary of the Interior shall seek and may enter into cooperative agreements with the owners of property within the park pursuant to which the Secretary may preserve, protect, maintain, construct, reconstruct, develop, improve, and interpret sites, facilities, and resources of historic, natural, architectural, and cultural significance. Cooperative agreements shall be\n\nof not less than 20 years duration and may be extended and amended by mutual agreement. Cooperative agreements shall include, without limitation, provisions that the Secretary shall have the right of access at reasonable times to public parts of the property for interpretive and other purposes. No changes or alterations shall be made in the property except by mutual agreement (Public Law 96–565, sec. 105, December 22, 1980).\n\nEach agreement shall provide that the owner shall be liable to the United States in an amount equal to the fair market value of any capital improvements made to or placed on the property in the event the agreement is terminated prior to its natural expiration or any extension thereof. The Secretary is permitted to remove such capital improvements within a reasonable time of termination of the cooperative agreement. Upon expiration of the agreement, the\n\nimprovements thereon shall become the property of the owner, unless the United States desires to remove such capital improvements and restore the property to its natural state within a reasonable time for such expiration. Except for emergency, temporary, and interim activity, no funds shall be expended on nonfederal property unless such expenditure is pursuant to a cooperative agreement with the owner (Public Law 96–565, sec. 105, December 22, 1980). The lease and agreements are shown in the table below.\n\nLong-term Lease, Agreements, and Memorandum of Understanding, Kalaupapa National Historical Park Partner Instrument Effective Term Term (years) State of Hawai'i Department of Hawaiian Home Lands General Lease July 15, 1991-July 14, 2041 50 Hawai'i Conference Foundation Cooperative Agreement Set. 27, 2003-Sept. 26, 2023 20 State of Hawai'i Department of Health Cooperative agreement April 1, 2004–March 31, 2024 20 Catholic Church Cooperative agreement Aug. 23, 2004- Aug. 22, 2034 20 State of Hawai'i Department of Transportation Cooperative agreement Expired March 9, 2007; new agreement is in development. 20 State of Hawai'i Department of Land and Natural Resources Cooperative agreement Sept. 15, 2009–Sept. 14, 2029 20 R. W. Meyer, Ltd. Memorandum of understanding April 27, 2012–April 26, 2017 5\n\nBoard of Land and Natural Resources\n\nOn August 16, 1989, the National Park Service entered into a cooperative agreement with the State of Hawaiʻi, Board of Land and Natural Resources, for 20 years, entitled “Preservation of Natural and Cultural Resources, Kalaupapa.” The area under this cooperative agreement includes 1,330 acres of Kalawao County, within the boundary of the park, that have been established by the Governor’s Executive Order as the Pu‘u Ali‘i Natural Area Reserve. Other areas of Kalawao County have been designated as forest reservations under the care and control of the board. The area also includes 78 acres of land at Nihoa and parts of Pālāʻau State Park. The agreement authorizes the National Park Service and the Department of Natural Resources to engage in shared resource management activities in the area covered by the agreement. The National Park Service agrees to protect and preserve archeological sites, native ecosystems, threatened and endangered species, and water and air quality, and to conduct research and prepare plans for management, operations, preservation, and interpretation of these resources (Cooperative Agreement No: CA 8896-9-8004, August 16, 1989, renewed as Cooperative Agreement No. H8896090017 renewed for 20 years, September 15, 2009).\n\nDepartment of Health\n\nOn April 1, 2004, the National Park Service renewed its cooperative agreement with the State of Hawai‘i, Department of Health, entitled “Preservation of Historic Structures, Kalaupapa,” for an additional 20 years. Under the agreement, the National Park Service agreed to maintain utilities, roads, and nonmedical patient functions and maintenance of historic structures within the park, and the Department of Health at Kalaupapa agreed to provide food, housing, health care, and social services for the patient community. The Department of Health is also responsible for issuing visitor access permits and managing the landfill. Since 1980, infrastructure responsibilities within the settlement have been shared between the Department of Health and the National Park Service. Some of the Department of Health’s major infrastructure responsibilities have been transferred to the National Park Service in anticipation of the Department of Health’s future departure. The Department of Health may transfer ownership of historic structures to the National Park Service by mutual agreement at any time (Cooperative Agreement No. CA 8896-4-0001, dated March 30, 1984, and renewed as modification-0001, dated April 1, 2004).\n\nDepartment of Transportation\n\nOn March 9, 1987, the National Park Service entered into a cooperative agreement with the State of Hawai‘i Department of Transportation to coordinate operation and utilities for twenty years, entitled “Preservation of Natural and Cultural Resources, Kalaupapa.” The National Park Service agrees to assist in the preservation, protection, rehabilitation, restoration, interpretation, maintenance, and project planning regarding buildings and cultural features located on airport grounds (Cooperative Agreement No: CA 8896-7-8005, March 9, 1987). An update to the agreement is underway.\n\nR. W. Meyer, Limited\n\nSeventy-two acres in the southwest corner of the park near the Kalaupapa Trailhead are privately owned by R. W. Meyer, Ltd. The park maintains a memorandum of understanding with R. W. Meyer, Ltd., for trail access, maintenance, and the planting of native plants (dated May 5, 2017, for five years).\n\nEast Molokai Watershed Partnership\n\nKalaupapa National Historical Park entered into a memorandum of understanding with the East Molokai Watershed Partnership when it was formed in 1999 and updated in 2003 to protect the best remaining native forest watershed areas on the East Molokai Mountains.\n\nKey strategies employed by the partnership include reduction of feral animal populations; monitoring systems that help guide and document management actions; community outreach that engages, educates, and gains support of the local communities; continual development of the partnership through fundraising, capacity building, and landowner expansion; and involvement with fire (Molokai Fire Task Force) and island invasive species efforts (Molokai subcommittee of the Maui Invasive Species Committee). Land-based partners include Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate, Kamalo Ahupua‘a (3,566 acres); Kapualei Ranch, Kapualei Ahupua‘a (1,680 acres); Kawela Plantation Homeowners Association, Kawela Ahupua’a (5,500 acres); State of Hawaiʻi Division of Forestry and Wildlife, Pu‘u Ali‘i (1,330 acres) and Olokui (1,620 acres) Natural Area Reserves; National Park Service, Kalaupapa National Historical Park (10,800 acres); and The Nature Conservancy, Kamakou (2,774 acres) and Pelekunu Preserves (5,714 acres). Agency partners include Ke Aupuni Lokahi, Enterprise Community Governance Board (community, funder); Maui County (funder); Molokai / Lānaʻi Soil and Water Conservation District (technical assistance); U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resource Conservation Services (technical assistance, funder); U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (technical assistance, funder); U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (technical assistance); U.S. Geological Services (technical assistance); and the State of Hawaiʻi Department of Health (technical assistance, funder).\n\nHawaiʻi Conference Foundation\n\nAs part of the renewal of the cooperative agreement, a general agreement was executed between Hawaiʻi Conference Foundation and the National Park Service. This agreement allows for Hawaiʻi Conference Foundation and the Kana‘ana Hou and Siloama congregations to continue using the Hale Kahu structure and Wilcox Parish Hall. Both of these buildings are state-owned and eventually will be transferred to the National Park Service.
