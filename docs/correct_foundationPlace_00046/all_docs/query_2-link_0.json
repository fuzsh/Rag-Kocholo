        "text": "Good afternoon friends and family, As always I'd like to start by thanking everyone for your kindness and solidarity, its is people like us that believe that can make a difference in the world that actually do. I am excited because we are only a few weeks away before we travel to the jungle and fund this proyect for the Nokekoi people. Be clear that every penny goes to them, everyone in our foundation is a volunteer so we have no overhead cost. Please take a look at the following pictures, we have done this before but this time we are not only helping one village, we are helping all the villages. Its truly beautiful to see how far we have come and we know we couldnt do it without your support. So once again, thank you very much! https://gofund.me/bf72e5aa\n\nGood afternoon friends and family, As always I'd like to start by thanking everyone for your kindness and solidarity, its is people like us that believe that can make a difference in the world that actually do.
