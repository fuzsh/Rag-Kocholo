The thousands of California businesses involved in our state-legal cannabis industry represent a significant economic force. As the industry's most influential state trade association, CCIA works everyday to ensure our burgeoning business sector is represented in a professional and coordinated way at the state level.\n\nThe California Cannabis Industry Association (CCIA) was formed to unite the legal cannabis industry to help educate and act as a resource to lawmakers and our members. We are the most influential trade association in the state representing the diverse interests of the cannabis industry: retail, cultivation, manufacturing, delivery, distribution, testing, insurance, packaging, and various ancillary services. Our unified voice includes 500 businesses and represents nearly 15,000 employees across the state.\n\nOver the past years, CCIA has consistently advocated on behalf of cannabis businesses to advance a comprehensive regulatory framework that achieves important policy objectives encouraging investment and innovation, protecting small businesses, and enhancing public and consumer safety.\n\nCCIA will continue to work diligently with the legislature, the Administration, and the licensing authorities on open-market regulations and solutions that foster a robust cannabis industry while prioritizing public safety and health."
