        "text": "1ï¼About the test\n\nWhat sort of test is the JLPT?\n\nThe Japanese-Language Proficiency Test is held in Japan and abroad to evaluate and certify Japanese-language proficiency of non-native speakers.\n\nAre there any special qualifications needed to take the JLPT?\n\nThe JLPT is open to all non-native Japanese speakers. Eligibility extends to holders of Japanese citizenship. There are no age restrictions for the JLPT.\n\nI have a physical disability. Can I take the JLPT?\n\nYes, you can. We make special testing accommodations for examinees with disabilities. Please inquire at the institution conducting the test in the country/area where you plan to take it. Those who would like to make special testing accommodations need to submit \" Request Form for Special Testing Accommodations \" along with their application form upon registration.\n\nHow often is the JLPT going to be administered?\n\nTwice yearly, in July and December. Outside Japan, the test may be held only in July or December in some cities. Please check \"List of Overseas Test Site Cities and Local Host Institutions\" for the test schedule in your city.\n\nWhen will the JLPT held in 2024 ?\n\nIn 2024, the tests will be conducted on Sunday, July 7 and Sunday, December 1.\n\nï¼Outside Japan, the test may be held only in July or December in some cities. Please check \"List of Overseas Test Site Cities and Local Host Institutions\" for the test schedule in your city.ï¼\n\nWhere can we take the JLPT?\n\nYou can take the test in major cities all over Japan. If you are planning to take the test outside Japan, you can find cities where the test is offered in \"Local Host Institutions of JLPT.\"\n\nCan I apply to take only some sections instead of all sections?\n\nNo, you cannot.\n\nAt the time of registration, I will not be in the country/area where I want to take the test. What should I do?\n\nPlease make sure to apply with the institution conducting the test in the country/area where you plan to take it. Registration methods differ by country. Please contact the local institution. If you cannot apply for the test by yourself, please ask a friend or acquaintance in the country/area where you want to take the test for help with registration.\n\nWho conducts the JLPT?\n\nThe Japan Foundation and Japan Educational Exchanges and Services.\n\nJapan Educational Exchanges and Services conducts the test in Japan, and the Japan Foundation conducts the test overseas with the cooperation of local host institutions.\n\nIn Taiwan, the JLPT is co-hosted with Japan - Taiwan Exchange Association.\n\n3ï¼Test sections, test times and test questions\n\nDoes the JLPT include a conversation or composition test?\n\nNo, neither is currently included.\n\nWhat are test sections and test times?\n\nPlease refer to \"Test Sections and Test Times.\"\n\nTest times are shorter and the number of questions is smaller for âLanguage Knowledge (Vocabulary)â and âLanguage Knowledge (Grammar)ã»Readingâ for N4 and N5, and for âListeningâ for N1. Does this change the difficulty or the contents of the test questions?\n\nThere is no change in the difficulty or the contents of the test questions. For new test times, please refer to âTest Sections and Test Times.â\n\nTest times are shorter and the number of questions is smaller for âLanguage Knowledge (Vocabulary)â and âLanguage Knowledge (Grammar)ã»Readingâ for N4 and N5, and for âListeningâ for N1. Will the test results be as reliable as before?\n\nThe test results will be as reliable as before.\n\nIn general, a larger number of questions is said to improve the reliability of the test results.\n\nThe number of questions was reduced for âLanguage Knowledge (Vocabulary)â and âLanguage Knowledge (Grammar)ã»Readingâ for N4 and N5 from the test in 2020 (December), and for âListeningâ for N1 from the test in 2022 (December). The changes are based on research into test data since the 2010 revision of the JLPT, and are designed to produce reliable test results even with a smaller number of questions.\n\nWhy is the test section \"Language Knowledge (Vocabulary/Grammar)ã»Reading\" for N1 and N2 divided into two sections -- \"Language Knowledge (Vocabulary)\" and \"Language Knowledge (Grammar)ã»Reading\" -- for N3, N4 and N5?\n\nBecause there are fewer test items in vocabulary and grammar that can be included in levels N3, N4 and N5, placing Language Knowledge (Vocabulary/Grammar) and Reading in the same section may inadvertently provide hints for answers. In order to avoid such a situation, two separate test sections -- \"Language Knowledge (Vocabulary)\" and \"Language Knowledge (Grammar)ã»Reading\" -- are offered for N3, N4 and N5.\n\nWhat kinds of questions are in the JLPT?\n\nThey are summarized in \"Composition of test items.\" \"Sample Questions\" covers all question patterns for all levels. Please take a look at it.\n\nAre all JLPT answers computer scored?\n\nYes, the JLPT uses a multiple-choice computer-scored answer sheet. There are four choices for most questions, although some \"Listening\" questions have only three choices.\n\nThe last question in \"Listening\" for N1 and N2 has a note saying, \"ãã®åé¡ï¼ããã ãï¼ã«ã¯ç·´ç¿ï¼ãããã ãï¼ã¯ããã¾ããã(No practice available for this question.)\" What does this mean?\n\nOther \"Listening\" questions have examples to help examinees understand the form and how to answer. The last question does not have this kind of example with which to practice.\n\nDoes the JLPT include questions that require cultural knowledge of Japan?\n\nNo question specifically asks cultural knowledge of Japan. Some questions may refer to cultural aspects, but all questions can be answered without cultural knowledge.\n\nCan I keep the test paper after I take the test?\n\nNo, you cannot take the test paper with you. If you do, you will automatically fail the test.\n\nWho owns copyrights of the JLPT test questions?\n\nTest question copyrights are held by test organizers, the Japan Foundation and Japan Educational Exchanges and Services.\n\nUnauthorized copying, duplication, and reproduction of test questions is strictly prohibited by law. Test questions may also contain material copyrighted by third parties. When using third-party copyrighted material, permission must be obtained separately from the copyright holder.\n\n4ï¼Studying for the test\n\nAre questions of past tests published?\n\nThe exact same test questions of every exam are not published. However, the Japanese-Language Proficiency Test Official Practice Workbooks have been released in 2 volumes sinceÂ theÂ 2010Â revision of the test. The Official Practice Workbook published in 2012 and the Official Practice Workbook Vol. 2 released in 2018 each contains, forÂ allÂ levels, questions selectedÂ fromÂ amongÂ thoseÂ usedÂ inÂ testsÂ sinceÂ theÂ 2010Â revision, with the number of test items included being almost equivalent to an actual test. Sample questions based on past test questions are scheduled be published regularly in the future. The publication schedule will be announced on the official JLPT website.\n\nWhy is \"Test Content Specifications\" no longer available after the 2010 revision of the JLPT?\n\nWe believe that the ultimate goal of studying Japanese is to use the language to communicate rather than simply memorizing vocabulary, kanji and grammar items. Based on this idea, the JLPT measures \"language knowledge such as characters, vocabulary and grammar\" as well as \"competence to perform communicative tasks by using the language knowledge.\" Therefore, we decided that publishing \"Test Content Specifications\" containing a list of vocabulary, kanji and grammar items was not necessarily appropriate. As information to replace \"Summary of Linguistic Competence Required for Each Level\" and \"Composition of test items\" are available. Please also refer to \"Sample Questions.\"\n\nCan I listen to audio of listening comprehension question examples?\n\nYes, you can. You can download audio files from \"Sample Questions.\"\n\nIn addition, the following books come with audio CDs.\n\nã»\"New Japanese-Language Proficiency Test Guidebook: An Executive Summary and Sample Questions for N1,N2 and N3\" (900 yen, + tax)\n\nã»\"New Japanese-Language Proficiency Test Guidebook: An Executive Summary and Sample Questions for N4 and N5\" (800 yen, + tax)\n\nã»\"Japanese-Language Proficiency Test Official Practice Workbook (N1/N2/N3/N4/N5)\" (700 yen for each level, + tax)\n\nã»\"Japanese-Language Proficiency Test Official Practice Workbook Vol.2(N1/N2/N3/N4/N5)\" (700 yen for each level, + tax)\n\n5ï¼Scores and determination of pass or fail\n\nHow can I receive test results?\n\nThe Scoring Sections and range of scores are shown in \"Scoring sections and range of scores for each level.\"\n\nIn test results, \"Language Knowledge (Vocabulary)\" and \"Language Knowledge (Grammar) ã»Reading,\" which are separate test sections in N4 and N5, are combined as one scoring section. Why is this?\n\nBecause many areas of \"Language Knowledge\" and \"Reading\" in N4 and N5 at the basic stage of Japanese-language learning overlap or cannot be easily separated, we believe giving a combined score for \"Reading\" and \"Language Knowledge\" better suits the characteristics of the learning stage, rather than giving a separate score for \"Reading\" by itself.\n\nHow are scores for each question allocated within individual scoring sections?\n\nSome tests use a system of totaling pre-determined points for correct answers to calculate scores. The JLPT uses a scaled score system based on \"Item Response Theory\" and does not total allocated points of correctly answered questions. Please see the more detailed explanation about scaled scores.\n\nThe scores I received are different from what I thought I would get. Can I have them confirmed?\n\nIndividual examinees' scores are calculated not only mechanically but also strictly checked by specialists. As clearly stated in the Test Guide, we do not accept any inquiries regarding an individual's test results.\n\nThe JLPT uses \"scaled scores.\" Scaled scores are calculated based on \"answering patterns\" of each examinee, not on \"the number of questions correctly answered.\" Therefore, scores in the results may be different from what you thought. Please see the more detailed explanation about scaled scores.\n\nI received my results and know my scores. How do I find out where I stand among all examinees?\n\nThere is a chart (\"Cumulative Distribution of Scaled Scores\") in the materials of each test time of \"Past Test Data.\" You can find out where you stand among all examinees who took the same test by using the scaled scores given in the Score Report and this chart.\n\nâ»From the JLPT held in July 2016, a percentile rank is indicated on the certificate of examinees who passed the test overseas (excluding those who were exempt from the Listening section), showing the percentage of examinees with a score lower than yours in the six latest tests, including the one you took.\n\nCan we compare the scores of the current test and the old test through 2009?\n\nSince the content of the current test and the scoring method are different from the old test, the scores from the current test cannot be compared to those of the old test.\n\nHow is pass or fail determined? How many scores do I need to pass?\n\nExaminees pass the JLPT when they take all required test sections and (1) have a total score to be at or above the Overall Pass Mark and (2) all scores of scoring sections are to be at or above the Sectional Pass Marks. If there is even one scoring section where the score is below the sectional pass mark, examinees are determined to have failed, no matter how high the total score he/she might have.\n\nScoring sections of N1-N3 and N4-N5 are different. Overall pass marks and sectional pass marks for each level are shown in the table below.\n\nLevel Total score Scores by Scoring Sections Language Knowledge\n\nï¼Vocabulary/Grammarï¼ Reading Listening Range of scores Overall pass marks Range of scores Sectional pass marks Range of scores Sectional pass marks Range of scores Sectional pass marks N1 0ï½180\n\npoints 100 points 0ï½60 points 19 points 0ï½60 points 19 points 0ï½60 points 19 points N2 0ï½180\n\npoints 90 points 0ï½60 points 19 points 0ï½60 points 19 points 0ï½60 points 19 points N3 0ï½180\n\npoints 95 points 0ï½60 points 19 points 0ï½60 points 19 points 0ï½60 points 19 points\n\nLevel Total score Scores by Scoring Sections Language Knowledge\n\nï¼Vocabulary/Grammarï¼ã»Reading Listening Range of scores Overall pass marks Range of scores Sectional pass marks Range of scores Sectional pass marks N4 0ï½180\n\npoints 90 points 0ï½120 points 38 points 0ï½60 points 19 points N5 0ï½180\n\npoints 80 points 0ï½120 points 38 points 0ï½60 points 19 points\n\nâ»The above standards were adopted beginning with July test in 2010 (December test in 2010 with N4 and N5).\n\nWhy does passing the test require (1) the minimum acceptable total score and (2) a minimum acceptable score in each scoring section?\n\nThis is to evaluate if learners have a certain level of ability in all three elements, \"Language Knowledge,\" \"Reading\" and \"Listening.\"\n\nWhat will happen if I don't take a test section?\n\nExaminees will be judged to have failed if they miss a required test section. Although they will receive a Score Report, it will not show scores for any test section, including those that have been taken.\n\nIf my score does not reach the minimum required in a Scoring Section, can I take only that section again and pass the JLPT if I get an acceptable score?\n\nNo. A judgment of pass or fail is made only for examinees who take all sections each time the test is given. Therefore, pass or fail cannot be determined if you take only a section where you previously failed to achieve a minimum score. You will pass the JLPT when you take the test for all sections on a subsequent occasion and earn (1) the minimum acceptable total score and (2) a minimum acceptable score in each Scoring Section.\n\n6ï¼Test results (Score Report and Certificate of Proficiency)\n\nWhen and how do I receive test results?\n\nA Score Report will be mailed to all examinees. In Japan, Score Reports for the July test will be sent in early September and Score Reports for the December test will be sent in early February. To examinees outside of Japan, Score Reports will be sent via local host institutions, and examinees will receive a report for the July test in early October and a report for the December test in early March. If you do not receive a report by the end of the scheduled month, please contact the local institution in the city where you took the test.\n\nCan I receive the test results by e-mail or over the phone?\n\nNo, you cannot. We cannot respond to any inquiries regarding the test results via telephone or e-mail for any reason.\n\nThere is a mistake in my Score Report/Certificate of Proficiency.\n\nProcedures for reissuing a Score Report or Certificate of Proficiency due to mistakes in name or date of birth vary by the country/area in which you have taken the test. If you took the test in Japan, please inquire at JLPT Application Center, and if you took the test outside Japan, please inquire at the local host institution of the city in which you took the test.\n\nâ Japan\n\nJLPT Application Center\n\nHours: Monday-Friday, 9:30-17:30\n\nTel: 03-6686-2974ããFax: 03-6845-2544\n\nâ Overseas\n\nâCertificate of Result and Scoresâ and âCertificate of Japanese-Language Proficiencyâ with errors (eg. Name, date of birth) will be corrected and re-issued only if they are reported within a year from the test date. Request for correction due to the change of your name caused after the test date will NOT be accepted. The conditions for correction and reissuance are depending on each local host institution. Examinee should contact local host institution and present following documents.\n\nâ Test Voucher or Application Form B\n\nâ¡ Photo identification used for the application of the test\n\nâ¢ Original âCertificate of Result and Scoresâ and âCertificate of Japanese-Language Proficiencyâ (if issued)\n\nDoes the JLPT certificate expire at some point?\n\nThe JLPT certificate never expires. Results of the old test through 2009 also continue to be valid. However, companies and educational institutions that refer to test results sometimes set a time limit on the certificate. Please inquire at individual companies and educational institutions, as necessary.\n\nI have lost my Score Report/Certificate of Proficiency.\n\nThey cannot be reissued, but as a replacement, duplicate copy of \"Japanese-Language Proficiency Test Certificate of Result and Scores\" can be issued. Please see \"Certificate Issuance\" for how to apply.\n\nHow do I check that a Certificate of Japanese-Language Proficiency / Score Report, a Certificate of Japanese-Language Proficiency, or a JLPT Certificate of Result and Scores is not forged or falsified?\n\nThe procedure for requesting confirmation of authenticity of a Certificate of Japanese-Language Proficiency / Score Report, a Certificate of Japanese-Language Proficiency, or a JLPT Certificate of Result and Scores varies by the country/area in which the test was taken. If you took the test in Japan, please contact the Japan Educational Exchanges and Services Center for Japanese-Language Testing. If you took the test outside Japan, please contact The Japan Foundation Center for Japanese-Language Testing.\n\nâ In Japan\n\nJapan Educational Exchanges and Services Center for Japanese-Language Testing\n\nHours: MondayâFriday 9:30â17:30 (excluding Japanese public holidays and New Year holidays)\n\nTel: 03-5454-5215 Fax: 03-5454-5235\n\nâ Outside Japan\n\nThe Japan Foundation Center for Japanese-Language Testing\n\nE-mail: jlptinfoï¼ jpf.go.jp\n\n(When sending an e-mail, replace the full-width â@â character with a half-width â@â character.)\n\n* Please write your e-mail in either Japanese or English.\n\n7ï¼JLPT Can-do Self-Evaluation List\n\nHow are \"Summary of Linguistic Competence Required for Each Level\" and \"JLPT Can-do Self-Evaluation List\" different?\n\n\"Summary of Linguistic Competence Required for Each Level\" shows the level of abilities required for each level of the JLPT. On the other hand, \"JLPT Can-do Self-Evaluation List\" indicates activities that successful examinees of each level think they \"can do in Japanese.\" In other words, it does not refer to passing of a level's standard but is based on examinees' self-evaluation. It can be used as a reference to get an idea of \"what can be done in Japanese by successful examinees of a particular level.\"\n\nAre all examinees who pass a level able to do the activities listed in \"JLPT Can-do Self-Evaluation List\"?\n\nNo. Because the list shows results of successful examinees' answers to the question \"do you think you can â¦,\" activities listed may not necessarily be possible for all those who pass the level. However, since the survey was conducted with as many as 65,000 examinees, the list is believed to show overall tendencies and set aside extreme differences by individual.\n\nThe JLPT does not include conversation or composition. Why does \"JLPT Can-do Self-Evaluation List\" include descriptions of Speaking and Writing skills?\n\n\"JLPT Can-do Self-Evaluation List\" summarizes what activities (listening, speaking, reading and writing) successful examinees of each level can do in Japanese, based on a questionnaire survey. It is not a syllabus (question outline) of the test. The list is prepared based on a survey, which also encompasses questions on speaking and writing skills, in order to provide prospective examinees and others with comprehensive information on what successful examinees think they \"can do,\" regardless of test section or content.\n\nHow was the Can-do survey for \"JLPT Can-do Self-Evaluation List\" conducted?\n\nPlease refer to \"JLPT Can-do Self-Evaluation Survey Reports: Final Report\" for details. (The reports are written in Japanese.)\n\nHow is \"JLPT Can-do Self-Evaluation List\" different from \"JLPT Can-do Self-Evaluation Survey Reports: Interim Report\"?\n\n\"JLPT Can-do Self-Evaluation List\" was prepared based on a continuing survey following \"JLPT Can-do Self-Evaluation Survey Reports: Interim Report\" and included a larger number of survey respondents. While the survey items are identical for both surveys, methods of analysis and result calculation differ. Please refer to an upcoming publication, \"JLPT Can-do Self-Evaluation Survey Reports: Final Report\" for details. (The reports are written in Japanese.)\n\nIs Can-do for \"JLPT Can-do Self-Evaluation List\" the same as Can-do for \"JF Standard for Japanese-Language Education\"?\n\nNo. \"JLPT Can-do Self-Evaluation List\" and \"JF Standard for Japanese-Language Education\" were prepared under different circumstances, and they differ in development purposes, methods and procedures. For Can-do for JF Standard for Japanese-Language Education, please refer to the \"JF Standard for Japanese-Language Education\" website. For relationships between the JLPT and JF Standard for Japanese-Language Education, please refer to \"Reports on Association Survey on JF Standard for Japanese-Language Education and JLPT.\""
