        "text": "Any student who will be enrolled in a university/college undergraduate program in the fall following the Summer Program or enrolled in medical school is eligible to be hired as a Research Summer Student. That includes high school students in their last year. If you are in your final year of undergraduate studies, you are eligible to be hired as a Research Summer Student so long as you will be, or have applied to be, enrolled in a university/college program in the fall.\n\nIf you’re a high school student but not in your last year, you may be eligible to participate in the Student Advancement Research (StAR) internship program.\n\nStudents interested in applying to posted positions are encouraged to apply as early as possible, as scientists receive a high volume of applications and positions are filled quickly. Positions are posted in late fall/early winter. Please complete the SSuRe application form to apply for a posted position. Make sure you read the instructions in the job posting carefully! Neither the Research Training Centre nor the Human Resources Department will accept or forward Research Summer Student applications.\n\nIf you would like to apply to more than one scientist, you must send individual applications to each scientist through the SSuRe application form , as each scientist is responsible for selecting their own student(s). You can view our full list of scientists on our Reseachers page.\n\nTo apply for a summer position, students must submit the following directly to the hiring scientist(s) via their preferred application method (as noted in the posting):\n\n1. Complete, and submit the SickKids Summer Research Program application form\n\n2. Cover letter\n\n3. CV/Resume\n\n4. Current university/college transcripts\n\nOfficial or unofficial transcripts (copies or online versions) are acceptable. Please submit electronically with the rest of your application.\n\nNo minimum grade point average (GPA) is required to be eligible to apply for a SickKids Research Summer Student position. However, these positions are highly competitive, so it’s to your advantage to have a strong GPA. That said, passion and genuine interest go a long way!\n\n5. Any other documents required by the individual posting.\n\nDue to the large volume of applications received, only those candidates selected for an interview will be contacted. Each scientist will conduct interviews and make final selections independent of the Research Training Centre. All candidates selected for posted positions will have been contacted by early April of each year.\n\nAfter the deadline, students are advised to contact scientist(s) directly to see if positions are still available as only candidates chosen for interviews will be contacted.\n\nSome scientists choose not to post research summer student positions, but rather hire students by direct application.\n\nTo contact a scientist to see if they have any open research student opportunities, please visit our list of SickKids researchers to see who is doing research you’re interested in and submit an application through the SSuRe application form.\n\nThe U of T Student Life blog has a handy post with advice on applying for summer research positions.\n\nStudents must email the following directly to the scientist(s):\n\n1. Download, complete, and submit the SickKids Summer Research Program application form\n\n2.Cover letter (recommended)\n\n3. CV/Resume\n\n4. Current university/college transcripts\n\nOfficial or unofficial transcripts (copies or online versions) are acceptable. Please submit electronically with the rest of your application.\n\nNo minimum grade point average (GPA) is required to be eligible to apply for a SickKids Research Summer Student position. However, these positions are highly competitive, so it’s to your advantage to have a strong GPA. That said, passion and genuine interest go a long way!\n\nDue to the large volume of applications received, only those candidates selected for an interview will be contacted. Each scientist will conduct interviews and make final selections independent of the Research Training Centre.\n\nThe SSuRe Program runs two research summer student-specific orientation sessions in May prior to the commencement of the program’s curricular activities — in the first and last week of May. Orientation includes a welcome address from our SSuRe Program committee chairs, information about clinical research services and research ethics, fire safety training, and occupational health services, including your occupational health appointment. You’ll get auto enrolled into the appropriate session, depending on your start date.\n\nYou’ll also get priority access to lab safety training sessions. The first sessions are held over the second week of May and the second sessions are held over the first week of June.\n\nIf your start date does not correspond with these orientation and training dates—no problem! You’ll just attend the usual SickKids’ orientation and training, and we’ll post the orientation slides on our internal summer program pages.\n\nEach week, a leading SickKids scientist provides a dynamic, engaging talk intended to teach you something about a different area of research happening in the hospital and research institute. By the end of the summer, you'll have a better understanding and appreciation of the key roles basic and clinical research have in advancing our knowledge of human health and disease.\n\nThe program also runs two skills focused seminars: winning posters and effective abstracts and a “how to talk to strangers” networking seminar. These seminars will teach you how to translate your research in a way that’s engaging, easy to understand, and inspiring. You’ll get best practices on writing effective abstracts, and give you the design ideas, tools, and software suggestions you need to create dynamic, eye-catching posters—and hands-on practice and expert knowledge about how to meet and talk to new people about yourself and your research.\n\nThe SSuRe Program provides $2,000 for up to 35 SickKids Research Institute scientists to support Research Summer Student salaries. The funding is generously provided from the Lunenfeld Summer Studentship.\n\nLunenfeld Studentships are awarded directly to the scientist and Research Summer Students supported by this funding will be required to participate in Symposium Day by submitting and abstract and presenting a poster/oral presentation.\n\nYour hiring scientist will let you know if you are a Lunenfeld Studentship funded student.\n\nThe SSuRe Program began a partnership with the Community of Support Research Application Support Initiative (COS-RASI) at the University of Toronto to help support students who are Indigenous, Black, Filipino, economically disadvantaged, or who self-identify as disabled. This program targets students who are interested in finding summer positions in health science research to help support their career development in the field of medicine.\n\nThe partnership includes support in applying to centralized positions, mentorship opportunities and access to all SSuRe Program initiatives.\n\nThe Opportunity Summer Studentship is valued at $3,000 each and will be awarded to the top ten ranked applicants to the COS-RASI program.\n\nFor more information on how to apply to the RASI stream, visit the COS page on the University of Toronto website through the link below.\n\nView COS information\n\nThe SSuRe Program activities officially start at the beginning of May and run for 15 weeks until Symposium Day, which is held in mid-August. Depending on how much later you are able to begin work, this may not be enough time for you to conduct sufficient research for your abstract presentation on Symposium Day.\n\nMost students will begin on the first day of the SSuRe Program and will have ample time to work on their projects, which may put you at a disadvantage when submitting your abstract for Symposium Day. Please consider this before applying to the program. Please contact the scientist(s) you are interested in working with to ask if they would be willing to accept your application under these circumstances.\n\nIf you are a medical student, your Research Summer Student position will begin June 1, or the first business day after June 1."
