        "text": "The FIUTS Global Month Photo Contest - a part of UW Global Month - is a weekly opportunity for members of the FIUTS global community to share images from different regions around the world. The third week of the contest features Asia, and we received many beautiful photos taken by photographers from around the world.\n\nThere were many great submissions, and it was difficult for the FIUTS staff to choose just three winners! Thank you to everyone for sharing your pictures – continue on to see photo entries and contest winners…\n\n“I was on a road trip in Inner Mongolia with my parents. We were in the Arxan National Forest Park. As we were driving, we spotted a lot of horses casually chilling in thigh-deep grass not far from the road. We found somewhere we could park and got off the car to watch the horses.\n\nThe sound of the horses chewing grass was so serene and therapeutic. There were a lot more horses around but they were quite scattered so I could only photography these ones. No one was watching them and it seems like they could just wander around freely and go home when they want to.\n\nLater that night we planned to drive to a lake we saw in the day for stargazing. Within five minutes of driving from our cabin there was already no other light source than our own car headlight. We eventually got too intimidated to drive further, as the road was way too narrow, the lake was quite far, and we couldn't see where we were going. We drove off to a side branch of the road and stopped the car. We got off and looked up. I teared up immediately. The sky was so breathtaking. It was new moon and the air was so pure and dry that I got to see the best night sky of my life, and the milky way. It got quite cold, and we had one blanket in the car, so the three of us wrapped ourselves together in the one blanket, and continued looking up while keeping each other warm with our own body temperature. There were also a lot of shooting stars, so much so that we started a competition to see who spotted the most shooting starts. I was in a lasting state of anxiety about graduate school application at that time, but standing under the stars with my loving parents wrapped in the same blanket was a transcendent experience and lifted me out of all my worries at that time.”\n\nZhiyao Li // Hometown: Shengyang, China"
