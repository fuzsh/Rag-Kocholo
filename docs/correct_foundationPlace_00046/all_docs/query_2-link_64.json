Once I return home to Indonesia, I can certainly say that UC Davis, the Global Study Program and all my friends will always hold a special place in my heart. Some of my most treasured memories here include volunteering for the American Red Cross, the Global Study Program Thanksgiving Party and the Design of Coffee Lab Class! One thing I hope to accomplish here is to do as much volunteering as I possibly can. Volunteering is not only a way for me to meet new people and gain a multitude of skills and experiences, but it also empowers me to have a compassionate heart and a confident spirit. I believe that the eclectic mix of resources and outreach that the Global Study Program provides, along with the learning environment at UC Davis, will enable me to achieve this particular goal.” —Gregory Josefano, Indonesia International Institute for Life Sciences, Indonesia\n\nI am genuinely thankful for all the courses I took at UC Davis, which significantly developed my interest in English literature and global communication.

Also, the campus life is very nice—so many people biking around campus is definitely a highlight.
