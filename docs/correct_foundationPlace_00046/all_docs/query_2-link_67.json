        "text": "SHARE YOUR FEEDBACK\n\nWhat: The S.O.S. project is looking for your input through our open public comment period. It is your chance to share what you think will help make online platforms safer for users who are 13-24 years of age. Any feedback submitted in the forum below may be shared publicly but will be anonymized and not attributed to you.\n\nWhen: March 1-31, 2024\n\nWho: Anyone 18 or older is able to participate. If you are 13-18 years of age, you can participate with a parent’s approval. You may participate anonymously if you prefer (enter “N/A” instead of identifying information).\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. What could social media companies do to make platforms safer (policies, app settings, content moderation, etc.)?\n\n2. What type of content should be moderated, regulated or banned on their platforms?\n\n3. How should social media platforms educate or inform users as it relates to well being updates?\n\nWhile being online has plenty of benefits, any technology used by our kids with such potency and frequency during such an influential time in their development demands our serious attention.\n\nTo date, there are no independent standards to guide young people’s online and social media experiences that put their health and well-being first. We have left parents and teens to fend for themselves when it comes to a highly influential but largely unregulated and fully ubiquitous industry.\n\nWhile there may be many things that impact the emotional, social, and intellectual well-being of teens, the ever-worsening mental health outcomes for teens demand that we put in place standards that support their mental health for an industry that plays such an outsized role in their lives.\n\nThe US Surgeon General has issued a public advisory highlighting this critical moment in time. If we don’t act now, history will judge us accordingly. We must create a responsible framework that defines and distinguishes harmful from healthful social media experiences; standards that can be accessed by all stakeholders, starting with youth."
