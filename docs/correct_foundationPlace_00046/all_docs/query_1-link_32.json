        "text": "Tucked away in a corner of an East Oakland park, a farm nurtures children as they work together to grow food, with any profits set aside for their future education.\n\nActa Non Verba, Latin for Deeds Not Words, is one of 46 California food-centered organizations recognized by James Beard Foundation for their community work.\n\nActa Non Verba has served 3,000 children since its founding in 2011. The children ages 5 to 13 plan, plant, grow, harvest and sell food for a Community Supported Agriculture program.\n\nThe farm also holds seasonal camps, field trips, after-school programs, and health and wellness classes. Children are shown how to prepare the vegetables and take home some to share with their families.\n\n“I wanted to create a program where the kids have a say. I was looking for a way for children to invest in themselves, to create a trust for themselves,” said Kelly Carlisle, executive director of Acta Non Verba.\n\n“Most of the kids who are in trouble — whether it’s violence, drugs, prostitution, et cetera —don’t have choices about where they live, whether there’s a positive home life or what their family’s income is,” she said.\n\nActa Non Verba operates a quarter-acre farm at Tassafaronga Park in what the organization describes as a “food desert.”\n\nThe organization’s main goal is to improve the lives of inner-city youth by engaging them in urban farming, and by creating a safe, educational, green and fun space for youth from the surrounding Elmhurst neighborhood and East Oakland community.\n\n“Our farm is an actual sanctuary for kids who have seen too much and experienced too much,” Carlisle said in a video on the farm’s website.\n\nAll of the proceeds from the farm are placed in individual savings accounts for children taking part, where funds can only be used for their future education.\n\nThe food-based organizations recognized by the James Beard Foundation are included in the 2016 Good Food Org Guide.\n\nThe James Beard Foundation, Food Tank and an advisory group developed the third annual Good Food Org Guide that highlights 46 organizations throughout California that are cultivating better food systems for their communities, including several in the East Bay.\n\nOther local East Area organizations recognized for their work in the 2016 Good Food Org Guide include: HOPE Collaborative in Oakland, Dig Deep Farms & Produce in San Leandro, People’s Grocery in Oakland and City Slicker Farms in West Oakland.\n\nAlso listed are Ecology Center in Berkeley, Imperfect Produce in Emeryville, Food Craft Institute in Oakland, Community Food & Justice Coalition in Oakland and the Ecology Center in Berkeley.\n\nNourish Wellness in Oakland, Food Craft Institute in Oakland, Community Food & Justice Coalition in Oakland and Roots of Change in Oakland also are included.\n\nThe guide highlights organizations that are doing exceptional and dedicated work in the areas of food and agriculture, nutrition and health, hunger and obesity, and food justice.\n\n”The Good Food Org Guide continues to serve as a useful tool for individuals looking for opportunities to improve their local food system,” said Susan Ungaro, president of the James Beard Foundation.\n\n“The guide’s user-friendly design makes it the go-to resource for identifying nearby organizations doing good work in the areas of food justice, hunger, and agriculture.”\n\nThe vision and objective of the annual publication is to focus attention on organizations that work every day in fields, kitchens, classrooms, laboratories, businesses, town halls and Congress.\n\n“It feels wonderful to be listed with other amazing organizations doing good food work!” said Carlisle. “We know it takes a village to address the problems of our food system, so we are proud and humbled by all the work and passion these organizations bring to the table every day.”\n\nThe organizations and initiatives spotlighted in the guide have been recognized as active in community building and engagement, advocacy and service.\n\nOther local Bay Area organizations recognized for their work in the 2016 Good Food Org Guide include: HOPE Collaborative in Oakland, Dig Deep Farms & Produce in San Leandro, People’s Grocery in Oakland, City Slicker Farms in West Oakland, Ecology Center in Berkeley, Imperfect Produce in Emeryville, Food Craft Institute in Oakland, Community Food & Justice Coalition in Oakland, the Ecology Center in Berkeley, Nourish Wellness in Oakland, Food Craft Institute in Oakland, Community Food & Justice Coalition in Oakland, and Roots of Change in Oakland.\n\nIf you’re interested\n\nFor more information about Acta Non Verba, go to http://http://anvfarm.org.\n\nFor a list of organizations listed in the 2016 Good Food Org Guide, go to http://goodfoodorgguide.com."
