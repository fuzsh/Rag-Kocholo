Kana turned out to be a very popular guy with lots of adoption prospects. The Glendinning Family came to Frosted Faces looking for a new family member that was dog-friendly to join them in their new home and keep up with their active lifestyle. Kana recently celebrated his first Frostiversary and we received this update from his Family:\n\n“Happy Frostiversary to Kana formerly Jeb! For those of you unfamiliar with his back story, he was flown over from the island of Kauai to Frosted Faces for the opportunity to be adopted into a Forever home.\n\nIn Hawaiian you don’t call yourself your pet's owner, you are their Kahu.\nKahu has many meanings among them, guardian, protector, steward, and beloved attendant. Basically, someone trusted with the safekeeping of something precious something cherished. What a Kahu protects is not their property what they protect is part of their soul. From day one we knew Kana was supposed to be part of our family and he has 100% become part of our souls.\n\nThere is not one day that we are not forever grateful to Frosted Faces for bringing us together. We also want to thank Tracy Brown and Debbie Dunivan for their monthly support in Kana’s honor. It is families and people like you that make it possible for Frosted Faces to do the amazing work that they do every single day. We feel lucky and blessed to be part of the Frosted Faces family.\"\n\nThank you Toni and Kenneth for being a dedicated Family to Kana and thank you to his Fans, Tracy Brown and Debbie Dunivan, for making monthly donations in his honor.\n\nFamily: Toni and Kenneth Glendinning \nFans: Tracy Brown and Debbie Dunivan\nFacts: Kana, formerly Jeb,  is 10 years old and was rescued from Kauai Humane Society on January 23, 2023.\n\n#ffkana #frostedfaces #seniordogsrock\".",
