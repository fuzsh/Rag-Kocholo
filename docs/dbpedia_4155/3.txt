One of the best films I have seen. I hope more people find it. So much better than another Hollywood movie. This is so real.

The acting is fantastic, performances have real passion and one cannot but feel related to one or another character. You really do care about the characters in this film.

The camera-work is also very engaging and while not ground-breaking it does not become repetitive and boring. The plot unwinds in a very satisfying manner; this film just feels right. The mood reminds me a little of films like crash. I'm surprised I had not heard of it before I stumbled upon it, but then again, this is just the way things go I suppose. Lots of great movies go unnoticed.
