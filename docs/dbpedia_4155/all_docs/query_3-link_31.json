        "text": "Release: 2005\n\nLength: 75 Minutes\n\nTrailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbtheuQjyr0\n\nObligatory Pink Vehicle: Giant Bug with Pinkish Wings. Yeah, it’s weird.\n\nThe Logline: When an evil sorceress places a curse over the world of Fairytopia, Elina (AKA Barbie) is the only fairy capable of stopping the sorceress’s cunning plan.\n\nWhen I first became aware that a bookshelf-long list of Barbie cinema existed, the title that piqued my interest was, without any doubt, Barbie: Fairytopia. Unlike its predecessors, all of which are adapted from other works, Fairytopia is a wholly-new thing. It’s a new world, a new character, a new story (well… not exactly, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves).\n\nThe notion that Barbie was a fitting vehicle for transmitting fairy tales to children was already racking my brain. But now, with Fairytopia, we have a fairy tale that exists solely at the pleasure of Barbie. It is a tale that would remain untold had not a doll overtaken CGI Direct-to-DVD distribution.\n\n“Why this one?” I asked, to no one in particular, “If this is your first shot to tell an original Barbie story, why throw Barbie into a generic fairy costume? Why not something that fits her more closely? Something human? Something real?”\n\nThen I remembered Steamboat Willie was about a mouse who drove a boat, so I guess when it comes to animation, all bets are off. Up is down. And nobody knows anything.\n\nYou can do whatever you want, essentially. Including wasting a perfectly good opportunity to do something exciting, experimental, or subversive with the Barbie character.\n\nSo here we are: Barbie’s 2005 entry, co-directed by William Lau (of Princess & The Pauper fame) and newcomer Walter P. Martishius. It’s a seventy-five-minute adventure that rustles no feathers, offers no substance, and fires from the hip with pure, inoffensive, vanilla blandness.\n\nTHE STORY\n\nBarbie plays a fairy named Elina in the world of Fairytopia. Unlike other fairies, Elina never got her wings. Nobody knows why, but that’s reason enough to pick on her, which the other fairies do with reckless abandon. She’s kind of like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.\n\nMeanwhile, Laverna, an evil sorceress, has devised a way of taking over the world once and for all. She has her henchmen toss magical green gas into the sky; any fairies who happen to inhale will find themselves too weak to travel. If Laverna can “ground” all the fairies and “Fairy Guardians” (AKA fairies with magic necklaces), Laverna can easily march her way to victory and claim the throne.\n\nWhat Laverna didn’t expect was that there’d be a physically disabled fairy like Barbie! With the other winged pixies knocked out of commission, Barbie treks through woods, caves, towns, and rivers to locate Laverna and put an end to her crazy takeover plot.\n\nLong story short, Barbie finds Laverna in a Cactus Castle, frees the Fairy Guardians and is given her wings as a token of good faith. Fairytopia is safe once more thanks to the help of a fairy reject who learned a little something about friendship, bravery, and being herself!\n\nTHE TAKE\n\nBarbie: Fairytopia is unapologetic about its influences, and that includes a movie from the Barbie cinema series, Barbie in the Nutcracker. Like that film, this is essentially a road movie. Barbie is surrounded by a cast of increasingly stranger characters all in the name of tracking down the evil doer at picture’s center.\n\nIn some ways, it improves upon Nutcracker. The environments in Nutcracker were dull and oft-nonsensical from a geographic standpoint. You had little sense of being any closer or further away from the Rat King’s fortress as the film progressed. This nagging issue made it difficult to engage with the quest, because we were as clueless as Barbie’s foolish ingenue. We just sort of trusted that by the end of Act 2, we’d get there.\n\nCompare that to the venturing in Fairytopia. Though there is much to gripe about (see The Visuals), the various environments Barbie and her gang trek through have a natural evolution to them. Danger leads to more danger and so on until we’re inside a Cactus Castle. It seems this film should be thanking The Lord of the Rings trilogy, which it bares much resemblance to. An unlikely groundling blessed with a much-sought token? Trekking to the most dangerous place of all in the name of destroying it? Why, we’re a gollum shy from a straight-up knock-off. Though this obnoxious fuzz ball might be a good substitute:\n\nOn the other hand, as has been noted by others, Barbie in the Nutcracker had the audacity to include characters one wouldn’t expect to see in a Barbie animated movie (AKA ugly people). Meanwhile, in Barbie: Fairytopia, the rules of attraction are set: if you’re a bad person, you’re a goblin or a witch with a terrible hair-do. If you’re good, you’re either foxy, handsome, or cute as a button. Even the Giant Bug that flies Barbie around could be mistaken for a Beanie Baby. This is a terrible message for children and on a visual standpoint, it’s terribly dull. In a movie that’s supposed to be about accepting who you are, you’d think they’d try to force Barbie into trusting someone who didn’t look like a Pokemon reject or a mascot for a children’s cereal.\n\nFairytopia is atrociously paced. Barbie’s character, Elina, spends well over half the film trying to find someone else to fix the problem before finally accepting her position as hero. Meanwhile, the viewer is already well aware of Laverna’s evil plan and patiently waits for Barbie to catch up. A better film would have put the stress on Barbie earlier or started the entire story much later. My guess is Fairytopia didn’t have much story to begin with. It’s stretched pretty thin for seventy-five minutes as is. In fact, Fairytopia makes me think of the second half of the Paul Greengrass 2010 Iraq War film, Green Zone. In both cases, we follow a surprisingly dull protagonist who is wholly (and unconvincingly) consumed with a single motivation: get to Point B. There is no subplot, there is no breathing room to flesh out the characters. There is only “the mission.”\n\nThis technique didn’t work in Green Zone, and it doesn’t work here. It comes down to pure laziness on the writers’ behalf. All we’re asking is that Elina be given something else to accomplish during the tenure of her journey. It could be related (think the plotting of The Wizard of Oz) or it could be unrelated (think the start-and-go structure of Vacation). The important thing is that we learn more about our heroes and we strengthen the theme.\n\nPerhaps the biggest blunder in Barbie: Fairytopia is the way in which they handle the Barbie character, Elina. Besides being harmlessly nagged on in the opening scene, Elina is never punished. Her travels seem scary and feel dangerous, but rarely does danger make good on its promises. In any film, in any story, it’s important that protagonists earn their rewards. That means putting the protagonist through hell before reaching the climax. Fairytopia does nothing of the sort. The only moment Barbie is close to punishment is when she’s told to eat seaweed so she can breathe underwater (no joke). But then, we don’t get to see her eat it! What a wasted opportunity.\n\nNo, I don’t have a thing for Barbie dolls eating seaweed. I just wanted to see Barbie get kicked out a bit. Don’t we all? Clearly, the whole idea behind these movies is to make Barbie seem relateable to the average little girl or boy. There’s no better way to do that than to put the lady through the mud, but you won’t find that here.\n\nI have to say I missed the musical numbers featured so liberally in Barbie in the Princess & The Pauper. Not because I wanted to hear Barbie sing again, but because the numbers gave me opportunities to stop paying attention to the movie until the characters came back to reality. No such luck here. Just straight-up, non-stop trailblazing.\n\nTHE MESSAGE\n\nFairytopia explores the same old themes we’ve seen in Barbie movies many times before: be yourself! Be happy with what you are! And don’t worry about being weird; someday, everyone will see that there’s a real live rainbow in your eye and that means you’re destined for great things! (Yes, that’s what Barbie learns in this movie.)\n\nLike Barbie of Swan Lake, this title offers nothing of thematic weight. It makes frail promises to underage viewers about how special they are and how important they’ll become. Fairytopia doesn’t even ask Barbie to see the good in somebody else. Once again, she’s a morally perfect player in a world of simple lessons.\n\nThere is something slightly interested about Laverna’s magical green gas. In a way, it makes me think this movie might have an anti-drug moral lurking beneath the surface. Here you have a girl who never gets to have any fun because she’s different. The other girls hang out, fly around (AKA get high), and pick on the loser. However, when a bad batch of Laverna’s gas hits the skies, the fairies are out of commission. Only the straight-laced Barbie can save them now!\n\nUnfortunately, if that was intended, the film undermines itself in the final scene. There, post-climax, Barbie is rewarded with wings after all. So now… she can get high, too? I don’t see what’s learned here. Even tossing the drug morals aside, the whole movie was about how she never needed wings to be herself. She’s better without them! No matter what the intended message was, giving her wings negates it.\n\nMaybe the message is this: boys, girls, men, women – we all want what we can’t have. And we’ll say we don’t want it, and act like we don’t care about it, but as soon as it’s actually offered to us, we will throw our friends under a bus and our principles out the window to take it. Barbie’s no different, and neither is any bratty kid who nagged his mom or dad into buying this movie from Best Buy in the first place.\n\nTHE VISUALS\n\nClearly, the computer graphics have been overhauled for Fairytopia. Let’s call these graphic models “Barbie 2.0”. I appreciate that Fairytopia features a wider array of character types than in previous films. However, they all look decidedly inferior. That’s much more obvious with the non-human characters for sure. Bibble the fuzz ball and Hue the Giant Bug could’ve been designed by a freshman animation student with a weekend to kill.\n\nMattel has all but given up on rendering backgrounds. They’re almost entirely 2D in this film. It didn’t really bother me, because at least it was consistent. Still, nothing says “super-low-budget” like 2D graphics in a 3D movie. What is the animation equivalent of a boom mic falling into frame? Part of me really wants to see whatever that is happen. But then, anything out of the ordinary would be a welcome change of pace in a Barbie movie.\n\nOVERALL RATING\n\nFor the next 12-13 Barbie films, this will be a new feature to make the films a little easier to compare to one another.\n\nStory: 3/10 Barbie Heads\n\nCharacter Development: 1/10 Barbie Heads\n\nProduction Value: 3/10 Barbie Heads\n\nTheme: 0/10 Barbie Heads\n\nLasting Contributions to Feminism: 0/10 Barbie Heads\n\nOverall: 7/50 Barbie Heads\n\nNEXT UP\n\nTaking a week off so I can actually watch films that I’ll like. But then, on Sunday 5/2, we’re back with more Barbie!"
