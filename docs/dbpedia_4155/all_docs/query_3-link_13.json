        "text": "2004 American film\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless MindDirected byMichel Gondry Screenplay byCharlie KaufmanStory by\n\nMichel Gondry\n\nCharlie Kaufman\n\nPierre Bismuth\n\nProduced byStarringCinematographyEllen KurasEdited byValdís ÓskarsdóttirMusic byJon Brion\n\nProduction\n\ncompanies\n\nDistributed byFocus Features\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n108 minutesCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishBudget$20 millionBox office$74 million\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a 2004 American science fiction romantic drama film directed by Michel Gondry, based on Charlie Kaufman's screenplay developed from a story by Gondry, Kaufman, and Pierre Bismuth. Starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, along with supporting roles from Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, and Tom Wilkinson, it follows two individuals who undergo a memory erasure procedure to forget each other after the dissolution of their romantic relationship. The title of the film is a quotation from the 1717 poem Eloisa to Abelard by Alexander Pope. It uses elements of psychological drama, science fiction, and a nonlinear narrative to explore the nature of memory and love.[1]\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind opened in theaters in the United States on March 19, 2004, to widespread acclaim from critics and audiences, who hailed the visual style, editing, writing, score, themes, Gondry’s direction, and the performances of the cast, especially Carrey and Winslet. The film was a box office success, grossing $74 million on a $20 million budget, and was named by the American Film Institute one of the Top 10 Films of 2004.[2] At the 77th Academy Awards, Bismuth, Gondry and Kaufman won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, and Winslet received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nIn the years since its release, the film has become a cult classic;[3] it is considered by many publications as one of the best films of the 21st century.[4][5] The film has been the inspiration behind several music projects, such as Jay Electronica's 2007 piece \"Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge)\", Bastille’s 2022 single \"Remind Me\" and Ariana Grande's 2024 album Eternal Sunshine.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nJoel Barish discovers that his estranged girlfriend, Clementine Kruczynski, has undergone a procedure to have her memories of him erased by the New York City firm Lacuna. Heartbroken, he decides to undergo the same procedure. In preparation, he records a tape recounting his memories of their volatile relationship.\n\nThe Lacuna employees work on Joel's brain as he sleeps in his apartment so that he will wake up with no memory of the procedure. One employee, Patrick, leaves to see Clementine. Since her procedure, he has been using Joel's and Clementine's memories as a guide for seducing her. While the procedure runs on Joel's brain, the technician, Stan, and the secretary, Mary, take drugs, party and have sex.\n\nJoel re-experiences his memories of Clementine as they are erased, starting with their last fight. As he reaches earlier, happier memories, he realizes that he does not want to forget her. His mental projection of Clementine suggests that Joel hides her in memories that do not involve her. This halts the procedure, but Stan calls his boss, Howard, who arrives and restarts it. Joel comes to his last remaining memory of Clementine: the day they first met, on a beach in Montauk. As the memory crumbles around them, Clementine tells Joel to meet her in Montauk.\n\nIn Joel's apartment, while Stan is outside, Mary tells Howard she is in love with him and they kiss. Howard's wife arrives and sees them through the window. Furious, she tells Howard to tell Mary the truth: that Mary and Howard previously had an affair, and that Mary had her memories erased. Disgusted, Mary steals the Lacuna records and mails them to the patients, including Joel and Clementine.\n\nJoel wakes up, his memories of Clementine erased. He impulsively goes to Montauk and accidentally meets Clementine on the train ride home. They are drawn to one another, and go on a date to the frozen Charles River in Boston. Joel drives Clementine home and Patrick sees the two of them, realizing they have found each other again. Joel and Clementine receive their Lacuna records and listen to their tapes. They are shocked by the bitter memories they had of each other and almost separate again, but agree to try again.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nJim Carrey as Joel Barish: A bookish introvert who enters a two-year relationship with Clementine Kruczynski. After their relationship ends, Clementine erases Joel from her memory, and he erases her from his mind in response. Charlie Kaufman depicted Joel with some of his autobiographical personality traits.[6] Producers cast Carrey against type for his role as Joel,[6] selecting him for his everyday appearance, as well as his comedic ability. According to Gondry, this was because \"It's hard to be funny. It's far easier to take someone really funny and bring them down than do the opposite.\"[7] To induce Carrey, an actor who typically portrayed high-energy roles, to portray a restrained character, Gondry would not allow him to improvise, a restriction he did not place on the other cast members (Carrey objected).[8] Gondry also put Carrey off balance by giving misleading orders or by rolling the camera at the wrong time. Gondry believed this would make Carrey forget what he should do to be Joel, allowing him to go in character.[6] In the 2017 Netflix documentary Jim & Andy, Carrey mentions a conversation with Gondry one year before shooting began for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, shortly after Carrey had a breakup with an unspecified woman.[9] Gondry saw that Carrey's emotional state at the time was \"so beautiful, so broken\" that he asked him to stay that way for one year to fit the character. In the documentary, Carrey commented, \"That's how fucked up this business is.\"[10][11] Nicolas Cage was Gondry's original choice to play Joel,[8] but Cage was unavailable as he was in high demand from independent directors after his performance in Leaving Las Vegas.[7]\n\nKate Winslet as Clementine Kruczynski: A spontaneous extrovert who, after breaking up with him after a two-year relationship, erases Joel Barish from her mind. Producers cast Winslet against type for her part as Clementine,[6] as Winslet had previously featured heavily in period pieces.[12] She received the role after she was the only actress to offer criticism on the script instead of pandering to the writers.[7] After another actress won an Oscar, the studio attempted to make Gondry use her instead of Winslet for the role of Clementine, but Gondry threatened to walk from the project if that occurred.[7] During filming, Gondry took Winslet to a separate room to coach her,[7] and she wore wigs instead of dying her hair.[12] Some commentators note how Clementine's character criticizes the Manic Pixie Dream Girl stock character several years before film critic Nathan Rabin coined the phrase.[13] Most commentators discuss one particular example to demonstrate this criticism, wherein Clementine warns Joel she is flawed: \"Too many guys think I'm a concept, or I complete them, or I'm gonna make them alive. But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.\"[14][15] With her impulsiveness, emotional intensity (extreme mood changes), alcohol consumption, turbulent relationships, reckless behavior, and hasty idealization or devaluation of Joel, Clementine seems to exhibit traits of borderline personality disorder, although it is not clear whether Kaufman wrote her character with this specific diagnosis in mind.[16] Gondry had earlier thought of casting Björk for the role of Clementine. She feared she would be emotionally affected and rejected the invitation after reading the script.[17]\n\nKirsten Dunst as Mary Svevo: The receptionist for Lacuna who, while dating Stan Fink, has a crush on Howard Mierzwiak. While erasing Joel's memory, Howard's wife catches her kissing Howard. Howard's wife reveals Mary previously had a relationship with Howard, which Howard erased from her mind. She reacts to this information by quitting her job and mailing Lacuna's company records to its customers. In the script, Mary and Howard's relationship resulted in an unplanned pregnancy, leading to Howard pressuring Mary into an abortion, which Howard also erased from her memory.[18]\n\nMark Ruffalo as Stan Fink: A technician for Lacuna who is in a relationship with Mary Svevo until the reveal of her previous relationship with Howard Mierzwiak. Ruffalo received the role of Stan after providing an \"unexpected take on the role\" to Gondry when he suggested Stan be a fan of the Clash and resemble Joe Strummer.[7]\n\nElijah Wood as Patrick Wertz: Patrick is a technician for Lacuna who enters a relationship with Clementine by imitating Joel. They break up when Joel and Clementine begin dating for the second time. Seth Rogen auditioned for the role.[19]\n\nTom Wilkinson as Dr. Howard Mierzwiak: Howard runs Lacuna. Before the film's events, he had an affair with Mary, which ended with the relationship's erasure from her mind. Wilkinson reportedly did not enjoy the shooting of the film and clashed with Gondry.[7][20]\n\nJane Adams as Carrie Eakin: Joel Barish's friend. She is in a troubled relationship with Rob Eakin.\n\nDavid Cross as Rob Eakin: Joel Barish's friend. In a troubled relationship with Carrie Eakin.\n\nDeirdre O'Connell as Hollis Mierzwiak: Howard Mierzwiak's wife\n\nThomas Jay Ryan as Frank: Joel Barish's neighbor\n\nDebbon Ayer as Joel Barish's mother\n\nEllen Pompeo as Naomi, Joel Barish's girlfriend (deleted scene)\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nDevelopment\n\n[edit]\n\nThe concept of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind came from conversations between director Michel Gondry and co-writer Pierre Bismuth in 1998.[21] The pair had met and become friends in the early 1980s during Gondry's drumming career in the French pop group Oui Oui.[22] Bismuth had conceived of the idea of erasing certain people from people's minds in response to a friend complaining about her boyfriend; when he asked her if she would erase that boyfriend from her memory, she said yes.[22][23] Bismuth originally planned to conduct an art experiment involving sending cards to people saying someone they knew had erased the card's recipient from their memory.[24] When he mentioned this to Gondry, they developed it into a story based on the situations that would arise if it were scientifically possible.[22][24] Bismuth never carried out his experiment idea.[24]\n\nGondry approached writer Charlie Kaufman with this concept,[23][24] and they developed it into a short pitch.[25] While the writers did not believe the concept was marketable, a small bidding war began over the idea.[21][25][26] Steve Golin of Propaganda Films purchased it on June 12, 1998, for a low seven-figure sum.[6][27] Kaufman, who was responsible for writing the screenplay, did not begin immediately, instead opting to suspend writing while he was working on Adaptation, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and Human Nature, the last of which Gondry directed as his directorial debut.[21]\n\nDuring this time, filmmaker Christopher Nolan released his film Memento (2000), which similarly deals with memory. Due to the similarities, Kaufman became worried and tried to pull out of the project, but Golin made him complete it.[6] During writing, the pitch's ownership changed several times resulting in Kaufman not having to deal with the studios until the end of the scriptwriting process.[21] The final script made the studios nervous.[21]\n\nHow happy is the blameless vestal's lot!\n\nThe world forgetting, by the world forgot:\n\nEternal sunshine of the spotless mind!\n\nEach prayer accepted, and each wish resigned;\n\nAlexander Pope, Eloisa to Abelard, lines 207–210\n\nKaufman did not want to make the film a thriller and wanted to downplay the science fiction aspects of memory erasure, focusing on the relationship.[21][24][26] He had an \"enormous struggle\" while writing the script, particularly encountering two problems: showing \"the memories, Joel's reactions to the memories, and Joel interacting with Clementine outside of the memories in the memories,\" and the fact that characters could refer in later scenes to already erased memories.[21]\n\nKaufman resolved the first problem by making Joel lucid and able to comment on his memories and solved the second by making the memories degrade instead of immediately erasing, with complete erasure occurring at awakening.[21] Kaufman's original name for the screenplay was 18 words long, as he had wanted a title that \"you couldn't possibly fit on a marquee.\"[28] He eventually decided on Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, a title originating from the 1717 poem Eloisa to Abelard by Alexander Pope.[29]\n\n1968 French film Je t'aime, je t'aime directed by Alain Resnais has been cited as an influence on the film.[30][31]\n\nFilming and post-production\n\n[edit]\n\nThe shooting of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind began in mid-January 2003 after six weeks of preparation,[32][33][34] lasting for three months on a budget of $20 million mostly in and around New York City.[8][34] The film was shot on Fuji Reala 500D.[34] The production crew recreated some key scenes, such as Joel's Rockville Centre apartment and the 1950s-style kitchen, in a New Jersey former U.S. Navy base.[34] The shoot was difficult, sometimes shooting for 17 hours per day in harsh environments.[35]\n\nThe shoot was challenging for cinematographer Ellen Kuras, due to the difficulty of filming Gondry's vision for the film, which aimed to \"blend location-shoot authenticity with unpredictable flashes of whimsy\". According to this vision, Gondry wanted available light used exclusively for the shoot. Kuras disagreed and worked around this idea by lighting the room instead of the actors and by hiding light bulbs around the set to increase light levels.[34] Another issue the cinematographers encountered was that due to the frequent improvisation, the lack of marks and the few rehearsals completed, the cinematographers often did not know where the actors would be. Two handheld cameras filmed near 360-degree footage at all times, shooting 36,000 feet of film a day to deal with this.[20][34] Gondry called back to the work of French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard by filming using wheelchairs as well as using sled and chariot dollies instead of traditional dollies. When using wheelchairs, the shot was not consistently smooth; however, as Kuras liked the aesthetic of the low-angle, wobbly movement, the final film contains the footage.[34]\n\nThe film used minimal CGI, with many effects accomplished in-camera, through forced perspectives, hidden space, spotlighting, unsynchronized sound, split focus and continuity editing.[24] A notable example is the ocean washing away the house in Montauk; the production team accomplished this by building the corner of a house on the beach and allowing the tide to rise.[8] Executing this effect was difficult, as the special team hired to place the set in the water refused due to perceived dangers. In response, Gondry fired the team and had the production team, including the actors and producers, place the set in the water. In retaliation for Gondry's actions, the chief of the union reprimanded Gondry in front of the crew.[36]\n\nKaufman rewrote some of the script during production; thus, several differences exist between the production script and the final film.[25] A fundamental difference is that in the production script, with the erasure of each memory, Clementine's behavior is increasingly robotic.[21] In the final film, Winslet plays Clementine straight, and degradation of settings and the intrusion of settings upon each other establish memory degradation visually. Another script component that did not make it into the final film was the appearance of Naomi, Joel's girlfriend, played by Ellen Pompeo. Against Kaufman's insistence on Naomi's inclusion, the production team cut her already filmed scenes.[21] Tracy Morgan was also cut from the film.[37]\n\nIcelandic editor Valdís Óskarsdóttir edited the film, and she reportedly clashed with Gondry during editing.[38] Kaufman was also very involved in the editing of the film. Editing was a long process as there was no requirement to rush it.[6][25] There were a few test screenings of the film, which elicited positive reactions.[25]\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nThe soundtrack album for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was composed by American musician Jon Brion, also featuring songs from artists including The Polyphonic Spree, The Willowz, and Don Nelson. Hollywood Records released the soundtrack in March of 2004.[39] A cover version of The Korgis' \"Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime\" with instrumentation by Brion and vocals by Beck operates as the soundtrack's centerpiece, setting the film's tone in the opening credits, and closing the film.[39][40]\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's soundtrack received generally positive reviews. AllMusic described it as \"nearly as deft\", and described Brion's score as \"intimate\" and \"evocative of love and memories\".[41] Other positive reviews noted the ambient nature of the music and lauded Beck's cover of \"Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime\".[42] The soundtrack's detractors criticized the album's lack of identity and its depressive atmosphere.[43] Even among the detractors, the score's ability to mesh with the plot was lauded, an appraisal common to many reviews.[41][42][43][44]\n\nAnalysis\n\n[edit]\n\nAuthor Carol Vernallis, writing in Screen, argued that Gondry's experience in directing music videos contributed to the film's mise-en-scène and sound design. Vernallis describes some threads of the visual, aural, and musical motifs throughout the film, and how some motifs can work in counterpoint.[45]\n\nPhilosopher Christopher Grau, in The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism, discussed how he perceived the film to have its own defined philosophy, beyond addressing ideas of a philosophical nature.[46]\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has been aligned with a greater inspection, distinctly related to the 21st century, of memory, longing and nostalgia in science fiction films like Code 46 and 2046. The film showcases memory as fragmented and unreliable, evident by its non-linear structure.[47]\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nProduced on a budget of $20 million, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind opened on March 19, 2004, in the United States, earning $8.2 million in its opening weekend from 1,353 theaters. The film placed seventh in the weekend's box office, and remained in theaters for 19 weeks, earning $34.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $39.6 million in international markets, for a total of $74 million worldwide.[48]\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 92% based on 257 reviews, with an average score of 8.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Propelled by Charlie Kaufman's smart, imaginative script and Michel Gondry's equally daring directorial touch, Eternal Sunshine is a twisty yet heartfelt look at relationships and heartache.\"[49] On Metacritic, the film has a score of 89 out of 100, based on 41 reviews.[50] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B−\" on an A+ to F scale.[51]\n\nRoger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times in his initial 2004 review gave the film three and a half out of four.[52] He revisited the film in 2010 when he referred to Kaufman as \"the most gifted screenwriter of the 2000s\" and revised the rating to a full four out of four, adding it to his \"Great Movies\" list.[53] A. O. Scott of The New York Times praised the film for being \"cerebral, formally and conceptually complicated, dense with literary allusions and as unabashedly romantic as any movie you'll ever see\".[54] Time Out summed up their review by saying, \"the formidable Gondry/Kaufman/Carrey/Winslet axis works marvel after marvel in expressing the bewildering beauty and existential horror of being trapped inside one's own addled mind, and in allegorising the self-preserving amnesia of a broken but hopeful heart\".[55] In 2017, The New York Times ranked the film as the 24th best film of the 21st Century so far.[56]\n\nWinslet and Carrey received widespread praise for their performances. Winslet's as Clementine received multiple award nominations, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress,[57] a BAFTA nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role[58] and a Golden Globe Award nomination.[59] Premiere magazine placed her performance 81st in their 2008 list of the 100 Greatest Performances of All Time.[60] Claudia Puig in a review for USA Today said of her performance \"Winslet is wonderful as a free spirit whose hair color changes along with her moods. She hasn't had such a meaty role in a while, and she plays it just right\".[61]\n\nAnn Hornaday in a review for The Washington Post said \"Even when forced to wear costumes and wigs that make her look like Pippi Longstocking after an acid-fueled trip to the thrift market, Winslet maintains a reassuring equilibrium. It takes an actor of her steadiness to play someone this unhinged.\"[62]\n\nCarrey's performance as Joel also received multiple award nominations, including a BAFTA nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role[58] and a Golden Globe Award nomination.[59] Many reviewers noted his casting against type. Jason Killingsworth in a review for Paste magazine said of his performance \"Carrey nails the part, winning audience sympathy from the opening moments of the film\".[63]\n\nMoira MacDonald in a review for The Seattle Times stated \"[Jim Carrey is] not bad at all — in fact, it's the most honest, vulnerable work he's ever done\",[64] while David Edelstein of Slate said \"It's rarely a compliment when I refer to an actor as \"straitjacketed\", but the straitjacketing of Jim Carrey is fiercely poignant.
