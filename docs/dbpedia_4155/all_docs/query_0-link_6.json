        "text": "DVD Releases for March 20, 2007\n\nMarch 20th, 2007\n\nIt's a busy week for DVDs, and it's even busier next week. Not only are the overall numbers high, the quality is good too, with several films from last year's award season / holiday rush coming to the home market. One of these films, Rocky Balboa - Buy from Amazon, was a serious contender for DVD Pick of the Week, as was a TV on DVD release, NewsRadio - The Complete Fifth Season - Buy from Amazon. But in the end I went with a cult classic that more people should experience, Re-Animator - Limited Edition - Buy from Amazon. More...\n\nWar Ends World Tour with a Blast\n\nSeptember 4th, 2005\n\nWar of the Worlds opened in its last international market over the weekend making $3.0 million on 583 screens in China. That's about 10% more money that Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith earned, but War of the Worlds needed nearly double the number of screens. Overall the film added $4.5 million to its $345 million international total, easily the second best of the year so far. More...\n\nSmiths' Summer Tour Continues\n\nAugust 14th, 2005\n\nMr. and Mrs. Smith opened in Belgium with $1.7 million on 80 screens, easily enough for first place and had a similar result with $480,000 in Poland. It also remained in first place in France with $2.88 million, (despite falling 54% there) and in the Netherlands with $740,000. In Germany the film remained in second place for the third straight week with $3.06 million for a $17.06 million running tally. The film now have $140 million in territories where Fox is handling the distribution and $192 million overall. More...\n\nIsland Vacation\n\nAugust 7th, 2005\n\nThe Island managed a couple of first place finished over the weekend, but the results were still less than impressive. In Australia the film opened with $1.404 million for a close victory while in Hong Kong it earned a disappointing $490,000 over the weekend and $520,000 including previews. It's best market continued to be South Korea with $3.167 million, down 38% from last weekend dropping to second place along the way. On the other hand, no wide openings and a mere 23% drop-off allowed the film to rise to first in New Zealand. Overall the film added $7.64 million to its $24.1 million running tally on the international scene and will opens in several markets this weekend including the U.K., Germany and Spain. More...\n\nLate Numbers Lift Charlie into Top Five\n\nJuly 31st, 2005\n\nEarly numbers had Mr. and Mrs. Smith taking fifth place on the overall international box office charts, but better than expected results has Charlie and the Chocolate Factory overtaking them $6.7 million to $5.4 million. It's biggest single market continues to be France where the film dipped just 6% during its second weekend there earning $3,533,857 for a $9,034,141 running tally. But it was even more impressive in Belgium where the film shot up by 68% to $400,000 for the weekend and $785,000 in total. The film also opened in first place in three markets, Brazil with $1.1 million on 200 screens, Holland with $625,000 on 124 screens, and South Africa with $275,000 on 41 screens. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has $13.3 million so far and opens in a couple of important markets this weekend, (The U.K. and Mexico.) More...\n\nCharlie Appeals to the Sweet-tooth in its International Debut\n\nJuly 24th, 2005\n\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory opened in three French speaking markets over the weekend and while it didn't finish first, it still had a great start. In France the film earned $3,741,793 in 670 theaters for the best per theater average in the top ten. The result was similar in Belgium ($250,000) and Switzerland ($190,000), giving the film $4.2 million for the weekend. More...\n\nHitch Can't Help Home Market\n\nJune 25th, 2005\n\nDespite an amazing performance by Hitch, the home market is still suffering. This is no real surprise since the home market mirrors the theatrical market, just with a roughly four-month delay. Opening as a clear number one, Hitch brought in $12.62 million in combined rentals split $11.54 million / $1.09 million DVD / VHS. Saleswise, the film also finished first, but no sales figures were published. More...\n\nHome Market Cools - Updated\n\nJune 18th, 2005\n\nBe Cool opened atop a depressed home market $9.61 million in combined rentals. The film also topped the DVD sales charts, which is welcome relief to the studio after the film's disappointing theatrical box office. More...\n\nAviator Shoots Down Competition\n\nJune 11th, 2005\n\nIt was a slow week for new releases and what little competition there was couldn't stop The Aviator from holding onto top spot on the Home Rental Charts. Its combined total of $7.76 million was a sharp drop-off from last week, but even so the film is doing well enough on the home market that is will soon show modest profit. More...\n\nAviator Soars onto the Home Market\n\nJune 4th, 2005\n\nThe multi-Oscar winning movie, The Aviator won the week at the home market, which really surprised no one. The film topped both the DVD rentals with $10.14 million and the VHS rentals with $1.21 million for a combined total of $11.36 million. On the other hand, it came in second on the sales charts to the record breaking The Chappelle Show Season 2. More...\n\nDVD Releases for May 24, 2005\n\nMay 23rd, 2005\n\nEvery week films get a second chance at success from the home market; or, in some cases, a first chance at success. Here is a list of wide releases, limited releases, classics and a few from the growing TV on DVD section. It's another great week with several great choices, NewsRadio - The Complete First & Second Seasons - Buy from Amazon and The Job - The Complete Series - Buy from Amazon, for instance. The Aviator - Buy from Amazon will please most people, it just left me cold while Chappelle's Show - Season 2 - Uncensored - Buy from Amazon will please many, and offend even more. More...\n\nBaby Still Earning Millions\n\nMarch 27th, 2005\n\nMillion Dollar Baby has again slipped off the radar screen, but we do know it hit $52 million internationally, which means it made $9 million during the week. The film didn't earn $1 million in any single market, but is still doing strong in South Korea, ($970,000), Spain, ($840,000), Italy, ($600,000) and Australia, ($350,000.) Best estimate has the film earning just shy of $5 million of that over the weekend and taking sixth place on the international box office charts. More...\n\nBaby Takes Fifth in Close Race\n\nMarch 20th, 2005\n\nAfter gathering in all the data the winner for the race for fifth place is Million Dollar Baby, I think. It would need to lost more than 40% from last week's total and that's not taking into account its openings in South Korea at $1,515,672 and second place, its $110,000, third place debut in Finland, $86,000 in Russia, $50,000, second place debut in Hong Kong. Unfortunately, exact weekend totals are unknown but it is estimated at $6 million raising its international total to $43 million so far. More...\n\nSwimming with Sharks\n\nMarch 13th, 2005\n\nShark Tale finished its international run with a second place $2.08 million opening in Japan on 485 screens. Its $4,296 per screen average it quite low for the market and generally means the film won't have the usual legs films in Japan have. The film performed much better in Italy where it finished first again with $3.0 million, down just 23% during its sophomore stint. Overall it took in $5.2 million to raise its international total to $181 million, but without any more openings it might struggle to hit $200 million. More...\n\nThe Aviator Soars Higher than Before\n\nMarch 6th, 2005\n\nThe Aviator beat weekend estimates by a substantial margin leading to a $5.9 million box office on 3000 screens in 34 markets. The multi-Oscar winning movie has hit $86.2 million internationally and will cross $200 million worldwide before too long. The film dropped a spot to fifth place in South Korea with $834,660 for the week and slipped to second in Australia with $798,000. The only market the film opened it was Argentina, where it easily took top spot with $232,000. More...\n\nTwelve Tops the Best of the Rest\n\nFebruary 27th, 2005\n\nOcean's Twelve may have dropped out of the top five, but it is still going strong with $4.5 million on 1400 screens in 35 markets for an international box office of $225.8 million so far. No new openings means the heist film had to rely on holdovers likes its $2.5 million during its third weekend in the U.K. and $1.4 million during its fifth week of release in Japan, finishing second in both those markets. More...\n\nFrench Film Finishes Fifth\n\nFebruary 20th, 2005\n\nIznogoud: Calife a la place du calife, a movie based on a Asterix and Obelix spin off of sorts, dominated the French box office taking in $7.1 million, more than double the second place film and more than a third of the top ten total. It is also enough to push it into the Top Five on the international scene, dropping Finding Neverland into sixth place. Unfortunately, like the several films made in the Asterix and Obelix series, this one is unlikely to make much of an impact outside the French speaking markets. More...\n\nTight Presidential Race\n\nFebruary 18th, 2005\n\nPresidents' Day Long Weekend isn't the busiest holiday of the year, but it should give a boost to the box office nonetheless. Looking at the reviews of the three new releases, this weekend is going to need a boost. More...\n\nSmith and Sony Feeling a Lot of Love\n\nFebruary 14th, 2005\n\nValentine's Day brought a lot of love to both Will Smith and Sony, as records were set. This led to a massive 16.6% increase from last weekend, however, the box office was down 3.6% from last year. But the latter comparison isn't completely accurate since this time last year was the President's Day Long Weekend. Year to date 2005 is up on 2004 by 9%, but before the industry starts to celebrate, 2004 got off to a very slow start before taking off mid-way through the month, so the race is far from over. More...\n\nHooking Up\n\nFebruary 11th, 2005\n\nIt's Valentine's Day weekend, sort of. Valentine's Day is actually on Monday, but I don't think that's going to stop a lot of people from seeing a date movie this weekend. With that extra boost we should have a first mega-hit of the year as romantic comedies should reign supreme. More...\n\nSuper Bowl doesn't Stunt the Weekend Box Office\n\nFebruary 7th, 2005\n\nWith two new releases going up against the media juggernaut that is the Super Bowl, everyone was expecting at least one movie to flop hard, but that didn't happen. Granted, the weekend box office was down 16.8% from last weekend, but that wasn't as steep a drop as expected. Comparisons to last year are a less accurate as Super Bowl happened a weekend earlier. Compared the last year this weekend was down 8.3%, but compared to last Super Bowl weekend, it was up 8.0% More...\n\nThis Weekend Looks Anything But Super\n\nFebruary 4th, 2005\n\nSuper Bowl weekend is usually a horror story for theaters as most people stay at home to watch the game, or at least soak in the hype surrounding the game. The big game is such a threat to the box office that the Super Bowl Weekend is historically the third worst weekend of the year, (the Post Labor Day and Post Thanksgiving weekends being numbers one and two respectively). This year, two films are being released with two different strategies for success. More...\n\nI Guess that Snowstorm Really did Hurt the Box Office\n\nJanuary 31st, 2005\n\nJanuary ended on an amazing note, with most of the top five beating expectations. This led to huge increases of 26.4% from last weekend and 29.6% from last year. But there is some bad news. Firstly, last weekend the box office was pushed down because of the snowstorm and secondly, last year the box office was pushed down because of the Super Bowl. However, even taking those into account this was still a good weekend, and 2005 is off to a great start - up more than 12%, for an early $75 million lead on 2004. More...\n\nJanuary Ends on a Scary Note\n\nJanuary 28th, 2005\n\nTwo new Horror movies open this weekend. However, the scariest part about the films could be their Rotten Tomatoes scores, as they are currently earning just 13 and 65. On the plus side, several Oscar Nominated films are earning serious expansions and should figure in the top five. More...\n\nUnder the Weather\n\nJanuary 24th, 2005\n\nA massive snowstorm hit the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and New England over the weekend, and while we're usually skeptical about the effects weather patterns have on the box office, this was a particularly widespread storm. Even so, it alone cannot explain the 29.3% drop from last weekend, even after taking into account the post-holiday drop-off. Comparing this weekend to last year we see a much smaller 3.4% drop. More...\n\nNothing Golden About the Wide Releases\n\nJanuary 21st, 2005\n\nThe weekend after the Golden Globe Awards will not be remembered for the high quality of the new releases. With most of the awards going to smaller films, the awards probably won't have any impact on the top five. In fact, there probably won't be any change at the top spot and only one change in the top five. More...\n\nMovie Websites Launches for January 14 - January 20\n\nJanuary 20th, 2005\n\nDuring the past week promotional websites for several movies were launched and some older ones added additional content. Here the list of this week's releases, a couple of new sites and few updates, including this week's winner, Fantastic Four - Official Site. If you know of any new movie websites not on this list feel free to e-mail me with the details. More...\n\n2005 Preview: January\n\nJanuary 1st, 2005\n\nJanuary is one of two main dumping grounds for bad movies on the calendar, September being the other one. And while the average box office is lower in September the quality of films has been dropping for a while so by comparison September's entries don't feel so bad. January, on the other hand, comes after the best month in terms of Box Office and Award Season combined. Throughout December the quality of films builds to a crescendo and then it suddenly falls flat. More...\n\nMovie Websites Launches for November 26 - December 2\n\nDecember 2nd, 2004\n\nDuring the past week promotional websites for several movies were launched and some older ones added additional content.
