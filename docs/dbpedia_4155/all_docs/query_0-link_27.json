        "meta_description": "Ever since I heard about the biggest scam in animation history from AniMat about how Legends of Oz's producers scammed 4,000 investors for 122 million dollars and underspent their $70 million budget on the animation, I always hoped to make a much better animated movie adaptation of Dorothy of Oz once they go to real jail since they already lost the Legends of Oz film rights to Panama. If Roger Stanton Baum hates Legends of Oz so much he wants to buy the rights to his book back, I hope he lets me adapt it because I could do a much better job than him.\n\nThe real Dorothy of Oz story from the book is about the Jester being possessed by the ghost of the Wicked Witch of the West in her wand which he now uses, and when he turns everyone in Oz into china dolls, Dorothy asks for Scarecrow, Tin Man and Cowardly Lion to not be china so they can help her bring Glinga, the Good Witch of the South, to the Jester, but it was really a trick to set free the other Oz rulers turned into china. This is everyone who I would cast for Dorothy of Oz. People who can do many voices professionally would almost certainly know what voice they need to do for certain characters. Like Legends of Oz, my Dorothy of Oz will have 10 main cast members to bill at the beginning, but unlike Legends of Oz, some of these people will play 2 main characters because there are some other prominent characters (like the Mouse Queen or the Wicked Witch's ghost or the cave dragons or Boq) that need to be included from the original Dorothy of Oz book's story.",

        "text": "Dove Olivia Cameron was born Chloe Celeste Hosterman on January 15, 1996 in Bainbridge Island, Washington to Bonnie J. Wallace, an acting coach & Philip Alan Hosterman, a chief executive officer/founder of Kandahar Trading Company. She's known for playing a dual role as the eponymous characters in the Disney Channel teen sitcom, Liv und Maddie (2013) and playing Mal, daughter of Maleficent in Descendants (2015) and the sequel Descendants 2 (2017). Subsequently, she had a recurring role as Ruby in the ABC television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2018). She is set to voice Spider-Woman in Marvel's upcoming animated superhero feature film Marvel Rising: Secret Warriors (2018).\n\nWhen she was a child, she attended Sakai Intermediate School. At the age of 8, she began acting in community theater at Bainbridge Performing Arts.\n\nWhen she was 14, her family moved to Los Angeles, California, where she sang in Burbank High School's National Championship Show Choir. Cameron is of French descent, and is a fluent speaker of French, having spent many years of her life growing up in France. She has stated she was bullied through her entire school experience, starting in fifth grade, through the end of high school. Regardless of the pressure at school and fitting in, she stayed focused on her dreams of becoming successful in entertainment: \"I became very passionate about [becoming an actress and singer]. I fully immersed myself\". Her father died in 2011 when she was 15 years old.\n\nIn 2007, Cameron played the role of a young Cosette in the Bainbridge Performings Arts stage production of Les Miserables, and in 2008, she had the lead role of Mary in The Secret Garden, again with BPA.\n\nIn 2012, Cameron was cast in a new Disney Channel Original Series entitled Bits and Pieces as Alanna. Shortly after filming the pilot, Bits and Pieces was retooled into Liv and Maddie and saw Cameron starring in the dual lead role of Liv and Maddie Rooney. The preview of the series debuted on July 19, 2013, and the show premiered on September 15, 2013. The pilot episode gained 5.8 million viewers, which was the most-watched in total viewers in 2.5 years since the series Shake It Up! Disney Channel renewed Liv and Maddie for a 13-episode second season slated to premiere in Fall 2014, which was later expanded to 24 episodes.\n\nOn August 27, 2013, Cameron released a cover of \"On Top of the World\" by Imagine Dragons as a promotional single. Her cover peaked on the Billboard Kid Digital Songs chart at seventeen and spent three weeks on the chart. On October 15, 2013, \"Better In Stereo\" was released as a single under Walt Disney Records. \"Better In Stereo\" made its debut on the Billboard Kid Digital Songs chart at No. 21 before peaking at No. 1, becoming Cameron's first No. 1 hit. In February 2014, Cameron confirmed reports that recording had begun for her debut studio album. Her next single, \"Count Me In\", was released on June 3, 2014. The song peaked at number one on the Billboard Kids Digital Songs chart. Cameron played Liz Larson in her first non-Disney film, Barely Lethal, which was theatrically released by A24 Films in 2015.\n\nCameron starred in the television film Descendants which premiered on July 31, 2015. The film was viewed by 6.6 million people and spawned Cameron's two first Billboard Hot 100 songs, \"Rotten to the Core\" at No. 38 and a solo song, \"If Only\", at No. 94. Other songs from the film featuring Cameron such as \"Set It Off\" and \"Evil Like Me\" charted at No. 6 and 12 respectively on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. The soundtrack for the movie peaked atop the Billboard 200 chart becoming the first soundtrack from a Disney Channel Original Movie since High School Musical 2 to do so. As part of the Descendants franchise, Cameron released a cover of Christina Aguilera's hit song, \"Genie in a Bottle\". The music video premiered on Disney Channel on March 18, 2016. The single received 22 million views in less than a month.\n\nOn December 22, 2015, Liv and Maddie was officially renewed for a fourth season, becoming the 9th live-action Disney Channel show in history to achieve this. Cameron began filming the season of Liv and Maddie in early 2016. It was later announced that this would be the final season of the show. The series finale of Liv and Maddie later aired on March 24, 2017.\n\nCameron played the role of Amber Von Tussle in the NBC live television presentation of Hairspray Live!, which aired on December 7, 2016. Reception was generally positive, and Cameron's performance was praised.\n\nCameron reprized her role as Mal in Descendants 2, the sequel to Descendants, in 2017. The film premiered on July 21, 2017. The Descendants 2 soundtrack debuted at #6 on the Billboard 200, with \"It's Goin' Down\" from the soundtrack debuting at #81. This became Cameron's third Hot 100 entry, following \"Rotten to the Core\" and \"If Only\".\n\nCameron played the role of Sophie in the Hollywood Bowl live production of Mamma Mia!. The show took place from July 28, 2017 to July 30, 2017. On August 21, 2017, Cameron was cast in the film Dumplin, starring Jennifer Aniston. Cameron is set to play Bekah Cotter in the comedy. In late 2017 Cameron signed on to appear in a recurring role in Season 5 of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.. This role was later revealed to be Ruby, the daughter of General Hale (Catherine Dent).\n\nDiedrich Bader was born in Alexandria, Virginia, but moved to Paris, France, with his family at age two. While in the \"City of Light\" he developed an appreciation for movie legends like Fred Astaire and Charles Chaplin. So, when a fragile \"Chaplin\" movie reel burned in the theater's projector, four-year-old Bader hopped on stage and entertained the crowd with an imitation of the \"Little Tramp.\" The standing ovation he received set the course for the rest of his life--he knew he wanted to perform.\n\nHe returned to the United States for high school and attended North Carolina School of the Arts. During spring break he was discovered by a casting director in Santa Fe, New Mexico. That meeting led to an audition for a small role in a TV pilot. Bader landed a starring role instead. Although the pilot wasn't picked up, Bader moved to Los Angeles and began auditioning for other roles. He landed guest spots on several series, including Raumschiff Enterprise: Das nächste Jahrhundert (1987), Der Prinz von Bel-Air (1990), Cheers (1982) and Zurück in die Vergangenheit (1989). Filmmaker Penelope Spheeris liked his tongue-in-cheek delivery when he read for her action-adventure spoof series, Danger Theatre (1993). She hired him in that role and for the feature film Die Beverly Hillbillies sind los (1993), which she directed. Bader played the dual roles of twins Jethro and Jethrine Beaudine. He also filmed the political thriller Assassination File - Operation Laskey (1996) for the Encore Entertainment Group. Bader was excited to work on the project, as it allowed him to be shot in the head -- a first for the actor. Bader's father, William, was Chief of Staff for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and is president of the Eurasia Foundation on Capitol Hill. His mother, Gretta, is a sculptor whose portrait of the late Sen. J. William Fulbright sits in the National Gallery in Washington, DC. Bader's wife is actress Dulcy Rogers; they reside in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nTara Strong began her acting career at the age of 13 in Toronto, Canada. She landed several TV, film, and musical theater roles as well as her first lead in an animated series as the title role of \"Hello Kitty.\" After a short run at Toronto's Second City theater company, she moved to Los Angeles with an extensive resume that included her own sit-com and well over 20 animated series. Upon arriving in Hollywood, she quickly made her mark in several TV and Film projects, such as \"Party of Five,\" \"National Lampoon's Senior Trip,\" \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch,\" and more. She has an iconic voice-over career, including roles such as Bubbles in \"The Powerpuff Girls,\" Timmy Turner in \"The Fairly OddParents,\" Dil Pickles in \"Rugrats,\" Raven in \"Teen Titans,\" \"Batgirl,\" \"Family Guy,\" \"Drawn Together,\" \"Ben 10,\" Melody in \"The Little Mermaid 2,\" \"Spirited Away,\" etc. She is Miss Collins on Nickelodeon's \"Big Time Rush\" and the current voice of \"Harley Quinn.\" She is Emmy nominated, a Shorty Award winner, Twilight Sparkle in \"My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic\" and currently playing \"Unikitty\" in the new hit series. She appeared in the Hallmark Christmas movie, \"A Very Merry Toy Store.\" She has 350,000 Twitter followers (@tarastrong) and has used her social media to raise several hundred thousand dollars for kids with cancer and animal rescue groups, as well as using her commanding voices for her anti-bullying platform. She lives in Los Angeles. From between 2000 and 2019 she was married to former actor and real estate agent Craig Strong. However, the couple went their separate ways in July 2019 and, eventually, they formally divorced in January 2022. They have two sons together.\n\n\"Fairuza!\" (\"Turquoise\" in Farsi), her father exclaimed as he saw her blue eyes: Fairuza Alejandra Balk had just been born on May 21, 1974 in Point Reyes, California. Her father, Solomon Ben Feldthouse, was a traveling musician originally from Idaho, and her mother, Cathryn Balk, was a belly dancer. Her parents split up soon after. Fairuza grew up just north of San Francisco, California on a commune-type ranch. Her mother later found work in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was there that Fairuza began her career at age 9 on the ABC special The Best Christmas Pageant Ever (1983). Two years later, she went to the United Kingdom where she attended the Royal Academy of Ballet, the Ramona Beauchamp Agency, and the Bush Davies Performing Arts School. Fairuza worked for the Walt Disney Company for a while; at 11, she was chosen from 1,200 girls to star as Dorothy in Oz - eine fantastische Welt (1985). The next year she starred, prophetically enough, as The Worst Witch (1986) a harbinger of her breakout role in Der Hexenclub (1996) 10 years later.\n\nFairuza and her mother remained in London until 1988, then went to Paris where the 15-year-old starred in Valmont (1989). The next year they returned to Vancouver and Fairuza enrolled in high school, but ended up doing correspondence courses after proving shy in class. Back in Hollywood she starred in a string of movies, including Verlorene Herzen (1992), for which she received an Independent Spirit Award for Best Actress. Following further television and film work, she achieved cult status with her starring role as a teenage witch in her breakout film, Der Hexenclub (1996). That year she also appeared in D.N.A. - Experiment des Wahnsinns (1996), in which she did some belly-dancing and attracted the attention of Lancashire, England-born co-star David Thewlis. They did another movie together, American Perfect (1997).\n\nFairuza was also the love interest in the wildly-popular Waterboy - Der Typ mit dem Wasserschaden (1998) and had a major role in American History X (1998). With a half-dozen movies for 2000, Fairuza is much in demand. Her interests are writing poetry and stories, playing the guitar, singing (her main enjoyment), and dancing. She lives in Venice, California and has an apartment in New York City.\n\nCharles Martinet was born on September 17, 1955 in San Jose, California, USA as Charles Andre Martinet.
