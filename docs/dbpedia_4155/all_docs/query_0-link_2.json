        "text": "There are some aspects of this movie that I really liked: it is visually stunning, it is the first film ever that shows the urbane side of Montenegro and its capital, Marija Vickovic can sure hold the screen, also, 10/10 for bringing ex Yugoslavia together in making this film. However, that is about it. The rest was quite irritating for me: the story doesn't have any real flow or a grip on the viewers, acting is shocking, and ... I just had a feeling that the director was trying bit too hard to make Podgorica look \"worldly\". The language was also annoying, the actors should have made an effort to learn to speak in Montenegrin accent, even the Podgorica-born Vickovic speaks like she lived in Belgrade all her life. All in all, good effort for a first movie, however, plenty of room for improvement - 5/10."
