How about starting off a platonic love story by having sex with a stranger on an airplane? :D Well this is what this movie starts off with.. It basically covers everything that love is being abused for... being illogical and one of the most unexpected things in life. The chemistry between Amanda Peet and Ashton Kuthcher is very nice to watch. the actress seems to be the man in this weird and highly coincidental relationship but the hero finds his moments of perfect timings too, does all the right things at the right times. :) A decent theme and pace to the movie overall. Its shot to portray all the imperfections and the practicality life throws at you. What matters is what you realize is worth holding on to. Must see once! :)
