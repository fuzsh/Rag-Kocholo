        "text": "From the ski jumping hill we follow the signs to the Griesbacher waterfall. Here we cross the bridge and climb the stairs on the opposite side until we come across a wider meadow path. We go left uphill to the forest road, cross this straight ahead and take the small path uphill.\n\nAfter a short time, this path crosses a wide gravel road again. We go left, follow the signs to the Sexauer hut. We leave the hut on the left and continue uphill to the “Teufelskanzel” location, turn right there and stay on the path that leads us over stairs directly to the Teufelskanzel. We climb this partly on steps, partly on foot-wide paths - surefootedness and careful hiking are required here!\n\nAfter the Teufelskanzel, the path meets a wide gravel path again. We turn right and follow this for about 500 meters, then hike right at the Wildwies location over a foot-wide path past the Bärenfelsen to Marienruhe. There we keep left downhill to the next intersection, then right again. A narrow path zigzags downhill to the Rappenschliff location, over the Silbereckle to the Haberer Tower.\n\nAfter we have enjoyed the view from the tower, we go back the same way for about 50 meters before a small path turns off on the left. The path ends above the Kreuzkopfschanze, just turn right once more and we are back at the starting point."
