        "text": "Baden-Baden, city, Baden-Württemberg Land (state), southwestern Germany. It lies along the middle Oos River in the Black Forest (Schwarzwald). Baden-Baden is one of the world’s great spas. Its Roman baths (parts of which survive) were built in the reign of Caracalla (211–217 ce) for the garrison of Strasbourg. The town fell into ruins but reappeared in 1112 as the seat (until 1705) of the margravate of Baden. The city was occupied by French troops in 1688, and it was almost entirely destroyed by a fire the following year. It was revived in the late 18th century as an asylum for refugees of the French Revolution. The popularity of Baden-Baden as a spa dates from the early 19th century, when the Prussian queen visited the site to improve her health, but it reached its zenith under Napoleon III during the 1850s and ’60s, when it became a fashionable resort for European nobility and society. Notable buildings include the casino, the modern baths, the Stiftskirche (founded 7th century, rebuilt 1753, and now the parish church) with tombs of the margraves, and the 15th-century Neues Schloss, the former castle-residence of the margraves and later of the grand dukes of Baden. Nearby are the ruins of the Altes Schloss, the Lichtental Convent (founded 1254), and the Greek Chapel (1863). The resort is popular for its thermal saline and radioactive waters. Pop. (2010 est.) 54,445."
