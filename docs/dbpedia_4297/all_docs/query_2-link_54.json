        "text": "The population figure is defined as the sum of persons who have lived for a long time in Bad Peterstal-Griesbach. This number includes people with a nationality who have their permanent residence for more than 12 months. Other persons of foreign nationality residing in Bad Peterstal-Griesbach for more than 12 months are also counted. Citizens who have been resident outside the municipality for more than 12 months are not counted. The development of this parameter is shown in the following chart in Bad Peterstal-Griesbach.\n\nThe unemployed person is referred to as a person aged 15 or over who normally lives in the reference territory and was not employed during the reference week, was ready to take up work at the latest 14 days and has been actively seeking work during the last 4 weeks. The unemployed also include a person who does not look for a job because she has already found her and is able to get her up to 14 days later. This number includes persons normally living in private households. Unemployment statistics for foreign nationals working and living long-term in collective accommodation establishments on the territory of the state are available to a limited extent because this population is excluded from the unemployment survey. Unemployment rate is the percentage of the unemployed among the economically active people. It reflects the performance of the national economy. The chart below shows the rate of unemployment in recent years in the Bad Peterstal-Griesbach.\n\nCommercial companies which may be incorporated by a legal or individual person have the status of a legal entity.

The most important greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide. In terms of correctness, however, it is not entirely right to compare states in terms of their absolute emissions. far more telling value is information about specific emissions. These are the ratios relating to the absolute value of CO2 emissions per capita or per unit of GDP. Efforts to reduce greenhouse gases production have two angles of view. The climate aspect emphasizes the impact on the entire planet. From an economic point of view, these efforts to reduce greenhouse gases are highly costly. The graph below shows the evolution of carbon dioxide in recent years, per capita, in Germany.\n\nAir Pollution involves a number of processes involving the discharging of pollutants into the air. The statistics are monitored by emissions and stationary sources from register and their data are obliged to archive and submit data for statistical purposes. Pollutant emissions that are not required to be collected by stationary sources are to be counted in the emissions database for the purpose of international reporting and air quality modeling based on reported activity data and emission factors. Air pollution is one of the factors that negatively influences human health, vegetation and ecosystems. Due to accumulation in the environment, it can damage certain materials and structures. The following chart shows the occurrence of oxides and solid pollutants in air in tonnes in Germany."
