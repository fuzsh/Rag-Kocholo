Green forests, bubbling springs and waterfalls, grandiose views and dreamlike premium hiking trails—Bad Peterstal-Griesbach is Germany's first premium hiking resort with predominantly natural paths and a wide range of services. The experience of nature plays an important role in the national park community in the Black Forest, there is for example a LOWA test centre with free hiking shoe rental, combined with a "Best of Hiking Test Centre" where you can rent the complete outdoor equipment for your hike.

In this Collection, we present three Black Forest hiking symphonies and four intermezzos, which take you to unique places in the Renchtal. You will discover fabulous mountain lakes, walk on romantic root paths, and find many fountains along the way. The wonderful Black Forest idyll awaits.

Hiking in Bad Peterstal-Griesbach is possible all year round. However, the area is most beautiful during warmer months, when nature shows its rich array of colors. In summer, there are many charming refreshment stops that are always well stocked. But, the snowy Black Forest also has its charms in winter. The trails in the Renchtal are well developed and signposted making it easy to explore the region's beautiful landscapes.
