The moment was genuine and sweet (like him!) and I couldn't wait to say yes!\n\n\"We are so excited and happy to share our wonderful news with everyone! We both feel so blessed to have the love and support of our family and friends and canâ€™t wait to start this new adventure! Love, The Future Mrs. Rosenberg.\"\n\nThe news comes the same day as bosses at the Cooking Channel announced plans to put Duff on TV as a top chef.
