The moment was genuine and sweet (like him!) and I couldn’t wait to say yes!”\n\nOn Instagram, she posted a photo with her arms wrapped around Rosenberg as well as showing off a gorgeous diamond ring on her left hand.\n\nShe captioned the photo, “The future Mrs.Rosenberg #Love @mr_sts.”\n\nHaylie Duff’s healthy cooking must-haves >>\n\nEven though little sister, Hilary, is in the midst of an amicable divorce from her husband, Mike Comrie, she took the time to tweet out sweet wishes to her big sister.\n\nHaylie previously dated actor Nick Zano for three years.
