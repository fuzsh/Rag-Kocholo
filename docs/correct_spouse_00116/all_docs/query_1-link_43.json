        "text": "‘Goodfellas’ started son of Testa’s manager on path to Hollywood fame\n\nActor Nick Zano’s childhood memories are filled with images of Palm Beach: swimming and surfing on the beach behind Green’s Pharmacy, meeting interesting people at Mar-a-Lago and hanging out at Testa’s restaurant.\n\nBut he found his life’s work during an afternoon at a movie theater watching the film Goodfellas.\n\nAfter analyzing actor Joe Pesci’s character in the 1990 Martin Scorsese-directed crime film, Zano, now 37, found his bliss.\n\n“I couldn’t understand how Pesci’s evil character could be so likable in Goodfellas,” says Zano, who memorized every line in the movie. “I was 12 years old and had wanted to be a Navy SEAL. But from that day in the theater, I knew I wanted to be an actor.”\n\nAnd it has worked out for him. Zano, whose mother Rosemary Edwards is the manager of Testa’s, stars in the new NBC sitcom One Big Happy that debuted last week. Produced by TV talk host Ellen DeGeneres, the show stars Zano, Kelly Brook and Elisha Cuthbert.\n\n“It’s an exciting time for me,” Zano said during an appearance this month at the opening of a Tag Heuer shop in the Miami Design District. “I get to share what I love with audiences and work with my friends.”\n\nIn the show, three single characters who have been best friends for years decide to start a nontraditional family.\n\n“My son has a wry sense of humor and is a very good boy,” says Edwards, who has been at Testa’s since 2004. “When I see ads for the show, I tear up. I am so proud and happy!”\n\nZano, who now lives in Los Angeles, lived in Loxahatchee and Wellington growing up. He played football and ran track while a student at Wellington High School but also was active in drama and TV production.\n\n“I loved everything to do with broadcasting and acting,” he says. “All of this experience in high school set the stage for my career.”\n\nAfter graduating, he was offered a job with a West Palm Beach-based production company called Prelude Pictures. There, he worked on the films Lost In Space and Black Dog, both released in 1998, before moving to Los Angeles in 2001 for acting auditions.\n\nZano impressed casting directors and a year later, his movie knowledge helped him land the job as host on MTV’s Movie House.\n\nBest known for his role in the WB’s sitcom What I Like About You (2003-06), he also has had recurring roles on TV shows Melrose Place, Cougar Town, Happy Endings and 90210. From 2011-12, he was in 2 Broke Girls on CBS.\n\nHe has dated actress Haylie Duff and actress/TV personality Kristin Cavallari. But he is too busy now for anything serious.\n\n“I am single and busy developing my first script under a Warners Brothers deal,” says Zano. “I should have something to say about it soon.”\n\nZano, who was on The Ellen DeGeneres Show last week to promote One Big Happy, still enjoys hanging out at Testa’s when he visits his mom and has served the occasional egg-white omelet to a customer.\n\n“Nick is so talented,” said Tom Testa, the restaurant’s owner. “But when he comes to see his mother, he is never too busy to sign autographs and talk to the customers. We all like him very much.”"
