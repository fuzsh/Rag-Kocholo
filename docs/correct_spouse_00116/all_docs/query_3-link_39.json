        "text": "The most recent episode of DC’s Legends of Tomorrow turned the tables for Sara and the rest of the team. The Legends celebrated the long-awaited matrimony of Ray and Nora while trying to stop the Encore of the week, who turned out to be…SPOILER…Damien Darhk himself. The father of the spouse made his future son-in-law sweat for the hand of his beautiful daughter, but he had to concede his blessing to the two lovebirds eventually. In the final moments of the episode, Damien Darhk redeemed himself from the evil he did and committed suicide with the sword of Genghis Khan, which completely eradicated his soul.\n\nNow, The CW has released a promo for the next episode of the show. It will be the last one that features Ray and Nora as part of the Legends. You can watch the new DC’s Legends of Tomorrow Episode 5.07 promo in the player below.\n\nRELATED – Brandon Routh Addresses His Legends of Tomorrow Departure\n\nAlexandra LaRoche directed the episode written by Ray Utarnachitt & Matthew Maala. The synopsis of “Romeo V. Juliet: Dawn of Justness” reads as follows:\n\n“The Legends continue their hunt for pieces of the Loom of Fate and find themselves face to face with William Shakespeare. Ray (Brandon Routh), Nate (Nick Zano), Rory (Dominic Purcell), Constantine (Matt Ryan), Charlie (Maisie Richardson-Sellers) and Behrad (guest star Shayan Sobhian) stay a little longer on the mission making things worse after lying to Sara (Caity Lotz). Meanwhile, Ray and Nora (Courtney Ford) make another big life decision that leaves the team surprised and best buds, Nate and Ray, on the outs. Jes Macallan, Tala Ashe and Olivia Swann also star.”\n\nDC’s Legends of Tomorrow Episode 5.07 will air Mar. 17 at 9/8c on The CW. Did the sudden death of Damien Darhk surprise you?
