        "text": "(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nsorry?\n\ni really dont understand why people get their bf's/gf's name/ initials tattooed to their bodies.\n\nITS IDIOTIC.\n\nI'm actually wondering in all seriousness if it's \"retro\". It was very trashily popular to do so in the 70s. All the rough bitches who dreamed of marrying bikers and became hard-drinking dope peddling single mothers did it. Usually when they were, like, 14 or 15.\n\nI def. think you're onto something\n\nI've been seeing a lot of 1970's culture creeping into nowadays'. Oh well. At least ppl are done with the 80s lol\n\new\n\nI have a friend who has her bb's father's nickname tattooed on her thigh. It's \"Bizzy\" in script. LOL\n\n(no subject) - charmedoks Expand\n\n(no subject) - la_bellavidaxo Expand\n\n(no subject) - kubsisnuts Expand\n\n(no subject) - startrak Expand\n\nMy husband got my name on him. I told the artist give him a good price since he will be coming back for the cover up.. lol\n\nAGREED BB.\n\nI have been considering lately to have any future SO to tattoo my name on them. That way they have a low chance to ever get laid again.\n\n(no subject) - promisering15 Expand\n\nUgh, my little brother got 'erica' tattooed on his outer wrist, and of course they're not together anymore. He was like 18 when he did it, so fucking stupid.\n\nBecause they are so going to be together ~~forever~~\n\nuhm hes hot, but wow, does he get around.\n\nugh seriously! the fact that he's with haylie brings downs his hot points though....... yuck!\n\nia!\n\npeople never ever get a tattoo of your boyfriend/girlfriend/partner/husband/wif e intials or name! IT THE DUMBEST IDEA EVER!!! dumb dumb dumb\n\nunless they're dead.\n\nthat's the rule.\n\nwhile they're alive, they still have time to fuck up.\n\nlmao thats my rule: no ink till ur dead :)\n\nI hate Haylie Duff. No talent, coat tail riding bitch.\n\nI wish I were looking for a house with somebody... :(\n\nUh-oh, ONTD, I think I just hit the point in my midterm studying where I get real depressing about life and stuff. Help!\n\nyou're not alone bb, i think i've hit a new low studying for these finals. i just want summer already!\n\nI always hit these points:\n\nI don't want to study. So I will:\n\n1. eat cookies!\n\n2. make popcorn!\n\n3. check the Internet obsessively.\n\n4. online shop\n\n5. write an essay due later in the week (out of sheer desperation not to study).\n\n6. make a prep-heavy dinner.\n\n7. start to study.\n\n8. get reminded of how Ryan Reynolds will never be my boyfriend and then spend the rest of the night moping.\n\nThis list happens every time. It's a wonder I'm still in school!\n\n(no subject) - problemgurl Expand\n\n(no subject) - claire_noel Expand\n\n(no subject) - rockinsocks Expand\n\n(no subject) - blckbuster Expand\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - pennyfeather Expand\n\n(no subject) - blackbritt4eva Expand\n\nI feel your pain. I had my 2nd exams two weeks ago (three weeks until finals) and I totally gave up--but it worked out for me, the two I got back are As. It doesn't make any sense at all. I am so confused and have no idea how to replicate the results.\n\nAt this point, I just don't want to go to class. I should be leaving RIGHT NOW. But I made bread this morning, and I don't want to go. It is so nice outside. But I have a hold on my account for $10 (WTF?) and it won't let me register so I have to go to campus sometime today. I also skipped two days of class last week.\n\nSo, I guess my point is that you should just feel good about yourself if you go to class because then you have a better chance of knowing your shit.\n\n(PS.
