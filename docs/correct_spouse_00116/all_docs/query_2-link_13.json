        "text": "Nicholas \"Nick\" Zano (born March 8, 1978) is an American actor and producer. He is best known for having\n\nplayed Vince in The WBsitcom, What I Like About You. He got his big break on MTV, where he hosted that network's former infotainment program about the film industry, Movie House, and briefly worked as an MTV News correspondent before he began an acting career. His recurring roles on television include Drew Pragin on Melrose Place, Josh on Cougar Town, Pete on Happy Endings, P.J. Hillingsbrook on 90210, and Johnny on 2 Broke Girls.\n\nEarly life and education[edit][]\n\nZano was born in Nutley, New Jersey[1] of Italian/Sicilian and Irish descent.[citation needed] He lived in Florida as a child. While attendingWellington High School he was active in the drama and television departments. Throughout his junior and senior years, he and his fellow classmates produced a weekly off-beat skit comedy show that aired on the school's television station. While working on the show, Zano also wrote, starred in and directed student films that made their way to the JVC Universal Film Competition, a festival in which over 800 local high schools participate.\n\nCareer[edit][]\n\nShortly after graduating from high school, Zano moved to Hanover, Pennsylvania and landed a job developing films and television projects for a small production company. During that time, he also was the associate producer for Living Position, a World AIDS Day television special hosted by Lou Diamond Phillips. While selling shoes in a trendy Los Angeles boutique, a customer went back to her office and told her supervisors she'd just met a man who would be a wonderful on-air personality. The woman was an employee at MTV, which led to Zano's hosting job of MTV's Movie House. In 2003, he won the role of Vince in the The WB sitcom What I Like About You, starring Amanda Bynes and Jennie Garth. Zano made his first appearance in the second season and remained until the fourth and final season that ended April 24, 2006. Afterwards, he went on to host and executive produce his MTV reality show Why Can't I Be You?.\n\nThe following year, Zano appeared alongside Haylie Duff and Frankie Muniz in the independent romantic comedy My Sexiest Year. The film, which received mixed reviews, had its world premiere at the 2007 Hamptons International Film Festival. In 2008 he appeared in a supporting role opposite Drake Bell in MGM's teen comedy film College. Zano also appeared in Beverly Hills Chihuahua and Joy Ride 2: Dead Ahead later that year. In 2009, Zano co-starred in The Final Destination, the fourth installment of the Final Destinationfilm series. He also guest starred on the ABC sitcom Cougar Town, starring Courteney Cox. In 2010, he had a recurring role on The CW's Melrose Place.\n\nIn 2011 he started a recurring role on 2 Broke Girls as Johnny, a graffiti artist who regularly flirts with Max (Dennings). In 2011 he also co-starred in romantic comedy Scents and Sensibility as Brandon. In 2012, Zano scored a recurring role on a different show on The CW, 90210, in which he plays a billionaire who goes into business with Annie (Grimes). Beginning in December 2012, Zano began a recurring role in season three of the ABC comedy series Happy Endings as Pete, Penny's new love interest.\n\nPersonal life[edit][]\n\nZano split with girlfriend of three years Haylie Duff in October 2011. In December 2011, Zano began dating 2 Broke Girls co-star Kat Dennings.\n\nFilmography[edit][]\n\nFilm Year Title Role Notes 2002 Catch Me If You Can James Uncredited 2004 Fat Albert Camera salesman 2005 Everything You Want Quinn Andrews Television film 2007 My Sexiest Year Pierce 2008 College Tony \"Teague\" Garrison 2008 Beverly Hills Chihuahua Bryan 2008 Joy Ride 2: Dead Ahead Bobby 2009 The Final Destination Hunt Wynorski 2011 Scents and Sensibility Brandon 2011 10 Years Nick Vanillo 2011 Desperately Seeking Santa David Morretti Television film 2013 Lost Luck James"
