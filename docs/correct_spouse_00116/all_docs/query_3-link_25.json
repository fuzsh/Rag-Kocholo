        "text": "Before he met Alba Baptista, Chris Evans had been through his share of ups and downs in his dating life — but remained hopeful that he’d find The One someday.\n\nEvans’ love life has captivated fans ever since his high-profile relationship with Jessica Biel. The former couple began dating in 2001 and worked alongside one another in two films, London and Cellular, throughout their relationship. Though they called it quits in 2006, the 7th Heaven alum had high hopes for their future together.\n\n“We always talk about [marriage]. We both want to be married, and we both want to have children,” Biel told Cosmopolitan one year before her and Evans’ split. She eventually tied the knot with Justin Timberlake in 2012.\n\nDespite Evans’ struggle to find a lasting love, he is hopeful that he’ll have a family of his own in the near future.\n\n“I definitely want children. I definitely want a family. But you cannot put the cart before the horse,” he told USA Today after his split from Slate. “The family only works if it’s built off the extension of the love you feel for a person. If you all of a sudden want the kid more than you want the relationship, you may be on shaky ground.”\n\nScroll down to relive Evans’ most famous relationships and flings."
