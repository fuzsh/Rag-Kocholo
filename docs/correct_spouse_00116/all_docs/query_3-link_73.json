As 'Deadline' reports from Cannes, Brody will play the brilliant strategist Emperor Charles V, trying to hold together a fragmented Empire, in a 16th century world of wealth, debauchery, violent retaliations, sex, manipulation and treason.\n\nDEZZY'S HISTORY LESSON\n\nCharles V was a Holy Roman Emperor and also the king of Spain. He was also the heir of three of Europe's leading dynasties (he was famous for having enlarged lower jaw - a result of long history of inbreeding in his royal family) and his domain reached even into Americas where Spain conquered the Aztecs and Incas! Even though he ruled half of the world, he was mostly a peaceful man and even the end of his rule was peaceful since he voluntary abdicated and went to a monastery seeking retirement after three decades of complex rule!\n\n10TH CENTURY VIKINGS\n\nIN 'THE LONG SHIPS' EPIC MOVIE\n\nSpeaking of the epic genre, Stellan Skarsgard will star in Viking epic THE LONG SHIPS the adaptation of the Swedish historical novel about famed 10th century Viking Red Orm who lived in the famous Viking Age when Europe was mostly ruled by Vikings, from Andalusia to Denmark, to Ireland, England and other parts! It is one of the most popular Swedish books ever!\n\nEARTH WITHOUT GRAVITY IN 'INVERSION'\n\nEpic things will be also seen in Foresight Unlimited's $120 million worth disaster epic movie INVERSION about what might happen if Earth loses its gravity! To start shooting next year, the sf movie, writen by 'Children Of Men' scribe David Arata, will describe a global chase against the clock to save Earth’s inhabitants, traveling from China to Europe to the U.S. where among other things New York City is completely inverted.\n\nWWI 'GUNS OF AUGUST' SAGA\n\nHELENA BONHAM CARTER, EMILIA CLARKE, CHARLES DANCE\n\nAnd to finish the day in epic style, 'Deadline' also writes that Helena Bonham Carter will take the lead role in World War One epic saga THE GUNS OF AUGUST! GAME OF THRONES stars Emilia Clarke and Charles Dance will also star in the movie about Bonham Carter's real life step-great grandmother Margot Asquith in an adaptation of the book by historian Barbara W. Tuchman. It is the story of a family dispute with global consequences. It traces the tragic mis- understandings, missed opportunities and aristocratic follies of the summer of 1914, which led to the outbreak of the First World War.\n\n↧\n\nPAYPAL ACCOUNT FOR DONATING MONEY TO THE VICTIMS OF CATASTROPHIC FLOODS IN SERBIA!

I don't know if most of you around the world have heard about the terrible floods in Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia (since most of the bigger news channels have started writing about it only after Serbian tennis players Novak Djokovic criticised BBC and CNN for not reporting about the true extent of the catastrophe at the Balkan peninsula) but the damage after the torrential rains last week, which caused monstrous flooding waves in most of the rivers, is huge with tens of thousands of people being evacuated, dozens and dozens of dead people, and countless houses, bridges, roads, buildings being destroyed, hundreds of thousands of animals drowned.... Most of the Southern part of Serbia has been turned into a sea in just hours! Serbian capital city Belgrade has on itself taken in tens of thousands of evacuated people, women, and children, who were left without their houses and all belongings. It will take years to recover from the catastrophe and many efforts and luck to fend of all the diseases and illnesses that usually come after extreme floods and landslides.\n\nTHE PAYPAL ACCOUNT FOR HELP\n\nIf you are willing to help in any way (even the smallest donations count) here is the official PayPal account open for the victims of the floods, to which you can donate money and help these poor people!\n\nPS I will be very thankful to all of you who are willing to post the help account over in your posts and at your blogs and websites!

CATHERINE DENT FIRST CAST MEMBER IN 'GALYNTINE' POSTAPOCALYPTIC TV SHOW\n\nCATHERINE DENT CAST IN\n\n'GALYNTINE' POSTAPOCALYPTIC NEW FOX TV SHOW\n\nSorry for not posting anything yesterday, people, our headquarters were under severe storm and a thunder hit powerline in our street so we were without electricity, internet, cable TV... It's not like you missed much, since it's been a very dry period in the news business.... In TV news, AMC's upcoming apocalyptic show GALYNTINE has found its first cast member in Catherine Dent from THE SHIELD. The dystopian science fiction show will be set in a post-apocalyptic future without technology where a group of survivors are forced to adapt to a new way of life. Dent will portray a female survivor with two kids. THE WALKING DEAD's Greg Nicotero is producing.\n\nRED BAND SOCIETY TRAILER\n\nOCTAVIA SPENCER AND DAVID ANNABLE IN TOUCHING SHOW\n\nAnd speaking of TV, here's the first trailer for Fox new hospital set coming of age show RED BAND SOCIETY which will start airing this Fall! Coming from Steven Spielberg's Amblin Television and starring Academy Award Winner Octavia Spencer and BROTHERS AND SISTERS star David Annable, RED BAND SOCIETY will be a provocative, inspiring and, at times, comedic young ensemble drama told through the eyes of a group of teenagers who meet as patients in the pediatric ward of Ocean Park Hospital in Los Angeles.\n\nRED BAND STORY\n\nWhat if a hospital was your high school, boarding school and summer camp rolled into one? What if it was the place where you fell in love for the first time and made friendships that lasted a lifetime?

ALEX RUSSELL & BERENICE MARLOHE IN 'PRISONER OF WAR' SF EPIC\n\nBEFORE I GO TO SLEEP POSTER\n\nNICOLE KIDMAN WITH MARK STRONG AND COLIN FIRTH\n\nStill not much of movie news to give you, people, so I will entertain you today with the first poster for the big screen adaptation of Stephen Watson's bestselling novel BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP showing Nicole Kidman, Mark Strong and Colin Firth in the lead roles! As you know, since yours truly was one of the worldwide translators of the book, the story follows a woman who wakes up everyday with no memories. She can remember only the things which happen during the day before she goes to sleep so her husband has to explain to her who she is each morning when she wakes up thinking she's in bed with a stranger. Later on a doctor secretly helps her to write down her memories which leads her to a dramatic discovery with a thriller twist (I myself found the twist rather cheap).\n\nLOVE LETTERS TO THE DEAD\n\nGETTING MOVIE ADAPTATION\n\nAnother book to be made into a film is Ava Dellaira's debut novel LOVE LETTERS TO THE DEAD which was just opted by Fox 2000. Published last month, the book follows Laurel, a high school student whose beloved older sister has died under mysterious circumstances. Emotionally frayed by the loss, she unexpectedly finds catharsis in an assignment from her English teacher: write a letter to a dead person. Instead of handing in the assignment, though, she begins an ongoing series of letters to an eclectic group of rock stars, poets, and popular icons such as Kurt Cobain, Judy Garland, Amelia Earhart, and Amy Winehouse. She writes to her epistolary confidants about navigating new and complicated friendships, learning to live with her splintering family, falling in love for the first time. Ultimately, the letters reveal the painful truth about her past.\n\n'PRISONER OF WAR' SF MOVIE\n\nALEX RUSSELL & BERENICE MARLOHE\n\nOne of the movies that was shopped over at Cannes this year is science fiction thriller PRISONER OF WAR from Voltage Pictures. To be directed by Joe Miale, the movie might star CHRONICLE's young Australian actor Alex Russell and SKYFALL's French actress Berenice Marlohe! The film tells both epic and intimate story of humankind’s last stand against a cataclysmic alien invasion. Set in the war-ravaged African countryside, a U.S. soldier and a French foreign aid worker team up to survive the alien onslaught. As they journey through the battlefield in search of refuge, their bond will be tested when the soldier discovers his true identity.\n\n↧\n\nCHARLIE COX TO PLAY 'DAREDEVIL' IN NETFLIX TV SHOW!
