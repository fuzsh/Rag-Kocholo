She is an amazing cook and Hilary is an amazing baker.”\n\nAnd the family bonding doesn’t just stop in the kitchen! Hilary’s NHL pro hubby Mike Comrie, who plays for the Pittsburgh Penguins, has been chumming up to Nick, teaching the once uninformed New Jersey native a thing or two about hockey.\n\nOK! NEWS: HILARY DUFF'S BOYFRIEND AIMS TO PLEASE\n\n“Mike taught me so much about hockey. I was never a hockey guy,” the 33-year-old explained to OK! at Bar Marmont while sipping on a Heineken, “ He opened my eyes to hockey and I became a fan. I went to several Pittsburgh games.”\n\nWhile Nick kept mum on the possibility of one day becoming Hilary’s brother-in-law, he definitely seems devoted to Haylie for the time being, marriage aside.\n\nOK! NEWS: HILARY DUFF STEPS OUT IN PARIS\n\n“I think to love somebody everyday for a long period of time is the most romantic thing you can do,” the Final Destination actor gushed to reporters of his girlfriend.\n\nNick and Haylie, 26, met while filming My Sexiest Year in 2007, the same year that Hilary began dating her how husband Mike.\n\nOK! NEWS: HILARY DUFF GOES OVERSEAS TO PROMOTE HER NEW BOOK\n\nTen Year, Nick's latest project also starring Channing Tatum, Kate Mara, Rosario Dawson, Jenna Dewan, and Justin Long, is set for release at the end of this year."
