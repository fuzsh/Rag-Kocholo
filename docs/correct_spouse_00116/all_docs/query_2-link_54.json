        "text": "On Monday, CBS ordered Channing Tatum's sitcom starring Nick Zano. Nicky, executive produced by Tatum and Reid Carolin, will be written by Zano, Andrew Reich, and Ted Cohen. \"Who is this Nick Zano?! And why isn't Channing Tatum in the show?!\" you scream as you pull your hair out. But, if you watch television, you know Zano. Or, more accurately, have at least seen his face. (But perhaps you only watch the Discovery Health channel. You've got me there. I don't think he's been on any of those shows.) And to answer your second question: Channing Tatum is a tad busy being a movie star. Anyway, here are 10 facts to know about your new TV boyfriend, because Zano is totally going to be your new TV boyfriend:\n\nNick Zano and Channing Tatum are buddies in real life.\n\nThey costarred in the movie 10 Years together and now they're working on this together. What a pair of adorable hotties.\n\nNicky is a semi-autobiographical show about a man living in a multi-generational household.\n\nZano was raised by his great grandmother, grandmother, mother, and aunts. I could make a \"he must comfortable with running out to the store for tampons\" joke, but I won't because it's 2013 and we're past that.\n\nHe was on What I Like About You.\n\nHe played the bike messenger boyfriend of Amanda Bynes' character. He was a cutie patootie. Pardon me while I pour one out for the Vince and Holly reunion that will never happen on Nicky.\n\nImage: The WB\n\nBefore he got his big break...\n\n...he was a shoe salesman at Kenneth Cole.\n\nHe's been on almost every show.\n\nSeriously. His credits include: Pete on Happy Endings (Penny's fiancé!), Josh on Cougar Town, Johnny on 2 Broke Girls, Drew on Melrose Place (the new one), Preston on 90210 (again, the new one), Dr. Sanderson on 7th Heaven, and more! Seriously, he's been on all of the shows (and a bunch of movies)!\n\nImage: ABC\n\nHe's been on almost every young female star. (Sorry, couldn't resist.)\n\nHe's dated Amanda Bynes, Kristin Cavallari, and Haylie Duff. How mid-aughts of him!\n\nHe was an MTV News correspondent.\n\nBecause why can't the news be babe-a-licious and informative?\n\nHe was supposed to be in a 2007 remake of Revenge of the Nerds.\n\nAlongside Adam Brody (!!!), but the project was cancelled. Don't mind me as I sob over a non-movie I didn't know about until this moment.\n\nHis current girlfriend is also on CBS.\n\nAs of Dec. 2011, he's been dating 2 Broke Girls costar Kat Dennings. Sorry. I guess he can't be your new BF after all.\n\nHe's 35.\n\nI know. I can't believe it either."
