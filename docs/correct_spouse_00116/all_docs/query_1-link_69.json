        "text": "Haylie Duff headed out with her main man Nick Zano to look at getting a house together. The couple perused some places in Toluca Lake, California on Saturday along with a real estate agent. I just found out that Haylie is actually working on a debut album titled “Walk the Walk” set for a mid-2008 release date. I had no idea that she had any talent in that area! But does she? Only time will tell…."
