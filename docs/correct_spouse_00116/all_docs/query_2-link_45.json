        "text": "Their wedding was fairy-tale-themed. The event was orchestrated by event planner Mindy Weiss and paid tribute to the pair's shared love of fairies. It also included two flower girls who walked down the aisle wearing wings.\n\nThe guest list boasted a handful of stars. Among the 220 guests were Marlon Wayans, Nick Zano, Haylie Duff (who served as one of the bridesmaids), and maid of honor Emmanuelle Chriqui.\n\nTheir first dance was to Hawaiian artist Israel Ka'ano'i Kamakawiwo'ole's version of \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow.\" The reception took place in a tent decorated by Mark's Garden with thousands of roses, hydrangeas, and orchids in red, fuchsia, and blush.\n\nTheir wedding cake was shaped like a castle. It featured fairies in several flavors, including red velvet, chocolate with chocolate fudge, and white with Funfetti frosting, which is Channing and Jenna's favorite.\n\nChanning and Jenna's wedding gifts also matched their fairy-tale theme. Guests were treated to crystals as favors.\n\nJenna wore a peach wedding gown. The actress said \"I do\" in a peach and ivory Reem Acra couture ballgown while Channing donned a black Giorgio Armani suit."
