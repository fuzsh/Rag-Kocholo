        "text": "She's getting married! Haylie Duff is engaged to her boyfriend Matt Rosenberg, a source confirms to Us Weekly. The actress announced the news herself on Thursday, April 3.\n\n\"The future Mrs.Rosenberg #Love @mr_sts,\" Duff, 29, wrote via Instagram. Alongside the caption, she shared an adorable picture of the couple smiling ear-to-ear. Looking flawless, Duff wrapped her arm around her soon-to-be husband while also showing off her stunning (and huge!) engagement ring.\n\n\"This week has seriously just become the best week of my life!\" Duff added on her Real Girl's Kitchen blog. \"As if announcing The Real Girl's Kitchen tv show wasn't enough, Matt just took me by total surprise and proposed…on April Fool’s Day of all days! The moment was genuine and sweet (like him!) and I couldn’t wait to say yes!\"\n\n\"We are so excited and happy to share our wonderful news with everyone!\" she continued. \"We both feel so blessed to have the love and support of our family and friends and can’t wait to start this new adventure!\"\n\nThe news comes three months after Haylie's younger sister Hilary Duff, 26, announced her split from husband Mike Comrie after three years of marriage. The pair have remained amicable, and share 24-month-old son Luca.\n\nHaylie previously dated actor Nick Zano for three years until their split in November 2011. She released her first cookbook, The Real Girl's Kitchen, back in October 2013."
