        "text": "Haylie Duff has got engaged.\n\nThe 29-year-old actress is planning to tie the knot after her boyfriend Matt Rosenberg popped the question on April Fools day.\n\nThe blonde beauty, who has just landed her own show 'Real Girl's Kitchen' on the Cooking Channel, shared the news on her blog Tuesday, writing: ''This week has seriously just become the best week of my life! As if announcing The Real Girl's Kitchen tv show wasn't enough, Matt just took me by total surprise and proposed...on April Fool's Day of all days! The moment was genuine and sweet (like him!) and I couldn't wait to say yes!\n\n''We are so excited and happy to share our wonderful news with everyone! We both feel so blessed to have the love and support of our family and friends and can't wait to start this new adventure!''.\n\nShe then signed the post with: ''The Future Mrs. Rosenberg''.\n\nHaylie's engagement news comes just three months after her younger sister Hilary, 26, announced her split from husband Mike Comrie after three years of marriage.\n\nHaylie was previously in a relationship with Nick Zano for three years from 2008 until 2011."
