        "text": "Although their marriage doesn’t appear to be official yet, “newlyweds” Kayne West and Bianca Censori are planning to start a family and she might already be pregnant! A friend of the architect turned housewife reveals that Bianca had to agree to have kids as part of her “marriage” with Kanye. Here’s the kicker… Kanye insisted they have a custody agreement already in place which guarantees HE gets physical custody of any offspring and Bianca gets visitation and a hefty amount of child support. Kanye has ranted and raved since his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian was awarded custody of their kids, including the right to choose the schools they attend. THIS time around Kanye was proactive and had a custody agreement in place BEFORE the “wedding.”\n\nPhoto of Bianca: Instagram – Notice Bianca’s striking resemblance to Kim – before Bianca got her hair cut and bleached blonde…\n\nNick Cannon seems to be turning into the old lady who lived in a shoe (remember – she had so many children she didn’t know what to do?) and friends say his ex-wife Mariah Carey is thrilled. Nick went through a rather messy divorce with Mariah back in 2016 and one point of contention was custody and visitation of their twins, Moroccan and Monroe. But now that Nick just welcomed his 12th child, he and Mariah have never been on better terms. Our insider says that with so many baby mamas to attend to and children to see, Mariah suddenly has full control over her children’s schedule. Nick has so much on his plate these days that he just lets Mariah call the shots when it comes to their twins. Here’s a surprise: Mariah is delighted that her kids will have so many half-siblings!\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nGigi Hadid and Zayn Malik were a bad match from the start. She’s a hard-working model, grateful for her success and filled with ambition. She is very sociable and aims to develop a career as a TV personality or correspondent. Grateful seems not to be in Zayn’s vocabulary – the drop-dead handsome singer just walked away from his One Direction group at the height of their popularity, left the other guys in the lurch, and petulantly complained that he was “anxious” and couldn’t tolerate all the public attention. Instead of addressing his anxiety problem, he moved to a remote ranch in Pennsylvania. He even uses his baby daughter as an excuse for being reclusive. These are all the ingredients for a huge custody battle over his and Gigi’s child that he keeps hidden.\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA – Gigi and Zayn in happier days…\n\nBrad Pitt HAS to be wondering which of his six children dislike him enough to testify AGAINST him in his and Angelina’s custody court battle. Angelina is furious because the judge recently gave Brad shared custody of the kids. Court papers show that Angelina said THREE of the children were ready to testify AGAINST their father, but the judge didn’t allow it. We already know Maddox, 19, wants nothing to do with Brad (he was with Angelina long before Brad came along.) Pax is 17 and would probably side with Maddox- but who is the 3rd angry child? Zahara? (we remember Brad shopping with her to find a doll that looked like her) Shiloh? She and the twins Knox and Vivienne look a LOT like their dad. Brad just wants time with his kids so he can win them back. SOME will be more difficult than others…\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA – The Pitts in happier days\n\nWow. Angelina Jolie must REALLY despise Brad Pitt. She filed for divorce in 2016 and she has dragged him back into court numerous times- mostly to settle custody issues -so the divorce is still happening. Brad was just given joint custody of the kids, but Angelina plans to object and keep the court fight going strong. Is Brad paying for BOTH their expensive legal teams during this process? It’s sickening to imagine how much this SIX YEAR legal battle is costing! Brad has also put his personal life on hold – note that he has been careful NOT to be seen with any other women. He doesn’t want to agitate Angelina any more than she already is. Brad must look back at his simple and civilized divorce from Jennifer Aniston quite fondly these days…\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nRemember Alia Shawkat? She’s the 31 year old Arrested Development actress (also an artist) who was seen in the company of Brad Pitt a few times. Everyone assumed it was his first romance after divorcing Angelina Jolie and made a big deal out of it, but it turned out they were just friends. Brad was recently linked to a German model, Nicole Poturalski, 27, but apparently the relationship has already fizzled. We’re betting Brad has no intention of being linked to ANYONE until his custody battle with Angelina is settled (he wants 50-50 custody of the kids) – she’s been dragging it out, and the LAST thing he wants to do is make her angry.\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nHalle Berry has a history of unpleasant custody battles – there were some nasty accusations when she split with model Gabriel Aubry, the father of her now 12 year old daughter Nahla. When she was married to her son Maceo’s dad, French actor Olivier Martinez, they all planned to move to France, but Aubry put a stop to it. He wanted access to his daughter. Halle and Olivier lasted 2 years, and divorced in 2015. They shared custody of Maceo, but Olivier was forced to stay in LA to be close to his son. Most of his work is in France, but Olivier seemed to choose his son over his career. Halle and Olivier have a new court date to make custody decisions about Maceo – we bet Olivier is hoping to take Maceo, now 6, to France for a visit -will Halle allow this – especially in a pandemic? Halle seems confident about the outcome – she’s representing herself in court – no lawyer.\n\nAbove, Love this photo of Olivier introducing Maceo to Mickey Rourke in Beverly Hills\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nDuring a summer of testosterone-fueled supermovies, it’s almost hard to remember what a really good film looks like. The subtitled French movie Custody is one of the most amazing movie experiences we have ever had. A few weeks ago we saw what was supposed to be a “scarey” movie, “Hereditary,” but it turned out to be silly and a huge disappointment. Custody tells the story of a REAL LIFE situation and THOSE can be far more frightening than monsters or ghosts. This brilliant and subtle movie starts off documenting an ”ordinary” divorcing couple and slooowly builds up to a shocking and unbelievably frightening finale. (It could happen to YOU!) When it was over, the audience was visibly shaken – and many were in tears. Need we say more? (Opens today)\n\nRocco Ritchie, 15, looks happy as a clam skateboarding in London. A month ago he ditched him mother Madonna on her Rebel Tour and went to stay with his dad, director Guy Ritchie. He says he prefers the normal family life he has with Guy and his wife Jacqui and their 3 kids. Rocco has lots more freedom in London where he isn’t so often recognized. (And it’s easier to flirt with girls.) The probability of a real custody battle became clear when Rocco did NOT show at his fancy NY school on Monday after the Christmas holidays. And Madonna thought she was the perfect mom!\n\nWe are consistently appalled by Gossip Girl star Kelly Rutherford’s German ex-husband Daniel Giersch, who has taken her children away from her! Somehow, through senseless court proceedings in various countries, her sneaky HUSBAND has custody of HER two American born children. Giersch has his mother caring for the kids in Europe. Kelly’s court battle has already bankrupted the actress and we feel awful for her because children should live with their MOTHER! Now her nasty and litigious ex-husband Giersch has proven just how petty and vindictive he is by taking legal action against Vanity Fair magazine for writing about her plight. He claims they “harmed his reputation with inaccurate statements.” He is a MONSTER! Can’t SOMEBODY help this woman? (Above, Kelly and son Hermes in happier days)\n\nPhoto Credit: Pacific Coast News"
