        "text": "about mehey, i'm harrison & i'm a twenty-eight year old gay man who currently resides in south texas (yes it's literal hell). anyway i've been roleplaying since 2005, so i've seen it all. as a heads up, i'm legally blind which means i can't work and i spend most of my time at home so i'm always online though my sleep schedule is sporadic and unpredictable. i also run a resource blog on tumblr where i make gif packs for rp purposes, feel free to check it out if you want\n\npreferencesas far as preferences go, i'm only interested in mxm ships and that's about it. comms can be fun but i strongly prefer rf/one liner threads so that's what i'll usually suggest. i usually write in third person & past tense but i'm not super picky with your writing style so don't worry about that.\n\ni love writing smut so that's usually what i write but i love to give some plot/depth to it as well. i'm also a sucker for fluff and angst, especially when they all go hand and hand together. also down to dark + triggering plots as you'll see though i always respect boundaries.\n\nas far as faces go, i'm really open minded and my list is pretty extensive though i ask you respect my banned fc list as well. my list is always expanding as i add more fcs. i also don't generally follow the +/- 5 year rule and base the age off the resources i'm using in the thread."
