When adapting Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur’s hit 1928 play The Front Page into this film, Hawks had the inspired idea of turning its star reporter character Hildy Johnson into a woman. The result is an immortal mix of hard-boiled newsroom setting and remarriage comedy, and Rosalind Russell as Hildy is a standout among cinema’s powerful women. She is matched in force only by her conniving but charismatic editor and ex-husband, Walter Burns (Cary Grant). Burns dangles the chance for Hildy to scoop her fellow reporters with the story of an impending execution to keep her from hopping the train that’s supposed to take her to Albany and a new life as a housewife married to bland insurance man Bruce Baldwin, played by Ralph Bellamy. You can see more of Bellamy in five more films that follow His Girl Friday this evening and into tomorrow morning: Carefree, the 1938 Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers-led musical comedy; The Man Who Lived Twice, a 1936 crime drama; Sunrise at Campobello (1960), featuring Bellamy as Franklin Roosevelt and Best Actress Oscar nominee Greer Garson as Eleanor Roosevelt; Parole Girl (1933), a romantic drama costarring Mae Clark; and Boy Meets Girl (1938), a screwball comedy led by James Cagney and Pat O’Brien.\n\nNFL Football: Seattle at Dallas\n\nPrime Video, 8:15pm Live\n\nGeno Smith and the Seattle Seahawks are at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, for a Thursday Night Football matchup against Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nChildren Ruin Everything: “Money”\n\nThe CW, 8:30pm\n\nAstrid (Meaghan Rath) and James (Aaron Abrams) try to get through the month without dipping beyond their budget.\n\nShrek the Halls\n\nNBC, 8:30pm\n\nMike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz and Antonio Banderas reprise their voice roles from the hit Shrek feature films in this 2007 half-hour holiday special, whose story takes place between Shrek the Third and Shrek Forever After.

Turner Classic Movies continues its tradition of airing this title during the holiday season today; the film will also re-air Dec. 18 and Dec. 24 during the network’s Classic Christmas Marathon. Given how familiar the tale has become, and how most adaptations hit a good number of the basic story points known and loved by readers and viewers, when it comes to watching different interpretations of A Christmas Carol, what usually matters most is what the various actors bring to the legendary characters. The cast in this relatively brief (only 69 minutes long) version — which is one of the more family-friendly adaptations, generally excising most of the darker and bleaker aspects of Dickens’ story — is fun, led by Reginald Owen as the miser Ebenezer Scrooge; real-life spouses Gene and Kathleen Lockhart as Bob Cratchit and his wife (with their real-life 13-year-old daughter June Lockhart, making her screen debut, in an uncredited role as a Cratchit daughter); Terry Kilburn as Tiny Tim Cratchit; Leo G.

This TV movie that first aired on ABC in 1979 is set in Concord, New Hampshire, during the Depression, and features Winkler as Scrooge-like businessman Benedict Slade. Slade gets a chance at redemption one Christmas Eve when he is visited by three ghostly figures — resembling three of the people whose possessions he seized to collect on their unpaid loans — who force him to reassess his life. Winkler was barely in his mid 30s at the time he made this, but for Slade’s “present” scenes he comes across as an aged miser in an impressive way, thanks in part to future Oscar-winning makeup effects artist Rick Baker, who is billed as the film’s “special makeup consultant.” An American Christmas Carol finishes up an afternoon and early evening of Christmas movies on MOVIES!. Leading up to it are A Christmas Carol (1951), headlined by Alistair Sim as Scrooge; The Great Rupert (1950, aka The Christmas Wish), led by Jimmy Durante; and Mrs. Santa Claus (1996), a TV movie starring Angela Lansbury and Charles Durning.\n\nYuletide the Knot\n\nUPtv, 7pm\n\nOriginal Film!\n\nWhen small-town wedding planner Rachel (Mary Antonini) is faced with planning her biggest Christmas wedding yet for an out-of-town influencer couple, she is thrown a surprise when the bride’s manager turns out to be Logan (Peter Porte), her first love and high school sweetheart.
