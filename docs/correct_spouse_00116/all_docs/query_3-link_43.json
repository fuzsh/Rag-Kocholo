        "text": "Canadian-American television producer, writer, and actorTemplate:SHORTDESC:Canadian-American television producer, writer, and actor\n\nTemplate:Multiple issues\n\nLinwood Boomer (born October 9, 1955) is a Canadian-American television producer, writer, and former actor. He is known for playing the role of Adam Kendall on the drama Little House on the Prairie, and for creating the Fox sitcom Malcolm in the Middle.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nBoomer was born into a lower-middle class family in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the third of four sons. He was enrolled in a gifted program at school. His mother is named Eileen. He was the middle child in his household. Boomer made a show based on his life story called Malcolm in the Middle, which ran on FOX from January 2000 to May 2006.\n\nCareer[]\n\nBoomer began his career as an actor. After playing Adam Kendall on Little House on the Prairie, Boomer began focusing his talents on the behind-the-scenes aspects of television.\n\nBoomer's writing and executive producing credits include Night Court, Flying Blind, The Boys Are Back, Townies, 3rd Rock from the Sun and God, the Devil and Bob.

Boomer wrote the script and exec produced along with Berman and Lloyd Braun for their BermanBraun shingle and Universal Media Studios, where BermanBraun is based. Dubbed The Karenskys, the multi-camera comedy would revolve around a daughter's return to the fold of her large, eccentric, ethnic family after her husband takes a job in her hometown. It was directed by Pamela Fryman and starred Annie Potts, Desi Lydic, Jack Thompson, Mather Zickel, Sasha Alexander, Tinsley Grimes, & Todd Stashwick.[1]\n\nMalcolm in the Middle[]\n\nAlthough Boomer has created, produced and acted in many television series, he is best known for creating the Fox sitcom Malcolm in the Middle, which was based on his life story.
