        "text": "Obliterated, the latest action/drama series released on Netflix, brings a new assorted group of actors and characters into the fold through a stacked cast.\n\nMultiple branches of the United States Armed Forces team up with one another in Obliterated to combat a dangerous terrorist network from leaving Las Vegas in ruins.\n\nThe real issue is that these various agents believe they got the job done and celebrate accordingly, not realizing the bomb they diffused is fake, and are now forced to fight through hangovers and exhaustion to truly finish their work.\n\nCreated by the team behind fellow Netflix hit Cobra Kai, Obliterated brings an eight-episode adventure to the small screen, and it made its official debut on November 30.\n\nEvery Character and Actor in Netflix's Obliterated\n\nAhead are all 24 actors that make up the cast of Netflix's newest eight-episode series, Obliterated, along with the characters they play:\n\nShelley Hennig - Ava Winters\n\nNick Zano - Chad McKnight\n\nC.

Thomas Howell - Hagerty\n\nC. Thomas Howell lets out his crazy side in Obliterated as Hagerty, a psycho bomb expert with only seven fingers who helps the team diffuse the initial bomb that's later revealed to be fake.\n\nTaking a heaping of drugs and alcohol, Hagerty ends up passing out and collapsing onto a glass table, but not before getting completely naked for all to see.
