        "text": "By Abi Travis\n\nMay 13 2021, Updated 2:13 p.m. ET\n\nThe Hulu comedy Dollface dropped on the streaming platform in November 2019 to mostly positive reviews. It stars Kat Dennings as the recently dumped Jules Wiley, who now has to relearn how to interact with her friends after basically abandoning them for her now-ex-boyfriend. Given that the show seems to center around relationships (or the end of them, anyway), we found ourselves wondering: Who is Kat Dennings dating? Here’s what we found out.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nKat Dennings got engaged in May 2021.\n\nDespite Kat having a spotty dating record in Hollywood, boyfriend Andrew W.K. popped the question in May 2021 and Kat announced it to the world with a few Instagram photos of herself with her new fiancé and the caption, \"Don't mind if I do.\"\n\nThe couple was rumored to have met in early 2021 and, apparently, the pandemic suited them because they got close enough to take a seriously big and exciting leap.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWho else has Kat dated?\n\nBack in 2014, Kat started dating singer Josh Groban. According to E! News, the two made their first official outing as a couple in October of that year at the Carousel of Hope Ball in Beverly Hills. While the two dated, Kat gushed to Ellen DeGeneres on her show about how \"talented and amazing\" Josh is.\n\n\"What you may not know is that he’s one of those people who can sit at a piano and play anything, anything off the top of his [head] he’s just, he’s just a genius,\" Kat said at the time.\n\nKat then went on to say that Josh would sometimes make up ridiculous songs about just about anything.\n\n\"Once I was steam cleaning the floor – because I like to steam clean. And he sat down at the piano and made up a song called 'Steam Cleaner Lady,'\" she added.\n\nAlas, their ridiculous-song-filled romance was not meant to be.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAfter nearly two years of dating, Kat and Josh broke up in the summer of 2016. According to E! News, a source reported that the breakup was mutual.\n\n\"They are still friends and care about each other, but it’s not the right time for them now as a couple,\" the source told the outlet. It's safe to say he was one of her more serious relationships before Andrew W.K.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nBefore Josh Groban, Kat Dennings dated Nick Zano.\n\nJust a few months after Nick broke up with Haylie Duff, he and Kat got together at the end of 2011, according to Us Weekly. Fans of 2 Broke Girls will recognize Nick as Johnny — Kat’s character Max’s friend and sometime crush. Apparently, this was a case of life imitating art, as the two began a real-life, off-set relationship.\n\nHowever, Kat and Nick’s relationship also did not last. The two 2 Broke Girls actors broke up in real life, just as their respective characters decided a romantic relationship was not in the cards.\n\nApparently, it all worked out in the end. Because as of right now, she is blissfully engaged and seems over the moon about it."
