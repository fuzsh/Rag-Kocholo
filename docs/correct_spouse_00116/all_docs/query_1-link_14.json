        "text": "Current cast members Haylie Duff, Ashley Austin Morris, Penny Fuller, Sharon Lawrence, and Myra Lucretia Taylor celebrated joining Nora and Delia Ephron’s Off-Broadway hit, Love, Loss, and What I Wore, at the Westside Theatre on Thursday, July 1. The cast will continue in the show through July 25.\n\nGuests at the performance included Duff’s boyfriend, actor Nick Zano, her sister, actress Hilary Duff, and Tony Award winner Swoosie Kurtz.\n\nBased on Ilene Beckerman’s 1995 book about clothes and the memories they trigger, the production is directed by Karen Carpenter, and recently won a 2010 Drama Desk Award. The show is produced by Daryl Roth.\n\nA portion of the production’s proceeds will benefit Dress for Success, a charity that provides work clothing and job support for low-income women. Audience members are invited to donate their gently-used purses and other accessories in the theater’s lobby."
