        "text": "Blonde beauty Haylie Duff is planning to tie the knot, after her boyfriend Matt Rosenberg proposed to her earlier this week - with a gorgeous diamond ring.\n\nThe 29-year-old star posed for an adorable Instagram snap with her arms around her handsome fiancé and signed it off \"The Future Mrs Rosenberg\".\n\nHaylie, who has just landed her own US TV show Real Girl's Kitchen, took to her blog to share the news, writing: \"This week has seriously just become the best week of my life!\"\n\nThe elder sibling to child star Hilary Duff said: \"Matt just took me by total surprise and proposed... on April Fool's Day of all days!\".\n\nExcited Haylie then confessed she \"couldn't wait to say yes! after the genuine and sweet moment\" - aww.\n\nHilary, who recently announced her split from husband Mike Comrie gave her sister a shout-out on Twitter: \"So happy to not have to keep this news in!! My beautiful sister and her amazing boyfriend are engaged!!!!\"\n\nChuffed Rosenberg then posted a too-cute-for-words picture of him with his arms around his fiancé, adding: \"She said Yes!\"\n\nThe bride-to-be previously dated Nick Zano for three years until their split in 2011."
