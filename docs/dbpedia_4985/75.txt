Nathan Douglas is UK Athletics Triple Jump Champion. In 2022, after an incredible career, Nathan retired from competition.

To mark his retirement we worked with Nathan to shoot this iconic moment, capturing not only the shape and form of the sport but the emotive nature of the moment. Captured on Nikon. Profoto Strobes.

The concept

The creative concept around the piece was to capture every emotive stage of Nathanâ€™s final jump. The concentration, the focus, the engagement with the fans, the power in the jump, that sand release and finally walking away with his studs.

Studio shoot with full speed action using Profoto strobes.
