        "text": "CROSS CITY, Florida. — As Mike Puerner figured it, if Hurricane Idalia hadn't taken out his Horseshoe Beach home, neither would Hurricane Debby.\n\nBut that doesn't mean he wasn't stressed leaving it to take refuge in an inland hotel.\n\n\"I've gotten bits and pieces of information that have calmed me down,\" the 79-year-old Dixie County resident said Monday afternoon, hours after Debby drubbed Florida. \"You still just want to be there and see for yourself.\"\n\nResidents of the Nature Coast have had two hurricanes in less than a year. While Debby was weaker, Dixie and Taylor County locals still have strong memories of Idalia's 125-mph sustained winds and storm surge. They remember their neighbors who lost homes.\n\nMonday's floodwaters brought back feelings of stress and anxiety. And, while weaker, Debby also brought 80-mph winds, as well as flooding. The storm may have killed at least four people.\n\nAfter briefly checking on her Horseshoe Beach house and running a generator, Renee McConaughey drove back to the same hotel — the Historic Putnam Hotel — in Cross City. Her dogs, Mary Jane and Mya Jewel, looked out the back windows.\n\nLast year during Idalia, she lost all the food in their refrigerator.\n\n\"I don't know how long it's going to take to get power back, but we're going to do the best we can,\" McConaughey said.\n\nPuerner hadn't gone and checked on his house yet, planning to go Tuesday, when some of the cleanup crews had cleared.\n\nA neighbor who had ridden out the storm told Puerner that his house is, in fact, still standing. And it even had steps leading up to it — those had been recently replaced after Idalia snatched them away.\n\nTaylor County residents arrive in Dixie County, Florida\n\nThen there were those who came to Dixie County because most of its inland businesses, notably in Cross City, had power.\n\nFloodwaters kept Charles Morris away from his flooded Steinhatchee home that afternoon. He made it out of the driveway that morning and got to Cross City to fill up on gas, but he knew he wouldn't be able to make it back until the tide went down.\n\nHe said Hurricane Debby, which hit the Florida coast at 7 a.m., \"got here quick.\"\n\nMorris had damage to his house last year during Hurricane Idalia, and he said he's expecting some damage again.\n\n\"If you're going to live on the coast, it's part of it,\" Morris said. \"But we've all got to get these insurance rates down or we're all going to move out of here.\"\n\nPerry, Florida, residents search for positive in everything, even hurricanes\n\nGrocery shopping and McDonald's brought Wendy and Donnie Johnson into Cross City from their Perry house, which is about an hour's drive away. The married couple said they tried to find the positive in everything, including hurricanes.\n\nDonnie said Hurricane Idalia last year wiped out a number of trees on their property — but he found it a “blessing, in a way.”\n\n“It tore a lot of dead trees down,” he said, munching on a burger in the fast-food eatery.\n\nThe latest hurricane appears to have wrought far less destruction to Perry than Idalia. But, even last year, Wendy said the human and structural damages could have been a lot worse: “It’s like God was circling over us.”\n\nDonnie, 74, said he attributes his positive attitude to his experiences in Vietnam and with lung cancer and diabetes: “Why not be happy?”\n\nWhen asked what makes her positive, Wendy said, “Him.”\n\nTheir 17-year-old grandson doesn’t necessarily see eye-to-eye with them, though.\n\n“I didn’t really care too much for it,” Nathan Couture said, looking back on Idalia. “That was probably the most upsetting thing: the internet and power down. That’s what I look at, but they look on the more positive side.\""
