        "text": "On Monday’s edition of Zolak & Bertrand, Patriots LB Jahlani Tavai explained his outlook on how the defense has looked during training camp.\n\nI think we’re having a great camp…\n\nMarc Bertrand:\n\nWhat was it like seeing one of your defensive teammates going to the other side of the ball?\n\nJahlani Tavai:\n\nOh, it was fun. He definitely got me on one of the plays.\n\nScott Zolak:\n\nWas that you he got? I’m sorry, I was up here snapping out.\n\nJahlani Tavai:\n\nNah, he got me today. I’ll make sure I get to get him tomorrow. But it was good seeing Keion and Pharm over there on the other side. Just another opportunity for them to, you know, make the team and show their skillset.\n\nScott Zolak:\n\nAlright, you’ve played your way into the linebacker role on this football team. You got a pretty good set of them. Now, you’ve been around for a while now. Do you understand like if somebody goes down, this unit has to pick it up. But with Christian Barmore going down with the blood clots, you feel it’s more pressure on you guys as a linebacker unit?\n\nJahlani Tavai:\n\nMan, I don’t see pressure on the field. None of us feel that pressure. It’s football, you know? Stuff happens. You never know what the circumstances are, but it’s just another day and another opportunity for whoever is the next guy up. You know, we’ve always had that mentality. That being said, you know, losing a guy like Christian Barmore is a a big thing .That’s one of our brothers on the field and I definitely love having him on the field. That being said, we just we got to make sure the next guy is prepared and ready to take that new role.\n\n…\n\nMarc Bertrand:\n\nHow do you feel overall this camp is gone for the defense? There been a lot of days where people watch these practices and say man, the defense is winning the day again. I think today was one of those days. How do you feel it’s going?\n\nJahlani Tavai:\n\nI think we’re having a great camp. We’re taking one day at a time, like always and it’s always a new opportunity because we don’t know what the offense is going to bring out or run that that specific day. But it’s our job as players to just adapt and you know just come prepared every day. You get to be out here in the 90° weather and play the game we love, so we always take that approach.\n\nListen to the full segment!\n\nTyler Milliken started out at the Sports Hub as an intern in 2020 for the Zolak & Bertrand program before eventually becoming the associate producer in late 2021.
