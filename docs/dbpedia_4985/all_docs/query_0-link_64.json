        "text": "As Nicholas Isaacson begins his third year as head coach for Clear Creek High School football, he’s also walking into his third consecutive league change. But this year, the team dynamic is changing drastically also.\n\nThe Golddiggers went 2-7 overall and 0-5 in the 1A League 5 in 2022. In 2023, the Golddiggers moved into the 1A Frontier League and improved to 3-6, but still lost every league game 0-5.\n\nThis season, not only is there another league change, but the Golddiggers will now be an eight-man football team playing in the A-8 Central League. As the name suggests, eight active players will be on the field at a time versus the normal 11.\n\nThe move hopes to chase a more even playing field for the Golddiggers’ already small team.\n\nAlso, the field is smaller to accommodate fewer active players: only 40 yards wide, about 13 yards shorter than the normal 53 ⅓ width of an 11-man field.\n\n“Our enrollment sort of necessitates that to some extent,” Isaacson said. “We were the smallest team in division 1A by approximately a standard deviation. Significantly smaller than the next smallest team, outside of a few private schools.”\n\nHe said a typical gameday in past seasons consisted of about 22 Golddiggers competing against schools with 60 players and student populations between 300 and 600 (versus Clear Creek’s 180 students).\n\nMoving to an eight-man team will be a new experience for Isaacson and his players. Though there will be a bit of a learning curve, Isaacson said the team is excited about the change. He’s done his homework consulting with dozens of coaches with eight-man experience in Colorado and beyond.\n\n“A lot of the concepts translate and a lot of the schemes translate,” Isaacson said. “I attended a night coaching clinic in Oregon and attended all of the eight-man seminars that they had, and found that great with not just the presentations but picking all coaches’ brains.”\n\nThere was some initial resistance with worry about how the change would affect recruitment, but players have acclimated well, he said. He expects more success throughout the season now, and the players know staying in 1A would make that difficult.\n\nThe change also makes practice more productive and efficient, he added.\n\n“We’re having a full starting defense almost against a full starting offense, more accustomed to what I’m used to coaching in bigger programs,” he said. “We’re able to platoon a lot more.”\n\nGoing into year three, Isaacson is ready to crank up the expectations. The culture is shifting and players are more bought in than in recent seasons.\n\nUnsportsmanlike penalties are nearly extinct for a team that enjoyed many of them over the years.\n\n“Our players are now leaders, not just on the field but in the classroom. Almost half the team were first-team, academic all-state,” Isaacson said. “So that was a big accomplishment. We had two people going on to top 20 colleges in terms of academics so I think that’s fantastic. Generally speaking, the kids are just working way harder.”\n\nVoluntary practices are ongoing currently, and participation is up big-time. The coaches get 15 to 23 kids typically attending, compared to mandatory practices in previous years when he’d be lucky to get 10. The younger generation is leading the charge, Isaacson said.\n\nBut there are upperclassmen he’ll rely on heavily during this transition year. He expects a lot of success from them. They should set the tone for Clear Creek.\n\nSeniors Alex Shriner (offensive line), Logan Ginter (linebacker and running back) and Asher Isaacson (tight end and linebacker) are this year’s captains.\n\n“All three of those guys will be big components,” Isaacson said. “Logan was an honorable mention all-state last year in 1A, so I expect him to have a big season. He’ll certainly be a highlight for us. Alex was hurt most of the year last year and he was brand new to football. He was doing fantastic but then hurt his back early. He’s 6-foot-4, call it 210 pounds and maybe the second-fastest guy on the team.”\n\nBoth Ginter and Shriner could probably play in college, Isaacson said. But keep an eye on Noah Clark (a senior speedy corner and running back), Jacob Young (the team’s longtime starting quarterback in his junior season) and junior linebacker Nathan Guerrero.\n\n“Our goal this year is to make the playoffs,” Isaacson said. “I think it’s a realistic goal. We just need to avoid the injury bug and get our assignments done. And the kids are putting in the time to do that and the coaches are putting in the time as well … all those coaches are fantastic and they’re working hard.”\n\nMaking the playoffs means the Golddiggers would need to win, at the very least, six games, Isaacson said.\n\n“To be safe, I’d say we need to be 7-2 or 8-1,” Isaacson said. “Expectations to win are certainly higher.”\n\nThe schedule is no easy cruise, with teams like Byers, Lyons and Front Range Christian on the calendar.\n\nClear Creek kicks off the season against South Park (who is transitioning to an eight-man team also) at home on Aug. 29. The Golddiggers played South Park in 1A last year and won 46-6 in the third week of the season.\n\nView the Golddiggers’ full schedule at this link.\n\nCan’t get enough sports?
