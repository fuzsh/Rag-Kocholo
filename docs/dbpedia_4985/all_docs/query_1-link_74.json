        "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A former division chief at the Hendersonville Fire Department has pleaded guilty to cocaine distribution charges.\n\nNathan Douglas, a 25-year veteran of the department, pleaded guilty Monday to distribution and conspiracy charges before U.S. District Court Judge Todd Campbell. Douglas faces a maximum of four years in federal prison, assistant U.S. Attorney Paul O'Brien said.\n\nFederal agents began investigating the cocaine case in the summer, O'Brien said. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the 18th Judicial Drug Task Force received information from an informant about someone dealing cocaine in the Hendersonville area. After a series of undercover drug buys, agents learned the source was a high-ranking fire official, federal prosecutors said.\n\nAn informant working under the direction of agents made cocaine purchases directly from Douglas several times. Some of the drug deals took place in a fast-food parking lot that was within 1,000 feet of a public school. Selling drugs within that range of a school will likely increase Douglas' sentence.\n\nDouglas was arrested in August and resigned his job in September."
