        "text": "With high school football beginning this month, we're previewing each Northern 5A team. Today's team: Douglas.\n\nDouglas\n\nNuts and bolts\n\nMascot: Tigers\n\nColors: Orange and black\n\nLeague:Northern 5A Division II\n\nLast season: 10-2 overall, 5-0 in league (first place in the 5A Division III)\n\nCoach: Kyle Mays (12-18 overall, 6-12 in league in three seasons at Douglas)\n\nSeason overview\n\nAll-region players lost: RB Connor Jackson, LB Cole Smalley, WR/LB Trace Estes, TE/DL Kyle Koontz, OL Austin Pitts, OL Jack Ross, OL Michael White, OL Ledger Soule, DL Trevor Shaver, DL Nathan Stevens, LB/K Aaron Tekansik, LB Zachary Westbrook, DB Austin Dekruyf, DB Aaron Moss, DB Owen Evans, ATH Andrew Strand.\n\nReturning all-region players: OL Sage Aide, QB Jackson Ovard, OL Michael Cahill, DB Zachary Jackson, DB Brenton Weston.\n\nIn short: After a disastrous 2022 season, the Douglas Tigers bounced back and had a glorious 2023. Led by now-graduated running back and 5A Division III MVP Connor Jackson, Douglas went 9-1 in the regular season and 5-0 in the league, only dropping to Reed in a 21-14 loss in week five. The Tigers outscored their opponents 318-69 before going into the postseason, which was the second-best point differential in Northern Nevada behind Bishop Manogue. All was set for Douglas to make a deep postseason run. However, after beating North Valleys, 47-0, in the semifinals, the Tigers were stunned by Galena, losing the regional championship, 18-7.\n\nNow, after being promoted to 5A Division II, Douglas looks to pick up where it left off and make a name for itself in its new home. While facing higher levels of competition, the Tigers will have to go through a rebuilding process, as 16 of their 21 all-region players graduated last spring. With a young core looking to develop and take the reigns, head coach Kyle Mays is hopeful for a promising season.\n\nThree players to watch\n\n* QB Jackson Ovard: Returning for his second season as a varsity starter, Ovard played well in his junior year. He passes for 1,174 yards, 11 touchdowns, and five interceptions with a completion percentage of 55.2 percent. Thanks to his performance, Ovard took home all-region honors as the honorable mention behind Galena's Colson Kermode and Wooster's Carlos Lopez. Going into his final year as a leader of a young Tigers team, Ovard plans to help develop the new guys on the squad and help push them to new heights.\n\n* OL Michael Cahill: An offensive lineman of shorter stature than most, Cahill played a massive part in the success of Douglas' run game last season. For his efforts, he made the all-region team as an honorable mention, sharing honors with five of his teammates from last season, including first-teamer Sage Aide. Having already started building the team's camaraderie, Cahill looks to continue building the Douglas brotherhood up as a whole in his final year at Douglas.\n\n* RB/LB Evan Youmans: Playing behind Jackson in his first season on varsity, Youmans still had an impressive resume for the touches he had. Through 30 carries, Youmans ran for 194 yards and two touchdowns. Youmans also played middle linebacker, getting eight total tackles and a fumble recovery through three games with the defense. Much like Ovard, Youmans is trying to help push both his current teammates and those who will take his place after his time is up to keep Douglas performing at a high level.\n\nQuote to note\n\n\"I think it would be disrespectful to say it would be an easy jump. You're playing the best in Northern Nevada. All five of those teams are really, really good and really well coached. They're doing the same stuff that we are as far as summer practices out in this heat and getting tougher. Their kids are putting in the work as well. But we're excited. We always want to compete with the best and see where we fall within that group.\"â€” Head coach Kyle Mays\n\nSchedule\n\nAug. 16:at Fernley\n\nAug. 23:at Elko\n\nAug. 30: vs. Spring Creek\n\nSept. 6:at North Valleys\n\nSept. 13:at Carson\n\nSept. 20:at Reno\n\nSept. 27: vs. Spanish Springs\n\nOct. 4:at McQueen\n\nOct. 18: vs. Reed\n\nOct. 24: vs. Bishop Manogue\n\nYou can watch the full preview below."
