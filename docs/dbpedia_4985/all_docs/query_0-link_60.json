        "text": "EDMOND, Okla. (KOKH) - An Oklahoma couple who survived a near-death experience during a scuba trip gone wrong is speaking out about the dark times they experienced while stranded in the ocean.\n\nNathan and Kim Maker spent nearly two days drifting in the Gulf of Mexico before they were rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard. The two experienced scuba divers became separated from their diving group on the morning of July 24 as strong currents pushed them away.\n\nAs the hours dragged on, the couple say they saw rescue planes about 20 times in the distance, but they were too far away to be found. Dehydration and exhaustion started setting in. At one point, Nathan Maker thought he saw his dead father standing on the waves.\n\n“I’m like, ‘Kim, I’m pretty sure I’m having a hallucination,’” he said.\n\n“Which was scary for me. I knew that his body was deteriorating, his mind. We were exhausted,” Kim Maker said.\n\nEven facing the worst possible outcome about 30 hours into the incident, the couple marveled at a pod of dolphins that swam underneath them. They say they were “totally geeking out.”\n\n“‘Cause I was like, ‘That is the coolest thing.’ Really, we’re in a pretty serious situation. We were close to death. But still, we saw dolphins,” the Makers said.\n\nAs the couple went into night two at sea, chances of their rescue were looking dim until the Coast Guard aircraft crew spotted two flashing lights in the water.\n\n“He was doing these crisscross patterns over the top of us, and I had my light on the whole time. I was waving it above us, like, ‘We’re here. We’re here. We’re here,’” Kim Maker said.\n\nAlmost 40 hours after the Makers were lost at sea, they were rescued. They say that when their heroes found them, there was only an hour left before the rescue operation would have turned into a recovery operation.\n\n“They were like, ‘We’re gonna pick you up and get you in the boat.’ We had no strength… They reached down. They literally plucked us from death,” the couple said. “I just start crying. I’m trying to hug the boat captain. I’m behind him, and I’m putting my arms all over him.”\n\nThe Makers praised the crew of Coast Guard Cutter Edgar Culbertson, the ship’s commanding officer and the Coast Guard stations out of Corpus Christi, Houston, Port O’Connor and the Heartland that helped with their search and rescue.\n\n“I had no interest in surviving without you,” Kim Maker told her husband. “So, yeah, it got pretty dark. But turns out, it just took a couple more hours, and we were saved. We made it, babe.”\n\nThe couple were asked if they thought any safety lapses on behalf of the diving company played a role in the incident, but they declined to comment.\n\nThey are encouraging everyone to celebrate National Coast Guard Day on Sunday."
