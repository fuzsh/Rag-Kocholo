Some policies are designed with a one-size-fits-all philosophy and may not provide adequate protection for special features like swimming pools, garages, carports, tree houses, and children's play equipment. Your home insurance policy should not be a mystery. Let the team at Nathan Douglas Gleason help you determine whether your policy is really providing the kind of protection your home requires. For years, Nathan Douglas Gleason has helped homeowners discover the right coverage for their needs.\n\nEvery home and residential property is a little bit different, which means coverage should be tailored to meet each situation.

We want to make sure you have the type and amount of coverage you need so that you and your family are prepared for any eventuality. We will explain in understandable language term versus permanent insurance and we will discuss the types of life insurance that can best fit your needs.\n\nThe amount of coverage your family needs is largely determined by factors such as age, income, debt, number of dependents, long-term educational needs, monthly expenses, long-term goals and desired length of coverage. We will explain in easily-understandable terms whole life insurance and universal life insurance and why you may want permanent insurance.\n\nAs you enjoy the now, don’t forget to protect your family’s future.

Nathan Douglas Gleason understands this, which is why our business insurance solutions are customized to your industry, business size, and factors local to Alameda.\n\nNathan Douglas Gleason can discuss a business owner's policy with you to get you started. The business owner's policy is the closest thing to a comprehensive plan there is when it comes to business insurance, and it covers most of what most companies need. From there, an On Your Side® Review can help to assess any additional coverage options or policies that would help round out your company's risk management. These may include provisions like cyber liability, accounts receivable insurance, and equipment breakdown coverage.\n\nFinding the right coverage for your company is important, but that doesn't mean you need to know everything there is to know about insurance coverage to be secure. That's what our agents are here for and why Nathan Douglas Gleason works with Nationwide. This combination of expertise and access to the customizable coverage makes certain that our agents are ready to advise you about your business insurance needs. Call (510) 694-7700 today to get answers to your questions or buy policies over the phone.
