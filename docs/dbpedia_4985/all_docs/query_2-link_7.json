        "text": "What brought you to Bridgewater College?\n\nA family member attended Bridgewater College and got me interested in checking out the campus. I immediately felt at home the first time I set foot here. The students, staff and faculty made me feel like a part of the community instantly. I could tell they would all take the time to get to know me as an individual instead of as another name on a roster or face in the crowd. Because of this, I made some of the most important relationships of my life on this campus and continue to cherish them to this day! I returned to Bridgewater College as an employee out of a deep desire to return to the Valley and, if possible, to work in some capacity for my beloved alma mater. I see my work here as my way of saying “thank you” to the BC community for all the love and support they extended to me and to ensure that future students can have a similar life-changing and community-informed experience.\n\nWhat advice do you have about the college search process?\n\nWhile it can be tempting to have family or friends “choose” your school for you, it’s important for you to understand what YOU want out of your college experience. It’s important to know what you want to study and gain academically and professionally from a school. And, it’s important that your choice meets your mental, emotional and social needs and fits overall with your individual personality. A school can have a great program in your chosen field of study but not meet your other personal needs or mesh with your traits, and this can put a huge damper on what should be a largely positive experience. During this very important process, be sure to understand what you as an individual need to thrive for the next four years and make decisions based on that understanding.\n\nWhat is the most rewarding part of your job?\n\nI love meeting new and prospective students as they undergo such a formative experience. Making my college decision was exciting and stressful, and I want to help make the path toward making these decisions as smooth as possible for both students and parents so they can enjoy the moment. It’s also wonderful to both be part of an institution that has had such a positive impact on my life and see future generations benefit from it in real time.\n\nWhat brought you to Bridgewater College?\n\nI really liked the atmosphere at the college during my orientation. The campus was beautiful and therapeutic. The students were really friendly and I felt really comfortable interacting with the faculty and staff. After orientation, I knew this is where I wanted to be.\n\nWhat advice do you have about the college search process?\n\nHave a list of what you are looking for in a college and go on as many college tours as you can. A college looking good digitally can be extremely different in person. As you go on tours, do not be afraid to ask questions. This is the best way to find out what daily life on a college campus is like, and whether or not you will feel comfortable there.\n\nWhat is the most rewarding part of your job?\n\nI enjoy getting to meet new and diverse students every day and being able to help students with their college selection process is one of the most rewarding feelings that come with the position.\n\nWhat brought you to Bridgewater College?\n\nWhat brought me to Bridgewater was the prestigious football program and long history of great athletes. After visiting with my family and seeing all of the programs and opportunities that came with attending Bridgewater College, I decided to attend.\n\nWhat advice do you have about the college search process?\n\nWhen visiting colleges make a physical or mental list of the things you what to get out of attending that school. Also, when you are on the tour pay attention to what the college is like during the day. Is it busy between classes? Do the students look like they enjoy the environment or are they mainly in their dorms not interacting with one another?\n\nWhat is the most rewarding part of your job?\n\nThe most rewarding thing about my job is being able to give students the opportunity to go to college and meeting amazing new people and families every day.\n\nWhat brought you to Bridgewater College?\n\nI knew Bridgewater was home when I came for an overnight visit with the Women’s Lacrosse Team. In one night, I learned that this is the family I want to spend the next four years around. I also enjoyed the location, I was close enough to home with still getting the independence I desired.\n\nWhat advice do you have about the college search process?\n\nI would suggest to visit everything from small schools to large schools. Narrow down the list to 3-5 colleges and visit the campuses again, this will allow you to get the best feeling for the college as a whole. Take your time in the process, it is important to be confident in your choice as this is where you will spend at least 4 years of your life.\n\nWhat is the most rewarding part of your job?\n\nI love that I have the ability to share the passion I have for the college to prospective students. Meeting with new students and parents allows me to ease some of the stress going to college and I enjoy knowing I helped make the process smoother.\n\nWhat brought you to Bridgewater College?\n\nI came to Bridgewater College for a football game when I was 12. I fell in love with the campus instantly. When it was time to start considering colleges, there was no question. I was going to BC.\n\nAfter graduating from college, I worked for a recreation department, teaching nursery school and running an after-school program for elementary school students. But something was missing. Four years after graduation I returned and have been introducing new students to Bridgewater for over 20 years.\n\nWhat advice do you have about the college search process?\n\nYour friends and family can be a good source of information about colleges/universities and their programs. But you should NOT stop your search with their point of view. Discover and explore colleges and universities that are of particular interest to you. Visit a variety of college campuses. While there, meet with an admissions counselor to receive current information about the college and the academic programs. Be sure to talk with students and faculty, and explore the campus on a tour. Throughout the college search process, keep asking yourself – “Will this college/university challenge me academically, provide me an opportunity to further develop the skills needed for me to lead a successful life and allow me to grow personally.”\n\nWhat is one of the most rewarding parts of your job?\n\nMeeting and working with students and their families. I enjoy meeting students during visits at their high schools and at the college fairs. I learn about their school, what they want to do in college, sports, majors and other interests. I try really hard to get to know them and help them with the college search process. When they come to campus for an open house or a personal campus visit I can better assist them because I have spent the time getting to know them. It is important for prospective students to experience a campus visit, not just walk around and see the buildings. So, by adding a personal touch the students are able to feel at home with the people that make up our College community."
