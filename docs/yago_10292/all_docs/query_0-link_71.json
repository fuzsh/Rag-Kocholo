        "text": "One day a few months ago, I found myself on a social Media page involving remembrance of the Marx Brothers, I suddenly found myself in the middle of a debate concerning the climax of their 1936 film “A Day at the Races”. One side accused the filmmakers and the Marx Brothers of being racist and dealing in exploitation of racial stereotypes, while the other said the film was actually espousing the virtues of Socialism and the bet-winning African-Americans represented a kind of uprising of the have-nots in America due to the harsh financial climate of the Depression, that living through the Depression was no different for African-Americans than before it, so things looked better to some.\n\nEither way, it got me to thinking about Marx Brothers films, and how many of them had big ticket messages like “Duck Soup”, while they also had total nonsense fests like “Monkey Business”. When people are discussing the Marx Brothers in future decades and centuries, “Duck Soup” and “A Night at the Opera” will be mentioned first, the two films have the most urgency and thought-out messaging of the comedy group’s legendary filmography. With most modern comedy films being of a formulaic nature, one forgets that movies used to have sweeping social messages veiled in snarcastics. Woody Allen’s “Sleeper”, Milos Forman’s “Taking Off”, Mel Brooks’ “Blazing Saddles”, John Landis’ “Trading Places” are all examples of optimistic comedies that were going to change the world with their wisdom and insight. If only the public would listen.\n\nIn the Spring of 1980, I found myself in Manhattan with my Mother and Sister, staying in the Apartment for a few days with a family friend who was a practicing Buddhist (and also had the latest edition of Penthouse-the Caligula edition on his coffee table.), he lived on the West Side of Manhattan, near 80th Street. The journey to NYC involved a shit ton of walking due to we got there in the middle of a transit strike. My sister and I dealing with a Spartan culture at school of macho posturing from our Southern classmates made dealing with the street freaks of New York a walk in the park, so to speak. We welcomed the challenge of showing Mom how much we could march, especially with the background of the eccentric bustling streets of New York City to motivate us. Our trip involved eating, shopping and going to see several movies in theaters a day. On a Thursday afternoon, we went to see a highly regarded (according to the New York Times, Variety and the Independent Film Journal) movie titled “Simon” from 1980.\n\nThree things off the bat intruiged me about this film upon my first viewing. First, it seemed to be a quickly-made lampooning of the high intensity Horror Thriller “Altered States”, the latter of which had received high praise as a thinking person’s Horror film. Secondly, by 1980 Woody Allen was still making movies, but they weren’t funny now, they were full of introspective therapy. “Simon” appeared to be created by people who had worked with Allen on his earlier groundbreaking work and wanted to keep making movies containing outrageous surface plots adjoined by embedded social commentary. The third point was that the movie appeared to be a Woody Allen-type comedy except it would star Adam Arkin. I always enjoyed Arkin’s dry and neurotic delivery, blows my mind that he could switch gears as an actor and pull off his role as the menacing thug in “Wait Until Dark”. “Simon” is clairvoyant in it’s portrayal of manipulated mass hysteria, of mysterious Government contracted Ivy League eggheads who may or may not mean us cerebral harm in exchange for large Government endowments.\n\n“Simon” opens at a secret High-tech think tank with a futuristic look titled the Institute for Advanced Concepts, located in the lush Green hills of Vermont. We are told this fictitious group, through the use of one of their most effective crowd controlling devices, the television, allows the Scientists’ work to carry substantial effect. The Scientists are a collection of snarky individuals; Austin Pendleton as the insidious lead Scientist, Dr. Carl Becker. Wallace Shawn, Max Wright, Jayant Burundi and William Finley play Becker ‘s cohorts, they all have a clinical and haughty view of the masses. Always up to something, they are now onto a project where they want to hypnotize a subject into believing it’s an extraterrestrial. They need a test subject with no family,\n\nWith the aide of a giant database-scanning computer which looks like a 15-foot high telephone and is voiced by Actress Comedienne Louise Lasser, the Scientists find who they believe to be the perfect fit for a test subject, a Man teaching at a small College named Simon Mendelson. The Scientists have pretentious sounding Euro-sounding names like Erich Von Dangen and Hugo Hunterwasser. Simon is perfect to be exploited, he believes himself to be a student of Man’s primordial behavior, that something lives in the back of man’s unconcious. The Scientists, led by Becker, want Simon to believe that they think he is brilliant and want to assist him in his pursuit of learning of Man’s origins. In reality, they want to place Simon in a condition where they wipe his mind clean and convince him that he landed here from another world.\n\nWith this particular experiment, however, the Scientists will prove that they can reprogram people to believe whatever the Scientists want them to believe. The Scientists will attempt to use an isolation tank and sleep deprivation to achieve their goal. Madeline Kahn plays a fake expert used to seduce Simon so he will be more pliable. When things go slowly at first, Kahn’s character is encouraged to talk to Simon about things involving Death so as to arouse him. The Scientists get Simon to agree to go into an isolation tank for what he thinks is going to be 80 hours, which would be a new World record. The Scientists plan to leave him in the tank for 200 hours, hopefully rendering his ability to resist their idea to reprogram him futile.\n\nThe Scientists pull Simon out of his deep hyperbearic tank sleep and at first, they are quite pleased as Simon performs a three-to-five minute one man improvisation act in front of the Scientists in which he physically recreates the evolution of Man from the earliest tiny organisms in the Ocean to Homo Erectus. Arkin’s gift for physical comedy is on full display in a scene that could have been ruined by overacting. Arkin’s mannerisms and gestures sell the bit perfectly, including a brief stint as the Monkeys from the opening of “2001: A Space Odyssey” and he acts out the Industrial Revolution as a one-Man assembly line. Once Simon’s mental progression reaches the present day, an unexpected twist occurs. The Professor-who-now-believes-he-is-an-Alien has observed Modern Society over the last few days on Earth and feels that Earth’s society is fucked up beyond repair and only a genius extraterrestrial like himself can fix it.\n\nAs funny as the first half of the film is in a high-brow fashion (With a few Sophomoric lines tossed in), the second half of the film is more obvious, yet it is incessant in making it’s points. Part of the point is how modern individuals have been subjugated (whether intentionally or not) by Television and passive watching activities. That manipulative super brainy folk may be behind what you’re watching, looking for a desired effect. Simon is the savior and defender of we, the audience. he represents our Super Ego.\n\nOnce news of Simon’s belief that he is an extraterrestrial and needs to save mankind from itself hits the mainstream, it catches the eye back in New York of Simon’s daffy yet lucid girlfriend Lisa, played by Judy Gaubert. I was very familiar with the Actress’ work from watching her on the kids’ show from the 1970’s , “The Electric Company”. She had a similar look and style to several Female TV comediennes of the late 1970’s, such as Gilda Radner, Rita Rudner and Andrea Martin. If this was a Woody Allen movie, she would be the Diane Keaton equivalent. Lisa drives to Vermont to see what is wrong with Simon, at the same time, a group of soldiers and advisors from the Army show up as well, Simon has become a National concern to the Military. The General in charge is played with tight-lipped straight man zeal by Fred Gwynne, who also supplies a sleepy Southern accent. Judy learns that the Military plans to get rid of Simon, so she and Simon go on the lam in one of the think tank’s specialized broadcasting vans, a vehicle that allows Simon to preempt broadcasting across the country and give more philosophical talks to the nation from any undisclosed location he chooses.\n\nWhile on the lam, Simon and Lisa befriend a benevolent New England commune who worship Television and everything on it. They consider Simon to be a deity before them as they have seen him on the “sacred box” and follow his every word. Simon’s rants come off now like an old guy with a podcast ranting about the world’s loss of common decency. Like Woody Allen’s “Sleeper”, “Simon” slips in a lot of jabs at Modern Society with shots at all sides. The Right-Wing seems to be represented by the Military, stiff and reactionary and dim-witted. The Left are the Scientists, self-absorbed and passive-aggressively manipulative, they worship technology over humanity.\n\nThe Scientists are portrayed as pleasant on the surface, but underneath they have little concern for the common folk. Like a forerunner to the brilliant relatively recent sci-fi film, “Ex-Machina”, Dr. Becker has the hots for the giant phone computer, they engage in “phone sex”. Becker literally pushing all the right buttons to get the Louise Lasser-voiced computer to “turn on”. When the other Scientists are exposed to a nerve gas meant to be used on Simon, they regress to toddler-aged behavior and now require a Military babysitter. Gwynne as the dim bulb Military commander is perfectly cast, he telegraphs his two-dimensional thinking.\n\nThe commune in this looks like a cross between a giant encounter group and peaceful Brand Davidians. Led by Adolphe Greene, (At first I thought it was LORNE Greene, or Strother Martin) the commune worships from old TV guides. “A reading from the book of Rhoda, who came from Maud” is announced by the Pastor before a reading of TV guide scripture. Marshall Brickman, the film’s director, has no qualms adding tacky pop-culture references to this. When Simon expects Lisa to be amazed when they first learn of the commune’s adoration of Simon, Lisa retorts “Have you ever heard of Charles Manson?”\n\nMy guess is that only the Urban intellectual and maybe progressive college crowd saw “Simon” when it was first released, can’t imagine who else would go. It seems too heady for the masses, I doubt it received much play outside of big cities and art houses. Median viewers might have responded to it’s goofiness and slapstick moments, but the wordplay which includes some of the film’s best jokes and exchanges would have gone right over small town USA’s collective heads.\n\nIn retrospect, what “Simon” does deliver to modern audiences is that there used to be a middle ground that was attached to neither political viewpoint. When Simon goes on his lengthy rants, it could be a mishmash of points made by social commentators like Andy Rooney, Norman Mailer, William F Buckley and my late Italian Grandmother. In his speeches, Simon discusses modern annoyances which have worn us all down. How our lives are now constantly interrupted and delayed by opportunists, charlatans and hucksters who do not abide by unspoken laws of civility that the rest of us are expected to adhere to. Simon is not a violent despot, he’s a dictatorial cantankerous old Jewish Grandpa. Simon is an advocate for virulent pragmatism, in his rants to the world he says things like “All lawyers who lose in court have to go to jail with their clients.” Or “From now on, all Hawaiian muzak will no longer be allowed to be played in elevators or closed spaces where people can’t get away from it.” Finally, ” anyone who produces Nuclear or toxic waste at work, should have to take it home with them.”\n\nTwo thoughts swirled around in my brain when I watched “Simon” this time. One was that “Simon” was spot on predicting that we as a public are so shallow that we would begin to worship celebrities, in part for the fame alone. To the point that we wish celebrities to be our spiritual leaders and even our rulers. But also exposure to TV and other sources of media has dulled our brains, stymied our intellectual growth, we think more like delayed children, who see something on Television (a manufactured environment) and believe it’s real and that we have a real connection to it. Director Neil LaBute mines this same territory in the savagely underrated late 90’s comedy ” Nurse Betty”.\n\nThe second thought was in watching Gaubert and Arkin together as a thinking and sensitive East Coast couple. They take their kid to the park, they lay in the grass, they daydream and talk philosophy, they bring along healthy unpackaged food, they bring a book to read and a ball to play with, all old-fashioned staples of the 1970’s Middle Class literate family of which I was a part of one as well. When did it all have to contain an identity, politically as well as culturally? When did we have to start wearing clothing and jewelry and engage in activities that announce are positions on things to others?\n\nSure, by 2024 standards, Simon and Lisa look like a stereotypical Left-wing Jewish couple. Yet, by 1980 standards they wouldn’t necessarily be branded with the term “liberal”. In 1980, they could have been soft conservatives, there was more of a commonality among people that could have different views yet look the same and have different life accessories. Now a kind of social uniform is required to identify yourself. The outward intellectual has been put on the endangered species list in some places,. “Simon” describes people in the early 1980’s as still being inquisitive and having a sense of humility, two things that seem in short supply now. Although “Simon” is a comedy about smart people, the movie reminded me how people used to be revered for being smart."
