        "text": "Simon is a director working in films and music videos. He likes stories about outsiders and people who live on the fringe. His previous short film “Wash Club” (iShorts) is a dark comedy/thriller based on a true story. The film was a Vimeo Staff Pick, Official Selection at Short of the Week, Galway, LSFF, Aesthetica to name a few. It was picked up by Omletto, YouTube’s largest short film platform and currently has over 400k combined views online. The films star, Tom Blyth has since gone on to secure a leading role in the upcoming Hunger Games movie.\n\nHis next short film “Lord of the Free Range” (BFI Network) is a folk-horror-comedy about family, food and religion. The film stars Richard Glover (Darkest Hour, Sightseers) and has recently been completed and is submitting to festivals. Simon has also spent several years working in music videos with clients including Sony, Warner Music and Ministry of Sound - using narrative music videos as an opportunity to further hone his skillset. This has afforded him the opportunity to work with several upcoming actors including Erin Kellyman (Green Knight, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier), Bethany Antonia (House of Dragon) and Lucy Carless (Humans). He is also credited with an official music video for James Blunt."
