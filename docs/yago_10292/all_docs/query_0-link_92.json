        "text": "Woody Allen has never made a movie in Brazil. His tour de force in the search for locations, audience and especially financing (increasingly rare in the USA) has presented us stories set in Paris, London, Barcelona and Rome. But for now, Mr. Allen's connections with Brazil remain superficial: quotes, soundtracks and… Marshall Brickman.\n\nMarshall Brickman was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1939. His father, at the time, was the manager of an import/export company in the city. The family returned to USA when Marshall was still a toddler, but he probably still carry some memories of an old Rio (who wouldn't?). At 15 years old, during a cultural exchange program in Russia, he won a talent contest at the Bolshoi Theater playing a banjo. After college, following the recent musical inclination, he joined a folk band called The Tarriers; he was also in a group called The New Journeymen (which would become The Mamas And The Papas years later).\n\nThe turnaround in his carreer happened at the tradicional club The Bitter End, in Greenwich Village, during a concert with The Tarriers, when he met a young comedian called Woody Allen. It was the kickoff in a sucessful transition from musician to director and writer.\n\nIn the following years, Brickman worked in serveral TV shows, such as The Tonight Show e Candid Camera, won two Emmys, and wrote along with Allen several scripts for TV specials and stand-up. The first big hit in movies came with Sleeper (1973). In the 70's, they also wrote together Annie Hall (1977), which won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar, and Manhattan (1979), nominated for the same Oscar category. By 1980 the partnership has ended by undisclosed circumstances. They would work together again only in Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993).\n\nWithout Allen, Marshall Brickman wrote and directed movies such Simon (1980), Lovesick (1983) and Manhattan Project (1986). On Broadway, the success came with an adaptation for The Adams Family (2009), and Jersey Boys (2005), winner of four Tonys. About Allen, Brickman said, in an interview for People Magazine in 1983: “There is no Woody Allen. Woody Allen is a tall Jamaican woman who works for me — comes in on Tuesdays and Fridays to do some light dusting. That’s all special effects. George Lucas does that.”."
