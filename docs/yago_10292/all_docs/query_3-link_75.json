        "text": "Career\n\nIn 1995 Pegg appeared on television for the first time, in the short-lived sketch comedy series Six Pairs of Pants, for which he was also a writer. It was his first collaboration with Jessica Hynes, a fellow comedian. The following year he performed in three episodes of the British stand-up and sketch comedy series Saturday Live. In 1996 Pegg and Hynes first collaborated with director Wright on the TV miniseries Asylum, a dark comedy that follows the adventures of patients in a psychiatric hospital where the competency of the staff is suspect. Wright directed the episodes while Pegg and Hynes performed, and all three of them contributed to the writing. Through the rest of the 1990s, Pegg continued to appear on television in various roles, including his portrayal of the accident-prone character Jools in the family sitcom Faith in the Future (1996–98) and his work in the sketch comedy show We Know Where You Live (1997).\n\nHe first rose to prominence as one of the lead characters in the British sitcom Spaced (1999–2001), which he developed with Hynes. Pegg and Hynes costarred in the series, which was directed by Wright and has become a cult classic in Britain in the years since its release. The show focused on the escapades of aspiring artist Tim Bisley (Pegg) and struggling writer Daisy Steiner (Hynes) after they grift their way into renting a “couples only” apartment together as relative strangers. Pegg’s real-life best friend, actor Nick Frost, appeared in the series as Bisley’s best friend, Mike Watt. Frost would go on to perform in many of Pegg’s projects, often in the best friend role. Overlapping with Spaced, Pegg appeared on the sketch comedy show Big Train (1998–2002), for which he also wrote some material.\n\nPegg and Wright collaborated again for the 2004 film Shaun of the Dead, with Wright again directing and Pegg starring and cowriting the script. Frost, who had in part helped inspire the story—a “romantic zombie comedy” (also called a “rom-zom-com”) about friends who attempt to weather a zombie apocalypse from their local pub—again played the best friend character. Pegg, Wright, and Frost adopted a similar formula for the buddy-cop slasher comedy Hot Fuzz and the science-fiction comedy The World’s End, films that are grouped with Shaun of the Dead in the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy, named after a British ice cream treat. Wright later recalled on Twitter (now known as X) that because the dessert had been featured in Shaun of the Dead, the crew had been given free Cornettos at the film’s after-party. Pegg and Wright had decided they should mention Cornettos again in their next film in hopes of receiving free treats. Although this ploy proved unsuccessful, they were able to secure the sweets after filming The World’s End.\n\nIn between the Cornetto films, Pegg and Frost wrote and starred in Paul (2011), a film about friends who encounter an extraterrestrial being during a road trip. Pegg also teamed up with fellow comedian Michael Ian Black to write the romantic comedy Run Fatboy Run (2007), directed by David Schwimmer, which Pegg also starred in.\n\nPegg remained an in-demand actor throughout the early 21st century, appearing as tech whiz Benji Dunn in Mission: Impossible III (2006), Mission: Impossible—Ghost Protocol (2011), Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation (2015), Mission: Impossible—Fallout (2018), and Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One (2023). He also played the role of Montgomery “Scotty” Scott in the rebooted series of Star Trek films, including Star Trek (2009), Star Trek into Darkness (2013), and Star Trek Beyond (2016), for which he also contributed to the script."
