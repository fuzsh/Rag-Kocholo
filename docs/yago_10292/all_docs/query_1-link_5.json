        "text": "Was a member of the folk trio The Tarriers in the late 1950s, with Eric Weissberg and Alan Arkin. He played bluegrass guitar on the 1963 album \"New Dimensions in Banjo and Bluegrass\" with Weissberg; this was later reissued as \"Dueling Banjos\", a pseudo-soundtrack album for Beim Sterben ist jeder der Erste (1972) (the title track was the only piece that was actually used in the film).\n\nSang with John Phillips and Michelle Phillips in The New Journeymen before they split off to become half of The Mamas and the Papas.\n\nThree things that people always tell you about the movie business: \"You can fix it in the editing room; it doesn't matter what the critics say; and there's German money\". You can NEVER fix it in the editing, it DOES matter what the critics say, and there's NO SUCH THING as German money.\n\nOn alternate days Der Stadtneurotiker (1977) would appeal to us. Then we'd get disgusted--who wants to see another love story about New York City? When I saw the rough cut, I thought it terrible, completely unsalvageable. It rambled and was tangential and just . . . endless."
