Reservations may be made with a major credit card online at www.thebradleyplayhouse.org or by calling 860-928-7887.\n\nCOVID 19 PROTOCOLS\n\nContact Venue for Most Updated COVID-19 Safety Protocols and Information.\n\nThe Theatre Of Northeastern Connecticut (TNECT) at the Bradley Playhouse presents an uncontested fine staging of the Andrew Lippa musical, \"THE ADDAMS FAMILY\" featuring a solid cast and a pleasing enough score that proves that, when you're (watching) an ADDAMS musical, you \"need to have a sense of humor.\"\n\nThe creative team and cast prove that, just like the ancestors in the story, when you come back, you come back strong.\n\nAnd that is just what TNECT at the Bradley has done here.\n\nAll the creative team elements are well executed by the cast, crew and \"Ancestor\" ensemble: From stage direction by co-directors Greg Brock and Kathleen Atwood to music direction by Diane Pollard (who also conducts a fabulous live orchestra) and keenly placed choreography by Kat MacInnes (with a smoothly delivered Tango choreographed byKelly Wybieracki).\n\nFrom the moment the orchestra begins playing the iconic theme to the original television show, fingers are snapping or hands clapping, indicating the audience is ready to have a fun time.\n\nSpecial technical elements (consisting of a multitude of lighting, fog, strobe and sound effects) are all done with precision and every scene change is seamless.\n\nEverything seems to have been done with great care making this, all in all, a simply marvelous production.\n\nThe show is based upon \"THE ADDAMS FAMILY\" macabre cartoon characters created by Charles Addams.\n\n\"THE ADDAMS FAMILY\" has a fun score featuring music and lyrics by Lippa with a book by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice. To lift from the show, this is a musical that can be enjoyed by \"the living, the dead and the undecided.\"\n\nLippa would ultimately be nominated for a Tony Award for Best Score.\n\nHowever, if one examines the Brickman/Elice book closely, it bears a strong resemblance to George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's \"You Can't Take It With You.\" More on that later.\n\nAlthough there have been several television and film adaptations of the \"altogether ookie\" ADDAMS, with the most recent being the Netflix series \"Wednesday,\" the musical homage was the first stage show to be based on the characters.\n\n\"THE ADDAMS FAMILY\" musical opened on Broadway in 2010 with a superb cast that included Nathan Lane as “Gomez” and Bebe Neuwirth as “Morticia.”\n\nThe production ran until the end of 2011 and was nominated for two Tony Awards: one for Andrew Lippa’s score and one for the supporting performance of Kevin Chamberlin as “Uncle Fester.”\n\nThe original Broadway set design for \"ADDAMS FAMILY\" won a Drama Desk Award and an Outer Critics Circle Award. Lane would also be honored with the 2010 Drama League Award for Distinguished Achievement in Musical Theatre Award.\n\n(Photo: Bryn Elizabeth Martin as \"Wednesday\" and James Giacchi as \"Pugsley\" in a scene from the musical, \"THE ADDAMS FAMILY\" now playing at the Bradley Playhouse in Putnam, CT. through October 22, 2023. Photo Credit Lindsay Lehmann)\n\nIn George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's \"You Can't Take It With You\" the story revolves around two lovers whose families meet and they couldn't be more different.\n\nSuch is the plot of \"THE ADDAMS FAMILY\"...only, in this case, the story begins in front of a mausoleum with one of the most delightful and fun opening numbers ever - \"When You're an ADDAMS\" - as performed by the entire \"ADDAMS FAMILY\" and their ancestors.\n\nWednesday ADDAMS (Bryn Elizabeth Martin), now an adult, meets and falls for Lucas (Galen Donavan) and tells her father, Gomez (Adam Leidemer) that they plan to marry.\n\nWednesday begs Gomez not to tell his wife and her mother, Morticia (Christine Healy), about the impending nuptials just yet.\n\nAs part of some bizarre plan, she coerces her parents into inviting over to dinner the parents of secret fiancé Lucas, Mal (Jim Archambault) and Alice Beineke (Chelsea Daniels), a more conservative couple...of course, when it comes to \"THE ADDAMS FAMILY\", almost every family could be considered \"more conservative.\"\n\nMorticia and Gomez reluctantly agree to Wednesday's wishes but the secret Gomez keeps from his wife is unbearable as he coveys in the consecutive songs, \"Two Things/Wednesday's Growing Up/Three Things.\"\n\n(Photo: Bryn Elizabeth Martin as \"Wednesday\" and Adam Leidemer as \"Gomez\" in a scene from the musical, \"THE ADDAMS FAMILY\" now playing at the Bradley Playhouse in Putnam, CT. through October 22, 2023. Photo Credit Lindsay Lehmann)\n\nAdam Leidemer is exceptional as Gomez, as is Healy as Morticia and the two have undeniable on stage chemistry, as evidenced in a number of their duets including \"Trapped,\" \"Live Before We Die\" and the aforementioned Tango number, \"Tango De Amor.\"\n\nLeidemer also sings a tender rendition the Act Two number \"Happy Sad\" when discussing all things life and love with his neat, sweet and petite daughter.\n\nArchambault and Daniels are truly funny as Mal and Alice whose drab humdrum lives will forever be impacted by the evening's encounter with the creepy, kooky, mysterious and spooky ADDAMSES.\n\nTwo of the strongest performances comes from Bryn Elizabeth Martin as Wednesday and Galen Donavan as Lucas.\n\nThe contrastive couple seem to have a genuinely affectionate rapport and immediately prompt us to root for them to succeed in their romance, as demonstrated in their duet \"Crazier Than You.\"\n\n(Photo: TheCAST of the musical, \"THE ADDAMS FAMILY\": Bryn Elizabeth Martin as \"Wednesday,\" Christine Healy as \"Morticia,\" James Giacchi as \"Pugsley,\" Adam Leidemer as \"Gomez,\" Wladimir Petruniw as \"Lurch,\" Shaun McCoy as \"Uncle Fester,\" and Bonnie Theriault as \"Grandma\" - now playing at the Bradley Playhouse in Putnam, CT. through October 22, 2023. Photo Credit Lindsay Lehmann)\n\nOur guide throughout the evening is Uncle Fester, as played whimsically on point by Shaun McCoy, providing not only comedic high points but also a musical high point with the song, \"The Moon and Me.\"\n\nWith regards to the overall production's skillful choreography, one minor curiosity concerns the number, \"The Moon and Me.\"\n\nFor some reason (which becomes somewhat clearer near the end of the show), instead of using a projection of the Moon in the sky (or a suspended faux \"Moon\"), one of the \"Ancestors\" waves around a globe representing the Moon.\n\nThis choice unintentionally obstructs some of the otherwise terrific onstage choreography by the Ancestors and distracts from McCoy's equally fine singing.\n\nRounding out the \"screamingly\" good cast are James Giacchi as Wednesday's younger brother, \"Pugsley,\" Bonnie Theriault as \"Grandma\" and Wladimir Petruniw as the ADDAMS' butler \"Lurch.\"\n\nThe 19-member ensemble serving as the \"Ancestors\" (20 if you include a \"Grim Reaper\") could easily have been made about as interesting as the mausoleum but, thanks to the show's fine direction, they are seen as integral to the story and never falter. Not once.\n\nIt must also be pointed out how every single costume for the cast and the Ancestors was obviously produced with great care and made distinctive to each character. Such a task must have been a massive \"undertaking\" (pun intended).\n\nThe Ancestors do, however, appear to be crowded on the stage at times (nudged right up the proscenium curtain line) and, curiously, sometimes they can be seen by the cast and other times they cannot. Chalk those up to more \"altogether ookie\" moments.\n\nSo, for Bradley Playhouse's \"THE ADDAMS FAMILY\" (which plays in Putnam until October 22nd), as the song instructs, \"put a witch's shawl on, a broomstick you can crawl on\" and go and \"pay a call on\" this wonderful family.\n\nApproximately two hours, 40 minutes with one intermission.\n\nKevin T. Baldwin is a member of the American Theatre Critics Association (ATCA)\n\n@MetrmagReviews\n\n@Theatre_Critics\n\nABOUT THE SHOW\n\nIn the kooky, upside-down world of \"THE ADDAMS FAMILY\" to be sad is to be happy, to feel pain is to feel joy, and death and suffering are the stuff of their dreams.\n\nNonetheless, this quirky family still has to deal with many of the same challenges faced by any other family, and the spookiest nightmare faced by every family creates the focus Lippa, Brickman, and Elice’s musical: the \"THE ADDAMS FAMILY\" kids are growing up.\n\n\"THE ADDAMS FAMILY\" have lived by their unique values for hundreds of years and Gomez and Morticia, the patriarch and matriarch of the clan, would be only too happy to continue living that way.\n\nTheir dark, macabre, beloved daughter Wednesday, however, is now an eighteen year-old young woman who is ready for a life of her own.\n\nShe has fallen in love with Lucas Beineke, a sweet, smart boy from a normal, respectable Ohio family — the most un-ADDAMS sounding person one could be!\n\nAnd to make matters worse, she has invited the Beinekes to their home for dinner.\n\nIn one fateful, hilarious night, secrets are disclosed, relationships are tested, and \"THE ADDAMS FAMILY\" must face up to the one horrible thing they’ve managed to avoid for generations: change.\n\nABOUT THE BRADLEY PLAYHOUSE\n\nTHE BRADLEY PLAYHOUSE is a 117 year-old vaudeville theatre in the heart of the Putnam antiques and restaurant district in the “Quiet Corner” of Northeastern Connecticut.
