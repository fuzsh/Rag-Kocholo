        "text": "Simon Berry is an award-winning, director who LOVES what he does. He’s been at it 10 years now and has no sign of slowing down.\n\nHis first short narrative film 'Mine' picked up a Vimeo Staff Pick and won the Audience Choice Award for Best Short Narrative at the San Diego International Film Festival. He quickly followed this up with his film for QPR, \"The Crest\", which won \"Best Director\" at the EVCOM Screen Awards and \"Best Editing\" at Cannes.\n\n2018 to 2024 have been prolific years for Simon during which he shot six films for AMEX featuring Nile Rodgers and Gizzi Erskine as well as a launch film for the Jaguar I-Pace featuring Dua Lipa. Soon after he followed up with two new Persil films for Mullen Lowe.\n\nMost recently he has released films for a Wimbledon x Amex collaboration and loved every second shooting (and eating) tabletop food shoots for Moët & Chandon.\n\nThroughout 2024 he has been busy at work directing ads for Clorox, Union Rentals, AHA and the BBC as well as a brand new music video release.\n\nNARRATIVE WORK"
