        "text": "In this feature our writers defend films they feel have not received their due.\n\nWe’ve all seen it: Someone who knows so little about a subject that they aren’t even aware of their own ignorance. It’s funny and frustrating and philosophers have written about it for centuries. It’s now called the Dunning-Kruger Effect, so named for the authors of the landmark paper “Unskilled and Unaware of It.” Though the paper was published nearly two decades after the film’s release, one would be hard pressed to find a better illustration of this particularly hilarious cognitive bias than in Marshall Brickman’s chaotic social satire Simon (1980).\n\nPsychology professor Simon Mendelssohn (Alan Arkin) teaches unconvinced students that it’s possible to turn the entire planet into a spaceship that will travel the universe. To Mendelssohn, the bumper sticker psychobabble “Dare to dream!” is synonymous with “Any wacky theory is possible; damn the physics and logic!” Which is why Mendelssohn is the perfect man to be brainwashed into believing he’s the son of a toaster from an unknown galaxy in the Orion nebula.\n\nThat’s exactly what a team of scientists at the super-secret government-funded Institute for Advanced Concepts plan to do. They do not deal in beakers of colored liquids and spinning neon whats-its, but destructive social mayhem, and like every good mad scientist they are convinced that only they understand the true nature of the world. After a series of successful experiments, everything from a prankish skewing of Nielsen ratings to the horrifying creation of a penicillin-resistant gonorrhea, they develop their ultimate project: To make a human believe he is an alien, then watch how the world reacts.\n\nSimon earned universally mediocre reviews upon release and was often dismissed, with even the most favorable reviews calling it uneven and dated. Yet between the gas-crisis jokes and a couple of really unfortunate special effects, Simon manages to be surprisingly prescient. Questions posed by the film regarding scientific and military ethics still resonate today. NASA’s Institute for Advanced Concepts became a real thing, mostly, in 1998. Simon shows the Space Shuttle achieving manned space flight a year before it became a reality; it also beat Paddy Chayefsky and Ken Russell to the punch by satirizing a psychology professor’s obsession with isolation tanks before Altered States (1980) had a chance to play it straight.\n\nA difficult film to categorize, Simon’s scattershot publicity tried to appeal to everyone including intellectuals, Woody Allen fans and sci-fi connoisseurs. Most often mentioned in an attempt to get butts into theater seats was Arkin’s frenzied showcase scene as a man who re-evolves over the course of a couple of minutes. Arkin nails the absurdist physical comedy of a man who, kept nearly 200 hours in an isolation chamber, has “de-evolved” and has to go through all the “steps” of evolution, starting as a wee amoeba — represented by wiggling his forefinger — and ultimately reaching modern man. It is not only funny but wrong on almost every scientific level, and is the moment that Simon abandons satire and dives straight into farce.\n\nSimon is a somewhat episodic film, beginning as a documentary of an evil but scientifically sound think tank, switching to a straightforward comedy, and then, just at the moment Mendelssohn realizes that being an amoeba was preferable to being modern man, the film goes completely off the rails. Everything skews and breaks and reality ceases to exist for the audience at the same time it does for Mendelssohn, whose mind was broken — or perhaps broadened — by his time in an isolation tank.\n\nArkin’s comedy is almost completely internal, with his immersion in the character keeping the first half of the film believable and the second half tethered to reality, if only just barely. His performance is exactly the right fit for a film that doesn’t always work when it goes for outright laughs. The real revelation in Simon is Judy Graubart as Lisa, Mendelssohn’s wife. Known mostly for her work on “The Electric Company,” Graubart is the embodiment of sanity and reason, the one person who both the characters and the audience can trust. Her timing of comedic exasperation and frustration is impeccable, without any of the usual corny overemphasis that can make a worried wife sound like a character in a soap-opera comic strip. Brickman stated in interviews that he would have included more scenes with Graubart if he had the chance, and it’s easy to see why.\n\nWhen Mendelssohn is convinced he is an alien, he attempts to force all of Earth to abide by his demands, a list of rules about everything from term limits to condiments. The media is enchanted but the military is not, and Mendelssohn finds himself on the lam, hooked up with a small television-worshipping cult. They appoint him their leader, giving him vestments with pictures of celebrities such as Eric Estrada, and help him broadcast nationwide so he can continue his attempt to better the world.\n\nIf there is a moral to be learned in Simon, it’s in the condemnation of the privileged group, be it the military or academia or politicians. Yet while the film seems to say that the average person is the social ideal — an individual who can see through the bullshit of elitists and achieve stability in a chaotic world — it should be noted that so-called normalcy is not celebrated. A scientist’s intelligence, the one thing that sets him apart from everyone else, is taken away as comedic karmic justice. Though Mendelssohn’s rants against Muzak and ketchup packets are his futile attempt to control a disordered universe, the film presents these everyday achievements as silly and worthless. Everyday people are rarely seen in the film, and when they are, they’re in a silent and obedient group either producing television or watching it. It’s a curious film that looks down on people while condemning those who look down on people, though in doing so, it more sharply exposes the damage we do to each other in our self-centered quests for a perfect-to-us world."
