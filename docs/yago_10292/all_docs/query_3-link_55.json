        "text": "The versatile filmmaker Claire Simon is primarily known for her documentaries, on which she is frequently responsible for the script, camera, editing and direction. Her choice of stories is also wide-ranging. However, they do have one common dominator in the magic of everyday things and banalities. Simon originally studied ethnology, Arabic and Berber and taught herself filmmaking. She presented her first feature film at the parallel selection the Directors’ Fortnight at Cannes. She worked as a teacher at France’s La Femis, an experience that informed her documentary The Graduation. FebioFest"
