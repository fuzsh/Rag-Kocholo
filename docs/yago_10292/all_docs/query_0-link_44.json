Marshall Brickman directed the science-fiction comedy.\n\nThe poster measures 39” x 55” and is in very good condition with minor wear from storage and handling. This poster was folded at the time of printing. Most folds flatten out nicely for framing and are often desirable for vintage, collectible movie posters.\n\nPlease look closely at the photo (this is the exact poster you are buying). This collectible poster, printed in 1980 to promote the Italian release of Simon, is not a reproduction or a reprint."
