        "text": "Independent production company B-Reel Films adds Stockholm-based director and photographer Simon Jung to its commercial roster for US and Scandinavian representation.\n\nWith a background in both graffiti and fine arts, and as an interactive art director, Simon’s work deftly takes audiences through unexpected turns and visually appealing narratives, thanks to his VFX savviness and uncompromising vision.\n\nSimon's portfolio demonstrates a seamless fusion of vibrant hues, intricate textures, and the signature simplicity synonymous with Scandinavian minimalism. His distinctive style captures the essence of dynamic urban landscapes and the inherent human connections within, weaving narratives that resonate.\n\nShowcasing impressive adaptability, Simon’s commercial work ranges between a black and white narrative driven film for Adidas, with touches of surrealism, and an editorial style sun-soaked collage for H&M, starring model and socialite Hailey Bieber.\n\nAnna Sundbom, marketing director and executive producer at B-Reel Films, comments on the exciting signing; “Simon loves working with simple ideas calling for interesting expressions and surprising elements. I think his background as an advertising creative and love for team work plays a big role in the making of his exceptional films. It feels fantastic to have him onboard!”\n\nSimon Jung, director at B-Reel, adds: “So it’s finally official! I’ve teamed up with B-Reel Films, tapping into their galaxy of experience and knack for storytelling. Why? Because I've got this lifelong itch to learn and what better way to scratch it than rubbing shoulders with the pros? Picture this: their expertise meets my quirkiness, and bam! We're cooking up films that'll make popcorn jealous.”"
