        "text": "By turns wicked, funny, warm, romantic and touching, Meredith Willson’s THE MUSIC MAN is classic Broadway entertainment at its best. Composer/lyricist/writer Meredith Willson’s six-time, Tony Award®-winning musical has been delighting audiences since 1957 with its tale of a traveling con-man, the small town citizens he’s attempting to swindle, and the piano teacher with whom he unexpectedly falls in love. This quintessential American musical features such memorable songs as “Till There Was You,” “Ya Got Trouble,” “Goodnight, My Someone,” “The Wells Fargo Wagon,” “Shipoopi,” and “Seventy-Six Trombones.”\n\nThis production is suitable for all audiences.\n\nThe record-breaking 2013 film is now an explosive and thrilling musical, from the EGOT–winning creative team of Kristen Anderson-Lopez & Robert Lopez. Featuring a dozen new songs, this sister-centric tale of true love and acceptance is certain to thaw the coldest of hearts with non-stop laughter, adventure, and theatrical magic. Featuring the songs “Let It Go,” “Do You Want To Build a Snowman,” “For The First Time In Forever,” and “In Summer.”\n\nThis production is suitable for all ages.\n\nDue to licensing, single tickets for Frozen will not go on sale to the general public until Wednesday, October 23rd. Season subscribers will get early access to single tickets on Monday, October 21st.\n\nAt the dawn of a new century, everything is changing… and anything is possible. Set in the volatile melting pot of turn-of-the-century New York, three distinctly American tales are woven together – that of a stifled upper-class wife, a determined Jewish immigrant, and a daring young Harlem musician – united by their courage, compassion and belief in the promise of the future. Winner of Tony Awards® for its music and its book, RAGTIME is filled with pageantry, emotion and hope, bursting onto the stage like no other musical before or since.\n\nThis production contains adult themes and adult language.\n\nBefore she was music superstar Carole King — she was Carole Klein, a spunky, young songwriter from Brooklyn who wrote hit songs for the biggest acts in music. BEAUTIFUL chronicles her rise as a songwriter, eventually finding her own unique voice with her ground-breaking 1971 album Tapestry. With unforgettable classic songs as “(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,” “You’ve Got a Friend,” “One Fine Day,” “You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feeling,” and “Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,” this Broadway, feel-good phenomenon is a story you’ll never forget.\n\nThis production contains some adult themes."
