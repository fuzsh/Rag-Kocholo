        "text": "Simon Jaquemet was born in 1978. He grew up on a farm near Basel in Switzerland. After high school he tried to be a professional snowboarder, but after eating enough snow he discovered filmmaking and studied film directing at the Zürich University of the Arts. He wrote and directed several short films. Among them Die Burg (The Fortress), Block and Laura’s Party, which were selected in various international festivals. He also specialised in directing music videos, which have won several awards. He worked as a cinematographer for video artists like Elodie Pong, Knowbotic Research and David Lamelas. Simon worked with teenagers and non-professional actors in most of his short films and has a strong link to youth subculture through his work as a music video director. His first feature script War has participated in TorinoFilmLab’s Script&Pitch and Jeanne Moreau’s Ateliers Premiers Plans. It is supported by the Swiss Federal Office of Culture, The Zürich Film Foundation and MEDIA."
