        "text": "Simon Pegg is an acclaimed actor, screenwriter, producer, and director.\n\nSimon rose to prominence as co-creator of the cult television show 'Spaced'. After two ground-breaking seasons, he moved on to develop and co-write, with Edgar Wright, the critically praised feature 'Shaun of the Dead', starring as the eponymous hero, Shaun. The film has since been voted one of the Best British Comedies ever made by many, including Empire Magazine and Channel 4.\n\nAfter conquering zombies, award ceremonies and the rest of the world, Pegg and Wright reprised their debut movie success with the smash-hit follow-up features, ‘Hot Fuzz’ and the third and final film in the ‘Three Flavours Cornetto Trilogy’, ‘The Worlds End’.\n\nIn addition to his roles in Star Wars, Star Trek, and the Mission Impossible franchise, Simon’s recent roles include the much talked about cameo in Amazon Studio’s adaptation of popular comic-book series The Boys and the voice of The Chamberlain in Netflix’s ‘The Dark Crystal: Age Of Resistance’. Simon also starred alongside Juno Temple in Katharine O’Brien’s intimate look at the devastating impact of mental illness in ‘Lost Transmissions’. He has just wrapped the next instalment of Mission Impossible and completed shooting The Undeclared War for Channel 4 alongside Mark Rylance.\n\nIn 2016, alongside Nick Frost, Simon founded the production company ‘Stolen Picture’, with their first major release being the Amazon Prime ghost-hunting series ‘Truth Seekers’."
