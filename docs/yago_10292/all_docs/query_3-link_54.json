        "text": "Award-winning Colombian director-producer Simon Brand and Miami-based media executive producer Daniel Eilemberg have joined forces with the founders of Emmy-winning Imaginer Films, Julio César and Laura Franco, to launch Clover Studios, a new production services company in Colombia.\n\nThe new enterprise is in response to Colombia’s phenomenal growth as a major production center, driven by its competitive production incentives and flourishing creative community.\n\nLed by Netflix’s ambitious series adaptation of Nobel Laureate Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s literary masterpiece “100 Years of Solitude,” which has entailed a full-scale recreation of the mythical village of Macondo and 20,000 extras, a number of high-profile projects have been lured to the country.\n\nJust last year, upcoming sequel “Paddington in Peru” was mostly shot in Colombia instead of the country in its title. This month Netflix announced its first multi-year creative partnership with Colombian talent, the writer-director team Camilo Prince and Pablo González, whose thriller “The Hijacking of Flight 601,” produced by Miracol Media, dropped on April 10.\n\n“We are thrilled to embark on this exciting journey with Julio and Laura,” said Brand and Eilemberg, adding: “With Clover, we aim to harness the creativity and passion of Colombia’s vibrant film community and contribute to making Colombia the most important production hub in South America.”\n\nImaginer Films, based in Medellin, has solidified its position as a key provider of production services within the film and television sectors, playing a pivotal role in the expansion of Colombia’s film industry over the past few decades.\n\nIt is one of several production companies that have sprouted up since Colombia saw an uptick in location shoots. Aside from providing services in the production of music videos, commercials, films and television, it will be developing original IP, including the fourth feature film by Brand.\n\nColombia offers two audiovisual incentives: a Cash Rebate and a Transferable Tax Credit. Additionally, services rendered in the country but exclusively used abroad are exempt from a Value Added Tax.\n\nAs per Film Law 1556, foreign production companies investing more than $600,000 in Colombia for feature films and TV movies are eligible for a 40% cash rebate on qualified film spending within the country. Additionally, they can receive a 20% cash rebate on logistical expenses like hotels, catering, and transportation.\n\n“The twin strikes in Hollywood impacted location shoots here last year but we expect it to start picking up again,” said Colombian film commissioner Silvia Echeverri.\n\nBrand has helmed 200+ commercials for major brands like Coca-Cola, Nabisco, and BMW, alongside numerous music videos for artists including Ricky Martin, Shakira, and Maluma. He followed his debut feature, “Unknown,” starring Jim Caviezel, Greg Kinnear and Joe Pantoliano, with the box office hit “Paraíso Travel.” His third film, “Default,” stars David Oyelowo.\n\nRecently, Brand served as showrunner and director for Netflix’s “Ritmo Salvaje,” produced Goyo’s HBO special, directed Thalia’s Mixtape series for Paramount +, and helmed “Law and Order: Organized Crime.” He’s been named by Variety as one of Hollywood’s most influential Latinos.\n\nEilemberg co-founded and led media brand Lil’ Heroes alongside Spanish contemporary artist Edgar Plans. Prior to that, he was a founding partner and president of content at Exile Content, which was later acquired by Candle Media in 2022. As President of Fusion Media Group, he earned over 75 awards, including prestigious journalism honors. Eilemberg also founded Animal Político and Pájaro Político, acclaimed news brands. His executive producer credits include Sundance winner “Science Fair” and Netflix’s “Who Killed Malcolm X.” A 2014 Nieman Fellow at Harvard, he received NAMIC’s 2017 Next Generation Leaders and Luminaries Award."
