        "text": "Marshall Brickman (born August 25, 1941 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) is a screenwriter, best known for his collaborations with Woody Allen. He is also known for playing the banjo with Eric Weissberg in the 1960s, and for a series of comical parodies published in The New Yorker.\n\nContents\n\n1 Biography\n\n2 Screenplays\n\n3 References\n\n4 External links\n\nBiography\n\nAfter attending the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, he became a member of Folk act The Tarriers in 1962, recruited by former classmate Eric Weissberg. Upon the disbanding of The Tarriers in 1965, Brickman joined The New Journeymen with John Phillips and Michelle Phillips, who later had success with The Mamas & the Papas. He left The New Journeymen to pursue a career as a writer, initially writing for television in the 1960s, including Candid Camera, The Tonight Show, and The Dick Cavett Show. It was during this time that he met Allen, with whom he would collaborate on several 1970s film scripts, including Sleeper, Annie Hall (which won the Best Original Screenplay Academy Award), and Manhattan.\n\nBrickman directed several of his own scripts in the 1980s, including Simon, Lovesick, and The Manhattan Project, as well as Sister Mary Explains It All, a TV adaptation of the play by Christopher Durang. He reunited with Allen in 1993 to write Manhattan Murder Mystery.\n\nWith partner Rick Elice, he wrote the book for the Broadway musical Jersey Boys. The two collaborated again in 2009 to write the book for the musical The Addams Family.[1]\n\nBrickman's \"Who's Who in the Cast,\" a parody of a Playbill cast list, was published in the July 26, 1976, issue of The New Yorker, and drew so much attention that it was republished in the special theatre issue of May 31, 1993. Other notable pieces for The New Yorker include \"The New York Review of Gossip\" (May 19, 1975) and \"The Recipes of Chairman Mao\" (August 27, 1973).\n\nScreenplays\n\nAnn in Blue (1974) (TV)\n\nThe Muppet Show (TV)\n\nSimon (1980)\n\nLovesick (1983)\n\nManhattan Project (1986)\n\nFor the Boys (1991) (with Neil Jimenez and Lindy Laub)\n\nIntersection (1994)\n\nAnna Veritiny (2002)\n\nCo-written with Woody Allen\n\nSleeper (1973)\n\nAnnie Hall (1977)\n\nManhattan (1979)\n\nManhattan Murder Mystery (1993)\n\nReferences\n\nMarshall Brickman at the Internet Movie Database\n\nMarshall Brickman at the Internet Broadway Database\n\nMarshall Brickman at AllRovi"
