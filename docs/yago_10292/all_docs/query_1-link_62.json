        "text": "TUCSON, AZ – From a cartoon strip first created by Charles Addams in the 1938 issue of The New Yorker, to a TV series that lasted two seasons in the mid ‘60s, a modern musical is born: The Addams Family – A New Musical, about the macabre, but kooky and funny family. And Arizona Repertory Theatre at the University of Arizona is producing this musical, directed by Danny Gurwin, who made his Arizona Repertory Theatre directing debut with the musical, Nine, and has since directed other hits here such as The Fantasticks, Oklahoma, and the 2015 MAC Award-winning, Cabaret, also winning Best Director for that same musical.\n\n“I know audiences both young and old will enjoy this hilarious and heartwarming story with all of their favorite, altogether ooky Addams Family characters,” Gurwin said.\n\nIt’s no accident that this musical opens mid-October and helps usher in the Halloween season, either. Gurwin said he thinks they’ve created a fun, family Halloween spectacle.\n\n“And with our very own (Professor of Practice) Monte Ralstin as ‘Uncle Fester’ taking the stage for the first time in 15 years,” Gurwin added, “it should prove to be an unforgettable run here at the UA!”\n\nHis is not a singular sentiment, as many alumni were inspired to chatter on social media about their mentor in Musical Theatre, Monte Ralstin, taking the stage and mentioned with excitement how they would have to return to Tucson to see him.\n\nAudience members can expect to laugh a lot at this Addams Family production, and enjoy a grown-up Wednesday Addams, who is engaged to wed a “normal” young man, but wishes her father to keep that secret from her mother. What could go wrong? With a melodious score and ghoulish special effects, this musical is sure to please.
