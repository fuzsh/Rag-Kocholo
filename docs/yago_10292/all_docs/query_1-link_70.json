        "text": "“Annie Hall” has been named the funniest screenplay in voting by the members of the Writers Guild of America.\n\nThe script by Woody Allen and Marshall Brickman topped “Some Like it Hot,” “Groundhog Day,” “Airplane!” and “Tootsie,” which make up the rest of the top five. “Young Frankenstein,” “Dr. Strangelove,” “Blazing Saddles,” “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” and “National Lampoon’s Animal House” rounded out the top 10.\n\nThe awards for the 101 funniest screenplays were announced Wednesday at the Arclight Cinerama Dome in Hollywood at the conclusion of two hours of panel discussions and clips, hosted by Rob Reiner. He noted that his “This Is Spinal Tap” script had finished at the No. 11 spot — a coincidence that recalled the “go to 11” amplifier joke in the film.\n\nThe “Annie Hall” screenplay won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay in 1977. Allen had six other scripts on the list — “Sleeper,” “Bananas,” “Take the Money and Run,” “Broadway Danny Rose,” Love and Death” and “Manhattan.”\n\nThe late Harold Ramis had two scripts in the top 10 with “Groundhog Day” and “Animal House,” along with “Ghostbusters” at No. 14 and “Caddyshack” at No. 25. Preston Sturgess had four scripts on the list with “The Lady Eve,” “Sullivan’s Travels,” “The Palm Beach Story” and “The Miracle of Morgan Creek.”\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nMel Brooks had three scripts in the top dozen — “Young Frankenstein,” “Blazing Saddles” and “The Producers.”\n\nThe list included Charlie Chaplin’s 1925 silent “The Gold Rush,” which came in at No. 94 and was the oldest title on the list. One other silent, 1926’s “The General,” was on the list at No. 56 for the script written by Buster Keaton and Clyde Bruckman and adapted by Al Boasberg and Charles Smith.\n\nThe most recent title was 2011’s “Bridesmaids” by Annie Mumolo & Kristen Wiig, which was voted No. 16. The second most recent film script was 2009’s “The Hangover” by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, which finished No. 30; the third most recent was 2007’s “Superbad” by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, which came in 68th.\n\n“Airplane!” writers Jim Abrahams and David and Jerry Zucker received plenty of affection during the panel discussions. “‘Airplane’ is a towering masterpiece, as important to comedy as ‘Psycho’ is to thrillers” said Alexander Payne, whose scripts for “Sideways” and “Election” made the list.\n\nCarl Gottlieb, Robert Townsend, Michael Elias and Buck Henry (seated) at the WGA West’s tribute event for the 101 Funniest Screenplays\n\nChelsea Lauren/Variety/Rex Shutterstock\n\nBuck Henry, whose scripts for “The Graduate” and “What’s Up Doc?” were on the list, received the evening’s only standing ovation. “Buck Henry and ‘The Graduate’ is why I became a writer,” said Randi Mayem Singer, whose “Mrs. Doubtfire” was 99th on the list.\n\nDon Roos received one of the biggest laughs of the night when Reiner asked him about his screenplay: “What is ‘The Opposite of Sex’?” “I’m living it,” Roos responded.\n\nRoos then correctly predicted that “Annie Hall” would top the list.\n\nThe WGA East announced the winners in New York at the New School Auditorium in Greenwich Village.\n\nThe complete list follows:\n\n1. “Annie Hall”\n\nWritten by Woody Allen and Marshall Brickman\n\n1977, UA\n\n2. “Some Like It Hot”\n\nScreenplay by Billy Wilder & I.A.
