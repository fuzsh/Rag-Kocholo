        "text": "Book by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice\n\nMusic and Lyrics by Andrew Lippa\n\nBased on Characters created by Charles Addams\n\nDirected by Lani Brockman\n\nThe Addams Family is a smash-­hit musical comedy that brings the darkly delirious world of Gomez, Morticia, Uncle Fester, Grandma, Wednesday, Pugsley and, of course, Lurch to spooky and spectacular life. Rather than a restaging of the classic and beloved television series, this production stays true to the characters of the original while launching an updated storyline: Wednesday Addams, darkly morbid daughter of the clan, is now all grown up, in love, and secretly engaged to a decidedly “normal” young man. What could possibly go wrong? When the two families gather for dinner a clash of cultures, personalities, and family expectations erupts, with both humorous and poignant results for all.\n\nWhen asked how this show differs from the popular television series, director Lani Brockman, founder and Artistic Director of Studio East in Kirkland, replied, “It’s a musical, for one, which gives the audience the opportunity to hear through song what is going on in the minds of these wonderfully-weird family members. The characters are iconic and I have kept them true to their original movie and TV series selves, but hopefully, you are seeing a little more humanity in them as well as hilarity. With any show there is a story yet to be told. That’s super important to me. I hope the audience walks away grinning from ear to ear. On a deeper level, I’d like the audience to realize that no matter how ‘weird’ or ‘normal’ we are, we all experience the same needs, wants, and hopes: we all need love, we all want acceptance, and we all hope for our own personal version of happiness. Experiencing the Addams family’s troubles for a couple of hours hopefully gives us the ability to look at our own lives from a different angle, and perhaps gain some perspective.”\n\nThis magnificently macabre new musical comedy is created by Jersey Boys authors Marshall Brickman & Rick Elice, and Drama Desk­-winning composer/lyricist Andrew Lippa (The Wild Party) who writes:\n\n\"The unknown may be frightening, the darkness overwhelming but if we don’t run from it, we may see our mysterious, miraculous lives finally illuminated. If we move towards the darkness, we might find love and acceptance…for when it is dark enough, we can see the stars.\"\n\nCome meet the family for an offbeat, wildly fun holiday treat. We’ll leave the lights off for you!\n\nCast:\n\nMorticia: Jennifer Bondelid\n\nGomez: Jim Castaneda\n\nMal: Bob Atkinson\n\nAlice: Katie Woodzick\n\nGrandma: Melanie Bacon\n\nLurch: Kevin Lynch\n\nLucas: Marshall Link\n\nFester: Kent Junge\n\nPuglsey: Austin Morehouse\n\nWednesday: Erica Major\n\nAncestors/Ensemble:\n\nBrian Burroughs\n\nTess Caldwell\n\nJim Carroll\n\nJohn Han\n\nAshley Klimper\n\nKathy Link\n\nKathryn Lynn Morgen\n\nMegan Parker\n\nMorgan Pullom\n\nSusan Sandri\n\nDecember 4th - 19th, 2015\n\nFriday & Saturday @ 7:30 / Sunday @ 2:00\n\nUncle Fester's Ooky Saloon Opens one hour before each performance\n\nOpening Night Art Gallery Reception at 6:00 PM\n\nAdult $24 / Senior $20 / Youth $17 / Military $20 / Matinee $17\n\nPURCHASING TICKETS\n\nClick Here for Online Purchases\n\nVia Phone: Please Call the Box Office at\n\n800.638.7631 or 360.221.8268\n\nIn Person: Visit the Box Office at\n\n565 Camano Ave, Langley, WA 98260\n\n**Online Tickets Purchases are available until 12-Noon the day of the show.**\n\nBOX OFFICE HOURS:\n\nWednesday through Saturday\n\n1pm - 6pm\n\nand 2 hours before every show"
