        "text": "Beautifully observed, character driven comedy.\n\nSimon got his break in advertising with a charity film for Cancer Research UK, which garnered him the Best New Director award at the British Arrows and a Bronze Lion at Cannes. Since then he’s built up an extensive portfolio of commercials for some of the world’s leading brands, including British Airways, Land Rover, McDonald’s and Sony.\n\nHe also directed Channel 4’s Chewing Gum, starring Michaela Coel. The Evening Standard called it ‘Magnificently filthy wit’ and it was proclaimed by The Guardian to be ‘The future of comedy’, no less. It was nominated for Best Scripted Comedy at the BAFTAs.\n\nFurther Channel 4 credits include Doughnuts, a half-hour single comedy starring Adeel Akhtar and Anjli Mohindra, the acclaimed comedy drama series Youngers, described by the Observer as ‘Tender, topical, truthful. A gem.’, and Rue Boy, a spoken word film co-written with Calvin Demba and broadcast in 5 parts.\n\nHis short film Washdays won Best Film at Rushes Soho Shorts, Special Jury prize at Austin International Film Festival and was nominated for a British Independent Film Award."
