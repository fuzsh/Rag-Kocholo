        "text": "OUR PRODUCTS\n\nWe sell both antique maps and fine art reproductions of the maps in our collection. Select \"Authentic Antique Map\" from the online purchase options to purchase the real deal, an antique map produced years ago. See below for details, including pricing and lead times, about our maps, fine art reproductions, and frames.\n\nGift Products\n\nWood \"Entering\" Signs are each fabricated and painted to order. Please allow up to 2-3 weeks for production.\n\nIn-stock, non-custom gift products (books, greeting cards, etc.) typically ship within a few business days.\n\nFine art prints and other printed-to-order map art typically ships withing a few business days.\n\nAntique Maps\n\nAvailability: Antique maps are available when we have them. The website will indicate \"sold out\" if the antique map is no longer available. Fine art reproductions of every map in our collection are always available.\n\nLead time: Unframed antique maps are typically ready for shipment or pickup within a few days of order placement. Some antique maps listed on our website must be brought in from other dealers. In those cases, additional days are required to get those maps to us before shipping or pickup can take place. If ordering a framed antique map, see lead times for frames below.\n\nWhat are Authentic Antique Maps? Authentic Antique Maps are the real deal, the original artifact. They are authentic maps produced as dated on our website. They are limited in number.\n\nHow do we determine prices for Authentic Antique Maps? We determine the price of each map based on condition, location mapped, desirability, and rarity, among other factors. We sell for multiple dealers. With each dealer setting their own price, sometimes the same map will be in our collection with different prices.\n\nWhere do we get our antique maps? We travel the world to source maps for our collection. We purchase on the private market from collectors, dealers, and individuals. There is no single source for antique maps. Knowing where to look, how to source, and what is a good investment are tricks of our trade.\n\nWhat are Cadastral Maps? We specialize in cadastral maps, cartographic time capsules representing the natural and built forms of locales across America. Cadastral maps represent structures, building materiality, property ownership, and infrastructure. Cadastral maps were used by municipalities, real estate firms, attorneys, surveyors, insurance companies and others that needed a detailed record of where properties were located, what was built on them, and who owned them. Cadastral map makers used a graphic code of bright colors to indicate the construction types of the buildings, i.e. pink for brick and yellow for wood. Cadastral maps were published to paying subscribers in bound atlases. Each cadastral atlas depicted a specific county, city or neighborhood and typically had 20-40 maps known as \"plates.\" Each plate showed a specific geographic area, usually only a few city blocks or a portion of a town. A few plates depicted part or all of one city ward, hence our moniker, \"ward maps.\"\n\nFine Art Prints / Reproduction Maps\n\nPrinting: We print in-house to control all aspects of print quality and consistency.\n\nPrinters: We exclusively utilize Epson commercial-grade Ultrachrome printers and pigment inks.\n\nPapers: We print onto Epson Premium and Ultra-premium matte-finish papers engineered for Epson Ultrachrome printers.\n\nPaper Sizes / Prices:\n\nSmall 8 1/2\" x 11\" Paper = $14.95\n\nStudio 11\" x 14\" Paper = $19.95\n\nMedium 13\" x 19\" Paper = $29.95\n\nIntermediate 18\" x 24\" Paper = $49.95\n\nLarge 24\" x 36\" Paper = $69.95\n\nOversize (Special Order Only) 44\" Paper = $22.50/SF\n\nQuality: Our fine art prints are museum-quality, no-fade, color-stable, acid-free, and archival.\n\nLayout: All maps are printed as large as possible onto the selected paper size. The original proportions of the map are maintained. No stretching to fill the paper occurs. Given that the proportions of each map rarely matches that of the paper, there is always white space around the map. Maps are centered onto the paper as much as possible.\n\nLead time: Unframed prints are typically ready for shipment or pickup within a few days of order placement.\n\nHow do we digitize our maps? The vast majority of our antique maps have been scanned by us, in-house through a large-format, commercial-grade, feed-scanner scanner. Maps are scanned at 300-1200dpi in a single pass, allowing us to capture all of the detailed text, colors, building plans and place names of each map. We do not assemble any of our maps from a series of smaller scans. For oversize and fragile maps we outsource the digitalization and utilize a high resolution digital camera, similar to that used by the Museum of Fine Arts Boston to capture large art work for printing. Certain maps are already digitized by third parties for inclusion in our collection. We only work with digital files of the highest resolution and quality.\n\nWho makes our map reproductions? We print in-house to control all aspects of print quality and consistency.\n\nWhat printers and papers do you use? We exclusively utilize Epson commercial-grade Ultrachrome printers and pigment inks. We print onto Epson Premium and Ultra-premium matte-finish papers engineered for Epson Ultrachrome printers. Our fine art prints are museum-quality, no-fade, color-stable, acid-free, and archival.\n\nHow are maps formatted onto paper? All maps are printed as large as possible onto the selected paper size. The original proportions of the map are maintained. No stretching to fill the paper occurs. Given that the proportions of each map rarely matches that of the paper, there is always white space around the map. Maps are centered onto the paper as much as possible. Maps are oriented onto paper with the long side of the map printed to align with the long side of the paper. Maps are always centered within each piece of paper.\n\nWill watermarks appear on printed maps? The \"WardMaps LLC\" watermarks seen on maps displayed on the website will not appear on either the authentic antique maps nor fine art map reproductions. The watermark is only visible on maps displayed on our website.\n\nFRAMING\n\nFabrication: All of our frames are 100% made in Cambridge, Massachusetts USA. We have a longstanding relationship with a local fine art framer who exclusively produces all of our frames.\n\nTypes:We offer three types of framing. Each has different styles. Scroll down for details about each.\n\nCustom/Archival Framing\n\nEconomy/Non-Archival Framing\n\nSmall/No Matting; Studio/No Matting; Medium/No Matting Framing\n\nWhy choose Custom/Archival framing? We recommend Custom/Archival frames when framing any antique map. All antique maps can fade when exposed to direct or indirect sunlight. Custom/Archival frames feature UV-resistant glazing to protect an antique map from fading. Custom/Archival frames feature acid-free mat boards and backing boards that will not damage antique maps. Store bought frames typically do not use UV-resistant glass nor acid-free materials. A Custom/Archival frame is the best way to protect and display an antique map for the ages. We do not offer glare-reducing glazing.\n\nWhy choose Economy/Non-Archival framing? Economy/Non-Archival frames are perfect for our reproduction maps. Since our fine art prints are archival (made with archival inks and acid-free papers), UV-resistant glazing nor acid-free boards are required to protect the reproduction. Economy/Non-Archival frames offer a sensible price point and affordable way to bring a framed map into any space. We do not offer glare-reducing glazing.\n\nFrame Prices/Sizes: All frame prices listed below do not include the cost of any antique map, map reproduction, print, shipping, or sales tax. See any individual map page on our site to explore calculated total costs for map + frame + sales tax + shipping.
