Schmöger, 25 Jan 2002\n\nKraiburg Coat of Arms\n\nShield Azure a coronet Or.\n\nMeaning:\n\nThe coronet is based on a misinterpretation of the town's name in the 16th century as Kronburg, i.e. the crown's castle or crowned castle. The coronet first appeared on a local seal from 1557 and is part of the common rolls of arms since 1562. The oldest local seal however, probably made in 1493 and known by a print from 1514, displayed a gonfanon with three tips. This symbol reminds on the short rule of Count Hartmann of Werdenberg-Sargans between 1256 and 1259. The gonfanon of Tübingen had been the heraldic symbol of the counts, who were also called \"counts of the banner\". Before the town had been a possession of the Counts of Ortenburg-Kraiburg. In 1529 Duke Heinrich of Niederbayern acquired the town. The Wittelsbach kin had already granted the rights of a market town in 1385. In the 16th century the meaning of the gonfanon was no longer known, it had been interpreted as a comb and later as a coronet.\n\nSources:\n\nWanka 1989, pp.48-49 and Stadler 1965, p.90\n\nM. Schmöger, 25 Jan 2002 and Klaus-Michael Schneider, 13 Oct 2020\n\nThe arms are in use since about1557/1562. The arms were confirmed and the banner approved on 3 October 1972 by district governor (Regierungspräsident) of Oberbayern.\n\nM. Schmöger, 25 Jan 2002"
