Information current for 2024.\n\nTip: If leaving from the Gare de Lyon, have a meal before your train at the fabulous Train Bleu restaurant or use the Big Ben bar as your VIP waiting lounge. If leaving from the Gare du Nord, I recommend the Brasserie Terminus Nord across the road.\n\nBefore you buy your tickets\n\nTake a moment to read these tips for buying European train tickets. They answer the usual questions, \"Do I need to book in advance or can I buy at the station?\", \"Can I stop off?\", \"Are there Senior fares?\" and that old favourite, \"Should I buy an $800 railpass or a 35 point-to-point ticket?\". How far ahead can you buy train tickets?\n\nEuropean train travel FAQ\n\nParis station guides\n\nParis Gare du Nord\n\nParis Gare de l'Est\n\nParis Gare de Lyon\n\nParis Gare d'Austerlitz\n\nParis Gare Montparnasse\n\nParis Gare de Bercy\n\nParis Gare St Lazare\n\nParis to anywhere else in France\n\nYou can buy tickets for suburban & regional trains at the station, they usually have fixed prices that don't change and no reservation is necessary or possible. This includes RER (Paris suburban trains) and TER (Trains Exprès Regionaux).\n\nHowever, almost all French long-distance trains including high-speed TGVs & Intercités have compulsory reservation and every ticket comes with a reserved seat. Like airlines they offer cheap inflexible fares if you book well in advance, much more expensive flexible fares if you buy closer to departure date. So book ahead!\n\nBuy tickets at SNCF's own website www.sncf-connect.com (in , no booking fee) or www.raileurope.com (in , £ or $, small booking fee, about Raileurope) or www.thetrainline.com (in , £ or $, small booking fee, about Trainline).\n\nYou usually print your tickets or can show them on your phone, or you can collect tickets from any main French station. Anyone from any country can use these sites.\n\nWhen booking 1st class tickets on TGVs & Intercités, www.sncf-connect.com & www.thetrainline.com allow you to choose your seat from a seat map.\n\nSee this comparison of websites selling French train tickets\n\nSee the Train Travel in France page for a beginner's guide to train travel within France.\n\nParis to Nice from 25, see the Paris to Nice page\n\nThe impressive 300 km/h (186 mph) TGV Duplex trains link Paris & Nice in as little as 5h40 centre to centre from 25. A flight takes 4 hours of train, airport, flight, airport & bus, and pumps up to 10 times the CO2 emissions into the upper atmosphere. As an experience, there's no comparison: After speeding down the scenic Rhone Valley at up to 300 km/h (186 mph), the trains slow right down, passing Marseille with the Chateau d'If visible out in the bay. After St Raphael, the train skirts the Cote d'Azur past rocky headlands, yacht-filled bays and millionaires' villas. THIS is the way to go! And there's a sleeper option, too. More about trains from Paris to Nice. Scenery photo courtesy of Mike Sloan.\n\nBack to top\n\nParis to Corsica\n\nStep 1, travel from Paris to Toulon by TGV Duplex, leaving Paris Gare de Lyon at 10:10 arriving Toulon 14:11.\n\nThe TGV Duplex has a café-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi.\n\nIn theory you can leave Paris later, but you need to allow for getting from station to ferry terminal and for the ferry check in and for any delay, so I'd stick with this departure. Have an early dinner in Toulon.\n\nFares start at 25 in 2nd class or 45 in 1st class. Fares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nBuy tickets at the French Railways website www.sncf-connect.com (in , no booking fee) or www.raileurope.com (easy to use, in , £ or $, small booking fee, about Raileurope) or www.thetrainline.com (easy to use, in , £ or $, small booking fee, about Trainline).\n\nBooking opens up to 4 months ahead. You print your own ticket or can show a mobile ticket on your phone.\n\nTip: www.sncf-connect.com & www.thetrainline.com allow you to choose your seat from a seat map when booking 1st class tickets.\n\nTip: Check ferry times before booking your train.\n\nIn Toulon, it's a 1.6 km 21-minute walk from station to the Corsica Ferries terminal, see walking map, or take a taxi.\n\nStep 2, sail overnight from Toulon to Ajaccio or Bastia on Corsica with Corsica ferries, typically sailing around 20:00 and arrives around 07:00.\n\nThere's a range of comfortable cabins available with shower & toilets.\n\nFares start at around 33 plus cost of cabin.\n\nCheck times, fares & buy tickets at the Direct Ferries website or see www.corsica-ferries.co.uk.\n\nBack to top\n\nParis to London in 2h20 from 57\n\nOption 1, Paris to London by Eurostar\n\nEurostar links Paris Gare du Nord with London St Pancras almost every hour or so through the day in around 2h20 centre to centre.\n\nSee the London to Paris by Eurostar page for more about Eurostar, the journey, tips for choosing the best seats & video guide.\n\nFares start at 57 one-way or 99 return. Eurostar has airline-style pricing so book early for the cheapest fare.\n\nBuy tickets at either www.eurostar.com, www.sncf-connect.com or www.thetrainline.com.\n\nYou print your own ticket or can download the Eurostar app and show it on your phone. Booking opens up to 6 months ahead.\n\nHowever you buy, after booking you can load it into the Eurostar app and (if you like) view or change your seats on a seat map.\n\nBuy onward tickets from London to other British towns & cities at www.thetrainline.com.\n\nYou collect tickets from the self-service ticket machines or in many cases you can print them out or show it on your phone.\n\nIf you're booking a train-specific Advance fare and your onward train leaves from St Pancras, Kings Cross or Euston, I'd allow at least 1 hour between Eurostar arrival and any onward train to allow for delay, even though it only takes 3 minutes to walk across the road to Kings Cross or 10 minutes to walk to Euston. I'd allow 90 minutes if booking a train-specific Advance fare and your onward train goes from Paddington, Waterloo or Liverpool Street as then you'll need to change stations by Underground or taxi.\n\nOption 2, by train & ferry\n\nYou can still travel from Paris to London by train, ferry and train, either in a day via Calais/Dover or Dieppe-Newhaven, or via routes with a longer sea crossing such as Caen-Portsmouth which offers a 'sleeper' service where you can sleep on the ferry overnight.\n\nSee the London-Paris by train & ferry page.\n\nBack to top\n\nParis to Dublin from £88.50\n\nOption 1, Paris to Dublin via a direct France-Ireland ferry\n\nStep 1, take a train from Paris to Cherbourg.\n\nOn most days you'll find a train leaving Paris St Lazare around 10:59 arriving in time to connect with a 16:30 ferry.\n\nHowever, you should book the ferry first & confirm sailing time, then book a train that arrives at least 2-3h beforehand, remembering the 1-hour ferry check-in.\n\nFares start from 20 if you book ahead and commit to a specific train, or costs around 55 if you turn up and buy on the day.\n\nCheck train times & prices from Paris to Cherbourg at www.thetrainline.com (easy to use, in , £ or $, overseas credit cards no problem, small booking fee) or the French Railways website www.sncf-connect.com (in , no booking fee). You print your own ticket or can select a mobile ticket to show on your phone.\n\nIn Cherbourg, it's a 3.2 km 10-minute taxi ride or a 2.9 km 37-minute walk from the station to the ferry terminal, see walking map.\n\nStep 2, sail from Cherbourg to either Rosslare or Dublin\n\nIrish Ferries (www.irishferries.com or www.directferries.com) sail from Cherbourg to Dublin every 2-3 days all year. The ferry typically sails at 16:30 and arrives 10:45 next morning. Fares from around 51 + mandatory private cabin. Cabins start from around 74 for a 4-berth with shower & toilet. You can easily buy tickets at www.directferries.com in multiple languages, in £ or .\n\nThis is the easiest route to use, their luxurious new superferry WB Yeats carries foot passengers on this route, a wonderful cruise with bars, restaurants & cosy private cabins. Their smaller ferry Epsilon doesn't carry foot passengers. Check schedules at www.irishferries.com.\n\nStena Line (www.stenaline.co.uk or www.directferries.com) sail every few days from Cherbourg to Rosslare, foot passengers carried. Sailings are overnight, times vary. A range of comfy private cabins is available. Trains link Dublin Connolly, Wicklow, Wexford & Rosslare Harbour, see www.irishrail.ie.\n\nOption 2, Paris to Dublin via London\n\nStep 1, travel from Paris Gare du Nord to London St Pancras by Eurostar in 2h20 from 57. Book this at www.eurostar.com.\n\nStep 2, take the train & ferry service from London Euston via Holyhead to Dublin Ferryport as shown on the London to Ireland page.\n\nThe fares is either £44.50 or £50, one or other of these prices always applies. Book this at tfw.wales, see my advice here.\n\nIt's an inexpensive, fun and interesting way to go. You can do the journey in a single (long) day, taking a morning Eurostar to London then an afternoon London-Dublin service (see the London-Dublin timetable here), or split it over different days with an overnight stop in London.\n\nI'd recommend at least 90 minutes in London between trains to ensure a robust connection, even though it only takes 9 minutes to walk down the main road between St Pancras and Euston stations, see walking map.\n\nYou print your own Eurostar ticket or can show it on your phone in the Eurostar app. You collect your London to Dublin SailRail ticket from the ticket machines at London Euston.\n\nYou'll find more about Eurostar on the London to Paris by Eurostar page and more about London to Dublin by train & ferry on the London to Ireland page.\n\nBack to top\n\nParis to Brussels, Antwerp or Liege from 29\n\nOption 1, by Eurostar (formerly Thalys) high-speed train\n\nHigh-speed Eurostar (formerly Thalys) trains run from Paris Gare du Nord to Brussels Midi every hour or so in 1h22, centre to centre.\n\nIt's faster than flying and a lot more relaxing. Thalys trains go direct from Paris to Antwerp & Liege, too.\n\nThe trains run at up to 300 km/h (186 mph) on the high-speed line, with cafe area, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi. They have 3 classes: Standard (2nd class), Comfort (1st class) & Premium (1st class with at-seat food & wine included in the fare and access to lounges in Paris & Brussels). See more about Eurostar (formerly Thalys).\n\nFares start at 29 in standard class, 55 in comfort class or 115 in premium class.\n\nFares vary like air fares, so book ahead. If you buy on the day it costs 109 full-flex in standard class, ouch! All tickets come with a seat reservation and are only valid on the specific train you book. The cheapest fares mean limited or no refunds or changes to travel plans.\n\nBuy tickets at www.eurostar.com (easy to use, in  or £, no booking fee) or the French Railways website www.sncf-connect.com (in , no booking fee) or www.thetrainline.com (in , £ or $, easy to use, small booking fee).\n\nBooking opens up to 4 months ahead. You print your own ticket (A4 paper, Letter size is fine) or can show a mobile ticket on your phone.\n\nTip: Check what the price is for a journey from Paris to Rotterdam or Aachen on the same train, as it's often cheaper than the fare to Brussels. If so, buy to Rotterdam/Aachen and simply get off in Brussels!\n\nA Eurostar (formerly Thalys) at Paris. More info about Eurostar (formerly Thalys).\n\nOption 2½, Paris to Brussels by fast EuroCity train **** additional for the Olympics ****\n\nFor the Olympics from 24 July to 11 August and 28 August to 8 September, SNCB (Belgian Railways) offer one or two daily EuroCity trains from Paris to Brussels via the classic non-high-speed line. These trains run at up to 200 km/h (125mph) with just one stop at Mons.

Bring your own food & drink as there's no catering.\n\nWhy would you want to use this slow route?\n\nIf Eurostars are fully-booked, you can still use this route. If Eurostar want over 100 for a Paris-Brussels ticket, you use this route for around 50, even buying tickets on the day. If you have an Interrail or Eurail pass, Eurostar charge a 27 reservation fee which often sells out close to departure, you can use this route with no reservation, no extra cost, just hop on and show your pass!\n\nThe service shown below started in December 2022, when an increased Charleroi-Maubeuge cross-border service was introduced.

Change at Geneva or Lausanne for Montreux, Brig & Zermatt. Change at Zurich HB for Chur, St Moritz, Davos or Klosters.\n\nThe Paris-Geneva route is the most scenic of the TGV-Lyria routes. After 2 hours dashing along the high-speed line past pretty French villages at 300 km/h the train slows right down and for the last hour winds through the French hills of the Haut-Bugey Line and over the dramatic Cize-Bolozon viaduct across the Ain gorge, see the Paris-Geneva photos.\n\nTip: Why not have a meal at the remarkable Train Bleu restaurant at the Gare de Lyon before taking a TGV-Lyria to Switzerland?\n\nFares start at 29 in standard class, 51 in standard première or 184 in business première.\n\nFares vary like air fares, so book ahead.

Trainline has a connection to both the SNCF (French Railways) and the SBB (Swiss Railways) ticketing system so can sell cheaper Swiss Supersaver fares & Saver Day Pass for the Swiss part of the journey. Raileurope & www.sncf-connect.com only connect to the SNCF system so can only sell expensive full-flex fares for the Swiss section.\n\nThe Paris-Geneva route has the nicest scenery of all the TGV-Lyria routes. The TGV leaves the high-speed line and slows right down to join the Haut-Bugey Line for the last hour or so into Geneva. After a short tunnel the train crosses the spectacular Cize-Bolozon viaduct over the Ain gorge (above), the major structure on the Haut-Bugey line. The best view from the viaduct is on the left hand side of the train, pictured above.\n\nThe train snakes through the hills on the wonderfully scenic Haut-Bugey line.\n\nMore scenery as the Paris-Geneva TGV-Lyria heads through the hills along the river valley between Bourg en Bresse & Bellegarde. This great view is on the right hand side, although you can't pick sides when booking.\n\nNearing Switzerland, the train passes a lake, probably the Lac de Nantua, left hand side.\n\nBack to top\n\nParis to Turin & Milan\n\nOption 1, Paris to Turin & Milan by French Railways TGV - direct trains, 3 per day\n\nEvery day, 3 French Railways high-speed TGV trains link Paris Gare de Lyon with Turin Porta Susa (5h40) & Milan Porta Garibaldi (7h) from 29, see the Paris to Milan by train page for details.\n\nUpdate: The direct Paris-Milan line via Modane was blocked by a landslide in August 2023, and remains blocked in 2024.

I recommend an upper deck seat for the best views, any seat number >60 is upper deck.\n\nIt's a scenic ride, the train passes Béziers cathedral, flamingos on the lakes between Montpelier & Narbonne, the historic Fort de Salses right by the tracks before Perpignan, with great views of the imposing 2,784m Mt Canigou as the train rounds the southern end of the Pyrenees. More about the Paris-Barcelona journey.\n\nA flight from Paris to Barcelona takes up to 5 hours when you include ground transportation, check-in and airport security hassle, it's more interesting and relaxing to take a Paris-Barcelona TGV train from city centre to city centre while you chill out, in reality it takes hardly any longer.\n\nFares start at 39 in 2nd class or 59 in 1st class.

One of the highest peaks in the mighty Pyrenees, the 2,784m (9,137 feet) high Mt Canigou dominates the skyline on the right all the way from Perpignan to Girona, see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canigou. More photos of what to see on the Paris-Barcelona train journey.\n\nOption 2, Paris to Barcelona by overnight train via Latour de Carol\n\nThe Paris-Barcelona Elipsos sleeper train was discontinued in 2013, but you can still travel overnight, using the French overnight train from Paris to Latour de Carol, then a local train through the scenic Pyrenees to Barcelona Sants. Departure from Paris around 21:40, arrival in Barcelona around 14:00 next day.\n\nSee the Paris to Barcelona by sleeper train page for full details, prices, tips & how to buy tickets.\n\nOption 3, Paris to Barcelona by overnight train via Perpignan/Cerbère\n\nThis is very similar to option 2, but uses the Paris-Perpignan-Cerbère overnight train rather than the Paris-Latour one, so you go along the coast rather than directly through the Pyrenees. This night train runs daily in summer, but usually only Fridays & Sundays in winter. Departure from Paris around 21:00, arrival in Barcelona around 14:00 next day.\n\nSee the Paris to Barcelona by sleeper train page for full details, prices, tips & how to buy tickets.\n\nBack to top\n\nParis to Madrid\n\nOption 1, Paris to Madrid in a day - the fastest option, from 77\n\nStep 1, travel from Paris to Barcelona by TGV Duplex, leaving Paris Gare de Lyon at 09:42 and arriving Barcelona Sants at 16:31.\n\nThis impressive 320 km/h (199 mph) double-deck TGV Duplex has a cafe-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi.

There's great scenery winding down out of the Pyrenees. These trains also have an interesting party trick: Half way through the journey they pass slowly through a shed, and axles adjust from Iberian gauge (5'6\") to standard gauge (4'8½\") before taking the modern high-speed line to Madrid.\n\nFares start at 23 in standard class or 29 in comfort class.
