        "text": "(Run-time 1 hour and 34 minutes approx.)\n\nThe line from Z端rich to Chur in the South-East part of the country travels through some wonderful mountain scenery as well as along Lake shores and the conurbations that border the capital city. This programme looks at the typical types of train that can be seen on this busy and picturesque stretch of railway. Filmed in 2022 we travel from Sargans in a north-westerly direction calling in to a number of stations along the route. A mixture of modern electric multiple units and locomotive-hauled stock as well as ICE and TGVs, plus a mixture of freight services make up this programme, providing a comprehensive look at services along this line; so useful if you are planning a visit or you are interested in Swiss Railways. We also call in at a major train-watching hot-spot north-west of Z端rich at Killwangen not far from the major freight yard at Limmattal. Together in this programme we see SBB and S端dostbahn trainsets at work including Classes 500, 502, 511, 514, 526 and 560. In addition locomotive types witnessed are drawn from Classes 420, 620, 843, 185, 484, 460, 450 and Austrian class 1116."
