        "text": "General\n\nThe family name Wichser originates, according to Paul Oetli's German-Swiss surnames, from the tree name Weichsel (dialect: Wiechsel).\n\nThe appearance of the name originally shows in the form der Wiechselere, later Wiechseler, Wichseler, Wichssler, Wichsser and Wichser. [ In a copy of old records sent to me from Switzerland, I also discovered it spelled Wychser. In the United States the spelling also occurs as Wickser. [CBW]\n\nThe Wichser family is an original, scattered and reformed main family of the land Glarus, citizens of the towns of Schwanden, Glarus, Linthal, Ruti and Betschwanden.\n\nJohann Heinrich Tschudi writes in his book printed in Zurich in 1714, \"Description of the Lob'l. Towns and Country Glarus\", according to papers of Aegidius Tschudi:\n\nIt is however, to remark, that twelve free, old and blue blooded families descended from this original Sekingischen family. The heads of these twelve families represented the Country's Regiment and defended with shield and spear the House of God's Rights when they found it necessary to protect it.\n\nThese families were the Wichsslers, now Wichsser.\n\nFrom these, the Kilchmatter and the Wichssers from Hr. Gulor were brought into the register of the Rhaetischen-Edel-Knechten; if same and those from the land of Glarus originated from the same tree is not known to me.\n\nHistory\n\n1220\n\nIn this year the Wichser family appeared for the first time in papers. Through one of the records of that year is shown that the former Meier Heinrich Tschundi divided his loans and possessions among his three sons. Witnesses to this transaction were the Ritters of Wildegg, Wagenburgh and Karpfenstein, also some respected citizens of Glarner (Glarus), among them Albertus der Wiechseler.\n\n1256\n\nMore importantly, in this year is the appearance of Hugo Wichseler. The Meier Rudolf Tschudi died in 1253. Since he left no children, the Abbess of Säckingen lent the Meier-Office to the Ritter of Windegg, whose mother Margaretha was a sister of Meier Rudolf Tschudi. Two sides spoke out against this loan. On one side was the uncle of the deceased, the Minister Johannes Tschudi, who maintained he had the most rights to the Meier-Office since this had belonged to the men of the Tschudi family. On the other side was Hugo Wichseler, Herrmann in the Kilchmatte, and Hugo Vogel claimed rights to the respectful and successful Meier-Office. They stated that they, as brothers-in-law of the deceased, were next in line, especially since they, as free people of the land Glarus should have preference over non-Glarner (Glarus) Ritter Diethelm of Windegg.\n\nOn August 24, 1256 the Abbess called her Vassallen to Sackingen and laid before them the above question of rights. The gathering decided unanimously that the Abbess had the free and complete right to appoint whoever she wished to the Meier-Office and her original decision stood. That is, Diethelm of Windegg remained Meier of Glarus and Hugo Wichseler, who among the named brothers-in-law apparently most hoped for the Meier-Office had to abandon his expectations. Hugo Wichseler was born in 1208 and was married to Appalonia Tschudi.\n\n1291\n\nOrigin of the comradeship oath ... [rest of this entry is not legible]\n\n1335\n\nBecause a new regiment was chosen at this time at Zürich, and was divided into Constafel and Zünfte, there came to the Zünftmaster position Heinrich Tschudi and Heinrich Wichssler. ----- [further entry not legible]\n\n1347\n\nIn this time after 1256 the Meier-Office and Vogt-Office over the Glarnerland was transferred to the Herzogs of Austria and those Vogts sat over the lands.
