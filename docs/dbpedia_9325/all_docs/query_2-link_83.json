        "text": "Sargans is first mentioned in 765 as de Senegaune though this comes from a 16th Century copy of the original. In 1248 it was mentioned as Sanegans, in 1264 as Sangans and in 1332 as Santgans. It was first recorded as Sargans in the late 16th century.\n\nSargans was an independent county from the 11th century until 1798, when it was incorporated in the Canton of Linth of the Helvetic Republic, and eventually in the Canton of St. Gallen in 1803"
