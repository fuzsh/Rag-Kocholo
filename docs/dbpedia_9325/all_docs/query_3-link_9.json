        "text": "“If we’re going to be that close, why don’t we see Liechtenstein?” The Fabulous Wife suggested as we planned our trip to Switzerland. That had just enough quirky appeal to persuade me, so we reserved a hotel room in Sargans, a border town of 6,200, and from there took a twenty-minute bus ride to Vaduz, Liechtenstein’s capital (even smaller than Sargans).\n\nWhy stay in Sargans? Lots of trains stop there — and it has a castle! The 15th century stronghold overlooks the Seez Valley, which runs from the Rhine River into Switzerland’s heart. Back in the old days, if the Habsburg Empire marched an army toward Zurich, the garrison manning the Sargans castle spread the alarm.\n\nHiking up to the castle, we heard the bells of Swiss livestock, in this case goats and sheep munching away in steep meadows. (In California we call that fire control.) It was a sweet pastoral counterpoint to the church bells that entranced us in Zurich, more than compensating for the trip-long failure to hear Switzerland’s other cliché sounds, yodels and alphorns.\n\nToday the town of Sargans owns the castle and uses it mainly as a restaurant and snack bar. From the ramparts we could see the next castle over — in Liechtenstein. We could also see the Rhine. And plenty of Alps. When we finished gawking, we bought scoops of Movenpick Swiss Chocolate ice cream at the snack bar. Movenpick sticks with a pre-Ben-&-Jerry’s recipe, aerating its ice cream to make it light and dry. Bleh — but it was ice cream, and we were in a castle in Switzerland, and we could see Liechtenstein, so it was delicious! (With tastebuds, context matters.)\n\nThe next day we crossed the Rhine into Liechtenstein. There’s no border fuss — not even a “you are entering” or “you are leaving” sign. And that’s a big clue about Liechtenstein: to a day visitor, it seems like just another Swiss canton. The language is German. The currency is the franc. The supermarkets are Coop and Migros. The people are pleasant and prosperous. The window-shopping Fabulous Wife found that in Vaduz the women’s clothing was in neutral blacks, grays, and beiges, whereas in Zurich the latest fashions burst with greens and oranges, but if there were more consequential differences between the two countries, we didn’t notice them.\n\nLiechtenstein is just 62 square miles, slightly larger than San Francisco. But San Francisco has 800,000 inhabitants and Liechtenstein fewer than 40,000, so we expected to find plenty of empty space. We were surprised that the three municipalities we rode through (Balzers and Triesen in addition to Vaduz) ran together. Evidently you have to go to the high country to escape civilization.\n\nThe center of Vaduz consists mostly of two long streets. One (the Aulestrasse) permits cars, the other (the Stadtle) supposedly doesn’t, but some vehicles push through anyway. The Government Building is on the Stadtle, next to the cathedral. Vehicles can drive right up to the front door, and do. I saw two or three suited security guards on watch, but they looked unarmed and, though husky, unathletic. Perhaps snipers were posted on nearby rooftops. But my guess is Liechtenstein deems itself too small and out of the way to warrant fanatical security.\n\nIt was raining on and off, so instead of a long and potentially soaking climb to the castle, we headed west to the border (the Rhine River) and were rewarded with gorgeous views."
