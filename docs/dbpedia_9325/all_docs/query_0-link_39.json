        "text": "Hi,\n\nI actually live in Liechtenstein and the best way is to go to Zurich and then Sargans(Switzerland). The train ride is very nice. From Sargans there are busses into Liechtenstein but the trains are practically non-existant. Most trains only travel through Liechtenstein to get to Austria but they don't stop often, if at all, and there are no stops in Vaduz. There are regional trains going up the Rhine to Buchs SG and then busses to Liechtenstein from there, but it's just easier to take the bus directly from Sargans.\n\nIt's a very small country~Vaduz has about 5,000 people and Schaan, the largest town is not much larger. You can see the entire country in two days without problem depending on if you visit museums, do a wine tasting, or go snowshoeing (based on today's weather), etc. There's a very nice hotel in Malbun as well, in case you are looking.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nDiana"
