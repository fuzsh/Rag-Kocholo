        "text": "June 2024. Sargans. Switzerland.\n\nBack at Basel station, you can see why the streets are so quiet;\n\nit’s like Cambridge on steroids.\n\nWe’d resisted the £25 schnitzel in the Braunen Mutz, but these gooey, cheese-filled concoctions were equally calorific at a fifth of the price.\n\nAnd then an efficient (expensive) rail trip across the width of northern Switzerland to the Liechtenstein border,\n\nwith just a half hour stop in Zurich where Mrs RM forbade me from popping out to tick a bar so this is all I got there.\n\nSome stereotypical Swiss views as you along the banks of Lake Zurich,\n\nbut the real treat comes just before we leave the train at Sargans, the castle coming into view.\n\nFrom Sargans, an hourly bus to Vaduz, and that all-important new country tick. Will it turn up ?\n\nMrs RM is restless; she’s almost there. I fancy exploring this Swiss outpost, and ask Untappd for advice.\n\nOooh, a station bar with craft cans ! And a castle !\n\nMrs RM is having none of it, and jumps on the Number 11 a second before it leaves.\n\nSorry, Sargans."
