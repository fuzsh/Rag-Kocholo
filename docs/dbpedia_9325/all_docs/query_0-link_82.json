If I’m out in nature with everything I need in the world on my back, chances are my smile is wide and my thoughts are clear.“\n\nThe Hiking Life is a compilation of tips and advice on trip planning, lightweight backpacking techniques, and improving your wilderness skill set. It contains detailed information for more than 200 of the world’s great hikes and was put together with the mission of inspiring and enabling folks to go backpacking.\n\n~ Cam “Swami” Honan – “The most traveled hiker on earth” (Backpacker Magazine, January 2015)"
