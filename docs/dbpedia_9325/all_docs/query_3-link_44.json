I'd allow 90 minutes if booking a train-specific Advance fare and your onward train goes from Paddington, Waterloo or Liverpool Street as then you'll need to change stations by Underground or taxi.\n\nBack to top\n\nSwitzerland to Dublin & Ireland\n\nOption 1, Switzerland to Dublin via London & Holyhead - daily departures\n\nDay 1, travel from Switzerland to London by TGV-Lyria & Eurostar, as shown on the London to Switzerland page.\n\nStay overnight in London, see suggested hotels near St Pancras.\n\nDay 2, travel from London Euston to Dublin on the morning train & ferry service, arriving Dublin Ferryport 17:25, see details here.\n\nIt's only a 10 minute walk between St Pancras & Euston stations. Rail & Sail is an inexpensive, fun and interesting way to go, see an illustrated account of the journey. By all means stop off in London for longer if you like.\n\nOption 2, Switzerland to Dublin via Paris & Cherbourg - several times a week\n\nDay 1, travel from Switzerland to Paris on any afternoon or early evening high-speed TGV-Lyria train, as shown below.\n\nYou can book from anywhere in Switzerland to Paris at www.thetrainline.com from 29 upwards.\n\nStay overnight in Paris, see suggested hotels near the stations.\n\nDay 2, travel from Paris to Dublin by train & ferry, taking a morning train from Paris St Lazare to Cherbourg & an overnight ferry to Dublin as shown in the Paris to Dublin section, arriving in the morning on Day 3.\n\nIrish Ferries sails Cherbourg-Dublin several times a week. Start by booking the ferry at www.irishferries.com and add a train connection using www.thetrainline.com, see the Paris to Dublin section for details.\n\nBack to top\n\nSwitzerland to Paris from 29\n\nTGV-Lyria high-speed trains link Switzerland with Paris on three routes:\n\n- Geneva to Paris Gare de Lyon in 3h10.\n\n- Lausanne to Paris Gare de Lyon in 3h38.\n\n- Zurich HB & Basel SBB to Paris Gare de Lyon: Basel-Paris 3h03, Zurich-Paris 4h03.\n\nTGV-Lyria trains have a cafe-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi, see more about about TGV-Lyria.\n\nThey have 3 classes: Standard (2nd class), Standard Premiere (1st class) and Business Premiere (a separate 1st class car with flexible tickets and a meal with wine included in the fare).\n\nThe Geneva-Paris route is particularly scenic: For the first hour the train passes at slow speed through the wonderful mountains of the Haut-Bugey route, crossing the remarkable Cize-Bolozon viaduct over the Ain gorge, before joining the high-speed line for the 2-hour dash to Paris across rural France, see the Paris-Geneva photos here.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nFares start at 29 in Standard, 51 Standard Première, 184 Business Première.\n\nFares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nHow to buy tickets for TGV-Lyria\n\nBuy tickets at www.sncf-connect.com (in , no booking fee) or www.raileurope.com (in , £ or $, small booking fee, about Raileurope) or www.thetrainline.com (in , £ or $, small booking fee, about Trainline).\n\nBooking opens up to 4 months ahead. You print your own ticket or can show a mobile ticket on your phone.\n\nTip: www.sncf-connect.com & www.thetrainline.com allow you to choose your seat from a seat map when booking 1st class tickets.\n\nHow to buy tickets from anywhere in Switzerland to Paris\n\nYou can buy tickets from almost any Swiss town or city to Paris at www.thetrainline.com or www.raileurope.com (both easy to use, in CHF, , £ or $, overseas credit cards no problem, small booking fee) or the Swiss Railways website www.sbb.ch (in CHF, more fiddly).\n\nHow it works: Unlike the German & Austrian railways, TGV-Lyria don't offer through tickets from other Swiss cities to Paris at inclusive prices. So a journey from Interlaken to Paris (for example) involves a Swiss ticket from Interlaken to Basel and a TGV-Lyria ticket from Basel to Paris. www.thetrainline.com & www.raileurope.com connect to both the Swiss & French ticketing systems so can book such a journey as one transaction, seamlessly sourcing both tickets.\n\nTip: Swiss trains are very punctual, but I'd play safe and take a Swiss connecting train which arrives at the interchange station at least 20 minutes before your TGV-Lyria leaves. If that means a 40 minute connection rather than the 10 minutes suggested online, so be it!\n\nTip: Normal Swiss domestic tickets have a fixed price and are good for any train that day, so you can buy them any time, even on the day of travel, they can't sell out. But if you book in advance at www.thetrainline.com or www.sbb.ch, you can find advance-purchase Supersaver tickets (specified train only, no refunds) for longer Swiss journeys which save up to 70% off the regular fare. A Swiss Saver Day Pass can also be cheaper than a regular ticket, and www.thetrainline.com will offer that if it's the cheapest option.\n\nThe Geneva-Paris route has the nicest scenery of all the TGV-Lyria routes. For the first hour or so out of Geneva, the train snakes through the hills on the wonderfully scenic Haut-Bugey line. Above, a lake, probably the Lac de Nantua.\n\nMore scenery as the train snakes through the hills on the wonderfully scenic Haut-Bugey line.\n\nMore scenery along the river valley between Bourg en Bresse & Bellegarde. This wonderful view is on the left hand side, although you can't pick sides when booking.\n\nTowards the end of the Haut-Bugey Line the train crosses the spectacular Cize-Bolozon viaduct over the Ain gorge (above), the major structure on the Haut-Bugey line. The best view from the viaduct is on the right hand side of the train when heading towards Paris, pictured above.\n\nBack to top\n\nSwitzerland to Bordeaux, Toulouse, Lourdes, Brittany & northern France\n\nOption 1, Switzerland to anywhere in France via Paris - this usually means changing stations by taxi or metro.\n\nStep 1, travel from Switzerland to Paris Gare de Lyon by TGV-Lyria as shown above.\n\nTransfer by taxi or metro from the Gare de Lyon to the relevant Paris station for your onward train.\n\nStep 2, take an onward train from:\n\nParis Montparnasse to Le Mans, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Biarritz, Lourdes, Brittany.\n\nParis Austerlitz to Orleans, Limoges, Brive, Cahors\n\nParis St Lazare to Rouen, Le Havre, Caen, Cherbourg.\n\nParis Gare du Nord to Amiens, Lille, Calais.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nSwitzerland to Paris starts at 29 in 2nd class or 51 in 1st class. Fares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nParis to other French cities typically starts at 25 in 2nd class or 45 in 1st class.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nBuy tickets from Switzerland to any French city at www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com (both easy to use, in , £ or $, overseas credit cards no problem, small booking fee).

From southern or eastern Switzerland, the route via Milan is best if you're going to Nice, but the route via Geneva & Lyon is better if you're going to Lyon or Avignon.\n\nOption 1, Switzerland to Nice via Geneva & Lyon\n\nStep 1, travel from any Swiss city to Geneva by Swiss domestic train. I'd allow at least 30 minutes between trains in Geneva.\n\nStep 2, travel from Geneva for Lyon Part-Dieu by TER regional train, these leave every hour or so, journey time around 2h.\n\nThe trains are composed of former inter-city carriages so very comfortable. There's no catering, so bring your own food & drink. It's a lovely journey through the Jura and along the river Rhône.\n\nStep 3, take a TGV from Lyon Part-Dieu to Avignon, Aix, Marseille, Toulon, Cannes, Nice, Nimes, Montpellier, Perpignan.\n\nAll these TGVs have a cafe-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi.\n\nSadly, the direct TGVs from Geneva to Avignon & Marseille were discontinued in December 2019.\n\nFor example:\n\nLeave Geneva 05:14, change at Lyon Part-Dieu, arrive Nice 12:55.\n\nLeave Geneva 15:14, change at Lyon Part-Dieu, arrive Nice 22:28.\n\nTimes may vary and other journeys are possible with a second change of train, so check online.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nGeneva to Lyon costs 31.90 in 2nd class, 42.40 in 1st class, fixed-price, good for any train that day.\n\nLyon to other French cities such as Nice or Marseille starts at 25 in 2nd class or 45 in 1st class. Fares vary like air fares.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nThe easiest way to find train times & buy tickets from anywhere in Switzerland to anywhere in France is at www.thetrainline.com, in CHF, , £ or $, overseas credit cards no problem, small booking fee. Booking opens up to 4 months ahead.\n\nTip: You might get better results if you first book from Geneva to France, add that to your basket, then book a Swiss connecting ticket as a second booking, add that to your basket and check out.\n\nYou can also book from Geneva to French cities at the French Railways website www.sncf-connect.com (in , no booking fee).\n\nIt can help to remember that Geneva in French is Genève, and the main station in Geneva is sometimes called Geneva Cornavin.\n\nOption 2, Switzerland to Nice Milan & Ventimiglia\n\nStep 1, travel from Switzerland to Milan Centrale by train, a few scenic hours through the Alps, see the Switzerland to Milan page.\n\nStep 2, travel from Milan Centrale to Menton, Monte Carlo, Nice, Antibes or Cannes using a Trenitalia InterCity train to Ventimiglia, then a French TER local train from Ventimiglia onwards, see the timetable & information on the Milan to Nice page.\n\nFor example, you can leave Zurich HB at 10:33 by EuroCity train, change at Genoa Piazza Principle onto the 16:58 Intercity to Ventimiglia, a connecting TER local train will get you to Monte-Carlo at 19:47, Nice Ville at 20:11 & Cannes at 20:52.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nZurich to Milan starts at 29 in 2nd class or 49 in 1st class. Fares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nMilan to Ventimiglia starts at 19.90 in 2nd class or 26.90 in 1st class. Fares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nVentimiglia to Nice by TER costs 9.20, fixed-price, good for any train that day. 7.50 or 5 promotional fares sometimes offered.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nBuy tickets at www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com (both easy to use, in , £ or $, overseas cards no problem, small booking fee).\n\nBooking usually opens up to 4 months ahead. If you have any problems, book each train separately, add to basket & check out.\n\nAll these tickets can be printed out or shown on your phone.\n\nOption 3, Basel to Lyon, Avignon, Marseille via Mulhouse - a once-a-day service from Basel that might come in useful\n\nStep 1, travel from Basel to Mulhouse by TER regional train leaving Basel SBB at 16:21 and arriving Mulhouse at 16:44.\n\nStep 2, travel from Mulhouse to Lyon, Avignon & Marseille by TGV Duplex, leaving Mulhouse at 17:09 and arriving Lyon Part Dieu 19:56, Avignon TGV 21:09, Aix en Provence TGV 21:31 & Marseille St Charles 21:46.\n\nThe TGV Duplex has a cafe-bar, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi. I recommend an upper deck seat for the best views.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nBasel to Mulhouse costs 8.80, fixed-price.\n\nMulhouse to Avignon or Marseille starts at 25 in 2nd class or 45 in 1st class. Fares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nBuy tickets at www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com (both easy to use, in , £ or $, overseas credit cards no problem, small booking fee). You can also book at the French Railways website www.sncf-connect.com (in , no booking fee).\n\nBooking usually opens up to 4 months ahead. You print your own ticket or can show it on your phone.\n\nBack to top\n\nSwitzerland to Mulhouse, Colmar, Strasbourg\n\nStep 1, travel from anywhere in Switzerland to Basel SBB by Swiss train.\n\nNormal full-price Swiss tickets are good for any train that day as is a Saver Day Pass, but advance-purchase Supersaver fares are only good for the specific train you book.\n\nStep 2, travel from Basel SBB to Mulhouse, Colmar & Strasbourg by TER (Train Régional Express).\n\nThese leave every hour or at times every half hour from platforms 31-35 at Basel SBB, sometimes known as Basel SNCF. Basel to Strasbourg takes just 1h20 at up to 200 km/h.\n\nThese TER trains have 1st & 2nd class, but no catering so bring your own food & drink. They are composed of an electric locomotive and spacious, smooth-riding Corail cars bumped down from mainline service, showing their age but pretty comfortable. There are no seat reservations, you sit where you like.\n\nBasel to Strasbourg costs 28 normal tariff, even bought on the day. Unlimited availability, cannot sell out.\n\nHowever, cheaper train-specific fares from 10 may be available if you book ahead.\n\nCheck times and buy tickets from anywhere in Switzerland to Mulhouse, Colmar or Strasbourg at www.thetrainline.com.\n\nwww.thetrainline.com connects to both the SBB (Swiss) and SNCF (French) ticketing systems so can seamlessly ticket a journey from anywhere in Switzerland to Mulhouse Colmar or Strasbourg. You print your own ticket or can show them on your phone.\n\nBooking for the Basel-Strasbourg trains opens up to 4 months ahead.\n\nBack to top\n\nSwitzerland to Brussels & Bruges from 37.90\n\nOption 1, Switzerland to Brussels by ICE high-speed train through Germany - the fast & easy route\n\nTake a superb German ICE train from Switzerland to Frankfurt and another ICE train to Brussels. For example:\n\nLeave Zurich HB 05:59 & Basel SBB 07:06, change at Frankfurt (Main) Hbf, arrive Brussels Midi 13:35.\n\nLeave Zurich HB 07:59 & Basel SBB 09:06, change at Frankfurt (Main) Hbf, arrive Brussels Midi 15:35.\n\nLeave Zurich HB 09:59 & Basel SBB 11:06, change at Frankfurt (Main) Hbf, arrive Brussels Midi 17:35.\n\nLeave Zurich HB 11:59 & Basel SBB 13:06, change at Frankfurt (Main) Hbf, arrive Brussels Midi 19:35.\n\nLeave Zurich HB 13:59 & Basel SBB 15:06, change at Frankfurt (Main) Hbf, arrive Brussels Midi 21:35.\n\nLeave Interlaken Ost 05:58, Bern 07:04, change at Frankfurt (Main) Hbf, arrive Brussels Midi 15:35.\n\nLeave Interlaken Ost 10:00, Bern 11:04, change at Frankfurt (Main) Hbf, arrive Brussels Midi 19:35.\n\nThese ICE trains all have a restaurant car, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi. Times may vary at certain times of year.\n\nFrom anywhere else in Switzerland, simply catch a Swiss domestic train to Basel or Zurich to connect. I'd allow at least 20 minutes between trains in Basel or Zurich.\n\nFares start at 37.90 in 2nd class or 69.90 in 1st class.\n\nFares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nGerman Railways offer Sparpreis tickets from almost any Swiss station to any Belgian station.\n\nBuy tickets at the German Railways website int.bahn.de.\n\nYou can book from almost anywhere in Switzerland to Brussels, Bruges or anywhere in Belgium for one inclusive price.\n\nBooking opens up to 6 months ahead.

More about ICE trains. Photo courtesy of Christian Hunt.\n\nOption 2, Switzerland to Brussels via the Rhine Valley - the scenic route, takes an extra hour\n\nTake one of two direct EuroCity trains from Switzerland to Cologne, then an ICE train to Brussels.\n\nLeave Zurich HB at 10:59 or Basel SBB at 12:20 on train EC8, change at Cologne Hbf and arrive Brussels Midi at 19:35.\n\nLeave Interlaken Ost 12:00, Bern 13:04 or Basel SBB at 14:27 on train EC6, change at Cologne Hbf and arrive Brussels Midi at 21:35.\n\nBoth EuroCity trains have spacious and comfortable Swiss Federal Railways EuroCity cars and an elegant Swiss restaurant car. Instead of taking the high-speed line between Mainz & Cologne, these trains take the classic line along the scenic Rhine valley, past river boats, vineyards, castles and the legendary Lorelei Rock, see the Rails Down the Rhine page. I think it's worth the extra time! The ICE trains between Cologne & Brussels have a restaurant car, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi.\n\nFares start at 37.90 in 2nd class or 69.90 in 1st class.\n\nFares vary like air fares, so book ahead..\n\nBuy tickets at the German Railways website int.bahn.de.\n\nYou can book from almost anywhere in Switzerland to Brussels, Bruges or anywhere in Belgium for one inclusive price.\n\nTo get the Rhine Valley scenic route, click Stopovers and enter Koblenz Hbf with length of stay left as 00:00.\n\nBooking opens up to 6 months ahead.

Train EC8 from Zurich & Basel to Cologne conveys a wonderful Swiss 1st class panorama car, the Rails Down the Rhine video. Speeding along the Rhine in this is a real treat, yet all you need to sit in it is a 1st class ticket. To make sure you get a seat in it, add a seat reservation when you book, using the select seat link to pick a seat in car 263, see the advice on the Rails Down the Rhine page.\n\nOption 3, Zurich & Basel to Brussels using the Zurich-Cologne sleeper train - the time-effective option\n\nStep 1, travel from Switzerland to Cologne by Nightjet sleeper train leaving Zurich HB at 21:59 & Basel SBB 23:13, arriving Cologne Hbf 05:53.\n\nThis comfortable Nightjet train has two air-conditioned sleeping-cars, one running Basel-Cologne-Amsterdam, one Zurich-Basel-Cologne-Amsterdam.

The train has couchette cars with 4 & 6 berth compartments, and ordinary seats. A light breakfast is included in sleepers & couchettes, served in your compartment. Watch the Amsterdam-Switzerland sleeper video.\n\nFares start at 49.90 in 6-berth couchettes, 59.90 in 4-berth couchettes, 89.90 in a 3-bed sleeper, 109.90 in a 2-bed sleeper or 159.90 in a single-bed sleeper, all per person per berth.

Prices vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nBook this train at www.raileurope.com (easy to use, in , £ or $, overseas credit cards no problem, small booking fee) or at the French Railways website www.sncf-connect.com (in , no booking fee).\n\nOption 4, Geneva to Brussels using the direct Lyon-Brussels TGVs - convenient with no need to cross Paris\n\nThis is a hassle-free way from Geneva to Brussels, faster than option 1 when starting in Geneva. You take a TER regional train from Geneva to Lyon Part Dieu, then take a direct high-speed TGV from Lyon Part Dieu to Brussels Midi which by-passes Paris. For example:\n\nLeave Geneva 07:14, change at Lyon Part Dieu, arrive Brussels Midi 15:25.\n\nLeave Geneva 09:14, change at Lyon Part Dieu, arrive Brussels Midi 17:43.\n\nLeave Geneva 13:14, change at Lyon Part Dieu, arrive Brussels Midi 20:43.\n\nLeave Geneva 15:14, change at Lyon Part Dieu, arrive Brussels Midi 22:43.\n\nThe TER regional train is comfortable, but with no catering, so bring your own food & drink. It's a pretty journey through the Jura and along the River Rhône. The TGV has a cafe-bar.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nGeneva to Lyon costs 31.90 in 2nd class, 42.40 in 1st class, fixed-price, good for any train that day.\n\nLyon to Brussels starts at around 35 in 2nd class or 55 in 1st class.

Look carefully for options with 1 change, at Lyon and (most importantly) without any change in Paris.\n\nOr book at www.raileurope.com, clicking More options and entering Lyon Part Dieu as a via station. You can also book at the French Railways website www.sncf-connect.com (in , no booking fee), again specifying Lyon Part Dieu as a via station.\n\nOption 5, Switzerland to Brussels via Paris - cheap & fast, but involves crossing Paris. Geneva to Brussels in as little as 5h36\n\nStep 1, take a TGV-Lyria high-speed train from Geneva, Lausanne, Zurich HB or Basel SBB to Paris Gare de Lyon.\n\nTGV-Lyria trains have 3 classes, a cafe-bar, and power sockets at all seats, see the TGV-Lyria guide. Geneva or Basel to Paris takes a little over 3 hours, Zurich to Paris 4h03.\n\nAllow at least 60 minutes to change trains & stations by metro or taxi from the Gare de Lyon to the Gare du Nord\n\nStep 2, take a Eurostar (formerly Thalys) high-speed train from Paris Gare du Nord to Brussels Midi, they leave almost every hour taking 1h22.\n\nEurostar trains have 3 classes, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi. More about Eurostar (formerly Thalys).\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nSwitzerland to Paris starts at 29 in 2nd class or 51 in 1st class.\n\nParis to Brussels starts at 29 in 2nd class or 59 in 1st class.\n\nFares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nBuy tickets at www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com, both easy to use, in , £ or $, overseas cards no problem, small booking fee.\n\nIf using www.raileurope.com you can specify a more robust connection in Paris: Set up the enquiry from Switzerland to Brussels, click More options and enter Paris (any station) as a via station, with 1 hour stopover duration. That gets you a robust connection, by default the system allows cross-Paris connections as tight as 42 minutes, I recommend at least an hour, ideally more.\n\nBooking opens up to 4 months ahead. You print your own ticket or can show a mobile ticket on your phone.\n\nYou can also book at the French Railways website www.sncf-connect.com, in , no booking fee. You can specify via Paris, but there's no stopover duration setting so to get a robust connection in Paris you might need to book Switzerland-Paris & Paris-Brussels separately.\n\nOption 6, Switzerland to Brussels with overnight stop in Frankfurt - might work out more time-effective\n\nStep 1, travel from Switzerland to Frankfurt on any late afternoon or early evening ICE train you like.\n\nFor example, you can leave Zurich HB as late as 18:59 and Basel SBB at 20:13 arriving Frankfurt (Main) Hbf at 23:08 (23:52 some dates), but by all means book an earlier one for more of an evening in Frankfurt.\n\nCheck times from anywhere in Switzerland to Frankfurt at int.bahn.de.\n\nStay overnight in Frankfurt. Hotels next to the station with good or great reviews include the Flemings Express Hotel & Hotel Hamburger Hof, both of which I have used myself and can recommend. There's also The Frankfurt and the inexpensive Hotel Topas.\n\nStep 2, travel from Frankfurt to Brussels on any morning train you like, they leave every two hours.\n\nFor example, you can leave Frankfurt (Main) Hbf at 06:28 arriving Brussels Midi 09:35, or at 08:16 arriving Brussels Midi 11:35.\n\nFares start at 37.90 in 2nd class or 69.90 in 1st class.\n\nFares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nBuy tickets at the German Railways website int.bahn.de.\n\nYou can book from anywhere in Switzerland to Brussels, Bruges or anywhere in Belgium.\n\nTo get the overnight stop, you must click Stopovers and enter Frankfurt (Main) Hbf as a stopover with a suitable length of stay, say 10 hours. Adjust the departure time and increase or decrease the length of stay to get the trains you want either side of Frankfurt.\n\nBooking opens up to 6 months ahead. You print your own ticket or can show it on your phone or laptop. I recommend registering when prompted so you can log in & check your bookings or re-print tickets at any time.\n\nBack to top\n\nSwitzerland to Amsterdam from 37.90\n\nOption 1, Switzerland to Amsterdam by Nightjet sleeper train - the time-effective option\n\nNew from the timetable change in December 2021, a Nightjet sleeper train leaves Zurich HB at 21:59 & Basel SBB at 23:13 every evening, setting down at Arnhem & Utrecht and arriving Amsterdam Centraal at 09:14.\n\nThis comfortable Nightjet train has two air-conditioned AB33 sleeping-cars, one running Zurich-Basel-Amsterdam, one Basel-Amsterdam. Each sleeping-car has 11 compartments, each of which can be used as 1, 2 or 3 berth (single, double or triple) with washbasin. The sleeping-car attendant can serve drinks, snacks & light meals from a room service menu. The train has a Zurich-Amsterdam couchette car with 4 & 6 berth compartments, one or two Basel-Amsterdam couchette car, and ordinary seats. A light breakfast is included in sleepers & couchettes, served in your compartment. More about Nightjets.\n\nFares start at 49.90 in 6-berth couchettes, 59.90 in 4-berth couchettes, 89.90 in a 3-bed sleeper, 109.90 in a 2-bed sleeper or 159.90 in a single-bed sleeper, all per person per berth. Fares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nBook this train at www.oebb.at. Booking opens up to 6 months ahead, sometimes less.\n\nTip: This train may be listed in the search results twice, once as an IC with seats, once as an NJ with couchettes/sleepers. Choose the latter!\n\nOption 2, Switzerland to Amsterdam by daytime trains - the fast daytime option\n\nTake a superb German ICE train from Switzerland to Frankfurt, then another ICE train to Amsterdam. For example:\n\nLeave Zurich HB 05:59 & Basel SBB 07:06, change at Frankfurt (Main) Hbf, arrive Amsterdam Centraal 15:29.\n\nLeave Zurich HB 09:59 & Basel SBB 11:06, change at Frankfurt (Main) Hbf, arrive Amsterdam Centraal 20:29.\n\nLeave Zurich HB 14:34 & Basel SBB 15:06, change at Frankfurt (Main) Hbf, arrive Amsterdam Centraal 23:29 (not Saturdays, not some dates).\n\nOr leave Basel SBB 15:13 by direct ICE to Amsterdam Centraal, arriving 21:59 (runs most days, not all).\n\nLeave Interlaken Ost 05:58, Bern 07:04, change at Frankfurt (Main) Hbf, arrive Amsterdam Centraal 15:29.\n\nLeave Interlaken Ost 10:00, Bern 11:04, change at Frankfurt (Main) Hbf, arrive Amsterdam Centraal 20:29.\n\nThese ICE trains all have a restaurant car, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi. Times may vary due to trackwork.\n\nFrom anywhere else in Switzerland, simply catch a Swiss domestic train to Basel or Zurich to connect. I'd allow at least 20 minutes between trains in Basel or Zurich. You can check times from anywhere in Switzerland to Amsterdam at int.bahn.de.\n\nFares start at 37.90 in 2nd class or 69.90 in 1st class.\n\nFares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nBuy tickets at the German Railways website int.bahn.de.\n\nYou can book from almost anywhere in Switzerland to Amsterdam or anywhere in the Netherlands for one inclusive price.\n\nBooking opens up to 6 months ahead. You print your own ticket or can show it on your laptop or phone. I recommend registering when prompted so you can log in & check your bookings or re-print tickets at any time.\n\nTip: It can help to click Stopovers and enter Frankfurt (Main) Hbf as a stopover station. It should normally be possible to make this journey with only 1 change.\n\nAn ICE3neo at Amsterdam Centraal. Click on the interior images for larger photos.\n\nOption 3, Switzerland to Amsterdam via the Rhine Valley - the leisurely scenic route, takes an hour longer\n\nTake one of two direct Swiss EuroCity trains from Switzerland to Cologne, then an ICE train to Amsterdam.\n\nLeave Zurich HB at 10:59 or Basel SBB at 12:20 on train EC8, change at Cologne Hbf, and arrive Amsterdam Centraal at 20:29.\n\nLeave Interlaken Ost 12:00, Bern 13:04 or Basel SBB 14:27 on train EC6, change Cologne Hbf or Düsseldorf & arrive Amsterdam Centraal 23:29.\n\nBoth EuroCity trains have spacious and comfortable Swiss Federal Railways EuroCity cars and an elegant Swiss restaurant car. Instead of taking the high-speed line between Mainz & Cologne, these trains take the classic line along the scenic Rhine valley, past river boats, vineyards, castles and the legendary Lorelei Rock, see the Rails Down the Rhine page. I think it's worth the extra hour! The ICE trains between Cologne & Brussels have a restaurant car, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi.\n\nFares start at 37.90 in 2nd class or 69.90 in 1st class.\n\nFares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nBuy tickets at the German Railways website int.bahn.de.\n\nYou can book from almost anywhere in Switzerland to Amsterdam or anywhere in the Netherlands for one inclusive price.\n\nTo get the Rhine Valley scenic route, click Stopovers and enter Koblenz Hbf with length of stay left as 00:00.\n\nBooking opens up to 6 months ahead. You print your own ticket or can show it on your laptop or phone. I recommend registering when prompted so you can log in & check your bookings or re-print tickets at any time.\n\nTip: Panorama car on train EC8. You will thank me for this! Train EC8 from Zurich & Basel to Cologne conveys a wonderful Swiss 1st class panorama car, see the Rails Down the Rhine video. Speeding along the Rhine in this is a real treat, yet all you need to sit in it is a 1st class ticket. To make sure you get a seat in it, add a seat reservation when you book, using the select seat link to pick a seat in car 263, see the advice on the Rails Down the Rhine page.\n\nOption 4, Switzerland to Amsterdam with overnight stop in Frankfurt - might work out more time-effective for you\n\nStep 1, travel from Switzerland to Frankfurt on any late afternoon or early evening ICE train you like.\n\nFor example, you can leave Zurich HB as late as 18:59 and Basel SBB at 20:13 arriving Frankfurt (Main) Hbf at 23:08 (23:52 some dates), but by all means book an earlier one for more of an evening in Frankfurt.\n\nCheck times from anywhere in Switzerland to Frankfurt at int.bahn.de.\n\nStay overnight in Frankfurt. Hotels next to the station with good or great reviews include the Flemings Express Hotel & Hotel Hamburger Hof, both of which I have stayed at and can recommend. There's also The Frankfurt and the inexpensive Hotel Topas.\n\nStep 2, travel from Frankfurt to Amsterdam on any morning train you like, they leave every two hours.\n\nFor example, you can leave Frankfurt (Main) Hbf at 07:26 arriving Amsterdam Centraal at 11:29, or have a leisurely breakfast and catch the later 09:27 arriving 13:29.\n\nFares start at 37.90 in 2nd class or 69.90 in 1st class.\n\nFares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nBuy tickets at the German Railways website int.bahn.de from anywhere in Switzerland to anywhere in the Netherlands.\n\nYou can book from almost anywhere in Switzerland to Amsterdam or anywhere in the Netherlands for one inclusive price.\n\nTo get the overnight stop, click Stopovers and enter Frankfurt (Main) Hbf with a suitable length of stay, say 10 hours. Adjust departure time and increase or decrease the length of stay to get the trains you want either side of Frankfurt.\n\nBooking opens up to 6 months ahead. You print your own ticket or can show it on your phone or laptop. I recommend registering when prompted so you can log in & check your bookings or re-print tickets at any time.\n\nBack to top\n\nSwitzerland to Luxembourg from 37.90\n\nOption 1, Switzerland to Luxembourg via Basel, Mulhouse, Strasbourg, Metz - in theory the fastest & most direct route\n\nYou can travel from Basel to Luxembourg on a series of TER regional trains (and the occasional TGV) via Mulhouse, Strasbourg & Metz, with Basel-Luxembourg taking as little as 3h36.\n\nHowever, since the two direct Basel-Luxembourg trains were discontinued in 2016, it's become something of a mish-mash of services with 1, 2 or 3 changes in various different places, beware of tight connections with potentially long waits if you miss them.\n\nBuy tickets at the French Railways website www.sncf-connect.com.\n\nJust see what times and fares are available and choose what seems best for you. Booking opens up to 4 months ahead.\n\nYou can also book at www.raileurope.com and www.thetrainline.com, both easy to use, in , £ or $, small booking fee.\n\nDepending on your starting point in Switzerland, it might even be cheaper and/or faster to book a TGV-Lyria from Switzerland to Paris Gare de Lyon from 29, cross Paris by taxi or metro, then take a TGV from Paris Gare de l'Est to Luxembourg from 25. This is an option worth considering if you are starting in Geneva or Lausanne.\n\nTo find journeys via Paris, run an enquiry at www.raileurope.com, but before you run it, click More options, enter Paris (any station) as a via station with a stopover duration of at least 1 hour. By default, the system allows cross-Paris connections as tight as 42 minutes, I'd never book one less than an hour. You can also book at the French Railways website www.sncf-connect.com (in , no booking fee) but this doesn't allow you to specify a stopover duration.\n\nOption 2, Switzerland to Luxembourg via Basel & Koblenz from 37.90 - slower but cheaper & easier to book, with through tickets.\n\nThis is a longer way round, but it's much easier to book, more frequent & significantly cheaper thanks to German Railways through fares from almost any Swiss station to Luxembourg. As it involves a scenic ride along the Rhine & Moselle valleys I think I'd prefer this route over the theoretically faster route through France!\n\nRun an enquiry from any Swiss station to Luxembourg Gare at int.bahn.de, many possible departures are available from early morning until early afternoon. But I'd suggest this one with only 1 change and a special panorama car in 1st class. Obviously, from anywhere in Switzerland you'd simply take a connecting train to Basel or Zurich to pick it up:\n\nLeave Zurich HB at 10:59 or Basel SBB at 12:13, change at Koblenz Hbf, arriving Luxembourg 19:23.\n\nThe 10:59 EuroCity train from Zurich is train EC8, with spacious & comfortable Swiss Federal Railways EuroCity cars and an elegant Swiss restaurant car. It takes the classic line along the scenic Rhine valley between Mainz & Koblenz, past river boats, vineyards, castles and the legendary Lorelei Rock, see the Rails Down the Rhine page.\n\nTrain EC8 conveys a wonderful Swiss 1st class panorama car, see the Rails Down the Rhine video. Speeding along the Rhine in this is a real treat, yet all you need to sit in it is a 1st class ticket. To make sure you get a seat in it, add a seat reservation when you book, using the select seat link to choose a seat in car 263, see the advice on the Rails Down the Rhine page.\n\nFares start at 37.90 in 2nd class or 69.90 in 1st class.\n\nFares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nBuy tickets at the German Railways website int.bahn.de.\n\nYou can book from almost anywhere in Switzerland to Luxembourg for one inclusive price.\n\nBefore running the enquiry, click Stopovers and enter Trier Hbf leaving length of stay zero. This forces the journey planner to find journeys via this route, it also eliminates journeys involving a bus. Look for journeys with just 2 changes, if not using a 1-change option.\n\nBooking opens up to 6 months ahead. You print your own ticket or can show it on your laptop or phone. I recommend registering when prompted so you can log in & check your bookings or re-print tickets at any time.\n\nBack to top\n\nSwitzerland to Milan, Venice, Florence, Rome & Italy from 29\n\nChoose between fast, comfortable & scenic (option 1, using mainline trains) and slow, comfortable, fabulous world-class highlight-of-your-trip scenic (option 2, via the Bernina Express). The choice is yours! With the daytime trains increasingly fast, there are no longer any sleeper trains between Switzerland and Italy.\n\nUpdate 2024: A freight train derailed in the Gotthard Base Tunnel in August 2023, in 2024 trains are still being diverted over the original (much more scenic) Gotthard line taking an extra hour and with fewer departures. Check times online.\n\nOption 1, Switzerland to Milan by EuroCity train, then high-speed train to Venice, Florence, Rome or Naples - the fast & comfortable way\n\nStep 1, travel from Zurich, Geneva, Lausanne & other Swiss cities to Milan Centrale by EuroCity train.\n\nZurich - Lugano - Milan: EuroCity trains run every hour or two taking 3h17 on the Gotthard route through lovely Alpine scenery - although 20 minutes is spent in the Gotthard Base Tunnel, the world's longest rail tunnel. Some trains also call at Como San Giovanni, for Lake Como.\n\nZurich to Venice by direct train: A direct EuroCity train leaves Zurich HB at 08:33 every day for Verona Porta Nuova & Venice Santa Lucia on the Grand Canal in central Venice, arriving 14:42. Until the Base Tunnel problems are resolved, this train is leaving an hour earlier, at 07:33.\n\nGeneva - Lausanne - Montreux - Brig - Milan: EuroCity trains run 4 or 5 times daily, Geneva-Milan in 3h55. This is the Simplon route via the famous Simplon Tunnel opened in 1906, with great views as you run along the shores of Lake Leman and past many Swiss vineyards.\n\nGeneva, Lausanne, Brig to Venice by direct train: The 05:39 from Geneva extends to Verona & Venice Santa Lucia arriving 12:42.\n\nBasel - Spiez - Brig - Milan EuroCity trains run several times a day, Basel-Milan in around 4h12.\n\nBasel - Lucerne - Lugano - Milan a direct EuroCity train runs once a day from Lucerne to Milan at 12:18, but other departures are possible with an easy change of train at Arth Goldau into a Zurich-Milan EuroCity. A few minutes is all you need to change at Arth Goldau, it's only a small station.\n\nFrom Interlaken, take a local train from Interlaken Ost to Spiez and either change there onto the two or three daily Spiez-Milan EuroCity trains, or you'd change at Spiez onto another Swiss domestic train to Brig to pick up a Brig-Milan EuroCity train.\n\nFrom Zermatt, take the local train from Zermatt to Brig and join a (Geneva-) Brig-Milan EuroCity train there.\n\nThe new Gotthard Base Tunnel came into use in December 2016: Until 2016, the Zurich-Milan trains travelled over the Gotthard pass through dramatic track spirals and the original much shorter (15 km) Gotthard tunnel, reaching a maximum altitude of 1,154m (3,786 feet) above sea level, the most scenic of all mainline routes through the Alps. The new Gotthard Base Tunnel, significantly cuts journey time by replacing the most scenic hour of the Gotthard route with 20 minutes in a 57 km tunnel, only reaching 550m (1,805 feet) above sea level. Those of us who remember the old route find the new route a disappointment. Those who don't know what they're missing will find plenty of scenery on the revised Gotthard route, from delightful Swiss meadows & mountains to the beauty of Lake Lugano, see video of a journey from Milan to Zurich via the new tunnel. But if it's world-class high-altitude Alpine scenery you want, take the much slower narrow-gauge Bernina Route.\n\nStep 2, travel from Milan Centrale to Verona Porta Nuova, Venice Santa Lucia, Florence SMN, Rome Termini or Naples Centrale by Frecciarossa.\n\nThese Italian domestic high-speed trains run at least every hour. Milan Centrale to Florence SMN takes just 1h45, Milan to Venice Santa Lucia 2h35, Milan to Rome Termini 2h40. City centre to city centre with no check-in or airport hassle.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nZurich, Geneva, Basel, Bern, Lucerne or Lausanne to Milan starts at 29 in 2nd class or 49 in 1st class.\n\nMilan to Florence or Venice starts at 19.90 in 2nd class or 29.90 in 1st class.\n\nMilan to Rome or Naples starts at 29.90 in 2nd class or 39.90 in 1st class.\n\nFares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nHow to buy tickets\n\nBuy tickets at either www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com.\n\nBoth are easy to use, in , £ or $ (www.thetrainline.com can also sell in CHF), overseas credit cards are no problem, small booking fee.\n\nwww.thetrainline.com connects to both the Swiss & Italian ticketing systems. www.raileurope.com connects to the Italian system and can sell full-flex Swiss tickets through an arrangement with French Railways. That means both sites can sell from anywhere in Switzerland to anywhere in Italy, at least in principle. Each handles the data slightly differently, so I'd check both sites.\n\nBooking for Swiss domestic trains opens up to 6 months ahead. Booking for the international EuroCity trains opens 4 months ahead.\n\nTickets can be printed out or shown on your phone.\n\nHow to buy tickets, advanced\n\nNow for the science bit. The Swiss ticketing system can sell Swiss domestic tickets & tickets for the international EuroCity trains to Italy which it jointly runs with Trenitalia, but it cannot access Trenitalia's ticketing system so cannot sell Trenitalia's cheap fares for trains within Italy.\n\nOn the other hand, Trenitalia's ticketing system can sell cheap tickets for the international EuroCity trains between Switzerland and Italy, and obviously for its own trains within Italy, but cannot access SBB's ticketing system so cannot sell any journey involving a Swiss domestic train.\n\nStep 1, run an enquiry on the all-Europe online timetable provided by German Railways at int.bahn.de. Look for a suitable journey, ideally with as few changes of train as possible. Note down the trains you want, identifying the Swiss domestic train(s), the cross-border EuroCity train and the onward Italian train(s).\n\nFor example, say you ran an enquiry from Zermatt to Rome. You'd pick a journey that suits you: A Swiss train from Zermatt to Brig, a EuroCity (EC) train from Brig to Milan, then a high-speed Frecciarossa from Milan to Rome. Then you'd split the booking like this:\n\nStep 2, book the cross-border EuroCity train and onward Italian train using the Italian ticketing system at www.thetrainline.com or www.raileurope.com (both easy to use, in , £ or $, Trainline can also sell in CHF, overseas credit cards no problem, small booking fee) or www.italiarail.com (easy to use, in , $ or £, they'll refund the 3.50 booking fee to seat61 users if you email them after booking at seat61@italiarail.com) or www.trenitalia.com (in , more fiddly, requires Italian-language place names, see advice on using it).\n\nIn our example, you'd book from Brig to Rome. Booking opens 90 days ahead. The EuroCity & Italian high-speed trains are ticketless, you simply print out your booking reference or show it on your phone.\n\nStep 3, now add a Swiss domestic ticket separately using either www.thetrainline.com (easy to use, in CHF, , £ or $, overseas credit cards no problem, small booking fee) or the Swiss Federal Railways site www.sbb.ch (in , no fee). Regular Swiss tickets are fixed-price, cannot sell out, and are good for any train that day, so this bit isn't as crucial. You could buy at the station on the day if you like!\n\nIn our example, you'd book from Zermatt to Brig. You print your own ticket.\n\nOption 2, Switzerland to Italy via the Bernina route - the ultimate scenic route\n\nIf you have time and want spectacular scenery, try the fabulous narrow gauge Bernina route.\n\nIt's a day out, Zurich to Milan in 8h30 on 3 separate trains rather than only 3h17 on a direct mainline train, but the Bernina route is truly one of the World's greatest train rides, and arguably the best Alpine train trip of all. It'll be a highlight of your trip! If you're already in the St Moritz area, this is the most direct route to Italy. Video of a Milan to Zurich journey on the Bernina Express.\n\nStep 1, travel on any morning train from Zurich HB to Chur, this route runs every 30 minutes, no reservation necessary or possible.\n\nIf you want to use the actual panoramic Bernina Express itself rather than just regular trains on the same route, you'll need to leave Zurich HB at 07:07, see the Berlin Express timetable.\n\nStep 2, change at Chur onto the narrow-gauge Bernina Railway, run by the Rhätische Bahn. If you use the normal local trains no reservation is necessary, just buy a ticket (in fact, you can buy a Zurich to Tirano through ticket in Zurich) and hop on the next train.\n\nIf you want to use the once daily Bernina Express with its special panoramic carriages you need a seat reservation, make a reservation and buy tickets as shown on the Bernina Express page.\n\nIn Tirano, the RhB station is adjacent to the Italian station on the same town square. It only takes 5-10 minutes to switch trains in Tirano, if you have longer you can enjoy a beer and sandwich at Margy's Bar across the road between trains.\n\nStep 3, take a regional train from Tirano to Milan Centrale, fare around 12, no reservation needed or possible, just buy a ticket to Milan and hop on the next train. These local trains run every 2 hours, check times at www.trenord.it. If the ticket office is closed, ask in the station cafe, they sell train tickets, but you must pay cash in .\n\nThe Tirano to Milan regional trains run along the pretty eastern shore of Lake Como, stopping at Lecco, Bellano & Varenna (for ferry to Bellagio), handy if you're staying in the Lake Como area.\n\nBook onward Italian trains from Milan to Rome, Florence, Venice at either www.italiarail.com or www.trenitalia.com\n\nFor full details of times, fares & how to buy tickets, see the Bernina Express page.\n\nBack to top\n\nSwitzerland to Sicily\n\nOption 1, Switzerland to Sicily using the Milan-Sicily sleeper\n\nDay 1, travel from Switzerland to Milan Centrale by EuroCity train.\n\nThere are various possible departures, for example leaving Geneva at 13:39 arriving Milan Centrale at 17:40, or leaving Zurich HB at 15:33 arriving Milan Centrale 18:50.\n\nUpdate: A freight train derailed in the Gotthard Base Tunnel in August 2023, in 2024 Zurich-Milan trains are still being diverted over the original (much more scenic) Gotthard line taking an extra hour and with fewer departures. Check times online.\n\nCheck times & buy a ticket from anywhere in Switzerland to Milan at www.thetrainline.com, making sure you arrive in Milan before 19:00, to ensure a robust connection.\n\nIdeally, travel earlier and have an early dinner at Milan Centrale, there's an excellent, inexpensive & typically Italian restaurant that gets great reviews just 5 minutes walk from the station, Noblesse Oblige, www.ristorantenoblesseoblige.com, see walking map.\n\nFares start at 29 in 2nd class or 49 in 1st class. Fares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nBuy tickets at www.thetrainline.com (easy to use, in , £ or $, overseas credit cards no problem, small booking fee) or www.sbb.ch (in CHF) and print them out or show them on your phone.\n\nDay 1, travel from Milan to Sicily on Italy's longest train ride, the epic Intercity Notte sleeper train leaving Milan Centrale at 20:10 every night and arriving next day (day 2) at Catania 14:32, Siracuse 15:48 with another portion to Palermo arriving 16:56.\n\nBoth the Milan-Palermo and Milan-Siracuse portions of this train have 4-berth Comfort couchettes and a sleeping-car with 1, 2 & 3 bed compartments. The Milan-Catania-Siracuse portion has an Excelsior sleeping-car with several deluxe compartments with toilet & shower.\n\nThe train is ferried across the Straits of Messina to Sicily on a train ferry, a unique experience and one of the few places in the world where trains go onto ferries. See the Trains to Sicily page for more information, photos & tips.\n\nFares start at 39.90 in a 4-berth comfort couchette, 49.90 in a 3-bed sleeper, 59.90 in a 2-bed sleeper, 89.90 in a single-bed sleeper. Prices are per person per bed. Fares vary like air fares, so book ahead..\n\nBuy tickets at www.thetrainline.com (easy to use, in , £ or $, overseas credit cards no problem, small booking fee) or Trenitalia.com (in ) and print them out or show them on your phone. Booking opens up to 4 months ahead.\n\nOption 2, Switzerland to Sicily using a Rome-Sicily sleeper\n\nDay 1, travel from Switzerland to Rome in a day as shown above and book this at www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com.\n\nYou take a EuroCity train from Basel, Geneva or Zurich to Milan, then a high-speed Frecciarossa to Rome Termini.

You will thank me for this! Train EC8 from Zurich & Basel to Cologne & Hamburg conveys a wonderful Swiss 1st class panorama car, see the Rails Down the Rhine video. Speeding along the Rhine in this is a real treat, yet all you need to sit in it is a 1st class ticket.

It has couchette cars with 4 & 6 berth compartments & ordinary seats. The sleeper attendant can serve drinks, snacks & light meals from a room service menu.

Take the Hungarian EuroNight if you need to be in Vienna early, but otherwise I'd stick with the Nightjet as this has higher quality cars with the option of deluxe sleepers with shower & toilet & a more extensive breakfast.\n\nTip: You can check the consist for this train, check car numbers & see in what order cars for different destinations are marshalled using www.vagonweb.cz. Change cs to English upper left, click Train formations, scroll to Switzerland, click nj & look for NJ467.\n\nTip: Booking through from any Swiss station to Vienna (for example, from Geneva, Bern or Lucerne to Vienna) includes the Swiss domestic part of the journey often for little more than a Zurich to Vienna ticket. This saves money over buying a separate Swiss domestic ticket.\n\nOption 2, Zurich to Innsbruck, Salzburg, Linz & Vienna by railjet train through the Arlberg Pass - the scenic daytime option\n\nRailjet trains leave Zurich HB for Innsbruck (3h36), Salzburg Hbf (5h23), Linz (6h34) & Vienna Hbf (7h52) at 06:40, 10:40, 12:40, 14:40 & 16:40.\n\nThese swish railjet trains have a restaurant car, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi, treat this as a chill-out day, especially if you splurge on business class, a real treat. Railjets travel at up to 230 km/h (143 mph) on new sections of line, and at lower speed on the classic lines, which account for the vast majority of this route. They roll past the Zürichsee and along the Walensee, pass non-stop through a corner of Lichtenstein, then travel through the Arlberg pass into the Austrian Tirol with some superb mountain scenery. Watch the Arlberg Pass video to see for yourself & see the Arlberg Railway page.\n\nThere's also a 08:40 EuroCity train (the Transalpin) to Innsbruck & Graz, and an 18:40 railjet to Innsbruck.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nZurich to Innsbruck starts at 19.90 in economy, 44.90 in 1st class or 59.90 in business class (premium 1st).\n\nZurich to Salzburg starts at 29.90 in economy, 44.90 in 1st class or 59.90 in business class.\n\nZurich to Linz or Vienna starts at 39.90 in economy, 54.90 in 1st class or 69.90 in business class.\n\nZurich to Hallstatt with a change at Stainach-Irdning starts at 39.90 in economy, 54.90 1st class or 69.90 business class.\n\nFares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nBuy tickets from almost any Swiss station to almost any Austrian station at www.thetrainline.com (easy to use, in CHF, , £ or $, overseas credit cards no problem, small booking fee) or the Austrian Railways website www.oebb.at (in , same fares).\n\nIf you want business class (premium 1st class), select 1st class then look for the +15 business class reservation.\n\nBooking opens up to 6 months ahead, you print your own ticket.\n\nGeneva or Lucerne to Salzburg or Vienna might cost only 10 more than a Zurich-Salzburg or Zurich-Vienna ticket, saving a fortune over buying an expensive Swiss domestic ticket separately for the Geneva or Lucerne to Zurich leg. Remember that before you try and use a Swiss railpass for the Swiss part of the journey too, that expensive railpass might only be saving you 10!\n\nTip: 1st class panorama car on the 08:40 from Zurich to Innsbruck & Graz.\n\nMost daytime trains from Zurich through the Arlberg Pass to Innsbruck & beyond are modern railjets as shown below, but the 08:40 from Zurich to Innsbruck & Graz is the Transalpin, an older EuroCity (EC) train with conventional Austrian cars & restaurant car like the ones shown here. It also has a superb Swiss Railways 1st class panorama car, see the photos here.\n\nAnyone with a 1st class ticket or railpass can use the panorama car, but you should reserve a seat for 3. If you have a 1st class ticket, reserve a seat in the panorama car as explained here. You can make a reservation this way even if you already have a ticket or Interrail or Eurail pass.\n\nSwiss lakes: Soon after leaving Zurich, the railjet runs alongside the shore of the Zürichsee and then the Walensee.\n\nArlberg Pass: Above, we're now in Austria, with brooding skies over the Arlberg pass. The pass itself is long, narrow and curvaceous with the train snaking along the valley sides, often high above the valley floor.\n\nArlberg Tunnel: Between Bludenz and St Anton am Arlberg the train passes through the Arlberg Tunnel, 6.2 km (6.3 miles) long and opened in 1884. See en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlberg_Railway_Tunnel.\n\nRiver Inn: Running alongside the river Inn in the Tirol, somewhere between Landeck & Ötzal.\n\nMountains near Innsbruck. The train calls at Innsbruck Hbf for several minutes.\n\nKufstein: The train stops at Kufstein, where the castle towers above the station. Above right, lunch is served. In first & business class on a railjet, the steward takes your order & serves lunch at your seat.\n\nCutting across Germany: East of Kufstein, the train takes a short cut through Germany without stopping, see the route map here. All fast Vienna-Salzburg-Innsbruck trains do this, they're still considered Austrian domestic trains even though this short cut means they spend an hour on German territory! Such a train is called a Korridorzug. The train crosses back into Au"
