        "text": "The city of Basel decreed in the sixteenth century that the houses in the villages had to be built in rows.\n\nFrom 1500 until 1833 (when Basel was split into the cantons of Basel-Stadt and Basel-Landschaft), the city of Basel governed the villages in Baselbiet in the present-day canton of Basel-Landschaft. Steep gable roofs with house entrances facing the street are characteristic of the residential buildings in these village centres, the co-called Baselbieter Wohnhäuser.\n\nThe usual plan was the two-room concept with a kitchen and living and sleeping area, the Stube. Sometimes, there was a corridor, a cellar or, rarely, an additional room. The family slept in the Stube. The barn consisted of a threshing floor, which was flanked by two stables\n\nThis type of house combined the living rooms and the agricultural spaces under one roof. There is sometimes still a barn with a threshing floor and a stable between the houses. However, most rooms have been converted into living rooms since 1970.\n\nMost houses consisted of wood with thatched roofs until the seventeenth century. From the 18th century onwards, these houses were built in stone with tiled roofs.\n\nThe urban, monumental image of most villages around Basel bears witness to this.\n\n(Source: www.reigoldswil.ch).\n\nRoad Traffic between Engadin (Canton of Graubünden) and Tirano in the Valtellina (Veltin, Italy) has a long tradition.\n\nFor centuries, horses, stagecoaches and sledges were the means of transport to cross the Bernina Pass. The travelling time was at least nine hours in the summer. It was almost impossible and dangerous to cross the Bernina Pass in the winter.\n\nThe new road over the Bernina Pass opened in 1864/65. Travellers could reach Tirano from St. Moritz/Samedan and vice versa more comfortably by stagecoach.\n\nThe idea of building a railway to promote the transport of goods and tourism came up. The Upper Engadine (Sils (Maria), St. Moritz) also saw the Bernina railway positively.\n\nThe Bernina-Bahngesellschaft (Bernina Railway Company) was founded on 15 September 1905 in Basel to connect St. Moritz to Tirano via the Bernina Pass and vice versa.\n\nThe communes, which the railway line connected, organised referendums because the citizens had to agree. They approved the project by a large majority.\n\nThe railway opened on 5 July 1910, and the train connects St. Moritz and Tirano ever since. The railway was intended for use in summer. In 1913/14, however, travel also began in the winter months.\n\nThe Rhaetian Railway Company (die Rhätische Bahn) is the present-day owner of the Bernina Express and celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Bernina Railway in 2010. The Bernina Railway is on the World Heritage List of UNESCO since 2008.\n\n(Source: www.berninabahn.ch).\n\nIn 1893, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1939) learnt a relatively unknown sport: skiing. Two ski pioneers, Tobias and Johannes Branger, showed him how.\n\nOne year after the Branger brothers had conquered the route from Davos to Arosa over the Maienfelder Furgga for the first time on 23 March 1893, they repeated this trip with Sir Arthur in 1894.\n\nHis account of this legendary trip in the “Strand Magazine” magazine in December 1894 was the first English report of a skiing experience. The response was overwhelming. Sir Arthur laid the foundation for the ski boom in Davos (and Switzerland).\n\nThe text on the monument reads as follows:\n\n(Quelle: www.davos.ch).\n\n“In Tribute to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930). English author-creator of Sherlock Holmes and sportsman, who on March 23, 1894, crossed the Maienfelder Furka from Davos to Arosa, thereby bringing this new sport and the attractions of the Swiss Alps in Winter to the attention of the world. The perfect pattern of a gentleman”."
