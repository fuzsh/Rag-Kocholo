        "text": "edit\n\nBrief History\n\nThe Liechtenstein dynasty is an old royal family, which is linked to the castle Liechtenstein that can be found in Austria. But the family wanted to obtain more power, and started to acquire pieces of land (Mainly within the Habsburgs Empire). The Liechtensteins wanted to have land that was not within somebody else’s empire. In 1699 they could finally buy a piece of land, the small “Herrschaft” of Schellenburg, that was not owned by anybody, and only had the Holy Roman Emperor as a supreme ruler. 13 years later they also bought the county of Vaduz. Both pieces of land were bought from the Hohenems.\n\nIn 1719, on January the 23rd the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles VI, signed a decreed that Schellenburg and Vaduz were to be united to become the Principality of Liechtenstein, with Anton Florian becoming the first Prince of Liechtenstein. By this act Liechtenstein became an independent member state of the Holy Roman Empire, a situation that lasted until 1806 when the Holy Roman Empire seized to excist due to the Napoleonic wars. After the rule of Napoleon, and his defeat a few years later, new borders were drawn up in Central Europe and Liechtenstein became a member of the German Confederation, which was governed by the Emperor of Austria.\n\nDespite being the rulers of the country, the first visit of any of the Princes of Liechtenstein to the country had to wait until 1842. In 1861 the Saving and Loans Bank was opened. Something that would result in a profitable type of trade for Liechtenstein in the future.\n\nUntil the end of World War I, and the fall of the Austrian Empire, Liechtenstein had close ties to Austria. The main reason for this was that the Liechtensteins were still living in Austria. At the end of the war, the financial situation in Austria forced Liechtenstein to enter a monetary and customs union with Switzerland.\n\nDuring World War II Liechtenstein was able to remain neutral, but the family lost the properties that they had possessed in Poland and Czechoslovakia. Until the “Anschluss” the princes had lived in Vienna, but then moved to Vaduz. The seizing of most of their land in Czechoslovakia lead to the situation that Liechtenstein did not have official relationship with that country during the cold war, and still does not have any official international relationships with either the Czech Republic or Slovakia. After the war the family on a regular bases sold pieces of art, to get the country back on track. Since the war Liechtenstein has raised it’s living standards dramatically, which is mainly because of the low tax rates businesses enjoy in Liechtenstein, which results in there being more companies than citizens in the country.\n\nLiechtenstein joined the Schengen Area on 19 December 2011.\n\nedit\n\nGeography\n\nOne of only two doubly-landlocked countries in the world (the other is Uzbekistan), Liechtenstein is a very mountainous country. The highest point, at 2599 metres, is the Grauspitz. Liechtenstein is the sixth smallest nation in Europe. Measured from north to south, the country is only about 24 kilometres long. Liechtenstein shares international borders with Switzerland and Austria. The border with Switzerland follows the Rhine river.\n\nLiechtenstein is situated in the Upper Rhine valley of the European Alps and is bordered to the east by Austria and to the south and west by Switzerland. The entire western border of Liechtenstein is formed by the Rhine. New surveys using more accurate measurements of the country's borders in 2006 have set its area at 160 km2, with borders of 77.9 kilometres. Thus, Liechtenstein discovered in 2006 that its borders are 1.9 kilometres longer than previously thought.\n\nedit\n\nRegions\n\nLiechtenstein is made up of 11 municipalities, known as gemeinden, which usually consist of a single town. These municipalities are grouped into two counties, the Unterland (lower county) and Oberland (upper county).\n\nedit\n\nEvents and Festivals\n\nOperettas in Vaduz/Balzers\n\nRotating between cities each year, the Liechtenstein Operettas is a three month opera celebration. The festivals are held either in Balzers or Vaduz and generally last from the end of January through the middle of March.\n\nMonster Concert\n\nHeld in the town of Schaan during the month of March, the Monster Concert is one of the annual Fasching events, and has rocked since 1958. Music is played and dancing in the streets is the norm, with thousands of visitors adding to the spectacle every year.\n\nTreisenberg Spring\n\nTaking place over a weekend at the end of March, the Treisenberg Spring festival is a celebration of the coming warm season in Liechtenstein. Classical music is used to entertain the masses and amazing rhythms can be heard echoing throughout the township, keeping alive the golden oldies from the likes of Bach, Wendling and Telemann.\n\nBargar-Fruahlig-Mountain Spring\n\nAfter a long winter, visitors celebrate the coming warmth at the traditional Treisenberg Spring festival in April and May. However, the event is more about cuisine than music, with local restaurants, Café Guflina and Restaurant Kainer, offering a magnificent selection of spring foods.\n\nLGT Alpine Marathon\n\nThe annual LGT Alpine Marathon is one of the most exciting sporting events on the Liechtenstein calendar. On June 16, runners from around Europe and the UK flock to Bendern for 42 kms of excitement. Most of the course is at an altitude of about 5900 feet.\n\nFilm Festival Vaduz\n\nFor two weeks in July, Vaduz turns on the charm when it hosts its annual film festival. Flicks from around Liechtenstein, Europe, and other parts of the globe are screened, mostly in beautiful open air cinemas around the capital.\n\nNational Day of Liechtenstein\n\nHeld on August 15, National Day of Liechtenstein is celebrated across the country. Musical events, parades, dance performances, games, and traditional cuisine are the center of attention until 10:00 p.m. when fireworks light up the sky near Vaduz Castle.\n\nLiechtenstein Guitar Days\n\nThis weeklong festival held in July, brings the best guitar players from around the country and Europe to Eschen. An international competition is what attracts the most visitors, but there are also plenty of workshops and concerts.\n\nedit\n\nWeather\n\nLiechtenstein has warm summers and cold winters. Temperatures in summer from June to September are generally between 22 °C and 25 °C, sometimes with days over 30 °C possible. Nights are pleasantly, around 14 °C. This applies to the lower areas though, up in the mountains it is (much) cooler. Winters are around zero with frost at night, and cold conditions in the moutains where snow falls much of the winter and temperatures can plummit way below -20 °C. Most of the rain falls during the summer season with sometimes very heavy showers and thunderstorms.\n\nedit\n\nGetting There\n\nBy Plane\n\nThere is no airport in Liechtenstein. The nearest large airport is in Zürich, Switzerland. A smaller airport can be found in Friedrichshafen on the shores of Lake Konstanz in Germany\n\nBy Train\n\nÖBB, the Austrian federal railway company, runs a limited service from Buchs SG station in Switzerland, via Schaan-Vaduz station (near Schaan) to Feldkirch in Austria. Trains only run a few times a day, which makes buses generally more convenient.\n\nBuses run every 15 minutes from the train station at Buchs (the main Swiss town on the Liechtenstein border) to Schaan and Vaduz. Tickets can be purchased on the bus for CHF3.40 and it only takes about 10 minutes to Schaan and another 5 to Vaduz.\n\nIf coming by rail from Switzerland, it may be quicker and cheaper to take the train as far as Sargans, from where it's possible to catch a bus (see below) straight to Vaduz.\n\nBy Car\n\nLiechtenstein shares borders with Austria and Switzerland and good tarred roads lead into those countries from a number of places.\n\nBy Bus\n\nLBA has buses to Feldkirch in Austria and to Sargans and Buchs in Switzerland.\n\nedit\n\nGetting Around\n\nBy Car\n\nRoads in Liechtenstein are in excellent condition. Many international as well as local firms have offices, mainly in and near the capital Vaduz. Traffic drives on the right and you need your national driver's licence to rent a car.\n\nBy Bus\n\nLBA is the only company offering comfortable bus travel around the country. It is well organised, but services are less during the evening and on Sundays. A 7-day pass costs only about 10 Swiss francs, about 8 US dollars or €6.\n\nBy Bike\n\nA great way to explore Liechtenstein is by bike as distances are small and several parts even have bike lanes. Some roads can be steep though, especially in the southeast. Bikes can be rented in most towns.\n\nedit\n\nRed Tape\n\nLiechtenstein is a member of the Schengen Agreement.\n\nLiechtenstein is not a member of the EU. Therefore, travellers entering Liechtenstein from Austria (and vice versa) are subject to non-systematic customs controls. There have been no immigration controls since Liechtenstein joined the Schengen Area on 19 December 2011.\n\nLiechtenstein maintains a complete customs union with Switzerland and is represented by Switzerland in embassies internationally. Since 1923 there have been no border formalities needed for crossing between the two countries. In essence there is nothing more than a sign announcing your arrival in Switzerland or Liechtenstein (when you cross the Rhine or the land border), similar to the situation at smaller border crossings in many EU nations (e.g., Austria, Germany, France, Italy).\n\nedit\n\nMoney\n\nSee also: Money Matters\n\nLiechtenstein uses the Swiss Franc (CHF). One franc is divided into 100 centimes (French) (German: Rappen). Banknotes come in denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 1000 francs. Coins come as 5, 10 and 20 centimes and 1/2, 1, 2 and 5 francs.\n\nLiechtenstein also accepts Euro as currency but the balance amount will be returned in CHF only. Tourists are advised to keep this in mind while paying by cash.\n\nedit\n\nWork\n\nFinding work in Liechtenstein is difficult. A majority of non-nationals working in the Principality are Swiss, with a smaller number of Austrians and Germans. Liechtenstein is not a member of the European Union, so the government has no obligation to let nationals of EU member states work and live in the country.\n\nedit\n\nStudy\n\nLiechtenstein's university offers courses only in technical sciences. Without either Liechtenstein/Swiss or EU citizenship, a large bank balance and a fluency in German, it is unlikely to interest visitors.\n\nedit\n\nLanguage\n\nSee also: German Phrasebook\n\nThe official language of Liechtenstein is German, with most people speaking a dialect, but standard German will be understood by everybody.\n\nIf you want to practise some German before visiting Liechtenstein, you can take a look at the German Phrasebook on this travel guide.\n\nedit\n\nEat\n\nYou will find a few restaurants in the larger cities of Liechtenstein. The many small bakeries are a great place to get a warm, fresh roll or pastry.\n\nedit\n\nSleep\n\nThere are a few hotels in Liechtenstein, but they tend to run on the expensive side. There is one youth hostel located in Schaan, but it closes for the winter. You will probably be able to find cheaper accommodation in neighboring Feldkirch, Austria.\n\nCamping Mittagspitz is the only full-service campsite in the Principality. It offers excellent facilities, a friendly reception and a fabulous reasonably priced restaurant. There are three other campgrounds in Liechtenstein. One in Bendern, one in Vaduz, and one in Triesen. All are pretty much full year round.\n\nedit\n\nDrink\n\nThere is a small amount of wine that is produced in Liechtenstein that is available in supermarkets and tourist shops throughout the country. Expect to pay around CHF25 for an average bottle. The Prince even owns his own vineyard in Vaduz, off the main road. Beer is also available for purchase that is made with malt from Liechtenstein, although most of the beer itself is brewed in Switzerland. A variety of other European wines, beers, and soft drinks are also available. There is now a brewery in Liechtenstein that produces a variety of beers; lagers including Helles (blonde) and Hefe Weizen (unfiltered wheat) styles are brewed.\n\nThere is also a one-man distillery in Triesen who makes liquors and schnapps from fruits. Tours on Saturdays.\n\nedit\n\nHealth\n\nSee also: Travel Health\n\nThere are no vaccinations legally required to travel to Liechtenstein. It is recommended to have a vaccination against tick borne encephalitis when you go hiking and/or camping for 4 weeks or more in the period of March to November.\n\nedit\n\nSafety\n\nSee also: Travel Safety\n\nLiechtenstein is probably one of the safest countries in the world. Just take the normal precautions when going out hiking, driving on the road and leave your valuables out of sight in the car. Few people will have any problems visiting the country."
