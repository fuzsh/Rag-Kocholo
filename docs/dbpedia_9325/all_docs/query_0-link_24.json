        "text": "The Sarganserland is a constituency (Wahlkreis) of the canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland, with a population of 36,892 (as of 2008).\n\nThe constituency corresponds to the historical county of Sargans (13th to 15th century) and the later Landvogtei Sargans in the Old Swiss Confederacy (15th to 18th century). Part of the Canton of Linth in the Helvetic Republic, the Sarganserland together with Pfäfers was joined to the canton of St. Gallen at its formation in 1803. Geographically, it includes the land between the Rhine at Sargans (the tripoint of St. Gallen, Grisons and Liechtenstein) and upper Lake Walen, including the Seeztal. The territory of Pfäfers lies along the Tamina, in the Rhine basin, and was not historically part of Sargans county but was independently owned by Pfäfers Abbey, and had been joined to the canton of Linth in 1798."
