        "text": "Things You Need to Know about Liechtenstein\n\nGeneral:\n\nLiechtenstein's borders/customs are controlled by Switzerland, so if you are arriving from Zurich, you won't have to go through passport control. But bring your passport and stop by a souvenir shop for a stamp [insert price here]! Like Switzerland, Liechtenstein is not part of the European Union but is in the Schengen Area. Starting in 2024 you will have to fill out an ETIAS application to enter the EU if you’re traveling from a visa-free country. It costs 7EUR and you will need your passport to fill out the application.\n\nMoney stuff:\n\nLiechtenstein is about as pricey as Switzerland. They also use the Swiss Franc (CHF) as their currency. We paid by credit card for everything while we were here, so make sure you have at least one credit card with no foreign transaction fees!\n\nMajor cities:\n\nThe capital of Liechtenstein is Vaduz. The largest city, Schaan has a whopping population of 5,700 people! Other notable cities are Triesen and Balzers.\n\nSafety:\n\nI felt very safe in Liechtenstein. It actually has one of the lowest crime rates in the world!\n\nLanguages:\n\nGerman is the official language, but we had no problem speaking English wherever we went.\n\nHow to get from Zurich to Liechtenstein\n\nIf you chose to go take your Zurich to Liechtenstein day trip by train, it will take you about 90 minutes from Zurich HB. Unless you are renting a car for the whole trip, I recommend taking a train! You will take the train all the way to Sargans. There you will hop on a bus and head off into Liechtenstein! The trains run frequently between Zurich and Sargans, and there are several buses between Sargans and Vaduz that run all day as well. I used Google Maps to check times for both the buses and trains. Alternatively, book your tickets online to save time!\n\nWhere to Stay in Liechtenstein\n\nWe only went to Liechtenstein for the day, but if you want to stay in Liechtenstein you totally can.\n\nThere are some hotels in Vaduz, and there are several ski lodges in the southern part of Liechtenstein. You could do a Zurich to Liechtenstein day trip for some good skiing in the winter!\n\nLuxury: Park Hotel Sonnenhof\n\nMid Range: Hotel Oberland\n\nBudget:Hotel Dux\n\nI have not personally stayed at these hotels, so you might want to do some additional research on your own!\n\nZurich to Liechtenstein Day Trip Itinerary\n\nNow onto the good part: what to do on your Liechtenstein day trip! Liechtenstein is known for its beautiful mountains, medieval castles, and museums.\n\nStop in Balzers\n\nOnce you've gotten on the bus, you want to stop in Balzers to see Gutenberg Castle. If you get off at the Balzers Schlossweg stop, you'll be right at the castle, where you can hike up for an amazing view of the countryside. You can take a tour of the castle (it was unfortunately closed when we went).\n\nTo get an amazing photo of the castle, head to the Balzers Gagoz bus stop. Unfortunately, I didn't see the stop until we were headed back to Zurich, but it is by far the best view of the castle from afar!\n\nYou will need to get back on a bus to go to Vaduz. The stop that takes you to the heart of Vaduz is the Post stop.\n\nIf you keep walking up Franz Josef Strasse, you will eventually reach Vaduz Castle! There is definitely a better way to get there than the way we went, but we ended up on a one-lane road with cars coming at us. Eventually, we reached the Schlosssweg trail, so if you want to avoid the cars, double back down Mitteldorf until you find the trail.\n\nYou can't go inside Vaduz Castle because the Prince of Liechtenstein lives there! We took some awesome photos of it from the outside, and there are plenty of good angles for it. There's even a hiking trail that leads further up the hill if you want to keep hiking after taking some photos of the castle.\n\nVisit a Museum\n\nAfter your hike to Vaduz Castle, head to one of the many museums in the main square in Vaduz. You could go to the Liechtenstein National Museum, Postal Museum, Kunstmusuem Liechtenstein (art museum), Schatzkammer Liechtenstein (Treasure Museum), and so many more. We went to the National Museum and I really liked it!\n\nAt this point, you will have come full circle and should be close to the Post bus stop again. You can get on a bus back to Sargans and from there a train back to Zurich. Your Zurich to Liechtenstein day trip will be complete!\n\nFinal Thoughts on Zurich to Liechtenstein Day Trip Itinerary\n\nLiechtenstein is a great place to visit if you are anxious or highly sensitive because it is clean, safe, and quiet. A Zurich to Liechtenstein day trip should definitely be included on a One Week Switzerland Itinerary. With just a short train trip between Zurich and Liechtenstein, you can easily see the country in one day.\n\nDid you like this post?
