Information current for 2024.\n\nGoing from Linz? All trains from Vienna westwards to Salzburg, Innsbruck, Germany & Switzerland call at Linz around 1h15 after leaving Vienna, you can pick up these trains there. Eastbound, travel to Vienna and use the information below.\n\nBefore you buy your tickets\n\nTake a moment to read these tips for buying European train tickets. They answer all the usual questions, \"Do I need to book in advance or can I buy at the station?\", \"Can I stop off?\", \"Are there Senior fares?\" and that old favourite, \"Should I buy an $800 railpass or 35 point-to-point ticket?\". How far ahead can you buy train tickets?\n\nEuropean train travel FAQ\n\nWhich station in Vienna?\n\nVienna Hauptbahnhof is Vienna's modern central station, opened in 2015. All long-distance & international trains now use this station. See Vienna Hbf station guide.\n\nVienna Meidling: Many trains call at Vienna Meidling before or after calling at Vienna Hbf. See station guide.\n\nVienna Westbahnhof is a terminus, once one of Vienna's major stations, now relegated to secondary status by Vienna Hbf. It's now only served by regional trains & the privately-run Westbahn trains to Salzburg & Munich. See station guide.\n\nVienna Franz Josefs Bahnhof is a small terminus for regional trains. You're only likely to use it if heading for Cesky Krumlov in the Czech Republic. See station guide.\n\nVienna to Salzburg\n\nSee the Vienna to Salzburg page.\n\nVienna to Innsbruck, Linz, Graz & other destinations in Austria\n\nYou can buy Austrian Railways ÖBB tickets online at www.thetrainline.com which is quick, easy, international credit cards accepted and it has the advantage over oebb.at that it book both ÖBB and Westbahn trains on the Vienna - Linz - Salzburg route. There's a small booking fee.\n\nAlternatively, ÖBB's (Austrian Federal Railways) own website is www.oebb.at.\n\nWhichever site you use, you print your own ticket or for Austrian domestic journeys you can show it on your phone.\n\nSeat reservation is optional on Austrian internal trains, you can just turn up, buy a standard price ticket at the station, hop on the next train and sit where you like. Trains cannot sell out. But to be 100% sure of a reserved seat on a specific train you can make an optional seat reservation on InterCity, EuroCity and railjet trains for around 3 per seat. And for cheaper tickets, book in advance.\n\nAdvance-purchase Sparschiene fares\n\nÖBB introduced dynamic pricing in 2011, which means you can save money if you book a Sparschiene (saver) fare in advance and commit to a specific train on a limited-or-no-refunds, no-changes-to-travel-plans basis. ÖBB's Sparschiene fares between Austrian cities start from 9.90 upwards and vary with demand and according to how far ahead you book.\n\nVienna to Innsbruck by competing Westbahn trains\n\nIn December 2022, open-access operator Westbahn extended several of its Vienna-Salzburg double-deck trains to Innsbruck in competition with ÖBB's railjets. There are now up to 5 Westbahn trains per day between Vienna and Innsbruck. You can see & compare both Westbahn and ÖBB prices at www.thetrainline.com.\n\nVienna to Hallstatt\n\nOption 1, Vienna to Hallstatt - the direct route\n\nYou can travel from Vienna Hbf to Hallstatt station in as little as 3h18 with one easy change at Attnang-Puchheim. There's a departure at least every hour, fares start at only 19.90 if you pre-book, that's a cheap Sparschiene fare, specified train only, no refunds, no changes.\n\nIf you buy at the station on the day a full-flex Standardpreis ticket costs 59.50 on ÖBB trains. Full-flex tickets are good for any train that day and cannot sell out.\n\nYou can buy tickets at www.thetrainline.com, it's quick, easy, international credit cards accepted and it can book both ÖBB and Westbahn trains over the Vienna-Attnang Puchheim section. You print your own tickets.\n\nAlternatively, buy at ÖBB's (Austrian Federal Railways) own website www.oebb.at, in , same prices.\n\nThe train arrives at Hallstatt station (Hallstatt Bahnhof) on the east side of Halltstatt Lake (Hallstatter See). Hallstatt town is on the west side of the lake, so you need to take a small local ferry called the Stefanie from Hallstatt Bahnhof to Hallstatt town, this sails shortly after most train arrivals and takes 15-20 minutes, see www.hallstattschifffahrt.at for the timetable.\n\nYou pay for the ferry at the quayside before boarding, cash only, 3.50 per crossing, children under 4 free, children under 14 reduced fare.\n\nOption 2, Vienna to Hallstatt via the UNESCO-listed Semmering Railway - the scenic route\n\nThere's an alternative route between Vienna & Hallstatt that's worth the slight detour.\n\nÖBB charges exactly the same price - from 19.90 in advance, around 59.90 on the day - for both routes but the scenic option takes a bit longer - 4h06 rather than 3h18 - and it involves two changes of train not one, at Leoben Hbf & Stainach Irdning - although both changes of train are easy, just stepping off one train and walking to another.\n\nTo book this route, use www.thetrainline.com, click the green via button at lower right and add Leoben Hbf as a via station. It'll then route you over the lovely UNESCO-listed Semmering Railway (see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semmering_railway) and it's pretty much scenic all the way from Semmering to Hallstatt. Well worth the extra time!\n\nThe train arrives at Hallstatt Bahnhof (Hallstatt railway station) on the eastern shore of the Hallstatter See (Hallstatt Lake). Hallstatt town is on the western shore of the lake, so you need to take a ferry called the Stefanie from Hallstatt Bahnhof to Hallstatt town. This sails shortly after most train arrivals and takes 15-20 minutes, see www.hallstattschifffahrt.at for a timetable. You pay for the ferry separately at the quayside before boarding.\n\nRailjet, Austria's premier train\n\nRailjets link Vienna, Linz, Salzburg & Innsbruck, and Vienna & Graz, as well as running internationally from Vienna to Venice, Zurich, Prague, Budapest.\n\nBack to top\n\nVienna to London\n\nSee the London to Austria page for times, fares & how to buy tickets, in either direction.\n\nBack to top\n\nVienna to Paris from 49.90\n\nOption 1, Vienna to Paris by Nightjet sleeper train, 3 times a week - the safe, comfortable, time-effective option\n\nA Nightjet sleeper train leaves Vienna Hbf at 19:38 on Mondays, Wednesdays & Fridays & Linz at 21:04, arriving Paris Gare de l'Est 10:24.\n\nImportant update 2024: ÖBB have given up trying to run this train from 12 August to 25 October 2024, due to the amount of trackwork.\n\nThis comfortable Austrian Nightjet sleeper train has two air-conditioned Comfortline sleeping-cars each with nine 1, 2 & 3-berth standard compartments with washbasin and three 1, 2 or 3-berth deluxe compartments with shower & toilet.

Hotels near Paris Gare de l'Est with good reviews include the Libertel Gare de l'Est Français (opposite the station, 3-star); Libertel Gare du Nord Suede (350m from the station, 2-star), OKKO Hotels Paris Gare de l'Est (2-star).\n\nTransfer by taxi or metro from the Gare de l'Est to the relevant Paris station for your onward train (or walk, if going to Paris Nord). If making a same-day connection across Paris always allow at least 60 minutes between trains, ideally more.

For the best river views, sit on the left hand side when going west from Koblenz (the train leaves Koblenz station heading north before turning west).\n\nThe fare is 31.50 in 2nd class or 53.40 in 1st class, fixed price, always available.\n\nBuy this ticket at the German Railways website int.bahn.de.\n\nOption 2, Vienna to Luxembourg by daytime trains\n\nYou can travel from Vienna to Luxembourg in a single day with just 1 change at Koblenz - these are the ones to go for:\n\nLeave Vienna Hbf at 09:13, change at Koblenz Hbf, arrive Luxembourg 20:23.\n\nLeave Vienna Hbf at 11:13, change at Koblenz Hbf, arrive Luxembourg 21:29.\n\nLeave Vienna Hbf at 13:13, change at Koblenz Hbf, arrive Luxembourg 00:34.\n\nYou travel from Vienna to Koblenz by superb ICE-T train with restaurant car, power sockets at all seats & free WiFi.\n\nThis train travels along the Rhine Valley from Mainz to Koblenz, past vineyards, river boats, castles and the legendary Lorelei Rock, it's worth making sure you do this bit in daylight.

Railjets travel at up to 230 km/h (143 mph) on new sections of line, and at lower speed on the classic lines, which account for the vast majority of this route. They call at Linz, Salzburg and Innsbruck, then travel through the Arlberg pass, clipping a corner of Lichtenstein before running alongside the Walensee & Zürichsee lakes into Zurich. The Arlberg offers some superb scenery, watch the Arlberg Pass video & see the Arlberg Railway page. It's worth checking sunset times for your date of travel and making sure you do the Innsbruck-Zurich bit in daylight.\n\nChange at Zurich HB for onward Swiss trains to anywhere in Switzerland.\n\nFares start at 39.90 in 2nd class, 54.90 1st class or 69.90 business class (=premium 1st class).\n\nFares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nBuy tickets from Vienna to almost any Swiss station at www.thetrainline.com (easy to use, in , £ or $, overseas credit cards no problem, small booking fee) or the Austrian Railways website www.oebb.at (in , same fares).\n\nBooking opens up to 6 months ahead. You print your own ticket.\n\nGoing beyond Zurich, for example to Geneva, Bern, Zermatt, Lucerne, Wengen?\n\nwww.thetrainline.com and www.oebb.at can sell you a through ticket between Vienna and almost any town or city in Switzerland (in either direction) for one inclusive price. You'll often find that this costs the same as (or only a little more than) a ticket to Zurich!\n\nIncidentally, I get a lot of people who think they will save money by using their Swiss Pass for the Swiss part of the journey. But if (let's say) Thetrainline.com gives you a price of 39.90 from Vienna to Zurich and exactly the same price from Vienna to Lucerne (as budget train fares are no more based on distance than budget air fares), then using up an expensive day on a Swiss Pass to cover the Zurich-Lucerne part of the trip is potentially saving you a big fat zero! So check prices before wasting a Swiss Pass day.\n\nCrossing the Salzach at Salzburg: View of the Fortress Hohensalzburg on the left hand side as the railjet crosses the river after leaving Salzburg Hbf.\n\nCutting across Germany: From Salzburg to Kufstein the train takes a short cut through Germany without stopping, see the route map here. All fast Vienna-Salzburg-Innsbruck trains do this, they're still considered Austrian domestic trains even they spend an hour on German territory! Such a train is called a Korridorzug.\n\nKufstein: The train stops at Kufstein, where the castle towers above the station.\n\nAbove right, lunch is served. In railjet first & business class, the steward takes your order & serves lunch at your seat.\n\nMountains near Innsbruck. The train calls briefly at Innsbruck Hbf.\n\nRiver Inn: Running alongside the river Inn in the Tirol, somewhere between Ötzal & Landeck.\n\nArlberg Pass: Above, brooding skies over the Arlberg pass. The pass itself is long, narrow and curvaceous with the train snaking along the valley sides, often high above the valley floor.\n\nArlberg Tunnel: Between St Anton am Arlberg & Bludenz the train passes through the Arlberg Tunnel, 6.2 km (6.3 miles) long and opened in 1884. See en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlberg_Railway_Tunnel.\n\nSwiss lakes: Between Sargans & Zurich the railjet runs alongside the shore of the Walensee and then the Zürichsee.\n\nOption 2, Vienna to Zurich by Nightjet sleeper train - the comfortable & time-effective option that saves a hotel bill\n\nAn excellent nightjet sleeper train leaves Vienna Hbf at 21:39 every day and arrives Zurich HB at 08:20 next morning.\n\nThis comfortable Austrian Nightjet sleeper train has two air-conditioned double-deck sleeping-cars with compact 1 & 2 bed compartments with washbasin, four larger 1 & 2 bed deluxe compartments with shower & toilet, and several 3-berth compartments with washbasin.

See here.\n\nTip: In the search results you'll see a second sleeper train leaving Vienna around 23:25 and also arriving 08:20. This is the Hungarian EuroNight (EN) sleeper train from Budapest to Zurich which gets combined with the Vienna-Zurich Nightjet (NJ) in Salzburg. By all means take this if you need to be in Vienna until late, but otherwise I'd stick with the Austrian Nightjet leaving 21:39 as this has higher quality cars, the option of deluxe sleepers with shower & toilet & a better breakfast.\n\nTip: You can check the train formation, check car numbers & see in what order cars for different destinations are marshalled using www.vagonweb.cz.

And you get to experience a new generation Nightjet. The inexpensive privacy of the new-generation mini cabins is reason enough on its own!\n\nStep 1, travel from Vienna to Feldkirch by new generation Nightjet, leaving Vienna Hbf at 22:55 or Vienna Meidling 23:03, arriving Feldkirch 07:49.\n\nThis modern sleeper train offers 1 & 2 bed sleepers all with shower & toilet, 4-berth comfort couchettes, individual mini cabins and ordinary seats, see the new generation Nightjet page for a guide to on-board accommodation, travel tips & photos.

In fact, I'd be tempted to book the later 16:26, 17:26 or 18:26 Frecciarossa and have a quick scoot to the Rialto Bridge & Piazza San Marco between trains.\n\nVenice to Florence starts at 19.90 in 2nd class, 29.90 1st class.\n\nVenice to Rome or Naples starts at 29.90 in 2nd class, 39.90 1st class.\n\nFares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nBook this train at www.thetrainline.com (keeping all your bookings together in one place) or at www.italiarail.com (easy to use, the small booking fee will be refunded if you email them at seat61@italiarail.com afterwards) or Italian Railways' own website www.trenitalia.com (requires Italian-language place names, read this advice on using it first).

A journey from Vienna to Florence, Rome or Naples should have no more than 2 changes. If a journey you find this way suits you, go ahead and buy. If not, or if no journeys appear, read on...\n\nHow to buy tickets, advanced\n\nTo buy tickets with more control so you can ensure robust connections, or if no journeys appear when you try booking all in one go, split the booking.\n\nFirst use either www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com or the Austrian Railways website www.oebb.at to book from Vienna to the interchange point in Italy, either Verona Porta Nuova or (on the 1st & 3rd trains of the day) Bologna Centrale.\n\nThen book the onward Italian train separately. I'd allow at least 40 minutes in Verona or Bologna between trains. You can book it at www.raileurope.com or www.thetrainline.com to keep all your bookings together in one place, or to avoid the small booking fee, at www.italiarail.com (easy to use, recognises English place names, the small booking fee will be refunded if you email them at seat61@italiarail.com) or the Italian Railways website www.trenitalia.com (requires Italian language place names, see advice on using it).\n\nBack to top\n\nVienna to Trieste\n\nOption 1, Vienna to Trieste by EuroCity train\n\nA EuroCity train called the Emona leaves Vienna Hbf at 07:58 every day, arriving Trieste Centrale at 17:16.\n\nThe Emona has comfortable air-conditioned Austrian 1st & 2nd class cars, 1st class is open-plan seating, 2nd class offers a choice of open-plan saloon seating or classic 6-seat compartments.

South of Vienna the train travels over the UNESCO-listed Semmering Railway, a real treat, with more great scenery across the border in Slovenia along the beautiful River Sava. Between Ljubljana & Trieste you'll discover where Prosecco comes from as you pass through Prosecco station, closed to passengers since 2012, see the photo & account of the journey on the Ljubljana-Trieste page. And in my opinion, Trieste is one of Italy's most under-rated cities, along with Turin.\n\nTip: You can check the train formation, see carriage photos and view seating plans if you go to www.vagonweb.cz, select en top left for English, then click Train Formations and search for train EC 150 Emona westbound or EC 151 Emona eastbound.\n\nFares start at 29.90 in 2nd class or 80.90 in 1st class.\n\nFares vary like air fares, so book ahead.\n\nBuy tickets at www.thetrainline.com (easy to use, in , £ or $, overseas credit cards no problem, small booking fee) or Austrian Railways www.oebb.at (in , same prices).
