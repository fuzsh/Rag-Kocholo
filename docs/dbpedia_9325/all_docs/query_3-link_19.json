        "text": "Sargans is a centuries-old town surrounded by rugged peaks and rolling vineyards. As well as visiting one of the best-preserved castles in Switzerland, you can venture into the mountains on scenic hikes and descend underground to explore a historic iron mine.\n\nThings to do in Sargans\n\nOnce a seat for Roman counts and Swiss aristocrats, today Sargans Castle is one of the country’s most treasured national heritage sites. Approaching the hilltop stronghold, you’ll be impressed by the fortified stone walls and soaring defence towers. The Sarganserland Museum occupies the main tower and features exhibits on the rich history and heritage of the castle, as well as life in the Swiss countryside. After exploring the castle, enjoy lunch at the excellent on-site restaurant.\n\nSargans is a launchpad for outdoor adventures in the surrounding forests, mountains and vineyards. From family-friendly strolls to challenging summits, there are trails for every age and fitness level. The hike to the summit of 1,830-metre-high Gonzen rewards you with sweeping views over the Appenzell Alps and the Rhine Valley.\n\nTours of Gonzenbergwerk take you behind the scenes of a decommissioned iron mine. The mine is carved into the base of Gonzen and is criss-crossed with tunnels and passageways. Tours include a ride on the subterranean narrow-gauge railway.\n\nSargans is dotted with restaurants where you can enjoy traditional cuisine from the canton of St. Gallen. Try local specialties like “schüblig” pork sausage, “challerhocker” cheese, and fluffy white St. Gallen bread served with butter and jam.\n\nGetting around Sargans\n\nSargans is pedestrian-friendly and easy to get around on foot. The town is a one-hour drive from Zurich and 1.5 hours from Zurich Airport. Rental cars offer the freedom to explore surrounding sights and attractions at your own pace. Trains run between Sargans and Zurich in around one hour and also connect nearby cities like St. Gallen, Bellinzona and Chur."
