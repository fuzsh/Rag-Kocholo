        "text": "Asalem to Khalkhal Road\n\nUndoubtedly the mountainous Asalem to Khalkhal road is one of the most gorgeous Iranian roads bridging two provinces of Gilan and Ardabil together. When someone goes through this provoking motorway, he/she feels the paradise is under his feet. Asalem to Khalkhal Road is one of the most beautiful and spectacular road in Iran. It is a combination of two contradictory points; the highland forest and plain together. This 70-km-long road lies from the sea level to 3000 meters high, and purely depicts splendors of the motherland and its natural tourist attractions. The road is in fact a route lies inside green velvet textile of the countryside, goes up to the heaven where a carpet of fog is beautifying the scent of fresh flora and fauna. When someone gets lost in this real-life dream, it is the time that he feels regeneration inside. Interestingly, Asalem to Khalkhal road is one of the neglected Iran’s tourist attractions that most of the people are not aware of it.\n\nAnzali Lagoon\n\nAnzali Lagoon is a coastal liman, or lagoon, in the Caspian Sea near Bandar-e Anzali. The lagoon divides Bandar-e Anzali into two parts, and is home to both the Selke Wildlife Refuge and the Siahkesheem Marsh. Although the lagoon suffers from pollution, it is known as a good place for bird watching. The lagoon’s water ranges from fresh near the tributary streams to brackish near the mouth into the harbor and the sea. Studies indicate that in the 19th and early 20th centuries the lagoon had a much higher salinity. The lagoon has decreased in size since the 1930s to less than a quarter of its former extent. However, in the last ten years (as of 2007) water salinity has increased both by the rise of the level of the Caspian Sea which has caused greater interchange of waters, and due to greater salt transport in incoming “fresh” water due to increased upstream irrigation.\n\nQal’eh Roudkhan Castle\n\nRoudkhan Castle is a brick and stone medieval castle in Iran. Located 25 km southwest of Fouman city north of Iran in Gilan province, it is a military complex which had been constructed during the Seljuk Dynasty. The Castle is built on two tips of a mount, with an area of 50,000 square meters. Its architects have benefited from natural mountainous features in the construction of the fort. The Alborz and its northerly forests became impregnable fortresses for outlaws and sects such as the Ismailis that were seen by the Caliph as heretical. It cuts off a narrow spur to occupy the whole length of a precipitous ridge. Such a position could only be assaulted by trying to starve the defenders out.\n\nMasouleh Stepped Village\n\nAbout 1050 meters above sea level, where the air is thinner, cooler and less polluted there is the 1000-year-old mountain village of Masouleh located right up to a beautiful green valley. Masouleh is a city in the capital of Sardar-e Jangal District, in Fouman County, Gilan Province, Iran. Historical names for the city include Masalar and Khortab. It was founded in the 10th century AD. The village is located approximately 60 km southwest of Rasht and 32 km west of Fouman and near the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. The first village of Masouleh was established around 1006 AD, 6 km northwest of the current city, and it is called Old-Masouleh (Kohneh Masouleh in Persian). People moved from Old-Masouleh to the current city because of pestilence and attacks from neighboring communities. Masouleh structure is unique. The buildings have been built into the mountain and are interconnected. Front yards and roofs both serve as pedestrian areas similar to streets. When it gets dark and colorful lights are in full flare. Patterned Persian rugs are lit up. And the air is filled with a mixture of sweet fruit tobacco, and shish kebab. The night that is the Persians primetime, families gather and laughter gets louder and louder. Notable for its traditional wooden buildings, clustered on the northern slopes of the valley, Masouleh is registered as National Cultural and Natural Heritage in Iran, one of the sites of the UNESCO. The village is rich in tangible and intangible heritage. The surrounding mountains provide many opportunities for trekking, climbing and other activities.\n\nHeyran Tourist Region\n\nHeyran Tourist Region is located on the west of Astara in Gilan Province. It has three villages: The Lower Heyran, the Middle Heyran and the Upper Heyran. The Heyran Pass is one of the most important tourist attractions of these villages and is located on the road linking Astara and Ardabil. It faces the forest-covered mountains on the one side and a valley on the other side where the Aqchai River flows and forms the border between Gilan Province and the Republic of Azerbaijan. This pass is covered by fog most of the time although its altitude is not very much (the highest point is about 1,500 meters above sea-level). The main reason for this permanent fog cover is the moisture drifting from the Caspian Sea.\n\nLatoun Waterfall\n\nLatoun Waterfall in Astara can be considered the highest waterfall in Iran with a height of 105 meters. Latoun Waterfall is located in Astara County, Lavandevil City and Kuteh-Kumeh Village with longitude and latitude of 38o and 19’ N and 480 and 43’ E. This waterfall with a height of about 105 meters has two high steps from where water is released up to the point where water flows on. The water volume is different in different months of the year but it flows permanently in all seasons. The nearest tourist attractions to the waterfall are Latoun castle and Espinas peak, abandoned Asiyo Shevan village and other Waterfalls of the region."
