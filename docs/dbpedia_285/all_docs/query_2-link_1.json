        "text": "Iran has been divided into regions in a number of different ways historically.[1] It has been divided into five administrative regions (Persian: منطقه‌ها mantaqehâ, singular منطقه mantaqe) since 2014.\n\nCurrent administrative regions\n\n[edit]\n\nIran's thirty-one provinces were grouped into five regions on 22 June 2014, based on a decision by the Ministry of Interior.[2] In this change, the adjacency, geographical location and similarities of the provinces were considered.[2]\n\nThe Constitution of Iran does not provide for regions and they are not the constituent units of the country but exist purely for the convenience of governmental administration.\n\nAccording to Javad Naserian, the Ministry of Interior's Management Development and Human Resources Vice-Minister, the purpose of this grouping of provinces was the creation of synergy, transfer of experience, information exchange, and regional development. Also, it now provides an intermediate level where provinces can discuss their problems among themselves, instead of going immediately to Tehran.[2]\n\nThe intention was for each region to have regularly scheduled meetings of the constituent provinces' governors-general, rotating the meeting place through the provincial capitals. The host province would provide the chairman of each meeting. A regional secretariat would be established in the capital city of the main province of each region, with a coordinating bureau in the Ministry of Interior headquarters in Tehran.[2]\n\nRegion Capital Provinces Population Area (km2) Region 1\n\n۱ منطقه Tehran Alborz Province\n\nGolestan Province\n\nMazandaran Province\n\nQazvin Province\n\nQom Province\n\nSemnan Province\n\nTehran Province 23,343,033 193,109 Region 2\n\n۲ منطقه Isfahan Bushehr Province\n\nChaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province\n\nFars Province\n\nHormozgan Province\n\nIsfahan Province\n\nKohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province 12,973,089 354,885 Region 3\n\n۳ منطقه Tabriz Ardabil Province\n\nEast Azerbaijan Province\n\nGilan Province\n\nKordestan Province\n\nWest Azerbaijan Province\n\nZanjan Province 12,782,820 165,839 Region 4\n\n۴ منطقه Kermanshah Hamadan Province\n\nIlam Province\n\nKermanshah Province\n\nKhuzestan Province\n\nLorestan Province\n\nMarkazi Province 11,739,552 185,978 Region 5\n\n۵ منطقه Mashhad Kerman Province\n\nNorth Khorasan Province\n\nRazavi Khorasan Province\n\nSistan and Baluchestan Province\n\nSouth Khorasan Province\n\nYazd Province 13,145,227 734,576\n\nHistorical regions\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1937 the territory of Iran was divided into ten administrative regions: Region 1 [fa], Region 2 [fa], Region 10 [fa], etc.(fa) For example, Region 7 [fa] or \"Seventh Province\" corresponded to present-day Fars Province per the \"Territorial Subdivision Act of 1316 Š./1937 (Qānūn-e taqsīmāt-e kešvar).\"[3]\n\nHistories, travel books and economic analyses often refer to less formal, more historical or geographical, Iranian regions. The borders of these are not fixed and often have changed over time, and even overlapped at the same time.\n\nAlamut - in the Alborz mountain range of northern Iran;\n\nCentral Iran: Known as Iraq-i Ajam (Persian Iraq)\n\nBaluchistan (Southeastern Iran) - sometimes just Sistan and Baluchestan Province and sometimes all of Baluchistan;\n\nCaspian Iran (Northern Iran, Tabaristan or \"Mardi and Hyrcania\"[4]) - Gilan Province, Mazandaran Province, and Golestan Province,[5] and historically sometimes northern Semnan\n\nEastern Iran\n\nIranian Azerbaijan - approximately the current provinces of Region 3, but often excluding Kurdistan Province and often excluding the Caspian province of Gilan;[6]\n\nIranian Kurdistan - including Kurdistan Province, Kermanshah Province and parts of Ilam Province and parts of West Azerbaijan Province;\n\nKhorasan - consisting of North Khorasan Province, Razavi Khorasan Province, South Khorasan Province, and sometimes eastern Semnan Province\n\nQuhistan - southern Khorasan;[7]\n\nPersian Gulf Iran (Persian Gulf region of Iran, Southern Iran) - Fars, Kohgiluyeh and Buyer Ahmad, Hormozgan and Bushehr provinces;\n\nSoutheastern Iran (Carmania)[4] - mostly Kerman Province, but often extending to the coast;\n\nWestern Iran (Khuzestan, Elam) - the 'birthplace of Iran', similar to Region 4 (Hamadan Province, Ilam Province, Kermanshah Province, Khuzestan Province, Lorestan Province, Markazi Province), but often including all of or some of Qazvin Province, Kurdistan Province, Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari Province and Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province;[8]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nGeographic history of Iran [fa]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]"
