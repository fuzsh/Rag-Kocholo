According to archaeological findings, which have been discovered from pre-historic sites of Guilan from Iron Age, these people believed in the life after death and existence of social classes and continuation of the conditions of the dead person during his life in the other world. They offered sacrifices to gods which included both animal and human sacrifices. This was probably done for acquisition of the divine satisfaction. Particular animals like sheep, goat and cow were chosen for sacrifice. At the same time they were afraid of the vicious creatures that could cause harms. In historical eras Guilan residents believed in authentic Aryan gods and resisted the acceptance of Zoroastrianism and instead insisted on their belief in such goddesses as Mitra and Nahid. Thus, in sacred scriptures of Zoroastrians and Iranian literature as well as the belief of the people of other regions they have been referred to as devils and liars.\n\nKeywords: Religious Beliefs, Graves of Iron Age, Sacrifice, Historic Era, Gilan"
