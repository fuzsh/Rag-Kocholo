Methods: Abomasum and duodenum contents of 144 livestock were collected from sheep, goats, and cattle in Guilan province. Morphological survey was performed for initial screening. Total DNA was extracted, and the partial region of Cox1 gene was amplified and sequenced. Genetic diversity was calculated and phylogenetic analysis of the data on nucleotide sequence was conducted by MEGA7 software. Results: Three species of Trichostrongylus including T. colubriformis, T. vitrinus, and T. axei were identified by morphological characteristics. The genetic divergence within the species in the present study was observed for T. axei (0-2.5%), T. colubriformis (0.77%), and T. vitrinus (0%). The mean inter-species difference between the three species of Trichostrongylus obtained in this study was 14.4-15.4%. Conclusion: The Cox1 sequences of the members of Trichostrongylus spp. were highly variable and this could be used as a valuable measure to achieve a proper assessment on biodiversity. Sequence data generation from other species of Trichostrongylus will be needed to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of this genus of nematodes.\n\nSome helminth species belonging to the order Strongylida are parasites of the digestive tract of vertebrates, including man and domestic animals. In humans, infections with Oesophagostomum spp. and Trichostrongylus spp. may be misdiagnosed as hookworm disease on parasitological stool examination, mainly in regions where these infections are coendemic, since eggs released in hosts’ feces are morphologically similar. This study presents the morphologic characterization of Strongylida larvae recovered from humans and pigs living in close proximity, exploring putative zoonotic cycles. One hundred three humans and 27 pigs were included in low-resource rural communities in the state of Piauí, northeastern Brazil. Strongylida eggs were present in 12 (11.7%) humans and 23 (85.2%) pigs through conventional parasitological examination. Strongylida-positive fecal samples were submitted to coprocultures using the Harada–Mori technique. All 22 larvae obtained from human feces were classified as hookworms (Ancylostomatidae). From a total of 37 larvae obtained from swine, 23 (62.3%) were classified as Oesophagostomum, 6 (16.2%) were Hyostrongylus, and 4 (10.8%) were Trichostrongylus. Four larvae (10.8%) obtained from pigs were classified as Strongyloides. The morphological study of filariform larvae obtained in coprocultures is a useful and inexpensive tool in the screening of intestinal helminthiasis in a One Health approach.\n\nBackground This study was carried out to investigate the prevalence and analyze the molecular characteristics based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 2 region of the ribosomal RNA (RNA) gene of trichostrongylid nematodes in different ruminants from Guilan province, northern of Iran. Methods The gastrointestinal tracts of 144 ruminants including 72 cattle, 59 sheep, and 13 goats were collected from an abattoir in Guilan province during July to September 2018. After isolation the helminths, male specimens were identified based on morphological parameters. PCR and partial sequencing of the ITS2 fragment were conducted. After phylogenetic analysis, the intraspecific and interspecific differences were calculated. Results The prevalence of total infections with the nematodes was 38.9, 74.6 and 84.6% among cattle, sheep and goats, respectively. Eleven species of trichostrongylid nematodes including Haemonchus contortus , Marshallagia marshalli , Trichostrongylus axei , T. colubriformis , T. vitrinus , Ostertagia trifurcata , Teladorsagia circumcincta , Marshallagia occidentalis , O. lyrata , O. ostertagi , and Cooperia punctate were recovered from the ruminants. The most prevalent trichostrongyloid nematodes in cattle, sheep and goats were O. ostertagi (26.4%), M. marshalli (64.4%) and T. circumcincta (69.2%), respectively. Phylogenetic tree was discriminative for Trichostrongylidae family, while phylogenetic analysis of the ITS2 gene represented low variations and no species identification of Haemonchidae and Cooperiidae families. Conclusions This study suggests the high prevalence and species diversity of trichostrongyloid nematodes in different ruminants, indicating the importance of implement antiparasitic strategies in north regions of Iran. As well, this study showed that the ITS2 fragment is not a discriminative marker for Haemonchidae and Cooperiidae families, and investigation of other genetic markers such as mitochondrial genes would be more valuable for better understanding of their phylogenetic relationships.\n\nObjectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of Strongyloides stercoralis and other intestinal parasites among the patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs and related risk factors in northern Iran. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 494 patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs including cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy (n=188) and those treated with prolonged corticosteroid administration (n=306). All fresh fecal samples were examined by direct wet-mount, formalin ethyl-acetate concentration, and agar plate culture techniques. Results: In total, 16.8% of patients were positive for at least one intestinal parasite, so among those the helminthic and protozoan infection rates were 5.1% and 12.3%, respectively. The infection rate was significantly higher in corticosteroid treated individuals (19.6%) than cancer patients (12.2%) (P = 0.03). The prevalence rate of S. stercoralis among the patients receiving chemotherapy and those treated with corticosteroids were 4.3% and 5.2%, respectively. The prevalence rate of S. stercoralis infection was significantly higher in older patients (P=0.02). Conclusion: Strongyloidiasis is one of most common parasites among the patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs in northern Iran. Early diagnosis and proper treatment of these patients are necessary to minimize complications of severe strongyloidiasis.\n\nThe objective of the present study was to identify Trichostrongylus species by molecular analysis and also phylogenetic relationships of Trichostrongylus species by mitochondrial Cox1 gene in Guilan province, northern Iran. Abomasum and duodenum contents of 144 livestock were collected from sheep, goats, and cattle in Guilan province. Morphological survey was performed for initial screening. Total DNA was extracted, and the partial region of Cox1 gene was amplified and sequenced. Genetic diversity was calculated and phylogenetic analysis of the data on nucleotide sequence was conducted by MEGA7 software. Three species of Trichostrongylus including T. colubriformis , T. vitrinus , and T. axei were identified by morphological characteristics. The genetic divergence within the species in the present study was observed for T. axei (0-2.5%), T. colubriformis (0.77%), and T. vitrinus (0%). The mean inter-species difference between the three species of Trichostrongylus obtained in this study was 14.4–15.4%. The Cox1 sequences of the members of Trichostrongylus spp. were highly variable and this could be used as a valuable measure to achieve a proper assessment on biodiversity. Sequence data generation from other species of Trichostrongylus will be needed to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of this genus of nematodes.\n\nBackground: The members of Trichostrongylus spp. are gastrointestinal nematodes of ruminants with worldwide distribution. The nematodes are considered as major health challenges especially in endemic regions of Iran. Several species of the parasite are reported from humans and animals in the country. Frequently, molecular analyses for identification of different species focus on nuclear regions and there is lack of information regarding the mitochondrial genes of Trichostrongylus spp. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify Trichostrongylus species by molecular analysis of mitochondrial gene in Guilan province, northern Iran. Methods: The nematodes were collected from the abomasum contents of sheep, goats and cattle. Morphological survey was performed for initial screening. Total DNA was extracted, and the partial region of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (Cox1) gene was amplified and sequenced. Genetic diversity was calculated and phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence data was conducted. Results: Three species of Trichostrongylus including T. colubriformis, T. vitrines and T. axei were identified by morphological characterizations. The genetic divergence within the species in the present study was observed for T. axei (0-2.5%), T. colubriformis (0.77%) and T. vitrinus (0%). The mean inter-species difference between the Trichostrongylus species obtained in this study was 14.4- 15.4%. Conclusions: The Cox1 sequences of members of the Trichostrongylus spp. are highly variable and this could be used as a valuable measure for achieving a proper assessment of biodiversity. Sequence data generation from additional species of Trichostrongylus will be needed to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of this genus of nematodes.\n\nSimple Summary: The review was conducted to establish an overview of rodent helminths in the Middle East as well as their public health importance. Following a systematic search, 65 field research were identified, studied, and analyzed. The overall prevalence of cestodes, nematodes, and trematodes were 24.88%, 32.71%, and 10.17%, respectively. The review detected 21 species of cestodes, 56 nematodes, and 23 trematodes, from which 22 have zoonotic importance. Capillaria hepatica, Hymenolepis diminuta, Hymenolepis nana, and Cysticercus fasciolaris were the most frequent and widespread zoonotic helminths. The review identified that there is an information gap on rodent helminths at the humans-animal interface level in this region. Therefore, the public health importance of rodent-borne helminth parasites is not fully recognized. Countrywide detailed studies on rodent helminths, along with the impact on public health, should be conducted in this region. Abstract: Rodents can be a source of zoonotic helminths in the Middle East and also in other parts of the world. The current systematic review aimed to provide baseline data on rodent helminths to recognize the threats of helminth parasites on public health in the Middle East region. Following a systematic search on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, a total of 65 research studies on rodent cestodes, nematodes, and trematodes, which were conducted in the countries of the Middle East, were analyzed. The study identified 44 rodent species from which Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, and Rattus rattus were most common (63%) and recognized as the primary rodent hosts for helminth infestation in this region. Cestodes were the most frequently reported (n = 50), followed by nematodes (49), and trematodes (14). The random effect meta-analysis showed that the pooled prevalence of cestode (57.66%, 95% CI: 34.63-80.70, l 2 % = 85.6, p < 0.001) was higher in Saudi Arabia, followed by nematode (56.24%, 95% CI: 11.40-101.1, l 2 % = 96.7, p < 0.001) in Turkey, and trematode (15.83%, 95% CI: 6.25-25.1, l 2 % = 98.5, p < 0.001) in Egypt. According to the overall prevalence estimates of individual studies, nematodes were higher (32.71%, 95% CI: 24.89-40.54, l 2 % = 98.6, p < 0.001) followed by cestodes (24.88%, 95% CI: 19.99-29.77, l 2 % = 94.9, p < 0.001) and trematodes (10.17%, Animals 2020, 10, 2342 2 of 18 95% CI: 6.7-13.65, l 2 % = 98.3, p < 0.001) in the rodents of the Middle East countries. The review detected 22 species of helminths, which have zoonotic importance. The most frequent helminths were Capillaria hepatica, Hymenolepis diminuta, Hymenolepis nana, and Cysticercus fasciolaris. There was no report of rodent-helminths from Bahrain, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Furthermore, there is an information gap on rodent helminths at the humans-animal interface level in Middle East countries. Through the One Health approach and countrywide detailed studies on rodent-related helminths along with their impact on public health, the rodent control program should be conducted in this region.\n\nPurposeThe aim was to characterize the infection by Trichostrongylus spp. in patients from Chile using a combination of molecular detection techniques and phylogenetic analysis relating the findings to clinical and epidemiological reports of the patientsMethods Strongylid eggs were detected in seven patients by coproparasitological techniques. From each sample a fragment of the ITS-2 ribosomal gene was amplified by PCR, sequenced and analyzed by the Neighbor-Joining method.ResultsAll the sequences and phylogenetic clusters corresponded to T. colubriformis. Two samples presented a single nucleotide polymorphism showing two possible haplotypes. Six patients presented gastrointestinal symptoms. All of them lived on farms and used sheep manure as fertilizer.ConclusionT. colubriformis was the strongylid involved in the infections of these Chilean patients associated with the presence of livestock and agricultural practices that favor infection by this type of nematode."
