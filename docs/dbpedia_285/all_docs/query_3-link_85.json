        "text": "The Subatan summer region is one of the most picturesque areas in Iran, renowned for its natural beauty and pleasant climate. Located in Talesh, Gilan Province — the most humid province in Iran —Subatan rarely experiences temperatures that drop below one degree above zero. Even during summer, remnants of snow can be spotted on the heights ranging from 1,900 to 2,500 meters above sea level.\n\nResidents typically inhabit Subatan during spring, summer, and part of autumn, migrating to the forests of the Alborz Mountain hillsides and the shores of the Caspian Sea (specifically Lisar) as autumn comes to a close. Only a few families remain in the Huni Yesh summer area during this time.\n\nDespite changes in the central areas of Subatan, herders and nomads in the surrounding villages preserve their native culture, living in tents and thatched houses. Notable attractions include Varzan Waterfall, Mahar Waterfall, the stunning Neor Lake, and the districts of Sari Dash, Hacha Dash, and Majma Dash, as well as various natural and forest parks.\n\nSubatan lacks a residential center, but most local residents greet travelers warmly, welcoming them into their homes. A travel from Neor Lake to Subatan Village is highly recommended, offering the chance to experience a lake, forest, and beautiful village all in one trip. Visitors can enjoy a variety of weather conditions—sunny, rainy, foggy, and more—within the same day.\n\nThere are several ways to reach Subatan, with two popular options. The first is to travel from Talesh, though an off-road vehicle is necessary for safe mountain driving. Alternatively, travelers can hire patrols that take passengers to the area.\n\nOne interesting aspect of local culture is the cooperation between residents and travelers in collecting litter, reflecting a shared commitment to preserving the environment.\n\nThroughout Iran, one can find places with paradisiacal scenery and unspoiled nature that captivate every visitor. The lush landscapes of northern Iran are home to several such dreamlike locations.\n\nThe township of Talesh is located 451km from Tehran, nestled in a mountainous area in the west of Gilan Province. The Alborz Mountains runs parallel to the coastline from north to south, contributing to Talesh’s moderate and humid climate, characterized by a relatively high percentage of annual rainfall."
