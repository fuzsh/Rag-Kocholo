        "text": "In comparison with Mesopotamia, which provides an abundance of cuneiform sources as well as physical evidence in the form of imports bearing on the question of pre-Islamic maritime trade, Persia has far less incontrovertible proof that maritime trade was an important factor in her ancient economy. Whereas the cities of southern Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley had obvious outlets to the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea, those of the Persian interior, in most cases, did not. Yet, it is important to stress that Susa lies on the Karḵa (Elamite Ulā, Akk. Ulaya) river which, as the accounts of Alexander's departure from Susa in 324 BCE and of Nearchus' arrival from the Indus attest, was navigable in antiquity (and even in the 19th century) up to the Karun (Kārun), from which point onward access to the Persian Gulf was unproblematic (Potts, 1999a; Bosworth, 1988). The same general conditions apply, therefore, to sites like Chogha Zambil (Čoḡā Zanbil) (albeit using the Diz river in the first instance). Sites in the Shushtar (Šuštar) region had ready access to the head of the Gulf by following the Karun, while further east, in the Behbahān or Rām Hormoz regions, the Marun river provided an outlet. Once we move into the highlands of Fārs, it becomes easier to reach the Persian Gulf at Bushehr (Bušehr, ancient Liyan), by going overland down through a series of passes which eventually lead to the coast. This approach would have been equally relevant for prehistoric sites in the Marv Dašt plain (e.g. Tell-e Bakun), for Elamite sites (e.g. Tell-e Mālyān, ancient Anshan (Anšān)) and for Achaemenid and later sites (e.g. Persepolis, Estakhr (Eṣṭaḵr), and eventually Shiraz). As records from the Islamic period show, routes also linked e.g. Shiraz with Sirāf; the interior of southern Fars (Fārs) with Lenga; Sirjān with present-day Bandar Abbās (a name which it acquired only in the early 17th century CE; before that, it was known as Shahru (Šahru)); Jiroft with Hormoz via Mināb, etc. (Aubin 1969; Yajima and Kamioka 1988), but the relevance of these coast-hinterland routes for the pre-Islamic era is unclear. Nevertheless, a study of archaeological evidence found at sites in landlocked parts of Persia and literary sources confirms that trade with the Persian Gulf region was vigorous enough to effect the import of numerous types of materials.\n\nThis article is focused on the history of the emergence and development of shipbuilding in the Khorezm oasis in the 19th and 20th centuries. The history of Butakov&#39;s study of the Aral Sea and the discovery of sea routes in Amu Darya river has a two-hundred-year period. During this time, the navy and the seafaring reached a high level and almost ended. During this period, the major part of cargo transported to the Khorezm oasis by ships was a huge flotilla in this area. The deterioration of the ecological situation, the extreme degradation of the river and the complication of ships, the efficiency of rail, automobile, airfreight and passenger transport - all led to the limitation of ships&#39; movement on the rivers of Central Asia.\n\nThe Caspian region is landlocked although the water basin is called a sea. However, there is no outflow from the so-called \"sea\" to any other external body of water. The region is cut off from maritime trade, which means that the littoral countries of the Caspian are exposed to problems typical of landlocked countries. To overcome this condition there have been massive investments to build sufficient infrastructure and land-based logistics corridors. Here I will discuss another way of overcoming this issue by focusing on the canals linking the Caspian with open seas. Presently the Volga-Don Canal and Volga-Baltic waterway systems play this role but their insufficiency and limitations are the reasons that we call the region landlocked."
