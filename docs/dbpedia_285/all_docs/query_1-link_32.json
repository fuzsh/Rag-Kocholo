        "text": "Finding quality restaurants is difficult because not every expensive one is good. This restaurant is still my best choice for health and spending money. **Note: These tips are for perfectionists** Reasons from outside to inside: 1. The impressive traditional atmosphere. 2. Iranian traditional music. 3. Having natural flowers on the table (good sense transfer) 4. Good staff attitude. 5. Give the customer the right time to choose the food. 6. The super convenient time between appetizer to the main course. 7. Minimum use of plastic containers (almost zero, instead of plastic straw you can have a wooden or metal straw with yourself). 8. Serving in traditional dishes. 9. Very hot and fresh food. 10. Low fat and low salt. 11. Using Iranian rice. 12. The use of quality materials. In the end, I expect them to use traditional bread instead of industrial bread (as before). Hope it was helpful :)\n\nThe Caspian Sea Cuisine, with its fabulous taste and variety is my favorite, so you can find some in this restaurant., the quality can be better, since the rates are high, recommend to taste Mirza Ghassemi for the starter but be careful not to take so much, cause ou might lose the main course. And definitely Sour- Kebab ( Kabab-torsh) as the mail course. Sure you enjoy the taste\n\n\"Gilan\" is a northern province of Iran confined with capitan see and Alborz mountain range with different ethnic communities. Gilane resylturant is probably the best place in Tehran the capital of Iran to taste a full array of Gilan's traditional foods, most of which are a little bit different with famous Iranian traditional foods. The taste of foods, salads, appetizers and soups were really fine and quite original. The restaurant interior design is nice. It has dedicated parking which is priceless. The price are a little bit higher than average restaurants in the area, but still reasonable specially for foreign travelers. I particularly suggest sour kebabs and \"khoreshtsc, mirza_ghasemi, fishes, and also \"baghali ghatogh\".\n\nWe just had dinner there as a larger group of 9 people. We’d made a reservation, so all good. The first thing we noticed when getting to the restaurant is how dirty the restrooms were! The bathrooms hadn’t been cleaned in a while - so we told the staff. The good thing is, they reacted and cleaned the toilet bowl but of course not the floors, walls, sink, etc... The food itself was pretty ok...big-ish portions, fairly priced and a larger variety.... The one negative thing was that when we asked about a round of tea in the end, we were told: no tea on Fridays, sorry! So we paid and whilst leaving asked another staff member who was surprised that we were told there’s no tea as others were being served... Anyway...Long story short, this place wasn’t my choice so I’ll be sticking to the “other” place with the better food and cleaner location.\n\nI used to go there every now and then and it was generally a good restaurant with good quality, very small portion and very expensive; yet I used to go there because there are not so many restaurants serving shomali food( the local food for north of iran),,,, once I went there with a french friend and I ordered the same food that I had tasted before and it was awful! I could easily understand that the chiken was no fwresh and it smelled bad! After that time I never went there. Unfortunately most restaurants in Iran after gaining their popularity among people, get worse by time!"
