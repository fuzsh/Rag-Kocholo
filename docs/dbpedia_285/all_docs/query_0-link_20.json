Feel free to give opinions and discussions in discussion tab about things related to this page.\n\nMapping conventions\n\nThe Iran/Tagging rules contains a summary of mapping conventions specific to Iran. As much as possible, mapping and tagging should follow the conventions set by the OpenStreetMap community as a whole, such as indicated in pages like Map Features, Feature Index, and Editing Standards and Conventions.\n\nThe largest and most active community of Iran OSM users is currently taking place on Telegram Chat group \"OSM Iran\". You can join this group via our OpenStreetMapIR telegram channel.\n\nWe also have a subforum on OpenStreetMap forum, which is the second active channel to contact Iranian community.\n\nThere is also a mailing list set up for Iranian mappers. You can join the list here.\n\nProvinces\n\nIran has 31 provinces.\n\nProvince Capital Alborz Karaj Ardabil Ardabil Azarbayjan Gharbi Orumiyeh Azarbayjan Sharghi Tabriz Bushehr Bushehr Chaharmahal va Bakhtiari Shahr Kord Isfahan Isfahan Fars Shiraz Gilan Rasht Golestan Gorgan Hamedan Hamedan Hormozgan Bandar Abbas Ilam Ilam Kerman Kerman Kermanshah Kermanshah Khorasan jonubi Birjand Khorasan Razavi Mashhad Khorasan Shomali Bojnurd Khuzestan Ahwaz Kohgiluyeh va Boyer-Ahmad Yasuj Kordestan Sanandaj Lorestan Khoram Abad Markazi Arak Mazandaran Sari Qazvin Qazvin Qom Qom Semnan Semnan Sistan va Baluchestan Zahedan Tehran ⭐️ Tehran Yazd Yazd Zanjan Zanjan\n\nGoals & Projects\n\nIf you have a goal that you are working towards or one that you would like to see get done (and are maybe willing to get the ball rolling) then add it to the list here, create a section where it can be coordinated and tracked, and a way of measuring progress. And then get on with it :-)\n\nMapRoulette\n\nName Project Progress Difficulty Priority Iran Sharp Angle Roads 100 % Easy N/A Iran Floating Ways 100 % Normal N/A Iran Crossing Roads Check 56 % Normal N/A Adding Iran towns population tag 100 % Normal N/A Iran runways correction 100 % Easy N/A Adding \"turn=reverse\" to Iran U-turn road links 1 % Easy High edit place=town tag 0 % Easy Medium edit highway=living_street tag 0 % Normal Medium delete place=locality on cities and towns 0 % Expert Low edit place=city tag 100 % Expert High editing Shiraz residential street names 0 % Normal High\n\nHumanitarian projects\n\nThis is a summary of humanitarian projects planned for Iran.

A new OSM-user was set up for this named iran_provinces. The manual import surfaced a large diagonal offset between ML and WFB data. To resolve this the country boundaries from WFB were kept untouched and connections to the province boundary data from ML were created manually.\n\nIn August 2016 a new project was started by Adib Yz to enhance the Province boundaries of Iran and also add County, District and Rural administrative boundary of Iran to the map. The source files for this import contains the most up to date administrative boundaries of Iran that are currently used by different Iranian organizations. These files has been obtained from Arak's Technology University under public use license.\n\nSee also the List of admin_level values for Iran.\n\nProtected Areas of Iran\n\nOn July and August of 2016 the boundaries for Iran's Protected Areas has been added to Iran's Map by Adib Yz. The source for these areas are the maps from WDPA and Iran's Environment Organization. The three major protection title that has been added are as follows:\n\nNational Parks of Iran\n\nWildlife Sanctuary of Iran\n\nProtected Areas of Iran\n\nhelpful in JOSM\n\nPreset\n\nIranian Presets: Some additional presets to use with a single click:\n\nBots/Scripts\n\nFaNumberFixerBot automatic converting English and Arabic digits to Persian digits. FaNumberFixer in wiki\n\nEvents\n\nStatus\n\nUseful resources\n\nfor boundaries https://iransdi.ncc.gov.ir/layersf/irdv; Iran's National Cartography Centre\n\nfor names: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/jog/iran/; Perry-Castañeda Library\n\nSee also"
