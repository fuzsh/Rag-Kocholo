        "text": "Hazardous wastes include numerous kinds of discarded chemicals and other wastes generated from industrial, commercial, and institutional activities. These types of waste present immediate or long-term risks to humans, animals, plants, or the environment and therefore require special handling for safe disposal. Landfills that can accept hazardous wastes are excavated or engineered sites where these special types of waste can be disposed of securely. Since landfills are permanent sites, special attention must be afforded in selecting the location. This paper investigated the use of the Boolean theory and Fuzzy logic in combination with Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methods by applying GIS and IDRISI software for the selection of a hazardous waste landfill site in the Iranian province of Hormozgan. The best location was determined via the Fuzzy and the Boolean methodologies. By collating the area selected for the hazardous waste landfill, this study found that Fuzzy logic with an AND operator had the best options for this purpose. In the end, the most suitable area for a hazardous waste landfill was about 1.6 km 2 which was obtained by employing Fuzzy in combination with AHP and by using an AND operator. In addition, all the fundamental criteria affecting the landfill location were considered.\n\nThe article proposes a developed expert information system for assessing environmental risks for complexly structured and uncertain source data. The result of using the program is the desubjectivization of the decision-making process in the presence of a large amount of heterogeneous information. It is supposed to use the system as a technical means of monitoring and assessing the harmful effects of military installations on the environment. The program should serve to increase the effectiveness of environmental protection measures at special facilities of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation. The mathematical algorithm of the developed software application is based on the theory of fuzzy sets (Mamdani’s logical inference diagram). The solution involves finding the degree of truth and bringing to clarity the initially fuzzy input data by the centroid method and, as a result, a score assessment of the quality of environmental characteristics.\n\nThe objective of this article is to select land for commercial buildings in Rio de Janeiro city using multiple criteria decision-making techniques. The techniques used were based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy Logic methods. These methods were chosen because of functionality, flexibility and great application in engineering problems for decision making involving multiple criteria. Its application was made through an opinion survey with expert builders, where 6 (six) factors for evaluation were selected in 10 (ten) commercial land alternatives. For the analytical operation of the methods, the software used were: Super Decisions and MATLAB®, respectively for each method, presenting the factors classified, in order of priority, in the selection of land, and ranking of the alternatives according to the defined scenario, facilitating in this way the process of selection of land for buildings, establishing a scientific way for the decision process.\n\nFuzzy multi-criteria decision-making follows aggregation of different basic attributes through hierarchy structure. This aggregation is performed through combination of fuzzy assessment and priority matrices. When available data is imprecise, the assessment and priority matrices for different hierarchy level attributes are developed from expert judgments in the relevant fields. In fuzzy aggregation, the uncertainties in the assessment matrix are captured with fuzzy membership functions. The priority matrix is developed through pairwise comparison, in which the relative importance of the attributes are represented by the experts in crisp values; thus uncertainties associated with priority assignment are not incorporated in fuzzy aggregation. In this paper, a methodology to incorporate fuzziness in developing priority matrix has been presented. Fuzzy α-cut technique for different confidence intervals has been incorporated. The gradient eigenvector method has been followed to obtain consistency in constructing the priority matrix for different hierarchy level attributes. The max-min paired elimination method for hierarchical aggregation has been used to obtain the final fuzzy set. A case study for drinking water treatment technology evaluation is performed to present the potential environmental application of this approach, leading to the identification of the best treatment technology."
