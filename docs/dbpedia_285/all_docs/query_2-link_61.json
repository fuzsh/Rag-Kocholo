        "text": "It seems every nation has its spin on iced coffee, and Persia is no exception with its delightful take called Caf√© Gelas√®. This indulgent treat is the perfect mix of coffee and dessert, making it an ideal choice for a Sunday afternoon or a special dessert to impress.\n\nMy first taste of Caf√© Gelas√® was at the Sheraton Hotel in Tehran with my dad when I was just six years old. Despite my tender age, I still recall the deliciously smooth and cold blend of chocolate and coffee. ‚ÄúSix years old?!‚Äù you might exclaim. Well, in Iran, no one‚Äôs ever too young to enjoy tea or coffee!\n\nWelcome to the world of Morabaye Yaghoot-e Sorkh‚Äîthe Persian name I‚Äôve bestowed upon my beloved redcurrant jam. This jam has become one of my all-time favourites, thanks to its tangy taste that dances on the tongue and reminds me of Morabaye Albaloo (sour cherry jam). If you're a fan of the latter, get ready for a new jam crush!\n\nNow, as someone who revels in the sun-soaked joys of summer, I‚Äôm thrilled by the bounty of fresh berries this season brings. Between savouring them fresh and stashing them away for later, there‚Äôs nothing quite like turning them into delicious jams that keep the sunny vibes alive throughout the year.\n\nI am introducing my refreshing and unique Pomegranate Saffron Sharbat! üçπ‚ú® This delightful drink celebrates vibrant flavours and aromatic ingredients, perfect for any occasion. Combining the tartness of fresh pomegranate juice with the floral notes of saffron and rose water, this sharbat is balanced by lime's brightness and honey's subtle sweetness. Each sip offers a journey through the exotic tastes of Persia, making it an ideal treat for hot summer days or a special gathering with loved ones.\n\nKookoo Kadoo is a delightful Persian dish that exemplifies the rich and varied culinary traditions of Iran. This courgette frittata is a versatile and flavourful creation, perfect for any meal of the day.\n\nKookoo refers to dishes made of a mixture of ingredients that are then pan-fried, similar to a frittata. They have eggs as a base ingredient and can be served warm or at room temperature. Whether enjoyed as a main course, a side dish, or a delightful snack, Kookoo Kadoo offers a glimpse into the vibrant flavours and textures that define Persian gastronomy.\n\nThese Azeri-stuffed aubergines will transport your taste buds to another dimension! This exquisite dish, known as Garni Yarikh, hails from the Azerbaijan province of Iran, where it has been perfected over generations. The name \"Garni Yarikh\" is in Azeri, the language spoken in this culturally rich region.\n\nWhether you choose to prepare it with succulent lamb, hearty beef, or a flavourful vegan mince, this dish is sure to impress. The delightful blend of spices, tender aubergines, and aromatic filling creates a culinary experience that will linger in your memory. I can assure you, this will not be the last time you savour the delights of Garni Yarikh!\n\nBaghala Ghatogh is a traditional dish from Gilan province in northern Iran, situated near the Caspian Sea. It holds a special place in northern Iranian cuisine, often savoured during family gatherings and festive occasions. This dish offers a unique blend of flavours and textures, making it both nutritious and delicious. Despite its rich taste, Baghala Ghatogh requires only a few ingredients and is quick to prepare, endearing it to Iranians and enthusiasts of Persian cuisine alike.\n\nIt‚Äôs rhubarb season, which means it's time for Khoresh-e Rivas! This exquisite lamb and rhubarb stew is one of my favourite Persian dishes. The savoury richness of the lamb and herbs, combined with the fresh tang of rhubarb, creates a delightful harmony of flavours!\n\nWhen I was a child, every summer my family and I would journey to Mahalat, my dad's hometown. One of our favourite activities was rhubarb picking. It was a joyful tradition, with my dad, uncles, aunts, and cousins spreading out to find nice young rhubarb. Although it was hot and dry, we loved it so much.\n\nIf I had to pick my favourite vegan dish, in would be Gojeh Bademjaan! This veggie stew is full of flavour! You can serve it with bread, as well as aromatic rice. Best of all, it‚Äôs so easy to make!\n\nThis makes it the perfect weekday recipe for yourself to enjoy, as well as the ideal go-to Persian vegan dish! But let me warn you: Make enough for the meat lovers too, because this dish just might convert them! Let me show you how to prepare it.\n\nJaghoor Baghoor, or Hasratol Molook, indeed holds a significant place in Iranian cuisine, reflecting a rich tapestry of flavours and cultural heritage. Its variations across different regions speak to the diverse culinary landscape of Iran and the importance of local ingredients and traditions.\n\nThe story behind its name, Hasratol Molook, adds an intriguing layer to its history, highlighting the socio-economic dynamics of food consumption in the past. It's fascinating to see how a dish once enjoyed primarily by the working class has evolved into a celebrated part of Iranian culinary tradition.\n\nKhoresh-e Kadoo Halva stands as a cherished Persian stew celebrated for its comforting blend of tender meat, vibrant spices, and the subtle sweetness of pumpkin. This rich dish embodies the essence of Persian cuisine, offering a symphony of flavours that delight the senses.\n\nYou can use any variety of pumpkin to prepare this dish, yet those with a nutty taste, such as Uchiki Kuri or Butternut Squash give the stew a delightful depth.\n\nReshteh Polo is a widely loved Persian rice dish. The floral aroma of the saffron rice combined with the sweetness of the caramelised onions and raisins make for a multifaceted dish - too good for a humble side dish really. The brown noodles in the rice create the most mouthwatering tahdig (the crispy bits from the bottom of the pot)!\n\nGet ready to tantalize your taste buds with a Persian twist on fried eggs ‚Äì now featuring delicious dates and crunchy walnuts with every bite promising a delightful blend of tastes and textures. Picture this: perfectly cooked eggs paired with the sweet, chewy goodness of dates, and nutty flavour of the toasted walnuts all in one satisfying dish. Whether you're starting your day off right or craving a cosy dinner, these fried eggs with dates are sure to hit the spot, offering a tasty treat that's anything but ordinary.\n\nKhorak dishes encompass a variety of culinary delights prepared using ingredients like beans, meat, chicken, and vegetables, employing various cooking methods. These dishes hold a special place on the Iranian table. Bean stew stands out as a traditional and popular Iranian dish with a considerable number of enthusiasts. Its hearty nature makes it particularly satisfying, especially during the cold season. The uniqueness of bean stew lies in its use of beans, rendering it a distinct and cherished part of Iranian cuisine.\n\nSaj Kebab, also known as Saj Qorma (Saj Ghorma), is a traditional dish originating from East Azerbaijan, West Azerbaijan, and the Ardabil Provinces in Iran. It is celebrated not only locally but also throughout the country. The saj, an ancient and traditional cooking pan characterised by its round bottom and depth, serves as a versatile tool for preparing various foods and bread, much like a wok. It effectively transfers heat and can be used over coal or gas flames without damage. Saj pans are typically crafted from stainless steel, cast iron, or carbon steel, and are available in different sizes.\n\nSavouring a slow-cooked lamb neck stew is like a cosy hug for your taste buds!\n\nThe magic happens as the lamb becomes incredibly tender, soaking up a symphony of aromatic spices. With each bite, you're treated to a burst of rich flavours, creating a delightful and comforting experience. This stew is a surefire way to turn any meal into a warm and unforgettable culinary adventure!\n\nIndulge in the delightful harmony of flavours with fried eggs paired with figs! This charming breakfast dish combines the comforting simplicity of perfectly cooked eggs with the sweet, succulent goodness of fresh figs. It's an enjoyable twist that adds a touch of luxury to your morning routine or makes for a special brunch treat.\n\nIn this recipe, I‚Äôm going to show you how to honey-glaze the figs, but if your figs are already very ripe and sweet, you can skip it. However, honey-glazing enhances their natural sweetness as honey and figs complement each other perfectly."
