        "text": "Climate builds not only a resource for tourism as a driver but can be a limitation. Climate is usually described by air temperature and rain conditions and sometimes by the sunshine duration at a location. Nevertheless, these parameters are less representative for the spatial and temporal climate variability of a region and do not cover all the components of climate. In this research, due to the impact of climatic factors in tourism planning, determining tourism climate index (TCI) is of great concern. In this project, to assess the tourism climatic conditions using bioclimatic index (Tourism Climate Index), data from 10 synoptic stations of Gilan in a 10-year period (2012-2003) was collected and incomplete data through linear regression was rebuilt. In this system model, 7 parameters, the average monthly rainfall, average temperature, average relative humidity, maximum temperature, minimum relative, the mean daily sunshine duration and wind speed were evaluated. The aim of this study is to investigate the conditions of tourism climate in Gilan province based on TCI tourism climate and using the techniques of geographic information systems (GIS), they have mapped out and prepared the map of TCI for all months of the year. The results of this study showed that the optimal conditions in the region in terms of tourism climate are in May and the most difficult month in terms of tourism climate is in November which was the lowest TCI. In terms of geographical coverage, the ideal climatic conditions are more dominant in the North West (including the cities of Talesh, Astara, Anzali, Kiashahr, Roudsar).\n\nClimate is an important resource for tourism and must be taken into account in tourism promotions. Here, a climate leaflet containing climatological and bioclimatological information for tourists is presented. The bioclimatological conditions are portrayed using mean values and frequency of thermal sensation based on physiologically equivalent temperature for 10-day intervals covering the whole year, along with air and sea temperature, sunshine duration, amount and number of days with precipitation and wind roses. In addition, the Climate Tourism Information Scheme is included. When combined with climatological and bioclimatological conditions, this scheme is valuable for tourists as it enables them to choose the most suitable time period for holidays, with the choice depending on personal preferences and requirements. The information provided here assists the tourism industry and stakeholders in decision-making. As an example, the bioclimatological leaflet for Hvar, an island off the Croatian Adriatic coast, is presented.\n\nThe Impact of Climate Factors on Tourism Planning The importance of ICI is of great importance. In this project, the data of 10 stations of Meteorological and Sinopetic Province of Golestan in a 10-year statistical period (2003-2012) were collected by using the Turism climate index for assessing climate conditions. Data The defect was reconstructed through linear regression. In this system model, seven parameters, average monthly rainfall, mean temperature, mean relative humidity, maximum mean, relative humidity, daily average of sunshine hours and wind speed were evaluated. The purpose of this study was to study the climate conditions of the province of Gilan based on the TCI model and using the Geographic Information System (GIS) technique, a TCI map was prepared for all months of the year. Is. The results of this study showed that favorable conditions in this province are in terms of climate in May and is the most unfavorable month in terms of the tourism climate of the month of November, which has the lowest TCI. Geographically, the climate is ideal in the northern part of the province (including Talesh, Astara, Anzali, Kyashahr, Lahijan and Rudsar).\n\nIn order to develop tourism industry in a region, studying its climate through the year is necessary. The climate of the destination is of great importance for tourists. Therefore, the application of climate indices can help the tourism planning in the area and optimum spent of time. In this study, climatic conditions of a vast area in Iran including the middle, east, and southeast deserts have been evaluated and compared by using synoptic climatic indices for a period of 30 years and tourism climate index (TCI) together with holiday climate index (HCI) in different months. The results showed that both models, in autumn and winter, are the same regarding the area. In these seasons, mountainous area had the lowest records while low-altitude area like Caspian Sea beaches had the highest records. In springtime and summer, because of high temperatures, HCI scores in deserts were higher compared with TCI, but both indices illustrate similar records for Makran coasts. The comparison between the two indices showed that TCI demonstrates a wide range from unfavorable to favorable conditions through the year, while HCI shows less fluctuation. It could be concluded that TCI has a better function than HCI in the studied area. It was also showed that in addition to daytime hours, the maximum temperature and the relative humidity have the most effects on regional tourism attraction. Regarding the two indices, it was found that October, September, and April are the best months for tourism planning because of their pleasant weather."
