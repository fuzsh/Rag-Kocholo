Amy Ryan started her professional acting career onstage in 1987 and made her television debut on a 1990 episode of the soap opera \"As the World Turns.\" Since then, she has appeared in over 60 films and television series. Amy is probably best known for playing Helene McCready in \"Gone Baby Gone\" (2007), Beadie Russell on \"The Wire\" (2003–2008), and Holly Flax on \"The Office\" (2008–2011), and she has also appeared in films such as \"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead\" (2007), \"Dan in Real Life\" (2007), \"Goosebumps\" (2015), \"Beautiful Boy\" (2018), and \"Late Night\" (2019). Ryan is also known for her work on the stage, earning Tony nominations for her performance as Sonya Alexandrovna in \"Uncle Vanya\" and Stella Kowalski in \"A Streetcar Named Desire.\" Amy has won more than 30 awards for her work, and she earned an Academy Award nomination for \"Gone Baby Gone.\"\n\nEarly Life\n\nAmy Ryan was born Amy Beth Dziewiontkowski on May 3, 1968, in Queens, New York City. Her mother, Pamela, was a nurse, and her father, John, owned a trucking business. Amy has a sister, Laura, and they delivered newspapers by bike during their youth. Ryan became interested in acting at an early age and attended the Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Center in Loch Sheldrake, New York. She graduated from Manhattan's High School of Performing Arts at age 17 and was soon cast in a national tour of \"Biloxi Blues.\" Amy spent the next decade appearing in off-Broadway productions, and she began using the last name Ryan professionally because it's her mother's maiden name.\n\nStage Career\n\nIn 1987, Amy played Hannah in a production of \"A Shayna Maidel\" at the Westside Theatre, then appeared in several other off-Broadway productions, including \"The Rimers of Eldritch,\" \"Crimes of the Heart,\" \"Saved,\" and \"As Bees In Honey Drown.\" She made her Broadway debut in a 1993 production of \"The Sisters Rosensweig,\" and she returned to Broadway for \"The Three Sisters\" (1997), \"Uncle Vanya\" (2000), \"The Women\" (2001), and \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (2005), in which she played Stella to John C. Reilly's Stanley. Ryan earned Tony nominations for Best Featured Actress in a Play for \"Uncle Vanya\" in 2000 and \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" in 2005. She won an Outer Critics Circle Award for \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and received a Drama League Award nomination for \"Saved.\" In 2016, Amy received rave reviews for her performance in the Roundabout Theater Company's production of \"Love, Love, Love, which earned her an Obie Award as well as nominations from the Drama Desk Awards and Drama League Awards.\n\nFilm Career\n\nThough 1996's \"Grace of My Heart\" was technically Ryan's first movie, her scene was cut, so 1999's \"Roberta\" was the first film she was seen in. Amy then appeared in 2000's \"You Can Count on Me,\" 2004's \"Keane,\" and 2005's \"War of the Worlds,\" \"Capote,\" and \"Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World.\" In 2007, she earned critical acclaim and won more than 20 awards for her performance as Helene McCready in \"Gone Baby Gone,\" appeared in the crime thriller \"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead,\" and co-starred with future TV husband Steve Carell in \"Dan in Real Life.\" Ryan was directed by Clint Eastwood in 2008's \"Changeling,\" and she produced and starred in 2009's \"The Missing Person.\" She appeared in the Philip Seymour Hoffman-directed \"Jack Goes Boating\" in 2010, and she earned a Utah Film Critics Association Award for 2011's \"Win Win.\" In 2014, Amy co-starred with Michael Keaton, Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Emma Stone, and Naomi Watts in \"Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance),\" which won the Oscar for Best Picture.\n\nIn 2015, Ryan starred in \"Don Verdean,\" \"Louder Than Bombs,\" \"Bridge of Spies,\" and \"Goosebumps,\" which is based on R.L.

Ryan also starred in the thriller \"Strange but True\" in 2019, and in 2020, she appeared in two films that were based on true events, portraying lawyer Camille Biros in \"Worth\" and Mari Gilbert, a mother desperately trying to find her missing daughter, in \"Lost Girls.\"\n\nTelevision Career\n\nIn 1990, Amy appeared on \"As the World Turns\" as a runaway and followed up her TV debut with guest-starring roles on \"Quantum Leap\" (1991), \"Brooklyn Bridge\" (1991), and \"Home Improvement\" (1992). She played Parkie Sasser in six episodes of \"I'll Fly Away\" in 1992, then guest-starred on \"Law & Order\" (1993), \"Sirens\" (1995), and \"ER\" (1995).\n\nRyan was cast as Chloe Banks on the sitcom \"The Naked Truth\" in 1995 and appeared in 20 episodes of the series. From 2001 to 2002, she played three different characters on the legal drama \"100 Centre Street,\" and from 2003 to 2008, she portrayed Port Authority officer Beadie Russell on 20 episodes of \"The Wire.\"\n\nIn 2008, Amy won the heart of Michael Scott and fans of \"The Office\" as Dunder Mifflin HR rep Holly Flax, appearing in 17 episodes of the popular sitcom.\n\nIn 2010, she joined the cast of \"In Treatment\" during the drama's third season as therapist Adele Brousse, and in 2013, she co-starred with Larry David in the HBO television film \"Clear History.\" Ryan has also appeared on the TV series \"Third Watch\" (2004), \"Broad City\" (2015; 2017), and \"High Maintenance\" (2016; 2019), and in 2020, she narrated passages from late crime writer Michelle McNamara's book on the HBO documentary series \"I'll Be Gone In the Dark.\"\n\nPersonal Life\n\nAmy welcomed a daughter, Georgia, with comedy writer/actor/producer Eric Slovin on October 15, 2009, and the couple married on August 23, 2011. Slovin has written for \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"Important Things with Demetri Martin,\" and he was part of the comedy duo \"Slovin & Allen,\" who had their own \"Comedy Central Presents\" special in 2001.\n\nAwards and Nominations\n\nIn 2008, Ryan received an Academy Award nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role for \"Gone Baby Gone.\" The film also earned her a Golden Globe nomination as well as awards from the Alliance of Women Film Journalists, Awards Circuit Community Awards, Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards, Gold Derby Awards, National Board of Review, Online Film Critics Society Awards, Satellite Awards, and Southeastern Film Critics Association Awards. Amy won Gold Derby Awards for Comedy Guest Actress for \"The Office\" in 2008 and 2009, and \"Birdman\" was named best Ensemble Cast in 2015.\n\nThe \"Birdman\" cast also received ensemble awards from the Boston Online Film Critics Association, Detroit Film Critics Society, Las Vegas Film Critics Society, Phoenix Film Critics Society, and Screen Actors Guild Awards. In 2007, Ryan received a Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress for \"Gone Baby Gone\" and \"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead,\" and she shared a Gotham Independent Film Award with her \"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead\" castmates. In 2020, Amy was honored with the Precious Gem Award at the Miami Film Festival and won an IMDb STARmeter Award for Fan Favorite.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn 2011, Ryan and Slovin paid $3.1 million for an apartment in Brooklyn Heights. The home includes three bedrooms and three baths, and it was renovated shortly before Amy and Eric purchased it."
