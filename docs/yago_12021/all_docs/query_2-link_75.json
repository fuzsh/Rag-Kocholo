        "text": "Jack Goes Boating, Philip Seymour Hoffman's directorial debut, which opens nationwide this weekend, brings together an outstanding cast of New Yorkers—Hoffman, John Ortiz, Broadway's Daphne Rubin-Vega, and Amy Ryan—in a funny and poignant study of two working-class couples, one pair at the beginning of their romance and the other in the middle of an agonizing spiral. In her glowing September review, ELLE's Karen Durbin said, \"Hoffman demonstrates that there are no small people; there are just people, all of us living out our painful, precious lives.\" This idea is also central to understanding Ryan's career choices, which are free of any Hollywood artifice and full of quiet but powerful roles that are impossible not to fall in love with.\n\nRyan was a ray of light in HBO's Baltimore drug epic The Wire as single mother and Port Authority officer Beadie Russell. As Holly Flax, Michael Scott's lost (and maybe soon-to-be-regained) love on The Office, she's the only character in on Scott's jokes. Her own inner freak vindicates his audacious nuttiness—and has kept fans in a tizzy for the two to reunite before Steve Carell's departure at the end of this season. Even in her Oscar-nominated role as Helene, the neglectful young mother in Gone Baby Gone, Ryan was so steadfast in her on-screen amorality that you couldn't help but leave the theater so appalled by her character and so utterly in awe of her portrayal. ELLE.com talks to Ryan about her latest heart-grabbing performance in Jack Goes Boating, her roles on The Office and HBO's In Treatment this season, and the enduring fandemonium of The Wire.\n\nELLE: You and Philip Seymour Hoffman are close friends, right? What was it like to film with him?\n\nAmy Ryan: We are. In fact, we've worked with each other and known each other socially for many years in New York, and that adds another layer to the experience of filming with him. In some ways I am a few steps ahead because we already have the intimacy and trust required to play these characters. Actually, Phil reminded me yesterday of when we were on set late one night in Winnipeg, shooting Capote, and we both got into a discussion about relationships—shared some of our stories, our woes, or just funny anecdotes. To have that knowledge of a person can really help when you're thrown into a film like Jack Goes Boating.\n\nELLE: I just have to ask—you and Phil had to film a sex scene together. As friends, was it awkward?\n\nAR: [laughs] Well, even if I didn't know the person, it's an awkward scene to film! And it's meant to be. It's awkward and odd. But you know, you wear sweatpants under the covers. It's not the most hot, sexy, erotic love scene you'll ever get on film.\n\nELLE: You have a filmography full of dark, gritty work. This role is for an unconventional indie rom-com. Was it a change of pace for you?\n\nAR: Oh, it was a delicious change of pace, but all the characters are still so well written and dynamic.\n\nELLE: Of course there is a hefty dose of drama and melancholy in watching John and Daphne's on-screen marriage fall apart.\n\nAR: Yeah—the brutal side of love.\n\nELLE: In fact, there's a dinner party scene where you and Phil watch them have it out.\n\nAR: That whole dinner scene—we took a week to film that. It's about 11 pages of the script. It's deeply personal to watch actors go to those dark places. It can be scary, so you channel them all your love and energy, and you know you'll be safe on the other side.\n\nELLE: When they yell \"Cut!\" did you all immediately grab a drink or what?\n\nAR: We all lay on the bed actually. Phil had to go back to the monitor and watch playbacks, but Daphne, John, and I refused. We all just crashed on the bed with our feet up.\n\nELLE: You live in New York, where the movie is set. Was it fun to film at home?\n\nAR: Oh, I loved it. And Jack Goes Boating is such a love letter to New York—we got to see the city in ways we don't get to see it very often. And anytime you can go home to your own bed and be with your own family and then go to work with an extraordinary group of people the next morning—it's always blessing.\n\nELLE: You're joining the cast of In Treatment this season, which premieres October 25 on HBO. Let me tell you, when I moved to New York, I watched the show every day in lieu of therapy.\n\nAR: [laughs] A lot of people do that. How's it working for you?\n\nELLE: Well, I'm still here.\n\nAR: Awesome!\n\nClick for more on Amy Ryan\n\nELLE: For the first two seasons, Dianne Wiest played Gina, a therapist who treats Paul, Gabriel Byrne's character. Now she's gone, and you take up that torch. Tell me about your character.\n\nAR: I play Adele Brown, a therapist Paul comes to. She starts treating him, but I don't think that was his intent the first time they met. She's very good at her job, and he can't quite figure her out because she's very strict in her boundaries. In a sense, she's designed to be the antithesis of what Gina was to Paul.\n\nELLE: Yeah, Paul and Gina had a very storied past, and that contributed to their adversarial relationship. What's the dynamic like between him and Adele?\n\nAR: In some ways they start off as adversaries. He diminishes Adele. She's much younger than him, and he thinks there's no way she could possibly be good at her job.\n\nELLE: We've seen some transference between Paul and his patients. Are we going to be seeing that with Adele?\n\nAR: Do you really want me to tell you? [laughs] I shouldn't tell you....\n\nELLE: I understand—doctor-patient confidentiality. This is the first season of the show that isn't based on the Israeli series BeTipul, so the team is creating something totally new. Was that scary?\n\nAR: No, it wasn't because the writers are extraordinary. Adam Raff, a New York playwright, and Dan Futterman and Anya Epstein, our head writers, are all great. I worked with Danny before on Capote and Anya on an episode of Homicide years ago. So I knew I would definitely be in good hands.\n\nELLE: The show is such an intense character study. Is it tough to tape all those long scenes just sitting in a chair, talking back and forth?\n\nAR: Each script is like a one-act play really, and we joke that our big action sequence is someone getting up to open the door, so there's a challenge in keeping the energy going and to keep really listening. Also, playing a therapist I have to ask myself these questions: What do you react to? What do you show? What don't you show?\n\nELLE: You're also returning to The Office this season as Holly, Michael's lost love. As recently as this spring, you said you didn't know if you were coming back. What changed?\n\nAR: The opportunity came and the scheduling worked. Because the public knows that Steve Carrell is leaving the show, I was stopped on the street by people demanding that Holly and Michael get back together. [laughs] I was walking down the street in New York, honest to God, seven months pregnant, and this woman stopped me and said, \"You have to go back to Michael! He's your soul mate!\" There was no acknowledgment of this massive belly I was carrying around or that I may have another life—just the demand that I get back to my soul mate.\n\nELLE: Viewers really fall in love with these characters.\n\nAR: I will admit, it's so intoxicating working with Steve Carrell. Creatively and professionally.\n\nELLE: Do you know what's in store for Holly?\n\nAR: I'm not sure how they're getting her back to Scranton, but I hear they are. It all starts with a phone call. That much I know. Whatever happens between her and Mike, I don't think it will be easy—which is a good thing.\n\nELLE: Fans seem torn between Michael and Holly leaving the show together, off into the sunset together, and Holly staying to take over Michael's job.\n\nAR: Wouldn't that be so harsh if she comes back to the office, then gets a job offer, and they're like \"Bye! See ya!\" That would be cruel. [laughs] I don't envision Holly taking over.\n\nELLE: The Office fans are having the same reaction to Holly that The Wire fans had to Beadie, which was to have her come back and be with Jimmy McNulty.\n\nAR: Yeah, people were drawn to Beadie Russell. A lot of men really find that woman ideal. I think that's awesome.\n\nClick for more on Amy Ryan\n\nELLE: She was a breath of fresh air in The Wire's dark, polluted world. People really connected with that. Even though the show's been over for two years, do hard-core fans still approach you about it?\n\nAR: Yeah, and I'm so proud of that show that I have time for anyone who stops to say they love it, because I do too. It was such an extraordinary social study of our country, and at the time we could feel it. We knew the show would be something that people would talk about for years to come. Even now, it's being taught as a class at Harvard. That's awesome.\n\nELLE: You play a lot of working-class characters—in Jack Goes Boating, The Wire, Gone Baby Gone. Are you drawn to those sorts of characters?\n\nAR: I am, actually. I come from a working-class background in Queens, New York. So it's definitely within my wheelhouse. Those parts feel richer to me, more dynamic. And it's also what comes my way.\n\nELLE: You've also been part of some very different on-screen romances—with Jack in Jack Goes Boating, McNulty in The Wire, and of course Michael Scott. In real life, which of those characters would you date?"
