        "text": "At the beginning, there’s fog, there’s always fog. Down at the Port of Baltimore, let’s call it sea-mist. In the mist you see the shapes of large, blundering things, like sea-monsters. You need to wait, to see what these monsters are going to be, when the mist clears.\n\nThe Wire season 2 is generally the least-regarded, though not by me. It’s the outlier, the one least connected from the ongoing thread of events in Baltimore, that enters here when the audience was expecting some form of more-of-the-same-only, and exits after twelve episodes without recurring. It spreads its field of vision wide. It’s about the Port, and how it is dying, and so too is industry and the simplicity, the safety of working with your hands.\n\nSo we see a lot of threads, spread about, and we’re left to make connections between them for ourselves. David Simon and Ed Burns have taken to heart the advice given by James Tiptree Jr, SF writer: “Begin at the end, preferably 25,000 feet underground, then DON’T EXPLAIN!”\n\nLet’s sum up the directions we’re heading. Beadie Russell, having found 13 dead hookers, suffocated, finds no-one wants to claim responsibility for solving a baker’s dozen whodunnits. Easier if they’re natural causes. Throw in one disgruntled Marine Police and former Detective named McNulty, and soon enough those cases can be proven to be murder, and not just murder but the jurisdiction of the Baltimore City Police Homicide unit, commander Colonel Bill Rawls. The partnership of Bunk Moreland and Lester Freamon finds a certain black humour in it, until Sgt. Landsman makes them eat the cases.\n\nAh, McNulty. Drinks fourteen Jamesons, turns up at Rhonda Pearlman’s house at 2.00am. He’s too drunk to fuck her then and too hungover to fuck her in the morning so what does she get out of it? Jimmy’s also too drunk not to tell her his wife Elena wants them to get back together, try again, for the sake of the kids.\n\nThen there’s the ignorant and petty little fuck that’s Major Valchek, who can’t see past the end of his nose even with binoculars. Because Frank Sobotka got in first with the stained glass window, Valchek’s determined to fuck him up. The IBS (International Brotherhood of Stevedores) can’t have raised the money legitimately, they’re dying, it must be dirty. Valchek gets, of all things, a new Detail. Only Pres carries over from the original one, and the standard is fairly represented by the reassignement of Detective ‘Who signs the overtime slips?’ Polk. Meanwhile, Valchek’s Division, under Sgt Carver, is hassling the Port workers over every little petty infraction that can come into Valchek’s pointy little head.\n\nSpeaking of Details, there’s Lt. Cedric Daniels, buried in Evidence Control, his career dead. His wife persuades him it’s time to hand in his papers, use his talents where they will be appreciated.\n\nAnd speaking of Sobotka and the IBS, yes, of course he’s in bed with what’s dirty. Frank doesn’t like the surprise of being connected of dead bodies but he’s happy to face down Valchek. A war starts.\n\nDid I say whodunnits? The case of the thirteen dead women – fourteen, don’t forget McNulty’s floater last week – is easily solved, but the Greek and Vondas have the advantage of knowledge not available to Bunk and Lester, not to mention interrogation techniques that a Court might call… questionable. Case solved. The Greek has lost fourteen girls, that’s four million, a year. But he is not worried. There are always more girls.\n\nBut let us not forget the first season, even though that’s now a very much secondary thread. Barksdale in prison, still guiding his empire, via Strinbger on the outside. Wee-Bay getting hassle from a guard who thinks that just because they’re in prison, he’s got the upper hand. And d’Angelo, carrying the weight of a twenty, not exactly full of family feeling.\n\nShapes in the fog, some more clear of design than others. Outlines, to be filled in. Connections to be made, or not as the case may be. And reviewers on imdb complaining that it wasn’t exactly the same as everything else so they knew what was going on. Tchah!"
