        "text": "Avon's time in the Maryland state prison is bookended by two impressive outfits. Arrested at the end of series one, he is led away from Orlando's in a cream, Kangol, short-sleeved track top and matching baggy three-quarter-length trousers, like some sort of drug-dealing Edwardian golfer with a penchant for neutrals.\n\nOn his release, in this episode, he climbs into Stringer's SUV clutching a box of freshly packed and pressed clothes to replace his prison-issue denims. \"Ah yeah, you got my shit,\" he grins. Next scene the car cruises down a country road back to Baltimore as Avon tosses his jail clothing out the window.\n\nClothes, for those high enough up the ranks, are important to the Barksdale crew. You see this in the first season when D'Angelo spends an age colour-coordinating his essentially similar clothes from a well-stocked closet before a date with Shardene.\n\nNotably, and despite initial appearances, this fits into Freamon's earlier assessment that Avon (and by extension his crew) shows \"no flash ... no jewellery, no clothes\". It's streetwear - albeit in abundance - not \"flash\". Compare this to the ostentatious leather coat with the fur trim Ziggy splashes out on in season two, the one that leads Nick Sobotka to chastise him for flaunting his ill-gotten wealth.\n\nSo far, so gangster. But who knew before The Wire that plainclothes Baltimore pOlice gave such high regard to their attire? In season two, episode three, Landsman directs port police liaison Beadie Russell to step out of uniform: \"We work plainclothes in homicide, which is not to say the clothes need be plain.\" He points out Freamon's \"brash, tweedy impertinence\" and Bunk's \"pinstriped, lawyerly affections\". He suggests she wear a pantsuit in \"earth tones\".\n\nBeadie aside (maybe adding more ammunition to the argument that The Wire's female characters are less interestingly portrayed than its men), character-through-dress extends throughout the police department. Look at the peacockish braids and buttons of the senior officers.\n\nOn the non-unformed side, Carver's clothes become sharper, more fitted, more metrosexual as he moves up the ranks. His signature look is his police badge worn as a medallion.\n\nBut not McNulty, defiantly in the uniform of the regular guy. Square-jawed Dominic West is possibly too much the Hollywood leading man, so that anything other than casual-fit jeans and T-shirts with the occasional suit could strain credibility. Still, this leads to comedy. From the end of season two, as Bunk talks McNulty through the buttons on a suspect's Perry Ellis blazer, comes the following quote:\n\nMcNulty: You know what they call a guy who pays that much attention to his clothes, don't you?\n\nBunk: Um hm. A grown-up.\n\nThere's plenty more: McNulty's awkward pre-court shopping trip with Omar (he buys a tie but wears it flamboyantly, ie not with a suit), Bunk in a pink shirt on his clothes-burning night of marital infidelity and, only marginally less slapstick, Omar's efforts to carry a gun in his silk dressing gown.\n\nBut back to Avon's real post-incarceration outfit, the one that complements the golfer-attire of his arrest. The crux of this episode is the change in the relationship between Avon and Stringer. Early on Stringer has assembled the Baltimore gangs in order to hammer out the deal that sets up the cooperative. \"No beef, no drama, just business,\" he tells Prop Joe and others. \"Anyone who got problems with anyone here, you bring it to the group - we ain't got to take it to the street.\"\n\nAt Avon's homecoming party a few days after (see video above), the two are both dressed, ostensibly, in evening wear - each is wearing a dress shirt with wing-tipped collars. But where Avon (and I wish I could get away with this) wears his shirt open-necked with a lightly-pinstriped grey single-breasted suit and white sneakers, Stringer is in full black tie. Avon: dressed successful but with a nod to the street; Stringer: bow tie and tuxedo, the uniform of an American CEO at a function. If there is a single moment that visually encapsulates the tensions that will lead the two to betray each other, this is it. Stringer, tragically naive, believes he can leverage criminal wealth into legitimacy. Avon will never leave the security of what he knows, the game.\n\nFavourite quote: Stringer when he spots minute-taker Shamrock at the co-op meeting: \"Are you taking notes on a criminal fucking conspiracy? What the fuck is you thinking!\" Shamrock's reply: \"I thought the rules said you had to take minutes at a meeting.\"\n\nRunning totals\n\nMurders: up one to 45. Sapper and Gerard beat an errant dealer to death, although Cutty had only wanted them to beat him until he recognised he had to pay up what he owed to the Barksdales. Not to make this summary of the episode too neat, but he and his shopping bag-laden girlfriend Uniqua had been seen spending too much on clothes and jewellery.\n\nMcNulty giving a fuck when it's not his turn: McNulty is on official Stringer-following time, so not so much. Frustratingly for Jimmy, Stringer only travels from college to building site to photocopy shop. He regretfully tells Prez: \"Mr Bell has become the bank.\" So still 21. Drunk: yes! Sort of. At least, there is drink involved. Bored by serious talk at an open evening for a school his ex-wife wants to send their sons to he moves to the bar and flirts with Terri D'Agostino. She sleeps with him. Up one to 15. Dubious parenting: see above. Up one to six.\n\nBunk drunk: still five.\n\nHerc fuck-ups: still seven and a half.\n\nOmar stick-ups: still seven."
