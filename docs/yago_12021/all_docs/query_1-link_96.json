The ethical impulse and its determination has recently gained considerable intellectual attention, as many in the academy seek to understand the moral challenges and opportunities their own subject area presents. This series, which ﬂows naturally from Liverpool Hope University’s unique mission, is distinctive in its multidisciplinary range and encompasses arts and humanities, social sciences, business and education. Each volume is informed by the latest research and poses important questions for academics, students and all those who wish to reﬂect more deeply on the values inherent within different disciplines. Bringing together international subject specialists, the series explores the complexities of ethics, its theoretical analysis and its practical applications and through the breadth of contributing subjects, demonstrates that understanding ethics is central to contemporary scholarship.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nI am grateful to everyone who has contributed to, or supported this book, and I would particularly like to acknowledge the patience of my contributors, my series editor David Torevell, and the staff at Cambridge Scholars Press, especially Carol Koulikourdi. Christopher Pipe was an invaluable proof-reader. Throughout, Liverpool Hope University has been unwavering in its support of research, made evident by its funding which has made this volume and the series possible\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAt ﬁrst glance, “ethics” is not necessarily a subject conventionally associated with ﬁlm. Film is often regarded as a form of “lowbrow” popular culture, either offering bland entertainment or deliberately setting out to shock – or, more cynically, generate box ofﬁce revenue – through gratuitous inclusion of sex and violence. There have always been a minority of ﬁlms based on the stereotypically “ethical” subject of religion, although these have often generated the most controversy, from the studio system decree that it was blasphemous to represent the corporeal body of Christ to the furore surrounding Martin Scorsese’s The Last Temptation of Christ (1988); more recently, scholarship has investigated issues such as disability (Pointon, 1997), representations of children (Mills & Mills, 2000) and of animals (Burt, 2002) . This book, however, will show that from the classical studio era to the present day, ﬁlm has been inherently concerned with ethical issues. This is well illustrated by the chapters’ range of subject matters. Felicity Hand examines Bollywood as a space for the resolution of issues of fundamentalism and ethnic violence; Beth Johnson, through her reading of Patrice Chéreau’s Intimacy (2001) considers the signiﬁcance of different types of intimacy such as emotional, physical, verbal and nonverbal; Peter Krämer investigates A Clockwork Orange’s (Stanley Kubrick, 1971) success and reception; John Keefe analyses the role of the spectator as a decision maker in the process of engagement with ﬁlm; Jacqui Miller presents a study of the production and exhibition history of the groundbreaking American ﬁlm Confessions of a Nazi Spy (Anatole Litvak, 1939); Joseph Schaub takes a revisionist perspective of John Waters’ Dreamland collaborations with Divine, Brian Neve assesses motivations of those caught up in Hollywood’s blacklist during the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) investigations, and Roshan Singh evaluates moral ambiguities surrounding characterizations of the detective in the HBO series The Wire. These chapters encompass a wide time frame from the 1930s (Miller), the 1950s (Neve), the 1970s (Schaub and Krämer) to the contemporary\n\n2\n\nFilm and Ethics\n\nera (Johnson, Hand, Singh), a broad range of cinematic practice from the classical studio era (Miller), American mid-century independent work (Neve), American underground cinema (Schaub) the British/American renaissance (Krämer), contemporary art-house (Johnson), and Bollywood (Hand). A range of national productions is also presented from American (Miller, Schaub, Singh, Neve), British-American (Krämer), Anglo-French (Johnson), and Indian (Hand). It is also the case that several of the chapters address visual forms that cannot be narrowly conscribed. The Wire is a TV series, but shares many cinematic concepts and techniques, while Keefe’s study of the spectator draws on theories that may be equally well applied to live drama as to ﬁlm. Indeed this point of multiplicity is highlighted by contributors. Keefe’s chapter exempliﬁes this in its ranging across ﬁlm history and nationality from the classical musical (South Paciﬁc) to the French New Wave (Cleo from 5 to 7, Weekend) to the Hitchcock thriller (Psycho) to the modern musical (Sweeney Todd) and this breadth is captured by a deﬁnition of one chapter’s subject: many popular Indian ﬁlms are referred to as masala, originally a blend of spices, indicating the variety of different elements – music, song, dance, romance, action, comedy and drama – that can make up any one ﬁlm (Nayar, 2004: 14).\n\nNotwithstanding this range, links, commonalities and continuities may be seen across what might appear to be a disparate group of texts; several of the personnel involved in the making of Confessions of a Nazi Spy would, like Cyn Endﬁeld and Elia Kazin, the main protagonists of Neve’s chapter, be caught up in the HUAC investigations, and Neve’s references to the “spy cases” of the 1950s and the notion of studies of the HUAC years as a “moral detective story” makes his chapter a fulcrum between Confessions of a Nazi Spy and The Wire; Johnson and Schaub both draw on French existentialist writings to underpin their arguments; Confessions of a Nazi Spy and A Clockwork Orange, although being made more than 30 years apart, were both produced by Warner Brothers, a studio with a long-standing reputation for courageous ﬁlmmaking. However, it remains to be demonstrated exactly how the works under consideration engage with ethics. It will be argued that this engagement has two principal elements. First, ﬁlm is an arena for the construction and transmission of meaning. As Hand has described, it creates a “space”, a space of which studio production chief Jack Warner was well aware when he told the New York Times that “the visual power of the screen is tremendous”. But it\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nwould be simplistic simply to see the ﬁlmic text of itself as a discrete entity, the sole purveyor of meaning; there are many agencies involved in a ﬁlm’s construction, transmission and reception, all of which contribute their own perspectives and ethics, and agencies to be considered include the ﬁlmmaker (an entity not limited to the producer or director), cinematic technique, characterization which is aligned to but also distinct from the actors playing their parts, the ﬁlm industry and regulatory bodies such as America’s pre-1968 Production Code Administration (PCA) and the UK’s British Board of Film Censors as well as government bodies such as HUAC, the contextualizing society and the ﬁlm audience. It should also be borne in mind that these are not necessarily static categories. For example, a ﬁlm such as Confessions of a Nazi Spy was made at a time when the PCA narrowly proscribed ﬁlm content (or at least attempted to do so) meaning that ﬁlms, once having a PCA seal of approval, were available for a whole-family audience. As Krämer describes, in America at least this changed in 1968 with the demise of the PCA and the introduction of the ratings system which restricted not so much subject matter, but the age of intended audiences. In the West, these changes may have taken place towards the end of that decade of cultural upheaval, the 1960s, but, as Hand points out, Bollywood ﬁlms made today have to be as careful as the makers of Confessions of a Nazi Spy 70 years ago: Mainstream ﬁlms in the subcontinent are designed to cater for such a wide range of age groups, social classes, caste afﬁliations, and a multiplicity of ethno-religious backgrounds that delicate areas like sexuality and communalism need to be treated with the utmost caution for fear of causing offense. (Gokulsing & Dissanayaka, 1998).\n\nMoreover, each historical period, from the perspective of its own inevitably subjective stance, will tend to revise judgements that once seemed ﬁxed, for example, ﬁlms granted “R” (in the United States) or “X” (in the UK) upon their original release have seen this modiﬁed upon their subsequent DVD launch as perspectives on what is suitable viewing, and for whom, change across time. Indeed, this leads into the second strand of the argument about ﬁlm’s relationship with ethics. Throughout the chapters, certain terms recur, sometimes being the titular focus. Krämer writes of A Clockwork Orange’s “transgressiveness”, echoed closely by Schaub’s references to “shock value”, and Johnson’s attention to “new extreme” ﬁlmmaking. Seemingly conversely in relation to these culturally oppositional expressions, Miller makes claims for the “courage” of Warners in making Confessions of a Nazi Spy, and Neve considers the “morality” of those considering their responses\n\n4\n\nFilm and Ethics\n\nto the blacklist. However, as if to demonstrate that meaning is always in ﬂux, not only across time, Singh considers the “moral ambiguity” of the detective, while Hand acknowledges that a “moral code” may be aligned to “deception”. Throughout the chapters, and indeed throughout cinema, the driving narrative force hinges upon decision-making: Intimacy opens with Jay’s decision to try and end a relationship over which he seems to have no control; Warner Brothers had to decide whether to defy the PCA’s strictures to go ahead and make Confessions of a Nazi Spy; Cy Endﬁeld and Elia Kazan had to decide whether or not to follow their conscience with regard to HUAC; Keefe posits the spectator as a “decision maker”. However, in each instance what might have been a decision becomes what Hand describes (in her section “the undecidable decides”) as “a terrible dilemma”. There are always at least two alternatives between which the decision-maker is pulled, recalling Hanna Schmitz’s (Kate Winslet) cry “What would you have done?” to the prosecuting counsel in The Reader (Stephen Daldry, 2008). As a working class woman in Nazi Germany, Hanna made what was to her a rational decision to take employment that would earn her keep and also hide the illiteracy of which she is bitterly ashamed – so ashamed that she would ultimately face life imprisonment rather than have it revealed. That this work happened to be as an SS guard shows the subjectivity of an ethical perspective, and also forces the spectator to search their own conscience; Schmitz doing her job as a guard would have been an ethical given within the Nazi regime. Of course Nazism was evil, but The Reader posits the uncomfortable possibility that at least some of those who, like Schmitz, were caught up in its practices might not have been evil but just pragmatic. How many people today, who fully recognize the evil of Nazism, would necessarily have had the courage to stand against it if they had been in Schmitz’ position? Indeed, Neve draws on this analogy when he quotes Cy Endﬁeld’s conundrum as he considers whether or not to testify to HUAC: And I thought of the situation of being in Germany, and your best friend was a Jewish doctor who saved your life as a child. And you are coming down the street, and he is being kicked to death by a bunch of SS and Nazi activists. If you don’t put your own foot in they say, “Well, what’s wrong with you, you are under suspicion” (Neve, 1989: 120).\n\nThis book will take as its central theme the difﬁculty of decisions refracted through personal ethical codes, and will thus recognize that what counts as ethics, or morality, is always subjective and the product of a range of competing ethical perspectives which will now be examined.\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nIt might be presumed that in the making of a ﬁlm (or television programme), the principal guiding force, or ethical vision belongs to the director (supported by the producer and production personnel) and the cast will channel this idea. Certainly most of the chapters are concerned with those who have been known either for a distinctive visual style or for an ideological outlook, each often informing and heightening the other. Stanley Kubrick was a highly inﬂuential maverick director who was far too individualistic to ever be categorized as part of a distinct ﬁlm movement; his box ofﬁce success with “two of the highest grossing blockbusters of all time (Spartacus in 1960 and 2001: A Space Odyssey in 1968)” allowing him an extraordinary degree of autonomy in his work. John Waters in his early career, working with his Dreamland cast, particularly leading lady Divine, in their hunger for fame, developed, counter to Hollywood gloss, “a code that was at once an aesthetic principle, a marketing strategy, and an ethical practice”. Although corresponding to the art house rather than underground ﬁlmmaking, Patrice Chéreau also seeks to push back ﬁlmic boundaries in his “explorative extreme cinema”. The players in the HUAC drama used their ﬁlmmaking as an opportunity, before and after the inquisition, to make overt political commentary. Although the decisions through which Elia Kazin’s characters worked before HUAC might not have appeared to represent an analogy to their director’s personal choices, for instance Pinky’s choice (Pinky, 1949) to remain within her black identity despite her greater freedom in being able to pass for white, his subsequent account of his own decision to inform merges the desire for fame with a seemingly genuine adherence to an individual code that marked Waters’ stance: “I think of the choices I had, that was the right choice . . . As a matter of fact, as the years pass, I’ve been rather pleased with myself for what I did.” Throughout the studio era, or at least until FDR’s death, Warner Brothers was known as the social conscience studio, making ﬁlms defending the “underdog” in American society, and making critical commentary on abuses in American society as well as implying where America should intervene internationally, whatever ire it might incur from the PCA. Confessions’ producer, Hal Wallis, commented: “Because Jack Warner and I were deeply concerned over the crisis in Europe in the late 1930s, we decided to undertake a policy of opposition to Nazism in our pictures, despite the very strong possibility that isolationist elements in America would surely criticise us”, a stance that probably unanimously reﬂects the attitude of all those involved in the production on both sides of the camera. HBO, producers of The Wire, has been seen as inheriting the mantle of Warners’ studio-era crusading as a company that “enlightens, enriches, challenges, involves and confronts. It dares to take risks, it’s honest\n\n6\n\nFilm and Ethics\n\nand illuminating, it appeals to the intellect and touches the emotions. It requires concentration and attention, and it provokes thought” (Thomson, 1997: 13). Whilst deliberately dealing in controversial subject matters, the ﬁlmmakers discussed in Hand’s chapter remain aware of “the ever vigilant Censor Board which will order the deletion of scenes considered to be unnecessarily provocative” (Ganti, 2004). This is a reminder that ﬁlmmakers necessarily practise within the constraints of the ﬁlm industry and its regulatory bodies, including governmental controls which may set up contrary or at least competing ethical visions around a ﬁlm. In 1939, both Franklin Roosevelt and Warners faced regulatory strictures. Roosevelt was hampered in his desire to assist Britain and France by a climate of appeasement and isolationism, but sought to negotiate with Congress to revise neutrality legislation, referring by implication to the individual’s ethical code: “I cannot ask that every American remain neutral in thought . . . Even a neutral cannot be asked to close his mind or his conscience”. Warners’ institutional opposition was threefold. First, the Hays Ofﬁce, a body charged with overseeing ﬁlm regulation since the silent era, objected that the ﬁlm would lose Hollywood revenues, as it would alienate German-Americans in the United States and also the Axis and neutral nations overseas. Second, the German Consul in Los Angeles, George Gysell, raised objections with the third regulatory opponent of the ﬁlm, PCA chief Joseph I. Breen. Although the PCA had a strict list of precluded ﬁlm subjects, of which foreign commentary was one, as an anti-Semite, Breen’s own personal beliefs clashed with those of the Confessions production team, foreshadowing the religious clashes which Hand describes in her chapter on Bollywood. Made at another phase in the history of censorship, as the PCA had given way to the ratings system, censorship, or responses to it, has a prominent role in the cultural meaning given to A Clockwork Orange. An “R” certiﬁcate would have meant that children under 17 could have seen the ﬁlm if accompanied by an adult, thus generating potentially much greater box ofﬁce receipts, whereas an “X” certiﬁcate would have limited audiences to those over 18. It is likely that Kubrick’s auteur status and consistent box ofﬁce results enabled him to remain within his directorial vision, or ethical code, and insist that the ﬁlm retained its original content, rather than being tamed by cuts: “Kubrick is thought to have had ﬁnal cut rights on Clockwork so WB couldn’t have battled the rating if it had wanted to” (Anon., 1971). However, added to this is the studio context of Warner Brothers. The social conscience studio of the 1930s, described by Groucho Marx during the making of Confessions as the only studio with “guts”, underwent a renaissance in this regard during the late 1960s/early 1970s, giving a comparatively free rein to directors. As Variety\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nnoted of Clockwork’s certiﬁcate in the article quoted above: “Warners is the only major [studio] to have two X features this year, with most of the other companies doing their utmost to avoid the rating” (Anon., 1971). Facing investigation by a federal government agency rather than a regulatory body, Neve’s protagonists also show the multivalence of ethics. It is stereotypical to see “friendly” witnesses to HUAC, those who named colleagues, as standing outside the pale; however, ethical considerations must mean listening to the range of voices. Kazin captures the lack of certainty that is part of the ethical concept: “I was trying to show that right and wrong get mixed up, and that there are values that have to be looked at more deeply than in that absolute approval-or-disapproval syndrome of my Left friends” (Ciment, 1973: 121). This sense of randomness, that meaning is constructed and imposed rather than inherent, is important too for Johnson’s work: “The problem is that censors create the concept of obscenity” (Brooks, 2001). At a more macro level, every ﬁlm reﬂects its wider social context. Film is one of the richest sources for the cultural historian, providing not only a snapshot of the modes of speech, fashions and landscape of the times, but more importantly their mood, atmosphere and dominant ideology. It is likely that certain ﬁlms are the product of a particular moment and could not have been made earlier, and probably not later. As Krämer points out, A Clockwork Orange was made at a time in cinema history when taboo-breaking ﬁlms had popular success. This is partly due to the dynamics of the ﬁlm industry in an era when directors were given unprecedented freedom, but that in itself is tied to American society’s receptivity for such ﬁlms in the context of the Vietnam War and the Nixon presidency. Just as the violence of A Clockwork Orange can stand as a metaphor for war, so too a ﬁlm set in the historical past may make commentary on its own present day. Neve considers a range of ﬁlms which made metaphorical commentary on HUAC, from the biblical epic The Robe (Henry Koster, 1953), to a Western, High Noon (Fred Zinnemann, 1952), to American and French noirs, Pickup on South Street (Samuel Fuller, 1953) and Riﬁﬁ (Jules Dassin, 1955), to a contemporary social commentary, The Underworld Story (Cy Endﬁeld, 1950), as well as On the Waterfront (1954), which may be read as a line-by-line defence for director Elia Kazin’s (and screenwriter, Budd Schulberg and cast member Lee J. Cobb) act of informing. That ﬁlm is able to act through metaphor underscores its status as a space or arena in which marginalized groups may confront dominant ideology. Intimacy depicts “a distinctly British . . . part of social alienation in the 21st century” – just as A Clockwork Orange did in 1972. Likewise, Waters’ Dreamlanders are his “hippie outcast friends”, whilst The Wire, like Waters’ ﬁlms set in Baltimore some 30-plus years on, focuses on “the lower echelons\n\n8\n\nFilm and Ethics\n\nof the community”. What is evident is that these outsiders have their own moral or ethical codes, perhaps contrary to those of the mainstream, but which necessarily expose hegemonic control. Just as A Clockwork Orange is redolent of the hypocrisy of a society which condemns those who enjoy violence whilst its government is supporting an undeclared colonial war in Vietnam, The Wire imbues drug dealers and petty criminals with a certain nobility for remaining within their “no snitching” code whilst they are in fact “dispensable commodities to be utilised like fodder, signed up to die like soldiers” – an analogy with the conﬂict in Iraq, ever lurking on the series’ margins. As Keefe suggests, “any discussion of ﬁlm needs to treat the ﬁlm as something in itself – a textual object”. Thus the construction of ﬁlm through cinematic technique is aligned to previously discussed notions of ambiguity and deception, particularly with regard to issues of truth, reality and authenticity, and will lead on to considerations of the agency of characters and their relationship with actors “playing” or performing these parts. Jean-Luc Godard’s comment that “Cinema is truth 24 frames per second, and every cut is a lie” is echoed by Michael Haneke: “ﬁlm is a lie at 24 frames per second”. If all non-documentary ﬁlms are ﬁction, which is the more “truthful”: the classical studio ﬁlm which effaces technique and purports to be reality, or the art house picture which foregrounds its technique and therefore its textuality but equally remains a work of artiﬁce? Moreover, what is the ethical code propelling the choice? The production team on Confessions of a Nazi Spy went to great lengths to make a picture which was rendered “realistic” by incorporating actual documentary footage and a documentary-style narrator. Every detail was made as accurate as possible, but some of the highly deceptive methods needed to achieve this – the use of a miniature camera, photostatting German Bund literature, and the mooted possibility of joining the Bund – were surely antithetical to the ostensible ethical code of the team, practices that indeed replicated the very actions of the “spies” that were the ﬁlm’s subject. This clearly brings into focus the liminality of ethics. Film technique or an “aesthetic principle” was also central for John Waters. This is explored through the shocking images in Multiple Maniacs. For Waters, everything seen is real. Some of the activities are incontrovertibly authentic but others may be staged, which again calls into question whether faithfulness to a code (in this case, Waters’ self styled “code of ﬁlth”) is provable. Implicit in the discourse between authenticity and ethics is the tension between the actor and the character. As Singh notes: “Although characters are not human beings, they are the agents through which human disposition is explored that enables the audience to experience emotions that may be attractive\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nor repulsive.” Within classical cinema, although the audience is invited to suspend disbelief there remains a tacit understanding that an actor is playing a part. However, ﬁlm that sets out to push boundaries, such as that of Waters, or Johnson’s “new extreme” cinema, may, as Johnson puts it, “blur the boundaries between performance and the real”. Like Waters’ shocking sights, some of the sex acts in Intimacy are palpably real, and performed for the ﬁrst time within a British mainstream art-house ﬁlm. This new authenticity causes “a disruption between actor and character”. Because the actor is physically performing an act, are they themselves or their character having the experience and is it indeed possible to draw an effective demarcation? Returning once more to the construction of meaning through cinematic technique, Johnson refers to “non-sensational camerawork” ﬁxing “the perspective of the spectator”. Ultimately, it is the spectator or audience that remains the ﬁnal part of the equation of ﬁlm and ethics, particularly with regard to constructions of reality: “The fact remains that viewing suffering is especially problematic when the object of suffering is presumed to be real” (Boltanski 1991: 23). Similarly, for Schaub, Waters’ construction of authentically “real”, shocking acts, challenges the audience’s ethics, in this context, a sense of “decency”: “Rather than recoil in disgust, however, we watch intently. We, therefore, if we reﬂect upon it, are forced to acknowledge that we are not decent people.” Keefe’s phrase “the spectator as decision maker” invokes one of the pivots – the decision – of this book’s discussion of ethics and ﬁlm. Certainly, ﬁlm may seek to construct meaning for the spectator, drawing on a mutually recognized experience of “reality”, and this may be a necessary function of the ﬁlmmaker’s own code. As Nick Roddick points out in the discussion of Confessions of a Nazi Spy, “almost every scene has the feeling of an invisible presence – that of the ordinary American viewer at whom the dialogue is really aimed”. Classical cinematic technique relies on this relationship between spectator and character: The camera is such a persuasive tool and the absurd idea in ﬁction of a ‘central character’ so ﬂattering to our sense of individuality that we respond intuitively to anyone who is deemed worthy of close-ups, or who is honoured with the responsibility of providing a voice-over. (Gilbey, 2003: 200)\n\nThis practice can be used to unsettle rather than comfort. As Keefe shows, ﬁlms such as Psycho (Alfred Hitchcock, 1960) and Peeping Tom (Michael Powell, 1960), through their point of view shots, place the audience in the position of voyeurism, and Krämer points out that one of the ethical dilemmas within A Clockwork Orange is that it “aligns the viewer” with\n\n10\n\nFilm and Ethics\n\n“an extremely violent young criminal . . . throughout his crimes”. Despite the spectator’s unease at implied identiﬁcation with a killer, or engagement with scopophilia, to believe that the camera constructs a stance that cannot be challenged presents the dichotomous position that on the one hand, a spectator’s own code of ethics is transgressed by the activities with which they are “forcibly” aligned, whilst at the same time they are liberated to enjoy this spectacle – quite literally spectacle in the case of Bollywood, in which “episodes of violence and conspiracy are interspersed with song and dance routines” – because it has been “imposed”, thus retaining the sense that their code remains unsullied, or as Lietch says in discussion of The Wire, “the central function of the crime ﬁlm [is] to allow viewers to experience the vicarious thrills of criminal behaviour, whoever is practicing it, as immoral”. Keefe sums it up: “we watch the otherwise un-watch-able”. However, spectators remain “decision makers”. As Johnson suggests, “a “morally neutral” perspective is impossible. Taking account of each individual’s personal experience and place in history, all those involved in the production and reception of a ﬁlm will make an interpretation that responds to their own subjective but equally ﬂawed and valid code of ethics.\n\nReferences Anon. 1971a. ‘“X” for Clockwork: WB Must Accept “As Is” of Kubrick’, Variety 15 December.

First they mock and beat up a homeless drunk, then they do battle with another gang who were about to rape a young woman in an abandoned theatre, and after that they steal a car. Finally the gang’s leader, Alex, who from the outset has provided a running voice-over commentary on the action using a peculiar slang, talks his way into a house in the countryside, where the four proceed to beat up a man and to make him watch while they rape his wife. Alex returns home and listens to Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. The next morning, he tells his parents that he cannot go to school because he does not feel well. He is visited by his social worker, after which he goes to a record shop where he picks up two young women with whom he proceeds to have sex in his room. He then meets the rest of his gang. An argument ensues and Alex asserts his authority by beating up two gang members. Afterwards, he breaks into the house of a middle-aged woman; he gets into a ﬁght with her and batters her to death with the sculpture of a giant phallus. Waiting outside the house, the other gang members betray him. One of them hits him in the face with a bottle before the police arrive to arrest him. This is the action – much of it presented in a very graphic manner – of the ﬁrst third of Stanley Kubrick’s ﬁlm A Clockwork Orange, which was released in the United States in December 1971. Within a few weeks of its release, the ﬁlm was named Best Motion Picture of 1971 by the New York Film Critics Association, and Kubrick won in the category Best Direction (Steinberg, 1980: 269). The ﬁlm was also listed as one of the year’s ten best movies by the New York Times and Time magazine, and it was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Director and Adapted Screenplay (Steinberg, 1980: 175, 179, 246). By the end of its long run in American theatres, the ﬁlm had earned $17 million in rentals, which made\n\n12\n\nPeter Krämer\n\nit the seventh highest grossing title among the 432 ﬁlms released in the US in 1971 (Krämer, 2005: 108; Steinberg, 1980: 43). It would seem, then, that despite its intensely transgressive opening sequence and the equally transgressive rest of the story (in which Alex escapes all punishment in the end), A Clockwork Orange was at – or close to – the very heart of American ﬁlm culture in the early 1970s. However, the critical reception of A Clockwork Orange was by no means unanimously positive; quite on the contrary, the ﬁlm was highly controversial. Indeed, A Clockwork Orange featured prominently in the Harvard Lampoon’s long-running “Movie Worsts” awards. It headed the list of the year’s “Ten Worst Movies”, while “the entire Society of New York Film Critics” won the award intended to identify “the ﬁlm critic whose writing has most consistently explored the limits of bad taste” for naming A Clockwork Orange the best ﬁlm of the year (Steinberg, 1980: 330). Critical attacks went beyond matters of taste; as we will see later, several writers accused the ﬁlm and its supporters of promoting a nihilistic worldview which might encourage, in the world outside the movie theatre, both violent behaviour by members of the audience and political support for repressive state measures against such behaviour. Thus, A Clockwork Orange raises (at least) two very different ethical issues, one to do with the ﬁlm’s success, the other with the attacks on it. At ﬁrst sight, it is surely surprising that a ﬁlm which features so much explicit sex and graphic violence focuses on the actions and experiences of an extremely violent young criminal and aligns the viewer with this protagonist throughout his crimes, his punishment and his ﬁnal release from all constraints, could have been such a huge mainstream success. So how might we explain the success of this morally transgressive movie? In the ﬁrst section of this essay, I propose to answer this question by looking at hit patterns at the American box ofﬁce. I show that taboo-breaking ﬁlms such as A Clockwork Orange were very prominent in the box ofﬁce charts of this period, but not before and after. With regard to the attacks on the ﬁlm, I then examine the ﬁlm’s provocative marketing and the concerns expressed by ﬁlm reviewers and other commentators about its possible impact, starting with cautionary remarks by the ﬁlm’s supporters and ending with claims of its most vigorous detractors about the moral shortcomings of the ﬁlm and of its appreciative audiences.\n\n“Rape, Ultra-violence and Beethoven”\n\n13\n\nBox Ofﬁce Trends If we want to explain a ﬁlm’s box ofﬁce success, we can in principle distinguish between two different basic logics. On the one hand, a ﬁlm might build on existing hit patterns, intensifying a particular pattern or combining various patterns, so that it can appeal to the cinemagoers whose preferences were responsible for establishing these hit patterns in the ﬁrst place. On the other hand, a ﬁlm might be innovative and thus able to meet an established, or emerging, preference among (actual or potential) cinemagoers which had previously not been met by the ﬁlm industry’s output (Krämer, 2005: 38). The box ofﬁce success of A Clockwork Orange can best be explained with reference to both logics being at work at the same time. The ﬁlm built on several hit patterns established in the late 1960s, and these patterns in turn were innovative in meeting certain audience preferences that Hollywood had not previously catered for. When examining the annual charts of top grossing movies at the US box ofﬁce (Krämer, 2005: 105–14), A Clockwork Orange stands out in that initially received an “X” rating, which meant that, at ﬁrst, children under 17 were not allowed to see the ﬁlm in movie theatres (the rating was changed to “R” in August 1972).1 Before November 1968 there had been no ratings, because Hollywood regulated its output through the Production Code which for several decades had aimed to make all ﬁlms, in principle, uncontroversial and suitable for the whole family. However, already in 1966 the American ﬁlm industry’s major trade organization, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), had in effect suspended the Production Code, because it now allowed ﬁlms with previously prohibited material to be released as long as they carried the label “suggested for mature audiences”. In November 1968, the Code was ofﬁcially replaced with ratings which were determined by the ﬁlm industry’s Code and Rating Administration (CARA) which stipulated whether ﬁlms were suitable for children or not (Krämer, 2005: 47–9). Consequently, when many of the pre-1966 ﬁlms were rereleased from 1968 onwards, they mostly were rated “G”, which meant that they were considered suitable for all age groups, while quite a few ﬁlms from the years 1966 to 1968 were given more restrictive ratings. The “M” rating, (later changed to “GP” and then to “PG”) advised parents that a particular ﬁlm might contain elements unsuitable for their children. The “R” rating prevented children (initially under 16, from 1970 onwards under 17) from seeing the ﬁlm at a movie theatre unless they were accompanied by an adult. None of the annual top ten hits released up to and including 1968\n\n14\n\nPeter Krämer\n\nreceived an “X” rating upon re-release. Indeed, none of the top ten hits in the decades after 1973 was rated “X” or “NC-172 (the label which replaced the disreputable “X” in 1990). Yet from 1969 to 1973, in addition to A Clockwork Orange, the annual top ten lists included the following “X”-rated ﬁlms: the highly acclaimed contemporary Hollywood dramas Midnight Cowboy in 1969 (winning Oscars for Best Picture, Director and Adapted Screenplay) and Last Tango in Paris in 1973 (nominated for Best Director and Actor, but also listed as the year’s worst movie by the Harvard Lampoon), as well as the two non-Hollywood hardcore porn ﬁlms Deep Throat (1972) and The Devil in Miss Jones (1973).2 In addition to the presence of “X”-rated ﬁlms in the annual top tens, the late 1960s and early 1970s also saw the inclusion of increasingly transgressive material in “R”-rated movies. Indeed, with only minor changes, both A Clockwork Orange and Midnight Cowboy (a ﬁlm featuring, among other things, male prostitution, explicit sex scenes and homoeroticism) were re-released with an “R”. Other “R”-rated top ten ﬁlms of this period explored the connection between sex and violence which is so central to A Clockwork Orange. Rosemary’s Baby (1968) features a scene in which the drugged and only semi-conscious young wife is penetrated and inseminated by the devil himself. The story of Deliverance (1972) revolves around one of four river-rafting adventurers being raped by two local men. Then, 1973 saw the release not only of Last Tango in Paris, which blurred the lines between rape and consensual sex (especially in two scenes featuring anal penetration), but also of The Exorcist, the second highest grossing ﬁlm of the decade 1967–76 when revenues are adjusted for inﬂation (Krämer, 2005: 110). In this ﬁlm a 12-year-old girl, possessed by a male-identiﬁed demon, spouts incredibly graphic obscenities (such as “Your mother sucks cocks in hell”) and mimicks sexual behaviour, most shockingly when she violently stabs her genitals with a bloody cruciﬁx, doing so in front of her mother, whose face she then pushes into her crotch with the words “Lick me!” Nothing comparable has ever been seen in a major hit movie since then. The release of A Clockwork Orange in 1971 thus came midway through a short period of rapidly escalating depictions of sex, in particular sexual violence, in top ten movies. At the same time, the late 1960s and early 1970s saw the proliferation of hit movies that – just like A Clockwork Orange – dealt very sympathetically with criminals. A quantitative content analysis of a representative sample of top ten ﬁlms has shown that the share of major characters committing crimes rose from 27% in the period 1946–65 to 46% in the decade 1966–75, going down again to 38% for the period 1976–90;\n\n“Rape, Ultra-violence and Beethoven”\n\n15\n\nthe share of major characters resorting to violence (both criminal and legal) doubled from 19% to 38%, and then went down to 34% (Powers, Rothman and Rothman, 1996: 105). Among the top ten ﬁlms featuring criminals, in some cases extremely violent criminals, we ﬁnd Bonnie and Clyde (1967), a ﬁlm which was widely perceived at the time as marking the beginning of a new era in Hollywood history, the so-called “Hollywood Renaissance” or “New Hollywood” (Krämer, 2005: 1–2). It features two Depression era bank robbers who kill a bank employee, get into extended shoot-outs with the police and eventually die spectacularly in a hail of bullets. 1967 also saw the release of The Dirty Dozen, in which violent criminals are recruited for a suicide mission in France during World War II, culminating in a massive slaughter. Similarly violent criminals are at the centre of the heist and car chase movie The Getaway (1972), while the bank robber in Dog Day Afternoon (1975) is mainly concerned about getting money for the sex change operation of his male lover. Then there is, of course, The Godfather (1972), the ﬁfth highest grossing movie of the decade 1967–76, and its sequel from 1974. Both ﬁlms deal with the history of a crime family, featuring numerous murders of members of rival gangs and the police, and of traitors in the family’s own ranks. By comparison, the protagonist of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (1975), in a mental institution after having been arrested for statutory rape, starts out rather harmlessly but in the end brutally attacks the head nurse. The prisoners of The Longest Yard (1974) channel their violence into a football game against the guards, whereas those in Papillon (1973) do everything to escape. In addition, we have the glamorous pair of Robert Redford and Paul Newman in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and The Sting (1973), respectively the sixth and third highest grossing ﬁlms of the decade 1967–76. The former ﬁlm deals once again with robberies, a chase and the protagonists’ spectacular death, while the latter belongs to a cycle of hit movies dealing with small-time criminals. These include the con men (and con girl) of Midnight Cowboy and Paper Moon (1973) and the drug dealers of Easy Rider (1969). In many of these top ten ﬁlms, the criminals end up dead, even when they are as gentle as the Dustin Hoffman character in Midnight Cowboy or the two hippies riding across America in Easy Rider. At the same time, for most of the narrative, their life of crime is shown to be exciting, the criminals’ ﬁght against the police or prison guards heroic, their ﬁnal death tragic.3 A Clockwork Orange, which comes out midway through this decade of criminal hit movies, builds on established audience interest in ﬁlms about criminal outsiders, yet also offers several innovative twists. Rather than\n\n16\n\nPeter Krämer\n\nbeing in the service of larger criminal objectives (making money, taking revenge etc.), the initial violence executed by Alex and his gang is an end in itself; they are violent because they enjoy violence. In addition, unlike the other criminal hit movies, A Clockwork Orange foregrounds the pleasures of violence by mixing it with sex. Furthermore, unlike the endings of almost all top ten crime ﬁlms, A Clockwork Orange does not conclude with the protagonist’s punishment, nor with any other indication that crime does not pay. Instead the ﬁlm’s shocking opening third leads into an equally unsettling story in which Alex, now in prison, asks to become the test subject for a new medical procedure, the so-called Ludovico treatment, which combines the screening of violent ﬁlms with the injection of drugs so as to create in him a strong aversion against the mere thought of violent or sexual action (and, accidentally, also against Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony). The prison chaplain objects to this treatment on the grounds that it removes free will and thus, in his view, the patient’s very humanity. Once the treatment is completed Alex is released, only to ﬁnd that his parents have rented out his room and that he can’t defend himself when attacked by the drunk he once beat up, and by former gang members who have in the meantime joined the police. He takes refuge in the very house he had previously invaded; the wife he had raped is dead and her husband is in a wheelchair. When the husband belatedly realizes who Alex is, he drives him to a suicide attempt by playing Beethoven’s Ninth. This is also meant to serve as a political attack against the repressive government, yet backﬁres when Alex, now no longer under the inﬂuence of the Ludovico treatment, is co-opted by a representative of that government. The ﬁlm ends with Alex in hospital, listening to Beethoven and fantasizing about sex, while in his voice-over he says: “I was cured all right.” In the end, A Clockwork Orange’s criminal protagonist escapes his punishment so that he is free to pursue further sexual adventures and also, perhaps, to continue his criminal career, with government support no less. The ﬁlm’s enormous success derives to a considerable extent from the overall shift in hit patterns at the American box ofﬁce during the late 1960s and early 1970s, which – for the ﬁrst and last time in American ﬁlm history – brought “X”-rated ﬁlms, ﬁlms featuring explicit sex as well as graphic violence (including sexual violence), and movies with criminal protagonists to the top of the annual charts. The success of A Clockwork Orange was probably helped by the fact that it did not merely follow established patterns but also introduced innovations, notably the protagonist’s pursuit of violence for the sake of violence and the (for him) happy ending of the story.\n\n“Rape, Ultra-violence and Beethoven”\n\n17\n\nIf this analysis helps to understand the ﬁlm’s success, how might we understand the controversy surrounding it?\n\nThe Clockwork Controversy A Clockwork Orange was released by Warner Brothers in the United States on 19 December 1971, being initially shown in only four cities (Anon., 1971a). Such a narrow release shortly before the end of the year was typical for high proﬁle ﬁlms at the time, because it meant that they were fresh on people’s minds when various lists for the best ﬁlms of the year and the nominations for major awards were decided upon only a few weeks later. If a ﬁlm was successful with critics and industry peers, its selection as the best, or one of the best, ﬁlms of the year could then be used in the ﬁlm’s advertising when it was released into a larger number of movie theatres across the country – which is exactly what happened with A Clockwork Orange. Apart from the release date, the key decision in presenting A Clockwork Orange to the public was to go with the “X”-rating given to the ﬁlm by CARA, rather than re-editing it so as to get an “R” for the initial release (such re-editing only took place later in 1972). An article in Variety from 15 December 1971, which for the ﬁrst time announced that the ﬁlm was rated “X”, suggested that accepting the “X” may have been Kubrick’s decision, rather than that of the studio ﬁnancing and distributing the ﬁlm: “Kubrick is thought to have had ﬁnal cut rights on Clockwork so WB couldn’t have battled the rating if it wanted to”. If Kubrick did indeed have the extremely rare right to determine the “ﬁnal cut” of the ﬁlm, he must have gained it on the basis of his outstanding track record, having produced four commercial (as well as critical) hits in a row since 1960, comprising two moderate box ofﬁce successes (Lolita in 1962 and Dr. Strangelove in 1964) as well as two of the highest grossing blockbusters of all time (Spartacus in 1960 and 2001: A Space Odyssey in 1968) (Krämer, 2010: 32–3, 93). Irrespective of Kubrick’s contractual power, however, the Variety article implied that the ﬁlm’s distributor was quite willing to accept the “X” rating: “Warners is the only major [studio] to have two X features this year, with most of the other companies doing their utmost to avoid the rating”.4 Indeed, during the twelve months from November 1970 to October 1971, only three out of 238 ﬁlms submitted to CARA by the major studios and the leading “minors” had been rated “X”, that is only about 1% of their overall output; this was down from 4% in the preceding two years (Steinberg, 1980: 402). For the twelve months from November 1971 to October 1972, only\n\n18\n\nPeter Krämer\n\none ﬁlm submitted by the majors and leading minors received an “‘X”. This was A Clockwork Orange, for which CARA issued a ratings certiﬁcate on 15 December 1971, only four days before the ﬁlm’s release.5 Although Kubrick and Warner Brothers had probably been informed about CARA’s decision earlier than that, there must have been some uncertainty surrounding the “X” for A Clockwork Orange, because the initial print ads, radio spots and theatrical trailers, which were launched just over a week before the ﬁlm’s release, did not yet give any information about its rating (Anon., 1971a). Variety was apprehensive about its commercial implications: “The X-tag is known to cut into the number of dates a ﬁlm can play in the US, though what that means to ultimate boxofﬁce is difﬁcult to determine” (Anon., 1971a). Indeed, up to 50% of exhibitors in the US said they would refuse to show “X”-rated movies (according to a 1969 poll cited in Farber, 1972: 48; see also Farber and Changas, 1972, cited in Wyatt, 2000: 244). Thus, the “X” rating was very divisive, separating theatres willing to show ﬁlms with this rating from those that did not show them. A survey conducted in July 1973 suggested that cinema audiences were similarly divided (although we have to be careful about projecting these results back to the early months of the release of A Clockwork Orange; by July 1973 “X” had become closely associated with hardcore pornography: Wyatt, 2000). When a representative sample of people 18 and older were asked about their “least preferred type of movie”, the category “X-rated” received far more votes than any other (34% of the total; the second most prominent category was “‘Horror/Monster” with 23%) (Newspaper Advertising Bureau, 1974). Perhaps not surprisingly, women objected to “X”-rated ﬁlms more strongly than men did; 45% listed them as their least favorite ﬁlm type. Quite astonishingly, 10% of male respondents declared “X”-rated ﬁlms to be their “most preferred type of movie”.6 It would seem, then, that the “X” rating set both movie theatres and audience segments against each other, notably men against women. To some extent, the marketing campaign for A Clockwork Orange intensiﬁed the divisiveness of its rating. The theatrical trailer consisted of a rapid montage of extremely brief shots, in some cases consisting of only a few frames. It intercuts action taken from the ﬁlm, containing plenty of violence, with sexual imagery taken from poster art and words ﬂashing on the screen. Many of these words – such as “witty”, “comic”, “exciting”, “thrilling” – suggested that the ﬁlm would be a lot of fun, which one might ﬁnd to be ironic, provocative or plainly offensive. The ﬁlm’s main poster consisted of a painting of Alex staring at the viewer, while pushing a knife\n\n“Rape, Ultra-violence and Beethoven”\n\n19\n\ntowards them, above it the tagline: “Being the adventures of a young man whose principal interests are rape, ultra-violence and Beethoven.” (This was, in fact, reminiscent of the initial tagline for Warner Bros’ earlier groundbreaking hit Bonnie and Clyde: “They’re young . . . they’re in love . . . and they kill people”: Hoberman, 1998: 125).7 In some versions of the Clockwork Orange poster, the drawing of Alex was combined with that of an almost naked woman on her knees, leaning suggestively forward. By March 1972, this provocative marketing, together with a large amount of extremely hostile press commentary on the ﬁlm, resulted in a drastic measure taken by the Detroit News. Responding speciﬁcally to the release of A Clockwork Orange, the paper announced in a widely publicized editorial on 19 March that from 26 March it “no longer will publish display advertising [for] – or give editorial publicity to – X-rated motion pictures and those other unrated picures, which, in our judgment, are of a pornographic nature.”8 Among other things, this meant that the paper would no longer review “X”-rated ﬁlms. By this time about 30 American newspapers had a similar policy regarding ﬁlms rated “X” by CARA, considering them all as equivalent to hardcore pornography or “sadistic violence”, which they felt should in no way be supported (Anon., 1972a). At a time when print advertising for movies, together with the free publicity provided by articles in newspapers and magazines, was much more important than brief trailers or ﬁlm programmes shown on television (and also, probably, more important than poster displays and radio ads), this was a serious restriction. However, most of the thirty papers mentioned above most likely continued, as the Detroit News said it would, to offer minimal information about “X”-rated ﬁlms in their movie listings, and also to report on “general news developments concerning such pictures”; indeed, on 9 April 1972 the Detroit News printed a letter from Stanley Kubrick which attacked the paper’s policy and also offered a defence of A Clockwork Orange (Anon., 1972a). Thus, an “X”-rated ﬁlm like A Clockwork Orange would have neither ads nor reviews or puff pieces in many newspapers, yet if it was controversial enough or made the news in any other way, these papers would still have to report on it. Let’s take a look now at what exactly the ﬁlm’s detractors objected to.9 Already the reviews in the trade press, which were aimed at industry insiders and mainly focused on a ﬁlm’s commercial potential, raised some concerns. Variety’s highly positive review characterized A Clockwork Orange as “dispute-generating”, noted that it was “not for weak stomachs” and bemoaned the fact that the “X-rating will preclude attendance by many who would appreciate” the ﬁlm (Murphy, 1971). The even more\n\n20\n\nPeter Krämer\n\nenthuasiastic reviewer of the Hollywood Reporter also highlighted the “X” rating, condemning it for its “arbitrariness and stupidity” (Fisher, 1971). Both writers were nevertheless convinced of the ﬁlm’s “broad audience potential” which would make it “a big success”. The Motion Picture Herald, which judged the ﬁlm to be “excellent”, agreed that its “‘box ofﬁce outlook [is] limitless . . . despite the X rating”, yet suggested that it would appeal most to those in the 18–30 age bracket (Anon., 1972b). Variety mentioned that due to the ﬁlm’s “comic horrors”, “outrageous vulgarity” and “stark brutality” as well as its “opaque argument for the preservation of respect for man’s free will”, viewers would only be able to “ﬁnd perverse solace” in it. This phrase suggested that the ﬁlm did not provide audiences with the traditional pleasures of mainstream cinema and instead appealed to a certain “perversity” in them. Similarly, the Hollywood Reporter described the ﬁlm as “a black, perverse, extraordinarily exhilarating tribute” to “the unregenerate human spirit”. In this way, trade press reviewers acknowledged that both the ﬁlm and anyone who liked it might be called “perverse”, and at the same time criticized the ﬁlm industry’s ratings system for restricting access to what they considered to be a timely masterpiece. Similarly, ambivalent and hostile reviews of the ﬁlm in the general press were not only concerned about ﬁlmic qualities to do with style, story and theme, but also about the state of Hollywood, of American culture more generally, indeed of American society. They took the release of A Clockwork Orange to be a problematic, if not downright negative expression, or indication, of what they perceived to be disastrous developments in the United States. I have mainly looked at reviews from New York and Los Angeles based publications, which were, in fact, overwhelmingly very positive (leading the New York Film Critics Association to choose A Clockwork Orange as the best ﬁlm of 1971). Like the two trade paper reviews, some of these positive notices objected strongly to the “X” rating (e.g. Reed, 1971). At the same time, the reviews praising the ﬁlm also raised a number of concerns. Several found fault with its ﬁlmic qualities, judging it to be “curiously static and overlong”, “‘icy and abstract” (Champlin, 1971); or “a little too neat and too cold”, without “‘a sense of grief or of rage” (Cocks, 1971). Some generally supportive reviewers also found the ﬁlm simply hard to make sense of, for two reasons; ﬁrst of all, because of the slang used by Alex and his gang, secondly because they felt that the ﬁlm’s answer to the questions it posed about violence, morality and the state was unclear: “The act is great, the answer enigmatic, mufﬂed . . . It is the kind of picture that can be studied more readily than enjoyed” (Winsten, 1971).\n\n“Rape, Ultra-violence and Beethoven”\n\n21\n\nIn addition, there were concerns about the ﬁlm’s sheer unpleasantness. The reviewer in the New York Daily News felt it necessary to warn readers that A Clockwork Orange “may offend (it very nearly makes me nauseous)” (Carroll, 1971). In the New York Morning Telegraph, Leo Mishkin (1971) went even further: “It’s a shocking, stomach-turning, vomitous motion picture, but more awful than anything else, it may just possibly prove to be true as well.” While these generally positive reviews implied that such unpleasantness was probably a worthwhile, even necessary challenge for the ﬁlm’s viewers, in a glowing review in the New York Times Vincent Canby (1972) worried that “there may be a very real problem when . . . such stylized representations [of violence] are seen by immature audiences”.10 He thus seemed to raise the possibility that the ﬁlm might traumatize such audiences or even move them to engage in violence themselves. As can be expected, negative reviews of the ﬁlm took up many of the above points of criticism and concern, both intensifying and extending them. Thus, the Nation complained that A Clockwork Orange combined “nauseating viciousness” with too much “tinsel”, that is stylistic ﬂourishes getting in the way of conveying the “central proposition” of Burgess’ novel (Hatch, 1972).11 Gail Rock, of Women’s Wear Daily, found the ﬁlm “interesting and well done, but totally unlikable”, and judged its “nonsense-syllable futuristic slang” to be “an annoying contrivance” and its representation of women to be exploitative; in her view, the ﬁlm failed to convey the novel’s message about free will because “there is not a character here to care about nor a point of view to embrace” (Rock, 1971).12 For some reviewers, the ﬁlm’s failings were a matter of broader concern, because they raised questions about the state of contemporary cinema, even contemporary society. Thus, the Christian Science Monitor questioned the ratings system when concluding its review with the statement: “it’s a ﬁlm so repellent its ‘X’ rating seems not warning enough” (Anon., 1971b). Clayton Riley, whose attack on the ﬁlm in the New York Times was printed opposite Vincent Canby’s glowing review which I cited earlier, covered all angles by describing the ﬁlm as “a monumental bore, a ﬁtful parade of those technical bonbons that characterize our television commercials”. He then laid into its supporters among critics and audiences, who, he wrote, “delight in deciphering [art], as if by doing so they became the possessor of some mystical insight, some delicious new registration of depravity” (Riley, 1972). This, for him, was not just a matter of bad taste and pretentiousness. With reference to Charles Manson, My Lai and Nazi terror, Riley objected to what he regarded as the ﬁlm’s central idea: “the will to perpetrate evil is better than no will at all”. What is more, he feared that the ﬁlm might\n\n22\n\nPeter Krämer\n\nactually inspire real-life violence: “Enough brutality of an instructive nature is contained in Orange to provide a manual for the needs of every street gang and knuckle society in the US.” In an equally comprehensive critique of the ﬁlm in the Village Voice, Andrew Sarris pointed, like many other critics, to the attractiveness of its protagonist and to what, in his eyes, amounted to the ﬁlm’s apologetic account of his deeds: “Alex and his friends are left off the hook. Anything this particular society gets, it asks for in the vile literalism of its lewdness” (Sarris, 1971; see also Staiger, 2003: 48–9). Then, in an ambiguous statement apparently referencing depictions of violence in other ﬁlms and elsewhere in popular culture as well as real-life violence, Sarris turned apocalyptic: “‘What frightens me is the chaos that engulfs us all. I am tired of the cult of violence. I am tired of people smashing other people and things in the name of freedom and self-expression.” This would appear to raise the spectre of the ﬁlm’s violence spilling over into the auditorium and into the streets, while also giving expression to Sarris’ very negative view of where American culture and society were currently heading. After these initial reviews, which mostly concentrated on this one ﬁlm, had come out, A Clockwork Orange proceeded to become the focus of more general attacks on Hollywood and what were perceived to be troubling tendencies in American culture. Most notably, in February 1972 Fred M. Hechinger attacked A Clockwork Orange in an article entitled “A Liberal Fights Back” in the New York Times as a ﬁlm which promoted “the thesis that man is irretrievably bad and corrupt”, an idea he considered to be the very “essence of fascism” (Hechinger, 1972). He argued that only “the repressive, illiberal, distrustful, violent institutions of fascism” could “be built on that pessimistic view of man’s nature”. For Hechinger, A Clockwork Orange was only the most egregious example of a widespread trend in Hollywood, which was rooted in the “deeply anti-liberal totalitarian nihilism emanating from beneath the counter-culture” that the studios had previously courted with a series of “mindless youth-culture exploitation” ﬁlms. (Among the ﬁlms Hechinger mentioned were two of the hits I have listed above: Easy Rider and The French Connection.) According to Hechinger, these ﬁlmic trends had strong political implications: “It is precisely because Hollywood’s antennae have in the past been so sensitive in picking up the national mood that the anti-liberal trend” should be taken seriously as an indication of a fascist disposition in American society. The following month saw another high proﬁle statement about A Clockwork Orange and the perceived crisis in American culture, this time from what appeared to be a very different political direction. Directly\n\n“Rape, Ultra-violence and Beethoven”\n\n23\n\ncontradicting a positive review of the ﬁlm in his own paper, the features editor of the Pittsburgh Press wrote on 20 March 1972, only one day after the dramatic announcement by the Detroit Press about its ban of advertising and publicity for “X”-rated movies: “If Clockwork Orange is the best movie of 1971, the whole motion picture industry is so sick, the ailment may be fatal . . . It is enough to make you throw up, morally and physically” (Allen, 1972; quoted in Litman, 1972). The ﬁlm’s commercial performance did not seem to be harmed by these negative reviews and commentaries, the widespread advertising and publicity ban, or the refusal of so many cinemas to show “X”-rated ﬁlms. On 23 March 1972, only four days after the announcement by the Detroit News, the ﬁlm industry trade press reported that A Clockwork Orange had been doing extremely well in the 28 cinemas in which it had been shown, having already earned $2.4m in rentals (Anon., 1972c). The ﬁlm was scheduled to appear in 50 cinemas in April and to go on national release by appearing in hundreds of cinemas in cities and towns all over the US during the summer. It was expected that the ﬁlm’s run in individual cinemas would last anywhere from 18 weeks to more than a year (Anon., 1972c). As mentioned above, this optimism was borne out by the fact that, in the end, A Clockwork Orange became the seventh highest grossing 1971 release. An audience survey conducted early in the ﬁlm’s release, presumably by handing out a questionnaire after a regular screening of A Clockwork Orange, indicates reasons for the ﬁlm’s success and also highlights once again its divisiveness (Gilbert Youth Research, 1972). The majority of respondents were male (57%), under 30 (70%) and, by the standards of the time, quite highly educated (73% had spent some time at college). Almost all of them appeared to be regular cinemagoers, attending at least once a month, with more than two thirds saying they had seen at least two ﬁlms during the previous month. When asked how well they enjoyed the movie, almost half of the respondents under 21 chose “very good”; by contrast only 29% of those over 35 selected this answer. Conversely, whereas more than 20% of those over 35 found the ﬁlm “poor” or “very poor”, only 3% of those under 21 did so. A similar, yet less dramatic division can be found in terms of gender. While 42% of males selected “very good”, only 34% of females did, and whereas 12% of women found the ﬁlm “poor” or “very poor”, only 6% of men judged the ﬁlm this way. When asked about their reasons for seeing Clockwork Orange, 37% stated that they had “read good reviews about it” (an option selected especially by those over 30), while 33% said that “friends/relatives suggested I see it” (an option particularly popular\n\n24\n\nPeter Krämer\n\namong younger respondents). Thus it would appear that the majority of respondents acted on speciﬁc recommendations, either from the press or from people they knew. (With regard to the newspaper boycott, it is also worth mentioning that the majority of respondents had ﬁrst become aware of A Clockwork Orange through newspaper ads.) Importantly, young females were more inclined than any other group to state that they went to see the ﬁlm because they had been “just curious”, or because “someone else had wanted to see it”, implying that they simply went along with that other person. By contrast, young males were more likely than any other group to declare that they were “attracted by this kind of movie”, by which they mostly expressed a preference for Kubrick ﬁlms, although some of them also declared that they were attracted by violence. This survey strongly suggests that, having ﬁrst seen print ads, potential cinemagoers were immediately divided along the lines of age and gender with regards to their interest in this obviously transgressive ﬁlm by Stanley Kubrick. Educated young males who habitually went to the cinema were more likely than other groups to act on their interest, and once they had seen the ﬁlm they were more likely to like it and to recommend it to others.13 In addition to such personal recommendations, good reviews in the press played an important part in motivating people to see the ﬁlm. The very fact that the ﬁlm initially received mostly celebratory reviews provoked a strong response from certain ﬁlm writers and other cultural commentators. It was not only the ﬁlm’s focus on an extremely violent, yet strangely appealing protagonist, its exhilarating depiction of sex and violence and its apparent message about both the depravity of man and the importance of free will which riled its detractors, but also the ﬁlm’s critical and commercial success. For these writers, the huge success of A Clockwork Orange had troubling implications for where the American ﬁlm industry, and indeed American society, was heading. In addition, some writers feared the direct impact A Clockwork Orange might have on the more impressionable segments of its audience, especially those who might be inspired to replicate the screen violence for real. Indeed, an audience survey revealed that the most important segment of the ﬁlm’s audience were male youth. However unlike Alex and his gang, and also unlike the uneducated (“immature”) viewers that even such a strong supporter of the ﬁlm as Vincent Canby was worried about, the large majority were current or former college students.\n\n“Rape, Ultra-violence and Beethoven”\n\n25\n\nConclusion Due to its formal transgressiveness and its socially resonant themes, A Clockwork Orange was extremely divisive upon its initial release in the US, setting ﬁlm theatres, audience segments and critics against each other. Yet, building on established hit patterns to do with taboo-breaking and criminal protagonists, and with strong support from many reviewers, the ﬁlm’s appeal to those people it did not alienate – notably educated male youth – was so strong that it still became a major commercial success. A Clockwork Orange thus exempliﬁes a process of rapid change in American cinema during the late 1960s and early 1970s which allowed ﬁlmmakers and audiences to explore explicit imagery and transgressive storylines that had previously been excluded from mainstream American cinema, mainly on moral grounds (Krämer, 2005: chs 2–3).14 The fact that, for a few years, this exploration moved to the very centre of American ﬁlm culture intensiﬁed the concerns of ﬁlm critics and cultural commentators, among them liberals as well as conservatives, about the possible impact of ﬁlms on their young audiences and also, more generally, about the overall direction of cultural, social and political developments in American society. Implicitly (and sometimes explicitly), writers attacking ﬁlms like A Clockwork Orange posed the question whether individual ﬁlmmakers, and the ﬁlm industry as a whole, had an ethical obligation to abstain from certain images, characters, storylines and ideas in their output. While the box ofﬁce heyday of transgressive ﬁlmmaking is long gone, this question continues to be debated.\n\nNotes 1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nInformation about ratings can be obtained from the ofﬁcial website of the Motion Picture Association of America, http://www.mpaa.org/movieratings. The CARA certiﬁcate giving A Clockwork Orange an “R” rating was issued on 22 August 1972; it is contained in folder SK/13/8/5/10, Stanley Kubrick Archive (SKA), University of the Arts London. While Deep Throat had been rated by CARA, the makers and distributors of The Devil in Miss Jones had not in fact submitted their ﬁlm to CARA and instead had self-applied the “X”, which was possible because the MPAA had not copyrighted this rating, whereas the less restrictive ratings could only be used with their permission (Wyatt, 2000: 241). It is worth noting that this period also saw the proliferation of top ten ﬁlms featuring often very violent policemen in contemporary America, who in places bend the law or even go beyond it. These ﬁlms include Bullitt (1968), The\n\n26\n\n4\n\n5 6\n\n7\n\n8 9\n\n10\n\n11 12 13\n\nPeter Krämer French Connection (1971), and the ﬁrst three Dirty Harry movies –Dirty Harry (1971), Magnum Force (1973) and The Enforcer (1976). There is also the title character of Billy Jack (1971) and The Trial of Billy Jack (1974), who is forced to become a criminal to defend his community. It is striking how many of the ﬁlms mentioned in this section were released by Warner Bros, the studio behind A Clockwork Orange. They include Bonnie and Clyde, Bullitt, the Billy Jack and Dirty Harry movies, Deliverance, The Getaway, The Exorcist and Dog Day Afternoon. In addition the studio was responsible for Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966), a top ten hit which was instrumental in bringing about the suspension of the Production Code in 1966 (Krämer, 2005: 47–8). Together with my earlier observation that many of the violent crime movies and some of the other controversial ﬁlms were released by Warner Bros, this comment would seem to suggest that perhaps there was a general studio policy at work here. Certiﬁcate contained in folder SK/13/8/5/10, SKA. Klenow and Crane (1977: 77–8) studied the audience for “X”-rated movies in 1973, closely identifying such ﬁlms with sexually explicit material. This study characterizes the audience as consisting disproportionately of “young single male[s] with at least a high school education”, without “a particular religious afﬁliation”, residing “in a more populated area in the Eastern or Western regions of the United States”, and notes that “females attend X-rated ﬁlms in lower percentages than males, and smaller percentages of the female attenders return in comparison to males”. With its surprising reference to classical music, the tagline for A Clockwork Orange also echoes the opening lines of the ﬁlm Love Story (and its best-selling source novel), the biggest hit of 1970: “What can you say about a twenty-ﬁveold girl who died? That she was beautiful. And brilliant. That she loved Mozart and Bach. And the Beatles. And me.” The editorial was reprinted, together with a response from Stanley Kubrick, in Anon., 1972a. For a closely related discussion of the arguments used by the ﬁlm’s detractors and supporters, see Staiger, 2003. Also of interest is a recent account of the shifting parameters of ﬁlm criticism in the US (notably the increased emphasis on directors and the art of ﬁlm in reviews across the 1960s and 1970s), which – although the book does not refer speciﬁcally to A Clockwork Orange – may help to explain why it had so many supporters in the ﬁrst place (Baumann, 2007; see esp. pp. 120–21, 127, 139, 141, 153). This celebratory review – entitled “Orange – ‘Disorienting But Human Comedy . . .’” – appeared opposite a critical attack on the ﬁlm by Clayton Riley: “. . . Or ‘A Dangerous, Criminally Irresponsible Horror Show’” (pp. 1, 13). Canby had written an earlier review of the ﬁlm, published in the New York Times of 20 December 1971, p. 44. Staiger (2003: 47–8) notes the importance of comparisons with the book for both positive and negative reviews. Cf. Staiger’s (2003: 51) discussion of an early decidedly feminist critique of the ﬁlm. Broadly speaking, the audience for A Clockwork Orange thus seems to be very\n\n“Rape, Ultra-violence and Beethoven”\n\n27\n\nsimilar to that of “X”-rated movies in general (Klenow and Crane, 1977). 14 This chapter and the following chapter also attempt to provide an explanation for the transformation of hit patterns between the Roadshow Era (1949–66) and the New Hollywood (1967–76).\n\nReferences Allen, Bill. 1972. ‘A Clockwork Orange – Fascinatingly Tart or Merely Putrid?’, Pittsburgh Press (20 March).

For example, MGM, led by Louis B. Meyer and, until his untimely death at the age of 37 in 1936, Irving Thalberg, was considered the most American of the studios, its ﬁlms, such as Meet Me in St Louis (Vincente Minnelli, 1944) transmitting at the narrative level conservative traditional values through the visual medium of a lavish, glossy mise-en-scène. MGM’s conservative ideology was attributable to Meyer’s support for the Republican Party, the lavish production values to Thalberg’s commitment to big budget projects. Conversely, Warner Brothers (usually abbreviated to Bros), by the 1930s led by Jack (in charge of production in Hollywood) and Harry (responsible for ﬁnance in New York), was the studio with a social conscience, making predominantly gritty ﬁlms addressing contemporary issues, the subject matter being matched by rough and ready sets and largely low-key, black and white photography to convey a highly realistic milieu. In 1943 the New York Times described Warner Bros as ‘Combining good citizenship with good picture-making’. This quotation can also be seen to aptly describe the personal and political relationship between Jack and Harry Warner and their studio, and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) and the Roosevelt administration. Contact between the ﬁlmmakers and the politician was initially made in 1930 when Warner Bros installed screening equipment in Roosevelt’s ofﬁcial residence as Governor of New York State. The Warners went on to promote Roosevelt on the West Coast\n\n30\n\nJacqui Miller\n\nduring the 1932 presidential campaign, and continued to campaign for him, and to work for the administration and the Democratic Party, until his death in 1945. In addition, Warner Bros consistently produced ﬁlms which supported Roosevelt’s domestic and diplomatic policies. The early and mid1930s saw pictures which targeted speciﬁc social problems and afﬁrmed faith in the federal government. It also saw the launch of a pro-military “preparedness” cycle, and a series of so-called “patriotic shorts” which valorized American history and highlighted its relevance for contemporary society. From 1936, with the growing crisis in Europe, both FDR and the Warners increasingly turned their attention to international affairs and the part America should play. Roosevelt sought to counter Congress’ and the American people’s mood of isolationism, to strengthen American arms and to secure assistance for Britain and France. Concurrently the Warners produced pictures warning of fascism at home and abroad, ultimately demanding American intervention in Europe.\n\nWarner Bros and FDR in 1939 Since 1930 the Warners had sent FDR and his staff numerous telegrams, variously offering congratulations for electoral victories, conﬁrming political arrangements, offering birthday and season’s greetings, or providing information about ﬁlm releases. Up until 1939, no telegram had commented on the New Deal or diplomatic policy, or on Roosevelt’s speeches. However, this year the brothers, showing their keen support for intervention in Europe, began to send telegrams giving praise and support when FDR deﬁed Congress in his proactive foreign policy. Jack Warner sent FDR a wire congratulating him on his annual message to Congress given on 4 January (USC: JWC; FDRL: PPF 1050). Harry expressed similar approval of FDR’s address before a joint session of the Senate and House recommending revision of the Neutrality Law on 21 September. The second half of FDR’s annual message related to domestic affairs – chieﬂy the achievements of the New Deal since 1933, but Jack Warner singled out the ﬁrst part of the message. In respect of contemporary Europe, Roosevelt denounces aggression from abroad which is seen to be attacking a triptych of American institutions, “religion, democracy and international good faith” and points out a need to build up American arms as a means of sound defence, using the term “preparedness” twice, and criticizing “legislated neutrality” (Dallek, 1974: 185). During the next few months, Roosevelt enlarged upon this position. In the spring he tried to persuade\n\nConfessions of a Nazi Spy\n\n31\n\nHitler and Mussolini to cease international aggression. Although unsuccessful, this showed FDR’s sense of responsibility to intervene in world affairs. It had already become apparent to FDR that “legislated neutrality” was to the disadvantage of France and Britain; they could not buy American arms, and did not have the military strength of the Axis powers. In the summer he asked Congress to repeal the arms embargo of the Neutrality Act of 1937 on the grounds that this would act as a deterrent to war; Hitler would be less likely to attack powerfully equipped nations. If this strategy failed, he argued, lifting the embargo would still serve to make American involvement in a war less likely as Britain and France would be better able to defend themselves. Congress responded that selling arms was only likely to increase the chances of war, and on 11 July the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations voted to defer its decision until Congress met again in January 1940 (Divine 1965: 160). In August, Roosevelt renewed his messages to Italy and Germany, not so much because he believed he would be successful, but to make his own position clear. In his “ﬁreside chat” the day war was declared in Europe, although he stressed his hatred of combat and his belief that America would remain neutral, at least in terms of military action, he added: “I cannot ask that every American remain neutral in thought as well. Even a neutral cannot be asked to close his mind or his conscience” (Roosevelt, 1938–50: VIII 444). The outbreak of war led FDR to again ask Congress to revise the neutrality legislation. A compromise was reached on 3 November which repealed the arms embargo but retained the “cash and carry” principle with respect to their purchase. This not only materially advantaged the Allies but also indicated the direction of American allegiance. As Rexford Tugwell has pointed out, FDR had always sought American aid for the Allies “because they were ﬁghting for a cause that was also America’s cause” (Tugwell, 1969: 499). The rhetoric used by FDR is matched closely by Jack Warner. In his annual message, Roosevelt told Congress: “There comes a time in the affairs of men when they must prepare to defend, not their homes alone, but the tenets of faith and humanity on which their churches, their governments and their very civilization are founded” (Roosevelt, 1938–50: VIII 2). In an interview given to the New York Times in January, Warner too stresses the need to keep faith with American traditions: “we know from personal experience the value of American philosophy. We are descendants of immigrants and we know why our fathers came to America . . . The visual power of the screen is tremendous and we propose to acquaint Americans with their heritage” (15 January 1939). The ideals underpinning American democracy\n\n32\n\nJacqui Miller\n\nwere drawn on again in FDR’s September request that Congress revise the Neutrality Act: “Fate now seems to compel us to assume the task of helping to maintain in the western world a citadel wherein that civilization may be kept alive. That peace, the integrity, and the safety of the Americas – these must be kept ﬁrm and serene” (Roosevelt, 1938–50: VIII 518). Both FDR and the Warners were now to act upon their respective codes of ethics. During the year, FDR showed the courage of his convictions in confronting a still predominantly isolationist nation and gaining a revision of the Neutrality Act. Similarly, the Warners were now prepared to make their perspective plain with a highly controversial ﬁlm, Confessions of a Nazi Spy (Anatole Litvak, 1939). As Jack Warner stated: “Defence of American democracy has been left almost entirely to the press. Through our medium we can reach from 40,000,000 with a single picture. We are determined to do this in spite of objections from surprising sources” (15 January 1939). Confessions of a Nazi Spy: The Ethics of Courage In February 1938 the FBI exposed a pro-Nazi German spy ring which was working on the East Coast, particularly New York City. The spies were prosecuted and found guilty in US of A v. Otto Herman Voss et al held at the Southern district of New York US District Court, heard by District Judge John C. Knox. Confessions, based on this case, had its Hollywood preview on 27 April 1939 (Sandeen, 1979: 69). The next day, Jack Warner, describing himself as an “old and good friend”, wired FDR that “three thousand people for a solid twenty minutes applauded and cheered this great American document of civilization” (FDRL: OF 73). Work on the ﬁlm had begun in June 1938. Several changes of working title were tried from Storm Over America to The World is Ours until Confessions of a Nazi Spy was settled upon (USC: WB). It continued Warner Bros’ practice of using topical material, the screenplay being based on former FBI agent Leon G. Turrou’s book, The Nazi Conspiracy in America, in which he describes cracking the spy ring and propaganda machine within the German-American Bund on the East Coast, and the spies’ subsequent trial (Balio 1993: 298). Turrou was paid $25,000 for the use of his book, and was retained by the studio as technical advisor (USC: WB). Confessions is a difﬁcult ﬁlm to summarize. Held together by a March of Time style narrator it is essentially a series of propagandistic set pieces linked by a ﬁctional narrative, culminating in the breaking up of the spy ring and subsequent trial. Each scene underscores the two key points that Warner\n\nConfessions of a Nazi Spy\n\n33\n\nBros want to emphasize: Fascism and racial and class hatreds have gripped Germany and with the ascendancy of Hitler are now forcibly sweeping Europe; American democracy must play its part in turning back the tide, ensuring fascism never engulfs the United States. Although it was not made at the request of the Roosevelt administration, Confessions dramatized one of its concerns. FDR had asked the FBI to survey Nazi activity in America as early as 1934 and in 1936 directed both the FBI and military intelligence to investigate fascism. The worsening situation in Europe continued to exacerbate fears and by 1939 the administration “was apprehensive about Nazi spies” (Vaughn, 1994: 73). Spy activity in America was centred in the German-American Bund which traded on native loyalties of German-Americans as well as recruiting right-wing Americans who endorsed fascism. The Bund claimed to represent “Friends of the New Germany in the USA”, but ultimate control was in the hands of Rudolph Hess, Hitler’s Nationalist Socialist Party deputy leader (Manvell, 1974: 30). Confessions was the ﬁrst openly anti-Nazi picture made in America and so plainly pro-interventionist as to have Ed Renard (Edward G. Robinson), the FBI agent based on Turrou actually say that America is at war with Germany: “It’s a new kind of war but it’s still war”. This made it “a landmark in cinema history” (Friedrich, 1987: 50). Writing three decades after its release, Lewis Jacobs recognized that Confessions’ timing was particularly disturbing: “American nerves were taught, and feeling was running high over Hitler’s ruthless aggression in Europe” (Jacobs, 1967–68: 6). Why, with such “feeling” in America, was Confessions such a controversial and courageous picture? Part of the answer is down to the ﬁnancial structure of the ﬁlm industry.\n\nTaking a Stand Against the Film Industry During the 1930s American studios depended for up to 50% of their profits on foreign, particularly European, markets. Events in Europe might have seemed to offer ripe opportunities for sensational ﬁlm subjects, notwithstanding objections from isolationists at home, but to make ﬁlms, for example about Mussolini’s invasion of Abyssinia, Hitler’s invasion of Czechoslovakia, or even ﬁlms critical of Nazi inﬂuence in America, would certainly lose sales not only to fascist and occupied nations, but also to neutral countries. Markets would probably be lost not only for the critical pictures but for a studio’s entire output, a situation that would be\n\n34\n\nJacqui Miller\n\nmade worse by the fact that ﬁlm companies continued to raise revenue from the exhibition in Europe of back-catalogue ﬁlms that could no longer be screened at home. Therefore, quite apart from ideological outlook, the wish to preserve overseas markets kept the other studios away from international political comment. Indeed, they went on to comply with Nazi demands that all “non-Aryan” staff employed at German studio ofﬁces be ﬁred (Koppes and Black, 1987: 21). Warner Bros would brook no such restrictions and had ceased to care about the German market. In 1936, their representative in Berlin, Joe Kauffman, had been beaten to death by Nazis and the studio closed its German ofﬁce. However, they gained no support in their anti-Nazi stance from other studios. Upon hearing that Confessions had gone into production, Luigi Luraschi, employed in Paramount’s censorship department, commented that if the picture were “in any way uncomplimentary to Germany, as it must be if it is to be sincerely produced, then Warners will have on their hands the blood of a great many Jews in Germany” (PCA). Jack Warner recalled, in typically exuberant fashion, telling a studio head who protested that bookings in Germany were going to be affected: Listen, these murdering bastards killed our own man in Germany because he wouldn’t heil Hitler. The Silver Shirts and the Bundists and all the rest of these hoods are marching in Los Angeles right now. There are high school kids with Swastikas on their sleeves a few blocks from our studio. Is that what you want in exchange for some crummy royalties out of Germany? I’m going to ﬁnish this picture, and Hitler and Goebbels can scream all they want. And so can guys like you! (Warner, 1964: 262)\n\nThe Hays Ofﬁce and the PCA (see Introduction, page 6) also objected to Confessions. Frederick Herron of the Hays Ofﬁce directed the foreign relations division and expected studios to respect German requirements (Koppes and Black, 1987: 21), but the personality of Joseph I. Breen must be added to the Hays Ofﬁce’s economic motives when considering its caveats. Before taking up his post as PCA chief, the conservative Catholic Breen had criticized Jews in Hollywood (Vaughn 1994: 76). He particularly loathed the Hollywood branch of the anti-Nazi League, which he described as “conducted and ﬁnanced almost entirely by Jews” (Koppes and Black, 1987: 22). Breen’s hostility to pictures he believed were Jewish anti-Nazi propaganda pieces was further fuelled by demands from the German Consul in Los Angeles, Dr George Gyssling. During the spy trials Warner Bros sent one of their contracted writers, Milton Krims, to observe the case, the Hollywood Reporter announcing “Krims will get ﬁrst hand information\n\nConfessions of a Nazi Spy\n\n35\n\nfor a picture . . . subject which the studio is planning” (27 October 1938). Gyssling spotted this and sent the clipping to Breen with the “request”: “Will you kindly see to it that the matter which is mentioned . . . will not result in difﬁculties”. Shortly afterwards, another Hollywood Reporter article, referring to Warner Bros’ “Nazi spy ﬁlm” spurred Gyssling to write to Breen asking “whether or not this ﬁrm has really the intention to make a picture like that”? (6 December 1938). The cautious Breen did not comment directly but passed Gyssling’s clipping and letters on to Jack Warner, and advised Gyssling to communicate directly with the studio (USC: JWC). Warner ignored Gyssling and work went ahead, but when the ﬁnished screenplay was sent to Breen for approval Warner asked that it be kept locked away as protection from the Bund and the German Consul (Koppes and Black, 1987: 28). Fierce argument in the PCA followed. One employee was particularly vociferous in his criticism, arguing that it was unfair to show Hitler as “a screaming madman”, that Confessions should at least show his “unchallenged political and social achievements”, and that the picture, if made, would be “one of the most lamentable mistakes ever made by the industry” (PCA). Breen’s stance was equivocal. A letter composed to Jack Warner questioning whether such a controversial picture should be made was not mailed, nor was a letter to Will Hays which also raised the point about the ﬁlm’s contentiousness but wavered on the grounds that objections could be made by acknowledging that “important government ofﬁcials” (such as the trial judge who had allowed Warner Bros to ﬁlm in his courtroom) had given “indirect aid” to the production. Breen had to admit that Confessions was accurate and within the letter of the Production Code. He hoped that the studio would make the decision for him and retreat from the project, not only because international sales would be lost, but also because state censorship boards might refuse its exhibition for fear of ensuing anti-German riots (PCA).\n\nAn Ethical Production Team Breen’s caution was ignored and Confessions went ahead. Jack Warner’s deputy, Hal Wallis, has commented: “Because Jack Warner and I were deeply concerned over the crisis in Europe in the late 1930s, we decided to undertake a policy of opposition to Nazism in our pictures, despite the very strong possibility that isolationist elements in America would surely criticize us” (Wallis and Higham, 1980: 70). This deﬁance marks the attitude of\n\n36\n\nJacqui Miller\n\nmany of the ﬁlm’s personnel (some of whom, such as the actor Paul Lucas, were German émigrés) to Nazism in particular, but also their commitment to liberal, even left-wing political causes. These were sustained both during the late 1930s and beyond through to the House Un-American Affairs Committee’s (HUAC) investigations into Hollywood after World War II and into the early 1950s. The assistant producer on Confessions, Robert Lord, described it as “the most important Warner Brothers have made” (USC: WB). The director, Anatole Litvak, was Russian-born but had become a naturalized American whose loyalty during World War II was rewarded with a commission in the Army Signal Corps.
