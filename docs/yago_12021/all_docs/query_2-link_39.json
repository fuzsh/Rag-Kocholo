        "text": "This interview contains major spoilers from the Season 1 finale of “Only Murders in the Building.”\n\n“Never trust a bassoonist,” Amy Ryan said with a laugh.\n\nShe would be the one to know: Ryan plays one in the first season of the whodunit comedy “Only Murders in the Building,” the finale of which arrived to Hulu on Tuesday. And that bassoonist, it turns out, was the maniac behind the central murder of the show’s first season. (The series has already been renewed for a second.)\n\nAfter numerous twists and red herrings — at one point, the musician Sting is suspected — Jan’s jig is up after the hard-luck Broadway producer Oliver Putnam (Martin Short) realizes that what he thought was a sex toy found in the murder victim Tim Kono’s apartment is actually … a bassoon cleaner. Kono’s older neighbor, it seems, was also his former lover.\n\nBut she’s not going down before she takes her new flame, the washed-up former TV star Charles-Haden Savage (Steve Martin), down with her — by way of a handkerchief laced with poison.\n\n“I want you to know this is definitely one of my rougher breakups, Charles,” she coos as she slips a couch pillow under his head after watching him slump to the floor. “I really did fall in love with you.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
