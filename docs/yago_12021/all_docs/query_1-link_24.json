        "text": "As I said about the first episode, season 2 of The Wire is in most fans eyes the least well-regarded (though I will have my say upon that question when the time comes). This opinion arises from the overpowering change of direction the season represents, the abrupt shift from the Drugs scene to the Docks, the sudden arrival of a new cast group who will play no part in later seasons, the sense of a temporary intrusion in a longer story that takes it out of character.\n\nAll of these things are in themselves accurate criticisms, though the story that is being told in season 2 is a powerful and very valid one. And it’s tempered by the ongoing repercussions of season 1 as it affects the Barksdale Crew, winding through the story, given time but more of a background aspect.\n\nWith episode 6, we’re halfway through the series, we’re still pointing in different directions, we haven’t begun to converge but, in its different scenes, its moments and momentous changes, I think this is one of the strongest episodes in the entires series, especially in its ending, which only the ultra percipient would honestly have seen coming.\n\nWhat we have now is four different threads. The most prominent one is the trial of Bird for the murder of William Gant in season 1, before Judge Phelan, chief witness Omar Little. This is a gas, a classic, a tour de force by Michael K Williams, especially when being confronted by the slimy lawyer Morris Levy. Omar is Omar in every glorious inch of him, completely open about who and what he is, a guy who rips-and-runs, i.e., someone who robs drugs gangs of their stash and profits. He’s brilliantly unashamed of it, which is doubly wonderful since he’s actually lying through his teeth about Bird, to fit him up, but the showstopper moment is when Levy, thinking he’s delivering the unanswerable put-down, anatomises Omar as someone who would knowingly and unashamedly lie, only for Omar to turn it back on him in an instant by pointing out that he’s no different than Levy: he do it with a gun, Levy with a briefcase. I was still a solicitor when I first saw that and you’d better believe how long I howled with laughter at that line.\n\nWhich scene bled over into McNulty’s strand. Gant was his last case from Homicide. Looking to the future he’s giving up the thought of being a murder police. He’s turning himself around. He’ll settle for the boats, he gives up trying to identify the floater, he wants another chance with his estranged wife Elena. He’s gonna give up the booze and the one-night stands. All it gets him so far is a very cagey meal and a one-night stand with Elena, a fuck for the road, that he thinks is the pathway to his second chance, only she wants him gone before the boys get back from their sitter.\n\nMeanwhile, the Detail is picking up momentum. The Union very clearly has more money that it should from legitimate means. We know that, we know where it’s coming from, and we know that none of it is going into Frank Sobotka’s hands or pockets, it’s for the Union, for the Port, for its future. In a way, it’s noble. With an idea from Beadie Russell, slowly turning into a detective, she and Lester track down a pattern of containers unloading and vanishing: same line, same checker every time. And Kima, with her suspicious wife and the clearly-embarrassed Prez, goes checking out a connection willing to talk about foreign girls dancing in Baltimore Clubs. They work where Kima and Co are getting their information: in titty-bars.\n\nFrank’s not the only one getting closely involved with the Greek. Nicky organises not just the chemicals Spiros wants but gets his cousion Ziggy out of the hole over his problems with Cheese – who turns out to not only be working for Proposition Joe but to be his nephew. Ziggy comes out with his skin unthreatened, and $2,400, and immediately lights a cigarette with a burning $100 bill. Jackass.\n\nBut whilst all this is going on, wheels are turning within wheels. Stringer Bell goes outside Baltimore to request something from a Washington crew: what, we don’t know. Inside, d’Angelo is getting ever more distant, wanting only to be let be. He flushes what’s left of the drugs he’s been taking. He snubs his Uncle in a corridor. He pushes away his Mom on a visit, wanting to be completely outside, detached from the organisation, the Game, his family. He will do his twenty on his own.\n\nBut he won’t. In a book club he analyses The Great Gatsby, seeing it as the story of a man who tried to pretend he had changed but hadn’t really done so because he was what his past had set him up to be. The prescient, and I was not one of them until this time when I knew what was happening, understood that analysis, which was worth the hearing anyway for the insight it had into a classic novel. Then this guy, this anonymous con, follows Dee into a back room in the Library, slips a belt around his neck and strangles him, leaving the scene arranged to make it look like a suicide. Stringer’s mission fulfilled,. Those who are not with us… You brought your own explanations to it, and you remembered The Great Gatsby.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHow do you review a single chapter from the middle of a novel?\n\nIt’s easy enough if you’re talking about something standalone and exceptional, such as the ‘Piper at the Gates of Dawn’ chapter in The Wind in the Willows but in the kind of novel The Wire is, where the standalones are the moments and they only threads anyway, it’s sometimes impossible without resorting simply to listing what happens, at which point I’d be doing better to tell you to buy the boxset and watch it yourself.\n\nWhat happened this week? Many things. Where are we now? Further forward. Is this coalescing yet? Only incrementally.\n\nThe open was a gem. Ziggy’s going into drugs. He’s a fuck-up, the fuck-up’s fuck-up. He gets burned by his dealer, a white boy named Frog, aping gangster style. He gets beaten by his supplier, Cheese, who takes his money, disrespects his shiny leather coat, takes his car and gives him till Friday to pay $2,700 he hasn’t got, or on Saturday he’s dead. He’s all boastful hard man and snivelling victim in every second, and we get his signature line, the one we know he’ll use every day of his life, ‘it ain’t my fault’. Everybody else in the entire population of the world knows otherwise.\n\nZiggy’s not the only one having problems with the Game. The Barksdale organisation is getting weaker and weaker shit, the slingers and the fiends are complaining, their grip is in serious danger of slipping. Stringer’s using his business school tutor for ideas on how to turn the business round (which is hilarious). But Dee’s getting ever more detached, seeing through this family love bullshit that Darlene still buys into when she visits, talking a future outside the Game, legit, being readied for him when he gets out.\n\nAnd Omar’s in touch with McNulty, preparing in his inimitable way, to give testimony. I am so looking forward to watching that again.\n\nMeanwhile, the Detail starts to operate. It gains another alumnus, temporarily at least, Detective Freamon being assigned for the duration, leaving the Bunk to carry fourteen red names on his own. Sub poenas drag the stevedores off to Grand Juries, not that that phases the Baltimore Port Unions (technical adviosor Major Gary D’Addario, the real life Giardello of Homicide: Life on the Street, has a one-line cameo, confessing wearily that they’ve just got one of the stevedores to admit that the Port is near the water).\n\nBeadie Russell uses her gentle wiles to charm an old but disappointed flame to clue her in to the fact that all the unloading details for the container holding the dead girls are in the computer system. Frank Sobotka compliantly explains just how many ways the system can glitch without a single sinister motive.\n\nMcNulty’s driving up to Jersey City still trying to put a name and a family to his dead floater.\n\nCarver’s welcome back in the Detail. He can’t understand why but Daniels assesses that the son of a bitch snitch last time will be the last to snitch this time. Carver appreciates that. His Sergeantcy means nothing here, he and Herc are under Greggs’ leadership: cavaliers reunited!\n\nIt’s going all over the place but you know the threads are part of a pattern, that they’re leading somewhere. Frank Sobotka wants to meet the Greek himself, wants a temporary shutdown till the heat cools. The Greek won’t meet, the money will talk for him. He sends Spiros, and Frank flares up, cuts off completely. But the Greek still wants the three containers of chemicals for producing drugs. He tells Nicky he will pay triple rates for each one. Nicky tells Frank. The money talks.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIf you wanted to summarise The Wire‘s second season, you would watch the open to this episode. Plot-wise, Frank Sobotka summons his nephew Nick to call him out for the theft of the cameras last week, and order them brought back, which Nick explains he can’t do because they’ve already been sold. Frank’s angry that thefts like that further harm the future of the Port and its workers, if they are not efficient and reliable. Nick explains that he can’t survive on five to six days work a month. There you have it.\n\nBut The Wire is never not about multiple things. It was one of the first series to be descrbed as a novel on television and it displays the characteristics of a novel, with its multiple viewpoints, concerns and characters. This is episode 4, a third of the way through, and it’s taken until now for the Detail to be resurrected, the old gang, reassembled: Lt Daniels to lead, Kima Greggs, Herc, Prez, Carver (offscreen), but not McNulty: Rawls will not agree it.\n\nThe Detail’s done nothing yet. To get Daniels to postpone quitting the Police, Burrell has had to promise him the forthcoming Major’s position, that the Detail become permanant, a Major Crimes Unit and his choice of staff, subject to Rawls’ approval, they being CID and coming under his direction: anyone he wants except McNulty, who will only get off the boats if he quits or drowns. Just wait.\n\nThe Detail doesn’t know what it’s supposed to be doing, except it’s part of a pissing match between two Polacks, but it’s glad to be back together and do serious work, even if they have to make it for themselves. On the other hand, two wives are unhappy: Marla Daniels, at Cedric not leaving the Police to become a lawyer, Greggs’ wife the same thing (that women is seriously pissed at Greggs not doing what she’s told).\n\nOf course, Freamon’s not available because he’s in Homicide, partnered with The Bunk on a case of thirteen, maybe fourteen Jane Doe’s, wth Rawls expressing a fact that if these deaths don’t get solved, he’s not looking afield for scapegoats. Bunk’s on McNulty’s ass over producing Omar. Jimmy lies about having him in his pocket. Jimmy’s got a lot on his plate, like finding Omar, for which he coerces Bubbles, Andre Royo coming onscreen at last, like his obsession with tracking down one of the dead girls, putting a name to the face, and a home and family, like trying to get back with his wife, Elena (you know it’s a mistake, girl).\n\nBut the season is still broadening. Ziggy Sobotka’s being a total fuck-up, it being his natural state of existence, over the cash they’ve made, eager to resume being the worst kind of criminal in the world, whilst Nicky is torn between the appeal of the money, and a place to live with his girl and their daughter, and his Uncle’s words. And in prison, five men have died from heroin cut with strychnine and eight more in the infirmary. Avon Barksdale wants d’Angelo to go in with the information that will identify Tilghman, that will shave years off Dee’s sentence. But Dee wants no more of it, wants to be left out, left alone. So Avon does the deal, Tilghman is framed, goes down. There will be consequences.\n\nBunk and Lester, left in no doubt that this is a thirteen-sided case they gotta solve, start making their presence felt, ineffectually, down at the Docks, where no-one will talk to Police any more than the corner boys will. They make Frank Sobotka nervous just by being there. That’s before they tell him that the dead girls weren’t an accident, a safe, comfortable, morally neutral accident, but murder. Frank throws up in a toilet sink, looks at himself in the mirror. But he’s not going to be able to escape from his involvement any more than he can escape from his reflection…\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAh yes, he’s back. Omar rears his head in the open, he and new lover Dante casing a stash house, intent on a raid, only to be pre-empted by two people with the same idea in mind: two young women with their own guns. That’s not something you see every day, Mr Little muses.\n\nOnce the show proper starts, he and Dante co-opt the ladies into their scheme, most successfully, though Dante sulks, even through Omar’s practical demonstration of the truth that he don’t go for no babes.\n\nIt’s like that in the early episodes of a season of The Wire, tidewater running up a beach in long rills that have nothing to do with each other, except that it’s the same beach and somewhere ahead is a high tide line where it all comes together. Until then, we try to make sense of all the different stories slowly advancing.\n\nThere’s Bunk and Lester in Philly on a ship where no-one speaks English. There’s Valchek’s stolen surveillance van starting its trip round the world with a photo from every port to wind him up. There’s Jimmy facing more difficulties with Elena over their separated marriage and determined to get his teeth into the case of the dead hookers, put a name to one of them so she gets true burial, not a future as a medical cadaver and unknown cremation. There’s Daniels, who’s put his papers in, getting out.\n\nThere’s Avon Barksdale in prison, still running things through his proxy, Stringer Bell. Officer Tilghman is running heroin into the prison, and d’Angelo’s using. So Stringer tracks down Tilghman’s supplier, Blind Butchie, levers him into passing Tilghman bad dope, which causes ODs. Whilst Avon gets Dee to give the round a miss tonight, out of love, family. And Stringer visits Donette, Dee’s baby-momma, to quietly tell her to see Dee in prison more often, shore him up on the twenty he’s doing, and equally quietly fuck her rigid.\n\nAnd the new Detail’s doing nothing in addition to getting nowhere, and why not since Burrell has stuffed it full of humps. But Prez explains to his father-in-law how the old Detail worked, what they got and how much further it could have gotten if Burrell hadn’t shot it down. Which, fuelled by the arrival of the van’s first holiday snap, maddens Valchek into demanding a real Detail, headed by that Black Lieutenant who commanded the first one, or he’ll create a stink.\n\nAnd, always another and, Nicky and Ziggy steal a container of digital cameras from the docks, to sell to the Greek’s operation.\n\nAnd more of this next week. Just watch.\n\nThe highlight of the episode came midway. McNulty invades Homicide to speak to Bunk and Lester, who now have a plain-clothes Beadie Russell working alongside them (wearing exactly the kind of pant suit in muted colours recommended to her by Landsman in an earlier brilliant scene but not as good as this one’s going to be). Jimmy’s enthused. He’s got a theory to explain what the case is about, but before he can open his mouth Moreland and Freamon, doing a classic Morecambe & Wise double act, tell him what he’s going to tell them in every detail. Talk about wind and sails! I loved it.\n\nThat is what makes The Wire work the way it does: intelligence. It is, and it assumes you are. And it will go on being intelligent for a long time yet. Starting next week.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAt the beginning, there’s fog, there’s always fog. Down at the Port of Baltimore, let’s call it sea-mist. In the mist you see the shapes of large, blundering things, like sea-monsters. You need to wait, to see what these monsters are going to be, when the mist clears.\n\nThe Wire season 2 is generally the least-regarded, though not by me. It’s the outlier, the one least connected from the ongoing thread of events in Baltimore, that enters here when the audience was expecting some form of more-of-the-same-only, and exits after twelve episodes without recurring. It spreads its field of vision wide. It’s about the Port, and how it is dying, and so too is industry and the simplicity, the safety of working with your hands.\n\nSo we see a lot of threads, spread about, and we’re left to make connections between them for ourselves. David Simon and Ed Burns have taken to heart the advice given by James Tiptree Jr, SF writer: “Begin at the end, preferably 25,000 feet underground, then DON’T EXPLAIN!”\n\nLet’s sum up the directions we’re heading. Beadie Russell, having found 13 dead hookers, suffocated, finds no-one wants to claim responsibility for solving a baker’s dozen whodunnits. Easier if they’re natural causes. Throw in one disgruntled Marine Police and former Detective named McNulty, and soon enough those cases can be proven to be murder, and not just murder but the jurisdiction of the Baltimore City Police Homicide unit, commander Colonel Bill Rawls. The partnership of Bunk Moreland and Lester Freamon finds a certain black humour in it, until Sgt. Landsman makes them eat the cases.\n\nAh, McNulty. Drinks fourteen Jamesons, turns up at Rhonda Pearlman’s house at 2.00am. He’s too drunk to fuck her then and too hungover to fuck her in the morning so what does she get out of it? Jimmy’s also too drunk not to tell her his wife Elena wants them to get back together, try again, for the sake of the kids.\n\nThen there’s the ignorant and petty little fuck that’s Major Valchek, who can’t see past the end of his nose even with binoculars. Because Frank Sobotka got in first with the stained glass window, Valchek’s determined to fuck him up. The IBS (International Brotherhood of Stevedores) can’t have raised the money legitimately, they’re dying, it must be dirty. Valchek gets, of all things, a new Detail. Only Pres carries over from the original one, and the standard is fairly represented by the reassignement of Detective ‘Who signs the overtime slips?’ Polk. Meanwhile, Valchek’s Division, under Sgt Carver, is hassling the Port workers over every little petty infraction that can come into Valchek’s pointy little head.\n\nSpeaking of Details, there’s Lt. Cedric Daniels, buried in Evidence Control, his career dead. His wife persuades him it’s time to hand in his papers, use his talents where they will be appreciated.\n\nAnd speaking of Sobotka and the IBS, yes, of course he’s in bed with what’s dirty. Frank doesn’t like the surprise of being connected of dead bodies but he’s happy to face down Valchek. A war starts.\n\nDid I say whodunnits? The case of the thirteen dead women – fourteen, don’t forget McNulty’s floater last week – is easily solved, but the Greek and Vondas have the advantage of knowledge not available to Bunk and Lester, not to mention interrogation techniques that a Court might call… questionable. Case solved. The Greek has lost fourteen girls, that’s four million, a year. But he is not worried. There are always more girls.\n\nBut let us not forget the first season, even though that’s now a very much secondary thread. Barksdale in prison, still guiding his empire, via Strinbger on the outside. Wee-Bay getting hassle from a guard who thinks that just because they’re in prison, he’s got the upper hand. And d’Angelo, carrying the weight of a twenty, not exactly full of family feeling.\n\nShapes in the fog, some more clear of design than others. Outlines, to be filled in. Connections to be made, or not as the case may be. And reviewers on imdb complaining that it wasn’t exactly the same as everything else so they knew what was going on. Tchah!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIn the end it played out the way it was always going to play out. It’s all in the Game, and in the Game you win or you lose, and you accept the outcome either way. But you don’t stop the Game. It outlasts everyone. Only the names and the faces change, and the colour of the abandoned sofa in the middle of the low-rises from which that particular scenario is supervised.\n\nSo, what happened? Without the wire, the Detail’s days are numbered. There’s still plenty to do. Avon Barksdale is in custody but there are others, and murders, and money, and corruption, all traceable. Daniels has got the men, the leads, the talents to take the case wherever it needs to go but the one thing he hasn’t got is the will, the politicial or bureaucratic will, to pursue it.\n\nThings are breaking down. Daniels, McNulty and Freamon try to keep the momentum going by taking it to the FBI but in these post-9/11 days the Bureau has protocols: anti-terrorism, corruption, but not drugs, and not provincial warlords controlling West Baltimore. It doesn’t play.\n\nd’Angelo does. He flips, gives the Detail absolutely everything, lets it reach into every tentacle. And then he flips back, the importance of family overcoming his desire to get out, to start afresh. No testimony. Twenty years. Avon gets seven. Nothing leads to Stringer so he’s free to helm operations on Barksdale’e behalf. His information puts the Police onto Wee-Bay, who manfully cops to all sorts of murders, including ones the Detail know he didn’t do. Clearances, though. Clearances. And yes, he did Little Man.\n\nAnd slowly we see how things play out for the Detail. Herc and Carver both pass the Sergeant’s exam. Daniels identifies Carver as the leak in the Detail, but understands the pressures put on him by the Deputy Commissioner. He talks to him about the importance of deciding whether he’s on the side of himself or of the work. Carver is promoted to Sergeant ahead of Herc, but Herc seems to have learnt the lesson too.\n\nKima is recovering, slowly. Her partner wants her to give up the Police: nothing is worth what she’s gone through. McNulty agrees. Pres gets his gun back, goes back out on the street, but he’s more suited to the office. Daniels is passed over for that vacant Major’s position. McNulty is transferred out of Homicide, to the marine unit: this is your reward, Jimmy, for giving a fuck when it ain’t your turn to give a fuck. His replacement is Freamon, who partners up with Bunk. Bubbles is no longer clean.\n\nThe Wire‘s first season got only average viewer ratings. None of its five series did well in the ratings but at first HBO weren’t interested in those being high. It didn’t become a critically acclaimed series until later but it was brilliant from the start. It felt real to those of us who had no inkling of what real was. It had depth, texture, breadth, naturalism. It compelled your attention, both because of its rawness and because of its detail. It did not take you by the hand and lead you, you had to make sense of what you saw and heard for yourself, and for that you had to really look.\n\nThere was some doubt as to whether or not it would be renewed, but it was. When The Wire came back, it was something different entirely. As we’ll see, next week.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIt’s done, but it don’t know that it’s done.\n\nThere’s a false open, an ironic scene. Greggs is still touch and go. Daniels can go see her but McNulty can’t, paralysed by his own guilt and the drink he’s trying to drown it in. Can’t support her, can’t do his job, in fact he’s denying the job, his own personal Judas. Never believed in it, never cared, it was all about him, big fucking smartarse Jimmy McNulty, let everyone look up to him. But Daniels cuts him down: the political policeman is now committed to the very limit. It’s personal, both the Detail and the Police they may still lose.\n\nBut it’s already done. Barksdale and Stringer shut down the pagers, the phones, complete change. The Wire is dead. Anything that could hurt them, anything that could link Barksdale to anything is to be cleaned up. Yeah, Little Man is no problem, permanently. Wee-Bay is strong, so too is Sorvino. But everybody else? The Security Guard whose ‘changed’ testimony started all of this in episode 1 dies in the street. The little n***** who fingered Omar’s bitch? He’s another weak link.\n\nThat’s Wallace, who’s out of the Game. d’Angelo refuses to gve up his name, not even to his uncle or Stringer. d’Angelo has his limits and he’s protecting Wallace, who has made the mistake of coming back, bored at the seaside, homing instinct, wants back in the Game. It’s his last mistake. Stringer goes behind Dee to Boadie: he and Poot will do what’s asked. Three friends. Three kids who’ve grown up together. They take Wallace, unsuspecting, into his own house, having cleared the kids out. Wallace doesn’t suspect until Boadie, bad, hard Boadie, blaming Wallace for being a weak-assed n*****, this is all his fault, pulls out his gun. He can hardly fire. One shot. not fatal, not instantly. The younger, quieter, more doubting Pooh, exasperated, takes the gun and fires two, ending it.\n\nAll around, things are in their death spiral. Burrell wants the detail run down, Santangelo and Sydenor go back to their units. With the wire dead, Freamon sends Pres to check campaign contributions, which scares a lot of people. Senator Clay Davis moves onscreen, a meeting with Burrell and Daniels, to assure the latter there is nothing to look into, all clean as a whistle and above board. But Daniels is now rigid. Even with the prospect of promotion to Major, command of the North-West Division, dangled before him, he will not stop, he will not let the Detail end, he will continue to the full extent of their 90 day warrant. Even threatened with exposure of what the FBI hinted at before to McNulty, he is unbending. There were rumours, yes, lots of them, but not just about him. If his shit gets exposed, so will everybody else’s, and Burrell would rather live with shit than be embarrassed by bad publicity being shovelled around.\n\nThings fall apart, the centre cannot hold. Freamon plants a wire in the vacant office next door to Barksdale’s office at Orlando’s. They pick up Avon sending Dee to New York to pick up a re-up. The Police pick up Dee coming back with 1kg. Dee’s hard, he won’t give McNulty and Daniels anything. He refuses to believe them when they tell him Wallace is dead. Not at first. But McNulty undermines his trust in Levy, Avon’s crooked lawyer, and Stringer’s refusal to even speak of Wallace sees Dee flex his muscles, break away. He has his limits.\n\nSo it ends with McNulty and Daniels arresting Avon Barksdale. No fuss, no bother, no resistance. Stringer stays free. The bracelets are on. Freamon’s starting to get a handle on what Barksdale’s purchases are all about. There’s one episode left: will they win, after all? The answer is in asking the question.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThis is almost too good an episode. Describing it, analysing it is futile. Better to simply say Watch The Damned Thing and Shut The F*** Up. But then you’d have had to have watched the ten episodes that came before it to see this episode in its real place. It can’t be taken alone.\n\nBecause this is the point where everything, no matter how diffuse its been, funnels together into a single channel. This is where we start swimming furiously towards the end, where the pieces start to fall together. It’s also the end of the season. The rest is just aftermath.\n\nKima Greggs has been shot, badly. Two bullets, one still inside her. In the hospital, unresponsive. Prognosis undetermined. And both sides of the game are concentrating on what happened at the end of the last episode. The Police are on it, in force. It’s one of their own. You don’t let them do that, you don’t let it stand, you go in hard and fast and you let them know who you are. Everyone’s there, in the night, gathering every bit of possible evidence. No-one’s dispassionate. They’re professional, they take care over their jobs. But everybody’s invested. This is Kima. They’re doing it for her.\n\nYou can’t analyse that. The Wire is and always has been real, has felt real, but this is just stunning. The intensity, the range of responses, the differing levels of sincerity, diminishing the higher up you go. McNulty’s near crack-up. Rawls’ speech to him which is unbelievable, which is note perfect, how good John Doman is in this and how good Dominic West, who doesn’t get a word. If you were to hang someone for hitting the least false note, both men would be immortal.\n\nAnd it’s the same on the other side, the Barksdale gang. They fucked up, they fucked up in the biggest fucking way you can fuck up, they shot a cop. You don’t do that, you don’t bring that kind of shit down on yourself, that sort of shit gets 5-O involved.\n\nSo Savino, who led them into the trap, is surrendered up for three years, for peddling fake dope, the only thing they can get him on. And the shooters, Little Man, who gets nervous and disappears, possibly permanently, and Wee-Bay, who accepts the consequences and takes off for Philadelphia, stay quiet, move beyond reach.\n\nBut that’s not all. Something must be seen to be done by the Police, to save face, to pretend they are THE LAW and that something is a city-wide bust, 11.00 am, hit stashes everywhere. Put dope on the table for the TV cameras and pretend it’s a coup. The Detail has to jump through this hoop too but they’re going to keep Barksdale’s main stash behind, to keep building on top of that. Except that Burrell has it too: there’s a snitch in the detail. (Or is there? Suddenly, Judge Phelan’s not riding into battle for McNulty. Everybody’s got their own future to look out for).\n\nSo Barksdale’s main stash is hit too. The Detail has been fucked over by their own side. It’s over. We just have to watch the crumbling.\n\nOne more scene, superb. d’Angelo gets summoned suddenly to Stringer Bell, told to go with Wee-Bay, no explanations. Dee’s shit-scared and he needs to be. This has every hallmark of an execution. We’re scared with him: this isn’t just any television series where we know the characters in the cast list are safe. The Wire will go anywhere, do anything. But don’t worry, all it is is that Wee-Bay keeps tropical fish, and he need Dee to keep feeding them whilst he’s gone. We laugh, as much out of relief as anything.\n\nThen the beeps and screens of the wiretap merge into those of the hospital monitors watching over the prone and still Kima Greggs. An irrecoverable moment has passed. Was this only an hour?\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nBits and pieces, always bits and pieces. People’s lives, their individual concerns, their everydays, flowing forward, all heading in the same general direction but not by the same route, sometimes not even on the same street. Most of it ties in, one way or another, into the tide of The Wire‘s first season, in which we’re now over two-thirds of the way there, but some of it is just the stuff that happens in peopl’s lives at the same time, like d’Angelo trying to work out why Shardene has upped and left him, or Elena McNulty dragging jimmy into Court to further draw out her hatred of him, and even the very slowly developing relationship between Shardene and, of all people, Freamon.\n\nBut mostly it’s about the Wire.\n\nThe episode opens with the near silent scene of Bubbles sitting on a bench in the sunshine, taking in the innocent sights of kids at play, mothers with babies. He’s clean, a few days, and without a word the struggle is showing. Omar’s been shot, he’s in pain, he needs McNulty and Greggs to bring in a friendly Doctor, off the books. Stringer wants to build a wall around Avon Barksdale, insulate him even further from engagement in the Game. In anyone else you’d suspect a separate game, beginning the slow transfer of power and then ownership from one n***** to another, but String is loyal, serously loyal.\n\nThey get the word out, offer a truce to Omar, a parley to be monitored by Proposition Joe, but it’s a fake to draw Omar out where he can be gunned down. Omar knows it. Omar’s heading for New York, try his Game there. Orlando’s sideline is a sting operation, busted by the State Police, who bring him to the Detail.\n\nThings are progressing on the Wire. Judge Phelan signs another thirty days tap on a new payphone, but he’s up for re-election and his fellow Democrats are starting to shift him to the margins because he’s bucking the system. Freamon gets onto Barksdale’s main stash. McNulty gets onto Wallace, who’s ready to spill, except when it comes to d’Angelo, because Dee was good to him. Wallace has gone, you can see it just by how he sits, nothing more. You can sense what is coming.\n\nIt’s good work, good police work. It’s slow but certain, building a case locked into place, but it’s not what the Department wants, and Orlando gives Deputy Commissioner Burrell the chance he wants. Use him for a Buy-and-Bust, the traditional way, the limited way, get a bust, wrap up the detail, heavy on the PR, close the Detail. That’s an order.\n\nSo Kima Greggs, dolled up all fancy, painted and primped, goes in with Orlando. Carver, one of the stupid detectives, sees it clearest. He’s afraid it’s a trap, Barksdale knows Orlando’s been busted, why wouldn’t they assume he’s snitched. And he’s right. All the bits and pieces fuse into one story, one thing, one moment of importance. The trap works, the Detail loses Kima, the guns appear, there’s shooting, the shit is suddenly very real indeed, they’re tearing around trying to find her, they’re panicking and they should be fucking panicking and when they get there, Orlando has been shot and is dead, and Kima has been shot and is…\n\nBut we don’t know. The only thing we know is that we can’t be certain what will happen, because this is not safe television and things won’t happen according to precedent. All those little unconnected pieces of the last forty five minutes have been signposts to this moment, and like the street signs, twisted round to confuse the Police as to where they are, so too were these signposts. This is the moment to binge until the end…\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAngles and threads. Always angles and threads.\n\nRunning down the middle of this episode was the event that gave it it’s title, a game of basketball. It’s the annual game, West vs East, Projects, that is, played for pride and shit, the two sides coached by the respective kingpins of West and East Baltimore, namely Avon Barksdale and Proposition Joe Stewart, a first appearance but not last for Barksdale’s rival and equivalent in the Game, played fine in compare and contrast by Robert F. Chew.\n\nThe game is the thing that interrupts the Game, everyone leaving their places, their streets, their corners, to cheer on. Herc and Carver stumble on it, realise Barksdale’s there, in person, in the flesh. The Detail, or at least half of them, pull out to trail him, four cars, circling, watching from different angles, but Barksdale’s too sharp, he knows they’re there, he boxes them in and drives off, wagging an admonitory finger at Lt. Daniels.\n\nBut another game is being played, it’s all gmes today. Omar cheerfully and patiently robs Barksdale of a stash and takes it to Proposition Joe. Free, gratis and for nothing, nothing except a way to contact Barksdale, lead him into a trap so that Omar can bushwack him on the street, only it don’t go down that way and Omar takes one to the shoulder instead.\n\nBut an episode of The Wire is never about one thing only and today is all about games. Wallace wants out of the Game, wants to go back to School. d’Angelo lets him go, stakes him some money, but Pooh and Boadie are suspicious and Pooh sees him, buying cocaine.\n\nFreamon takes the Detail into the next logical area of enquiry. After following the drugs, you follow the money, an old and honourable phrase and game. Companies and fronts. Cut-outs. Shells. But everything has got a name on a piece of paper and he, Pres and Sydnor start making connections as to what Barksdale’s doing, buying up properties in run-down areas, but not yet why.\n\nThreads. Bubbles plays a game to steal a small stash but he gets burned, it’s baking soda. He sees Waylon (Steve Earle) down the Pit, trying to get his nephew to quit. Bubs wants to quit, again. His sister won’t have him in the house but she allows him a back door key and a sofa in her basement, somewhere solid, stable, where he can make the attempt. But he can’t come up the stairs.\n\nGames. Freamon and Greggs pull is Orlando’s dancer and stripper Shanine (Wendy Grantham), the girl who’s fucking Dee. They’re out to turn her, turn her into a CI. Shanine knows as little as she can possibly manage about the players at Orlando’s, she’s clean, she’s straight, she do her job, but they force knowedge on her in the form of Kesha, the girl who OD’d, the girl they blamed for her own death, rolled into a rug and dumped in an alley. It turns her, and not merely her stomach.\n\nClive James once commented that the mark of a strong series was that it could introduce a new and major player at a late stage without unbalancing things. The Wire has done this in this episode. And it still has no idea of whether it will be renewed for a second season.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
