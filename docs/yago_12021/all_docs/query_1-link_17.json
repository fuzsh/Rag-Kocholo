        "text": "If you ask fans of David Simon and HBO’s revered crime epic The Wire which of its five seasons is the worst, you’re likely to get one of two responses. The first is to say that season two is the worst, these people are wrong and should be shunned and avoided at all costs. The second, correct, opinion is that season five is the worst. To be blunt; it loses a lot of the nuance and subtlety that makes the rest of the series so great. It regresses the arcs of numerous characters. It spends far too much of its ten episodes hustling to tie together disparate plot points from prior seasons to provide some kind of resolution to some kind of overarching plot in what was always an anthology series with a few recurring characters.\n\nSo yes, compared to the other four near-perfect seasons, season five of the Wire is lacking. You know what else season five of the Wire is? Fun. Like a lot of dumb, crowd-pleasing, good old fashioned fun. Is our hero and high functioning alcoholic extraordinaire Jimmy McNulty inventing a serial killer to get more funding for the bankrupt Baltimore Police Department a good plot compared to prior seasons? Not at all. But it’s fun. Omar Little surviving a three story fall off a balcony with no explanation but a broken leg and then hobbling around West Baltimore with a broomstick crutch still sticking guys up is fun. The ever-corrupt Herc going private sector and hanging out with the Barksdales’ slimy lawyer Levy is fun (not to mention well thought out, more on that later). Jimmy having to sit quietly and attempt to melt into the carpet while the FBI behavioral analysis unit profiles him and exactly him as the “Red String Killer” is fun. All the callbacks and cameos (Nick Sobotka from season 2! John Munch from Homicide: Life on the Street and Law and Order SVU!) are fun.\n\nGiven how wacky many of its major plot points are, it’s somewhat remarkable how cutting season five still manages to be. David Simon, a former newspaperman, deploys all the venom available to him in tarring, feathering, and skinning alive the institutional rot at the heart of the local news establishment through the genuinely despicable character of Scott Templeton, a spineless little twerp who embodies the careerism and dereliction of ethics and duty that The Wire spent virtually its whole run railing against. The man is careerism incarnate, willing to just make up a story that captures his idiot boss’s precious “Dickensian Aspect” (a phrase that still makes me laugh at how meaningless it is) so long as it expedites his ticket out of shitty little Baltimore so he can go be dishonest and mediocre in New York or DC. Templeton almost feels prophetic given that this was aired in 2008 and the newsrooms of our newspapers of record are currently occupied by beneficiaries of nepotism and careerist hacks with no actual belief system here in 2020. The whole Baltimore Sun subplot is a bit hit and miss but when its good it’s good in a way that still feels fresh for a show in its fifth season. This includes the series’ closest thing to an author self-insert on David Simon’s part in Gus Haynes, the foul-mouthed, pot stirring city editor unwilling to kiss rings or suffer fools. The existence of the character is perhaps a bit dubious but as Gus serves as the yin to Templeton’s yang I’ll let it slide. Someone needs to not be awful.\n\nSay what you will about anything else this season, but McNulty trapping Templeton in his own lie and flat out admitting that he’s made the “red string killer” up just to make him squirm is pitch perfect. McNulty’s character takes a step back in many ways in season five, falling back into bad habits (I may be underselling crippling alcoholism and an obsessive compulsive drive to do meaningful police work as “bad habits”) and undoing what was a very satisfying resolution to his arc along with his relationship with Beadie Russell. After finally getting himself together in season four it’s disappointing to see McNulty self-destruct yet again. The same cannot be said of Thomas “Herc” Hauk. Fresh off ruining poor Randy Wagstaff’s life through sheer inhuman apathy and getting thrown out of the police department for pulling over and harassing a minister, Herc is none the worse for wear. In fact he’s doing great in his new very profitable private sector job. This is brilliant, it serves as a perfect thematic shorthand for the whole vibe of season five, nothing has changed after a supposedly transformative mayoral election, in fact everything has gotten worse. The good guys are broke and begging for another beer with worthless overtime slips, the bad guys are lining their pockets and buying another round for the house on their expense accounts. Like so many of the other real despicable people in the series, Herc never ever gets his comeuppance, not really. In fact I imagine he’d still be living comfortably somewhere, up to his ears in Blue Lives Matter merchandise. I wonder if he ever thinks about Carver, or Randy for that matter.\n\nSpeaking of genuinely despicable people, how bout that Clay Davis trial? I’ll be the first to admit that I thought Davis was going to at least end up in tennis-court jail for all his duplicity and open corruption, but season five masterfully turned it around on me. It’s a gut punch, especially considering all the people who have suffered, knowingly or indirectly, due to Davis’ greed and duplicity, but my God does it work. Like so many of The Wire’s best moments, it rings true even today, when have you ever known someone powerful to suffer the consequences of their actions?\n\nThis is getting too depressing. Hey Bubbles got a happy ending! And it was great! The long suffering dope-fiend/scrap metal thief/street entrepreneur/police informant finally hit rock bottom at the tail end of a season four where (to quote my roommate Matt) “everyone has a bad time.” Watching Bubbs confront his own guilt at the death of Sherrod, knit his grief-stricken psyche back together, and resolve to live a better, cleaner life is harrowing but heartwarming. Season five once and for all establishes Bubbs as the emotional heart of the series, and finishes his arc on a high note.\n\nThough despite this, and other high points, season five is still lacking a lot of what made the four before it great. You get the sense everything and everyone is just ready to wrap it up. But no one’s character is completely dragged through the mud, nothing totally pisses on the shows legacy, and the actual finale is great. The final moments of the show are something I revisit regularly.\n\nToo many shows in this era of prestige TV and “shows we need right now” get self-important down the stretch (assuming they don’t start out that way). They believe in their own good press too much. They want to go out in this grand finale that artfully ties together all the loose ends to complete the grand overarching story and leave us all breathless, and it usually fails hilariously. The Wire was smart enough to realize the impossibility of tying it all up with a neat bow. In finding a happy medium between playing the hits and trying to resolve the plots that needed resolution, the series managed a controlled descent before the curtain went down, and sometimes that’s the best you can hope for."
