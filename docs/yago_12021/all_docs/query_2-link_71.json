        "text": "SEASON 1 We’re introduced to the theme and the character that will thread through the series: drugs, and the smart, disillusioned, drunk Baltimore homicide detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West). McNulty’s anger when a member of the Barksdale drug gang is acquitted of murder charges spurs the creation of what will become the Major Crimes Unit and the introduction of other central law-enforcement characters: Lt. Cedric Daniels (Lance Reddick) and the unit members Kima Greggs (Sonja Sohn), Ellis Carver (Seth Gilliam), Prez Pryzbylewski (Jim True-Frost) and the eccentric Lester Freamon (Clarke Peters). These are the good guys, who, along with McNulty’s partner, Bunk Moreland (Wendell Pierce), and the prosecutor Rhonda Pearlman (Deirdre Lovejoy) do daily battle with crime and with their own bosses at police headquarters and City Hall.\n\nFreamon’s expertise leads to the development of the sophisticated wire-tapping scheme that gives the series its name and is used against the Barksdales: Avon (Wood Harris), the leader; D’Angelo (Larry Gilliard Jr.), his nephew; Stringer Bell (Idris Elba), Avon’s deputy; the enforcer Wee-Bey (Hassan Johnson); and the many street-level employees, including the likable corner boy Bodie (J D Williams). It’s an organization as organized and hierarchical as the institutions that fight it. The investigation concludes in typical “Wire” fashion, with several top Barksdale soldiers headed to jail but the family still in business, and with McNulty and Lieutenant Daniels transferred out of their jobs for displeasing the brass.\n\nSEASON 2 From his new post on a boat in the marine unit, McNulty becomes involved in the case of 14 young women found dead in a shipping container. Daniels is assigned to lead a different “investigation”: a harassing inquiry into the affairs of Frank Sobotka (Chris Bauer), a longshoremen’s union official who has unknowingly angered Maj. Stan Valchek (Al Brown) of the police by exceeding Valchek’s donation to their old church. That inquiry ends up dovetailing with McNulty’s case, and the story of corruption at the docks dominates the season. The investigations’ results are mixed, of course, but McNulty has the consolation of meeting the port authority police officer Beadie Russell (Amy Ryan).\n\nBack on the Barksdale front, Stringer Bell is running the business and making deals with rivals like the dealer Proposition Joe (Robert F. Chew)  and arranging killings  without Avon’s knowledge. This lack of communication brings into the action the freelance killer and thief Omar Little (Michael Kenneth Williams), one of the series’s most charismatic characters.\n\nSEASON 3 The Barksdales, Stringer Bell and the Major Crimes Unit, back in action under Daniels, return to center stage. Avon, now out of jail, and Stringer work together uneasily, with Stringer continuing his efforts to get all of Baltimore’s drug dealers to cooperate while Avon goes to war against the upstart Marlo Stanfield (Jamie Hector). With an eye to the future Stringer also tries to diversify into legitimate real estate development, though not always by legitimate means. Meanwhile Maj. Bunny Colvin (Robert Wisdom) decides to end his police career on a positive note by creating a de facto legalized-drugs zone in one of Baltimore’s abandoned neighborhoods, which succeeds in reducing overall crime. Major Colvin’s experiment does not end well, of course, and its ramifications mean bigger roles for characters at City Hall: the casually corrupt mayor, Clarence Royce (Glynn Turman); his police commissioner, Ervin Burrell (Frankie R. Faison); and a city councilman, Tommy Carcetti (Aidan Gillen), who thinks he can buck recent history by being elected mayor, a position no white man has held in years. As the tensions between Avon and Stringer reach a critical point, and Stringer runs afoul of the white establishment in his real estate venture, the two face operatic finales: Stringer in a violent confrontation with Omar, and Avon in a raid led by McNulty and his friends at the Major Crimes Unit. In the aftermath Marlo Stanfield solidifies his turf and McNulty, even more disgusted than usual, asks for a demotion to street cop.\n\nSEASON 4 The mayoral campaign heats up, and the Major Crimes Unit, which has again uncovered information embarrassing to Mayor Royce and Commissioner Burrell, is effectively disbanded. Detective Freamon, who lands in homicide alongside Bunk Moreland, tries to figure out how Marlo and his top lieutenants, Chris Partlow (Gbenga Akinnagbe) and the murderous young Snoop (Felicia Pearson), have taken over the old Barksdale corners without killing anyone. “Where are the bodies?” is the season’s refrain. Bodie, without the protection of the Barksdales, works a single corner with his own crew and tries to hold off Marlo. In the other major story line the school year begins, and Prez, who has left the force, takes up his new job as a middle-school math teacher. He becomes involved in the lives of four troubled students, Michael (Tristan Wilds), Randy (Maestro Harrell), Duquan (Jermaine Crawford) and Wee-bey’s son, Namond (Julito McCullum). McNulty, meanwhile, is happily walking the beat and living with Beadie and her children; he refuses continued requests from Daniels, now a major, to accept a promotion, and when he agrees to a night out with his old drinking buddy Bunk, he limits himself to a single beer. The season parallels the race for mayor, in which reality increasingly weighs on Carcetti, the idealistic councilman, with the school year, during which various good-hearted people  Prez; Bunny Colvin, busted out of the police force and now a consultant to a pilot program for troubled students; and Dennis (Cutty) Wise (Chad L. Coleman), an ex-convict who has started a boxing gym  learn the limits of the good they can do given their students’ tortured lives. It all comes back to drugs, as the season ends with some of the young men potentially escaping the streets and others entrenched on the corners. And McNulty, upset about his role in a young dealer’s death, rejoins the Major Crimes Unit. MIKE HALE"
