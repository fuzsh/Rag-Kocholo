        "text": "Saisyu KusanagiStoryMove ListGalleryQuotes\n\nSaisyu Kusanagi (草薙（くさなぎ） 柴舟（さいしゅう）) is a character who debuted in The King of Fighters '94 as a victim in Rugal Bernstein's gallery of defeated fighters. He appears as a mid-boss in The King of Fighters '95 and becomes a regular character for the first time in The King of Fighters '98.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nSaisyu is simply an older, more mellow version of his son Kyo. Regardless, he is just as arrogant and cocky as Kyo; like father, like son. This is quite evident based upon his attitude and body language during several win-poses; where he either laughs abruptly after winning a match (i.e. not taking the bout seriously), nonchalantly scratches his beard or generally seems uninvolved... or bored by rubbing his abdominal muscles in a laxidasical show of bravado.\n\nThe only characters that seem to make him even remotely contrary are Rugal (who defeated him back in KOF '94) and seemingly to a lesser extent Kyo (his savior, who subsequently also defeated him a year later in KOF '95). Ironically enough he seems to harbor no indication of resentment or ill-will in the slightest towards Vice (one of Rugal's secretaries; a dominatrix who indulges in sadism), she brainwashed him in KOF '95. Vice visibly holds Saisyu with contempt during their pre-fight scene due to his strong resistance giving her notable difficulty, by pointing at him and spitting. However, he assumes his fighting stance and never acknowledges her insulting behavior, and is probably not even aware (or even care) that Vice is a natural enemy of his clan.\n\nPowers[]\n\nPyrokinesis: Due to his Kusanagi heritage, Saisyu can control fire. He can create fire from thin air, create fire balls, deliver punches of fire, create pillars of fire and put his own body on fire. He is not immune to other types of fire. He cannot control other fires that he didn't create.\n\nSkills[]\n\nFishing: Saisyu is adept at fishing, having done so for quite some time as a hobby.\n\nGolf: Saisyu is a golf player, though probably does so to pass time.\n\nFighting Style[]\n\nSaisyu is a master of the Kusanagi martial arts, an ancient empty handed system that incorporates fire based attacks and kenpō. He uses the basic form of the Kusanagi style, his arsenal is simple yet effective, akin to Kyo's original take on the style prior to '96 (as Saisyu still uses the Yami Barai); oddly enough, Saisyu's original technique, Tsumugari (All-Eyes Reaper), makes use of Kyo's Aragami technique as its initial blow. Likewise, in KOF XIV, Kyo himself likely has his Yaegaki Climax DM follow a similar motion to the SDM Tsumugari in its vein (with the former actually being a Reverse Method version of Tsumugari).\n\nMusic[]\n\nHall, Bass and Melody - The King of Fighters '95\n\nIn Spite of One's Age - The King of Fighters '98, R-2\n\nVoice Actors[]\n\nToshimitsu Arai - The King of Fighters series ('95, '94 Re-Bout, Kyo)\n\nKeiichiro Sakagi - The King of Fighters series ('98/UM, 2000, Neowave)\n\nToshiharu Nakanishi - The King of Fighters movie (Japanese voice)\n\nHaruo Yamagishi - The King of Fighters: Destiny~present\n\nLive Action Actors[]\n\nHiro Kanagawa - The King of Fighters movie\n\nAppearances[]\n\nEtymology[]\n\nHis romanized given name uses the Kunrei-Shiki interpretation, reflecting his traditional personality. In modern romanization, his name can be read as Saishu as well.\n\nThe name Saisyu means \"brush/brushwood; firewood\" (柴) (sai) and \"boat, ship/shipping, vessel, watercraft, steamship\" (舟) (syu).\n\nInterestingly, Saishu/Saisyu as a romaji homophone can also mean \"the last\" or \"the end\".\n\nSaisyu's surname Kusanagi means \"grass, herb, weed\" (草) (kusa) and \"mow\" (薙) (nagi).\n\nKusanagi comes from Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi (which is the name Yamato Takeru gave to the Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi), a legendary Japanese sword and one of three Imperial Regalia of Japan that represents the virtue of valor.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nHe was originally meant to have died in KOF '94, but was added in at the last minute of developing stages for KOF '95.[1]\n\nEarly artwork shows Saisyu and Kyo having the Kusanagi symbol on their foreheads. The idea was referenced in one of the KOF Manhua's.\n\nIn Neo-Geo Freak 1998, the characters in KOF '98 have their own interviews. Here are Saisyu's response to the questions.https://archive.org/details/Neo-Geo_Freak_1998-08_Geibunsha_JP/page/n35\n\nWhat is your aspiration in this competition? - \"Well ... aspire ... I'm going to show the essence of Kusanagi style old martial art to my son. Sharpness of technology, power is still alive! I will make you feel the severity of battle now!\"\n\nWho would you like to fight the most? - \"I don't know who it is, but I heard there's a guy who imitates my old martial arts … I want to fight him.\"\n\nWho would you like to team up with? / Who would you not like to team up with? - \"Uh … Well … someone who seems to be right with me … Yeah … it seems Mr. Takuma would suit me well.\"\n\nWhat is \"KOF\" for you? - \"... reminds me of painful memories …! However, I will put an end to those painful memories through this tournament.\"\n\nFinally, please give a word to your fans. - \"Do not fall … you will write on fire dust!\"\n\nInterestingly, despite the fact that his Kamukakari (Divine Consult) is a special move, it can be reversed/countered by Blue Mary's Head Buster, a move that normal counters only normals and command normals.\n\nCards[]\n\nSprites[]\n\nGallery[]\n\nReferences[]"
