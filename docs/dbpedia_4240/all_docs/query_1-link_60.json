Super Show! episode, On Her Majesty's Sewer Service. After Princess Peach recruits Mario and Luigi, they meet Secret Agent N and he introduces himself. Luigi says \"I see\" followed by N saying, \"Not C. N.\" Mario responds with \"Oh,\" leading N to say, \"Not O. N. Agent O's on holiday.\" Agent O is never mentioned again after this.\n\nAgent Smith[edit]\n\nAgent Smith is a character from the Matrix film series. In Welcome to Greedville, he is referenced in the memo written by Thaddeus P. Gradgrind, which can be found in the Pyramid Theater.\n\nA gossip-loving Toad[edit]\n\nMain article: Toad Town News\n\n\"A gossip-loving Toad\" is a character who posts scribbles on the back side of the notice board in Toad Town during the events of Paper Mario. This character's posts are mainly gossips about Princess Peach. They also report that Mario has been defeated by Bowser and that Tayce T.'s cooking class will be canceled for a while. Some scribblers sign themselves as \"A little Toad,\" \"A scribble-loving little Toad,\" etc., but the name \"A gossip-loving Toad\" appears most frequently (5 times in total).\n\nNames in other languages\n\nLanguage Name Meaning Japanese うわさだいすきキノピオ[2]\n\nUwasa Daisuki Kinopio\n\nGossip-loving Toad\n\nApefucius[edit]\n\nApefucius was mentioned in the Donkey Kong Country television series episode \"Kong Fu\" by the episode's titular character in a song. Apefucius was the one who taught Kong Fu that \"The mind must be as sharp as a wisdom tooth.\" Apefucius is a reference to the famous Chinese philosopher Confucius.\n\nAshley's parents[edit]\n\nAshley's parents are mentioned on the WarioWare, Inc. official website in Ashley's profile.\n\nAunt Maria[edit]\n\nAunt Maria is an aunt of Mario and Luigi's who is briefly mentioned by Luigi in the The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3 episode \"Crimes R Us.\" While Mario and Luigi look at clouds, Luigi comments that one of them resembles their Aunt Maria. An Aunt Maria is also mentioned in the book Doors to Doom, where Donkey Kong Jr.'s yell is compared to a cross between Tarzan's ululation and the screech Aunt Maria makes when the Mario Bros. walk on her newly waxed floor.\n\nBachelor's girlfriend[edit]\n\nBachelor's girlfriend is the unseen love interest of Bachelor in the Game Boy Advance version of Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!. Bachelor implies that she is \"hot,\" and he is currently dating her. Like Bachelor, she is presumably a bear herself.\n\nBarbara the Bush[edit]\n\nThis section is about the Nintendo Comics System character. For the Assist Trophy, see List of Assist Trophy characters § Barbara. For the character based on Barbara Bush, see Mrs. President.\n\nBarbara the Bush is a character who Stanley the Talking Fish mentions in the first Nintendo Comics System story, \"The Fish That Should've Gotten Away\". Stanley tells Mario about his relationship with Barbara, asking Mario how to tell the other trees that he is only interested in Barbara.\n\nIn \"Love Flounders\", Stanley reveals that he has broken up with Barbara, claiming their relationship was \"just guppy love\".\n\nBig Bama and Neutron B[edit]\n\n“While listening to country music, I do ten sets of 100 push-ups each. That's how I do such powerful attacks!! And also because I watch pro wrestling!! I like to cheer for Big Bama and Neutron B!!”\n\n—Wario, Wario Land 4 instruction manual, page 39\n\nBig Bama and Neutron B are Wario's favorite pro wrestlers, as mentioned in the Wario Land 4 instruction manual.\n\nBig Rock Who Watches[edit]\n\nThe Big Rock Who Watches seems to be the deity of the Cragnons of Super Paper Mario. In the opening of Chapter 5, two Cragnons are shown praying for the survival of their people, who are being terrorized by the Floro Sapiens, and when Mario falls into their midst, they believe he was sent by the Big Rock Who Watches to save them. Big Rock Who Watches may be a fourth-wall-breaking reference to the player, similar to other allusions to the player by other characters in the game.\n\nNames in other languages\n\nLanguage Name Meaning French Grand Rocher qui regarde\n\nBig Rock who watches\n\nSpanish (NOE) Gran Roca Que Todo Lo Ve[3]\n\nGreat Rock Who Sees It All\n\nBilly[edit]\n\nBilly is a crow from Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door who is the son of Bob and Maude. His mom is contemplating saving for his college fund after hearing about Ronnie.\n\nBluebeard Baboon[edit]\n\nBluebeard Baboon is a pirate mentioned in the Donkey Kong Country TV series episode \"The Curse of Kongo Bongo\". One thousand years before the events in the show, his ship, for unexplained reasons, sank, killing him. Every one hundred years afterward, his ghost will rise out of the ocean and deliver to everyone a letter containing \"the curse of the double doubloon\"; the letter, which is actually a description of the curse, states that anybody who reads it twice will cause the Crystal Coconut to lose its power and the island to sink into the ocean. His name is a reference to Edward Teach, an infamous pirate better known as Blackbeard.\n\nBluster Kong's mother[edit]\n\nBluster Kong's mother is a character that is commonly referenced in the Donkey Kong Country TV series. She has been stated to be the owner of Bluster Barrelworks. Bluster is occasionally heard speaking with her on a mobile phone.\n\nBob[edit]\n\nBob is a crow from Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, who is mentioned in his wife Maude's conversation with Flo after Doopliss is defeated.\n\nBobolink[edit]\n\n“I want to marry Bobolink in a shocker wedding.”\n\n—Swob, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door\n\nBobolink is a female Bob-omb with whom Swob is in love. During this period of his life, Swob writes about his marriage on a rock on the fiftieth floor of Rogueport's Pit of 100 Trials. He also writes that he wants to have 22 children, so his family can play soccer matches. He believes that any wish written on the fiftieth floor of the Pit will come true. He uses a \"special big explosion\" to get down to the fiftieth floor and writes the graffiti so fiercely that it would be almost impossible to remove. When he finds out that this is a hoax, he files a request at the Trouble Center. Mario accepts the trouble and has Admiral Bobbery destroy the wall after reading the wish.\n\nHer name is a pun on \"Bob-omb\" and \"bobolink\", a species of blackbird.\n\nNames in other languages\n\nLanguage Name Meaning Japanese ボムリン\n\nBomurin\n\nPortmanteau of「ボム兵へい」(Bomuhei, \"Bob-omb\") and Japanese female name ending「~リン」(-rin)\n\nFrench Bombatiana\n\nFrom bombe (\"bomb\") and the female name \"Tatiana\"\n\nItalian Petardina\n\nFrom petardo (\"firecracker\") and the feminine diminutive suffix -ina; it is also the female version of Swob's Italian name\n\nBog Monster[edit]\n\nThe Bog Monster is an apparently horrific creature that, according to Klump, eats everything in sight. It resides in the Forbidden Forest on Kongo Bongo Island, as stated in the Donkey Kong Country cartoon. As it is never seen, the only physical description given is in the lyrics to one of the songs in an, in which it is described as a monster having crystal skin, giant claws, dripping fangs, beady red eyes, stinky breath that could knock over a rhino, hair full of maggots, ears dripping something yellow, and arms thicker than a tree. Of course, this is when Donkey Kong saw it and that was Cranky Kong disguised as a Bog Monster, so this may not be an accurate description.\n\nIn the Donkey Kong Country episode \"Bug a Boogie\", it is revealed that Donkey Kong secretly feared the Bog Monster, as, when he was young, Cranky Kong told him that if he ventured into the Forbidden Forest, the Bog Monster would get him; one day, Donkey Kong disobeyed Cranky Kong and decided to go into the Forbidden Forest, only to encounter and subsequently be scared by a Bog Monster. It is later revealed to Donkey Kong by Cranky Kong that he had, in actuality, simply made up the story of the Bog Monster, and that it was him who scared Donkey Kong when he entered the Forbidden Forest, wanting to teach Donkey Kong a lesson in disobeying him.\n\nOddly, it seems the Bog Monster may have been an actual creature, since, at the end of \"Bug A Boogie\", Klump and Krusha, while trying to help King K. Rool out of a pit of quicksand he was stuck in, heard a monstrous roar in the Forbidden Forest, seemingly the Bog Monster.\n\nDiddy Kong also has the talent of mimicking the roar of one, while Funky Kong apparently growls like one when he sleeps.\n\nBomberto's wife[edit]\n\n“My wife brought my lunchbox to me, but it was empty when I opened it!”\n\n—Bomberto, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door\n\nBomberto's wife is mentioned by Bomberto during his trouble in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. In it, Bomberto's wife gives Bomberto his lunchbox for the day, but it is empty. As such, a hungry Bomberto asks Mario to bring him food instead.\n\nBowser's father[edit]\n\nBowser's father was briefly mentioned by him in the Nintendo Comics System issues \"Bedtime for Drain-Head\" and \"The Buddy System\". As Bowser's father was only mentioned in passing, not much is known about him, except that he was supposedly a criminal on the run, as Bowser told the captured Toad that he hoped to see his father on the television program \"Kingdom's Most Wanted\", which is seemingly a parody of America's Most Wanted, a show dedicated to helping catch criminals.\n\nAdditionally, Bowser also mentioned that his father was the one who taught him the life lesson \"Son, when you put your mind to it, there's no problem too big to run away from!\". Mama Koopa is another non-game character who could have been married to Bowser's father.\n\nIn the Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island arc in the Super Mario Kodansha manga series, Kamek is depicted taking orders from Baby Bowser's father, who hides in the palace's shadows, until it is revealed to be Raphael the Raven in disguise, à la the Wizard of Oz, under the orders of the actual king, who has gone to \"have fun\" (according to Kamek).\n\nIn Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and Super Paper Mario, an ambiguous portrait that resembles Bowser with a moustache appears in one of his castles, possibly being his father.\n\nBowser's grandfather[edit]\n\nBowser's grandfather is a character mentioned by Bowser in Mario Party Advance. In the quest Bowser: Accused!, Bowser states that the clock in his mansion belonged to his \"grandpappy\". It is unknown if that is true.\n\nBowser's sister[edit]\n\n“You remind me of my kid sister\n\nShe read so much, she got a blister\n\nA big one, I mean big\n\nOn her brain, what a shnook!”\n\n—Bowser, \"Ignorance is Bliss\"\n\nBowser's sister is one of Bowser's family members. She is only mentioned in the song \"Ignorance is Bliss\" when Bowser likens Peach to his sister because they both enjoy reading, which he views disparagingly. According to Bowser, his sister got a blister on her brain from all her reading.\n\nBreadward[edit]\n\nBreadward is a Pixl that was mentioned by Mimi in Super Paper Mario. Mimi (disguised as Merlee) attempts to swindle Mario and Princess Peach into signing a paper and earning the Pure Heart in exchange for some Rubees. If Mario and Peach refuse to sign the paper four times, she offers them Breadward, which she claims is made from \"oats and lard\". It is not known if Breadward actually exists, however.\n\nNames in other languages\n\nLanguage Name Meaning Japanese クサくナ～ル\n\nKusakuna~ru\n\nA stylistic variant of「臭くなる」(kusaku naru, \"to be stinky\")\n\nFrench Arthur\n\nGiven name\n\nItalian Arrosto\n\nRoast\n\nKorean 냄새나\n\nNaemsaena\n\nKorean word that translates to \"It smells\"\n\nSpanish Pasmino\n\nFrom pasmarote (\"halfwit\") and the name termination -ino\n\nBritney[edit]\n\nBritney is the lead female character in Toad Force V, an implied action TV show mentioned several times in Mario Party Advance; Britney herself is only brought up briefly by Mushbert in the mission DVD for Me.\n\nOne of the few things known about Britney is that she surpasses the hero of Toad Force V, Jack, in popularity among the show's fanbase, presumably making her the most popular character in the series. She is Jack's sidekick, and together they are the only known members of the Toad Force V group of protagonists. It is possible that she, like many other characters on the show, is a robotic Toad, but this is theoretical as she is simply identified as a \"Heroine\", and nothing more.\n\nBuzzo[edit]\n\nBuzzo is a character of unknown species addressed by both Laki's and Koopla's graffiti writings in Merlee's Basement in Super Paper Mario. Both of them express their love for Buzzo and each other in their messages.\n\nCabin Proprietor[edit]\n\nThe Cabin Proprietor is a character that owns the cabin found at near the starting point of Cool, Cool Mountain in Super Mario 64 and Super Mario 64 DS. On a sign outside the cabin is a message from the proprietor telling the player that they can enter the cabin by leaping down into the chimney, alluding to Santa Claus.\n\nThe Cannoli clan[edit]\n\nThe Cannoli clan is a family of thieves mentioned by Count Cannoli many times in Wario: Master of Disguise. They have been thieves for many generations. Count Cannoli and Goodstyle, who is actually the very first Cannoli, are the only family members seen in the game.\n\nIt is known that Goodstyle has been passed down in the family and that each family member has had their own machine (Cannoli had the Mad Hat Mk. I) and that each machine had a weakness. The Mad Hat Mk. II has been protecting the Cannoli family for generations, and is probably the whole family's machine.\n\nC. Parmesan[edit]\n\nC. Parmesan is a book author implied in the Study in Luigi's Mansion. In this room, there is a book titled Darkness is Their Cheese, which clues the player about the hidden cheese found in various rooms throughout the mansion, which spawn Gold Mice when examined with the Game Boy Horror. C. Parmesan's name is a reference to parmesan, a type of cheese.\n\nNames in other languages\n\nLanguage Name Meaning Japanese C・パルメザン\n\nC Parumezan\n\nC. Parmesan\n\nC.S. Booois[edit]\n\nC.S. Booois is the author of the book Basic Game Info found in The Bookshelf in the Lab on the Luigi's Mansion microsite. Their name is an allusion to English author C. S. Lewis.\n\nThe Cap'n[edit]\n\nThe Cap'n is a character that is mentioned in Super Mario 64 and its remake, Super Mario 64 DS. In a cavern accessible by swimming through an underwater tunnel past the ship in Jolly Roger Bay, there is a sign with a message from the Cap'n stating that anybody who enters will \"meet certain disaster.\" At the end of the cavern, another sign near a group of treasure chests contains a second message from the Cap'n, this time stating that to obtain his treasure, the player must open the treasure chests in the correct order, but does not explain what the order is. Opening the chests reveals that the Cap'n's \"treasure\" is the Power Star for the third mission.\n\nAs the word \"cap'n\" is simply short for the word \"captain\", the title has been used in other Super Mario games; an example of this is in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, where the captain of the S.S. Chuckola is referred to as \"Cap'n\" in one line of dialogue.\n\nChief Quimby[edit]\n\nChief Quimby is the chief of the Metro City police department. He regularly sends Inspector Gadget out on missions to stop Dr. Claw and his MAD Agents from pulling off evil schemes.\n\nChief Quimby, who was only ever referred to as \"The Chief\", had a minor role on The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!, in the live-action segment \"Defective Gadgetry\". In it, he called Inspector Gadget on his top-secret gadget phone and asked when Inspector Gadget would be coming over. As Inspector Gadget was awaiting repairs at Mario Brothers Plumbing, he told the Chief that he would be on his way as soon as Mario and Luigi repaired his gadgets.\n\nColonel Hubert Jefferson[edit]\n\nColonel Hubert Jefferson is Lucy Belle's great grandfather, and consequently Bones's second great uncle or cousin three times added (though the exact relation is left unspecified), who was mentioned in the Saturday Supercade episode \"Double or Nothing\". He had left behind a will stating that Mr. Bancroft would inherit his mansion unless Lucy Belle solved a certain rebus puzzle by the midnight following the will's reading, in which she would inherit the mansion instead.\n\nCranberry[edit]\n\n“Fear the curse, but find your Eclair.”\n\n—Cranberry, Super Luigi 4\n\nCranberry is the last of the Luffs. He played a very short, but integral part in Luigi's adventure during the events of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door.\n\nLuigi met Cranberry in Rapturous Ruins, where he was found sleeping. With a sneeze (a soft call in the Super Luigi novelization), Luigi awoke Cranberry and earned the ability to speak his language; Cranberry explained that the Luffs were once a great empire because of their use of the Marvelous Compass's powers, but they were cursed because of their greed. Seeing his own people fall into ruin, Cranberry decided to split the compass into seven parts to avoid the repetition of the Luffian fate, hiding six Marvelous Compass pieces and keeping one with himself in Rapturous Ruins. For a thousand years, Cranberry awaited a hero to complete the Marvelous Compass and save Princess Eclair. Luigi turned out to be this noble-hearted hero, and Cranberry promptly gave him the last compass piece. His purpose fulfilled, Cranberry then faded away with a joyful smile.\n\nCranberry is similar to Merlumina in many ways. Both are members of ancient civilizations who slept for unthinkable amounts of time awaiting heroes to accept the fragments of treasure they held.\n\nNames in other languages\n\nLanguage Name Meaning Japanese クランベリー[4]\n\nKuranberī\n\nCranberry\n\nChinese (simplified) 克兰贝瑞\n\nKèlánbèiruì\n\nCranberry\n\nChinese (traditional) 克蘭貝瑞\n\nKèlánbèiruì\n\nCranberry\n\nDutch Kwini\n\nFrom kwini (a small, mango-like fruit)\n\nFrench Canneberge\n\nCranberry\n\nGerman Windros\n\nFrom \"windrose\" (a symbol on maps used to indicate the compass directions)\n\nItalian Mirtillo\n\nBlueberry\n\nKorean 크랜베리\n\nKeulaenbeli\n\nCranberry\n\nSpanish Mermeladio\n\nFrom mermelada (\"jam\") with Spanish name ending \"-io\"\n\nCranky Kong's great grandfather[edit]\n\n“Yes, but it's no ordinary one though! It was Cranky's great grandfather's! I can't let it go for less than 50 coins.”\n\n—Bazaar, Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!\n\nCranky Kong's great grandfather was briefly mentioned by Bazaar in Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!.\n\nWhen Dixie or Kiddy Kong inquire about the Mirror that Bazaar is selling for fifty bear coins, Bazaar will mention that it belonged to Cranky Kong's great grandfather and that he cannot let it go for a lower price since it is an antique.\n\nCurtis[edit]\n\nCurtis is a person supposedly known by Tommy Treehugger personally, as in the Club Mario episode accompanying \"The Unzappables\", Tommy says hi to his mom, Curtis, and Luke.\n\nDavid Manning[edit]\n\nDavid Manning is a fictional character involved in a film promotion scandal in the early 2000s. In Welcome to Greedville, he is referenced in the memo written by Thaddeus P. Gradgrind, which can be found in the Pyramid Theater.\n\nDark Dirk[edit]\n\nDark Dirk is mentioned as being the evil twin and mortal enemy of the superhero Dirk Drain-Head.\n\nDark Mage[edit]\n\nThe Dark Mage is a character mentioned in the English localization of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. The only thing known about the Dark Mage is that he sent Culex to Mario's universe to fight on his behalf, though it turns out that Mario's world is uninhabitable by his kind. The Dark Mage is a possible reference to the iconic Black Mage class that appears throughout the Final Fantasy series. He is unmentioned in the Japanese version.[5] In the remake, the Dark Mage is mentioned in Western languages, but is still unmentioned in Eastern languages. As Culex's characterization is closer to the Japanese version, it is also implied that the Dark Mage used evil magic to create or subjugate Culex in the first place.\n\nNames in other languages\n\nLanguage Name Meaning Dutch Zwarte Magiër\n\nBlack Mage\n\nFrench (NOA) Mage obscur\n\nDark mage\n\nFrench (NOE) mage obscur\n\ndark mage\n\nGerman Dunklen Magier\n\nDark Mage\n\nItalian Mago Oscuro\n\nDark Mage\n\nSpanish mago oscuro\n\ndark mage\n\nDestiny Del Vecchio[edit]\n\nDestiny Del Vecchio is a character mentioned in The Super Mario Bros. Movie with whom Mario and Luigi went to high school. When Mario sees a news broadcast about a flood in Brooklyn, he sees it as a chance to save Brooklyn, saying, \"Luigi, this is our chance! Destiny is calling!\" This prompts Luigi to say, \"Destiny Del Vecchio from high school?\", mistakenly believing Mario is referring to her.\n\nNames in other languages\n\nLanguage Name Meaning French (NOA) Destinée del Macchio\n\nDestiny del Macchio\n\nFrench (NOE) Allison Ledestin\n\nAllison Destiny; the surname sounds like le destin (\"the destiny\")\n\nItalian Fortuna Del Vecchio\n\nFortune/Lucky Del Vecchio; common surname, lit. \"of the Old [one]\"\n\nDiane Flossy[edit]\n\nDiane Flossy is the author of the book Mega Moles In The Mist that is seen in Flown the Koopa. While Mario and Luigi are in the Mega Moles' lair, they go through several books until finding one titled Mega Moles In The Mist by Diane Flossy. In the book, Diane Flossy says that they made a startling discovery about the Mega Moles, in which they bring people to their lair only to shower them with gifts and overfeed them with no way of escaping. Mario and Luigi quickly realize their fate before they find out what the Mega Moles do to their victims, leading to a Game Over. Diane Flossy is a parody of Dian Fossey, who was a gorilla researcher. The Mega Moles In The Mist book is also named after Gorillas in the Mist.\n\nDJ Toad[edit]\n\nDJ Toad is a character briefly mentioned in Paper Mario when looking behind the board in front of Merlon's house. He works for the FM Shroom.\n\nA character named DJ Toad appears in Paper Mario: The Origami King.\n\nDon Goombatti[edit]\n\nDon Goombatti is a talent scout for the Glitz Pit in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, and presumably a Goomba. He is mentioned in the \"RDM Final Issue!\" e-mail, which brings up his interest in signing Zess T. to the pit after she punches Flavio.\n\nNames in other languages\n\nLanguage Name Meaning Japanese ドン・クリゲ\n\nDon Kurige\n\n\"Don\" (Spanish honorific for \"sir\") + pun on「栗毛」(kurige, chestnut color) and「クリボー」(Kuribō, Goomba)\n\nDr. Claw[edit]\n\nDr. Claw is a character who appears as the main villain in the TV show Inspector Gadget. He is briefly mentioned in The Super Mario Bros.

Implied to be a classmate of Michael Hallis and Jonathan, Michael brings up that Eddie told him he saw Mario \"flying down the streets\" and that he can be summoned from a Game Boy, but Jonathan dismisses Eddie as an idiot.\n\nElmo Pershak[edit]\n\nElmo Pershak is a character mentioned by a Paratroopa in the Nintendo Comics System story \"The Kingdom Enquirer\". The Paratroopa asks Toad if he wants to hear his impersonation of Elmo Pershak, \"the world's greatest whistler\".\n\nEve's husband[edit]\n\n“I haven't been able to buy food for my children since my husband turned into a pig.”\n\n—Eve, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door\n\nEve's husband is mentioned by Eve in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. Eve married him sometime after Podley left her, and he is presumedly the father of her children. Prior to Mario arriving in Twilight Town, Eve's husband was turned into a pig by Doopliss. Unable to provide for his family, Eve and her children began to starve. Because of this, as well as Eve mentioning that she is a housewife during her trouble, it can be assumed that he is the breadwinner for the family, and his lack of a confirmed appearance could imply he is not home often. It can also be assumed he is changed back to normal alongside the other transformed villagers and is making money for his family again, allowing Eve to buy Meteor Meals. Interestingly, Eve never mentions being in love with her husband, and even states that she still loves Podley if Mario lies to her about what he said.\n\nFishkel and Seabert[edit]\n\nFishkel and Seabert are critics who are mentioned in the Nintendo Comics System story \"Fins and Roses\". When Wendy Koopa fires a rocket launcher at Stanley the Talking Fish after he shows her the concert band he arranged for her, another fish says that Wendy is the toughest critic since Fishkel and Seabert, a reference to Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert.\n\nFlight[edit]\n\nFlight is a friend of Lakilester (whom he calls by his nickname, \"Spike\") in the game Paper Mario. When Flight learns that Lakilester was helping Mario, he sends Lakilester a letter saying he will not forgive him unless he defeats Bowser, which Flight doubted would ever happen.\n\nNames in other languages\n\nLanguage Name Meaning Japanese フライト\n\nFuraito\n\nFlight\n\nFluffy[edit]\n\nFluffy was Wario's pet hamster who died in the year 1986, as explained in a Wario's Warehouse article.\n\n[edit]\n\nFootsteps of Meat is a character (possibly a Sammer Guy) mentioned by Tippi in Super Paper Mario. When using her Tattle on Footsteps of Coins, she reveals that he has a lesser-known brother called Footsteps of Meat. This may be a reference to Bowser's ability to collect meat in his intermissions of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door and how Footsteps of Coins puts coins in all levels, implying that Footsteps of Meat disperses the meat throughout Bowser’s levels.\n\nFour heroes[edit]\n\nThe four heroes were a quartet of unnamed characters who sealed away the Shadow Queen one thousand years prior to the events of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. They consisted of a strong male Toad from Petal Meadows; a wise female Goomba from Boggly Woods; a scar covered, world-traveling male Koopa; and a cold female Boo. They learned of the evil Shadow Queen and teamed up to defeat her. They managed to seal the demon, but just before the fight was completed, she cursed them. If they ever let go of the Crystal Stars, a black chest would appear and lock them away for all eternity.\n\nThe heroes knew the seal on the Shadow Queen was only temporary, and they wanted the stars available to one who might need them. They made a Magical Map to the stars, and to stop evil from using it, they put it in a box that could only be opened by the pure of heart. The merchant in the opening scene of the game has the box and gives it to Princess Peach.\n\nThe Toad was exhausted from his journey and collapsed in Petal Meadows. A healer saved him, but knowing his fate, the Toad gave them his Crystal Star and asked them to hide it where nobody would find it, in Hooktail Castle. The Goomba knew the Punies were being terrorized by the nearby monsters, so she hollowed out the Great Tree. She gave the Emerald Star to the Punies where they have been keeping it safe for the past thousand years. Her chest is in Rogueport Underground. The Koopa went to hide the Sapphire Star in Keelhaul Key, but Cortez came and easily took it for himself. The Koopa was so tired he did not stand a chance. His chest is in the Pirate's Grotto. The Boo hid the Ruby Star in Creepy Steeple, and her box is in a shop's storage room in Twilight Town.\n\nOne by one, Mario finds the chests and opens them with the Black Keys, releasing them and letting them \"curse\" Mario with new powers. While the others appear to be taunting Mario, the Koopa one at least did not appear evil, as he is rehearsing the speech. After they \"curse\" Mario, they vanish and are neither seen nor mentioned again. Mario can also pay Grifty to hear the story of their adventure and how they came to be trapped in the black chests.\n\nNames in other languages\n\nLanguage Name Meaning Japanese ゴロツキタウンの四千年英雄よんせんねんえいゆう\n\nGorotsukitaun no Yon Sennen Eiyū\n\nRogueport's Millenary Four Heroes\n\nItalian Quattro eroi\n\nFour heroes\n\nSpanish Los Cuatro Héroes Milenarios de Villa Viciosa\n\nRogueport's Millenary Four Heroes\n\nFronk's family[edit]\n\nFronk's family is mentioned on Fronk's Employee Showcase page on the WarioWare, Inc. Official Site.

When Mario is pursuing Iggy Koopa down the hallway inside Fort Koopa, he accidentally bumps into a statue of Genghis Koopa, causing it to fall over and shatter. A mouse then crawls out of the statue and scurries away. He is most likely a parody of notorious Mongol leader Genghis Khan.\n\nGlobox[edit]\n\nGlobox is Rayman's best friend and a major character in the Rayman franchise. He is mentioned by the Phantom in his song, \"Phantom Returns\", in the Rayman in the Phantom Show DLC for Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope, during which he derides Rayman by stating that his friendship with Globox is getting weaker.

Super Show! episode \"The Fire of Hercufleas\". After Mario and his friends had helped train the obese Hercufleas back into shape, Mario remarked that Hercufleas was even stronger than his Grandma Mia's garlic chip cookies. Grandma Mia, however, may even be another name for Grandma Mario, as Mama Mario is often referred to as \"Mama Mia\" by Mario and Luigi, and Mario once stated that his grandmother's full name is Grandmama Mia Mario.[6]\n\nGrandpapa[edit]\n\nGrandpapa is Mario and Luigi's grandfather, who was briefly mentioned by Mario at San Diego Comic-Con 2012, implying that his real name is actually Grandpapa Pio Mario before cutting himself short.[6]\n\nGrandpapa (film character)[edit]\n\nGrandpapa is Mario and Luigi's paternal grandfather, who was mentioned by Mario once in the Super Mario Bros. film.

In the episode \"The Curse of Kongo Bongo\", Cranky uses a book written by her to explain the curse of the double doubloon to Donkey and Diddy Kong. He is later seen calling her about the curse, and she tells him that the spell to stop the curse is in her book. After hanging up, even though he was mad and yelling at her over the phone, he breaks the fourth wall to say, \"Gotta love Great Aunt Grouchy.\" During the phone call, Cranky also states that he is her favorite nephew. Her name is synonymous with the word \"cranky.\"\n\nHamma Jamma's father[edit]\n\nHamma Jamma's father is mentioned twice in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. He is notable for being the only known Business Bro.\n\nLittle is known about Hamma Jamma's father, other than being one of Hamma Jamma's many family members that left to join the Glitz Pit. Unlike Hamma Jamma's beloved grandfather, references to him are very rare. Hamma Jamma's first mention of him states that he dropped out of Hammer Bros. school, choosing to enroll in Business Bros. school. This act seemed to have embarrassed and confused his son. The last mention of him, however, seems to suggest that Hamma Jamma may still love his father: When referring to his dad this time, Hamma says that he is actually attending his fight that day (which could mean that he appeared in the audience during one of Mario's fights), and he wishes to win and impress him.\n\nHamma Jamma's grandfather[edit]\n\nHamma Jamma's grandfather is a Hammer Bro of unknown name, brought up by his grandson several times in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. He actually first appears as an unknown Hammer Bro in Super Mario Bros.\n\nHamma Jamma, a fighter in the Glitz Pit and member of the Hamma, Bamma, and Flare team, continually cites his grandfather as his inspiration. Apparently, his grandfather once owned his beloved hammer and is one of Hamma's several family members he left behind to pursue a career in fighting.\n\nHamma Jamma stated that World 7-1 from Super Mario Bros. is his grandfather's \"'hood\" (\"stomping grounds\" in the remake).\n\nHanderson[edit]\n\nHanderson is the speaker in the EJIA phone call in WarioWare Gold. A self-described \"hand model\" and \"finger actor\", Handerson heavily implies to be the character that the hand seen in the microgames Butterfingers and Right in the Eye pertains to. Handerson claims the most difficult role they landed was catching a hot toast out of a toaster \"15 years ago\", referencing the Butterfingers microgame in WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$!, released 15 years before WarioWare Gold. In WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$!, he was referred to as Baby Handerson.\n\nHeroes of Buffness[edit]\n\nSee also: Mount Pajamaja § Heroes of Buffness\n\nThe Heroes of Buffness, also referred to as Muscle Lords, are powerful fighters mentioned in Mario & Luigi: Dream Team. Throughout Mount Pajamaja, various monuments can be found dedicated to the Heroes of Buffness with stone slabs giving a description about their history. Additionally, the Massif Bros. mistake the Mega Pi'illos for Muscle Lords.\n\nHeronicus' Flopside Counterpart[edit]\n\nHeronicus' Flopside Counterpart is mentioned by a few characters in Super Paper Mario (mainly Hatch). He is a brave explorer who went hunting for a legendary Pixl but his partner's game ended while Heronicus' Flopside counterpart saved the Pixl, so he continued exploring solo. The Pixl he rescued turned out to be Piccolo who was found in his house. Heronicus contrasts from what his counterpart did and rescued his partner while his legendary Pixl presumably died. Because of this, he and his partner retired out of depression. Flamm sells Maps left behind by Heronicus' Flopside Counterpart. His name is not mentioned at any point of the game nor is he even seen.\n\nHizza[edit]\n\nHizza is a giant, two-headed snake that Luigi fights during his adventure to assemble the Marvelous Compass and rescue Princess Eclair. In Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, the people of Plumpbelly Village are forced to sacrifice young maidens to the monstrous snake Hizza. Eventually, the mayor's daughter is the next to be sacrificed. As such, Luigi puts on the young woman's dress and travels (with his new partner Jerry) to Hizza's lair. During the epic battle that follows, Luigi manages to trick Hizza's two heads into eating each other, thus destroying the creature for all eternity as well as gaining a piece of the Marvelous Compass. As a result, the citizens of Plumpbelly Village no longer have to live in fear.\n\nNames in other languages\n\nLanguage Name Meaning Japanese ジャイーダ[4]\n\nJaīda\n\nAnagram of「大蛇だいじゃ」(daija, \"big snake\")\n\nChinese (simplified) 贾岱\n\nJiǎdài\n\nTransliteration of the Japanese name\n\nChinese (traditional) 賈岱\n\nJiǎdài\n\nTransliteration of the Japanese name\n\nDutch Serpia\n\nFrom \"serpent\"\n\nFrench Démemba\n\nGerman Gigantula\n\nItalian Jaida\n\nFrom the Japanese name\n\nKorean 제이더\n\nJeideo\n\nFrom the Japanese name\n\nSpanish Verdemor\n\nPun on verde (\"green\") and \"Voldemort\"\n\nJabbula[edit]\n\nJabbula is an implied Jabbi mentioned by Goombella in the game Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, when tattling a certain Jabbi in the Great Tree.[7]\n\nNames in other languages\n\nLanguage Name Meaning Japanese トゲーラ\n\nTogēra\n\nFrom「トゲ族」(Toge-zoku, \"Jabbi\") and feminine name ending「ら」(-ra)\n\nJabbubbity[edit]\n\nJabbubbity is another implied Jabbi mentioned by Goombella in the same tattle as above.[7]\n\nNames in other languages\n\nLanguage Name Meaning Japanese トゲゴロウ\n\nTogegorō\n\nFrom「トゲ族」(Toge-zoku, \"Jabbi\") and given name「五郎」(Gorō)\n\nJames[edit]\n\nJames is reportedly the greatest thief who ever lived, according to the enemy glossary of Wario: Master of Disguise.

In response, Toad uttered, \"Who'd you expect? Pee-wee Herman?\"\n\nPixl Queen[edit]\n\nThe Pixl Queen is an unseen Pixl spoken of in Super Paper Mario. This rebellious Pixl is only talked about in four of Carson's stories, though quite a bit is revealed about her in these.\n\nDespite the Pixl Queen being the first Pixl ever created, she seemed to stay largely quiet for what is thought to be 1,000 years after the creation of the Pixls 3,000 years before the setting of Super Paper Mario. However, seemingly long after the passing of her creator (the powerful magician who invented the process of Pixl-making), the Pixl Queen (then of an unknown name) finally rose into power, renaming herself with her only known name of \"Pixl Queen.\" She then began to use her powers of mind control to manipulate all Pixls, causing them to eventually enslave most of the Tribe of Ancients (who were ironically once their masters) in her name. However, the owners of the magician's twelve original Pixl creations managed to somehow escape this Pixl Uprising and started to fight against the rebellious Pixls, containing them within Catch Cards and healing them. In the end, only one of these heroic Ancients survived, and he traveled with only his Pixl friends to the Pixl Queen's castle.\n\nOnce he arrived at the stronghold, he confronted the dark Pixl Queen herself, who immediately hid from the hero and shot a barrage of disturbing images to his mind telepathically. Although this greatly weakened the Ancient hero, one of his Pixls helped him through the tragedy and ended up defeating the Pixl Queen itself, although it was destroyed in the process of doing so. Afterwards, it was shockingly revealed to the hero who owned the Pixl that the Pixl Queen was the first created of the Pixls (perhaps created even earlier than the magician's so-called \"original\" twelve Pixls) and that the magician's motives for creating her involved the study of the Dark Prognosticus. The Ancient survivor, attempting to stop such a tragedy as the Pixl Uprising from ever happening again, then took the Dark Prognosticus with himself to unknown parts, likely founding the Tribe of Darkness known to once have possessed the dark book. Afterwards, the Pixl Queen's mutinous efforts led to the fall of the Tribe of Ancients and the outlawing of Pixl creation.\n\nThough these are the only known actions of the seemingly late Pixl Queen, more is indeed known about the Pixl herself. Although the spirit united with the Pixl vessel that formed the Pixl Queen had previously been described as \"demonic\", Carson later stated that a certain one of the magician's apprentices' books revealed that the Pixl Queen's spirit was actually derived from a human rather than a demon. It was on this principle that Carson theorized that the Pixl Queen's spirit may have been that of the magician's own daughter (who did indeed get a Game Over during her father's life due to a deathly illness), although he later seemed to have not been sure about this theory in his statement that the author disavowed it. It is also unknown if the Pixl Queen had any helpful ability, although she was indeed able to control all Pixls and used the power of telepathy in her battle against the Ancient survivor, making these possible ability candidates.\n\nNames in other languages\n\nLanguage Name Meaning Japanese クィーンフェアリン\n\nKwīn Fearin\n\nQueen Pixl\n\nFrench Reine des Pixels\n\nQueen of Pixls\n\nGerman Pixl-Königin\n\nPixl Queen\n\nItalian Regina dei Pixl\n\nQueen of Pixls\n\nKorean 페어린 퀸\n\nPeeorin Kwin\n\nPixl Queen\n\nSpanish Reina Pixel\n\nPixl Queen\n\nPoopa La Koopa[edit]\n\n“Like my grandfather Poopa La Koopa always said, 'Cheat, beat, and be merry!'”\n\n—King Koopa, \"Butch Mario & The Luigi Kid\"\n\nPoopa La Koopa is the grandfather of King Koopa who was briefly mentioned by him in The Super Mario Bros.

Queen Croacus the Second eventually took the throne in his place after the fall of Croacus I. Prince Croacus dying in 444 is an example of a common Japanese (and Chinese) association of the number four with death, as the characters for \"four\" (四) and \"death\" (死) have similar readings (shi, in Japanese).\n\nPrincess Daisy's father[edit]\n\nPrincess Daisy mentions her father in Mario Party 3, stating she has never lost to him. However, not much else is known about him. She also mentions him in Fortune Street, as she asks \"Can my daddy put a little extra gold in my bank account?\"\n\nDaisy's father also makes a brief appearance in the first volume of KC Deluxe's manga, where he beats Mario for taking fun at Tatanga's height, fearing for the alien's technology, immediately bowing to him.\n\nPrincess Eclair[edit]\n\nPrincess Eclair was the damsel-in-distress that Luigi rescued from the clutches of the monstrous Chestnut King in the Waffle Kingdom. However, as it turns out, the Chestnut King was actually Princess Eclair's lover, who had been turned into a monster by the sinister Minister Crepe. This story is told by Luigi when Mario talks to him throughout the events of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door.\n\nDuring Luigi's adventure, he fell in love with Princess Eclair. However, after he discovered that the Chestnut King was Princess Eclair's fiancée, Luigi lost the hope of ever forming a romantic relationship with the princess. Since Luigi embellished his stories so much, it is unknown whether any of it really happened as he described (or whether she even exists at all).\n\nShe is also mentioned in Luigi's five-book series, called Super Luigi, which is sold in Rogueport's shop during the events of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door.\n\nNames in other languages\n\nLanguage Name Meaning Japanese エクレア姫\n\nEkurea-hime\n\nPrincess Eclair\n\nChinese 意可蕾公主\n\nYìkělěi Gōngzhǔ\n\nPrincess Eclair\n\nDutch Prinses Anijs\n\nPrincess Anise; anise is often used to flavor dishes, drinks and candy\n\nFrench Princesse Ganache\n\n\"Ganache\" is the name of a chocolate-flavored dessert\n\nGerman Prinzessin Eclaire\n\nPrincess Eclair\n\nItalian Principessa Crema\n\nPrincess Cream\n\nKorean 에클레르공주\n\nEkeulleleu Gongju\n\nPrincess Eclair\n\nSpanish (NOA) Princesa Petisú\n\nPrincess Petisu\n\nSpanish (NOE) Princesa Letucia\n\nProbably a reference to Queen Letizia of Spain\n\nPrincess Toadstool's mother[edit]\n\nPrincess Toadstool's mother was referenced by the princess in one issue of the Nintendo Comics System.

In the story, Rosalina recounts a dream she had about her mother, in which she tells her daughter that she will always watch over her as a star.

In \"The Painting\", Howard Stevens explains that, whenever da Vinci Mahoney paints a forgery, he always paints Roy into them, which is an easy way to identify his paintings.\n\nSashimie[edit]\n\nSashimie is a Cheep Cheep in Paper Mario who appears in name only through a letter she sends to Sushie, her mother. Just as Sushie's name is derived from sushi, Sashimie's name is derived from another Japanese dish, sashimi.

This single reference is made when selecting the \"Toxic Toad Z Figure.\" option at Junk during Lantern Ghost's Nerd Force V mission. When this option is selected, Paratroopa will proclaim the character a \"hard-core fan\" of Toad Force V and begin spilling out information regarding Toxic Toad Z; as he does this, he mentions the Spore King (who happens to own the robotic Toxic Toad Z) a few times.

Toce T., worried that Hooktail will eat her children, tells Mario that she does not let them wander far from home. Despite Toce T. referring to her kids in the plural, there is only one Toad kid seen in Petalburg; it is unknown if he is one of her children.\n\nToxic Toad Z[edit]\n\nToxic Toad Z is one of the handful of known characters from Toad Force V mentioned in Mario Party Advance. Toxic Toad Z is a Toad-based robotic villain in the series, and the henchman of Toad Force V's arch-nemesis, the Spore King.\n\nWhen Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, or Yoshi accept Lantern Ghost's Nerd Force V challenge, they are directed to go to Junk, Paratroopa's item shop. On this specific mission, Junk is up and running with two items: A \"Toad Force V\" figurine (actually one of Jack) and a figure of Toxic Toad Z. While selecting the Toad Force V figurine is the correct action for this mission, it does not hurt to select the one of Toxic Toad Z; such an action will result in Paratroopa revealing much about the Toxic Toad Z character.\n\nParatroopa seems to know quite a bit about him, though, and, for an unseen character, there actually is a notably large amount of known information about him. According to him, Toxic Toad Z fights with lasers and giant missiles, and his design was stolen (by the Spore King) from the Toad lab. Also, it apparently takes a \"hard-core fan\" to buy a figurine of Toxic Toad Z, presumably because he is a villainous (and possibly minor) henchman; despite this statement, Junk was all out of his figures at the time the player attempted to buy one, although they were apparently expecting a new shipment of them to arrive soon. Indeed, the game's ending sequence states that Paratroopa made a fortune by selling Toxic Toad Z figures, indicating that the shipment did eventually arrive sometime during the course of Mario Party Advance.\n\nNames in other languages\n\nLanguage Name Meaning Japanese ドクキノコンZ[12]\n\nDokukinokon Z\n\nFrom「ドクキノコ」(doku kinoko, \"Poison Mushroom\")\n\nItalian Toxic Toad Z\n\n-\n\nTutanbwaaahmon[edit]\n\nTutanbwaaahmon is an ancient Rabbid figure in Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. A parody of Tutankhamun, he is represented as a large statue in Sherbet Desert, donning stereotypical pharaoh garments such as a nemes, a false beard and a shendyt. His tomb is decorated with sarcophagi that depict his visage.\n\nUncle Harry[edit]\n\nUncle Harry is one of Mario and Luigi's uncles. In the 1991 Nintendo Adventure Book Koopa Capers, Luigi dreams of spaghetti, orange juice and ice cream being served on a raft in his Uncle Harry's pool.\n\nUncle Pete[edit]\n\nUncle Pete is the uncle of a Goomba living in Toad Town in Paper Mario: The Origami King, who mentions him after he says Mario is the strongest paper he has ever seen, with the exception of his uncle Pete, who is cardboard.\n\nUncle Troy[edit]\n\nUncle Troy is an uncle of Marilyn's, who lives somewhere in California. After she and her friends partied at Mario Brothers Plumbing in \"Wild Thing\", she announced that they would be moving the party to a beach in California and that they would be staying with her Uncle Troy.\n\nVan Helsing[edit]\n\nVan Helsing is a fictitious vampire hunter from the novel Dracula. In the Club Nintendo comic Super Mario in Die Nacht des Grauens, Kirby stumbles across a chest with Van Helsing's name engraved, which turns out to be his legacy, containing lots of magical weapons and clothing. Kirby, Mario, and Link use these weapons to defeat Abigor and his demonic fellows.\n\nVictoria[edit]\n\nVictoria is a female Boo in Paper Mario. She is the target of the affections of many Boos in Gusty Gulch. One of the Boos wants to marry her, and asks Mario (after Mario approaches him) whether he should give her a Fire Flower or a Volt Shroom as a present. Whatever Mario's answer is, the Boo eventually wins Victoria's love, and they plan to get married when Lady Bow comes back.\n\nWaluigi's pet hamster[edit]\n\nAccording to the Wario's Warehouse article for the Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers video game, Waluigi has a pet hamster. Inspired by the airholes on his hamster's cage, Waluigi makes holes in the warehouse's roof to avoid \"having to gasp for air like a mad fish\".\n\nWario's mother[edit]\n\nWario's mother makes a brief appearance in a 4-koma from Super Mario-kun volume 10, set during Wario's childhood. Alongside her husband, she scolds her son for returning from the playground full of bruises and scratches and punishes him by tying him up to a pillar of their house. When Wario's parents decide to go outside to eat, Wario overhears them and follows them asking if he can come along, still tied to the pillar, destroying the house and angering his parents more. In these panels, only the father's arm and the mother's legs are shown.\n\nWario's mother is briefly mentioned during the events of Mario Power Tennis. During the blooper reel of Wario lifting weights, she calls him on his cell phone. He then replies \"Hello? Ma, I told you not to call me today! I'm making a movie...\" as Waluigi tells the crew to cut.\n\nWario's mother is also heard of in Wario's Warehouse on the website for Nintendo of Europe. It is revealed she used to say \"You can never have enough cash.\" Wario later wedged her inside her kitchen bin and pilfered all her money.\n\nWario's Warehouse also states that Wario's mother perceives her son as so goofy that she never threw him a birthday party. Consequently, Wario does not know his age.[citation needed]\n\nWatchoverer[edit]\n\nThe Watchoverer is a deity revered by the Nommons of Pi'illo Island in Mario & Luigi: Dream Team. When Starlow assumed the Nommons revered the petrified Pi'illos as deities, they corrected her by stating that they actually revere the Watchoverer and that the petrified Pi'illos are just their playthings. It is heavily implied that the Watchoverer is actually the Zeekeeper.\n\nWatt's mother[edit]\n\nWatt's mother is mentioned multiple times in Paper Mario. Watt often tells Mario about her. Additionally, she sends Watt a letter, which the player can read when visiting the Toad Town Post Office. Her name is unknown. However, Watt's Pause Menu Screen description reads: \"The child of Li'l Sparky\", which might mean Watt's mother's name is Li'l Sparky. However, this may only refer to her species rather than her name."
