        "text": "[edit] Original\n\nKOF '98 was originally released for arcades on July 23, 1998.[1] It was ported to the Neo Geo AES on September 23, 1998, the Neo Geo CD on December 23, 1998 and the PlayStation on March 25, 1999. The PlayStation version was published in North America and the PAL region by Agetec, becoming the first PlayStation installment in the series to be released outside Japan since The King of Fighters '95. A Dreamcast version was also released on June 24, 1999 under the changed title The King of Fighters: Dream Match 1999, reflecting the year the version was released.[11] This game was released in North America on September 30, 1999.[12] The game is also included in The King of Fighters Collection: Orochi Saga compilation released in North America and the PAL region for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Wii (the game was not included in the Japanese Orochi Hen compilation).[13]\n\n[edit] Ultimate Match\n\nKOF '98 was later remade under the title of The King of Fighters '98: Ultimate Match in 2008, ten years after the original game’s release. It was released in Japan as an arcade game for the Taito Type X hardware on March 2008, with the PlayStation 2 port released on June 26 of the same year. It was also published on the “NeoGeo Online Collection The Best” on June 18, 2008. The game was released in North America by Ignition Entertainment on March 3, 2009.[14] In the European Union it was released on June 10, 2009.[15]\n\nUltimate Match includes additional characters not featured in the original version of the game, such as Eiji Kisaragi from KOF '95, along with Kasumi Todoh and the Boss Team (composed of Geese Howard, Wolfgang Krauser, and Mr. Big) from KOF '96, as well as the boss characters Goenitz and Orochi, essentially including all the characters featured in the KOF series prior to KOF '98. EX versions of certain characters not featured in the original version were added including King with her Art of Fighting 2 moveset, Ryuji Yamazaki and Blue Mary with their Real Bout Fatal Fury 2: The Newcomers movesets. The Orochi versions from Leona and Iori Yagami are also playable, and both also appear as mid-bosses in the arcade mode. New stages were added to game such as China and Hong Kong to show appreciation for KOF’s high popularity in such regions.[16]\n\nA third fighting style is also introduced in addition to Advance and Extra, dubbed “Ultimate” mode. Ultimate mode is a customizable style that allows the player to choose between features from Advance or Extra mode, such as which kind of power gauge to use. It also includes a ‘Neo Geo’ mode, which is a direct port of the original Neo Geo console version."
