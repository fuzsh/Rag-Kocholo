If you’ve been enjoying the recent Neogeo revival on Xbox One, then adding another title to your collection won’t do any harm. Will it?\n\nAvailable to download right now for £6.39, ACA NEOGEO The King of Fighters ’95 was originally released in, yep, you guessed it, 1995. Taking everything SNK found great about KOF ’94, surely the ’95 version will fare a little better? With various difficulty settings in place, it promised to reproduce the joy found in the arcades of the time.\n\nNow you can compete against friends from around the world, with a high score leaderboard in place too.\n\nThe thing is, with a huge influx of Neogeo titles over the last few weeks, some which turned out great – think KOF ’94 actually – whilst others arrived to slightly less acclaim – yep, we’re looking at you Sengoku – is the 95 version of The King of Fighters worth the cash? You’ll only find that out by hitting up the Xbox Games Store and getting your download in.\n\nGame Description:\n\n“THE KING OF FIGHTERS ’95” is a fighting game released by SNK in 1995. In addition to the character of popular work such as “FATAL FURY” and “ART OF FIGHTING” in the sequel title of the previous work “KOF ’94”, Yagamian will participate as the rival of the main character Kyo Kusanagi. With the team edit function installed, it became possible to form a team with the player ‘s favorite character. The “ACA NEOGEO” series has faithfully reproduced many classic NEOGEO masterpieces. Players can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores. Please enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games."
