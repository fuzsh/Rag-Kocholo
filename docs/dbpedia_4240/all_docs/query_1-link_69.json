        "text": "King of Fighters All-Star is a beat’em up mobile game that shares in-game mechanics similar to a role-playing game. There are fighter cards for each character in the game; therefore, each fighter comes in multiple incarnations. If we were to rank every single fighter of the game in our King of Fighters all-star tier list, this list would have included nearly 150-plus entries. Such a lengthy tier list would surely cover all the fighters, but it will lose its essence in the process.\n\nHere’s a summary of King of Fighters All Star Tier List Rankings:\n\nKing of Fighters All-Star Tier List Ranking Table Tiers Fighters S-Tier Jin Hoodie, Kazuya, Terry 03, Mukai 03, Orochi 97, Xmas Elisabeth, Geese XIV, Omega Rugal 98, and Nameless 02 A-Tier Orochi Zero 01, Igniz 01, Krizalid 99, Orochi Leona 97, Orochi Shermie 97, Lady Chang, Haohmaru, Paul, Jin Classic, Ash Crimson 03, Nests Kyo XIII, Sentai Clark, Ling, and Orochi Iori 97 B-Tier Orochi Yashiro 97, Orochi Chris, Mai 95, Kyo Kusanagi 95, King 94, Yuri in Wonderland, False Advent Orochi, Ling School Girl, Zero Clone 00, K’99, and Whip 99 C-Tier Kensou 99, Brian 98, Shermie 97, Mature 96, Ryo 95, Ramon 00, Andy 98, Swimsuit Kula, Armor King, and Sentai Ralf D-Tier Halloween Yashiro, Heavy D 94, Takuma 98, Chizuru 96, Heidern 94, and Maxima 99\n\nMoving on, let’s have a look at the statistical comparison between these Fighters:\n\nFightersTierAttributeRarityTypeHPOffensive PowerDefensive Power Orochi 97SPurpleFestivalBalanced99507.06367.03716.0 Mukai 03SBlue FestivalOffense71011.08144.01383.0 Terry 03SYellowFestivalBalanced87675.06565.05205.0 KazuyaSYellow5 StarBalanced87870.05930.03132.0 Jin HoodieSBlue 5 StarDefensive90785.05204.07030.0 Nameless 02SPurpleFestivalDefense88383.05275.08071.0 Omega Rugal 98SRedFestivalOffense52958.08023.01339.0 Geese XIVSRedFestivalOffense70114.08447.01370.0 Xmas ElisabethSGreenFestivalDefense91902.05535.07456.0 Orochi Shermie 97AGreenFestivalOffense72721.08180.01366.0 Orochi Leona 97ABlueFestivalBalanced93807.06315.03547.0 Krizalid 99ARedFestivalBalanced93751.06232.04768.0 Igniz 01APurpleFestivalOffense72986.08829.01434.0 Orochi Zero 01ABlue FestivalOffense78302.08043.01399.0 Ash Crimson 03AGreenFestivalDefense88146.05695.07705.0 Jin ClassicAGreen5 StarBalanced89663.05712.0285.0 PaulAGreen5 StarOffense67610.07807.01003.0 HaohmaruARed5 StarOffense--- Lady ChangAYellowFestivalDefense88963.05445.06142.0 Orochi Iori 97AYellowFestivalOffense73125.08147.01366.0 LingAYellow5 StarOffense67548.07612.01003.0 Sentai ClarkABlue 5 StarOffense--- Nests Kyo XIIIARedFestivalBalanced82096.06091.05184.0 King 94BRed5 StarBalanced75330.05593.04223.0 Kyo Kusanagi 95BBlue 5 StarOffense96858.09422.01927.0 Mai 95BRed5 StarOffense65912.07052.0899.0 Orochi ChrisBYellowFestivalBalanced84025.05979.05124.0 Orochi Yashiro 97BBlue FestivalDefense101818.05124.07497.0 K’99BRed5 StarOffense93376.09383.01743.0 Zero Clone 00BRedFestivalDefense98538.05498.07325.0 Ling School GirlBPurple5 StarDefense93769.04104.07355.0 False Advent OrochiBGreen5 StarBalanced81379.06451.03813.0 Yuri in WonderlandBBlue 5 StarDefense86115.05738.07344.0 Whip 99BBlue 5 StarDefense--- Ryo 95CRed5 StarDefense93359.04519.05311.0 Mature 96CGreen5 StarDefense108174.06164.07807.0 Shermie 97CPurple5 StarDefense--- Brian 98CYellow5 StarDefense--- Kensou 99CGreen5 StarOffense--- Armor KingCRed5 StarDefense93923.04104.07355.0 Sentai RalfCRed5 StarDefense--- Swimsuit KulaCBlue 5 StarOffense--- Andy 98CGreen5 StarDefense93285.04925.07366.0 Ramon 00CYellow5 StarBalanced88584.06191.03749.0 Heidern 94DBlue 5 StarBalanced77751.04616.04134.0 Chizuru 96DYellow5 StarDefense121137.05801.07238.0 Takuma 98DYellow5 StarOffense--- Heavy D 94DYellow3 StarOffense43041.05560.0677.0 Halloween YashiroDGreen5 StarDefense82693.03892.07226.0 Maxima 99DYellow5 StarOffense105080.08815.01717.0\n\nKing Of Fighters All Star Tier List\n\nAs mentioned above, we have narrowed down our radar for the sake of our tier list and found these top 50 players.

Haohmaru As a red affinity attack type fighter, Haohmaru boosts all fighters’ attacks and inflicts status effects, offering strategic advantages and devastating power in battles.

King 94 A great fighter and support character with kick attacks dealing significant damage, with an S3 that offers stun for setting up combos. Kyo Kusanagi 95 Provides a 50% bonus attack for blue element fighters in the team, excelling in Time Attack with explosive animations and raw damage output. Mai 95 Considered one of the best offensive characters in the B-tier list, offering a 25% attack per HP boost on many attack types and capable of executing infinite combos with precise timing. Orochi Chris 97 Recently overhauled skillsets make him a solid pick for PvE and PvP encounters, dealing burn damage and balanced stats, although lacking extraordinary team utility. Orochi Yashiro 97 Possesses above-average defense and health regeneration but lacks brute force as an attacker, with the need to sacrifice defense for increased attack power, which can be inefficient. K’99 Grants leader skill to other red affinity players, suitable for Time Attack but prone to missing combos in PvE and PvP due to bugs. Zero Clone 00 With low attack damage attributes, he’s mainly suitable for defense and lacks damage-dealing attacks, although providing health recovery below 30% HP and serving as a support player in PvP encounters. Ling School Girl Offers advantages in PvP and PvE fights with various active and passive abilities, but still placed in B-tier due to modest attack damage stats. False Advent Orochi Despite dealing significant damage, repetitive attack patterns and lack of variety hold him back, with petrify as a passive skillset being a notable feature. Yuri in Wonderland Grants a 60% bonus attack damage to defense-type teammates at the cost of her own HP, with freezing enemies and boosting stats for a limited time, although her S3 and striker skills offer little in fights. Whip 99 Provides a 60% extra attack damage buff to other defense-type fighters, offering great team synergy but reducing her own defense points, making her a valuable addition for defensive team compositions.\n\nC-Tier List\n\nName WHY RANKED IN C TIER? Ryo 95 As a defense/support character, Ryo 95 offers HP buffs to red elemental teammates and effective close combat skills, making him a valuable asset for defense-oriented strategies. Mature 96 Mature 96 enhances overall team performance with attack and HP buffs, while her slashing attacks deliver consistent damage in battles, providing both support and offensive capabilities. Shermie 97 With the ability to boost attack power under certain conditions and high-damage skills, Shermie 97 is a solid choice for offense-focused strategies, despite the HP condition for her buff. Brian 98 Brian 98 supports yellow elemental teammates with attack and HP buffs and delivers powerful attacks, including a leaping strike with super armor, making him versatile in various situations. Kensou 99 Kensou 99 provides attack bonuses and defense tactics against yellow elemental enemies, offering versatility and resilience in battles with his high-damage leaping punch and spinning kick. Armor King While lacking offensive prowess, Armor King supports Tekken fighters with power charge rate and attack bonuses, and his super armor skills provide crucial defense in challenging encounters. Sentai Ralf Teaming up well with Clark, Sentai Ralf offers attack and HP bonuses and consistent damage output, making him a reliable choice for defense-oriented strategies in King of Fighters all-star. Swimsuit Kula Despite lacking unique features, Swimsuit Kula’s freeze status effect and attack bonuses for blue elemental fighters offer some utility in battles, making her a decent choice for strategic teams. Andy 98 Andy 98 enhances green elemental team performance with attack and bleed damage buffs, although he lacks offensive skills, his bleed effects and debuffs add strategic depth to battles. Ramon 00 Specializing in grab attacks and offering critical hit rate and damage bonuses, Ramon 00 provides consistent damage output and utility in battles, making him a versatile choice for various teams.\n\nD-Tier List\n\nName WHY RANKED IN D TIER? Heidern 94 Despite being from an early game, Heidern’s high skill cooldown and weak striker skill make him less effective in battles compared to other fighters, limiting his utility and impact on the team. Chizuru 96 Chizuru’s flawed striker skill, which reduces the team’s damage output, significantly hinders her effectiveness in both PvE and PvP encounters, outweighing any potential benefits she may offer as a defense fighter. Takuma 98 Takuma’s limited leadership and striker skills, which benefit only specific character types, diminish his overall effectiveness in battles, making him less appealing compared to other fighters with broader utility. Heavy D 94 Despite offering critical rate bonuses to all fighters, Heavy D 94’s underwhelming skills and lack of impactful abilities relegate him to a lower tier, limiting his viability in both PvE and PvP scenarios. Halloween Yashiro Halloween Yashiro’s reliance on Takuma 98 and short stun duration on his skills detract from his effectiveness in battles, placing him below other fighters with more versatile and impactful abilities. Maxima 99 Maxima’s lackluster attack types, absence of buffs for teammates, and high skill cooldowns diminish his overall utility and effectiveness in battles, relegating him to a lower tier compared to other fighters.\n\nWhich one is the best fighter in the game?\n\nThere is no single fighter in our King of Fighters all-star tier list who ticks all boxes. Each fighter is unique and distinctive and plays differently in each mode. In any case, here is our take on the best fighters for the following modes.\n\nFor PvP: Orochi 97\n\nFor PvE: Jin Classic\n\nTime Attack: Orochi Iori 97\n\nEpic Quest: Orochi Zero 01\n\nThis was eXputer KOF Tier List Guide, for more Tier Lists; head down below."
