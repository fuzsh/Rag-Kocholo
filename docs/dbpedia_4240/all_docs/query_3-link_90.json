        "text": "Description :\n\nStart the incredible and cool Orochi Saga off with a bang as you enter a new King of Fighters tournament after receiving an invite signed only with an \"R\". Saisyu Kusanagi, Kyo's father appears as a fighter in this tournament but it is quickly obvious that he's been brainwashed into fighting by the evil Rugal Bernstein! Select your fighters and then jump into the arena to fight off many opponents of all shapes and sizes. Learn the moves and inflict terrible damage with minimal effort!\n\nIf you're into the KOF series in a big way then need simply to slide over and take on the might of other cool titles, such as The King of Fighters 2000, The King of Fighters 2001 and the badass The King of Fighters 2002!\n\nTags :\n\nAdditional Information"
