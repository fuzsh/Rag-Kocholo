        "text": "Marie Prevost Bio\n\nMarie Prevost was a Canadian-born actress who rose to fame in the silent film era of Hollywood. She was born on November 8, 1896, in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada. Her family moved to California when she was a child, and she began her acting career at the age of 16. She went on to appear in over 120 films and was considered one of Hollywood's most beloved stars during the 1920s. Prevost started working in Hollywood as a small-time actress in 1915, but her big break came in 1918 when she was cast in the film \"The Midnight Patrol.\" From there, she quickly rose to prominence and became a leading lady in numerous films throughout the 1920s. Some of her most notable films during this time include \"The Marriage Circle,\" \"Mantrap,\" and \"Three Faces East.\" Prevost was known for her comedic timing and charismatic personality, which made her a fan favorite. She often played the role of the \"flapper girl\" in her films, a type of young woman who rebelled against traditional values and embraced a more modern lifestyle. However, she also starred in dramatic roles that showcased her versatility as an actress. Despite her success, Prevost's personal life was tumultuous. She struggled with alcoholism and depression, which led to a decline in her career . She died at the age of 38 in 1937, and her tragic death shocked Hollywood and her fans alike. However, she will always be remembered as one of Hollywood's most talented and beloved actresses of the silent film era.\n\nWhat 16 personality type is Marie Prevost?\n\nMarie Prevost from Canada could potentially be an ESFP personality type. This type is known for being outgoing, energetic, and spontaneous, which aligns with Prevost's reputation as a vivacious and charismatic actress. ESFPs are also often described as natural performers, loving attention and praise, which could explain Prevost's desire to be in the spotlight. Similarly, ESFPs are often social butterflies, thriving on interacting with others and being the life of the party. Prevost was reported to have been popular among her peers and frequently attended social events, which fits with this personality type. Additionally, ESFPs tend to be disinterested in abstract or theoretical pursuits, instead preferring hands-on, practical activities. Prevost's background as a dancer and her success in physical comedy could suggest that she was more interested in the practical aspects of her craft than in exploring the deeper meanings behind her work. Overall, while it is impossible to definitively type a historical figure, Marie Prevost's public persona and career suggest that she may have been an ESFP personality type.\n\nWhich Enneagram Type is Marie Prevost?\n\nMarie Prevost is an Enneagram Two personality type with a Three wing or 2w3. 2w3s are glamorous and confidently competitive in nature. They are always on top of their game and know how to live life in style. 2w2s' personality traits might be seen as extroverted or introverted - it all depends on how others perceive them as they are much capable of both socializing and introspecting."
