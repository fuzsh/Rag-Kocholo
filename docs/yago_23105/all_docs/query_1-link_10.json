She knew well the silent screen technique as a result of her Mack Sennett experience.”\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nShe has 120 film credits on her imdb database, beginning with the 1915 short His Father’s Footsteps. Her hits included The Marriage Circle (1924), Up in Mabel’s Room (1926) and Getting Gertie’s Garter (1927).\n\nBut she was a silent screen star. When the talkies came in, and she started to age, the good roles grew scarce. And on Jan. 25, 1937, Vancouverites opened their papers to the startling news that Marie Prevost was dead at 38.\n\n“Death in a small Hollywood apartment ended Marie Prevost’s futile fight to retrieve her faded screen glory,” said an Associated Press story in the Province. “Dr. Frank N. Webb, assistant county autopsy surgeon, said a post-mortem examination indicated acute alcoholism as the cause of death.”\n\nThe Los Angeles Times ran the story on the front page of its Sunday edition. And it was tragic.\n\n“Apparently dead two days, her body was found clothed and face down on a folding bed. Whining at the bedside was her pet dachshund, Maxie, and teeth marks on the actress’s body indicated the animal had tugged at his mistress in an attempt to arouse her.”\n\nAs time passed, her sad and lonely death was all but forgotten. But it was resurrected in 1959, when Kenneth Anger released his infamous book Hollywood Babylon.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAnger dished out Hollywood’s most sordid scandals in a nasty tabloid style, and Marie was one of his subjects.\n\n“Her romantic looks didn’t fit her Bronx honk, and blonde Marie tried to drown her heartbreak in bourbon,” Anger wrote.\n\n“Marie dragged on until 1937, when her half-eaten corpse was discovered in her seedy apartment on Calhuenga Boulevard. Her dachshund had survived by making mincemeat of his mistress.”\n\nHis comments were related over top of a grisly photo of the dead movie star lying face down in her bed. The cutline for the photo was two words: “Doggie’s dinner.”\n\nThis piqued the interest of British new wave music legend Nick Lowe, who was inspired to write a song about Marie for his 1977 EP, Bowi. It’s a black humour masterpiece with a great melody and an unforgettable chorus, “She was a winner that became a doggie’s dinner.”\n\nSome silent movie fans question Anger’s account of Maxie snacking on Marie. Anger never seemed to let the facts get in the way of a good story — Marie wasn’t blonde, or from New York, and didn’t live on Calhuenga Boulevard. But there is no doubt Marie Prevost had a tragic life.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nShe was born Marie Bickford Dunn in Sarnia, Ont., on Nov. 8, 1898. Her father was a Grand Trunk Railway conductor who died in 1904 when he was one of six men asphyxiated by fumes from a steam locomotive in a railway tunnel in Sarnia.\n\nMarie’s mother married Frank Prevost, and the family moved around the U.S. until settling in Los Angeles. Marie was discovered when she was visiting a set and was mistaken for an actress and put into a scene. Mack Sennett spotted Marie’s natural comic ability, and signed her up for $15 a week.\n\nBeing beautiful helped, of course. In 1923, a Los Angeles Times writer called her the “delectable Marie Prevost,” a woman with a “form divine.”\n\nIn 1924, her marriage to fellow star Kenneth Harlan was touted as “the romance of the Hollywood year.” But “Hollywood’s perfect marital team” separated in 1927 and divorced two years later.\n\nMarie was quite wealthy at one point, with a big mansion in Beverly Hills. But she lost her fortune in the 1929 stock market crash and ensuing Great Depression. When she died, she left an estate of only $300.\n\njmackie@postmedia.com\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
