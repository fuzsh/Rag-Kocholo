        "text": "July 18, 2019\n\nIn the silent era of Hollywood, the people who were making movies were inventing a new art form as they were going along. They were every bit as talented, clever, and ambitious as their counterparts in the sound era but they were working in a period that doesn’t get the attention it deserves. Thank goodness for Laini Giles! She’s made it her mission to shine a spotlight on a time and place where the spotlight does shine nearly as often as it should. With her third book about forgotten silent movie actresses, Laini tells the cautionary tale of Marie Prevost, whose life remind us how quickly fortune can slip through our fingers. And that can happen during any era, can’t it?\n\nSeptember 17, 2020\n\nThis author keeps getting better and better. Of the three books that she's written that I've read this one tops the list and I liked the first two books (The Forgotten Flapper and The IT Girl and Me). I knew about Clara Bow (The IT Girl and Me) because my dad was HUGE fan of hers (he was born in 1910 so he got to experience Clara's fame and fortune in the flesh, so to speak). And I had heard of Olive Thomas but didn't know anything about her. I did not know even a tiny bit about Marie Prevost but given the excellence of the first two books, I took a chance and bought \"Bathing Beauty: A Novel or Marie Prevost.\n\nFrom the first page, I was hooked. So much so, that I continued reading it all night until the end.\n\nWhat a wonderful book that gives a very good insight into a time long gone past. The studio owners were much friendlier in this book than in any other book I have read about the Big Movie Studies. Even Harry Cohn came off much better than the womanizing letch he is written as in other biographies or books dealing with that period.\n\nBefore I read this book, the only \"Bathing Beauty\" I was even a bit familiar with was Esther Williams. It was good to find out that the females in films of that time period, had their own positions.\n\nWhile this book was interesting and taught me a lot that I didn't know, it was also sad. Marie Prevost did not lead a charmed life like many assume all females in silent films and early talkies did. Marie had her problems and as time went on her life only gained more and more problems. From husband #1 to husband #2, Marie's love life was dismal. From the highest of highs, to the lowest of lows, Marie rode the roller coster.\n\nAnd it was good to know that the reason the Motion Picture & Television Fund Foundation came into being to show concern from Hollywood and to show the public that they had a heart and took care of their own. It was not good to learn that Marie's death in poverty was one of the main reasons why this foundation came about.\n\nOf all the relationships in this book, the one between Marie and her mother was the best and sweetest. My heart sank like a rock when I read of Hughie's death (short for Hughlina). Usually the mom's seem to be \"stage mothers\" and only see their daughters as \"providers\" but not Hughie. Her love for Marie came through loud and clear and it made me smile. Another character that totally surprised me was Joan Crawford. Who knew that she could be so giving in friendship as she was to Marie. I certainly didn't and I've read just about every biography about Joan that there is out on the market. Just like Martin Turnbull in his Irving Thalburg biography \"The Heart of a Lion\" made Garbo into a real flesh and blood person so too did Laini Giles do for Joan Crawford. Twenty-five stars for Laini!!!\n\nFinally, while I know that fat shaming was prevalent since the beginning of \"moving pictures\", I did not know how bad it was. And not only did Marie suffer from food addiction (and I believe a hereditary \"fat\" gene) but she also was an alcoholic.\n\nAnyway, if you like biographies of the early film stars, give this one a chance. The writing is sympathetic without being maudlin and the characters are well written and thought out.\n\nI cannot wait for another book by this author in her \"forgotten actresses series\". I'm wondering who she will choose to write about but while I wonder that, I do know that it won't matter because the light will shine on whatever actress and Laini Giles will bring her back to life with her words.\n\nJune 25, 2019\n\nTwo things you can count on from a Laini Giles book are meticulous research and a flawless feel for time and place. When reading one of her books, I no longer feel the need to double check the story as she's telling it -- I know everything will be 'right,' with no anachronisms and no sloppy urban legends passed along as fact. I knew almost nothing about Marie Prevost, other than the sordid Hollywood Babylon article (don't ask!), but I took her to my heart as I read about her. Highly recommended!\n\nJuly 10, 2019\n\nAnother extraordinary read from Laini Giles' series on Forgotten Actresses. Having read her previous books in this series and being acquainted with the actresses, I was especially curious to read her latest since I had never heard of Marie Prevost. Marie was a busy actress in the very early days of Hollywood and made literally dozens of films, both silent and \"talkies\". She was fortunate enough to be able to transition from silent films to talkies when many actors and actresses were not so lucky. She started very young as a \"bathing beauty\" in Mack Sennett films and then moved on to more serious film roles. Some big names mentioned in this book: Joan Crawford, Irving Thalberg, Jean Harlow, Jack Warner and others. Laini, as always, did meticulous research for this novel. She treats the somewhat sad story of a great actress who ended up in a downward spiral due to alcoholism, the death of her mother, bad romances and a weight problem with great sensitivity and respect. Marie was an early victim of \"fat shaming\" by Hollywood and it is poignant and painful to read of the things she did to try to control her weight and maintain her image. At times humorous, at times deeply moving, Laini made this unknown actress come alive for me. Her deep affection for these early film actresses who are little remembered is evident in the understanding and loving way she describes their frailties. Cannot wait for the next book in this series!\n\nJune 3, 2019\n\nOh, pauvre Marie.\n\nI liked her so much. Why does life have to suck so much?\n\nWhoever said hard work pays off? Jerk.\n\nIt's being in the right place at the right time. She saw success. It crested, then fell. Oh how it fell.\n\nLaini's descriptive words and old timey expressions are a gas!!\n\n\"Cougar juice\". Lmao!\n\nThe clothes, the cars. All the Hollywood glamour. Then the scuz. So vividly written. I even risked motion sickness to get more chapters read.\n\nIncredible flow.\n\nYou could read this again and again. Highly recommended.\n\nJanuary 1, 2024\n\nAs a history buff I always appreciate someone who does their homework and Laini Giles definitely delivers! Her attention to detail brings you seamlessly into the world of Hollywood in the 1920's. From fashion to food to headlines of the day, Laini has a firm grip on how Marie Prevost lived and died. Ms. Prevost's interesting, albeit tragic, life makes for a fascinating read and with Ms. Giles excellent pacing it's never dull. Bathing Beauty is my introduction to this author's work and I can't wait to read her two previous books.\n\nJuly 26, 2019\n\nThis is the third installment in Ms. Giles' \"Forgotten Actresses\" series....and it sizzles like the first two! A quick, smooth read from whirlwind beginning to heartfelt end. Quite a bibliography, which tells me that Laini did quite a bit of research; so like THE IT GIRL AND ME (story of Clara Bow) and THE FORGOTTEN FLAPPER (story of Olive Thomas) you know you're getting the facts.....just the facts! So.....who gets the exclusive Giles treatment in her next installment? I can hardly wait for her next \"Forgotten Actress!\"\n\nJuly 26, 2021\n\nEnjoyable and interesting story of Early Hollywood, fast reading. Great book for Movie Buffs and fans of the Silent Era.\n\nJanuary 7, 2023\n\nLITERATURE IN PUNK ROCK - Books #1, #3 and #4\n\nBOOKS:\n\n- Hollywood Babylon by Kenneth Anger\n\n- Bathing Beauty: Marie Prevost by Laini Giles\n\n- Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs? by Caitlin Doughty\n\nSONG: Mary Provost by J Church (Nick Lowe)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4QIz3CbHkWo\n\nMarie Prevost was a Canadian-American Star of the Silver Screen. She starred in 121 silent films during her short Hollywood career from 1915 to 1936.\n\nHer illustrious career however turned with the twin apocalypse of the Wallstreet Market Crash of 1929 and the arrival of talking pictures (\"Talkies\"). Her final years were spent alone chasing bit parts, battling destitute poverty and alcohol abuse.\n\nMarie was all but forgotten until 30-years later when Kenneth Anger featured her death in the book \"Hollywood Babylon.\" In the book, Anger claimed Prevost's pet dachshund had consumed her remains over the ensuing days to survive until her body was found (\"making mincemeat of his mistress\").\n\nAnger's account of her death served as inspiration for English Song-Writer Nick Lowe whom penned the snickery black humor song \"Marie Provost” on his 1978 album “Jesus of Cool.” San Francisco punk band, J Church cover \"Mary Provost\" on the Ivy League College LP (1995). NOTE: the misspelling of Mary/Marie and Prevost/Provost were intentional by the respective artists.\n\nThe account by Hollywood Babylon (and Lowe) however is exaggeration. Mortician Caitlin Doughty in her book \"Will My Cat Eat My Eyeballs?\" details that dogs may eat their owner’s lips and tongue, but only because they’re desperately trying to wake us up (not because we look yummy!). This matches the LA Times reporting on her death that \"...teeth marks on the actress’s body indicated the animal had tugged at his mistress in an attempt to arouse her.\"\n\nNearly a century later, the infamy of her death continues to eclipse her life; but not without notable efforts for correction. Laini Giles' Forgotten Actress book series (likewise inspired from Hollywood Babylon) combines historical research with fictionalized story-lines for a sympathetic look at infamous Hollywood hard-luck cases.\n\nAugust 6, 2022\n\n\"Bathing Beauty\" is Laini Giles' third novel in the the Forgotten Actresses series and is once again a delight to read. It details the life of the silent screen actress Marie Prevost (born 1898) through her life to her death in 1937. Towards the end of her career she was in the process of breaking into sound pictures which were then becoming the big thing in Hollywood, but by this time she was by motion picture standards getting a little on the old side, and was having issues with her weight, alcoholism, and various medical issues such as reoccurring ulcers. As an aside it seems rather strange to me that Hollywood is still after almost a hundred years unwilling to accept people for who they are in the areas of age and appearance.\n\nMs. Prevost has 120 screen credits to her name according to IMDB, but unfortunately for a good number of these she wasn't given any screen credit, and a number of them were considered to be \"shorts\". In addition towards the latter part of her career she was given a number of supporting roles, which didn't help her career too much.\n\nI found this story to be very well written, and engrossing. It was written with style, and the amount of research Ms. Giles had to do is simply astounding.\n\nI'm very much looking forward to the next instalment in this series, but so far haven't heard what it will be.\n\nJuly 30, 2024\n\nFull disclosure, the author of this book is my cousin. This is not my usual reading material and while I do like some historical fiction I prefer it to feel a bit more accurate. I know that Laini does lots of research and all these characters may have actually existed but there's just to much name dropping to keep it all straight. It feels like she adds in characters just to get a bit name on the page - sometimes, fewer can be better. This is the fourth book Laini has written and the third in her Forgotten Flapper series and while it does have the same rags to riches to rags storyline, I see definite improvement in her writing style and storytelling ability. I look forward to reading her future novels.\n\nJanuary 23, 2020\n\nIt’s a Heartbreak\n\nReading about this little known character actress whose performances always captivated me was eye-opening. Unless you’re an avid silent film fan or even a lover of 1930s talkies, Marie Prevost’s name wouldn’t ring a bell. But she was a gem! She had a best-pal quality in her films that was charming, witty, and so endearing. So to read about the sadness in Marie’s life, and the struggles she endured makes me want to see every film she made. Marie’s story is written in her own voice, which makes it more real and so poignant. Lainie Giles has another winner here!\n\nJuly 17, 2023\n\nI read a lot of Old Hollywood nonfiction. As I have gotten deeper into the past, I’ve come across some people who don’t have proper biographies on file. The author of this novel must have been in the same place as I. Using the scant scholarly write ups and the many-less reliable—entertainment media pieces, she tried to reconstruct Marie Prevost’s life as a novel.\n\nPredictably the result is a little weird as novels go, but I liked it as a thought experiment.\n\nPoor Marie! Immortalized by a liar (Kenneth Anger, author of Hollywood Babylon) she had a hard life."
