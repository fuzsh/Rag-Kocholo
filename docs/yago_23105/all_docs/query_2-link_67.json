        "text": "Helen Prevost, 90, of New Braunfels, died April 24, 2014 at her residence. Funeral services will be held Tuesday, April 29 at 11:00 a.m. at St. John''s United Church of Christ in Burton with Pastors Glen Schoenberg and Judy Sherman officiating. Burial will be in the church cemetery. Helen Mary Prevost was born Helen Mary Matley on August 4, 1923, on Galveston Island, to parents Helen Jeanette DelPappa Matley and Wyley Pierson Matley. She entered the world a month early and weighed only three pounds. Helen proved to be a fighter – we are here 90 long years later as proof of that. Helen was one very loved little girl and was raised under the watchful eyes of her great-grandmother Caruso and grandmother Nanny DelPappa. Their Victorian homes stood in the heart of what is now UTMB Medical School. Her immigrant family worked hard as fishermen, and Helen would recount some of the bountiful meals Pappa would bring home for the family and for the lucky medical residents who were renting rooms from them. Some of her favorite childhood memories were that of running the boulevards, walking board fences, sitting atop gate posts and watching beautiful women strolling by for visits to the Medical School. She would say, \"They had the most beautiful make-up. I wanted to be just like them.\" Later, she would learn those pretty ladies were from the \"red light\" district – legal back in those days! Helen and her family had quite a laugh over that story throughout the years! In 1928 her father fell from a telephone pole while at work and died. Five years later, God placed a man named Charles White in her life. He would fall in love and marry her mother and the three became a family. Helen became the apple of his eye. His world revolved around \"Puddin\", as he would always call her. The new family moved from Galveston to Houston where Helen went to Thomas Edison Jr. High, Milby High School, and after their move to West University, Lamar High School. After high school, Helen joined the Navy and as a WAVE learned office skills. Those skills led her to gainful employment with insurance firms and import-export companies throughout her adult life. Helen moved to Burton in 1992 to be near family and found a community of faithful friends. She loved her daily Walmart runs with Mayor Peggy Wilford, visiting the cemetery with Lola Jean, playing dominoes and eating Friday lunches with Stella and her lady friends from St. John''s Church, and visiting with Gloria. Helen loved simple pleasures like bowling, fishing, playing bingo and taking in the beauty of the evening sky at the end of the day. Helen has three children from her marriage to Tommy Coupland, which ended in divorce in 1954. This family includes: Son, Bobby Coupland and wife Linda, their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren: Amy Poole children, Nicole Loskoski and grandchildren Salene and Grayson, Rachel Anderson and Savannah Poole, Lynn Coupland children, Tiffany Gaines and grandchildren J''lynn, Jaycee and Ciara. Daughter, Becky Houck, her children and grandchildren: Scott Houck children, Lindsey and Jack, Jim Houck children, Luke and Finn, Chad Houck child, Reagan. Daughter, Helen Stark and husband Tony, their children and grandchildren: Kristine Eads children, Michael Talbott and Toni Eads, Sandra Mazoch children Emily Mazoch and Brooke Mazoch, Lori and husband Jay Thomas children, Lauren Garner and Jake Thomas. Helen was also mother to two daughters and stepmother to another daughter from her marriage to John Lewis. This marriage ended with the death of John in 1966. This family includes: Daughter, Melinda Faubion and husband Michael, their children Sarah Faubion-Smith and husband Chris; Tyler Faubion and wife Caitlin. Daughter, Lurlyne Meek and husband Ed, their children Stephen Meek, Joey Meek and wife Sarah son Wyatt, Daniel Meek. Stepdaughter, Johnnie Sue Willis, who preceded her in death in 2004. As we say goodbye to a loving mother, grandmother, great-grandmother and friend here on earth, she is being greeted in heaven by a host of family and friends who have been patiently waiting. The first to greet her will be her tiny Chihuahua, loving and loyal companion of 19 years, Bebe. It will be an epic reception. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be given to Burton Bridge Ministry, 601 N. Main St., Burton, TX 77835. Funeral arrangements are entrusted to Memorial Oaks Chapel, 1306 W. Main St., Brenham, TX.
