        "text": "OP, we don't know what people here know, with the decay of the DL culture. (I'm being a little facetious.)\n\nThe great show business scandals of yore and recency seem well-covered and known (William Ince murder, George Reeves, Chaplin's and Flynn's sex-crime issues, Arbuckle, George Kaufman's sexual skills, Mary Astor's diary, Albert Dekker's lipstick-and-drag hanging, David Carradine, Bob Crane the murdered sex freak, the drug arrests and career deaths from the silent era on, Harlow's wee-cocked hubby's suicide, Loretta Young's bastard by Gable, Rex Harrison the suicide magnet, Liberace, Sal, Jimmy, Jack Nicholson, Mitchum's pot bust, etc.).\n\nBut nowadays who knows who knows what? If we post something, people will either complain about it being obvious or complain they don't know who the players were.\n\nBUT if you don't know of one of the things mentioned, I'm sure many of us would be happy to oblige. Eager, even. Just whistle.\n\nYou know how to whistle, don't you?\n\nDL people know this, but I haven't seen it mentioned so I'll throw it out. Joan Bennett's husband Walter Wanger shot her agent, Jennings Lang, when Lang and Joan were having an affair. He didn't kill him, though.\n\n[R4] It wasn't that Marilyn was a slut - the fact is, and I was told this by a female star, that the starlets were expected to sleep with everybody. This particular actress I knew was (and actually still is) incredibly beautiful and worked on stage. She got offers from Hollywood but didn't take one until the contract was for $1250 a week. Under that amount, you were part of what she called the \"visiting fireman brigade.\" I'm talking about the young beauties, not character women. Someone like Marilyn was expected to entertain at parties, probably even distributor conventions.\n\nIn truth, a lot of times when you see an actress in an old film and think, why didn't she have a bigger career, it's probably because she wouldn't sleep with the right person. I had another actress, now deceased, tell me that she made it pretty clear that she wasn't going to cooperate, and though she did a few good films, her career never took off. She eventually had huge success and made a fortune on television.\n\n[quote]I'd heard of a lot of these but I hadn't heard anything of George Kaufman's sexual skills, Mary Astor's diary\n\nGeorge S. Kaufman was extremely skilled at pleasuring women orally, among other ways. His long list of lovers included Natalie \"Lovey Howell\" Schaefer who turned down an MGM contract telling Louis B. Mayer that she didn't want to leave her boyfriend in NYC. Mayer told her to bring him to Hollywood with her.\n\nShe replied, \"I don't think his wife will let him.\"\n\nTo which Mayer replied, \"And I thought you were a lady.\"\n\nMary Astor also had an affair with Kaufman and she chronicled their sex life in an extensively detailed diary. She wrote that Kaufman was the kind of lover she would go over a cliff for. Eventually, parts of the diary were read aloud in a courtroom during Astor's divorce trial. The edited but still spicy details were printed in papers nationwide.\n\nThis caused Kaufman great pride and also great distress. He and his wife had been in an \"understanding\" marriage after losing a severely deformed child in stillbirth. Their agreement had been to seek lovers elsewhere but to never embarrass each other publicly. Friends later reported that tarred as he was by the scandal, Kaufman was also annoyed when people misremembered the identity of Astor's great lover and wrongly attributed Kaufman's great skills at cunnilingus to his gay collaborator, Moss Hart.\n\nBig Bill Tilden was overwhelmingly voted the greatest tennis player of the first half of the 20th century in an Associated Press poll only six weeks after being released from prison for the second time on a conviction of having fondled and made unwanted advances to a teenage boy. In November of 1946, a patrol car noticed a Packard convertible driving erratically with what appeared to be no one behind the wheel. When they stopped the car, Bill Tilden had hastily switched places with a young boy who had been driving the car while Tilden was going down on him. The boy's fly was open.\n\nTilden, was never able to equal his great success as a tennis player. Born into wealth, in later years he sunk a lot of his own money into Broadway shows he wrote and produced. Shunned by everyone in Hollywood after this last arrest, only Charlie Chaplin would allow him to use his tennis court in Hollywood.\n\nDot Mackaye was a comedic actress along the lines of Lucille Ball back in 1920s Hollywood, and she was involved in one of the first and saddest love triangles in the history of Tinseltown.\n\nDot's hubbie, Ray Raymond, was a tireless song-and-dance man who traversed the country plying his trade — from Broadway to motion pictures to vaudeville houses. He was a slight man, devoted to their daughter.\n\nThe man who came between them, Paul Kelly, was a child actor from Brooklyn who became one of the country's busiest supporting actors, on stage and screen. He was also a hunk and a trained fighter.\n\nKelly's house boy, a young Japanese immigrant known as 'Jungle,' revealed that he had served breakfast to Mrs. Raymond after a number of their all-night pajama parties in Kelly's bachelor pad. Her insistence that their friendship was innocent became even more absurd when a stack of Kelly's love letters were found tucked in her marital mattress.\n\nWhen Raymond confronted Kelly, Kelly beat him so badly he died from his injuries. Dot Mackaye got a doctor to say Raymond died of \"natural causes,\" but the truth came out. She served two months, Kelly served two years, they reunited, appeared together on Broadway, and then bought a ranch together in Northridge. Dot wrote a story about her imprisonment at San Quentin which was made into \"Ladies They Talk About\" with Barbara Stanwyck.\n\nDot Mackaye died at age 40 from internal injuries that went undiagnosed after her car ran into a ditch and rolled over several times. Paul Kelly went on to have a long career, remarried, and made a lot of money. But Kelley also died young, from a heart attack at age 56 in his Beverly Hills home at 1448 Club View Drive in 1956.\n\nBilly Haines always played a young arrogant man who is humbled by the last reel. It was a formula at which he was very successful and he worked in Hollywood films all through the 1920s. By 1930 he was listed as the number one box office attraction in the country.\n\nOn a trip to New York in 1926, Haines met Jimmie Shields, possibly as a pick-up on the street. Haines convinced Shields to move to Los Angeles, promising to get him work as an extra. The pair were soon living together and viewed themselves as a committed couple.\n\nHowever, in 1933 Haines was arrested in a YMCA with a sailor he picked up in Pershing Square. Louis B. Mayer gave him an ultimatum - a sham marriage or no career. Haines walked away from an acting career, and subsequently became one of the best-known interior designers and antique dealers in America.\n\nHaines' and Shields' lives were disrupted in June 1936 when approximately 100 members of a white supremacists group dragged the two men from their El Porto, Manhattan Beach home and beat them, because a neighbor had accused the two of propositioning his son. The incident was widely reported at the time but Manhattan Beach police never brought charges against the couple's attackers. The child molestation accusations against Haines and Shields were unfounded and the case was dismissed due to a lack of evidence.\n\nHaines and Shields stayed together from 1928 until Haines' death from lung caner in 1973, after which Shields took his own life, being unable to live without \"my Billy.\" Joan Crawford described them as \"the happiest married couple in Hollywood.\"\n\nIn 1915, when a kitchen stove fire singed his sister Mabel’s lashes and brows, Tom Lyle Williams watched in fascination as she performed a “secret of the harem,” mixing petroleum jelly with coal dust and ash from a burnt cork, and applied it to her lashes and brows. Mabel’s simple beauty trick ignited Tom Lyle’s imagination and he started what would become a billion-dollar business and remains a viable American icon after nearly a century. He named it Maybelline in her honor and began selling mascara and brow powder.\n\nWilliams got married to a woman and had a child at 16 but the love of his life was Emery Shaver, an advertising exec. They lived quite the Hollywood life. First, they bought Valentino's house after the star died, made it Maybelline's West Coast headquarters, and planted hundreds of palms around it for privacy. Apparently, Williams was fond of his own product.\n\n“We didn’t think anything of it, when he had his own makeup on. We just thought he was a glamorous man. We adored him so much that it wouldn’t have mattered.” Shaver died of a massive heart attack in 1964, after which Tom Lyle fell into a deep depression. He carried on until 1976.\n\nThe only \"scandal\" here was that Williams stayed in the closet so long while hiding in plain sight.\n\nThe documentary \"Six Degrees of Helter Skelter\" contains some interesting trivia on the Manson Gang murders: Roman Polanski thought for a time that John Phillips of the Mamas and Papas had been the murderer and had John's house searched for a murder weapon. The original Tate/Polanski house on Cielo Drive (no longer there) was across the canyon from Doris Duke's house, Falcon's Lair, which had been Valentino's mansion earlier. Doris would later die there possibly as a result of neglect by her butler/housekeeper. Before the Tate/La Bianca murders, the Manson gang lived with Beach Boy Dennis Wilson, who later committed suicide, some think partly as a result of guilt at being associated with them, but more likely multiple problems. The Beach Boys actually recorded a song written by Manson but retitled as \"Never Learn Not to Love.\" Brian introduced Manson to Doris Day's son, a record producer names Terry Melcher, who was living in the Cielo Drive house before Roman and Sharon moved in. It was Terry Melcher the Manson Gang was looking for initialy when they murdered all of the occupants of the Cielo Drive house along with a guy who was visiting the housewatcher. Jay Sebring, the celebrity hairdresser who ws murdered, was credited with giving Jim Morrison of the Doors his signature fabulous hairstyle.\n\nWas Bob Crane bisexual?\n\nI want to thank R43 for that super ,but very sad link. I'm renting the documentary from the library. Why did people like Ann Miller and many others say Mayer was a gentleman when in reality by R43 link, he was a corrupt monster! I once watched an interview with Helen Hayes many moons ago and she said Mayer was an evil man. She said she was friends with Irving Thalberg ,and she said he was a wonderful, nice, very intelligent man and he really was ahead of his time because he thought out of the box for making movies. Helen Hayes said when Irving Thalberg was dying Mayer was thrilled almost jumping for joy and was waiting for him to die.He hated Irving Thalberg so much because he was jealous of his great talent,and having such talent at a young age as well.\n\nF. Scott Fitzgerald's book, The Last Tycoon is loosely based on Thalberg.\n\nThe kids who worked with Bobby \"Wheezer\" Hutchins on The Little Rascals set at Hal Roach Studios knew there was something different and wrong about the way he was being raised. His watchful father prevented him from talking to the other kids off camera.\n\nBobby's father had a plan to keep the child star small and employable by underfeeding him. He didn't want Bobby and his siblings to learn that normal kids got a lot more to eat than they did. NO one ever attempted to intervene on the children's behalf.\n\nWhat made it worse was that the plan backfired. Although he was incredibly photogenic and he delivered some fine moments on screen, \"Wheezer\" was not a particularly resourceful child actor. His natural charm sustained his career as the kid brother from ages two to five. But by age six and seven when he grew to leading boy status, he looked and acted like the slow-witted, malnourished child he was.\n\nStronger and sharper boys his age were given the better parts while Wheezer spent the last year of his contract standing in the background with little to do. He made one non-Rascals short at age eight and his film career ended. He died at age twenty in 1945 crashing his fighter plane in the last half hour of basic training.\n\nBobby Hutchins' abuse was the sort that Christina Crawford claimed was rife in Hollywood. Average society considered it intrusive to question other people's parental methods in those days. People in Hollywood who raised kids as actors or PR props could get away with all sorts of abuse. The code of silence was strict with real reason.\n\nThe Murder of Thelma Todd is a tale worth telling in movie form again. The beauty queen came to Hollywood against her wishes. Her producer Hal Roach put a \"five pound clause\" in her contract allowing him to fire her if she gained weight. This led to her getting addicted to amphetamines.\n\nThelma was more than a blond bombshell. She was a skilled comic and a shrewd businesswoman. She lived on the third floor above the building that housed her Seaside Cafe. After putting the kibosh on her gangster boyfriend's plans to convert her cafe into a casino, Thelma turned up dead in a car in the garage of her building.\n\nThe crime was never solved. Her last movie was re-filmed with another actress even though she had completed it. Thelma was rubbed out completely. Her beautiful building went up for sale last fall for $8 million.\n\nR55, I always thought John Huston raped his daughter. He was considered pure evil ,and he liked girls as young as 12 and 13 years old. I think Angelica is sick because she talks about her father fondly ,and the man was a monster.\n\nRobert Blake said when he was a little boy his parents made him eat out of a dog bowl and he had to crawl on all fours around the house. They kept him in the closet as well. When he received his pay checks from the studio his parents took them.\n\nBTW, in general, the our gang kids all had tragic ends accept for Spanky and Butch. Even the original dog Pete was poisoned and no one knows who did it, sick!\n\nR76, someone on here some time ago that her death was an accident and stood by that claim. Right! anyone ,especially in those days, who told the mafia to go screw off which she did, were dead. No one got away with telling the mafia off. She was a very independent and liberated lady who took no BS what so ever but sadly she paid the ultimate price for it.\n\nNo one on here has mentioned one of the real puzzling cases that should be reopened, which was Mickey Rooney's ex wife's death. Remember that one? Apparently she blew her brains out. I don't know the full story on that one ,but apparently Rooney was at her home when it happened ,and it was labeled a suicide. I used to work with this lady whose friend was one of those Vegas show girls. She said Mickey Rooney was in Vegas to star in his show at the time Sugar Babies and she had to do a dance routine for Mickey's show.She said her friend, the Vegas dancer, said Micky had a very, very scary temper especially when he drank which was a lot. After hearing that it wouldn't surprise me if he murdered his ex wife.\n\nDoes anyone on here believe Lana Wood is going to reveal who raped her sister when the bastard, her words, dies? She claimed her sister was afraid of the water but on YouTube there is a home movie of Natalie Wood playing in the ocean at Roddy McDowall's seaside home. Check the link out. What is up with Lana Wood? Is she nuts? Why did she make that up about her sister having a phobia of water?\n\nR79, here is a YouTube link to an interview that was done 3 years ago ,which Lana Wood is discussing her sister's death. In the interview she brings up her sister's fear of water to the extent she had a pool in her home and she would not go in it, and as a whole she was afraid of water period. Also, read the comment down below in the YouTube home movie link on R78 by the guy who posted the home movie his YouTube name is SoapBox. He said that he knows various famous people who said that Natalie being afraid of water was bull.\n\nBTW, I have a fear of water ,and there is no way I would go near the ocean.\n\nI posted this on the Joan Crawford thread and I'm wondering if anyone knows who these people Joan Crawford is talking about? She wouldn't reveal their names.I finished reading Conversations with Joan Crawford by Roy Newquist. I highly recommend the book btw. She talks about two blind items in her interview some movie stars who were in the studio system closet. She said a very major actor in 20th Century Fox who she said she won't reveal his name, was a dope addict and an alcoholic ,and he was gay as a goose? Does anyone know who this might be? Someone said they thought it was Tyrone Power because he was considered King of 20th Century Fox, but I don't recall reading he did drugs? I came across information that Errol Flynn did heroin and was an alcoholic. Also, Errol Flynn was a major 20th Century Fox actor so I wonder if that was him? However, Joan said earlier in the book that everyone in Hollywood knew Errol liked teenage girls.Also, at one point earlier in the book she said Tyrone Power, Marylin Monroe,and Judy Garland were dope addicts? maybe pill poppers but dope addicts? I never heard that about Tyrone Power before using drugs, only smoking a lot and drinking.\n\nAnother blind item Joan stated in the conversation was that MGM made a gay actor marry a lesbian who was older than him? Who was that? Geer Garson married a younger actor ,but I highly doubt she was a lesbian.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas who are these blind items?\n\nGail Russell: In 1950 Gail married matinée idol Guy Madison, one of the up-and-coming actors in Hollywood but Paramount refused to renew her contract due to Gail's out of control drinking problem. When Gail married Guy Madison (one of Henry Willson's manufactured pretty-boys) it was a very common and persistent rumor that Madison was in fact also gay and it was an arranged union. Indeed in the book 'The Man Who Invented Rock Hudson', there is a hefty amount of anecdotal evidence that Madison wasn't straight. Himself and fellow Willson boy Rory Calhoun are thought to have had a long-running affair. The marriage was an extremely unhappy one for Russell, and she left him in 1954.Her long-running alcohol problem led to Russell running into trouble with the law, ruining her once remarkable looks and becoming a pariah in Hollywood. Work began to dry up and by 1951 Russell's once promising star had dimmed drastically. Her looks were ravaged, and she endured several shocking, embarrassing public run-ins with the law. Including a famous drunk driving incident that nearly killed a man. Despite struggling with her drinking problem and making many attempts to go straight, Russell was ultimately unable to control her addiction and on August 27th she was found dead on her apartment floor, surrounded by empty liquor bottles. She had died alone and her body had lain undiscovered for days. She was found to have been suffering from extreme malnutrition at the time of her death.Gail was long rumored to be a dyke amongst Hollywood insiders from almost the very beginning of her career, as is stated in the biography of Henry Willson 'The Man Who Created Rock Hudson'. * Several women have come forward in off-the-record interviews and have stated that they slept with/had affairs with Russell * The book 'Fallen Angels' names a late in life lover and mentions that Russell was spotted at dyke bars/hangouts. * Her marriage was extremely unhappy and there have been rumors about her husband Guy Madison's sexuality since the 40's. * Gail herself bitterly denied ever having an affair with John Wayne and several lovers of Russell's who were interviewed off-the-record have stated that the relationship between Wayne and Russell was that of brother and sister. * Gail's severe drink problem points to someone struggling internally with themselves.\n\nR129, the older woman was an actress and her younger husband was an actor.\n\nAny guess who the big male movie star Joan was pointing out being gay as a goose and a dope and alcoholic addict? I couldn't be Tyrone Power? He was the major 20th century Fox star from around that period. Errol Flynn was a drug and alcoholic addict ,but she refereed to him liking teenage girls.\n\nR129, someone who knew John Wayne wrote a biography on him. He said John Wayne was just friends with Gail. The author said Gail Russell went on the casting couch and whatever they did to her messed her up with men completely there after. She thought if a guy was nice to her in the least, he wanted to use her and expected sex. The casting couch corruption lead to her becoming an alcoholic because it ruined her life. John Wayne tried to be there for her as best as he could. The author said John Wynne hated what the studios did to women more than everything else. The corrupt Hollywood system enraged John Wynne tremendously because it was a form of rape. Also, the author said it wasn't true that John Wayne abused his wives. There was one wife who he was married to when John was young who was Mexican with a major temper. Both of them used to get into major fights. However, they were very passionate in their marriage.\n\n[R124] Joan was one to talk and she was full of it besides.\n\nTyrone Power never did drugs and he slept with both men and women. Errol Flynn to my knowledge did not do heroin. Also he was with Warner Brothers, not Fox.\n\nMGM did that marriage thing more than once. Mayer made Van Johnson marry Evie Wynn and Gene Raymond marry Jeannette MacDonald. That was because there were heavy rumors about them.\n\nContrary to popular beliefs about bearding, the studios did not want matinee idols to get married too soon if at ALL. Mayer encouraged Robert Taylor to break his engagement -- I forget the actress -- and I don't think they wanted him with Stanwyck. Zanuck did everything he could to get Annabella away from Tyrone Power. He offered her three films in Europe and when she refused to leave he had her blacklisted. Zanuck did force William Eythe into a marriage because again, there were a lot of rumors about him.\n\nVan's arranged marriage to Evie Wynn kind of backfired on the studio, though. She had been married to Keenan Wynn and he and Evie and Van were all good friends. There was even speculation that Keenan and Van had an affair. Who knows? Ed Wynn (comic vaudevillian father of Keenan) made some quotes around that time about the bizarre friendship of the three. \"Evie loves Keenan. Keenan loves Van. Van loves Evie. Who knows WHAT is going on?\" Something along those lines. The studio wanted Johnson married because he was a a major star $$$ and there had been not only rumors about his being gay but also some evidence that Johnson was caught soliticiting men (maybe a sailor) in a restroom somewhere in, I believe, Santa Monica. The studio covered it up but definitely wanted Johnson married. It was complicated and bizarre but the story went that Keenan and Evie divorced (not sure what the official reasons were) and Evie then IMMEDIATELY married Van even before the \"ink was dry\" on the divorce papers. Evie stated years later that it was all a set up, that she was offered a sort of ultimatum. That Keenan would never get work in Hollywood again if she refused. And she knew how powerful MGM was. Well, the public thought it was all odd, as well, and since Van's fans had been primarily teenage girl (he was called the \"voiceless Sinatra\") bobbysoxers, that once he was married he was no longer \"dreamworthy material\" for the girls. And it caused his popularity to drop!\n\nLargely forgotten, Marie Prevost was a popular silent screen star and flapper beauty who specialized in light and romantic comedies, usually paired with Monte Blue, Harrison Ford (the original), and real-life beau Kenneth Harlan. The latter pairing led studio boss Jack Warner to announce that his star couple would officially marry on their next picture, \"The Beautiful and the Damned.\" The problem was, Marie was already married, secretly, albeit estranged from her absent husband. When word got out, a humiliated Warner was livid. Rather than fire the adulterous pair, Warner kept them on (Marie was making the studio too much money to let go), but punished Prevost by assigning her lousy pictures and loaning her out to other studios for what he thought were sure-fire failures. When those pictures turned out successful, an irate Warner dropped her contract.\n\nMarie would continue to work, successfully transitioning into talkies, but after the death of her beloved mother in a car accident, the breakup of her marriage with Harlan, who blamed her for his stalled career, and a failed relationship with Howard Hughes, Marie fell into a deep depression and took to the bottle and binge eating. Marie would gain a considerable amount weight, pushing her out of the running for leading lady roles, and into supporting roles as blowsy dames or best friend of the leading lady (Crawford, Stanwyck, Harlow, etc.).\n\nDesperate to shed pounds and regain her leading lady status, Marie crash dieted, subsisting on alcohol and not much else. On January 23, 1937, she was found dead in her bedroom (she had died a couple of days prior), surrounded by empty bottles of liquor. At her side was her loyal dachshund, who, according to the police report, had chewed up her wrists and ankles trying to rouse her awake. A promissory note to Joan Crawford for $113 was also found in the room. Marie had died of heart failure brought on by acute alcoholism and malnutrition. She was 38.\n\nIn attendence at her funeral, which was paid for by Joan Crawford, were such Hollywood luminaries as Crawford, Douglas Fairbanks Jr, Clark Gable, Barbara Stanwyck, and Mack Sennett, who gave Marie her start as a Bathing Beauty.\n\nWOW! R148! Great post! Gosh I'm loving this thread! Threads like this make DL super fun.\n\nI don't mean to throw off the thread ,but I just have a question. Why do the children of the movie stars and fans of the movie stars who are long gone get angry when a person brings up the slightest hint that they, actor or actors, might have been bisexual or gay? In this day in age no one gets shocked about things like that anymore. Even if someone who doesn't agree with being gay doesn't finch when that subject is brought up anymore because it is a subject that is prominent in our contemporary society.\n\nI belong to myriads of Facebook groups on movie stars on the Golden Age of Hollywood because I adore old Hollywood and the movie stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood. I brought up a question about an actor and the administrator of the group would not allow my question to go up on the group's timeline. I wasn't insulting the actor's image and it was just a question. There are relatives on the Facebook page who apparently didn't like the question.\n\nThe question was on Tyrone Power and I have said, I have heard he had an affair with someone and the woman gave the baby boy up for adoption. Has any of the family located the child? Also, I asked, is it true that Judy Garland had Tyrone's child and gave it up for adoption or is that hearsay? Liza Minnelli claims her mother did and the child is some where in the Mid West is that true or bull? Those things have been floating around for years its not like this is new. The big question you must never ever ask, was Tyrone bisexual or gay, YIKES!\n\nI noticed that out of all the movie stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood, Tyrone Power for some reason is the highest guarded actor when it comes to his personal life after almost 60 years of his death. People want to rip your fingers off from ever typing on a computer key board ever again, WOW!\n\nOnce again, I apologize OP, I'm not trying to throw off your thread.\n\nThere is a major website on Jeremy Brett which goes into great detail about his life but that won't mention he was homosexual.\n\nHis first wife, the wonderful Anna Massey with whom he had a son, said he was and was tortured by the fact his whole life. For some reason the fangirls claim she was lying but what reason would she have had?\n\nA recent biography on Olivier denies he was bisexual though it seems that many important people who knew him have said he was in love with Danny Kaye(though I can't imagine why. Yuck.) I love David Niven's anecdote about visiting Larry and Vivien at their manor and finding Olivier making out with Brando on the pool.\n\nI guess children of stars who were gay or bisexual have a major problem with the fact they were accidents or simply accessories for a Hollywood pr machine.\n\nThe irony is that most of us are. And if not for a Hollywood pr machine then accessories for a hetero lifestyle involving church, social and corporate image.\n\nHomosexuality for many people is still an ugly secret and a slur. I once mentioned that I thought all male actors were gay. And instead of simply responding that it wasn't true that it was just some fantasy I had people got angry and defensive.\n\nDoes anyone know if Mr. Hollywood is still alive? Dose anyone know who he was because some people on DL claim they know who he was?\n\nA lot of these children whose parents were movie stars act like they are liberal minded ,but if you bring up their parents might have been bisexual or gay,all hell breaks lose. Tyrone Power's daughter will rip your eyeballs out if you remotely say he might have had at least one affair with a man.In fact, she wrote a book to prove that her father was not bisexual, gay, nor had any affair with a man. Her book is based on interviews by people who knew the real man. The straight man. Yet, if they have gay friends they are open arms ,but if you claim one of their parents might have gay that is different. If their parents were gay then that is fact end of story.I think these phonies are homophobic.\n\nR160, wow! that is awful! where did you hear or read that? I know that Rita Hayworth was Ginger Roger's cousin and they said Ginger Rogers ignored that fact. Maybe she didn't like the fact that Rita Hayworth was have Spanish? Was ginger Rogers over all a mean person? some people claim she was while others claim she was very nice?\n\nR158! That is so interesting! gosh I'm loving this thread!\n\nIf you see Jeremy Brett in My Fair Lady he is incredibly handsome in those Edwardian tailored suits. And his delight at Eliza's small talk at Ascot is perfection.\n\nI got his autograph once after a play called Aren't We All on Broadway. There was nobody else there except one older gentleman.\n\nBrett seemed astonished and happy that I presented him with the souvenir book of the film to sign as if he hadn't seen it in ages. I told him it was one of my favorite films and he told me it was one of his as well. I wanted to ask him more questions about it but this older guy took over the conversation and wouldn't shut up.\n\nAnyway I saw Brett walking towards 8th Av smoking like crazy on a cigarette looking very skinny and drab in plain english clothes and worn shoes. Had it been a few years later after Holmes hit I'm sure he would have been mobbed by hundreds of fans and I wouldn't have gotten near him.\n\nI was stunned and very saddened by his early death.\n\nTyrone Power was not only gay, he was into scat.\n\nGinger Rogers was detested backstage when she replaced Carol Channing in the Broadway company of Hello, Dolly! I've heard that story about her being offered the 1974 Gypsy revival but can't believe it's true. That production was a transfer of the hugely successful London production a year before with Lansbury, who already had two Tony's and was a bigger Broadway star than Rogers at that time. That production was always intended to transfer with Angela.\n\nThe situation with Selznick, Cukor, Gable and GWTW was very complicated and tangentially involved a very salacious story involving Gable's rentboy past, Cukor's BFF Billy Haines and a bar of soap. I'm too tired to type it all out. But in the end, Cukor was replaced on GWTW not because of Gable's discomfort but because some of Cukor's footage wasn't satisfactory to either him or Selznick, he was fast falling behind schedule and he could no longer tolerate Selznick's micromanagement and interference. It was a mutual decision between him and Selznick that made Gable very happy and Leigh and de Havilland outraged and devastated.\n\nR187, you miss the point that stars are paid far more than most of their co-workers. And it's the job of those co-workers to give their all in order to make the star look good. A year-end thank you in the form of a token gift to each member of the the crew might have cost Ginger all of three hundred bucks when she was probably making at least five thousand a week.\n\nFilm queens like Ginger and Roz would only speak to the company through the stage manager where the real great stage stars tended to be generous and considerate. When Ethel Merman learned that producers Rodgers and Hammerstein docked the company of Annie Get Your Gun a portion of their pay to make up for lost ticket sales during her vacation, the star refused to go on again until the producers paid the cast their full back wages.\n\nMary Martin was so friendly to the chorus of South Pacific, she set up a barber pole backstage and gave free haircuts to any member of the company who dared to accept her services.\n\nHow was it a mutual decision when Cukor was bitter about it and considered himself 'fired.'\n\nCukor was too ambitious a man to ever quit a film like that. He could only have been pushed out.\n\nNot that I ever got to talk to Cukor about it but everything I've read points to Gable pushing him out. And let's face it Gable probably had more power on that film than anyone.\n\nUnless everything I've read about it was pure gossip. But I don't believe in the many interview's I've read with Cukor that he ever said it was a 'mutual decision.' It was always more of the 'I don't know what happened' variety.\n\nHe also allegedly said to Bette Davis 'I was fired from the biggest film of all time.'\n\nSelznick wanted Ronald Colman and did everything he could to get him but he simply wasn't available. (Colman was also Margaret Mitchell's choice.) He also tried to get Gary Cooper and discussed a deal with Jack Warner for Bette Davis and Errol Flynn, but Davis, who wanted to play Scarlett, would not agree to Flynn.\n\nGable, despite being the public's pick, was the LAST person Selznick wanted. It meant making a deal with MGM and his former boss and current father-in-law, Louis B. Mayer. Going with MGM meant being forced to allow them to put up half the production costs in exchange for distribution rights with Loewe's, among other things. It was an act of desperation.\n\nAnd Gable didn't want to do the part. AT ALL. HE didn't think he could meet the public's expectations and dreaded trying. (Not to mention he didn't want to work with Cukor for more than one reason.) He finally consented when Mayer did the old carrot and stick thing: he offered him a big bonus if he did and threatened to suspend him if he didn't. Gable needed the money to pay off his first wife, who was refusing him a divorce so he could marry Carole Lombard. Wife No. 1 accepted the deal and Gable was able to marry.\n\nYou really don't know much about the situation at all.\n\n(Not to mention he didn't want to work with Cukor for more than one reason.)\n\nThat was my entire point which for some reason you onitially chose to ignore.\n\nAnd though publically it might have been a 'mutual decision' in everything I've read Cukor was clearly upset, never forgave Selznick(I think in fact he never worked for him again not for Selznick's lack of trying) and went the rest of his life claiming he was either 'fired' or he 'didn't know what was happening.\"\n\nIf Selznick didn't want Gable the public overwhelmingly did and Selznick knew the public of '39 was right. Which is why Selznick ditched his old friend in placating Gable.\n\nThe couple of scenes we know Cukor filmed that remain in the film are excellent. I think everyone would agree with that. And considering he directed Leigh and de Havilland behind the scenes and they both give brilliant performances all that 'unsatisfactory' stuff is whitewash.\n\nIf Cukor ever denied it was on Gable's say so because of an uncomfortable mutual past which he was being asked in the very open 70s I am not aware of it. He never confirmed it either as he was a discreet gentleman.\n\nSomeone said they did security of the Errol Flynn estate many years ago back in the 1980s. She said she walked right into secret passageways in his home behind walls in which he watched friends of his having sex through two way mirrors. She said the mirrors were still there at the tome. Has anyone heard of who were the actors who had sex in those rooms Flynn watched? Does anyone think his friend, Tyrone Power had sex in those rooms with the two way mirrors?\n\nBTW, the tore down the estate in the 1990s and built subdivisions on the property. Also, the house was highly haunted and Tracy Nelson's father once owned the house. She said there was all kinds of supernatural activity going on.\n\n\"The couple of scenes we know Cukor filmed that remain in the film are excellent.\"\n\nI thought the problem was that Cukor was behind schedule? Or that Selznick wasn't happy with the direction the production was taking?\n\nOr maybe it was Gable, it certainly could have been. The public overwhelmingly wanted him in the role, and he was the biggest cheese in the whole production. Once he signed on, he had to be kept happy, and that wasn't easy when he was working on THE most difficult role of his career.\n\n\"GWTW\" really was the high point of his career, the one time where he combined his trademark charm and charisma with real depth of feeling. If Selznick had realized that Gable wasn't going to be able to achieve that because he hated the director, replacing the director would have made sense.\n\nR200, you forgot about one of Gable's wives in your post. Clark was looking to divorce his second wife, a Texas socialite named Ria, so he could marry Carole.\n\nHis first wife, the older lady who was an acting teacher and who shaped him into the actor and man he became, was long gone by then. He cut her out of his life completely when he got famous.\n\nThe story I read was that Gable knew that Cukor knew that Gable had been fucked in some toilet by Billy Haines when a much younger Gable was on the hustle. Haines would show up on the set of GWTW to visit Cukor and Gable could not handle it. Cukor or Gable had to go.\n\nUsed to have an older gay friend, who at the time I knew him, lived in Sedona, AZ. I spent the night once at his place, sleeping on the couch, BTW, and noticed an 8x10 b&w photo in the bathroom of a callow young man with a wry expression. When asked who this was, my friend, who at that time resembled Gabby Hays, with a full shaggy head of grey hair and beard, said it was him, back when he was a contract player in Hollywood. He later added he'd had an affair with an actor named John Hodiak, who, in the late 40's, was well-known for playing in gangster pictures, and had a pretty masculine public image. My friend added that other actors, such as Cesar Romero and George Montgomery, were also gay, but very, very careful. When asked what studio he was contracted to, my friend did not answer, though I came to assume it was Universal, where Hodiak made a number of films at that time. When I asked him about George Cukor's notorious Sunday afternoon, all-male pool parties, my friend said he'd never gone to them, adding that Hollywood was such a small town, and still is, that, if anyone went to those parties, it was all over town by Monday morning, and he could say good-bye to his career. That's the way it was back then.\n\nAnd, frankly, though there seems to be a lot of leeway nowadays, I wonder if times have really changed, since the closet still seems to be the domain for the big money stars. Honey, it's all about the money..."
