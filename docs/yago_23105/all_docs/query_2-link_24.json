        "text": "Actress Born Nov. 8, 1898 in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada\n\nMarie Prevost was once the reigning queen of the Mack Sennett bathing beauties.\n\nPrevost made her entrance into films with the old Sennett two-reelers. The Sennett studio was the cradle for much talent that came to win much applause from fans. Prevost was there at the same time as Phyllis Haver, and shortly after Gloria Swanson; in fact, she was a bathing girl when Swanson was doing leads.\n\nHer first chance in feature pictures was offered by Charles Ray in \"The Old Swimming Hole,\" which was famous at its time for being a production without any subtitles. Later she did a dramatic interpretation in \"Tarnish\" for Samuel Goldwyn, in which Ronald Colman gained much attention.\n\nIt was Ernst Lubitsch who brought Prevost fame when he cast her in \"The Marriage Circle,\" a picture that started a vogue for sophistication.\n\nShe later appeared in another Lubitsch film, \"Kiss Me Again.\" Warner Bros. cast Prevost in a succession of comedies such as \"Up in Mabel's Room,\" \"Almost a Lady\" and \"Getting Gertie's Garter.\"\n\nAt her height and especially under Lubitsch's direction, Prevost displayed a brilliant sense of comedy. She also knew the silent-screen technique as a result of her Sennett experience.\n\nShe was one of the most popular young actresses from 1921 to 1928. But when talkies surfaced, she attempted to adjust herself to the new medium without the benefit of stage experience.\n\nOne of the last pictures she appeared in was 1936's \"Ten Laps to Go.\""
