Parker McConnell as Maury\n\nCharles McHugh as Shuttlesworth\n\nKathleen Key as Rachel\n\nGeorge Kuwa as Tanner\n\nProduction[]\n\nTo publicize the film, Jack L. Warner, announced that the film's stars, Kenneth Harlan and Marie Prevost, would marry on the film's set. The publicity stunt worked and thousands of fans sent gifts and letters to the couple. However, Warner was unaware that Prevost was still secretly married to her first husband, Sonny Gerke. The Los Angeles Mirror got wind of Prevost's first marriage and ran a story with the headline \"Marie Prevost Will be a Bigamist if She Marries Kenneth Harlan\". Warner was livid over the negative publicity and Prevost's failure to disclose her first marriage despite the fact that the publicity stunt was his idea. Warner quickly arranged an annullment and, when the publicity surrounding the scandal died down, Prevost and Harlan were quietly married.\n\nReception[]\n\nPreservation status[]\n\nTranscript[]\n\nGallery[]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
