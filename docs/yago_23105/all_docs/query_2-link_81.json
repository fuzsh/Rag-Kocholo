        "text": "Maurice Edouard \"Moe\" Prevost , 82, died peacefully at his Queensbury, N.Y., home on June 4, 2010; lovingly cared for by his family, after suffering for nearly a year, from the effects of a major heart attack he sustained in June 2009. Maurice was born Dec. 2, 1927, in St. Johnsbury Township, Vt., the third child and second son of David Joseph Prevost and his loving wife Bertha (Rompre) Prevost. Maurice spent all his formative years in St. Johnsbury Township, graduating from St. Gabriel's Catholic grade school and later from St. Johnsbury Trade School, where he majored in architectural drafting; a career he enjoyed until his retirement in New York in 1990, at age 62. Maurice served in the Vermont State Guard during his early high school years, and eagerly enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War II. He served in the Pacific Theatre for the duration of World War II; receiving several awards/medals including the World War II Victory Medal and the Asiatic Pacific Theatre medal. After World War II ended, he returned to his paternal homestead in St. Johnsbury and after completing his studies, soon married his soul mate and wife of 48 years, Rita C. Lamere, who predeceased him in death in September 1996. Together they raised four children, Dennis George Prevost, Marc Edward Prevost, who died in January 2000, Ann Marie (Prevost) Smith and their youngest son, Nathan Paul Prevost of Dallas, Texas. Maurice and Rita moved to Fort Edward, N.Y., in September 1956, one month before the birth of their beloved daughter, Ann Marie, and where he went to work for Imperial Paper and Color Company. As the company grew and evolved to become Hercules Inc. and later Ciba Geigy, Maurice received numerous promotions based on merit, rising from corporate draftsman to head draftsman to architectural engineer, and finally retiring from Ciba Geigy as a project manager, responsible for designing and overseeing construction of multi-million-dollar corporate projects throughout the entire United States. In this capacity he traveled extensively to corporate construction sites throughout the country and reported directly to the corporate vice president. Maurice especially loved his family, and was well known throughout the North Country for always assisting his family, neighbors and friends with major home renovations, and indeed whole-house construction projects. From designing home additions to roofing homes to helping his only daughter and her husband, Herb Smith, build their dream log home, \"Moe\" was always ready with helpful advice, a sturdy hammer and his time and enthusiasm to help. His wife Rita always joked when Moe got to heaven St. Peter would welcome him in, but only after he repaired the heavenly gates. In addition to his three remaining children, Maurice felt blessed to have eight loving grandchildren to dote on: Katherine Ann Prevost and Angelique Nicole Prevost, Lara Smith and her sister Jinel Smith, Ethan Prevost and his brother Eric Prevost of California, and Adam Prevost and Erin Ashley Prevost of Queensbury. Besides his many home redesign and construction projects, Maurice especially enjoyed fine woodworking in his retirement. And over time he equipped a full woodworking shop in his basement. There he hand-made three full-size roll-top desks using only pins and glue - no nails. The third roll-top desk was presented as a 50th wedding anniversary present to his older brother Jules A. Prevost, a retired U.S. Air Force pilot, and Jules' wife Frances (Bogardus) Prevost. In addition to hand making roll-top desks, Maurice made authentic Mission furniture pieces for his daughter's home; as well as numerous wooden toys and stilts for his many grandchildren. During his active retirement in addition to fine woodworking, Maurice always felt a personal obligation to help those less fortunate in the community. For the last several years of his life, Moe regularly rose at dawn coordinated, sorted, and picked up tens of thousands of pounds of perishable wholesome food items, which he then delivered to the Open Door Soup Kitchen in Glens Falls; the Salvation Army Pantry on Chester Street, and the Cornerstone Soup Kitchen in Hudson Falls. Maurice was predeceased by his cherished wife, Rita (Lamere) Prevost who died on Sept. 15, 1996, his second son, Marc E. Prevost, who died in January 2000; his older brother, Jules A. Prevost, an Air Force colonel who died at 92, and his oldest sister Jeannine (Prevost) Smythe. Maurice is not only survived by his children, Dennis, Ann Marie and Nathan and his grandchildren but also by his youngest sister, Rejeanne E. (Prevost) Bennett. Family and friends may call from 4 to 6 p.m. Friday, June 11, 2010, at Singleton-Healy Funeral Home, 407 Bay Road, Queensbury N.Y. Burial will be private at Pine View Cemetery for the family. Expressions of sympathy may take the form of a donation in Maurice's name to Warren County Health Services or to the Salvation Army on Chester Street in Glens Falls. The family would especially like to express its heart felt thanks to Dr. William Tedesco and Maurice's nurse, Craig Briggs, of the Warren County Health Service, for their compassion, care, and attention to his many medical needs during the last year. Their encouragement and exceptional support fully enabled the family to meet Maurice's last wish - to pass at home surrounded by family and friends."
