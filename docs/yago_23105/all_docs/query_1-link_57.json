        "text": "This is edited and expanded from an entry in my “Too Young, Too Soon” series on my old Angelfire site, written around 2005–07.\n\nMarie Prevost (née Mary Bickford Dunn) (8 November 1898-23 January 1937) was born in Sarnia, Ontario, to Hughlina Marion Bickford and Arthur “Teddy” Dunn. Sadly, her railway conductor dad died when she was an infant, from gas seeping into the St. Clair Tunnel.\n\nAs a toddler, Mary acquired a stepfather, Frank Prevost. In 1900, her halfsister Marjorie was born.\n\nFrank moved the family to Denver soon after the marriage. He was a surveyor and miner who frequently forced them to move in pursuit of get rich quick schemes. Eventually, they settled in L.A., and Hughlina and Frank divorced.\n\nMarie attended Manual Arts High School, which was then a vo-tech school. In 1915, she became a secretary for a law firm representing Keystone Film Company. It was through this job she scored a bit part in a Keystone film.\n\nMack Sennett was so impressed by her, he demanded she be brought to his office, and signed her to a $15 a week contract.\n\nMarie initially played minor comedic roles as a sexy innocent, and became one of Mack Sennett’s famed Bathing Beauties in 1916.\n\nMarie’s first lead role came in 1919, with WWI propaganda film Yankee Doodle in Berlin. Her popularity was immediate, so much so she soon desired to change studios to make the most of her potential. She felt Sennett only cared about making money, not quality and creativity.\n\nKeystone released her, and she signed a $1,000 a week contract with Universal in 1921. Wonder boy Irving G. Thalberg, pre-MGM, helped to make her a star by giving her lots of publicity.\n\nAmong the publicity stunts he arranged was sending her to Coney Island to publicly burn her bathing suit, symbolising the end of her Bathing Beauty days.\n\nMarie starred in light comedies during her time at Universal. When her contract expired in 1922, she signed to Warner Brothers for two years, $1,500 a week. Her future second husband, Kenneth Harlan, was also signed to Warner, and they co-starred as the lead roles of The Beautiful and Damned.\n\nJack Warner drummed up publicity by saying they’d marry on-set. In response, thousands of fans sent letters and gifts.\n\nA less positive response came from The Los Angeles Times, who discovered Marie’s first husband, Sonny Gerke, had just filed for divorce. They ran the damning headline “Marie Prevost Will be a Bigamist if She Marries Kenneth Harlan.”\n\nJack Warner was furious Marie hadn’t told him she was legally married to someone else, though the publicity stunt was his idea.\n\nThe scandal didn’t sink Marie’s rising career at all. She gained great reviews for The Beautiful and Damned, and legendary director Ernst Lubitsch chose her for a starring role in The Marriage Circle, opposite Adolphe Menjou.\n\nThe New York Times highly praised her acting, inspiring Lubitsch to cast her in two more of his films.\n\nMarie and Kenneth Harlan quietly married in 1924, after her divorce was finalised. Warner Brothers chose not to renew their contracts in 1926.\n\nTragedy struck when Marie’s mother was killed in a car accident on 5 February 1926. To try to cope with her great emotional anguish, Marie turned to alcohol and took on a grueling work schedule.\n\nHer melancholia increased when she and Kenneth separated in 1927. A 1928 affair with Howard Hughes ended in another breakup, which compounded Marie’s depression even further.\n\nMarie’s depression began manifesting in overeating as well as excess drinking, and she gained a lot of weight. This led to being cast only in secondary roles.\n\nShe signed to MGM in 1930, but wasn’t given any leading roles. However, she still received good reviews, and transitioned well to sound.\n\nMarie made her last MGM film in 1933. Struggling with finances, she jumped at any film she was offered by other studios, no matter how small the role. To keep these jobs, she crash-dieted.\n\nHer final film was in 1936.\n\nMarie died of acute alcoholism at age forty. Her death was discovered two days later, after neighbours started complaining about her Dachshund’s excessive barking. Joan Crawford paid for her funeral at Hollywood Memorial Cemetery.\n\nWhen Marie’s estate was found to be all of $300, her fellow actors were inspired to create the Motion Picture & Television Country House and Hospital. They were also motivated by several other sad fates of former stars.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThis is edited and expanded from an entry in my “Too Young, Too Soon” series on my old Angelfire site, written around 2005–07.\n\nOlive Thomas (née Oliva R. Duffy) (20 October 1894–10 September 1920) was born in Charlerol, Pennsylvania, the first of James and Rena Duffy’s three kids. When her steelworker dad was killed in a work accident in 1906, the family moved to nearby McKees Rocks.\n\nOlive and her brothers were largely raised by their grandparents, and their mother worked in a factory. Later, they acquired a stepfather, Harry M. Van Kirk, who worked on the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad. Their halfsister Harriet was born in 1914.\n\nAt fifteen, Olive dropped out of school to help with supporting her family. She found a job selling gingham at Pittsburgh’s famed Joseph Horne’s department store (which merged with Lazarus in 1994, and then was gobbled up by Macy’s in 2005). Olive made $2.75 a week ($73.95 in 2018).\n\nAt sixteen, in April 1911, she married 21-year-old Bernard Krug Thomas, a Pressed Steel Car Company clerk. During her marriage, Olive was a clerk at Kaufmann’s, another famed Pittsburgh department store (which Macy’s also gobbled up in 2006, and later closed and sold).\n\nAfter separating from Bernard in 1913, Olive moved to New York and moved in with a relative. She began working in a Harlem department store. Her long-burning dream of becoming famous began taking shape when she won artist Howard Chandler Christy’s Most Beautiful Girl in New York City contest in 1914.\n\nOlive became an artists’ model, posing for many famous artists of the day, and was frequently featured on magazine covers. Her star rose further when she joined The Ziegfeld Follies of 1915, followed by Ziegfeld’s very risqué Midnight Frolic.\n\nOlive continued modelling during this time. Among the artists she sat for was Alberto Vargas. She was the first Vargas Girl (i.e., a partially-naked pinup girl).\n\nOlive’s affair with Florenz Ziegfeld ended when he refused to divorce Billie Burke. Her own marriage legally ended 25 September 1915.\n\nIn July 1916, Olive signed a contract with International Film Company. Her screen début was in the tenth episode of the Beatrix Fairfax serial. Later that year, she met actor Jack Pickford (Mary’s little brother). They eloped on 25 October.\n\nOlive’s first feature was Paramount’s A Girl Like That (1917), after which she signed with Triangle Pictures. Her relationship with Jack became public knowledge soon afterwards.\n\nOlive’s popularity steadily grew while she was at Triangle, but she left in 1918. That December, she signed with Selznick Pictures, Jack’s company. Not only did she desire more serious films, she also felt she’d have more influence on her projects at her husband’s company.\n\nThe move paid off, as Olive became more and more popular, with roles very much to her liking. Olive networked her brothers into Selznick jobs too. William became a cameraman, and James an assistant director.\n\nShe became the first actor to portray a flapper lead character, in the first film depicting the flapper lifestyle. (Big surprise, this 1920 film is called The Flapper!)\n\nOlive was at the pinnacle of success when she and Jack took a second honeymoon to Paris. Tragedy struck when a tired, inebriated Olive, in a darkened bathroom of the Hotel Ritz, mistook a bottle of mercury bichloride for aspirin or sleeping pills.\n\nJack rushed to Olive’s side when he heard her screaming, and frantically did everything he knew how until the ambulance arrived. He stayed by her bedside at the American Hospital of Paris until she passed away five days later.\n\nOlive was only 25 years old.\n\nRumours persist about Olive’s tragic death, but a rational look at the evidence makes it obvious this was a heartbreaking accident, and that Jack behaved the exact opposite of maliciously.\n\nMercury bichloride, while a common syphilis medicine, was also a very common disinfectant, often found in bathrooms. It was also used as a blemish remover and skin lightener.\n\nOlive was one of hundreds upon hundreds of people who died from accidental mercury bichloride poisoning every year in that era.\n\nHad Olive lived, she may have become a superstar and eventually transitioned well into the sound era. Poor Jack also may not have had so many personal problems and his own early grave if he hadn’t lost the love of his life.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThis is edited and greatly expanded from an entry in my “Too Young, Too Soon” series on my old Angelfire site, written in 2005.\n\nNita Naldi (née Mary Nonna Dooley) (13 November 1893–17 February 1961), one of the great silent Vamps, was born in a Harlem tenement. She was the third of Patrick and Julia Dooley’s six children, and the first who survived infancy. Her next-youngest brother, Daniel, was the only other Dooley sibling to live past infancy.\n\nThe upwardly mobile Dooleys, wanting their daughter to get ahead in life, sent her to Holy Angels Academy across the river in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Mary took a ferry every Monday and boarded at the school till Friday, when she travelled back to New York.\n\nThis Catholic girls’ school provided a full, equal education, going above and beyond what many other schools offered girls in this era. Many of its alumni went on to careers in the nascent film industry and theatre.\n\nMary began acting around 1915, though dates and details are currently obscured in a fog of mystery. We do know she was on Broadway by 1918, performing by the Winter Garden. In 1918–19, she was in The Ziegfeld Follies.\n\nShe reinvented herself as Nita Naldi, taking her new surname from roommate Maria Naldi, whom she passed off as her sister. Since her dark features were the opposite of the then-popular ice-cream blonde look, she also falsified her origins as Italian, sometimes Spanish or Irish. Nita claimed her parents were widely-travelled diplomats.\n\nMost of her fellow actors neither believed Maria Naldi were her sister, nor that Nita were Italian or Spanish.\n\nBy the late 1910s, Nita was an established stage Vamp (i.e., a femme fatale), and got many great reviews. Around this time, she also appeared as an extra in a few films.\n\nHer rise to stardom began when she was cast as a dancer in John Barrymore’s Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1920). Though she wasn’t the film’s star, she nevertheless earned a lot of attention, and with it more film roles. Concurrently, Nita continued acting onstage by night.\n\nAmong her co-stars in these early films was Harry Houdini, pictured below in The Man from Beyond (1922).\n\nIn 1922, Jesse Lasky of Famous Players-Lasky (now Paramount) signed her to a single-picture contract for Blood and Sand, in which she co-starred with Rudy Valentino. Nita and Rudy have incredible chemistry in this film, and many consider it her greatest role.\n\nThat July, Nita was signed to a reported five-year contract. Unfortunately, the great momentum wasn’t followed up properly. She was cast in supporting roles, her awesome Vamp potential wasted.\n\nOne of her films from this period was Cecil B. DeMille’s original version of The Ten Commandments (1923). Nita and Rudy also co-starred again in A Sainted Devil (1924), one of the lost films I most passionately long to be found, and Cobra (1925).\n\nNita was dropped from the studio in late 1924, and The Hooded Falcon, a grand epic she and Rudy were to have co-starred in, never came to be. When this dream project fell through, she turned back to single-contract films mostly wasting her potential.\n\nOne of her films during this period, The Mountain Eagle (1925), was the second film Alfred Hitchcock directed.\n\nNita retired from film in 1928. Her final U.S. film, What Price Beauty?, co-stars Myrna Loy in the role that boosted her to stardom. This film also co-stars Rudy’s second wife, Natacha Rambova.\n\nNita’s last two films were made in France and Italy.\n\nBy 1923, Nita had gotten involved with J. Searle Barclay, a wealthy, married playboy 24 years her senior. They married soon after his 1929 divorce, and spent two years in France. Upon their October 1931 return to New York, they settled in the Plaza Hotel.\n\nNita returned to the stage during the hard years of the Great Depression, but it wasn’t enough to make ends meet. She filed for bankruptcy in 1933. In 1940, she and her husband moved into Times Square’s Wentworth Hotel.\n\nUpon being widowed in January 1945, Nita resumed stage acting. Though money problems continued plaguing her, she became quite popular on the theatrical social scene, and earned many TV, radio, and newspaper interviews.\n\nNita died of a heart attack at age 67.\n\nNita’s official website\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThis is edited and expanded from an entry in my “Too Young, Too Soon” series on my old Angelfire site, written around 2005–07.\n\nThomas Meighan (9 April 1879-8 July 1936), one of the top sheiks of the silent screen, was a fellow Pittsburgher. His father, John, was president of Pittsburgh Facing Mills, which made foundry facings. His mother, Mary, was a homemaker. The Meighans were fairly well-off.\n\nWhen 15-year-old Tommy refused to go to college, his dad put him to work shovelling coal in the mill. After a single week, he realised he didn’t want to do such hard, thankless work for the rest of his life, and resolved to pursue higher education after all.\n\nTommy set to work studying pharmacology at med school, but came to feel he was made for different things, and lost interest in medicine. Tommy began working for $35 a week in a stock company.\n\nTommy eventually made it to Broadway, where he scored leading roles and big successes. It was here he met fellow actor Frances Ring (4 July 1882–15 January 1951), sister of popular singer Blanche Ring. They quickly became inseparable, and married not long after they met.\n\nTheir marriage was one of Hollywood’s longest, happiest, and most successful, though they sadly never had any children.\n\nIn spite of what an established name he made for himself, Tommy decided to switch to film acting in 1914. His first film, Dandy Donovan, the Gentleman Cracksman, was made in London, and earned him a contract with Famous Players-Lasky (now Paramount).\n\nThough Tommy was 36 when he began making U.S. films, he quickly became popular. Both he and Lon Chaney, Sr., hit true stardom with The Miracle Man (1919), of which only three minutes now survives.\n\nTommy’s star continued rising through the Twenties, and he co-starred with leading ladies including Mary Pickford, Gloria Swanson, Leatrice Joy, Norma Talmadge, Lois Wilson, Bebe Daniels, Louise Brooks, Lila Lee, and Renée Adorée.\n\nThrough most of his film career, Tommy earned $5,000 a week. At his peak of popularity, he earned $10,000 weekly.\n\nWhen Rudy Valentino was arrested for bigamy in 1922 (having married Natacha Rambova less than a full year after his divorce from Jean Acker), Tommy was one of the people who came to the rescue with raising bail money. Though he barely knew Rudy, he nevertheless sold his gold coin collection.\n\nTommy’s talking debut, The Argyle Case (1929), was a huge success, but at fifty years old, he worried about future popularity. He preoccupied himself with Florida real estate until returning to the screen in 1931. Tommy played fatherly figures in his final films.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, his successful, eponymous Meighan Theatre in New Port Richey, Florida, was forced to close. This theatre has since reopened, and now bears the name Richey Suncoast Theatre.\n\nAround the time of Tommy’s final film in 1934, he was diagnosed with cancer. The next year, he had surgery at the now-razed Doctors Hospital of Manhattan, which had a reputation as a “fashionable treatment center for the well-to-do.” It was also the main Manhattan maternity hospital for uptown mothers.\n\nAt 7 PM on 8 July 1936, at his home in Great Neck, NY, Tommy lapsed into a coma. At 9:10, he passed away with his dear Frances, his brother James, his sister May, and family friend Stella Errol by his side. He was 57.\n\nTommy was always very generous with his money, regularly donating nice chunks of change to the Federation for the Support of Jewish Philanthropic Societies and Catholic charities alike.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe first part of this post is edited and expanded from an entry in my “Too Young, Too Soon” series on my old Angelfire site, written around 2005–07.\n\nMax Linder (né Gabriel-Maximilien Leuvielle) (16 December 1883–31 October 1925) was born in Cavernes, France, to winemakers Jean and Suzanne. He always loved the theatre, and enrolled in the Conservatoire Bordeaux in 1899. Before long, he was winning awards for his acting.\n\nFrom 1901–04, he was a contract player with Bordeaux Théâtre des Arts. He also acted for the Parisian theatre Ambigu-Comique. The stage surname Linder was randomly chosen in 1904, after a walk in Bordeaux brought him to a Linder’s shoe store.\n\nIn 1905, Max began acting in Pathé films, usually in supporting roles. He made a film almost every day. By 1910, he’d created his very recognisable screen character, a dapper dandy with a silk top hat and a moustache, who always gets mixed up in wild misadventures.\n\nMax’s films were hugely popular, and he became the world’s first recognisable screen character, in this era when most comedians had screen personas instead of just playing funny people in funny situations. He starred in hundreds of films during the 1910s.\n\nLike many other early comedians, he also did all his own stunts and came up with a lot of his own material. In 1910 alone, he made one short a week. The French adored Max and looked forward to his weekly adventures.\n\nWhen ill health and a near-fatal roller-skating accident in 1911 took Max out of commission, his fans waited patiently for his return. To explain his absence, he appeared in the documentary Max Dans Sa Famille .\n\nBy 1914, he was famous worldwide, and kept getting more popular. During 1912–13, he toured Spain, Germany, and St. Petersburg. His million-franc Pathé contract was for one film a week, 150 films over three years. Life seemed great for Max.\n\nTroubles began when he fell victim to mustard gas during WWI. This took him out of the service after mere months. He returned home extremely ill, and didn’t return to acting till 1916.\n\nChicago’s Essanay Studios offered him a $5,000 a week contract in the wake of their big star Charlie Chaplin’s departure, but Max was only able to make three of the planned dozen films. He went to an L.A. sanitarium before going home to France. Max recovered from pleurisy by Lake Geneva.\n\nMax returned to film in 1919, and his fans were delighted to have him back. At the end of that year, he returned to Hollywood, where he made features including Be My Wife, The Three Must-Get-Theres, and, most famous of all, Seven Years Bad Luck.\n\nUnfortunately, Max’s health began acting up again, and he returned to Europe. In 1921, he proposed to 16-year-old Hélène Peters (sometimes called Ninette). Her mother rightly refused to let her marry someone 22 years older, and Max caused a scandal by taking Hélène to Monte Carlo.\n\nOn 23 August 1923, Max and Hélène married.\n\nOn 23 February 1924, when Hélène was five months pregnant, she and Max attempted suicide, but were revived. Their daughter Maud was born on 27 June.\n\nMax’s luck seemed to be improving, as his next film, King of the Circus, won much acclaim. Sadly, his mental and physical health continued deteriorating, and Hélène filed for divorce.\n\nOn Halloween 1925, he and Hélène died in a suicide pact or murder-suicide. Maud (who passed away 25 October 2017) was raised by her grandparents, and did a great deal to restore her father’s films and reignite public interest in him.\n\nHarold Lockwood (12 April 1887–19 October 1918), a hugely popular matinée idol born in Brooklyn, is one of those silent stars whose work we can’t appraise accurately. Though he made over 100 films, only about five are known to survive. Most of what we have to go on are vintage film reviews.\n\nHarold was raised in Newark, and became an exporter after graduation. He wasn’t very happy with this career choice, and turned to vaudeville acting. In 1910, he entered film, and worked for four studios.\n\nDuring WWI, Harold and May Allison co-starred in over 23 films and became one of the most popular screen couples of the era. In real life, Harold was married to Alma Jones, by whom he had a son, Harold, Jr., who later became an actor himself.\n\nSadly, Harold was one of the 50–100 million victims of the 1918–19 flu pandemic, which mostly killed young, healthy people. He was only 31.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
