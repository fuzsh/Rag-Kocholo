        "text": "Marie Lillian Blanchard Prevost, a native of Bourg and resident of Houma, died of pneumonia in Opelousas during Hurricane Gustave where she had been evacuated at 4:52 p.m. Thursday, Sept. 4, 2008.\n\nMilitary service will be at 9:30 a.m. Thursday at St. Ann Catholic Church in Bourg. Church service will be at 10 a.m. Thursday at the church, with burial in the church cemetery.\n\nShe is survived by one sister, Theresa Naquin; two daughters, Dana Ruthledge and Kallie Bunn; four grandchildren, Dannette Theriot, Christopher Bevill, Katie Bunn and Krista Bunn; and three great-grandchildren, Tabitha Theriot, Christopher Theriot and Tommy Bevill.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her husband, Ruffin Prevost Jr.; her parents, Lincoln Blanchard Sr. and Lena Savoie Blanchard; one brother, Lincoln Blanchard Jr.; two sisters, Maybel Ellender and Velma Domangue; and two grandsons, Ian Theriot and Joshua Bunn.\n\nShe was a very independent young lady throughout her teen years. After she graduated from Terrebonne High School she told her parents she was enlisting in the U.S. Navy because she wanted to serve her country during a great time of need.\n\nOn August 15, 1944, she was sworn into the U.S. Navy in the middle of World War II. She spent two years in the Navy Waves (Women Accepted Volunteer Emergency Service). During that time she served on five Navy War Ships and earned the rank of Seamen 1st Class.\n\nWhen the war was over she fell in love and married a Navy man by the name of Ruffin Prevost Jr., son of Ruffin Prevost Sr. and Lois Ellender Prevost. Shortly there after she was blessed with two lovely daughters and one granddaughter whom she raised from the age of two years old and loved her as her very own.\n\nLillian was a wonderful loving woman and everyone who knew her liked her. She was involved in catholic charities, the Ladies Altar Society, the Veterans Association and the U.S. Navy League.\n\nShe was a very active member in her community and was always willing to lend a hand.\n\nShe is loved by all and will be missed ever so much. She was a blessing to everyone who knew her.\n\nMay God welcome you home Mama with open arms because you served your\n\ncountry and your time here on earth well. I’ll love you always.\n\nSibille Funeral Home in Opelousas is in charge of arrangements."
