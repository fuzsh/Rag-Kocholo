The suspicious judge offers to unite them on the spot, but Jimmy takes him up on it. When he sobers up, he falls in love with her, despite already having a fianc√©e. When his mother finds out, she threatens to have his income cut off (he will not gain control of his fortune for two years). This causes a misunderstanding. Jimmy comes to believe that Mary was interested only in his money when Mary offers to let him out of the marriage, whereas she has really fallen in love with him and merely has his best interests at heart.\n\nEvalyn Knapp as Mary Smith\n\nWalter Byron as Jimmy Martin\n\nMarie Prevost as Nellie Gordon\n\nJason Robards Sr. as Jack Haines\n\nDorothy Christy as Marjorie Reynolds\n\nClarissa Selwynne as Mrs. Martin\n\nPhillips Smalley as Mr. Martin\n\nHerbert Evans as Hodges\n\nRobert Ellis as Brandon\n\nLloyd Ingraham as Judge\n\nMary Foy as Landlady\n\nAl Bridge as Tenant\n\nBobby Burns as Minister\n\nAllan Cavan as Banker\n\nJack Pennick as Sailor\n\nPitts, Michael R.
