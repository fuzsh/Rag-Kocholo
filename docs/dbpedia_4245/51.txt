At the end of April 1945 Walter Pitsch took over the command of his Kompanie after all of its self-propelled 3.7 cm AA guns had been lost. During this time, in which the Kompanie was now employed in the infantry role, the unit managed to thwart an enemy penetration near the Mariazell-Hohenberg (in the Alps). Pitsch, leading at the head of the Kompanie, threw the Soviets back from their gains and held the position thereafter. The retention of this position was of great importance in covering the retreat of the Division, and Pitsch would be recommended for the Knights Cross in recognition of his success here.

Awarded immediately by Supreme Commander of 6. Panzer-Armee (Dietrich), Southeastern Front. Confirmation is not clear.
