A post war original signature on glossy 3×4 photo paper as well as a signature on a letter. The letter is on his personal letter head. the letter is dated 1987 and has some damage in the left upper corner. The letter seems to be a generic type, produced in advance to respond to collectors who wrote him. There are two tabs that held the picture originally on the letter but they no longer function. The letter just says in paraphrase: “i received your request, im including a picture, please use it only for your collection”
