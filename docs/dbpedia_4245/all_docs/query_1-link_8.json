        "text": "WP:ANYBIO says that a person is probably notable if he/she \"has received a well-known and significant award or honor, or has been nominated for one several times\" (emphasis mine). In Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Richard Parks (author), we saw that it isn't exactly clear what this means. Does it have to be the same award, or can he/she be nominated for several awards just once each? And does two nominations count as \"several\"? -- King of ♥ ♦ ♣ ♠\n\nI think the standard, accepted definition of \"several\" is more than two, and I've never seen a requirement that a person need be nominated for more than one, specific award category over time...just that the award be \"well-known and significant\", which is a higher standard than just a notable award category or award ceremony. Guy1890 (talk)\n\nHi, there's an RfC taking part at Talk:Bronze Wolf Award that wishes to understand/decide whether the recipient of a Bronze Wolf award is automatically notable. Could interested editors provide their views please? -- HighKing++\n\nI have spent my time in Draft: namespace making draft articles before any one is accepted or rejected. Even when David Pevsner is accepted to mainspace, after extensive (and exhaustive) editing at Draft:Edward Leung Yiu-ming, Draft:Robert David Sullivan (now deleted per my request due to insufficient sources), and Draft:Trent Kelly (coast guard), I wonder whether I should always follow all of the rules to expand the drafts. Draft:Robert E. Streeter is still pending; regardless, either I may have to lower my temptations to do more drafts, or.... what else can I do? After so much editing, why do those drafts fail to meet this guideline or the main notability guideline? --George Ho (talk)\n\nSee Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Beauty_Pageants#Survey. (((The Quixotic Potato))) (talk)\n\nAs a summary: There has been an ongoing effort to draft a guideline or essay about beauty pageant contestants. There is not consensus for the separate guideline, but has been discussion about adding something to WP:NPEOPLE. A recent draft, pulling the key elements from the guideline draft, is:\n\nBeauty pageant winners\n\nWinners of Big Four pageants.\n\nWinners of the national-level pageants which select participants for the Big Four pageants. Certain independent national-level or supra-national pageants such as Miss America and Miss Europe, by virtue of long establishment and widespread coverage.\n\nJust being winner of these beauty contests, does not guarantee notability, although such people can still be notable if they meet the general primary notability criteria of \"significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject of the article\".\n\nThere are some people that feel that this either is not need due to WP:GNG or that it circumvents GNG.\n\nThanks,—CaroleHenson (talk)\n\nThe consensus is against the proposal above. (((The Quixotic Potato))) (talk)\n\nI do see that there was consensus (in the most recent of many discussions) about not having a separate guideline for beauty pageant winners - and particularly some of the language that is not in this version. I do not see that there was consensus against this proposal. The last I looked, you're the only one that objects to this specific proposal.\n\nI wonder if it's clear that not having a guideline means that there's not a quick and easy way to resolve the many, many articles that get created by state contest winners or contestants in the big contests. And, for those that win major contents, this proposal explicitly states that the articles that are created must meet GNG.\n\nAre you saying that you do not want a quick and easy remedy for the ones that clearly don't meet GNG, nor have won a major contest?—CaroleHenson (talk)\n\nYou wrote: \"I wonder if it's clear that not having a guideline means that there's not a quick and easy way to resolve the many, many articles that get created by state contest winners.\"\n\nWP:GNG is part of Wikipedia:Notability, which is a guideline.\n\nGNG stands for General Notability Guideline.\n\nMy POV is that we do have a quick and easy remedy, we can simply delete every BLP that does not meet GNG (and I think we should). (((The Quixotic Potato))) (talk)\n\nThat is easier said than done. 1) The AfD process requires people to weigh in on the articles, when as you agree there is a shortage of people weighing in on those discussions and often the people that weigh in are the ones that want state contestants and winners to have articles, and 2) in my opinion, this would make it clearer for people working the NewPages Feeds and other new pages so that they could be deleted right after creation without having to go through the time-consuming AfD process. Why is this guideline that still requires GNG and would be of benefit an issue? I would like to hear what others have to say, so I will withhold my comments from this point forward.—CaroleHenson (talk)\n\nHi, just wondering if the guidelines for notability are also applied to lists of famous residents or people in articles on towns, cities, etc.? -Yupik (talk)\n\nI always apply WP:WTAF. Strictly speaking, non-notable entities can be listed in an article but this usually leads to a mess. Chris Troutman (talk)\n\nAlso, every person in such a section should have a reliable source supporting her/his inclusion, especially if the person is living (per WP:BLP). — MShabazz Talk/Stalk\n\nMy personal rule of thumb is that the person should have an article. Exceptions may be made for very small towns where the list is quite short (but in that case you do need to put in a ref) and for very large cities, where even people with articles might be excluded if they're not that notable (although in those cases there's a separate article just for the list, which makes list size less of a problem).\n\nI've never seen this written down -- that having a bluelink is the operative criteria -- but I have seen editors enforce it as a de facto thing, and have done so myself. Herostratus (talk)\n\nThe WP:LISTPEOPLE says 1) meets the Wikipedia notability requirement and 2) membership in the list's group is established by reliable sources. And that there are some lists that may have stricter requirements. AngusWOOF (bark • sniff)\n\nGreat convo about this, thanks! -Yupik (talk)\n\nContext: There's a discussion on whether to split Dylan and Cole Sprouse, twins who have had mostly connected (though not all shared (i.e. playing the same person)) roles. Cole has recently taken on a new television project separate from Dylan, and a film starring Dylan separate from Cole is in some sort of phase of production. I previously opposed (before the discussion got stale for six months) but now am waffling for the moment--at which point the subject of this section popped into my head. (I'm not sure the question will necessarily being integral or not to the discussion at this point (so I guess in some ways, this is a hypothetical more than anything), but it'd be nice to know in case it is relevant going forward.)\n\nThe question: If twins share an article due to being cast mostly in shared/connected roles and/or treated as a unit in reliable sources about those roles and then start taking on separate projects, do the body of work/projects they were in as a unit \"count\" toward the \"significant roles in multiple notable\" works criterion/guideline in determining their notability independent of each other? Or only the projects they've taken on individually/separate from each other? - Purplewowies (talk)\n\nI'm trying to get input from uninvolved editors in this discussion and it has been suggested it my come under the scope of this project. If not any suggestions of more appropriate projects would be welcome. DerbyCountyinNZ (Talk Contribs)\n\nThere is a discussion pertaining to WP:BIO1E at WP:Village pump (policy)#Clarifications about WP:BIO1E/WP:BLP1E and terror attacks. Thanks, ansh666\n\nSee Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Military history#RfC on the notability of flying aces. -- Necrothesp (talk)\n\nPeople are telling me that articles that meet something like WP:ENT must also pass the general notability guideline. If that is the case, I don't see the reasoning for having anything beyond the general notability guideline. SL93 (talk)\n\nThe reason we have profession specific guidelines, is that they are useful in assessing whether the subject would pass WP:GNG, and a strong indication of the result if an in-depth search were made. Passing a profession specific guideline gives the presumption that the subject will pass a GNG test. However, in contentious cases, if it can be shown that GNG gives a different indication than the profession specific guideline, GNG should generally be followed. i.e. if a person fails WP:ENT but passes WP:GNG, then the article should be kept, but if a person passes WP:ENT but fails WP:GNG, then the article should be removed. LK (talk)\n\nThis is incorrect. GNGs and SNGs were originally parallel: one or the other. Then, it became \"I don't care if it fails the SNG, it passes the GNG!\" and then it evolved to \"It must pass BOTH GNG and SNG\" and now to \"SNGs only exist to sort of gauge whether a topic will pass GNG or not\". Not to fault Lawrencekhoo for getting it wrong, but things have evolved rather fluidly over Wikipedia's history. Jclemens (talk)\n\nYes, and the guidelines themselves are a dog's breakfeast of contradictions. WP:N itself says in the lede \"A topic is presumed to merit an article if... 1)It meets either the general notability guideline below, or the criteria outlined in a subject-specific guideline listed in the box on the right\" (the box on the right is NSPORTS and NPROF and NBOOK and all the rest). WP:SPORTS says in bold at the beginning \"The article must provide reliable sources showing that the subject meets the general notability guideline or the sport specific criteria set forth below.\" And so on.\n\nBut there are plenty of places to look if you want quotes that say the opposite. The fact is, these pages were cobbled together over the years, and none of them are supposed to be pored over like scriptures or parsed like laws, trying to figure out what some long-retired editor meant ten years ago when she wrote \"may\" instead of \"can\" in some rule.\n\nJust do what you think is best for the project.\n\nIMO there's a sea change of people starting to consider GNG on more absolute terms, as if it was a core policy that must be followed, like it or not, even if it means a bad outcome. I'm not a big fan of this, but neither am I sure it's a bad thing. Who knows? Herostratus (talk)\n\nWith apologies to Churchill, The GNG is the worst possible way to determine whether verifiable topics should have their own articles... except for all the others that have been tried. It's a blunt tool, not fit for nuanced work, but there's nothing better out there, any any attempt at revision would open the mother of all cans of worms. Jclemens (talk)\n\nWell, it's certainly a good starting point, and a reasonable guideline. I was just looking at fungi. Austropeltum has two references: One is an article in Botanica Acta, one is (probably) a short bare description in Dictionary of the Fungi. There may literally be no other sources. Only the Botanica Acta source is \"in depth\", so GNG's \"multiple\" sources is not satisfied. And it's a primary source, so it's no good anyway for establishing notability. And Botanica Acta doesn't even have an article here, so it's extremely obscure, more obscure than a local paper like the Lowell Sun. It is probably read by many fewer people that Popteen or whatever. Not one newspaper, even a local one, has apparently deigned to write even a short article, even a paragraph in an article, about Austropeltum.\n\nThere's really no way this article meets WP:GNG. Should it be deleted? Herostratus (talk)\n\nI have always looked at it as \"GNG and/or SNG\", but it's true that you see people insisting on GNG at all times more often these days. I remember something about ensuring that coverage of certain topics was \"complete\" (i.e. all historical members of a legislature, all described species), but can't seem to see that anywhere. On the specific case, I can't seem to see an SNG for taxonomy, which seems odd. There are some suggestions on WP:TOL, but I wouldn't expect an article for an entire (valid) genus to be deleted no matter how scarce the sources. It's a bit of an WP:IAR situation (and that's something you don't see as much anymore too).\n\nMy suspicion is that the hostility towards SNGs comes down to a long-standing issue: that they almost always seem overly inclusive to people who don't edit in that subject area. Running my eye down WP:ATHLETE, for example, I can scarcely believe how lenient it seems, and yet I'm sure WP:POLITICIAN seems the same way to non-politics editors whereas to me it seems quite strict. The whole concept also appears to be under quite significant discussion in the RfC linked in the section below. Frickeg (talk)\n\nActually Herostratus that is a misreading of NSPORT. What that sentence is intending is that if you are going to claim something meets NSPORTS you need a source showing they meet that criteria. If you read further in that section it actually indicates that GNG trumps NSPORT and that if its called into question that GNG might not actually be met that it can be deleted. NSPORTS actually has an FAQ to stop people from assuming that NSPORTS is equivalent to GNG. Its a common misconception. SNGs are only meant as a reprieve until such time as someone can go and get the sources that almost guaranteed exist in places like newspaper archives etc. -DJSasso (talk)\n\nEveryone has their own preferred fields of interest, and we can only make a cooperative encyclopedia by tolerating each other. That's essentially why I tend to be an inclusionist: simple mutual tolerance. . When I came , I was under the delusion that the GNG was the great equalizer, butI learned it is just the opposite. It favors to a degree that verges on insanity those subjects covered extensively in popular media. We avoid looking really stupid in both directions by simply interpreting the GNG to fit the circumstances. The obvious short term way out of the current sophistry and quibbling at AfD is subject specific guidelines. (We don't have them, because everyone is afraid their own topic would be short-canged, while in the current situation if they are clever enough in constructing the right kind of arguments, and only their friends show up, at least a random selection of what they like will get into WP)\n\nBut more generally, WP suffers from the google-influence: subjects rank high there only if they are in article titles. This has in practice discouraged the more widespread construction of combination articles. DGG ( talk )\n\nThere is another way that we could take to deal with the systematic bias some topic areas get compared to others, and that is the fact there is nothing that prevents Wikiprojects or other pages to restrict when standalone articles can be created on some topics. That is, if we known a certain topic area has exceedingly wide coverage but where a point that there is a potential that much of that coverage is routine or not unexpected, there is nothing that says we can't have an SNG be more strict than a GNG. The GNG is a necessary condition to have a standalone article but it does not require one. But for this to work, there needs to be vast agreement across other related topic areas that these limits are reasonably balanced to have roughly \"equal\" requirements for all topic ares related to that. (Case in point is that there would need to be alot of agrument how to scale back NSPORTS to make other professions appear more balanced, but that's a long uphill battle). The GNG works to at least define a minimum amount of coverage for topics that aren't regularly well covered but it does not realistically handle when one can trip over references left and right, and instead becomes more of how we avoid IINFO and other factors of WP:NOT. --MASEM (t)\n\nRegarding WP:REDLINK, there is an RfC about red links for persons. Editors are invited to comment here. Erik (talk | contrib) (ping me)\n\nOpinions are needed on the following matter: Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Lead section#Request for comment on parenthetical information in first sentence. A WP:Permalink for it is here. Flyer22 Reborn (talk)\n\nAs a rule of thumb, exactly which awards are considered to be \"well-known and significant industry award[s]\" for the purposes of meeting WP:PORNBIO? - GretLomborg (talk)\n\nMy wild guess... does the award have it's own Wikipedia page? Ie Wikinotable. Legacypac (talk)\n\nWhat I got from the above discussion was that was explicitly not the case. The impression I got from that is that there is a pretty strong consensus that the valid awards are a pretty small set containing AVN, XBIZ, and maybe one or two others. - GretLomborg (talk)\n\nNot an area I spend any time in. Sorry I threw out a suggestion that proved wrong. Porn bios suck, and if I were you I'd find something else less controversial and icky to work with. I wrote large portions of ISIL and created several associated pages. Much less toxic topic overall. Legacypac (talk)\n\nIn order to meet the PORNBIO inclusion criteria, a subject must have won an adult film industry award from an award ceremony that is \"well-known\" (it at least has to have its own Wikipedia page describing the award ceremony) within that industry and is also in a \"significant\" (or major) award category. Not all adult film industry award ceremonies (or award categories within those ceremonies) meet the PORNBIO criteria. Guy1890 (talk)\n\nWP:CREATIVE tells us that sufficient (though unnecessary) evidence of notability for \"Authors, editors, journalists, filmmakers, photographers, artists, architects, and other creative professionals\" is that\n\nThe person's work (or works) . . . is represented within the permanent collections of several notable galleries or museums.\n\nIn a current AfD discussion, an editor says that in the above\n\n\"represented\" doesn't mean \"sitting in a basement drawer.\" I'm saying that it means \"on display.\"\n\nComments? -- Hoary (talk)\n\nThe quoted editor went on to say \"Obviously pieces get rotated in and out, and obviously notability is not temporary ...\" From the conversation, the editor does seem to understand that very few museums actually display all of their collection all of the time.\n\nFor an object, the point seems reasonable: to be notable, the person's work should have been displayed at some time; presumably display on the web would be sufficient, not necessarily physical display. But WP:CREATIVE is also about authors, economists, etc.; for galleries or museums, substitute libraries; is it required that an author's work has been on display, or is \"sitting on a shelf\" sufficient? — Stanning (talk)\n\nI do not think WP:CREATIVE's wording should be extended here. It says galleries or museums, not libraries, which is good because many major libraries aim for completeness rather than judging their collections on significance - being on display in a significant art gallery is not really equivalent to sitting on the shelf of a vast reading room. Being represented in a really huge library's collection (the Library of Congress or really any major national library) is not a particularly helpful indicator of notability. Libraries of course don't do \"display\" of books or things quite so much, and in any case anything that they did display would certainly fly through other notability criteria without needing to turn to this one. Frickeg (talk)\n\nLet's put aside economists and other authors for now, and concentrate on photographers and perhaps other visual artists. In particular, photographic portraitists. The art world seems to have been radically changed in recent decades by (often international) exhibitions. If museum X has a portrait of the rather obscure figure P done by the rather obscure photographer Q and isn't known to have exhibited it but verifiably did lend it out for exhibition at museum Y, then which of the following is (are) true?\n\n1. Possession of a print by X counts toward the notability of P.\n\n2. Possession of a print by X counts toward the notability of Q.\n\n3. Exhibition of a print by Y counts toward the notability of P.\n\n4. Exhibition of a print by Y counts toward the notability of Q.\n\nFor the question of notability of P versus notability of Q, we might look at the titles of (imagined) exhibitions. \"Wet Collodion Portraitists\": it's Q. \"Early Atlanta\": it's probably P, but even in material about historical worthies (and not primarily about the photographs or photographers thereof) one often sees such phrasing as \"this remarkably skillful portrait\", suggesting notability of Q. If \"be represented\" is taken to mean \"be exhibited (at least from time to time)\", then I think questions like this are likely to come up, as well as complaints along the lines of \"You mean, as far as you know it was only exhibited for one week?\" -- Hoary (talk)\n\nNotability in Wikipedia does not operate on the principles of deductive, analytical logic. It's entirely inductive, as far as I can see. It's all based on repetitive instances of recognition in the press (or galleries and collections in this case), leading to an inductive conclusion that is more or less \"yes, they look notable\". If it was based on deductive logic we would not need to discuss things much. 104.163.142.4 (talk)\n\nInclusion in a permanent collection is a decision by a curator that is very analogous to the decisions made by print or news editors. Curators of major museums are highly educated individuals, and in line with WP:NOR, we defer to their judgement to establish notability. Represented in this case refers only to being included in the collection. To suggest that it has to be displayed is, a position that is ignorant of the permanent collection process. Here's an L.A. Times article that discusses the new Broad Museum in Los Angeles. It has a special staircase area where you can peer into the permanent collection that is stored between the floors. As the article (and, for god's sake, about thousand other extant sources) say(s), \"At nearly all museums, the treasures on public display are but a small fraction of the riches within. Gallery space being limited, priceless paintings and rare sculptures are consigned to basements or off-site storage much of the time.\" Once you understand that this is the case in every permanent collection in the world, you understand that this discussion about the difference between represented and included is a silly in the extreme. To extend this silliness, museums do not generally make available the database of a the exhibitions or of a painting or sculpture since it has been in the collection. Thus, if you really want to say if something is notable only if in the collection and exhibited, there is not going to be an effective, reliable and easy way to find this out.104.163.142.4 (talk)\n\nA few examples:\n\n-The collection \"is only a mere fraction of its total holdings; most works sit in storage or reside offsite in a traveling exhibition\"[1]\n\n-\"It is simply not possible to display more than a fraction of our collections within the space allotted to this Department:[2]\n\n-\"But while the piece is now part of the permanent collection, it remains in storage.\"[3]\n\n-\"The largest museums typically display about 5% of their collection at any time.\"\n\n-\"In major museums around the world, some truly great works of art are hidden away from public view. What are they – and why can’t we see them?\"\n\n-\"“Most museums show between 2 and 4 percent of a collection,” Ms. Davis said.\"\n\n-\"Roughly 80,000 objects are on public display at the British Museum in Bloomsbury at any one time. This is 1% of the collection...\" 104.163.142.4 (talk)\n\nI have never proposed any article for deletion. I was just preparing to set in motion my very first AfD nomination, but in the end held back. The article in question is Christian Guzman. I think he fails the notability criterion of \"significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject of the article\"; I can't find information on him in mainstream media or in books, but he is all over the place on YouTube, Instagram and similar sites. He has 740,000 subscribers to the former and nearly a million followers at the latter. Bodybuilding.com has an interview with him, but I doubt they are a reliable source, and I wonder how they choose their interviewees. He has started a company but it does not seem to pass the notability criteria either. However, I wonder whether his large following on YouTube, Instagram etc. means that he has achieved notability by public consent, a people's icon so to speak. What do you think? Cwmhiraeth (talk)\n\nPlease see the following discussion: WP:VPPOL#RfC: Should \"Sir\" and \"Dame\" be treated as pre-nominals? –Sb2001 talk page\n\nBackground\n\nI've recently went through the experience of nominating several articles for AfD, which resulted in interesting discussions, with the possibility that an RfC may be recommended to deal with this issue on a global basis:\n\nNominations of articles on Knight's Cross recipients for deletion -- discussion with an editor who opposed the nominations\n\nKC holder suggested RfC -- discussion with an editor who suggested the RfC idea\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Walter Gerth -- AfD created by another editor\n\nThe issue appears to be complex, so I would appreciate further input from the community, as there are over 3,000 articles on Knight's Cross holders, and a substantial amount of them fail GNG. Clarification: The award can indeed by verified, but no other RS coverage appears to be available.\n\nSample articles:\n\nCreated by editor DocYakoo: Hans Stern (SS officer) -- with Wikipedia:WikiProject_Spam/LinkReports/ritterkreuztraeger-1939-45.de and not much else. Gerhard Fischer (soldier); Johannes Kümmel; Alfred Montag; Hermann Lang (Wehrmacht officer); Gerlach von Gaudecker-Zuch; Otto Barth; Wilhelm Weber (SS officer); Ernst Philipp; Eckart Afheldt; Wilhelm Walther; Clemens-Heinrich Graf von Kageneck; Hans-Jürgen Burmester; Heinrich Krafft; Felix Adamowitsch; Paul Audorff\n\nCreated by editor Jim Sweeney: Friedrich Holzer -- non-RS websites; Kurowski; etc. Günther Degen; Lino Masarie; Otto Paetsch; Ernst Stäudle; Ernst Häußler; Otto Schneider (SS officer); Heinrich Debus (SS officer); Alfred Großrock; Berndt Lubich von Milovan; Hans Endreß; Erwin Bachmann; Adolf Pittschellis; Hans Hirning; Johann Fiedler; Karl Nicolussi-Leck; Walter Girg; Miervaldis Ādamsons\n\nI reached out to both, but did not hear back, except from DocYakoo on an AfD: response\n\nThe results of the AfDs were mixed, but some good discussion points within:\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Peter Arent -- Result was delete\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Alois Kalss -- Result was delete\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Paul Senghas -- Result was delete\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hans Weiss -- Result was redirect to List of Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recipients (W)\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Helmut Wendorff -- Result was delete\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Georg Schönberger -- Result was redirect to List of Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recipients (Sa–Schr)\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hermann Lang (SS officer) -- Result was delete and redirect to List of Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recipients (L)\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Heinrich Kling -- Result was keep\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Fritz Amling -- Result was no consensus\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Alfredo Carpaneto -- Result was no consensus\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hans-Babo von Rohr -- Result was no consensus\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Rudolf Roy -- Result was no consensus\n\nHere are some points that would be relevant:\n\nWP:Soldier states that \"In general, an individual is presumed to be notable if they have received significant coverage in multiple verifiable independent, reliable sources. In particular, individuals will almost always have sufficient coverage to qualify if they: Were awarded their nation's highest award for valour.\"\n\nWP:LISTPEOPLE states: A person is typically included in a list of people only if all the following requirements are met:\n\nThe person meets the Wikipedia notability requirement.\n\nThe person's membership in the list's group is established by reliable sources.\n\nMore policies are discussed on this link: KC holder suggested RfC\n\nI would really appreciate some help in framing the discussion and formulating an RfC if needed. K.e.coffman (talk)\n\nDiscussion\n\nWP:SOLDIER also says \"Were awarded their nation's highest award for valour\". Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross meets the criteria, so all awardees are presumed notable. GNG should not matter in these cases. Chris Troutman (talk)\n\nComment: Yes, I am aware of WP:Soldier; it states that \"In general, an individual is presumed to be notable if they have received significant coverage in multiple verifiable independent, reliable sources. In particular, individuals will almost always have sufficient coverage to qualify if they: Were awarded their nation's highest award for valour.\" -- the notability is presumed, it's not guaranteed. WP:Soldier does not trump GNG, as I understand it, and \"significant coverage in reliable sources\" still matters.\n\nThe RS for these subjects do not appear to exist; some of the articles that were part of my AfDs came from the list of the article Panzer aces, and the coverage for them was indeed available, but in the non-RS Wehrmacht/Waffen-SS romancer literature, such as by Franz Kurowski or Gordon Williamson (writer). Please see Waffen-SS in popular culture for other similar writers.\n\nThe coverage (whether RS or not) does not appear to exist at all for the articles in the Sample list. The articles that I've listed above were created in 2008 (Jim Sweeny) and 2012 (DocYaco) and have not been enhanced since. K.e.coffman (talk)\n\nYou state that coverage does not appear to exist for these articles. However, this medal was only awarded between 1939 and 1945, I think, so most contemporary sources would likely be published by Nazi newspapers and publishers in German. Most of these are unlikely to be on-line and translated to English. When you say that there are no reliable sources, have you made a serious attempt to find off-line German language sources? If not, I believe that we should presume such sources likely exist. (Note that WP:V still applies - the medal must be verifiable, and if there's insufficient info to write an article, redirect to a list is certainly acceptable.) Pburka (talk)\n\nThe only RS source in the articles is the one that verifies that the award was indeed bestowed. That is not in dispute. But this does not amount to \"significant coverage\" since each recipient only gets a line in the source. Please see: sample from Fellgiebel.\n\n\"Off-line German language sources\" are not available to me -- both physically and linguistically. I assume that would be true for most English wiki editors. Contemporaneous sources published between 1939 and 1945 would be highly unreliable, having been produced under the totalitarian regime. I expect they would not be of any use, unless covered by reliable secondary sources as part of WWII historiography. K.e.coffman (talk)\n\nContemporaneous sources are extremely reliable. German sources are fine, per WP:NONENG. Hawkeye7 (talk)\n\nI'm not following -- how would 1939-45 sources be reliable? We don't use them for example to source articles on WWII battles. Also to clarify, I'm not arguing against German language sources; my point is that none have been added in eight years, so it's unrealistic to expect that they would be in foreseeable future. K.e.coffman (talk)\n\nThe point about \"presumed notability\" is that certain things cause a subject to be of sufficient interest to the general public that there will be significant coverage, and sufficient sources to write an article will almost certainly exist. WP:SOLDIER does not trump WP:GNG; it merely says that experience has shown that WP:GNG will be met. Now, for example, in The class the stars fell on, the class itself is notable, although not all West Point classes are, and all the generals in the class are presumed notable under WP:SOLDIER and are therefore included in the list under WP:LISTPEOPLE. (To test this, we selected two at random, and were easily able to create articles on them.) Hawkeye7 (talk)\n\nIt appears that an award of a single Knight's Cross does not \"cause a subject to be of sufficient interest to the general public that there will be significant coverage\", as the AfDs above demonstrated. Even though some articles survived the AfD process, no RS citations have been added to any of the articles. This tells me that either (a) RS sources do not exist on these subjects; (b) there's no interest in the Wiki community to search for and add them; or (c) both. Perhaps WP:Soldier needs to be adjusted? My experience with these articles demonstrated that it's much more likely to see coverage for a divisional commander in the German army, rather than a person who had been awarded a Knight's Cross, and even the higher grade, the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves.\n\nAs I mentioned, most of these articles came off the list of German \"panzer aces\", in which there continues to be an interest. For example, please see this copyvio revert from today in Kurt Knispel, who is supposed to be the top scoring \"tank ace\" of all times, but even for him, significant RS coverage does not appear to exist.\n\nAs an aside, here's the Panzer ace article before I and others edited it: Nov 2015 version. It appears to have been sourced to the ubiquitous Franz Kurowski, as his work was the only one listed in References: * Kurowski, Franz (2004). Panzer Aces: German Tank Commanders in World War II. Verlag Stackpole Books. ISBN 978-0-8117-3173-7 K.e.coffman (talk)\n\nPer WP:IMPATIENT: Sometimes an article is nominated for deletion that is not being worked on very much, or has not been edited by a person for a long time, and thus might not be in very good shape. This does not necessarily mean that the topic is unsuitable for Wikipedia; it may be that the topic is obscure or difficult to write about. An article should be assessed based on whether it has a realistic potential for expansion, not how frequently it has been edited to date. Remember that there is no deadline. The article shouldn't be deleted for its current status only because no one has improved it yet. Such deletion would prevent editors from improving it in the future. Hawkeye7 (talk)\n\nIt has been eight years for some of these articles, so it's a fair assumption that no sources would be forthcoming in the future. I follow a different philosophy that there is indeed a deadline: WP:NOW -- why not correct the problem now? These articles have been tagged refimprove since as early as 2009. I made a similar comment to editor PeaceMaker (who objected to my nominations): \"My involvement with these articles has been on-going since I came across them via the German panzer aces list. I've taken several passes at the articles to remove dubious, unsourced and unreliably sourced material, and I've not seen attempts from other editors to improve the articles. This suggests to me that the wikipedia community is not overly concerned about having these articles as part of its body of knowledge.\" (talk)\n\nHere is an example of an article for an airman who had two aerial victories and never received a high award for valour: Graham Leggett. The article references two non-RS websites; I chose it randomly from a list of Battle of Britain pilots. I doubt anyone would nominate that article for deletion. The argument here is that Germans are more likely to be included in Wikipedia despite a lack of reliable sources. But \"reliable source\" does not mean \"infallible source,\" and a person does not become non-notable because they are only mentioned in potentially unreliable sources. That is, the source could be wrong on minor details, but that doesn't mean the person didn't exist or wasn't awarded a Knight's Cross. Unlike \"fancruft\", which is about fictional works, these articles are about real people, and it would be a disservice to Wikipedia if they were deleted.Roches (talk)\n\nIt absolutely does matter. Articles require reliable sources, that is, those which are editorially controlled and fact checked. Any article for which substantial reliable referencing doesn't exist (note, this doesn't mean the sources must be currently cited, just that they must be out there) should be deleted or merged to a parent article. Interest doesn't matter, \"It's a...\" doesn't matter. SNGs are useful guides as to when substantial sourcing is likely to exist, but it still must, in every individual case, in fact exist. If it turns out an SNG covers a lot of cases where substantial reliable references don't exist, the SNG is erroneous and should be adjusted or removed. Seraphimblade Talk to me\n\nNot so, not in the least. You're imaging the GNG to be policy, whereas its a guideline that says right at the top that it is not the only possible criterion. The GNG is just a guideline, and we can have other guidelines also. The relationship between the GNG and the SNGs can be whatever we decide by consensus. The clearest two examples are the rules for natural geographic features, where above a certain level if we have more than just a name on a map, they are always notable, and WP:PROF, which explicitly and by firm consensus states that it is alternative to the GNG. Similarly, we include early players in the Olympics on such as basis. We make the rules. We are not constrained to follow the GNG unless we have consensus to do so--this consensus cannot be assumed. There is no higher body handing down the rules to us , and just letting us tinker with the details. We have made every guideline here by consensus, and it means what it is take to mean by the community, as shown in the case of notability , by practice at afds.\n\nI think its firmly established that the highest award for valour is always notable, as long as we have a RS for the award to meet WP:V,Decisions in the other direction are aberrant--there is always a certain amount of error--, and the thing to do is to rewrite the articles.\n\nAlternatively, it can be viewed as a compromise: we have had considerable trouble on holding the line for people whose notability is a n award lower than the highest, and since in this case there's a firmly defined line, it makes for a good compromise. Personally, I thing the highest award guideline is sometimes a little less than ideal, for example with some early holder of the VC and the Medal of Honor, and it might well be for other countries also (I have the Soviet Union in mind, much more than Germany). But it is still better to have the compromise and devote our time to writing better articles, not worrying about just which ones to accept. Too many AfDs end up with a detailed examination of sources--and depending on how we want to interpret the wording in the GNG, can in any borderline or ambiguous case give whichever result one wants. Far better to have a predictable guideline in fields where one can be established. DGG ( talk )\n\nThe French Legion of Honour has been awarded about 1 million times since its creation (by Napoleon) - and has currently about 95000 living members. Following the argument by User:DGG above all those million should be considered inherently notable and their articles if ever created should not be deleted. I think this is seriously problematic. Arnoutf (talk)\n\nThe French Legion of Honor is an award with multiple levels. Only the highest level counts. (and most of these are civilian, not military awards) For military valour, according to our article, the highest award in the Légion d'honneur rule à titre militaire) is awarded jointly with a Mention in Dispatches. \"It is rarely awarded, mainly to soldiers who have died in battle.\" This indicates the importance of what I said earlier, that we need to discriminate and count only the very highest level. (I cannot find a count, but the 2nd highest honour, has been awarded only 1061 times. DGG ( talk )\n\nArnoutf I agree with DGG. My understanding is that, in order to be considered to have been awarded to military personnel for bravery/valour, the French Legion of Honour must be awarded concurrently with a mention in dispatches. That would drastically reduce the number who would meet SOLDIER, assuming that the figure of 1 million is even accurate (while we don't use WP as a source, the current article for the Legion of Honour mentions less than 100K awards, not 1 million...). From that figure, all of the awards to French and non-French civilians can be discounted, as can those to French military personnel for long service. Raw figures of this type distort things considerably, and are almost useless in this discussion. Cheers, Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nMinor comment. If you read the text of the article, there is indeed a limit of 100K Legion of Honour awardees - at any moment in time - which means that no more than that number of awardees can be alive at any moment. If you read a bit further and in other sources you will find that right now there are about 95K living awardees of the LH. So the numbering is a bit off. Arnoutf (talk)\n\nAs was discussed elsewhere in the thread, the KC was awarded for other things besides valour, so only those who received the award for valour would qualify under SOLDIER1. But it's not discernable from readily available sources which recipients got it for valour and which for distinguished service. Nazi Germany itself did not make the distinction apparent. Hence the dilemma: more than KCs 7000 were awarded, resulting in the award being much more common than, for example, MoH or VC, which were awards only for valour. K.e.coffman (talk)\n\nIsn't the whole point of a presumption of notability that it is up to those claiming non-notability to prove their case? The whole point of the rule is that there are probably reliable sources, but that they may not exist online at the moment. The question then becomes: is this true for this particular award? Should the whole guideline be refined a bit more? john k (talk)\n\nPart 2\n\nThere are a few issues to deal with here. One, there are several classes of this award, and the actual \"highest class\" only ever had one recipient - Adolf Hitler. Therefore, there is an argument that could be made that no one else ever received \"the highest award\" and thus cannot meet GNG by receiving it. Two, according to the KC article, there were 7,161 awards of this decoration in six years. That's four times as many in that period as there have ever been for the VC, and twice as many as there have ever been for the US MOH. Those awards are also not multi-classed; the \"lower class\" is a totally different award that does not confer GNG via reception. So I think that the class of the award as well as the rarity of presentation certainly needs to be taken into consideration for determining notability. Recipients of the KC often have no other sourcing for them other than their KC citation, which is not saying much when we compare it to the sources we have on VC/MOH recipients. Therefore, there's a preponderance of evidence that indicates that it doesn't seem to be prestigious enough to merit inclusion based solely on receiving it. MSJapan (talk)\n\nPerhaps WP:Soldier should be adjusted specific to the Knight's Cross? I do not see that \"experience has shown that WP:GNG will be met\". As the AfDs have demonstrated, \"significant coverage\" on these subjects appears not to exist, or it has not made itself apparent in eight years.\n\nThen the question may become:\n\nDoes the award of a single Ritterkreuz in any way meet the bar for WP:SOLDER#1 and/or WP:ANYBIO#1? If not, is the Ritterkreuz with Oak Leaves (ie: second award ~860 recipients) sufficient?\n\nK.e.coffman (talk)\n\nI have suggested elsewhere that SOLDIER should be adjusted (or a note made) regarding the Knight's Cross because of the confusion it causes. First though, I disagree at a philosophical level with the deletion of many these articles, despite the claim that they do not meet GNG. The only way to determine that would be to conduct a search of off-line sources in German. Contemporary and later accounts in newspapers, for example (including obituaries), may well hold sufficient information to justify these articles under GNG. But we have a serious systemic bias towards English language sources on en WP, and many would not know how to locate such sources in German. A similar situation would apply to Heroes of the Soviet Union or recipients of the Yugoslav Order of the People's Hero. A Google Books search is a very blunt instrument, especially for subjects whose mother tongue was not English. Secondly, the Knight's Cross was awarded for several things, including for valour, for military leadership, and for reaching a certain number of kills for fighter aces and submarine captains etc. A lot of colonels and generals were awarded it for leadership, rarely for valour. Only Knight's Crosses or higher levels of the award awarded for valour would meet SOLDIER, and that is a small subset of the total. Thirdly, the Knight's Cross was the highest award available to a soldier who did not already have one. You could not be awarded the Oak Leaves without being awarded the Knight's Cross for an earlier separate action, and so on. There was no way of being awarded the Diamonds for a single action unless you had already been awarded all the lower levels for separate actions. So, despite claims that only Diamonds recipients are \"really\" the highest level, that just is not the case. If a soldier was awarded the Diamonds and all the previous levels for valour in each case, that would mean that they had been awarded the highest award for valour available to them on multiple occasions. Cheers, Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nShould this work (locating sources) has been done prior to creating an article though? WP:Notability states: \"If a topic has received significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject, it is presumed to be suitable for a stand-alone article or list. \"Significant coverage\" addresses the topic directly and in detail, so that no original research is needed to extract the content. Significant coverage is more than a trivial mention, but it does not need to be the main topic of the source material.\" It looks to me that a mention in Fellgiebel (please see sample above) is a \"trivial mention\".\n\nI've left messages for the two editors who created the bulk of the articles under discussion, and they have not responded, even though editor DocYako has edited today. There are probably hundreds of these articles, for example, those included in this List of Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross recipients of the Waffen-SS. So this is a systemic issue which was created by mostly two editors. I do not know their motivation. K.e.coffman (talk)\n\nNot necessarily. I don't know when they were created or by whom, or what policies or guidelines existed when they did that. Things on en WP change over time, policies have been adjusted, guidelines written and essays like SOLDIER developed and tweaked. SOLDIER makes presumptions about military people that are likely to be notable, and it doesn't trump GNG. That doesn't mean you have to run down all these articles and PROD them either. Where the award was for valour, I would be giving the subjects of these articles the benefit of the doubt. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nHow would one know whether the KC was given for \"valour\" (\"extreme battlefield bravery\") vs \"successful military leadership\"? K.e.coffman (talk)\n\nI expect there was a citation which explained the award, and the lower the rank, the less likely it was awarded for anything other than valour. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nThis is clearly contentious, so neither automatically keeping nor automatically deleting these articles seems appropriate. The award of such a top medal ought to be a factor contributing notability, but needs to be corroborated by sources detailing the heroism or other notable deeds of the medal holder. Before requesting WP:AFD, the article creator and other significant contributors ought to be invited to provide additional evidence of notability if needed and text should not be unilaterally deleted, but discussed at the talk page if felt to be dubious. So I propose we slow down the process of deletionism and anti-deletionism and all those involved should seek to improve the articles if they can be improved. If the article appears on de.wiki, I'm happy to contribute by translating the additional information if that helps. Cheers all. Bermicourt (talk)\n\nI agree with MSJapan's point that a distinction needs to be made so that the Nazi regime award winners are not all given webpages. The fact that a totalitarian state handed out 4 top award medals every day to their soldiers shouldn't surprise anyone but Wikipedia is not a directory or an index so that it shouldn't be controversial not to include this. That said, some of these people clearly are notable and I think the only way to proceed is to go on a case by case basis. Bermicourt's suggestion that we \"slow down the process of [deleting]\" these articles is not correct either. There is clearly a problem here and doing nothing or deliberating slowing down an already very slow process is not going to help improve Wikipedia.Monopoly31121993 (talk)\n\nI wasn't suggesting slowing down the whole process of sorting this out, if the proper validation of articles can be speeded up - great! What I was cautioning against was a hasty deletion of articles without any proper research on the assumption that none are notable. --Bermicourt (talk)\n\nThat would be great, if we could simultaneously slow down the hasty creation of articles before finding the references that would be necessary to sustain one, and verifying that there is in fact enough of it to write a full article. Seraphimblade Talk to me\n\nI'd like to suggest that this may be a false dilemma. If the Knight's Cross was not the highest decoration, then there would be no no presumption of notability. I suggest that the establishment of additional levels of the award was essentially the establishment of new and higher awards. There could be two possible ways to break the horns of the dilemma. The first would be to recognize recipients of the Knight's Cross prior to the establishment of the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, then the recipients of the new, higher award until the Knight's Cross with Swords was established, an so on. The alternative would be to establish another level as the \"highest\" level. The number of awards at the oak leaves level would appear roughly equivalent to the equivalent awards. I prefer the first as it recognizes that the standards for awards of decorations change over time. --Lineagegeek (talk)\n\nThat just isn't correct. See my explanation of the Knight's Cross above. Cheers, Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nAlois Kalss existed and was awarded a Knight's Cross. There are photos of him at the Axis History Forum. I suppose those are primary sources and unreliable, but they're photos of a person with a Knight's Cross, and the \"extract from his recommendation\" describes his role in the fighting at Hill 112 on 11 July 1944. There are few wartime German newspapers available in digitized form, but the Leipziger Neueste Nachtrichten is available, along with some others. Every day, the new recipients of the Knight's Cross (Neue Ritterkreuzträger) are listed on the first or second page. Recipients of the Oak Leaves are almost always front-page news (Neuer Eichenlaubträger...). The LNN gives at least this much information:\n\n\"New Oak Leaf Bearer in the Waffen-SS: The Führer has given the Oak Leaves of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross to SS-Obersturmbannführer Karl ULLRICH, commander of the SS-Panzer-Grenadier Regiment \"Theodor Eicke\" in the SS-Panzer Division \"Totenkopf\", as the 480th Soldier of the German Wehrmacht.\"\n\n\"New Iron Cross Holders: The Führer has given the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross to Major Heinrich IBUERMANN, commander of a Frankish armored engineer battalion, born on 6 September 1907 in Reppen...\"</quote>\n\nThis is from the second page of the LNN for June 7, 1944. What I mean to achieve by stating the above is that, most likely, most German newspapers printed lists of new Knight's Cross recipients. The most reliable sources just happened to be undigitized, unsearchable and in Fraktur. Roches (talk)\n\nComment. Note that accepting Knight's Cross holders as inherently notable actually creates a lower standard of notability for German soldiers than for British or American soldiers, since the Knight's Cross was often awarded for actions that would have resulted in a second-level decoration in Britain or the USA as opposed to the Victoria Cross or Medal of Honor (if you read the circumstances, many of these men would have clearly received a DSO or DCM in Britain, not a VC - the ubiquitous Knight's Cross received by so many U-boat captains being a perfect case in point). That's why so many more were awarded. This is the problem with regarding recipients of a country's \"highest\" decoration as inherently notable; it favours countries that do not have a defined three-level decoration system as Britain, the Commonwealth and the USA do. Most countries, in fact, do not (hence the debate we have had as to whether the Legion d'honneur is France's highest decoration; it is and it isn't!). -- Necrothesp (talk)\n\nYes, the Knight's Cross was awarded for things other than valour, and in many of those cases the equivalent award in the British system would have been the DFC or DSO, but those awarded the Knight's Cross for valour are necessarily a subset of the total. It doesn't create a \"lower standard\", it is just more nuanced than the British or US systems, which had one level of one award, which was for valour only. What is needed is a closer examination of the individual award to determine if it was for valour (and therefore relevant for WP:SOLDIER). I'm all for reconsidering the notability of some Knight's Cross recipients who appear to have been awarded the Knight's Cross for \"successful leadership\" or on another basis more akin to a DSO or CBE. What we risk doing here is creating a systemic bias in which every lower ranking member of the German armed forces who received the Knight's Cross is given less benefit of the doubt than their equivalent in other systems. Some sort of \"victor's justice\" when it comes to awards, especially when you take into account the destruction of records and newspapers etc in Germany during the war. As a function of their rank, it is those of lower ranks who are much more likely to have received the Knight's Cross for valour, yet some of the discussion here would skew the system against them significantly. Cheers, Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nThey're fundamentally different awards. The British and US awards were for valor above and beyond the call of duty. In essence, the Knight's Cross (RK) was very often an award for successful fulfillment of duties. It also had prerequisite rewards (both grades of Iron Cross, EK1 and EK2), which the US and British awards did not. Sometimes the awards were concurrent, as for Gustav Altmann who received the award for capturing Fort Eben-Emael in May 1940. The difference in the awards might be illustrated by the Medal of Honor awarded for D-Day; the American command decided only one would be given for actions that day, and it was given to Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., who personally led troops on the beaches, not to Eisenhower.\n\nThe Germans did not make a distinction, at all, as to what the RK was given for. It was the highest award for military service, period. The newspaper accounts don't seem to say much about new RKs or new Oak Leaves, just names and dates and places of birth. The articles on the Swords (I haven't found one on Diamonds yet) are longer. There seems to have been a journalistic standard that stories about the Swords and possibly the Oak Leaves were front-page news no matter what, because the June 6, 1944 papers include a story about that. The Knight's Cross was front-page news on D-Day. Likewise this paper from July 22, 1944, the first after the July 20 plot, mentions Swords on the front page and new RKs on the second. Note that per WP:GNG the fact that the Knight's Cross generated coverage in secondary sources is to be taken as evidence for notability, even if it is so because the Nazi government placed a very high emphasis on medals given for military service. Roches (talk)\n\nIf we would be consistent here, we should add article for all recipient of the French Legion of Honour, the highest French medal (and awarded over a million times; with a about a 100,000 living recipients today). It seems WP:Soldier assumes that highest award are rare (as they are with the VC in the UK or the medal of honour in the US (both in existence well over 100 years and on average awarded fewer than 30 times a year over the time). Arnoutf (talk)\n\nIt is always based on coverage in sources; WP:SOLDIER is not policy. The problem here is that the sources are predominantly in German, and many sources are not searchable. So, what concerns me is nominating a page for deletion, or voting \"delete\", based on a search of English-language sources. Roches (talk)\n\nI agree entirely with this comment by Roches. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nConcur - Roches makes an extremely valid point. German (and other) language newspapers should enjoy the same credibility/weight that we give to the Telegraph for example. 06:23, 21 July 2016 (UTC)\n\nIs anyone disputing they shouldn't be given equal weight? -- Necrothesp (talk)\n\nYes. The initiator of this discussion said: \"Off-line German language sources\" are not available to me -- both physically and linguistically. I assume that would be true for most English wiki editors. Contemporaneous sources published between 1939 and 1945 would be highly unreliable, having been produced under the totalitarian regime. I expect they would not be of any use, unless covered by reliable secondary sources as part of WWII historiography. I strongly agree with Roches' point and disagree with K.e.coffman's dismissal of off-line German sources. Pburka (talk)\n\nI also stated: \"I'm not following -- how would 1939-45 sources be reliable? We don't use them to source articles on WWII battles, for example. Also to clarify, I'm not arguing against German language sources; my point is that none have been added in eight years, so it's unrealistic to expect that they would be in foreseeable future.\" There was no response on why contemporaneous sources would be reliable.\n\nI believe that German sources (in particular newspapers) were brought up in the context of verifying the award; see for example from Roches: \"most likely, most German newspapers printed lists of new Knight's Cross recipients. The most reliable sources just happened to be undigitized, unsearchable\" -- this is not needed since Fellgiebel or Scherzer are already included in these articles; they are generally accepted as RS to confirm the award.\n\nThe issue under discussion is not whether the subjects received the award, but about them failing GNG due to lack of \"significant coverage in reliable secondary sources\". Reliable secondary sources in WP:MILMOS#SOURCES context are discussed as follows:\n\nPolicy requires that articles reference only reliable sources; however, this is a minimal condition, rather than a final goal. With the exception of certain recent topics that have not yet become the subject of extensive secondary analysis, and for which a lower standard may be temporarily permitted, articles on military history should aim to be based primarily on published secondary works by reputable historians. The use of high-quality primary sources is also appropriate, but care should be taken to use them correctly, without straying into original research. Editors are encouraged to extensively survey the available literature—and, in particular, any available historiographic commentary—regarding an article's topic in order to identify every source considered to be authoritative or significant; these sources should, if possible, be directly consulted when writing the article.\n\nK.e.coffman (talk)\n\nOfficial documents, even (or perhaps especially) of a totalitarian regime, about awarding medals to individuals can probably be considered reliable primary documents. The issue at stake is not so much whether there is sufficient evidence these medals were awarded but instead whether being the mere recipient of one of these medals implies notability at a level of GNG even in the absence of further evidence. For VC or medal of honour I would say yes - in part because of their rarity, for the KC I would say no. Arnoutf (talk)\n\nComment I agree with BrownHairedGirl in that this is really not about ANYBIO1, it is about possible amendment to WP:SOLDIER, specifically with regard to the Knight's Cross. The application of ANYBIO1 is far wider than the highest military award for valour in each country, and it is really a red herring in this discussion. The presumption of notability for Knight's Cross recipients comes from WP:SOLDIER, not the far wider ANYBIO1, of which the SOLDIER presumption constitutes a very small subset. In fact, because we are specifically talking about the application of SOLDIER, the discussion should be taking place in project space where it will get greater exposure to editors with a clue about such things. If WP:MILNG or WP:SOLDIER need modification, the place to have the discussion is Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Military history. Also, from my reading of the extensive discussion here, I can't see any likelihood that a consensus will be reached that we dispense with the AfD process for hundreds? of articles and give carte blanche to anyone to turn them into redirects to the alphabetical lists, so there seems to be little point in continuing the back and forth. I suggest that interested editors work their way through the Knight's Cross lists, make an assessment of whether they individually meet the GNG, then AfD those that they don't believe meet the GNG, proposing they be redirected to the relevant alphabetical list. Then they can each be discussed on their merits, some will be kept, some will end up as redirects. Cheers, Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nNotice of dispute resolution request\n\nI requested dispute resolution on this issue, naming myself, K.e.coffmann and Peacemaker67 as involved editors, although there are many editors involved. It's clear that no editor will convince another that a source is reliable or not. Further, large numbers of articles have been affected by this apparently well-intentioned effort at denazification. It would be impossible to resolve each issue separately, and beyond impossible to ensure a fair standard was applied to all the involved articles. Roches (talk) 03:37, 28 July 2016 (UTC) Roches, do you mind linking to the DRN discussion? I don't seem to have been pinged. Thanks, Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nHere it is: Dispute resolution for this page.

But note that all recipients of multiple Knight's Crosses have an article. Roches (talk)\n\nComment -- The KC holder category on German Wikipedia contains 323 entries. It seems implausible that the KC recipients would be 10 times more notable in English than they are in German. K.e.coffman (talk)\n\nComment, that only means they have not written as many articles on the subject as of yet; one could argue that is true as far as any number of articles for all other Wikipedia's in other languages; English Wikipedia has far and away many more articles overall then any other one. Kierzek (talk)\n\nThis is clearly some kind of anomaly. For example, roughly 500 of KC holder articles were created by editor Jim Sweeney between Oct 2008 and Feb 2009 (pls see history from that period. Editor DocYako's creation of KC holder articles was more spread out: between 2010 and 2016 they created over 1,500 (see history, maybe more. With just two editors responsible for over 2,000 cookie-cutter articles, I can't say that this is wikipedia community coming together organically to create content. K.e.coffman (talk)\n\nProposal 1 (new WP:Soldier criteria for Nazi Germany)\n\nProposal 1: We modify the WP:Soldier criteria for all Nazi-era Knights Cross winners to only include those who were awarded the knights cross with Oak Leaves. If I understand the discussion above correctly then this was in fact the country's second highest award (after the one that only Hitler received, and yes, I checked and he already has a page).Monopoly31121993 (talk)\n\nSupport: I support this proposal because it will be more in line with other countries WP:Soldier criteria and will not have the effect of biasing the creation of Wikipedia pages in favor of award winners from a totalitarian state whose purpose in providing thousands of these awards was propagandistic and part of a broader strategy to manipulate the population of Europe towards barbarism.Monopoly31121993 (talk)\n\nOppose For several reasons (1) The essay (not a guideline) in WP:Soldier is within the remit of the Milhist project. This discussion should be done there (2) The WP:Soldier discussion only suggests that receiving the highest honour is likely linked to be sufficient report, but does not make a definite claim it is sufficient. (3) Making an exception for a specific (no longer existing) state would require that all states are reviewed. And indeed there seem to be reasons to limit this clause for other cases as well. For example, for the French Legion of Honour it seems to be consensus that only the higher classes are considered notable because of the currently about 100,000 living recipients. (compared to e.g. the Dutch Military William Order with only 4 living recipients at the moment). So all in all, this seems to be solving a non-existing problem, or if the problem exists, to solve only one part of it. To take this further - please argue there is a problem, and secondly, propose a generic solution rather than a state specific one. Arnoutf (talk)\n\nOppose per Arnoutf. This is a matter for MILHIST. Chris Troutman (talk)\n\nOppose this is not only incorrect, as I have tried to explain in some detail above, but it is a matter for MILHIST. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nOppose per above. This is incorrect -- also, unless I'm mistaken, Hitler refused to wear any medals besides his World War I Iron Cross and Black Wound Badge. You may be thinking of Goering's Grand Cross of the Iron Cross. Roches (talk)\n\nOppose This is a misunderstanding of the award, which does not have the same structure as the Legion of Honour, but also of WP:SOLDIER. All it says is that our experience has been that sources are available to write articles. Hawkeye7 (talk)\n\nComment. Note that although WP:SOLDIER does not claim that meeting its criteria = inherent notability, that is certainly how it is almost invariably interpreted, so I would be wary about taking the exact wording too literally. I would agree that only the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves and above confers inherent notability, for the reasons I have outlined before (i.e. the Knight's Cross is far too common to equate to the Victoria Cross or Medal of Honor and while some awards definitely did equate to the level of bravery required for those awards, many more did not), but I would not agree that an unadorned Knight's Cross does not confer inherent notability (as a single second- or third-level award does not). It depends entirely on the circumstances of award. -- Necrothesp (talk)\n\nJust a point of clarification. Your response doesn't address Knight's Crosses awarded prior to the creation of the Oak Leaves. ie prior to Barbarossa. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nMakes no difference to what I said. -- Necrothesp (talk)\n\nOppose, an artificial and arbitrary cut-off as to who to include and exclude is not the way it should be done. They should be looked at on a case by case basis with there being a rebuttable presumption of notability. Kierzek (talk)\n\nStrongly Oppose, such a cut off is an arbitrary criterium. It would mean the same as arbitrarily saying that people who were awarded an upgraded MoH don’t deserve an article. – fdewaele, 25 July 2016, 16:50 CET.\n\nProposal 2\n\nWe modify the WP:Soldier criteria so that single reception of a highest honour is only considered sufficient for presumed notability when the highest honour is awarded less frequently than 50 times on average over the life of the honour. That would count for both (single) Knights cross and (French) legion of honour awardees. Arnoutf (talk)\n\nSupport This would exclude in an unbiased way situations where high honours are not rare. Arnoutf (talk)\n\nOppose This is a matter for MILHIST. Chris Troutman (talk)\n\nOppose Per Chris T. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nOppose per above. I do not support automatic notability. Roches (talk)\n\nOppose Agree that this is a matter for MILHIST. But for the record, the actual criteria for an award is not what is important here. We are not in the business of deciding if one award is more worthy than another. Hawkeye7 (talk)\n\nAh, but we essentially are. We have already decided that (under the Commonwealth and American systems) the recipient of a single first-level award is inherently notable whereas the recipient of a single second-level award is not. Obviously the former award is higher - that stands to reason - but it is we who have decided that its recipients are worthy of inclusion on Wikipedia whereas the recipients of the latter are not. This is simple enough under those systems, but it is not at all simple for countries that do not use such a structured system (i.e. most of them). And that's our problem. Does a medal awarded to 7,000 people in six years confer the same inherent notability as one awarded to 1,300 people in 150 years? Clearly it does not, unless the former nation is over a hundred times larger than the latter nation or the former's soldiers are over a hundred times braver, both of which are obviously a nonsense. Yet under WP:SOLDIER we would give both awards equal weight because they are both the \"top\" award for gallantry, despite the former clearly being often awarded for \"lesser\" acts than the latter. -- Necrothesp (talk)\n\nHere’s a thought: None of the single awards of a KC qualify under SOLDIER1 since it cannot be reliably determined whether they were awarded for valour vs other things, due to the fact that the award was not structured that way. This automatically takes off presumption of notability off a single-award recipient, in the absence of other military notability factors, such as “commanded a significant body of troops (division or higher)\" and/or held a \"general officer rank”.\n\nThe sources included with the articles provide a one line entry for each subject. They reliably state that an award was presented to a named individual, their rank, and the unit they served with at the time of the nomination, and the date of the presentation. The rest of the information presented in the articles was apparently sourced from dubious websites such as lexicon-der-wehrmacht.de; ritterkrauzerjager1939-45.de (or some such); das-reich.ca or frontjkemper.nl, among others. K.e.coffman (talk)\n\nI would agree and I have argued that in the past, but been shouted down by those who claim that SOLDIER applies to any \"highest\" award even if it's awarded to many thousands rather than tens or hundreds. It's always needed a bit of common sense to interpret the criterion and realise that it can only really apply to the Commonwealth/American system. -- Necrothesp (talk)\n\nComment: Monopoly31121993 makes a valid point about totalitarian regimes where high awards were used for propaganda purposes, among other things. I've done some \"original research\" by comparing the award rate of the U.S. Medal of Honor to the Knight's Cross. My inputs were: 464 Medal of Honor recipients out of appox. US 18M servicemen in WWII (0.0026% award rate). For Germany, 7,300 KC recipients out of approx 20M servicemen (0.036% award rate). For the Knight's Cross to be as prestigious and rare as the Medal of Honor, it would have needed to be awarded in about 500 cases. Unless my math is completely off, this equates roughly to Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, of which ~860 were awarded, a much lower number vs the Knight's Cross.\n\nSimilar to the KC, the title of Hero of the Soviet Union (HSU) was a mass award: ~11,600 recipients out of 34M personnel during WWII. This equates to an award rate of 0.034%, on par with that of the KC. However, currently WP has 625 articles in the HSU category (for about 5% of recipients), so hopefully these are genuinely notable subjects.\n\nIn contrast, there are about 3750 KC holder articles, that is, roughly 50% of recipients (all grades) have a WP article. This seems way out of proportion to either Western Allies (due to the rarity of the awards for valour) or the Soviet Union (due to the general lack of English sources and the language barrier). It also appears that two editors (DocYako and JimSweeney) were responsible for the creation of the bulk of the article that have caused my notability concerns (at least hundreds each); so these articles were not created “organically” by a diverse group of contributors—an unusual circumstance. (I again left msg for both editors to see if they would like to engage with the discussion here).\n\nFrom this math it appears that the issue is indeed country-specific: Germany during WWII. Perhaps it needs to be handled as a special case? K.e.coffman (talk)\n\nThe problems with your maths is that a) not all Knight's Crosses were awarded for valour, and b) such a system (limiting to Oak Leaves and above) doesn't take into account awards before the Oak Leaves were created, and c) it is terribly skewed against lower-ranking soldiers awarded the Knight's Cross for valour. I believe all the arguments have been made above, so there is no point in repeating them all here. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nThe proposal does not bias against lower-ranking soldiers if they have sufficient RS in order to meet the general requirements to have a biographic reference in Wikipedia. A major problem right now is that there are lots of pages that don't even meet that criteria and that is the case because two editors decided to create hundreds of article of Nazi-era Knights Cross awards winners (often using one of 2 German language texts as RS, which, in at least in one case, even the text's author cautions against).Monopoly31121993 (talk)\n\nYes, the U.S. Medal of Honor has been awarded for propaganda purposes (eg Charles Lindbergh and Douglas MacArthur). That is not what is important. What is important is that the award attracts sufficient interest that readers want to read about them, and sufficient information becomes available for us to write about them. That is the case with the Medal of Honor, and it is the case with the Knight's Cross. Hawkeye7 (talk)\n\nThe propaganda aspect is important because we are assuming that there is comparability been these awards across all countries. If tomorrow, North Korea decided it wanted to issue it's highest award to 4 people every day there's no way Wikipedians would agree on parroting that information into Wikipedia pages for each of them but that is exactly the situation that we have here for the Nazi regime.Monopoly31121993 (talk)\n\nI was surprised that so many Knight's Cross holders have WP articles, so I checked some similar awards. Every one of the Medal of Honor and Victoria Cross recipients for World War II has a Wikipedia article. Although there are very few English articles, every Hero of the Soviet Union has an article in Russian Wikipedia. Roches (talk)\n\nAnd there we are back to the core of the issue. Are KC, VC, and Medal of Honor similar awards. With the total number of VC being 1358 since its inception in 1856, and only 181 being awarded during WWII; with the KC being awarded 7,364 times (all during WWII) - which is roughly 40 times as many. Therefore I would argue these awards are in fact NOT similar (unless we can agree that the German armed forces across the board showed 40 times as much valour compared to the British forces (or about 15 times a valorous compared to the US armed forces looking at the number of medals of honour awarded). Arnoutf (talk)\n\nThe statement \"not all Knight's Crosses were awarded for valour\" problematic, as it's unknowable which were awarded for \"extreme battlefield bravery\" and which were awarded for \"successful military leadership\", since Nazi Germany itself did not appear to make this distinction. Fellgiebel and Scherzer (two of the most frequently sources cited in WP to establish the fact of the award) do not provide this information. Suggesting that editors figure out which was which on their own and \"give the subjects of these articles the benefit of the doubt [re: valour]\" is inviting OR.\n\nHere's a sample article on a low-ranking Waffen-SS KC holder: Otto Kron -- it is cited entirely to the dubious web site fronjkemper (which apparently used to be a Norwegian Waffen-SS fan site, now dead); describes his \"suffering through the Russian Winter\"; and in general looks like a WP:Memorial. More of the same: Max Seela (tagged refimprove since 2012). Both came off the Template: KC recipients in SS Division Totenkopf.\n\nK.e.coffman (talk)\n\nIt's only problematic because you can't access their recommendation documents or newspaper articles about them, including obituaries. I've made the point about non-English sources above. It's certainly not \"unknowable\". Just because you can't access the offline sources that may have information about them or their award doesn't mean they don't exist. Several other editors have pointed out the same thing. Giving them the benefit of the doubt is not OR, it is based on a presumption made by SOLDIER that sources exist that would meet GNG. BTW, Seela's exploits are described in Sydnor's Soldiers of Destruction published by Princeton University Press, and they certainly appear to meet the valour criteria. A simple Google search would have located that reference on the first page of results. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nI agree with the comment above that nomination documents would be reliable WP:Primary sources, if these were available (they are not in Scherzer and Fellgiebel).\n\nIn contrast, contemporaneous secondary sources (I.e. newspapers) are either\n\nlimited, as in the sample presented by Roches—simply a list of KC recipients, which is a trivial mention; moreover, same information is already available in Scherzer and has been cross checked with archival material and is thus more reliable\n\nunreliable journalistic accounts, put through the prism of war-time propaganda. Wikipedia does not consider propaganda, whether Allied or Axis, to be a reliable source.\n\nI looked into obituaries; they are not listed in WP:RS main page, but here’s what I found in the WP:RS Talk archives as a proposed addition:\n\nObituaries can be an invaluable resource for biographical articles, providing essential details like birth and death dates, family relations, education, and a timeline of major accomplishments. News obituaries, which are written by journalists and subject to fact checking, can provide essential biographical details and a good summary of a person's acheivements. Classified obituaries, which are written and paid for by the deceased's family, should be considered self-published sources and do not contribute to satisfying the General notability guideline.\n\nAnd:\n\n(a) Obituaries at newspapers and other publications are frequently not written by staff journalists but by outsiders who have an especially informed perspective on the deceased party - sometimes, indeed, people who knew him. For example, if astrophysicist X dies, astrophysicist Y (if she is a good writer) might be invited to contribute an obituary. (b) The addition perpetuates the myth (acknowledged even in fact checking) that newspapers fact-check on a rigorous and routine basis. They don't - for that matter I don't think even the U.S. newsweeklies do it the way that they used to be famous for.\n\nObituaries most likely would be controversial when used as a source to establish GNG. For MilHist, preferred sources are discussed as: \"With the exception of certain recent topics that have not yet become the subject of extensive secondary analysis, and for which a lower standard may be temporarily permitted, articles on military history should aim to be based primarily on published secondary works by reputable historians.\" In the absence of reliable secondary sources, GNG can be challenged if only established by primary or self-published materials. K.e.coffman (talk)\n\nLook, I get that you're on a bit of a mission to get rid of Nazi hero worshipping authors and websites from en WP. It's a laudable aim. I've deleted many links to axishistory and feldgrau and other fansites myself over the years. But I'm afraid you are getting a bit carried away with this particular campaign, and risk creating a systemic bias against German military biographies on en WP. Let's use an example. Recommendation documents for WWI and WWII soldiers of Australia have been digitised and are available free online. Australian obituaries are easily available via the National Library of Australia Trove website that provides free digital copies of all but the most local of newspapers. Given my first (and only fluent) language is English, it makes it very easy for me to access them and use them to cite articles on Australian soldiers. Where are the equivalent German recommendation documents? Presumably at the Bundesarchiv, but not digitised as far as I can tell. There are also de-Nazification records, probably also there, undigitised. Have German newspapers been digitised to the same extent as Australian ones? I don't know, but I am certainly not aware of where they might be held if they have. I've made an effort to look too, as I have an FA or two on German-speaking soldiers, and expect there will be more information available on them, if only I could access it from Australia. My German is very scratchy however, so I would struggle to find the relevant information even if both types of information were fully digitised and searchable as they are in Australia. But the German information can quite reasonably be presumed to exist. How many German-language books on WWII have been digitised and are available in Google Books preview? Not very many, I'll give you the drum. I repeat, you risk creating a serious systemic bias against German military biographies by going around PRODing articles because you don't personally have access to the offline sources that might mean someone meets GNG. I note you haven't acknowledged the fact that I found a mention of Seela in a book without even trying, even though you used him as an example of what is wrong with having articles on Knight's Cross recipients. I have to say that you are undermining your own argument a bit here. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nGentlemen, regardless of whether the reasons for giving these awards is reliably discernable or not, which is an issue in it of itself, the problem remains that simply too many Knight's Crosses were awarded, taking away from their relevance. You can hardly call the award notable when it's been awarded 40 times more often that it's foreign equivalents. And what's with this \"victor's justice\" nonsense, Peacemaker67? You should know that history is written by the literate, not the victors. You can't expect anyone to take you seriously when you make such statements. You call K.e.coffman out for excess of zeal, but your borderline apologist affirmations make me more wary of you.--MaxRavenclaw (talk)\n\nI couldn't care less if you are wary of me, my record of quality content creation in highly-contested areas of WP speaks for itself. The problem isn't with the number awarded, it is with the attempt to apply a blanket approach to it (because K.e.coffman is apparently too busy to look at each one individually). They should be handled on an individual basis, based on when they were awarded and for what, not some arbitrary number comparison, which also shows Anglo-American systemic bias given the number of Hero's of the Soviet Union awarded. Next thing you'll be telling me that I have a borderline apologist approach to the Soviet Union. Give me strength... Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nI'm not the only one wary of you, mate. Your record of quality in general doesn't mean you are unbiased, and frankly, the borderline Wehrmacht circlejerk you and your group indulge in is alarming. --MaxRavenclaw (talk)\n\n\"My group\"? What \"group\" is that? FFS. Go carefully, Max, personal attacks are verboten. Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nI believe editor Peacemaker has self-identified this \"group\" (whether real or imagined) via statements such as \"\"these deletions are not in consensus in the Milhist community\" and \"That is not how we do military biographies on en WP\". Indeed, editor Peacemaker makes frequent allusions to \"en Wiki\" as in this discussion between MilHist coordinators: \"de WP is a very different beast from en WP (...). I don't think en WP will benefit from accommodating the [anti-Nazi] hard line that is apparently standard there\". Another editor chimes in with: \"I've also had encounters with the diehard anti-Nazis, to my chagrin\" while the rest of the participants look on.\n\nIn this thread on my talk page, an uninvolved editor described these statements as indicative of WP:OWN and WP:FACTION attitudes, with editors \"engaging in their own internal, insular processes\". Similar commentary was offered at a recent GAR: \"appears to be a kind of echo chamber\"; \"I would suggest that there is a systemic issue for articles of this kind.\"; \"WP:LOCALCONSENSUS\"; etc.\n\nEditor MaxRavenclaw is clearly not the only one being concerned over this. K.e.coffman (talk)\n\nTo be honest, as I argued above, the French Legion of Honour and indeed the hero of the Soviet Union have the same issue. Far too many awarded to presume notability merely based on the award. If anything seems Anglo-American biased, I would argue it is the WP:Soldier essay.\n\nYour argument above, that a case by case analysis for notability should be made seems relevant. However, this places their inclusion in the GNG domain. The issue now becomes whether this case by case analysis is up to those claiming notability or that those who dispute notability merely based on WP:SOLDIER should provide the (negative) evidence the person is actually not notable. The latter is in my view impossible as with all negative evidence (and the point that obscure German sources are not readily available becomes a valid point here). So if we put this back to the original supporter of the article the argument becomes that WP:Soldier is not sufficient for keeping the article. Close to what was proposed at the start of this post. Arnoutf (talk)\n\nMany of the arguments presented for keeping the status quo have not been convincing: \"WP:IMPATIENT\"; \"GNG should not matter in these cases\"; \"Contemporaneous sources are extremely reliable\" [how is propaganda reliable?]; \"a person does not become non-notable because they are only mentioned in potentially unreliable sources\"; \"the risk of creating a systemic bias\", \"apparently too busy to look at each one individually\", among others. The allusions to \"victor's justice\" and arguments along the lines of \"if you delete German KC holder articles, you should also delete articles on Allied personnel\" especially do not hold water.\n\nThe Max Seela article is relevant here. It's been tagged refimprove since 2012, so if it only took 10 minutes to find a source, why has not this happened in the four intervening years? This goes back to my point that these articles cover topics that are not that interesting to the Wikipedia community, and by extension, to the general public. What's the point in keeping these memorial / stub articles if no improvements are forthcoming?\n\nSince Peacemaker raised the issue of me being a \"campaigner\", I would like to point out that it's not the first time that this has come up. Here are a few examples of prior content disagreements:\n\nIn the discussion of what the editor acknowledged was \"uncited or poorly cited\" material: \" I recommend you just restrict yourself to making the language more neutral where necessary\".\n\nEdit summary: \"That is not how we do military biographies on en WP\". We[who?]?\n\nI have previously raised the issue of sources at MilHist FA/GA articles in the April MilHist FA/GA discussion. The results were inconclusive, with some editors noting \"Problem is that if we start scouring through the pile we will inevitably get ourselves dirty\", while editor PeaceMaker called me a \"campaigner\", writing: \"This whole process has been dubious. .. I've seen that before in the areas where I edit, and it usually says more about the campaigner.\"\n\nMore recently, Peacemaker and another MilHist coordinator defended the use of extensive quoting from German war-time propaganda broadcasts on the grounds that it is \"historic testimony\": see Bach-Zalewski discussion, as well as that on Manstein Talk page. Editor Peacemaker in particular suggested that these quotes should stay in because Nazi propaganda isn't just propaganda, its also news, concluding with: \"In this case it may have included euphemisms for criminal actions, but it may equally have been referring to bravery in combat against armed fighters of the Home Army.\" (Indeed, going door to door shooting civilians is hard work). In the end, Peacemaker has reconsidered their position, so perhaps my \"campaigning\" is having an effect?\n\nThe sourcing issues are not recents and have been raised before by other contributors, such as in these links from 2013: (1) Deletions of so called unreliable sources and (2) \"Immortal German Soldiers\", in which same editors defended keeping right-wing sources.\n\nRegarding recent AfDs: \"I suggest you stop, otherwise I will take your conduct to ANI\" (BTW, I don't believe I've PRODed any KC holder articles, as Peacemaker alleges; perhaps I am being confused with another editor?).\n\nMore commentary can be found on my Talk page (User_talk:K.e.coffman#GAR), including a link to a discussion where Peacemaker describes my actions as a \"problem\" due to \"hard line anti-Nazi\" attitudes; and yes, that's probably the first time that I've heard the term anti-Nazi used pejoratively, including by a MilHist lead coordinator.\n\nEditor Peacemaker has accused me of being a \"deletionist\" on several occasions; but I would argue that \"keepism\" (the term I learned just recently) is indeed a problem, as this thread has demonstrated. In any case, this seems to be headed to an RfC as the views appear to be polar opposites. K.e.coffman (talk)\n\nK.e. different opinions are held and differences of opinion stated. Stating that \"many\" don't hold water is not going to win the day; it is a difference of stated opinion; I see it all the time in my day job. And unlike my day job there is not a judge to rule on the matter (and even then they get appealed and reversed at times). As for me I stated my opinion above and stand by it. And I agree with the editor above who noted that the Germans are not the only nation with awards and articles which have problems. The Soviet Union especially comes to mind. I don't believe we should throw the baby out with the bath water. Anyway, I don't see a conclusive outcome as to this matter herein at this time on this board. Kierzek (talk)\n\nThis can only be solved by RfC, but we should not slow down the process of assessing notability of individual RK articles. There's clearly a problem of perceived notability not being borne out by sources. And Peacemaker66, if anyone's behavior is alarming, it's yours. Nobody but wehraboos would want to read individual pages of so many German soldiers. A single page with a list and shot descriptions should have been enough, but in your fervor you're throwing threats and only making yourself look bad. You clearly have an agenda. --MaxRavenclaw (talk)\n\nI have an agenda? You have less than 200 edits in a year on en WP, and no articles created. And no edits on any other language WP. Yet you are engaged in a detailed discussion of a WP guideline, strongly supporting one editor and disparaging those that oppose his POV. That's a very steep learning curve for anyone. I smell sock, or meat... Peacemaker67 (click to talk to me)\n\nI see that threats and accusations are favourites with the above editor. Indeed, it's extremely odd that there might be other alleged \"anti-Nazis\" on Wikipedia. :-) Next thing they would see collusion / socking here as well: Neo-Nazi publications or Wikipedia:Good article reassessment/Otto Kittel/1. K.e.coffman (talk)\n\nCome on boys, enough with the mud slinging, stay on point. Kierzek (talk)\n\nI would agree but I don't like being called a \"campaigner\" and my contributions dismissed as a \"crusade\" or \"being on a mission\". I believe that these are issues of concern to the community overall. K.e.coffman (talk)\n\nOppose, such a cut off is an arbitrary criterium. There should never be a numerus clausus on valour. Plus this effort depicts a lack of understanding of the award, which didn’t only military success on a strategic or tactical level (generals, which almost automatically means they meet notability in itself) but also recognized individual feats of valour, but also continuous/repeated valour (tank destroyers, pilot aces, U-boat aces,…) and had in due time as war progressed more categories to distinguish those continuous acts of valour– fdewaele, 25 July 2016, 16:50 CET.\n\nANYBIO1\n\nProcedural comment. Please move this discussion to project space. It is about proposed amendments to an essay, whereas this page is for discussing Wikipedia's notability policies. --BrownHairedGirl (talk) • (contribs)\n\nI don't necessarily agree about moving the discussion, because WP:ANYBIO is also in play, as it has been brought up as justifying the keeping of KC holder articles. This section of the notability guidelines read:\n\nAny biography:\n\nThe person has received a well-known and significant award or honor, or has been nominated for one several times.\n\nThe person has made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in his or her specific field.\n\nSome editors interpret KC as meeting ANYBIO1; see for example: Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Josef_Preiß, \"No need to debate about which military medals are more valuable than others, there is actually a very broad Special Notability Criterion for WP inclusion. WP:Notability for Biography, \"Any Bio no. 1,\" which states: \"The person has received a well-known and significant award or honor, or has been nominated for one several times.\" That's all there is to it, there is no need to meet an arcane Military project hoop. This subject passes on that basis.\"\n\nMy interpretation is that there's no equivalence between the KC (if used as #1) and #2 \"widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record\"; they are just not on the same level. So perhaps ANYBIO1 needs to be clarified? I.e. a Nobel Prize qualifies, but another award doesn't?\n\nThus any potential RfC may need to address whether or not a single award of a Knight's Cross qualifies under ANYBIO1. K.e.coffman (talk)\n\nThanks for the clarification. ANYBIO1 is way too broad, and as well as being narrowed it should offer no more than a rebuttable presumption of notability. --BrownHairedGirl (talk) • (contribs)\n\n@BrownHairedGirl: Here's an idea -- should ANYBIO1 be dispensed with altogether? A Nobel Prize winner has indisputably \"made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record\", so ANYBIO1 is not needed. Thoughts? Otherwise, as you point out, ANYBIO1 is way to broad and ambiguous, while being subject to POV interpretations. K.e.coffman (talk)\n\nAs a largely disinterested observer in this particular discussion, but as someone who has dealt with ANYBIO1 a fair few times, I'd say that it needs significant clarification, as it does nothing at all to define \"well-known and significant\". To use examples in my area of editing, the main Australian honours system goes from AC at the top through AO and AM to OAM - all significant and well-known honours, but only the first two really consistently include people who can safely be assumed to be notable. We've had this discussion a lot at AfD with people trying to use OAM, for example, as evidence of notability - and according to ANYBIO1, they're not necessarily wrong. Evidently this kind of thing happens with most honours systems, and even at the top eschelons of some as we're seeing. Perhaps ANYBIO1 should be moved to a specific section and narrowed and clarified quite substantially, or even turned into a sub-essay of its own with detailed explanations. Frickeg (talk)\n\n@K.e.coffman: The purpose of an SNG should be to avoid cluttering up AFD with a flood of nominations of underdeveloped articles on a set of topics where it is overwhelmingly likely that the sources do exist to meet GNG. In this case it seems that the spread is too broad to achieve that purpose, and is giving a presumption of notability to sets topics which are actually unlikely to pass GNG.\n\nSo, can it be narrowed without becoming too verbose? --BrownHairedGirl (talk) • (contribs)\n\n@BrownHairedGirl:: My suggestion would be to trim and reword as follows:\n\nAny biography:\n\nThe person has received a well-known and significant award or honor, such as the Nobel Prize.\n\nThe person has made a widely recognized contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in his or her specific field.\n\nI think \"nominated several times\" is unnecessary, and including the Nobel Prize as a point of comparison would be helpful to editors. Such as in \"Is the KC in any way, shape or form comparable to the Nobel Prize? No—nothing to see here, please move along.\" K.e.coffman (talk)\n\nIsn't that what's known as a wrecking amendment?\n\nIt's just a verbose way of saying \"The person has received a well-known and significant award or honor, such as the Nobel Prize\". --BrownHairedGirl (talk) • (contribs)\n\nPart 3\n\nAttempted restatement/summarisation of the masses of text above:\n\nThe RK was awarded for valour and/or leadership and/or success (confirmed kills, etc). An RK award for valour was the highest such award in Nazi Germany. However WP:SOLDIE"
