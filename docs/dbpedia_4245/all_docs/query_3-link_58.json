        "text": "Dr. Gallus, MD, MS is a neurosurgery resident and a postdoctoral fellow of the German Research Foundation (DFG). He pursued his medical studies at the University of Muenster, Germany, with enriching experiences abroad in Japan and Switzerland. Concurrently, Dr. Gallus successfully completed a 5-year master’s program in experimental medicine, receiving comprehensive training at the Max-Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine in Muenster and the Department of Neuropathology at the University Hospital Muenster.\n\nDr. Gallus attained graduation at the Institute of Translational Neurology within the University Hospital Muenster, Germany, under the supervision of Dr. Sven Meuth, MD, PhD, and Dr. Nico Melzer, MD, focusing on investigating the pathophysiology of brain autoimmunity. His research led to the discovery of antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells as mediators of autoimmune limbic encephalitis (ALE) associated with temporal lobe epilepsy. Additionally, he was able to characterize the translocator protein (TSPO) as a novel translational and non-invasive biomarker for innate immunity in cytotoxic T cell mediated limbic encephalitis.\n\nPrior to commencing his residency program, Dr. Gallus served as a neurosurgery intern under supervision of Dr. Andreas Raabe, MD at Inselspital Bern, Switzerland. During his residency at the University Hospital Muenster under the guidance and support of Dr. Walter Stummer, MD, his primary interest then revolved around the treatment of brain and spine tumor patients.\n\nHere at UCSF, Dr. Gallus investigates novel innovative technologies such as low-intensity pulsed focused ultrasound as potential tool to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy for glioma.\n\nBeyond his research Dr. Gallus is an active member of the Young Neurooncological Workgroup of the German Cancer Society (DKG), the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies (EANS), the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO), the German Network for Research on Autoimmune Encephalitis and he supports the international Student Association for Neurosurgery, Neurology and Neurosciences Connectome.\n\nDr. Gallus was awarded funding from the Hertie Foundation, the German Business Foundation (SDW), the European Committee For Treatment And Research In Multiple Sclerosis as well as the German Research Foundation."
