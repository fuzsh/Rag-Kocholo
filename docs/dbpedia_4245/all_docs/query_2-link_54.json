        "text": "A town tucked away on a hill Where a chapel will burn bright all night All the children's dreams are safe And warm As a blizzard scrapes the country-side One old saint sits alone and waits For the sacred bells to ring in The sacred day Sugar coated canes And prosthetic legs A dim chanting hymn leads the way Dusty wigs and tobacco teeth A gift to receive On Christmas Eve Do you believe- In the fate of the seed? The stump of the tree- On Christmas Eve A spirit with a beard on the roof A slip of the boot and the hoof As a thud brings to wake And a mind draws the drapes- A child finds the truth by mistake It's a gift that you're bound to receive On Christmas Eve\n\nLean on my shoulder Wait for the lake to freeze over Bulbs burn in every color The school kids suffer As the chill gets colder And the whirling snow Will cast its spell On every friend and foe As the wind begins to blow A chorus of misfits In the wildest spirits Carols in the air In the blizzard; in the clear The neighborhood choir is finally here The whirling snow Will cast its spell On every friend and foe An antiqued dream: Flicker and glow You And I Are drifting Stardust Snowflake Air A still And silent evening The great and ancient Season"
