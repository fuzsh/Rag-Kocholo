Some communicate only on one channel; some effortlessly flit across channels. But brands and their Customer Experience (CX) leaders don’t have that luxury. They must manage preferences across all their customers while trying to strike the balance of service excellence, operational costs, and an array of automation and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities across channels.\n\nHow do brands manage the tension between serving customers however they want, in whatever channel they want, and proactively steering customers to channels to manage customer experience and efficiency?\n\nThis panel will dissect modern frameworks for crafting effective customer channel journeys. We’ll delve into customer behaviors across channels and the importance of fostering lifelong conversations that don’t just span channels but span over the entire customer relationship, moving beyond mere transactions.
