The little body was buried yesterday morning in the Catholic Cemetery.\n\nALBERT F. BRACHMANN Albert F.

Mr. Brachmann was born Nov. 21, 1885, at Manitowoc, son of the late Nick and Cecelia Roedeg Brachmann, and always resided in the city. He married the former Catherine Schleis Oct. 11, 1911, at St. Boniface, and she died April 18, 1957. He was a cabinetmaker and carpenter, and retired from the trade 15 years ago.

Brachmann, age 67, a resident of Manitowoc, and formerly of Nashville, TN, entered eternal life on Thursday, February 9, 2017 at Aurora Medical Center in Two Rivers. Art was born on July 25, 1949 in Manitowoc to Grace Surfus Brachmann and the late Kenneth Brachmann. He graduated from Lincoln High School with the class of 1968. Arthur enjoyed his work with the water resources division of the U.S. Geological Survey, because it allowed him to travel all through the south. He also had a painting business called Artistry by Art in which he painted many home interiors of country music artists. His heart though was on his Tennessee land near the Cumberland River, where he lived for many years, roaming the hills and countryside with his German Shepherds, all named Max. He was an expert gardener and mechanic and appreciative of all country living. But his lifetime avocation was volunteer animal rescue, and his particular passion was the rescue of German Shepherds from shelters and bad circumstances. He used his formidable social networking skills and numerous contacts across the country to diligently identify German Shepherds and crosses being held in shelters nationwide and to refer these dogs to nearby rescue groups. He followed up with the rescue organizations when the dogs were healthy again and trained, and found prospective adoptive homes so these dogs would find forever homes and never see a shelter again. He was well-known and respected for his efforts, and appreciated for his humor and friendship, particularly in the German Shepherd community. Conscientious and loving, Arthur took care of his own beloved Max by arranging for Max's new home to be with Max's godmothers at Working Dogs Rescue. Arthur's guiding principle was \"do something, adopt, foster, rescue, volunteer, donate, anything\" to help all animals, because Arthur cherished and valued all life. He enjoyed collecting and reading James Patterson mysteries along with many others. Art also enjoyed dabbling in poetry and working in his vegetable garden and sharing it with his friends and family. He was happiest with his garden and his dog Max living in a little slave house on a plantation outside of Nashville, TN. Survivors include Art's mother, Grace Brachmann, Manitowoc; sister, Bonnie Hammes, Reedsville; special friend, Gale; his dog Max whom he loved dearly; also nieces, nephews, cousins and many friends. Art was preceded in death by his father, Kenneth Brachmann; also several aunts and uncles. Memorial services will be held at 11 a.m. on Wednesday, February 15, 2017 at the Harrigan Parkside Funeral Home. Rev. Richard Klingeisen will officiate with entombment of Art's cremated remains to take place at Calvary Mausoleum. Cremation has taken place at the Harrigan Parkside Crematory and Chapel. Following the memorial service, a luncheon will be held at the Harrigan Parkside Gathering Center located on the south property of the Harrigan Parkside Funeral Home. The family will greet relatives and friends and the Harrigan Parkside Funeral Home on Wednesday from 10 a.m. until the time of the memorial service at 11 a.m. Online condolences may be sent to the family at www.harriganparksidefuneralhome.com The Harrigan Parkside Funeral Home and Crematory, North 11th and St. Clair streets, Manitowoc is assisting the family with funeral arrangements.

Donations may be through PayPal to WorkingDogsRescue@gmail.com, or by check to Working Dogs Rescue, P.O. Box 353, Lisbon, Ohio 44432.

Mrs. Helena Pitsch died at her home, 1214 Marshall street on Tuesday last of a disease diagnosed as black smallpox The lady was apparently well on Monday and was stricken at night and with such virulence did it attack her system that she died in a few hours afterwards. Mrs. Pitsch was old and she lived alone in an upstair flat. She was the widow of the late Peter J. Pitsch who was for years engaged in the retail liquor business in the city. Deceased was the mother of a large family of children, several of whom survive her. Considerable alarm has been created by the death of Mrs. Pitsch under the circumstances and from smallpox.
