        "text": "A post war original signature on glossy 3×4 photo paper as well as a signature on a letter. The letter is on his personal letter head. the letter is dated 1987 and has some damage in the left upper corner. The letter seems to be a generic type, produced in advance to respond to collectors who wrote him. There are two tabs that held the picture originally on the letter but they no longer function. The letter just says in paraphrase: “i received your request, im including a picture, please use it only for your collection”\n\nFrom Military Wiki:\n\nWalter Pitsch (13 July 1920 – 29 July 2005) was a Hauptscharführer in the Waffen SS who was awarded the Knight’s Cross of the Iron Cross on 6 May 1945, he was the last member of the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler and the only member of the Division’s Anti Aircraft battalion to be given the award.[Note 1]\n\nAt the time of his award Pitsch was the commander of the 4th Battery, 1st SS Anti Aircraft Battalion, LSSAH."
