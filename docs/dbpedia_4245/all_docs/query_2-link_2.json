Jan. 19, last, while at work in the Pere Marquette shops, he had his toe smashed. Other complications set in and hastened his death. He was at St. Mary's Hospital for four weeks receiving treatment, and two weeks ago he was removed to his home. He was conscious till the last, and had hopes of getting well up till the moment he passed away. He was born in this city Sept. 19, 1892, and attended the public schools here. He was confirmed in St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church April 7, 1907, and was a favorite with his classmates. He is survived by his parents, two sisters and three brothers, Herman Pitsch; Mrs. Wm. A. Roggmann; Mrs. Ernest Elbert; Albert Krohn; and Wm. C. Krohn, all of this city; also his aged grandmother, Mrs. Wilhelmina Knopp, of Peotine, IL; besides numerous friends; and other relatives.\n\nThe funeral will take place Sunday afternoon at 1:45 o'clock from the residence, 436 South Thirteenth Street, and at 2:30 from St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church.
