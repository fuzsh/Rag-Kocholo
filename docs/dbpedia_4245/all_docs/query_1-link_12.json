        "text": "Recently, there has been a wealth of studies on Austrian eugenics, in terms both of its national historiographic tradition and current international debates. With the publication of Gerhard Baader, Veronika Hofer and Thomas Mayer's edited volume, Eugenik in Ã–sterreich, in 2007 it became clear that Austrian scholars on eugenics are progressively breaking away from previous historiographic traditions which treated Austrian eugenics as indistinguishable from its German counterpart, thus often describing it as contributing equally to the elaboration of Nazi racial discourses and the Holocaust. The publication of the three books under review is further indication that such a historiographic transformation is clearly under way."
