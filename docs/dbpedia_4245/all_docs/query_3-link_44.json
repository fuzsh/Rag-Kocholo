        "text": "Great place to check out while on the NorthEast side of town for vintage house items ...and just plain fun to dig around to see what's there. Bring a flashlight (or your phone app) and possibly some gloves. Park in front of the grey building and head inside. The main area is heated/air conditioned and has a little of everything. Bolts of fabric were really inexpensive, though they may not always have that kind of item all of the time. Most items are priced with a red tape easily seen. Interior stair railings are sold by the whole set (some with great vintage newel posts!) and it varies as to what is in stock at the time. (Would be cool to have a photo available of the original stairs before it was dismantled and in various sections and bins... wishful thinking.) Head through the rear door (or the plastic strip doorway to the right for the door room, etc.) for more things... and where you'll need that flashlight. Two matching huge (French?) painted cabinets/wardrobes (not sure what they are called) that are stunning- are priced at $450 each (ask the guy at the desk about them)... kitchen cabinets... pianos... glass deck railings... multiple bed frame parts from a hotel or something... all there and more to be dug through. Too fun. (Yes, it is dusty and perhaps has a bit of old wood/musty smell... but this is architectural salvaging/picking at its raw best. They could start their own Youtube channel here on all of the cool items...) We found the perfect sized set of well made, interior stair railing/ newels/ balusters for our old house in the back room area of the store for a very good price and in great used condition. (see photo of one section at our house below) Not everything is marked what price it is, but the helpful guy at the front desk knows exactly what's back there. Check back often to see what has come in ~ it is always interesting.\n\nIf I could give this business 0*, I would. Let's start with trying to take trash bags to their relay station on Richmond. They were excessively rude, and wouldn't help explain what I was supposed to do. I almost got hit repeatedly by a machine, even though I was doing exactly what he told me to, to get out of his way. Now to today, where they are demolishing a building next door to my house. They didn't give any warnings, and are now blocking my driveway. They're trying to claim they told people, but somehow noone in my building is aware it was going to happen? These people need some customer service skills and a brain, and maybe they'd be a decent company.\n\nHorrible. Rented a dumpster for 2 weeks. Was supposed to be picked up Friday 6/26 and was told that Friday they were busy and would pick it up Monday 6/29 which I was fine with. Then Monday they tell me the person who‚Äôs supposed to pick the dumpster up‚Äôs truck break down and told me they would pick it up Tuesday. Tuesday they tell me they are busy and Wednesday 7/1 it will be picked up for sure. Then on Wednesday I call back and they said they have no order on file to pick up the dumpster so it will be the week after Monday on 7/6 and the person I talked to is on vacation after constantly reminding them I need the space back where the dumpster is sitting in the driveway!"
