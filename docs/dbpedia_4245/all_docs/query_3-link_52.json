        "text": "Last October, I participated in the 71st Annual Nags Head Surf Fishing Club’s (NHSFC) Invitational Tournament, alongside club president Dave Masters. During those wild two days of competitive fishing, I learned about another long-standing Outer Banks fishing tradition, the Fritz Boyden Memorial Youth Fishing Tournament, a catch-and-release event for kids ages 4 to 16.\n\nFast forward eight months, and my husband and I are enjoying an amazing day on the ocean piers, marveling at the young boys and girls as they land fish, and rush to nearby scorekeepers for measuring. The excitement these kids experienced, in four short hours, was priceless.\n\nWho is Fritz Boyden?\n\nAs I donned my free T-shirt that morning, emblazoned with tournament logos, I wondered: Who is Fritz Boyden? Fritz Boyden’s grandson Joe White, a retired commercial fisherman, gave me the answer. “He was the ultimate angler, a true gentleman, and someone who always had time for folks, especially kids.” He was also a past president of the Outer Banks Chamber of Commerce, a member of the NHSFC for over 30 years, and the author of a daily fishing report at the Outer Banks Pier. A popular saying on the pier, “One’s a run, two’s a blitz. If you don’t believe me, just ask Fritz.”\n\nIn 1971, that love of fishing inspired Fritz Boyden to start the Youth Fishing Tournament. As Fritz would say, “If you take kids fishing, they will never get in trouble.” The rest may be history, but there is so much more. Fritz Boyden’s wife, Libby, was also a local legend. She won surfcasting contests and tournaments for decades and was a founding member of the NC Sea Hags Surf Fishing Team.\n\nFritz Boyden presents trophy to Jason Sadler for largest fish, 21-1//4” blue (1970s)\n\nGoing Strong, 53 Years Later (one year lost to Covid)\n\nFrom awards ceremonies held in the parking lot of Restaurant, by George–the birthplace of free hotdogs–to the beautiful banquet hall at Jennette’s Pier, this event has evolved into a top-notch tournament. At 8:00 a.m. sharp, anglers cast from Jennette’s, Avalon, Nags Head, and Outer Banks Piers, with free access granted by the generous owners and operators. Lines are out of the water at noon. Then the pilgrimage to Jennette’s Pier begins.\n\nWith spectacular views, Jennette’s Pier’s banquet hall is where Dave Masters Jr. served as the Master of Ceremony. Dave described his role as “The most rewarding experience while serving on the NHSFC Board.” His father, Dave Masters Sr. was the Master of Ceremonies for many years. Dave humbly added, “I don’t hold a candle to my father, but it’s an honor to follow in his footsteps. I’m fortunate to have a front-row view of all those happy kids’ faces.” You can see photos of those happy kids’ faces on Facebook. Just go to Nags Head Youth Fishing Tournament.\n\nDave Masters, Master of Ceremony; Tony Garrett, Youth Tournament Director\n\nQ&A WITH TONY GARRETT, YOUTH TOURNAMENT DIRECTOR, NHSFC MEMBER\n\nTo share highlights, winners’ names, stats, and the people-power behind this popular event, I interviewed retired Kitty Hawk Police Department Lieutenant, Tony Garrett. Tom Burke passed the baton (and a shoebox with old photos) to Tony 25 years ago. How times have changed!\n\nIs this the largest youth fishing tournament of its kind?\n\nTo my knowledge, this is the largest youth fishing tournament held on ocean piers. What’s unique is that we have four piers within a 12-mile span, Avalon Pier, Nags Head Pier, Jennette’s Pier, and Outer Banks Pier.\n\nHow many kids participated in the tournament this year?\n\n333 kids registered this year. 241 registered in 2023, so quite a few more came out. Back in 2002, one year before Hurricane Isabel destroyed the Kitty Hawk Pier, we had approximately 500 kids participate in this tournament. That was the largest event to date.\n\nWhere do the kids come from?\n\nWe had 186 youth anglers from out-of-state and 147 that were local. In total, participants came from nine different states. Out-of-state participants plan their vacations around this tournament.\n\nIs there a registration fee?\n\nNo. Everything is free, including T-shirts, Fishbite bait, and lunch, thanks to the many people and organizations that sponsored this event. See the complete Sponsor and Volunteer list below.\n\nAre there any rules the kids have to follow?\n\nYes. This tournament not only brings families together for a morning of competitive fun, but it also is an opportunity for parents to set a good example. A handout explains what is expected during the tournament, to keep everything honest and fair. The majority of the work must be accomplished by the youth angler–casting, hooking, and landing the fish. Others can help remove a hook, but the child must present the fish to the scorekeeper.\n\nWhat are some of the biggest changes you’ve made to this tournament over the years?\n\nSome of the biggest changes included dividing the kids into two age groups, 4- to 9-year-olds and 10- to 16-year-olds. And then, I made it so that they could win by the largest of 12 species, not just one overall largest fish. After that was done, I further divided the groups into girls and boys, so there were even more chances to win. And we still have the largest game fish winner overall, who receives a special rod/reel and the largest trophy.\n\nAnother big change was in 2012, when we offered all the kids free T-shirts. Around that same time, we started providing food at the awards ceremony. The most recent change, to jumpstart the tournament after Covid, was adding cash to the tackle boxes. That’s been a really big hit!\n\nWhich species of fish are scorable?\n\nTwo categories of fish were caught off the piers–game fish and trash fish. Only game fish were scored…black and red drum, triggerfish or spadefish, speckled or gray trout, flounder, drum, sea mullet, croaker, spot, bluefish, pigfish, and Spanish mackerel. Those that were not scored include skates, sting rays, and sharks.\n\nWhat were the most common fish running that day?\n\nBeautiful conditions–weather and tides–were in our favor, which brought in plenty of fish. Scorekeepers were definitely kept on their toes.\n\nI understand there were fish that fell into the “Exemplary/Outstanding Catch” category. What type of fish were they?\n\nHayleigh Flowers caught a 30\" Remora off Nags Head Pier. That was a usual species since they are typically found hitching a ride on larger fish, like sharks and whales. Chloe Artz landed a 15 Sheep’s Head. JP Gary brought in an 8-3/4\" Sand Perch off of Jennette’s Pier. See the complete list of Winning Youth Anglers below.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about his tournament?\n\nI enjoyed seeing the smiling faces of our next generation of anglers. And then at the awards ceremony, I enjoyed seeing how excited the kids got. They were ecstatic, hoping to win a trophy, rod/reel combo, and door prizes.\n\nFor door prizes, we had 50 tackle boxes. Each had $10, $20, $50 or $100 inside, $1,500 total. Kids pick a name out of a bucket, it’s luck of the draw. I see their faces light up when they open the box. The audience cheers on the winners and fellow anglers high-five newfound friends.\n\nThen the winners of the largest fish (by species), largest fish (overall), and unusual (exemplary) fish received one of 30 trophies and 30 rod/reel combos. It’s all free, which you can’t beat.\n\nBut while giveaways, trophies, and prizes are terrific, the kids benefit from this tournament in many other ways. Some youngsters have never seen the ocean. Others have never fished. It’s an educational, fun-filled experience that can spark a lifelong love of angling, and the Outer Banks. And family members bond, they make a connection, as they enjoy nature and the great outdoors. So, what do I enjoy most about this tournament? Helping children and their families build memories that will last a lifetime.\n\nWhen is next year’s tournament?\n\nNext year’s tournament will be on Wednesday, June 11, 2025. Hope to see you all there. Bring a friend!\n\n“The good book says for every day you fish the good Lord gives you another day.”\n\n– Fritz Boyden\n\nWINNING YOUTH ANGLERS\n\n4- to 9-Year-Old Age Group\n\nJensen Berger, Jennette’s Pier, Drum, 4 3/4\"\n\nNoah Dixon, Jennette’s Pier, Spanish mackerel, 19\"\n\nMax Patton, Jennette’s Pier, Blue Fish, 14 1/2\"\n\nRobbie Hurley, Jennette’s Pier, Flounder, 16\"\n\nUriah Brooks, Male, Nags Head Pier, Sea Mullet, 13\"\n\nDylan Gray, Jennette’s Pier, Croaker, 12\"\n\nWilliam Weaver, Avalon Pier, Spot, 8\"\n\nJackson Bair, Avalon Pier, Spot, 8\"\n\nEllie Newns, Avalon Pier, Spot, 8\"\n\nJackson Bair, Avalon Pier, Trigger Fish, 9 1/4\"\n\nEllie Newns, Avalon Pier, Pig Fish, 7 1/2\"\n\nBrayden Delp, Jennette’s Pier, Pig Fish, 7 1/2\"\n\nDecker Murphy, Jennette’s Pier, Pig Fish, 7 1/2\"\n\nBrynll Pitsch, Jennette’s Pier, Pig Fish, 7 1/2\"\n\nLargest Fish – Female Angler\n\nJosephine Brophy, Avalon Pier, Flounder, 13\"\n\nLargest Fish – Male Angler\n\nNoah Nixon, Jennette’s Pier, Spanish mackerel, 19\"\n\nExemplary Catch\n\nJ P Gary, Jennette’s Pier, Sand Perch, 8 3/4\"\n\nWinning Youth Anglers: 4- to 9-Year-Olds\n\n10- to 16-Year-Old Age Group\n\nRyder Dutt, Nags Head Pier, Spanish mackerel, 22\"\n\nRhett Powell, Jennette’s Pier, Blue Fish, 22 1/4 \"\n\nColton Hopkins, Jennette’s Pier, Trout, 13\"\n\nLiam Groese, Avalon Pier, Flounder, 16\"\n\nNola Byrne, Avalon Pier, Sea Mullet, 13\"\n\nLuke Powell, Jennette’s Pier, Croaker, 7 1/2 in\n\nJazlyn Simpson, Avalon Pier, Spot, 8 1/4 in\n\nEvelyn Hoachlander, Jennette’s Pier, Triggerfish, 11 1/2\"\n\nLuke Powell, Jennette’s Pier, Pig Fish, 7 3/4\"\n\nRhett Powell, Jennette’s Pier, Pig Fish, 7 3/4\"\n\nLargest Fish - Female Angler\n\nMaggie Beacham, Jennette’s Pier, Blue Fish, 20 3/4\"\n\nLargest Fish – Male Angler\n\nRhett Powell, Jennette’s Pier, Blue Fish, 22 1/4\"\n\nExemplary Catch\n\nHayleigh Flowers, Nags Head Pie, Remora Fish, 30\"\n\nChloe Artz, Nags Head Pier, Sheepshead, 15\"\n\nOverall Winner\n\nRhett Powell, Jennette’s Pier, Blue Fish, 22 1/4\"\n\nWinning Youth Anglers: 10- to 16-Year-Olds\n\nSponsors (in alphabetical order)\n\nDominion Energy (Kitty Hawk)\n\nFishbites\n\nJK Design and Marine Solutions (custom goods)\n\nKelly’s Hospitality Group (catering service)\n\nNags Head Surf Fishing Club\n\nNC Beach Buggy Association (NCBBA)\n\nNC Sea Hags (Ladies Surf Fishing Team)\n\nOceans East Bait and Tackle\n\nOuter Banks Anglers Club\n\nOuter Banks Visitors Bureau\n\nPier Owners/ Operators (Avalon, Nags Head, Jennette’s, Outer Banks)\n\nTW’S Bait & Tackle (Kitty Hawk)\n\nWalmart Supercenter (Kitty Hawk)\n\nDominion Energy (Kitty Hawk) Volunteers\n\nOuter Banks Anglers Club Volunteers\n\nVolunteers (in alphabetical order)\n\nGreg Cremia, NHSFC, Awards Ceremony Photographer\n\nTony Garrett, NHSFC, Jennette’s Pier Captain\n\nCandi George, NHSF, Registration and help at Jennette’s pier\n\nBobby Halstead, NHSFC, Outer Banks Pier Captain\n\nRose Lay, NHSFC, Nags Head Pier Captain & Chief Scorekeeper\n\nDave Masters, Jr., President NHSFC, Master of Ceremonies, Facebook\n\nPaula Masters, NHSFC, Photographer, Awards Ceremony Organizer\n\nCarol Mowers, NCBBA, Avalon Pier Captain\n\nDenine Phillips, NHSFC, Roving Reporter, Photographer\n\nAllison Rucker, NHSFC, Trophies\n\nBanquet Hall Duty: Lee Barret, Charlie Burroughs, Rob Crawford, Tony Garrett, Candi George, Bobby Halstead, Dave Masters, Paula Masters, Walter Nein, Denine Phillips, John Phillips, Sammy Thorton, Ruth Thorton\n\n6:30am registration begins\n\nFishbites for all!\n\nShowin' some love for fishing\n\nPrize-winning flounder!\n\nLargest fish???\n\nGetting in the spirit\n\nFlounder gather-rounder\n\nNice spadefish!\n\nHappy young anglers!"
