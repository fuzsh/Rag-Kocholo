        "text": "Since the early days of Christianity, it was generally accepted that a person could be either a Jew or a Christian, but not both. This, however, changed in the late nineteenth century. Yitzhak Leib Josowitz was a young Jewish man who studied at Hungary’s top Hasidic yeshiva. Shortly after migrating to America in the early 1890s he converted, was ordained as a priest, changed his name to Leopold Cohn, and became a missionary. Building on his extensive Talmudic and Christian knowledge and seeking to excel in his new career, Cohn proposed a new approach. He encouraged Jews to retain their identity, traditions, and sacred texts but to adopt Jesus as their messiah. This, he claimed, would not only make them better Jews but would also win them a higher spiritual status than people who were born Christians. He began his missionary work in Brownsville and later moved his operation to Williamsburg, where many former Hungarian Jews lived. By virtue of his “new formula” and by employing a sophisticated public relations network, Cohn convinced many Christians to donate to his mission, which he called “The Chosen People.” He promoted his ideas through booklets and through two monthly magazines, one intended for Christians and the other, which included a Yiddish section, for Jews, and by the turn of the twentieth century, his institute became the most successful mission among the Jews in America. In return for listening to his sermons, Cohn’s mission helped many thousands of needy Jewish immigrants. It offered English lessons to the newcomers, and its sewing school helped young women to acquire a sought-after profession; its nursery enabled young parents to go out to work, and its clinic offered free medical consultation. In his many lectures to Christian audiences, Cohn reminded them that Jews were their elder brothers and condemned every form of antisemitism. He was also a firm supporter of the Zionist movement.\n\nThis study attempts to explain why so many East-Central European Jewish international jurists played such cardinal roles in the elaboration of some of the most important treaties of modern international law post World War II. Borrowing from the biographies of Jacob Robinson, Isaac Lewin, Hersch Lauterpacht, Georg Cohn and others who served as key drafters of treaties such as the 4th Geneva Convention for Civilians and the 1951 Refugee Convention, the paper points to structural similarities between Talmudic law and international law, which help further explain the evident ‘Jewish disproportion’ in the making of many of the international system’s bedrock treaties post World War II. It argues that the biographical combination of Talmudic and rabbinical jurisprudence, coupled with a secular education in public international law, which was biographically mutual to most of these jurists helped them to fulfil the important drafting roles they undertook in the making of these treaties."
