However, microscopic examination of Heinz bodies has several disadvantages, demonstrating the need for a better method. We explored the potential use of flow cytometry to examine Heinz bodies. Whole-blood samples were collected from patients deficient in G6PD and healthy volunteers. Acetylphenylhydrazine was used to induce formation of Heinz bodies in red blood cells (RBCs). Then, RBCs positive for Heinz bodies were examined using a FACSCanto II cytometer. RBCs treated with acetylphenylhydrazine formed Heinz bodies and emitted a broad spectrum of fluorescence that could be detected by flow cytometry. The maximum emission of fluorescence was observed at 45Â min after the incubation with acetylphenylhydrazine. In addition, the fluorescence emitted was stable for at least 72Â h. The flow cytometer could detect the RBCs positive for Heinz bodies even if they made up as little as 0.1% of the total RBC population. Furthermore, the percentage and number, respectively, of RBCs positive for Heinz bodies in G6PD-deficient patients and normal donors exhibited a meanÂ Â±Â standard deviation (SD) of 68.9Â Â±Â 27.5 vs. 50.9Â Â±Â 28.6 and 96Â 014Â Â±35Â 732 cells/Î¼L vs. 74Â 688Â Â±Â 36Â 514 cells/Î¼L. Heinz bodies induced by acetylphenylhydrazine emit fluorescence, and this fluorescence could be examined using flow cytometry. Our study suggests the potential use of the developed method to investigate the formation of Heinz bodies in clinical samples. Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n\nHeinz L.

He died at his home in Burlington, Vermont, on June 22, 2006, at the age of 101 years. Alfred Adler's influence led Ansbacher to the field of psychology, where he began a lifelong scholarship on the psychology of Alfred Adler. Among Heinz's distinctions and honors were being named a Fulbright lecturer at the University of Kiel, Germany, and serving as president of the North American Society of Adlerian Psychology.

A definite cause-and-effect relationship between skunk musk and oxidative erythrocyte damage has not been reported, but it was suspected in one reported case of a dog with Heinz body hemolytic anemia. The objective was to determine whether skunk musk induces oxidative HGB damage in vitro. Plasma and RBC were harvested from heparinized blood of 3 dogs, 3 cats, and a Red Panda. Skunk musk was solubilized in ethanol and mixed with plasma from each species to make stock solutions of 4% musk and 4% ethanol. Aliquots of RBC were resuspended in autologous stock solutions and solvent controls to yield musk concentrations of 0%, 0.04%, and 0.4% (by volume). Aliquots were incubated at 37Â°C for 4-72 hours and assessed for oxidative damage by visual inspection, optical absorbance spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and light microscopy after Wright and vital New Methylene Blue staining. Dose-dependent brown color and absorption changes characteristic of methemoglobin were present by 4 hours and increased over 24 hours (Red Panda) and 72 hours (dog and cat). Similarly, there were time-dependent (all species) and dose-dependent (dog and cat) increases in the number of Heinz bodies, which were present by 4 hours and numerous by 24 hours. In vitro, skunk musk causes Heinz body and methemoglobin formation in canine, feline, and Red Panda RBC, supporting the clinical association between Heinz body hemolytic anemia and skunk spray exposure.

With the 5th International Heinz von Foerster Conference convened at the occasion of von Foerster's 100th birthday, the organizers opted for a twin conference to take place at the Large and Small Ceremonial Halls of the University's main building, respectively. The overall topic was chosen as 'Self-Organization and Emergence', a topic to which von Foerster was an early contributor. While the first conference ('Self-Organization and Emergence in Nature and Society') addressed a more general audience, the second one ('Emergent Quantum Mechanics') was intended as a specialist meeting with a contemporary topic that could both serve as an illustration of von Foerster's intellectual heritage and, more generally, point towards future directions in physics. We thus intended to bring together many of those physicists who are interested in or are working on attempts to understand quantum mechanics as emerging from a suitable classical (or, more generally, deeper level) physics. EmerQuM11 was organized by the Austrian Institute for Nonlinear Studies (AINS), with essential support from the Wiener Institute for Social Science Documentation and Methodology (WISDOM), the Department of Contemporary History at the University of Vienna, and the Heinz von Foerster-Gesellschaft. There were a number of individuals who contributed to the smooth course of our meeting and whom I would like to sincerely thank: Christian Bischof, Thomas Elze, Marianne Ertl, Gertrud Hafner, Werner Korn, Angelika Krawanja, Florian Krug and his team, Sonja Lang, Albert MÃ¼ller, Ilse MÃ¼ller, Irene MÃ¼ller, Karl MÃ¼ller, Armin Reautschnig, Marion Schirrmacher, Anton Staudinger, Roman Zlabinger, and, last but not least, my AINS colleagues Siegfried Fussy, Herbert Schwabl and Johannes Mesa\n\nSevere Heinz body anemia and methemoglobinemia in a kitten with chronic diarrhea.\n\nPubMed\n\nCavana, P; Irato, E; Miniscalco, B; Gianella, P\n\n2018-04-01\n\nA 2-month-old kitten was referred for depression and partial anorexia since 3 days and chronic diarrhea lasting for over 3 weeks. General physical examination showed pale and cyanotic mucous membranes. Blood sample was of brownish appearance. Venous blood gas analysis and complete blood count showed 16% methemoglobin level and severe regenerative anemia with Heinz bodies in about 40% of the erythrocytes, respectively. The kitten was transfused with fresh whole blood and treated with supportive care, antimicrobial and antioxidant agents. The kitten totally recovered. To the authors' knowledge, this represents the first case report of severe Heinz body hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia with concurrent chronic diarrhea in a young kitten. Diarrhea resolution coincided with Heinz bodies and methemoglobin disappearance. The possibility that diarrhea might have stimulated an inflammatory state causing release of oxygen radicals and prolonged erythrocytes oxidative damage has been discussed.\n\nFeeding the masses: H.J.

Goldberger Professor of Physics at Caltech, had taken his own life the night before. He had succumbed to the severe depression that he had suffered from for many years, unbeknownst to even his closest colleagues. Lange will perhaps be best remembered as the co-leader of Boomerang, the balloon-borne experiment that provided the first high-angular-resolution map of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). And while this was certainly his most notable achievement, Andrew amassed a record of accomplishment as an instrumentalist, leader, mentor, and communicator that extended much further. Andrew was born in Urbana, Illinois on July 23, 1957, the son of an architect and a librarian, and raised primarily in Connecticut. His family and early friends remember him as a serious and extremely intelligent child and young man. Andrew Lange's lifelong interest in the CMB was nurtured as an undergraduate at Princeton University by David Wilkinson, and he recalled fondly a summer spent working with John Mather at Goddard Space Flight Center. Andrew Lange went to graduate school in physics at Berkeley where he worked in Paul Richards' group. Although his thesis project, the Berkeley-Nagoya rocket experiment, showed an anomalous sub-millimeter excess in the CMB spectrum that was shortly thereafter shown by a later flight of the same rocket and COBE-FIRAS to be incorrect, Lange's talents were recognized by the physics department at Berkeley who appointed him shortly after his PhD (1987) to their faculty. While on the Berkeley faculty, Andrew obtained early detections of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, upper limits to small-angle CMB fluctuations, and important infrared constraints to the interstellar medium. He also led a pioneering instrument operating 300 mK detectors for a small infrared satellite experiment. This early work showed high ambition and daring, and it pioneered\n\nIsgur-Karl model revisited\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGaleta, Leonardo; Pirjol, Dan; Schat, Carlos\n\n2009-12-01\n\nWe show how to match the Isgur-Karl model to the spin-flavor quark operator expansion used in the 1/N{sub c} studies of the nonstrange negative parity L=1 excited baryons. Using the transformation properties of states and interactions under the permutation group S{sub 3} we are able to express the operator coefficients as overlap integrals, without making any assumption on the spatial dependence of the quark wave functions. The general mass operator leads to parameter free mass relations and constraints on the mixing angles that are valid beyond the usual harmonic oscillator approximation. The Isgur-Karl model with harmonic oscillator wave functions providesmoreÂ Â» a simple counterexample that demonstrates explicitly that the alternative operator basis for the 1/N{sub c} expansion for excited baryons recently proposed by Matagne and Stancu is incomplete.Â«Â less\n\nX-31 impact site\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1995-01-01\n\nThis photos shows the remains of the number one X-31 following a mishap on 19 January 1995. Two X-31A demonstartor aircraft were built to explore Enhanced Fighter Manueverability (EFM). The aircraft demonstrated techniques to allow close-in aerial combat beyond normal flight envelope parameters. The X-31 EFM demonstrator program was the first international effort to buid an X-plane. The aircraft was designed and funded jointly by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the German Ministry of Defense. Design and construction of components and systems was split between Rockwell International in the United States and Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm (MBB) in the Federal Republic of Germany. Other participants included the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and NASA. Fianl assembly took place at Rockwell's North American Aircraft Division. The flight test progarm included an international team of pilots from Rockwell, MBB, and the U.S. and German armed forces. The demonstrator aircraft were designed for subsonic flight only. Overall program costs were reduced by using as amny off-the-shelf components as possible. The weight of the airframe was reduced through extensive use of graphite/epoxy thermosplastics in construction of aerodynamic surfaces and the forward fuselage. the design included fully movable canards, thrust-vectoring paddles, and a cranked composite delta wing. The first X-31A (Bu. No. 164584) was rolled out from Rockwell's Palmdale, Californai facility on 1 March 1990. Rockwell chief test pilot Norman 'Ken' Dyson made the first flight on 11 October 1990. Aircraft 584 completed a total of 292 flights during the EFM test program. Aircraft 584 was lost on 19 January 1995 while returning to Edwards Air Force Base on its third flight of the day. German test pilot Karl-Heinz Langwas nearing the end of a one-hour mission to measure aircraft parameters. The aircraft was flying at 21,000 feet and 141 knots in straight and level flight with the thrust\n\nCornelia de Lange Syndrome Foundation\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

C.; Cassotto, R.; Amundson, J. M.; Kuo, C. C.; Dennin, M.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nIn tidewater glacial fjords, the open water in front of the glacier terminus is often filled with a collection of calved iceberg fragments and sea ice. For glaciers with large calving rates, this \"mÃ©lange\" of ice can be jam-packed, so that the flow is mostly determined by granular interactions, in addition to underlying fjord currents. As the glacier pushes the ice mÃ©lange through the fjord, the mÃ©lange will become jammed and may potentially influence calving rates if the back-stress applied to the glacier terminus is large enough. However, the stress applied by a granular ice mÃ©lange will depend on its rheology, i.e. iceberg-iceberg contact forces, geometry, friction, etc. Here we report 2D, discrete particle simulations to model the granular mechanics of ice mÃ©lange. A polydisperse collection of particles is packed into a long channel and pushed downfjord at a constant speed, the latter derived from terrestrial radar interferometry (TRI). Each individual particle experiences viscoelastic contact forces and tangential frictional forces upon collision with another particle or channel walls. We find the two most important factors that govern the total force applied to the glacier are the geometry of the channel, and the shape of the particles. In addition, our simulated velocity fields reveal shearing margins near the fjord walls with more uniform flow in the middle of the mÃ©lange, consistent with TRI observations. Finally, we find that the magnitude of the back-stress applied to the glacier terminus can influence calving, however, the maximum back-stress is limited by the buckling of icebergs into the fjord waters, so that the stress in the quasi-2D mÃ©lange is partially determined by the thickness of the mÃ©lange layer.\n\n\"Unmapped Territories\": The Career of Karl Kroeber (1926-2009)\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nRuoff, A.

We studied the erythrocyte inclusions in blood specimens collected from six juvenile and nine adult specimens of the loggerhead turtle, Caretta caretta, from the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian Seas. Our study indicates that the percentage of mature erythrocytes containing inclusions ranged from 3 to 82%. Each erythrocyte contained only one round inclusion body. Inclusion bodies stained with May GrÃ¼nwald-Giemsa show that their cytochemical and ultrastructure characteristics are identical to those of human Heinz bodies. Because Heinz bodies originate from the precipitation of unstable hemoglobin (Hb) and cause globular osmotic resistance to increase, we analyzed loggerhead Hb using electrophoresis and high-performance liquid chromatography to detect and quantitate Hb fractions. We also tested the resistance of Hb to alkaline pH, heat, isopropanol denaturation, and globular osmosis. Our hemogram results excluded the occurrence of any infection, which could be associated with an inclusion body, in all the specimens. Negative Feulgen staining indicated that the inclusion bodies are not derived from DNA fragmentation. We hypothesize that amino acid substitutions could explain why loggerhead Hb precipitates under normal physiologic conditions, forming Heinz bodies. The identification of inclusion bodies in loggerhead erythrocytes allow us to better understand the haematological characteristics and the physiology of these ancient reptiles, thus aiding efforts to conserve such an endangered species.

J.; Rowe, C. D.; Ujiie, K.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nWithin the shallow (<10 km depth) portion of subduction zones, tectonic mÃ©langes are produced by distributed shear within downgoing sediments above the oceanic plate. Basaltic slabs (incorporated into the sediments through plucking and underplating) and sandstone layers form boudins within a shale dominated matrix due to strength contrasts within this zone of distributed shear. These tectonic mÃ©langes are the host rocks of seismicity in subduction zones at shallow depths. Fluidized gouge and pseudotachylytes are evidence for paleoseismicity within exposures of mÃ©langes, and occur preferentially along the contacts between shale matrix mÃ©lange and sandstone or basaltic layers. Detailed mapping within the Mugi MÃ©lange, Japan has revealed basalt boudins enclosed by a cataclasite matrix derived from basalt. We model the stress concentrations around the strong basaltic boudins and slabs using the Power-Law Creep (PLC) toolbox developed at the University of Maine, which uses Asymptotic Expansion Homogenization (AEH) over a finite element mesh to determine the instantaneous stress distributions in a multiphase system. We model the shale matrix mÃ©lange to be deforming through a modified flow law for viscous creep based on coupled frictional sliding and pressure solution, where at a strain rate of 10-12 s-1 the flow stress is 10 MPa under the temperature (190 ÂºC) and pressure ( 100 MPa) conditions during deformation, and describe the behaviour of the basaltic blocks using experimentally-derived power law flow laws. The results show that at the strain rates calculated based on plate-rate motion, differential stresses high enough to cause comminution of the basalts ( 300 MPa) correspond strongly to areas around the blocks with basalt derived cataclasites. Within the basalt derived cataclasites, thin zones of ultracataclasite record localized slip. We hypothesize that the heterogeneous stress distributions within subduction mÃ©langes: 1) fractures the strong basalt\n\nReflections on Lifelong Education and the School: Brief Papers and Notes Containing Some Thoughts on the Theory and Application of Lifelong Education as Seen in the Context of School Curriculum, Adult Education and Similar Areas.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nDave, R.

However, limitations in transcribing risk stratification algorithms based on American cohort studies into European populations have been acknowledged in the past. Moreover, data on implications for reclassification into higher- or lower-risk groups based on CAC scores were lacking. The Heinz Nixdorf Recall (HNR) study is a population-based cohort study that investigated the ability of CAC scoring in risk prediction for major cardiovascular events above and beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors. According to Heinz Nixdorf Recall findings, CAC can be used for reclassification, especially in those in the intermediate-risk group, to advise on lifestyle changes for the reclassified low-risk category, or to implement intensive treatments for the reclassified high-risk individuals. This article discusses the present findings of the Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study with respect to the current literature, risk stratification algorithms, and current European guidelines for risk prediction.\n\n[Auditory function in children with Brachmann-de Lange syndrom].\n\nPubMed\n\nKozÅowski, Jacek; Wierzba, Jolanta; Narozny, Waldemar; Balcerska, Anna; Stankiewicz, CzesÅaw; Kuczkowski, Jerzy\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThe aim of the research work is the evaluation of auditory function in children with rare, genetically determined Brachmann-de Lange syndrome. Test material came from 18 children (7 girls and 11 boys) between 11 months and 18 years of age with Brachmann-de Lange syndrome who have been diagnosed and treated at ENT Department and Department of Paediatrics, Haematology, Oncology and Endocrinology Medical University of Gdansk with support of Cornelia de Lange Association - Poland. In all children examinations of brainstem auditory evoked potential have been carried out as well as tympanometric examination in case of finding hearing loss. All these examinations were carried out in ENT Department of Medical University of Gdansk, using Racia-Alvar Centor C apparatus and Madsen-Zodiak 901. 9 (50%) of patients demonstrated hearing loss. In 3 (16.7%) cases the conduction hearing loss was connected with the chronic diseases of middle ear which required medical treatment. In remaining 6 (33.3%) cases due to sensorineural hearing loss children had hearing aids applied and underwent rehabilitation. The results indicate that all children with Brachmann-de Lange syndrome should undergo examinations of brainstem auditory evoked potential. It enables to detect hypoacusis and initiate proper treatment. Lack of the opportunity of having a hearing aid applied and further rehabilitation deepens the social isolation of the little patients and inhibits their natural progress in communication. In such cases mental retardation may subsequently occur.\n\nKarl Marx and the Environment\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nShifferd, K.

A.; Codegone, G.; Ogata, K.\n\n2012-09-01\n\nThe terms mÃ©lange and broken formation have been used in different ways in the literature. The lack of agreement on their definition often leads to confusion and misinterpretations. An evaluation of the various uses of these terms allows us to consider several types of chaotic rock bodies originated by tectonic, sedimentary and diapiric processes in different tectonic settings. Our review of stratal disruption and mixing processes shows that there exists a continuum of deformation structures and processes in the generation of mÃ©langes and broken formations. This continuum is directly controlled by the increase of the degree of consolidation with burial. In tectonically active environments, at the shallow structural levels, the occurrence of poorly consolidated sediments favors gravitational deformation. At deeper structural levels, the deformation related to tectonic forces becomes gradually more significant with depth. Sedimentary (and diapiric) mÃ©langes and broken formations represent the products of punctuated stratal disruption mechanisms recording the instantaneous physical conditions in the geological environment at the time of their formation. The different kinematics, the composition and lithification degree of sediments, the geometry and morphology of the basins, and the mode of failure propagation control the transition between different types of mass-transported chaotic bodies, the style of stratal disruption, and the amount of rock mixing. Tectonically broken formations and mÃ©langes record a continuum of deformation that occurs through time and different degrees of lithification during a progressive increase of the degree of consolidation and of the diagenetic and metamorphic mineral transformation. Systematic documentation of the mechanisms and processes of the formation of different broken formations and mÃ©langes and their interplay in time and space are highly important to increase the understanding of the evolutionary history of accretionary\n\nControls on accretion of flysch and mÃ©lange belts at convergent margins: Evidence from the Chugach Bay thrust and Iceworm mÃ©lange, Chugach accretionary wedge, Alaska\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKusky, Timothy M.; Bradley, Dwight C.; Haeussler, Peter J.; Karl, Sue\n\n1997-12-01\n\nControls on accretion of flysch and mÃ©lange terranes at convergent margins are poorly understood. Southern Alaska's Chugach terrane forms the outboard accretionary margin of the Wrangellia composite terrane, and consists of two major lithotectonic units, including Triassic-Cretaceous mÃ©lange of the McHugh Complex and Late Cretaceous flysch of the Valdez Group. The contact between the McHugh Complex and the Valdez Group on the Kenai Peninsula is a tectonic boundary between chaotically deformed melange of argillite, chert, greenstone, and graywacke of the McHugh Complex and a less chaotically deformed mÃ©lange of argillite and graywacke of the Valdez Group. We assign the latter to a new, informal unit of formational rank, the Iceworm mÃ©lange, and interpret it as a contractional fault zone (Chugach Bay thrust) along which the Valdez Group was emplaced beneath the McHugh Complex. The McHugh Complex had already been deformed and metamorphosed to prehnite-pumpellyite facies prior to formation of the Iceworm mÃ©lange. The Chugach Bay thrust formed between 75 and 55 Ma, as shown by Campanian-Maastrichtian depositional ages of the Valdez Group, and fault-related fabrics in the Iceworm mÃ©lange that are cut by Paleocene dikes. Motion along the Chugach Bay thrust thus followed Middle to Late Cretaceous collision (circa 90-100 Ma) of the Wrangellia composite terrane with North America. Collision related uplift and erosion of mountains in British Columbia formed a submarine fan on the Farallon plate, and we suggest that attempted subduction of this fan dramatically changed the subduction/accretion style within the Chugach accretionary wedge. We propose a model in which subduction of thinly sedimented plates concentrates shear strains in a narrow zone, generating mÃ©langes like the McHugh in accretionary complexes. Subduction of thickly sedimented plates allows wider distribution of shear strains to accommodate plate convergence, generating a more coherent accretionary style\n\nH. J.

The precursor disturbance to Karl originated from a cluster of showers east of the Windward Islands and was well sampled by ongoing field campaigns, particularly the PRE-Depression Investigation of Cloud-systems in the Tropics (PREDICT), as the targeted disturbance progressed westward. While traditional genesis theories focusing on moisture and mass fields (e.g. top-down showerhead method) can explain the initial spin-up of the disturbance several days prior to its official genesis, additional perspectives are examined in concert with more traditional methods in order to provide a more complete analysis of the synoptic-scale patterns that influenced the pre-Karl disturbance. A surge of westerly winds from northern South America aids the initial spin-up of the pre-Karl disturbance on 8-9 September, leading to the formation of a nearly closed earth-relative circulation. It can be shown that these anomalous westerly winds are tied to the convectively active phase of a convectively coupled Kelvin wave (CCKW). The observed formation of the nearly closed circulation on 10 September is well timed with the passage of this convectively active phase, a relationship that has been shown to hold true in cases of CCKW-TC interactions around the globe. Physically, the CCKW increases deep convection and aids in the generation of low-level relative vorticity on the cyclonic shear side of the low-level westerly wind anomalies, both of which serve to help organize the pre-Karl disturbance. Finally, the passage of the CCKW coincides with an equatorward surge of cold air and southerly winds in the lee of the Andes, triggered by a passing mid-latitude disturbance on 31 August. As the surge passes the equator on 7 September, little temperature perturbation remains with the surge, but terrain-channeled low-level flow\n\nThe Ankara MÃ©lange: an indicator of Tethyan evolution of Anatolia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nÃakir, Ãner; Ãner, Tijen\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThe Ankara MÃ©lange is a complex formed by imbricated slices of limestone block mÃ©langes (Karakaya and HisarlÄ±kaya Formations), Neotethyan ophiolites (Eldivan, Ahlat and Edige ophiolites), post-ophiolitic cover units (Mart and Kavak formations) and Tectonic MÃ©lange Unit (HisarkÃ¶y Formation or DerekÃ¶y MÃ©lange). The Karakaya and HisarlÄ±kaya formations are roughly similar and consist mainly of limestone block mÃ©lange. Nevertheless, they represent some important geological differences indicating different geological evolution. Consequently, the Karakaya and HisarlÄ±kaya formations are interpreted as Eurasian and Gondwanian marginal units formed by fragmentation of the Gondwanian carbonate platform during the continental rifting of the Neotethys in the Middle Triassic time. During the latest Triassic, Neotethyan lithosphere began to subduct beneath the Eurasian continent and caused intense deformation of the marginal units. The Eldivan, Ahlat and Edige ophiolites represent different fragments of the Neotethyan oceanic lithosphere emplaced onto the Gondwanian margin during the Albian-Aptian, middle Turonian and middle Campanian, respectively. The Eldivan Ophiolite is a NE-SW trending and a nearly complete assemblage composed, from bottom to top, of a volcanic-sedimentary unit, a metamorphic unit, peridotite tectonites, cumulates and sheeted dykes. The Eldivan Ophiolite is unconformably covered by Cenomanian-Lower Turonian sedimentary unit. The Eldivan Ophiolite is overthrust by the Ahlat Ophiolite in the north and Edige Ophiolite in the west. The Ahlat ophiolite is an east-west oriented assemblage comprised of volcanic-sedimentary unit, metamorphic unit, peridotite tectonites and cumulates. The Edige Ophiolite consists of a volcanic-sedimentary unit, peridotite tectonites, dunite, wherlite, pyroxenite and gabbro cumulates. The Tectonic MÃ©lange Unit is a chaotic formation of various blocks derived from ophiolites, from the Karakaya and HisarlÄ±kaya formations and\n\nOrographic Modification of Precipitation Processes in Hurricane Karl (2010)\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDeHart, Jennifer C.; Houze, Robert A.\n\nAirborne radar data collected within Hurricane Karl (2010) provide a high-resolution glimpse of variations in the vertical precipitation structure around complex terrain in eastern Mexico.

Although the airborne radar did not sample the period of peak precipitation, time series of surface rainfall at three locations near the inner core show greater precipitation where flow was oriented to rise over the terrain.

In contrast, regions of downslope flow were characterized by uniform reflectivity above the ground and fallstreaks originating above the melting level. Unlike most previously studied tropical cyclones passing over topography, Karl made landfall on a mountainous continent, not an island. As Karl weakened and decayed over land, the vertical structure of the radar echo deteriorated north of the storm center, and infrared satellite imagery revealed a strong reduction in the upper-level cloud coverage; however, a small region of intense convection appeared and produced locally heavy rainfall as Karl was close to dissipation. In conclusion, these results indicate that orographic modification processes in a landfalling tropical cyclone are not static, and surface precipitation is highly sensitive to the changes.Â«Â less\n\nOrographic Modification of Precipitation Processes in Hurricane Karl (2010)\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nDeHart, Jennifer C.; Houze, Robert A.\n\n2017-10-06\n\nAirborne radar data collected within Hurricane Karl (2010) provide a high-resolution glimpse of variations in the vertical precipitation structure around complex terrain in eastern Mexico.

A newborn presented 2 days after birth with bilateral cloudy corneas, photophobia, and epiphora. We provide a 5-year descriptive history and clinical course with review of the literature on Brachmann-de Lange syndrome. Multiple ocular surgeries were performed for ocular sequelae from aniridia and congenital glaucoma including Ahmed valve placement and penetrating keratoplasties in both eyes. At 5.5 years of age, the child had a clear graft OD and amblyopia from graft failure OS following recurrent graft infections. A review of Brachmann-de Lange syndrome found 43 patients with ocular surface and anterior segment findings. The most common findings included conjunctivitis, blepharitis, microcornea, and corectopia. Aniridia and congenital glaucoma were not previously reported with Brachmann-de Lange syndrome. Ocular surface and anterior segment abnormalities must be considered when examining patients with Brachmann-de Lange syndrome. Ocular findings may include vision-threatening anomalies, as in our case with aniridia and congenital glaucoma. To our knowledge, these findings are previously unreported in Brachmann-de Lange syndrome.\n\nUnusual association of non-anaplastic Wilms tumor and Cornelia de Lange syndrome: case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nSantoro, Claudia; Apicella, Andrea; Casale, Fiorina; La Manna, Angela; Di Martino, Martina; Di Pinto, Daniela; Indolfi, Cristiana; Perrotta, Silverio\n\n2016-06-13\n\nCornelia de Lange syndrome is the prototype for cohesinopathy disorders, which are characterized by defects in chromosome segregation. Kidney malformations, including nephrogenic rests, are common in Cornelia de Lange syndrome. Only one post-mortem case report has described an association between Wilms tumor and Cornelia de Lange syndrome. Here, we describe the first case of a living child with both diseases. Non-anaplastic triphasic nephroblastoma was diagnosed in a patient carrying a not yet reported mutation in NIPBL (c.4920Â Gâ>âA). The patient had the typical facial appearance and intellectual disability associated with Cornelia de Lange syndrome in absence of limb involvement. The child's kidneys were examined by ultrasound at 2Â years of age to exclude kidney abnormalities associated with the syndrome. She underwent pre-operative chemotherapy and nephrectomy. Seven months later she was healthy and without residual detectable disease. The previous report of such co-occurrence, together with our report and previous reports of nephrogenic rests, led us to wonder if there may be any causal relationship between these two rare entities. The wingless/integrated (Wnt) pathway, which is implicated in kidney development, is constitutively activated in approximately 15-20Â % of all non-anaplastic Wilms tumors. Interestingly, the Wnt pathway was recently found to be perturbed in a zebrafish model of Cornelia de Lange syndrome. Mutations in cohesin complex genes and regulators have also been identified in several types of cancers. On the other hand, there is no clear evidence of an increased risk of cancer in Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and no other similar cases have been published since the fist one reported by Cohen, and this prompts to think Wilms tumor and Cornelia de Lange syndrome occurred together in our patient by chance.\n\nLarge-Scale Influences on the Genesis of Tropical Cyclone Karl (2010)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGriffin, K.; Bosart, L. F.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThe events leading up to the genesis of Tropical Cyclone (TC) Karl (2010) provides a unique opportunity to examine the continuing problem of understanding tropical cyclogenesis. The PRE-Depression Investigation of Cloud-systems in the Tropics (PREDICT) field campaign allowed for detailed investigation of the tropical disturbance that served as the precursor to TC Karl as it progressed westward through the Caribbean Sea. The purpose of this presentation is to examine the evolution of the pre-Karl disturbance using both common synoptic-scale analyses as well as statistically-based equatorial wave analyses, focusing on where these analyses complement and enhance each other. One of the major factors in the initial spin-up of the pre-Karl tropical disturbance is a surge of southerly and westerly winds from northern South America on 8-10 September 2010. As the surge entered the Caribbean on 9 September, it aided in the formation of a nearly closed earth-relative cyclonic circulation near the southern Leeward Islands. This circulation weakened late on 10 September and remained weak through 13 September before increased organization led to TC genesis on 14 September. This southerly wind surge can be traced to a well-defined surge of anomalously cold air and enhanced southerly winds originating in the lee of the Argentinian Andes over a week prior. While the temperature anomalies wash out prior to reaching the equator, anomalous low-level winds progress into Colombia and Venezuela, where topography aids in turning the southerly winds eastward. An investigation of the pre-Karl environment utilizing wavenumber-frequency filtering techniques also suggests that the initial spin-up of pre-Karl can be associated with the active phase of a convectively coupled Kelvin wave (CCKW). The observed formation of the nearly closed cyclonic circulation on 10 September is well timed with the passage of anomalous westerly winds along and behind the convectively active phase of a CCKW. These\n\nStructural analysis and shape-preferred orientation determination of the mÃ©lange facies in the ChaÃ±aral mÃ©lange, Las TÃ³rtolas Formation, Coastal Cordillera, northern Chile\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFuentes, Paulina; DÃ­az-Alvarado, Juan; FernÃ¡ndez, Carlos; DÃ­az-Azpiroz, Manuel; RodrÃ­guez, Natalia\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThis study sheds light on the tectonic and structural knowledge of the mÃ©lange facies located to the south of ChaÃ±aral city, Chile. The ChaÃ±aral mÃ©lange has been related to an accretionary prism at the western active continental margin of Gondwana. Based on the fossil content, the original turbidite sequence would have been deposited during Devonian to Carboniferous times. The ChaÃ±aral mÃ©lange is included in the Las TÃ³rtolas Formation, which corresponds to the Paleozoic metasedimentary basement located in the Coastal Range in northern Chile. It consists of a monotonous sequence of more than 90% of interbedded sandstones and shales, with a few limestones, pelagic chert, conglomerates and basic volcanic rocks, metamorphosed to the greenschist facies. In the study area, the Las TÃ³rtolas Formation is divided into two structural domains separated by a major reverse dextral structure, called here the Infieles fault. To the east, the Las TÃ³rtolas Formation is characterized by a brittle-ductile deformation, defined by the original sedimentary contacts in the turbiditic sequence. Besides, thrust faults and associated thrust propagation folds promotes a penetrative axial plane foliation. MÃ©lange facies are located to the west of the Infieles fault. Although lithologies comprising this domain are similar to the rest of the Las TÃ³rtolas Formation, mÃ©lange facies (ductile domain) are characterized by the complete disruption of the original architecture of the turbidite succession. The most significant structures in the mÃ©lange are the ubiquitous boudinage and pinch and swell structures, asymmetric objects, S-C structures and tight to isoclinal folds. This deformation is partitioned in the ChaÃ±aral mÃ©lange between linear fabric domains (L), characterized by quartzite blocks with prolate shape in a phyllite matrix with pencil structures, and linear-planar fabric domains (L-S), where quartzite objects show oblate shape and phyllites present a penetrative foliation\n\nGenetics Home Reference: Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

However, recent observations from marine-terminating glaciers in Greenland indicate that the long-term decline of local sea ice cover has been accompanied by an increase in nearby iceberg calving and associated ice sheet mass loss. Near glacier calving fronts, sea ice binds icebergs together into an aggregate granular material known as iceberg mÃ©lange. Studies have hypothesized that mÃ©lange may suppress calving by exerting a mechanical buttressing force directly on the glacier terminus. Here, we show explicitly how sea ice thickness and concentration play a critical role in setting the material strength of mÃ©lange. To do so, we adapt a discrete element model to simulate mÃ©lange as a cohesive granular material. In these simulations, mÃ©lange laden with thick, dense, landfast sea ice can produce enough resistance to shut down calving at the terminus. When sea ice thins, mÃ©lange weakens, reducing the mechanical force of mÃ©lange on the glacier terminus, and increasing the likelihood of calving. We discuss whether longer periods of sea-ice-free conditions in winter may lead to a transition from currently slow calving, predominantly occurring in the summer, to rapid calving, occurring throughout the year. We also discuss the potential role of freshwater discharge in promoting sea ice formation in fjords, potentially strengthening mÃ©lange.\n\nSome Educational Implications of Karl Marx's Communism\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHellerich, Gert\n\n1970-01-01\n\nAccording to the expressed ideas of Karl Marx, education should be viewed as a means to develop a person's whole potential and to make him a better human being.

In this setting, blocks ranging from centimeters up to â¥100 m in diameter are surrounded by finer-grained matrix that is derived from the blocks. Blocks throughout the mÃ©lange represent a diversity of protoliths derived from basalts, cherts and other sediments, and hydrated mantle, but all contain assemblages consistent with upper amphibolite-facies conditions, suggesting a relatively restricted range of depths and temperatures over which material within the mÃ©lange was metamorphosed. This apparent uniformity of metamorphic grade contrasts with other mÃ©langes, such as the Franciscan Complex, where coexisting rocks with highly variable peak metamorphic grade suggest extensive mixing of materials along the subduction interface. This mixing has been ascribed to flow of material within relatively low viscosity matrix. The Zr content of rutile in samples from across the amphibolite facies mÃ©lange of the Catalina Schist was measured to determine peak metamorphic temperatures, identify whether these temperatures were different among blocks, and whether the spatial distribution of temperatures throughout the mÃ©lange was systematic or random. Resolvably different Zr contents, between 290 and 720 (Â±10-40) ppm, are found among the blocks, corresponding to different peak metamorphic temperatures of 650 to 730 (Â±2-16) Â°C at an assumed pressure of 1 GPa. These results are broadly consistent with previous thermobarometric estimates. No systematic distribution of temperatures was found, however. Like other mÃ©lange zones, material flow within the Catalina Schist mÃ©lange was likely chaotic, but appears to have occurred on a more restricted scale compared to some other localities. Progressive metamorphism of mÃ©lange matrix is expected to produce rheologically stiffer matrix minerals (such as amphiboles and pyroxenes\n\nUnpredictable drug reaction in a child with Cornelia de Lange syndrome.\n\nPubMed\n\nStevic, Marija; Milojevic, Irina; Bokun, Zlatko; Simic, Dusica\n\n2015-02-01\n\nPreoperative use of midazolam sedation is mandatory during induction of anesthesia in noncooperative and hyperactive children to prevent possible obstacles.

The capability for in situ geochronology will open up the ability for geochronology to be accomplished as part of lander or rover complement, on multiple samples rather than just those returned. An in situ geochronology package can also complement sample return missions by identifying the most interesting rocks to cache or return to Earth. The K-Ar Laser Experiment (KArLE) brings together a novel combination of several flight-proven components to provide precise measurements of potassium (K) and argon (Ar) that will enable accurate isochron dating of planetary rocks. KArLE will ablate a rock sample, measure the K in the plasma state using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), measure the liberated Ar using mass spectrometry (MS), and relate the two by measuring the volume of the ablated pit by optical imaging. Our work indicates that the KArLE instrument is capable of determining the age of planetary samples with sufficient accuracy to address a wide range of geochronology problems in planetary science. Additional benefits derive from the fact that each KArLE component achieves analyses useful for most planetary surface missions.\n\n[Cornelia de Lange Syndrome and multiple hormonal deficiency, an unusual association. Clinical case].\n\nPubMed\n\nMora-Bautista, VÃ­ctor M; Mendoza-Rojas, VÃ­ctor; Contreras-GarcÃ­a, Gustavo A\n\n2017-06-01\n\nCornelia de Lange syndrome is a genetic disease characterized by distinctive facial features, failure to thrive, microcephaly and several malformations associated. Its main endocrinological features are anomalies of the genitalia. We present a 13-year-old boy, who suffered from complicated aspiration pneumonia and showed Cornelia de Lange syndrome phenotype, with global developmental delay, suction-swallowing abnormalities, short stature and abnormal genitalia associated. His bone age was delayed, so he underwent full endocrinological panel. Central hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency and low luteinizing hormone-follicle-stimulating hormone levels were observed and multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies diagnosis was made. Basal cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone and prolactin levels were normal. He received thyroid hormonal substitution. Multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies are an unusual feature of De Lange syndrome. We suggest evaluating all different endocrine axes in these patients.

A.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe existence of mÃ©lange diapirs in subduction zones remains controversial. Understanding processes that would lead to diapir formation and ascent is crucial because these features may influence mantle wedge convection and composition, slab-mantle interface rheology, and arc geochemistry. Here, we present a multidisciplinary approach, developed during the 2017 NSF/FESD CIDER II summer workshop, to identify the controls on, and effects of mÃ©lange diapir formation and ascent. We integrate petrologic models, interface rheology estimated from compositions of exhumed rocks, geodynamic models, seismology, and geodesy to investigate mÃ©lange diapirs from \"top to bottom.\" Petrologic modeling shows that sheet silicates such as phengite, biotite, and talc greatly reduce the density of the matrix with progressive metamorphism to high pressures and moderate-to-high temperatures (>5 GPa, 600-1000Â°C). High abundances (>50%) of these three phases may reduce the mÃ©lange's density enough to form buoyant Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities in the downgoing part of the mantle wedge. We are developing geodynamic models informed by metamorphic petrology, and experimental rheologic studies to test the hypothesis that realistic densities and viscosities can generate buoyant upwelling in an active mantle wedge. We test our ability to recognize mÃ©lange diapirs in nature through a variety of techniques. We use the Izu-Bonin Arc as a case study to explore the constraints needed to geochemically identify mÃ©lange melting. Synthetic P-wave receiver functions allow us to predict the seismic signal of mÃ©lange diapirs of various thicknesses, potentially allowing us to seismically image them in modern-day subduction systems. Geodetic forward modeling allows us to constrain the geometric parameters required for diapir ascent through mantle wedge counter flow, and to produce measurable surface deformation. Interdisciplinary approaches, as presented in this study, are essential to the development of\n\nFriedrich Albert Lange on neo-Kantianism, socialist Darwinism, and a psychology without a soul.\n\nPubMed\n\nTeo, Thomas\n\n2002-01-01\n\nFriedrich Albert Lange was a German philosopher, political theorist, educator, and psychologist who outlined an objective psychology in the 1860s. This article shows how some of the most important worldviews of the nineteenth century (Kantianism, Marxism, and Darwinism) were combined creatively in his thought system. He was crucial in the development of neo-Kantianism and incorporated psycho-physiological research on sensation and perception in order to defend Kant's epistemological idealism. Based on a critique of phrenology and philosophical psychology of his time, Lange developed a program of a psychology without a soul. He suggested that only those phenomena that can be observed and controlled should be studied, that psychology should focus on actions and speech, and that for each psychological event the corresponding physical or physiological processes should be identified. Lange opposed introspection and subjective accounts and promoted experiments and statistics. He also promoted Darwinism for psychology while developing a socialist progressive-democratic reading of Darwin in his social theory. The implications of socialist Darwinism on Lange's conceptualization of race are discussed and his prominence in nineteenth century philosophy and psychology is summarized.

Karl peaked in intensity as a major hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico before making landfall on the mountainous coast of Veracruz, Mexico. Multiple aircraft extensively sampled Karl during the NASA GRIP campaign, including NASA's DC-8 aircraft instrumented with the Advanced Precipitation Radar 2 (APR-2), which is a high-resolution, dual-frequency Doppler radar. Data from APR-2 provide a unique opportunity to characterize the precipitation structure of Karl as it underwent orographic modification. As Karl made landfall on 17 September 2010, the vertical structure of the precipitation echo varied spatially around the Mexican terrain. The precipitation variation was linked to several factors: landfall, orientation of flow relative to the topographic features, and differing characteristics inherent to the eyewall and rainbands. Despite the differences in the reflectivity intensity across the storm, we show that low-level reflectivity enhancement occurred only where upslope flow was favorable. The radar data indicate that the processes initially contributing to the reflectivity enhancement were warm-cloud processes, either through collection of orographically-generated cloud water or shallow convection. But as Karl weakened, the low-level enhancement processes were overshadowed by deep convection that developed along the terrain. Analysis of the radar data is complemented by a series of numerical simulations, which reasonably reproduce the track, intensity and structure of Karl. The simulated thermodynamic and kinematic patterns provide a holistic view of Karl's evolution during landfall. We use terrain modification experiments to examine the sensitivity of the orographic enhancement processes to the three-dimensional terrain and land surface characteristics. Consistent with the radar analysis, warm-cloud enhancement processes are visible in the spatial\n\nThe Potassium-Argon Laser Experiment (KarLE): In Situ Geochronology for Mars and Beyond\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCohen, Barbara A.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe search for life in the solar system depends upon discovering the right moments in planetary evolution: when habitable environments existed, when they declined, and when geologic processes operated to preserve traces of life after death. However, an incomplete knowledge of absolute Martian geochronology limits our ability to understand the timing of Martian evolutionary milestones, major climate changes, and stratigraphic epochs [1, 2]. Absolute dating relates these habitability markers to planetarywide geologic, atmospheric, and climate history places, and ties their occurrence to the history of the solar system, especially the Earth-Moon system and the timescale of evolution of life on Earth. KArLE is being developed to anchor the relative timeline of geological events to an absolute chronology that puts Mars into a wider solar system context. KArLE makes its measurements on rock samples that can be obtained by landers or rovers and inserted into a small, mechanically simple chamber. KArLE interrogates the samples using laser-induced breakdown spectrocopy (LIBS), mass spectrometry, and optical imaging. The KArLE experiment is flexible enough to accommodate any partner providing these instrument components, a creative approach that extends the ability of mission payloads to accomplish an additional highly-desirable science measurement for low cost and risk and minimal extra hardware.\n\nGerman Astronomer Karl Menten Is 2007 Jansky Awardee\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\n2007-06-01\n\nAssociated Universities, Inc., (AUI) and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) have awarded the 2007 Karl G. Jansky Lectureship to Professor Karl M. Menten of the Max-Planck-Institute for Radioastronomy in Bonn, Germany. The Jansky Lectureship is an honor established by the trustees of AUI to recognize outstanding contributions to the advancement of astronomy. Karl M. Menten Professor Karl M. Menten CREDIT: NRAO/AUI Click on image for high-resolution file (433 KB) Professor Menten is an extraordinarily productive scientist whose research has improved our fundamental understanding in a number of areas of astronomy. He has studied the chemistry of molecular clouds from which new stars are formed, the process of star formation in our own Milky Way Galaxy and in the early Universe, and the outer atmospheres of stars nearing the end of their \"normal\" lives. In 1991, Menten used NRAO's 140-foot Telescope at Green Bank, West Virginia, to discover strong radio emission from methanol masers in star-forming regions. These masers amplify, or strengthen, radio emission the same way a laser amplifies visible-light emission. Menten developed the observation of these methanol masers into a powerful tool for studying the formation of stars much more massive than our Sun, because the strong maser emission points astronomers to the stellar birthplaces. In addition, Menten pioneered the use of ultra-high-resolution observations with NRAO's Very Long Baseline Array to observe masers to make precision determinations of the structure, size and dynamics of the Milky Way. Menten received his doctoral degree in 1987 from the University of Bonn, Germany. He then joined the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, working there until 1996, when he became the Director for Millimeter and Submillimeter Astronomy at the Max-Planck-Institute for Radioastronomy. In addition to that position, he also has been a Professor for Experimental Astrophysics at the University of Bonn since\n\nIn Situ Geochronology on the Mars 2020 Rover with KArLE (Potassium-Argon Laser Experiment)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCohen, B. A.; Swindle, T. D.; Roark, S. E.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIf extinct and/or extant life is discovered on Mars, knowledge of the chronology of the biosphere will be of paramount importance. KArLE will provide absolute ages of Mars 2020 rocks, which will allow us to understand them in the context of Mars' geologic history, connect them to other landing sites, and compare Martian epochs of habitability with the Earth's history and evolution of life. KArLE significantly enhances the ability of Mars 2020 to meet its science objectives by performing in situ age dating on key lithologies, enabling targeted searches for ancient biosignatures and increasing the chances of identifying evidence for Martian microbial life. The KArLE investigation makes its measurements on a core sample obtained with the rover drill, inserted into a small, mechanically simple chamber, followed by interrogation by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), mass spectrometry, and optical imaging. The KArLE experiment is flexible enough to accommodate any partner providing these instrument components, a creative approach that extends the ability of the Mars 2020 payload to accomplish an additional highly-desirable science measurement for low cost and risk and minimal extra hardware.\n\nLawsonite Blueschists in Recycled MÃ©lange Involved in K-Rich Orogenic Magmatism\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Y.; Prelevic, D.; Foley, S. F.; Buhre, S.; Galer, S. J. G.\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe origin of K-rich orogenic magmatism in the Alpine-Himalayan belt and its relationship to the large-scale elevations in several massifs of the orogen is controversial, particularly the significance of the widespread presence of a geochemical signal typical for recycled continental crust. Two competing scenarios invoke direct melting of continental crust during deep intercontinental subduction and removal of heavily metasomatised mantle lithosphere by delamination into the convecting mantle. Here we investigate the coupling of high Th/La ratio with crustal isotopic signatures in K-rich orogenic lavas that does not occur in volcanic rocks from other collisional environments to distinguish between these two models. High-pressure experimental results on a phyllite representing upper crustal composition and a detailed mineral and geochemical study of blueschists from TavÅanlÄ± mÃ©lange, Turkey, indicate that this geochemical fingerprint originates by melting of subducted mÃ©lange. Melting of crust at the top of the subducted continental lithosphere cannot produce observed fingerprint, whereas lawsonites, especially those with terrigenous sediment origin from blueschists with high Th/La can. Lawsonites that grow in various components of a subduction mÃ©lange inherit the geochemical characteristics of either oceanic or continental protoliths. It is currently uncertain whether those carrying the high Th/La signature originate by direct melting of continental blocks in the mÃ©lange or by the introduction of supercritical fluids from lawsonite blueschist of continental origin that infiltrate oceanic sediment blocks. Either way, the high Th/La is later released into subsequently formed melts. This confirms the supposition that lawsonite is the main progenitor of the high Th/La and Sm/La ratio. However, lawsonite must break down completely to impart this unique feature to subsequent magmas. The source regions of the potassic volcanic rocks consist of blueschist facies mÃ©langes\n\nDelineating the Profile of Autism Spectrum Disorder Characteristics in Cornelia de Lange and Fragile X Syndromes\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMoss, Joanna; Oliver, Chris; Nelson, Lisa; Richards, Caroline; Hall, Scott\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAn atypical presentation of autism spectrum disorder is noted in Cornelia de Lange and Fragile X syndromes, but there are few detailed empirical descriptions.

She focuses on his early work in Vienna and Munich as well as his tenure at the Psychological Institute in Hamburg, up through the time when he became a named Professor in Psychology at Clark University. Recognized as one of the founders of developmental psychology, Heinz Werner worked in the areas of perceptual development, comparative psychology, and symbol formation. Versatile in rigorous experimental methodologies, and in observational and phenomenological methodologies, Werner's approach to development stood in contrast to other approaches of development, both past and current. For Werner, development was a heuristic, a way of looking at processes in a variety of domains, including ontogeny, phylogeny, microgenesis, biology, developmental psychopathology, neuropsychology, and comparative psychology. Werner viewed development as proceeding from a state of relative globality and lack of differentiation to a state of increasing differentiation, articulation, and hierarchical integration, but he also stressed that individuals can function at different developmental levels under different times and conditions. Werner's holistic, organismic, comparative, and contextual approach to development transcended interdisciplinary boundaries, allowing him to study the interrelatedness between thought, language, feeling, perception, and culture.\n\nThe nature and consequence of Karl Marx's skin disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nShuster, S\n\n2008-01-01\n\nFrom an analysis of the original correspondence, it has been possible to establish that Karl Marx's incapacitating skin disease was hidradenitis suppurativa, not 'boils' as was universally assumed at the time and since; the psychological effect of this illness on the man and his work appears to have been considerable.\n\nHannah Arendt and Karl Jaspers: The Time of Friendship\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nNixon, Jon\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThis paper provides an introduction to the enduring friendship between Hannah Arendt and Karl Jaspers.

Traditionally, geochronology has only been accomplishable on samples from dedicated sample return missions or meteorites. The capability for in situ geochronology is highly desired, because it will allow one-way planetary missions to perform dating of large numbers of samples. The success of an in situ geochronology package will not only yield data on absolute ages, but can also complement sample return missions by identifying the most interesting rocks to cache and/or return to Earth. In situ dating instruments have been proposed, but none have yet reached TRL 6 because the required high-resolution isotopic measurements are very challenging. Our team is now addressing this challenge by developing the Potassium (K) - Argon Laser Experiment (KArLE) under the NASA Planetary Instrument Definition and Development Program (PIDDP), building on previous work to develop a K-Ar in situ instrument [1]. KArLE uses a combination of several flight-proven components that enable accurate K-Ar isochron dating of planetary rocks.
