        "text": "Papers, 1957-1968\n\n3 l.f.\n\nThe descriptive inventory of the Papers of Harold Lough in the University of Idaho Library was prepared by Judith Nielsen, June 1979.\n\nPRINCIPLES OF ORGANIZATION\n\nThe papers in the Harold Lough collection are contained in three boxes. The correspondence is arranged alphabetically, the original letter and copy of the reply being stapled together in many cases. Budgets and reports of committee meetings are arranged in chronological order.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH\n\nHarold Laugh was born in Nebraska and spent his early years on a farm. He married Helen Low of Milwaukee, Wisconsin whom he met in Denver where she was teaching school. They had one daughter.\n\nHe came to the Pacific Northwest in 1939 as a representative of the Cleveland Tractor firm. He spent two years in Lewiston before moving to Moscow, Idaho in 1944. In Moscow he was co-owner of the State Tractor and Supply Company.\n\nBefore seeking election to the Idaho Senate he was a member of the Moscow City Council. He represented Latah County in the Senate from 1957 to 1968. He did not seek re-election in 1968. His main interest in the Senate was the financing of education. The committees on which he served were Finance, Gubernatorial Appointments, and Legislative Administration and Elections.\n\nSCOPE AND CONTENT\n\nThe papers of Harold Lough consist of correspondence, legislative committee reports and state budgets for the twelve years he was the state senator from Latah County. The letters are mainly from constituents expressing their opinions on matters before the legislature. There are many letters from Senator Frank Church, which discuss federal legislation which is of interest to Idaho; there is also a letter from Senator Len Jordan concerning the Wild Rivers Bill.\n\nState budgets and records of the budget committee form another portion of this collection. A third section consists of material relating to the legislature -- journals, copies of bills, lists of all bills introduced and their disposition. This is perhaps the most useful series to the student of Idaho legislative history. There are also minutes of several committees on which Lough served.\n\nThe contents of each section is outlined in full in the following Description of Series\n\nSeries Description\n\nI. Correspondence File Box 1\n\nII. Published Material File Box 1\n\nIII. The Legislature File Box 2\n\nIV. The Budget File Box 3\n\nV. Miscellaneous File Box 3\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SERIES.\n\nI. Correspondence\n\nThe first series in the Harold Lough papers consists of Lough's correspondence, both incoming and outgoing, while he was serving as State Senator from District 5 (Latah County) from 1957 to 1968. Many of these letters are from constituents and express their views on matters before the legislature; Lough's replies are often attached to the original letter. There are also some letters from Idaho's Senators in Washington, D.C. requesting information on local opinion in regard to bills in the U.S. Congress; an example of this is a letter from Senator Jordan concerning the Wild Rivers Bill. There are also letters from U.S. Congressmen concerning the status of Federal projects in Idaho, such as the new post office-federal building in Moscow.\n\nAn Alphabetical List of Correspondents\n\nAdams, Donald E.
