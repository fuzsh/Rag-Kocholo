        "text": "My thanks and appreciation! Tony D. thank you so much for referring Skyway Brokerage as a reliable company to handle some freight. I appreciate the information and advice you have shared with me, without actually knowing me personally. When I first got on LinkedIn I was terrified to post anything that seemed against the \"rules\", or that didn't have some sort of insightful message embedded into it. So basically I spammed my first two hundred connections with a sales message that almost worked one time. üòÖ However, once I stumbled across the HMB podcast that is when I started to break out of my shell. I began to engage, and took notes on the topics that were discussed. I looked forward every week to watching Tony, TJ, and Jeff throw one back while talking some \"ship.\" Mostly because of their no excuse, no BS attitudes that you fellas possess. That podcast helped me eliminate laziness from my daily routine, and strive for quality over quantity. You're just my kind of people! ü§ò I'm not a freight broker! That would insinuate that the primary focus is to be the intermediary between two companies. I'm part of a team that works together closely to ensure we exceed expectations within all of our partnerships. Efficiency is at it highest when we ALL work together! That goes for the industry as a whole, regardless of what company you work for. Quit pointing fingers, and start being better! Not all brokers/brokerages are bad. There are actually a lot of benefits your freight agent can provide you with. Flexibility, efficiency, and the ability to handle last minute changes are just a few examples. An honest freight broker can definitely save you time and money. Usually! üòâ IMO, having a service provider like MDS TRUCKING V INC, and Skyway Brokerage adds a lot more tools to your reservoir. One of the biggest advantages is working with ONE specific company for the entire logistical process. Just like a broker offers themselves as a single point of contact, but on a much larger scale. If our asset division can't handle the request, I'm certain our brokerage can, and will. No one company can do it all, but having the right partners in your network is critical in order to succeed. Overall we are a great company. MDS has been around for 18 years with it's original MC#. I think that says a lot! Skyway can do it all! Having access to both significantly improves customer service, and reliability. Reputation is important in the freight world. My mission is to continue help build ours as I proceed to learn and grow. Have a freight day!\n\nWe had a customer who called yesterday afternoon panicking and requesting to urgently pick up some LFD containers that another trucker had given back to them last minute. I said, you gave it to VPV, you know it‚Äôs going to get handled. All containers were pulled and delivered first thing this morning! I understand that booking the cheaper rates may be what seems like the right financial decision, but in this case, that ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù rate could have ended in alot of demurrage and delayed deliveries. At VPV, we don‚Äôt sell our services as ‚Äúcheap‚Äù because we don‚Äôt believe in ‚Äúcheap‚Äù service. We believe in over exceeding expectations and delivering above average service. You can confidently send us your container orders keeping in mind that we will pick them up before LFD, deliver as expected, and return within free time. No worries, no headaches, leave it up to VPV Transport to handle your containers! You get what you pay for!"
