        "text": "About ASIANetwork Exchange\n\nThe ASIANetwork Exchange is the journal of ASIANetwork, a consortium of around 160 North American colleges, that strives to strengthen the role of Asian Studies within the framework of liberal arts education. Originally a newsletter, then a journal, in Fall 2011 the Exchange became a peer-reviewed publication, catering primarily to faculty appointed in liberal arts institutions with programs in Asian Studies. The ASIANetwork Exchange seeks to publish current research, as well as high-quality pedagogical essays written by specialists and non-specialists alike. The journal's editors are particularly interested in publishing articles, book and media reviews that address the needs of the undergraduate classroom."
