WORDS WON'T WIN- ACTION WILL In the September issue we began our report on a powerful new drive to disarm American civilians including all state and local police. We have had so many requests for the September issue that we are unable to fill more than a small percent of them. Unfortunately, the soot of new plates makes it impossible for us to reprint the September issue at this time. Therefore, we are beginning this issue with a summary of the material covered so far and a general outline of this program including its objectives and the means by which those behind it expect to accomplish their objectives. This present plan to disarm American civilians is considerably dif- ferent from the usual type of \"do good\" anti-gun legislation that is continu- ously being proposed by people who think crime can be eliminated by eliminating the private ownership of firearms. This old theory has of course long since been disproven. A criminal is not going to be restrained by a law which sup- posedly prohibits him from owning a gun. The law abiding citizen will normally be restrained from owning a gun if it is against the law. Thus, laws which make it illegal to own firearms do nothing except to leave the average citizen disarmed and at the mercy of any common criminal. If the criminal cannot buy a gun he can always steal one. If he does not have a gun he can use a knife or a club to threaten his victim or commit his criminal assault. The disarmament plan which we described in our September issue has been developing for several years among a number of ultra-liberal professors at the University of Michigan. Notable among them are Kenneth E. Boulding (a foreigner who came to our shores to tell us Americans how we can best \"protect\" our national and individual freedom). He is a member of the National Advisory Council of the left-wing Student Peace Union. He is co-author of \"The US and Revolution\". The sale of his books is actively promoted by Fellowship Publications and the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions. Another sparkplug among the University of Michigan faculty for this plan is Professor Anatole Rapoport who was born in Russia and who now presumes to advise us Americans as to how we can (through disarmament) turn a deadly struggle for survival into a polite \"debate\" with the Soviet Union. In 1959 a \"Center of Research on Conflict Resolution\" was set up at the University of Michigan using personnel whose salaries are paid in part with your tax money. A \"Journal of Conflict Resolution\", published and paid for in part by your tax money, has for the past six years spewed forth a steady stream of \"peace at any price\" propaganda. Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300540023-8 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300540023-8 More recently, the University of Michigan, assisted in the formation of an \"Institute of Arms Control and Peace Research\", which has begun publishing the Journal of Arms Control. on December 17th, 1962 this disarmament plan suddenly jumped from the category of a harmless pipe dream into full grown and extremely dangerous threat. On that date began a four day \"International Arms Control Symposium\" held at Ann Arbor, Michigan and attended by nearly 400 influential representa- tives from government, industry, organized labor, various scientific societies, churches, public relations groups and educational institutions. These included executive's from such well known industrial corpora- tions as Chrysler, Raytheon, North American Aviation, Douglas Aircraft, Lock- heed, General Electric, Chance-Vought etc. Among; those attending were several representatives of the U. S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, officials from the Department of Defense, a few of our more \"liberal\" Senators and Congressmen, religious leaders of several denominations, professors from over a dozen universities and members of numerous left-wing \"peace\" groups and communist front organizations. This disarmament symposium was sponsored jointly by the University of Michigan and the Bendix Corporation (which holds a fat \"research\" contract with the U. S. Disarmament Agency). The tone of the meeting was set by the first three speakers: Victor KarFov (First: Secretary of the Soviet Embassy), Robert Matteson (U. S. Arms Control and iisarmament Agency), and Walter Reuther (President, UAW). During this symposium a member of the Minutemen attended all of their meetings, took notes on all the lectures, obtained copies of all their printed material and most important of all a complete list of every person that attend- ed this affair. The details of this plan are so shocking and so fantastic that we waited for nearly nine months before publishing this report so that we could prove and document every item. The average American would find it difficult to understand why some of the biggest and most reputable companies in the United States would send representatives to such a meeting. Why would such companies who have become big and wealthy under the American system of free enterprise support a group of people who would gladly leave our nation disarmed and totally defenseless before the threat of world communism. A possible answer lies in the fact that many of the high executives of these companies are members of the Council of Foreign Relations--the so-called \"secret: government\" of the United States. Of the ninety-two people who spoke during this four day conference nearly all fit into one of the following categories: 3. Persons who have made it a habit to support or be affiliated with various ultra-liberal peace and disarmament groups. In our September issue we documented the communist backgrounds and affiliations of many of these speakers. A fifth category of speakers includes persons who work for ei4her universities or companies holding research contracts or obtaining other funds from the U. S. Arms Control and Disarmament: Agency. Typical of this category is Klauss Knorr of the Center of Interna- tional Studies, Princeton University, who spoke on \"Contributions of the U. S. Industry to Arms Control Research\". Klauss E. Knorr was born in Germany. After coming to the United States in 1937 he was immediately accepted into important government posi- 2 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R00030054UU '- Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300540023-8 tions, especially those effecting public pinion on both foreign and domestic policies. He has also served as associate director at the School for Inter- national Studies; as a consultant for the Rand Corporation, for the Paley Commission, for the National War College, for the Mutual Security Administra- tion, for the European Economic Commission, for the United Nations, etc., etc. Quite a record for a man who was not even a naturalized citizen of this coun- try until 1940. As a result of this symposium these organizations now have at their disposal $4,000,000.00 with the promise of more to come. According to the discussions, formal and informal, that were held at this symposium much of this money will be used: A. To \"encourage\" both state and national senators and representa- tives to introduce and vote for laws that will gradually restrict private ownership of firearms leading to the ultimate confiscation of all private arms. B. For the writing and \"planting\" of articles in leading magazines that play up the dangers of crime and accidents where firearms are involved. C. For programs to educate the members of the press and other news media regarding these dangers so that they will be encouraged to emphasize the violent aspects of any crime where a firearm is involved and give page one coverage to such things as hunting accidents. With the public properly brainwashed and sufficient anti-gun legis- lation passed at the national level these people are aiming at a target date of January 1, 1966 to begin the actual confiscation of civilian arms. A subject of considerable unofficial debate was whether or not it would be desirable to first have a period of amnesty in which people could turn their guns in voluntarily and be paid a fair market price for them. Some of those present argued that such a move would merely give people an oppor- tunity to hide their guns away. Others argued that it would not be possible to keep confiscation plans entirely secret and they thought most people would turn in their guns voluntarily when they could receive payment for them rather than chance having them confiscated later on without payment. All of this was discussed in terms of the State Department plan for \"Total Disarmament in a Peaceful world\". Although not listed as a speaker, an active participant in these \"informal discussions\" was Robert 0. Blood, Jr., 2005 Penncraft & Court, Ann Arbor, Michigan (Sociology Department, U. of Mich.). Blood was one of the signers of an open letter to President Truman published in the communist \"porker\" Aug. 13, 1950 under the letter-head of the identified communist front \"American Committee for the Protection of the Foreign Born\". He has been affiliated with the \"Committee for Free Political Advocary\", the National Council of Sciences and Professions and other communist controlled organiza- tions. Most of our own members are well acquainted with the moves that have been made to disarm our nation and turn our weapons over to a United Nations police force. S!.nce many of the people who will be reading this particular issue of \"On Target\" may be gun dealers and other persona who have not pre- viously taken an interest in this matter, we will review these other facts. briefly. In 1961 the United States Congress passed, and the Senate approved, Public Law 87-297. This law was signed into final effect by President Kennedy in November of that year. Under this law the United States disarmament agency was brought into existence and the appointed personnel of this agency, were given full power to transfer or eliminate all or any part of the weapons and/ or personnel of our Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. The general plan under which this is to be accomplished was spelled out in publication 7277 of the United States State Department, available for 151; per copy from the Superintendant of Documents, U. S. Government Printing Office. Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300540023-8 Approved For Release 2004/10/13 : CIA-RDP88-01315R000300540023-8 Most Americans still do not realize that in 1946 our Senate ratified the United Nations Charter as a Treaty Obligation. Since that time the Supreme Court has held that treaty law supersedes the United States Constitu- tion. Thus, the United States Constitution is no longer the supreme law of this land. In the final analysis we are now governed by the United Nations Charter which was written by two communist spies with many parts copied direct- ly from the so-called constitution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Most Americans do not realize that a number of United States Army Troops were turned over to the United Nations command to make practice seizures of a number of American cities as far back as 1952. These and many other facts concerning the communist subversion and control of our own government have been carefully hidden from the American people. When these facts are known, however, the possibility of our personal firearms being confiscated by the end of 1965 seems less fantastic. The actual procedure discussed at this symposium for confiscation of these arms called for the United States to be divided up into areas of approximately five states each. Beginning with the northwestern part of the United States each of these areas is to be sealed off with troops and systematically searched until all possible arms (supposedly) are found and confiscated. Then another five state area would be dealt with in the same manner until the entire country had been covered. Maybe they will achieve their objective and maybe not. One thing is certain--with four million dollars you can print a lot of propaganda and buy the votes of a good many Congressmen. In our October issue we listed by name and address 157 of the peo- ple that attended this symposium. Other individuals are listed below without comment. In our December issue we will return to document the left-wing affiliations of many of these individuals. Theodore F. Lentz 5937 Enright Avenue St. Louis 12, Missouri B. P.
