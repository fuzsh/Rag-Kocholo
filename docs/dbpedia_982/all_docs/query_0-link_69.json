        "text": "Stuart T. Loughridge was born in 1978. His father, Leon Loughridge, was a painter and printmaker and Stuart’s oldest memories are looking over his father's shoulder as he painted. In high school his art teachers continued to keep him focused on his art work and later encouraged him to pursue training at the Atelier. He attended the Atelier from 1999 – 2002 and he also studied at the St. Paul Art Academy from 2015 – 2019.\n\nStuart is currently based in St. Paul. As a studio painter he works with oil paint and watercolors, primarily painting landscapes. In addition, he is a devoted printmaker and is well known for his etchings."
