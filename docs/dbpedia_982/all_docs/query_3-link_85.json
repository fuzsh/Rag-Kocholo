        "text": "There are few castles in Ireland as unique as the mighty McDermott’s Castle.\n\nAs you can see from the photo above, it’s quite literally plonked on a little green island smack bang in the middle of a lake.\n\nAlthough McDermott’s Castle gets far less attention than the likes of the most haunted castle in Ireland and Blarney Castle, it’s still well worth a visit.\n\nIn the guide below, you’ll find out everything that you need to know about this incredible fairytale-like castle.\n\nWelcome to McDermott’s Castle\n\nYou’ll find McDermott’s Castle in County Roscommon on Lough Key, 3km northeast of the town of Boyle.\n\nStretching around 10km across and forming a rough circular shape, Lough Key contains over 30 islands scattered throughout its chilly waters.\n\nOne of these islands is aptly named ‘Castle Island’ and it’s here that you’ll find the ruins of McDermott’s Castle.\n\nA tale of tragedy\n\nLocal legend tells the story of a girl called Una, the daughter of the McDermott chief, who fell in love with a boy from a lower class.\n\nUna’s father refused to let her leave the island, in the hopes that this would deter the budding relationship.\n\nUnbeknownst to her father, Una’s boyfriend began swimming across Lough Key to reach the castle. It was during one of these crossings that tragedy struck, and the boy drowned.\n\nIt’s said that Una died from grief and that both she and her partner have remained buried beneath two intertwined trees on the island ever since.\n\nGetting to McDermott’s Castle\n\nIf you fancy seeing more of Castle Island and McDermott’s Castle, there are several tour providers that offer trips to and around the island.\n\nIf you’re visiting the area, make sure to spend some time in Lough Key Forest Park. It’s home to around 800 hectares of gorgeous, picturesque wood and parkland with a lake and several wooded islands.\n\nFor those exploring the park, take some time to ;\n\nCheck out the observation tower\n\nHave a gander at the wishing chair\n\nStroll through the underground tunnels.\n\nRamble along the Trinity Bridge\n\nHave a snoop around the Bog Garden\n\nSoak up some of the history of the area in the visitor centre and soak up some of the areas rich history"
