At the moment TheyWorkForYou, which is used by millions of people each year, is run with less than the equivalent of one full-time person.\n\nIf we had a bit more money, we could achieve a lot more.\n\nWe want MPs to meet the standards and expectations of the people who elected them - you!\n\nIf you share that goal please donate today to enable greater transparency and accountability of the next government.\n\nLearn more about our current work, and our new project WhoFundsThem - looking into MPs’ and APPGs’ financial interests.\n\nLearn more about how we'll use your donation and other ways to help.\n\nNote for journalists and researchers: The data on this page may be used freely, on condition that TheyWorkForYou.com is cited as the source.\n\nThis data was produced by TheyWorkForYou from a variety of sources.\n\nFor an explanation of the vote descriptions please see our page about voting information on TheyWorkForYou."
