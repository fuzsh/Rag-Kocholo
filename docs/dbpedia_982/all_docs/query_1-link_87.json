There he obtained Foreign Going Certificates before joining the Steam Packet in 1932 as a seaman during the depression years. He was promoted to 2nd Mate on the Rushen Castle in 1934 and was promoted to Chief Officer in 1947. From 1960 until 1972 he was a Master. In 1939 he was 2nd Mate on the Manxman (1), serving at Dunkirk and other areas of evacuation. After the loss of so many ships in 1940 he was seconded from the Steam Packet along with almost all the 2nd Mates for the duration of the war and saw active service in the Far East theatre of war. He rejoined the fleet in 1946 as 2nd Mate of the Ben-my-Chree (4). He retired in January 1972 and remained a regular member of the Mariners' Choir. He died in 1995 aged 88.\n\nDetails obtained from 'Steam Packet 175: the official anniversary book of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company', 2005 (B160/75; M 26396).\n\nLanguage: English\n\nExtent: 1 folder\n\nItem name: certificates, service record, references, discharge sheets, correspondence, memoirs, unused postcards of vessels\n\nCollection: Manuscript Archive\n\nLevel: FONDS\n\nID number: MS 11514\n\nRecord class: Private"
