        "text": "Tom started in the construction industry in 1995 as a Carpenter Apprentice, working his way through the field and learning each detail that goes into a building. Now, as the Senior Superintendent at Vertix Builders, Tom not only efficiently manages projects but helps train our less experienced carpenters and assistants. Tom’s construction background includes successfully completed projects in healthcare, education, mission critical, and multi-family facilities. He thrives on utilizing the knowledge of his trade partners and collaborating to create the best possible solution. In Tom’s own words: “I love working with people and a team environment. Also, it’s great to drive by a project and say ‘We did that.’”"
