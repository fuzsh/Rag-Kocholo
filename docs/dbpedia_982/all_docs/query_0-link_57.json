        "text": "Our laboratory studies the interactions between lipoprotein metabolism and blood clot lysis. Fibrinolysis, the primary mechanism that dissolves a blood clot, is initiated by a serine protease tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). Our previous study discussed a novel source and regulation of endogenous basal plasma tPA derived from hepatocytes, which is important for fibrinolysis when a vessel injury occurs (Blood, 2019). The tPA activity is inhibited primarily by the serpin plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). A balance between tPA and PAI-1 in plasma is essential for preventing excessive clotting. Our study revealed the mechanism of how hepatocytes sense metabolic stresses and imbalance the production of tPA and PAI-1, influencing the degree of impaired fibrinolysis in obesity (JCI, 2020).\n\nA new study from our lab, discovered a direct interaction between tPA and apoB, the scaffold protein of LDL and VLDL particles, reducing VLDL production from hepatocytes and lowering atherogenic apoB-lipoprotein cholesterol in circulation (Science, 2023). The goal of our laboratory is to understand the role of hepatocyte-derived tPA and basal fibrinolysis in hemostasis, and to develop diagnostic/ preventive/ therapeutic strategies that can be used to combat atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and bleeding disorders. Specific areas of research interests include: 1) a new link between reduced fibrinolysis and dyslipidemia in atherothrombosis, 2) fibrinolysis and lipoproteins in hemophilia, 3) the role of lipoprotein in platelet biology, 4) the role of hepatocyte tPA and liver injuries, and 5) a timely study of dyslipidemia and thrombosis in COVID-19."
