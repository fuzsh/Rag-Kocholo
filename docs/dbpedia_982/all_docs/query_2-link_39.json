        "text": "When the opportunity came to be the editor-in-chief of his high school newspaper, Tom Lough jumped at the chance. He studied the journalism process and trained his reporting staff in the “inverted pyramid” method of reporting. Later, he founded Logo Exchange (LX), a publication for teachers using the Logo computer language in their classrooms. Starting as a monthly newsletter, LX grew into a peer reviewed journal published at the University of Oregon by the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE). All LX issues have been archived and are available to the public at: https://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/resources/nlx/index.html At present, he is focusing on screenwriting and music composition. He was awarded a fellowship from the Writers Guild Foundation to develop a screenplay for a feature film, inspired by the true story of a teenage rider in 1912 London who aspires for Olympic glory but is denied because of her gender. He also composed a hymn for Veterans Day use that can be found at : www.everfaithfultothecall.com He is actively scouting for indications of how writing may evolve in the near future, and believes that AI will be a major player. This has provided the motivation for the development of his books. He operates TL Publishing from Round Rock, Texas. He is a 1964 graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point and a member of the 1968 United States Olympic Team in the sport of modern pentathlon.\n\nRead full bio"
