        "text": "LOUGH DERG a\n\nNation 1842-1897, Saturday, August 30, 1879; Page: 3\n\nThe Archbishop of Toronto on the Lough Derg Pilgrimage.\n\nWe have great pleasure in laying before our readers the second letter from his Grace the Archbishop of Toronto on the Pilgrimage to Lough Derg:— Lough Derg, August 14, 1879.\n\nVery Rev. and Dear Sir—In my last I promised to continue to speak of the religious exercises performed on making the stations on this holy island.\n\nFirst there is a visit to the Blessed Sacrament; then a Pater, Ave, and Creed outside at the Cross of St. Patrick, then the pilgrim proceeds around St. Patrick’s Church, and a rougher path could not be conceived. It lies around the edge of the lake. He then goes to the Cross of St. Bridgid, where on his knees he recites three Paters, three Aves, and a Creed; then standing with outstretched arms he renounces thrice the devil, the world, and the flesh. The next in order is to go the rough road round St. Patrick’s Church seven times, repeating each time one Our Father, ten Hail Marys, and the Creed. The pilgrim has now walked a hard half mile, meditating upon the more painful journey of Christ up the Hill of Calvary. He next proceeds to the St. Brigid’s Station, with its crucifix in the centre, and recites three Our Fathers, three Aves, and one Creed, whilst going round the station on the outside. Arriving at the entrance he kneels down and repeats on his knees the same prayers again. He stands up, and then walks round the cross, reciting again the three Our Fathers, three Hail Marys, and the Creed. The three inside circles being completed, he kneels again opposite the cross, and recites the same prayers. The same number of prayers are recited at the six other stations; then the pilgrim proceeds to the lake, near where St. Patrick kneeled on a rock in the water praying that the faith of the Irish should never fail. The pilgrims are not now permitted to follow his example in this; but at the water’s edge they recite five Our Fathers and five Hail Marys, standing, and the same number of prayers on their knees. They then return to St. Patrick’s Cross, whence they had commenced, and recite one Pater, one Ave, and a Creed, and finish all by reciting five decades of the Rosary. I noticed the pilgrims going to the lake, after each station, and bathing their feet, hot enough, I presume, after an hour and a quarter’s walk on the rough and rocky paths of the stations. I noticed some of the rocks around the stations, upon which all had to step, black and oily from the sweat of the feet of innumerable pilgrims. Those exercises of the stations reminded me of the Armenian clergy whilst reciting Vespers in the great monastery situated in the Bay of Venice, so that these circuits round the stations seem to be of eastern antiquity. St John Climacus in his book “Ladder of Perfection” describes the penances done in what was called ” the prison” of a certain monastery as most severe, but I think not much more so than those performed on the Island of Lough Derg. The penitential exercises of the station which we have described are repeated three times a day, morning, noon, and evening. The pilgrims, besides, assist at several Masses each day, with an exhortation; then, at twelve o’clock, all make a visit to the Blessed Sacrament. The priest recites the prayers, and usually gives a short instruction. At six o’clock they assemble again in St. Patrick’s Church, when the evening sermon is preached, followed by the Benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament. The pilgrims spend the whole night in what is termed the ” prison,” St. Patrick’s Church being used for the purpose. They spend their time in making the Stations of the Cross, singing hymns, reciting the Rosary and other prayers, and spend much besides in meditating on the malice of sin, the hatred which God bears it, and its punishments. When morning has fairly dawned they leave the prison, wash their feet and head in the lake, and are permitted to taste a little of the water in the hollow of their hands. They require this little refreshment, as the heat of the prison and the watching all night and reciting so many prayers is most fatiguing. But the pilgrims come to the island to commute, through the mercy of God and the indulgences of the Church, the pains of purgatory for this temporal suffering. Formerly during the night an exhortation was given on the great truths of eternity. Pilgrims used to be so often and much excited to contrition for their sins that their sobs and cries, which were contagious, distressed too much the whole island, and on that account the exportation was discontinued. The priests on the island hear confessions the whole day and far into the night. The Bishop of Clogher, during the annual retreat, appoints a certain number of his priests to attend as confessors during the station. One of them he appoints as prior, who is his representative on the island. His lordship often attends himself, and works like any of his priests. After the community Mass each morning one of the priests is commissioned to bless beads, crosses, and medals, to invest in all the scapulars approved of by the Holy see, and to impart all the indulgences attached. All these religious objects can be procured very cheaply on the island. The ordinary prayers recited during the stations are more numerous than at any other pilgrimage I ever heard of. I counted them, and I believe I am accurate when I say that 321 Our Fathers, 615 Hail Marys, and 93 Creeds are recited each day. The Irish were always noted for their great spirit of prayer and mortification, and when we consider that all these stations are performed each day before the pilgrim takes a morsel of food or drink, we may form some idea of the penances done and the fervour requisite on the island. Pilgrims have assured me that they felt very little inconvenience from the fast or any of the other penances. The old adage came to my mind that” Love lightens labour” and what was said of St. Laurence, that the fire within was stronger than the fire without. There are a few cabins on the island for the accommodation of pilgrims, but these are inadequate in every sense.\n\nMany never enter them, but when they are overpowered they snatch a little sleep wherever they can—often on the rocks and grassy mounds of the island, which after all contains only about an acre. They say that they never get cold or receive any injury from the wet or exposure of the place. A large and commodious lodging-house is about to be erected, which, indeed, is badly needed. Many come delicate enough to this retreat, I am told, and return home healthy and rejoicing, and always resolve to come back again. I found a great number who had performed this pilgrimage seven and eight times. Some said that they came regularly for many years past. There were five from America making the station with us, and we are told that some Americans come in almost every boat. We thank God that there is one place on earth where the primitive spirit of penance remains, and the one idea of following Christ along the thorny path which leads to heaven dominates. The fervent countenances of the pilgrims, their ages and conditions of life, and the alacrity with which they performed the painful duties of the station raised me up, and made me despise my own pusillanimity, and encouraged me to perform my station. I could not do more than go round the station once each day. It occupied me one hour and a half, though the young and nimble can perform them in one hour and a quarter. The bishop commuted the other two stations to preaching and hearing confessions, which I did willingly. Some prolonged their stations for six, and even for nine days, fasting all the time. I know from experience that life on the island is exceptional. One does not feel as usual; he forgets the world and its cares, and fears nothing. One gentleman told me that if he got his foot wet, and did not change his stockings very soon, he got a sore throat; but seeing the others bare-footed, he took off his shoes, and performed the penances of the whole day, without the slightest inconvenience. I think that all this, if not miraculous, is at least an especial dispensation of Providence, to preserve in some degree the primitive spirit of Irish faith and Irish mortification. The water of the lake is also exceptional, if not indeed miraculous. It is largely impregnated with iron from many springs that enter it, and tastes very agreeably when boiled and taken hot. Other water would excite nausea in this condition. The people have great faith in the ” wine,” as they call it, of the lake. They attribute to its use their strength to go through the stations. St. Patrick knelt in it, for hours together, and there prayed so much for the faith of Ireland that they believe it possesses a virtue capable of working wonders, I would advise dyspeptic people to come here and live on the oaten bread, drink plenty of the water of the lake, and perform at least some of the religious exercises, and if they are not vastly improved in three days they can leave, and blame me. Persons can gain the indulgences granted by Popes to this sanctuary as at other famous pilgrimages, by confession, communion, and the usual prayers, but of course they cannot expect to gain all the graces attached to the penitential exercises without performing them in full. I found very illustrious names on the registry book of pilgrims kept here.\n\nMany distinguished prelates of the Irish Church have visited this island in latter times, from the Primate of Ireland, who made his annual pilgrimage here for many years, down to the lowest order of the hierarchy. During the present year’s station it was visited by the Archbishop of Cashel, the Bishops of Elphin and Achonry, and several worthy members of the secular and regular clergy, who all proclaimed themselves deeply moved and edified by the scenes of the place. It contributes greatly to the fervour of the pilgrims to feel that they are walking on paths moistened by the sweat and tears of thousands of saints and millions of penitents from the time of St. Patrick. Father O’Connor has render great service to faith and fatherland by his charming book on Lough Derg and its pilgrimages. It is published by Dollard, of Dublin, and can be obtained from any bookseller. I am bringing, as an offering to our Holy Father, four souvenirs of Lough Derg—1st, the book of Father O’Connor; 2nd, a shamrock to be planted in the Vatican gardens; 3rd, a piece of oaten bread ; and 4th, a little of the lake water, to show his Holiness the food used by the pilgrims whilst performing their stations, and that only once a day, in the evening, like the Fathers of the Desert. Our departure, on the fourth day, was one which spoke deeply to our hearts. Many of the pilgrims had fully dressed themselves even to their shoes; this was the sign that they had finished their holy work on the island. All appeared in good health, but bore on their countenances the expression of great interior devotion. There was quite a rush to get on our boat, but the singers by a special arrangement were first let in. The boat was weighted to the water’s edge. The Bishop of Clogher, from the boat’s deck, pronounced his solemn benediction on those remaining behind; then we followed. The people kneeling on the shore, with uplifted hands and tears of devotion, received our parting blessings. When the boat moved off from the shore, Father O’Connor intoned the pilgrim’s farewell hymn, which the choir took up with great fervour. Then his lordship, Dr. Donnelly, commenced the “Magnificat,” which was sung in two choirs, the splashing oars appearing to keep time with the music, I had some blessed medals, which I distributed to my fellow-passengers as souvenirs, of the pilgrimage, standing the while with my back to the old boathouse, to prevent being surrounded and carried off my feet. I succeeded in giving to all with some inconvenience, but at the time with great pleasure. Oh ! what simplicity, fervour, and reverence for the clergy. Thank God our good people don’t leave this behind when they come to America.\n\nI must not forget to say that I prayed most fervently at the holy shrine, and offered up the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass for the people of the diocese of Toronto, and especially for those who are my co-labourers in the salvation of souls. The same I shall do in every other holy place.—Yours in Christ, John Joseph Lynch, Archbishop of Toronto.\n\nVery Rev. P. F.

By the decision of Judge Cooke, Station Island, in Lough Derg, remains the property of the Catholic Church, and no one but the Bishop of Clogher and the Prior nominated by him has any power of control over it. For Sir John Leslie, who sought to establish a right of ownership over the island, it was pleaded by his counsel at Donegal Quarter Sessions last week that he would not interfere with the pilgrimages in any way—” they would be absolutely safe ” and ” they would not suffer the slightest injury,” he said. The the present Sir John Leslie could not control his successors, and there is no guarantee that, if he kept his undertaking, some person after him would respect it. The title of the Church to the islands of the pilgrimage is the oldest and most firmly established in the country, and the pilgrims are entitled to continue their devotions without disturbance, or the possibility of disturbance, at the whim of any descendant of the Leslie family or any other. Sir John Leslie failed to produce any document or any evidence of his or his predecessors’ rights over the islands of Lough Derg. There are six tenants who keep lodging houses on the island, all of whom pay a nominal rent to the Prior. In only one case, and only for a limited time, had any tenant paid rent to the present Sir John or his predecessor, nor was any evidence given of right or authority to claim rent. Thirty years ago the Sir John Leslie of that day took proceedings to assert his ownership of the island, but he abandoned the proceedings, and an agreement was come to from which, in the words of Judge Cooke, “it was perfectly manifest that the question of the ownership of the soil of the island was intended to be excluded from the decision in that action” and that “the late Sir John Leslie, then armed and fortified with all the panoply of counsel, refused to proceed to assert his title ”\n\nWhat happened since is singular, indeed. ” It is a most remarkable thing, said the Judge, ” that the only agreement that can be produced by Sir John Leslie in this case in regard to the letting of the lodging-houses in dispute is of a letting made in 1881, subsequent to the action, to a man named Thomas Muldoon, at £1 a year. He took it that that formal document was made for the purpose of showing at a future time, such as the present, that there was such a letting at a definite rent to Muldoon ” None of the Priors had any knowledge of this payment to Leslie, the first they heard of it being at the opening of the present case The Judge had no difficulty in disregarding this bogus tenancy. He went back to the undoubted title of the Catholic Church to these islands before the Church lands of Termon Magrath, surrounding the lake, were confiscated in 1680, but the Catholic priests and people found sanctuary on the island, and the pilgrimage, dating from the fifth or sixth century, was continued, with two brief intervals in 1632 and 1704, when religious persecution sought to stifle the pious observance and, as the distinguished antiquarian, Mr John Cooke, M A., of Trinity College, observes, ” failed in its object.” The latter attempt, the Act passed in the reign of Queen Anne, admits the power of the Pilgrimage of Lough Derg in its preamble. The words of the Act are” Whereas the superstitions of Popery are greatly increased and upheld by the pretended sanctity of places, especially of a place called St. Patrick’s Purgatory in Co Donegal, to which pilgrimages are made by vast numbers of certain persons, by which not only the peace of the public is greatly disturbed but the safety of the Government is also hazarded”\n\nThis great pilgrimage, which has survived probably from the days of St Patrick to our own, without being interrupted for a single year, lasts from the 1st June to the Feast of the Assumption on the 15th August each year. There is a strong tradition from the earliest days in the north-west of lreland that St Patrick spent on one of the islands of Lough Deig one of his periods of solitary prayer and that he had here the Vision of Purgatory, which has given its name to the pilgrimage Saint Dabheog, his disciple, who accompanied him in his Irish mission, erected the first ecclesiastical foundations on the islands of the lough.

ENNISKILLEN, Monday. OVER 500 barefooted pilgrims were performing the exercises of the retreat in a drenching downpour when Most Rev. Dr. Pisani, Titular Archbishop of Constantia, visited Lough Derg yesterday, accompanied by Most Rev. Dr. McKenna, Bishop of Clogher, and Rev. Fr. Hannon, S.J., Dublin. Archbishop Pisani represented the Pope at the Emancipation celebrations in Dublin in 1929, and attended the Eucharistic Congress. He was received by the Prior of Lough Derg, Rev. Monsignor Keown, P.P., V.G.; Rev. T. J. Meegan, C.C., and Rev. Fr. McKenna. The Archbishop visited the churches, the hospices, and other buildings on the island. As he passed along the Archbishop was surrounded by groups of pilgrims, who knelt down to kiss his ring and receive his blessing. The pilgrims were from Westland Row Parish, Dublin. Archbishop Pisani stated that he had beheld many scenes of piety and devotion since he came to Ireland, but nothing had impressed him so much as Lough Derg.\n\nHere, he said, he had met people of every rank and station in life, rich and poor, performing the rigorous exercises of the pilgrimage, and what he greatly admired was that, notwithstanding the severity of the exercises, rendered even more severe by the inclement weather, all of them were perfectly happy.\n\nWhen Archbishop Pisani and the Bishop of Clogher were leaving the island, the pilgrims assembled on the pier and sang ” God Bless Our Pope.” From the boat, Archbishop Pisani and the Bishop of of Clogher imparted their blessings to the pilgrims, who sang the ” Farwell Hymn to Lough Derg,” and the ” Hymn to St. Patrick.” –\n\nAmidst rousing cheers the boat, which was manned by ten sturdy oarsmen, set out for the Pettigo shore. The party afterwards proceeded by motor to Bundoran, where they visited the Very Rev. Canon McGrath, P.P., and afterwards went to Enniskillen, where they were received by Right Rev. Monsignor Tierney, P.P., V.G. Archbishop Pisani visited St. Michael’s Church, Enniskillen. Later he and the Bishop of Clogher left for Monaghan.\n\nYesterday afternoon Archbishop Pisani visited his Eminence Cardinal MacRory at Armagh.\n\nOther News; Fermoy Aerodrome, which will be occupied by a squadron of the Free State Army Air Force, with Planes, for training purposes.\n\nIrish Examiner 1841-current, Tuesday, August 16, 1932; Page: 4\n\nLOUGH DERG- The Annual Pilgrimage.\n\nLongford, Monday- During the weekend there was a last hour’s rush of pilgrims for the lonely island of Lough Derg, among the hills of Donegal. This three months’ pilgrimage- ends to-day, and as it is a three-day pilgrimage, this was the last day for pilgrims to avail of this year’s penitential exercises on St. Patrick’s Purgatory, as the island in the lake is named. Rain was falling on Saturday evening as the last boat left the mainland for the Island with its full complement of pilgrims. They returned to-day after three days’ fasting and praying. Some of them went to the island barefooted. Those who wore boots or shoes discarded them on reaching the island and proceeded on their rounds of the Stations, beads in hand, traversing the rugged ground amongst the Saints Beds on the Island. Lough Derg stands out above all other holy places in Ireland as a penitential spot where the weary sinner, cut off from the world, can make his peace with God, or where the piously inclined has ample means of getting nearer to God, through fasting, corporal austerities and spiritual vigil. It was there Saint Patrick spent a penitential season, and from a cave in one of the islands of the lake he was vouchsafed a glimpse of the fire of Purgatory. The Apostle of Ireland was initiated in his austerities by many saints and sinners, until the spot became fatuous throughout the Continent as a place of pilgrimage. Its fame passed into literature, so that It inspired many mediaeval writers, the manuscripts of whose works still survive. Dante and Ariosto fell under its spell, and it is possible that the former’s Purgatorio owes not a little in conception and outline to St. Patrick’s Purgatory.\n\nMany people this year travelled to it many miles barefooted and in prayer and fasting. In this Eucharistic Congress year distinguished visitors from all parts of the globe have visited this Island of Peace in a troubled world.\n\nIrish Press 1931-1995, Monday, June 05, 1933; Page: 7\n\nLOUGH DERG PILGRIMS\n\nLarge numbers of men and women travelled from Dublin to Lough Derg on Saturday to take part in the first pilgrimage of the year.

Father Basil, O.M.Cap.\n\nIrish Press 1931-1995, Wednesday, August 16, 1933; Page: 2\n\nAlmost 15,000 Visited Island Shrine LOUGH DERG\n\n(IRISH PRESS Correspondent.) PETTIGO, Tuesday.- TO-DAY witnessed the final scenes at St. Patrick’s Purgatory, Lough Derg, when 340 pilgrims embarked for the mainland, thence to journey to their homes in remote parts of Ireland and Great Britain, thus bringing to a close one of the most successful pilgrimage season’s on record. In the famine year of 1846 the highest recorded number of pilgrims 30,000 visited the island. This year the pilgrims numbered 14815, which surpasses the previous modern record of 14,287 in 1919. The previous highest figure since the famine was in 1916\n\n, when 10,584 visited the shrine. A remarkable feature this year has been the number of young men and women who made the pilgrimage for the first time. Most of them expressed their intention of returning in future years. Right Rev. Monsignor Keown, P.P., V.G., Prior in Charge of the Island, and his assistants, Rev. Fr. Meegan, C.C., and Rev. Fr. McKenna, C.C., were unceasing in their ministration to the pilgrims. To-day Pettigo presented a deserted appearance. At the Shrine itself, the staff who tended the pilgrims are busy making preparations to depart, and the boats are being secured against the winter storms on Lough Derg. By the end of the week the caretaker will be keeping his lonely watch undisturbed until preparations are begun for the pilgrimages of 1934.\n\nIrish Examiner 1841-current, Tuesday, May 22, 1934; Page: 7\n\nLOUGH DERG- Dates Of This Year’s Pilgrimages.\n\nIn consequence of the numerous’ enquiries received from participants of the popular Westland Row pilgrimages to Lough Derg, patrons and their friends will kindly note the following are the dates :— Saturdays, 9th, 16th and 23rd June.

The party, which was led by Very Rev. Fr. Antonine, O.F.M., Guardian, consisted of fifty-two ladies and two gentlemen from Waterford City, Tramore and other County Waterford centres. They were seen off by numerous friends whose presence, added to that of the pilgrims, attracted much attention. After Mountmellick, their first halt will be made at the Multyfarnham Franciscan College for tea, and thence they will proceed to Sligo, where they will spend the night. The journey will be resumed tomorrow morning, and the pilgrims are timed to reach Lough Derg about noon.

In the early hours of this morning it was rumoured that a pilgrim had been cured,\n\nBut enquiries made from the medical bureau, which has been opened at the nearby convent, failed to a comfirmation of the report. From six o’clock this morning until noon the Holy sacrifice of the Mass was offered. Over 2,000 people approached the Altar Rails. At the conclusion of the 12 O’clock Mass an interesting sermon on the feast of the Assumption was given by Rev, Fr. Corcoran, C.C., Knock. On Sunday next the annual pilgrimage will take place from Dublin, and it is understood that Alderman A. Byrne, Lord Mayor of Dublin, will be amongst those to travel from the capital on that day.\n\nMr. Patrick Byrne, one of those who witnessed the apparition, presented our representative with some of the mortar taken from the gable of the church at the time of the apparition, in the year 1879.\n\nLOUGH DERG SHRINE. Pilgrimages Close On Feast Of Assumption.\n\nGalway, Thursday.—There were striking final scenes at St. Patrick’s Purgatory on the famous island in Lough Derg, Co. Donegal, when the penitential pilgrimage for 1935 concluded on the Feast of the Assumption. This year no fewer than 13,0OO pilgrims from all parts of Ireland, Great Britain, and beyond the seas, visited the island and carried out the three days’ devotional and penitential exercises. One feature was that an increasing number came from the western counties of Ireland, notably Kerry, Clare, Galway, Roscommon, and Mayo. One hundred and forty travelled from Liverpool and did the pilgrimage together, whilst increasing numbers of English and Scotch clergymen have visited the island this year.\n\nOn the concluding nights of the pilgrimage the famous basilica of St. Patrick, the conception of Scott, and the only basilica in these islands, was illuminated fully. During the all-night vigil the three Altars and the beautiful translucent alabaster pulpit gleamed under the great dome as eleven hundred pilgrims recited the Stations unceasingly throughout the night watches until Mass was celebrated by Right Rev. Monsignor Keown. P.P., V.G., at 6.30 in the morning. The last boats which arrived on the island on Tuesday brought the final contingents of 460 pilgrims, mostly from the nearby hills and farms and townships of Donegal.\n\nIrish Press 1931-1995, Wednesday, June 24, 1936; Page: 6\n\nARMY PILGRIMAGE- Big Party Travelling- To Lough Derg\n\nThe annual Army Pilgrimage to Lough Derg will leave Amiens Street Station, Dublin, to-morrow morning at 9.25 o’clock.

Contains several rocky islands. Two of which were the scene of St Patrick’s Purgatory. The legend of the vision of St Patrick was made known about the middle of the 12th century, by Henry and English Benedictine monk. Described the descent of Owain, a knight of the King of Stephen in 1153.\n\nPope Alexander V1 ordered its destruction, carried out in 1479, but it sprang up again under Pope Pius 111 and continued for next two centuries. Inserted in Roman Missal 1522. Was made subject of a drama by Caldern. 1632 The Lord Justices of Ireland Prohibited all such assemblies, also in 1704 an act was passed again prohibiting such assemblies. Monastery destroyed on Saints Island, only ruins there now. See Moore’s Melodies for some lines on Lough Derg.\n\n“I wish I was by that dim lake.\n\nWhere sinful souls their farewell take\n\nOf this vain world, and halfway lie\n\nIn Death’s cold shadow ere they die”\n\nIsland of Sanctuary is about half a mile from the shore, contains St Patrick’s and St Mary’s Churches, a Bell Tower, a presbytery and a large hospice for pilgrims.\n\n1st June to 15th August is prescribed time for going to the Island.

Among the pilgrims were a group of forty-five who travelled from Tralee , Listowel and West Limerick district by special bus. They had spent the preceding night at the Yeats Country Hotel, Rosses Point, outside Sligo, and so arrived at the island fresh to face the various, difficult exercises. On the first night a vigil was kept in St Patrick’s Basilica. Right Rev. Monsignor Ward, P.P.. Dean of Lough Derg, welcomed the pilgrims and imparted the Papal Blessing which had been granted by Our Holy Father to all pilgrims. The Dean preached a short sermon in Irish and told of the many spiritual benefits to be gained by visiting Lough Derg and carrying out the station exercises properly. Lough Derg will be visited by many thousands of pilgrims between now and August 15, when the season closes. Dean Ward was very interested to learn from Mr. Michael Kennelly of Listowel of arrangements being made to bring a group of 50 German Catholic Youth from Wurthburg in Southern Germany, to Lough Derg early in August.\n\nTRALEE BRANCH OF THE LABOUR PARTY At a special meeting: of the above Branch, held on Saturday, a sincere vote of sympathy was passed to the relatives of the late Rev.

Kerry.\n\nNOTE.—The pilgrimage season at Lough Derg closes on the 15th August so this will be the final trip during the present season\n\nLimerick Leader 1905-current, Saturday, March 16, 1957; Page: 9\n\nLIMERICK TO LOUGH DERG PILGRIMAGE\n\nWe are requested to Introduce to the reading public a Limerick pilgrimage to Lough Derg, sponsored by St. Munchin’s Parish, and we very willingly do so, believing that it will help to render still more illustrious the fame of our National Pilgrimage and attract many pilgrims from our city who otherwise might not be attracted to this holy Shrine.\n\nThe pious exercise of pilgrimage is as old as religion itself From the earliest ages the Church has never failed to foster and to cherish this religious practice. Love and veneration for the places rendered memorable by the life and sufferings of Our Divine Lord, of the Apostles and the servants of God, impel the faithful in the spirit of religious fervour to visit these holy places\n\nTHE PILGRIM SPIRIT.\n\nThat the children of the Irish race were largely endowed with the pilgrim spirit is sufficiently attested by the great number of places of pilgrimage throughout the country. Pilgrimage to crosses and holy wells were—and still continue to a considerable extent—a very popular and cherished devotion among the Catholics of Ireland. Of these crosses many were blessed by saints whose name they bear, while others were dedicated to them and placed under their tutelage. According to O’Kelly, there were four principal places of pilgrimage in Ireland, one in each of the provinces, namely, St Patrick’s Mountain (Croagh Patrick in Connacht), St Patrick’s Purgatory in Ulster, St. Michael’s Rock in Munster (namely, Skellig-Mlchael off the coast of Kerry) and St. Kevin’s, Glendalough, in Leinster. Amongst these, St. Patrick’s Purgatory, Lough Derg, has always held a foremost place, and it must be regarded as by pre-eminence the national pilgrimage of Ireland. Its course of penance at the present day finds no parallel in the Christian world. Many saints found there a desert of seclusion and pilgrims of every rank and condition of life have trod there the hard road of penance.\n\nORIGIN OF THE TITLE.\n\nOne may question the title of St Patrick’s Purgatory’ That it was so called because of any similarity between its exercises and the sufferings of the purgatorial state hereafter no one will for a moment admit. A reason for this title Is given in a Louvain Treatise of the 17th century, called the ” Mirror of Penance.” We are there told that St Patrick removed from the distractions of the world in this island and prayed that the pains of purgatory might be revealed to him. His request was granted. St. Patrick was so much awed by this vision, that he ordered henceforth the Island to be made a terrestrial purgatory where sinners could atone for their sins by prayer and fasting- .\n\nSALUTARY INFLUENCE.\n\nSince the days of the National Apostle it has extended Its salutary influence not only to the Celtic race but to pilgrims even from the most distant nations. This sanctuary, still amongst the most noted in Europe, was listed during the ages of the faith by pilgrims not only from every part of these islands, but from France, Spain, Germany, and Austria and even from Italy itself. For centuries past the Holy See has enriched it with many spiritual favours, and to those who perform the pilgrimage it has bestowed a plenary indulgence\n\nA SHRINE OF GREAT ANTIQUITY.\n\nIn these days of awakened fervour when the pilgrim spirit has been so amazingly revived in the Church, and when so many leave Ireland journeying to far-off shrines, perhaps this year some people may visit Lough Derg—a shrine within our own boundaries, a shrine of greater antiquity and celebrity, not only one of our proudest glories, but one of the brightest of the religious institutions of Ireland.\n\n(Full details of the pilgrimage, which will leave Limerick on Saturday, June 1st, will be found in an advertisement on page eleven of this Issue).\n\nIrish Examiner 1841-current, Monday, July 20, 1959; Section: Front page, Page: 1\n\nLOUGH DERG- St. Patrick’s Purgatory, Co.
