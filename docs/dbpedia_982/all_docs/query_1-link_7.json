        "text": "The Foundation was created in 1847 under the terms of the will of Thomas Henry, a merchant in Downpatrick, Co Down. The principal objective of the Foundation is to promote agricultural science, innovation and good farming practice in Northern Ireland.\n\nTo this end the Foundation supports those engaged within the agricultural sector in Northern Ireland, primarily working farmers, who engage upon courses with the objective of advancing agricultural knowledge for the benefit of farmers and growers.\n\nThe Thomas Henry Foundation provides an annual scholarship awarded by the Nuffield Farming Scholarship Trust to encourage the interchange and development of knowledge in the science and practice of agriculture as well as the development of personal skills and leadership.\n\nThe Foundation also provides financial assistance to a number of appropriate agricultural organisations within Northern Ireland.\n\n“The Nuffield Farming Scholarship Trust enables us to fulfil our objectives successfully on a larger scale than we can in the Province. It enables Scholars to access expertise and ideas from around the world which they can bring back, disseminate and apply locally. A Nuffield Scholarship also develops communication and life skills which Scholars use to positively influence progress within our farming industry.”"
