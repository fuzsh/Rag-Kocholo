        "text": "Thomas Stephens Lough, a longtime peace activist and sociology professor,\n\nwas on the faculty at Ohio's Kent State University in May 1970 when the\n\nNational Guard fired on students demonstrating there against the Vietnam War.\n\nFour students died and at least nine were wounded, the bloodiest episode\n\nduring the country's anti-war protests.\n\nSoon after the shooting, Lough wrote to his students: ''Kent's sorrow has\n\nbecome the nation's outrage, and you were there. Don't forget it.''\n\nLough, who later taught six years at Sonoma State University and was a\n\nstrong supporter of the university's Project Censored, died Oct. 11 of heart\n\nfailure at a palliative care unit in Santa Rosa. He was 80.\n\nHis wife, Elaine Wellin, an adjunct professor of sociology at Sonoma State,\n\nsaid her husband believed the nation would have fewer social ills ''if people\n\nknew what was going on in the government'' and in corporate America.\n\nLough worked with Project Censored for a decade and last year served as one\n\nof its four national judges. This fall, he was named to the organization's\n\nHall of Fame.\n\nA native of Detroit, Lough earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical\n\nengineering and later received a master's degree and doctorate in sociology,\n\nall at the University of Michigan.\n\nDuring the Kennedy administration, he worked on disarmament issues for the\n\nState Department and later served in the disarmament affairs division of the\n\nUnited Nations.\n\nHe taught at Kent State from 1968 until about 1991. He later taught classes\n\nat Eastern Michigan University and the University of Michigan.\n\nHe and Wellin purchased land near Cazadero in 1976 and built a home, where\n\nthey lived a few months each year. Lough moved full time to Sonoma County in\n\n1997. The couple also had a home in Rohnert Park.\n\nBesides his college career, he was a professional pianist who specialized\n\nin ragtime and boogie-woogie music. For many decades, he held a pilot's\n\nlicense.\n\nAlong with his wife, survivors include four children, Alexander Lough of\n\nSanta Rosa, Martha Armstrong and Janet Daniel, both of Madison, Wis., and\n\nJoseph Lough of Berkeley; a sister, Evelyn Montgomery of Grosse Pointe, Mich.;\n\nand seven grandchildren.\n\nA memorial service will be at 1 p.m. Nov. 22 at the Sebastopol Youth Annex,\n\n425 Morris Ave.\n\n-- Robert Digitale"
