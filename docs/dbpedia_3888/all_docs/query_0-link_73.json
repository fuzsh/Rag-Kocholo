The one that lets you set how often the wipers, uh, wipe? That setting was invented by a man named Bob Kearns.\n\nThe big three automakers won't tell you that, however.\n\nGreg Kinnear stars as Kearns in a based-on-a-true-story film of a man seeking to get recognition of his invention by the automakers who he claimed stole it from him. and the legal battle of one man vs. three giants and how it put a strain on both himself and his family. Co-stars include BOP-fave Lauren Graham as Kearns' wife, Dermot Mulroney as his best friend and Alan Alda as the lawyer on his side. The film marks the directorial debut of producer Marc Abraham and was adapted from a New Yorker article into a film by Philip Railsback.\n\nMovies about someone that virtually nobody has heard of are sometimes tough sells, but if the trailer can come off as inspirational enough and it's marketed properly, Flash of Genius can certainly find a niche.
