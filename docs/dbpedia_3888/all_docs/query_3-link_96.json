        "text": "Though he makes a living as a professor of engineering, Bob Kern was born to invent. Having first discovered his hidden passion at the young age of thirteen, Bob eagerly awaits his next great thought, jumping at the chance to show the world his true brilliance. One night, while out in the garage with his sons, Bob pieces together a mechanism that would eventually be used in every car made. Thinking that he had struck gold, Bob, his wife and six kids hung tight on cloud nine. However, much to their disbelief, the same automobile giants who embraced Bob's creation early on, unanimously shun him as the man who invented it. The affects of the detrimental denial sends Bob into a state of utter shock and confusion. He becomes obsessed with taking down the corporate tycoons, refusing large settlement checks, wanting nothing more than a public apology of wrongdoing. Paying the detrimental price for his stubbornness, Bob stands up to the Goliath of corporate America, proving that David can be seen in any shape or size.\n\nWhile the film carries the same message as numerous films before it, Flash of Genius has something that few other films are able to generate\"Â¦a soul. Triggered by a quiet and serene performance by both Greg Kinnear and Lauren Graham, the film reaches heights that you never thought imaginable, taking you on a journey of emotion, heartache and rediscovery.\n\nGreat Kinnear, one of the most underappreciated actors in Hollywood, plays the lead role of Bob. Tackling the job of creating a frustrated and misunderstood man, Kinnear gives the performance of his life, bringing both intensity and calmness to the screen. His motions are deliberate and honest as he ventures between those he can trust and those who understand him. His emotions are constantly in check, and through the clever use of body language and tone, Kinnear is able to bring all of it to the forefront. In the process, he creates a man of confidence and pride, never giving in to the corporate powerhouses and never taking no for an answer. He is a man of restraint and outpouring love, two factors that Kinnear portrays perfectly.\n\nSadly, the film focuses in large part on Kinnear, taking very little time to develop and grow those around him. As a result, we lose track of both the children and Phyllis Kerns, Bob's wife. Played by 'Gilmore Girls' alum Lauren Graham, Phyllis is an understanding wife who tries to cope with her husband's new found obsession. She loves Bob to no end; however, she understands the importance of her kids, ultimately choosing their best interest over his. Graham's performance is stellar in terms of the part that she was given as she takes each scene and works it to utter perfection. Her movements are dead on and her chemistry with Kinnear is one of pure brilliance. If only she hadn't left the screen for almost forty-five minutes.\n\nIn fact, the lack of growth in the supporting characters is what really deterred me from giving the film a strong A-rating. By leaving out those around him, Bob becomes an isolated figure of society, never really materializing much and sadly, never venturing on with his life. We see no hardships, no graduations and no subplot development. The story was on a straight course, never venturing off the beaten path to an unknown area. And while it is great that the film was so concerned with the final outcome, there was a whole lot more that deserved to be told."
