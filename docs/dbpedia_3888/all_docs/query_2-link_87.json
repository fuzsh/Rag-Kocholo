        "text": "Hank Williams was arguably the first modern superstar of\n\ncountry music. There’s also a sense in which you could call him a rock star,\n\nand the sense is a tragic one: he died on the way to a gig, of heart failure,\n\nafter a short lifetime of not taking terribly good care of himself—age 29. His\n\nsongs remain country standards and rightly so, but there’s not much room for his\n\nhaunted persona in contemporary country. Williams’ son, whose name you might be\n\nable to guess, projects a much hairier and more rambunctious model and is, as\n\nsuch, more of an influence. (“You Sure Hank Done It This Way?” is the name of a\n\nrueful State-Of-Country song cut by Waylon Jennings. Back in 1975, for heaven’s\n\nsake.)\n\n“I Saw The Light,” written and directed by Marc Abraham, is\n\na never-less-than-handsomely-mounted film biography of Williams; the\n\nparticularly outstanding cinematography is by Dante Spinotti, the craftsman who\n\nalso shot the likes of “Heat” and “L.A. Confidential.” Williams is played by\n\nthe lanky, high-cheekboned British actor Tom Hiddleston, and he’s a terrific\n\nphysical match for the man himself, who had a perpetual lean-and-hungry look.\n\nHiddleston’s performance is a masterful one: understated, superbly modulated,\n\nempathetic. Hiddleston can also mimic Williams’ yodel-inflected singing style,\n\nwhich brought the innovation of classic country warbler Jimmie Rodgers into a\n\nmore pop-friendly realm, with impressive accuracy. While Hiddleston’s is the\n\nstandout performance, and why not, the rest of the cast is formidable: Elizabeth Olsen, Cherry Jones, Bradley Whitford, David Krumholtz and a host of\n\nothers do superb work in roles of spouse, mother, business associate, and so\n\non.\n\nAnd yet the movie flounders. Williams was a serious\n\nalcoholic and eventually a pain pill addict; his relationships with women were\n\nhectic, to say the least; his massive talent was complemented in the negative\n\nby a substantial and ever-increasing lack of ability to show any kind of\n\nresponsibility. The messy specifics of Williams’ adult life prove too\n\nintransigent for Abraham’s abilities; the writer-director can’t make coherent\n\nart out of them. The key conflict—at least initially—in Williams’ first\n\nmarriage, to Olsen’s Audrey Mae, has to do with her own singing ambitions.\n\nThey’re strong, but her talent is not, and this makes for a series of\n\ndiscomfiting scenes. Abraham’s everyone-has-their-reasons sense of balance may\n\nbe commendable on humanist grounds, and there’s no compelling reason that\n\nAudrey Mae has to be the villain in the scenario, but there’s no effective\n\ntension here; the drama is flat. Later in the film, when Williams’ romantic\n\nimbroglios take on a nearly farcical pitch, he behaves with staggering\n\ncallousness to one of his girlfriends (Wrenn Schmidt’s Bobbie Jett) and the movie can barely\n\nshrug its shoulders. Many opportunities for character illumination are fluffed.\n\nIn a meeting with Hollywood movie mogul Dore Schary, Williams arrogantly\n\nrefuses to take off his hat for the executive. The implication is that\n\nTinseltown’s too phony for Williams. Mere minutes later, Hank is doing some\n\nvery cornball schtick with an overweight comic emcee on the Grand Ole Opry\n\nradio show. This suggests a dichotomy that might have been fruitfully explored.\n\nBut it is not."
