        "text": "Facing a PR nightmare with the David-vs.-Goliath movie Flash of Genius, the Big Bad Ford Motor Co. earnestly is telling people the film about its epic fight with inventor Bob Kearns over the invention of intermittent wipers dramatizes facts \"for entertainment purposes.\" We certainly hope so, or there'd be no point seeing the movie.\n\nFord lays out its case in a press release titled, \"Key facts about the intermittent windshield wiper issue,\" which, coincidentally, was the film's working title. It includes a timeline -- shaped like the path of a wiper across a windshield -- laying out key milestones in rain-removal technology. A blown-up version of the poster now hangs in this writer's bedroom, alongside memorabilia like a framed technical service bulletin from GM addressing a defect in which '82 Pontiac Firebirds began talking to their owners.\n\nFord is in a tough place. Already facing pressure from environmental groups, unions and consumers, the last thing the struggling automaker needs is a movie dinging its image like a runaway shopping cart. \"If I was the PR guy on this one, what I would do is ... apologize for a different time in the industry,\" marketing professor Michael Bernacchi told the *Detroit *Free Press. \"This is not a time to deny. The no-comment will get them nowhere.\"\n\nObviously, Ford's PR folk weren't students of Prof. Bernacchi. In its terse statement, Ford takes its cues from the Chilean response to the Pinochet regime: \"Ford sees no value in rehashing the history of a legal case that was resolved in court almost 20 years ago,\" the press release snarls. Yet that's just what it's done with that silly timeline. Don't forgive, don't forget, but get the last word seems to be the company's approach. While not quite as damning as Ford's own Pinto Memo, Flash certainly portrays Ford as a cold, impersonal company. This press release doesn't do anything to help.\n\nPS5 vs PS5 Slim: What’s the Difference, and Which One Should You Get?\n\nCan you spot all the differences between these two consoles? No?
