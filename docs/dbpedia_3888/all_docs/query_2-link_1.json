Also for Universal Pictures, Abraham is producing Trouble is My Business, an adaptation of Raymond Chandler's detective-noir classic, starring Clive Owen.[2] He produced the remake of The Thing for Strike Entertainment alongside Eric Newman.[3][4]\n\nEven with the disestablishment of Strike Entertainment in 2013, Abraham and Newman still produced the 2014 film RoboCop under the Strike Entertainment name since it started production in 2012.[5]\n\nAbraham directed, wrote and produced the 2015 Hank Williams biopic I Saw the Light, which starred Tom Hiddleston.
