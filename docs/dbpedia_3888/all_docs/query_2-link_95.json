        "text": "Audiences and actors alike love movies based upon real people. Of the characters played by the last five winners of the Best Actor Oscar, four of them were based on real individuals. In fact, in each of the last three years, 80 percent of the nominees in that category were based on actual people. This, as they say, is a thing.\n\nIt’s easy to understand why, of course. The subjects usually live or lived larger-than-life lives, which is a thrill for audiences to experience and actors to embody. Still, it takes top-shelf writing, directing and acting to garner all those awards, and it’s worth remembering that for every “Revenant” there’s a “J. Edgar,” and for every “Steve Jobs” there’s a movie like “Jobs.”\n\nInteresting or famous subject matter just isn’t enough to make a movie good. Sadly, that is the case with “I Saw the Light,” the new biopic about the legendary country-western musician Hank Williams, gamely played here by Tom Hiddleston, best known as the Machiavellian Loki in the Marvel movies.\n\nThere is no amount of trickery, however, that can turn “I Saw the Light” into something more interesting than it is. The movie, written and directed by Marc Abraham, is clearly a labor of love, but as such it falls into the traps that plague so many biopics.\n\nIt is long, ponderous and unable to leave anything out. It takes itself far too seriously, and never really seems to capture the spirit of Williams. Hiddleston, despite bearing a strong resemblance to the musician, is, at 35, far too old to play the role, already half-a-dozen years older than Williams was at the time of his death. He’s charming and charismatic, certainly, and he’s working hard here, but the deck is stacked against him.\n\nThe direction is sluggish, and veterans like Cherry Jones and Bradley Whitford are wasted in supporting roles. Elizabeth Olsen, who is also familiar with the Avengers movies, gets the better of it as Audrey, Williams’ first wife and the mother of Hank Williams Jr. The part is fleshed out and more substantial, and she and Hiddleston have some nice chemistry.\n\nBut though Williams is frequently shown to be drinking and popping pills, his infamous womanizing is suggested more than shown, and the tumultuousness of their marriage often seems contrived, a device that has to be played out simply because that’s what actually happened.\n\nWhat the movie never truly captures, too, is how important a figure Williams was, the impact his music had, and what he truly meant to so many people of that time. He was a remarkable musician, but “I Saw the Light” is an unremarkable film. Fans of the “Your Cheatin’ Heart” singer are likely to find themselves feeling cheated, cinematically."
