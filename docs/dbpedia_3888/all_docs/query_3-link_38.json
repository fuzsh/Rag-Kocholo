        "text": "Next time you’re driving in a light rain, I want you to think about Robert Kearns as your wipers rhythmically squeak across the windshield.\n\nWho’s Robert Kearns, you ask? Oh, just the most tenacious inventor who ever lived. Or at least that’s the impression “Flash of Genius” projects as it methodically chronicles the rise, fall and resurrection of the man who devised the intermittent windshield wiper.\n\nHow significant is his invention? It’s not quite up there with the hubcap and the cup holder, mind you, but the air bags in Hollywood thought it worthy of a movie, the first in what could become a series of auto parts spin-offs like “Rear Window: The Defogger Chronicles.”\n\nAs we all know, windshield wipers are a compelling study. Just try driving through a downpour without them. Still, we take them for granted, just like Ford Motor Co. took Kearns for granted when it stole his patent for what he called his “Blinking Eye Motor.”\n\nBut unlike the guys who invented lug nuts and radiator hoses, Kearns did not go quietly into the victimized night. He fought back and fought back hard for 13 long years, losing his family and a good deal of his sanity in the process.\n\nPredictability, a shallow script and placid characterizations rob “Genius” of a lot of its flash. Yet it manages to be mildly entertaining thanks to a superb performance by Greg Kinnear as Kearns.\n\nHe more than justifies his Oscar buzz by nailing a part that not only requires him to convincingly age 15 years in two hours, but also demands that he go from a happy-go-lucky Detroit college professor with an adoring wife and six wholesome kids to a disheveled wreck suffering the pangs of addiction.\n\nKinnear has always been great at playing obsessed men, from sex-crazed actor Bob Crane in “Auto Focus” to the driven self-help guru in “Little Miss Sunshine.” But never has it been so interesting keeping up with his jonesing.\n\nHis performance conveys depth and substance. In other words, it’s got everything the film lacks, as it repeatedly undermines his superior work with inferior writing and uninspired direction.\n\nAs with many recent biopics like “Ray” and “Walk the Line,” “Flash of Genius” is little more than a Cliff Notes primer hitting upon all the high and low points of a person’s life without benefit of any context or complexity.\n\nWriter Philip Railsback, adapting a 1993 New Yorker piece by John Seabrook, and producer-turned-director Marc Abraham repeatedly ask their audience to fill in the blanks of a poorly edited, under-developed story.\n\nOne minute Kearns is a happily married father, the next his wife (a sappy Lauren Graham) and kids are packing up and leaving him. Why? It’s as big a mystery as why the kids suddenly go from resenting him for his selfish pursuit of justice to helping him mount his many appeals after he becomes his own lawyer.\n\nAn even bigger question is the root of Kearns’ obsessive behavior, as he turns his back on family and career in order to feed his habit through a legal system that provides just enough of a high to keep him coming back until it teasingly leaves him cold turkey when he needs it most.\n\nIn that respect, “Flash of Genius” does offers up a convincing indictment of a court system that’s supposed to tilt toward the Davids of the world but almost always ends up protecting the Goliaths through endless motions, stays and legal fees that make it virtually impossible to take on large corporations.\n\nSeeing Kearns doggedly fight the power, including his high-priced lawyer (Alan Alda in a too-short stay), is indeed cathartic in a crowd-pleasing way. And the timing of the movie is interesting, checking in with the big automakers during this difficult time. Watching how Kearns was treated, you can’t help but wonder if their current financial flop is some kind of severe car-mic retribution."
