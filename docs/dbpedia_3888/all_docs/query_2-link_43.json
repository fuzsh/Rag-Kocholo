        "text": "You could say he’s the Erin Brockovich of the automobile industry.\n\nFor decades, Robert W. Kearns, an engineer and college professor, battled a corporate giant — in this case, the Ford Motor Company — in court over his patents on a windshield wiper that worked better in light rain.\n\nMr. Kearns’s story begins on his wedding night, when a Champagne cork struck his eye. The accident spurred him to wonder: If the human eye can blink periodically, why can’t a car’s windshield wipers?\n\nWorking from his Detroit basement, Mr. Kearns created a prototype for what is now a standard feature, the intermittent windshield wiper.\n\nHe showed his invention to Ford and secured multiple patents for it in 1967, but was not able to get the automaker to license it. Two years later, Ford introduced intermittent wipers on its cars. Other carmakers followed.\n\nMr. Kearns sued Ford in 1978 and Chrysler in 1982, both for patent infringement, and represented himself in court.\n\n“Flash of Genius,” which opens on Friday, is about Mr. Kearns’s life and his fight against the American automakers. It stars Greg Kinnear as Robert W. Kearns and Lauren Graham as his wife.\n\nThe movie is directed by Marc Abraham, who is making his directing debut after years as a succesful producer. Mr. Abraham agreed to answer a few questions about the movie.\n\nQ. What attracted you to this story?\n\nA. I just fell in love with the story because it really isn’t about the intermittent windshield wiper, it’s about someone who has a dream — like so many of us do — and he decided he wasn’t going to take it when somebody stole his dream. What I was attracted to was that the story was about principle, and that people could really understand and relate to that. That’s what I was drawn to. It’s a classic American tale, and I think when you sit there and watch the movie, it opens up to that. You get way past the idea of what the invention was and really get to the core of what the film is.\n\nQ. What appealed to you about Mr. Kearns himself?\n\nA. What appealed to me is that he was such a human character, that his attributes were balanced by his faults. Despite overwhelming odds, he was not willing to allow someone to steal his idea or take away his dignity.\n\nQ. If Mr. Kearns were alive today, what do you think he’d say about the state of the automobile industry?\n\nA. I think the word schadenfreude would be somewhere in the ether circling his reaction. I think he would have said he could’ve predicted it based upon their business practices. And that somewhere deep down, as a man who grew up in the shadow of the great Ford River Rouge plant, he would be a little sad.\n\nQ. What would he say about your movie representation of him?\n\nA. I think Bob Kearns would say that Greg’s better looking than he is. He’d wish the movie spanned more years, because he took a beating for more time than is shown in the film. I think that, over all, he would be pleased.\n\nQ. Could a Robert Kearns exist today?\n\nA. Probably more difficult to find one, but I would hope so."
