Based on a true story. Also with Lauren Graham, Jake Abel, Bill Smitrovich, Aaron Abrams, Dermot Mulroney and Tim Kelleher. Directed by Marc Abraham. [2:00]\n\nSEX/NUDITY 1 - We see a woman in a nightgown (cleavage is revealed and we can see the outline of her legs through the fabric), and she and her husband kiss; she seems to want him to come to bed, but he goes to work instead. A husband and wife kiss.\n\n► Men and woman dance together at parties.\n\n► Women at a car show wear revealing outfits (cleavage, bare shoulders and bare legs are shown). Women wear low-cut dresses that reveal cleavage.\n\nVIOLENCE/GORE 5 - We briefly see a decapitated head in a helmet on a lab table (blood and tissue and bone is visible at the neck).\n\n► A man is depressed and we see him in a mental institution and talking to doctors about his condition.\n\n► A man steals something from a man's car, runs to his car, the man chases him on foot, throws his drinking glass at the car, and the man gets away.\n\nLANGUAGE 5 - 1 F-word, 5 scatological terms, 2 anatomical terms, 11 mild obscenities, name-calling (insane), 3 religious profanities, 7 religious exclamations.\n\nSUBSTANCE USE - People drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes in a bar scene, people drink alcohol at a party, people drink alcohol in several dinner scenes, and a man drinks a beer. People smoke cigarettes in several scenes throughout the movie. A man takes prescription medications in a couple of scenes.\n\nDISCUSSION TOPICS - Ethics, corporate ethics, corporate greed, family, less is more, patents, failure, success, luck, timing, stress, lying, separation of family, divorce, desperation, giving up, justice, mental breakdown.\n\nMESSAGE - Ethics should win out over money. The definition of success is different for different people.\n\nCAVEATS\n\nBe aware that while we do our best to avoid spoilers it is impossible to disguise all details and some may reveal crucial plot elements.\n\nWe've gone through several editorial changes since we started covering films in 1992 and older reviews are not as complete & accurate as recent ones; we plan to revisit and correct older reviews as resources and time permits.\n\nOur ratings and reviews are based on the theatrically-released versions of films; on video there are often Unrated, Special, Director's Cut or Extended versions, (usually accurately labelled but sometimes mislabeled) released that contain additional content, which we did not review.\n\nREVIEWS\n\nSee ratings & reviews at Critics.com\n\nWEB LINKS\n\nOfficial Site IMDb\n\nFILTER by RATINGS\n\nDid you know you can now filter searches by any combination of ratings? Just go to our search page or use the search bar, with or without a keyword, from the top navigation menu. Move sliders from 0-10 in any combination, check and uncheck MPAA ratings and use keywords to further filter results -- please let us know what you think.\n\nTHE ASSIGNED NUMBERS\n\nUnlike the MPAA we do not assign one inscrutable rating based on age but 3 objective ratings for SEX/NUDITY, VIOLENCE/GORE & LANGUAGE on a scale of 0 to 10, from lowest to highest depending on quantity & context |more|\n\nFIND US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nFollowFollow\n\nFollowFollow\n\nadvertisement\n\nCOPYRIGHT POLICY\n\nPrint a page, share with friends, and yes, please go ahead and email links.
