Tom Hiddleston (The Avengers, High Rise) starred alongside Elizabeth Olsen and Bradley Whitford. In 2009, Abraham directed Flash of Genius for Universal, starring Greg Kinnear, Lauren Graham, and Alan Alda. The film won the Alfred P.

He is currently in pre-production for The Hunted, which he adapted from a novel of the same name by Elmore Leonard.\n\nSome of Abraham’s many producing and executive producing credits include Children of Men, Spy Game, The Family Man, The Rundown, Dawn of the Dead, Air Force One, 13 Days, Bring It On, and The Hurricane.\n\nAbraham is a member of the Writers Guild, the Producers Guild, and the Directors Guild, and he is on the board of the Violence Policy Center, “the most effective … anti-gun rabble rouser in Washington,” according to the NRA, and the board of the Virginia Film Festival. He has been honored with the Spirit of Chrysalis Award, which recognized Abraham for his commitment to helping change lives through jobs and helping thousands of disadvantaged and homeless individuals and families in Los Angeles."
