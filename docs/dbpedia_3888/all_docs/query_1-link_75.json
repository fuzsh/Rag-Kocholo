        "text": "TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. | For two decades, Robert Kearns waged an obsessive crusade against the auto industry, which he accused of stealing his invention. It destroyed his marriage, brought on a mental breakdown and may have cost him millions.\n\nAll because of a dispute over a humble piece of equipment: the intermittent windshield wiper.\n\nNot exactly the stuff of Hollywood drama, you say? Veteran film producer Marc Abraham would beg to differ. He found Kearns' story so captivating that instead of hiring a director to bring it to the screen, he did the job himself.\n\n\"There was something about this story that I felt so personally committed to,\" said Abraham, who makes his directorial debut with \"Flash of Genius,\" starring Greg Kinnear as Kearns. The movie, distributed by Universal Pictures, was shown during the recent Traverse City Film Festival and opens in theaters Oct. 17.\n\n\"I've always had a lot of respect for average working people,\" said Abraham, a Kentucky native who drove a beer truck, waited tables and sold baby pictures door-to-door while trying to break into show business. \"Bob wasn't an ordinary man; he was probably a genius. But as a person, his lifestyle, his family scale, he was just an average guy. So I felt like I understood that.\"\n\nKearns died of cancer in 2005 at age 77, four decades after perfecting the intermittent wiper design in his basement workroom. The one-time engineering instructor at Wayne State University in Detroit received numerous patents for his mechanism.\n\nThe idea came to him from the irregular blinking of his left eye, which eventually went blind after being struck by a champagne cork on his wedding night.\n\nKearns took his gadget to Ford Motor Co., which initially showed interest; its engineers had been trying to develop a similar system. But he never reached a licensing agreement with Ford or other automakers, partly because he insisted on forming his own company to manufacture the wipers.\n\nFord began turning out cars with intermittent wipers in 1969, and competitors soon did likewise. Kearns sued Ford in 1978, claiming patent infringement, and took on Chrysler Corp. four years later.\n\nHe ultimately filed lawsuits against 26 companies, including General Motors Corp. Most were tossed out of court, although he won judgments against Ford and Chrysler that ultimately brought him more than $30 million.\n\nKearns insisted his primary motive wasn't money, but principle - a point his character makes repeatedly in the film. He turned down settlement offers more lucrative than what he won from juries.\n\nKearns wanted the automakers to admit they pilfered his design and stop making the wipers so he could do it - a concession he never received. \"What they did was downright wrong,\" his character tells jurors in the movie. \"They used another man's work as their own.\""
