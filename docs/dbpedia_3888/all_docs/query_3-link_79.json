        "text": "Flash Of Genius is one of those films that's most remarkable for all the\n\nthings it doesn't\n\ndo. There's a big courtroom scene, but no gavel-pounding, witness-twisting, or\n\ngrandstanding lawyers. The real-life figure at the center of the lawsuit,\n\ninventor Robert Kearns, loses his family because he insists on doing the right\n\nthing year after year after agonizing year, and yet there's no shrieky \"You're\n\ntearing this family apart!\" confrontation. First-time director Marc Abraham chooses to give Kearns' story a serious,\n\nthinking-viewer gloss, creating a film that's unlikely to provoke cheering or\n\nnail-biting. It lets audiences think they might actually be watching history as\n\nit happened.\n\nGreg Kinnear carries the film with his stellar,\n\ncontrolled, slightly abrasive performance as Kearns, a Detroit\n\nelectrical-engineering professor with a wife (Lauren Graham), six reasonably\n\nwell-behaved but chaotic kids, and an idea. As of the film's opening '60s\n\nsetting, car windshield wipers only have one speed, so they drag and scrape\n\nduring light rain. Through trial, error, and ingenuity, Kearns invents an\n\nadjustable-speed wiper and takes it to the major car companies, with the idea\n\nof manufacturing it himself. The reps at Ford, who've been trying and failing\n\nto develop something similar, seem bowled overâ€”until they get their hands\n\non a working copy to \"test.\" Then they cut him off cold. A year and a half\n\nlater, new Fords start hitting the line with Kearns' design integrated, and he\n\nstarts a David-and-Goliath legal battle that everyone, including his lawyers,\n\nsays he can't win."
