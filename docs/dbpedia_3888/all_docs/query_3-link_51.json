        "text": "Movie Review\n\nDrizzle drizzle swish. Drizzle drizzle swish.\n\nFor much of his life, such sounds must’ve reverberated through inventor Bob Kearns’ mind—the sound of rain wiped away by his greatest creation: the intermittent windshield wiper. That invention, and his fight to receive credit for it, consumed Kearns for decades, sucking him into legal battles with the biggest automakers in the world. By the time he died in 2005, Bob Kearns had collected more than $30 million in settlements from such companies as Ford and Chrysler, according to The Washington Post. But watching the period biopic Flash of Genius, you can’t help but wonder if his life was filled with more drizzle than swish.\n\nAccording to the movie, Bob engineered the wipers in his basement, with a little soldering help from two of his six children. It wasn’t his first invention, but he knew right away it was his best—his “Mona Lisa,” he later says.\n\nHe partners with friend Gil Privick, snagging the rights to manufacture the windshield wiper motors himself. He demonstrates the device to Ford Motor Company, which shows some serious wiper love. He leases a vacant manufacturing building and starts daydreaming about how his life is about to change.\n\nIt does. But not in the way he wants.\n\nFirst, Ford tells Bob and Gil it’s no longer interested in Bob’s wiper. Several months later, Bob sees some shiny new Fords cruise through Detroit one wet evening, their wipers slapping away the rain in a strangely familiar, intermittent fashion. Hmmmm. It seems as though Ford has stolen Bob’s Mona Lisa without so much as a thank you. And, as Bob quickly discovers, it has no intention of giving it back.\n\nBob spirals downward though irritability, paranoia and, eventually, a nervous breakdown. He literally runs away, and police find him on a bus, dressed in his bathrobe and pajamas, mumbling about how he’s got to get to Washington to meet with the vice president.\n\nSo he spends some time in a mental hospital and then comes back, presumably, a changed man.\n\nOnly, he hasn’t changed all that much. He’s still obsessed with getting his rightful due, and soon he decides to take Ford to court. The automotive giant tries to buy him off with progressively higher settlements, but he’s having none of that: He’s not after money. He wants justice.\n\n“This is how justice is dispensed in this country,” Bob’s lawyer reminds him. “With checkbooks.”\n\nBut Bob pushes on, eventually taking the suit on himself when his lawyer refuses to go any farther.\n\nPositive Elements\n\nEarly on, we get the sense that family’s the most important thing in Bob’s life. He and his wife, Phyllis, obviously love each other, and Bob seems to be engaged in his six children’s lives—though, admittedly, a lot of their family activity seems to revolve around Bob’s inventions. They help out in his workshop, celebrate his accomplishments and, after a particularly successful run of the intermittent wiper, the family has a celebratory dinner where the whole clan is christened “The Kearns Corporation.”\n\nBut dedication to family eventually runs up against another virtue: Bob’s unwavering sense of right and wrong.\n\nBob’s a Detroit-area professor when he’s not inventing things, and he reminds his students that engineers can use their smarts for good or evil, telling them that many moral decisions aren’t as clear cut as “deciding between [building] a heart valve and a gas chamber.” When Ford pilfers his intellectual property, it’s as if his every notion of justice is torched at the stake, and he’ll stop at nothing to make them pay.\n\n“This is not about money,” he says. “This is about right and wrong.”\n\nIs that a positive element? Taken to the extremes Bob takes it, perhaps not, and we’ll deal with that more later. But he nevertheless becomes an inspiration to other inventors, and one tells him, “If you don’t fight, the rest of us don’t stand a chance.”\n\nPhyllis has a different take on Bob’s crusade—though she supports him as much as she can throughout much of the movie. She loves her husband and loves her kids, but she understands that one’s self-identity shouldn’t be wrapped up in any one invention—no matter how cool that invention may be. When Bob loses it, it’s Phyllis who picks up the pieces and, eventually, encourages Bob to let go of his anger and refocus on his family. But he can’t, and she eventually leaves him—telling him almost as she walks out the door that she still loves him. That, again, isn’t entirely positive, but certainly much can be learned from it.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe thing about rain on a windshield, Bob Kearns would say, is that it obscures your vision. Even gentle rain makes it impossible to see clearly. Turn off the wipers, and you can’t see at all. Turn them on high, and the wipers start to squeak.\n\nBob’s solution was his intermittent wipers, which he wanted to call the “Kearns Blinking Eye” because the wipers worked like the human eyelid.\n\nDrizzle drizzle swish. Drizzle drizzle swish.\n\nBut for all the ingenuity of that invention, Bob—at least the Bob presented in Flash of Genius—could never quite master the same technique in the rest of his life. When the rain started to fall, Bob couldn’t see clearly. And when he turned his internal wipers on, they kept squealing.\n\nFlash of Genius, a PG-13 biopic that’s hurt most by the profanity it includes, doesn’t overtly say whether Bob’s lifetime could’ve been better spent. By the time the credits roll, he’s reconciled with his children, all of whom take an interest in his legal fights. A jury’s awarded him more than $10 million, acknowledging him as the inventor of the intermittent windshield wiper. We see indications that he’s ready to give up—or at least tone down—his crusade, and Phyllis tells him that he’s gotten everything he wanted.\n\nNot quite, Bob replies. She smiles and walks away.\n\nIn real life, Kearns’ crusades went on. He sued a total of 26 car manufacturers, according to The Washington Post. Most of the suits were dismissed when a weary Kearns couldn’t keep up with the legal system’s filing deadlines. He burned through five law firms. Most of the $30 million he did collect went to legal expenses, it’s said, and Bob largely supported himself via disability checks and trading foreign currencies, continuing to assail his deep-pocketed opponents until his windshield-wiper patents expired.\n\n“I’ve spent a lifetime on this,” Kearns told Regardie‘s magazine in 1990. “This case isn’t just a trial. It’s about the meaning of Bob Kearns’ life.”\n\nIn the film—on the verge of what he thinks will be a life-changing breakthrough—Bob wonders what it is that makes someone successful. Is it talent? Luck? Timing? Phyllis smiles and looks at her six children playing in the front yard—healthy, happy. “I look at you,” Phyllis says, “I look at us and I think, ‘You’re a success, you know?'”\n\nBob pauses, then goes on, as if he didn’t hear. As if he didn’t see."
