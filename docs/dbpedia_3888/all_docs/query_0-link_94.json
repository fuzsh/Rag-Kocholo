It also points out that, you know, sometimes the principle is important and that fighting for the right thing is important and that ultimately there are repercussions of organisations that are not necessarily playing by the rules. And that's not what we set out to-- our job is to make entertainment and to create characters that people can relate to and find that their journey is worthwhile to enjoy on a Saturday afternoon. But sometimes there is a fusion of what's going on in the universe and what you do in art and to some extent that's happened now.\"\n\nEmbargoed: 29th March 2009 13:00\n\nKeywords:\n\nLocation: United Kingdom\n\nCountry: United Kingdom\n\nReuters ID: LVABGGLNJELC7DE9FVG4GRKR4ENI\n\nStory Text: 'Flash of Genius' follows the story of university professor Bob Kearns, the man who invented the intermittent windshield wiper still used on cars today.\n\nWhile that might not seem like the most thrilling topic in the world, it's not Kearns' invention itself that is behind the tale, so much as the epic battle that ensued with some of the most powerful corporations in America over it's use - the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation.\n\nKearns' failed to interest the automakers in licensing his invention - which he had patented in 1964 - for use on their cars, yet they still began installing intermittent windshield wipers on their vehicles shortly after seeing his breakthrough.\n\nWhat followed was a legal struggle that saw him risk everything he had to get recognition for his invention. Rejecting multi million dollar out of court settlements, Kearns seemingly had no interest in money, but challenging .\n\nDespite the fact he had no legal experience, Kearns ended up representing himself in court, even enlisting the help of his wife children in his the ongoing case that was to eventually cost him more than 10 million US dollars.\n\n'Flash of Genius' portrays Kearns not just as a crusading idealist, but as a man who came to be so obsessed with the his battle that he put the welfare of his family and even his mental health at risk.\n\n\"Well you can admire Bob Kearns. You admire his tenacity. I don't know that you necessarily feel that: 'Boy, I wish I were like that. I wish that I had that ability' because you see the damage that it does to him and his family, you know, but historically we benefit. People benefit from those few individuals that are out there that do stand up to injustice and who will take the battle all the way to the end,\" said Greg Kinnear, who portrays Kearns in the film, adding:\n\n\"I mean, more and more of us are working for fewer and fewer people and Marc's right - these corporations have an obligation to not marginalise the individual and that's what happened to Kearns here. And the thing that makes him unique is not that he fought, but that he didn't stop fighting.\"\n\nIronically, the very same corporations that seemed to have endless funds to drag Kearns through the courts, are now the very same ones asking for taxpayer funded loans to bail them out of the current financial crisis.\n\nDirecting his first film, veteran producer Marc Abraham said that while he hadn't set out to comment on that (he bought the rights to the story long before the credit crunch), the parallels ware there to be drawn.\n\n\"I think Greg's word is a good one, it is ironic. It also points out that, you know, sometimes the principle is important and that fighting for the right thing is important and that ultimately there are repercussions of organisations that are not necessarily playing by the rules. And that's not what we set out to-- our job is to make entertainment and to create characters that people can relate to and find that their journey is worthwhile to enjoy on a Saturday afternoon. But sometimes there is a fusion of what's going on in the universe and what you do in art and to some extent that's happened now,\" he said.\n\n'Flash of Genius' opens across cinemas in the UK on March 20.\n\nCopyright Holder: REUTERS\n\nCopyright Notice: (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2011.
