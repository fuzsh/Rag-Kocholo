        "text": "Film director and screenwriter Marc Abraham radiated enthusiasm and excitement as he visited the Lowcountry on Saturday afternoon.\n\nIt's \"such a beautiful day,\" he said.\n\nThousands of other film enthusiasts shared his view as they flooded downtown Savannah for the final day of the 2015 Savannah Film Festival. As the evening wore on, attendees crowded the red carpet on Broughton Street before heading to the closing ceremony of the 18th annual festival, which started Oct. 24.\n\nAbraham, who directed and wrote \"I Saw the Light,\" a movie based on the life of country-western singer Hank Williams that was screened Saturday, was thrilled to show the film to festivalgoers and said he hoped Savannah viewers made an emotional connection to the film.\n\n\"We really want to provoke people,\" he said. \"I want people to be able to relate to the difficulty of these lives and to see in these (character's) lives some of the things that take place in their lives and now that even though it's painful, it's necessary and it can still be overcome.\"\n\nElizabeth Olsen, who played Audrey Sheppard Williams, Hank's wife, expressed pure joy in bringing to life the woman behind Hank Williams and said the film was very relatable to modern viewers.\n\n\"(The script) was so authentic and clever,\" Olsen said. \"It was just a fascinating story to me. I was just so blown away by how modern his story was. I remember my first meeting with Marc and him telling me (Hank Williams sold tickets to his own wedding to make money) and I remember thinking 'Are you serious? That's like Kardashian stuff. That's original reality TV. It seemed like such a relevant story.\"\n\nAlthough Olsen declined to hum a few bars, she said her favorite Hank Williams song is \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry.\" Olsen, the younger sister of twins Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, has appeared in films such as \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" and \"Godzilla.\"\n\nThe event, sponsored by the Savannah College of Art and Design, featured screenings of 118 films, conversation series with actors and directors and presentation of festival awards. SCAD announced festival award winners during an awards brunch held at Olde Pink House, where 15 awards were presented in the categories of narrative features, documentary features, professional shorts, student shorts, professional animation shorts, student animation shorts, student live action and shorts from Australia.\n\nThe event also included workshops, panels and lectures.\n\nHonored guests included Olivia Wilde, Meg Ryan, \"Atonement\" actress Saoirse Ronan and \"Game of Thrones\" actor Alfie Allen.\n\nSAVANNAH FILM FESTIVAL AWARD WINNERS\n\nNarrative and Documentary Features\n\n•Best Narrative Feature: \"Tumbledown\" - A young widow, Hannah, falls for a brash New York writer, Andrew, investigating the death of her husband, folk-music hero Hunter Miles.
