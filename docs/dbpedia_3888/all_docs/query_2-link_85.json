        "text": "Hank Williams, the tragic genius of country music, wrote some of the most memorable American popular songs before dying in 1953 in the back seat of his powder-blue Cadillac on the way to a concert in Canton, Ohio.\n\nThe author of dozens of hit country singles - including \"Honky Tonkin',\" \"Cold, Cold Heart\" and \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\" - was only 29.\n\nAlthough Williams lived a few years too long to be included in the \"27 Club\" - made up of music legends (including Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Kurt Cobain and Amy Winehouse) who died at that age - his life was filled with enough self-destructive behavior to qualify him for membership.\n\nWilliams' tumultuous life, in fact, led to numerous films, including \"Your Cheatin' Heart,\" the 1964 film starring George Hamilton.\n\nThe latest film in the Williams sweepstakes - the serviceable \"I Saw the Light,\" written and directed by Marc Abraham - has the great advantage of a splendid performance by Tom Hiddleston in the title role.\n\nThe British actor best known for playing the duplicitous Loki in Marvel's \"Thor\" movies might seem an unlikely pick for an Alabama-born singer with an unmistakable country twang, but he turns out to have been an inspired choice.\n\nNot only does Hiddleston, who was tutored by musician Rodney Crowell (who also is the film's executive music producer), do an expert job of singing many Williams songs in the film, but he also gives a convincing performance as the charismatic man who mined his troubled life for musical material.\n\nHiddleston's co-stars - including Elizabeth Olsen (\"Martha Marcy May Marlene\") as Williams' first wife, Audrey, and the protean Cherry Jones as his protective mother, Lillie - are also strong actors. Still, \"I Saw the Light\" is solid, not spectacular - a retelling of a sad story that never catches fire.\n\nBased on Colin Escott's thoroughly researched biography, \"I Saw the Light\" respects the facts of Williams' personal life - including the effects that his womanizing, alcoholism and abuse of pills had on his marriages - but seeing it all on screen is more disturbing than compelling.\n\nWhen we first meet a 21-year-old Williams and his bride at their December 1944 wedding at a service station in Andalusia, Alabama, their feelings for each other certainly seem strong and vibrant.\n\nWilliams and his band, the Drifting Cowboys, have an early-morning radio program, but trouble begins when Audrey, more ambitious than talented, develops a strong-willed determination to join her husband in the limelight.\n\nNot helping matters, either, are her mother-in-law's excessive hostility and her husband's view of flirtatiousness as part of his act, even when it leads to brawls.\n\nA strength of Hiddleston's performance is the way he casually emphasizes the come-hither quality in Williams' stage performances, a kind of pre-Elvis Southern sensuality that was not the norm in its time and place.\n\nAs Williams' substance abuse persists and his relationship with Audrey seesaws, the tedium of such trajectories is relieved by sequences charting the progress of the singer's career.\n\nWe learn about Williams' determination to become a regular on Nashville's Grand Ole Opry, the gold standard for country singers. We learn how, over the objections of his producer, he recorded \"Lovesick Blues,\" his first No. 1 hit. And we learn that, country though he was, Williams was popular enough to take a Hollywood meeting with MGM head Dore Schary and appear on Perry Como's TV show in New York.\n\nIt is during a trip to Manhattan that \"I Saw the Light\" sits Williams down with a newspaperman and has him deliver a kind of credo about his appeal.\n\n\"Everybody has a little darkness in 'em,\" the singer says. \"I'm talking about things like anger, misery, sorrow, shame. … I show it to 'em. And they don't have to take it home. They expect I can help their troubles.\"\n\nAnd so Williams did.\n\nHis own troubles were something else, though: Hiddleston aside, they overpower this film."
