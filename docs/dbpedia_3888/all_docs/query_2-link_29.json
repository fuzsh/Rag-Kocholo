        "text": "Photo (C) Eric Charbonneau/Invision\n\nElizabeth Olsen has been cast as Audrey Williams, the wife of Hank Williams, in upcoming biopic I Saw The Light.\n\nIt was revealed earlier this year that British actor Tom Hiddleston had been cast in the lead role as Hank, with the film set to be directed by Marc Abraham.\n\nDuring her life Audrey served as manager, duet-singer and touring band member with Hank. After his death she ran her own record label and production company, but quit music altogether in 1970 after having difficulty establishing a career as a solo musician. She died in 1975 at the age of 52.\n\nI Saw The Light is scheduled to begin filming next month, with a release date expected some time in 2015. Rodney Crowell is serving as the film’s executive music producer, and the production has already secured the rights to use many of Williams’ most well known songs, including “Your Cheatin’ Heart”, “Hey Good Lookin'” and “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry.”\n\nAlbum Reviews | Live Reviews | News | SBA Lists | The Playlist | Under The Skin | Without A Song\n\nBritish actor Tom Hiddleston has been cast as country music legend Hank Williams in a forthcoming biopic about the star.\n\nI Saw The Light will tell the story of Williams’ life and early death at the age of just 29 in 1953. The film is to be directed by Marc Abraham and is due to start shooting in Louisiana in October. Hiddleston will do his own singing in the film, and it is reported that the production has also secured the rights to Williams’ back catalogue, so a host of Williams’ hits are expected.\n\nIn 2011 Jack White and Bob Dylan were among the stars to contribute to collection of recordings of songs by Hank Williams. The Lost Notebooks of Hank Williams bought together a host of never-before-heard songs from the songwriter. The 12 songs on the album were based upon notes made by Williams which were found after his death in a leather briefcase which belonged to him.\n\nAlbum Reviews | Live Reviews | News | SBA Lists | The Playlist | Under The Skin | Without A Song"
