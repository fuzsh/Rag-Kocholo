        "text": "Hank Williams “I Saw The Light” Biopic Premiers in Nashville – Complete Report\n\nOn Saturday evening (10-17), the highly-anticipated, yet much-maligned movie covering the life of Hank Williams called ‘I Saw The Light’ made its big star-studded Nashville debut at the Belcourt Theater just south of the city’s Music Row district. After the red carpet ceremony and screening of the film at the Belcourt, festivities moved to Acme Feed & Seed on lower Broadway for an afterparty.\n\n“Shockingly Bad” Hank Williams Biopic “I Saw The Light” Slammed by Critics Upon Debut\n\nThe highly-anticipated Hank Williams biopic ‘I Saw The Light’ starring Tom Hiddleston made its debut at the Toronto International Film Festival Friday, September 11th. And the only way to describe the degree disappointment, displeasure, and at times vitriol towards this movie from the select few who were allowed into the screening can only spell one thing: ‘I Saw The Light’ is a gargantuan letdown.\n\nFirst Images of Hiddleston as Hank Williams from “I Saw The Light”\n\nThe Hank Williams biopic I Saw The Light is currently shooting in Shreveport, Louisiana, and we’re beginning to get the first glimpses of the set and some of the actors in their costumes, while details of some of the specific cast members continue to emerge. Additionally a camera crew from KTBS Channel 3 in Shreveport was allowed on the I Saw The Light set and spoke briefly with Tom Hiddleston.\n\nActor Austin Haley Offers “I Saw The Light” Update – Criticizes Hank3\n\nThe I Saw The Light biopic on the life of Hank Williams is currently being shot in and around Shreveport, Louisiana. One of the actors, Austin Haley, who is playing “Dwayne” in the film has offered his initial take on how the movie is going, and how the film’s director Marc Abraham, and lead Tom Hiddleston (playing Hank) are faring with the task.\n\nAudrey Williams Cast in Hank Williams Biopic\n\nThe upcoming biopic on Hank Williams entitled I Saw The Light has its leading lady. The part of Audrey Williams—Hank’s first wife and one of the foremost influences on his music—will be played by Elizabeth Olsen, little sister of famous twins Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, and recent star of films such as Captain America:The Winter Soldier and Godzilla. She will play Audrey across from Tom Hiddleston.\n\nTom Hiddleston Gives First Impression of Hank Williams Role\n\now we have received our first taste of Tom Hiddleston as Hank Williams, and some are applauding, and some have started the furor over the casting anew. Though Hiddleston seemed to do a fine job singing, some Hank Williams fans are not feeling the similarities in the style. Hiddleston made a surprise appearance at the Wheatland Music Festival in Michigan on Saturday.\n\nTom Hiddleston Talks Playing Hank Williams in Upcoming Biopic\n\nActor Tom Hiddleston was announced on June 12th as the leading role in an upcoming biopic about the life of Hank Williams called I Saw The Light. Tom Hiddleston recently spoke to The Daily Mail about the film, reassuring concerned country music fans about the reverence with which he will approach the role. “I’m going to give it everything I’ve got.”"
