        "text": "DETROIT, in 1963, still had a certain optimism. Its Tigers had two rookie pitchers, Denny McLain and Mickey Lolich, who would soon help deliver a championship season, the team’s first since World War II. Population was near a peak, almost double today’s. And Robert Kearns, a 36-year-old engineer, actually believed that a little guy with a big idea could play ball with the automotive giants.\n\nMr. Kearns’s brilliant idea was the intermittent windshield wiper. It would swipe water away in a light rain, pause, then swipe again.\n\nThat fall Mr. Kearns pulled up outside an engineering complex at Ford’s headquarters in Dearborn to demonstrate his invention, which he had installed in the family Galaxie.\n\nBut Ford proceeded to make the wipers without him. Mr. Kearns sued. And there began a personal, business and legal odyssey that has since warmed the hearts of spurned inventors, infuriated corporate lawyers and sent Marc Abraham, an affable film producer with a hankering to direct, on a mission to rival Mr. Kearns’s relentless quest for redress.\n\nThe resulting film, “Flash of Genius,” with Greg Kinnear in the lead role, is scheduled to screen Sunday at the Toronto International Film Festival, following recent showings at the Traverse City Film Festival in upstate Michigan. Universal Pictures plans to open it nationwide on Oct. 3. Only weeks ago the studio shifted from an Oct. 17 opening that had put it opposite “W.,” the George W. Bush biographical picture from Oliver Stone and Lionsgate.\n\nMr. Stone promises a seriocomic exploration of a well-born Everyman who grew up to become president. Mr. Abraham has learned that Everyman is a complicated beast, particularly when you push him too far. “When a person goes up against superior odds, he will definitely pay a price,” Mr. Abraham said. Mr. Kearns died in 2005, having won his legal battle against both Ford and Chrysler, which also used the wipers, but losing his balance and much that was dear to him along the way.\n\n“Look at Martin Luther King, Lawrence of Arabia and Gandhi,” Mr. Abraham said.\n\nMr. Kearns was no Gandhi, or even an Erin Brockovich. He fought for personal vindication, not his fellow man. A loving wife left him, exhausted by his obsession. Six children learned to cope with a father who at one point suffered a mental breakdown over his unfair treatment by the automakers.\n\nBut Mr. Abraham, by his own account, has been hooked for nine years on the notion of making a film  his first as a director  about Mr. Kearns, precisely because he was a thorny sort of hero. Frank Capra “wasn’t that easy either,” Mr. Abraham said, pointing to the dark edges around fondly remembered “little guy” dramas like “It’s a Wonderful Life” and “Meet John Doe.”\n\nMuch of the Kearns family eventually rallied around its patriarch, to become an ad hoc staff in the legal battle in which Mr. Kearns, who represented himself, ultimately enforced his patents and won more than $30 million from Ford and Chrysler. But he had repeatedly turned down settlements that might have paid him more, while pressing, largely in vain, for acknowledgment that he had been cheated by willful rather than inadvertent infringement.\n\nMr. Kearns was apparently driven by a deep-seated conviction that he was being deprived not just of money but of his very identity as an inventor. As that belief ripened into rage, he lost touch with his surroundings; at one point he hitchhiked to Washington and continued by bus to points south, convinced that Richard M. Nixon had commissioned him to build an electric car in Australia.\n\nIn carving a film from all of this, Philip Railsback (“The Stars Fell on Henrietta”) worked from a 1993 New Yorker article by John Seabrook, “The Flash of Genius,” and from interviews with Mr. Kearns and his kin.\n\nMr. Railsback, who is credited as the script’s writer, died a few months after Mr. Kearns. Scott Frank (“The Interpreter”) revised the script, helping especially, Mr. Abraham said, to develop the story of Mr. Kearns’s relationship with his wife, Phyllis, who is played in the film by Lauren Graham (“Gilmore Girls”).\n\n“The real Bob Kearns was 10 times as paranoid, 10 times as difficult as Greg played him,” explained Michael Lieber, a producer of the film. At first, Mr. Lieber said, he thought he was grappling with a simple David-and-Goliath story. After months on the telephone confronting Mr. Kearns’s suspicions about Hollywood’s intentions during a protracted negotiation over life rights, he knew better.\n\nMr. Abraham for his part is as amiable as Mr. Kearns, by many reports, was not. A bit weathered at age 59, he still speaks with an accent rooted in his native Louisville, Ky. Hollywood’s version of a good old boy, he has been known to mix discussion about movie casting with talk about fishing for big-mouth bass. Over the years he has piled up producing credits on films as varied as “Children of Men,” “Dawn of the Dead,” “Slither” and “Thirteen Days.”\n\nHaving started his show business career as a writer, with credits on the television series “21 Jump Street” and “Moonlighting,” Mr. Abraham fiddled with the “Flash of Genius” script for years  so much so that friends began to call it “that windshield wiper thing,” conveying their concern that he had been infected by Mr. Kearns’s not altogether healthy passion.\n\nYet the screenplay, as it evolved, achieved cult status in Hollywood. At one point, Mr. Abraham recalled, Bryan Lourd, a partner in the Creative Artists Agency, told him, “You’d better Super Glue yourself to that script.” It had gotten good enough, Mr. Lourd warned, that an experienced director would try to pry it away.\n\nFinally Mr. Abraham pressed Marc Shmuger, a friend who had become chairman of Universal, either to make the film or to distribute it with backing from an outside financier. When Mr. Shmuger chose the second course, Roger Birnbaum and Gary Barber of Spyglass Entertainment Holdings agreed to provide backing and became producers of the film, on a budget of about $16 million.\n\n“We all connected to the underdog story,” Mr. Shmuger said of Universal’s interest in the movie, one of four real-life dramas on the company’s schedule in the latter part of this year. (The others are “Frost/Nixon,” directed by Ron Howard, about encounters between a journalist and a president; “Changeling,” directed by Clint Eastwood, about a child’s disappearance from Los Angeles in the 1920s; and “The Express,” directed by Gary Fleder, about the Ernie Davis, the first black football player to win the Heisman Trophy.)\n\nMr. Kinnear said the “Flash” script, then called “The Windshield Wiper Man,” sat unread on his desk for weeks in 2006. “I thought it was the last superhero they could come up with, and it wouldn’t be for me,” he recalled, referring to a title that seemed to promise an action comedy of some sort. “It just seemed the most ludicrous thing.” But he discovered what he now calls “an incredible connection” to, if not quite an understanding of, the screenplay’s protagonist.\n\n“I never felt as if I had a complete handle on him,” Mr. Kinnear said in a telephone interview. “There’s a bit of a brittleness to him. Then, of course, there’s his tenacity, and all the stuff that made him a great character.”"
