        "text": "Hank Williams’ dark life overshadows ‘I Saw the Light’\n\nIf you’ve always thought, as I have, that Tom Hiddleston was such a good actor he could salvage any movie, well, welcome to ‘’I Saw the Light.’’\n\nWriter and director Marc Abraham’s film tells the story of Hank Williams, the greatest country music artist ever (one man’s opinion, mind you, but the correct one).\n\nIf there’s ever been a sadder song than ‘’I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry,’’ I’m not sure I’d want to hear it. Talented and troubled in near-equal measure, Williams died at 29, leaving behind a tangled life and a legacy so great that this most country-and-western of artists was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987.\n\nHis life is a tragedy made for movies, and several have been made. None, including this one, has matched the genius of Williams’ songs.\n\nIn theory there’s no shame in that; not much could match his catalog (and I say this as someone who doesn’t care for country music, but loves Williams).\n\nIn actual practice, this movie is a mess.\n\nThat’s no fault of Hiddleston. There was some controversy when Hiddleston, who is British, was cast as the countrified Williams, an Alabama native who sounded every bit of it.\n\nUm, it’s called acting.\n\nWhen Hiddleston plays Loki in the ‘’Avengers’’ movies no one complains that he’s not from Asgard (no one outside of ComiCon at least).\n\nHiddleston also plays and sings all the songs. That’s a riskier move; Williams’ distinctive whine and yodel would be difficult to replicate. Wisely, Hiddleston doesn’t try to mimic Williams. He sings the song as his version of Hank would. It’s interesting for anyone familiar with the originals. One hates to think, however, that this is the only introduction some will get to Williams’ versions.\n\nElizabeth Olsen is also in there plugging away, doing her best as Audrey, Hank’s on-again, off-again wife. She wants to sing with Hank, be treated as an artistic equal, at least in the movie version, but it’s clear there’s only one musical genius in the family.\n\nCherry Jones plays Hank’s domineering mother, openly hostile to Audrey, seemingly blind to Hank’s faults but well aware of his talent.\n\nThe problem is the movie itself ‘’ the script, the editing, the construction, all of which combine to make the whole thing feel flat, lifeless and confusing.\n\nWait, Hank’s quitting his radio show? Hold on, Audrey’s mad because the band thinks she can’t sing (and Hank quietly agrees). Whoa, whoa, whoa ‘’ is Audrey, from a hospital bed, intimating that Hank gave her a sexually transmitted disease courtesy of his cheating, and that she had an abortion? That’ll have to wait, because she’s booted him and Hank’s now rooming with Ray Price (Von Cleve Lewis).\n\nWhere’s Ray? Oh, he moved out. Hank’s got a couple of shows at the end of the year and the end. (Insert into every scene: Hank’s drinking again.)\n\nThe effect is like playing a record and dropping the needle down in random places every few seconds. What you hear might be interesting enough, but it kills the momentum and leaves you confused. Williams did a lot of living in his 29 years, and Abraham is bound and determined to scratch the surface of most of it. But not much else.\n\nThe biggest gap in the story is how Williams creates. We see him in the studio occasionally, and performing at the Grand Ole Opry, his life’s dream. A couple of times he scribbles notes, presumably lyrics, onto a piece of paper.\n\nBut that’s it as far as creative spark and inspiration go. Williams’ songs were fueled by his pain (some of it physical; he was born with spina bifida occulta and suffered back pain all his life), his shortcomings, his ambition, his sins. You can hear it in every song.\n\nBut you won’t find it here. Abraham shows us the struggles, all right, but not where they lead, which would have been a much more satisfying journey.\n\n★★½☆\n\n‘I Saw the Light’\n\nNow playing: Maya 16, Fresno\n\nMPAA rating: R, for some language and brief sexuality/nudity\n\nFilm facts: Stars Tom Hiddleston, Elizabeth Olsen and Cherry Jones. Directed by Marc Abraham. 123 minutes."
