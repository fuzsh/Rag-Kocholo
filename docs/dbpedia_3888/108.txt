Flash Of Genius is one of those films that's most remarkable for all the

things it doesn't

do. There's a big courtroom scene, but no gavel-pounding, witness-twisting, or

grandstanding lawyers. The real-life figure at the center of the lawsuit,

inventor Robert Kearns, loses his family because he insists on doing the right

thing year after year after agonizing year, and yet there's no shrieky "You're

tearing this family apart!" confrontation. First-time director Marc Abraham chooses to give Kearns' story a serious,

thinking-viewer gloss, creating a film that's unlikely to provoke cheering or

nail-biting. It lets audiences think they might actually be watching history as

it happened.

Greg Kinnear carries the film with his stellar,

controlled, slightly abrasive performance as Kearns, a Detroit

electrical-engineering professor with a wife (Lauren Graham), six reasonably

well-behaved but chaotic kids, and an idea. As of the film's opening '60s

setting, car windshield wipers only have one speed, so they drag and scrape

during light rain. Through trial, error, and ingenuity, Kearns invents an

adjustable-speed wiper and takes it to the major car companies, with the idea

of manufacturing it himself. The reps at Ford, who've been trying and failing

to develop something similar, seem bowled overâ€”until they get their hands

on a working copy to "test." Then they cut him off cold. A year and a half

later, new Fords start hitting the line with Kearns' design integrated, and he

starts a David-and-Goliath legal battle that everyone, including his lawyers,

says he can't win.
