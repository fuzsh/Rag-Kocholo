        "text": "Spouse Shedder\n\nPADMA Lakshmi was always way too hot for Salman Rushdie, besides being 23 years his junior. Now that she's hosting her own TV show, Bravo's \"Top Chef,\" the Indian incubus may have realized the obvious. Yesterday, nobody was denying a story in the New York Observer alleging that the couple's friend, fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, was overheard recently exclaiming, \"I can't believe she's leaving him.\" The couple, who met at the Talk magazine launch party on Liberty Island in 1999, married five years later.\n\nsource\n\nleyla m. said:\n\nshe is pretty but not that pretty... but yes, its time to leave him maybe.. i think they must have different interests..\n\nThat's why it's my opinion, no? I think she's stunning. And who knows, this could all be rumours. Don't they have a kid together?\n\nLOL, I googled them to read more about the split, and I got this from NY Mag\n\nDon’t make him get out his baseball bat!\n\nOn February 8, Guy Trebay wrote about Salman Rushdie’s wife, Padma Lakshmi, in the Times. In the “Hindu pantheon,” he observed, “Lakshmi is the domestic deity representing wealth and the embodiment of beauty, grace, and charm . . . In the current fashion pantheon, Ms. Lakshmi similarly stands for a love of money and commodity. A burgeoning brand married to a global brand, she has no problem making public an inventory of brands she chooses to wear.” Understandably, her husband was not amused. Witnesses say Rushdie walked up to Trebay at a National Arts Club event three days later and said, “If you ever write mean things about my wife again, I’ll come after you with a baseball bat.” Shaken, Trebay, who was on his way out, left. Of course, many found it ironic that Rushdie was threatening a writer with bodily harm for something he’d published. He didn’t return messages, and Trebay refused to comment. But a fellow attendee would: “She’s an ambitious person with a lot of hustle. I would think by celebrity standards she’s fair game. Have you seen her Website?”\n\n—Jacob Bernstein\n\nNow I keep imagining Salamn Rushdie coming at me with a baseball bat"
