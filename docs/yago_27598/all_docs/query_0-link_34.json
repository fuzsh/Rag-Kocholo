        "text": "Sir Salman Rushdie needed consoling every year he did not win the Nobel Prize for literature, and their marriage was marred by jealousy and insecurity, according to an explosive autobiography by his former wife Padma Lakshmi.\n\nMiss Lakshmi accused Sir Salman of describing her as “a bad investment” after she refused his sexual advances, and painted him as a cold and heartless husband.\n\nThe Indian-American model and judge on US television show Top Chef has lifted the lid on her three-year marriage to Mr Rushdie, author of The Satanic Verses. And in the book, published in the US on Tuesday, the 45-year-old details a series of fiery relationships, including that with Sir Salman.\n\nThe pair met in 1999 at a party in New York, when Miss Lakshmi was 28 and single, and Sir Salman was 51 and married to his third wife.\n\nMiss Lakshmi and Sir Salman married in 2004, dividing their time between London – where his two sons lived – and New York. She told how he used to make her breakfast in bed every morning, and at first their marriage was blissful.\n\nBut slowly it soured with Sir Salman proving as \"lethally eloquent\" in wars of words as in print. The author, who was born in Bombay but brought up in the UK, was knighted by the Queen in 2007 for services to literature, having won the Booker Prize in 1983 for Midnight’s Children.\n\nShe told People magazine this week, in an interview to promote her book: \"I just wanted my own identity. I was making the transition out of one stage of my life and into another. But in order to do that, it required that I wasn't everywhere that he needed me to be.\"\n\nMiss Lakshmi developed endometriosis, a painful condition affecting the lining of the womb, she writes that Sir Salman was unsympathetic. When she refused sex due to the pain, he would reply: “How convenient.”\n\n\"It's not that I didn't want to be there for him, but something was very deeply wrong,\" she said. \"And I didn't understand it. And that caused a whole lot of misunderstanding.\"\n\nAfter one five-hour surgery for her condition, Miss Lakshmi returned with stitches in four major organs and stents in both kidneys. But Sir Salman, instead of caring for her, left the next day for a work trip.\n\n\"The show must go on, after all,\" he said on this way out the door, according to Miss Lakshmi.\n\nAs soon as she was able to leave the house she went to a divorce lawyer.\n\nThe presenter and writer went on to become involved with Ted Forstmann, the billionaire chief executive of sports and artist management company IMG, who died in 2011 aged 71.\n\nShe has a six-year-old daughter, Krishna, with Adam Dell, the venture capitalist.\n\nSir Salman has not responded to his ex-wife’s onslaught. But shortly after his marriage to Miss Lakshmi ended, he said he thought marriage was an unnecessary complication in life -and women only want it for the dress.\n\n\"It's strange, given that I've been married four times, but I actually don't think marriage is necessary,\" he said. \"Girls like it, especially if they've never been married before – it's the dress. Girls want a wedding, they don't want a marriage. If only you could have weddings without marriages.\"\n\nSir Salman also disclosed that he and Miss Lakshmi had marriage counselling, but without success.\n\nHis romantic life after Miss Lakshmi has been checkered.\n\nA new girlfriend Pia Glenn gave an interview after they split up to The New York Post saying he was \"cowardly, dysfunctional, and immature\", and that he kept talking about Miss Lakshmi.\n\nSir Salman then poured fuel on the fire, ringing the newspaper to label Miss Glenn \"an unstable person who carries around a large, radioactive bucket of stress wherever she goes.\"\n\nSir Salman now lives in New York."
