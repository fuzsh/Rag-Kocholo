        "text": "Salman Rushdie’s “Joseph Anton” is a memoir of the roughly 10 years he spent in hiding, under police protection, after the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for his death in 1989 because his novel “The Satanic Verses” was deemed offensive to Islam. The memoir’s title, cobbled together from the first names of Joseph Conrad and Anton Chekhov, is the alias he used while under the fatwa. In the book, which is written in the third person, Anton emerges as a character Mr. Rushdie regards both fondly and critically.\n\nThe book carefully documents his political struggles during this period and his efforts to get the fatwa lifted, but also describes his personal life in great detail, including the breakup of three marriages: to Marianne Wiggins, Elizabeth West and Padma Lakshmi. (A first marriage, to Clarissa Luard, ended in 1987.)\n\nThe fatwa was officially lifted in 1998, and since settling in New York in early 2000, Mr. Rushdie has moved around freely. He has become a man about town and something of a party animal, in fact.\n\nOf the recent news that a religious foundation had renewed the fatwa, he wrote by e-mail: “I’m not inclined to magnify this ugly bit of headline grabbing by paying it much attention.” Last month, before embarking on a three-month publicity tour promoting both the new book and the coming film version of his 1981 novel, “Midnight’s Children,” he discussed “Joseph Anton” over lunch at a Midtown restaurant. What follows is an abridged version of that conversation.\n\nQ. This all happened a long time ago. What made you decide to write about it now, so many years later?\n\nA. It was largely a matter of instinct. For a long time I did not want to write this book. I felt that it would be upsetting to have to emotionally re-enter that time and immerse myself in it. But I knew always that I would have to. You know how it is — if you have the disease of being a writer there’s a little bit of you, even in the worst moments of your life — there’s a little bit of you sitting on your shoulder and saying, “Good story!” That’s why I started keeping a journal through this time. I just thought that the weight of events, the speed of events, the complexity of what was happening was so great that even with the best memory in the world there was no way to remember it in detail.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
