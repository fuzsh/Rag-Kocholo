        "meta_description": "The idea of marriage makes my hands sweat, not in a good way. I’m trying to figure it out though, really I am. Therapy has helped me realize that it’s one part rebellion to the South Asian obsession with weddings, one part my parent’s divorce ... and the rest is still murky. I mean, I’ve always been a bit of a cynic: the whole concept of “forever” that marriage is predicated",

        "text": "The inevitable news of Padma Lakshmi and Salman Rushdie’s divorce hit the news this week, with an embarrassing statement from Rushdie’s publicist: “Salman Rushdie has agreed to divorce his wife, Padma Lakshmi, because of her desire to end their marriage.” But it was Rushdie’s fourth time around, so I’m sure he’s learned to take it in stride by now. Besides, it comes on the heels of Rushdie’s knighthood -- I guess you win some and you lose some.\n\nPersonally, I’m pretty into Padma Lakshmi – as I’m a big fan of Top Chef, even though she’s a bit of a weirdo. Okay, I just think she's hot. Do you really think I would buy a cookbook called Easy Exotic: Low-Fat Recipes From Around the World? I’ve also heard the rumors that she’s a pothead, which always makes me partial to celebrities.\n\nAs ridiculous as Padma and Salman's marriage was, as South Asians who got divorced, they are in the minority. A recent Little India article said:\n\nThis Indian universe of matrimonial bliss is increasingly running up against the inescapable American reality, in which almost half of all marriages end in divorce. By contrast, Indian American marriages are far more stable. According to 2000 census data, just over 3 percent of Indians were divorced or separated, against about 12 percent nationwide. Nonetheless, the divorce rate is on the rise both in India and in the South Asian community in North America. Between 10 to 15 percent of all Indian American marriages culminate in divorce or separation.\n\nAn article in India Currents discusses the psychological impact that divorce has on Indian Americans, especially children. As a child of divorce, I know first-hand how isolating this issue is in the community.\n\nBut the dark side of marriage just doesn't seem to rain on the out-of-control wedding parade. I’ve noticed this explosion of South Asian bridal magazines in the past couple of years, which started with Bibi Magazine in 2000. Or perhaps every South Asian American magazine I see just overdoes it when it comes to the marriage issue. Take Nirali, for instance. An on-line magazine for South Asians, I’ve always been pretty impressed by Nirali’s web-savvy ways and articles. I think their blog is great. But then my best friend emailed me a link to their super-dooper wedding issue, and I was a little shocked at the excess. I mean, I guess it’s a great resource for desi girls who just can’t find the right advice in Modern Bride but when – as a community – are we going to get beyond our obsession with this ritual? Maybe never.\n\nI think what really bugs me is the opulence of it -- all silk and gold. What about those of us on a smaller budget? Those who want our guests to invest in non-profit giving instead of buying us another salad bowl? Those of us who want a Guns&Roses cover band and a keg of PBR at our wedding shindig? What about people who don't want to get married? Or people who are not legally allowed?\n\nOkay, I did really like this story about a documentary-style wedding videographer. What a great idea!\n\nI’m sure you’ve all heard of Rebecca Mead’s book One Perfect Day: The Selling of the American Wedding:\n\nAccording to Mead, the average commercial wedding costs about $28,000, involves 43 professionals, and has 165 guests in attendance. The average bride's dress costs $1,025. Last year American brides and grooms registered for over $9 billion worth of gifts, and 96 percent of engaged couples plan to register.\n\nAnyway, I’ve been to enough Indian weddings to know that 165 guests is on the low, low side. Maybe what needs to happen is an investigation of the South Asian obsession with marriage. Perhaps when I get over my own issues with the concept, I’ll look into that."
