        "text": "SIR Salman Rushdie and his fourth wife, Padma Lakshmi, are getting divorced. Confirming speculation that his wife, a former model turned TV presenter, wanted to end their three-year marriage, Sir Salman's agent claimed that the break-up had come at her instigation.\n\nThe announcement came just weeks after the news that the author of The Satanic Verses was to be knighted, an honour that provoked fury in the Muslim world.\n\nRumours that the marriage between Sir Salman, 60, and the Indian-born Ms Lakshmi, 36, was in trouble have been circulating for months.\n\nA statement from the author's agent in New York said: \"Salman Rushdie has agreed to divorce his wife Padma Lakshmi because of her desire to end their marriage. He asks that the media respect his privacy at this difficult time.\"\n\nFriends of Sir Salman have been quoted as saying that he was \"still very much in love\" with her, but that his feelings were no longer reciprocated.\n\nThe couple met at a New York magazine launch party in 1999 while the British author was still married to his third wife. They married five years later.\n\nSceptics made much of the age gap and potential intellectual differences, while Sir Salman used to bristle at \"beauty and the beast\" references in the press.\n\nTELEGRAPH"
