        "text": "Salman Rushdie with bride Padma Lakshmi after the ceremony\n\nThe Satanic Verses author Salman Rushdie wed his fiancee, Indian actress Padma Lakshmi, in a ceremony in Manhattan in the US on Saturday.\n\nRushdie, 56, married the former model at a Hindu ceremony witnessed by some of his closest friends.\n\nThe author went into hiding in the 1980s after Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran issued a fatwa for \"insulting Islam\" in The Satanic Verses.\n\nThe marriage is Rushdie's fourth and Lakshmi's first.\n\nThe author's agent confirmed to BBC News Online the marriage had taken place in Manhattan, but declined to give any further details.\n\nTraditional customs\n\nThe pair had announced their engagement in February.\n\nRushdie wore a long black sherwani, a kind of frock coat, while Lakshmi wore a purple bridal outfit, according to reports.\n\nRushdie slipped a shoe onto his wife's foot, a traditional custom. He also arrived at the ceremony in the company of a child - his son Milan - a ritual which denoted fertility, the Daily Telegraph newspaper reported.\n\nThe paper said guests included media couple Harold Evans and Tina Brown - whose party the pair met at - as well as David Bowie's wife Iman, columnist Christopher Hitchens and writer Kathy Lette."
