        "text": "Padma Lakshmi hosted Bravo's popular cooking competition series, Top Chef, from 2006 until 2023.\n\nHowever, her career goes beyond the Top Chef kitchen, causing many fans to wonder who the star actually is.\n\nWho is Padma Lakshmi?\n\nPadma Lakshmi is an author, activist, model, and television host who was born on September 1, 1970, in Chennai, India.\n\nHer career began in the late 1990s after making several guest appearances on shows like Star Trek: Enterprise, The Ten Commandments, 30 Rock, and Wasteland.\n\nShe has written six books, including Easy Exotic, Tomatoes for Neela, and the New York Times best-seller Love, Loss, and What We Ate.\n\nDoes Padma still host Top Chef?\n\nStarting in 2006, Padma Lakshmi hosted the Bravo cooking show, Top Chef.\n\nOn June 2, 2023, Padma took to Instagram to make a major announcement.\n\nShe wrote: \"Having completed a glorious 20th season as host and executive producer, I am extremely proud to have been part of building such a successful; show and of the impact it has had in the worlds of television and food.\"\n\nShe went on to express her love for the cast and crew, calling them \"family\" as she went on to say that she will no longer be hosting Top Chef.\n\nLakshmi attributed her decision to the desire to \"make space\" for Taste the Nation, authorship, and \"other creative pursuits.\"\n\nTop Chef winner Kristen Kish took over as host of Top Chef following Padma's exit.\n\nIs Padma Lakshmi married?\n\nFrom 2004 to 2007, Lakshmi was famously married to 75-year-old novelist Salman Rushdie.\n\nThe two previously met while he was married to Elizabeth West, his third wife, but by 2000 they were living together.\n\n\"For me, it was wonderful because I finally had somebody who understood me because he too was Indian and he was also living in the West and he was very nimble in navigating those two worlds,\" she told PEOPLE in 2016.\n\nHowever, their fairytale romance ended shortly after it began, partly because she was unable to have sex due to endometriosis.\n\n\"Endometriosis was definitely a major reason that my marriage failed and I don’t think either of us understood it at the time,\" she explained to PEOPLE.\n\n\"I think that’s also because I hid it to a certain degree, not intentionally but you know, it’s weird to talk about your period all the time. It’s like the least sexy thing in the world to do.”\n\n“I think that Salman took it personally and I think that he felt rejected,” she added, “and I can understand that.”\n\nFollowing their divorce, Lakshmi began dating Adam Dell, who is the father of her daughter, Krishna Thea, but the two eventually split in 2021.\n\nLakshmi dated poet Terrance Hayes in 2021, but they went their separate ways in November of that year.\n\nOn April 27, 2024, they were seen walking hand-in-hand in New York City, but they haven't confirmed if they're back together.\n\nWhat is Padma Lakshmi's net worth?\n\nDue to Lakshmi's successful career, she has been able to amass an extensive net worth.\n\nAs of August 2022, her worth is $40 million with a salary of $50,000 per Top Chef episode, according to Celebrity Net Worth."
