According to his ex-wife, Padma Lakshmi, the author required consolation every year that he did not win the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nMs Lakshmi, 45, a former model, cookery writer and the host of the American reality television show Top Chef, makes the claim in a memoir which ostensibly focuses on food, filtered through the lens of her own life experiences.\n\nHowever, it was her marriage in 2004 to the author who was then emerging from years living under the threat of a fatwa imposed by the Ayatollah Khomeini,"
