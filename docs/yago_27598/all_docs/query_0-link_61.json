        "text": "Sir Salman Rushdie and his wife Padma Lakshmi are to divorce after less than three years of marriage, it was announced today.\n\nA spokesman for the novelist, who was knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours, said that Lakshmi had requested the split.\n\n\"Salman Rushdie has agreed to divorce his wife Padma Lakshmi because of her desire to end their marriage.\"\n\nLakshmi, an Indian-born actress and model, was Sir Salman's fourth wife. They met in 1999 while he was still married to his third wife Elizabeth West, and married five years later.\n\nRumours that the marriage was in trouble have been circulating for weeks. At 36, she is 24 years his junior.\n\nSir Salman's recent knighthood renewed controversy over his 1989 novel the Satanic Verses, which many Muslims believe is blasphemous.\n\nA prominent Iranian cleric appeared on state radio to declare that the fatwa issued against him by the Ayatollah Khomeini was \"still alive\", raising new fears for his safety."
