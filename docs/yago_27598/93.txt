Lakshmi is Rushdie's fourth wife

Satanic Verses author Salman Rushdie and his Indian actress wife, Padma Lakshmi are divorcing at her request, Mr Rushdie's spokeswoman says.

The news comes two weeks after the author received a knighthood, sparking protests by Muslims in many parts of the world.

Sir Salman and Lakshmi married in a Hindu ceremony in New York in 2004.

The Satanic Verses, published in 1988, was condemned in the Islamic world because of its perceived blasphemy.

Respect plea

"Salman Rushdie has agreed to divorce his wife, Padma Lakshmi, because of her desire to end their marriage," Mr Rushdie's spokeswoman Jin Auh said.

"He asks that the media respect his privacy at this difficult time."

Lakshmi is Rushdie's fourth wife. It is her first marriage.

The author went into hiding in the 1980s after Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran issued a fatwa for "insulting Islam" in The Satanic Verses.
