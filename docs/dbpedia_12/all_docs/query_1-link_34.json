        "text": "Hint: In the famous Battle of Diu in 1509, Portuguese fought against the joint fleet of Sultan of Gujarat, and armies of Egypt and turkey. However, the alliance proved to be a failure and resulted in the victory of Portuguese. They captured the major ports and routes of Arabian sea.\n\nComplete answer: The Battle of Diu of 1509 was a naval battle fought in the Arabian sea, on the port of Diu. It started with the voyage of Vasco da Gama in 1498 on the shores of Malabar. Since then the Portuguese were trying to control the spice trade which was in the hands of Arab and Muslims merchants of Malabar. Portuguese tried to maintain ties with Zamorin, the Samoothiri ruler of Calicut, but nothing happened. Then they realized they have to strengthen their navel in order to gain control. Portuguese then appointed Dom Francisco de Almeida as the viceroy of India to curb Muslims merchants to trade in India. All these events led the Sultan of Gujarat, Mehmud Shah to join hands with Egypt and Turkey against Portuguese.\n\nAhmad Shah(1411 to 1442), Muzaffar Shah II(1511 to 1526) and Bahadur Shah born Bahadur khan(1526-1535) were the Sultan of Gujarat of the Muzaffarid Dynasty, belonging to different time periods. They ruled over the Gujarat Dynasty over different periods.\n\nThus the correct answer is option-B.\n\nNote: Don't get confused with Bahadur Shah Zafar or Bahadur Shah II who was the Mughal Emperor. Mehmud Shah or Mehmud Begada ruled over Ahmedabad from 1458 to 1511."
