Shortly afterwards, the Mamluk Sultan Baybars in Cairo installed an Abbasid Caliph in Cairo, legitimating the new Mamluk rule over Egypt and Syria. The line of Abbasid Caliphs continued at Cairo under Mamluk rule (659-923/1261-1517).\n\n659/1261 al-Mustansir\n\n660/1261 al-Hakim I\n\n701/1302 al-Mustakfi I\n\n740/1340 al-Wathiq I\n\n741/1341 al-Hakim I\n\n753/1352 al-Mutadid I\n\n763/1362 al-Mutawakkil I first time\n\n779/1377 al-Mutasim first time\n\n779/1377 al-Mutawakkil I second time\n\n785/1383 al-Wathiq II\n\n788/1386 al-Mutasim second time\n\n791/1389 al-Mutawakkil I third time\n\n808/1406 al-Mustain\n\n816/1414 al-Mutadid II\n\n845/1441 al-Mustakfi II\n\n855/1451 al-Qaim\n\n859/1455 al-Mustanjid\n\n884/1479 al-Mutawakkil II\n\n903/1497 al-Mustamsik first time\n\n914/1508 al-Mutawakkil III first time\n\n922/1516 al-Mustamsik second time\n\n923/1517 al-Mutawakkil III second time\n\nThe Tulunids\n\n254/868 Ahmad bin Tulun\n\n270/884 Khumarawayh\n\n282/896 Jaysh\n\n283/896 Harun\n\n292/905 Shauban\n\nThe Tulunids were the first separate dynasty to rule over Egypt, which they controlled together with Syria. The reign of the first in the dynasty, Ibn Tulun, marks a high point in Egyptian history. Of Turkish origin, he rose to power from his position as deputy governor. The dynasty ruled from Fustat, on the south side of the later city of Cairo.\n\nIn 905 Tulunid independence was ended with the conquest by the general Muhammad bin Sulayman fighting for the Abbasid Caliph.\n\nThe Ikhshidids\n\n323/935 Muhammad bin Tughj al-Ikhshid\n\n344/946 Unujur\n\n349/961 Ali\n\n355/966 Kafur, originally regent for Ali\n\n357-8/968-9 Ahmad\n\nThe first Ikhshidid ruler, Muhammad bin Tughj, was of Turkish military origins, and rose to power from his position as governor of Egypt in 323/935, for which the Abbasid Caliph ar-Radi gave him the title Ikhshid (an Iranian title signifying 'prince' or 'ruler'). After his death the effective ruler of Egypt was the Nubian slave Kafur.\n\nIn 969 Ikhshidid rule was extinguished after the death of Kafur by the Fatimid conquest in 969.\n\nThe Fatimids\n\nThe power of this dynasty originated in central North Africa, moving to take over Egypt and Syria after 969. The following list gives all rulers of the dynasty.\n\nmap showing the size of the Fatimid caliphate.\n\nwoodwork for decoration of the Fatimid palace in Cairo\n\n(click on the image for a larger picture)\n\n297/909 Ubaydallah al-Mahdi\n\n322/934 al-Qaim\n\n334/946 al-Mansur\n\n365/975 al-Muizz\n\n386/996 al-Hakim\n\n411/\n\n427/\n\n487/\n\n495/\n\n524/1130 interregnum - rule by al-Hafiz as regent before he took the title Caliph\n\n525/1131 al-Hafiz\n\n544/1149 az-Zafir\n\n549/1154 al-Faiz\n\n555-567/1160-1171 al-Adid\n\nThe Fatimid rulers were adherents of the Shiite branch of Islam, in opposition to the Sunni branch expounded by the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphs of Baghdad, and the Fatimids proclaimed themselves rival Caliphs. They founded the city of Cairo, and ruled from there. During their time, the First Crusade established Western Christian kingdoms in the Levant. Despite this, the age of Fatimid rule was one of great prosperity, and the new city of Cairo came to outshine the older centres of the Islamic world, Damascus and Baghdad.\n\nFatimid rule was ended by Saladin, who restored Sunni Islam at the highest level.\n\nThe Ayyubids\n\n564/935 al-Malik an-Nasir I Salah ad-Din (Saladin)\n\n589/1193 al-Malik al-Aziz Imad-ad-Din\n\n595/1198 al-Malik al-Mansur Nasir ad-Din\n\n596/1200 al-Malik al-Adil I Sayf-ad-Din\n\n615/1218 al-Malik al-Kamil I Nasir ad-Din\n\n635/1238 al-Malik al-Adil II Sayf-ad-Din\n\n637/1240 al-Malik as-Salih Najm ad-Din Ayyub\n\n647/1249 al-Malik al-Muazzam Tarun-Shah\n\n648-650/1250-1252 al-Malik al-Ashraf II Muzaffar ad-Din\n\nThe first Ayyubid ruler was Saladin, of Kurdish origin, famous for reconquering Jerusalem from the Crusaders (victory at Hattin 583/1187), and for his humane treatment of all his subjects.\n\nThe Ayyubids eventually lost power to their Mamluk slave troops in Egypt and elsewhere.\n\nThe Bahri Mamluks\n\n648/1250 Shajar ad-Durr\n\n648/1250 al-Muizz Izz-ad-Din Aybak\n\n655/1257 al-Mansur Nur ad-Din Ali\n\n657/1259 al-Muzaffar Sayf ad-Din Qutuz\n\n658/1260 az-Zahir Rukn-ad-Din Baybars I al-Bunduqdari\n\n676/1277 as-Said Nasir-ad-Din Baraka Khan\n\n678/1280 al-Adil Badr-ad-Din Salamish\n\n678/1280 al-Mansur Sayf-ad-Din Qalaun al-Alfi\n\n689/1290 al-Ashraf Salah-ad-Din Khalil\n\n693/1294 an-Nasir Nasir-ad-Din Muhammad first reign\n\n694/1295 al-Adil Zayn-ad-Din Kitbugha\n\n696/1297 al-Mansur Husam-ad-Din Lahin\n\n698/1299 an-Nasir Nasir-ad-Din Muhammad second reign\n\n708/1309 al-Muzaffar Rukn-ad-Din Baybars II al-Jashankir\n\n709/1309 an-Nasir Nasir-ad-Din Muhammad third reign\n\n741/1340 al-Mansur Sayf-ad-Din Abu-Bakr\n\n742/1341 al-Ashraf Alah-ad-Din Kujuk\n\n743/1342 an-Nasir Shihab-ad-Din Ahmad\n\n743/1342 as-Salih Imad-ad-Din Ismail\n\n746/1345 al-Kamil Sayf ad-Din Shaban I\n\n747/1346 al-Muzaffar Sayf-ad-Din Hajji I\n\n748/1347 an-Nasir Nasir-ad-Din al-Hasan first reign\n\n752/1351 as-Salih Salah-ad-Din Salih\n\n755/1354 an-Nasir Nasir-ad-Din al-Hasan second reign\n\n762/1361 al-Mansur Salah-ad-Din Muhammad\n\n764/1363 al-Ashraf Nasir-ad-Din Shaban II\n\n778/1376 al-Mansur Alah-ad-Din Ali\n\n783/1382 as-Salih Salah-ad-Din Hajji I first reign\n\n784/1382 az-Zahir Sayf ad-Din Barquq (Burgi)\n\n791/1289 Hajji II second reign (with honorific title al-Muzaffar or al-Mansur)\n\nThe Burgi Mamluks\n\n784/1382 az-Zahir Sayf ad-Din Barquq first reign\n\n791/1289 Hajji II second reign (Bahri)\n\n792/1390 az-Zahir Sayf ad-Din Barquq second reign\n\n801/1399 an-Nasir Nasir-ad-Din Faraj first reign\n\n808/1405 al-Mansur Izz-ad-Din Abd-al-Aziz\n\n808/1405 an-Nasir Nasir-ad-Din Faraj second reign\n\n815/1412 al-Adil al-Mustain (Abbasid Caliph in Cairo, proclaimed Sultan)\n\n815/1412 al-Muayyad Sayf-ad-Din Tatar\n\n824/1421 al-Muzaffar Ahmad\n\n824/1421 az-Zahir Sayf-ad-Din Tatar\n\n824/1421 as-Salih Nasir-ad-Din Muhammad\n\n825/1422 al-Ashraf Sayf-ad-Din Barsbay\n\n841/1437 al-Aziz Jamal-ad-Din Yusuf\n\n842/1438 az-Zahir Sayf-ad-Din Jaqmaq\n\n857/1453 al-Mansur Fakhr-ad-Din Uthman\n\n857/1453 al-Ashraf Sayf-ad-Din Inal\n\n865/1461 al-Muayyad Shihab-ad-Din Ahmad\n\n865/1461 az-Zahir Sayf-ad-Din Khushqadam\n\n872/1467 az-Zahir Sayf-ad-Din Bilbay\n\n872/1467 az-Zahir Timurbugha\n\n872/1468 al-Ashraf Sayf-ad-Din Qait Bay\n\n901/1496 an-Nasir Muhammad\n\n903/1498 az-Zahir Qansuh\n\n905/1500 al-Ashraf Janbalat\n\n906/1501 al-Adil Sayf-ad-Din Tuman Bay\n\n906/1501 al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghawri\n\n922/1516 al-Ashraf Tuman Bay\n\nThe Mamluks were originally troops of slave status enlisted to sustain Ayyubid power. After they took control of Egypt, they achieved the reconquest of the last of the Crusader kingdoms in the Levant, and defeated the Mongols at the critical battle of Ayn Jalut (658/1260). The Mamluks are divided into an earlier group called the Bahri Mamluks, and a later group, the Burgi Mamluks; the Bahri Mamluks were originally soldiers based on Roda Island by Cairo, on the Nile (Bahr), while the Burgi Mamluks were associated with the Citadel (al-Burj). The Bahri Mamluks derived largely from Qipchaq tribesmen in what is now southern Russia, with Mongols and Kurds; the Burgi Mamluks were mainly Circassians, from the Caucasus mountains. There was a tendency for sons of the family, after two or three generations, to move into professions other than the military; the military stock was continually replaced with new troops of slave status from those areas.\n\nMamluk rule ended with the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in 1517.\n\nOttoman rulers of Egypt\n\nIn 1517 Selim I conquered Egypt. Until the relative autonomy of the Muhammad Ali dynasty in the nineteenth century, Egypt remained a part of the Ottoman Turkish Empire. Until the proclamation of the kingdom in 1914, Egypt was still nominally under Ottoman rule. The following list gives the Ottoman rulers on the throne between 1517 and 1914. The capital of the Ottoman Empire was Istanbul, the new name for Byzantium/Constantinople, conquered by the Ottomans in 1453.\n\n918/1512 Selim I Yuvaz ('the Grim')\n\n926/1520 Sulayman II Qanuni ('the Law-Giver', in European history known as 'the Magnificent')\n\n974/1566 Selim II\n\n982/1574 Murad III\n\n1003/1595 Muhammad III\n\n1012/1603 Ahmad I\n\n1026/1617 Mustafa I first reign\n\n1027/1618 Uthman II\n\n1031/1622 Mustafa I second reign\n\n1032/1623 Murad IV\n\n1049/1640 Ibrahim\n\n1058/1648 Muhammad IV\n\n1099/1687 Sulayman III\n\n1102/1691 Ahmad II\n\n1106/1695 Mustafa II\n\n1115/1703 Ahmad III\n\n1143/1730 Mahmud I\n\n1168/1754 Uthman III\n\n1171/1757 Mustafa III\n\n1187/1774 Abd al-Hamid I\n\n1203/1789 Selim III\n\n1222/1807 Mustafa IV\n\n1223/1808 Mahmud II\n\n1255/1839 Abd-al-Majid I\n\n1277/1861 Abd-al-Aziz\n\n1293/1876 Murad V\n\n1293/1876 Abd-al-Hamid II\n\n1327/1909 Mohammad V Rashad\n\nThe line of Muhammad Ali (Khedival Period)\n\n1220/1805 Muhammad Ali Pasha\n\n1264/1848 Ibrahim Pasha\n\n1264/1848 Abbas I Pasha\n\n1270/1854 Said Pasha\n\n1280/1863 Ismail (Khedive from 1284/1867)\n\n1296/1879 Tawfiq\n\n1309/1892 Abbas II Hilmi\n\n1333/1914 Husayn Kamil (Sultan)\n\n1335/1917 Ahmad Fuad I (king from 1340/1922)\n\n1355/1936 Faruq\n\n1371-1372/1952-1953 Fuad II\n\nMuhamad Ali was of Turkish Albanian origin, and came to Egypt as part of the Ottoman forces sent to expel the French Revolutionary expedition of 1798-1801. He rose to power, removing the Mamluk ruling class, and obtained the title Pasha as governor of Egypt. He led the modernisation of Egyptian agriculture, medicine and technology. His son Ismail was given the title Khedive (of Iranian origin). As a kingdom, Egypt became independent of the Ottoman Empire. However, from 1882 there was an occupying British military force in the country, and British Protectorate status only ended in 1922. Full independence was secured by the revolution of 1952, forcing the abdication of king Faruq, with the abolition of the monarchy a year later.\n\nSince 1953 Egypt has been an independent republic.\n\nCopyright © 2003 University College London.
