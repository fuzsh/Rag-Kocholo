        "text": "Muslims have probably been living in the South-East Asian archipelago since the death of the Prophet Muhammad. Middle-Eastern merchants and sailors have a long history of voyage in South-East Asia and doubtless some Arabic travelers carried their new faith into the region since the seventh century. According to tradition, the Sahabah, the companions and disciples of the Prophet, are said to have preached in South-East Asia and China. But the faith remained a minority in the region, subordinate to Hinduism and Buddhism for several centuries. In the 12th century, a group of Muslim Indians, recent converts themselves, converted the ruler of the city-state of Kedah on the Malay Peninsula. Sultan Mudzafar Shah I (1136-1179), formerly Phra Ong Mahawangsa, became the first Islamic state in South-East Asia. Next, the state of Samudera Pasai, in Sumatra, converted in 1267. In the proceeding centuries, Islam would blossom in the archipelago and the religious landscape would change forever. By the late 14th century Islam was a major power in the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, the northern coasts of Java, and Brunei in Northern Borneo. Conversion to Islam gave states important cultural and trade contacts with foreign kingdoms in northern India, the Middle East and Africa. Trade flourished and the Malay states became enriched. This is the era of the legendary Sultanate of Melaka.\n\nThe actual concrete reasons for the rising popularity of Islam among the states in the archipelago is not fully known and there are various theories. One of the main reasons which is mentioned is the trade contacts offered by conversion. Northern Indian was conquered by the Islamic Ghurids by the 1200s and would soon be replaced by the more powerful and cohesive Delhi sultanate. Besides Rajput lands, northern India would become a Islamic power center. Even while Southern India remained Hindu, Islamic missionaries would be proliferate and many Southern Indian merchants would convert. The later Hindu Vijayangar empire in Southern India would practice religious tolerance and, even though very Hindu, adopt many culture norms from their northern Islamic neighbors. Adopting Islam or Islamic norms would become a necessity for any Malay merchant hoping to trade with India or the Middle East. In the same vein, adopting Islamic culture would become necessary for any ruler hoping to woo foreign merchants to his port.\n\nOne of the other factors in the rise of Islam in the Malay states in the western archipelago may be found in the religious politics of the region. The Javanese Hindu Majapahit Empire, while weakening, was still a major power in the region. On the other hand the Malay peninsula was subject to the energetic expansionist policy of the new Thai polity, the Buddhist Ayutthaya. The Thai kingdom had grown powerful after the decline of the Khmer Angkor Empire and its power began to stretch down the peninsula. Many Malay states were forced to pay tribute to Ayutthaya. Trapped between these two Hindu and Buddhist powers, Islam may have became popular during this time as local rulers looked to new forms of legitimacy.\n\nThe greatest of these Islamic Malay states was the Sultanate of Melaka, which in a single century would grow to the wealthiest in the archipelago. According to legend the sultanate's royal lineage can be traced back to a Sri Vijaya prince who fled Sumatra after a Majapahit assault and lived in Singapura (also known as Temasek) probably sometime during the 14th century. Sometime later, either the same prince or his descendants were attacked again in Singapura by Majapahit and fled west along the coast-line of the Malay peninsula. Finding the spot where the Malay straits were the narrowest, they made alliances with the local Orang Laut and founded a new port city, Melaka. By the 15th century, their old enemy, Majapahit was weakening and in this economic and political vacuum Malacca was able to rise to prominence.\n\nTrade and religion are the two major elements that the city is remembered by. It is said that Parameswara, the first ruler of Melaka that we know of, became a Muslim in 1414 after marrying a princess from Samudera Pasai. He took the name Iskander Shah. However, some say that the rulers of Melaka were already Islamic before this time. One way or another, the spread of Islam seems to have been a special consideration for Melaka and under Iskander’s successor, Megat Iskander Shah, Islam began to rise in popularity in the archipelago. Packaged with the spread of Islam was also the spread of Malay culture. During the 15th century Malay culture begin to infiltrate the highlands of the Malay peninsula and the mountainous areas of Sumatra and Borneo. Culture and religion could spread rapidly thanks to Malacca’s new control over many of the trade routes of the archipelago. Thanks to its strategic position on the Malay straits, the rulers could control all the trade going from the Indian Ocean to East Asia. Malacca was propelled into financial greatness by its early trade contacts with Ming China. The Ming court had renewed interest in the southern seas and this was the era of Zhang He‘s treasure fleets. Melaka, more so then most of the other states of South-East Asia, sought a close alliance with China. The port city gained favored status at the Ming court and other south-east Asia polities were discouraged from making war on the port. When the Ming naval interest in the region begun to dwindle in the 1430s, Melaka established a relationship with the northern Islamic ports of Java and the cities of Sumatra and became the economic center of the region. All manner of spices and trade goods had to pass through Melaka or her trade partners.\n\nAfter the death of Iskander Shah, Malacca became a significant military and political power under his successors, largely thanks to the talented prime minster Tun Perak who can be thought of as the Gajah Mada of Melaka. Sultan Muzaffar Shah (r. 1445 to 1459) appointed the talented Tun Perak (d. 1498) as his prime minister and Tun Perak would lead the small kingdom to greatness over the next 50 years. Tun Perak's main problem was the Thai kingdom. While Majapahit was becoming a memory, the Ayutthaya was still aggressively trying to control the Malay peninsula. Many of the cities of the Malay Peninsula were still under the thumb of the Thai kingdom during this period and even Malacca had been forced to pay tribute. The amount was probably small but ritually significant. Malacca could not become a true power while paying tribute to its rivals. Sultan Muzaffar Shah refused to pay tribute to Ayytthaya and Tun Perak managed to defeat two Thai armies which were sent against the city in response. While this period of Malacca history is obscure, it is known that Malacca probably became the prominent political power in the western part of the archipelago during this time. After the death of Tun Perak in 1498, Melaka was posed to continue in its golden age for some time (the kingdom managed to conquer Kelantan in 1506) but Melaka's age was cut short by the Portuguese attack in 1511.\n\nIn 1509 the Portuguese sent a diplomatic party to Melaka to establish trade, but the court was under the influence of the prime minister Bendahara Sri Maharaja Tun Mutahir who was a Tamil Muslim and led a faction composed of his fellow countrymen. The Portuguese had mistreated many Muslims in Goa and the Indian community in Malacca was against any dealings with Portugal. -They argued that the Sultan Mahmud Shah should capture the party. -Finally there was a attempt to capture the Portuguese party but word leaked out and some escaped. While this could be looked at as a casus belli for the Portuguese to invade, Portugal’s long term plans was to disrupt Venice and Islamic trade in the Indian Ocean and control the trade routes to China and the Spice islands, they would have probably invaded Malacca anyway.\n\nThe Portuguese fleet invaded in 1511 under the command of Afonso de Albuquerque. The army was composed of 1200 men and 17-18 ships. The first assault on Malacca actually failed and many argued against another attack. The Malacca fortress city had it’s own artillery, though inferior to the western cannons, they were still a threat. Most of Albuquerque’s commanders thought that the city could hold up to another assault. However, against staggering odds, Albuquerque’s second assault was a success and he capture the port city, ending the Melaka empire. The royal family of Melaka would make several attempts to retake the city, however they would all be failures. The Melaka empire was finished.\n\nWhile seemingly a shocking success, the fall of Melaka planted the seeds of failure for Portugal's long term strategy in East Asia. The fall of one of it’s prominent tributary states would make China a constant enemy of Portugal for the next several decades, China would deny their request to create a colony at Hong Kong and defeat the Portuguese navy twice in 1522 and 1524. Portuguese and Chinese relations would become so strained that many Portuguese were simply massacred and their bodies mutilated and hung up to display at Guangzhou. It would take a full three decades before the Portuguese were allowed to set up a settlement at Macau in 1557. Meanwhile, the royal family of Melaka would flee and set up a new sultanate, Johor. The “holy war” attitude of Portugal would turn most Islamic traders against them, and many Malay, Javanese, Indian, and Chinese merchants would simply bypass Portuguese controlled ports and head for Johor or Aceh. Competition and wars between Portuguese Malacca, Aceh, and Johor would dominate the political scene of the western archipelago for the next century. By the dawn of the 17th century, Portugal's south-east Asian holdings would be easy prey to the Dutch.\n\nNot much is known about the specifics of the military of Malay states during this period, even great Melaka, but sources from the general region can be used. Common weapons, as elsewhere in the archipelago, were sword, spear and kris. Shields would have been made of rattan, leather, wood or some combination of the three. Chinese accounts point toward the use of bows in naval engagements and blow darts were also probably used. The Chinese sources also state that, in order to guard against raiding junks from Temasek (14th century Singapore/Singapura), sailors would equip themselves with armor to protect against these projectiles so we can be sure that armor was probably used in the general peninsula region. The armor was probably of the padded vest type that survives in the ethnological record of the region. Alternatively there is a enigmatic source from 13th century Borneo that mentions bronze armor and that style of armor may have also been used.\n\nCavalry was probably little used by the Malay states during this era. Later European accounts mention that cavalry was rarely fielded by states in Sumatra and the Malay peninsula. However, we know from the Portuguese accounts of the fall of Melaka that elephants were fielded by at least the Melaka sultanate.\n\nWhen under siege, the whole town could contribute to the defense and women could participate in the battle. When the Portuguese attacked Melaka, women are recorded to have left their homes and fought in the defense of the town.\n\nThe actually naval capabilities of the region are also not known, but during the 14th century Temasek could muster 200-300 \"pirate\" junks against ships passing through the strait and the later Melaka and other Malay cities could probably muster similar numbers. How big these Junks were is not known, but they probably varied considerably. Chinese sources say that Ayyuthaya threatened Temasek with only seventy war junks, presumably most of Temasek's 200 odd Junks were probably sleeker raiding ships.\n\nGunpowder was in use by 1511, when the Portuguese captured Melaka they found a large number of guns of various sizes. The accounts say that they found some 3000 guns. A few were very large siege cannon as were being used in the middle east and India during this age. One had been sent by the King of Calicut. De Burres states that, \"All the artillery with its appurtenances was of such workmanship that it could not be excelled, even in Portugal.\" Sadly we don't know what type of guns the majority were, but they were probably Chinese style cannon and the smaller Rentaka (or Lankata) swivel guns. Interestingly enough, the Portuguese also mention that matchlocks were already in use in Melaka when it was conquered. Matchlock technology was still very new east of the Levant. The Janissaries of the Ottoman Empire had equipped themselves with matchlocks since the 1440s. And a large number of these weapons were ordered by Babur later in 1526 who would use them to great effect to conquer northern India. If Melaka had matchlocks and well-made Calicut cannons in 1511, it may be that the Indian ocean networks (Southern India and the Malay states) were already on the cutting age of gunpowder weapons before northern India, Pakistan and central Asia."
