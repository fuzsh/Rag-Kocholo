        "text": "Towards the end of Darius' reign, intense struggle with Greece began which ended the superiority of the Persians. Xerxes, son of Darius, was king of Persia at this time. In the early part of his reign there were revolts in Egypt and Babylonia to deal with, but six years later he was ready to turn his attention toward Greece. Xerxes tried to attack Athens but all he accomplished was destroying the deserted city and burning the temples on the Acropolis, while the Athenians were waiting for him at Salamis. Xerxes believed that in order for him to gain control of the Peloponnese he would have to win this battle. The Greek and Persian fleets fought at Salamis, under Themistocles, in 480 B.C. The Greeks won a convincing victory. Later, the Achaemenid (Persian) attempt to overrun Greece was ended. In 465 BC, Xerxes was killed in his palace and his successor Artaxerxes continued building work at Persepolis. It was completed during the reign of Artaxerxes III, around 338 BC. In 334 BC, Alexander the Great defeated the Persian armies of the third Darius. He marched into Iran and, once there, he turned his attention to Persepolis, and that magnificent complex of buildings was burnt down. This act of destruction for revenge of the Acropolis, was surprising from one who prided himself on being a pupil of Aristotle. This was the end of the Persian Empire.\n\nMEDES\n\nMedian names are followed by their Greek transcriptions, as those are generally better recognized.\n\nDeioces\n\nKshatrita (Phraortes)\n\n728-675\n\n675-653\n\nSCYTHIAN\n\nMadius 653-625\n\nMEDES\n\nUwakshatra (Cyaxares)\n\nIshtumegu (Astyages)\n\n625-585\n\n585-550\n\nACHAEMENID\n\nAs with the Medes, I give the much more widely recognized Greek transcriptions of these names in parentheses, where I have them available.\n\nMACEDON\n\nAlexander\n\nPhilip\n\nAntigonus One-eye\n\n330-323\n\n323-316\n\n316-312 d. 301\n\nSELEUCID\n\nSeleucus I\n\nAntiochus I Soter\n\nAntiochus II Theos\n\n312-280\n\n280-261\n\n261-246\n\nPARTHIA\n\nSASSANID\n\nSAFFARID\n\nYaqub the Coppersmith\n\nAmir I\n\nTahir\n\n867-879\n\n879-901\n\n901-902 d. 908\n\nAn era of disunity follows, as competing local dynasts established spheres of influence from the 10th century onwards.
