        "text": "يو Melayu\n\n末羅瑜國 Ma La Yu\n\nThe Malays ( : Melayu, : ملايو), or more-specifically \"Ethnic Malays\" (in order to avoid confusions with Malay Race) are an Austronesian ethnic (ethno-religious according to some sources) group that is indigenous to the Malaccan region of Southeast Asia. This would include the Malay Peninsula (shared between West Malaysia and southern Thailand), Singapore and the eastern parts of Sumatra. They are also native to the coastal regions of the island of Borneo. The ethnic Malays are part of the bigger Malay Race which encompasses all of the Austronesian groups in Southeast Asia and Oceania.\n\nThe ethnic Malays are descended from the many Malayic-speaking civilizations that thrived in eastern Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia and southern Thailand. This region is traditionally known as the Alam Melayu, or the Malay realm. The modern-day Malay identity (speaking Malay and being Muslim) evolved from influence of the Malacca Sultanate, which created a nationalism of Malay culture that largely influenced the other Austronesian-speaking civilizations through the migration of voyages of Malays outside their traditional realm, especially those in the rest of the Indonesian Archipelago as far as Thailand and the Philippines.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe possible etymologies of Malay are from ancient Chinese and Indian contexts, people from these two groups\n\nhad a high desire to travel to the Malay Archipelago.\n\n- Indian mythology mentions a place far east of the Indian Subcontinent named Malayadvipa which translates into \"mountainous\" in Old Sanskrit. Some historians argue that this was referring to Sumatra in Indonesia, where the Malay language originated.\n\n- I-Tsing ( : 義淨 Yi Jing or I-Ching), a Chinese monk from the Tang Dynasty; visited maritime Southeast Asia and stumbled across the Malayu Kingdom ( : 末羅瑜國 Ma La Yu) which also hints a possible origin for the term. Its speakers were also that of an early Malay dialect.[6]\n\nI-Tsing is also credited with having translated Buddhist scripts from Sanskrit/Pali to Chinese. Malay was already spoken as the lingua franca and eventually the native language of these kingdoms. The earliest document written in the Malay language is a small metal plate inscription in the Indonesian island of Sumatra, known as the Kedukan Bukit Inscription.[7] Modern-day definitions and concepts of a Malay also differ. In Malaysia, the qualifications of being Malay originate from nationalist sentiments. Known as \"Malayness\" or Kemelayuan, these include speaking Malay, professing Islam and keeping royal tradition. This can apply to some Austronesian non-Malay groups living in Malaysia, such as the Buginese and Javanese both of which are native to Indonesia. In Indonesia, the usage of the \"Malay\" or Melayu only refers to the native Malay-speakers in the country since Malay is regarded as a separate indigenous language from Indonesian, the national language. In the Philippines, no distinctions are made between Malays as in ethnicity or ethnic family. The Muslims of the southern Philippines have a misconception of being called Malay, and despite following a Malay-influenced culture, are not considered ethnic Malays since they do not speak the language natively.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly History & Ancestry\n\nThe ethnic Malay people have several various ancestral origins themselves, containing a hodgepodge of Austro-Asiatic,\n\nAustronesian, Indian and Chinese origin. Malays are descended from two prehistoric migrations, a maritime migration of Austronesian people from Taiwan, China and Philippines; and a land migration from China to the Malay Peninsula, into Thailand, Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia and into Sumatra of Austro-Asiatic tribes. Indian traders introduced the Indo-Aryan languages, such as Sanskrit and Pali. They brought over the religions of Hinduism, Buddhism and later, Islam, to the Malay Archipelago. Due to the arrival of Islam, Malaysia and Brunei are home to many prominent Malay families that contain Arab ancestry such as those in Putrajaya which is Malaysia's religious capital. As with other Southeast Asian civilizations, the early Malay kingdoms were discovered by Chinese travellers to the region.\n\nMelayu Kingdom 688-695 B.C.\n\nThe existance of the classical kingdom known as Malayu ( : 末羅瑜國 Mòluóyú Guó) is rooted\n\nfrom I-Tsing's accounts on his voyages to Southeast Asia. This kingdom had very close ties with Srivijaya, it is noted that it could have been a vessel kingdom to Srivijaya, or any nature that involved Srivijayan control.\n\nThis extract from I-Tsing accounts gives a brief description of his travel route between Bogha (Srivijaya) and the civilization known as the Malayu.\n\n\"Wu Hing came to Bogha after a month's sail. The king received him very favourably and respected him as a guest from the land of the son of heaven of the Great Tang. He went on board the king's ship to the country of Malayu and arrived there after fifteen days sail. Thence he went to Ka Cha, again after fifteen days. At the end of winter he changed ship and sailed to the west.\"\n\nI-Tsing describes its location in this next excerpt,\n\n\"In the country of Sribogha, we see the shadow of the dial-plate become neither long nor short (i.e \"remain unchanged\" or \"no shadow\") in the middle of the eighth month (Autumnal equinox), and at midday no shadow falls from a man who is standing on that day, so it is in the middle of spring (Vernal equinox).\"\n\nThe descriptions of the geographical instruments lead many historians to pin-point a kingdom spanning the earth's equator. The kingdom could have spanned northeastern Sumatra, Malacca and Pelambang. Buddhism was the predominant religion in this particular state, the Hinayana section. [8]\n\nSrivijaya Kingdom 600-1200\n\nAccording to the Kedukan Bukit Inscription, in 682 A.D., a military leader by the name of Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa came to Palembang from Tamwan and Jambi with 20,000 soldiers. In Pelambang, Sri Jayanasa\n\nestablished a central capital that became the Srivijaya Empire (c. 600-1200 A.D.), which became one of the main region of power in the Malay Peninsula and Southeast Asia. I-Tsing arrived in Srivijaya in 688 A.D. and stayed there for seven years. He referred to the Srivijayan kingdom as Bogha which was a trader partner of China. The Arabs and Persians therefore also became aware of Srivijaya, and led to the latter Islamization of the Malay Archipelago. Armies from the nearby island of Java threatened the Malay communities in Sumatra. In 990, a Javanese kingdom known from central Java known as the Mataram\n\ninvaded Srivijaya but failed to conquer it which led to the establishment of a military protectorate with China at Chulamanivarmadeva's (ruler of Srivijaya) request. In 1006 A.D., the Srivijayans conquered Mataram. The Indians had not forgotten about the Malay Archipelago, prompting an invasion led by Rajendra Chola from the Coromandel Peninsula in India. Chola also failed to conquer Srivijaya. In 1025 however, he led a re-strengthened invasion that gave him new territory in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. All that remained was Palembang in Indonesia, with Javanese naval forces would siege. Palembang's kings turned to China again for military aid, but it was too late, the conquest of Palembang was complete and the Chinese officials that were sent there were killed by the new Javanese rulers.[9] Srivijayan politics reflected Indian influence. Rajahs and datus were Austronesian governers of lower-ranking nobility. They ruled states known as rajahnates smaller principalities known as barangays. Sri was also a title of supreme royalty, also of Indian influence. After Melayu and Srivijaya's defeat against Javanese armies, Malays came under Javanese rule in the Majapahit Empire until Islam's arrival which would form the backbone of the enmity between these two groups that perrsisted over the centuries.[10][11] The Srivijaya Empire's power and monopoly was vanquished, at the hands of Indian invaders led by Rajendra Chola.\n\nIndian Invasion and Rule\n\nIn 1025 A.D., Rajendra Chola, who ruled from a South Indian dynasty based in Tamil Nadu, led many maritime invasions and raids in Sumatra and Kedah (then the polity of Kadaram). This event is rather paradoxical, due to the millenia-long friendly and peaceful relations between the civilizations of modern-day India and Indonesia. The Srivijayans were unprepared for the invasion, therefore Chola's invasion was swift, taking direct routes from the Bay of Bengal to western Sumatra. After capturing and imprisoning Srivijaya's kings, Chola's invasion took a trickle-down effect on the Malay realm, continuing to conquer the other Malay kingdoms and polities, including Kadaram in modern-day Kedah, as well as Palembang, capturing and imprisoning their rulers as well as hoarding their treasures and wealth. Cities were also sacked and plundered.\n\nThe monsoons of Southeast Asia seemed to be a recipe for Chola's swift naval and military successes against the Malay civilizations in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. This allowed for Chola's forces to move swiftly from port to port - leaving Srivijaya's defenses unable to provide any sort of reliable response to the invasion.[12][12][13] The war ended with a victory for the Cholas and major losses for the Srivijaya Empire ending the Srivijaya maritime monopoly in the region.[14][15][16][17]\n\nSoon afterwords, Rajendra Chola married a local Malay princess.[18] Despite the devastation and chaos left by the invasion, the Malays were not under direct rule or administration, as the goal of the invasion was clearly to plunder rather than occupy Sumatra. Rather, it divided the Malays into separate small polities. The Malays also rather absorbed Tamil influence, and accepted Tamil rulers into the royalty.\n\nRajahnate of Cebu 1200-1565\n\nMuch of the information regarding the Rajahnate of Cebu, is found from Visayan and Philippine folklore, as well as the Italian historian Antonio Pigafetta who documented the ancient Philippine civilizations during the Spanish expedition to the archipelago. This kingdom was known to have started around 1200 A.D. According to Visayan folklore, the Chola dynasty in Sumatra, sent a minor prince, by the name of Rajamuda Lumaya known more commonly by Sri Lumay, to the central Philippine island of Cebu to establish a vassal state and a base. Sri Lumay, of Malay and Tamil descent, and settled with several sons and his family.[19] One of his sons, was Sri Alho who ruled southern Cebu. Sri Lumay's descendants would play a major role, in the Spanish conquest of the Philippine islands.\n\nInstead of continuing his mission for the Chola Dynasty, Sri Lumay rebelled and found his own kingdom, what historians commonly refer to as the Rajahnate of Cebu ( : Kerajaan Sugbu). This particular kingdom is evidence of strong Indian and Malay influence in ancient Philippines.\n\nUpon the Islamization of the Malay Archipelago, Sri Lumay battled the Muslim invaders from the southern neighboring island of Mindanao. They were referred to a Magalos, meaning \"destroyers of peace\". Sri Lumay was well-known for his use of scorched-earth policy for the Muslim invaders, leaving nothing for them to loot or plunder. It is for this reason where the name \"Cebu\" originates, from the Malay word sugbu as well as its Cebuano cognate sugbo, which means \"scorched-earth\".\n\nIts capital was known as Singhapala, which today is modern-day Cebu City, and was known by the Malay phrase Kota Raya Kita, meaning \"Our Great Fortress\".\n\nIslamization & Golden Age of Sultanates\n\nCirca 674 A.D., Arab traders introduced Islam in Sumatra in Indonesia but in 1100 A.D., Indian Muslim converts arrived in Kedah and converted its population to Islam. Malay rulers who converted to Islam became sultans.\n\nPhra Ong Mahawangsa, the Hindu king of Kedah, converted to Islam and changed his name to Muzaffar Shah, and became the first recorded sultan and convert in Malaysian history. The Kedah Sultanate therefore became Malaysia's first recorded-sultanate.[20] In 1405, Zheng He (1371-1433), a Chinese Muslim eunuch from the Ming Dynasty arrived in Java in Indonesia and Malacca on the way through his voyages in Southeast Asia. There, he became a main driving force in the mass conversion of the Southeast Asian natives to Islam.[21] He made more voyages in 1413, 1416 and 1433 and went back to Java and Malacca, converting more people to Islam.[22] During the 1416 and 1433 voyages, he reached Palembang in Malaysia and strengthened Islam in the region, characterizing and re-shaping the Malay culture of Malaysia. Many of the royal figures in the Malay regions adopted Islam and adhered to its traditions. The traditional rajahs or datus retained their ruling positions many converted to Islam and either became missionaries or subjects to sultans.\n\nSultanate of Malacca 1402-1511\n\nIn 1402, Parameswara, a Hindu prince from Singapore, converted to Islam and turned the ancient Srivijaya\n\nKingdom into the Sultanate of Malacca ( : Kesultanan Melaka, : كسلطانن ملاك). Parameswara changed his name to Iskander Shah ( : إسكندر شه) as well. In 1444, Malacca became ruled by a Hindu king named Abu Syahid Shah. Unlike the other Malay rulers, Shah remained a Hindu and never converted to Islam; yet he was still titled as the Sultan of Malacca. Shah's rule as a non-Muslim sultan was very short-lived, he was murdered by Indian Muslims in 1446. Hang Tuah ( : هڠ تواه), a warrior from Malacca, is considered one of the most inspirational figures in Malay history renowned for his nationalistic battle cry, \"Malays will never vanish off of the earth\".[23]\n\nSultanates Outside of the Malay Peninsula\n\nThe Islamized Malay culture and influence had begun to spread throughout Maritime Southeast Asia, outside of the Malays' traditional realm, particularily Borneo, southern Thailand and the southern Philippines. This happen via the migration of Malay rulers outside the Malay Peninsula, and spreading their culture to the other natives who in-turn, assimilated into Malay culture. According to Bruneian legend, the Sultanate of Brunei, which at its greatest extent, covered northern Borneo as far north as Manila Bay, was founded by a descendant of Dewa Emas Kayangan, who descended from heaven in married several maidens. Not much is known about the Brunei Sultanate's history, but it reached the height of its extent as a thalassocratic power under Bolkiah, its fifth sultan. Even though Brunei was ruled by sultans of several ethnic origins and intermixes such as Arab, Indian and Chinese, Sultan Bolkiah himself was a Malay. After conquering Sulu, Bolkiah moved to occupy Tondo and Maynila - two prospering states in the Philippine island of Luzon that the latter European powers would also envy and conquer. Bolkiah occupied both kingdoms and converted many of their populations to Islam, renaming Maynila to Selurong - extending the sultanate beyond Borneo and into the Philippines.[24] Shariff Muhammad Kabungsuwan, a missionary from Malacca, emigrated to the southern Philippine island of Mindanao and found the Sultanate of Maguindanao which lasted through 1898, freeing Mindanao from Bolkiah's rule. Kabungsuwan's move to spread Islam in the island of Mindanao was met by resistance from native pagan tribes, whom he soundly defeated, thereby establishing his rule and solidifying his control of Mindanao. He married a local princess and his descendants would join the other Muslim tribes of Mindanao in their war against Spanish conquest. The Sultanate of Patani (1516-1902) was established in southern Thailand, just like Brunei, not much is historically known about Patani's early history or establishment, and can only found through legends and folktales.\n\nColonial Era 1400s-1965\n\nDuring the Age of Colonialism, the Malay Archipelago was the target of European powers. It was given the name \"East Indies\". The Dutch and British came extensively with economic intentions. The\n\nSpanish and Portuguese conquistadors (literally Spanish/Portuguese for conqueror) also had the religious intent of converting the natives to Roman Catholicism. Ferdinand Magellan was a Portuguese conquistador who worked for Spain was sent to look for what other Portuguese travelers called the \"Spice Islands\", which was the Maluku Islands in Indonesia. His slave, who he named \"Henrique\", a native from Malacca, became his translator and converted him to Catholicism. It is Henrique who accompanied Magellan and allowed him to converse with natives, with played a crucial role in his overseas successes. Instead of finding Indonesia, Megallan discovered the Philippines in 1521 where he and Henrique died in battle against native\n\narmies in Visayas. Because Islam had such a strong hold in the region, the Portuguese failed to convert the Malays to Catholicism. The Malays fought with heavy resistance setting up Portuguese attempts to convert them to Catholicism for failure. Brunei lost Tondo and Maynila to Spain, consequently those two territories were swiftly Christianized. For some time, the Spanish armies enjoyed successes against the armies of Brunei but had to retreat due to illness in what is known as the Castille War. The Portuguese ceded Singapore and Malaysia to the British and Indonesia to the Dutch. The British and Dutch embraced multi-culturalism rather than assimilation. They even hired sultans and local royalty to govern colonial territories in the islands. The various sultanates became protectorates of the United Kingdom. Amir Hamzah, a Malay Indonesian poet from Langkat, wrote poems and nationalist works for the Indonesian independance cause.\n\nHamzah was killed by members of the Communist Party of Indonesia in 1945 and reburied properly after his body was found in a mass grave.[25] In 1948, the Federation of Malaya ( : Persekutuan Tanah Melayu) was formed, which was carved from 11 states on the Malay Peninsula. This federation formed as a result of Malay displeasure of the preceding Malayan Union, which was to be a British Crown Colony. The Federation of Malaya existed as a British protectorate, with the local Malay rulers exerting their influence and political prestige. In 1963, the Malayan Federation merged and united with the former British Crown colonies of North Borneo (modern-day Sabah) and Sarawak, forming the country today known as Malaysia. In 1965, Singapore, a former Malay state, broke away from Malaysia, becoming the last Malay state to gain independence, though most of its inhabitants were Chinese.\n\nRelations With Other Ethnic Groups\n\nAfter independence, Malays have experienced many ethnic struggles in Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore. Despite being native to Singapore, Malays in Singapore have experienced social discrimination by their Chinese counterparts, who now make up Singapore's majority. In Thailand, the government did not recognize a \"Malay ethnicity\", and designated the term \"Thai Muslim\" for the Malays that inhabit southern Thailand. Even up to now, despite being Muslim and native to Indonesia, there has been many ethnic tensions between Indonesian Malays and the Javanese people, a rivalry that has dated back several millennia before Islam even reached the shores of Sumatra or Java up to Sukarno's opposition to the creation of Malaysia as a state. Despite the ethnic tensions in Indonesia, Indonesian culture is still rooted from Malay culture, such as their national language, Indonesian; which is a form of the Malay language. Malaysia and Brunei's cultures are also of predominant Malay influence, and root strongly from Malay nationalism. The tradition of Malay royalty is preserved in Malaysia and Brunei's politics. Each state in Malaysia is ruled by a sultan, and the country contains a king or head-of-state ( : Yang di-Pertuan Agong). In contrast, Indonesia is a republic whose politicians were mostly Javanese. Hamzah Haz, the leader of Indonesia's United Development Party became the country's vice president in 2001-2004, the country's first major Malay politician.\n\nReligion\n\nHistorically, Malays were Animists. After the arrival and influence of Chinese and Indian traders and missionaries to Southeast Asia, Malays adopted Hinduism and Buddhism. Today, about 99.9% of Malays are adherents to the Sunni section of Islam. Islam was introduced by Arab traders in Sumatra but spread\n\nby Indian Muslim and Chinese Muslim converts. In Singapore there is also a group following the Sufi section of Islam, which is a mystical section. According to mainstream Malay tradition, being Muslim is required to be considered Malay and forms a pillar of \"Malayness\" ( : Kemelayuan). Brunei's government imposes very strict laws against non-Muslims, the introducing and preaching of other religions is prohibited in Brunei, whereas it is allowed in Malaysia with strict regulations. Brunei and Malaysia's federal court systems are also influenced by Islam, anyone converting out of Islam must go to the courts to get his/her conversion legally recognized. Anyone who converts out of Islam in Malaysia or Brunei would no longer be recognized a Malay.\n\nLanguage\n\nThe Malays speak an Austronesian language known commonly as Malay, which is a pluricentric language. It is the national language of Malaysia (as Malaysian), Indonesia (as Indonesian), Brunei; one of Singapore's official languages and a minority in Thailand and Australia. The most commonly spoken dialects are the Indonesian and Malaysian registers of Malay.\n\nStandard Malay\n\nThe main standard dialect that we come to know as \"Malay\" as a lone proper term is spoken in Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore, this version is officially recognized as Bahasa Melayu in Singapore and Brunei which literally translates to \"Malay language\", and in Malaysia it is known as Bahasa Malaysia, or Malaysian language. It is descended from the Malaccan dialect, and functions as the national languages of Malaysia and Brunei, and one of four official languages in Singapore. In Malaysia and Brunei, it is mostly spoken as a second language since the various Malay groups of the two countries speak their own dialects of Malay. Malay was the official language of the Malayan independence movement. It was changed to Bahasa Malaysia (Malaysian language) to create a sense of unity among all ethnic groups in Malaysia, and is referred to as Bahasa Malaysia by the non-Malay groups, while the Malays continue to refer to it as Bahasa Melayu.\n\nIndonesian\n\nMalay is also the national language of Indonesia and is designated as Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian language) which contains 80% cognates with its Malaysian counterpart, and is also descended from the Malaccan dialect. The development of an Indonesian language occured during the colonial era, where more than half of the population spoke Javanese. A lingua franca was needed, but one that would not favor a single ethnic group (Javanese in this case). The Malay language, having been the lingua franca of the archipelago for millenia was already well-understood by many people, and was the language used to convert natives to certain religions such as Islam and Christianity. Therefore, Malay was chosen as the unifying language of politics, education and nationalism. The developing of Bahasa Indonesia was very successful, and allowed for the unification of the Indonesian archipelago. Indonesians distinguish Bahasa Melayu and Bahasa Indonesia as two different languages, contrary to the Malaysian point of view.[26] Indonesians associate Bahasa Melayu with Malaysia, and also enjoys the status as a separate local and indigenous language from Indonesian. When one does not include the Indonesian language, the Malay language is the second-most spoken local language in Indonesia from Javanese.\n\nOther Dialects\n\nThe Yawi language, or Bahasa Jawi is Malay dialect spoken in the Malaysian state of Kelantan and the southern regions of Thailand, most notably the Patani province. It is also known as \"Kelantan-Patani Malay\" ( : Melayu Patani-Kelantan). It speakers number about 1,000,000 in Thailand and 1,500,000 in Malaysia. The various Malay groups from Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei speak their own dialects of Malay before learning Indonesian or Standard Malay. Although Standard Malay is Brunei's national language, Bruneian Malay or Brunei Melayu is the natively spoken dialect among the people. Bruneian Malay is not too intelligible with Indonesian or Malaysian. There is also another group native to Sumatra known as the Minangkabau people, who share a very identical culture with the Malays. There is dispute between historians and linguists alike as to whether the Minangkabau language should be considered a dialect of Malay or an seperate language.[27] As Indonesia is a very large and diverse country, the country is home to many local Malay dialects and creoles spoken by non-Malay groups. The same can be said of the eastern parts of the Malaysian state of Sabah as well as the southern Philippines.\n\nWriting system\n\nThe modern Malay language, as well as Indonesian, is written in the Latin script, known as Rumi. For centuries, an Arabic script known as Jawi (not to be mistaken for Bahasa Jawi) was used. Rumi gradually replaced Jawi. The Jawi script is mostly used by the conservative Muslim royal families in Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore and the southern Philippines. Jawi is co-official to Rumi in Brunei, and is an alternative in Malaysia, especially in the state of Kelantan.\n\nEnglish and Arabic\n\nDue to Malaysia and Singapore's histories as former British territories, the two countries have absorbed the English language to where it is spoken as a language of bussiness. English is one of Singapore's four official languages, and while Malaysian is the national languageo of Malaysia, English is also officially recognized. As a result, Malays are proficient in English. A form of code-switching in Malaysia, between English and Malay (or other languages) is known as Bahasa Rojak, though it is commonly discouraged. In addition, due to the historical signifance of Islam in Malay culture, many learn tend to learn and try Arabic as a second language, particularily those in Singapore.\n\nArchitecture\n\nTraditional Malay architecture is built on wood. Malay-style houses are known as kampongs or kampung in\n\nIndonesian. The word can also refer to the slums in Indonesia and Malaysia. Kampongs are built on stilts to resist flooding. Kampongs resemble and reflect the common wood architectures in Southeast Asia, similar houses ar\n\ne built by the Dayak, Batak, Javanese, Minangkabau and Toraja people of Indonesia, and\n\nthe Muslim groups in the southern Philippines and Sabah in Malaysia.[28] Historically, Malay architecture has been influenced by the major religions that have thrived in the Malay Peninsula and the Malay Archipelago, including Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam. Because Malays are devout Muslims, they have become assimilated into mainstream Islamic culture. Modern-day mosques in Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei are built according to mainstream Islamic architecture, which is mainly influenced by Indo-Islamic architecture. These include typical elements of a mosque; a dome, a mineret and everything else of Arab, Persian or Indian influence. The largest mosque in Southeast Asia is located in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta. There are Malays who want to stick to traditional culture, Malay-style mosques do exist in Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\nCuisine\n\nMalay cuisine is a distinct type of Asian cuisine and also depends on the region itself. The biggest differences can be found between Singaporean Malay, Thai Malay and Indonesian\n\nMalay culinary traditions. Generally, Malay cuisine also contains a mix of Indian and Arab influence with some hints of Chinese - especially in Singapore and Thailand. Common meats include chicken and beef; since Malays are a maritime ethnic group, seafoods are also predominant in Malay cuisine. Staple grains include rice. Common spices and ingredients are nutmeg (Indonesian mostly), chillies, curry, coriander, lemon grass and coconut milk. The use of curry was brought over by Indian traders and missionaries. Satay (Malay for saute) is a grilled and marinated food made with skewering meats, seafoods or vegetables. Satay is usually dipped in a sweet, spice and/or sour sauce. Satay is not necessarily a \"Malay dish\", but a popular food in Malay-speaking countries, even non-Malay countries like Thailand; despite having a large Malay population in the south. Rice is served with every meal. Any dish that\n\nstart with the word nesi or nasi mean that the dish is being served with rice, since the word nesi itself literally means rice. A typical rice dish would be nesi lemak. An even more popular rice dish is nesi biryani, which is a spicy rice dish originated from Persia and South Asia, brought over by Indian merchants and missionaries. Rendang is a spicy beef curry dish from the neighboring Minangkabau people in Sumatra. Because Indonesian Malays were also native to Sumatra, the rendang dish also became popular with Indonesian Malays; the dish aslo also spread up north to the Malay communities of Malaysia where it is most popular and the Muslim regions of the southern Philippines where it is served on big occasions. Murtabak is a folded food that resembles pancakes, brought over by Arab traders from Saudi Arabia. The fillings for murtabak can vary from sweet pastes to meats and entrée foods and is wrapped in banana leaves, a tradition common in all\n\nSoutheast Asian cuisines. Coconut milk is typically used for sauces, such as satay sauce. Indonesian Malay cuisine contains more more distinct spices such as nutmeg and spices more native to Indonesia. Singaporean and Thai Malay cuisine contain a lot of Chinese influence. The Malay cuisines of Malaysia and Brunei are more strictly influenced by Arab, Islamic and indigenous influences. Islamic culinary and ethical laws, known as Halal ( : حلال) is very predominant in Malay culinary traditions. Malays practice the act of purity which includes not eating anything that is filthy or processed unless it is the only available food for a heavily sick or dying person. Pork and alcohol are always absent from any Malay meal, again; unless a sick or dying person can only consume pork. In Brunei, alcohol is prohibited from public sales, however overseas alcohol sales is permitted for non-Muslims. Many restaurants that are owned by Muslim families recieve Halal certifications. Malays barely use utensils, they use their right hands for eating. This practice can be seen with other ethnic groups of southern Asia, Muslim or non-Muslim. Many Malays do eat on tables, but those who are devout Muslims take part in the traditional Sunnah ( : سنة) and eat cross-legged on the floor.\n\nNotable Malays or People of Malay Origin\n\nParameswara A Hindu prince from modern-day Singapore, converted to Islam and found the Sultanate of Malacca, he was also the last king of Singapura who ruled from 1389 to 1398.
