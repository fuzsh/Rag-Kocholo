        "text": "This thesis seeks to examine the practical impetus of the symphonia between the Church and Empire in the truest example yet of a Monarchic/Autocratic Theocracy that was Holy Rus’, namely, the Anointing of the Tsar at his Coronation by God in His Church. We primarily aim to highlight the ontological status of anointing as making the Tsar fit for his high ministry as great king and steward, particularly as it is manifest in Tsar-Martyr Nicholas II. We find in particular the neptic disposition of Nicholas II as informed by the early imperial ethos and ecclesial unity with Byzantium to reveal a pastoral character exemplary of the eternal podvig of the incorruptible Church. Tracing a path out of the late imperial period in Nicholas’ embrace of the awesome responsibility and accountability to God, we map a waypoint from the imperial rite of anointing to the limits of full and obedient reception of the will of God in the person of Tsar Nicholas II. We discover nothing less than a personal exemplarity to be emulated by any pious and right-believing king. With an eye toward critical historical sources, Church Typicon, as well as personal correspondence and archival documents, the inquiry unearths something of a manual for a passion-bearing approach to life and salvation at the behest of the Christian Monarchy.\n\nThis study charts the changing understanding of divine obligations by people in Russian history. It does so in the form of four snapshots, each of which analyses primary literature in a different period of Russian history: The Kievan Rus`, the period of schism (Raskol) in the Tsardom of Russia, the modernising period of Peter the Great, and finally the Enlightenment period. Through discursive analysis of the key terms associated with divine obligations — zakon, vera, and religiia — it illustrates how the medieval notions of zakon and vera gave way to religiia, a term imported to Russian from Western Europe by Peter the Great’s associate Boris Kurakin, and which essentially designated religion in its modern secular conception as an inner persuasion.\n\nOver forty years ago Nicolas Zernov, himself a product of the religious revival of the Russian emigration, produced a still important overview of its personalities and accomplishments. He called it a renaissance, and this it truly was - a wave that rose and broke over several generations, bringing theological creativity of diverse kinds, liturgical renewal and a profound rediscovery of the Church and Christian life. Yet this renaissance was anything but a purely internal event, for it was expressed in the desire to be engaged with the culture and society of the time, and in the commitment to seek for unity in the Church. The Russians; discovery of so many other brothers and sisters in the Lord from the Western Churches was one of the main impulses for this ecumenical dimension. It has been customary to connect the work of the thinkers of this renewal with their enforced flight from the Russian revolution and their subsequent encounter with the Catholic and Protestant clergy and laity who welcomed them. However, this overlooks the reality that many were already producing a renewal of religious thought and churchly practice before the revolution. In the nineteenth century, thinkers such as Khomiakov, Metropolitan St Filaret (Drozhdov) of Moscow, Soloviev and Bukharev had begun to write about the conciliar or ;sobornal nature of the Church, to probe the meaning of God's presence in the world in the Incarnation - the humanity of God; ( Bogochelovechestvo ) and to argue for dialogue between the Church and modern culture."
