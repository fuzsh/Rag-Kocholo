        "text": "Chapter 24\n\nA King Entirely Beloved\n\n“When the abominable Kazan shall have disappeared, it shall be easier for us to oppose other enemies since we shall become formidable on this account.”\n\n-\n\nMaximus the Greek’s Epistle to Vasily III, 1521\n\nThe king, while he firmly holds off the cloud of war, sustains all,\n\nAnd exhorts them with a word, and holds back those who flee.\n\n-\n\nEtienne Dolet, 1539​\n\nWhen the Marquess of Pescara and the Duke of Bourbon learned of Francis’ invasion of Italy, they jumped at the chance to finally cast the French back across the Alps. Having spent Christmas fruitlessly besieging Genoa (which was resupplied from Marseille thanks to Andrea Doria’s galleys), both commanders feared that they might be caught between the anvil of the Genovese capital and the hammer of the Valois relief force. As such, Pescara resolved to leave a small contingent behind to maintain the siege camp, while the lion’s share of the Imperial army marched West to intercept Francis’ host. If the French were decisively beaten in the field, the Marquess surmised, Genoa would quickly realise the futility of continuing to resist. Thereby Charles would become the undisputed master of all of Italy East of Piemonte.\n\nMarching along the Ligurian Riviera, the Valois forces made good progress, before intercepting the first Imperial outriders close to the village of Sciarborasca. Both sides were eager for a fight; the Habsburg commanders being especially keen to seek battle, fearing, as they were, the possibility of Doria sallying the Genovese garrison forth to take them in the rear. Francis for his part, also hoped to set events in motion by winning an overwhelming victory, planning to seize not only Milan, but Naples as well[1]. As dawn broke on the 6th of February 1524, the two hosts (each consisting of some 30.000 troops) drew up for battle. Foregoing his usual caution, Pescara wasted little time in deployed his corps of Spaniard and Italian mixed infantry (arranged in the tercio formation) and began to march on the French. Advancing behind a screen of light cavalry, the Marquess hoped to provoke Francis into leading his heavy cavalry against the Imperial outriders. The French gendarmes would then in turn be locked down by the tercios, whilst Terranova’s ordnance, from an advantageous position on a ridge overlooking the field, would spray the Valois infantry.\n\nIt speaks to Pescara’s credit that Francis did exactly as his enemy expected. Under the cover of a short artillery bombardment, the compagnies d'ordonnance rushed forth with the king at the helm. However, the Imperial artillery train had great difficulties scaling the ridge and were as such not positioned in time to deter Anne de Montmorency and Henry II of Navarre from bringing their divisions in to support Francis. Nevertheless, the French heavy cavalry was mercilessly pounded by the Imperial pike and shot formation and things only deteriorated further, when the Duke of Bourbon brought his own gendarmes into the fray. Francis himself suffered a wound to the head in the melee and, to his great chagrin, was forced to fall back in front of Bourbon’s advancing retainers. In the piqued words of a contemporary chronicler, “... Gallic courage fell to Gallic courage.”[2]\n\nThe extraordinarily swift charge of the Swiss and German infantry, however, cast the allies back and steadied the Valois line long enough for the King to disentangle himself from the slaughter. Still, the French gendarmerie did not entirely live up to their ancient reputation: casualties were high with many prominent nobles (including Christian III of Holstein) falling to the Spaniard bullets, while the Seigneur de Bayard was grievously wounded. It was only the aid afforded them by the pikemen and arquebusiers bolstering the cavalry’s ranks that Pescara’s position began to falter. Matters were not improved for the Imperials when the French artillery under Lautrec’s deputy Gaillon de Genouillac[3] began to target Frundsberg’s reserves with such accuracy that “... every volley carried away a file.”[4]\n\nCursing Terranova’s apparent inability to counter the French guns, Georg von Frundsberg resolved to seek shelter by engaging his men in the the fighting. Along the entire front, a furious infantry engagement soon broke out; the Black Bands of German Landsknechte on the French right making good progress against the exposed flanks of Bourbon’s retainers. The Imperial cavalry withdrew, rallied, and counter-charged, leading to the death of the French commander, Francis of Lorraine. For several hours the battle hung in the balance.\n\nThe Duke of Bourbon leads his knights at Sciarborasca. Detail from an Italian painting of the eponymous battle. Oil on wood, 1525 by an unknown artist.[5] ​\n\nMuch has been written about Antonio de Leyva, Duke of Terranova, and his importance for the outcome at Sciarborasca. It is indisputable that most contemporary sources place the blame for failing to deploy the Imperial artillery squarely on his shoulders. It is also generally acknowledged that this gave the French ordnance crucial fire superiority in the early stages of the battle. Yet the greatest fault, modern as well as contemporary writers attach to the Duke, is the fact that he wasn’t even present, when the Imperial cannons finally were in position. Suffering heavily from gout[6] Terranova had transferred command to his deputy, Ferrando Castriota, Marquess of Sant’Angelo, just as the battle was about to begin; leaving the allied artillery without a seasoned commander. Castriota was by all accounts not an unskilled soldier, but he made an extremely costly mistake by detaching a large part of his Biscayan infantry to attack the exposed French left-wing (a move Frundsberg could have been expected to conduct anyways).\n\nA lack of infantry cover would normally not have been disastrous, given the battle’s hitherto disposition, but unbeknownst to Sant’Angelo, not all of the Valois host had yet reached the field. Thomas de Foix, Lord of Lescun, had been absent from the field for the better part of the morning, hoping to screen the French left from potential flanking attacks. When Lescun finally realised that battle had been joined in earnest, his cavalry swung back South, emerging at the top of the ridge just as the Imperial batteries were being readied to fire. Setting upon Castriato with great savagery, the French quickly overran the guns and dispersed the Imperial troops accompanying them, who fled down the ridge they had spent the better part of the morning scaling. Lescun now commanded the high-ground overlooking the allied right flank and had a whole artillery train ready to use. Sending despatches to his brother Lautrec and the Swiss reserves under de la Trémoille for reinforcements, he began to fire on the Imperial camp, sending shockwaves of confusion through Pescara’s ranks.\n\nLouis II de la Trémoille immediately saw the advantage secured by Lescun’s reappearance and swiftly marched the last French reserves up the ridge. They arrived just in time to intercept von Frundsberg’s remaining Landsknechte, shielding Lescun’s position. In the centre, the Imperial line began to waver under the combined fire from de Genouillac and de Foix’s batteries and an invigorated push from the French infantry. A Spanish chronicle lamented the casualties suffered by the tercios, stating that “... they died with great consistency and fell as if against the Moors.”[7] However, the French too had taken heavy casualties and were unable to fully press their advantage. Charles III de Bourbon was the first to recognise the hopelessness of the Imperial position and, without consulting Captain General d'Ávalos, directed his section of the frontline to begin a fighting retreat. When Pescara realized Bourbon’s intentions, he angrily threw down his marshal’s baton and ordered the remaining units to follow suit. The Marquess would, to the end of his days, insist that it was this decision that cost the emperor the day. Had the Duke not been such a coward, the French centre would have broken and Francis surely either captured or killed. Bourbon, conversely, initially blamed de Leyva and, ultimately, Pescara himself for the defeat.\n\nThe Battle of Sciarborasca deeply weakened the Imperial position in Italy, leaving the Padan Plain open to French offensives. Milan would soon find itself once more under Valois control while the fragile net of alliances between the various Italian principalities and republics dissolved into a state of flux.​\n\nAlthough Sciarborasca was a devastating blow for the Imperials, the French victory was hard won and paid for in much blood. The gendarmes had been gutted in the melee, whilst the king’s French and German guards were mauled badly by Pescara’s mixed formations of pike and shot. While the allied forces withdrew towards Alessandria in some good order, Francis’ army limbered on to Genoa where his puppet doge Ottaviano Fregoso apprehensively welcomed the battered Valois troops. The French had suffered some 7000 casualties, the Imperials over 9000. Furthermore, little by little, the German and Swiss condottieri remaining in d'Ávalos’ service began to disperse for lack of funds, leaving the Captain General with only a small corps of Spanish and Italian troops, which proved unable to resist the subsequent French offensive. As such, by the end of April 1524, Francis had seized all of the Duchy of Milan, save for the city of Milan itself, Piacenza and the border fortresses of Parma and Fornovo.\n\nThe ascendancy of France and her Italian vassals threw the League of Windsor into a state of confusion, partly fostered by the inability of its leading members to coordinate. Henry VIII was far too preoccupied with casting the Scots back across the Tweed to be of any assistance to the Emperor, while Charles V was deeply distrustful of Henry’s inability to bring Albany to heel. Furthermore, Charles was woefully low on funds and now insisted that Francesco II Sforza pay the fee of 700.000 ducats for his investiture with the Duchy of Milan up-front[8]. Although he indignantly argued that Francis was counting his Milanese chickens before they had hatched, Sforza eventually conceded and began to scrape together the funds, albeit grudgingly. This caused a rift between Charles and the exiled Duke, with the latter increasingly looking elsewhere for support in reclaiming his birthright.\n\nBy way of his chief lieutenant, Girolamo Morone, Francesco reached out to Pope Clement VII as well as the governments of Florence, Lucca and Siena, hoping to establish an Italian League that could oppose both the Emperor and Francis. Only Alfonso I d’Este, Duke of Ferrara and Modena, refused to be involved, instead renewing his alliance with Francis and paying his way into the king’s grace by way of supplies and munitions. With Clement’s blessing, Morone even approached Pescara and offered him the crown of Naples in exchange of leading the League’s troops[9]. Disheartened at the lack of support from the Emperor, and depressed at Bourbon’s slandering, the Marquess was sorely tempted. Yet, when Morone arrived with Clement’s proposition, Pescara could not bring himself to betray his liege and clasped Sforza’s lieutenant in irons. Under harsh interrogation, Morone implicated his master directly in the conspiracy, prompting Charles to arrest Francesco in Vienna and seize the Duchy of Milan for himself (as well as the investiture fee).\n\nTo Francis, the breach in the Habsburg-Sforza alliance provided a golden opportunity to open a second front against the Emperor. By way of Antonio Rincon, the French redoubled their efforts at establishing a rapprochement with King Sigismund of Poland, whose wife Bona Sforza, hoped to advance her own claim to Milan. Sigismund was deeply concerned at the growing relations between Charles V and the Grand Duchy of Muscovy, fearing that the Emperor might join forces with Vasily III when the peace treaty with Lithuania expired in 1527[10]. Giving vague assurances as to the future of Milan, Rincon talked Bona Sforza into persuading Sigismund to strike at the Habsburg heartlands in Austria. The Emperor’s position was precarious, they argued, and the truce with Russia gave Krakow a window of opportunity to strangle the Habsburg-Muscovy alliance in the cradle by knocking Charles V out of the equation. Furthermore, reports from the East indicated that Vasily already had more than enough on his plate for the time being.\n\nIlluminations from the Nikon Chronicle, second half of the 16th century. On the left, Tatar raiders slaughter Russian settlers, while Vasily III is informed of the attack in the background. In the centre, the Grand Duke and his boyars make preparations for a counter attack, depicted in the last illumination[11]. The Grand Duchy of Muscovy of the 1520s was engaged in an almost unending series of raids and counter raids with the Golden Horde’s successor states and enjoyed dismal relations with Poland-Lithuania and the Ottoman Empire. As such, the arrival of the Sture envoy Peder Jakobsson at the Muscovite court in early 1523 offered several possibilities for Vasily III to improve his diplomatic situation, although not necessarily to the benefit of Lady Kristina. ​\n\nWhen Peder Jakobsson arrived in Moscow in February-March 1523, the Sture position was perilous, tendering disastrous. Lady Kristina’s embassy to Krakow had resulted in little but polite statements of concern for the welfare of the Swedish realm as Sigismund was unwilling to commit before the Italian situation had been clarified. As such, Vasily III represented the last hope of foreign relief the Finnish rebels could hope for. The Grand Duke, however, was extremely apprehensive about jeopardizing the “... lasting and friendly union”[12] which had been established between his father and Hans I in 1493. Indeed, Russian troops had invaded Finland two years later to support the Danish king in his feud against Sten Sture the Elder. Furthermore, the two realms enjoyed extensive trade relations with Danish merchants being by far the single-most favoured group of foreign traders in Russia[13].\n\nA far more pressing matter of foreign policy also gave Vasily grounds to pause. The Crimean Khan Mehmed Giray had aspired to unite the Tatar Khanates under his rule, placing his brother Sahib on the throne of Kazan and eliciting fealty from the diverse steppe clans of the Nogai Horde. Having seized Astrakhan in early 1523, Giray seemed on the brink of accomplishing his dream. With Ottoman backing, the united Khanates would have proven a formidable threat to Russia’s South-eastern border, but worried of his growing power, a pair of Nogai beys assassinated Giray and his first-born son outside the walls of Astrakhan in April that same year. Without Mehmed’s unifying persona, the various Tatar Khanates descended into chaos and civil war, removing the otherwise very plausible Steppe threat to Vasily’s realm for the time being[14].\n\nUnaware of his brother’s murder, Sahib Giray had begun to prepare his Khanate for war with the Muscovites. In the Spring of 1523, Giray orchestrated an anti-Russian pogrom at the Kazan Fair[15], in the course of which many Russian merchants and dignitaries were slain - the most prominent being Vasily Podiegin, the Grand Duke’s ambassador. When Vasily was told that Giray had \"... broken his oath and inflicted great dishonor and abuse on the envoy of the Grand Duke\"[16] he immediately began preparations for an attack on the Tartar stronghold and barred his merchants from attending the Kazan Fair, effectively putting the Khanate under economic blockade.\n\nWhen Peder Jakobsson finally gained an audience with Vasily, the Grand Duke was thus not exactly thrilled about being invariably dragged into a conflict on his Western border, least of all against a longtime ally, for the sake of some rebellious Swedes. Nevertheless, Vasily assured Jakobsson that he would protect the Sture faction against Christian II, if the borders of the 1323 Nöteborg Treaty was accepted by Lady Kristina (which would have seen the fortress of Olofsborg surrendered to Russia).\n\nWith a heavy heart, Jakobsson conceded the point and wrote to Åbo that he would soon arrive with a sizeable Muscovite host to “... protect the realm of Sweden in Finland from the Danes’ tyranny and oppression.” However, it was only when news of a Nogai invasion of the Crimea[17] reached Moscow, that Vasily set his plans in motion. An army of 20.000 troops was detached from the Pomestye Spring Mustering and placed under the command of the governor of Novgorod, Prince Vasily Shuysky ‘Nemoy’ (meaning ‘The Mute’ on account of his taciturn personality). By late May, the host had crossed the Russo-Finnish border, being trailed by another column under Nemoy’s brother Ivan, governor of Pskov, which contained the formidable Muscovite artillery train.\n\nUpon reaching Viborg, the castellan of Karelen Fief, Måns Gren, invited Prince Shuysky (who had participated in the unsuccessful siege of the very same castle in 1495) and other Russian commanders to attend a feast to celebrate the new alliance. However, when the Muscovite party appeared at the castle gates, they were more numerous and better armed than agreed upon and suddenly sat upon the Swedes, seizing the gate house and arrested Jakobsson and Gren. A contemporary Russian chronicler reported that after less than an hour of resistance “... the Swedes, in view of their exhaustion, submitted to the voivode of the Grand Duke and concluded a truce wholly in accordance with the will of the Sovereign.”[18] Thanks to guile and the utmost secrecy, one of the strongest fortresses in Finland had fallen into Vasily’s lap at little to no cost. Confused and enraged at the betrayal, Måns Gren demanded an explanation to which, Shuysky briskly replied that he was simply “... acting under the orders of his sovereign in defending his brother, the King of Denmark’s fief of Finland from treason and sedition.” Vasily’s invasion thus proceeded under an official pennant of aiding his ally Christian II, but an underlying ambition was also restoring Russian authority over the disputed Finnish provinces in Karelia and Österbotten. With Viborg secured, the Muscovites divided their forces into two columns; one marching North to seize Olofsborg while another advanced West towards the main Sture stronghold of Åbo. By July, Shuysky was at the gates of Borgå, where his brother soon joined him with the Muscovite ordnance.\n\nRussia and Eastern Europe in 1524. Vasily III’s invasion of Finland was a cunning stroke of subterfuge, which advanced Russian claims under the guise of aiding the Oldenburg monarchy put down the Sture rebellion. It also secured the Grand Duchy’s Western flank in preparation of the much more important showdown with Sahib Giray’s Khanate of Kazan. Full version can be found here.​\n\nCoupled with the news of the Treaty of Hamburg, Prince Shuysky’s success eviscerated the last remaining Sture resistance. At Kastelholm, the viceregal castellan was even shocked to receive delegates from Österbotten, indignantly asking him why he had not yet crossed the sea to accept their fealty. Christian II was for his part highly satisfied with Vasily’s actions. Indeed, as he wrote Queen Elisabeth he “... was most joyous to be entirely beloved in friendship and treaty with not one, but two emperors.”[19] However, the King didn’t presume to believe that the Grand Duke was aiding him for the sake of his bright eyes only and quickly ordered Søren Norby to ferry a couple of German Fähnleins to Finland aboard the Oldenburg Navy Royal to shore up his own position.\n\nWhen the Admiral in the Eastern Sea dropped anchor off Åbo, the city’s inhabitants practically begged him to accept their surrender and, although commanded by Christian II to treat the rebel cities very sternly, Norby graciously offered the garrison amnesty if it laid down its arms. The venerable bishop of Åbo, Arvid Kuck, was, however, nowhere to be seen. Alongside Lady Kristina and a troop of her most ardent supporters, the bishop had fled Finland for Danzig before the Danes and Russians could link arms. On September 7th, Norby’s small army reached the Muscovite camp at Borgå, besieged by the joint forces of the two Shuysky brothers. Accepting the town’s surrender in the King’s name, Norby tried in vain to get the Russians to vacate Viborg, which they politely refused to do until the border disputes in Karelia and Finland had been settled. Vasily III had no intention of keeping Viborg as it would certainly have created a lasting rift between himself and the Oldenburg conglomerate state, but the city was a valuable bargaining chip for mercantile concessions and monetary aid in his planned conquest of Kazan. This, however, Norby wasn't commissioned to authorise, but he reassured the Russian generals that his master was on his way to Sweden, where he planned on finally setting that realm’s affairs in proper order after the failed Sture-Vasa rebellion. Consequently, Viborg remained under de facto Muscovite control while the two sides prepared for a meeting in Stockholm to negotiate the future of the Oldenburg-Rurikid alliance.\n\nWhile Vasily Shuysky Nemoy had been busy in Finland, a second Russian army of some 15.000 troops under Prince Ivan Belsky[20] had begun preliminary operations on the Tatar side of the Russo-Kazan border. Acting nominally in the name of Khan Şahğäli[21], who had been deposed from the Kazanian throne in 1521, Belsky began the construction of a fortified settlement on Tatar territory, naming it Vasilsursk in honour of the Grand Duke. In the Spring of 1524, Vasily decided to strike the final blow against the Tatars, urged by the Metropolitan Daniil to outright annex the Khanate for the glory of the Orthodox faith. Indeed, Maximus the Greek encouraged Vasily to seize the “... accursed city of Kazan which is harboring a dragon” and “... be exalted by holy zeal and avenge the blood of our many Orthodox brethren who were killed there.”[22]\n\nSahib Giray was not oblivious to the growing Russian threat, but his repeated calls for guns, arquebuses and Janissaries from the Crimea went completely unheeded. In April 1524, Vasily Shuysky and Ivan Belsky led a 30.000 strong Muscovite army forth from Vasilsursk. Sweeping aside all opposition, the two princes soon reached the walls of Kazan which was put under siege by the end of the month[23]. Realising the helplessness of his position, Sahib Giray fled to Constantinople where he swore fealty to Suleiman the Magnificent by proclaiming Kazan a yurt of the Ottoman sultan. In his place, the besieged Kazanians raised up his 13 year old nephew, Safa Giray, but this did nothing but further weaken the resolve of the defenders, despairing at having an untested youth lead them in battle.\n\nOn the 20th of May, the Russian artillery began to smother the Tatar fortifications, breaching the walls after two days of unrepentant bombardment. By the middle of June, Vasily III himself arrived at the siege lines alongside fresh supplies and fresh reinforcements. It was only by July that the Grand Duke felt confident enough to order an all out assault on the city. Leading a contingent of infantry and dismounted cavalry, Prince Shuysky proceeded to scale the breach, defeating a rattled troop of Chuvash, Udmurt and Mordvin horsemen, whose ôglan commanders desperately tried to rally a last line of defence. The citadel, however, refused to yield and withstood the Muscovite troops for almost a fortnight, before a despairing Nogai ički (garrison officer) opened one of the lesser gates. Ivan Belsky then stormed the last remaining Kazanian stronghold, butchered the defenders to a man and seized the young Khan. Safa Giray would eventually be baptised as Safa-Aleksandr and confined to a convent close to Moscow, never again setting eyes on his native land. Vasily granted his victorious army the privilege of three days worth of sacking, tearing down many great mosques and state buildings in the process. A large amount of Christian slaves were also liberated in the process[24], who by all accounts were amongst the most merciless and unforgiving plunderers.\n\nThe conquest of Kazan did not result in immediate pacification of the Tatar Khanate as uprisings would plague the Russian governors for years to come. However, the victory did mark the beginning of the Muscovite state’s transformation into a multinational empire and definitely pushed Moscow into the limelight of Eastern Europe’s ever-changing political landscape.\n\nMiniatures from the Carstvennaja kniga, later part of the 16th Century.

So Vasily definitely could formally be crowned IOTL as well, but chose not to, so there may be some complicated reasons for it (for instance he may have wanted to do so in Kiev and thus waited its capture from GDL).\n\nOf course it is also possible that Vasily simply expected some sort of backlash that ITTL could be avoided because of his renewed popularity.\n\nWill he set aside his first wife who gave him no children\n\nNow, it’s not impossible that ITTL Solomonia Saburova, Vasily's first wife, can become pregnant ITTL: by 1523 she is only 33. IOTL there was a legend that she was pregnant during her divorce in 1526 and gave birth to a son in a monastery.\n\nInterestingly enough this legend seems to have some merit. In 1934 near Solomonia’s tomb in Pokrovsky Monastery there was discovered a tomb with richly decorated child’s garments dated as first half of XVI-century. The tomb didn’t contain any human remains, but fits pretty well to this old legend. Two main versions are that either the child did in fact exist and Solomonia tried to fake its death or that she started the rumor herself out of spite to Vasily.\n\nIt is also known that Ivan IV investigated the matter of his hypothetical elder brother.\n\nIf ITTL Solomonia has a son, this leads to some important butterflies other than the absence of Ivan Grozny.\n\nIOTL there were 2 parties in Russian church: Non-possessors and Josephites. They had several doctrinal differences but the most important one was the subject of large-scale ecclesiastical land-ownership (Non-possessors were against, Josephites were pro). Non-possessors position was obviously much more convenient for the Grand Duke who supported them for most of his reign. Non-possessors, however, condemned Vasily’s divorce of Solomonia, thus fell out of favor in 1526 and in the next following years were largely dispersed.\n\nIf Solomonia has a son and thus the divorce does not happen, Vasily probably keeps his alliance with Non-possessors and begins a major attack on ecclesiastical land ownership and other privileges (tax-free districts in cities, called \"white sloboda\"s, various fiscal immunities called \"tarkhans\" etc), thus potentially increasing the state income by a substantial margin.\n\nAfter all, that is what all other Renaissance rulers do, so Vasily probably doesn’t want to be a white crow)\n\nIf however Solomania remains barren ITTL, Vasily will probably be able to annul his marriage faster and with less internal backlash than IOTL because of his higher personal prestige. IOTL he completed his divorce in the end of 1525, so ITTL he may be able to do it soon after the capture of Kazan, perhaps in the winter 1524-1525.\n\nElena Glinskaya, how IOTL became his wife was extremly beautiful, so she is still a strong candidate.\n\nOf course, If Vasily has an opportunity to get a royal bride from Europe, he will likely take it (in fact, IOTL in 1500 he asked for the hand of Christian’s sister Elizabeth, but his envoys arrived when she was already married to the Elector of Brandenburg).\n\nUnfortunately, Christian II has no available brides of marriageable age and I think the only ones kind of free of Habsburgs are Charles younger sisters Catherine (who IOTL became queen of Portugal in the beginning of 1525) and Eleanor (who in 1524 is a widow, but engaged to Charles Bourbon). Both variants are probably possible, but Charles needs to prefer alliance with Russia to Portugal or to allegiance of Charles Bourbon.\n\nHere are some possible economic consequences of Russia's earlier conquest of Kazan and continuing alliance with Christian:\n\n1. An important but long-term economic consequence is that IOTL after the failure to capture Kazan Vasily prohibited Russian merchants to attend Kazan fair (as @Milites mentioned the war began with mass murder of Russian merchants, which also happend in the past conflicts). This hurt Kazan somewhat, but Russia also suffered some economic setbacks because of it (merchants had to buy goods that were unavailable in Russia not directly but via foreign proxies). IOTL Russian merchants began to conduct fair in Nizhny Novgorod that eventually became the largest one in the country (the famous Makaryev Fair). ITTL the fair probably reopens in Kazan, Russian merchants don’t lose their money in 1520-1530s, Kazan will be a bigger trade hub, eventually probably leading to more active russification of the city, while Nizhny Novgorod is less developed than IOTL.\n\n2. IOTL almost immediately after the conquest of Kazan Russia started aconstruction of Great Abatis Line: a system of fortifications to the south of Oka that protected southern border of Russia from Crimean raids. IOTL it was started in mid 1550s and completed by 1566. Here is an OTL map of the line, here is another one.\n\nITTL the Great Abatis Line may be started in late 1520s-1530s (especially if there is no war against Lithuania, but probably it will be started in any case). IOTL it protected Russian southern frontier from nomad raids and led to a rapid settlement of steppes.\n\nHowever, IOTL it came a little too late: in 1560-s the second phase of Little Ice Period started, average temperature went down and thus large territory in Northern Russia in particular became agriculturally non-viable. This led to a sort of Malthusian trap (i. e. country’s agriculture could no longer support its population) and Russia experienced a series of hungers and population loss, eventually leading to Time of Troubles (that of course had other reasons like losses of Livonian War and a dynastic crisis; however in the absence of agrarian overpopulation these other factors may have caused much, much less damage).\n\nITTL if the Great Abatis line is finished in 1530s, by 1560s Russian settlement of Steppes will already be very active (IOTL a very large percentage of Southern Russia cities are founded in 1570-1590s). Given that these steppes lands are extremely fertile, ITTL Russia may avoid a Malthusian trap and thus the massive population loss of Time of Troubles.\n\n3. IOTL 1510s-1530s is one of the few periods in Russian history when Russian merchants actively attempted to engage in Baltic maritime trade. Russian wealthy merchants (mostly based in Novgorod, such as Tarakanov, Syrkov, Salarev, Bortvinov families) sent dozens of ships per year to Lübeck, Copenhagen and even Antwerp. IOTL privateers from Danzig, assisted by Reval and Swedish ones managed to more or less destroy this trade.\n\nSources: S. Bodniak (Żołnierze morscy Zygmunta Augusta (1517-1522))\n\nW. Odyniec (Sprawy morskie I Rzeczypospolitej, Polskie dominium maris Baltici)\n\nITTL it looks like Russia keeps its alliance with Christian with whom it has lucrative trade treaties by which Russian merchants were offered a merchant quarter in Copenhagen in 1517 as well as other privileges(and Danish in Novgorod and Ivangorod as well as other benefits). If this is the case, I don’t think Christian will look too kindly on privateers harassing the merchants of his ally sailing to Copenhagen. Thus unlike OTL Russian maritime traders will have some protection by Danish fleet and thus may be able to continue their ventures.\n\nWhile this will not give Russia a powerful navy, having an active merchant marine (even a relatively modest one) on Baltic will be extremely important for future Russian naval development: Russian wharfs will be building ships, there will be a pool of experienced sailors, future captains will be able to get a seafaring experience. Thus, when Russia finally decides to establish a navy, its starting position will be much better than IOTL.\n\n4. Russian conquest of Kazan probably doesn’t affect Sibir Khanate directly: it is simply to far away. But Russian’s settlement of Urals (upper Kama and Ufa basins) is sped up by 30 years.\n\nSo when in mid 1550-s khan Yadegar asks for Russian support against rival claimant Kuchum (who IOTL has defeated him and became the last independent khan of Sibir) and offers to recognize the suzerainship of Moscow, Russia is actually able to help him in a meaningful way. So by late 1550s some part of Sibir khanate is ruled by Yadegar as a Russian vassal while other parts (Kuchum’s domain) are probably annexed directly. Thus the road to settle Siberia is open and the process begins 30 year earlier than IOTL.\n\nWhile I personally don’t see much differences in the following conquest and settlement of Siberia, having a 30 years early head start can be extremely important. IOTL when Russians reached Amur in 1650s and attempted to subdue local tribes, Qing empire interfered and in a series of border wars with Russia, made it to abandon Amur.\n\nITTL Russians can potentially reach Amur in 1620s, when Qing are busy conquering Ming.\n\nSo, Russians may be able to claim the entire Amur northern bank (and perhaps even some parts of OTL Heilongjiang province).\n\nNow, Qing can of course deploy much larger forces to Amur than Russia and thus destroy Russian settlements if the wish to do so. However IOTL the main motivation of Qing actions on Amur seemed to be prestige (with Russians attacking Qing formal vassals), not desire to keep lands (the lands remained virtually unsettled all the way to XIX century).\n\nThus ITTL when the Qing conquest of China ends, Russian presence on Amur will already be fait accompli for 20 years and thus Qing may choose not to act against them.\n\nWhile this is by no means guaranteed, if Russia manages to settle Amur valley in XVII century, it gains an agricultural land that will be able to supply the whole Eastern Siberia with grain (IOTL the grain was transported from Western Siberian Plain, was extremely expensive and in demand, and this slowed down the development of Russian Far East by great margin). Thus Russian presence in Far East and Northern Pacific (and possibly North-Western America) can potentially be much stronger ITTL.\n\nNow, all these consequences while IMHO plausible can of course be avoided ITTL. They are also very long-term and (probably) out of time scope of this brilliant TL. However, I hope they demonstrate that even relatively minor changes can lead to extremely long-reaching effects down the road.\n\nSo Kazan is conquered almost 30 years early, and Russia makes at least some gains in Finland. Will Vasily III take the step of declaring himself Tsar? Will he set aside his first wife who gave him no children and marry someone from the Habsburg-Oldenburg alliance rather than his OTL second wife (in either case butterflying Ivan the Terrible)?\n\nI'm not quite sure whether or not Vasily claims formally claims the title of Tsar. If, as Shnurre mentioned, his plan was to be coronated in Kiev, then that city would have to fall first. But in OTL, the Kazanian rebellions lasted several years, which might put a damper on the Grand Duke's appetite for Westwards expansion.\n\nAnd I see the butterflies have also hit the Italian wars -- with the Imperial commanders feuding and France on the ascent, will this lead to a French-backed Yorkist restoration as has been hinted before? In any case, France could end up with its own version of the late Spanish Netherlands -- and I'm sure the Papacy doesn't want the French on their doorstep any more than they wanted the empire, especially considering the history of Avignon.\n\nMy current reading of the situation is that Francis would pause further incursions whilst stabilising his position in Milan/driving the last Imperial troops out of the Duchy. He also needs some kind of accommodation with the Pope (maybe no sack of Rome, or one perpetrated by the French?). Clement in OTL was very wary of allowing either of the two blocks too much influence on the peninsular - as evident in the schemes surrounding the proposed Italian League\n\nHowever, Francis request may have been a pretext, and thus Suleiman may invade Hungary even without it. In this case we may see a battle of Mohacs with some minor butterflies. In this case John Zapolya becomes an important player.\n\nI think Suleiman wanted to invade Hungary no matter what. The French alliance was just a convenient pretext, IMHO. However, there's the possibility that Louis II gets caught between advancing Polish and Ottoman armies. Maybe Hungary even gets split three-ways this time around..\n\n2. Albert of Prussia has lost the war against Poland in 1519-1521 IOTL and having signed a 4-year truce, he spent several years trying in vain to acquire HRE support against Sigismund. During his journey in HRE he met Luther who gave him an idea to convert to Protestantism, secularize the Order and become a Duke of Prussia. While all went well for Albert, this looks like a rather desperate attempt. ITTL Albert, who had an cordial relations with both Vasily and especially Christian II may hope for support of Denmark and later Vasily against Sigismund. He is also likely to get HRE support after 1524 (Charles needs any ally against Franco-Polish alliance). So ITTL Albert may be a firm member of HRE-Denmark-Russia block and thus the secularization of Teutonic Order may be avoided\n\nMaybe Albert offers his fealty to Christian II instead? Does anyone know if there's precedent for Catholic ecclesiastical states secularizing?\n\nIn my opinion Russia and Denmark will likely start a war against Poland and Lithuania in late 1520s (after Russo-Lithuanian truce expires) even if the Emperor makes peace with France before that: even if Charles and Francis are unable to participate directly their proxy war undoubtably continues (and of course if they don’t have truce yet this war is even more likely)\n\nThe thing is, Denmark doesn't have any pretext for war with Poland (other than vague treaties with Russia, but that might be altered when Christian II arrives in Stockholm to negotiate with the Grand Duke over the return of Viborg). The only gain I could see for Christian was to knock the Baltic Hanseatic cities around, but that seems a bit pointless after what's already transpired with Lübeck.\n\nIf however Solomania remains barren ITTL, Vasily will probably be able to annul his marriage faster and with less internal backlash than IOTL because of his higher personal prestige. IOTL he completed his divorce in the end of 1525, so ITTL he may be able to do it soon after the capture of Kazan, perhaps in the winter 1524-1525.\n\nElena Glinskaya, how IOTL became his wife was extremly beautiful, so she is still a strong candidate.\n\nOf course, If Vasily has an opportunity to get a royal bride from Europe, he will likely take it (in fact, IOTL in 1500 he asked for the hand of Christian’s sister Elizabeth, but his envoys arrived when she was already married to the Elector of Brandenburg).\n\nUnfortunately, Christian II has no available brides of marriageable age and I think the only ones kind of free of Habsburgs are Charles younger sisters Catherine (who IOTL became queen of Portugal in the beginning of 1525) and Eleanor (who in 1524 is a widow, but engaged to Charles Bourbon). Both variants are probably possible, but Charles needs to prefer alliance with Russia to Portugal or to allegiance of Charles Bourbon.\n\nIt's certainly interesting to ponder how Charles V would react to an Orthodox divorce given his vehement opposition to Henry VIII setting aside Catherine in OTL I'm not too convinced that Vasily would find it easy to get a bride from the Emperor's family.\n\nCatherine at this point is destined to Portugal without any doubt...\n\nI do not believe who Charles would think far away Russia as a good choice for his eldest sister Eleanor for many reason. Right now she is engaged to Bourbon (and in OTL she will be married to Francis I of France) but the most important thing to know is who at the moment Karl is unmarried and Ferdinand childless and if both of them died Burgundy and Spain would be inherited by Eleanor (who has just a daughter by her first husband).\n\nSo, if say both Ferdinand and Charles kicked the bucket in 1524 (after ATL Pavia) and Eleanor actually wed Charles de Bourbon, then he would be king-consort over all of the Habsburg dominions (if confirmed in the role by the many various estates)?\n\nNow, it’s not impossible that ITTL Solomonia Saburova, Vasily's first wife, can become pregnant ITTL: by 1523 she is only 33. IOTL there was a legend that she was pregnant during her divorce in 1526 and gave birth to a son in a monastery.\n\nInterestingly enough this legend seems to have some merit. In 1934 near Solomonia’s tomb in Pokrovsky Monastery there was discovered a tomb with richly decorated child’s garments dated as first half of XVI-century. The tomb didn’t contain any human remains, but fits pretty well to this old legend. Two main versions are that either the child did in fact exist and Solomonia tried to fake its death or that she started the rumor herself out of spite to Vasily.\n\nIt is also known that Ivan IV investigated the matter of his hypothetical elder brother.\n\nITTL his prestige in 1525 is certainly higher than IOTL and Vasily may choose to cement his and his future heir’s position by formally crowning himself a Tsar of all Russia.\n\nI am not entirely convinced he will though: both he and his father has already used the title Tsar and “Sovereign of all Russia” both internally and externally (I quoted earlier that Christian’s diplomat recognized Vasily as «totius Rutzie imperatore»), but were not crowned or anointed. So Vasily definitely could formally be crowned IOTL as well, but chose not to, so there may be some complicated reasons for it (for instance he may have wanted to do so in Kiev and thus waited its capture from GDL).\n\nOf course it is also possible that Vasily simply expected some sort of backlash that ITTL could be avoided because of his renewed popularity.\n\nI think Suleiman wanted to invade Hungary no matter what. The French alliance was just a convenient pretext, IMHO. However, there's the possibility that Louis II gets caught between advancing Polish and Ottoman armies. Maybe Hungary even gets split three-ways this time around..\n\nI have reread the last two chapters of Pal Engel’s book on the history of Medieval Hungary, that describes the situation in the realm prior to Mohacs (I can send pdf of the book upon request in private message). Here is the gist of the relevant chapters (although I recommend reading at least chapter 20 yourselves if you have time):\n\nUnder Vladislaus and Louis the country experience a rapid erosion of royal power. Both had extremely limited influence over the affairs of the realm, which were managed by royal council. 39 major barons each had a place in the council as well as 22 major ecclesiastical prelates (who despite often being of common birth were very much barons in their own right: had personal armies, large land estates and often were able to pass their accumulated wealth and power to their nephews and other relatives), but most decisions were made and implemented by 8-12 holders of chief offices (most often held by clergy). The diet consisting of “Upper House” (barons, prelates and other members of council) and “Lower House” (in theory representing all country nobility but in practice consisting of a few hundred wealthiest nobles that could not claim the baronial title) was the second and third centers of power in the realm that tried to enforce its own agendas.\n\nMembers of “Lower House” were typically connected in some way to a particular baron (up to a point of being a retainer) so depicting the political struggles of the day as barons v. s. other nobles is oversimplification. However, the Upper House seems to be dominated by “pro-council party” while Lower House by “nationalist” (also once again there were of course “pro-council” members of “Lower House” as well as “nationalist” magnates of “Upper House”) and often to chambers issued conflicting articles (e. g. in 1518 first members of “Upper House” in a separate assembly issued several acts strengthening their own power, later to be repealed by two assemblies of “Lower House”).\n\nThe Estates had issued a series of acts limiting the power and rights of other classes: king, magnates, Church, burgers, peasants and Cumans. King had to abandon mercenary army of previous reigns (to be replaced by private armies of magnates and militia of counties), was forced to leave up to 50 percent of tax in the hands of landowners (i. e. nobility) which drained royal treasury and led to pawning various incomes and holdings to barons, was prohibited to grant estates to foreigners and take council with them etc.\n\nMagnates were forced to accept noble jurors into the royal council, management of extraordinary tax was taken from royal treasurers (member of royal council) and subjected to elected officers from Estates, counts were prohibited to appoint deputies without consent of local nobility and from making their titles inheritable etc. Burgers (who were disliked by nobility because they had their own laws and were mostly Germans) and Cumans (who previously enjoyed special liberties) had several their important privileges stripped, while peasants suffered the most (they were prohibited to hunt, export cattle, were subjected to new taxes and most importantly prohibited to move from their lord without the meditation of noble magistrates).\n\nThe main ideologist of “nationalists” was István Werbőczy, who codified Hungarian common law and developed an ideology of “Scythian laws” by which all members of nation are free and equal (the peasantry though were considered the descendants of cowards who were stripped of all privileges of “true Scythians”, essentially claiming that nobles had a distinct ancestry and identity) and in particular he did not recognize the authority of barons. He was also a fierce advocate for king of Hungarian birth and after his speech to Estates in 1505 they “made a solemn oath never again to elect a foreign king, and went as far as to condemn to ‘eternal serfdom’ anyone who defied their decision”. John Zapolya (who was the greater landowner of the realm and the object of adoration among the nobility) was the obvious candidate for the crown as early as then. In 1514 he cemented his claim when he crushed the major peasant rebellion (who at first were assembled for Crusade but later were ordered to disperse because of noble pressure).\n\n“Pro-council” party, supported by most barons had in turn tried to promote Habsburg succession with Treaty of Vienna of 1515 (by which Ferdinand became the Louis’s legal heir in case he dies childless) being a major success for them.\n\nIn this particular political landscape I don’t see Sigismund being able to enforce his own claim to the crown in case of Louis death. “Nationalists” (i. e. most lower nobility and several magnate allies of John) will support Zapolya (and in case of his death will turn to some other Hungarian magnate e. g. Péter Perényi, not to foreigner Sigismund), while “pro-council” ones (i. e. most magnates with some part of lower nobility) have already made their stake at Ferdinand.\n\nGiven that Zapolya enjoyed particularly warm relations with Sigismund (the first wife of the later was John sister while the wife of Zapolya was Sigismund’s daughter by Bona Sforza, also IOTL John fled to Poland in 1528 after he was defeated by Ferdinand) so it is much more natural for Sigismund to support John’s claim instead of trying to become a king himself.\n\nFurther examination also reveled that even in the absence of Franco-Ottoman alliance Suleiman invasion will almost surely be not butterflied away. The conflict started in 1520 with Suleiman’s ambassador who offered to prolong the armistice put into chains in Buda (thus creating a diplomatic insult) and although there were no major invasions between 1521 campaign (during which Belgrade fell) and Mohacs, there were continuous actions along the border (e. g. Knin fell to Ottomans in 1522, Ostrovica in 1523, Turnu Severin in 1524 and Jajce relieved in 1525). While ITTL the invasion of may possibly be delayed for a year or two because of butterflies, there is no doubt it will happen in the next following years.\n\nWhat can be butterflied though is the circumstances of Louis death. OTL Mohacs was disastrous for the whole realm, but it hit the magnates particularly hard (with 20 barons out of 39 and 7 bishops out of 13 killed in battle), while John with his personal army was late to the battle (and thus left intact). Thus, the balance of parties in realm shifted greatly in favor of ‘nationalists’. ITTL butterflies may lead to different outcome keeping the balance in place or even shifting it towards ‘pro-council’ party thus making Ferdinand’s starting position much stronger.\n\nMaybe Albert offers his fealty to Christian II instead? Does anyone know if there's precedent for Catholic ecclesiastical states secularizing?\n\nWhile I can’t answer the question directly, I don’t think swearing fealty to Christian requires secularization.\n\nIf we take a look at the closest analogue i. e. Livonian Order in 1550s-1560s, the first two treaties establishing Lithuanian dominance over the Order (Treaty of Pozvol in 1557 and First Treaty of Vilnius in 1559 ) happened while Livonia was still officially Catholic (as well as Masters of Order Johann von Fürstenberg in 1557 and Gotthard Kettler in 1559).\n\nThe latter treaty is probably a better precedent: the lands of both Order and Archbishopric of Riga were declared under “clientelle and patronage” of Sigismund Augustus while one sixth of the Livonian lands were pawned directly to the Duke of Lithuania (with Emperor of HRE in theory keeping the supreme power over them).\n\nWhile IOTL Kettler has converted to Protestantism and became the Duke of Courland 2 years later, I think the motivation for it was more of establishing a heritable title for him rather than changing the nature of his relationship with Sigismund Augustus. So it’s not impossible to imagine that the original treaty of 1559 continued to be valid for a longer period of time.\n\nThe circumstances of 1525 for the Teutonic Order and of 1559 for the Livonian Order are similar (i. e. armistice during foreign invasion, that the country cannot repel on its own), so I don’t think that having the similar deal with Cristian ITTL will be ASB. If so it basically offers vassalage of Prussia without secularization (while Charles will possibly retain some theoretical supreme power, I don’t think it will matter all that much).\n\nDoes that mean that Russia will definitely build an earlier Great Abatis Line by the end of 1630s? Of course, it doesn’t. But the possibility is there and the situation for building it is not more difficult than that of when it was built IOTL.\n\nSo, it sounds like Russia has the sheer resources to build the Great Abatis Line, and it is a more matter of will. Are there records of who actually proposed it IOTL? I know it was built during Ivan's reign, but I'm not sure such a massive fortification project just immediately developed, conceptually. The wiki article says that there are records of older, similar fortifications. Did the Great Abadis Line stick out merely for its scale and effectiveness or was it an extremely large step forward in regards to Russian defensive policy?\n\nJust trying to see whether it is just the right people deciding to devote resources towards that goal over other areas like Lithuania, or if it came about through 30-40~ more years of failed attempts to stop Tatar-Crimean raids and thus evolution of defensive ideas and doctrine.\n\nI have reread the last two chapters of Pal Engel’s book on the history of Medieval Hungary, that describes the situation in the realm prior to Mohacs (I can send pdf of the book upon request in private message). Here is the gist of the relevant chapters (although I recommend reading at least chapter 20 yourselves if you have time):\n\nUnder Vladislaus and Louis the country experience a rapid erosion of royal power.

While ITTL the invasion of may possibly be delayed for a year or two because of butterflies, there is no doubt it will happen in the next following years.\n\nWhat can be butterflied though is the circumstances of Louis death. OTL Mohacs was disastrous for the whole realm, but it hit the magnates particularly hard (with 20 barons out of 39 and 7 bishops out of 13 killed in battle), while John with his personal army was late to the battle (and thus left intact). Thus, the balance of parties in realm shifted greatly in favor of ‘nationalists’. ITTL butterflies may lead to different outcome keeping the balance in place or even shifting it towards ‘pro-council’ party thus making Ferdinand’s starting position much stronger.\n\nOnce again, thanks for all this great information. I did not know a lot of this.\n\nIf the Ottoman invasion is almost unavoidable, it seems the situation does come down to the points you raised. How does the alternate decisive battle play out? I really doubt the Hungarians can beat the Ottomans, but it could still be a less disastrous defeat if John's 8-13 thousand men are able to participate...Or more disastrous, if those troops get slaughtered as well. Louis II could survive. I wonder how Ferdinand's or the Hasburg's support would be affected if they're fighting for Louis' claim instead of Ferdinand inheriting the claim to Hungary himself. You already raised the possibility of different losses compared to OTl regarding the Pro-Council and Nationalist factions.\n\nWhat would probably happen if the battle was lost, but Louis survived? Is it likely that John Zapolya would stay loyal? Or would the nationalists rally behind their figure even with Louis alive? If Louis manages to maintain Hasburg support and John stays loyal, I could seen Ferdinand and Sigismund fighting for influence over Hungary even while technically supporting the fight against the Ottomans.\n\nIf Louis dies or the Nationalists are likely to rebel and raise up one of their own as a king after Louis is disgraced by defeat, I could see Hungary divided three ways. Ottomans claim a chunk, Louis/Ferdinand have a part, and Zapolya/Nationalists have a part. I'm starting to like the idea of Polish support for Zapolya. It might not have materialized IOTL, but it seems a clear front for Sigismund if he's at war with the Hasburgs. Can't have his enemies claim part of Hungary, either directly or through proxy, without him getting at least an equal amount. Fighting the Hasburgs in Hungary and Bohemia is arguably the best way they can hit the Hasburgs."
