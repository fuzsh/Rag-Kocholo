Ivan IV Vasilyevich, also known as Ivan the Terrible, was born in 1530 in Moscow to Vasili III and Elena Vasilyevna Glinskaya. When Ivan was only 3 years old, his father died, making him the Grand Prince of Russia. However, as a child, Ivan's mother Elena acted as regent and her uncle Mikhail Glinsky held true power. Elena later had Mikhail imprisoned and took a lover, consolidating her own power. When Ivan was 8 years old, his mother died, leaving him alone as the official but still young ruler of Russia.",
