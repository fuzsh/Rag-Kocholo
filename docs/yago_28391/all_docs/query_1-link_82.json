        "text": "Chapter 6.\n\nTHE EPOCH OF THE XVI CENTURY\n\n1. KAZAN = KHAZAR REBELLION IN RUSSIA-HORDE\n\nIn the middle of the XVI century the Kazan kingdom â aka the legendary 'ancient' Khazar Khaganate â becomes the centre of the Judaic religion. The Kazan czar, i.e. The Khazar Kagan and his court convert to Judaism. Kazan makes an attempt to break away from the Empire. It is possible, that there was some kind of connection between Kazan = Khazar Judaism and the Western Reformation, Protestantism.\n\nThe Kazan Judaism of the XVI century and contemporary Judaism should not be confused with each other. The present names of the religions originated from positive sounding notions. For instance, Jew meant 'One who praises God'. For a long time these terms were not attached to any of the religious branches. They were still in general use. That is why the mediaeval terms: Jew, Orthodox, Catholic = universal do not always correspond with the same terms in the contemporary sense which is already associated with this or that religious institution. The aforesaid also refers to the names of the countries. For example, Israel, i.e. fighter for God, was a religiously tinged name of the entire Horde Empire of the XIV-XVI cc. Judaea was the name for Asmania (Osmania) - Atamania with its capital in the Biblical Jerusalem = Czar-Grad. That is why in the epoch of the Reformation the name Israel was used by some newly emerging states in order to emphasise their rightness in the religious debate. Only later this name was assigned to just one religious branch and one state.\n\nIn 1552 the czar-khan of Veliky Novgorod â Ivan the 'Terrible' â severely crushed the Kazan â Khazar revolt [6v1], ch.6. The history of the capture of Kazan was intertwined in the chronicles with the seizure of Czar-Grad by the Osmans a century earlier, in 1453.\n\nIn the book [ZA] we showed that the seizure of Kazan is described, in particular, by 'classical' Herodotus in his work 'The Histories'. Moreover, it is described more than once and 'under different names'. For example as the conquest and crushing defeat of 'Egyptian Memphis' by King Cambyses II (i.e. by Ivan the 'Terrible'). For the second time â as the construction by King Xerxes (Ivan the Terrible once again) of a 'bridge across Hellespont'. Allegedly across the strait which separates Europe and Asia. The subject matter here is the beginning of Xerxes' punitive campaign against Europe with a purpose of punishing the Greeks and the Europeans in general 'for disobedience'. At the very beginning of the campaign Xerxes gives an order 'to pacify Hellespont' and to build a bridge across it, over which it would be possible to transport a huge Persian army from Asia into Europe. The massive bridge was built. This storyline by Herodotus reflects the building of the city of Sviyazhsk for the purpose of transporting Grozny's army across the Volga river prior to the conquest of Kazan [ZA].\n\n2. THE REVOLT-REFORMATION IN WESTERN EUROPE.\n\nIn the second half of the XVI century in Europe the governors who do not wish to obey the distant czar-khan of Veliky Novgorod form a rebellion. They seek independence. The banner of religious separation from the Empire was chosen as the ideological basis of the revolt. The rebels-protestants took advantage of the emergence of Lutheranism in the West as a just cause for political separation. Martin Luther himself was most likely a purely religious reformer and loyal subject of the 'Mongol' Empire.\n\n'The Reformation â¦ is one of the major events in world history, the name of which was used to symbolize the whole period of the new era spanning the 16th and the first half of the 17th century'[936], v.2, p.471. As a religious motto the reformists chose Lutheranism. In Russia it was called the heresy of the Judaizers [6v1], Ð³Ð».7. In the Romanovs' version of Russian history this heresy is mainly moved from the XVI century to the preceding XV century. The truth is that the Romanovs themselves were mixed up in the heresy of the Judaizers [6v1], ch.7. They were covering their tracks. However, even in the distorted version of the XVI century there survive many traces of the actual events. It is generally thought, that in the XVI century in Russia the heresy of the Judaizers re-emerges.'\n\n3. RUSSIA-HORDE'S PREPARATION OF THE PUNITIVE CAMPAIGN TO SUPRESS THE WESTERN REFORMATION.\n\nHaving crushed the rebellion in Kazan, Russia-Horde turns its attention towards the seething West. The decision was made to send a punitive force there. In the Russian sources this event is known as the beginning of the Livonian war [6v1], ch.8.\n\nIn fact the whole of Western Europe is called as Livonia here. It was only later that the Romanov historians cunningly depicted Livonia as just a small region on the territory of contemporary Lithuania, where the Russian army was headed to in order to crush Lutheranism. In other words, as we understand it now, to crush the entire Western Reformation. The historians made light of the matter in such a way as if to say that the conflict between Russia and Western Europe was the struggle between the enormous Russia with the tiny Livonia. So in the end it came across as if the Empire was fighting a fruitless and long drawn out war with a small, but proud Livonia. I.e. allegedly with Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden. This is the so called Livonian war of the XVI century.\n\nSo the 'Romanovs' Livonia' was granted - on paper â the achievements of the entire Reformist Europe. The small countries, included today by the historians into 'Livonia of the XVI century', were on the edge of Western Europe along the border with the metropoly of Russia-Horde. The name of Livonia itself in the XVII century, after the collapse of the Empire, has disappeared from the maps [797], p.707-708. Along with the so called Livonian Order. In other words, with Livonian Horde. The historians themselves admit that the Livonian Order was in fact GERMAN [797], p.708. So the historians tried at all costs to take the name of Livonia away from the whole of Western Europe and keep it just for the Baltic countries.\n\nThe Reformation in Western Europe = 'Livonia' was perceived in Velikii Novgorod as a revolt in the dependent regions. A decision was made to crush it by force. A massive campaign was prepared â the third conquest of Europe, so to speak. But at this point a revolt ignites in the capital of the Empire, escalating into terror and the oprichnina (political and administrative apparatus established by Ivan IV the Terrible â Translator's note).\n\n4. THE STORY OF ESTHER AND THE OPRICHNINA AS THE MASSACRE OF THE RULING MILITARY CLASS OF THE GREAT EMPIRE.\n\nA major revolt rises up in the capital of the Empire. Czar-khan Ivan IV falls ill, becomes deranged and retires from office. According to the Western sources, Karl V â aka Ivan the Terrible â leaves for the monastery, abdicating from the throne. In the epoch of the oprichnina it is a teenage Ivan, the son of Ivan the Blessed, who is formally the czar, but it is the others, his mother's relatives, who in fact rule. The pro-Western faction of the Zakharyins-Romanovs assumed power. The coup takes place 'via a woman'. I.e. with woman's help. It is described in the Old Testament as the legendary Esther [6v1], ch.7. A group of the Lutherans, which were called the Judaizers by the Russian Orthodox church, found itself in power for a certain period of time. They were the foreign Protestants, who enjoyed full confidence with the Zakharyins-Romanovs. They sabotaged the punitive Russian-Hordian campaign to the West which had already started. The epoch of the oprichnina begins. It is one of the darkest periods of Russian history. The massacre of the Hordian military commanders and elite takes place. Including the heirs to the Russian throne. One of the bright reflections of this in the 'ancient' history is the slaughter of his brothers by Svyatopolk the 'Accursed'. In the Bible it is reflected as the 'massacre of the Persians'. To commemorate this event in the Judaic church the famous holiday of Purim was established.\n\nThere are several consecutively ruling czars represented on the pages of the Russian history under the name of 'Ivan the Terrible'.\n\n1) Czar Ivan Vasilyevich, subsequently â Vasiliy or Ivan the Blessed (1547-1553).\n\n2) Czar Dmitry Ivanovich, a younger son of Ivan Vasilyevich, who died as an adolescent in an accident (1553-1563).\n\n3) Czar Ivan Ivanovich, the second son of Ivan Vasilyevich, a youth on whose behalf and under whose authority the oprichnina was unleashed (1563-1572).\n\n4) Czar Simeon (1572-1584), crowned to rein under the czar name Ivan after the defeat of the oprichnina and dethronement of Ivan Ivanovich. The founder of the new dynasty to which belonged czar Feodor Ivanovich and the last czars of which were Boris Feodorovich 'Godunov' and his teenage son Feodor Borisovich, who were assassinated by the conspirators.\n\nThe palace revolt in Russia of the XVI century, which put the end to the Livonian war, and the oprichnina and terror which followed it, are described in the Bible, in the Books of Esther and Judith. The 'story of a woman' played an important role. In the Bible it is depicted twice. As Esther, in 'the Book of Esther', describing the court life of Russia-Horde in the XVI century. And as Judith, in 'the Book of Judith', which gives an account of the same events, but through the eyes of a Western chronicler far from the khan court of the Empire.\n\nIn the Romanovs' version the story of the heretic Esther-Judith has been cleaned out from the XVI century as dangerous for the Romanovs who were embroiled in heresy. However it turned out that the epoch of the XVI century in the Romanov's history is duplicated in the XV century. It affords us an invaluable insight into the XVI century, by peering into its XV century reflection. Here the 'story of Esther' is presented in its brightest form. Ivan III should be read as a czar of the epoch of Ivan the 'Terrible' of the XVI century. It is most likely Ivan's IV brother â Georgiy, who came to power after Ivan IV = Vasiliy the Blessed stepped down. Georgiy I is described in the Bible as Artaxerxes Macrocheir (Latin: 'Longimanus'). In Russian history he also reflected as Yuri Dolgorukiy, the founder of Moscow. Under his rule the capital of the Empire was in fact moved to Moscow, where the Kremlin was built. It took place only at the end of the XVI century. But not in the XII-XIV cc. as we are constantly assured. Notably the transferal of the capital is closely related to Esther and the revolt in the Empire.\n\nThe recollections of these events were painful for the Romanovs even in the XVIII century. That is why in their version, the creation of which started in the XVII century, the 'story of Esther' was presented in a muffled way. At the same time, however, a fairly honest chronicle of these events was composed, which was included in the Bible. But here they were disguised under the invented 'biblical' names for the characters, countries, etc. The biblical canon was being created in the late XVI â XVII cc. Its final edition was carried out by the winners-reformers. In other words by the protestants.\n\n5. THE DETAILS OF THE STORY OF BIBICAL ESTHER = HERETIC ELENA VOLOSHANKA AND DMITRIY-MORDECAI, HER SON.\n\n&& THE BIBLE (BIBLICAL) VERSION.\n\nIn the Old Testament 'Book of Esther' the events unfold in the Persian kingdom under the great king Artaxerxes. The capital city is Susa. King Artaxerxes falls out with his wife Astin. She is accused of being disrespectful towards her husband. The king disgraces her. The king's subjects demand Astin's banishment and her replacement with another queen.\n\nThe Bible says: 'The Queen Vashti (Astin) would not come into the king's presence on his commandâ¦ the king â¦ had an errand for the seven chamberlains that waited on himâ¦ They were to bring queen Vasthi (Astin) into the king's presenceâ¦ Vain was the royal summons that the chamberlains brought her; she would not come. Whereupon the king broke out into a great passion of rageâ¦ Mamuchan thus spoke:â¦ So please thee, let an edict go out in thy nameâ¦ forbidding Vasthi ever to come into the royal presence again. LET THE CROWN PASS TO SOME HEAD WORTHIER THAN HERSâ¦ and the king did as Mamuchan had advised' (Book of Esther 1:12-13, 1:15-16, 1:19, 1:21).\n\nThe 'Persian' custom of selecting a bride for the czar is described in the Book of Esther as a matter of state importance. 'Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai â¦Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity â¦ whom the king of Babylon had carried away. And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's daughter' (Esther 2:5-7).\n\nEsther takes part in the bridal parade and the choice falls on her (Esther 2:17) So, a FOREIGNER Esther, aka Hadassah was chosen as the NEW WIFE of the Persian king Art-Xerxes. She was a JEWESS, a step-daughter and a relative of Mordecai. One of the captive Jews moved from Jerusalem = Czar-Grad by the king Nebuchadnezzar = Ivan the Terrible. At first Mordecai FORBIDS her to disclose her origin and faith (Esther 2:20).\n\nThe Bibles tells us: After this did king Ahasuerus promote Haman â¦ and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him â¦ And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate, bowed, and reverenced Hamanâ¦ (Esther 3:1-2).\n\nOn Haman's command the letters were sent by posts into all the king's provinces in the name of Art-Xerxes ' to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish all Jews â¦ and to take their spoils for prey' (Esther 3:13).\n\nAmong other things Haman writes the following: 'There is a CERTAIN PEOPLE SCATTERED ABROAD AND DISPERSED AMONG THE PEOPLE IN ALL THE PROVINCES OF THY KINGDOM; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's lawsâ¦ If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed (Esther 3:13). (Could it be 3:8, 3:9?)\n\nThe Jews demanded of Esther who had already become Art-Xerxes' wife to prevent the massacre. She succeeds. As if by chance it happens, that king Art-Xerxes catches Haman who 'was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was'. (Esther 7:8)\n\nThe king was enraged: 'Will he force the queen also before me in the house?' (Esther 7:8) Haman was hanged, and then was the king's wrath pacified. The Jews were saved. And 'the house of Haman' was given unto Esther the queen. (Esther 8:7-10)\n\nAfter the fall and death of Haman = Ivan Molodoy (Ivan the Young) (see below), the Jews succeeded in taking vengeance upon the Persians and crushing them. To commemorate this Purim, a two-day holiday was established (Esther 9:26). The decree of the king Art-Xerxes, which annulled the earlier sanction to persecute the Jews, provoked the Jews to attack their enemy. By this time the new edict praised the Jews.\n\nThe Bible: 'â¦the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, though it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them. The Jews gathered themselves together â¦ to lay hand on such as sought their hurtâ¦' (Esther 9:1-2)\n\nAnd further: 'THUS THE JEWS SMOTE ALL THEIR ENEMIES ... And in Shushan palace the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred menâ¦ The ten sons of Haman â¦ slew they' (Esther 9:5-6, 9:10). And also: 'But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces â¦ and slew of their foes seventy and five thousandâ¦' (Esther 9:15-16).\n\nIt is curious that here the Ostrog Bible (one of the earliest East Slavic translations of the Bible â Translator's note) and the Elizabeth Bible (the authorized version of the Russian Orthodox Church â Translator's note) carries on: 'AND DEVASTATED THEIR DOMAIN ON THAT DAY'. But in the synodic translation and the Hebrew Scriptures, the direct opposite is said: BUT ON THE PREY THEY LAID NOT THEIR HAND'. It appears that the later editors sometimes radically altered the version of events, changing black into white and vice versa.\n\n&& THE RUSSIAN VERSION.\n\nThe Biblical Arta-Xerxes, aka Nebuchadnezzar, aka Ivan III the Terrible (allegedly 1462-1505) is a partial reflection of Ivan IV the Terrible (1533-1547-1584) [6v1], ch.7-8. Ivan IV was born allegedly in 1503 (in fact he was born in 1526 [RI], ch.2, [ERIZ] and was declared the Grand Prince in 1533 [988:00].\n\nBiblical Esther â is Elena Voloshanka, the wife of Ivan Molodoy (Ivan the Young), the son of Ivan III = Ivan IV. The story of Elena Voloshanka in the Romanovs' version is shifted into the XV century. In fact the events took place in the second half of the XVI century. Elena was in fact a foreigner, who came to Moscow from the South. 'In 1482 the heir to the throne Ivan Ivanovich married Elena Voloshanka, the daughter of the MOLDAVIAN ruler (of MOLDAVIA)' [778], p.115. Exactly corresponding with the Bible, she was a Hebrewess and belonged to the heresy of the Judaizers, which was a secret heretic movement in Russia in that time [690], Ñ.10-12. Reportedly, 'on the surface the followers of the heresy remained Orthodox Christians and maintained a pious exterior. In front of the peopleâ¦ they presented themselves as the strict devotees of Orthodox Christianity, denounced and damned false doctrines. In secret they carried out their nasty work' [690] p.9-10.\n\nSo, Esther is Elena Voloshanka, i.e. Moldovanka (Moldavian), the princess of Moldavia. Her father is the Khan of Moldavia â that is the biblical Mordecai.\n\nThe expert on the history of the church A.V.Kartashov states: 'In â¦1470 in Novgorod there appears a heresy of the so called the 'Judaizers'. It's vaccine is brought from the outsideâ¦ the Novgorodiansâ¦ invitedâ¦ Prince Alexander of Kiev (on the other accounts he was a Lithuanian prince [690], p.9 â Author)â¦ The prince arrived in Novgorod â¦ with his aids who brought ideological novelties from the West â¦ Not the novelties of the Christian West, but of the Western Jewry. In the prince's entourage there was Skhariya the Jew, a medical scholar' [372], v.1, p.489. Within a year some people from the circle of the high-ranking clergymen of Novgorod joined the heretical movement. The heretics were sometimes called Skharians after Skharia (Zechariah).\n\nAnd further: 'THE RELATED, PROFESSIONALLY FAMILIAL nature of the cult is striking â¦ The whole matter was essentially arranged as a covert plot... The sect managed to maintain its SECRET LIFE for a whole ten years â¦ at the end of 1479 Ivan III, the conqueror of Novgorod, arrived there himself and was enchanted by the talents and gallantry of the cunning libertines â proto-presbyters.\n\nHe decided to move them into his capital. He made Alexei the Arch-priest of Uspenskiy Cathedral and Denis â the Proto-pope of the Arkhangelskiy Cathedral. Chances are that this honorary transferal â¦ was suggested to him by the secret alliance of the Judaizers itselfâ¦ the Moscow branch of which had already been established AT THE VERY ROYAL COURT of Ivan III and was headed by Feodor Vasilievich Kuritsyn, his MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS and deacon of the Ambassadorial Council. It's all kept shrouded in secrecy until 1487 when the conspiracy collapsed in Novgorod' [372], v.1, p.490-491.\n\nAllegedly in 1487 (in reality a century later) the Archbishop Gennady of Novgorod uncovers the Heresy of the Judaizers and initiates its persecution. In Novgorod, i.e. in Yaroslavl, heresy was destroyed. However in Moscow the heretics were left untouched as they comprised the CLOSEST ENTOURAGE OF THE CZAR IVAN III. Nevertheless, Gennady and the other hierarchy of the Russian church insist on the persecution: 'Execute the heretics â burn and hang them!' [690], p.13.\n\nAllegedly the council against the heretics was appointed in 1490. Hanging over them was the imminent danger of complete annihilation. But among their number they already could count Elena Voloshanka, Ivan III's daughter-in-law, the wife of Ivan the Young. It is also possible, that she was a heretic from the very beginning. The wedding of Ivan the Young and Elena of Moldavia took place allegedly in 1482 or 1483 [778], p.115, [282], p.54. Shortly after Elena of Moldavia gives birth to a son, Dmitry, a family scandal flares up among the family of Ivan III, in the centre of which are Sophia Paleologue, Ivan's III wife, and Elena, his young daughterâin-law. Ivan III falls out with Sophia Paleologue.\n\nIn March of allegedly 1490 Ivan the Young dies suddenly. Some thought that he was poisoned. The doctor who was treating him was executed.\n\nThe quarrel between Elena Moldovanka and Sophia Paleologue, the wife of Ivan III â is enflamed even more. The conflict between Ivan III and Sophia becomes explicit. The czar rejects his wife and openly BRINGS ELENA CLOSER â a young widow, the wife of his deceased son. She acquires the absolute trust of Ivan III. This is the biblical 'story of Esther'.\n\nThere emerge two antagonistic camps. One - Sophia Paleologue and her son Vasili. The other â Elena Moldovanka and her son Dmitry. Both boys are the potential heirs to the throne. The first camp is supported by the Russian Orthodox Church, Joseph Volotsky and the Archbishop Gennady. The second camp is supported by the Heresy of the Judaizers.\n\nAt that point Ivan III favours the second camp for a considerable time, supporting the Heresy of the Judaizers. The threat of crushing heresy recedes. The same year, allegedly in 1490, Judaizing heretic Zosima becomes the Metropolitan of Moscow [372], v.1, p.495. The heretics Alexei and Dionisy were appointed by the czar for the ecclesiastical ministry in the Moscow Kremlin: Alexei as the Arch-priest of Uspenskiy Cathedral and Dionisy â the priest of the Arkhangelskiy Cathedral.\n\nThe Archbishop Gennady of Novgorod and the other hierarchs of the Russian church succeeded in convening the councils in an attempt to destroy heresy in Moscow. The council is held allegedly in 1490. However IT DOES NOT RULE AGAINST THE HERETICS. The imprisonment of Vasily, Ivan III's son and the cruel execution of Vasily's confidants and zaritsa Sophia's supporters formed the pinnacle of the triumph of the Heresy of the Judaizers. They were thrown into the Moscow river. Sophia Paleologue flees to Beloozero (White Lake). Elena Voloshanka triumphs. Allegedly in 1498, while Ivan III is still alive, her son Dmitry is triumphantly crowned Czar. He becomes Ivan III's co-ruler. It is here that the Old Testament Book of Esther concludes its narration.\n\nBut to complete the picture we would like to tell you what happened next. Sometime later Ivan III comes to his senses and returns his favour to Sophia Paleologue and his son Vasily. VASILY WAS DECLARED AN HEIR TO THE THRONE. Soon, allegedly in 1503 Sophia dies. Ivan III was also taken ill. 'In 1503 Ivan (Ioan) III REPENTED IN HIS FORMER WEAKNESS TOWARDS THE HERETICS AND ASKED THE CLERICS FOR FORGIVENESS' [690], p.16. From that point the pendulum started moving in the reverse direction , and the counter stroke was intense. Elena Moldovanka was thrown into a dungeon, where she died shortly, allegedly in 1505. In 1504 THE EXECUTIONS OF THE JUDAIZING HERETICS SWEPT THE GRAND DUCHY OF MOSCOW. From that point the heresy of the Judaizers for some time ceased to exist in Russia. But, apparently, it took its toll on Ivan III. Allegedly in 1505 Ivan III dies.\n\nHowever the biblical Book of Esther does not speak a word of it. We add the word 'allegedly' to the dating of the XV century as in fact the events took place a century closer to us.\n\nIt turns out that the legendary patriarch Joseph of the Old Testament is the reflection of Joseph Volotsky â renowned saint of the Russian church, as well as of â Dmitry-Mordecai, the heretic, the son of Elena Voloshanka = the biblical Esther of the VI century [PÐ], ch.5. The relocation of the family clan of Jacob-Israel to Egypt described in the Old Testament Book of Genesis â is the emergence and establishment of the Western heretics-Reformers in Moscow. Russia-Horde becomes immersed in the Great Strife.\n\n6. THE ORIGINAL ESTHER IN THE RUSSIAN HISTORY OF THE XVI CENTURY AND A NUMBER OF HER STRIKING DUPLICATES IN EARLIER EPOCHS.\n\nIn [6v1], ch.7 we presented two bright reflections of the story of Esther in Russian history. One of them is the epoch of the heresy of the Judaizers under Ivan III, where Esther is Elena Voloshanka. The other is the epoch of the Seven Boyars after the death of Vasily III, where Esther is Elena Glinskaya, the mother of Ivan IV the Terrible. However, neither of the reflections occupies the correct place on the timeline. The original story of Esther is associated with the oprichnina of the XVI century and the Great Strife of the early XVII century, the origins of which lie in the late XVI century. The epoch of the XVI century, which was the key one in Russian history, was most thoroughly worked on by the Romanovs' historians. Their goal was to conceal both the very moment of the split of the \"Mongol' Empire and its causes. Luckily a more or less exact duplicate survived in the XV century under Ivan III as it was not recognized by the Romanovs' falsifiers. If they did recognize it, they would have immediately eradicated it, in order to remove accusations of the heresy of the Judaizers from the Romanovs-Zakharins, i.e. the Skhariyans, Zakhariyans.\n\nFig.64 shows a diagram of the story of Esther in its several variants. The most interesting is the original in the XVI century. Having broadly generalized it, it can be described as following:\n\nPlot 1: THE TWO CZARS-CO-RULERS â Arta-Xerxes and Haman. Haman is named 'our second father' (Esther 3:13). Or 'second after' [6v1], ch.7. They are related, either father and son, or a brother and his older brother.\n\nPlot 2: THE TWO WIVES. According to the Bible, they are Astin and Zeresh. Astin is the wife of Art-Xerex (Horde-George). And Zeresh, ZRS or ZRSh in Hebrew (Esther 5:14), is the wife of Haman = Ivan. The name Zeresh, Zeres or Tsereth would probably (most likely) mean Czaritsa (Queen in Russian).\n\nPlot 3: THE THIRD WOMAN-RIVAL AND THE HERESY. There appears the third woman â Esther. She pushes aside both of the women, Astin and Zeresh. Astin is banished, and Zeresh is defeated. The heretic Esther gets the house of Haman, the husband of Zeresh (Esther 8:1).\n\nPlot 4: A SEXUAL SCENE involving Art-Xerex, Haman and Esther. The scene results in Haman's death. Here Esther acts as a wife and a lover of both.\n\nPlot 5: SLAUGHTER OF THE KING'S CHILDREN FOLLOWED BY â POGROM. IN THE Book of Esther it is the slaughter of Haman's children and the massacre of the Persians by the Jews. To commemorate this event the celebration of Purim = fate was established.\n\nPlot 6: AS A RESULT â ENTHRONEMENT OF ESTHER'S RELATIVE. In the Bible it is Mordecai's accession to power.\n\nLet us look at the scheme closer and see which events of the XVI century it is comprised of.\n\nPlot 1: THE TWO CZARS-CO-RULERS. Ivan IV had a co-ruler Georgy or Yury, his brother [6v1], ch.7. The historians don't like to speak of Georgy's death. But when they do, they immediately add that he was allegedly disabled, feeble minded [6v1], ch.7. 'His consort Iuliania was considered to be the second Anastasia' [362], v.9, ch.1, column 26. The name IULIANIA is close to Elena â well known to us as the name Esther from allegedly XV century.\n\nPlot 2: THE TWO WIVES. The history of Ivan IV the Terrible's wives is very dark. The first two â Anastasia and Maria. It is not very clear which of them was the wife of Ivan IV and which one â of Georgy. Why Georgy's consort was considered 'quasi Anastasia' [6v].\n\nPlot 3: THE THIRD WOMAN-RIVAL. The third wife of Ivan IV is considered to be Marfa Sobakina. Somehow she didn't become an actual wife to Ivan. Further still, this impediment was for some reason 'attested to by the verdict of the high clergy' [776], p.210. She died in 1571 before the end of the oprichnina and the old branch of the Horde dynasty ascent to power, i.e. Simeon [4v]. Marfa is the biblical Esther. And her name MARFA or MARTHA, MARDA is a slightly distorted name MARDOCAI. The letter 'F' = Fita (Ñ²) in the name Marfa is spelled practically indistinguishable to 'D'. It was after Marfa's death Ivan the Terrible performed ecclesiastical penance. It was exactly in the same way that in the duplicate of the XV century Ivan III repented after the death of Elena Voloshanka.\n\nPlot 4: A SEXUAL SCENE. In the XVI century it was the reason for the death of Ivan Ivanovich â the son of Ivan IV the Terrible. It appears that there is something ambiguous going on between the czar-father and the son's wife. 'The last QUARREL BETWEEN THE FATHER AND HIS SON happened in Alexandrovskaya sloboda â¦ Grozny (The Terrible) found his daughter-in-law â czarevna (princess) ELENA â sitting on the bench in a warmly heated room wearing only her undergarmentsâ¦ He physically assaulted his daughter-in-law â¦ when Ivan Ivanovich tried to defend his wife... Ivan the Terrible attacked him as well. This scene was described by the Jesuit Possevinoâ¦ One Italian interpreter told him that the czarevich (prince) was seriously wounded with a heavy blow to his head with a staff' [776], p.235. There were also the other versions of the event.\n\nHere is described the same scene from the Biblical Book of Esther, allegedly from the XV century. The father-czar and his son-co-ruler find themselves at the bed of the son's young wife. Incidentally according to the Bible, Esther is presumably the son's wife, because Haman was called 'our second father' (Book of Esther 3:13). A quarrel flares up, as the result of which the son dies.\n\nPlot 5: SLAUGHTER OF THE KING'S CHILDREN FOLLOWED BY â POGROM. THE PERSECUTION AND EXECUTION OF THE CLOSE RELATIVES OF THE FIRST TWO CZARINAS Anastasia and Maria is associated with Marfa Sobakina in the epoch of the Oprichnina [362], v.9, ch.3, column 110. The circumstances of this matter are unknown and Karamzin speculates on the reasons for the execution. While the persecution and execution of the relatives of the first two wives is a distinct trace from the story of the biblical Esther = Elena Voloshanka.\n\nPlot 6: AS A RESULT â ENTHRONEMENT OF ESTHER'S RELATIVE. Under Ivan IV the Terrible the time of the oprichnina is the time of ruling on behalf of the young Ivan Ivanovich [4v]. Possibly it was him, who was Marfa's son. Ivan the Terrible himself at this time has most likely become Vassily Blazhenny (the Blessed). The state is ruled by the others.\n\nAccording to the Bible, at the end of the epoch of Esther, Mordecai accedes to the throne. What are his traces in the XVI century? They are vague, though something has survived. 'DURING THAT TIME (in the last yeas of the oprichnina â Author's note) A BIG INFLUENCE OVER THE CZAR WAS GAINED BY Eliseus Bomelius, a physician and astrologer from Westphalia who had arrived to Russia from England â¦ in London Bomelius was â¦ imprisoned for black magic â¦ In May 1571 â¦ he became GROZNY'S (Ivan The Terrible) MAIN PHYSICIAN TO THE CZAR AND COURTIER ASTROLOGER. A doctor and astrologer, Bomelius became one of the TRUSTED ADVISORS TO GROZNY (IVAN THE TERRIBLE) â¦ He predicted all sorts of disasters and immediately presented recommendations of how to avoid them â¦ He concocted poisons for the courtiers who fell out of favour' [775], p.439-440. The Russian sources inform us that 'Bomelius, planted from abroad, 'STEERED THE CZAR AWAY FROM THE FAITH' and 'INCITED THE CZAR TO KILL MANY OF THE BOYARS AND PRINCES' [775], p.498. After the demise of the oprichnina Bomelius attempted to escape Russia. He was captured and executed [775], p.484. He was spit-roasted on an enormous skewer [776], p.197.\n\nIt is feasible that the story of Bomelius, an astrologer, a physician and a poisoner, is the surviving trace of the biblical Mordecai in the XVI century which survives to our day.\n\nIt turns out the story of Esther has also been told by the legendary Plutarch in his 'Parallel Lives' as a story of Artaxerxes II Mnemon King of Persia, a 'grandson' of the Persian king Artaxerxes Macrocheir (Latin: Longimanus â 'with a long hand) [6v1], ch.7. Hence the 'classic' Plutarch lived and worked not earlier than the end of the XVI century. However it is no longer news to us. We have already presented the facts identifying Plutarch as Petrarch and advancing his lifetime into the XVI-XVII cc. [2v1], ch.1:4."
