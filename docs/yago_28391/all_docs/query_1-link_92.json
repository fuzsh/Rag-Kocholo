The luxununt, eveie»ee*i fo ests coiitoisled of laiuel, box, yew and othei species of trees. The and nveibanks abounded\n\nin animals which today aie either extinct (as the pi e-hjstoiic elephant, and a peouluit genus, ut ihuiooeios) or xvh ch now occur in bouthern lands (as the h ppopotaimis and leopaid).\n\nHuman beings lived in small giuups (\"primitive hordes\"). The hrst implements used by man ueie lough-ch^ppca stones. People obtained their food in common by gulh. nng snails insects, fiuit and edible roots. The hunting of small animals was still a casual pursuil . Because of the warm climate man had no need for the protection of special shelters or clothing.\n\nGradually the climate hardened and grew still more humid. Large glaciers formed in the north, and moved down the mountains. The luxuriant forests receded farther south, and the warm-climate animals either went south with them, or vanished completely. Vast areas were under ice.\n\nMan however remained and adapted himself to the harsher climatic conditions inasmuch as he had learned the use of fire. At first he learned how to keep up a fire, and then how to obtain it by rubbing dry sticks together and by striking sparks out of stone. Fire kept man warm, protected him against wild beasts, and allowed him to eat his meat and fish cooked.\n\nThe earliest squatting places of man in our country are those discov ered in the Caucasus (near Sukhumi) and in the Crimea. A large number of split animal bones and rude stone implements have been found in oaves not far from Simferopol. These were the dwellings of primitive hunters who used natural caves as protection against beasts and as shelter in time of bad weather.\n\nWhen the Glacial Age was at its height, a large cap of ice covered the European territory of our country, extending to the Middle Don and the Southern Dnieper (almost to Dniepropetrovsk). The ice cap over Siberia was less considerable.\n\nThe beginning of the first millennium B.C. witnessed the birth of a class society in the southern mountains of Transcaucasia and in Asia Minor. The iron ploughshare and the iron ax brought about the decline of ^he primitive commimity system.\n\nThis blanket of ice cjovered our land for many tens of thousands of years. The glaciers melted slowly and the ice gradually receded to the north, leaving behind it ridges of boulders.\n\nAt first the land freed from the glaciers was covered with tundra. Torrents of thawing ice out channels into the soil and formed the liver systems. The abundance of moisture stimulated the rapid growth of grass and forests. The plains, woods, riverbanks, lake shores, etc., became the abode of large animals — ^the mammoth and rhinoceros, as well as the reindeer and other specimens of the northern and Arctic animal world, Man’s most dangerous enemies — the cave lion, cave bear and cave hyena— inhabited the hills and caves. Man followed the retreating glaciers to the north.\n\nThe Primitive Community\n\nEquipped only with the wooden club, the wooden spear and the crudest stone implements man was unable to combat the ri gorous conditions of nature and the wild beasts singlehanded.\n\nDanger dogged him at every step. Only by helping each other could men protect themselves against the attacks of beasts and obtain the food they needed. This co-opeiation was especially necessary when hunting big game like the mammoth, rhinoceros, the wild bull and other beasts. In appearance the mammoth resembled the elephant, but was much larger and stronger. The mammoth chief means o£ defence were his enormous upcurving tusks\n\nThe mammoth was a herbivorous animal and dangerous only when being pursued. To capture such a strong beast people had to set traps or to lie in wait for their quarry near watering places or steep cli&.\n\nCollective life led to the formation of the primitive commumty. Everything, with the exception of some insignificant articles, be longed to the community; private property did not yet exist. In the primitive community there were no rich and poor, no exploitation of man by man. Productive forces were very poorly developed.\n\nPeople learned to make mud-huts and hovels as a shelter from the cold. Not long ago the remains of such a dwelling place were discov ered on the Don, near the village of Gagarino. The bottom of t e hut was a shallow, oval pit the sides of which were lined with bould^ and large bones, to which poles were affixed, joined together at e top and forming a roof covered with twigs and hides. The bones ^ ^ mammoth, rhinoceros, bull and various small animals were found scattered inside the hut. Ornaments were also discovered there — the teeth of small beasts of prey, shells, and several carved bone figures of women. With the development of Soviet archeology as many as 200 habitats of ancient human society have been discovered on Soviet land, They are scattered in various places in the southern half of the European territory, in the Altai Mountains and in Western and l^astem Siberia, and are evidence of the profound antiquity of human society in our country.\n\nThe Matriarchal Clan\n\nOrigin of the Matriarchal Clan\n\nOrigin of the Matriarchal Clan, As the climate changed, the vast glaciers vanished. They remained only in the extreme north and on mountain peaks. Gradually the conditions of nature became more like what they are today. The animal world changed; many large beasts, such as the mammoth and the cave lion, became extinct. Man*s struggle for existence was considerably mitigated.\n\nThe primitive community had had no definite social organization and readily disintegrated. On the other hand, the existence of a common economy called for a more stable and permanent social organization.\n\nIn the course of many thousands of years people handed down from generation to generation acquired labour habits. They learned to make implements of various sizes and shape from flint and bone, such as axes, hammers, knives, celts, picks, spear points, etc. They started polishing the surfaces of the stone implements, making them easier to handle. People learned to sharpen and pierce stones and fix them onto handles. Of great importance was the appearance of the bow and arrow which enabled the hunter to kill his quarry from afar.\n\nHis new production technique enabled man to rise to a higher stage of human civilization, that of barbarism. Man began to make earthenware, which was necessary for storing water, especially in dry regions. At 'first, the utensils were made of wood, twigs and skins. Then, to make them more durable, the walls of the wooden vessels were lined with clay. Still later the entire vessel was made of clay alone. Finally, the potter's wheel appeared, and with it pottery pro duction. The \"plaiting of baskets from twigs and rushes anticipated the weaving of the fibre of wild plants. This was the beginning of textile production. Coarse, handwoven fabric w^as used for clothing, bags, and the like, !Man’s vocations became more intricate and diverse. He began to use nets woven of fibre for fishing. His chief hunting weapons were the spear, the harpoon, and the bow and arrow. Dming their excavations archeologists sometimes find the bones of large beasts .of prey with flint arrowheads deeply imbedded in them. At first women gathered fmit and berries; then they began planting grain, tubers and edible roots. For this purpose a plot of'fertile land, usually in a river valley, was loosened by means of a pointed stick — ^the hoo. Barley, millet and wheat were sown. In this way arose the primitive form of hoe agriculture.\n\nPrimitive agriculture, which was carried on chiefly by the women, provided mankind with a more stable economic basis. Gradually, in the course of centuries, primitive people began to revere woman as the s^rmbol of fertility. Realizing the importance of maternity, they also honoured woman as the ancestral Mother. And woman, as the Mother, tiller of the soil, and guardian of the collective life of the group, became head of the primitive matriarchal clan.\n\nWhen a man took a wife, he went to live with her clan, where he was subordinate to his wife’s mother. At clan meetings, woman, the Mother, was in command, and members of the clan honoured only their female ancestors. For the murder of or insult to one of their kin, the entire clan sought revenge. Inter-olan blood feuds beeamo endless wars. For purposes of war several clans Joined to form tribes. Clans consisted of several hundred people, and were united chiefly for work. A tribe combined a number of clans comprising several thousand people, who primarily formed a military group. At tribal meabings the armed people — ^men and women— elected leaders and elders, and decided questions of war and peace. Women were also tribal chieftains.\n\nThe men, who were hunters, tamed wild animals. This laid the foundation for animal herding. The flrst domestic animal was the dog. In northern regions man tamed the reindeer.\n\nHabitations of Clan Communities\n\nMany dwelling places of clan communities have been found all over our country, from the shores of the Black Sea and the valleys of the Transcaucasian Mountains to the Far North, and from Byelorussia to Eastern Siberia. Tais material has enabled scientists to determine how people lived in that remote epoch\n\nIn the forest belt people lived along riverbanks and lake shores. Each settlement belonged to a single clan and consisted of a few hovels. The dwellers ’ chief occupation was fishing, and to somo extent hunting. In some places elan settlements were located in g/oups, a fact that points to the rise of a tribal union of clans.\n\nIn the south, where the country consisted of mixed forest and steppeland, and especially in the fertile river valleys, the chief occu pation of the population was tilling the ground with the hoe. As an example of a primitive agricultural society we have the Tripolye civilization, relics of which were first discovered near the village of Tripolye (not far from Kiev). Numerous settlements of the Tripolye civilization have been found on Ukrainian territory, west of the Dnie per; they are said to be about 6,000 years old. Settlements were located on high banks or on the slopes of ravines at the bottom of which streams flowed. The site selected for a dwelling was spread with clay which was baked hard with the help of bonfires. The walls were built of piles and sticks coated with clay. The result was a fairly spacious dwelling with several heai*ths inside. These crudely constructed houses accommodated up to a hundred and more people. The people planted wheat, barley and millet not far from their place of abode. Wooden flint-tipped hoes were used to turn up the soil. The grain was ground between large stone slabs.\n\nA large number of clay statuettes of animals have been found; a magical power was presumably ascribed to these statuettes which were supposed to protect the domestic herd and help it to multiply. Pictures of domestic animals are also to be found on vessels.\n\nOccasionally articles made of copper are found in the villages of the Tripolyo civilization. Little casting moulds have been unearthed, pointing to the fact that some of these articles were made at the place whore they were found. The frequent occurrence of metallic objects coincides with the period when the matriarchal clan system began to decline.\n\nThe Patriarchal Clan\n\nThe Development of Herding\n\nThe domestication of wild animals was of gieat importance in the life of the clan communities. Possessing domestic animals, people had a constant supply of food and were no longer dependent on the outcome of their hunt, which was not always a success. The taming of dogs and reindeer (in the north) was followed by the dom^ stication of otb r animals such as cattle, goats, sheep, swine and horses. Gradually herding became the chief pursuit of the communityAt first the cattle lived all year by grazing near the set tlement. Later the people began to make hay as fodder for the winter; in the north thin leafy twigs were dried and shredded for this purpose. During the winter domestic animals lived in the same houses with the people. Later special sheds were put up for the animals. Large herds of cattle could not remain in one place for a great length of time. People therefore began to migrate with their cattle in search of fresh pasturage. Thus, nomad herding originated in the vast steppe land Dairy farming, and the making of cheese and butter appeared with the development of cattle raising. Man learned to treat the wool of animals and to spin thread from it; then he began to make warm fabrics which were a good protection against the cold. Later the weav ing loom was invented.\n\nThe breeding of domestic animals enabled man to use them in turning up the soil. This led to the appearance of the first tilling implement —the wooden plough. The first primitive plough was probably a tree limb with a bent, pointed bough or rhizome.\n\nOrigin of the Patriarchal Clan\n\nHerding was the chief occupation of the man. It greatly enhanced his importance in the community. Man, the livestock breeder, replaced woman in agriculture: he tilled the land with the aid of animals (the bull, deer and horse) and freed woman from heavy physical labour with the hoe or plough. By using draft animals, man transformed hoe agriculture into plough farming. Kinship began to be traced from the male line, and no longer from the female -The matriarchal clan, which had existed heretofore, disappeared, and was replaced by the patriarchal clan, that is, a union of relatives who originated from a common male ancestor.\n\nIt became the established custom for a man’s children to inherit their father’s property, and this led to the accumulation of wealth in the family. Rich families began to withdraw from the clan. This accelerated the disintegration of the primitive community system.\n\nDevelopment of Copper and Bronze Age Culture\n\nThe development of the patriarchal clan was coeval with the period when stone imple ments began to give way to copper and bronze tools. Native copper was worked in the cold state. However, implements made of pure copper were too soft, they easily bent and soon got blunt. The dis covery of bronze, a copper and tin alloy, was of great importance in improving the quality of metal implements. Bronze melts at a lower temperature than copper. This facilitated the smelting and manu facture of bronze implements. The use of bronze, which is much harder than copper, permitted of a considerable improvement in tools and weapons, with the result that man’s labour became more productive and his weapons stronger.\n\nThe most ancient copper articles found on the territory of the U.S.S.R. date back to 3,000 B.C. They were originally introduced from southern and eastern lands. Local production came into being no later than 2,000 B.C, The mountains of the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Altai and the Urals became seats of the Bronze Age civili zation. From here the use of bronze implements spread to the steppe and forest regions.\n\nIn early times, when himting was man’s chief occupation, life in the different primitive communities was practically unvaried. Later occupations became more diversified. In forest localities which abounded in wild animals, hunting was still an impoi-tant pursuit. Near rivers and lakes people turned chiefly to fishing, while in fertile river valleys they tilled the soil. The grassy steppe served as pasturage for their herds.\n\nThe inhabitants of the European forest belts and the vast wooded areas of Siberia remained preeminently hunters and fishermen. They lived in small villages far removed from each other. The primitive community system still prevailed there.\n\nIn the grassy plains of Southern Siberia, Central Asia and the Black Sea region, herding became the basic occupation. Agriculture predominated in the fertile valleys. Here the disintegration of the primitive community proceeded more rapidly. Communities of hus bandmen and herders developed more quickly than communities of hunters. Sea steppes, which, when excavated, revealed human skeletons dyed a red colour. During burial, the dead body was covered with ochre or minium (red lead), which later settled in the bones. The dead man’s weapons and various household chattels were placed beside him. Sometimes the skeletons of a man and a woman were found together in the same burial mound. It is to be presumed that' when a man, the head of a family, died, his wife was killed and buried with him. The barrows reveal hat there were rich and poor burials, and testify to the incidence of inequality in property status. An example of an especially lavish burial— that of a clan or a tribal chief —is the tumulus discovered near the city of Maikop. The mound was about 30 feet high. The main section of the sepulchre contained a skeleton which had been coloured a bright red with minium. The deceased was dressed in clothing ornamented with golden images of bulls, rings, rosettes, and also with gold, cornelian and turquoise beads, and other small objects. Gold and silver vessels lay beside him. A canopy had been erected above the body, and was supported on gold and silver tubular piles decorated with solid gold and silver figures of bulls. The grave contained two other skeletons in special sections; the chieftain’s nearest relatives had to die with him. The Bronze Age flourished during the second millennium and the beginning of the first milleimium B C. in the mountains of the Cau casus, Transcaucasia and the Altai. Ancient mines from which ore was obtained for the local production of bronze, have been discovered in many places.\n\nBeginning of the Iron Age\n\nIron objects appeared on the territory .of the U.S.S.R. at the end of the second millennium B.C. At first iron was used to ornament bronze articles. In tbe first half of the first millennium B.C. the production of iron implements had already originated in various places, and these articles began to replace bronze weapons and tools. By the middle of the first millennium B.C, iron had firmly established itself in the life of the population of our country. It increased the productivity of labour tremendously, especially in agriculture and the crafts. \"Iron made possible agriculture on a larger scale and the clearing of extensive forest tracts for cultivation; it gave the ciaftsman a tool of such hardness and sharpness that no stone, no other known metal, could withstand it/’*\n\nThe beginning of the first millennium B.C. witnessed the birth of a class society in the southern mountains of Transcaucasia and in Asia Minor. The iron ploughshare and the iron ax brought about the decline of ^he primitive commimity system.\n\nEarliest States on the Territory of Our Country\n\nEarliest Slaveowning States in the Caucasus and Central Asia\n\nBasis of Slavery\n\nIn the primitive community oppression did not exist. But production, too, was in an embryonic state. With the develop ment of herding, agriculture and domestic crafts, men were able to produce more than was necessary for their own subsistence This led to the accumulation of stocks and the bartering of products among the clan communities. With the development of private family owner ship of the means of production, individual families also engasred in inter-family barter. Such barter further stimulated production, which could no longer be maintained by the labour power of a single family or clan.\n\nWars furnished a new source of labour power: prisoners of war were no longer killed, but were converted into slaves. War was now waged for the sake of capturing prisoners no less than for that of plun der. Wars still further increased property inequality. The rich could now enslave not only people of alien tribes, but also their own tribesmen and clansmen. Thus arose a division of society into classes: a class of slaveowners and a class of slaves. The slaveowner considered his slaves Ms absolute property, just as he did any other article that belonged to Mm. He could sell, buy and kill Ms slave just as he did his cattle. A slave had no property of his own. His labour was exten sively employed in the economy. The condition of slaves was a very wretched one, yet compared to the primitive community, the system of slavery was a progressive stage.\n\nFormation of the Slaveowning State\n\nThe state came into being with the development of property and class inequality. It was essential to the propertied class as a means of preserving amassed riches and maintaining its power over the slaves and the indigent population. The body politic arose on the ruins of the primitive community system.\n\nWith the appearance of property inequality, clan and tribal chief tains came to be elected from among the rich families. Wars of plunder enriched these chieftains still further and made them more powerful; with them their military retinues also enriched themselves. These retinues helped to make the rule of the chiefs hereditary. A special armed force, one which replaced the former tribal volunteer levy, was required to keep the slaves and the poor in subjection. Popular justice was replaced by a new court of law, one which served the in terests of the ruling minority. In the clan, society had been governed according to traditional customs. Laws that protected the interests of the slaveowners appeared in the slaveowning state. A state power unknown under the primitive community system was formed in this manner.\n\nAncient states expanded by subjugating weaker neighbouring tribes. Such multi-tribal states were unstable since they were founded not on economic ties but on the power of the conqueror. They therefore united or fell apart according to the success or failure of one or another military leader or ruler.\n\nAncient Transcaucasian States\n\nThe first slaveowning state to appear on the territory of our country originated in Transcaucasia near Assyria. In the middle of the second millennium B,C. the moun tainous land in the region of the triple lakps, Van, Sevan and Urmiya, and the upper reaches of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and their tributaries, was occupied by small tribal unions. The Assyrian kings undertook frequent campaigns against them. This country of the triple lakes was named XJrartu (Urardhu) by the Assyrian kings.\n\nIn the beginning of the first millennium B.C. the small princi palities of Urartu united under the supremacy of the stronger tribes. The united tribes, called Chaldeans —after the name of their god, Chaldu (Khaldu) —formed a kingdom headed by powerful rulers, who not only effectively repelled the attacks of the Assyrians, but themselves launched campaigns against them. A capital w hich was well protected in the south by the Iranian Mountain Range was built on the shore of Lake Van (near the present city of Van). During the 9th-8th centuries before our era the dominions of Urartu expanded tremendously.\n\nTo commemorate their victories the kings of Urartu left cunei form inscriptions on rocks and cliffs, which were sometimes located in very inaccessible places. These writings, telling of important events in the history of Urartu, have been deciphered with great difficulty by Russian and foreign scientists.\n\nThe kingdom of Urartu attained its maximum size and power in the middle of the 8th century B.G. In the north the Chaldeans seized the valley of the Araxes River and went as far as the Great Caucasian Mountain Range. During their successful campaigns against their neighbours, the Chaldeans destroyed settlements and forts, carried off rich spoils and herds, and either slew the inhabitants or captured and made them slaves. King Argishti, in an inscription engraved on a cliff at Van, records the massacre and enslaving of over 64,000 people effected by him in a single campaign. Thousands of slaves dug canals, were employed in economy, and built impregnable castles on high cliffs on the domains belonging to the king of Urartu and his lords. The buildings were erected without the use of mortar, merely by pressing stones tightly against each other. Spacious dwellings were also hewn out of stone cliffs. This demanded a tremendous expenditure of labour. The intricate water supply and irrigation systems were amazing engineering feats. The canal wnioh supplied drinking water to the capital, Van, remained in use for over two thousand years. Grain and grape vines were cultivated in the irrigated regions and river valleys. Livestock breeding was of great economic importance. The Chaldeans were noted for their excellent bronze weapons and other bronze articles. Urartu was a state of slaveowners, the popu lation being divided into freemen and slaves. The richest slaveowners were the king and his chief courtiers.\n\nAt the end of the 8th century B.C. the power of Urartu began noticeably to wane. Nomads from the north pressed the Chaldeans hard. The Assyrian empire on the Tigris grew strong again. Sargon, the Assyrian king, routed the troops of the' Urartu ruler, destroyed his capital, and carried off tremendous booty. Sargon carved the following inscription on a cliff as a record of his victory: ''When the king of Urartu learned of the defeat of his troops, his heart quivered with fear, as the heart of a bird fleeing from an eagle.\"\n\nIn the middle of the 6th century B.C. the Persian kingdom lying southeast of Urartu grew in power. The Chaldean tribes were weak ened by their struggle against it. Their union under the rule of the Urartu kings had begxm to disintegrate. The very name, Chaldean, fell into disuse; Urartu was retained in the name Mt. Ararat.\n\nNew tribal unions were formed on the former territory of Urartu in the 6lh century B.C., which later developed into two nations— the Georgians and Armenians, The ancient Aimenians lived on the land around Lake Van. The Karthveli (Karthli) and other kindred tribes who lived in the valleys of the Araxes and Kura rivers and the adjacent mountainous regions formed the Georgian people. At the end of the 6th century B.C, Ai menia was compelled to submit to the rule of the Persian, king, Darius I Hystaspes, Darius has left a lengthy inscription about his conquests, in which he describes how the Armenians rose up in rebellion against him, and how this rebellion was crushed only after five bloody engagements. Armenia had to pay heavy tribute to the Persian king.\n\nAncient Peoples of Central Asia\n\nIn the first millennium B.C. the vast steppes of Central Asia were inhabited by numerous nomad tribes of berdfcmen. According to the Greeks, these people were noted for their warlike spirit and bravery, 'All their weapons— arrows, spears, swords, axes — ^were made exclusively of copper and bronze. Women en joyed great freedom and even took command in time of war.\n\nIn the fertile river valleys the population engaged in agriculture. Among the agricultural people the clan system had already begun to disintegrate. Husbandry was carried on by a large patriarciial family which also included the slaves. Slave labour was used for the build ing of artificial reservoirs and canals, which were of great impor tance in arid areas. The most important agricultural regions were Khoresm (Khwarizm) along the lower reaches of the Amu Darya, and Sogdiana on the Zeravshan River. Caravan routes crossed Central Asia, connecting the Caspian countries with Eastern Asia. The towns situated along these routes plied an active trade. The largest of these towns was Marakanda (now called Samarkand), the principal city of Sogdiana.\n\nCampaign of Alexander the Great in Central Asia\n\nIn the 4th cen tury B.C. Greece and Persia contended for world supremacy Alexander, king of Macedonia, invaded Asia Minor, Iraq and Persia. He dreamed of conquering India. He defeated the army of the last Pensian king, Darius III, and in the spring of the year 329 B.C. crossed the Hindu Kush Mountains and descended to the Central Asiatic plain, attracted by its natural resources and large population.\n\nThe inhabitants of Sogdiana desperately resisted the Macedonians. Taking advantage of Alexander ’s absence— he had set off for Syr Darya with the bulk of his forces— the rebellious population, led by Spitamen, massacred the Macedonian garrisons in the towns. Alexander the Great hastily returned to Sogdiana and devastatedl he land wantonly. However, in spite of their fearful losses, the people continued to resist. Spitamen, with detachments of horsemen, made unexpected sallies against the Macedonians and kept them in a state of constant alarm. After a protracted struggle, the Macedonians succeeded in routing Spitamen, who then retired to the steppes with the nomads who had been his allies. The nomads, however, fearing the Macedonians^ ven geance murdered Spitamen and sent his head to Alexander. Thus did this outstanding leader of the Sogdians meet his end.\n\nHaving completed the conquest of Central Asia Alexander the Great marched against India. He died in the year 323 B.C., while he was preparing for new conquests.\n\nFollowing the death of Alexander the Great his empire, which con sisted of a large number of conquered lands in no way united among themselves, fell apart. Several independent states, headed by the de scendants of Macedonian generals, were formed on the territory con quered by Alexander. Greek (Hellenic) culture began to penetrate into the East after its conquest by Alexander. Greek warriors paved the way for merchants and craftsmen. Commerce between the Eastern coimtries and Greece increased. Greek art considerably influenced the art of the Eastern peoples. For this reason the Eastern states formed as a result of Alexander the Great ’s conquests are called \"Hellenic.\"\n\nThe state of the Seleucids (named after one of Alexander’s gen erals, Seleucus) was founded in Syria. It subjugated Transcaucasia including Georgia and Armenia, and part of Central Asia including Sogdiana. Gradually the population of these lands threw off the yoke^ of the Seleucid state.\n\nIn the 3rd century B.C., Bactria became an independent state. Bactria (the territory of modern Tajikistan) was a flourishing slaveowning state at that period, and at various times included separate parts of Sogdiana, Ferghana, ELazahhstau, Afghanistan and Northwestern India.\n\nBactria maintained intercourse with Siberia, which supplied gold to Central Asia, and with the Urals, where metal was mined. It also had ties with China, to which coun try a so-called \"silk route\" had beenlaid. The Baotrian kingdom reached the zenith of its develop ment in the 2nd century B.C.\n\nArmenia under Tigranes II\n\nAf ter the destruction of the Seleucid state by the Romans in the year 190 B.C. the Armenians rebelled against the Syrians and formed an independent slaveowning kingdom with its own dynasty of rulers, Armenia was at its greatest during the 1st century B.C, under Tigranes 11, who crushed the might of the neighbour ing Parthian king in Asia Minor, Persia and Turkmenia, Following this victory Tigranes 11 called himself the '\"king of kings\" and even declared himself a god. He established a magnificent Eastern court at which he gave refuge to Greek philosophers and writers who had fled from Roman oppression. During his campaigns Tigranes II captured large numbers of Greeks, Jews and Arabs, and settled them in his towns. With the help of these settlers he tried to develop the crafts and trade,\n\nTigranes 11 governed the country with the help of the rich slave owners, Slaves cultivated the lands belonging to the king, the temples and the rich nobility. Tigranes 11 had a large, well-organized army. If necessary he raised a popular levy of slaveowners and their people. The army was organized on the Roman system.\n\nGeorgia and Albania. Georgia, which comprised two large coun tries — ^Iberia and Colchis — was situated north of Armenia. Colchis was the name of a country bordering on the eastern extremity of the Black Sea famous for its auriferous sands and silver mines. East of Colchis was Iberia. The population inhabiting its mountainous regions engaged in herding and preserved the clan system. Both agriculture and horti culture were developed in the plains. Slavery was introduced here in the 1st centiuy B.C.\n\nAlbania was located on the western shore of the Caspian Sea. The mountainous regions and lowlands of Albania were inhabited by numerous small tribes, which were ruled by their respective petty princes. These tribes often attacked their neighbours, the Iberians (Georgians) and Armenians. Later they united under the supremacy of the strongest tribe, the Albanians. Subse quently the descendants of the people of ancient Albania were incorporated into the Azerbaijan nation.\n\nPeoples of the Northern Black Sea Region\n\nScythians\n\nThe people occupying the steppeland from the Volga to the Dniester in the 8th-3rd centuries B.O, consisted of various tribes including cultivators and nomad herdsmen, who bore the common name of Scythians.\n\nWe find descriptions of the life of the Scythian nom ads in the accounts of Greek writers. All the proper ty a Scythian possessed was contained in a four-wheeled or six-wheeled nomad kibitha — o, waggon with a felt tilt drawn by two or three yoke of oxen. Each hihi'ha was\n\na sort of little felt home in which the women and children lived. The\n\nScythians roamed with their herds of horses, sheep and cattle, remaining in a given spot as long as there was sufficient pasturage for their cattle. Then they would leave in search of pasture land. Among the masses of nomads was a rich ruling nobility which possessed large herds that were tended by slaves.\n\nThe Scythians were remarkable for their martial spirit and power of endurance, for their daring, and their cruelty to the enemy. They made wine-cups from the skulls of the people they killed, and quivers from their skin. A brave warrior was accorded the greatest honour. The Scythians held annual feasts at which only those who had slain one or ynore of the enemy were permitted to take a draught of wine from the common goblet.\n\nEveiy tribe had its king who was vested with great power. When a king died, his body was placed on a cart which was drawn throughout the entire land. The inhabitants who met the body of the king had to ex press profound grief: they cut their hair short, cut off part of an ear. scratched their faces, pierced their left hand with arrows. Kings were buried in huge barrows. With them were laid their arms, precious gold and silver vessels, and a large number of horses. Their wives and ser vants were also killed and buried with them.\n\nScythian tombs, some of which rise to a height of 30-35 feet are extant in the south of our country. Many of them have been excavated and a large number of interesting objects found in them are now on display in our museums.\n\nIn the large Chertomlyk barrow (not far from the city of Nikopol) on the Dnieper) a wonderful silver vase was discovered, with a frieze showing scenes of nomad life and Scythians breaking in wild mares. One section depicts two horses grazing freely in the steppe, in another scene some Scythians are having a hard time holding down a wild horse they have captured; in a third, three Scythians are trying to thi’ow a horse to the groimd. Then there is a picture of the horse after it had been tamed; a stooping Scythian is hobbling its forelegs.\n\nOf no les interest is a gold vase found in a barrow near Kerch (on the Kul-ObaHill). One of the scenes pictures a sea ed Scythian,evident ly a chief, listening to a tale or a warrior’s report. The chief’s long hair is tied with a headband. His clothing consists of a short kaftan con* hned by a belt, and loose, Turkish-like trousers. The chief is leaning on a long spear with both hands. A warrior is kneeling before the king. Another picture ou the vase shows a, Scythian fitting a string to his bow. Some other Scythian is treat ing the tooth of a third person. Still another picture portrays a Scythian bandaging someone’s dis eased or injured leg. Several of the Scythians are wearing tall pointed hoods on their heads. All of them have quivers of arrows and cases for bows slung at their side.\n\nA golden comb, which appar ently belonged to some Scythian king, was found in one of the bar rows (Solokha). The upper part of the comb has a scene on it picturing a combat between three warriors: two foot soldiers (one of whom is un doubtedly a Scythian) are attack ing a Greek horseman. Thus has an episode of the Scythian people’s struggle for independence from the Greek enslavers been preserved for\n\nhistory.\n\nGreek Colonization of the Black Sea Coast\n\nGreek slaveowners\n\nwent to the Black Sea region in quest of slaves, and were also lured to that tenitoiy by its riches .They had\n\nheard that the Scythians possessed large herds of cattle and a great amount of grain, and also that there was gold in the Caucasus. Accounts of the Black Sea region have been preserved in Greek legends about the golden lieeoe,the adventures of Odysseus and others .The first Greeks to visit these shore? were fisher men and tradesmen who bartered with the local inhabitants. Begin ning with the 7th century B.C. permanent Gi'eek colonies sprang up on the shores of the Black Sea. On the estuiry of the Southern Bug and Dnieper arose the colony of\n\nOlvia; not far from modern Sevas\n\ntopol was KhersoneS; and on the Scjrthian fitting a bow-string, southeastern shore of the Crimea — Teodosia and Panticapaeum (now Keroli). The city of Tanais was built at the mouth of the Don by the Sea of Azov; Greek colonies also arose on the Caucasian coast.\n\nThe centre of each Greek colony was a city surrounded by a stone wall. This wall protected the Greek colonists from attack by the hostile population. Within the city wall were dwellings, stores and various public buildings, such as the temples and baths. Among these structures were some splendid woiks of Greek architecture, ornamented with marble columns and statues.\n\nTrade with Greece, with Eastern lands and the peoples of Eastern Euiope was of gieat importance for the Greek colonies on the shores of the Black Sea. Vessels sailing for Greece were loaded with grain, slaves, furs and fish, while Greece exported weapons, fabrics, various utensils of clay and glass, costly ornaments and articles of luxury, and;tvine. Part of these imported goods went to satisfy the needs of the upper class of the local Greek population; part was exchanged for\n\nf uin and other products supplied by the population of the northern^ lack Sea coast. Later the Greek cities developed their own crafts/ Many of the articles found in the Scythian barrows were made in the workshops of the Black Sea colonies. The free Greek population in the colonies, as in Greece itself, met at ^'popular assemblies\" to discuss various questions and to elect their functionaries. The entire adminis tration was in the hands of the rich slaveowners and merchants. Every city-colony constituted a separate state. One such city, Panticapaeum, ruled a considerable teintory , the so-called Bosporus king dom. It was governed both by Greek and Scythian slave owners, whose power was passed by inheiitance from father to son.\n\nAt the end of the 3rd century B.C, the condition of the Greek colonies along the Black Sea shore deteriorated. Tribes of nomads, Sarmatae, who were kin to the Scythians appeared on the Caspian steppes. Harassed by the Sar matae, some of the Scythians , and other nomads moved westward and reached the Danube; others went to the Crimea and occupied its northern steppes.\n\nThe Scythians who remained were assimilated by the Sarmatae and other tribes. The Greek cities found increasing difficulty in repulsing the attacks of the nomads.\n\nThe Scythians who settled in the Crimea during the 2nd cen tury B.O. often attacked Kher sones and the Bosporus kingdom. At this time a Pontic kingdom was formed in Asia Minor, on the southern shore of the Black Sea.\n\nEiersones, which was not strong enough to defend itself, concluded a treaty with the king of Pontus, by which it was to receive help.\n\nSlave Revolt in the Crimea\n\nAt the end of the 2nd contury B. C. the Scythian slaves in the Bosporus kingdom rose in revolt. A slave of the Bosporus king, named Saumaeus, slew the king and headed the uprising. The revolt was crushed by Diophantus, a general of King Mith ridates VI of Pontus, who had come to Elhersones to defend it against the Scythians. He captured Sanmacus and sent him to Mithridates in Asia Minor, As a sign of their gratitude for the help rendered against the Scythians, the rulers of Khersones erected a bronze statue of Diophan tus in the acropolis of the city near the altar of tlieir most revered goddess. An inscription telling of the services and victories of Diophantus was carved on the marble pedestal. The in scription was found among the ruins of Khersones,\n\nThe uprising of the slaves in the Crimea was not an iso lated instance. Similar mass rebellions of slaves occurred in the 2nd and Ist centuries B. C. in many other slaveown mg states — in Asia Minor,\n\nGreece, Italy, on the Island of Sicily and other places.\n\nThese rebellions portended the end of the slaveowning\n\nsystem.\n\nRoman Conquests in the Black Sea Region\n\nDuring the 1st century B. C. Roman dominions rapidly spread eastward. In order to conquer Asia Minor Rome had to destroy the kingdoms of Pontus and Armenia. The struggle between Rome and King Mithridates VI of Pontus lasted almost 18 years. Finally, the Roman legions indicted a serious defeat on Mi hridatos. Roman slaveowners invaded the domains of Tigranes II. They sacked the rich capital of Armenia (the city of Tigra nocerta on the Tigris River) . The people rose in defence of their land and inflicted a series of defeats upon the Romans. Other legions under Pom pey were then sent against Tigranes II. Georgians, Medes and other peoples joined the Armenians against the Romans. Pompey took advan tage of dissension among the Armenian nobility and forced Tigranes II to conclude peace. The Armenian king was named the ''friend and ally of the Roman people,\" a title which signified the subordination of Armenia to Rome. Subsequently the Romans subjugated a considerable part of Georgia.\n\nDuring the 1st century B.C. the Romans established themselves firmly in the Black Sea region. The kings of Bosporus became the vassals of the Roman emperors and submissively executed all their or ders. Roman legions were quartered in Khersones and other Greek cities of the Crimea and the Caucasus. Roman fortresses with towers from which the approach of enemy vessels could be observed, were built along the shore of the Black Sea.\n\nThe kings of Bosporus began to use the names of Roman emperors and to wear Roman clothmg. They received their insignia of royalty from Rome: the sceptre with an image of the emperor and the royal crown. Throughout the century-long existence of the Greek colonies, the descendants of the former colonists intermingled with the local popu lation. Alien people of various tribes made their home in the Black Sea towns and became local citizens. In the Crimea, too, there was a min gling of different peoples and cultures.\n\nWith the decline of the Roman empire, its influence in the Black Sea countries decreased still further. By the 3rd century A. D. the Ro man fortresses in the Crimea and along the Caucasian shore became deso lated. The former Greek cities became independent once again. A new imion of tribes, known as the Goths, was formed on the southern steppes of the Black Sea region in the 3rd century. This union also included the eastern Germans, who had fonnerly inhabited the lower reaches of the Vistula. Towards the middle of the 3rd century the Goths began to invade Roman dominions beyond the Danube. At the same time Goth pirates plundered the Caucasian and Asia Minor coasts of the Black Sea and penetrated to the Aegean Sea, burning Greek towns. In the 4th century the Goths were severely defeated by the Romans.\n\nThe attack of the Goths upon Rome’s eastern possessions marked the hegiiming of the struggle of various East European tribes against the Romans. During the same period a struggle was being waged in Western Europe between tlie Romans and the German tribes. The attacks of the \"barbarians\" (non-Romans) hastened the downfall of the slaveowning Roman empire.\n\nNomads of Asia (from the 3rd century B.C. to the 8th century A.D.)\n\nThe vast steppes of Southern Siberia and Central Asia were inhabit ed by various tribes of nomads that later formed the Turkic and Mongo lian peoples. Several centuries before our era the nomads living north of China formed a large tribal union. The Chinese called the nomads belonging to this union Huns. The Chinese waged an arduous strug gle against the Huns, which lasted for centuries. The nomads made sudden raids on China’s northern territories, sacked the towns, ruined the harvest and carried off the population. When a large Chinese army was rallied, the nomads returned to the steppe and dispersed over its boundless expanses.\n\nIn order to defend their frontiers the Chinese, as far back as the 3rd century B.C., constructed solid stone fortifications which became known as the \"Great Wall of China.\" Gradually Chinese infiueuce made itself felt among the nomads. The Hun chief assumed the title of \"bom of heavens and the earth, the chosen of the sun and the moon.\" The Hun princes sent their sons to serve at the court of the Chi nese emperor.\n\nThe nomad ruling caste adopted Chinese customs and Chinese clothing .A Soviet expedition toNorthern Mongolia, headed by P.R. Koz lov, which explored the exceedingly rich barrows of the Hun rulers, discovered chariots, Chinese silks, a magnificent rug picturing a winged animal tearing an elk apart, precious objects, parasols whicb were symbols of high honour, and other objects.\n\nThe great Hun state decayed in the 1st century B.C. A large num ber of Huns moved westward. New tribes formerly under the domina tion of the Huns now came to the fore in the steppes of Asia.\n\nInvasion of Eastern Europe by the Nomads\n\nWhen the Hun state collapsed in Mongolia, some of the tribes moved westward in their attempt to escape the Chinese. Their descendants after intermingling with other peoples in the course of their roamings, appeared in Eastern Europe in the 4th century A.D. Contemporaries of the Huns called them \"the fiercest warriors.\" Besides the Mongolian Huns, the Hun kingdom included the native population of Central Asia and the northern part of the Black Sea region.\n\nThe Huns defeated the Goths and drove them west. The main Hun horde stopped between the Danube and the Tisia. Eor a biief space of time there was a strong Hun state in this locality, the king of which was Attila. After his death in 453, the Hun kingdom broke up: some of the Huns settled on the right bank of the Danube and mixed with the local population; others returned to their native haunts in the Black Sea steppes, where they were ethnically assimilated by the local population.\n\nThe movement of the Huns west of the Volga along the northern shores of the Black Sea stimulated the migration of other tribes aa well. Close upon the heels of the Huns, the Bulgars came to the Caspian steppes. But the Bulgars, too, were not long able to withstand the pressure of other nomads. The Bulgarian tribal union broke up into several parts. Some of these settled on the Volga (in the Bulgarian kingdom); others reached the Balkans, where they intermingled with the local Yugoslavio population, to whom it gave its ethnic name — Bulgar.\n\nTurkic Khanate\n\nA group of tribes, known as the Turkic khanate, arose in Mongolia in the 6th century A.D. The ruler of this state was called a kaghan, A large number of nomad and, to some extent, agricuD tuxal tribes were under the rule of this khanate. The ruling tribes un der the leadership of their khan constantly raided their neighbours and spreadtheirpower over a vast territory. The rich and the nobles com manded the warrior detachments and governed the subjugated tribes. The bulk of the nomad population lived in separate clan communities.\n\nTombstones of Turkic khans, hearing engraved inscriptions of remarkable campaigns and outstanding events, have been preserved in the valley of the Orkhon Hiver.\n\nThe Turkomans of the khanate were hostile to the Turkic Kirghiz (Khakass) who inhabited the upper reaches of the Yenisei Hiver and the Altai Mountains. One of the inscriptions tells how a Turkic khan mounted his white stallion and set off with his troops against the Kirghiz. He threw one Kirghiz off his horse. Then with a spear in his hand, he rushed into the ranks of the enemy, \"While doing so he dug his spurs into his white horse so violently, that he broke the horse ’s ribs. The Kirghiz khan was killed and the people submitted to the power of the Turkic khan.\n\nThe Turkic state in Mongolia and Central Asia collapsed in the 8th century A.D. After the fall of the Turkic khanate, the Kirghiz (Khakass), who had as many as 80,000 warriors and a large popula tion proved to be the strongest people.\n\nAnd so throughout many centuries the vast lands of Southern Siberia and Central Asia saw the continuous rise and fall of one or another tribal union. The nomads in their search for better pasturage and plunder, traversed a large section of the Central Asiatic steppes. Part of the nomads settled in the new places; olhers continued fur ther west. They were drawn to those regions by the fertile, grassy plains which spread out like a heavy green blanket northwest of the Caspian Sea.\n\nEarly Feudal States in Transcaucasia\n\nThe struggle Between Rome and Persia (Iran) for Armenia and Georgia\n\nRome ceased to exist as a slaveowming empire in the 4th oth centuries A.D. The peoples of Europe and Asia, including those of Parthia and Persia, rose against her. Persia subjugated Parthia, Albania (Azerbaijan) and a considerable part of Georgia and Armenia. Only a small pait of Western Armenia and Western Georgia remained under Roman power. At the end of the 4th century the Roman empire fell apart and was divided into two empires: the Eastern and the West ern. The Eastern Roman empire (Byzantium) continued its struggle against Persia for possession of Armenia and Georgia.\n\nThe Bfrih of Feudalism in Armenia and Georgia\n\nAbout the middle of the 1st century A. D. the Arsacid dynasty was established in Armenia. With great solemnity the Roman Emperor, Kero, re ceived an Armenian embassy and personally placed a croum upon the head of the Armenian king. It was approximately in the 4th century A.D., when kings of the Arsaeid dynasty were in power, that feudal relations originated in Armenia. Slave labour was not very productive and even became unprofitable with the development of agriculture and the crafts and impiovemenis in working tools. It was therefore superseded by the labour of feudal subjects. Serfs who lived on the lands of their feudal loids had their own little farms and the necessary implements. They tilled the land of the feudal lord and fulfilled other services for him. The lord could no longer kill bis serf with impunity, as he had killed his slave, but he still retained the right to buy and sell sei-fs. Under serfdom the peasant was interested, to a certain degree, in husbandry as a means of livelihood and to pay his lord a tax in kind, that is, with the products of his own harvest. The big landowners forced the peasants to do all the work on their estates and to render all manner of service. Every rich feudal lord had his own castle and troops. The feudal nobility seized the most important posts. The great feudal lords formed the king’s court, and attended state ceremonies at which they occupied places according to seniority.\n\nAt the end of the 3rd century A. D. the Armenian king and nobility adopted Christianity from Byzantium, and it became the national religion of Armenia. Byzantium supported the Christian church, using it to strengthen her influence. The church contributed to the final establishment of feudalism in Armenia, though ancient pagan beliefs persisted for a long time among the peasant population.\n\nIn the Byzantine part of Armenia the power of the king was de stroyed at the end of the 4th century, and the country was ruled by By zantine officials appointed by the emperor. Similarly the rule of the king in that part of Armenia which was under Persian sway soon came to an end. With the termination of the king’s rule the power of the large landowners was still further augmented.\n\nMesrob Mashtots, a monk, born of a peasant family, perfected the Armenian alphabet in the early part of the 6th century. This marked the beginning of an Armenian literature; instruction in the schools was carried on in the native language; youths were sent to Egypt and Byzantium to perfect their knowledge of the sciences. An exten sive literature, both original and translated, appeared.\n\nA kingdom was formed in Western Georgia on the territory of ancient Colchis in the 4th century A.B, This land was inhabited by ancient Georgian tribes of Lazis, whence the Romans and Greeks derived their name for the land — Lazica. The centre of this land was the fertile valley of Rion, which was covered with vineyards and orchards. This valley was also the site of a considerable number of towns, including Kutaisi, which engaged in commerce. After a long struggle with Persia, Lazica remained under Byzantine rule. The Eastern Georgian lands formed part of another kingdom, Karthli (ancient Iberia). In the beginning of the 5th century the king of Kar thli became a vassal of Persia. As eveiywhere else, the development of feudal relations in Georgia enhanced the power of the landowning nobility, which tried to limit the king’s power. Christianity began to penetrate into Georgia via the cities along the Black Sea shore. With the aid of By^iantium it became firmly established as the state religion of Karthli in the middle of the 4th century, and in Lazica in the beginning of the 6th century. Christianity strengthened the cultural ties between Georgia and Byzantium. Translations of reli gious writings appeared simultaneously with translations of Greek philosophical and historical works. This stimidated the growth of Georgian literature. The peoples of Transcaucasia did nob cease their struggle for liberation. At the end of the 5th century the Karthlian king, Vakhtang, who was called the \"Wolfes Head\" because of the emblem in the form of a wolf’s head on his helmet, fought against Persia. During one of the engagements he was mortally wounded. After his death the Persian feudal lords assumed power. The country was then ruled by a Persian satrap who settled in Tbilisi.\n\nThe Struggle of the Peoples of Transcaucasia Against Persian and Byzantine Domination\n\nByzantine and Persian domination in Georgia, Armenia and Albania (Azerbaijan) was accompanied by the terrible oppression and devastation of these lands. The population was brought to the point of despair by intolerable tribute and com pulsory services. The conquerors conscripted the Armenian and Geor gian youth into their armies. These conditions led to frequent bloody popular uprisings in Georgia, Armenia and Albania (Azerbaijan). The rebellions were notably powerful when the Georgians and Arme nians joined forces against the common enemy. Pilled with hatred for their enslavers, these peoples won many a victory over numerous and better armed enemy detachments. While the people fought heroic* ally and staunchly for the liberation of their country, the rich feudal lords often turned traitors and went over to the camp of their country’s enemies. This made it easier for Persia and Byzantium to crush the uprisings of the people.\n\nStruggle of the People of Transcaucasia against the Arabs\n\nPersia’s rule in Armenia and Georgia lasted until the 7th century, when the Arabs, soon after reducing the Persian empire, conquered Transcaucasia and Central Asia. In 642 they seized the capital of Armenia, Dvin, and within a few years conquered all of Armenia and Eastern Georgia. In the 9th-10th centuries there was a consider able number of rich cities in Ti*anscaucasia — ^Tbilisi (Tihis), Derbent, and others, which carried on trade and the crafts and maintained intercourse with Eastern Europe. Tbilisi became the residence of the Ai'abian emir. The country was ruled by his ostihans — governors. With the arrival of the Arabs the Moslem faith spread among the people of Transcaucasia.\n\nThe peasants of Transcaucasia fiequently rose in revolt against their Arabian conquerors, who were ruining the land with their exat* tions and turning the local population into slaves and serfs, A big uprising of peasants, craftsmen, and slaves occurred in the first half of the 9th century in Azerbaijan, under the leadership of the gallant chieftain Babek. Babek was orphaned w^hen still a diild. After his father’s death, when he was only 10 years old, the boy was turned over to a rich herdsman, for whom he worked as a shepherd. Later he became a camel driver. This enabled him to study the life of the Azerbaijan people at first hand. The sufferings of these people, oppressed by heavy taxes and other exactions, aroused in Babek a feel ing oi irreconcilable hatred for the oppressors and enslavers, especial ly for the Arabian rule. Babek, who was only 18 years old at that time, joined a popular uprising and soon became its leader. Binding protection in the inaccessible, high mountain regions, Babek fought tenaciously against the Arabs. The rebels won several victories over powerful Arabian detachments.\n\nIt was only after long years of struggle that the Arabs succeeded in occupying the chief insurgent areas. Babek went into hiding in the mountains and from there he continued guerilla warfare against the Arabs and the local feudal lords who had betrayed their own peo ple. All attempts to surround and capture Babek failed. Then one of the powerful feudal lords, pretending to be a supporter of Babek's, invited him to his castle. There Babek was treacherously seized and turned over to the Arabs. He was executed upon the order of the caliph. The uprising was suppressed. This determined struggle of the Azer baijan. people for independence lasted over twenty years.\n\nThe disintegration of* the Arab caliphate, which began at the end of the 9th century, led to the restoration of the rule of the local wealthy families in Georgia and Armenia.\n\nIn 864 Ashod I, who represented one of the most powerful families of Armenia, became king of Armenia and founded a new dynasty of the Bagratids, which ruled until the middle of the 11th century. This dynasty succeeded in uniting a large part of Armenia. The city of Ani (not far from the city of Khrs) became the capital of the Bagra tids and the trade centre between the East and the West. The city was beautified by a number of splendid buildings which point to the flourishing state of Armenian architecture. Erom his study of the luins of the city of Ani, Academician N. Marr, famous Soviet scientist, retraced the history of the language and cultui’e of ancient Armenia.\n\nAfter the fall of the Arab caliphate, Georgia broke up into a number of rival independent feudal principalities. It was only in the second half of the 10th century that one of these, the Tao-Klarzhetsk, suc ceeded in uniting these principalities under the power of the kings of the Georgian Bagratid dynasty.\n\nArmenian Epic, \"David of Sasun\"\n\nThe memory of the age long struggle of the Armenian people against their conquerors, the Arabs, has come down to ns in a beautiful epic poem, David of Sasun, It tells of the adventures and feats of four generations of Armenian knights. Two brothers built a fortress of huge stones high in the moun tains which they named Sasun (''Wrath\"). Poor people came to Sasun from all parts of the country to seek protection, and it became the bulwark of the people’s struggle against the enemies of their native land. David of Sasun is the central figure of the poem. When ^till a youth he fought against the Arabs, who were oppressing his people. The Arab sovereign set ofF with a large army against Sasun. He had so many warriors that they dried the rivers on their way by each of them merely drinking a mouthful of the water. 1^'et the enemy’s might did not daxmt David. '^Brothers and sisters!\" David exclaimed. *Tear not the enemy; I shall go and fight the foe for you.\" David mounted his father’s miraculous steed and engaged the enemy in battle. He slew the enemy warriors, sparing those, however, who had been for cibly driven to war. He also slew the Arabian king and liberated the\n\nprisoners:\n\nJ break the hoind-s that do enslave^\n\nReturn, you all, to friends and those you love so true.\n\nReturn, you, home, return and there your life renew.\n\nNor fees nor tribute do I crave,\n\nDavid had a son, Mger the Yoimger, who was as puissant and\n\ndauntless as his father. Left an orphan, Mger continued the struggle against the enemies of his native land. The poem tells how IMger stepped up to a cliff and with a powerful blow cleaved it in two. Riding his grandfather’s miraculous steed, he vanished into the fissure, where\n\nhe will remain until the old, unjust world is destroyed.\n\nAs long as the world is all sm\n\nAs long as deceit stands to win,\n\nSo long do I 'part with this world.\n\nWhen all is destroyed and created anew.\n\nWhen barley grows large as the berries I 7:ncto,\n\nOh then will I welcome my day!\n\nThis place will I leave on that day!\n\nIn these words of Mger the Younger the Armenian people expressed their undying dream of a better life. Centuries passed, gener\n\nations changed, but the bards, from age to age, continued to sing of the knights of Sasun, of their feats in their struggle against evil, and of their great love for their native land.\n\nPeoples of Central Asia in the Struggle against the Arabs\n\nConquest of Central Asia by the Arabs\n\nAt the time of the Arabian conquest Central Asia consisted of seveial states which were constantly at war with each other. The most important of these was Sogdiana, a land of fertile oases, rich foothills and momi tain valleys. Its territory was studded with the castles of landowning princelings who were practically independent of each other. The most powerful of them was the ruler of Samarkand, who called himself the \"Sogdianian king.\" West of Samarkand was Bokhara. Along the lower reaches of the Amu Darya stood Khoresm.\n\nThe steppes of Central Asia were populated by nomad tribes. The incursions of Turkic tribes from the east grew more insistent. In the early part of the 8th century they tried to seize the agricultural re gions of Central Asia and its rich commercial cities, but were repulsed by the Arabs.\n\nIn 751 the Arabs routed both the Turkomans and the Chinese on the banks of the Talass River and also conquered Central Asia.\n\nThe population of Sogdiana— the Sogdians, remote ancestors of the Tajiks —desperately resisted the Arab aggression. This agricul tural people found an ally in the nomads, who came to their aid. It took the Arabs about 75 years to completely subjugate the lands between the Amu Darya and S3rr Darya. EJioresm, Sogdiana, Bokhara and other Central Asiatic lands became part of the Arab caliphate in the middle of the 8th century. In most cases the Arabs permitted the local prince lings to retain their lands and power, but made them their tributaries. The caliph sent his governors to the larger cities and established per manent Arabian garrisons there.\n\nThe prosperous merchants took advantage of the Arabian conquest to trade with the caliphate dominions. Large numbers of Arabs settled in the towns, and noticeably influenced the local culture. The Moslem faith spread among the ruling class of the local population, and the Arabian tongue became the language of literature and of the state.\n\nThe agricultural population, who had heretofore rendered various services to their landowners, now also had to pay heavy taxes in kind to the Arabs. This tax sometimes amoxmted to as much as half their crops. The people, i,e,, the peasants, slaves and indigent city popula tion , were in constant rebellion against the Arab yoke.\n\nThe Revolt of Mokanna\n\nThe greatest uprising took place in the seventies of the 8th century. It was called the revolt of '^the white shirted,\" since the peasants wore simple white clothing. The leader of the popular lebellion was Hashim-ibn Hakim, who was known among the people as Mokanna, which means ''The Veiled.\"\n\nMokanna used to wash clothes in his youth. Later he had command of one of the rebel detachments. He was captured by the Aiabs and spent some years in a dungeon, but succeeded in escaping, and began to prepare a general uprising of the peasants against the Arabs and local landowners. This lebellion lasted about seven years. The insurgents seized and destroyed castles, killed the local landowners who had joined the enemies of their native land, and wiped out the Arabian garri sons in the towns. To subdue the peasant uprising, the Arabian emirs raised a huge army equipped with battering rams. Several fierce bat tles took place in which the peasant army suffered heavy defeats. Mokanna was killed, but tbe people did not cease to rebel against the Arabs.\n\nThe State of the Samanids\n\nWhen the Arab caliphate collapsed in Central Asia in the second half of the 9th century, the ancient Tajik state of the Samanids was formed (subsequently the name Tajik was given to the native Sogdiana population), with the city of Bokhara as its capital. The kings of the Samanid dynasty tried to create a strong, centralized power, such as was necessary to combat the nomads. They stubbornly opposed individual petty rulers who tried to establish an independent rule.\n\nThanks to the power of the Samanids, quiet set in in the Central Asiatic steppes. This stimulated trade and life in the cities. The larg est cities (Bokhara, Samarkand and Merv) engaged in a lively trade with eastern and western countries, particularly with China and the Volga region.\n\nLiterature and learning flourished during the reign of the Samanids, Poets and scholars (philosophers, doctors, geographers, mathemati cians, historians and others) created an exceedingly rich literature in the Fabian and Persian languages, Numerous valuable manuscripts were stored in the royal library at Bokhara. Each department of science or literature in the library had a special room to itself, and the library had an efficiently-kept catalogue. The famous philosopher, natura list and doctor, Avicenna (ibn-Sina) lived and worked in Bokhara at the end of the 10th century. Later his works were translated into Latin and became widespread in medieval Europe.\n\nKhazars and Bulgars on the Volga\n\nThe Khazar State on the Volga\n\nThe Turkic-Khazars formed a strong Elhazar state on the Lower Volga in the 7th century. The K h a zars woie a semi-nomad people. In the winter they lived in the cities, and in the spring they took their herds out to the steppes to graze. Herding remained their chief occupation, although they also engaged in agriculture, and grapevine cultivation. The Khazars were still divided into clans, each of which possessed its own section of land. However, the clan system had already begun to decay, and an iuduen tial group of the nobility in the clan came to the fore. The Eihazar langdom was headed by a hhahan or king, who was surrounded by rich dignitaries. The king was rendered divine homage. The country, however, was governed by a lord lieutenant and not by the khakan himself.\n\nThe khakan lived in Itil, a populous city situated upon the delta of the Volga. Outside the city walls were wooden dwellings and felt nom ad tents. The royal brick palace was situated on an island connected witli the bank by a floating bridge. The eastern side of the city was inhabited by visiting merchants —people from Khoresm, Arabs, Greeks, Jews and otheis. The many markets here had a diversity of wares from Gentral Asia, the Caucasus, the Volga region and the Slavonic lands. Itil was an important centre for southeastern trade, and its commer eial intercourse with EJaoiesm was of especial importance. The duty which the merchants paid the lOtazars constituted one of the chief sources of income for the khakan’s treasury. The regular intercourse with Transcaucasia and Khoresm had an important influence on the constitution of the Khazar state and the everyday life of its population. The Khazar ruling class and the king embraced Judaism.\n\nAnother important Khazai city was Sarkel on the Don. Sarkel was built with the help of Byzantine engineers, and was intended to afford protection against irruptions of nomads from the north and the ^ast.\n\nThe Khazar state reached the zenith of its power in the 9th century. In the south the Khazars in alliance with Byzantium fought against the Arabs and even went as far as the Araxes River. West of the Volga, the lands between the Caspian and Azov seas belonged to the Khazars, who at one time had subjugated part of the Crimea and imposed trib ute upon the Slavonic tribes living along the Dnieper and the Oka rivers. In the north their power extended to the middle reaches of the Volga.\n\nThe closest neighbours of the Khazars were the Pechenegs, who, in the 9ih century, roamed between the Yaik (the Ural) River and the Volga, BLarassed by other nomad tribes as well as by the Khazars, the Pechenegs moved further west in the second half of the 9th cen tury, and occupied the steppe between the Don and the Dnieper.\n\nBulgar State on the Volga and Kama\n\nhe union of Bulgar tribes on the Volga broke up as a result of the constant attacks of other nomads. Some of the Bulgars migrated to the Danube. Here they were absorbed by the Slavs, but they handed down their own tribal name to these people. Others went north up the Volga and settled on the lands along the lower reaches of the Kama and the Middle Volga, where they formed an independent state. During this period of migration to the Kama and the Volga, the Bulgars were still nomads. In their new environment they turned to agriculture. According to the accounts of Arab VTiiters, the Bulgars cultivated wheat, barley and millet.\n\nIn the Bulgar state the power belonged to the king, the tribal chief tains and the tribal nobility. Most of the towns were situated near the confluence of the Kama and the Volga. The Arabs called the Bulgar capital on the Volga, the \"Great City.\" Merchants from the Slav lands, from Transcaucasia, Byzantium and Central Asia, paid annual visits to the capital of Bulgaria. From the Slav lands they brought strong, fitalwart slaves and valuable furs. Arabian merchants came with steel swords, silk and oolton fabrics, and various rich ornaments.\n\nThe Bulgars themselves made journeys for furs to the north, which they called the ^^land of gloom.\" They bartered with the trappers of that country. The Bulgar merchants would lay out their wares in a pre arranged spot and then depart. The following day they would find animal skins set out beside their own goods. If the Bulgar merchant was satisfied with the bargain, he took the furs and left his own waies. If not, he would not touch the skins but would take back his own goods. Arabian cultme, which was more highly developed, penetrated Bulgaria with the eastern trade. By the 10th century the ruling class of Bulgars had already takeu over the Moslem faith from the Arabs. In imitation of the Arabs, the Bulgars began to mint their own coins.\n\nIn the beginning of the 10th century ibn-FadhIan visited Bulgaria as a member of an Arabian embassy. He left a most interesting descrip tion of his travels. The Bulgar king met the embassy not far fiom the capital. The envoys were ushered into a large, richly appointed tent, with Armenian rugs spread on the ground. The king sat on a throne covered with Byzantine brocadesOn his right hand sat the chiefs of his subject tribes. During the feast the guests were legaled with chimks of meat and drinks made of honey. Ibn-Fadhlan also saw Russian merchants there. They were strong stalwart people. Each of them was armed with a battle-ax, a knife and a sword, with which he never parted.\n\nAfter the formation of the Bulgar and Elhazar kingdoms, the Volga became a very important trade route between Europe and Asia. Its upper reaches closely approach the Western Dvina, which flows into the Baltic Sea, Thus there was an almost complete river route between the Caspian and the Baltic seas. Where there was a break in the river system, boats were hauled overland by '^portage,\"\n\nArabian merchants came in great numbers to trade on the Volga in the 8th-10th centuries. They paid for their purchases with dirhems, small silver Arabian coins, which were current thi’oughout Eastern Europe, including the Baltic states, Scandinavia and even Germany.\n\nThe Kiev State\n\nFormation of the Kiev State\n\nThe Slavs in the 6th–9th Centuries\n\nThe Slavs in the 6th and 7th Centuries\n\nThe ancestors of the Slavs, one of the most numerous peoples in Europe, inhabited the greater part of Eastern Europe since time immemorial . According to Homan writers of the 1st and 2nd centuries A.D., who knew the Slavs as Venedi, the Slavs lived along the Vistula and on the southern shure of the Baltic Sea.\n\nByzantine writers of the 6th century referred to the Eastern Slavs as Antes. The Eastern Slavs lived in the region of the Carpathians, the lower reaches of the Danube, along the Dniester, the Dnieper and the Don, occupying almost the whole of the southern part of Eastern Europe as far as the coasts of the Black Sea and Azov Sea. The Eastern Slavs engaged in agriculture, herding, fishing and hxmting. They were also acquainted with the working of metals. Their dwellings consisted of huts made of interwoven brushwood or reeds covered with clay. Their villages were surrounded by ditches, earthen ramparts, and wood en walls. The Eastern Slavs at that time still preserved the clan system. All matters of tribal concern were decided at tribal meetings called the veche (from the word veshchat meaning to speak). Influential members of the community became head-men or princes; some of them were influential not only in their own, but in neighbouring tribes as well.\n\nPatriarchal slavery existed among the Eastern Slavs, but slave labour did not play a significant role in their economy. Captives were either sold to foreign merchants, were permitted to return to their own land for a ransom, or, after spending several years in captivity, were given their freedom and the right to stay in the community as freemen.\n\nBeginning with the 5th century, the Eastern and Western Slavs, year after year, ravaged the Danube lands which formed part of the Byzantine empire. Tall, strong and very hardy, the Slavs were inured to heat, cold and hunger. In war they displayed great adroitness and cunning, and though armed only with shields and Javelins, rushed boldly at the enemy. During the wars with Byzantium the Slavs mas tered the Byzantine military art and acquired weapons which they learned to use even better than the Byzantines themselves.\n\nProm the 6th century the Slavs no longer confined themselves to raiding the frontier regions of the Byzantine empire, but also began to settle on the conquered lands. They peopled the entire northern part of the Balkan Peninsula almost as far as Constantinople and even pene trated the Peloponnesus.\n\nA nomad horde of Bulgars invaded the Danube Valley in the 7th century. Culturally, the Danube 'Slavs, an agricultural people, were far superior to the Bulgar herdsmen. This explains why the Bulgars who settled on the Danube lands were quickly Slavonicized. The descendants of the Bulgar princes headed the Slavonic kingdom which was formed at the end of the 7th century south of the Danube and which was called Bulgaria (or Bulgaria on the Danube, in contradistinction to Bulgaria on the Elama).\n\nSlavonic Tribes in the 8th-9th Centuries\n\nIn the Sth and 9th cen turies the Eastern Slavs split up into several tribes. The Slavonic tribes which had once inhabited the Black Sea steppes and its shores had, for the most part, been swept away by the influx of nomads. The Po lyane (from the word polye meaning field) lived along the middle reaches of the Dnieper in the region of Kiev, bordering on the steppe. The land west of the Polyane (in the western regions of the present Ukraine) was inhabited by the Dulebiov Volynyane (FoZ^maizs), while south of them, in what is today the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic as far as the Lower Danube dwelt the TivertsiaoA Ulkhi, Northwest of the Polyane, as far as the Pripyat, a tributary of the Dnieper, were the Dye* lyane, the \"forest dwellers\" (from drevo meaning tree) and the DregovicM {dryagva — swamp) . The Severyme lived on the left bank of the Dnieper, along its tributary, the Desna. The vast expanse along the upper reaches of the Dnieper, beginning from the Smolensk region, and along the Western Dvina, was inhabited by the Knvichi. The Eodimichi^ who dwelt along the Sozh River, a tributary of the Dnieper, formed a separate tribe. The Slavs inhabiting the shores of Lake Ilmen were known as the Ilmen Slavs, or the Novgorod Slavs, after the city of Novgorod. East of the Dnieper basin, along the Oka and its tributa ry, the Moskva River, lived the Vyatichi^\n\nPursuits and Social System of the Eastern Slavs\n\nIn the 8th and 9th centuries the Eastern Slavs were chiefly an agricultural people. In wooded areas agriculture was carried on in forest clearings, the under brush being cut away and the large trees being stripped of their baik to rot away. The next year the patch was prepared for cultivation by firing the soil and loosening it with hoes, or it was ploughed up. Besides agriculture an important place in the ect-nomy of the group was occupied by such pursuits as hunting, collecting the honey of wild bees, and fishing. In the southern regions agriculture was of greater importance than in the north.\n\nBy the 9th century the clan system among the Eastern Slavs de clined noticeably, though certain clan survivals still persisted. One instance of these survivals, though more rarely practised, was the blood feud. Wedding rites characteristic ofthe patriarchal clan still survived. Some of the more backward tribes clung to their custom of abducting women. In other tribes a wife would be bought for a veno^sb piu'chase price. The richer men had several wives. But the clan, as such, prac tically no longer existed. Clans broke up into separate, large families which, no longer held together by ties of kinship, continued to live as neighbours on a common territory and formed an agrarian community. Such an agrarian community the Eastern Slavs called the verv. The husbandmen who belonged to such a community were called smerds. The verv possessed in common forests, pasture land, etc. Every family that joined the community had the lighu io graze its cattle on the common pasture land, to extract honey of wild bees from the hollows of trees in the common forest, and to set traps for birds and beasts. Tilths were the absolute property of the respective families. The centre of the commimity was the foitified town which sheltered its members in case of danger. Gradually a group of wealthier elders took the lead in the community, and acquired large tracts of land. These lands were cultivated not only by members of their families; some of the prisoners were now made slaves and also forced to woik. How ever, like other European peoples, the Slavs advanced from the clan system directly to feudalism without adopting the inteimediary slave holding system, since the slaveholding system was a stage through which man had already pas'jed.\n\nIn time of war, chief tains —princes —were chosen from among the elders. Leadership in time of war afforded the princes a new means of enrichment inasmuch as they would always receive the lion’s share during the division of spoils and captives. This enabled the princes to maintain a retinue of warriors whose chief means of existence was warfare. With the help of their retinue the princes seized the power in their own tribes.\n\nEach tribe was ruled by several princes, one of whom was con* sidered the grand prince. This grand prince was supposed to consult with the other tribal princes and the elders on all questions concern ing the tribe. Sometimes a meeting of the entire tribe, the veche, was called*\n\nSuch tribal principalities originated in the 9th century among all the Slavonic tribes of Eastern Europe. The centres of these princi** palities were the towns that served as the residences of the princes and their retinue. The following towns were already known in the 9th, century: Kiev in the land of the Polyane; Chernigov in the land of the Severyane; Smolensk on the Dnieper and Polotsk on the Western Dvina in the land of the Krivichi; Novgorod of the Ilmen Slavs, and others.\n\nThe Slavonic tribes east of theDnieperfthe Vyatichi and Severyane) and also the Polyane, who bordered on the steppe, were conquered by the Elhazars in the 9th century. They paid tribute in the form of furs to the Khazar khakan.\n\nReligion of the Eastern Slavs\n\nUntil the 10th century the Slavs were heathens. They believed in the forces of nature, which they vested with human qualities. Everything that surrounded them— the stones, streams, trees, the grass— they endowed with miraculous powers: they made sacrifices to nature, decorated the boughs of ^'sacred\" trees with bits of cloth, threw offerings into the water. According to the Slavs the birds and beasts also possessed miraculous powers.\n\nThe Slav world was peopled with spirits. They believed that every forest had its wood-goblin upon whom the success of the hunt depended. Before starting on a hunting expedition the Slavs left a piece of bread for the wood-goblin on a tree stump. The deep still waters ot rivers, the Slavs believed, were the abode of the water goblins whom they tried to propitiate before going to fish. The waters were also inhabited by water-nymphs. Every Slav had his household god (the Domovoy, hearth-god) in his hut, who helped him to run the household.\n\nThe Slavs believed in the power of the sky, the sun, thunder and lightning. Their chief deity was the sun, or Dazbog^ the son of the\n\ngod of heaven. In the summer when the days were longest, the Slavs held a big feast in honour of the sun. In ancient times on the eve of June 24 (old style calendar) a maiden was thrown into the water as a sacrifice to the god-s. Later a puppet was used lor this purpose\n\nand the people bathed in the river. This night was called Ku'paU ^Jcaya (from ku'pat’— to bathe), or Midsummer Eve. Fire, according to the Slavs, was the son of the sun. The god of thunder was Peroun. They believed that Peronn drgve across the sky in his chariot and slew evil spirits with his fiery arrows. Thus did the Slavs explain the phenomena of thunder and lightning. Strilog was the god of the wind. The patron of herding and agriculture was the ''cattle god,\" Teles. He was also revered as the patron of bards.\n\nOne of the beliefs of the Slavs was that the souls of the dead contin ued to live after death. Food was left on the graves for the deceased. Their funeral rites were in conformity with the cult of the dead. Not all Slav tribes had the same rites: in some places the body was buried in a grave, in others the corpse was burnt and the ashes interred. A mound was put up over the grave. The deceased was fully equipped for his future life; various household objects (a knife, flint, weapons, utensils, etc.) were laid in the grave. When a rich man died bis wife and slaves were all interred with him. A wake was held to honour the dead, attended by military games and feasting in which the dead man was supposed to be a participant.\n\nThe Eastern Slavs had no temples. Wooden idols were set up in open-air shrines . Sacrifices were made to propitiate the gods and receive their support or appease their wrath. Sometimes these were human sacrifices. The Slavs believed that there were people who could divine the will ofthegods. and they called such people or wizards. The\n\nlatter were supposed to know special incantations by which they could control the powers of nature, cine the sick, transform themselves into werewolves, etc. The pagan beliefs of the Slavs such as the belief in household gods, wood-goblins and other superstitions persisted among the people for many centuries.\n\nThe Neighbours of the Slavs\n\nThe southeastern part of the Baltic seacoasi from the Niemen River to the Western Dvina was occupied by Lithuanian tribes. Those living between the Niemen and the Vistula were called Litavtsi-Pnossi. The right tributaries of the Lower Niemen were inhabited by the Litovtsi-Zhmud.The region of the middle reaches of the Niemen was occupied by the Lithuanians proper {Litva). This name was later applied to all Lithuanian tribes. The right bank of the lower reaches of the Western Dvina was the home of the Letygoh, and the left bank -—the These two tribes subsequently formed the Latvian people. The land along the watersheds flowing into the Baltic Sea was covered with dense forests and swamps. The Lithuanians lived in these forest jungles in small settlements; they had neither towns nor fortifications. Their small clan and tribal unions were in no way connected with each other. The population engaged in hunting, agriculture, and, to some extent, in herding. The Lithuanians who lived along the seacoast fished, collected amber, which, was highly prized at that time, and traded with neigh]?oiiring peoples (notably the Scandinavians).\n\nVarious Ural-Altaic tribes lived northeast of the Lithuanians and Slavs: the CJmdes (Esths), Merya, Mordvinians, Charemissi {Mari) and others. They occupied the forest land in the northeast of Emrope. Their chief occupations were hunting and fishing. The northern woods abound ed in sable, marten, squirrel, fox and other valuable fur-bearing animals. The pelts of these animals were bought by eastern merchants on the Volga and by European merchants on the shore of the Baltic. The people lived in mud-huts, selecting as sites for their settlements places which offered a natural protection and shielded them against attacks of the enemy.\n\nThe Varangians in Eastern Europe\n\nA water route connecting the Baltic Sea with the Black Sea ran across the land occupied by the Eastern Slavs and was called the \"route from the Varangians to the Greeks,\" that is, from Scandinavia, the land of the Varangians, to Byzantium. This route ran from the GuK of Finland via the Neva Biver to Lake Ladoga^ thence up the Volkhov Biver to Lake Ilmen and from Lake Ilmen to the Lovat River, from which vessels were carried by portage to the upper reaches of the Western Dvina. Bands of Varan gians, as the inhabitants of Scandinavia were known in Eastern Europe, or Norsemen, as they were called by their southern neighbours, used Ibis route in the 9th century when they went in quest of plunder. At that time the Norsemen terrified all Western Europe with their raids. They invaded the lands of the Eastern Slavs, as eyerywhe.*e else, for preda tory trade and plunder. The Varangians were organized in military bands under the leadership of their Izonungs, or princes. They attacked the Slavs and other tribes, robbed them of their furs, took prisoners, and carried off their booty to be sold in Constantinople, or to be shipped down the Volga to the land of the Bulgars and to the IQiazar capital Itil. The Slavs and their neighbours repeatedly rose against these freebooters and drove them off.\n\nSome of the Varangian princes and their retinues seized the most advantageous places on the ^'route from the Varangians to the Greeks\" and imposed tribute upon the local Slav population. They very often killed or subordinated the local Slavonic princes and ruled in their stead. Legend has it that in the middle of the 9th century one such adventurer, Rurik, established himself in Novgorod, which was the key position to the Dnieper route from the north. His brother Si neus lived at Byelo Ozero (White Lake), across which lay a route from the Gulf of Finland to the Volga and the Urals, and another brother, Truvor, at Izborsk, a town which commanded the routes to the Baltic shore. Two other Varangian chiefs Askold and Dir, took possession of the city of Kiev in the land of the Polyane. Kiev was an important southern point on the \"route from the Varangians to the Greeks.\"\n\nAnother offshoot of Scandinavia seized the principality of Polotsk on a different route leading from the Baltic Sea to the Dnieper along the Western Dvina. Most of the Varangians who made raids on Slav lands returned home with their booty. Some of the Scandinavian princes, however, settled with their retinues in the towns of Riis,. sometimes entering the service of the local Slav princes to protect them from new freebooters coming from Scandinavia.\n\nThe number of Varangians who settled on Slav lands was negli gible, The Varangian bands were augmented by local Slav warriors. Before long the Varangians were Slavonicized: already in the begin ning of the 10th century they used the Slavonic language and wor shipped Slavonic gods. The Varangian warriors very quickly merged with the Slav nobility and formed with it a single class. The ancient state of Rus grew in its struggle with the Varangians in the north and with the nomads who invaded the Black Sea steppes from the east, and maintained its independence of By^iantium.\n\nUnion of Eastern Slavs around Kiev\n\nThe Kiev State\n\nThe Dnieper region and the adjacent lands were united under the rule of Prince Oleg in the beginning of the 10 th century. The chroniclers tell us that at first Oleg ruled over the Novgorod Slavs, but later went down the Dnieper and conquered the Smolensk Krivichi . Proceeding farther down the Dnieper, he slew Askold and Dir, who were in Kiev, took possession of the city, and reduced the neighbouring Drevlyane. Oleg also subdued the tribes of Severyane and Radimiohi, who had been under the Khazar yoke. The simultaneous possession of Novgorod and Kiev made Oleg the undisputed lord of the Dniepei route. The lesser princes wore forced to submit to him. He became the \"Grand Prince of Rus,\" with all other princes \"under his will.\"' The lands of the Dnieper and the Ilmen Slavs were united under the rule of the Kiev prince. Tliis union was called Bus, and its centre was Kiev, which is why we call this union of ancient Russian lands \"Kiev Bus.\"\n\nThe greater part of the population subject to the Kiev princes were Slavs, but their state also included the Merya, Vesi, Chudes and other tribes. The economic ties among all these tribes were weak, and the latter were theiefore unable to form a stable entity.\n\nDuring this period the Eastern Slavs still lived in agricultural communities — vervs — ^and retained various customs that had prevailed under the clan system. But the process of disintegration was already in progress in the community; individual members accumulated wealth; the labour of the poorer tribesmen was exploited. In this way the division of society into classes was hastened, private ownership of land developed, and feudal relations originated.\n\nCampaigns Against Byzantium and the Caspian Countries. The Kiev state, which consisted of a number of independent principalities loosely held together maintained itself by force of arras.\n\nThe Kiev state played an important role in Eastern Europe. In 860, as a reprisal against Byzantine aggression a laigo fleet of Slav odnoderc vhi (small craft hewn out of solid oak trunks) made its way to the Golden Horn (the inlet of the Bosporus forming the harbour of Constantinople) and threatened the walls of Constantinople. The city was saved only because a storm dispersed the Slav beet. The annals state that Oleg undertook a successful campaign against Constantinople. In 911 he concluded an .advantageous peace with Byzantium, which established the exact relations between the Bus and the Greeks. The treaty is evidence of the regular relations between Bus and Byzantium and of the great power of the prince of Kiev.\n\nIn 913 or 914 Bus attacked the Caspian coaslliiie. Russian vessels sailed from the Sea of Azov up the Don to the spot where this river most closely approaches the Volga, and from there, hy portage, their boats were carried to the Volga. The Bus then went down to t3ie Caspian Sea and ravaged the Transcaucasian coast (now Azerbaijan), but on the way back they themselves were attacked by the Khazars and sustained certain losses.\n\nOleg was succeeded in the second quarter of the 10th century b\\* the Kiev Princ'j Igor, whom the annals call the son of Rurik, and who occupied a similar dominating position in relation to the other xDrinces. Igor continued the conquests of Oleg. He subjugated the Slavs living on the Southern Bug and imposed tribute upon the Drevlyane who revolted against the rule of Kiev. In 941 Igor launched a big sea campaign against B^^zantinm. The Bus devastated the precincts of Constantinople , but the Greek fleet kept them out of the harbour and forced them back to the Black Sea. Repulsed from Constantinople, the Rus ravaged the northern shore of Asia Minor. The Greek govern ment had to send a large land force to drive the Rus out of that country. The Greek fleet, which was equipped with devices for pouring liquid combustibles — \"Greek fire\" — over enemy vessels, inflicted a telling defeat on Igor’s sea force. The Greeks succeeded in setting fire to the Russian vessels. To save themselves from the \"Greek fire\" many of the Rus plunged into the water and were drowned. Never theless, what remained of the Slavonic fleet made its way past the enemy vessels and retmned to its native land.\n\nTo avoid a repetition of raids by the Rus the Greeks concluded a new treaty with Igor in 945. In this treaty the trade conditions between Rus and Constantinople were set forth in detail, and a military alliance against their common enemies was established.\n\nIn 943 Rus once more undertook a big expedition against the set tlements along the Caspian seacoast. Rus warriors sailed up the Kura River and captured the city of Berdaa. From there the Rus made attacks on the outlying lands. The unfavourable climatic conditions told on the Rus, of whom disease and mortality took heavy toll. Their thinned ranks were besieged in a fortress by Arab troops; however, the remnants, under cover of night, succeeded in making their way to their vessels and to return to Rus with their plunder.\n\nPolyudye\n\nOne of the reasons that prompted the Kiev princes to undertake campaigns and to wage war was the collection oi tribute from the conquered peoples.\n\nFeudal relations were as yet poorly developed in the Kiev state in the 10th century. Big land tenure was in the process of formation. The princes therefore exploited the population chiefly by collecting tribute from the people. The princes had bodies of military retainers — retinues — ^with whose help they undertook their campaigns and kept the conquered peoples in subjection. They shared the tribute they extorted with their retinue, thus paying the latter for their services. Each year, at the beginning of winter, the prince and his retinue of warriors would leave their city ticl <polyudye, that is, on an expe dition \"among the people\" — to levy tribute. The prince would make the round of his subject domains and collect furs, honey, hees-wax, etc., from the inhabitants. In the spring the booty together with prisoners captured in war would be loaded on ships and sent down the Dnieper to the Black Sea. At the Dnieper rapids the merchan dise and vessels would be transferred by portage. Here the travellers would often he beset by the Pechenegs, lying in wait to rob them of their wares. Another dangerous spot was near the Island of Khortitsa (where Dnieproges, the Dnieper Power Station, now stands). The high bluffs here cramped the narrow current of the Dnieper, and a fleet of ships was always in danger of attack by the nomads.\n\nAfter leaving the mouth of the Dnieper and sailing into tho Black Sea, the voyagers offered thanksgiving sacrifices at a ''sacred\" oak on a little islet. Then they followed the western shore of the Black Sea. The final destination was Constantinople, or Tsargrad (the tsar’s city) as tho Slavs called it. Theie they sold the furs, hoeswax and slave.'-, and in exchange acquired costly fabrics, wines, fimit and other luxurie.N.\n\nTribute was wrung from the subject tribes by violent and oppressive means, with the result that the Drovl 3 \"ane, headed by their local Prince Mai, rebelled during the rule of Igor. Igor, the chronicler says, entrust ed the levying of tribute from certain Slav tribes to one of his more influential retainers named Sveneld, thus arousmg dissatisfaction among his guard. The latter persistently urged Tgor to go to the land of the Drevlyane himself to collect tribute, saying: \"Svenold's warriors have fitted themselves out with ams, clothes and horses, while we are naked. Let us go. Prince, and collect the tribute, and thou wilt gain and we will.\" After collecting tribute from the land of the Drevlyane, Igor dismissed most of his military retinue and decided to make another round himself. 'T will return and go about some more.\" When the Drevlyane heard that tho prince was preparing to come back for more tribute, they said: 'Tf the wolf gets into the habit of visiting a herd he will devour it all unless he is killed.*’ They slew Igor’s attendants, then captured and killed Igor hmiself (945).\n\nIgor’s widow, Olga (945-957), uho ruled instead of her son Sv^^a toslav, who was in his minorit^^ mercilessly\" crushed the mutin 3 % I&korosten, the principal city of the Drevly-ane, was taken and burned; many of the inhabitants were either slain or reduced to slavery’'; the rest had to pay a heavy tribute. Pearing fui*ther uprisings, Olga fixed the exact amount of tribute to be paid in the future. However, not con tent merely with tribute she began seizing portions of the land that still belonged to the communities. This testifies to the still greater exploitation of the conquered lands by the princes and their retainers.\n\nThe Conquests of Svyatoslav\n\nSvyatoslav (957-972), the son of Igor and Olga, wns a Slav by birth, name and appearance. He wore a simple white shirt, an earring in one of his ears, and shaved his head, leaving only a long forelock. A brave leadqr of a martial retinue, he spent his whole life on campaigns, \"walking lightly, like a panthen-\"; he never took any baggage carts on his marches, slept on tho erround with his saddle as pillow, and ate half-cooked horseflesh. Svyatoslav never attacked an enemy by underhand, treacherous moans. When setting out on a campaign he sent messengers ahead to say*: 'T ’want to march against you.\"\n\nThe ^jacent lands of the Dnieper and Lake Ilmen were already part of the Kiev state. S'vyatoslav directed his arms first against the Slavonic tribes living east of the Dnieper, conquered the Vyatichi on the Oka, and then attacked the other peoples. In the sixties of the 10th cenfcnry he defeated the Volga states of the Bulgars and the Khazars, then marched to the Northern Caucasus, where he defeated the Kasogi (Circassians) and Yasi (the Ossetians), In 907 Svj’-atoslav launched a campaign against Bulgaria on the Danube, a land inhab ited by Slavs who had assumed the name of the Bulgars, their con querors. The Bulgars were constantly attacking their neighbour, the Greek empire, indict"
