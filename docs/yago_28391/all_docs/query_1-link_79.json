        "text": "Title is total clickbait\n\nThe Ivan Ivanovich is not the oft-discussed son of Ivan the Terrible, whose survival I'm sure would change history in all sorts of interesting ways. Rather, the Ivan Ivanovich I'm referring to is the eldest son and heir of Ivan III, Grand Prince of Moscow (and grandfather of Ivan the Terrible) and his first wife, Maria Borisovna of Tver. Ivan was granted the grand principality of Tver in 1485, but lost them (potentially as the victim of a inter-dynastic struggle) in 1489, shortly before his demise at the age of 31, apparently of gout. His death was considered suspicious and there was a rumour that his stepmother, Sophia Palaiologina (or her servants) poisoned him.\n\nWhen Ivan \"Molodoy\" Ivanovich died, his son by Helena of Moldovia, Dmitri Ivanovich (b. 1483) became the heir to the throne in his place. And later, similarly to his father, he was crowned \"co-ruler\" with Ivan III. However, Dmitri ended his days clapped in irons - a far more definite victim of inter-dynastic politics than his father - since Sophia gained the upper hand following the Gusev Conspiracy in 1497 (I don't read Russian so I'm going off google translate's version of their wikipedia articles). After Dmitri's arrest and imprisonment, Sophia's line ended up on the throne of Russia, and we all know where it went from there.\n\nBut what if Ivan Molodoy had survived? How would this have affected things? FWIG, his supporters and party had the stronger hand at the Muscovite court for most of the 1480s and early 1490s (to the point that at Dmitri Ivanovich's coronation, both Sophia Palaiologina and her son, Vasili Ivanovich, were pointedly \"uninvited\"). What would happen when things took a turn OTL (in 1497) when Ivan III fell ill? Does Sophia still point the fingers she did OTL? Is Ivan III (or anyone) going to believe her about it?\n\n@Valena @Lalli @Jan Olbracht\n\nthough ITTL the commander at Lithuanian campaign was Dmitry \"Zhilka\" Ivanovich, third son of Ivan III, who was really crappy commander, so Russia does better by default.\n\nwait...if he's a crappy commander, how does that equal Russia doing better? *scratches head*\n\nWhat's more interesting is that with successful Elisabeth of Denmark match for heir apparent there would be no fixation on domestic matches for at least a generation, and thus no empowering of one particular clan due to their elevation as Royal in-laws.\n\nAlways a good thing. Will be interesting to see what the match does for Russia.\n\nAnother match that might go through - that didn't OTL, but was proposed - was that of Elzbieta Jagiellon and Helena of Moldavia's brother, Bogdan III. It was basically agreed to and then Alexander of Lithuania died and Zygmunt Stary cancelled the betrothal. Here, even if Alex still dies, Bogdan's the brother-in-law of the Russian grand prince, so he might still have his appeal, no?\n\nA successful Danish marriage can also mean ripples in Germany as Joachim I of Brandenburg may get a different wife (Elisabeth Jagellon?) who may not be as sympathetic to Lutheran religion as Elisabeth of Denmark was OTL.\n\nthat could be fun to see"
