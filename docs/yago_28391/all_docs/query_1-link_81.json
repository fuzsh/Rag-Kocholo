According to legend the convent was founded as a convent in 1240 by Aleksandr Nevsky after whom the monastery is now named. However none of the buildings from the time of Aleksandr Nevsky remain; most date from the late 17th century. In 1764 the convent was dissolved under the secularisation policies of Catherine the Great. Only in 2006 was it reopened, but as a monastery… Read more »\n\nAleksey Lebedev Monument\n\nUlitsa Kremlyovskaya\n\nThe poet Aleksey Lebedev was born in Suzdal in 1912 and this monument to him was unveiled in 2008.

Read more »\n\nDormition Church\n\nUlitsa Kremlyovskaya\n\nThe Dormition Church is located next to the earthen walls of the Suzdal Kremlin. It is not exactly known from when the church dates, but it is assumed to have been built in the mid-17th century to replace an earlier wooden church which was destroyed by fire. The church was damaged by the fire of 1719 and subsequently restored. In the 1920s the church was closed and its tent-dome bell tower was demolished. The church has now been returned to the Orthodox Church. Read more »\n\nEnsemble of Our Lady of Smolensk and St Simeon Stylites' Churches\n\nUlitsa Lenina\n\nAcross the road from the Old Town House is another church ensemble comprising a summer and a winter church. As usual the summer church, which is the Our Lady of Smolensk Church, is the prettier of the two. It was built between 1696 and 1706 in what was then the settlement (sloboda) of Skuchilikha which was owned by the Spaso-Yevfimiev Monastery. The church comprises a large cube structure with five domes on tall tholobates and a classical-style bell tower. Just next to this is the… Read more »\n\nEnsemble of Ss Constantine and Helena's and Joy of All Who Sorrow Churches\n\nZaprudny Pereulok\n\nThe pretty Ss Constantine and Helena's Church dates from 1707 and comprises a cube structure with five domes on tall tholobates. In 1923 the church was closed and used as a store and a garage until it was returned to the Orthodox Church in 1990. In 1995 the church became the cathedral of the Russian Orthodox Free Church which later became known as the Russian Orthodox Autonomous Church. However after a court dispute, the church was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church. Ss… Read more »\n\nEnsemble of St Lazarus' and St Antipas' Churches\n\nUlitsa Staraya\n\nIn between Torgovaya Ploschad and the Rizopolozhensky Convent is another church ensemble: the beautiful summer St Lazarus' Church and the brightly coloured winter St Antipas' Church. St Lazarus' Church dates from 1667 and boast a double row of kokoshniks, five black domes and three carved portals. The main structure of the neighbouring St Antipas' Church, which dates from 1745, is much simpler but it makes up for this plainness by having a wonderfully decorative bell tower. Read more »\n\nEnsemble of St Nicholas' and the Nativity of Christ Churches\n\nUlitsa Lebedeva\n\nhttp://www.rusicons.ru\n\nClose to the River Kamenka is an ensemble of two churches which date from after the fire of 1719.

The winter church is the Nativity of Christ Church which dates from 1775. It is simple in form, but decorated with colourful cornices and friezes. The front pediment features a fresco depicting the… Read more »\n\nEnsemble of the Entry into Jerusalem and St Paraskeva-Pyatnitsa's Churches\n\nUlitsa Kremlyovskaya\n\nSituated between Torgovaya Square and the kremlin's earthen mounds is the ensemble of the Entry into Jerusalem and St Paraskeva-Pyatnitsa's Churches. The summer church is the Entry into Jerusalem Church which was built between 1702 and 1707 and features five domes on tall tholobates.

Read more »\n\nEnsemble of the Resurrection and Our Lady of Kazan Churches\n\nTorgovaya Ploschad\n\nAlso located on Torgovaya Ploschad is the church ensemble of the Resurrection and Our Lady of Kazan Churches. The Resurrection Church constitutes the ensemble's summer church and was built in 1720 to replace an earlier wooden version destroyed in the fire of 1719. Its most striking feature is its tall bell tower. The yellow Our Lady of Kazan Church is the winter church and is located right next door. Like most winter churches it is much simpler in comparison to the summer church… Read more »\n\nMemorial to the Fallen of the Second World War\n\nGorodskoy Skver\n\nIn the Gorodskoy Skver (city gardens) on the corner of Ulitsa Lenina and Ulitsa Vasilievskaya is a monument dedicated to soldiers from Suzdal who were killed in the Second World War.

Read more »\n\nRizopolozhensky Convent\n\nUlitsa Lenina\n\nThe Rizopolozhensky Convent was founded in 1207 by the Bishop of Suzdal. The convent is closely associated with St Yevfrosinia of Suzdal, the eldest daughter of Prince Mikhail of Chernigov. Yevfrosinia became a nun in the monastery in approximately 1233 when her fiancé died on the day of the wedding. From then on she dedicated the rest of her life to religion.

Closed on Mondays and the last Thursday of the month.\n\nThe biggest monastery in Suzdal is the Spaso-Yevfimiev Monastery, which is occasionally mistaken for the Suzdal Kremlin due to its large fortified walls. The monastery was founded in 1352 by Prince Boris Konstantinovich of Suzdal-Nizhny Novgorod, originally as a fortification. Originally the monastery was called the Spassky Monastery but was later renamed the Spaso-Yevfimiev Monastery in honour of St Euthymius (Yevfimi) of Suzdal, who was sent by Prince Boris Konstantinovich to… Read more »\n\nSs Cosmos and Damian's Church\n\nUlitsa Krasnaya Gorka\n\nOn the left bank atop the hill historically known as Yarunova Hill is the Ss Cosmos and Damian's Church.

Read more »\n\nSt Nicholas' Church\n\n65A Ulitsa Lenina\n\nLocated on the northern side of Torgovaya Ploschad is St Nicholas' Church which is often called St Nicholas' Cross Church to distinguish it from other churches in the city dedicated to St Nicholas. The church was built in 1770, but in the 19th century a refectory and bell tower were added. These new additions are of a different style giving the church two different appearances depending on which side you are looking at.

Closed on Tuesdays and the last Friday of the month.\n\nThe most ancient part of Suzdal is the Kremlin which is situated on a curve of the River Kamenka in what is now the centre of the city on Ulitsa Kremlyovskaya. The kremlin was established in the 10th century upon the foundation of Suzdal and in the 11th and 12th centuries earthen walls were erected with wooden walls and towers installed on top of them for defensive purposes.

The baroque-style church consists of a 'octagon-on-cube' main part with a single dome, which is attached to a bell tower via a vestibule. Previously it was joined by a winter church - St Nicholas' Church, but this was destroyed after the Revolution. Today the church looks a little run down but inside fragments of 18th and 19th century frescos have survived. Read more »\n\nSt Elijah the Prophet's Church\n\nUlitsa Ivanova Gora\n\nThe simple St Elijah the Prophet's Church was built in 1744 on a curve of the River Kamenka opposite the Suzdal Kremlin.
