        "text": "Sophia -- whose Greek name was “Zoe” -- was the daughter of Thomas Palaiologos (1409-1465), the Despot of Byzantine Morea and Caterina Zaccaria (†1462). Her mother was the daughter Centurione II Zaccaria (†1432), the last independent prince of Prince of Achaea, while Sophia’s paternal uncle was the last Byzantine emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos (r. 1449–1453). Born into a region under the domination of the expanding Ottoman Empire, warfare and diplomacy marked Sophia’s childhood. When Mehmet II (r. 1444–1446; 1451–1481) began the Ottoman siege of Constantinople in April 1453, he dispatched a smaller army to harass Morea and prevent Thomas from sending military aid to his elder brother. Thomas was able to withstand the Ottoman siege, but Constantinople fell in 1453, and Constantine XI perished in battle.\n\nMehmet ultimately let Thomas keep Morea following the conquest of Constantinople as his attention turned to conquest of Serbia where Sophia’s sister, Helena Palaiologina (1431–1473), ruled as Despotess of Serbia. Thomas, much to Mehmet’s chagrin, made a series of diplomatic overtures to Western rulers for capital and arms. Although Thomas succeeded in negotiating a series of alliances between Byzantine Morea and the Republic of Genoa, as well as the Papacy, he ultimately failed in securing Morea's independence from the Ottomans. Annoyed with Thomas’ continued perfidy, Mehmet invaded and conquered Byzantine Morea in 1460, forcing Sophia’s family into permanent exile.\n\nFlight into exile\n\nThomas fled Greece first to Venetian-controlled Corfu with Sophia, his wife, and two sons, Andreas Palaiologos (1453–1502), and Manuel Palaiologos (1455–1512). He later continued to Rome while the rest of his children remained in Corfu until 1465. Sophia’s father died the year of her arrival in Rome, and the famous cardinal and Neoplatonist Basilios Bessarion (1403–1472) oversaw her upbringing and that of her brothers. Raised in the splendor of Renaissance Rome, Sophia received a true humanist education education that included foreign languages, philosophy, history, and mathematics. She spoke Latin, Greek, and Italian with equal fluency, and it is believed that she took a particular interest in art and architecture -- interests that she would ultimately take with her to Russia. Sophia was a member of the Papal courts during the reigns of Popes Paul II (r. 1464–1471) and Sixtus IV (r. 1471–1484), and surviving letters in the Vatican archives reveals that she was the focus of much attention and scheming.\n\nThe Chronicle of Nikon ​(c. 1550) and ​The Russian History​ Dating Back to the Most Ancient Times by Vasily Tatishchev (1686–1750) both report that the King of France and the Duke of Milan sought marriage with Sophia, but they were rejected as the princess remained an Orthodox Christian. These narratives are likely false, and it is more probable that Sophia conformed to the Catholic faith during her youth in Italy as her financial security was entirely dependent upon the goodwill of the Papacy. Sophia was undoubtedly a political asset that the Papacy tried to use to its own benefit. Historical records show that J​ames II of Cyprus (r. 1463–1473) desired marriage, and​ ​Lodovico III Gonzaga, the Marquis of Mantua (r. 1444–1478) sought Sophia as a wife for his son Frederico I (r. 1478–1484). These matches came to nothing, as did a proposed match between Sophia and a member of the noble Caracciolo family based in Naples. Paul II sought a grander match for Sophia in Russia, and his opportunity to advance Sophia’s hand came in 1467.\n\nMarriage, court and conversion\n\nMaria of Tver (1442–1467), the wife of Ivan III (1440-1505) died unexpectedly, and Ivan needed to remarry as he had only a single, surviving heir: Ivan Ivanoich (1458–1490). Paul first proposed marriage between Sophia and Ivan III in 1469 with the chief aim of spreading the influence of the Catholic Church in Russia. Mindful of the failure of the Council of Florence in 1431, Paul believed a Russian match would reinvigorate the efforts to reunite the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches so as to counter the Ottoman threat to Europe. Paul believed that Russian aid would be essential in any future crusade or military campaign against the Ottomans. He was also mindful that members of successive Byzantine dynasties had married Russian princes over the previous five centuries. For their part, Ivan and his mother, Maria of Borovsk (1418–1484), believed that a Byzantine marriage would elevate Moscow's spiritual and temporal prestige in both the West and among their Eastern Orthodox neighbors in the Balkans and Caucasus. The marriage would, furthermore, provide Russia with a legal claim, by marriage, to rule a reconstituted Byzantine Empire. After three years of negotiation, the marriage agreement was settled in early 1472 by Sixtus IV(1414–1484)and Ivan.\n\nSophia's proxy marriage occurred with much fanfare at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome on June 1, 1472, and she received 6,000 ducats as a dowery. Sophia departed from Rome traveled first to Lübeck by way of Siena, Bologna, Vicenza, and Nüremberg, and thereafter boarded a ship bound for Reval (present-day Tallinn, Estonia). From there, she traveled to Dorpat (present-day Tartu, Estonia) and entered Russia through the city of Pskov where a magnificent ceremony officially welcomed her. She also stopped in Novgorod before finally arriving in Moscow on November 17, 1472. Sophia then celebrated a second wedding in the Dormition Cathedral in Moscow’s Kremlin. Sophia dashed Catholic hopes and expectations by reconverting to the Orthodox faith of her Byzantine ancestors and took \"Sophia\" as her new name.\n\nPatron of the arts\n\nHistorians widely believe that Sophia was behind Ivan’s order for the reconstruction of the Kremlin and its churches by Italian artists and craftsmen. Aristotel Fioravanti (c. 1415–1486) blended the latest Renaissance innovations with Russian aesthetics to create one of the world's most beautiful churches in Christendom: the Kremlin's Dormition Cathedral. Pietro Antonio Solari (144–1493) and Marco Ruffo (fl. 1450–1500) from Milan redesigned and rebuilt the Kremlin's walls and towers, and Ivan even had gardens created in Italian-style for Sophia as well, but these have not withstood the tests of time. Successive Russian rulers, including Sophia’s grandson, Ivan IV “the Terrible” (r.1547–1584), viewed Sophia’s role as a patron of the arts as a model through which they could project their own power through the prism of art and architecture.\n\nHistorians have previously postulated that it was Sophia who introduced Byzantine and Italian court ceremonies and customs to the Russia. There is some evidence for this, but more importantly, Sophia did not follow the traditional Russian custom of female isolation, which prevailed amongst the Russian nobility. Sophia met publicly with officials, and even foreign ambassadors, on equal footing with that of her husband. Russian courtiers and commoners saw this as particularly scandalous, and such actions did not endear her to her subjects. Many Russians simply distrusted Sophia due to her Italian upbringing and her connections to the Papacy even if her reconversion to the Orthodox faith was sincere.\n\nPolitical influence\n\nThe amount of political influence Sophia exercised over her husband remains a matter of debate and conjecture. Sophia does appear to have encouraged Ivan to break his treaties with the Golden Hoard in the 1470s. Ivan won the Great Stand on the Ugra River in 1480, defeating Ahmed Khan bin Küchük, Khan of the Golden Horde (r. 1465–1481), which ended Russia’s centuries-long vassalage to Mongol overlords. Nonetheless, while Sophia’s architects were lauded and patronized in Russia, the Greek and Italian officials who accompanied Sophia never gained positions of great power or prominence at the Russian court. Even Sophia’s brother Andreas failed to find an office or role in Russia. He came to Moscow twice and left both times empty-handed. The only exception was the famous goldsmith Gian Battista della Volpe (c. 1435–1515) from Vicenza, who became Master of Coin.\n\nSophia and Ivan had eleven children between 1474–1490 of which eight survived into adulthood. Vasili Ivanovich, Sophia’s eldest son, was third in line to the succession of the Muscovite throne. Sophia’s step-son, Ivan Ivanoich, was the Tsarevich, and he had a son of his own, Dmitry Ivanovich (1483–1509), through his marriage to Elena of Moldavia (1465–1505). Sophia met her personal and political match in Elena -- the daughter of the warrior king Stephen III of Moldavia (r. 1457–1504) and a cousin of Vlad III Dracula (c. 1428–1477) -- and the two conspired against one another for two decades. When Sophia and Elena took opposite sides on matters pertaining to the reform of the Russian Orthodox Church, their rivalry proved fatal for the Russian imperial family. Ivan Ivanevich died in 1490, and Sophia was widely believed to have poisoned him so as to advance her son's claim to the throne.\n\nAfter accusations arose of Sophia and Vasili attempting to poison Dmitry Ivanovich in 1497, Ivan banished his wife and son from court. Ivan crowned Dmitry Ivanovich as grand prince of Moscow in 1498, and he only allowed Sophia and Vasili to return to court in 1499. With no explanation, Ivan gave Vasili control over the cities of Novgorod and Pskov in 1499 and then named Vasili as his new heir in 1502. Elena and Dmitry were sent to prison where they both died a few years later in 1505 and 1509, respectively. Sophia died in 1503 at the age of about 54. Her success in securing her son’s right to the succession was to be her final victory. Sophia was buried in the Ascension Convent within the Kremlin; when the Soviets tore down the Ascension Convent in 1929, her remains were moved to the Kremlin’s Cathedral of the Archangel.\n\nIn recent years, Sophia has recaptured the popular imagination of Russians. A historical drama about Sophia -- ​Sophia​ -- aired on Russian television in 2016, and a sleuth of new publications on her life and legacy have been published in Russian. A controversial and politically astute woman, Sophia’s life remains worthy of further research and consideration.\n\nTHIS ARTICLE WAS ORIGINALLY FEATURED IN ISSUE 126, BYZANTIUM.\n\nIF YOU LIKE THIS AND WANT MORE, SUBSCRIBE BELOW!\n\nAbout the author\n\nJames Blake Wiener was trained as a world historian and is a co-founder of Ancient History Encyclopedia (AHE).
