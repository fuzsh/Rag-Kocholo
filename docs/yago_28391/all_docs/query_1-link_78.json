        "text": "Career\n\nIvan the Terrible was first crowned with the Monomakh's Cap at the Cathedral of Dormition. He was crowned with the Monomakh's Cap on January 16, 1547. The same year, he was the first Russian ruler to be proclaimed as the \"Tsar of all Russians\" at the Uspensky Cathedral of Kremlin. He proclaimed Moscow as the capital of the Holy Russian Empire. At the beginning of his reign career, Ivan the Terrible had three councelors - Alexej Adasjev, Silvester, a priest, and the church Metropolitan Macarius.\n\nFirst, Ivan made reformations of the Russian governmental system by reducing corruption and the influence of boyar families who had destroyed his childhood. Then he reformed the Russian Orthodox Church and the Russian army. He added a new division for the Russian army - an elite military force entitled as the Streltsi, with the help of which conquered many cities and territories such as the Khanates of Kazan and Astrakhan. After conquerieng the Khanates, Ivan also conquered the cities on the Baltic Sea such as Narva and Polotsk, which enabled Russian Empire to start trading with England. In the Spring of 1533, Ivan the Terrible became very ill. Because he feared death from illness, he demanded an oath of allegiance sworn by his councelors and boyars that his son Dmitri ascends the throne if he dies. He recovered from his illness though, despite all of his councelors and boyars thinking he was going to die. After his recovery, Ivan never forgave his councelors for not swearing on oath of allegiance.\n\nHe then, cured of his illness, decided to make Russia a strong centralized country in order to destroy all of the enemies of the Russian people within the country. When his first wife died of illness in 1560, Ivan's personality was once again broken down, and his psychosis from the childhood resurfaced again. He suspected that his councelors poisoned his wife, and he threw them all to the dungeon to starve to death.\n\nDuring Ivan's reign, Russia became the number one military force in the world. The Tatar Army was repeatedly destroying Russian cities and villages in the northeast. Ivan sent his army division the Strelsi on the Tatars army. In 1552, the Streltsi conquered Tatar strongholds of Kazan and Astrakhan. Later, the conquering of Kazan and Astrakhan influenced Russian expansion into Siberia. In order to celebrate Russian expansion, Ivan the Terrible gave orders to architects Postnik and Barma to build St. Basil's Cathedral on Moscow's Red Square.\n\nIvan the Terrible established the Zemsky Sobor, which was the first Russian parliament. He also established the Russian first council of noblemen. He changed Russian law code, introducing the Sudebnik of 1550 to the Russian law system.\n\nIvan the Terrible left Moscow on December 3, 1564. He secretly packed all of his royal belongings and royal treasures and went to a place called Aleksandrova Sloboda. From there, he has sent two letters in which he announced that he would abdicate from the Russian throne. He decided to do it because he was devastated by treason of Russian aristocracy and Russian clergy. Ivan's boyar court feared to rule in his absence and they were also afraid of the revenge of the Muscovite citizenship. A group of boyars later went to Aleksandrova Sloboda in order to beg Ivan the Terrible to come back to the Russian throne. He negotiated with the boyars and decided he would return to the Russian throne under one and only condition: he wanted to have absolute power as a ruler in Russia so he could execute and slain any traitor on the way and take all of their possessions, without clergy and boyars preventing him from doing so. His goals of executing all the traitors of the Russian state led to the creation of oprichnina.\n\nThe oprichnina was located in the Russian north, in the territory of the former Novgorod Republic. Ivan the Terrible had absolute power over it. His Council of Boyars were only ruling zemschina aspect of oprichnina territory. He also made a new division of Russian Army in oprichnina, called the Oprichniki with the commander - Malyuta Skuratov. These personal guards of oprichnina had many privileges, both social and economical, under the oprichnina. They first persecuted the princely Russian clans such as the noble families of Suzdal'. Ivan ordered the Oprichnikis to execute, exile and tonsure members of the boyar clans that were accused of conspiracy. Among executed people from the boyar clans were the Metropolitan Phillip and the warrior Alexander Gorbaty-Shuisky. Ivan dismissed the Oprichnina and the Oprichniks in 1572 because they failed to prove themselves as prominent warriors in the 1571-1572 Russo-Crimean war.\n\nIvan died from a stroke while playing chess with Bogdan Belsky on 28 March 1584. Upon Ivan's death, the Russian throne was left to his unfit middle son Feodor. Feodor died childless in 1598, ushering in the Time of Troubles."
