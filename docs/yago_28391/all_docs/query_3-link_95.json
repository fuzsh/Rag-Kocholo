        "text": "Known to Soviet citizens as “the Wolf of Moscow”, Vasili Komaroff is considered one of the earliest known Russian serial killers. Born to a poor family in the Russian Empire, Vasili would go on to join the Red Army during the Communist Revolution in 1917 and later settled in Moscow where he became a horse trader to support his wife and children. In 1921 the Soviet police began investigating a series of disappearances and murders which were being committed in and around the Moscow area. The bodies were found buried or dumped in the Moscow River, and soon the corpses of 21 men were discovered. Eventually the police came to Komaroff’s home to question him about his criminal activities, and there they found his latest victim in the stable next to his home. Managing to escape arrest, he was soon recaptured and questioned over the murders. Komaroff admitted to murdering a total of 33 men and was sentenced to death by the Soviet court and subsequently executed for his crimes.\n\nVasili Komaroff was born Vasili Ivanovich Petrov in 1871 in Vitebsk, a Governorate of the Russian Empire under the Romanov Dynasty. The Petrov’s had a large but poor family and as a result of the hardships of the era many members turned to alcohol, including Vasili who began drinking as the age of fifteen. When he came of age he was conscripted into the Russian Army where he served for four years. He married in 1899 at the age of 28 and moved family to the Far East in 1904 during the Russian-Japanese War.\n\nThere he was able to earned a small fortune but the money was squandered and Komaroff soon resorted to crime to pay for his family. He became involved in a robbery at a military warehouse, but was caught and received a one-year prison sentence. During his imprisonment, he learned his wife had died from cholera. When released he moved to Riga and married Sophia, a Polish widow and they had two children. To friends and acquaintances it seemed a happy marriage, however Komaroff was by now an alcoholic and would often beat his wife and children.\n\nWhen World War I began, Komaroff was still living in the Baltic when German troops entered and he was forced to flee along with his family to the Russian Volga region. With the rise of Lenin’s Communist Party and the collapse of the Russian Empire under Czar Nicholas II, Komaroff decided, like many disaffected men, to join the Red Army during the October Revolution in 1917. Whilst in the army he learned to both read and write and eventually rose to the position of platoon commander.\n\nKomaroff would attend the local marketplace to sell his horses and there he would become acquainted with any prospective buyers. The man was then brought to his home and offered vodka, and as the victim drank Komaroff would attack them from behind, either hitting them with a hammer, slitting their throat with a knife or a wire for strangulation.\n\nThe bodies were then placed inside a sack and either hidden about the family house, dumped in the Moscow River or buried in the surrounding countryside. In 1921, the first year, he committed at least 17 murders and the another 12 over the course of the next two years. In 1922, Sophia Komaroff became aware of her husbands murderous nature, but instead of being horrified, she became a active participant in his crimes.\n\nDue to the high number of disappearances, the Soviet police began an investigation which intensified after the bodies of 21 of the men who vanished were discovered. The human remains were found disposed of in garbage sacks which were dumped on the same successive Thursdays and Saturdays. After an almost two year investigation, the police were no closer to catching the killer than when the first bodies were recovered.\n\nBy early March 1923, the police came to Komaroff’s house, specifically to question him regarding the sale of illegal alcohol. It was during a search of the stable next to his home that the officers found the body of his latest victim, hidden under a stack of hay. Komaroff was somehow able to evade arrest by jumping out of a window. Several days later, on March 18, the police were finally able to arrest him in Moscow Oblast."
