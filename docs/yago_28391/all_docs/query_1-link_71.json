        "text": "Quiz Answer Key and Fun Facts\n\n1. Ivan IV 'the Terrible', the great tsar of 16th century Russia, held what title prior to becoming 'tsar'?\n\nAnswer: Grand Duke of Muscovy\n\nHe landed this title at the tender age of 3!\n\n2. Ivan IV was the first ruler to be *crowned* tsar over all of Russia.\n\nAnswer: True\n\nHe was crowned tsar, a Russian derivation of the Roman term 'Caesar', in 1547. Some of his predecessors had already used the term, however.\n\n3. Many scholars believe the sobriquet 'the Terrible' to be an improper interpretation of the title given to Ivan by his contemporaries. What is this poorly translated title?\n\nAnswer: Groznyi\n\nI suppose that for history's sake (i.e. selling books) the translation 'terrible' or 'dread' causes more titillation, but many believe it better translated as 'stern', 'formidable' or 'feared'. Ivan's life was one of angst and dissonance as he was witness to cruel punishments and violent power struggles throughout his youth.\n\n4. Ivan had a family name ending in 'vich' (meaning 'son of'). What was this family name?\n\nAnswer: Vasilievich\n\nSon of Vasili III, who united the lands of Russia.\n\n5. Prior to Ivan claiming the title czar, his mother ruled the country along with various members of the gentry class. What was Ivan's mother's name?\n\nAnswer: Elena Glinskaya\n\nElena Glinskaya was Ivan's father's second wife. He had no children from his first marriage.\n\n6. Ivan worked to consolidate the Russian state, but ran into opposition from the gentry class. He was forced to create a smaller private state from which to work, which he called what?\n\nAnswer: Oprichnina\n\nThose troublesome gentry were the boyars, whose domains were aptly termed 'zemshchina'.\n\n7. Which of the following was not a conquest of Ivan?\n\nAnswer: Pskov\n\nThe Republic of Pskov was added to the Russian empire by Ivan's father Vasili III in 1510. The other conquests, namely: Kazan (1552), Astrakhan (1556), Siberia (1581), were made during Ivan's successful imperialist reign.\n\n8. Ivan killed his eldest son in a fit of rage.\n\nAnswer: True\n\nMadness overcame Ivan, who stabbed his eldest son to death during a violent melee. This left Ivan without a competent heir, as his younger son Fedor was unable to rule, and both his sons were childless.\n\n9. Ivan was involved in what activity at the time of his death?\n\nAnswer: chess\n\nIvan became unpopular with many of his compatriots as a result of various debaucheries, executions and military failures. However, he also was known for his religious excesses and rehabilitation of 'victims'. His death was followed by a period of chaos, the legacy of this Jekyll and Hyde tsar.\n\n10. Which Russian film director created a three part epic on Ivan's life?\n\nAnswer: Eisenstein\n\nEisenstein was able to finish the first two parts of the trilogy in 1945 and 1946, but the third went unfinished (Eisenstein died in 1948). The second of the trilogy was banned in the Soviet Union until 1958 ... It could have had something to do with Stalin!\n\nSource: Author thejazzkickazz\n\nThis quiz was reviewed by FunTrivia editor bloomsby before going online.\n\nAny errors found in FunTrivia content are routinely corrected through our feedback system."
