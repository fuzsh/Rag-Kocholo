        "text": "MILITARY HISTORY OF MUSCOVY\n\n14TH -- 17TH CENTURIES\n\nJohn Sloan\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nNote: This manuscript was compiled in the early 1970's as a part of an overly ambitious effort to write a military history of Russia from the 8th to 19th centuries. It has resided in my file cabinet since then, along with many other fragments of the projected full history. The original manuscript is in the form of a book, including index and footnotes. Reformating it for the Web, I was unable to retain the proper alighment for these and other parts of the chronological sections. Therefore, the page numberings given here do not relate to this version of the text. However, I hope this rendition will be of some interest to students of Russian and of military history.\n\nIn the last 20 years or so we have been favored with a huge flood of new books and articles in Russian and English on various aspects of Russian military history. I am reviewing these and will be adding them to the bibliography. Especially important are the following: Alexander Filjushkin's Ivan the Terrible: A Military History - ; Carol Stevens' Russia's Wars of Emergence 1460-1730 - , and Brian L. Davies' Warfare, State and Society on the Black Sea Steppe, 1500-1700 - . But so far I have not found a general military history of the entire 1100 years or so. We have published on the Internet Web some articles, especially the work of Dr. Col. Dianne Smith on the Army of Ivan IV. We published in Gorget and Sash several articles as well. All of these plus some of the other fragments that pertain to the 14th - 16th centuries have been hyperlinked to this essay. Hopefully, we will be able to add the extensive material already compiled for the 17th and 18th centuries and expand the material linked here related to earlier centuries as well.\n\nFor convenience I list several of the related sections that have been placed on the Internet in recent years:\n\nAn attempt at a comprehensive listing of the over 800 princes and their family relationships and a listing of those who were acknowledged as chief - that is grand prince or tsar In addition there should be links between the sections on leading individuals in this book and their entries in the 'rulers' data base.\n\nAn interesting wax museum that was in Simbirsk in 1997 with figures for Romanovs and some others.\n\nA summary chronology focused on military related events - much in need of expansion,\n\nA graphical display that attempts to depict the many simultaneous wars in which Muscovy-Russia and its neighbors were involved. I use this opportunity also to establish links to related Encyclopedia Britannica articles. I hope eventually to create links to Wikipedia articles as well.\n\nCHAPTER ONE 1 - INTRODUCTION 1\n\nCHAPTER TWO - EAST EUROPEAN STATES IN 14 -16TH CENTURIES 2\n\nMoscow, Principality of 2\n\nMoscow, Kremlin 4\n\nNovgorod, Principality of 5\n\nRiazan, Principality of 6\n\nRostov, Principality of 6\n\nSmolensk, Principality of 7\n\nSuzdal, Principality of 8\n\nSviiazhsk 8\n\nTver, Principality of 8\n\nVereia 10\n\nViatka Land 10\n\nVladimir-Suzdal, Principality of 10\n\nOther Russian towns 11\n\nSerpukhov 11\n\nSeveria - Seversk Principality - 11\n\nStarodub 11\n\nLithuania, Grand Principality of 11\n\nPoland 13\n\nSweden 14\n\nCossack hosts 14\n\nKhanate of Kipchak (Golden Horde) 15\n\nKhanate of Crimea 18\n\nKhanate of Kazan 19\n\nKhanate of Astrakhan 20\n\nNogai Horde 21\n\nOttoman Empire 22\n\nList of other towns, rivers, and geographic names 23\n\nCHAPTER THREE - LEADING PERSONALITIES 24\n\nDmitrii Mikhailovich of Tver 24\n\nAleksander Mikhailovich of Tver 24\n\nIvan I Danilovich 24\n\nIvan II Ivanovich 25\n\nDmitrii Ivanovich (Donskoi) 26\n\nAndrei Fedorovich Prince of Starodub 26\n\nAndrei Ivanovich 26\n\nVladimir Andreevich Khrabryi (1353-1410) 27\n\nDmitrii Konstantinovich Starshii 28\n\nAndrei Ol'gerdovich 28\n\nVasilii I Dmitrievich (1371-1425) 29\n\nVasilii Mikhailovich of Tver (?-1367) 30\n\nMikhail Aleksandrovich of Tver 30\n\nIvan Mikhailovich of Tver 31\n\nVasilii Dmitrievich Kirdiapa (?-1403) 31\n\nVasilii II Vasil'evich (1415-1462) 32\n\nVasilii Yur'evich Kosoi (?-1448) 32\n\nDmitrii Shemiaka (1420-1453) 33\n\nMikhail Andreevich Vereiskii(?

Most of the sources used to compile this chronology treat the material topically, for greater clarity. However, when the authors separate out, for example, Tatar activities for a 25 year period from Polish and these from Swedish activities, the reader often does not realize that from the point of view of the Muscovite government at the time, there may have been three separate wars going on simultaneously. By integrating all accounts into one chronological frame of reference, I hope to restore this sense of unremitting struggle. If the narrative faces the reader with the feeling of being overwhelmed by the intricacy of the shifting alliances and campaigns, it is intentional; because that must be the way the Grand Prince of Valdimir and later the Tsar of all the Russias felt about his situation. The reader should consult the cited sources for analytical treatment of this material.\n\nEven though preserving complexity is in part an objective, it is not to list every Cossack and Tatar military operation. Their raids, counterraids, ambushes, and ordinary brigandage were so often happenstance and even unpremeditated that to list them all would be equivalent to listing every black market operation in a history of the Second World War. Yet taken together, these raids presented the governments concerned with a major problem, or opportunity. Therefore, I hope that the operations that are included sufficiently represent the whole.\n\nCHAPTER TWO - EAST EUROPEAN STATES IN 14-16TH CENTURIES\n\nRussian states\n\nMoscow, Principality of -\n\nMoscow is located on the Moskva River a tributary of the Oka, which in turn is a tributary of the Volga River. The place was first mentioned in chronicles for 1147 when Yuri Dolgoruki fortified an estate on the river bank. Archeological exploration indicates that there had been earlier construction there. For Yuri it was an important strategic western outpost facing Chernigov and Riazan territories. It developed as a river port participating in the growth of trade between Europe through the Baltic and the Asia beyond the Caspian Sea. The local economy was based primairly on agriculture, but the combination of average soil and harsh climate kept this at a relatively primitive level. The region is not favored with deposits of valuable minerals either. Thus most manufactured goods were imported in exchange for the products of Russian forests such as furs and honey. In the 13th and 14th centuries the density of population was low in both urban and rural areas. In the later 15th century, reigns of Vasilii II and Ivan III, expansion of political influence was accompanied by increase in population, but this prosperity was short lived, since the wars and social unrest prevalent during the last half of the reign of Ivan IV severly damaged all facets of the economy.\n\nThe rise to political, social, and cultural supremacy of Moscow despite its serious fundamental shortcomings is astounding. Richard Hellie has compiled the statistics to show the following areas under Muscovite control during the period of this book.(1)\n\nGROWTH OF MUSCOVITE TERRITORY\n\nDATE\n\nAREA (in sq. kms.)\n\n1300\n\n47,000\n\n1462\n\n430,000\n\n1533\n\n2,800,000\n\n1600\n\n5,400,000\n\n1700\n\n15,280,000\n\nThe full story of the remarkable growth of the Principality of Moscow will not be discussed here, since it is the story of this entire book, but a few highlights will be mentioned for the reader's convenience and consideration. At the start of the 14th century Moscow still faced strong competition within its own region from both Vladimir-Suzdal and Tver. The region in turn was in competion with Novgorod and the western regions in Lithuania on one side and with the Mongol-Tatar Horde on the other.\n\nSome factors critical to the successful expansion of Muscovite influence and the city's triumph as capital of the reunited Russian state include the following:\n\nThe personal and political character of the ruling dynasty of the Danilovichi favored unity of effort. In 300 years from 1290's the family produced twelve good to superior rulers with few breaks so that by the time the line died out with Feodor Ivanovich in the 1590's there was no thought of supplanting Moscow as the capital as part of the insuing national civil war Time of Troubles. The rulers for the most part had long reigns and except for two occasions relatively uncontested successions. The rulers produced a sufficiency of eligible heirs. An important cause of family success was the introduction by Dimitrii Donskoi of a tradition of retaining at least the majority of power and territory in the hands of the eldest son, rather than continuing the medieval Rurikide family tradition of dividing the inheritance nearly equally among all male heirs. Apart for the temporarily disruptive civil war waged against Vasilii II, the family remained remarkably united against outsiders and they managed to gain and keep the loyality of most of their boyars and serving princes. They also followed an astute policy of acquiring by purchase, marriage, and subtle pressure the lands of neighboring princes as these became ripe for taking, for the most part without outright combat.\n\nThe religious and secular policies of the Orthodox Church favored Moscow. When the Metropolitan of Rus moved from Vladimir to Moscow in 1328 he brought substantial economic as well as tremendous ideological resources to the city as the growing center of resistance to and then counter offensive against the Islamic Tatars. After the fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453 Moscow also became the center of an Orthodoxy that also saw itself as successor to the former center of the one true religion with respect also to the heretical western Christians. The Russian Orthodox Church maintained a unity in bureaucratic institutions and religious doctrine even when the secular princes were attempting to assert disunity and fragmented political structures.\n\nPerhaps most important during the crucial initial years was the Danilovich family ability to maneuver itself astutely among the swirls and eddies of Mongol-Tatar politics. The first Mongol overlord, Batu, established the policy not only of governing and controling the Russian cities through an appointed local prince, but also of selecting their agent only from the house of Riurik. This may have been a natural extension of the Mongol notion that only descendants of Chingis Khan had the legitimate right to rule within the Mongol empires' various subdivisions. Of course Riurikovichi in profusion had been competing amongst themselves for the various subsidiary as well as supreme titles within Kievan Rus before the Mongols arrived.(2) There were plenty of candidates vieing to receive the Tatar yarlyk assigned with the title of Grand Prince of Vladimir and the Mongol Khans were certainly as astute as any students of Machiavelli in exploiting this rivalry for their own purposes. Thus it became a case of symbiosis or who was using whom. The yarlyk was held by princes from Vladimir or Tver until Ivan I received it from the Khan in 1326. Rival princes from Tver continued to lobby at Sarai and occasionally did receive Tatar support, but from the reign of Ivan I the princes at Moscow managed to retain the title most of the time by convincing the Khan that they would best protect his interests among the Russian people.\n\nMoscow, Kremlin -\n\nThe early history of Moscow (the town rather than the principality) is the history of the Kremlin of today. A few points may be mentioned since they are relevant to the history of fortification in Muscovy. Many medieval Russian towns were fortified. In some of the smaller villages the entire settlement might have fit inside the kremlin. As the towns grew the kremlin became like a citadel occupied only by the ruler and his officals and troops, while the town might have a longer wall around it as well. This was the case with Moscow. The first fortification was a wooden wall, at first of pine and later of oak and earth, that enclosed an area only part of the present Kremlin. The first wall was attacked many times including by the Mongols in 1237 and 1293 when the town was burned. Ivan I had the Kremlin walls extended to inclose a larger area in which he could build the cathedrals and palaces befiting the new Grand Prince of Vladimir and the Metropolitan of the Orthodox Church. The first stone wall was built between 1367 and 1382 by Dmitrii Donskoi as part of his program of preparing to resist the Tatars. It was promptly attacked by Toqutamish in 1382 and was successfully defended until he gained admitance by trickery. This wall served for another hundred years against many assaults.\n\nIn 1472 Ivan III decided to expand and strengthen the Kremlin, by then already his citadel well within the environs of greater Moscow. As befiting his new status as heir to Byzantium and having a new Italian educated wife, he sent to Italy for master architects and builders to remake his citadel into a world class masterpiece of urban architecture and fortification. The famous architect and master founder, Aristotle Fieraventi accepted the assignment and labored in Moscow from 1475 until his death in 1485. His work was continued by whole teams of Italian masters until the Kremlin was filled with many of the cathedrals one sees today and the outer wall took on the appearance it now has (except for the tops of the towers.) At that time also the Kremlin was protected on all three sides by water from the Neglinnaia River and a deep moat in addition to the Moskva River. This fortification also saw many attacks and sieges including the time during the Time of Troubles it was held by Polish troops against the resurgent national forces of Prince Pozharski.(3)\n\nNovgorod, Principality of -\n\nNovgorod was an ancient town, predating even the Varangian invasion on the 9th century. It was then the most important commerical and trade center on the route from Scandinavia to the Orient and only had to share its economic power with Kiev when the Varangians built Kiev and made it their center (1000 - 1200). The town established many colonies along the Russian rivers and lakes and displayed its importance with its official title of Novgorod the Great. In the middle 1100's Novgorod achieved independence from Kiev and continued its territorial expansion to the northeast as far as the White Sea and the Ural Mountains. The economy was based on agriculture, hunting, fishing, and extraction of the valuable products of its northern domains. These products were traded with the Hansiatic League towns along the Baltic. In addition Novgorod continued to be a major entrepot for east-west trade.(4)\n\nNovgorod had a unique form of government as a republic. The city assembly (veche) was composed of all freemen of the rural as well as urban areas, but political power was in the hands of the aristocracy of merchants and landlords. The citizens elected the Prince of Novgorod whose principal function was commander of the army.\n\nNovgorod faced a major military threat from the west and northwest when the Swedes began expansion through Finland and the German Livonian Order seized the Baltic coast (parts of modern Latvia and Lithuania). Novgorod escaped the direct assault of the Mongols in the 1240's but was forced to accept Mongol overlords and pay tribute in taxes and troops. The Swedes and Germans attempted to take advantage of this immediately, but were defeated by Prince Alexander at the Neva River and Lake Chud respectively. In the 14th century Novgorod struggled against both Tver and Moscow and used their rivalry as a means for preserving itself. With the increase in power of Lithuania Novgorod turned in that direction for assistance against its Russian neighbors. To the Muscovite grand princes this made Novgorod a threat to their goal of reuniting all the Rus lands. Novgorod's efforts reached a head in 1470 when the boyars invited Prince Mikhail Olel'kovich of Lithuania to be their prince and began negotiations toward closer union with King Casimir, but this was not a popular goal for many of the lower classes. Ivan III knew well how to exploit the internal contradictions within Novgorodian society. He promptly invaded Novgordian territories and defeated their militia at the Shelon River in 1471 and subsequently. By using a careful policy of internal subversion he annexed the area in 1478. It remained for Ivan IV to obliterate Novgorodian society and deport the population a hundred years later.\n\nRiazan, Principality of\n\nRiazan was located to the south east of Moscow, mostly south of the Oka River, and along the upper tributaries of the Don River. It therefore not only was situated to conduct trade to the north and east along the Oka and Volga and south along the Don, but also controled the critical land passage between these two river systems. It also occupied the southern border of the forest zone and northern edge of the steppe. For these reasons it was the key to Muscovite defenses against the Tatars and bore the brunt of most Tatar raids.\n\nRiazan began to develop as a separate principality in the early 12th century out of the Murom-Riazan Land. During the middle of the century it fought against the Principality of Rostov-Suzdal, finally becoming dependent on the Principality of Vladimir in the 13th century. The Mongol invasion in 1238 and after hit Riazan especially hard. Its towns were devastated and its agriculture ruined. As Riazan began to recover in the 14th century, it made use of its central location to develop as a link between the Tatars, Lithuanians, and central/northern Russians. During this century it initially sought to take the lead among the Rus principalities, but it soon found the struggle with Moscow too unequal and sucumbed to Muscovite control. At the end of the 15th century independence efforts became strong again during the reign of Ivan III in Moscow, but to no avail. In 1520 the last prince, Ivan Ivanovich, was removed and the region was annexed to Moscow in 1521.(5)\n\nRostov, Principality of -\n\nRostov became an independent principality by breaking away from Valdimir-Suzdal in 1207. Rostov is one of the most ancient of the towns in north-central European Russia and its early history is discussed under its title as part of the Principality of Rostov-Suzdal-Vladimir. The town was located northeast of Moscow. It controled as well Yaroslavl, Uglich, Mologa, Beloozero, and Ustiug. This gave it a very large domain stretching from the capital in Rostov across the bend in the upper Volga River far into the north to the banks of the Northern Dvina River. This would have given Rostov a powerful position in later political struggles. However, the Grand Prince of Vladimir, who was ruler of Rostov in the early 1200's divided his lands in typical fashion among his heirs resulting in the subsequent independence of principalities at Yaroslavl, Uglich, and Beloozero. The town was ruined along with most others by the Mongol invasion of 1238 and a subsequent attempted rebellion in 1262. During the 14th and 15th centuries the area gradually entered the growing domain of Moscow. Ivan I bought Uglich from the princes of Rostov. Ivan III bought last remaining territories in 1474.(6)\n\nSmolensk, Principality of - and\n\nThe principality was located between the principality of Chernigov and the territories of Novgorod. It was more or less independent from the middle of the 12th century until it was taken by the Lithuanians.(7) Smolensk was one of the most ancient towns in Rus owing its importance to its location near the headwaters of the Dnieper flowing south to the Black Sea, close also to the Western Dvina River flowing west to Vitebsk and Polotsk and on to the Baltic, the Volkhov and Lovat Rivers flowing north into the Baltic, and the Volga flowing east and south to the Caspian Sea. At its maximum the principality reached Lake Seliger in the north, the upper regions of the Pakhra River in the east, the Ugra and Sozh Rivers in the south, and the Dnieper River to Orsha in the west. It was one of the major towns to which the Varangians assigned a ruler in the 9th century. It is mentioned in the Primary Chronicle in 882.\n\nIn 1054 Yaroslav gave Smolensk to his son, Vyatchislav, who died soon after. The city was a scene of the conflict between Kievan rulers and those of Polotsk (Vseslav Briacheslavich). In 1097 Vladimir Monomakh gained control with general agrement of the Rurikovich family. From then it was held by various Vladimirovichi or their appointed posadniks. Vladimir's grandson, Prince Rostislav Mstislavich (1127 - 2259) declared Smolensk's independence from Kyivan Rus Under the Rostislavichi Smolensk increased in importance and power and its armies participated in the inter-princely conflicts (Monomashichi, Ol'govichi) They sent a major contingent to join the Kievan and other princes when the Mongols invaded in 1223 and suffered serious losses at the Battle on Kalka River. During this period Lithuania replaced Polotsk (which Smolensk held) and the principal threat from the north-west.\n\nSmolensk escaped physical destruction during the Mongol invasion of 1240's but came under the general control of the Khan at Sarai by the end of the 13th century (1274). The principality was subject to the usual internal and external struggles between the numerous princely Rurikovichi. This weakened its unity and exposed it to the competing pressures from Moscow and Lithuania. During the first half of the 14th century many of Smolensk's subordinate princes and boyars switched allegiance to Moscow and in 1352 the Prince of Smolensk, Ivan Aleksandrovich, was also forced to accept Muscovite control by Simeon I Ivanovich. The princes of Smolensk sought to escape Muscovite ambitions by obtaining assistance from Lithuania only to find out that they had embraced another bear. In 1386 the reigning prince, Sviatoslav Ivanovich, died in battle near Mstislavl against the Lithuanians. Both the Lithuanian king of Poland, Iagailo, and the Grand Prince of Lithuania, Vitovt, had their hearts set on taking Smolensk. This Vitovt accomplished in 1395 and again in 1404. The capture of Smolensk remained a major Muscovite goal for Ivan III and Vasilii III, who recaptured it in 1514. It was held by Ivan IV and then extensively fortified by Boris Gudonov, at which point it was considered the most formidable fortress in eastern Europe.. It was the locale for numerous campaigns and battles, most notably the heroic defense by Russian troops against the Polish army of Sigismund III who besieged it for 19 months in 1609-1611, until it was the focal point of the Smolensk War in 1632-34.(8)\n\nSuzdal, Principality of, -\n\nSuzdal became independent of Vladimir in 1217 but was reunited to Vladimir from 1218 to 1238. In the 14th century Suzdal annexed Nizhegorod Gorodets to become the Principality of Suzdal-Nizhegorod.\n\nThis principality controlled the territory along the middle part of the Nerl-Kliaz'minskaia River and the Teza River, the middle and lower parts of the Kliazma and Oka River and the middle course of the Volga River to the lower course of the Sura River. Its main centers were Suzdal, Nizhnii Novgorod, Gorokhovets, Gorodets, and Kurmysh. It was established in 1328 when the Mongols divided the lands between Alexander Vasil'evich and Ivan I. The capital was moved from Suzdal to Nizhnii Novgorod in the middle of the 14th century. The rulers of Suzdal maintained a foreign policy of balancing support from the Mongols and Novgorod against Moscow. The princes several times managed to obtain the yarlik and title of Grand Prince of Vladimir.(9) Moscow annexed Nizhnii Novgorod in 1392 and then the rest of the Suzdal principality was fragmented by the typical policy in which the rulers divided their domains among their sons until there was little left to divide. All these land holdings were gradually acquired by Moscow during the 15th century.\n\nSviiazhsk\n\nThe fortress town was built on order of Ivan IV in 1551 near mouth of the Sviiaga River in four weeks time. It was built from material floated down the Volga from Uglich. The fortress was the main base for Ivan IV's siege of Kazan.\n\nTver, Principality of -\n\nTver was the chief rival of Moscow for the leading role in the emerging Russian state in the 14th and 15th centuries. Tver had strong geographical advantages from its location near the headwaters of the Volga River. This placed it directly on the chief commerical route between Novgorod and the Baltic coast to the northwest and Suzdal and the Caspian Sea to the southeast. Tver also was situated on a network of local rivers that enhanced its communications with neighoboring cities such as Moscow, Uglich, Nizhni-Novgorod, Vladimir, and Yaroslavl. In addition to Tver there were a number of other important towns within the principality including Dorogobuzh, Klin, Kaliazin, Sashin, Staritsa, and Zubtsov. The region was relatively densely populated due to its safety within the northern forest region but location sufficiently far south to enable agriculture. With this economic base Tver was able to field as strong an army as Moscow, at least initially.(10)\n\nTver's chief problem was political. It was unable to shake off the Rus tradition in which each ruler (owner) divided his land holdings among all his sons. The result was that as fast as a strong ruler consolidated the territories his death would redivide them among his heirs. Its other political problem was that its rulers were unable (unwilling) to be sufficiently subservient to the Mongols to secure their yarlyk securely enough to provide continuity in power. In the 13th and 14th centuries and even in the 15th century the reality of Mongol power enabled the Russian ruler who curried their favor not only to gain prestige as the Grand Duke of Vladimir, but also to generate real military power over his rivals.\n\nIn the early 1300's Prince Mikhail Yaroslavich of Tver managed to obtain the title as Grand Duke of Vladimir and used it to continue promoting Tver's policy of expansion. His ambition was soon thwarted, when Yuri Danilovich of Moscow convinced the Mongol Khan Özbeg that Tver was too dangerous to Mongol rule. The Mongols made Yuri the grand prince and gave him the Khan's daughter (sister?) in marriage. Mikhail persisted and defeated Yuri in battle (see Bortenovo - 1317) at which the Khan summoned him to Sarai and executed him.(11) Then in 1327 Tver attempted a complete break with the Mongols and even executed Mongol officials as part of a popular uprising. Ivan I of Moscow was only too happy to accept the Mongol assignment to take 50,000 Mongol troops with his own to suppress Tver. Even this major setback did not deter Tver's leaders from further efforts to regain the yarlik and title as Grand Prince of Vladimir away from Moscow. In 1337 Prince Alexander Mikhailovich of Tver succeeded in obtaining the title by playing on Mongol beliefs that Moscow might now be the more powerful threat. Ivan I was not to be outdone. He insinuated that Tver was plotting independence and caused both Alexander and his son, Fedor, to be summoned to Sarai where they were executed. Ivan received the yaslik and title. His nickname - Kalitka - means moneybags and refers to his status as chief tax collector for the Mongols.\n\nYet Tver tried again in the 1370's when Prince Mikhail Alexandrovich challenged Moscow and again managed to obtain the yarlik and title only to be defeated in battle by Moscow's Dmitri Ivanovich (Donskoi). Most depressing for Tverians must have been the shock they received when, despite their refusal to participate in the Muscovite campaign against the Mongols at Kulikovo in 1380, the initially defeated Mongols turned right around and gave the title back to Moscow!\n\nDuring the civil war between Vasilii II and Dmitrii Shemiaka, Prince Boris Alexandrovich of Tver allied himself with Dmitrii in hopes that the latter's victory would deminish Moscow and enhance Tver. Vasilii's victory ruined that plan and his son, Ivan III, did not forget who his enemies were. Prince Mikhail Borisovich attempted to preserve Tverian independence by alliance with King Casimir IV of Poland. The result was that Ivan III first forced Mikhail to become a vassal and then dispatched an army to Tver that annexed the principality outright.\n\nVereia\n\nThis was a small principality located southwest of Moscow. It was first considered a separate political entity when it was granted by Dmitrii Donskoi to his son, Andrei, between 1389 and 1432. It passed to Andrei's son, Mikhail who held it until his death, when he willed it to Ivan III and it became part of the Grand Principality of Moscow.(12)\n\nViatka Land\n\nViatka land was the territory in the far northeast part of European Russia between the Northern Dvina River and the Ural Mountains. It was largely inhabited by Finno-Ugric tribes and others until they were joined by Russian colonists from Novgorod and other towns. The economy was based on fishing, hunting, agriculture, and bee-keeping. The only significant town was Khlynov (renamed Viatka in the 18th century) on the Viatka River. Toward the end of the 14th century the area came under control of Suzdal. In 1402 Vasilii I of Moscow obtained control and gave it as an appanage to his brother, Yurii of Galich. Thus it became a power base for the princes of Galich during their civil war with Vasilii II for control of Muscovy. In 1459 Vasilii II gained control, but the area remained a source of trouble and created difficulties for Muscovite campaigns against Kazan. Grand Prince Ivan III suppressed an uprising there in 1485 and then sent an army to complete the process of annexation in 1489.(13)\n\nVladimir-Suzdal, Principality of -\n\nThe golden age of Vladimir-Suzdal (also known as Rostov- Suzdal-Vladimir) was the 10th to 13th centuries. There was nothing left but the name by the time Moscow began its climb to fame, but the name was of such importance that it is well to provide a a brief summary of the history here. The principality was located between the Oka and Volga Rivers and extended as far north as Beloozero and Ustiug. Slavic settlers entered the region in the 10th century and soon made it the center of the Great Russian nation. The area is indeed the center, lying as it does accross the river route from the Baltic Sea to the Caspian Sea via the Oka and Volga Rivers and adjacent to the route from the Baltic to the Black Sea via the Dnieper River. By the end of the 11th century there were already many important towns there including Rostov, Belozersk, Yaroslavl, Murom and Suzdal. Rostov was the initial leader. Vladimir town was not founded as a fortress until 1108. In the 11th century the area came under the overlordship of Kiev. Kievan princes were established in most of the Vladimir-Suzdal towns. By the middle 12th century the Prince of Suzdal, Yurii Dolgorukii (long arm) reversed the relationship by making the region his center and building many towns and forts, including his kremlin at Moscow in 1147. From this base he conquered Kiev and took the Kievan throne, but he and his son continued to rule from Vladimir.\n\nThe 200 years of incessant warfare formed the medieval Russian military as it was to remain until the reforms initiated by Ivan III. The many princes each had their personal warband of professional cavalry and the peasants were progressively forced into dependancy to provide economic support. The princes also had to contend with the aristocracy of boyars who also maintained personal bands of fighting men. The princes of Vladimir-Suzdal constantly fought each other and to increase their control over Kiev and Novgorod. Meanwhile they campaigned against the Bulgars on the Volga and the Polovetsi on the southern steppes. Ryazan was defeated in 1177 (battle of Prusovaia gora) but Novgorod regained its independence in 1207. After Vsevolod's death in 1212 civil war resumed in ernest to such an extent that the Russian princes were in no condition to oppose the Mongols in 1238. (Not that total unity would have done them any good anyway.)(14)\n\nOther Russian towns\n\nSerpukhov -\n\nThis fortress city was an important defense post on the Oka River line. The town became the center of a principality in 1341 when Ivan created an appanage for his son, Andrei. It was then ruled by Vladimir Andreevich Khrabri from 1358 to 1410. Vladimir Andreevich brought his considerable armed forces to the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380. As a key frontier fortress (with walls built by Vladimir) it was the target of numerous Tatar attacks. Major attacks came in 1382 by Khan Tokhtamysh, in 1408 aby edigei and in 1410 by the Lithuanians led by Svidrigailo. Typically, Vladimir Andreevich divided the appanage amongst his five sons with the town itself bequethed to Ivan. In 1456 Vasilii II annexed the town and principality back into Muscovy.\n\nSeveria, Sversk, Principality of\n\nThe town and region was an early part of Kievan Rus in Desna River region and included major towns such as Chernigiv, Peryaslavl, and Novgorod Severskii. It was on the steppe- forest frontier, thus faced frequent attacks by the successive steppe nomad tribes - Pecheneg, Povolotski (Cumans). The region gained some short-lived independence while Mistislav ruled from Chernigiv. But it was then a center of the family disputes between the Ol'govichi and the Monomachshi and Davidovichi and other family clans. By the time of the Mongol conquest in 1240's the territories had been sub-divided into many appanages. These weak princedoms paid tribute to the Tatars and Lithuanians. It was then absorbed into Lithuanian domains in which it remained until the beginning of the era of this book. In the 1450's Ivan Dmitrievich Shemiaka and Ivan Mozhaiskii escaped from their loosing civil war against Vasilii II and took up residence under the Lithuanians. In 1500 their heirs agreed to transfer into the service of Ivan III, but as semi-independent appanage princes. In 1518 Vasilii III eliminated this independence But the region continued to be the scene of raids and incursions by both the Lithuanians and Crimean Tatars. During Ivan's war with Lithuania in the 1570's the region was severely damaged. It was a relatively wild frontier region. Boris Gudunov's efforts to establish more control backfired. Thus in 1604 the region was ripe to be the main avenue of approach the False Demitri used in his campaign toward Moscow. In the 17th century the area was still a scene of conflict, between Muscovy, Poland and the Cossacks.\n\nStarodub -\n\nA principality located along the middle course of the Kliazma River. It was a established as a separate appanage in 1218. The princes went into service of the Grand Prince of Vladimir at Moscow early and remained loyal. The principality eventually disintegrated into numerous noble family land holdings which were absorbed by Moscow.\n\nLithuania, Grand Principality of\n\nAt the time of the Norman occupation of Russian towns and establishment of the trade route through Novgorod and Kiev the impact of advancing civilization by passed the central Baltic coast. Then in the 13th century the initial Mongol conquest also did not reach this region along the Nieman and Western Dvina Rivers. In this area the Lithuanian tribes remained pagan. The population was engaged mostly in agriculture, raising livestock, amber production, metal working, and other trades. The separate tribes began to be replaced by a sense of belonging to a larger Lithuania in the 12th century. In the later 13th century they suddenly united and formed a strong state. Lithuanian expansion developed when its neighbor to the northeast and northwest, the Orders of Teutonic Knights in Livonia and in Prussia had begun its own aggressive policy (1200 - 1225). The Lithuanians apparently were better fighters than their cousins the Prussians and Latvians, who lost their independence.(15) See Lithuania army)\n\nSince the Novgorod - Kiev axis was practically broken this new Lithuanian grand duchy was able to expand rapidly into the void to the south, southeast, and southwest and absorb the various western Russian principalities. The first to be absorbed was Polotsk in 1307. It was soon followed by Smolensk, Chernigov, Kiev, and Volynia. By the beginning of the 15th century the grand duchy included a large territory in the basins of the upper and middle Western Dvina, Nieman, southern Bug, Dnieper, and upper Oka Rivers.(16) At this time it was a union of semi-independent principalities that were under the control of local princes descended from Rurik or Gedymin. Much of the population was Russian and the conflict between Orthodox and Catholic religions greatly weakened internal unity. Later the princes were replaced by a growing powerful aristocracy of landowners who were increasingly successful in blocking the king's policies. The first powerful ruler was Gedymin (1316- 1341). He was followed by Olgerd from 1345 to 1377 and Keistut from 1345 to 1382. Olgerd's son, Iagailo, and Keistut's son, Vitovt, fought for control. Iagailo became King of Poland as well, further complicating conditions in Lithuania. Finally the two cousins realized their conflict was only helping the Teutonic Knights to take the northern part of Lithuania. They signed several agreements that began the cooperation of Poland and Lithuania in time to organize a united army that defeated the Germans at Tannenburg in 1410. (See discussion of the reign of Vitovt). When Olgerd and Vitovt died several relatives sought the thrones until Casimir, son of Iagailo, gained the Lithuanian throne in 1440 and the Polish one in 1444. He used his personal union of Lithuania and Poland to strengthen both. He supported Vasilii II of Moscow in the civil war there and obtained recognition of his influence in Tver. He succeeded in greatly reducing the Teutonic Knight's power.\n\nBy the year of Casimir's death in 1492 Ivan III had already rebuilt Moscow's strength and was executing the first phase of his plan to regain as much of Lithuania as possible. Ivan succeeded in enticing some of the Russian princes in Lithuania to switch sides. The next grand duke of Lithuania and king of Poland, Alexander, had to defend against Ivan's full scale war. Between 1500 and 1503 the Russians occupied areas in Chernigov and Seversk, but failed to take Smolensk. The war was renewed for two years in 1506 and again from 1512 to 1522. The Lithuanians lost Smolensk despite wining several battles including Orsha. During these years the Lithuanians sought to hamper Muscovite operations by obtaining assistance from the Tatars of the Golden and then Great Horde, but to little avail. Moscow instead was quite successful in obtaining significant support from the Crimean Tatars, who were only too happy to conduct their plundering raids in Lithuanian territories.\n\nWar began again in 1558, during the reign of Sigismund Augustus (1548-1572), when Ivan IV launched his offensive against Livonia. The Crimeans supported Moscow initially, but then saw that the Russian lands were also a lucrative target and began their devastating raids against Moscow. The strain of the war was one factor in bringing about the even closer union of Lithuania with Poland signed in the treaty of Lublin in 1569. While the union brought greatly increased Polish military power to bear against Moscow, it also resulted in Poland annexing the southern part of Lithuania around Kiev and Podolia. The dynasty established by Iagailo died out making the kingship truly elective. When the Hungarian military leader, Stephan Bathory, became king he brought even more effective infantry and artillery to fight the Russians. He took Polotsk in 1579 but failed to capture Pskov in 1580-81. The war ended with Lithuania in firm control of Livonia and western areas of Russia.\n\nDuring the 17th century Lithuania had to continue to fight to keep Livonia, but against Sweden rather than Moscow, in 1600- 11, 1617-22, and 1655-60. Lithuania and Moscow struggled over Smolensk and the territory between the Dnieper and Oka Rivers. At the same time Polish resources were frequently diverted against the Tatars and Turks to the south.(17)\n\nPoland\n\nThe perennial struggle between Polish and Russian peoples was already in full swing in the time of Kievan Russia in the 10th and 11th centuries. Leaders in both areas sought to solidify their control over the remaining independent tribes and clans throughout the region of modern Poland and Ukraine. In the period 1034-1136 the rulers frequently intermarried and often supported each other against other enemies. The Mongol invasion destroyed much of southeastern Poland as well as Kievan Russia leaving the territories even more fragmented and disunited than previously. When the Polish kingdom began to develop in the early 14th century it had to contend with the power of neighboring Lithuania as well as the economic drain from the Tatar plundering raids. Poland began its period of expansion at about the same time as Moscow and Lithuania with the reign of Casimir the Great in 1333-70. The personal union of the Polish elected king and Lithuanian grand duke increased Polish activities to the east. In the south Poland exerted efforts to expand into Volynia and Galich and these too were enhanced by the union with Lithuania. During the 15th century Poland expanded further into Volynia and Podolia. While Lithuania was preoccupied with its struggle against Moscow, Poland focused its attention against the Turks in Moldavia and Hungary.\n\nAfter 1569 Poland was heavily involved in Lithuania's defense against Moscow and in defense of the Ukraine against both Moscow and the Crimeans. The Union of Lublin in 1569 brought Poland into practical contact with Moscow along the Lithuanian border, while the annexation of the Ukraine brought the two states into actual contact along a poorly defined stretch of steppe lands. Polish influence in Moscow reached a high point first with the capture of Moscow in 1604 by the pretender, False Dmitrii and then the occupation of Moscow directly by Polish troops bringing Wladislaw, son of King Sigismund III, to the Russian throne.(18)\n\nWe have added here a link to the Encyclopedia Britannica 11th edition article on Poland. - - This describes the full history from earliest known period to the mid 19th century. But the section on the 14th to 17th centuries will provide much additional information on the difficulties facing the Lithuanian- Polish rulers included here.\n\nSweden\n\nRelations between Sweden and Scandinavia in general and Kievan Russia were close in that the ruling dynasty and many of the principal retainers were Scandinavian. Kievan Rus served as a major route between Scandinavia and Byzantium. during the middle ages Novgorod superseded Kiev and a major trade center. Its relationship with Sweden included trade in which both participated as part of the international trading organization dominated by the German Hanseatic League. Novgorod also met Sweden in conflict over their penetration of the northern regions between them including Finland. In the 12th century Novgorod and Sweden fought at sea in the Baltic as well. in the 13th century the struggle increased with the crusading spirit also increased by the German knights along the Baltic shores. The Novgorod army led by Alexander of Suzdal Prince of Vladimir (Nevski) defeated a major Swedish expedition led by Larl Birger by the Neva River in 1240. Near the end of the century the Swedes built a fortress at Vyborg to block Novgorodian trade and expansion. Novgorod was strong enough to resist Swedish conquest but not strong enough to expel the Swedes from their coastal holdings. Conditions remained static until Moscow under Ivan III conquered Novgorod in 1471 and brought greatly increased Russian power to bear in their effort to acquire the Baltic coast areas.\n\nSweden was also faced with a rival to the west in Denmark. This enabled Ivan III to attempt to use Swedish conflict with Denmark to enhance his own effort to take Karelia in Finland and capture Vyborg.(19)\n\nIvan began campaign in 1495 against Vyborg but Swedish leader Sten Sture conducted his campaign in 1496 and another expedition under Svente Nilsson destroyed Russian fortress at Ivangorod built opposite Narva in 1492.(20)\n\nCossack hosts\n\nRather than insert information here we use this to reach the article on Cossacks written by Steve Stinmetz - There is additional information about the Cossacks in the Encylopedia Britannica entry on Poland cited above.\n\nMongol-Tatar States\n\nKhanate of Kipchak (Golden Horde) This is list of the Khans.\n\nThe heyday of the Golden Horde belongs to the two centuries before the period of this book, yet, since the Tatar khanates and Moscow as well all owe their ascendancy to the decline and destruction of the Golden Horde, it is necessary to mention it briefly as background to the political and military activities of the 15th century.\n\nThe Golden Horde was one of the original four parts into which Chingis Khan divided his empire administratively during his lifetime into ulus & yurts under his four sons.(21) On the conqueror's death in 1227 it became the fiefdom of his grandson, Batu, (son of Jöchi who died in 1227) and then Batu's brother, Berke (1257-66). The Horde domain eventually extended from an undefined border region along the Carpathian mountains and Dniester River on the west to the Irtysh and northern Khorezm in Central Asia on the east and from the central Russian forests in the north to the pass between the Caucasus Mountains and Caspian Sea at Derbent.(22) It included the Volga Bulgar kingdom, Crimea, Kipchak steppes, and Kuban - Terek region. Since the Mongol rulers were concerned most with controlling their fellow nomads and not with the city dwellers, but simultaneously because integrated with them, the multitude of Turkish nomads soon absorbed the few Mongols and the whole community took the name of the original group (Kipchak=Cuman=Polovetsi).\n\nWhile the ruling Tatar/Mongol tribes preserved their nomadic life, the rulers appreciated the importance and value of commercial life centered in cities and encouraged their growth within the empire. The empire thus contained a multitude of different peoples and thrived on its central location controlling East-West trade. The Horde also attempted to maintain its suzerainty over as wide a belt of neighboring settled nations as possible. Most of the Russian towns and parts of Lithuania fell into and remained in this category. Batu established his capital at Sarai Batu on the lower Volga River, near modern Astrakhan, and later Khan Uzbek moved it north to Sarai Berke, closer to modern Volgagrad. From this center their armies ranged far and wide both against their non-Mongol neighbors to the north and west and against their cousins to the east and south. During its years of ascendancy the Golden Horde allied itself with the Mamelukes of Egypt and the Byzantine Empire to curtain the power of the Mongol Il-Khans of Persia-Asia Minor. In fact the effort to gain control of the Trans-Caucasus - Azerbaijan region away from fellow Mongols became something of an obsession with the rulers of the Golden Horde and led to their downfall, when they might more easily have used their military resources to expand their empire into the Balkans and even Hungarian plain.(23) In comparison to the way their cousins took over and ruled the settled regions of China, Persia, and Central Asia directly, the Golden Horde treated the settled areas of northwest Russia leniently.(24)\n\nThe Horde itself was essentially a military state of nomadic horse archers and could muster relatively huge armies of several hundred thousand expertly skilled and physically tough warriors. These were organized carefully in units and formations based on 10's, 100's, 1,000's, and 10,000's. The cavalry carried bow and arrows, swords, lances, and lassos. Armor was light - chain mail, small round shields, conical helmets, and padded coats. The army also possessed formidable siege weaponry employed by impressed experts from sedentary peoples such as the Chinese and Greeks. The Tatar-Mongol tactics stressed rapid operational scale movement over wide areas, sudden concentration of overwhelming superiority on the battlefield, wide encirclements, and - most favored of all - the feigned retreat and subsequent ambush. These elements remained characteristic of the successor Tatar khanates.\n\nBerke's successor was Mangu Timur (1266-1280). He sided with the Ogödäi branch of the family against Kublai Khan thereby increasing the independence of the Golden Horde.\n\nAlthough the official legitimacy to rule of only direct decedents of Chingis Khan was never questioned,(25) by 1300 the power and authority of the Horde khans Tuda Mangu (1280-87) and Tula-Buqa (1287-1290) was effectively curtailed by a Tatar general from a junior Jöchid branch, Nogai, whose personal activities began the internal dissention that ultimately led to weakness and collapse.(26) The victor in this struggle was Toqtai, a son of Mangu Timur. His successor, nephew Özbeg (Uzbek) (1312-1340), brought Horde power and prestige to a new high point. It was during his reign that Tver attempted to revolt and killed Mongol officials. Özbeg sent 50,000 men with instructions to Ivan I of Moscow to use them to rectify the situation. Özbeg was succeeded by his son, Janibeg (1340-57) the last really powerful khan, and grandson, Berdibeg (1357-59). During these three reigns the Islamization of the western Tatars accelerated.(27) During Janibeg's reign the Horde suffered severely from the same plague that swept Western Europe.(28) By the 1370's the Muscovite Grand Duke, Dmitri Ivanovich had stopped sending tribute to Sarai. He successfully fought Horde incursions in 1373 and 1378. Another Tatar general, Mamai, gained effective control of the Horde from 1361 to 1380.(29) He sought to revive Horde power, especially over its western neighbors. It was he who Dmitri Ivanovich (Donskoi) defeated so soundly at Kulikovo on the banks of the Don River in 1380. In considedring that battle one should note that Mamai was himself engaged in conflict with other, more legitimate claimants to the throne at Sarai and only controled part of the forces of the Golden Horde.\n\nJust as the external power of the Golden Horde against its western neighbors was being dissipated by internal conflict, it received a new infusion from the east. In the original distribution the territories and tribes of the steppes east of the Golden Horde were given to Orda, elder brother of Batu and Berke and became known as the White Horde. After a lengthy civil war another Juichid prince, Toqtamish, succeeded with the help of Tamerlane (who was NOT a Juichid) in making himself khan of the White Horde in 1377-8.(30)\n\nToqtamish promptly used his new control of the White Horde in 1378 to vault into the saddle in control of the Golden Horde as well. He struck in 1380 right after Mamai lost at Kulikovo and destroyed his army in battle on the Kalka River near where Sübötäi had destroyed the Russians in 1223. Thus Toqtamish reunited the entire steppe from the Dniester to the Sur Darya and presented a terrible threat to the nascent Russian and Lithuanian principalities. The Russians were still self-impressed with their recent glorious victory at Kulikovo when Toqtamish's envoys came to demand the usual tribute. They refused. In 1382 the newly strengthened Horde armies destroyed Suzdal, Vladimir, Yuriev, Mozhaisk, and the burned Moscow. They went on to annihilate a Lithuanian army near Poltava. All was again in ruin for the Russians and it might have remained that way but for Toqtamish's further pretensions. As the last remaining powerful Chingizide ruler, he considered himself called upon to restore the entire empire. That meant taking on his former benefactor, Tamerlane.(31) The ensuing war from 1387 to 1398 resulted in the utter destruction of both Sarais and the dismemberment of the Horde. In this war the Russian states were required to contribute their contingents to Toqtamish's army. In his second destructive attack in 1395 Tamerlane destroyed the Horde army on the bank of the Terek River and proceeded on into Russia as far as Yelets on the upper Don River. But instead of continuing on to Moscow he turned around and sacked Azov instead, and the whole Kuban region as far as the Caucasus mountains. Toqtamish tried a comeback from Lithuania with the assistance of Grand Duke Vitovt, but the Lithuanian army lost to Timur Qutlugh, Tamerlane's appointed successor at the Horde, on the Vorskla River on August 13, 1399.(32)\n\nTamerlane not only killed many Horde warriors and their families and carried off many more into Central Asia. By destroying Sarai and Azov he effectively cut the lucrative trade routes and wrecked the commercial and productive artisan basis of Horde wealth. He redirected the caravans away from the Horde lands to south of the Caspian.\n\nTimur Qutlugh was also a Chingiside of the Orda family. His brother, Shadi-beg (1400-1407), succeeded and continued Horde campaigns against central Russia. These continued under Khan Pulad (1407-1412. In 1408 the Tatar army commanded by Idiqu (Eidiger) burned Nizhni Novgorod and Gorodets and besieged Moscow before he was finally killed by Timur. The last important figure for the Horde was Khan Kuchuk Muhammad (1423-1459) a contemporary of Vasilii II of Moscow. During his reign the separatist khanates were established at Kazan, Crimea, and Astrakhan. (see below) Finally, during his son, Akhmet's, (1460-1480) reign the Muscovite grand duke was able to regain the independence his ancestor, Dmitrii Donskoi temporarily achieved 100 years previously. On his way home from the Ugra Akhmet was killed by the leader of the Shaybanid horde from east of the Urals.\n\nHis sons, Murtaza and Seyyid Ahmed, continued mainly in alliance with Lithuania against Moscow until the Golden Horde was broken conclusively by the Crimean Tatars of Mengli Gerei in 1502. (33) During these last years the Horde re-located far to the west of its usual home, in western Ukraine and Lithuania. In 1485 Murtaza invaded Crimea and temporarily drove Mengli Gerei out again until Turkish troops reinstated Mengli Gerei again. Then in 1487 at the insistence of the Sultan, Murtaza and Seyyid Ahmed suddenly turned on their Lithuanian allies and invaded Podolia in support of Ottoman campaigns. In September Prince Jan Olbracht temporarily held them in check at Kopystrin. They continued to ravage Podolia and Volhynia until Jan Olbracht decisively defeated them again at Zaslavl' in 1491.\n\nKhanate of Crimea\n\nThe Khanate of Crimea was founded in 1430 by Hajji Gerei, a descendant of Tugha Timur, one of Batu's brothers. The earliest coins from his reign are dated in 1441-42 and he ruled until 1466. The khanate was bounded on the east by the lower Don River and on the west by the lower Dnieper River and extended northward into a \"no man's land\" roughly to the latitude of Tambov and Yelets.\n\nHajji Gerei established his capital at Bakhchisarai in 1454. His dynasty remained in power until Catherine the Great annexed the Crimea in 1783. On Hajji Gerei's death his sons struggled over the succession. The second son, Nur Devlet, was the first successor (from 1466-69 and 1475-77), but finally it was the sixth son, Mengli Gerei, who won out (1469-75 and 1478-1515). Mengli Gerei was paying a visit to his close allies the Genoese colony at Caffa in 1475 when the Ottoman sultan, Mehmed II, decided to send a naval squadron to seize the city. Mengli stood by his allies and was trapped in the city until taken to Constantinople as a Turkish prisoner. In 1475 the sultan suddenly restored him to his throne, but as his vassal. From then on the Turks ruled the southern coast of Crimea directly with a resident pasha, but the Tatars retained considerable independence within general Turkish control. They continued to mint coins and pursued a foreign policy sometimes at odds with their Turkish masters. The Tatars remained essentially nomads in the steppes and left the largely Genoese, Greek and, later Turkish population in the coastal towns to do the chores of merchants and artisans. The Tatar economy survived largely on raids in Russia and Poland to supply slaves for the Near Eastern markets. Mengli Gerei's successor was his son, Muhammad Gerei (1515 - 1523).\n\nUnder Hajji Gerei and Mengli Gerei Crimean policy was to support Moscow against their common foes Lithuania and the Golden Horde, but after Mengli Gerei removed the Horde as a serious danger in 1503 and with Moscow's increase in power over its neighbors and Lithuania the Crimean policy shifted. Muhammed succeeded in a raid to Moscow in 1521, but his repeat effort in 1523 ended on the Oka River due to Russian artillery. On his way home he was assassinated by the Nogai khan, Mamai. This brought his brother, Sahib Gerei, back from Kazan (see below).\n\nIn 1552 Ivan IV took Kazan and in 1556 he took Astrakhan. This was the time during which Devlet Gerei was gaining power in Crimea. The Ottoman Sultans began to consider Moscow as a significant opponent then and decided to try to recover Astrakhan. They wanted to build a canal between Don and Volga Rivers, which Devlet Gerei did not approve because he valued his independence. He did not favor further Muscovite expansion either. Therefor he took the payments of the Polish-Lithuanian king and mounted a series of 12 major raids on Muscovite territories, including the capital itself. In 1571 he burned Moscow. But the nomadic Tatars lacked desire to try to rule from Moscow, so they departed back to Crimea with their fresh slaves. When he returned in 1572 with his army Devlet Gerei was severely defeated at the battle of Molodoi.\n\nUnder the rule of Khan Islam Gerei II (1584-88) the Turkish ascendancy became more pronounced.\n\nThe last really independent khan was Daulet Gerei III who was replaced by the Russians in 1777 with more willing his cousin Shahin Gerei. When the Tatar nobles revolted against Shahin, the Russians arrived in full force and simply annexed the country. Shahin was exiled to Turkey where he was already out of favor for his previous support of Russia. The Turks sent him to Rhodes where they beheaded him. At least he had the distinction of being the last ruling descendant of Chingis Khan in Europe.(34)\n\nKhanate of Kazan - This is a list of the rulers\n\nThe Khanate of Kazan was established by Ulug Mahmed, another descendant of Tugha Timur, Batu's brother, who settled there in 1445 with his son Mahmudek. This khanate lasted until its final conquest by Ivan IV in 1552. The territory coincided approximately with the boundaries of the former Bulgar kingdom on the middle Volga and Kama Rivers.(35) The main population was Turkic speaking Cheremis and Bashkir tribes and Finno-Ugric speaking Mordvins and Chuvash. This Tatar Khanate was primarily agricultural with a large city population of skilled artisans in Kazan itself. Kazan owed its power to its control of north-south trade on the Volga and east-west trade across the Urals. The Tatars essentially introduced themselves as overlords, but had to share political power with a council of the local magnates. The Kazan army was composed of the cavalry warrior band directly under the khan's control, the retinues of the other lords, and militia units from the general population. Its strength was usually from 20-30,000 men with 60,000 being a maximum.(36)\n\nUlu Mohammed was assassinated by his son, Mahmudek, in 1446. Mahmudek solidified the khanate during his reign from 1446 to 1464. His successor was his son, Ibrahim, who attempted to expand the domain by taking Viatka in 1468. The Muscovites soon forced him out of that area. His two sons, Ilham and Muhammad Amin, followed family tradition by fighting over the succession. When Ilham won, Muhammad Amin sought Muscovite assistance. They sent an army to put him on the throne in 1487. Not being grateful, Muhammad Amin rebelled against Moscow in 1505 and managed to defeat a Russian army in 1506. He died in 1518 without heir. This put the throne into contention between factions supported by Crimea and Muscovy. Vasilii III gave the throne to Shah Ali, a junior prince from Astrakhan he had in residence at Kasimov. However, Muhammad Gerei managed to place his brother, Sahib Gerei, on the throne in 1521. With the two hordes united they promptly launched a campaign that reached the walls of Moscow the same year. Sahib Gerei returned to rule the Crimea in 1523 leaving Kazan to his son, Safa Gerei. Vasilii III drove him out in 1530 and set Jan Ali, Shah Ali's brother, on the throne. He did not last long. In 1535 Sahib Gerei returned from Crimea and reinstated his son, Safa Gerei, again. In 1546 Ivan IV drove Safa Gerei out momentarily and replaced him with Shah Ali once more, but no sooner were the Muscovites gone than Safa Gerei regained the throne. This time he lasted until his untimely death in an accident in 1549.(37) This enabled Ivan IV to remove his son, Otemish, and bring Shah Ali back again.\n\nOne would think that if Ivan IV had not learned by then at least Shah Ali would have. Because the local Tatars threw him out again and called in Yadiyar, a Nogai tsarevich from Astrakhan. At that Ivan IV simply ended Kazan's independence once and for all (1552). (See chapter on Ivan IV for details)\n\nKhanate of Astrakhan\n\nThe Khanate of Astrakhan was founded in 1466 by Kasim, grandson of Kuchuk Muhammad, khan of the Golden Horde. The khanate controlled the mouth of the Volga and the river valley north to the Kazan khanate. The territory was mostly on the west of the Volga River to the Don River and south to the Terek and Kuban Rivers. The khanate had little chance for success even before Ivan IV conquered it in 1556 because it was caught between the powerful Crimean Tatars to the West and the Nogai Tatars to the East (centered on the Ural River).\n\nNogai Horde\n\nThe Nogai Horde was another of the successor states of the Golden Horde. It was the true remnant in which the essential nomadic characteristics of the original horde were preserved best. (The Crimea Khanate retained more of the Mongol bureaucratic administrative practices.) The Nogai Horde claimed control of the steppe from the area between the Don, Terek, and Volga Rivers (which it disputed with the Crimeans) past the Ural River to north of the Caspian Sea, where it disputed lands with the successors of the White Horde.\n\nThe Nogai Horde was founded as a separate group around 1391 by Idiqu (Idiqu), the same Tatar general mentioned above who besieged Moscow in 1408. Idiqu was also a Mangkyt Mongol and the Nogai's generally referred to themselves as Mangkyt ulus. The Nogai's gained further strength under Idiqu's son, Nuraddin (r. 1426-1440).\n\nThis group retained its pristine nomadic character while the Tatars at Kazan and Crimea succumbed more to the sedentary life of the cities they controlled. The Nogai economy remained based on herding horses, sheep, camels, and cattle until the Russian Revolution brought collectivization. They lacked houses and towns but lived in typical Mongol yurts. For a short time they had a capital at Saraichik, but it was destroyed by Tamerlane in 1395 and then by the Cossacks in 1580. Each year they brought as many as 50,000 horses to Moscow for sale in exchange for weapons and other manufactured products.\n\nThe route from the Volga to Moscow, called the \"Nogai Road\", was not only a trade route, but also a major route for raiding parties. The trail stretched from the lower Volga River in two axes, one along the right bank of the Don River past the site of modern Voronezh to Riazan and Kolomna, and the other from Tsaritsyn along the Don to the region between the Khoper and Sura Rivers, thence across the Tsna, Pol'nyi, and Lesnyi Voronezh Rivers to Riazhsk, and Riazan.(38)\n\nThe ruler of the Nogais was from the dynasty of Nuraddin. In addition there were two principal military leaders corresponding to the eastern and western parts of the Nogai territories. These were the nuraddin and the kekovat. Below these leaders there were several murzas.\n\nThe Nogais derived some of their importance and power from their key location that blocked the passage between the Caspian Sea and Aral Sea on the south and the Ural mountains on the north. From this position they could participate in the trade between East and West and extract their fee. Their initial rise to prominence came with the decline and destruction of the Golden Horde. Their period of ascendancy also began to end with the Muscovite conquest of Kazan in 1552 and of Astrakhan in 1556. The Muscovite control of the Volga split the Nogai east and west of the river and soon ended their independence. They became divided into a pro-Muscovite majority party and an anti-Muscovite minority. In 1552 Murza Ismail, a leader of the majority party, petitioned Tsar Ivan IV to assume control over the Horde and in 1555 Ismail recognized Ivan as his suzerain. This dependency was renewed in 1564 and 1587. In 1600 Tsar Boris Godunov brought the Great Nogai Horde formally under complete Russian control, while keeping the local leader, Murza Ishterev, as head of the Horde.\n\nWhen Murza Ismail recognized Muscovite supremacy the Lesser Nogai Horde broke off and migrated west to an area between the Kuban River and the Northern Caucasus Mountains, near where they continue to live to this day. This Horde became a vassal of the Khan of the Crimea and made itself available to participate in Crimean Tatar expeditions.\n\nActually despite their recognition of Muscovite supremacy the Great Nogais also conducted their share of plundering raids against Moscow and other Russian towns. The Great Nogais were not controlled by Moscow, but were overcome eventually by a still more powerful nomadic group, the Kalmyks, who arrived from the east in the 1630's. The Kalmyks took over all the Nogai lands east and west of the Volga and then recognized Russian supremacy. The Kalmyks proved to be valuable allies and effective warriors for Peter the Great and other Tsars. Meanwhile the remanents of the Great Nogais either were assimilated into the Kalmyk clans or retreated westward to rejoin and merge into the Lesser Nogais.(39)\n\nOttoman Empire\n\nUnfinished - a study of the Ottomans will require fluency in Turkish and access to their archives.\n\nList of other towns, rivers, and geographic names\n\nOthers\n\nCHAPTER THREE - LEADING PERSONALITIES\n\nRussians\n\nThese are a selected few from the more complete listing of princes and their families found at\n\nDmitrii Mikhailovich of Tver (Groznii Ochi) (1299-1326)\n\nHe was the son of Grand Prince Mikhail Yaroslavich. He obtained support from Lithuania in his struggle to gain the title of Grand Prince of Vladimir. He denounced Yuri Danilovich of Moscow to the Tatar Khan Özbeg in 1322 in order to obtain the yarlik. When Yuri Danilovich complained, Özbeg ordered Dmitrii Mikhailovich to appear. In 1325 Dmitrii murdered Yuri at Sarai, whereupon Özbeg executed Dmitrii.(40)\n\nAleksander Mikhailovich of Tver (1301-1339) -\n\nHe was the second son of Prince Mikhail Yaroslavich and became both Grand Prince of Tver and Grand Prince of Vladimir in 1326 on the execution of his elder brother. In 1327 he was blamed for the rebellion that broke out in Tver in which the Tatar officials and merchants were killed. Ivan I promptly used this excuse to side with the massive Tatar army of retribution. Aleksander fled to Pskov with Ivan chasing after him and, when the Orthodox Metropolitan laid an interdict on the city, he then fled to Lithuania. He returned to Pskov in 1331 with Lithuanian support. In 1337 we went to Sarai where enough was forgiven him for him to receive his title as Grand Prince back. By 1339 Ivan I managed to incite the Khan again and Aleksander was executed at Sarai along with his son, Fedor.\n\nAfanasii Ivanovich\n\nHe was a son of Ivan Romanovich Neblagoslovennii Svistun, prince of Yaroslavl. He became appanage prince of Shekhon, a late created udel. . The Shekonski udel was divided out of the Yaroslavl principality in the 15th century and received its name from a small fortress on the bank of the Sheksn river near its confluence with the Volga. The first udel prince was Afanasii.\n\nAleksandr Ivanovich Brukhatii - ca 1418\n\nHe was the only son of Ivan Borisovich Tug Luk, appanage prince of Niznigorod. He also was prince of Nizhnigorod..\n\nAleksandr Ivanovich - 1378 - 1425\n\nHe was a son of Ivan Mikhailovich, grand prince of Tver and his first wife, Maria Keistutovna, princess of Lithuania. He was appanage prince of Starits from 1402 and then grand prince of Tver in 1425.\n\nIvan I Danilovich \"Money bags\" (? -d. 1344) -\n\nHe was the fifth son of Daniil, Prince of Moscow, and grandson of Alexander Nevskii, Grand Prince of Vladimir. He succeeded his brother, Yurii III as Prince of Moscow in 1325, when Yuri was murdered by Dmitrii Mikhailovich, and became Grand Prince of Vladimir in 1328. Ivan had eight children with his first wife, Elena, and at least one with his second, Ul'iana. He served his brother well and kept Moscow from the internal civil war that so often weakened the Russian principalities. He then ascended the throne without having to contend with uncles or nephews.\n\nIvan labored under the twin burdens of Tatar massive military superiority and expanding military power from a newly united Lithuania. Closer to home he faced the continued pretentions of Tver for leadership of the Russian principalities and the opposition of princes and boyars within the Principality of Moscow. He was exceptionally shrewd in using his economic power as Grand Prince to obtain support within Russia and in using financial and other inducements to insure that the Tatars would assign him the title of Grand Prince. He encouraged the Orthodox Metropolitan of Kiev and All Russia to live in Moscow, greatly strengthening the claim of this city to ideological preeminence and bringing it significant practical economic enhancement through the church's economic activity.(41) Ivan's reign was considered a period of exceptional peace by contemporaries, which gives a good indication of just how endemic warfare was the rest of the time. Actually the period contained a considerable amount of warfare against Tver, Novgorod, and Lithuania. Only on the Tatar front was there a relative respite from plundering raids, and that was purchased by Ivan at the cost of expensive tribute that he raised by his own exactions throughout Muscovy. He also reduced the relative level of common crime and number of brigands roaming the lands, for which the chroniclers duely praised him.\n\nIvan divided his domain in thirds for his sons. His first son, Simeon I, ruled as Grand Prince from 1341 to 1353 and his second son, Ivan, followed Simeon from 1353 to 1359. The third son was Andrei Ivanovich, Prince of Serpukhov, who also died in the plague of 1353. Ivan journed to Sarai a last time to secure Khan Özbeg's seal on his will in order to insure the succession to Simeon. Since at this time the title of Grand Prince of Vladimir was not his to dispose of, Ivan hoped that this last sign of loyalty would induce Özbeg to give the title to Simeon.\n\nChronology:\n\n1302 - Ivan sent to Pereyaslavl Zaleski to gain loyalty of people\n\n1317 - He is sent to Novgorod, he obtains the city support against Tver. But in December 1317 Tver defeate Moscow at Bortenovo.\n\n1320 - He goes to Tatar capital at Sarai total of 9 times, in 1320 he stayed two years\n\n1322-25 Dmitrii Mikhailovich Grozni Ochi of Tver kills Yuri III Danilovich at Sarai and then the Khan executes him. Ivan is on second visit to Sarai but in 1326 Khan gives yarlik to Aleksandr Mikhailovich of Tver\n\n1325 - Ivan succeeds his brother, Yuri III, as prince of Moscow.\n\n1326 - Metropolitan Peter lays corner stone for Uspenski (Assumption) Cathedral in Moscow\n\n1327 - revolt at Tver, Ivan goes to Sarai to obtain Tatar troops and returns with Fedorchuk and Turalyk and 50,000 Tatars. Aleksandr Mikhailovich escapes to Pskov where he is made prince. Ivan goes with army to Pskov. Novgorod supports Ivan against Pskov. Aleksandr flees to Lithuania.\n\n1328 - Ivan gets yarlik as Grand Prince of Vladimir along with Aleksandr of Suzdal. Konstantin Mikhailovich replaces his brother at Tver.\n\n1331 - Ivan again visits Sarai to get the yarlik as grand prince.\n\n1331 - Gedemin launches Lithuanian offensive and Novgorod, Pskov and Tver are now pro-Lithuania. Ivan has to defeat Lithuania while remaining in the khan's favor, so he allies with Tatars against Lithuania. Aleksandr Mikhailovich returns to Pskov again as prince. The khan then gives Aleksandr Mikhailovich back Tver and he replaces his brother, Konstantin, who ruled while he was away. Konstantin had been Ivan's ally. (Some date this change to 1337).\n\n1332 - Novgorod resists Ivan's heavy Tatar taxes - Ivan invades Novgorod border towns, Novgorod supports Lithuania.\n\n1333 - Ivan's son, Semyon, marries as a second wife, Anastasia, Lithuanian princess, daughter of Gedymin but border war continues.\n\n1335 - Ivan returns to Novgorod to make peace, on the return trip he attacks Lithuanian border towns.\n\n1336 - Ivan again goes to Sarai, complains about Aleksandr.\n\n1337 - Ivan again sends army against Novgorod to collect taxes.\n\n1338-9 Ivan goes to Sarai again to get khan's approval of his will and testament. According to his will, Ivan bought Beloozero, Uglich and Galich, but left the local princes in charge.\n\n1339 - Khan Ozbeg executes Alexandr Mikhailovich and Konstantin Mikhailovich is restored to Tver\n\n1340 - Ivan takes Tatar army against Smolensk but looses heavily.\n\nMetropolitan Peter (1303-26) sides with Ivan and Moscow. Then Metropolitan Theogonst (1328-53) comes from Constantinople and chooses to live at Moscow. Ivan stayed close to both metropolitans.\n\n1344 - Ivan dies\n\n1348 - Novgorod appeals for assistance against Sweden and Livonian knights but Ivan I's son, Ivan Ivanovich, as commander of army does not respond.\n\n1352 - Campaign with Tatars to Smolensk\n\nIvan II Ivanovich (1326-1359) -\n\nHe was the second son of Ivan I Danilovich (Kalita) and Prince of Zvenigorod. He ruled as Grand Prince of Moscow from 1353 to 1359 and Grand Prince of Vladimir from 1354 to 1359. He came to the throne on the death of his elder brother, Simeon I, in the devastating plague that also took many of his other relatives and potential rivals. He married twice and had three children. During his brother's reign, Ivan served him well, leading Muscovite campaigns against Lithuania.\n\nIvan at first followed his father's and brother's policy of maximum catering to the Tatar Khans in order to reduce Tatar depredations against Moscow and secure Tatar support for Moscow's depredations against its neighbors. Later, as he perceived that Tatar power was somewhat weaker and Lithuanian power growing stronger, he began careful efforts to switch positions. This brought out strong internal opposition from supporters of the previous policy. With his own boyars and the Orthodox church leaders in open revolt and the still powerful Golden Horde perparing action Ivan had to acknowledge his mistake and make the ritual journey to Sarai to receive the new Khan Berdi-beg's approval. He then reopened war with Lithuania and Tver.(42)\n\nIvan divided his possessions into the customary thirds giving the heirs inalienable rights to their inheritances. His principal heir was Dmitrii Ivanovich (Donskoi)\n\nChronology:\n\n1352 - Lithuanian offensive stopped by Muscovite and Tatar army. Ivan campaign toward Smolensk.\n\n1353 - Ivan goes to Sarai to obtain yarlik as soon as Semyon died. jannibeg endorses Ivan\n\n1348 - Livonian knights and Swedes attack Novgorod but Ivan fails to help.\n\n1353-8 - Lithuania occupies Rzhev and wins victories near Smolensk and Bryansk Ivan does not support , Ivan allies with the pro-Lithuanian factors in Suzdal - Ivan then changes policy.\n\n1357 - 1357 Internal revolt and popular pressure force Ivan to resume conflict against Lithuania and return to alliance with Golden Horde. Andrei Khvut, the chiliarch, is murdered. Some boyars leave Ivan for Ryazan. Metropolitan Aleksei also pressures Ivan against Lithuania. Kypchak horde becomes a threat. Ivan surrenders position and goes to Sarai to Khan Berdibeg and renews conflict with Lithuania.\n\n1358 - Ivan's testament prepared\n\n1359 - Ivan's army again at Smolensk, also renewed civil war in Tver.\n\nDmitrii Ivanovich (Donskoi) (1350-1389) -\n\nHe was the son of Ivan II and Ivan's second wife, Aleksandra, born while his uncle, Simeon, was the ruling Grand Prince. In 1353 Simeon died together with his surviving sons and his brother, Andrei of Serpukhov. This left the inheritance open without multiple divisions not only to Dmitrii's father, Ivan II, but also to himself. Ivan divided his possessions between Dmitrii, his brother, Ivan, and his cousin, Vladimir Andreevich of Serpukhov. But Ivan Ivanovich also died young returning his possessions back to Dmitrii. Dmitrii was only nine when his father died. The Orthodox Metropolitan Aleksei served as regent for the young princes. Dmitrii took more direct control of policy in 1367. He continued the tradition of outmaneuvering other claimants to the Tatar yarlik to secure support and devote Muscovite resources to the battle against Lithuanian expansion. Despite his stunning victory over the Tatars under Mamai in 1380 he still retained the all important yarlik. He married Evdokia of Suzdal in 1366 with whom he had twelve children. He died relatively young in 1389 under suspicious circumstances. He once again divided the principality among his five sons and Vladimir Andreevich, setting up the scene for the subsequent civil war between his son, Yuri Dmitreivich, and his grandson, Vasilii II.(43)\n\nChronology\n\n1357-1381\n\nThis is a period of internal conflict in the Golden Horde during which there are at least 25 khans. Dmitrii Ivanovich makes use of this turmoil to strengthen Moscow.\n\n1362\n\nMuscovite armies drive Dmitrii Konstantinovich of Suzdal out of Vladimir and Pereiaslavl.\n\n1363\n\nMuscovite armies drive the Suzdal forces from Vladimir again and set up a supporting prince in Rostov.\n\n1364\n\nMuscovite armies force Nizhnii Novgorod to take Dmitrii Konstantinovich as prince. Ivan Ivanovich dies leaving his territories to Dmitrii.\n\n1365\n\nGrand Prince Oleg Ivanovich of Riazan brings troops from Prinsk, Kozel'sk and Riazan to defeat a Tatar raid.\n\n1366\n\nMuscovite armies support Nizhnii Novgorod expansion eastward along Volga River against Mordvinian and Bolgar regions.\n\n1367\n\nOl'gerd of Lithuania supports Tver against Moscow.\n\n1367-1382\n\nDmitrii Ivanovich and Vladimir Andreivich build first stone walls for Moscow kremlin in time to resist sieges by Lithuanians.\n\n1367\n\nDmitrii Ivanovich sends troops to support Novgorod and Pskov against Livonia and places his local official in charge in Novgorod. He also starts attacks against Smolensk and Briansk and he supports Vasilii Mikhailovich of Kashin against Mikhail for control of Tver.\n\n1368\n\nOl'gerd conducts surprise attack and siege of Moscow without success.\n\n1370\n\nDmitrii with assistance from Riazan attacks Briansk and Tver and forces Mikhail to flee to Lithuania. Ol'gerd brings Lithuanians and troops from Smolensk to besiege Moscow again, for eight days. Dmitrii commands the defense of the city while Vladimir Andreevich and the princes of Riazan led by Vladimir Yaroslavich of Prinsk lead field armies against the Lithuanians.\n\n1371\n\nMikhail attacks Kostroma and seizes several towns including Uglich. Dmitrii is busy with troops fighting Oleg Ivanovich of Riazan to install his cousin, Vladimir Yaroslavich as prince. Oleg regains the town with the aid of Tatar chieftain Murz Salakhmir.\n\n1372\n\nMikhail in alliance with Lithuania captures Dmitrov and urges the Lithuanians to attack Periaslavl. Ol'gerd musters his army to attack Moscow. Dmitrii sends a large army that defeats the Lithuanian advance guard at Liubutsk and then forces Ol'gerd to sue for peace. Both Oleg and Vladimir of Riazan support Dmitrii's campaign. Dmitrii Konstantinovich of Suzdal constructs stone kremlin at Nizhnii Novgorod.\n\n1373\n\nMikhail returns the towns and booty in exchange for his son, held by Dmitrii. The Tatars under Mamai raid Riazan, forcing Oleg to seek support from Moscow. Vladimir Andreivich brings his troops from duty in Novgorod to defend the Oka River.\n\n1374\n\nIvan V. Veliamninov (the son of the last commander of the Moscow militia deposed by Dmitrii)and a Moscow merchant, Nekomat, defect to Tver.\n\n1375\n\nNekomat obtains title to the Grand Principality of Vladimir for Mikhail. Dmitrii then brings a large army of troops from Moscow, Vladimir-Suzdal, Briansk, Kashin, and the Oka river valley to attack Tver. Ol'gerd fails to support Mikhail and the Tatars also do not intervene. Mikhail agrees to a treaty subordinating himself to Dmitrii, but does not live up to it. Oleg of Riazan acts as mediator in this agreement to obtain support against Tatars.\n\n1376\n\nDmitrii attacks Rzhev to retaliate against Ol'gerd's attacks on Smolensk.\n\n1377\n\nDmitrii conquers Bolgar on the Volga and obtains tribute. The combined Muscovite - Suzdalian army is defeated on the P'iana River by Tatars and Mordvinians who then sack Nizhnii Novgorod. At the same time the Tatars raid Oleg's capital at Pereiaslavl Riazanskii.\n\n1377\n\nDmitrii returns to devastate Mordvinian lands.\n\n1378\n\nTatars raid Riazan and then Dmitrii defeats Tatar army of Mamai on the Vozha River. The Riazan prince Daniil of Pronsk participates with Dmitrii. Mamai (a Tatar temnik) used these years to strengthen his control of the western part of the Golden Horde.\n\n1378\n\nOl'gerd's brother, Keistut, opposes Ol'gerd's son, Iagailo, for Lithuanian throne. Dmitrii sends army to Briansk in support.\n\n1379\n\nIagailo negotiates with Mamai against Moscow, but is blocked from supporting by pressure from Keistut and the Teutonic Knights. Oleg of Riazan tries to play Tatars against Muscovites, but Tatars devastate Riazan anyway and drive Oleg across the Oka River, forcing him to abandon Dmitrii. Tver and Nizhnii Novgorod also remain neutral, but Novgorod sends troops in support.Dmitrii musters his forces against the Tatar threat.\n\n1380\n\nMamai marches north up the Don river valley. Dmitrii crosses the Don and meets him at Kulikovo Field. (The chronicles give 80,000 casualties on both sides.) Battle of Kulikovo Pole - The victorious Russian army is plundered by Lithuanians (or Riazantsi) on the way home.\n\n1381\n\nDmitrii sends his governor to Riazan driving Oleg out. Oleg agrees to subordinate himself and Riazan to Moscow. Toqtamish reunites Golden Horde after killing Mamai. Dmitrii sends gifts. Dmitrii concludes treaty with Keistut.\n\n1382\n\nToqtamish favors Iagailo who drives Keistut out of Vilna and kills him. Toqtamish takes Russian vessels on Volga River and attacks Riazan and Nizhnii Novgorod. Dmitrii hurriedly assembles troops but retreats to Kostroma. His family flees Moscow. The townspeople organize their own defense with leadership from a Lithuanian prince Ostei. Toqtamish with assistance from Dmitrii Konstantinovich of Suzdal tricks defenders into opening gates. The Tatars sack and burn the city killing abut 24,000. Toqtamish does not attack Dmitrii's army at Kostroma and Vladimir Andreevich defeats a Tatar detachment at Volokolamsk. Oleg attempts to divert the Tatars away from Riazan territory during this campaign, but fails with the result that his lands are devastated by both the Tatars and the pursuing Muscovites. Toqtamish returns to Sarai leaving Moscow in ruins and its prince greatly weakened. He demands the eldest sons as hostages from all the princes.\n\n1382\n\nDmitrii again attacks Riazan.\n\n1383\n\nDmitrii places heavy taxes on Novgorod to pay the heavy Tatar tribute. Oleg attacks Kostroma while Dmitrii is busy with Novgorod. Oleg defends successfully against retaliation launched by Vladimir Andreevich. Iagailo decides to marry Polish Queen, Jadwiga, rather than Dmitrii's daughter and convert Lithuania to Catholicism rather than Orthodoxy.\n\n1386\n\nDmitrii's son, Vasilii, escapes from being hostage at Sarai to Moldavia and then Lithuania.\n\n1387\n\nDmitrii makes peace with Riazan. Dmitrii's daughter, Sofia, marries Oleg's son Fedor of Riazan. Dmitrii sends large army against Novgorod\n\n1388\n\nDmitrii assists sons of Dmitrii Konstantinovich of Suzdal to take Nizhnii Novgorod. Rodoslav of Riazan escapes from Sarai and Tatars raid territory. Dmitrii arrests Vladimir Andreevich and his boyars to force them to recognize Vasilii as senior.\n\n1389\n\nDmitrii dies. His son, Vasilii I, becomes grand prince of Moscow. Another Tatar raid against Riazan.\n\n1390\n\nTatar raid against Riazan.\n\n1394\n\nOleg of Riazan decisively defeats Tatars. Oleg begins conflict with Vitovt of Lithuania. Both sides conduct campaigns against the other.\n\n1395-98\n\nContinuing war between Riazan supported by Tatars and Lithuania\n\n1399\n\nTatar leader Edigei defeats Vitovt at Vorskla River.\n\n1401\n\nOleg with allies from Prinsk and Murom attacks Smolensk\n\n1402\n\nOleg sends his son, Rodoslav, to capture Briansk, but he is captured. Oleg dies, ending Riazan's last effort to gain supremacy. Fedor Ol'gevich signs treaty with his brother-in-law, Vasilii I of Moscow, subordinating Fedor to the equal status with Vasilii's eldest brother Yurii. Fedor's daughter married Ivan Vladimirovich, son of the Prince of Serpukhov\n\nAndrei Fedorovich Prince of Starodub -\n\nHe was the third son of Fedor Ivanovich Blagovernii, appanage prince of Starodub. He became appanage prince of Starodub in 1363 when Dmitrii Donskoi threw his older brother out for siding with Dmitrii Konstantinovich. Andrei agreed to subordinate his policy in Starodub to Moscow. He was a military commander of Dmitri Donskoi against Tver in 1375 and commander of the Russian right flank at the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380\n\nAndrei Ivanovich (1327-1353) -\n\nHe was the third son of Prince Ivan I Danilovich and Yelena. He was appanage prince of Serpukhov from 1341 to 1353. He married Ul'yana and then about 1345 Maria, daughter of Ivan Fedorovich, prince of Galich. Their sons were Ivan and Vladimir Andreevich Khrabrii, appanage prince of Serpukhov. Andrei died during the great plague in Moscow along with his older brother, Semyon and the latter's family. This opened the way to rule to the younger brother, Ivan II.\n\nVladimir Andreevich Khrabryi (1353-1410)(44) -\n\nHe was the son of Prince Andrei Ivanovich and grandson of Ivan I of Moscow. Two of his uncles who ruled Moscow as Simeon I and Ivan II died early, but his father, Andrei Ivanovich (Prince of Serpukhov), also died young as did his elder brother, Ivan Andreevich. All this brought Vladimir's first cousin, Dmitrii Ivanovich, to the throne in Moscow, but greatly enhanced Vladimir's lands and power as well. His title was Prince of Serpukhov and Borovsk. He was one of the greatest military commanders of 14th century Russia and a strong ally and supporter of Dmitrii Ivanovich Donskoi and Dmitrii's son, Vasilii I, in their place as Grand Princes of Muscovy and Vladimir. The two cousin's first joint military campaign took place in 1362.(45) In 1367 they began construction of the first white stone walls to enlarge the Kremlin in Moscow, for which Vladimir contributed men from his appanage. This turned Moscow into the only first rate stone fortress in northeastern Russia.\n\nThroughout his life Vladimir Andreevich fought Dmitrii's battles against Tver, Riazan, Novgorod, Lithuania, and the Tatars. In 1370, when the Lithuanians advanced on Moscow again in support of Tver, Dmitrii held the city while Vladimir took a field army to L'vov, deep in the Lithuanian rear area. This daring move aborted the Lithuanian campaign and gained for Vladimir added lands from Dmitrii and the hand of the Lithuanian princess Elena from her father, Ol'gerd. In 1373 the Golden Horde Tatars under Mamai attacked and sacked the Riazan area, but Dmitrii and Vladimir each brought their armies to the Oka River to prevent a Tatar attack on Moscow. In recognition of the recurrent Tatar threat, the next year Vladimir fortified one of his villages, Serpukhov, on the Oka River 56 miles south of Moscow. This fortress became a major center of Russian defenses against the Tatars for the next 200 years, until its importance was reduced by Russian expansion far to the south.\n\nThe remainder of the 1370's was spent in warfare against Tver and Lithuania. The cousins devastated Tver in 1375 forcing Mikhail of Tver to submit. By 1380 Mamai was ready to try his strength against Moscow again. In alliance with the Lithuanians he brought the full Tatar host against Moscow. Once again Vladimir brought his troops to his cousin's assistance and himself took command of a major part of the battle. Along with part of Dmitrii's troops, he led his forces in an ambush position from which his attack against the Tatar flank gained the victory for the combined Russian armies. The battle was at Kulikovo field near the Don River and was renowned as the most famous Russian victory over the Mongols. Dmitrii received the honorific Donskoi and Vladimir the honorific Krabryi (the brave). Unfortunately the victory was short lived. The new Tatar Khan, Toqtamish, returned with a stronger army in 1382. With both Dmitrii and Vladimir were out of Moscow mobilizing their armies, Toqtamish captured the city by a ruse and then plundered it and many other Russian towns. Vladimir managed to defeat one of the Tatar detachments, but the damage was done and the Grand Prince had to resume paying tribute to Sarai. The disaster prompted Vladimir to make an agreement with Dmitrii's son and successor, Vasilii I, in 1390 that specified that in case of danger one or the other would be in the city at all times.\n\nDuring the 1380's Vladimir continued to lead his army in support of Dmitrii; for instance, against Novgorod in 1385. Relations between Vladimir and Dmitrii were strained in the later 1380's, but Vladimir agreed to a treaty recognizing Dmitrii's son as successor. After Vasilii I came to the throne in 1389, Vladimir briefly asserted his potential to support Tver, but did not defect. He continued to support Vasilii against the Tatars. In 1395 Moscow faced the most serious threat yet when Tamerlane approached, having already disposed of Toqtamish. While Vasilii led the field army to block the Oka River crossing at Kolomna, Vladimir prepared Moscow for the coming siege. Tamerlane changed his mind and retired after destroying Yelets and ravaging the region of the upper Don River valley. Vladimir's final military service came in 1408 when the Tatars again appeared, this time under Idiqu. With Vasilii out of the city at Kostroma Vladimir again organized and commanded the defense. Idiqu besieged the city for three weeks, but Vladimir's careful preparations and able leadership enabled the latter to hold the Kremlin until the Tatars departed.(46) Vladimir Andreevich died in 1410 leaving his lands to two sons. His granddaughter, Maria, became the wife of Vasilii II.\n\nDmitrii Konstantinovich Starshii (1323?-1383) -\n\nHe was Prince of Suzdal from 1356 and Grand Prince of Suzdal and Nizhegorod from 1365 until 1383.(47) Initially he fought against Dmitrii Ivanovich Donskoi for the title of Grand Prince of Vladimir. He held the title between 1360 and 1363, while Dmitrii Ivanovich was a teenager. When his brother, Boris Konstantinovich, began to oppose him and claim the titles, Dmitrii Konstantinovich was forced to ally himself with Dmitrii Ivanovich and give his daughter, Evdokiia, to him in marriage in 1366. The two Dmitrii's then campaigned together to expand Russian control eastward into the lands of the Mordvinians and Volga Bulgars. His troops were defeated along with the Muscovite contingents by the Tatars in the battle on the P'iana River in 1377. He began conversion of the kremlin in Nizhnii Novgorod to stone in 1372. Dmitrii Konstantinovich attempted to supplant Moscow in favor with the Tatars in 1382 by sending his sons to serve Toqtamish and assisting the Khan in capturing Moscow. (See Vasilii Dmitrievich Kirdiapa) Dmitrii Konstantinovich's son, Semyon, began the cadet branch of the family which became the Shuiski clan which disputed the throne with Boris Gudunov.\n\nAndrei Ol'gerdovich (1325-1399) -\n\nHe was the son of Ol'gerd Gediminovich, grand prince of Lithuania. He became Prince of Pskov and Polotsk. He served Keistut of Lithuania in campaigns against the Livonian Order in 1375. In 1377 he returned to Pskov to serve as elected prince. He next entered the service of Moscow and in 1379 fought against Lithuania and in 1380 fought at Kulikovo field. Later he returned again to Lithuania to become Prince of Polotsk. In 1393 he left Polotsk for Pskov again. Finally he served Lithuania again under Vitovt and died in battle against the Tatars in 1399. His noted lineage assured that he would be well noted in the historical chronicles, but these peregrinations from Lithuania to Pskov to Moscow and back are typical of so many of the serving princes and boyars during the time when such moves were still possible.(48)\n\nVasilii I Dmitrievich (1371-1425) -\n\nHe was the second son of Dmitri Ivanovich Donskoi and received from the Mongol Khan Toqtamish the Mongol agreement to have the title of Grand Prince of Vladimir. During his youth he was among the Russian prince's sons held as hostage at Sarai. During this time he escaped from Sarai via Lithuania. He married the daughter of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Vitvot in 1389 and used his father-in-law's support against other Russian rivals. He succeeded in obtaining the submission of his relatives who controled other areas and eventually all the princes signed treaties agreeing to serve him together with their armies. He continued his predecessors efforts to get the boyars of other princes to shift into Muscovite service.\n\nIn 1392 he visited Sarai and obtained also the right (yarlyk) to the Principality of Nizhnii Novgorod, displacing the incumbent prince Boris. He then annexed Bezhetskii Verkh, Vologda, and Ustiug greatly extending his domain to the north. He obtained expressions of submission from the Princes of Tver and Ryazan. Tamerlane's devastating blow to the Golden Horde and removal of Toqtamish gave Vasilii an opportunity to keep for himself the yearly Mongol tribute for twelve years. He used the new freedom from Mongol interference to focus pressure on Novgorod and Lithuania. The union of Moscow with the Grand Principality of Vladimir was not seriously endangered from this time. The dynastic union between Vasilii I and his father-in- law, Vitvot, did not prevent confrontation between the two ambitious rulers. Their armies met near Krapivna in 1406, near Viaz'ma in 1407, and at the Ugra in 1409; but on all three occasions both sides retired without hazarding battle.\n\nThe respite from Mongol attentions was ended in 1408 when Idiqu took control of the Horde and launched a surprise attack that spared Moscow but devastated many other towns including Rostov and Serpukhov and the Riazan lands. Vasilii went to Sarai in 1412 to make amends and resume paying tribute in exchange for confirmation of his rights to Nizhnii Novgorod.(49) Vasilii's eldest son, Ivan, died in 1417. At his death in 1425 Vasilii left his ten year old second son, Vasilii II, the undivided principality as heir with the request that his widow (and her father, Vitvot) act as regent.\n\nChronology:\n\n1390 -Tatar raid against Riazan.\n\n1392 - Vasilii visits Golden Horde and obtains yarlyk for Nizhnii Novgorod. Prince Boris arrested and deported. Vasilii makes alliance with Vitvot and marries his daughter.\n\n1393 - Vasilii siezes Torzhik (town belonging to Novgorod)\n\n1394 - Oleg of Riazan decisively defeats Tatars. Oleg begins conflict with Vitovt of Lithuania.
