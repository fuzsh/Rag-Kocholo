        "text": "I think having Boris Godunov replaced - one way or another - by Simeon Bekbulatovich really wouldn't be too hard.\n\nThe most ideal scenario would be that the Uglich affair blows up and Godunov is brought down around 1591-2. That way, Dmitry's death is still blamed on Godunov, and his downfall happens just in time to avoid the serdom drive of 1592. Simeon Bekbulatovich can become the new Tsar in 1598, once Tsar Feodor dies as per OTL.\n\nOTOH, what does that really mean for Russia? That's a very complicated question.\n\nSimeon Bekbulatovich had a much better claim to the throne than Godunov. First, he was related to Ivan IV's wife (the second one); while this sounds like a distant connection to the old dynasty, it was just as good as the connection of the Romanovs. Second, he was briefly the formal ruler of Muscovy during one of Ivan's shenanigans. And last, but not the least, he was a legitimate male-line Chinggisid...and that's still worth something. Simeon's better pedigree means relations with the boyar elites are better, the government has more general prestige compared to Godunov's, and Russia's political situation is more stable.\n\nWhen it comes to differences in foreign policy, it's hard to say anything specific. Simeon's Chinggisid ancestry could come in handy when dealing with the Nogai Horde, resulting in its earlier and more thorough submission to Moscow. There could also be more interference in Kabardan affairs.\n\nWhen it comes to Simeon's personal talents, they were probably not as diverse as the talents of Boris Godunov. But we can assume he was at least slightly competent due to his political history. And he seems to have been a reasonably good military commander.\n\nHowever, the situation inherited from Ivan IV's reign was bad to begin with. And even a Chinggisid cannot change the weather. There's going to be a famine in 1602, and it's going to be bad. Minor improvements are possible, but it's definitely going to happen and it's going to send the prestige of Simeon's government through the meat grinder. At this point there will be unrest throughout the country and maybe even a False Dmitry (that depends on the background context of Simeon's ascension). The key part is that unrest will be much smaller than OTL's Time of Troubles, and foreign involvement will be more limited. The historians won't remember Simeon as a great Tsar, probably not even as a good Tsar; but by the time he dies and is succeeded by his son Feodor, Russia will be in much better shape than it was in OTL.\n\nHowever, the situation inherited from Ivan IV's reign was bad to begin with.

If Simeon is elected his legitimacy is much higher than one of the self-proclaimed son of Ivan's 6th \"wife\" (strictly speaking, she was not even a legitimate wife because marriage was not officially recognized by the Russian Church). OTOH, list of those with a better claim than Godunov was quite long. With all that brouhaha around Dmitry it is often forgotten that Boris destroyed (or tried to) the Romanob family: surely, relatives of Ivan's 1st wife had at least the same claim as relative of Feodor's wife. And destruction of the Romanovs had quite practical results: thousands of the masterless \"boyewie kholopy\" (military serfs) of the family could provide an important support base to any challenger.\n\nAs for the famine itself, well, with the legitimate and uncontested tsar it is just one more God's punishment so what can you do?\n\nHowever, there probably would be one great change from the OTL. Simeon does not have to suck up to anybody (especially to the lesser nobility) and as a result he would not do what Boris did: abolish peasants' right to change their masters (or to stay masterless). Basically, Boris was a founder of the Russian serfdom in its final form - serfs being de facto slaves. Long terms consequences of not having this system would be enormous.\n\nAs for the famine itself, well, with the legitimate and uncontested tsar it is just one more God's punishment so what can you do?\n\nWell, it's the Tsar's job to prevent that sort of thing by maintaining a close working relationship with God. If God is dishing out punishments like this, that means something's not right, and at that point you remember that the Tsar wasn't born Christian...\n\nSimeon Bekbulatovich wouldn't have tons of people who hate him from the start, like Godunov did; but a particularly bad famine could still cause widespread social unrest.\n\nHowever, there probably would be one great change from the OTL.

Long terms consequences of not having this system would be enormous.\n\nI agree; that's why I think it's best to get Godunov out of the picture around 1591, before he gets to introduce serfdom. This could even have some short-term consequences, a slightly less severe famine of 1602 and an overall faster recovery for the land. Combine this with a greatly reduced Time of Troubles and things are really starting to look up.\n\nWell, it's the Tsar's job to prevent that sort of thing by maintaining a close working relationship with God.

Honestly, I'm not sure that anybody knows enough about Simeon's personality to tell what actions he could take.\n\nIn OTL, Godunov suffered from the consequences of the traditional Russian liberal \"tried to make things better and ended up as always\" (I'm not saying that Godunov was a grandfather of the Russian liberalism but the style of execution was the same ): he ordered to stockpile huge amounts of grain for the coming famine (seemingly, at least something of the kind was expected) but was not able or willing to control the distribution part. As a result, the grain had been bought cheaply by the \"big guys\" (including the monasteries) and then sold by the skyrocketing prices with everything being blamed on Boris.\n\nAs for the social unrest, if the \"base\" (aristocracy and nobility) are reliable enough, the government would survive.\n\nI agree; that's why I think it's best to get Godunov out of the picture around 1591, before he gets to introduce serfdom. This could even have some short-term consequences, a slightly less severe famine of 1602 and an overall faster recovery for the land. Combine this with a greatly reduced Time of Troubles and things are really starting to look up.\n\nThe Time of Troubles may not even happen: initial support of False Dmitri was not too big but Godunov managed to piss off too many people from top to bottom.\n\nHmm. What is the effect (if any) of a Chingisid line into Europe's nobility? Though AFAIK, no children of the Russian imperial house married into foreign houses until the 1800s (Victoria's son Alfred married Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna). There would be no practical effect, but it would establish a peer-level connection between European and non-European royalty. Very vague, but OTL there was nothing at all. I would guess there were Chingisid rulers in Central Asia in the 1800s; the Moguls of India claimed remote Chingisid descent.\n\nAlfred to Maria is maybe the more well know of that weddings but really Russia started to regularly marry in the European houses in 1700 when Peter married his children and nephews in many European houses and after that consorts were almost always foreign. Sure all the issues of that weddings ended back in Russia until the weddings of the daughters of Paul I in the latest years of 1700s but still\n\nHmm.

Xenia Godunova was offered to a prince of Sweden and then of Denmark; Feodor II's daughter to a Habsburg archduke; Mikhail I tried to get a princess of Holstein (and apparently there was also talk of a Swedish/Polish princess, but considering that at the time of the talks, there either were no Polish princesses or the Swedish princess was already married) for himself, and later a morganaut prince of Denmark for his eldest daughter. Pyotr the Great's nieces and two of his kids managed pretty decent (if unhappy - in the case of Ekaterina Ivanovna and Alexei Petrovich) marriages to European royalty in the 1710s. He tried for the king of France AND the king of England for his two daughters, but was obliged to lower his sights to princes of Holstein, Saxony (a bastard), Hesse-Homburg and the like.\n\nAlfred to Maria is maybe the more well know of that weddings but really Russia started to regularly marry in the European houses in 1700 when Peter married his children and nephews in many European houses and after that consorts were almost always foreign.

His father-in-law Nicholas I granted to him on 14 July 1839 the Russian and Finnish style Imperial Highness, a rank he was entitled to as a descendant of the extended dynasty of Napoleon I of France.\n\nKonstantin Pavlowich - 2nd marriage\n\nAlexander II - there were nasty rumors about who was a real father of his 1st wife and his 2nd morganatic marriage was to Princess Catherine Dolgorukova.\n\nThen there were some \"inappropriate\" marriages during the reigns of Alexander III (like 2nd marriage of his brother Paul ) and Nicholas II (his brother Michael) but this is not quite relevant as happening after 1900.\n\nCouple small corrections: not nephews but nieces (daughters of Ivan V ) and after this the only exceptions for the current ruler and his children/siblings were:\n\nGrand Duchess Maria Nikolaievna - married to Maximilian Joseph Eugene Auguste Napoleon de Beauharnais, 3rd Duke of Leuchtenberg (son of Eugène de Beauharnais and Princess Augusta of Bavaria).

His 2nd wife belonged to the top level of the old Russian aristocracy, the Rurikids claiming patrilineal descent from Mikhail of Chernigov with the founder of the branch being also an official founder of Moscow. Now, with a royal status of his 1st wife being questionable, so formally the legitimacy of succession by her children also could be questioned (within the official succession laws which required a spouse from the ruling royal family). Which means that either children from both marriages are disqualified with the succession passing to Konstantin Nikolaevich or that the children from the 2nd marriage are also on the line and Alexander could chose them as more aristocratic. This, of course, was unlikely scenario but it generated at least one conspiracy theory according to which the whole terrorist organization \"People's Will\" had been secretly created upon the order of the future Alexander III (or rather his wife) with a single purpose to assassinate Alexander II.\n\nIt wasn't for want of trying. Xenia Godunova was offered to a prince of Sweden and then of Denmark; Feodor II's daughter to a Habsburg archduke; Mikhail I tried to get a princess of Holstein (and apparently there was also talk of a Swedish/Polish princess, but considering that at the time of the talks, there either were no Polish princesses or the Swedish princess was already married) for himself, and later a morganaut prince of Denmark for his eldest daughter.

He tried for the king of France AND the king of England for his two daughters, but was obliged to lower his sights to princes of Holstein, Saxony (a bastard), Hesse-Homburg and the like.\n\nWRT Mikhail I: There were several marriages of Western European nobility into Russia, e.g. Catherine the Great\\, and Nicholas I's consort Charlotte of Prussia. But such marriages could not spread Chingisid ancestry westward.\n\nI do note that Catherine's husband Peter III was the child of Peter I's daughter Anna and Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. So there was at least one marriage of a Russian into a western house. But Peter was the only child, and was brought to Russia to succeed his aunt, Tsarina Elizabeth, so there were no western descendants of this match.\n\nThe marriage of Ekaterina Ivanovna to the Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin was another such match, but again produced only one child, who was taken to Russia.\n\nI discover that things changed radically in the early 1800s; five daughters of Paul I married into western houses, and four of them had surviving children. One of them is ancestral to the Dutch royal family. The others married into various minor German houses. Something like this would be quite probable in an ATL where the Russian imperial house is descended from Bekbulatovich.\n\nThen, given the close connections between the British royal family and the German nobilty, it would be quite possible for a British royal to meet with a Mogul scion, both of them being remote descendants of the Great Khan.\n\nBut Peter was the only child, and was brought to Russia to succeed his aunt, Tsarina Elizabeth, so there were no western descendants of this match.\n\ndiscover that things changed radically in the early 1800s; five daughters of Paul I married into western houses, and four of them had surviving children. One of them is ancestral to the Dutch royal family. The others married into various minor German houses.\n\nFirst off, I'm confused. It's widely accepted that Paul WAS Pyotr's son, despite Ekaterina's memoirs saying he wasn't. And let's be honest, it would've been in Katya's interests to show Paul to be a bastard, so even if it WASN'T widely accepted, I'd still take it with a generous helping of salt.\n\nAnd I'd hardly call those families that Paul's daughters married into minor. Habsburgs were no small thing; Mecklenburg-Schwerin's kids married into the Hohenzollerns and the Wettins; Maria Pavlovna's Weimar kids married into the Prussian royal family as well, while her son married a Dutch cousin; Katya Jnr's kids wed into two branches of the Dutch ruling family; Anna wed the Dutch king but she nearly wound up as either empress of the French or queen of France (Alexander I turned Napoléon down and Louis XVIII turned Alexander down), so decidedly NOT minor IMO.\n\nThe Dutch royal family descends from Paul through Anna and Elena, but could just as easily have descended from Katya Jnr or Maria as well. Had Alexandra Pavlovna's daughter lived she would likely have carried Paul's ancestry into the Catholic houses of Europe.\n\nBut considering that this thread is centred in the 16th/17th century, discussing marriages from the 19th is not really relevant. I'm sorry I brought it up, however, I simply wanted to illustrate that Russian tsars DID try to get European marriages for themselves or their children - it just took until the 18th for these to actually be successful."
