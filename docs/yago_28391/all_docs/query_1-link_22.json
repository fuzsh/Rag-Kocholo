        "text": "(1606 – 1610)\n\nHe was enthroned by his adherents, and not by the great zemstvo Duma, Vasili Ivanovich Shuisky was not able to stay on the throne.\n\nIn Moscow, there were many dissatisfied with Shuisky. His adherents, with the help of which he reigned and who did not reward, reproached him for his stinginess. Many of the boyars themselves wanted to take the throne.\n\nWithout any support, Shuisky did not possess the abilities of a ruler and did not know how to act boldly and decisively. His whole reign was a complete turmoil.\n\nSoon a new impostor, Falsdmitry II, who was known under the name of the Tushinsky thief (from the village of Tushin, 12 versts from Moscow, where his camp was located), came from Lithuania. But he failed to take possession of the Moscow throne. Detachments from Tushin scattered throughout the Moscow regions and robbed.\n\nPoles under the command of Jan Sanega and Lisovsky besieged the Trinity-Sergius Lavra, which defended for 16 months.\n\nShuisky turned to the Swedes for help, sending Skopin his nephew for talks. King Swedish Charles IX willingly helped Shuisky. The Swedish detachment of 5 thousand people, under the command of General Delagardi, connected with Shuisky’s nephew Skopin.\n\nThey moved from Novgorod to Moscow, clearing of the Tushino gangs of the region lying on their way. After that, Skopin-Shuisky liberated the Trinity-Sergius Lavra.\n\nSigismund III, the King of Poland, declared war on Shuisk, besieged Smolensk and demanded that all Poles who served the impostor come to his aid.\n\nThen the impostor, afraid that he would not be given to his enemies, secretly escaped from Tushin to Kaluga. After that, the entire Tushino camp disintegrated.\n\nMoscow was freed from the Tushino thief (1610), and Skopin solemnly entered Moscow, enthusiastically greeted by the people, who hoped to see him king after the childless Shuisky. But soon at one feast he fell ill and died a few days later.\n\nThe death of Skopin, a talented military commander, was a heavy loss for the Russian land, which Sigismund was threatening, summoned to Moscow by traitors. Yes, and Tsar Vasily could rest on the throne only thanks to the victories of his nephew.\n\nAt that time, the army sent by Shuisky against Sigismund was severely defeated in the village of Klushin by Hetman Zholkeyevsky, who after this victory went to Moscow to elevate Vladislav to the throne of Moscow.\n\nThe pretender also moved from Kaluga to Moscow.\n\nThen the Moscow boyars, led by Zakhar Lyapunov, deposed Shuisky and tonsured him into monks.\n\nThe interregnum began (1610-1613).\n\nBefore the election of the new tsar, the boyar Duma, which was called by the number of its members (7), was called the Semiboyar.\n\nAt this time, the Poles who took possession of Moscow, using out-of-the-way, countless gangs wandered around Russia, robbed and burned everything in their path.\n\nNearly all of the Russian land was empty, and they nicknamed this fierce time – hard times.\n\nThis continued until the rescuers of the Russian people, Minin and Pozharsky, came to the rescue, and until Mikhail Fyodorovich, the first tsar from the Romanovs’ house, sat on the throne of Moscow.\n\nMikhail Fedorovich (1613 – 1645)\n\n(1605 – 1606)\n\nAfter the death of Boris Godunov, Moscow swore allegiance to his 16-year-old son Fedor, who received an excellent education.\n\nOutside of Moscow, there was a wobble. Basmanov, sent against the impostor, crossed with his army on his side. Fedor Borisovich and his mother were brutally murdered, the patriarch Job was overthrown, Ksenia Borisovna was tonsured. Moscow swore allegiance to the imaginary Dmitry. And in the summer of 1605, False Dmitry solemnly entered Moscow at a festive bell ringing. The whole road, the roofs of the houses were strewn with people.\n\nThe people believed that the impostor was the true son of Ivan the Terrible.\n\nThe first act of the impostor was the deposition of the patriarch Job, in whose place the archbishop of the Ryazan, the Greek Ignatius, who crowned the pretender to the kingdom, was built.\n\nFalse Dmitriy returned to Moscow the disgraced boyars, including Fedor Nikitich Romanov, who was tonsured as a monk under the name of Filaret.\n\nFalse Dmitry was elevated to the rank of Metropolitan of Rostov and, as a ruler, was distinguished by his talents and activities.\n\nHe attended daily meetings of the Boyar Duma, the boyars marveled at his intelligence and ability to quickly solve the most difficult cases.\n\nHe hinted to Duma people about their ignorance and expressed their desire to acquaint them with foreign countries.\n\nHe tried to bring bribes.\n\nHis reign lasted 11 months.\n\nFrivolous self-confidence, contempt for the old Russian customs, friendship with the Poles, marriage with the Catholic Marina Mnishek, and the confidence in the people that impersonated Dmitry Tsarevich as a prince led to the fact that the boyars led by Shuisky plotted against him.\n\nOn May 17, 1606, the imposter was killed after the nun Martha had renounced him. His corpse was put up for scolding on Red Square.\n\nWho was an impostor is unknown. Some suggest that it was an instrument of the boyars to overthrow Godunov. Russian chronicles say that the impostor Grigory Otrepiev was a monk in the Chudov Monastery.\n\nVasily Ivanovich Shuisky (1606 – 1610)\n\n(1598 – 1605)\n\nTsar Feodor Ivanovich did not leave a successor after him. All Moscow swore allegiance to his gentle wife Irina Fedorovna. But she did not want the authorities and retired to the Novodevichy Convent, where she was cut into a nun.\n\nTo select the sovereign was convened the Zemsky Sobor. Patriarch Job pointed the people to Boris, as the most worthy man to occupy the throne. Two times Godunov refused. Finally, after repeated requests of the clergy and the people, Boris agreed to be king.\n\nOn the 1st of September, on the New Year’s holiday, the royal wedding of Boris was performed. Taking the blessing from the patriarch Job, Boris said: “God knows that there will not be a beggar in my kingdom, I’ll share the last shirt with the people.”\n\nIn the first years of the reign, he attracted the benefits of immigrants to Siberia, summoned foreigners to Russia, sent young people to study abroad.\n\nIn Moscow, Boris gave poor people earnings, undertook several structures, for example, the Ivan the Great Bell Tower was built, which exceeded all the buildings in Russia.\n\nHe intended to open schools in Moscow where foreign languages ​​would be taught, but the clergy did not approve of this plan.\n\nDespite all his worries, he quickly lost his popular disposition due to his suspicion.\n\nThe victim of his suspicion was Bogdan Belsky, who was accused of malicious intent against the tsar and exiled.\n\nThe Romanov brothers were accused of intending to poison the tsar and imprisoned in distant places. The elder brother, Fedor Nikitich, was tonsured as a monk under the name of Filaret.\n\nGenerous alms during the famine and the cold weather did not calm the mob. The charge of the murder of Tsarevich Dmitry and the rumor about the appearance of an impostor shortened his life, and in April 1605 Boris Godunov unexpectedly died for all.\n\nPseudo Dmitry I (1605 – 1606)\n\n(1584 – 1598)\n\nAfter the death of Ivan IV the Terrible, his son Feodor Ivanovich, quiet in temper, weak and painful, ascended the throne. He was not able to manage the state, and therefore granted the management of the affairs of his brother’s brother, clever and cunning, Boris Godunov.\n\nThus, Feodor Ivanovich was king only by name.\n\nThe rapid rise of Godunov, not Russian in origin (the ancestor of Boris was the Tartar Murza Chet, who accepted the Christian faith and entered the service of the Moscow prince in the fourteenth century), was not liked by most of the boyars.\n\nParticularly hostile to Godunov boyars Shuiskys, Mstislavsky, Vorotynsky were sent out to cities, imprisoned or tonsured.\n\nMetropolitan Dionysius, who condemned Godunov’s deeds, was deposed, and in his place was betrayed to Boris Godunov by the Rostov Archbishop Job.\n\nGodunov enjoyed great power and ruled the state without rivals, calling himself the son of a “near great boyar.” He laid the Arkhangelsk pier on the White Sea, where foreign merchant ships could come.\n\nUnder Godunov, there was a war with the Swedes, which ended in the return of the cities they lost: Yama, Koporye, Ivangorod.\n\nIn 1591, the Crimean Khan Kazyl-Girey wanted to attack Moscow, but when he met a large army under his walls, he retired.\n\nIn Siberia, the Russians approved their rule by the construction of fortresses (Tobolsk, Pelym, Berezov, etc.).\n\nIn 1589, at the request of Tsar Feodor Ivanovich, a patriarchate was established in Russia. The first to receive this highest order was Metropolitan Job.\n\nAn important government decree of Godunov is the attachment of peasants to the land, i.e. prohibition to the peasants to move from one place to another, as was done in times of destitution, when the peasants were free farmers. Large landowners lured the peasants from the small, who complained about the inability to conduct military service, because their lands are left without peasants. The Code of Law of John III, this right is limited, but it was allowed to go only once a year near St. George’s Day. According to the decree of Tsar Feodor Ivanovich, the peasants were to remain on the land on which they were seized.\n\nIn 1591, Tsarevich Dmitry was killed, the heir to the childless Feodor. The investigation into this case did not lead to anything. Feodor was informed that the prince, in a fit of epileptic illness, himself stabbed himself with a knife, but the popular rumor accused Godunov.\n\nIn 1598, Feodor died, and the Rurik dynasty ended.\n\nTroubled time from 1598 to 1613.\n\nBoris Fedorovich Godunov (1598-1605)\n\n(1533 – 1584)\n\nAfter the death of Helen Glinsky came the 10-year-old autocracy of the boyars. Their rule was marked by the struggle of the rulers and the oppression of the people.\n\nIvan, looking at others, got used to arbitrariness and violent actions. Impressive child resented the insolence of the boyars in relation to him and his brother Yuri.\n\nIvan IV was abnormally nervous, easily aroused and came into agitation, but was very observant and possessed a wonderful memory. Very early in it was manifested a savage, painful cruelty. So at his age of thirteen he ordered the princes of Prince Shuisky to be torn to pieces.\n\nHe read everything he could find in the courtyard library, got acquainted with the stories – sacred, church and Roman, chronicles, and everywhere he was looking for an excuse for his ideas about power.\n\nAccording to the historian Solovyov, he was a nervous king not only because the first took the royal title, but because he understood the whole significance of royal power.\n\nIn 1547, when Ivan was 16 years old, he solemnly married to the kingdom and assumed the title of King. Thus in history appeared the first married autocrat.\n\nSoon he married Anastasia Romanovna, the daughter of the okolnichny Roman Yuryevich Zakharyin, whose family received the Romanov family name. So the house of Rurik was related to the house of the Romanovs.\n\nSoon after the Tsar’s wedding in Moscow, a fire broke out, the people blamed Glinsky for arson, a rebellion broke out, during which one of Glinsky was killed. This event strongly influenced John, and he turned to state activities.\n\nThe closest place to the king was occupied not by the boyars, but by two worthy husbands: the archpriest of the court Annunciation Cathedral, Sylvester and the sleeping bag Alexei Adashev. Thus ended the reign of the boyars, and John himself began to rule the state.\n\nIn 1550, at the behest of the tsar, a new judicial code was drawn up, in which severe punishments were imposed on rulers and judges convicted of unjust court and bribery.\n\nIn 1551, Ivan convened a spiritual cathedral from the higher clergy. The articles that were discussed at this cathedral were divided into one hundred chapters, and therefore it is known in history as Stoglavy.\n\nIn 1552 Kazan was conquered, in 1553 the first trade relations with England. In 1556, the conquest of Astrakhan followed. In 1563 printing began in Moscow. In 1558, John declared Livonia war, which lasted until 1582.\n\nThe last important event of the reign of Ivan IV was the accession to Russia of the Siberian kingdom, won by the Don Cossacks under the command of Ermak Timofeevich in 1582.\n\nAfter the death of her first wife Anastasia Romanovna and with the removal of Sylvester and Adashev, oprichnina and executions inspired fear at all, for which he was nicknamed Grozny – the Terrible.\n\nIvan IV reigned 50 years.\n\nFeodor Ivanovich (1584 – 1598)\n\n(1505 – 1533)\n\nThe son of Ioann III, Vasily III Ioannovich, carries in the history the name of “The Last Collector of the Russian Land”, since he completely destroyed the specific system and united all the regions under its own authority.\n\nVasily III did not confer with the boyars about the affairs and did not allow the slightest contradiction on their part. Several approached deacons, but the butler were his favorites, with whom he consulted and decided matters.\n\nIn Pskov there were troubles due to the feuds of the boyars with ordinary citizens, as well as disagreements with the governors. One of such strife he took advantage of and destroyed the Pskov Veche. The Veche Bell was removed and taken away from Pskov. Visiting Pskov, Vasily III ordered to take out of him many boyars, and their place was settled by the boyars of Moscow. Thus Pskov without any bloodshed was annexed to Moscow in 1510.\n\nIn 1520, Ryazan annexed itself. The Ryazan prince, wishing to destroy his dependence on Moscow, initiated relations with the Crimean khan. Vasily III summoned him to Moscow, where he imprisoned him, and turned his land into his domain. Also, the principality of the north was annexed in 1523.\n\nAs a result, the Moscow prince became the sole ruler of the entire Moscow principality.\n\nThe war with Poland ended with the annexation of Smolensk (1514) to Moscow, which for over a hundred years was under the rule of Lithuania.\n\nSince the time of Vasily III, devastating raids on Russia of the Crimean Tatars have begun.\n\nVasily III was married to Solomonid Saburova, but had no children from her. With the permission of Metropolitan Daniel, he divorced her and married Elena Vasilyevna, the niece of Mikhail Glinsky. She had two sons, Ioann and Yuri. Before his death he blessed the great reign of the three-year-old Ioann.\n\nElena Glinskaya (1533 – 1538)\n\n(1462 – 1505)\n\nWith the accession to the Moscow throne of Ivan III, son of Vasily the Dark, a new stage of Russian history begins – the Moscow Russia.\n\nHis reign is marked by many important events.\n\nThe first place is occupied by the annexation to Moscow of the most significant destinies of northeastern Russia, namely, Novgorod, (1478), Tver, (1485), Vereisky’s estate and part of the Ryazan region. Only Pskov and the other part of Ryazan remained unconnected.\n\nDuring the reign of Ivan III in Novgorod, there were 2 parties: Lithuanian, which stood for the transition to citizenship of the Polish-Lithuanian state, and Moscow, which stood for Orthodox Moscow.\n\nAt the head of the Lithuanian party was the intelligent, determined but extremely ambitious widow of the posadnik Marfa Boretskaya. She conceived independently of the Moscow prince to rule Novgorod. In view of this, the Lithuanian party persuaded the Veche to conclude an alliance with Polish King Casimir IV.\n\nIvan took advantage of this, accusing the Novgorodians of treason. And in July 1471 he put forward a large army. Broken on the river Sheloni by Prince Daniel of Kholm, the Novgorodians asked the Grand Duke for peace, sending Archbishop Theofan. Ioann agreed to peace, obliging the Novgorodians to renounce the alliance with Casimir IV, to pay 15,500 rubles. for military expenses and recognize the Grand Prince of Moscow as his supreme judge. The veche was left in its original form.\n\nIn 1478, Ivan III undertook a new campaign against Novgorod in order to destroy a very rebellious veche. This time the matter did not reach the clash, the Novgorodians accepted and kissed the cross as an autocratic sovereign. The veche was destroyed, the veche bell, the symbol of Novgorod’s liberties, and Maria Boretskaya were sent to Moscow, the instigators of the troubles were executed, several thousand Novgorod families were transferred to other areas, and the merchants and boyar children from the Moscow principality moved to their place. This was the last blow to Novgorod, and it became a secondary city.\n\nIvan finally overthrew the Mongol yoke (1480), which for 237 years gravitated over the Russian land (1223 – 1480 years).\n\nBeing married to Sophia Paleologus (Greek princess), Ivan III was the first to introduce the rite of the royal wedding.\n\nConsidering himself the heir of the Byzantine emperors, Ivan III takes in the intercourse with foreigners the title of king and connects the Moscow coat of arms, i.e. image of St. George, defeated by a dragon, with the Byzantine coat of arms – a two-headed eagle.\n\nIn 1497, on the orders of Ivan, the Sudebnik was drafted by the deacon Gusev on the basis of the Russian Truth, the litigations and customs of the Moscow judicial proceedings.\n\nVasily III Ioannovich (1505 – 1533)"
