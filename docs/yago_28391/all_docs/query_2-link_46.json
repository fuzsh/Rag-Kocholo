He then became Russia’s first Tsar, or emperor, from 1547 until 1584. Ivan the Terrible became known through his ruthless methods of amassing enormous quantities of land throughout his rule, establishing a tightly centralized system of government.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information on Ivan the Terrible. Alternatively, you can download our 28-page Ivan the Terrible worksheet pack to utilize within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nNICKNAME\n\nIvan’s nickname Грoзный, or “Grozny,” is typically translated as “terrible” in English, but the meaning of his nickname is a relatively antiquated translation. In modern times, the word “terrible” is translated as “defective” or “evil.”\n\nHowever, in ancient English, the ancient definition of Ivan’s nickname Grozny could mean “powerful,” “dangerous,” or “creating fear or terror”. It does not align with the modern definition of terrible.\n\nAccording to Vladimir Dal, a Russian Lexicographer, the term “grozny” refers to a tsar who is “gorgeous, courageous, and keeps adversaries in dread but people in obedience.” In addition, modern scholars have proposed “formidable” as one of the other translations.\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nIvan the Terrible was born on 25 August 1530 in Kolomenskoye, Grand Duchy of Moscow. He was the first child of Vasili III and Elena Glinskaya, who was Vasili III’s second wife. Ivan the Terrible passed away on 28 March 1584, at 53, in Moscow, Tsardom, Russia. His remains are buried at the Cathedral of the Archangel, Moscow.\n\nThe mother of Vasili III, Ivan’s father, was an Eastern Roman princess who belonged to the Palaiologos line of Byzantium. She was the child of Thomas Palaiologos, the younger brother of Constantine XI Palaiologos, the last Byzantine emperor.\n\nGiven that his reign was relatively uneventful and that it occurred between the reigns of Ivan the Great and his son Ivan the Terrible, he is often disparagingly referred to as Vasili the Adequate.\n\nElena’s father came from the Glinski clan, which claimed genealogy from Orthodox Hungarian nobility and the Mongol emperor Mamai. At the same time, Elena Ginskaya’s mother is a Serbian princess.\n\nIvan’s father died when Ivan was only three from a leg abscess and inflammation that progressed to blood poisoning. Ivan’s father requested that he be named the Grand Prince of Moscow.\n\nIvan’s mother, Elena Glinskaya, served as a regent at first, but she passed away in 1538 when he was just eight years old, and many think she was poisoned.\n\nThen, various rival boyar families fought for control of the regen. Ivan and his younger brother Yuri, according to his letters, frequently felt neglected and offended by the powerful boyars from the Shuisky and Belsky families.\n\nIvan was crowned at the Cathedral of the Dormition in the Moscow Kremlin on January 16, 1547. Ivan Vasilievich was given the barmas, the cap of Monomakh, and the Cross of the Life-Giving Tree by the Metropolitan.\n\nIvan was anointed with myrrh before the metropolitan gave the tsar a blessing. He was the first person to be crowned “Tsar of All the Russias,” partially following in the footsteps of his grandfather.\n\nIvan was anointed tsar to establish himself as the supreme ruler of Russia and to make it clear that no one was to challenge his authority. The new title represented the acquisition of power comparable to and parallelled to that of the Tatar Khan and the old Byzantine Emperor, both of whom were referred to as Tsars in Russian sources.\n\nIvan ordered Simeon to seize all the territories that belonged to monasteries. According to the English ambassador Giles Fletcher, the Elder and Ivan appeared to dispute the choice. Ivan received his throne in 1576, preserved some of the lands taken from him, and returned the rest.\n\nFOREIGN POLICY\n\nConquest of Kazan and Astrakhan. The forces of Kazan Khanate frequently raided northern Russia while Ivan was a child. Ivan marched a powerful Russian army against Kazan on June 16, 1552.\n\nOn August 30, the final siege of the Tatar capital began. Under the direction of Prince Alexander Gorbaty-Shuisky, the Russians demolished 150 cannons with the use of battering rams and a siege tower. The Russians also benefited from skilled military engineers.\n\nThe fortifications had been broken, and the city’s water supply had been cut off. On October 2, Kazan was eventually overrun. The defenses of Kazan had been destroyed, and most of its populace was murdered. Many enslaved Russians and convicts were freed.\n\nIvan constructed several oriental-inspired buildings to commemorate his triumph over Kazan, the most renowned of which was Saint Basil’s Cathedral in Moscow’s Red Square.\n\nLivonian War. Ivan started the Livonian War in 1558 to control the Baltic Sea and its essential trading routes. The war lasted for 24 years. States that were involved were the Kingdom of Sweden, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the Teutonic Knights of Livonia.\n\nThe conflict of the Livonian War, however, ended. The Oprichnina completely upended the administration, and the protracted conflict had all but ruined the economy.\n\nCrimean Raids. The Crimean Tatars disrupted the southern frontiers of Muscovy in the latter years of Ivan’s rule. Its primary goal was to seize enslaved people. The Moscow region was frequently attacked by Khan Devlet I Giray of Crimea. The 40,000-man Crimean and Turkish army launched a massive raid in 1571.\n\nIvan was compelled to give up his claims on Astrakhan for the Crimean Khanate to buy peace with Devlet Giray. Still, the intended transfer was a diplomatic ploy and was never carried out.\n\nIvan was enraged by the loss against the Crimea. On his direction, preparations were made between 1571 and 1572.\n\nAfter several days of fierce combat, Mikhail Vorotynsky, the commander of the Russian army, flanked the Tatars on August 2 with most of his forces, striking them suddenly, and Khvorostinin made a break for it from the walls.\n\nIvan the Terrible Worksheets\n\nThis fantastic bundle includes everything you need to know about Ivan the Terrible across 28 in-depth pages.

His mother also died unexpectedly before his eighth birthday – some say it may have been due to poisoning. As a result of these early losses, Ivan spent most of his childhood being used as a tool for powerful aristocratic families in their ongoing disputes with one another.\n\nHow did Ivan the Terrible change the world?\n\nIvan the Terrible relied on fear and intimidation to unify Russia, yet his disastrous participation in the Livonian War almost plummeted it into financial ruin. Yet, on a positive note, he also facilitated Orthodox Christianity’s growth across his empire and steered Russian foreign affairs toward Europe.\n\nHow did Ivan IV contribute to Russian society?\n\nIvan IV’s contributions to Russian society were substantial. He established a national parliament, revised the legal code, and implemented amendments to Russia’s Orthodox Church doctrine. In this way, his dedication to reform made him one of Russia’s most influential rulers in modern times.\n\nLink/cite this page\n\nIf you reference any of the content on this page on your own website, please use the code below to cite this page as the original source.\n\nLink will appear as Ivan the Terrible Facts & Worksheets: https://kidskonnect.com - KidsKonnect, December 28, 2022\n\nUse With Any Curriculum\n\nThese worksheets have been specifically designed for use with any international curriculum.
