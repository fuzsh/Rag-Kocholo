I pledge allegiance to the form

of science fiction and fantasy

and to the promise for which it stands:

one world,

polycultural,

genetically engineered,

with Internet access for all.

--- Tonio Roque

I've spun off my list of recommendations into a separate page.

The distinction between science fiction and fantasy, like that between animal and plant, is sometimes unclear; still, it doesn't do to call Dunsany SF any more than it does to give your true love a bouquet of hippopotami.
