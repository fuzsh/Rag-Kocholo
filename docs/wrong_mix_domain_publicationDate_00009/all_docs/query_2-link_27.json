I am grateful to you all. The author would like to add that any mistakes or omissions are his own. Foreword The Mammoth Encyclopedia of Science Fiction is a book written for fans, by a fan. It is a book for anyone who has ever enjoyed science fiction or who wishes to know more about the genre. My original aim was simple - to provide you, the reader, with an up-to- date guide to the science fiction genre. So inside this book you will find entries on both classic and up-and-coming writers, on movies and tele- vision series, as well as the important themes and devices of the genre. Obviously I have had to limit my remit - some authors only just missed out on an entry. The same can be said about the entries for science fiction movies - 1 have limited myself to the one hundred most influential pieces of genre film, or those that have a direct link to a classic novel. I have also provided entries on the twenty most important or popular television series from both America and the UK. Within the author entries are links to various other sections of the book, as well as lists of recommended further reading that suggest authors who explore similar themes or who have written novels in similar styles. I hope you find these useful. I have also included an appendix at the back of the book that gives all the listed titles in alphabetical order, referenced by author. As far as I know this is the first time this has been done and it should enable you to find quickly the name of the author who wrote a particular novel, and then to locate the entry on that author within the book. Most importantly, I hope that this reference work will allow you to discover new authors and thus broaden your literary horizons. Science fiction is a genre of limitless possibilities and ideas, and there is something within it for everyone. I hope that this book helps you with your search. George Mann October 2000 The History and Origins of Science Fiction Science Fiction begins in prehistory. Or, perhaps, if you listen to some critics, with Thomas More, with Voltaire, with MARY SHELLEY's Frankenstein (1818), with the stories of EDGAR ALLAN POE, with JULES VERNE or H. G. WELLS or, indeed, with HUGO GERNSBACK and his AMAZING STORIES magazine of the 1920s. If taken on its most basic level, as a form of fantastic fiction, science fiction (from now on referred to as SF) is as old as storytelling itself. But surely this is not the case? Shouldn't SF, by its very name, include at least some allusion to science and scientific theory? The origins of the SF genre are as hotly debated as those of any other established branch of literature, and the disagreement that surrounds the topic is almost as complex as the questions themselves. What is the first novel that can truly be called SF? And do we take this as our starting point, or was there a crucible or melting pot of ideas from which it was formed? Indeed, what is it that actually makes an SF novel SF? In other words, to find the origins of our genre, we must first go in search of definition. What is SF? Most people feel that they can recognize SF when they come across it in their daily lives, whether it is a novel or an episode in a television drama. Indeed, when used as a marketing tool SF is defined in broad and inclu- sive terms, taking in everything from space vessels and laser guns to kooky aliens and vampires. This is not necessarily helpful. For SF to be recognized as a distinct genre, there have to be some boundaries, rules or ideal parameters that define what constitutes science fiction and exclude what doesn't. Let us take two examples from literature and see where they lead us. First, the classic novel Titus Groan (1946) by Mervyn Peake. In this 4 The History and Origins of Science Fiction work the author portrays the lives of a group of people who exist within the confines of an enormous castle, Gormenghast. This castle is effec- tively a city unto itself, so huge and labyrinthine that much of it remains unexplored by its current inhabitants who go about their lives according to a set of obsessively detailed scriptures and ancient regulations that give the place a real sense of oppressively looming history. Peake explores in great depth the bizarre environment of these people and examines in telling detail the effect it has on the inhabitants themselves. He does not concern himself with how the castle of Gormenghast came to exist origi- nally nor with where it is to be found, neither does he establish the means by which this particular cross-section of humanity has come to be there. It simply is. Now set this alongside FRANK HERBERT'S comparably epic Dune (1965). In Dune, Herbert sets out, in much the same manner as Peake, to describe in painstaking detail an imaginary world, the PLANET Arrakis, and the way of life that its ecology imposes upon its necessarily hardy inhabitants. However, what sets Dune apart from Titus Groan is the manner in which its author establishes his invented world. Herbert goes to great lengths to place the distant planet in a recognizable, if unavoid- ably remote human context - an interstellar Empire that has arisen and developed over many years, discovering in the process other habitable worlds upon which to settle colonies. He describes in true ECOLOG- ICAL terms the physical geography of the planet, even to the consistency of its soil, and the various forms of life that may have evolved in this envir- onment over time. He does not make it easy for his human characters to get by, forcing them to live strictly according to the description he has given of his world - for example, by having them wear rubber 'stillsuits' that enable them to recycle their body fluids: Arrakis is a vast parched desert with no water supply of its own. Some of the characters have tech- nological implements to aid them in their quest for survival, others do not. Some of the author's extrapolations are credible, others are not. At one point Herbert even explains the characters' dreams of making the planet more hospitable to human life, and the TERRAFORMING process by which they plan to do it. But what is most important about Dune is its intrinsic attempt at realism, as the lives of the characters are shaped by the scientifically defined landscape of their environment. This comparison between two classic works of imaginative fiction, one fantasy, the other science fiction is by no means the final word on the subject, and is at best an over-generalization. But it can be seen as repre- What is SF? 5 sentative of the relationship between much fantasy and SF. Science fiction is a literature concerned with the process by which a depicted envir- onment has become different from our own, or with the means by which humanity finds itself there. This does not rule out narrative elements of intrigue, adventure and so forth, far from it, but it does imply that SF will attempt to examine the wider picture, for example by questioning how aliens might have developed on Mars and exploring the effects that their existence could have upon the way in which human beings view them- selves and the wider universe. One of the best ways to envisage a time different from our own, to devise a temporal 'laboratory' within which to test new ideas, is to look forward to the future. SF emphasizes its differ- ence from fantasy by attempting to construct a rational framework for anything that it describes. This, however, is not to say that the genres cannot usefully interact with each other. SCIENCE FANTASY or SPACE OPERA will use devices derived from SF to describe new and exciting environments, but in many ways both subcategories remain more true to the pulp-fiction genres of the 1920s and 1930s. This is because they do not bother to make plausible their invented futures, being more concerned with the adven- ture components of their storylines and more willing to go beyond the realms of scientific plausibility to create spectacular effects. This is another factor that can make it more difficult for us to reach a satisfactory definition of 'real' SF. There is also the question of actual science. Most true SF stories will, in their attempt to render credible their particular vision of the future, draw upon some scientific theory or device to strengthen its plausibility. However, there is also a school of thought that argues that 'softer' disciplines like psychology and sociology should also be considered as sciences. This has interesting implications for SF. ALFRED BESTER's The Demolished Man (1953) is a good example of this. The novel depicts a society within which the majority of people have telepathic powers - hardly a scientifically plausible notion. However, in his exploration of the theme, Bester clearly considers the rational argu- ments for and against telepathy, and attempts to extrapolate as clearly and as realistically as he can the effects that the introduction of psychic powers would have on society. He describes an America that has evolved very differently than it would have under 'normal' circumstances, a UTOPIA of sorts, in which crime is rarely heard of and can usually be detected before it even takes place. However, Bester also examines the other side of the coin, and shows how this type of environment could be seen as oppres- 6 The History and Origins of Science Fiction sive and even dangerous. What Bester does in The Demolished Man, and what makes it a genuine SF novel, is to devise one (admittedly implaus- ible) change to society and then extrapolate coherently the repercussions that the introduction of this change would have on the development of civilization. His book is a triumph of sociological speculation and in its method, if not in its use of conventional science, it exemplifies true science fiction. The same can be said of much ALTERNATE WORLD fiction. Gloriana, or the Unfulfill'd Queen ( 1 978) by MICHAEL MOORCOCK examines the possibilities of a British Elizabethan Empire that differs completely from the historical records but whose ambience is often fantastical and in keeping with period fantasias such as William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream (first performed c. 1596, published 1600) and Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene (1590-1596). KEITH ROBERTS's Pavane (1968), on the other hand, is realistic and hard-hitting, attempting to extrapolate realistically how society might have developed if the Spanish Armada had defeated Drake's navy and the British Isles had remained a Papal dominion. Pavane is SF not so much in its content as in its telling. It is meticulous and thoroughly worked out. So SF, by necessity, is an open and wide-ranging genre whose defini- tion can have as much to do with the way in which a book is written as with its content. It also incorporates the more fantastical Space Opera, which, although it has its proponents who insist on claiming a 'scientific' founda- tion for the intergalactic conflicts and militaristic alien invasions, for the most part prefers to concentrate on the end result - spectacular action - rather than the means - convincing extrapolation. This inclusiveness makes any binding definition hazardous, but it is fairly safe to assume that most 'real' SF is covered by the following loose description: SF is a form of fantastic literature that attempts to portray, in rational and realistic terms, future times and environments that are different from our own. It mill nevertheless show an awareness of the concerns of the times in which it is written and provide implicit commentary on contemporary society, exploring the effects, material and psychological, that any new technologies may have upon it. Any further changes that take place in this society, as well as any extrapolated future events or occurrences, will have their basis in measured and considered theory, scientific or otherwise. SF authors will use their strange and imaginative environments as a testing ground for new ideas, considering in full the implications of any notion they propose. The Origins ofSF 7 Obviously, many SF novels and stories fail to achieve what they set out initially to do, and many of the more space-opera-type stories are written as sheer entertainment. But it is the way in which they are written and their attempts to adhere to rational, recognizable frameworks that make them truly science fiction. So, with these guidelines in mind, let us consider the origins of the genre and attempt to locate the first true example of an SF novel. The Origins of SF The foundations of SF were laid many thousands of years ago, with such wonderful works of mythology as The Epic ofGilgamesh and The Egyptian Book of the Dead. There is no way in which these ancient texts can be meaningfully interpreted as science fiction, but they do offer us a starting point for a more general form of fantastic literature that points the way to the eventual emergence of the genre. But, of course, it was not until much, much later that SF would actually develop as a distinct branch of litera- ture. It is important to remember that, for as long as human beings have been able to communicate ideas to one another, allegorical tales have existed as a useful testing ground for new ideas. However, it is only during the last two or three centuries that a recognizably modern scien- tific viewpoint has formed and begun to pervade both society and litera- ture. Until this point, most fantastical writing had been of a RELIGIOUS nature and, as such, was intent upon perpetuating the pious myths upon which it was based, as well as these myths' under- lying lessons and philosophies. For the most part, it is unhelpful and often harmful to the credibility of the genre to attempt retrospectively to classify this sort of material as SF. In 1516 Thomas More published, in Latin, his famous political work Utopia, which displays a particularly resonant awareness of its time and extrapolates contemporary political thought to create its setting. An English translation appeared in 1551. It describes, in great detail, an unknown island (clearly modelled on the recently discovered America) where a 'perfect' society has been established - the first depiction of a Utopian state. The book is fundamentally satirical, as More intends it to be known that he does not believe that such a profound social equilibrium as he depicts could ever be reached. His book triggered an explosion of Utopian fictions: they continue to appear today, but are ultimately more correctly considered as political rather than science fictional writings. 8 The History and Origins of Science Fiction Utopia does, however, indicate the direction that fantastical literature was beginning to take. There followed a succession of fantastical works over the next few centuries, as writers began to make use of devices that would later become intimately associated with the SF genre. Gulliver's Travels (1726: rev. 1735) by Jonathan Swift is one fine example, as is Voltaire's lesser-known Micromegas (1752). Both are satirical and use devices such as ALIENS and strange new worlds as a means of commenting on the society of their contemporaries. These are not the alien races that would come to appear much later in episodes of STAR TREK, but metaphorical humans with no previous experience of our culture. Their ignorance is used to satirical and often ingenious effect. Nevertheless, these stories remain, ultimately, fantasies. So what is the first true SF novel - and when did it appear? BRIAN ALDISS proposes in his excellent history of the genre, Billion Year Spree (1973), that we should view the classic Gothic Romance by MARY SHELLEY, Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus ( 1 8 1 8), as the first novel to be truly recognizable as SF. There are many grounds for agreeing with him. Frankenstein shows a keen awareness of the technological and scientific knowledge of its time, and develops this to form the basis of the novel. From some perspectives, Frankenstein shows clearly the beginnings of the development of SF as a form distinct from other fantastical literature. In a similar way to much other fiction of the time, Frankenstein draws on images taken from philosophy, poetry and mythology but adds the extra dimension of science. It is essentially a Gothic Romance in which Shelley, bravely, used current scientific thought to render her demon credible. The monster is no longer a devilish entity that simply exists - it is created, bit by bit, by a human being, and literally shocked into existence with electricity. Magic or mystical invocations are nowhere in sight and although religious analogies are drawn, they remain purely metaphysical. Science, not religion, has become the key to unlocking life. Shelley's novel represents a bold step forward into a new way of thinking, and shines a light ahead of itself, making further exploration possible. In Frankenstein, Shelley opened up a Pandora's box of notions and ideas that had been bubbling away under the surface of society for years. She gave them voice and form, and proved herself to be years ahead of her time. It is fair to say that Frankenstein represents the first true SF novel to appear, according to our previous definition. However, there are reasons to believe that the novel had an even more significant bearing on the Scientific Romance 9 Gothic Romance, and it is also important to mention that, until the middle of the twentieth century, Frankenstein did not have a big influence on the development of the SF genre. It stands alone as a testament to the foresight of one young woman, and it was not until many years later, when the genre was already established, that it would be recognized as the classic piece of SF that it is. It took a few years more and the work of a number of other writers before the genre began to emerge in its current and recognizable form. It is important to mention here the work of the nineteenth-century American writer EDGAR ALLAN POE who has been lauded by a number of critics, nowhere more memorably than in THOMAS DISCH's study of the SF genre The Dreams Our Stuff is Made 0/(1998), as the first writer of what today's reader might accept as genre fiction. While it remains undeniable that Poe has had a more direct and profound influence on the modern HORROR story, exemplified in the work of such writers as Stephen King and Clive Barker, it is nonetheless notable that a number of his stories make use of ideas that would later become associated with SF. In the works of Poe we encounter alien races existing out in the ether of space, we witness balloon flights to the moon, and we peruse the travel journals of a twenty-ninth-century woman. The power of these stories is undeniable and they represent the seeds that would eventually flower into the modern genre, yet they remain, like the fantstical tales that had preceded them, allegorical fantasies. The 'fantastic journey' and the utopian/anti-utopian story developed into a more recognizably modern form of SF with the publication of the first SCIENTIFIC ROMANCE, the French author Jules Verne's Journey to the Centre of the Earth (1863). Scientific Romance The 'Scientific Romance' represents the first real step on the road towards the consolidation of the central ideas and themes of SF into one dominant form, the first version of science fiction in a recognizably 'modern' manifestation. The term did not actually come into use until about thirty years after Verne's Journey to the Centre of the Earth, with the publication of H. G. Wells's The Time Machine (1895), but it is legitimate as well as convenient to consider Verne in the same context. Journey to the Centre of the Earth achieves much. Its precision of detail is certainly inspired by the works of Poe (whom Verne admired greatly, to the extent that he later wrote a sequel to Poe's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon 10 The History and Origins of Science Fiction Pym (1837)), but it shows a more clear and ready grasp of science and the scientific method. It describes the descent of Professor Von Hard wigg and his spirited nephew Harry into the mouth of an Icelandic volcano, from which they go on to discover a subterranean world inhabited by prehistoric monsters. The author approaches the scenario itself with judicious logic, explaining how these dinosaurs could have survived for so long in isolation, but it is the manner in which the character of Von Hard wigg, a chemist and mineralogist, approaches his discovery that is most enlightening. The novel is full of the scientific speculation of the day. It casts a scientist in the lead role, and shows very clearly how he uses the scientific method to aid him in his quest to discover how this subterranean world has come about. It is also an adventure, and - this is important to remember - it was widely read and therefore had an important and far-reaching influence on other writers of the day. If Journey to the Centre of the Earth marks the beginning of SF as a defi- nite genre, then Verne's later works From the Earth to the Moon (1865), Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea (1870) and The Mysterious Island (1874) represent its continued growth, as he toys with new ideas and continues to develop imaginative scenarios that can nonetheless be explained logically in terms of cause and effect. Verne did not create mere fantasy lands. He wanted to know from whence they came. It is this insistence on a fundamental realism that has caused Verne's novels to be retrospectively seen as of key importance in the development of SF. It is also significant that they were translated and read all over the world - people in droves came to the books looking for adventure and got it, but with an edge of scientific inquiry that left them with a new, very different SENSE OF WONDER. The magic of the realms of fantasy had been superseded by the fascination of speculation rooted in reality. These 'extraordinary voyages', as they were then known, had an excep- tional influence on the work of many writers, including that of EDWIN A. ABBOTT and ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON. But their most profound effect was on the British writer H. G. Wells, whose The Time Machine (1895) represents the definitive moment at which science fiction came of age. Wells's The Time Machine is the epitome of a science fiction novel, marking the important leap from Verne's adventurous 'extraordinary voyages' to fully fledged SF. It achieves this in a number of ways. Firstly, it postulates a device, based on a scientific theory, that will see its character transported forward through time to various stages in the Dawn of the Magazines 1 1 existence of man. It extrapolates from current EVOLUTIONARY theory to justify its portrayal of future humanity as two distinct species. Perhaps most importantly, it also uses scientific speculation to comment critically on the Victorian society of Wells's own time. Wells wanted to stir up the complacent Victorians and provide them with what he thought could be an accurate vision of their future. He saw the gentle yet docile Eloi race as symbolic of the effete upper classes, whilst the Morlocks represented the descendants of the uneducated but more evolu- tionarily successful worker underclass. His fictional future was a satire on Victorian society, but it was also scientifically plausible according to the speculation about evolution that was current at the time. The Time Machine pioneered the use of many SF concepts that have now become genre cliches, so often have they been recycled by other writers over the years. Indeed, the story culminates in what has become one of the most enduring images of the genre, the terminal beach, as the Time Traveller watches the final, dying moments of the Earth before the Sun expands to swallow the planet. Wells was not optimistic about the future, and in The Time Machine he attempted to show his Victorian readers one possible means by which they might eventually bring about their own downfall. Everything about The Time Machine was fresh and original. Wells had given readers an ostensibly 'scientific' method for traversing the time streams: he posited a device created through the application of advanced science that would allow its inventor to actually visit times to come. The book was revolutionary, and in a similar way to the works of Verne it put scientific thought at the forefront of modern literature. Science had opened the door to the future. Wells did not stop there, and in the heady years that followed he produced some of the finest writing that the genre has ever seen. Who can forget the end of The War of the Worlds (1898), in which malignant Martian invaders are destroyed not by human resistance, but by a simple strain of the common cold? In this and the books that followed, including such titles as The Invisible Man (1897), The First Men in the Moon (1901) and The Island ofDr Moreau ( 1 896), Wells set out a template for the devel- opment of the genre that would eventually come to be known not by its original name of 'Scientific Romance' but as Science Fiction. Dawn of the Magazines Whilst the themes and concerns of Scientific Romance continued to attract a large readership and to be explored by many authors in Britain 12 The History and Origins of Science Fiction and Europe in the years after the First World War (the works of OLAF STAPLEDON are a notable example), a rather different development was under way in the United States. 'Pulp' magazines and 'Dime' novels began to featrure SF stories and found that their sales soared. This helped to popularize the emerging genre, generating a dedicated fan base that would later develop into both a readership and, ultimately, a good source of new authors. However, the founding of Amazing Stories magazine in 1926 by editor Hugo Gernsback represented the first real attempt to put SF before the reading public as a distinct genre in its own right. Gernsback was perfect for the job. He had previously worked as an editor on popular science magazines such as Modern Electrics and Science and Invention. Alongside scientific articles in these early magazines, Gernsback had regularly published examples of what he called 'Scientifiction' - fiction with a grounding in scientific fact. Most of it was stylistically stiff and rather too conventional, lacking the narrative drive and sense of adventure of the Scientific Romance of the day, in many cases simply acting as a text showcase for new technological ideas or gadgets. Indeed, Gernsback's sole novel, Ralph 124C41+ (1925), written along these lines, is generally regarded as unreadable today. But with the founding of Amazing Stories, things changed. Gernsback obtained the rights to republish and serialize the works of Poe, Wells and Verne, and encouraged readers to submit stories with a distinctive tech- nological edge. This in turn gave US writers an outlet for their work, and fostered a trend for technophilia in their fiction. The advent of science fiction as a mass-appeal genre was just around the corner. Amazing Stories was an immediate success, and although many of its early stories had the same faults that had plagued the tales that had appeared previously in Modern Electrics and Science and Invention, the magazine did see the first publication of writers such as E.E. 'DOC SMITH and Jack Williamson. Much of this newer, work was an early form of Space Opera, but it drew on existing genre ideas and adhered to the rules of Gernsback's 'Scientifiction'. It was not long before the unwieldy 'Scientifiction' became known as 'Science Fiction'. The genre as we know it today had received its name. Gernsback's reign at Amazing Stories was beset by financial difficulties and in 1929 he lost control of the magazine. It was sold on to other owners and continued to publish a range of stories, maintaining Gernsback's standards but serializing too a number of good pulp novels that kept it operating as a buoyant concern. John W. Campbell and the Golden Age o/SF 1 3 Gernsback himself went on to found other SF magazines such as Scientific Detective Stories and Air Wonder Stories, but never managed to repeat the success he had achieved with his former magazine, the possible exception being Wonder Stories (an amalgamation of Air Wonder Stories and Science Wonder Stories), which ran for a healthy number of issues during the early 1930s. Amazing Stories itself has been sporadically relaunched ever since, with its latest incarnation under the ownership of the games company Wizards of the Coasts ceasing publication as recently as the year 2000. It now looks set to make a return as an Internet-based concern. However, where Amazing Stories had experienced financial problems during the early 1930s, a new magazine named Astounding Stories had thrived. Astounding Stories had started publishing just four years after Amazing Stories and, offering better rates of pay, had attracted many of the other magazine's best writers. Initially, Astounding^ stories had a more adventurous slant than those that appeared in Amazing Stories, and many writers were keen to join in with the sense of pulp fun that was prevalent in the magazine at the time. Scientific speculation was a constant feature but only when it helped the writer tell the story; essentially, Astounding Stories was a melodramatic pulp. But, things were soon to change. When JOHN W. CAMPBELL took over as chief editor of Astounding Stories in 1937, the GOLDEN AGE of science fiction was about to dawn. John W. Campbell and the Golden Age of SF The original Golden Age of SF is believed by many to have occurred during the war years of 1939-43. It was arguably the most important period in SF history, and saw the emergence of many of the classic writers, as well as the establishment of a more sober and serious tone for the genre. There is little doubt that this maturing of the genre was partly due to the Second World War and the effect that it was having on the mood of the time, but much of it can also be put down to the constant and attentive work of editor John W. Campbell. A little more than a year after Campbell had taken over as editor of Astounding Stories, he had already changed the name. Astounding Science Fiction was the new legend that was printed on the front of each issue, and with this change in title came an important and revolutionary change in content. 14 The History and Origins of Science Fiction The year 1939 saw the debuts of a number of important SF authors - ROBERT A. HEINLEIN, THEODORE STURGEON, A. E. VAN VOGT - as well as good work from established writers such as ISAAC ASIMOV and E. E. 'Doc' Smith. Campbell nurtured these authors, insisting that they worked through fully and logically any ideas they proposed and asking them to consider the sociological and psychological effects of their notions and to translate them into stories of greater maturity and depth. The authors responded enthusiastically and although it alienated some readers who had grown to admire the more pulp-orientated theme of the magazine, it turned Astounding Science Fiction into the true mouthpiece of the genre. The Golden Age period saw the development of many of the key concepts of SF that would later come to define the field. The authors took ideas from the pages of the early pulps, and then subverted them, turning them into something new and even more exciting. Science became an integral part of many of the stories, as authors developed aspects of\" current scientific theories or ideas. Indeed, some of these writers were scientists in their own right. It was from this heady brew that the important sub-genre of HARD SF was to be distilled, a form of powerfully science-loaded SF that would later, in a further incarnation, come to dominate the magazine. During the years from 1939 to 1943 Astounding Science Fiction featured some of the most wonderful short stories and serializations ever to be written. Heinlein developed his FUTURE HISTORY in its pages, Asimov his Robot and Foundation sequences, Van Vogt published Slan and Smith his entire Lensman saga. Campbell encouraged them all, and when L. RON HUBBARD proposed his pseudo-science, 'Dianetics', Campbell encouraged him too. Campbell devoted himself to the ideal of raising the standards of SF and providing readers with steadfast adven- ture stories that were nevertheless fully thought out and expertly realized. It is hard to quantify the overall effect that Campbell had on genre fiction; many authors credit him with having provided not just the impetus to write intelligent and coherent science fiction, but the actual ideas on which they were to base their stories and novels. The Golden Age period is a testament to his editorial skills. Campbell remained in the editorial seat of Astounding Science Fiction until his death in 1971, overseeing a further change of name - to ANALOG - and a later reassessment of the magazine's contents. It continues to be published under the latter name today. After the war years, there was an inevitable change in the way in which The 'Cosy Catastrophe ' and the Reader as Hero 1 5 SF was both published and perceived. Magazines continued to thrive, and if Astounding Science Fiction was seen to be growing a little stale, a little too emphatic about the 'hard' sciences such as physics, chemistry and biology, then newer magazines such as THE MAGAZINE OF FANTASY AND SCIENCE FICTION and GALAXY were just begin- ning. These magazines saw a shift towards the 'softer' sciences such as psychology and sociology, and demanded a higher level of literary ability from their writers. Authors such as PHILIP K. DICK and ALFRED BESTER were writing their own particular brands of SF, more experi- mental stories that would never have found a market in Campbell's Astounding Science Fiction. Over in Britain, NEW WORLDS was making an impact with similar material and during the 1950s its editor, John Carnell, would reprint many of the excellent stories that appeared in the American magazines of this time. The 1930s and 1940s also saw a number of mainstream authors such as ALDOUS HUXLEY in Brave New World (1932) and GEORGE ORWELL in Ninteen Eighty-Four (1949) make use of SF ideas and concepts. In some ways this highlights the shift in the public's perception of the genre that was beginning to take place. Science fiction was becoming respectable. The 'Cosy Catastrophe' and the Reader as Hero The 1950s brought with it a boom in paperback publishing, in which SF shared. In the US Ace Books began running a series of back-to-back novels, Ace Doubles, featuring two different authors presented in one paperback. Philip K. Dick, amongst others, made this his home territory. Science fiction was beginning to move away from a magazine-domi- nated market and into the world of books, and this meant that full-length novels had to be written quickly and efficiently. Dick fuelled his vast output with amphetamines, but most other authors kept to more reliable methods. In some ways this lengthening of the basic SF format meant a partial return to the pulp disciplines of the genre: writers' word-outputs had to increase significantly. In other ways, however, it provided greater scope for characterization and the detailed exploration of psychological and sociological themes. This in turn led gradually to a general darkening of tone and a less optimistic outlook on the future. The end of the Second World War had been a triumphant time for the Allied forces, and there were inevitable celebrations as the soldiers 16 The History and Origins of Science Fiction returned home. But as time passed people began to realize the startling effect that the war had had on their lives and to understand more fully the devastation it had wrought across the globe. The 1950s was a time of consolidation and recuperation as the world took stock of the damage and families came to terms with their losses of loved ones. No one wanted to read about heroic superhumans saving the world or about ambitious space missions. Public perceptions were changing, and with them the protago- nists who inhabited the pages of SF. The self-reliant hero was gone, and in his place stood the average man (women's liberation by the 1960s feminist movement lay some years in the future), much like the typical SF reader who, far from being a daredevil who knew how to react in any given situation, stood bemused and baffled by the changing world around him. If aliens invaded, they preyed on small towns with no impregnable protection, or took over the minds of ordinary individuals so that nobody would notice until it was too late. This is typified nowhere better than in the work of the British writer JOHNWYNDHAM. Wyndam's writing shifted up a gear after the war; whereas before he had mainly written pseudonymous pulp fiction, he now began publishing disaster novels that mirrored people's fear of foreign invasion and the political paranoia caused by the advent of the Cold War. His most famous novel, The Day of the Triffids (1951), has a pervasive sense of unease about it, exactly the type of 'man against the world' scenario that was typical of the SF of the day. The chief protagonist's sight is saved because he is blindfolded (following hospital treatment) when orbital flares scorch the vision of most of the world's population. Genetically modified mobile plants, 'Triffids', with lethal whiplike stings attempt to take over, capital- izing on the fact that nearly everyone is blind. They soon gain a hold and eventually the bewildered protagonist, his female partner and their child retreat to a secure area - the Isle of Wight - where they can try to live out a 'normal' existence. The critical point is this: he does not attempt to save the world (though he is determined, at the end of the novel, to devote his life to eradicating the triffid menace) and he is not a 'typical' hero. He is a man trying to protect his family from the horrors of a world in decline and wants nothing more than to survive - something every reader can relate to. There is no room for wish-fulfilment in the stories of this period, no time for high adventure or monster-bashing. People only wanted to make sense of the changing world around them. Typically, in Wyndham's novel middle-class virtues prevail and survival, of a kind, is secured for the main characters. A comfortable The Loss of Optimism and the Advent of the New Wave 17 compromise solution for those who had just faced the terrors of a world war and emerged as victors. Brian Aldiss coined a phrase to describe this kind of resolution - the 'Cosy Catastrophe' - a disaster story in which traditional values are the main bulwark against cataclysm. This ethos did not significantly outlast the decade. The 1960s saw yet another change of pace, and whilst the hippies of the time got down and made love, the science fiction writers were growing ever more pessimistic. The Loss of Optimism and the Advent of the New Wave As pessimism about the future took an ever stronger hold within the ranks of SF writers, they turned away from the outside world and began to question the very nature of reality itself. This shift of focus was coupled with a philosophical search for the essence of human existence. Writers were beginning to view the human mind as the next frontier to be explored - we'd already done the Solar System - and the increased use of psychedelic drugs was having a big effect. The barriers between inner and outer realities had become blurred. Philip K. Dick in particular explored this theme, along with his quirkily metaphysical examination of religion and the religious impulse. This resulted in some wondrous, if surreal novels like The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch (1965) and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968). These novels represent Dick's urge to explain the world around him in terms of the people who inhabited it. In a world gone mad, how do we tell what reality is, and if we cannot define reality, then how do we define ourselves? Similarly, his classic The Man in the High Castle (1962) ques- tions the events of history and asks what would have become of us had the Germans won the war? Science fiction was becoming philosophical, and with this philosophizing came a stronger desire to view SF as a valid form of literature, a medium in which it was legitimate to search for the answers to the major questions of human existence. In Britain, this best manifested itself in the NEW WAVE movement, which was centred around New Worlds magazine and its new editor, the young MICHAEL MOORCOCK. Moorcock was interested in experimentalism and the urge of a new generation of authors to redefine the genre. In his own way, he is as impor- tant and relevant to any history of the genre as John W. Campbell, in that the work that he chose to publish in New Worlds revolutionized the genre and in such a way that SF would never be the same again. It is hard to put a finger on what the New Wave movement came to 18 The History and Origins of Science Fiction represent, so open were its boundaries and so intangible was its effect. Moorcock encouraged authors like J. G. BALLARD and Brian Aldiss, among many others, to deconstruct the typical form of the SF short story and rebuild it as something new. Aldiss remained content to subvert the typical genre ideas and toy with the effects; Ballard began writing what he called 'condensed novels' - short stories with an emphasis on non- linearity and the depiction of desolate landscapes; Moorcock himself developed his surreal and apathetic Jerry Cornelius character, who remains, perhaps, his most enduring creation. The key to the New Wave was the manner in which it viewed its subject - cynically, but as a form of literature, as ready to be exploited as any other genre. The result was phenomenal. Moorcock encouraged his writers to adopt more mainstream concerns such as unconventional narrative structure and characterization. This cross-fertilization meant that the science would often be subsumed by the style and form of the story; to the people who were writing it, it was the story that counted. The authors became more concerned with the sociological impact of their ideas, or with the psychological effects that they might have. Much of what they wrote was satire, and much of it remained cynical and pessimistic. Indeed, one thing that was very prominent in much of the writing of this time was the obses- sion with the notions of entropy and dissolution that arose. Ballard partic- ularly viewed the world as a crumbling landscape, a planet on the slippery slide to oblivion along with its dominant species. One of his best works, the short story The Terminal Beach, is chillingly effective in its description of the ultimate need for humanity to surround itself with devastation. It was not long before New Wave sensibilities had crossed the Atlantic and begun to affect the American SF authors' way of thinking. Thomas M. Disch first published his wonderful Camp Concentration (as a novel, 1968) in Moorcock's magazine, whilst SAMUEL R. DELANY sold him the engaging Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones. HARLAN ELLISON, one of the great American SF stylists, edited perhaps the most representative anthology sequences of the time, Dangerous Visions (1967) and its sequel Again, Dangerous Visions (1972), did the same thing for the US market that New Worlds was doing in Britain. The future, for SF authors, was becoming a dark and miserable place, an Earth that none of us would want very much to inhabit. Unlike the disaster novels of the 1950s, the dystopias of the 1960s were here to stay. Indeed, this pessimism saw SF right through the 1960s and into the early 1970s, a decade that would at first see its fiction concerning itself Disaster Averted 1 9 with large-scale disaster and the terrors of Vietnam. But then, with the advent of the movie STAR WARS in 1977, came a surge of optimism. This was also inspired by the Moon landings at the end of the 1960s and a growing and renewed confidence in the possibilities of technology. Disaster Averted The beginning of the 1970s in SF resembled the 1960s as far as the main preoccupations of the genre's authors went. Environmental disaster and fears about OVERPOPULATION lay heavy on their hearts. John Brunner was halfway through his seminal quartet of ecological novels, Stand On Zanzibar (1968), The Jagged Orbit (1969), The Sheep Look Up (1972) and The Shockwave Rider (1975) when the decade began, and they remained representative of New Wave concerns. Vietnam had also inspired a rash of antiwar SF novels, as well as a number of books examining the psychological effects of MILITARY life. JOE HALDEMAN's The Forever War (1975) is a touching and brutal exploration of these themes. But, with a gradually increasing confidence in technology came a different line of reasoning: could science not provide us with the means of avoiding these disasters? SF had come full circle, and although it would never return to the happy naivety of its youth, the genre began once again to see science as a possible salvation of the species. LARRY NIVEN, in his extraordinary novel Ringworld (1970), sought to put an end to many fears of overpopulation. A space arcology could be built around the sun to provide enough living space for all of humanity. If maintained with the proper skill and attention, there would be no need ever to worry about the increasing population again - anything was possible if we would only put our minds to it. Ringworld is a dramatic and inspiring novel, and is written with exceptional speculative scientific skill. Other writers saw the key to the overpopulation problem as the terraforming of Mars or other nearby planets, using science to make them capable of supporting human life. Their atmospheres could be adapted to make them breathable, while their soils could be fed nutrients that would allow plant life and crops to grow. Soon the pages of SF were filled with stories of an inhabited Moon and a verdant Mars. This was not the Mars of the early pulp romances, but a realistically conceived human colony that would use technological know-how as a tool for survival. There were other means available, too. If the planet could not be changed to suit us, the new science of GENETIC engineering might 20 The History and Origins of Science Fiction mean that we could change to suit the planet. The human form could become malleable, and we would be masters of our own destiny. FRED- ERIK POHL describes in convincing and humane detail the trials of a man adapted to exist on the hostile surface of Mars in Man Plus (1976). Indeed, Astounding Science Fiction magazine, which had continued to publish fairly standard Campbellian SF throughout the 1950s and 1960s, had already reinvented itself during 1960 as Analog: Science Fact and Fiction. It became known as the definitive magazine for Hard SF and remains so today. The pessimistic bubble had burst, and it seemed that optimism was once again on the increase. This was compounded by the release of two important movies in 1977. Both Star Wars and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND saw humanity TRANSCENDING its roots as an Earthbound species and spreading out to the stars. The two movies are very different from each other - Star Wars is a Science Fantasy that aimed to provide the modern viewer with a new myth (it partially succeeded) whilst Close Encounters saw friendly aliens arriving to show us the delights of the universe. Both viewed humanity as corruptible, but inherently good. The 1970s also saw a rise in the number of female authors associated with the genre, thanks to the feminist revolution. URSULA K. LE GUIN saw the genre as the perfect proving ground for her ideas, and set about deconstructing the Utopian state in her seminal novel The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia (1974). She had previously used the genre as a means of tackling complex GENDER issues in The Left Hand of Darkness (1969). OCTAVIA BUTLER followed suit, and her fiction tackled issues of race as well as of gender. Both these writers were enabled, through the genre, to tackle important issues through the use of allusion and metaphor that would have perhaps become too complex in any other form of literature. SF was becoming cosmopolitan and beginning to. look towards a brighter, inclusive future. But, with talk of developing technologies and advancements in science came questions about the role of machines in human society. Some saw the increasing role of computer technology as a threat, both to their liveli- hoods and to their humanity. Others came to see computers as the ulti- mate tool, the means by which the human race could progress to the next level of its existence. Computers were fast and efficient, and it was not long before authors had worked out how to incorporate them into human Man Meets Machine 21 biology. Man met machine, and attempted to assimilate it. CYBER- PUNK was born. Man Meets Machine The early 1980s saw a downturn in the amount of SF being published. Perhaps this was partly due to the new cosmopolitan feel of the genre: more than at any previous time SF was heading in several directions at once, reassessing its values and boundaries and, as a genre aware of its own fragility, lacking a certain confidence. But SF was growing more and more inclusive. Science too was beginning to catch up with SF and it was becoming increasingly difficult for writers to keep pace with the original source of their inspiration. It was not that these writers wished to predict the future - true SF has never been about that - it was simply that real science was having all the good ideas first. There had also been an increase in the amount of escapist Quest Fantasy being published and read, most of it derived from J. R. R. Tolkien and The Lord of the Rings (1954â5). Some authors had had a measure of success during the 1970s with similar sequences of novels, and the lure of a quick buck had turned many a head over the intervening years. However, the SF that was appearing was more diverse than ever. GENE WOLFE began the decade with the publication of the first instalment of The Book of the New Sun (1980-83), an elaborate and literary multi-volume novel that masqueraded as a fantasy but was actu- ally an acute and healthy piece of FAR FUTURE SF. It remains the best treatment of the Dying Earth theme to date. In Britain, IAIN M. BANKS was having fun producing satirical Space Opera of a kind not seen for years. Consider Phlebas (1987) began his long sequence of Culture novels, describing an immense interstellar society of humans and aliens who are often at odds with each other and the universe around them. Importantly, Banks was drawing not only on the early pulp roots of the genre but on everything that had come to pass since. In essence, his SF is Space Opera that is both lyrical and adventurous, philo- sophical and fun. GREG BEAR would also make headway during the 1980s with the publication of Blood Music (1985), a detailed and expressive piece of Hard SF that saw humanity tinkering with its own microbiology, programming their bodily fluids to rather dramatic and astounding effect. This repre- sented the first step on the road to a new and radical Hard SF movement 22 The History and Origins of Science Fiction that would come about in the early years of the 1990s. There was a lot going on. However, there remains one important development above all others from the early 1980s that has gone on to inform nearly all of the SF that has followed it over the last fifteen years: Cyberpunk, the sub-genre concerned with the melding of man and machine into an exotic and often highly volatile amalgam. The relationship between humanity and the machines of its own creation was not a new field of exploration for SF, but with the increasing intrusion of science into everyday life, as well as the incredible progress being made in computer science specifically, it was ripe for examination. Cyberpunk touches on many things. On the surface it is a sub-genre obsessed with the noir, a seedy, gritty realism that has as much to do with style as content. Scratch the surface and you come to the crux of the matter - cyberpunk is about the struggle for dominance between mankind and machines and the way in which developing technology will come to influence our lives. Another important aspect of cyberpunk is the people it chooses to represent, the people who fill its pages and throng its mean streets or plug themselves into their computers to communicate with the world. Like the disaster novels of the 1950s, the books that were appearing during the early to mid-1980s had predominantly 'normal' people as their subjects, the typical man or woman in the street, and were showing the reader how new and developing technology had impacted on their lives. The sub-genre itself draws its name from a short story, Cyberpunk (1983) by BRUCE BETHKE. (The story was later revised as a novel and - appropriately - is available in electronic form for download over the Internet). Indeed, there are many fine examples of the early Cyberpunk novel (BRUCE STERLING'S Islands in the Net (1987) being one) and as a sub-genre it reinvented itself with each new breath. However, as a mode of writing it is best typified by the now-classic novel, Neuromancer (1984) by WILLIAM GIBSON. Neuromancer was strange and new. It described the exotic realms of 'Cyberspace', a kind of VIRTUAL REALITY Internet into which people could become completely absorbed, using IMPLANTED tech- nology to interface directly with their computers. This is not virtual reality in the sense that we know it, this is a reality wholly different from our own. The computer has learned to control the functions of the human brain, and any experiences that take place in CYBERSPACE are as valid as those that do not. A new DIMENSION has been born. Man Meets Machine 23 Almost as if by necessity, as a means of making cyberspace more attrac- tive, the near-future 'real' world described in Neuromancer is sliding head first into dystopia. Crime, drugs and poverty rule the streets, and the big corporations are as corrupt as any government. The story itself follows the progress of a cyberspace hacker who has tried to rip off his bosses and as a result has had his nervous system sabotaged so that he cannot return to the digital realm. It becomes a search for identity in a world of blos- soming multiple realities, as well as a rich and influential examination of humanity. The book asks if it is only our biology that makes us human, if only our genes set us apart from the ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) we create? When we plug into a machine, and the machine talks back, is it still just a tool for human use, or has it become something more? Are computer programmers dehumanizing the world with their creations, like latter-day Frankensteins caught up in the tide of progress? Artificial Intelligence had been a concern of the genre for a number of years; indeed, the ANDROID theme had been explored to great effect by such writers as ROBERT SILVERBERG in Tomer of Glass (1970) and Philip K. Dick in Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? RIDLEY SCOTT had explored it on the screen in BLADE RUNNER (1982), which tackled the themes of Dick's book - on which it was loosely based - whilst at the same time attempting to depict visually the cynical angst of the Cyberpunk movement. However, this was a new type of intelligence, an electronic construct that was just around the corner and that would inhabit the invisible data banks between realities. In 1968 cinema audiences had seen the computer Hal turn on its colleagues in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. But what cyberpunk was positing was the birth of a new virtual species, a species that did not neces- sarily want to be affiliated with humanity. There followed a flood of novels and stories about the awakening of this new electronic species. Not all of them were confident of the human race's ability to control these machines, showing them bringing about the destruction of Earth. Others were more optimistic, portraying AI as the next step in human evolution, the first point at which transcendence of the flesh would be achieved. Gone were the days of religious heavens or hells; humans and machines together could construct their own other-worldly realms and computer technology was the new religion. The possibilities for these electronic entities were endless; not bound by physical form, they could exist in any other guise they wanted. Not only that, they could program their own realities around them to fulfil 24 The History and Origins of Science Fiction their every desire. If machines were going to have this much fun, then human beings wanted a piece of the action. It was not long before SF authors were portraying humanity down- loading itself into its machines so to that it could cohabit with the new breed of electronic entities. Many writers saw this as giving their charac- ters a form of immortality, a haven to retreat to instead of old-fashioned death. In this way they could later communicate with the living, or, alter- natively, become something even greater, 'beyond human'. This was to become one of the key concerns of SF in the 1990s: the quest for the means of transcendence through science and technology rather than through spirituality. Allusions would no longer do, however, and writers wanted to know exactly how their characters would make this leap into the next life. New theories of quantum physics also meant the serious possibility of space travel. SF was beginning to return to the dreams of its youth. This time, though, there was one fundamental difference. Real science. The new radical Hard SF movement had begun. The New Wave of Radical Hard SF and the Rebirth of Space Opera As the 1990s began, British SF was having a renaissance of its own. The 1980s had seen the launch of a new SF magazine, INTERZONE, that had plugged the hole left by the passing of New Worlds in the 1970s. Interzone did much to encourage the emerging British writers who were developing on their own terms the notions of the American Cyberpunk movement. The Australian writer GREG EGAN contributed much to the magazine, and his second novel, Permutation City (1994) was a very 'hard' and very scientific exploration of the Artificial Intelligence issue and of the possible transcendence of the human form. It set out in confident and plausible detail the means by which a digital virtual reality realm could be constructed and opened up to the 'real' world. When Egan wrote about computer programming, the readers believed him. There was more. STEPHEN BAXTER had begun writing his massive Xeelee sequence, which posited a Future History for the human species and used detailed, accurate physics to describe everything from space travel to the inner workings of stars. PAUL J. McAULEY was tinkering in his SF with human biology, showing how computers and NANOTECHNOLOGY - molecule-size machines - could be used to manipulate human genes to develop new strains of life. The New Wave of Radical Hard SF and the Rebirth of Space Opera 25 A similar thing was happening in America. Greg Bear had already rein- vented our blood supply during the mid-1980s and now he was tackling space travel and AI in Queen of Angels (1990). KIM STANLEY ROBINSON had worked out the best way to approach Mars - with science and politics in harmony with human needs. His Mars trilogy, Red Mars (1992), Green Mars (1993) and Blue Mars (1996), charts the progressive terraforming of the Red Planet in wonderful, intricate detail. Hard SF was on the increase, and it was aiming for absolute accuracy. However, there was almost a counter-movement going on in reaction. Space Opera had returned with a vengeance. In Britain, Iain M. Banks continued his drive to produce quality space fiction, while PETER F. HAMILTON provided us with his gargantuan Night's Dawn trilogy: The Reality Dysfunction (1996), The Neutronium Alchemist (1997) and The Naked God (1999), an epic tale that combined elements from SF's entire range of ideas and effects. In America various series of Military SF novels were beginning to appear. DAVID FEINTUCH'S Seafort Saga and ELIZABETH MOON's Serrano Legacy are two of the finest 'Hornbloweresque' sequences that follow the progress of their respective characters as they work their way up through different military hierarchies. However, this new Space Opera was not simply naive adventure. There were serious issues to be dealt with, and at the same time the writers sought to explain the inner workings of their worlds. There was science here, as always, but it was kept underneath the layers of adventure and fun. In many respects, the resurgence in Space Opera was a reaction to the still overzealous production of generic fantasy. These fantasies often appeared in large series or enormous tomes, offering the reader a sense of perceived value. The new Space Operas that were appearing worked in much the same way, with regularly published additions to the series, or physically large multi-volume works. This had the effect of getting SF back onto the bookshop shelves, thereby re-establishing its commercial credentials. 'Literary' SF was also enjoying modest success. New writers like JEFF NOON and PAUL DI FILIPPO were pushing the boundaries of the genre ever further out into the ether. Both apply a skewed Dickian logic to their imagined worlds, and both appear to view the world through increasingly bizarre eyes. It is as if, by portraying the world through surrealist, non linear fiction, they get closer to the strange reality that is modern existence. It is too early to tell if they are right. As the 1990s drew to a close, the genre was in a healthy state. 26 The History and Origins of Science Fiction Speculation about its future was positive in tone, and if many of the really big ideas in the genre had been explored before, the writers now had the science to enable them to look at the details. As science focused increas- ingly on nano-level matters, the details of SF got finer and finer, while its scope continued to be as big as the imagination of its writers. Science fiction was alive and well, and looked set to carry its readers forward into the twenty-first century. Where Do We Go From Here? It is perhaps too soon to be able to identify the main themes that emerged in SF during the 1990s. There was a definite attempt to develop the themes of the 1980s, an effort to apply real scientific thinking to ideas about Artificial Intelligence and the uses to which it might be put. There was also a shift towards genetic concerns and a search for an alternative 'biological' transcendence. Speculation about nanotechnology informed much of the later fiction of the decade, filling its pages with wonder and surprise. Technology is becoming the new magic, able to conjure up elec- tronic spectres or define for us a new reality. It seems inevitable that humanity is eventually going to step forward into the next stage of its evolution, and whilst many people are prepared to wait for the natural process to run its course, many others are not. CLONING is now a real possibility; Mars has been visited again by robot probes in recent years and there are more unmanned missions to come; the International Space Station is under way and scientists have built an 'engine' the size of a grain of sand. Science fiction helps us to prepare for the effects on human society of these things, both through careful analysis of their possible impact and through reasoned warnings about the haste with which we adopt new technologies. As the future looms larger, the SF genre becomes ever more relevant to our understanding of the life we live now. Suggested Further Reading Undoubtedly the best history of the genre is Brian Aldiss and David Wingrove's Trillion Year Spree (1986, the revised edition of Aldiss's earlier (1973) Billion Year Spree). For a more American perspective, Thomas M. Disch's The Dreams Our Stuff is Made Of( 1 998) is a first-rate combination of analysis and memoir. Science Fiction on the Page ABBOTT, EDWIN (1839-1926), Great Britain Edwin Abbott, clergyman, teacher and scholar, published the novel Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions in 1884, originally under the pseudonym of its chief protagonist, Mr A. Square. This is a seminal work that can be seen as a precursor to HARD SF, as it is based upon a highly plausible mathematical theory that it uses as a metaphor to explore the world. There is also an inherent SENSE OF WONDER in Flatland characteristic of the SF genre. The novel follows the progress of Mr A. Square as he finds himself transported between DIMENSIONS and learns to come to terms with his altered perception of the universe. The story is ingenious and ahead of its time, a direct forerunner of many later novels that explore ALTER- NATIVE REALITIES and altered states. It can also be viewed as a social satire, commenting on the very distinct class structure that existed in Abbott's time. With Flatland, Abbott successfully employs elements of the fantastic as a way of expressing a mathematical theory. Writers such as STEPHEN BAXTER and GREGORY BENFORD have also made much use of mathematical physics as an aid to describe the nature of the universe.

It was the success of his comic radio series, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (originally broadcast in 1978) that prompted Adams to rework the script into a novelization that retained the same title and was published in 1979. Dark and caustic, but nevertheless brimming with satirical humour, the novel has become a classic of modern COMIC SF. The book opens with its chief protagonist, Arthur Dent, narrowly escaping the destruction of the Earth. He is smuggled aboard an alien craft that has arrived to aid the demolition of the planet to make way for a 'bypass' in space. Once aboard, we follow Arthur's progress as he goes on to encounter many strange and surreal people and situations. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy spawned a number of sequels that, although often hilarious, are less consistent in quality than their prede- cessor. They are The Restaurant at the End of the Universe (1980), Life, the Universe and Everything (1982), So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish (1984) and Mostly Harmless (1992). Together they comprise Adams's 'trilogy in five parts'. Throughout the series Adams's humour darkens, and by Mostly Harmless it is clear that he views the human condition through particu- larly uncharitable eyes. However, this sharpens the overall tone of the series; the books are enhanced by Adams's keen observations. It is easy to see from where many later works, including the comic tele- vision series RED DWARF, have drawn their inspiration. A second and less well-known sequence of novels by Adams follows the activities of Dirk Gently, a private eye whose adventures contain elements of the fantastic cross-fertilized with pulp crime. The books in this series are Dirk Gently 's Holistic Detective Agency ( 1 987), The Long Dark Teatime of the Soul( 1988) and the projected Salmon of Doubt. Before his death on 1 1 May, 2001 Adams was rumoured to be working on a new instalment in the Dirk Gently sequence. This was perhaps one of the most anticipated of genre novels - it now remains to be seen whether it will ever see publication. In the meantime, the other incarnations of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (it has also been filmed by the BBC) and its sequels continue to entertain the many fans of COMIC SF.

Dublin, IRELAND Website address: http://homepages.iol.ie/~bobn Albedo One is the premier Irish magazine of SF, Fantasy and Horror. Recent issues have boasted a printed cover, but the magazine still contains a black-and-white photocopied interior. However, the editorial and literary quality of the contents more than makes up for this. A typical issue will contain four or five stories, an interview and a worthwhile collection of book reviews. Regular contributors include BRIAN STABLEFORD, Hugh Cook and David Murphy. Albedo One manages to blend successfully good-quality fiction with some excellent non-fiction, offering a balanced magazine that could, from the purely aesthetic point of view, benefit from some enhanced produc- tion values. ALDISS, BRIAN (1925- ), Great Britain Brian Aldiss is one of the grand masters of British SF, but is also renowned as a critic, poet and mainstream novelist. His name has a strong association 32 Science Fiction on the Page with NEW WORLDS magazine and the NEW WAVE, although Aldiss was writing long before the advent of this movement and his work was already concerned with many of the issues that would later identify it. His first novel, Non-Stop (1958), took as its setting a vast GENERA- TION STARSHIP, the inhabitants having, over many years, lost track of their surroundings and forgotten altogether that they were on a starship. When curiosity gets the better of Roy Complain, the chief protagonist, he sets out to explore uncharted territory and he goes on to discover the truth about their environment. It is a classic of the genre and one of the most satisfying examinations of the generation-starship concept. Hothouse (1962) was Aldiss's next major work, winning the HUGO AWARD for its year. It remains one of his most intriguing novels to date. Set in a dark FAR FUTURE at a point when the sun is about to go nova, it describes how the remnants of the human race struggle to survive in the branches of an enormous banyan tree that has grown to cover an entire face of the Earth. These little green people find themselves pitted against highly evolved and dangerous insect and plant life. Aldiss succeeds in creating a vision of the distant future that is entirely alien to our current perceptions of the world and our place within it. Other excellent work by Aldiss includes the short-story collection Space, Time and Nathaniel (1957), the evocatively ALIEN Helliconia Trilogy (1982-85) and the psychedelic Barefoot in the Head (1969), cited as one of the most important books of the New Wave movement. Barefoot in the Head is a difficult book in which, after the 'Acid Head War' has taken place and the entire culture has been subjected to hallu- cinogenic drugs, a new MESSIANIC figure is created. However, when he finds himself on the cusp of believing in his own ability to perform mira- cles, he casts the role away. It is not Aldiss's best book, but it does encap- sulate much of what the New Wave was trying to say and is very much a product of its time. Similar themes are explored in MICHAEL MOORCOCK'S Behold the Man (1969). Aldiss is also the author of the controversial Billion Year Spree (1973) (greatly revised and expanded in 1986 as Trillion Year Spree, with David Wingrove), a detailed history of the SF genre that was the first book to herald MARY SHELLEY's Frankenstein (1818) as the first true SF novel. This is an argument much more accepted by the SF establishment today; originally Aldiss was ridiculed and his book failed to meet with reviews. The later edition, however, went on to win a HUGO AWARD, and, along with THOMAS DISCH'S The Dreams Our Stuff is Made Of (1998), remains one of the best historical studies of the genre. Aldiss, Brian 33 Aldiss also put this theory into fictionalized form in his excellent novel Frankenstein Unbound (1973), which sees a scientist from the twentieth century journeying back in time to the early nineteenth century where he encounters both Mary Shelley and avatars of her literary creations. After an engaging autobiography, The Twinkling of An Eye (1998), and a moving tribute to his late wife, When the Feast is Finished (1999), Aldiss returned to SF, in collaboration with scientist and writer Roger Penrose, with White Mars (1999). Subtitled 'A Modern Utopia', the book deals with the colonization of the Red Planet and the socio-political considera- tions that such a move would entail. It stutters, however, falling over itself with dry passages and lacking the sheer inventiveness of some of Aldiss's earlier work. It is not a bad book - it is simply that Aldiss has shown us in the past the dizzying heights that he is capable of reaching. As a critic, Aldiss has made an enormous contribution to the genre. As a novelist, his work is quintessential.

This is not because of any particular aspect of the magazine's format, or indeed any of the stories that it contained, but Amazing Stories 35 simply because it was the first in a long line of magazines to concentrate solely on SF, and gave the genre both a home and a name. Amazing Stories was founded by HUGO GERNSBACK in 1926 and lasted under his editorship for only three brief years before being sold on because of bankruptcy. Nevertheless, the impact that it had on the reading public was phenomenal. Gernsback had had previous success with a number of early popular- science magazines such as Science and Invention, for which he had produced a selection of pedagogic stories of 'scientifiction' to publish alongside the more mundane non-fiction articles. Their immediate popu- larity prompted him to launch Amazing Stories, a magazine intended to focus solely on this 'scientifiction', a genre of pulp fiction that soon became known as 'science fiction'. Amazing Stories was in many respects a pulp magazine, but Gernsback did place a very definite emphasis on scientific speculation and the demon- stration of scientific ideas. It reprinted stories by H. G. WELLS, JULES VERNE and EDGAR ALLEN POE, and early pulp SPACE OPERA orig- inated in its pages with stories by authors like of E. E. 'DOC SMITH. But after Gernsback lost control of the magazine in 1929 and Amazing was sold on to various other publishing houses, it tended to take a back seat while the newer, fresher ASTOUNDING SCIENCE FICTION took its place as market leader. Amazing continued to publish for many years under a succession of different owners, the most recent being the role-playing-games company Wizards of the Coast. This more recent incarnation of the magazine featured a large proportion of media tie-in fiction alongside its more typical SF, and finally ceased publication in August 2000. The future of the magazine seems uncertain. However, the legacy of Amazing Stories is an important one to the SF genre. Gernsback was the first editor to realize that the emerging genre was in need of a dedicated home, and in providing one he helped bring about the genre as we know it. Without Amazing Stories, other SF maga- zines might not have appeared on the market and SF authors would have been left without a means of publishing their work. Indeed, the prolifera- tion of the SF genre today can largely be put down to Gernsback's early attempts to publicize his magazine and involve young American readers in the quest to develop a new mode of speculative writing. Some critics believe that Gernsback's rigidity stifled the imagination of writers who would otherwise have provided him with more exciting and daring space adventures, but it remains a fact that without Amazing Stories the genre would have never had the popular kick-start that it needed. 36 Science Fiction on the Page ANALOG Editor: Stanley Schmidt Monthly Subscription address: PO Box 54625, Boulder CO 80323-4625 Website address: http://www.sfsite.com Analog is consecutively the longest-running SF magazine in existence. The magazine began life in 1930 as Astounding Stories, and under the editorship of Harry Bates provided an early challenger to AMAZING STORIES. With higher rates of pay, and therefore a better calibre of author, it was not long before Astounding Stories snatched the first-place position from its competitor. The magazine successfully operated as a quality pulp until 1937, at which point the now legendary JOHN W. CAMPBELL assumed the editor's chair and changed the name of the magazine to the more appropriate Astounding Science Fiction. A year later he instigated a new editorial policy that eventually gave rise to the GOLDEN AGE of SF, as he discovered and encouraged a number of key writers to produce thoughtful, character-based stories with logical, scien- tific premises. Important authors who produced work during this period include ROBERT HEINLEIN, ISAAC ASIMOV, THEODORE STURGEON, A. E. VAN VOGT and E. E. 'DOC SMITH. The Golden Age period is seen as lasting during the war period from about 1938 to 1943. In essence, true SF was born and consolidated in the pages of Astounding Science Fiction during this time. Campbell continued in his editor's role until he died in 1971. It is reported that he became increasingly difficult to deal with during his later years, and it is certainly true that the magazine failed to change with the times. Campbell maintained his rigid editorial policy, and although good fiction continued to appear in the pages of Astounding Science Fiction, the real revolutions were happening elsewhere. In 1960 the magazine changed its name to the present Analog, in recognition of the fact that the market had diversified, and Astounding Science Fiction had become known as the last magazine home of proper HARD SF. Author BEN BOV A took over the editor's position after Campbell and relaxed the editorial policy a little, allowing a greater variety of stories to be published in Analog. This had the effect of broadening the readership and encouraging a wider selection of new authors to publish their work in the magazine. Bova resigned from his editorial post in 1978 to be succeeded by Stanley Schmidt who still occuies the position today. The current Analog remains the true bastion of American Hard SF. It is now published as a monthly digest and a sister magazine to ASIMOV'S Anderson, Kevin J. 37 SCIENCE FICTION, and frequently features stories by leading names in the Hard SF field. There are also regular popular-science articles and non-fiction departments, including book reviews and recommendations. The magazine, like many of the more recently established periodicals, tends not to serialize novels any longer, but it does feature a high propor- tion of novellas and novelettes alongside its shorter stories. Its reputation and history alone make Analog worth reading. It continues to publish quality Hard SF, and while its sister magazine Asimov's Science Fiction may have a more relaxed and broader-based editorial policy, it is still heartening to see a magazine that maintains its appeal for a smaller, dedicated readership. After over seventy years of continuous publication, Analog has become an institution in itself. Analog has also been nominated for and awarded a huge number of genre awards over the years. ANDERSON, KEVIN J. (1962- ), USA Kevin J. Anderson is an author who seems to work best in collaboration with other authors, ot within the previously defined boundaries of a SHARED WORLD setting. This is not meant to play down his skill as a writer of genre fiction but to highlight his own particular strengths. The latter point is best typified by Anderson's work for the STAR WARS and X-FILES franchises, within which he has made his name with novels such as Darksaber (1995) and Antibodies (1997). It is Anderson's ability to breathe life into these franchises, making their worlds his own, that has led to him being labelled as one of the most proficient shared-world authors of recent years. This success has also led to his collaboration with BRIAN HERBERT, son of FRANK HERBERT, on a trilogy of authorized preludes to the famous Dune sequence. Beginning with House Atreides (1999), and continuing with House Harkonnen (2000) and House Corrino (projected, 2001), the series is a consistent addition to the Dune canon. Although lacking the epic scope of Herbert's original novel, these books do offer an interesting account of the early lives of some of the characters that 'later' appear in the classic. Indeed, it is fair to say that even Frank Herbert's original sequence began to narrow in scope with each extra book that was published. Anderson's best work to date, however, has been in collaboration with American writer Doug Beason. The excellent Lifeline (1990) is a HARD SF tale that tells of the survival of four space habitats after a nuclear holo- 38 Science Fiction on the Page caust has taken place on Earth, effectively cutting them off from the planet. This was followed by a number of other successful collaborations with Beason, including Assemblers of Infinity (1993), in which an ALIEN virus, based on NANOTECHNOLOGY, begins infecting human colonists on the Moon, and Ignition (1996), a techno-thriller that deals with a terrorist threat against a space mission to Mir. There has also been a number of novels that feature the exploits of two FBI agents, beginning with Virtual Destruction (1996), but so far these have been rather predictable and a little too polished. Of Anderson's solo work, the most successful has been Resurrection Inc. (1988), a DYSTOPIC tale in which corpses are reanimated into a zombie- like underclass for the purposes of slavery. Other titles of note include Blindfold (1995) and Hopscotch (1997).

Born of Scandinavian parents in 1926, Anderson has had a long-term interest in Scandinavian lore and language, and this comes across in much of his writing, perhaps most evidently in Tau Zero (1970). It is a grand novel of HARD SF, in which the Swedes have been appointed governors of the Earth, keeping a watchful eye over a vast Romanesque empire. The story follows the progress of the starship Leonora Christine as it sails out into space in search of a new colony planet. However, problems arise with the interstellar drive, meaning that the ship is unable to decelerate, and the crew are flung to the far reaches of the universe. The novel brims with big scientific ideas, but at times the text does struggle under the weight of slightly wooden characters. Anderson's first novel, Brain Wave (1954) explores the consequences of humans and animals suddenly acquiring vastly improved intellects, and their difficulties in trying to comprehend such TRANSCEN- DENCE. It remains one of his most satisfying books. Much of Anderson's best work is set within a loosely structured FUTURE HISTORY known as the Technic History sequence. Briefly, this large series of novels and stories follows two independent threads, one detailing the exploits of spacefaring merchant prince Nicholas Van Rijn, the other following the adventures of Terran agent Dominic Flandry. The pick of the series as a whole includes Mirkheim (1977), 40 Science Fiction on the Page Ensign Flandry (1966) and A Knight of Ghosts and Shadows (1974). Nearly all, however, are worthy of note. To his credit, Anderson continues to produce startling and well- informed science fiction. Genesis (1999) speculates that machine intelli- gence will before long supersede the human variety, leading to the gradual extinction of humanity and human history. In the deep FAR FUTURE, an enormously intelligent construct seeks to view its experi- ments through a uniquely human perspective. This leads to the 'virtual emulation' of two human beings. The story is at once moving and imaginative. Anderson's shorter fiction has appeared frequently in magazines and anthologies. The best of it is collected in Alight in the Void (1991) and The Queen of Air and Darkness (197 '3).

ANTHONY, PATRICIA (1947- ), USA Texan author Patricia Anthony has, during the second half of the 1990s, made a significant impression on American LITERARY SF. Her work usually has its basis in stories of ALIEN intrusion or inter- ference, but often finds itself more concerned with the human condition, or with human reactions to extraordinary situations. It might even be fair to say that the alien presence in much of her fiction is almost incidental to the overall tone, that it is used as a device to develop her unique perspec- tive on human nature. This is perhaps seen best in God's Fires (1998), a remarkable novel that discusses the reaction of the Inquisition in sixteenth-century Portugal to a 'star' that falls from the sky and is found to contain three miraculous beings. Although the plot is driven by the incidents surrounding these strange visitors, the novel itself has more to do with the impression they make on the humans affected by their arrival. Other novels include Brother Termite (1993), which successfully paro- dies the political thriller, featuring aliens in the White House, and Cold Allies (1993), a tale of a mighty world war in which aliens are quietly, insidiously, lurking in the background. During the later years of the decade, Anthony produced the heart- 44 Science Fiction on the Page wrenching Great War novel Flanders (1998). It is perhaps her best work to date, but nearly all its SF elements are overshadowed by her constant analysis of the human condition and her intense focus on characterization. The novel has more in common with supernatural fantasy and allegory than with science fiction.

His depiction of ROBOTS paved the way for many later works, although it is generally accepted that the Czech author Karel Capek was responsible for adding the word 'robot' to the English language. Asimov first made his mark during the GOLDEN AGE of science fiction, and his best work has become synonymous with that period. It was in the pages of JOHN W. CAMPBELL's ASTOUNDING SCIENCE FICTION magazine that many of the episodes that make up Asimov's most famous trilogy of novels first appeared. The Foundation trilogy, comprising Foundation (1951), Foundation and Empire (1952) and Second Foundation (1953), is an intelligent story of the collapse of a vast interstellar empire and the subsequent preserva- Asimov, Isaac 45 tion and eventual rebirth of civilization through the work of a lone genius. Hari Seldon, Asimov's hero, has developed a predictive science based on psychology and entitled 'psychohistory'; with it he predicts the Roman Empire-style fall of the Galactic Empire and takes steps to lessen the impact by creating two 'Foundations', one based on the physical sciences, one on 'psychohistory'. These 'Foundations' work to preserve human knowledge and understanding, and during the course of the trilogy come under threat from various unknown elements such as the 'Mule', a mutant warlord. The Foundation saga is SPACE OPERA on a grand scale, thought- provoking and exciting, even if it does fall a little short in its literary craftsmanship. Asimov is perhaps equally well remembered for his excellent series of Robot stories, which span much of his career and, full-lengh novels excepted, are collected in The Complete Robot (1982). They are masterful explorations of ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - logical stories that examine the relationships that may evolve between humans and intelli- gent machines. In them, Asimov proposed the 'Three Laws of Robotics', a set of programmed instructions that would provide the robots with logical directives to which they must comply. They are: (1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. (2) A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. (3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. Most of Asimov's Robot stories revolve around various interpretations of these laws, and the consequences of conflicts between them. His two novels of this period, The Caves of Steel (1954) and The Naked Sun (1957) follow similar patterns, and feature a human private eye and his robot assistant. After a hiatus of many years, in which Asimov wrote nothing but non- fiction, he returned to science fiction with a number of novels that, surprisingly, tied together his Foundation and Robot series into one vast sequence. Perhaps a little long-winded, but at the same time of interest to fans of the original series, the newer novels (in internal chronological sequence) are The Robots of Damn (1983), Robots and Empire (1985), Forward the Foundation (1993), Prelude to Foundation (1988), Foundation 's Edge (1982) and Foundation and Earth (1986). Within this framework fit the earlier series mentioned above. 46 Science Fiction on the Page A later addition to the sequence is the Second Foundation Trilogy, which begins with Foundation's Fear (1997) by GREGORY BENFORD, and continues with Foundation and Chaos (1998) by GREG BEAR and Foundation's Triumph (1999) by DAVID BRIN.
