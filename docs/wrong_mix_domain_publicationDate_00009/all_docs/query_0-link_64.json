If we’re speaking of con- temporary poetry then my own personal an- swer is that I’m darned if I know. It may be that George is more knowledgeable on the characteristics of contemporary poetry than I am; and, if so, let him speak for himself if he wishes, but I myself am distressingly blank on the subject. I have seen contemporary poems that I have been told are good, and I am willing to accept that. I didn’t understand them or perceive their beauty, but I’ll accept expert opinions on the subject. After all, there are many mathematical theorems I don’t understand or perceive the rationality of; and yet I accept them as true, if I am told by experts that they are. However, I leave higher math to the mathematicians; and I leave contemporary poetry to the poets — rather thankfully, in both cases. If we look into the past, however, we find an unsophisticated period in which poetry was more understandable than it is today, just as mathematics was. There was a time when poetry was so simple as to be enjoyable, so that simple-minded people like myself yearned for it and applauded it. (In those days, poets sometimes became famous and wealthy, believe it or not.) It is that earlier elementary poetry which I will talk about here. To begin with, poetry is older than prose, if considered as a lit- erary product. This should be no surprise, for in any non-literate society, tales and legends had to be transmitted from memory. Any- thing that helps the memory is welcome, and some obvious helps are a strong rhythm and similarities of sound such as alliteration, assonance, or rhyme. The use of these artificial constraints militates against the ordi- nary rhythms and vocabulary of speech and often makes it neces- sary to employ unusual synonyms, word-forms, or syntax. This marks off poetry from prose and lends the former high-flown language and 6 Name ifKirm ;The Hugo and Nebula award-winning as heroic and venal, generous and pettyj author of Gateway takes you irito the subtle and stubborn as our own leaders future, to a time where the food bloc, the and followers. oil bloc and the people bloc warily Look fonward to the best SF view of the coexist with each other, futureyou’veeverread.itstartson page Until the discovery of Jem. one of Frederik Pohl’s JEM.

This isthe way the world ends. =REDERIK_POHL'S elevated tones which lead to other artificialities such as simile and metaphor, complicated allusions, and so on. Once a society grows literate, poetry is no longer needed as an aid to memory, but by that time it comes to have values of its own. It can do away with rh 3 mie and even with a too-metronomish rhythm, but retain the lofty expression and complexity of phraseology; and if this is well done it is greatly admired. Or else the artificiality of rhythm and rhyme can be accentuated in order to produce a comic effect, and this can be delightful. It is this latter quality that we occasionally feature in this mag- azine. The verses we publish are usually short, are recognized forms such as limericks or quatrains, are generally funny or sardonic, and are on themes that have something to do with science fiction. We like such things in reasonable moderation, and we think the readers do, too. But traditional poetry can be a word-game, too. Contemporary poetry cannot; and, for all I know, this may be one of its values. Robert Frost, who is a very highly regarded twentieth- century poet, said that writing free verse was like playing tennis without a net. I wouldn’t dream of arguing with him. Traditional poetry has the net, however, and foul lines and com- plicated rules that everyone understands. After all, you have to stick to particular rh 5 d;hms and to particular systems of rhyme, and still make sense and have the language flow easily. It’s a challenge! An idea in this connection occurred to me just the other day. I was attending a banquet in honor of Frederick Dannay, who, as \"Ellery Queen,” is the esteemed editor-in-chief of our cousin-peri- odical Ellery Queen’s Mystery Magazine. It was the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the publication of his first book; and one ardent fan produced an acrostic sonnet with the initial letters of the lines, read downward, spelling Frederick dannay. There was loud applause; and the gentleman on my left said to me that he had written and read many a sonnet, but had never before come across an acrostic sonnet. Well, I can almost never resist a literary challenge, and in five minutes (maybe ten) I wrote one for him. What I turned out was not great poetry by contempo- rary standards, or by any standards; it was not even good poetry. However, it was an acrostic sonnet, and here it is: Some think that he’s supreme above us all In science, and in deep inductive thought. Rich Earth, he says, is held to our Sun’s ball.

A Selection of the Science Fiction Book Club $2.25 DREAM SNAKE by Nebula Award-winning author voNDA N. McIntyre Into Earth’s thrall, the changing Moon is brought. Surrounded, our bright luminary reigns And lights and warms its nine great circling spheres As each against the strong attraction strains Centrifugally through the cosmic years. Nor can worlds ever dream of breaking loose; Else would it mean destruction of that law Which order in the cosmos does produce; That law that saves us all from chaos raw. O, that one man should put all matters right Nor, finding all things dark, deny the light. In order to play the game, let’s understand the rules. A sonnet is a poem of fourteen lines in iambic pentameter; that is, each line is of ten syllables with every second syllable stressed: dih-DAH-dih- DAH-dih-DAH-dih-DAH-dih-DAH. The rhyme scheme varies. For the Petrarchan sonnet it is: ab- baabba cdcdcd or abbaabba cdecde. For the Shakespearian sonnet it is abab cdcd efef gg. For the Spencerian sonnet it is abab bcbc cdcd ee. Given that, here is what I am asking you to do if you wish to accept the challenge. 1) Write a sonnet, fourteen lines of iambic pentameter, with any of the rhyme schemes listed above. The sonnet I myself wrote was a Shakespearian sonnet (in form, if not in quality) because the son- net read at the banquet had been one. 2) Make it an acrostic. In my sonnet, the initial letters, read downward, spell sir Isaac newton, but you can use any name that has fourteen letters. You can use nicknames, middle initials, or titles to get those fourteen letters. (I used \"Sir,” for instance.) How- ever, you must use a name that is both well-known and that is related to either science or science fiction. For instance, jack Wil- liamson, ROBERT HEiNLEiN, and ALBERT EINSTEIN each have fourteen letters. You might, alternatively, use well-known fictional charac- ters in science fiction or even well-known phrases or words unmis- takeably linked to our field. Come to think of it, science fiction itself has fourteen letters. 3) Have the sonnet make clear sense and deal with a subject that is closely connected to the word spelled out by the acrostic. My sonnet, for instance, is clearly concerned with Newton’s discovery of the law of gravitation. Of course, we’re not going to involve Shavma or George in this. 10 editorial fl51MOV5 5F PIDVEMTURE MFQftZinE 380 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10017 □ Enclosed is $1 .75 plus 45* handling/shipping (total of $2.20) for the Summer ’79 Issue (#3) of ASIMOV’S SF ADVENTURE Magazine.

John Crowley made a strong impression on many people, includ- ing myself, with his first novel. The Deep, and augmented it with the second. Beasts. Here certainly was a writing talent to watch. Part of that talent is imagery; Crowley draws his characters and settings in ways that stick in the mind — in Beasts, a pride of hu- manized lions prowling an endless plain dominated by a cloud-high building, in The Deep, a court masque of Baroque splendor. Another quality of Crowley’s, a subtler one, is a curious kind of gentleness. There were moments of violence in both the novels, but never for its own sake; Crowley avoids the melodrama of action used simply to liven up a narrative. This quality is a dominant one in his latest work. Engine Summer. It takes place in a post-holocaust world, and it’s a singularly peaceful one. The end of civilization itself seemed more of a whimper than a bang, and in the many years that have passed, the tiny population has settled down into more or less self-contained com- munities. Some of the lore of the \"angels” (pre-holocaust culture) has been preserved, some distorted, some lost entirely. In the small scale of the novel, we see only two of the communities: Little Be- laire, descended from a co-op of the past, and Dr. Boots’s List, a community settled in Service City, the remains of an enormous shopping center. 13 The story is a gentle one, also, mostly devoted to the growing up of Rush that Speaks, a boy of Little Belaire, his search for a saint- hood similar to those of the very immediate saints who helped found and preserve Little Belaire, and his search for Once a Day, a girl who had gone off with a trading party from Dr. Boots’s List. The delight of Engine Summer comes from the wonderfully in- tricate cultures Crowley has created. Their folklore and folkways, use and misuse of the artifacts of the angels, their very patterns of living are ingenious, ingenuous, often amusing, and always con- vincing. I must admit to a certain impatience toward the end of the novel; there is a literal deus ex machina in the form of a parachutist from an extant flying city of the angels, and a confusing climax involving just who Dr. Boots really was that gets a bit muddled between phys- ics and metaphysics. But the visits to Little Belaire and Service City were worth it. The \"first novel” is a traditional problem for book reviewers. One wants to be a little kinder than usual, so as to not frighten the fleeting manifestation of ability, and so far as I’m concerned, the mere act of finishing a novel shows the primary talent needed, which is dogged persistence. But some first novels are better than others, and Allen Wold’s The Planet Masters is not one of those. In it, an engaging rogue, Larson McCade, has come to Seltique, a planet cut off from the mainstream of Galactic culture for many hundreds of years. He is after an ancient artifact, a \"book” that he thinks will bring him untold wealth and power, and the story is of the intrigue and ad- venture of his search for this object. Unfortunately, he’s not very interesting; the quest is not very interesting; Seltique as a culture is pretty dull (it is constantly referred to as \"decadent,” but it’s the most antiseptic decadence I’ve ever run into; even the habit of le- galized mimder to acquire status is hardly decadent; rather, it re- sembles the genetic elimination of weaklings in Heinlein’s overdressed, trigger-happy culture oi Beyond This Horizon)', and the one attempt the author makes at an imaginative touch is an alien, intelligent, talking bird given to remarks like \"A little man told me. Maybe Mr. Wold should have done a bit more reading in past action-adventure SF with an icing of intrigue. James H. Schmitz is dandy at this sort of thing; an excellent example is his Legacy. First published in 1962 as A Tale of Two Clocks (as much as I disapprove 14 ONBOOKS 2 BIG FULLCOLOR POSTERS FOR ONLY $2.50 Limited Offer! FULLCOLOR Every science fiction fan will treasnre them! Name Address. Zip. of retitling books, as Ace is prone to do, the new title is the better one), it has been unavailable for a very long time. Legacy follows a typical Schmitz pattern in starting off decep- tively mildly in very small-scaled circumstances and galumphing along at breakneck pace until you’ve got a situation that affects all of the planets of the Galaxy. In this case, we meet Trigger Argee, who is involved in a project to study plasmoids, strange Old Galactic artificial entities whose use and functioning is unknown. Trigger, needless to say, is one of those Schmitz heroines: gorgeous and very able to take care of herself. Before you can say \"Old Galactic plasmoid,” skullduggery is afoot. It seems that every power group in the Galaxy wants the mysterious beasties, and in the multi-cornered struggle, there are kidnappings, counter-kidnappings, intrigue on a luxury interstellar liner, shoot- ’em-ups, shoot-’em-downs, and a madly circuitous, but thoroughly enjoyable route to the dual resolutions of what the plasmoids are and why all those people want them. Aficionados of epic fantasy, until recently, had to be content with a very few works in that area, but lately they seem to be coming from every direction. Most are all too influenced by Tolkien, and in a few cases, \"influenced” is an extremely kind euphemism. But one trilogy-to-be has stirred every fantasy lover I know (including me) to incoherent ecstasy, and that is the one by Patricia McKillip that began with The Riddle-Master of Hed. The trilogy-to-be is now, thank goodness, a trilogy-that-is (it’s been a long wait since that first volume); the third book is called Harpist in the Wind. (Number two is Heir of Sea and Fire.) The trilogy, like The Lord of the Rings, is a continuing narrative. That is the only overt resemblance between the two, except for ex- cellence and wonder. All of the characters of the Riddle-Master books (please God, don’t let them come to be called the Hed Trilogy) are human, though of a vast variety (shape-changers, ghosts, sor- cerer-kings). It is certainly the least epic of epic fantasies; maybe a new term should be invented, since the world of the Riddle-Master is quite small and we cover it from one end to the other across its handful of countries several times during the story. Despite this, the world and the narrative are very complex, and McKillip makes few explanatory condescensions. The style is also curiously modern, at times downright funny (not every fantasy has a pig stampede). In particular, Raederle, the heroine who dominates book two, has a sharp and witty tongue (\"Having a father flying ON BOOKS 16 around in the shape of a crow gives you a certain disregard for appearances.”) I won’t say more about the Riddle-Master books because their texture is all riddles, mysteries, and surprises. But they are very simply the best of their kind since The Lord of the Rings. Slowly but surely all the \"lost” works of science fiction are being reprinted, those books of ten, fifteen, twenty-five years ago or more that enough people have remembered to have created a certain leg- endary status for them. (Not to mention astronomical prices for a copy when it turns up.) One such is Wilmar Shiras’s Children of the Atom, which was originally a series of short stories in Astounding in the late 1940s and then was published as a whole in hardcover and paperback, both in very small printings. Nevertheless, it stuck in people’s minds, and it became one of those wanted books. Now it is back in print, and rereading it after all these years gave me mixed reactions. The story of the human mutation of superior ability struggling with human society in the contemporary or near-future world is a small but major subgenre of SF. One of the reasons for the paucity of this kind of story was that it meant dealing in terms of character and emotion almost entirely, which was not one of the strong points of SF until fairly recently. Another may well have been that one of the earliest works of this kind was of such towering quality that it was a very hard act to follow. It is impossible to talk about the \"mutant superman” story without bringing up Olaf Stapledon’s Odd John. Children of the Atom suffers by comparison, as do most of the others. In it, a child psychologist discovers a 13-year-old boy of stag- gering intelligence who is doing a brilliant job of hiding that intel- ligence, of seeming average in every way. The boy Tim is apparently the product of an accident at an experimental nuclear plant in which both his parents were involved, and from which they both eventu- ally died. Other children had been bom to those affected by the same accident, and the narrative is devoted to the finding of these (who all turn out to be superbright), their gathering together in a special school, their adjustments to each other, and the eventual decision as to what they will do with their lives. It’s all pretty . bland. The \"wonder children,” as Shiras has her psychologist dub them, are nice kids with only minor maladjust- ments, all neatly solved. In fact, everyone is very nice with the exception of a religious fanatic who manages to work up a xeno- 17 ON BOOKS phobic mob for an hour’s uneventful confrontation. Part of the problem here is that Children of the Atom has dated badly, in a way that SF usually doesn’t. It reflects all the attitudes of America of the ’40s: intelligence and academic skill is the impor- tant thing, run a close second by superficial adjustment to a super- ficial culture; the arts are rendered lip service, but are handled with painful naivete except for writing; sex and sexual mores are hardly mentioned. There is barely a hint of the esthetic, emotional, and intellectual complexity of Odd John and his brethren by which Sta- pledon so thoroughly convinces you that they are indeed another species, and a frightening one. In all fairness, it should be said that Shiras makes it clear that her children are superior only in intellect. And there might be the secret of the book’s continuing popularity. I would guess that a majority of science fiction readers have been over-intelligent, socially maladjusted youngsters; empathy with the children of the atom is inevitable. Speaking of the arts and science fiction, one of the few genre novels to take an art form as a spin-off point is back in print. Jack Vance’s Space Opera. The art is that of opera (surprise!), and it might be guessed that Vance decided to do a novelistic pun on the good old term \"space opera,” which for you newcomers refers to classic action-adventure interplanetary or interstellar SF. The novel Space Opera is a light and fairly mindless chronicle of the adventures of an opera company doing a tour of a number of planets in a far-future galaxy of innumerable sentient races, most of which have absolutely nothing in common with the others. There are all sorts of cultural complications and misunderstandings. The byzantaurs of Sirius system live in caves, from which expulsion is the ultimate disgrace; the presentation of Fidelio, which takes place in a prison and is all about freedom, not only confuses them, but rouses them to violence. The Striads of Zade think that The Magic Flute is a sort of commercial trade show, and place an order for two oboists and a coloratura. To the Mental Warriors of the same planet performances are tests of valor; The Bartered Bride is pretty tame stuff, and they subject the company to an exchange performance in which the audience is treated to flame throwers, falling boulders, and razor-edged pendulums. It’s a one-joke book, which luckily doesn’t go on long enough to wear thin. My major complaint is that Vance doesn’t take enough advantage of the intrinsic humor of opera itself, certainly one of the funniest of the fine arts. 18 ON BOOKS § § § About three years ago, science fiction publishing began to get into the pernicious coffee-table book, large, brightly colored objects which you want to own, but having paid the usually steep price, look at once and then leave about — ^where else? — on the coffee table. There are exceptions; Great Space Battles is one such. It is a straightfaced account of Terran expansion to the stars, the years-long Laguna Wars, and various less-major conflicts, and is billed as a Terran Trade Authority Handbook. Its authors, Stewart Cowley and Charles Herridge, are respectively the historical advisor to the Galactic Technology Museum at Miami Spaceport and the Mars War Mu- seum, and Secretary to the Terran Defense Authority War Group (phew). It’s all very nicely done indeed. Almost every other page is a handsome colored illustration (of a great space battle, of course), and there are now paperbacks that cost more than this hardcover volume, for heaven’s sake. It’s a real bargain, as was its predecessor, another Terran Trade Authority Handbook called Spacecraft 2000 to 2100 A.D. Technical point ... I wish somebody would invent a handy term for non-fictionEd science fiction — or science fictional non-fiction — such as the above TTA Handbooks. And a correction . . . two months ago in the rush to get my first column done, I misquoted the price on another good-looking book from the same publisher, Chartwell Books. The Trigan Empire is $6.95, which makes it yet another excellent buy. And in the area of art books plain and simple, one devoted to The Art of the Brothers Hildebrandt is now with us. Their work as cover artists and illustrators is vastly popular; there are several of my favorite covers here, such as the ones for The Best of C.L. Moore and Earth’s Last Citadel. I do find their depictions of people prob- lematical, having the quality of rather high-class waxworks. And finally, the first two volumes of a projected complete collec- tion of the fiction of Isaac Asimov in hard cover have been pub- lished. Volume 1, under the title of The Far Ends of Time and Earth, contains Pebble in the Sky, The End of Eternity, and Earth is Room Enough. Volume 2, Prisoners of the Stars, contains The Stars Like Dust, The Currents of Space, and The Martian Way. ON BOOKS 19 soppoRT Yoor Loom, SF.

Longyear art: Jack Gaughan ARNHEIM & BOON’S CIRCUS For Over 3 (Standard) Centuries The Longest Continuing Performing Circus in the Galaxy NOW ON PYROEL with The Greatest 116 Multi-Species Acts In The Universe and THE BIGGEST MID WAY ANYWHERE |f DO NOT BE CONFUSED! Arnheim L Boon’s Circus is the Iw J first and oldest Show of Shows, not to he confused with I I the poor imitation from Momus, Allenhy’s Greater Shows, f which has never seen an off-Momus performance Jl 24 PRIEST OF THE BARABOO \"Bah!” Bunsome crumpled up the rat sheet distributed hy the quick agents of the competing circus, dropped it on the dusty soil of the planet Pyroel and kicked it into the road where it was soon flattened by the heavy, canvas-laden sledges pulled by the lizards. The great reptiles of Momus, their lovely green scales hidden under layers of grey dust, puffed and strained against hand-made harnesses, while handlers and roustabouts pushed the sledges or pulled with the lizards. A handler pointed toward his lizard’s des- tination; and the lizard stopped and muttered an obscenity at the handler, who shouted more obscenities back at the huge beast. The scene reflected too well his own mood, and Bunsome turned his back, pulled up his robe which was stitched with the black- and-white diamonds of the priests, and sat crosslegged on a crate. A few squat Pyroelian nestlings, bored with watching the lizard and the human argue, waddled off to where other humans and lizards pushed and pulled the huge timbers that would support the big top. Bunsome shook his head, then let it drop into his palms, his elbows resting on his knees. As the junior Moman priest on the City Of Baraboo II, he had been assigned to collect information on the competing circus, and that he had done. While Allenby’s Greater Shows used lizard power and human muscle to move canvas, timbers, and heavy equipment, Arnheim & Boon was fully mechanized with quiet, powerful tractors and cranes to use against the heavy Pyroelian gravity. Instead of hec- tares of painfully hand-woven, hand-stitched canvas, Arnheim & Boon sported a huge, light, fabric dome inflated by compressed air that, because it was clear as glass, needed little additional light- ing at night and none in the daytime. While Allenby’s lizards and humans vented their frustrations on each other, Arnheim & Boon’s company had finished setting up and was prepeiring for its great free parade through Cukyu, P3Toers principal population center. There is more, thought Bunsome, always more. Even though the Baraboo had spun to provide increased gravity for the entire three week trip from Momus to allow the performers to adjust their acts, few of them seemed confident about working in this heavier gravity. The Arnheim & Boon unit on Pyroel, only one of twenty-four such companies, did nothing but play the high-gee planets and even had a number of Pyroelians in its acts. The Momans had picked Pyroel because it was the closest planet to Momus that could be booked, and Allenby’s Greater Shows couldn’t afford to fuel the Baraboo any further. Who could have PRIEST OF THE BARABOO 25 known that Arnheim & Boon would be there? \"Hey you!” Bunsome turned toward the voice and saw a figure standing in the hatch of the Baraboo’s decrepit cargo van. \"You waiting to go back to the ship?” Bunsome nodded. \"Yes.” The figure waved. \"Let’s go, then. We’re empty as Allenby’s purse.” The priest climbed down from the crate and shuffled through the dust, recalling the five brightly painted shuttles that put Arn- heim & Boon’s Circus on the surface. With no shuttles in work- ing condition, the Baraboo itself had put down outside of Cukyu, using up the remainder of its fuel in the landing. The artwork on the ship had burned off in the atmosphere, leaving the Baraboo black and mottled. As he stepped up and entered the hatch of the van, Bunsome bumped into a Montagne wearing roustabout’s black-and-tan robes. \"Why don’t you watch where you’re going?” Bunsome reached into his purse and dropped five copper beads into the roustabout’s hand. \"My apologies.” The roustabout pocketed the coppers and pointed with his thumb at the seats along the side bulkhead, then returned to his task of securing the van’s cargo, straps. When he finished, he moved to the front and joined the Arvanian driver. Bunsome strapped himself into the unpadded seat and wished he was back on Momus. If the original City Of Baraboo hadn’t stranded its company on Momus two centuries ago, thought Bun- some, bless my coppers if we wouldn’t show Arnheim & Boon a show. But the necessities of survival on an uninhabited planet and two centuries without an audience had taken a toll. The van lurched, banging Bunsome’s head against the bulkhead. As the cargo compartment filled with fine, choking dust, the priest glared at the earless Arvanian driver, prepared to demand coppers for the poor ride. Bunsome saw the Montagne staring in- differently through a side port, seemingly unbothered by the dust, noise, and bouncing. The priest shrugged and turned his growing hostility on his own occupation. \"Priests,” he muttered. \"What good are we, except to collect our facts and write our little histories?” Bunsome recalled the Dovi- nite missionary he had met on PjToel. \"Now, that was a priest!” He remembered the clean lines of the altar and the gleaming gold and purple of the windows. But, most of all, the Dovinites had 26 PRIEST OF THE BARABOO gods to worship, gods that would do things for them if they asked properly. But the gods would not hire out to a circus; Bunsome had asked the missionary. It seemed that the Dovinites had an exclusive contract, and the contract was not up for sale. Whether it was a case of too little or too much business sense on the part of the Dovinites, Bunsome wasn’t sure. He dozed, wishing he had followed his original hunch years before to apprentice as a mason or carpenter. Priesting was an easy life; and he liked the books; but there was no money in it, nothing else of importance either. The priest came fully awake as the van lurched to a halt. He turned and looked through the dust-covered side port behind his head. The ugly, patched hulk of the Baraboo, its vanes and fins sagging against the gravity, looked back. Bunsome snorted. Threads of his dream, of the Dovinite minister’s service, still ran through his mind — the congregation uplifted by the Dovinite’s story and by the promises the Dovinite had made. Bunsome sighed, turned from the port, and released his straps. As he stepped down from the hatch and walked around the van, Bunsome saw the next load of lizard-drawn equipment waiting to pile on the vehicle. Against the open door of the Baraboo's cargo bay stood Nusset, the apprentice to the ship’s senior priest, Shelem. Nusset picked his teeth with a fingernail and watched Bunsome approach through half-closed eyes. The apprentice priest wagged a finger at Bunsome. \"You’d best get cleaned up. Shelem wants to see you.” Bunsome reached into his purse. \"What about, Nusset?” The apprentice shrugged and turned into the ship’s bay door, leaving Bunsome with his coppers. Nusset looked over his shoulder. \"Will you recite your notes for me to copy right away?” \"No. I shall have to see what Shelem wants of me first.” \"I’ll be at level six, then, watching the flyers practice, if they’ll let me.” Bunsome nodded. \"I’ll be in the scriptorium.” Nusset laughed. \"Where else?” The apprentice turned off the main corridor, leaving Bunsome to himself Bunsome walked quickly, his nose wrinkling at the lizard stench. If we do manage to get some customers into the big top, de- spite Arnheim & Boon, the smell will probably drive them out again! He shrugged, remembering it was mostly the closeness of the ship. On Pyroel’s surface, the lizards would be able to wash PRIEST OF THE BARABOO 27 themselves. A chip of consolation, Bunsome snorted to himself, floating in a sea of disaster. As his path took him deeper into the bowels of the Baraboo, others passed him in the corridor or stood in small groups — clowns, freaks, magicians, roustabouts — either arguing or talking sadly in low voices. Even the usually emotionless Arvanians in the company were shouting and fist-shaking. Bunsome shook his head, sighed, and turned right into a narrow corridor. As he approached the door of the scriptorium, at the end of the dimly lit, deserted corridor, Bunsome hesitated as he recognized Allenby, decked out in gold cape and black slouch hat, pacing in front of the door. Allenby looked up at the sound of Bunsome’s footsteps. \"Ah! I hoped you would be back soon.” Bunsome halted in front of Allenby and nodded. \"What may I do for the Great Allenby?” He held out his hand and Allenby dropped several copper movills into it. \"Amheim & Boon: are they ready for their parade?” \"Yes.” Bunsome couldn’t meet Allenby’s eyes. \"They will march before the sun sets.” \"What do they have for great beasts, Bunsome?” The priest pulled at his lip, then dropped his hand. \"Nine acts. Great Allenby, from as many planets — ” \"Do they have elephants?” Bunsome nodded. \"Twenty. They’re magnificent animals. Be- fore, I had only seen pictures — ” \"Yes, yes.” Allenby waved his hand for silence, his pale blue eyes staring into an ocean of poor options for the unknown thing that would save the Baraboo’ s bacon. \"Great Allenby, at least we have the lizards. Arnheim & Boon has nothing like our lizards,” Bunsome tried to encourage. \"Humph!” Allenby shook his head. \"Stoop, the head lizard, only this morning demanded more pay for the reptiles.” Allenby waved his hand, then dropped it. \"Because of the gravity. I thought we could beat the gravity; I must be seven kinds of a fool! At least you don’t have to pay elephants.” Allenby looked into Bunsome’s eyes. \"What of their clowns, magicians?” \"I saw none of their acts, but surely ours are the best. Great Allenby.” Allenby shook his head. \"Perhaps. I would feel better had we not left our best on Momus.” \"They are too old. Great Allenby; too old to make the trip.” 28 PRIEST OF THE BARABOO \"Shelem made the voyage.” Bunsome shrugged and held out his hands. \"A priest doesn’t have to perform; and besides, Shelem hasn’t been feeling well.” Allenby frowned. \"Is it anything serious?” Bunsome dropped his hands to his sides. \"I’m no physician, but it’s probably nothing more than age.” \"Age.” Allenby repeated, then looked at the corridor deck. \"I understand age to be a terminal affliction.” Bunsome shrugged and nodded. \"I wish him well, Bunsome. I may need his services before long.” Allenby nodded, then walked around Bunsome, heading with deliberate steps toward the main corridor. Bunsome turned to the scriptorium door and opened it, exposing the manuscript-piled interior. The built-in metal desk, Shelem’s cus- tomary working place, was unoccupied. Bunsome entered and closed the door, grateful that the smells of ink, leather, and aged paper drowned the unwashed-lizard smell that seeped throughout the ship. The compartment was empty; and Bunsome poked around, waiting for Shelem. At the large copy table in the center of the room, he noticed that Nusset had fallen behind copying Shelem’s latest manuscript, which would never do. Many priests back on Momus would want copies — Bunsome laughed to himself. If we ever get back to Momus. The last of our fuel was used to put the company planet- side without enough to spare to relocate elsewhere on Pyroel, away from Arnheim & Boon. Allenby’s had been at it two days, setting up, with the raising of the big top still to be done. Seeing the weak competition, Arnheim & Boon put down their show in the same city eight hours before, and they were ready to parade. Bunsome turned his eyes toward the volume-crammed shelves and ran his fingers along the glossy leather bindings until he came to One: The Book Of Baraboo. Half the book was filled with tales and reminiscences of ancient Earth, before the circus began to cross the void, but the second half told of the voyages of the City Of Baraboo and O’Hara’s Greatest Shows, the finest collec- tion of artists and games in the entire Ninth Quadrant. The old company, thought Bunsome, now, that would have been something to see. The old Baraboo would begin its parade four hours after achieving orbit, with combination-function ship’s compartments detaching to act as their own shuttles. Bunsome shook his head, thinking of the salvaged Arvanian battle cruiser that served as the Baraboo II. Only two of its origi- nal twenty combat landing-shuttles remained, and both of those PRIEST OF THE BARABOO 29 were broken down on Pyroel with no hope of repair without money for parts. He let his fingers slide down the binding, then drop to his side. \"scriptorium.” \"Aaaahhh!” Bunsome clamped a hand over his racing heart, and quickly looked around the compartment, relaxing only when he saw the intercom set in the bulkhead above Shelem’s desk. 7 never will get used to that. \"scriptorium, this is the sick bay.” Bunsome went to the desk and touched the call button. \"Yes?” \"bunsome?” \"Yes.” \"this is doctor vor. can you come down to the sick bay?” Bunsome disliked the Arvanian physician. He disliked all Ar- vanians as a rule, but disliked Vor in particular. \"What’s the problem, Vor? I’m very busy.” \"SHELEM is dead. I HAVE ALREADY NOTIFIED ALLENBY. SHELEM LEFT A MESSAGE FOR YOU.” Bunsome lowered himself to Shelem’s chair. \"I’ll be down . . . I’ll be down as soon as I can.” \"please accept MY CONDOLENCES.” Bunsome was nodding as the intercom clicked off. Returning from the sick bay, Bunsome stopped at the wardroom as he had been instructed by the barker sent by Allenby. As he entered, Bunsome saw Allenby seated behind a large bowl of sap- wine, rubbing his eyes. Allenby looked up and dropped some cop- pers on the table. \"Here, Bunsome. We haven’t much time.” Al- lenby pointed to a couch to his left at the table. Bunsome pock- eted the coppers and sat. \"Are you well, Bunsome? You look terri- ble.” Bunsome nodded. \"It’s only this on top of everything else. . . .” He weakly waved a hand, then dropped it in his lap. Allenby sighed, and both sat for a moment in silence. \"Bun- some, I need your help.” \"Of course; whatever I can do. Great Allenby.” Allenby nodded, his jaw set, his eyes unblinking. \"I don’t sup- pose it’s any secret that the show is in trouble.” \"Someone in the universe might not know, although I doubt it. Great Allenby.” Allenby drank from his bowl, then placed it on the table. He pointed at the bowl. \"Care for some?” 30 PRIEST OF THE BARABOO \"Please.” Allenby reached behind his couch to a shelf and picked up a bowl and a fresh jug of sapwine. As he poured, he continued. \"The only secret left, Bunsome, is just how much trouble we’re really in.” He plugged the jug and pushed Bunsome the bowl. The priest dropped some coppers on the table and picked up the bowl. \"Be- fore we left Momus, even before we formed the company, the for- tune tellers saw this coming. If something cannot be done, I doubt that we will even be able to open; or, if we do open, it will be a complete farce.” \"What is it?” Allenby leaned forward and rubbed beneath his nose with the thumb-side of his hand. \"The performers; they are afraid to go on — Bunsome let out an involuntary burst of laughter. \"My apologies. Great Allenhy,” he tossed two movills on the table. \"Please excuse me, but nothing could be harder for me to imagine. They are all master performers, with many years in ring and midway behind them. Afraid?” \"It’s true, all the same. How many practices have you seen?” Bunsome sipped from his bowl, then shrugged. \"Quite a few soon after we left Momus, but none for more than a week. Even the clowns stopped letting spectators watch, even if they paid.” \"You see? Does your imagination stretch to the point of that? Clowns refusing to perform for coppers?” Bunsome nodded. \"I see what you mean. It happened so gradu- ally, I never suspected . . . but why? They are no less the perfor- mers they were on Momus.” Allenby rubbed his chin, then leaned back on his couch, bowl in hand. \"This ship, P5u-oel; both are strange grounds. The Pyroe- lians are a strange audience, and now, with Arnheim & Boon as competition . . . Doctor Vor treated Rulyum the juggler today for a broken toe. Rulyum dropped his clubs during a practice.” \"Rulyum!?” Bunsome’s mouth hung open. \"Not Rulyum!” \"Are you beginning to understand now?” \"Yes.” Bunsome shook his head. \"Yes and no. Why are we plagued in this manner? Can’t something go right for us?” \"We knew we were taking a big chance putting the show on the road so soon, but we had to go when we could get the coppers. If we had waited any longer, the backers would have begun with- drawing their funds.” Allenby shrugged. \"It was go when we did, or not go at all.” PRIEST OF THE BARABOO 31 Bunsome recalled his feelings after observing the Amheim & Boon preparations. \"That may have been the better choice — not going at all.” \"It is academic; we are here, and here we stay unless we can put on enough of a show to meet our expenses.” Allenby put his elbows on the table and clasped his hands. \"I am convinced that this company can draw a paying crowd; what we lack in numbers and glitter we more than make up in skill and polish. I have our parade scheduled for the sixth post-meridian hour this day — a full hour before Arnheim & Boon takes to the road.” \"The big top isn’t even up.” \"Nevertheless. Right now every spare pair of hands and every reptile, including Stoop, is out there getting ready. I think the equipment will be ready on time, but this will do us little good unless the company hits the streets of Cukyu, not as a shambling, dispirited mob, but as a circus.” \"Great Allenby, you asked me if I would help.” Bunsome raised his eyebrows and shrugged. \"But what can I do? I am only a priest — a mere historian.” \"Shelem worked with the fortune tellers before we left Momus. He had an answer.” \"What was it?” Allenby shook his head. \"I was hoping he had told you.” \"No.” \"He discussed nothing about it with you?” Bunsome shrugged. \"He discussed nothing about anything with me starting from when we left Momus. He spent all his time buried in his manuscripts, writing . . .” The priest reached into his robe and withdrew the slip of paper Doctor Vor had given him. \"What’s that?” \"Vor copied it. He said it was Shelem’s message to me.” Bun- some unfolded the paper, then let loose a disappointed sigh. \"It’s nothing.” \"What does it say?” \" 'Forty-seven: thirty-four. Read this.’ ” \"That’s all? What do the numbers mean?” \"You must understand. Great Allenby, Shelem was very old, and his mind . . . well, this is a perfect example. It’s obviously a book and chapter index number, but Shelem’s histories for the Tarzak priests begin with book forty-one and end with forty-six. There is no book forty-seven.” \"Bunsome, perhaps that was what he was writing.” 32 PRIEST OF THE BARABOO \"No doubt, but no priest could perform in recital material that has not been approved by the rest of the Tarzak priesthood. Perhaps they do things that way in Ikona, but . . \"What period does that chapter cover?” \"I don’t know. Young Nusset — Shelem’s apprentice — would know. He’s been copying the manuscript.” Allenby pressed a panel in the table top and called the scrip>- torium. Nusset answered. \"This is Allenby, Nusset.” \"yes, great allenby?” \"In Shelem’s new book, what period is covered by chapter thirty-four?” \" . . . ER, I’M not sure, one MOMENT.” Allenby raised his eyebrows at Bunsome who only shrugged. \"Apprentices aren’t what they used to be.” \"great allenby?” \"Yes, Nusset?” \"l HAVE IT. NOW, THIRTY FOUR . . . HMMM. THAT CHAPTER COV- ERS THE WAR. IT SEEMS TO BE COMPLETE.” \"Nusset, bring it to the wardroom.” Allenby looked up to see Bunsome frowning. \"What is it?” The priest shook his head. \"Shelem would have me read that to the ship’s company? The blackest period in the history of Momus? If the company’s frame of mind is as uncertain as you describe it. Great Allenby, that chapter should easily put them over the edge.” \"Perhaps.” \"Perhaps? I do know something of priesting.” Allenby nodded. \"I meant no offense, Bunsome, but Shelem’s office as senior priest of the Baraboo leads me to believe that he, too, knew something of his trade.” Bunsome blushed. \"Of course. But where is the inspiration for this company in death, defeat, and despair? Wouldn’t a few passages from the older works — perhaps the voyages of the origi- nal Baraboo — wouldn’t something such as that be better?” \"Perhaps.” They waited a few moments in silence, then turned toward the wardroom door as Nusset entered holding a sheaf of papers. Allenby took them and handed the apprentice several coppers. Before Nusset had left the room, Allenby was reading the papers, motionless save for his darting blue eyes. As he reached the end of a page, he would place it in back of the remaining sheets. Bunsome thought again of the Dovinite missionary as he watched Allenby giggle, then frown, then sniff back a tear as he PRIEST OF THE BARABOO 33 nodded, turning to the next page. I’m not too old, thought Bun- some. 1 could apprentice again as a mason. There are many similarities between priesting and newstelling — storytelling, too. If I ever get back to Momus. He sighed and looked up to see Allenby, a strange look on his face, holding out the papers. After Bunsome took the chapter, Allenby stood and walked to the door, then stopped. . \"Bunsome, you will address the company with that chapter at the fourth hour. Be ready.” He turned and left. The priest sat staring at the empty door for a few moments, then looked at the papers in his hand. Shelem’s familiar scrawl covered the imlined sheets. Shaking his head, Bunsome began reading.” At the fourth hour, Bunsome stood on a packing crate in the Baraboo’s cargo hold with the assembled ship’s company sur- rounding him. Humans, Arvanians, and lizards — all in parade costume — stood silently, waiting for the priest to begin. Bunsome cleared his throat and began: It was the two hundred and fourth year of the Baraboo disas- ter, and the fifth year of Lord AJlenby’s office as Great Statesman of Momus. The protection of the Ninth Quadrant Federation of Habitable Planets, which Allenby once represented as ambas- sador, had been withdrawn under orders of the Ninth Quadrant’s Council of Seven to strengthen the defenses near the center of population which had come under the scrutiny of the Tenth Quadrant’s warlords. All that remained were a scattering of Mon- tagne soldiers who had taken retirements or discharges on Momus, and the assurances of the United Quadrants that it would come to Momus’s defense in the event the planet su^ered an in- vasion. As Bunsome read Shelem’s words, the months of struggle, pain, and suffering melted until both priest and performers were car- ried back to that dark hour. At the same time the last Ninth Quadrant ship abandoned the skies of Momus, Lord Allenby invited the great masters of the planet to meet. They gathered in AJJenby’s quarters in the town of Tarzak and met with representatives of the Montagne soldiers who had been left behind. . . . Lord Allenby, seated crosslegged behind his table, let his eyes drift over the gloomy faces in his quarters. “Any suggestions?” He 34 PRIEST OF THE BARABOO stopped on the face of a young man dressed in roustabout’s black-and- tan. “Painter? You’re the senior Montagne left on the planet.” Standing behind those seated around Allenby’s table, his back against the wall, the former infantry lieutenant shrugged. “If the intelligence projections General Kahn supplied you are accurate, the Tenth Quadrant will pile in mercenaries — Arvans probably — under some pretext that will give the United Quadrants a loophole through which the UQ can refuse intervention. When is the question, but we can count on it being soon.” Allenby rubbed his chin. “The size of the Arvanian force?” “No more than a battalion; the UQ would have to notice any- thing larger. But,” Painter dropped his glance, “it should be enough to do the job. They’ll be carrying sustained burst beamers for light weapons and probably pulse beamers and disrupters for their heavy weapons company. In addition, the Arvans are tough.” “What about our Montagues? Aren’t there around two hundred on Momus?” Painter nodded. “About half of them are technical personnel — mechanics, medics, electrical and computer types — no more combat qualified than clowns. . . .” Painter noticed Great Kamera, Master of the Tarzak clowns, raising an eyebrow in his direction. “No offense. Great Kamera.” The lieutenant turned back to Allenby. “Subtract them and the ones who are unfit because of age; and we have, perhaps, a dozen combat soldiers equipped with nothing but their bare hands.” “And?” “And, if this were a problem back at officer’s school. I’d pick the better part of valor and I wouldn’t be marked wrong.” “Impossible.” “I knoW.” “What’s the alternative, then. Painter?” “Guerrilla warfare. Avoid direct confrontations, hit-and-run, wear them down . . . make life on Momus a hell for the Ar- vans. . . .” Painter looked down and shook his head. “What is it? What were you about to say?” Painter pursed his lips, then looked up. “To make it a hell for the Arvans, we will necessarily make it a hell for ourselves as well. A war such as that is a contest of spirits — guts. To increase the price of conquest to the Arvans, the people of Momus will have to pay a price. It might take years. They may wear us out first — ” “Hah!” Everyone in the room turned toward Dorum, PRIEST OF THE BARABOO 35 strongman and Master of the Tarzak freaks. “Painter. You suggest that Momans lack spirit?” Others in the room nodded their ap- proval. Painter rubbed his eyes, then dropped his hand. “I have seen such a war before, Dorum. It was used against the Montagues six years ago on Hessif as part of the rebellion. I saw my company commander blown to pieces by a small child wired as a walking bomb. . . . She asked him for water.” He stood away from the wall. “Do you have the spirit to wire yourself as a bomb, Dorum? Or to wire your daughter or wife? That’s what the Hessifs had for spirit, Dorum; and it wasn’t enough. We cracked them. The Montagues broke the rebellion.” Allenby looked at the lines deepening on the faces in the death-silent room. “Are there any other suggestions?” No one moved. “Very well. Painter, where do we begin?” Oblivious to his battle cruiser. Sword, hurtling toward the planet Momus, the commander of the Arvanian mercenaries, Naavon Dor, sat in his couch playing his stylus against the screen that covered one of the bulkheads to his quarters. With rapid, sure strokes, images of Arvan’s bleak mountains and harsh winds bend- ing the filmy vegetation appeared on the screen. Naavon’s screen could have shown his drawing in motion — the grey clouds slip- ping beyond the mountains, the dia trees whipping back and forth — but he preferred to draw in still and achieve the same ef- fect. In the foreground appeared the edge of a cliff, and upon the cliff appeared a whirl of lines and shades that soon became a like- ness of himself — tall, smooth head held erect, night-black eyes staring from under prominent brows at the distant mountains. Naavon hesitated a moment and studied the likeness. The figure wore the old-style high collar and crossed belts of the land mer- cenaries. Naavon frowned, then recognized the figure. My father; why am I thinking of you now? “Naavon?’^ The field officer turned from the screen to the compartment hatch to see his second-in-command leaning half through the opening. Naavon deenergized the screen, erasing the image, and tossed the stylus on the couch’s armrest table. “What is it, Goss?” “Fingers shuttled over from his command ship and wants to see you.” “By that racial slur, Goss, I assume you mean Admiral Sadiss.” 36 PRIEST OF THE BARABOO “The same.” “It may interest you to know, Goss, that Sadiss — as a Vorilian — can no more help having fourteen fingers than we Ar- vanians can help having ten.” “Yes, Naavon.” Goss, old soldier and the field officer’s faith- ful friend, cast his eyes down in mock shame, the hint of mischief at the corners of his mouth. “I bet he can tickle up a storm, though.” Naavon shook his head. “What does our patron’s agent want?” Goss grinned. “He wishes to bring charges against one of the men.” The field officer raised his eyebrows, then nodded. “Very well, Goss. Please show the admiral in.” Goss turned from the compartment and shouted over his shoulder. “You! In here!” Goss stepped into the compartment, took a seat facing Naavon and awaited the appearance of the Vori- lian admiral. Sadiss entered, and the Arvanian commander saw the squat humanoid, clad in black cape and suit, looking around the com- partment for a place to sit. Naavon pointed to a stool. “It’s the best I can offer. Admiral.” Sadiss glared at Goss’s seated figure, then tm^ned to Naavon. “I shall remain standing.” “As you wish.” Goss lifted one booted foot, dropped its heel on the stool, then crossed it with his other boot. Naavon wondered if he should point out to the Vorilian that Goss acted the same with Arvanian officers. He shook his head and turned back to Sadiss. “And, your business. Admiral?” “A soldier in your third company: T’Dulna. I am bringing formal charges of treason again him.” Naavon nodded. “I see. What did he do?” “Defeatism. He spoke disparagingly of our glorious mission.” “Hmmm. That is serious. What did he say?” “He called our mission of liberation an invasion, and he im- plied that it was an act of cowardice to bring modern armed force against what he called ‘an innocent society of clowns and jugglers’.” Naavon nodded. “And you heard T’Dulna say this?” Sadiss turned to the open door and waved his arm. “Emis, Yust; in here!” Two Arvanian soldiers entered the compartment and stood at attention next to the admiral. “These two heard him PRIEST OF THE BARABOO 37 and reported his treason to me.” Naavon leaned back in his couch and clasped his fingers over his belly. “I see.” The field officer studied Soldier Emis, then Sol- dier Yust. Nodding, he turned to Goss. “Have these two mustered out of the unit and get them off my ship. If the admiral won’t take them on his ship, throw them outside and let them walk.” Goss stood and rubbed his hands together. “Yes Naavon; my pleasure.” Goss walked between the soldiers, grabbing each by the arm, and dragged them backwards out of the compartment. The one called Emis looked pleadingly at Sadiss before he left the room. Sadiss fixed his eyes on Naavon. “What is the meaning of this. Field Officer?” “The invasion of Momus is an act of cowardice, Sadiss, and speaking truth is not treason on my ship.” “It exhibits a lack of loyalty to the Tenth Quadrant!” “True.” Naavon nodded. “Very true. But neither is that a crime on my ship. The men of this battalion owe their loyalty to me and to each other. No other loyalty is required, which is why you can have your two spies back. I won’t have them causing mis- trust in the ranks.” “What am I supposed to do with them?” “Add them to that collection of criminals you call the Moman Liberation Army.” “Criminals? Field Officer Dor, they are representatives of the oppressed peoples of Momus who have requested the aid of the Tenth Quadrant to overthrow — ” “Be still, Sadiss! Feed your fiction to the United Quadrants, and not to me. Your liberation army is nothing more than mur- derers, thieves, and cheats exiled from Moman society, and your excuse to land troops on Momus without interference from the UQ. That is right, isn’t it?” Goss entered the compartment and resumed his seat. “Naavon, I stuffed them into Sadiss’s shuttle.” The field officer nodded, then turned back to the Admiral. “I imagine that concludes our business, Sadiss.” “Not quite. Dor. Your soldiers are sworn to — ” “My soldiers are sworn to follow my orders. Your superiors hired me to secure Momus for the Tenth Quadrant, cash on deliv- ery, which we will do — ” Naavon grinned. “ — unless we get a bet- ter offer. Meanwhile, we don’t have to like what we are doing; be content that we are doing it. That will be all.” 38 PRIEST OF THE BARABOO Sadiss turned his glare from Naavon to Goss, then back to Naavon. “This isn’t the end, Dor. I am the appointed commander of this mission — ’’ “That will be all, Sadiss. Now, do you wish to have Goss es- cort you to your shuttle?” Sadiss turned abruptly and marched from the compartment. Goss shook his head. “Naavon, he will make trouble for us. The warlords of the Tenth may listen to his prattle.” Naavon laughed. “Goss, old friend, you really don’t see, do you?” “See what?” “Admiral Sadiss is an incurable romantic. I’m sure he thinks of himself as a liberator and our mission as one of liberation. The Tenth’s warlords, however, are not at all the dreamy fellows Sadiss would like them to be.” Goss scratched his nose. “If I didn’t see before, Naavon, I see even less now.” Naavon reached, picked up his stylus and energized his draw- ing screen. As he talked, he stroked in a grotesque representation of Sadiss. “Goss, you must understand the philosophy behind the Tenth Quadrant; it’s interesting, if you don’t get in its way. They feel that the Vorilians are destined to rule the universe.” Goss shrugged. “Sadiss feels no differently.” “Ah, but there is a difference, Goss. The present warlords, and all the warlords before them, are serving an idea. Sadiss is serving himself. The warlords see the Vorilians as the eventual rulers of all that exists. Sadiss sees himself as the ruler. The warlords are content to push until resistance is met, then back off and wait, let- ting the next generation of warlords make the actual kill. It is a ruthlessly slow, plodding plan of conquest; not enough to upset the races that surround them, but enough to eventually succeed. Take our own little mission, for example. Here we are, an insigni- ficant military force being sent to secure an insignificant planet for the Tenth — ^in scale with the universe, scraps of dust; too little to be concerned about. ‘It is nothing to us,’ say the Quadrants, ‘let the Tenth have it.’ And the Tenth will take it, my friend, and add it to all the other scraps of dust it’s gathered, because enough of these scraps of dust — ” “Make up the universe.” Goss frowned, then raised his brows. “Sadiss?” Naavon shrugged. “It is a plan that must take a thousand gen- erations to work; Sadiss doesn’t have the time. He serves his ego, PRIEST OF THE BARABOO 39 while the warlords serve a destiny.” Goss pulled a small wooden flute from his blouse, put it to his lips and ran a few scales. “Where should we be in this, Naavon? If what you say is true, the warlords will level their sights on Arvan someday.” Naavon leaned back and pressed the animation program for the screen. “We will be long gone by then.” The field officer shrugged as the image of Sadiss jerked and stumbled on the screen. “Even though Arvan will be absorbed, think of the grand- ness of the plan, Goss. The ghosts of an army of warlords will be able to look back at what they have done.” Goss tweeted out a short comic phrase in time to the screen figure’s stumble, then took the flute down and slapped it against his hand. “I wouldn’t want to live under the Tenth.” “That’s not the point, Goss.” Naavon held out his hands. “You and I, Goss; what have we that will remain centuries from now? As soldiers, perhaps we have set certain events in motion, but they can be easily countered by other events. I draw my pic- tures and erase them, and you play your excellent little tunes that disappear into the air. But the warlords of the Tenth are changing the universe, whatever that change might be.” Goss put his flute to his lips, then lowered it a bit. “You ap- prove?” Naavon shrugged. “Compared to the event, what does the ap- proval of a mere soldier amount to?” “Nothing, I suppose. And that applies to Sadiss as well, which is why he can’t make trouble for us?” “Exactly. The warlords hired us to do a job; as long as we do that job, they will be satisfied.” Goss played another short phrase, then frowned. “Naavon, what if Sadiss could accomplish, in his lifetime, the plan of the warlords?” Naavon turned from Goss and studied the screen. “If I thought he could accomplish the plan — or defeat it — I would serve him, I think, to be a part of it. I would like to be responsible for some kind of permanence, even if it’s negative, but . . .” The field officer shrugged. “But, Naavon, you’ll settle for two meals a day and the com- pany of eight hundred sorry soldiers.” Naavon laughed. “The ones who live long enough.” He picked up his stylus, stopped the animation and flicked in more lines, aging the figure of Sadiss by eighty years. As Naavon ani- 40 PRIEST OF THE BARABOO mated the figure, Goss trilled off into a halting, ragged melody, “The Last Of Us To Die.” Squatting at the edge of the forest north of Arcadia, Oswald Painter, former Montagne lieutenant, scanned the desert and sky and found them clear. They will not always be so. AlJenby has high hopes for his magicians and fortune tellers, he thought, that they will fuddle the Arvans and foresee their plans. Painter snorted and stood. They will need more than that. He turned into the forest and pushed his way through the thick underbrush until he came to a small clearing. There he stopped and eyed his rag-tag collection of roustabouts, freaks, clowns, tumblers . . . and, at least, one knife-thrower. Perhaps he will be of some use. Painter held up his hands. “All right, people, listen up.” He motioned them into the center of the clearing. As they shambled in and formed a half-circle around him. Painter looked at their faces, seeing boredom on one, excitement on another and mischief on still another. Children playing soldier. Whatever it takes to make a guerrilla fighter, these people don’t have. “We have a lot of work to do and not much time — ” “Painter.” A ragged fellow in black-and-scarlet held up his hand and Painter nodded, “Painter, I am Roos of the Anoki magi- cians.” “Yes?” “There is still the matter of payment to be settled.” “Payment?” Great Juju, what am 1 doing here? “Of course. Our being here is of value to you, is it not?” That is the question, isn’t it? Painter shook his head. “This is different.” “Different? Different how?” “We’re here to learn how to defend your homes — ^your planet!” Roos half-closed his eyes and held up his head. “Is our being here of value to you?” “Of course!” Roos shrugged. “Then it is of value to us.” Shaking his head. Painter reached under his robe to find an empty purse. “It seems that I am a little short.” A woman in white short robe held up her hand. “I am Fayda of the Sina cashiers. If I might advance the instructor a small loan?” Painter looked at his charges, then smacked his right fist into PRIEST OF THE BARABOO 41 his left hand. “You silly people are staring a blood bath square in the face, and you’re standing here trying to turn coppers on it!” They are insane; absolutely yang-yangl Painter let out his breath. “All right! How much?” The recruits haggled among themselves for endless minutes, then a fellow in clown’s orange stepped forward. “Two movills each.” The cashier from Sina counted the house, then reached within her robe and produced forty-four of the copper beads. As she handed them to Painter, she grinned. “There is, of course, the small matter of interest.” Painter took the coppers and glared at Fayda. “Of course! And, how much would that be?” “Ten percent.” “Ten . . . that’s robbery!” Fayda shrugged and waved her hand at her companions. “You must admit the risk I take is considerable.” Painter nodded, then passed out the coppers. She sees it, too. If an unlearned copper counter sees it, what am 1 doing here?\" After dropping the last two coppers into the last outstretched hand, Painter resumed his place in the center of the half-circle, remembering exile to be the penalty for failing to pay debts within a reasonable length of time. He looked down, scratching the back of his neck. A few more sessions like this and I’ll be in hock up to my ears. He nodded once, then looked up. “Before we begin, there is the small matter of the payment for my services.” Roos looked at his companions, then back at Painter. “How much does the instructor charge?” Painter folded his arms. “Three coppers apiece.” “Thief!” cried a freak from the back. “We only charged two!” Painter shrugged. “A war is about to leap square in the mid- dle of your chests, and you have no idea what to do about it. I do. Is this knowledge of value to you?” As the recruits grumbled. Painter heard footsteps coming up from behind. He turned to see Allenby smiling and shaking his head. “Lord Allenby.” “I see things are progressing well. Painter.” Painter snorted. “May I ask what brings you here?” Allenby nodded. “I have come to congratulate you, Painter. By my appointment, you are now the official military commander of the Moman Armed Forces.” Painter stared at the Great States- 42 PRIEST OF THE BARABOO man while several comments competed for expression. Allenby turned and spoke over his shoulder as he left. “War is hell, Painter. War is hell.” Painter turned hack to face his charges. Roos, a black frown on his face, held out Painter’s coppers and dropped them into his outstretched palm. “Do you want to count them?” Painter nodded. “Of course.” Painter counted out the forty- four coopers, plus interest, handed them to the cashier and pock- eted the balance. Fayda, the cashier, bowed. “The instructor may depend upon a lower rate of interest in the future from Fayda. I see he is a man of means.” Painter nodded as an image of himself leading the Moman Armed Forces against Arvanian mercenaries flashed through his mind. I must remember to ask Allenby bow much the job pays. I don’t think it will be enough. Koolis, Master of the Great Ring of Tarzak, stood in the center of the darkened amphitheater, his gaze caressing the starlit, cut- stone tiers. The circus, loaded into lizard- and horse-drawn wag- ons, had departed hours before. They had begged him to come, but Koolis remained behind. My place is here, with the Ring. My obligations to the circus are met; the circus is safe. “Father?” Koolis turned toward the spectator’s entrance and squinted as a figure approached. “Lissa?” “Yes, Father.” The slender young woman crossed the saw- dust, stopped, and lowered her pack. “You must leave; the invad- ers will be here soon.” Koolis turned his head away and crossed his arms. “We have nothing to discuss.” “You are angry with me still?” Koolis snorted. “My daughter the soldier.” “I did not want to disobey you, Father.” “But you did all the same.” “We must fight — “Bah! We are keepers of the Ring, Lissa, not killers. And, if Momus would field an army, where is it? Why does it leave Tar- zak to the enemy? Why does it not stand and fight?” “Father, if we did face the Arvanians as an army, it would be all over for us. We must use different tactics.” “Skulking behind trees, slipping a knife into a back when no one is looking.” Koolis spat on the ground. “Why are you here in PRIEST OF THE BARABOO 43 Tarzak instead of hiding in the hills along with the rest of our brave soldiers?” Lissa stooped over and lifted her pack, putting the strap over her shoulder. “I was sent to pick up the fireballs.” She reached into the pack and held out an object the size of a small plum. “It is the magician’s trick of intense fire. The case is made of raw cobit dough which forms two chambers inside. Each chamber con- tains a substance, and when the ball is crushed, the substances mix. You’ve seen the trick before and know how hot the fire is. These are special ones; three times larger than the ones the magi- cians use.” Koolis shook his head. “This is a fine day; magicians giving up their secrets — a fine day, indeed!” Lissa placed the fireball into the pack, then turned and faced Koolis. “We are all giving up something. Father — ” Koolis placed a hand over Lissa’s mouth. “Hush!” he whis- pered. “Quick, to the north entrance!” They ran quietly across the sawdust, stopping as they came to the opening in the tiers. As torch-light flickered from the spec- tator’s entrance, they flattened themselves against the entrance wall. Peering around the edge, Koolis began recognizing faces as they entered the Ring. Kardik the murderer, judged and exiled by the town of Tarzak, laughed and slapped another on the back. His companion, Haroman the arsonist, held up his torch and waved it over his head. This Ring was my father’s, and his father’s before him. Mysor — thief, murderer, and gang chieftain — walking next to a squat, black-clad Vorilian, laughed and jabbed the alien in the arm. The alien smiled. This Ring has seen the finest art of Momus. A squad of the earless Arvanian mercenaries, armed with rifles, were followed by a drunken gang of exiles, the blue marks of their judgements still on their foreheads. In this Ring were born our two great laws. Dazzul, thief. Jokosin, thief and murderer. Vaserat, murderer, and many more unfamiliar to Koolis but all bearing the blue marks of judgement. “Hail, Mysor!” began one. The salutation was repeated by the others. “Hail, Mysor! Hail, Mysor!” In the center of the Ring, Mysor held up his hands for silence. The gang of cutthroats quieted. “Who would the Great Ring have 44 PRIEST OF THE BARABOO for its king?” “Mysor!” shouted the small crowd. “Great Mysor, King of Momus!” Koolis turned and saw the horror in Lissa’s eyes. “Lissa, you must tell Allenby.” “Come with me, Father.” Koolis looked down into Lissa’s face and kissed her on the forehead. “I must stay. You see what they do to my Ring?” Lissa closed her eyes and nodded. “Go, then, but leave me a handful of those doughballs.” Koolis reached into Lissa’s pack and filled the pocket of his robe with magician’s fire. Looking up, he saw Lissa crying. “Have strength, little soldier. There will be many such moments before Momus is free of the invaders. Now, go!” The girl turned and ran quickly through the tunnel, out into the dark dusty street. When she stopped and looked back, her father was gone from the entrance. The Arvanian squad leader climbed the low hill overlooking the road to Tieras, signaled his identification, then dropped into a hole occupied by three other mercenaries — two of them still alive. “All quiet, las?” The Arvanian squatting before the portable sensor looked up and nodded. “For more than two hours, squad leader. Think they’ll hit us again?” The night air was still. “No. But keep a sharp eye.” He cocked his head toward the dead mercenary. “How did T’Dulna get it?” The soldier peering over the edge of the hole pulled some- thing from his belt and held it back toward the squad leader. It was a guardless, thin-bladed knife. As the squad leader took the blade, the soldier nodded toward a tree next to the road. “That one down there, next to the tree. He threw it.” The crumpled fig- ure lay motionless. “Threw it? That must be fifty paces, and an uphill throw.” “I make it closer to sixty paces.” The squad leader let out a low whistle. “You two hear about what went on in Tarzak?” “What?” “You know that Moman, Mysor?” The soldier standing at the rim turned his head and spat. “What of him?” “Fingers and his liberation army were staging a little cere- mony to crown Mysor king of Momus when a local patriot took PRIEST OF THE BARABOO 45 the opportunity to throw some kind of firebombs all over the place.” The soldier laughed. “This is the truth?” “I swear it.” “Fingers and Mysor?” The squad leader shrugged. “A little scorched, but still alive.” The soldier turned back to watching the area in front of his position. “Too bad. What of the bomb thrower?” “No one will ever find the pieces.” He climbed to the rim. “Keep alert, unless you want one of those bombs knocking on your palace door.” He stood. “I’ll have your relief here before morning.” The sensor operator pointed at the dead mercenary. “What about him?” “He bothering you?” “No.” “We’ll be moving out in the morning. Grab his papers and turn them in to the company clerk before you fill in the hole.” The squad leader disappeared into the night and the two sol- diers on guard avoided each other’s eyes. The one on the rim sighted down his rifle at the fallen knife-thrower. During the raid PRIEST OF THE BARABOO 46 the fellow had stepped out from behind the tree and lobbed the blade into the hole, catching T’Dulna in the chest. Before he was cut down, the knife-thrower simply stood, looking shocked, mak- ing no attempt at escape. The soldier shook his head, turned his gaze from the dead knife-thrower and studied the shadows. The fortune teller shook her head. “It is no use, Allenby. The Arvanians are not human; their futures are unclear. I cannot see them.” The magician nodded his agreement. “It is as she says, Al- lenby. They are not human; their minds are closed to my powers.” Allenby looked at the two shadows, then turned to a third. “Well, Painter?” The figure shrugged. “At the rate we’re going, we’ll be finished inside of a month. More are joining up — especially after what happened in Tarzak — but we have no time to train them and no equipment.” Painter sighed. “All I can suggest is to follow the circus to the Westlands and begin training all over again.” The fortune teller spoke. “What of our prisoner. Painter? With a prisoner, perhaps we can learn enough about the Arvanians — ” “No!” Painter turned from the fortune teller and faced Al- lenby. “The Arvanians have fought this kind of war before, and our two attempts to get prisoners have cost us over twenty men and women ... we no longer have the time if anything is to be saved.” The Arvanian mercenaries under the command of Naavon Dor, moments after achieving orbit around Momus, put down shuttles near Tarzak, Arcadia, Kuurnic, Miira, and Ris, the main population and road-network centers. Against no resistance, all five towns were occupied, with Admiral Sadiss installing a pup- pet regime in Tarzak and declaring it the legitimate government of Momus. A sixth force of Arvanians, mounted in swift moving hovercrafts and in higher-flying fighters, began sweeps of the countryside, routing out the Moman guerrilla bands. In the short span of nine days, the remains of the Moman Armed Forces — less than a third of its original strength — managed to flee to Anoki and escape by taking to the fishing boats under cover of a storm. The morning of the tenth day saw Naavon Dor declare the central con- tinent secure. . . . The vee formation of hovercraft streaked across the calm blue PRIEST OF THE BARABOO 47 waters of the Western Sea, approaching the almost uninhabited land mass called, by the Momans, Westlands. High above the for- mation, Naavon’s command vehicle — one of the Sword’s shuttles — banked to get a sensor reading on one of the islands that had begun appearing. Naavon looked down at the unspoiled jungle, then left the cockpit and returned to the cargo bay. The large compartment contained his command center, medical unit, and communications. The command-center staff sat glumly behind their consoles, making indifferent adjustments to already adjusted controls. From the back of the compartment Goss’s flute wailed a song of mourning. Naavon walked to the screen that separated his and Goss’s quarters from the cargo bay and looked through the door. Goss was stretched out on his cot playing his flute with a large brown jug nestled in the crook of his arm. “Goss!” The huge officer lowered his instrument and turned a bleary eye toward the door. “Hail, conqueror.” Goss lifted his head and put his mouth to the jug, now upraised. He wiped his mouth on his uniform sleeve after he finished, then belched. “Have we found the elusive foe yet, mighty leader?” “Goss, have you lost your mind? I could have you executed for this. What is that stuff?” Goss shook the jug. “This? It’s a local remedy for a trou- blesome conscience. It’s called ‘sapwine.’ ” He took another swal- low, then held it out. “Care for a blow?” Naavon took the jug and sniffed at it. “Goss, this will kill you before I have a chance to prop your carcass up in front of a firing squad.” Goss sat up, retrieved his jug, and took another gulp. “Good stuff. Helps you forget the work we’ve done these past ten days. Too bad the whole battalion can’t go on a blind; it needs it.” Naavon sat on his own cot facing Goss. “Speak. What demon has its claw in you this time?” “Sadiss. The creature could make mud out of diamonds.” Naavon dropped his glance. “Yes, Naavon, you know what I’m saying. Every soldier in your coitunand is saying the same thing. You saw what Sadiss’s glorious liberation army did to that town? Porse, was it?” “I don’t know. I think so.” Goss drank again. “Doesn’t matter, now, does it? All that loot- ing and killing — just part of the warlords’ magnificent plan, right? In the scale of things, just a few scraps of dust destroying a few 48 PRIEST OF THE BARABOO more scraps?” “Field Officer?” Naavon looked up to see an orderly standing in the door. “What?” “We’ve made landfall. Sensors are picking up something at the base of that small plateau a few minutes inland.” Goss laughed. “By the loving gods, Naavon, we’ve got them now! Hurry and give the orders. This is as much fun as shooting babies in a schoolyard — ” “That will be enough, Goss!” Naavon turned to the orderly. “I’ll be out in a moment.” The orderly nodded and left. Naavon turned back to see Goss stretched out again on his cot emptying the jug. Goss lowered the jug to the floor, closed his eyes and began snoring, “Goss, you fool.” Naavon whispered. “A mercenary is never on the right side nor wrong side of a war; a mercenary is just on a side — the side with the pay voucher.” Naavon hung his head and looked at the deck. I am telling this professional soldier the stan- dard fare fed to raw recruits, and I don’t even believe it myself. The Momans had fought with courage, if not with skill. The few modern weapons they possessed had been taken from the bodies of fallen mercenaries. The rest fought with whatever they had: firebombs, knives . . . Naavon smiled as he remembered that night outside the town called Ris. Arrows began falling into the Arvanian positions. Arrows! The first impulse was to laugh; and they all did, save the five mercenaries who died, wooden shafts protruding from their bodies. Naavon shook his head. The orders from Sadiss were clear: slaughter every last defender. No quarter. He wanted no competi- tion for his liberation army. One* heavy-weapons sweep would probably do it — two at the most — if the terrain were clear. But the Westlands, with its rugged mountains and dense jungles, would re- quire the time-consuming process of rooting the Momans out one at a time. It would require much from the battalion, and the men were long past looking upon this particular job as a war bearing even a shred of dignity. Naavon looked at Goss. The men have seen what Sadiss and Mysor are doing with their gang of criminals, and they have seen the desperation, the courage . . . the honor of the Moman defen- ders. Naavon shook his head and left the compartment to step into the cargo bay, coming to a halt next to his communications operator. “Get me Sadiss.” PRIEST OF THE BARABOO 49 The operator coded in the signal and turned to Naavon. “Ad- miral Sadiss, field officer. Do you want the admiral on visual?” Naavon shook his head. “Admiral?” he called to the blank screen. “field officer dor? have you found them?” “Yes, Admiral. I plan to put down my force soon and attempt to make contact with the Momans by — ” “l REMIND YOU AGAIN: THEY ARE NOT MOMANS; THEY ARE REB- ELS AND TRAITORS. I ALSO REMIND YOU THAT I AM THE COMMAN- DER OF THIS MISSION, AND THAT YOUR ORDERS ARE TO SLAUGHTER EVERY — ” “Arvanians do not make good butchers, Sadiss. If I can bring them to the point of surrender, I will accept — ” “naavon dor, you will accept nothing! do I HAVE TO RE- MIND YOU, AS WELL, THAT I HAVE A MILITARY FORCE OF MY OWN?” “You threaten me with a gang of thugs?” “and my BATTLE CRUISER. I HAVE GIVEN YOU YOUR ORDERS, AND IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THEM, I WILL HAVE YOU HUNTED DOWN AS I WOULD ANY ANIMAL! “I advise against that, Sadiss. That’s a fight over which my men could work up some enthusiasm.” Naavon nodded at the operator. “Break contact, then order the hovercraft force to prepare to put down.” Naavon frowned, then nodded. “Better notify the Sword to go to full alert.” “Yes, Field Officer.” “What are you grinning at?” “Nothing, Field Officer. Nothing at all.” Jeda of the Miira riders, temporary road boss of the Tarzak Circus, followed the juggler named Puga into the dank cave at the base of the plateau. The entrance was hidden behind a thick cover of brush and overhanging trees. He could see no guards, but he knew they were there. The juggler held up his hand. “Wait here, Jeda.” Puga disap- peared around a bend, leaving Jeda alone with his thoughts. He looked toward the mouth of the cave at the jungle green. In the six days since the Arvanians had landed in the Westlands, the Moman defenders had begun holding their own. The invaders would strike, but their target would melt into the jungle before the Arvanians hit. At the cost of many lives, more Arvanian weapons had fallen into Moman hands; and the defenders were now trad- ing lives with the mercenaries one-for-one. While we sit safe in 50 PRIEST OF THE BARABOO the jungle, doing nothing! Jeda turned as he heard footsteps. Puga’s head appeared around the bend in the tunnel. “Come, Jeda. Allenby will see you.” Jeda followed the juggler around twists and turns until they entered a low, torch-lit chamber. Allenby sat crosslegged before a low table littered with hand-drawn maps. Allenby looked up. “Jeda. What brings you? Is all well with the circus?” Jeda crossed his arms. “As well as can be expected.” “Meaning?” “Meaning, we would join the fighting, Allenby. The entire company agrees; that’s why I was sent.” Allenby nodded. “I see.” He shook his head. “No.” “No? Do you have so many fighters that you can afford to ig- nore almost two hundred more?” “Don’t be a fool, Jeda.” “A fool?” “Yes, a fool. Those men and women fighting out there — don’t you know what the circus has become to them? It is their reason to keep going, their symbol, their banner. Do you understand?” “I understand that we sit by letting others do our fighting for us. Momus has been without a circus before — many times.” Allenby rubbed his eyes, then placed his hands together on the table. “Jeda, the circus is Momus right now. Before the war, it was different — everything was different. But now, every freak, clown, and roustabout crouching in the jungle out there needs to know that the circus is intact, safe. If I allowed the circus to break up and join the fighting ranks, I would be serving the Tenth Quadrant’s cause, not ours. Our spirit would crumble.” Jeda looked at the floor of the chamber. \"Great Allenby ... it is hard. It is a hard thing you ask of us.’’ Allenby nodded. \"I know. Go and explain it to the company and make them understand. I am depending on you.” Painter entered the chamber and stood next to Jeda. \"Lord Allenby, the Arvans are beginning the hovercraft sweeps again. \"Is the net ready?” Painter nodded. \"And the rockets.” \"Will the rockets work?” Painter shrugged. \"We couldn’t exactly test them without giv- ing our positions away. The paper-and-bark tubes seem strong enough to handle the fireballs, but . . .” Allenby nodded and stood. \"We should be going, then.” Painter frowned. \"I don’t think you should be there. Lord Al- PRIEST OF THE BARABOO 51 lenby. If things go wrong, which is highly probable, you shouldn’t be in the area.” Allenby pursed his lips, then looked at Jeda. \"You’re right. Painter. Keep me informed.” Painter nodded, turned and left the chamber. Jeda shrugged. \"I should be getting back to the company.” Allenby walked around the table and escorted Jeda through the tunnel. At the mouth of the cave, he placed his hand on the rider’s shoulder. \"Good luck to you, Jeda.” \"And to you.” Allenby watched Puga lead the rider into the jungle until they were both out of sight. He waited another full minute, then turned to his right and ran through the brush to catch up with Painter. In the hovercraft cockpit, Naavon pulled back on the wheel slightly and banked to the right. \"See anything?” Goss looked up from his sensor panel. \"Nothing.” The four armed mercenaries in back watched through the bubble canopy at the jungle below. Goss shook his head. \"It was a mistake to split up and scatter the force, Naavon.” Naavon nodded and swung the hovercraft on a shallow arc to the left. \"Probably, but this way we can cover the same amount of territory in one-tenth the time. If Sadiss would have let us use the shuttles from his ship, it wouldn’t be necessary.” Goss laughed. \"Naavon, if that piece of slime had kept his gang in check on the central continent, we would have enough of our own shuttles.” Naavon grimaced. The central continent had been secure, but Mysor’s bully boys had stirred things up. Sabotage had left all but two of the shuttles from the Sword useless. “Goss, have you heard anything further from the second company?” Goss shook his head and returned his gaze to the sensor screen. “My guess is that the resistance on the central continent isn’t organized and isn’t directed from here. I think it’s simply a popular response to Mysor’s political acumen. . . . Wait!” Goss ad- justed the screen, then looked up and out through the canopy. “Eighteen degrees to the right, in that valley. I picked up motion readings, but they’re gone now.” Naavon banked the craft to the right. “Let’s take a look. We’ll come in high first.” Naavon guided the craft down the length of the valley, turned and hovered at the opposite end. “Readings?” 52 PRIEST OF THE BARABOO Goss shook his head. “Nothing on motion or electro-magnetic fields. Try it low and slow and I’ll look for some heat.” Naavon pushed the wheel forward, aiming into the valley, and leveled the craft a few meters from the treetops. “Anything?” Goss studied the screen. “Not yet.” Bits and flecks of red ap- peared on the screen showing the rich animal life helow, but none of the traces were large enough to be men. “Wait . . . no, the way it moved off it must have been an animal.” Twin red streaks went up the sides of the screen. “Naavon — ” “I see it!” Goss looked up to see two rockets pulling skyward, lifting a huge net. The craft lurched as Naavon attempted to avoid the trap, but one edge of the net was anchored to the jungle floor, making the rockets swing over, so that the net fell over the craft. Naavon struggled to land the craft upright, but it pulled sideways and slammed into a tree, then into a vine-covered rock wall. Naavon opened his eyes to see the craft on its side, the canopy shattered open and himself staring into the business end of a beamer. At the other end of the rifle was someone he recognized from the in- telligence briefings: Oswald Painter. The young fellow grinned. “Well, well, Naavon Dor. Look at you.” PRIEST OF THE BARABOO 53 In the light of a single torch, Naavon walked around the small cave-prison examining the walls while Goss played a dreamy melody on his flute. The field officer halted his search for an es- cape route and looked down at his second-in-command sitting crosslegged on the cave floor. “Seeing that four of our comrades are dead, Goss, wouldn’t a serious tune be more appropriate?” Goss lowered the flute and looked up. “In scale with the uni- verse, Naavon, what are the deaths of four mercenaries? Next to the rock that is the plan of the Tenth Quadrant’s warlords, we are but splashes of fluid, a hiss of vapor — ” “You twist my words with skill, Goss.” Naavon crossed his arms and leaned against the cave wall. “Very well, old friend, let’s hear it.” “Hear what?” “Whatever it is you’ve been wanting to say ever since the Sword went into orbit.” Goss shrugged, played a short phrase and stopped half-way through a repeat. “We’ve been together a long time, Naavon.” He smiled. “If you want, I k"
