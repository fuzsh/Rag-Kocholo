Ever since the early '80s when Newsong first formed in Valdosta, South Georgia, producing their first album 'Son In Their Eyes', this team of pop harmonisers have continued to produce a canon of work of outstanding quality. Eddie Carswell and Leonard Ahlstrom are two fine singers and songwriters. It was good to hear a brilliant duet performance from Gotee Records girl group Out Of Eden on "Like Minded, Like Hearted". They make the song perfect in a clear contemporary take on how their two very different styles of music can compli­ment each other, being easy on the ears and successful in its vision and pro­duction. The lyrics to many of these songs are scripturally sound, so the band have something to say and they have said it well. This compilation will satisfy old fans and may find some new ones.
