        "text": "This is classic Mike Warnke, from what I would consider to be his peak era. His material from around this time was perfectly placed and timed, hilarious and poignant. His Gospel message was perfectly intertwined with his brand of comedy and fun at the expense of himself and his fellow Christians. Despite his later recanting of involvement in occultism, Mike gave us some great stuff. This album includes the classic “Saga of Dougie and Will” which provided no end of entertainment through all my junior high years. Every story has those memorable moments, quotable quips that you can say to your best friend to make them laugh with just a word or two.\n\nIt should be noted that Warnke was revealed as a liar and fraudster in 1991 by Cornerstone magazine. This recording is offered as a historic record of what was being listened to in the Christian community in the late 70’s and early 80’s.\n\nCredits\n\nEdited By – Brown Bannister\n\nLiner Notes – Rose Warnke\n\nPhotography By – John Miller\n\nProducer – Wes Yoder\n\nRemix – Brown Bannister\n\nCompanies, etc.\n\nMastered At – Masterfonics\n\nIt was 1980 at the Melodyland Theatre in Anaheim CA when The Archers recorded this live album. The title track was a new song from them and was very well received. Often a easy listening band will turn it up a notch for their concerts but I have to honestly say that The Archers you hear on their studio albums was The Archers you heard at this concert. Humorously they introduce “I’m Gonna Rise” by saying “How many of you like Rock & Roll? Does anybody like Rock & Roll?” and then proceed to do something I sure wouldn’t classify as Rock & Roll even for 1980. A guitar solo does not make a song Rock & Roll guys. That said the horns did a great job on that track. Point of trivia is that the band was introduced by John Styll who was the man that started CCM magazine.\n\nCredits\n\nArranged By – Bobby Cicso, Clark Gassman, Dan Cutrona, Phil Kristianson, The Archers (3)\n\nBacking Vocals – Stephanie Reach\n\nBass Guitar – Tim Jaquette\n\nDesign, Illustration – Kernie Erickson\n\nDrums – Michael Fickling\n\nElectric Guitar – Tony Sena\n\nEngineer – Biff Dawes\n\nEngineer [Second] – Billy Youdelman\n\nMixed By – Jack Joseph Puig\n\nOrgan [Hammond B-3], Clavinet, Keyboards [Fender Rhodes, Arp], Synthesizer – Phil Kristianson\n\nOther [Concert Introduction] – John Styll\n\nPercussion – Phil Bahn, Steve Archer\n\nPhotography By – Gary Null\n\nPiano, Synthesizer, Vibraphone, Marimba – Dan Cutrona\n\nProducer – Bill Cole (2), Steve Archer, Tim Archer\n\nRecorded By – Filmways/Heider Recording\n\nSaxophone, Flute – Gary Herbig\n\nTrombone, Euphonium – Bill Reichenbach (2)\n\nTrumpet – Charles Davis, Larry Hall\n\nVocals – Janice Archer Cruse, Steve Archer, Tim Archer\n\nCompanies, etc.\n\nPhonographic Copyright (p) – Lexicon Music, Inc.\n\nCopyright (c) – Lexicon Music, Inc.\n\nMastered At – Capitol Mastering\n\nRecorded At – Melodyland Theatre, Anaheim\n\nIn my opinion this was Joe’s best album as these are the most upbeat version of these songs in his catalog. This album was recorded through the UK from at least 6 different concerts. I actually saw this tour in Canada and I remember it being much more Rock & Roll than this. I suspect that Myrrh records actually hunted out the most mellow version of these song as they could. This brings me to my criticism of this album. I don’t know about everyone else but I like Live albums so I can hear the banter between songs. This album does not include any of that. It was produced like a regular album but with live recordings. This is not what a live album is supposed to be like in my opinion. You in no way feel the concert experience from this album. So let’s be clear, this is not really a Live album by my definition.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 – To Love Is To Live – 5:08\n\n2 – Midnight Angel Choir – 4:41\n\n3 – Dyin’ – 3:41\n\n4 – Rio Samba – 9:24\n\n5 – Power Of Prayer – 4:24\n\n6 – Let Me Praise You Again – 4:38\n\n7 – Learn To Celebrate – 4:14\n\n8 – Get Ready – 7:05\n\nCredits\n\nBass Guitar – Tim Smith\n\nExecutive Producer – Ray Nenow\n\nGuitar, Backing Vocals – George Cocchini, Paul Brannon\n\nKeyboards – John Lawry\n\nVocals, Drums, Producer – Joe English\n\nCompanies, etc.\n\nRecord Company – Word, Inc.\n\nCopyright (c) – Word, Inc.\n\nDistributed By – A&M Records Of Canada Limited\n\nNotes\n\nMobile unit by Manor, London, England and Tape 1, London, England\n\nRecorded at Colson Hall, Bristol, England; Ulster Hall, Belfast, Ireland; Wembley Arena, Wembley, England\n\nMixed at Great Circle Sound, Nashville, TN and Sound Emporium, Nashville, TN\n\nFarrell and Farrell were for the main part a easy listening/light rock band but this live album offers a hint to their ability to do some Rock and Roll. Recorded live at the Civic Center Music Hall in Oklahoma City this concert sounds like it was great. I normally wouldn’t normally listen to a Farrell and Farrell very many times but honestly this album is on my regular listening rotation. I actually wish I had been at this concert. Something that most would be surprised to hear me say given my penchant for Rock & Roll. So if you think Farrell and Farrell are a little to easy listening for you give this album a listen, you might be pleasantly surprised. Point of trivia about this album is that it was in part produced by Eddie DeGarmo which probably gives it the sound that I like it so much.\n\nTitle\n\n1 – All You Need\n\n2 – Let the Whole World Know\n\n3 – After All Those Years\n\n4 – Boundless Love\n\n5 – Make Me Ready\n\n6 – No Need\n\n7 – Homesick Soldier\n\n8 – You Keep Me Holdin’ On\n\n9 – Jailhouse Rock\n\n10 – Let the Whole World Know (Reprise)\n\nCredits\n\nMember Role\n\nLeonard Ahlstrom Songwriter, Electric Guitar, Background Vocals\n\nBrown Bannister Songwriter\n\nJohn T.

Twila had made a name for herself as far as female vocalists were concerned. Her previous albums had 7 charting singles but this album dominated the charts after it’s release. It had 5 singles with songs peaking at #1, #2, #10, #20, and #32. The lead single, Runner, made it to #1 and was at that position for 9 weeks. It also sat on the charts for 26 weeks, yes 6 months. This has to be one of the most successful CCM albums of all time. I don’t have any stats in front of me but wow, this was an impressive album. The albums had a few different covers, the first and most common was a picture of a golden path to a castle. Subsequent ones featured Twila’a picture. The first was ugly in my opinion and here’s a hint to any aspiring record companies. Put the pretty girl on the cover!!! This is a tried and true method to improve sales. One small piece of trivia on the album is that Twila’s little sister, Starla Paris, sang backup on Runner.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 – Runner – 4:02\n\n2 – Center Of Your Will – 4:33\n\n3 – Tellin’ The Truth – 4:12\n\n4 – Language Of Disciples – 3:40\n\n5 – Lamb Of God – 4:04\n\n6 – The Child Inside You – 4:04\n\n7 – Breaking My Heart – 3:19\n\n8 – It All Goes Back – 3:51\n\n9 – Release Of The Spirit – 2:10\n\n10 – He Is Exalted – 3:37\n\n11 – Faithful Men – 3:24\n\nCredits\n\nArranged By – Carl Marsh\n\nBacking Vocals – Starla Paris\n\nBass Guitar – Leon Gaer\n\nDrums – Keith Edwards\n\nElectric Guitar – Marty Walsh\n\nKeyboards – Carl Marsh\n\nMastered By – Bernie Grundman\n\nPercussion – Alex MacDougall\n\nProducer – Jonathan David Brown\n\nSongwriter, Backing Vocals – Twila Paris\n\nSynthesizer – Rhett Lawrence\n\nCompanies, etc.\n\nPhonographic Copyright (p) – Star Song Records\n\nCopyright (c) – Star Song Records\n\nCopyright (c) – StraightWay Music\n\nPressed By – Electrosound Los Angeles – 27059\n\nPresented without any theological commentary, as usual.

They produced a five song demo called Frontline Life and then in 1987 they recorded 2 tracks for the California Metal compilation album. The reception must have been good because Regency Records signed them to a record deal that same year and this album came out of that contract. This was their only album in the 80’s but they did get together again in 1995 to release a second album. While they were a Glam Metal band the album has a little more talent than the average Band in this category. I actually find the production to be excellent considering they produced it themselves. Of course the mix being done by Dino Elephante probably helped a lot. Point of trivia is that John Elephante provided some background vocals for the album.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 – Heartbreaker – 3:45\n\n2 – Frontline Life – 3:31\n\n3 – We Are The Children (Of Our Lord) – 4:40\n\n4 – On The Rock – 2:41\n\n5 – I’m Not Alone – 5:57\n\n6 – Right Time – 4:09\n\n7 – Run Into The Light – 4:30\n\n8 – Far Cry (From Eden) – 4:33\n\n9 – Outta The Way – 3:50\n\n10 – Victory – 4:04\n\nCredits\n\nBacking Vocals – Bob Carlisle, Cherrie Mancaruso, Donna Rood, John Elephante\n\nBass – Ed Ott\n\nDrums – Michael Betts\n\nEngineer, Mixed By – Dino Elephante\n\nEngineer, Mixed By, Programmed By [Computer Programming] – Mike Mierau\n\nExecutive-Producer – David Malme, John Moore\n\nGuitar – Don Webster\n\nIllustration – Greg Zook\n\nMusician [Additional] – Chris Unruh, P.K.

She started her music career in her family band who had great success with 13 albums and 6 Dove awards. In the mid 70’s she started a band called Heirloom but they never released an album. That brings us to 1982 when Candy finally got her own record deal and this album is the result. At this point in history all the labels were looking for the next Amy Grant and Candy fit that search. Now I am going to cause some controversy because I think Candy is a better vocalist than Amy. I’m kind of confused as to why she didn’t have a lot more success. That said this album did spawn a single, In A Different Light, but it only made it to #28 on the CCM charts. The best part of this album for me are that there are a couple of country tracks on the album that are very good and could easily be released today. It’s a traditional country but it’s very well done.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 – In A Different Light – 2:41\n\n2 – The Shepherd – 3:04\n\n3 – The Only Real Peace – 3:31\n\n4 – Cast Your Bread Upon The Water – 3:15\n\n5 – I’m Gonna Hold On To You – 2:49\n\n6 – I’m Yours Now – 3:51\n\n7 – Hold Fast To The Right – 3:17\n\n8 – I Am Not Along – 3:09\n\n9 – The Rock That Never Rolls – 2:37\n\n10 – Make Yourself At Home (In My Heart) – 2:56\n\nCredits\n\nBacking Vocals – Bill Beld, Caroline Traylor, Diane Tidwell, Joel Hemphill, Julie Mouser, Labreeska Hemphill, Lisa Silver, Norman Holland, Sheri Huffman, The Cherry Sisters, Trudy Barker Bass – Jack Williams, Steve Schaffer Guitar – Billy Sanford, Bobby Thompson, Pete Bordonali Keyboards – Bobby Wood, Hargus “Pig” Robbins, Shane Keister\n\nPercussion – Jerry Carrigan, Kenny Malone\n\nSteel Guitar – Pete Wade\n\nStrings – The Nashville String Machine\n\nJohn Fischer is known for the quantity of quality albums he released. This 1976 release relied strongly on scripture. On this album five tracks directly quote scripture which was very well received by his audience. Many considered this a Jesus Music album but it is just too Easy Listening for me to categorize it that way. Bottom line, it’s an excellent album if you like this style of music. John truly is an excellent singer/songwriter.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 – Naphtali – 6:36\n\n2 – We Are His Workmanship – 3:50\n\n3 – Don’t Veil The Door – 3:36\n\n4 – Work Out The Life – 2:48\n\n5 – Naphtali Arise – 2:51\n\n6 – Angel’s Song – 3:38\n\n7 – Mary & Joseph – 4:25\n\n8 – Song For The Good Times – 3:44\n\n9 – Live In The Power – 4:53\n\n10 – Arise My Beloved – 4:01\n\nCredits\n\nArranged By – Clark Gassman\n\nArtwork, Design – Jim Lamb\n\nBacking Vocals – Dan Collins, Walt Harrah\n\nBass – Reinie Press\n\nDrums – Hal Blaine, Ron Tutt\n\nEngineer – Jerry Barnes\n\nGuitar – Dean Parks, Jay Graydon\n\nGuitar, Keyboards – John Fischer\n\nKeyboards – Clark Gassman, Joe Sample\n\nPercussion – Joe Piccaro\n\nProducer – Dan Collins\n\nSteel Guitar – Al Perkins\n\nCompanies, etc.\n\nRecord Company – Lexicon Music, Inc.\n\nPhonographic Copyright (p) – Lexicon Music, Inc.\n\nRecorded At – United Western Studios\n\nThis was the 4th album from The Call. The previous 3 were relatively well received but this album was the real break out album for them. I am surprised by the number of CCM fans that do not know that The Call was a band of Christians. They weren’t a Christian Band per say but a band of Christians who did secular music. But if you really listen it’s secular music with Christian undertones. Of course the great single off the album is I Still Believe. The song has been covered by many including Russ Taff. While I was researching The Call I found a quote from Michael Been that sums up a lot of how I felt about CCM music in the 80’s;\n\n“I [wish] Christian musicians wrote more about their life experiences instead of trying to be so ‘on the nose’ with spiritual language. It doesn’t give people room to be who they are at the stage they’re at in life. I like to write with the feel of parables, not in strict language. I’m attracted to people who tell me a story, and then I see what it stirs up in my own life. But putting Psalms to music? Taking 30 lines from the Bible for a song? That’s why I like religious books, for instance, rather than books on religion.”\n\nTracklist\n\n1 – Everywhere I Go – 4:18\n\n2 – I Still Believe (Great Design) – 5:30\n\n3 – Blood Red (America) – 3:42\n\n4 – The Morning – 4:40\n\n5 – Oklahoma – 4:18\n\n6 – With Or Without Reason – 4:02\n\n7 – Sanctuary – 3:57\n\n8 – Tore The Old Place Down – 4:12\n\n9 – Even Now – 4:37\n\nCredits\n\nArt Direction – Carol Friedman\n\nDesign – Janet Perr\n\nDrum Programming – Jimmy Bralower\n\nDrums, Vocals – Scott Musick\n\nEngineer – Rob Eaton\n\nEngineer [Assistant] – Don Rodenbach, Eric Mohler\n\nGuitar, Vocals – Tom Ferrier\n\nKeyboards, Vocals – Jim Goodwin\n\nManagement – Gary Heaton\n\nMastered By – Jack Skinner\n\nMastered By [Cd] – Barry Diament\n\nOther [Photography Research] – Carol Been\n\nProducer – The Call\n\nProducer, Written-By, Bass, Guitar, Lead Vocals – Michael Been\n\nProgrammed By [Keyboards] – Jeff Bova\n\nWritten-By – Jim Goodwin (tracks: 2, 8)\n\nCompanies, etc.\n\nManufactured By – Victor Company Of Japan, Ltd.\n\nPhonographic Copyright (p) – Elektra/Asylum Records\n\nCopyright (c) – Elektra/Asylum Records\n\nRecorded At – Power Station\n\nMastered At – Sterling Sound"
