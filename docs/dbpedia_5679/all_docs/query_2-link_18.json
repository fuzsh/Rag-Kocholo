        "text": "Grief is as unique as a snowflake. With its many facets and fractals, there is no telling how we will react to the loss of a loved one, and just as each snowflake is unique, so, too, is each individualâs grief. While much of grief is uncertain, we do know that regardless of how we grieve, we share a need for our grief to be witnessed.\n\nMusic can serve as a witness to our griefâespecially during the holidays. We recognize that not everyone celebrates Christmas. However, for those who do, we understand that Christmas can bring a wave of emotions. Therefore, weâve curated an Eterneva Holiday Playlist of Christmas songs that may be helpful to individuals grieving during this time of year, as they encourage us to be present in our emotions, relive previous memories, and find hope in the days ahead.\n\nâ\n\n5 Sad Holiday Songs that Allow You to Be Present in Your Grief\n\nStudies reveal there is a connection to listening to âsad songsâ and coping with loss. Because each song is essentially a story with a beginning, middle, and end, it provides a naturally contained space for us to lean into our feelings. Sometimes we find comfort in simply knowing that we have three to four minutes to fully accept our grief and move forward with our day.\n\n1.âChristmases When You Were Mineâ\n\nPerformed by Taylor Swift | Written by Taylor Swift ,Liz Rose, and Nathan Chapman\n\nOne of the wonderful things about this song is its ambiguity. The lyrics do not explicitly state what kind of loss the song is about, whether a death, a breakup, or otherwise. Therefore, it presents as a Christmas song about lost loved ones that can span different types of losses, and is relatable to anyone mourning a loss on Christmas who does not feel as joyous as those around them.â\n\nâ\n\n2. âA Different Kind of Christmasâ\n\nPerformed by LeAnn Rimes | Written by Jud J. Friedman, Leann Rimes, Allan Rich, Pete Amato\n\nPeople who are grieving the loss of their father (or father figure) at Christmas will feel seen by this song. By acknowledging the new lens with which we view the world when someone we love is gone, the song validates the sense of feeling lost this time of year that is meant to be filled with holiday cheer.\n\nâ\n\n3. âWhere Are You Christmasâ\n\nPerformed by Faith Hill | Written by James Horner and Will Jennings\n\nThis song, known for its debut on How the Grinch Stole Christmas, is a melancholy song that ultimately provides a glimmer of hope. It speaks to the way grief can upend our world, but even if weâre lost, Christmas lives inside us and âfills each and every heart with love.â\n\nâ\n\n4. âThe Christmas Shoesâ\n\nPerformed by NewSong | Written by Eddie Carswell, Leonard Ahlstrom, and Isaiah Daniel\n\nIf youâre in the mood for a good cry, grab some tissues and turn on âThe Christmas Shoes.â This relentlessly sentimental holiday classic paints a portrait of a young boy who doesnât have enough money to buy a pair of shoes for his dying mother, who he wants \"to look beautiful, if she meets Jesus tonight.\"\n\nâ\n\n5. \"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\"\n\nPerformed by Darlene Love | Written by Ellie Greenwich, Jeff Barry, and Phil Spector.\n\nThe sentiment of this song is a person wishing their loved one would come home for the holidays, and reflecting on all the fun they had the year before. The lyrics acknowledge that, although the snow is falling and people are singing âDeck the Halls,â the person is not in the Christmas spirit because they are missing their special someone.\n\nâ\n\n5 Nostalgic Holiday Songs for Remembering Good Times\n\nMemories are one of the greatest gifts we have, especially when it comes to remembering loved ones who have passed on. Reflecting on all the good times we shared with them helps us move forward in a positive way and appreciate the time we were given with them.\n\n1.âSomewhere In My Memoryâ\n\nPerformed by Nick Pitera | Written by John Williams and Leslie Bricusse\n\nRecognized as the main title of the classic Home Alone, âSomewhere In My Memoryâ is a Christmas canticle about joy and the true reason for the season. From âprecious momentsâ to âhappy faces,â it invites us to remember the wonderful Christmases weâve enjoyed over the years with the ones we love most.\n\nâ\n\n2. âBelieveâ\n\nPerformed by Josh Groban | Written by Glen Ballard and Alan Silvestri\n\nTo a child, the magic of Christmas is unparalleled. As we grow older and experience some of the hardships that unfortunately come with life, we may lose sight of whatâs important. This song speaks to those of us who have lost our way, and encourages us to believe in our dreams. After all, thereâs so much to celebrate.\n\nâ\n\n3. âMerry Christmas Darlingâ\n\nPerformed by The Carpenters | Written by Frank Poole and Richard Carpenter\n\nThe magic of the holidays is that they can still offer hope and joy even in the darkest of times. In Merry Christmas, Darling, the narrator is without her beloved, but she knows âI can dream and in my dreams, Iâm Christmasing with you.â This beautiful song shows us that by remembering our loved ones during the holidays, we can keep them close.\n\nâ\n\n4. âLet It Be Christmasâ\n\nPerformed by Alan Jackson | Written by Alan Jackson\n\nThis country song not only describes the beautiful sights during Christmas, but invites us to let go of anger, hate, and fear, and instead, open ourselves up to âlove that lasts through the year.â Itâs mellow, pleasing to the ear, and a must-play during the holiday season.\n\nâ\n\n5. âHave Yourself A Merry Little Christmasâ\n\nPerformed by Sam Smith | Written by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blaine\n\nIs there a better song to reflect on the âolden days of yoreâ than âHave Yourself A Merry Little Christmas?â This classic carol is absolutely transportive as it takes us through a snowy stroll down memory lane with âfaithful friends who are dear to us.â Listening to this song will have you feeling reminiscent and at peace as, if only for a moment, your troubles begin to melt away.\n\nâ\n\n5 Hopeful Holiday Songs to Lift Your Spirit\n\nWhen darkness falls, hope is a glimmer of brightness. The important thing to remember about grief is that it is temporary. If we acknowledge and work through our emotions, we will discover that there is life after loss.\n\n1.âBetter Daysâ\n\nPerformed by the Goo Goo Dolls | Written by Johnny Rzeznik\n\nOriginally commissioned as a holiday CD, the Goo Goo Dollsâ album Let Love In featuring their single, Better Days, became an anthem as America recovered from Hurricane Katrina in 2005. However, with lyrics that point to not needing boxes wrapped in string and a promise of better days, the song offers an uplifting message to those of us seeking brightness in the new year.\n\nâ\n\n2.âChristmas in Heavenâ\n\nPerformed by Scotty McCreery | Written by Unknown\n\nâChristmas in Heavenâ is a gorgeously written and performed song that paints an aspirational picture of the beauty that awaits after life on this Earth. While it tugs on the heartstrings, it reminds us that our loved ones are in a better place, where thereâs âsnow falling down on the streets of gold, and mansions all covered in white.â\n\nâ\n\n3.âDo You Hear What I Hear?â\n\nPerformed by Carrie Underwood | Written by Noel Regney and Gloria Shay Baker\n\nWhat is at first glance thought to be a classic Christmas song, âDo You Hear What I Hear?â is laced with gripping allegory, as it was written in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. During this time, Americans were waiting with bated breath, listening to their radios to see if they had been obliterated; meanwhile, songwriters Noel Regney and Gloria Shay Baker were tasked with writing a Christmas song. The mention of âa child,â and the âshepherd boyâ certainly places it in the Christmas context; however, the âtrail as big as a kiteâ is in reference to both the biblical star that led the Magi to the Christ child and a nuclear missile. Ultimately, this is a hopeful song as people prayed for, and believe in, the good of the world.\n\nâ\n\n4.âMerry Christmasâ\n\nPerformed by Ed Sheeran and Elton John | Written by Ed Sheeran, Elton John, and Steve Mac\n\nTwo kings of pop come together to sing a festive Christmas song about celebrating after a tough year. This cheery little number is about moving forward and appreciating the people who have been there for you in the past and present, because ânext year, you never know.â\n\nâ\n\n5. âThe Light of the Worldâ\n\nPerformed by Lauren Daigle | Written by Lauren Daigle, Paul Mabury, and Paul Duncan\n\nâThe world waits for a miracle, the heart longs for a little bit of hope,â are the lyrics that launch this uplifting song. By reflecting on the 400 years of silence between the Old Testament and the New Testament, Daigle encourages people to find strength and peace in knowing that the Messiah will come and bring light to the world again.\n\nâ\n\nThe Healing Power of Music\n\nMusic connects. Music heals. Ultimatelyâ¦ music listens. Through songs that acknowledge our grief, we feel heard and understood, and when we feel understood, we feel safe to access and accept our deepest emotions.\n\nTo explore more about the healing power of music, our Songs for Grieving article may help you discover more songs to help you through a difficult time.\n\nIf you are missing someone special this year, we hope you find peace in remembering the good times you shared together.
