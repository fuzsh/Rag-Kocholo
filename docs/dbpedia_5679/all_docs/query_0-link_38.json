She grew up in Princeton, WV and has been performing her signature blend of roots, country and folk music across the country since she was a teenager, continuing a long and distinguished family tradition in music.\n\nIn 2021 Delnora released a new album entitled, “Blank Page” co-produced by Chris Golden (son of William Lee Golden). By November, \"BLANK PAGE\" had already climbed to #1 on Steve Roberson's Christian Country Music Countdown on HLE Radio and by...\n\n2022 \"BLANK PAGE\" hit the Charts at #1\n\nFebruary on PowerSource\n\nMarch on Cashbox\n\nApril on Christian Voice\n\nIn May 2022, Delnora released \"Man At The Well\" (Co-produced by Josh Swift) & it debuted at #1 on Christian Music Weekly! She, also, had an eventful summer, once again, being nominated for ICMA's \"Female Vocalist of the Year\", \"Songwriter of the Year\", \"New Artist of the Year\" and \"Inspirational Song of the Year\" - Blank Page.\n\nShe took home:\n\n\"NEW ARTIST OF THE YEAR\"\n\nand\n\n\"Blank Page\" won \"INSPIRATIONAL SONG OF THE YEAR'!\n\n\" To God Be the Glory!\n\nThank y’all so much for supporting this album!!\n\nMy prayer is that everyone hear the good news...\n\nOnly because of Jesus can we all begin\n\nanew… fresh… every day… forgiven…\n\nwith a “Blank Page”\n\n~ Delnora\n\nMAY 2023 \"Thankful\"went to #1 on Cashbox Magazine's\n\nChristian Country Music Chart.\n\nMAY 2024 \"You Get To Me\" went to #2 on Cashbox Magazine's Christian Country Top 100 Music Chart.\n\nWhile \"You Get to Me\" is still climbing the charts,\n\nDelnora is preparing for her next releases to radio which she will\n\ndebut on theGRAND OLE OPRY Stage May 29th at the Inspirational\n\nCountry Music Awards.\n\nSTAY TUNED!\n\nLOVE GOD. LOVE PEOPLE. LOVE MUSIC.\n\n\"Music’s in the bloodlines for Delnora Reed; her great-grandfather Henry Reed’s fiddle tunes are a centerpiece of the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. Her own efforts, while steeped in old-time country and bluegrass, are considerably more contemporary. Such songs as “Sleepwalking” split the difference between Alison Krauss and Patty Griffin, with hushed sincerity and gutsy delivery.\" ~ K. Oliver\n\n\"There is a hidden gem in Nashville that deserves more recognition than she has ever received by the name of Delnora Reed. She has one of the prettiest voices in Music City and has finally released a new record titled, My Song. Her voice is so pure you can hear the emotions with every word… After reviewing her albums for some time, it has been an honor to see her grow as an artist and with the results of My Song she has finally found her mark.\"\n\n~ Scott Sexton\n\nDelnora has shared the stage with Craig Morgan, Carl Jackson, Larry Cordle, Jerry Salley, Marty Stuart, Jeff Bates, Dave Gibson, Eddie Stubbs, The Chuck Wagon Gang, Chris Golden, Joe Allen, Stella Parton, Georgette Jones, Paul Thorn, Carolina Chocolate Drops, Buddy Jewell, Leona Williams, Leonard Ahlstrom, Jason Deere, Jan Howard, Roy Clark, Jr., Jett Williams, Billy Yates, Buck Moore, Gary Duffey, Ed Bruce, Mark Alan Cash, Tommy Barnes, Joey and Rory, Ashley Campbell, The Steep Canyon Rangers, Jessie McReynolds and so many more. She also recorded as a member of the trio The Shotgun Rubies for Grammy Award winner Carl Jackson’s remarkable project, “Orthophonic Joy – The 1927 Bristol Sessions Revisited”, which was released on Sony Records."
