        "text": "When a Christmas song is doing its job well, listeners feel joyful, reverent, inspired or celebratory. The tune is like a holiday gift, stirring up emotions that are merry and bright.\n\nSome Christmas songs are bittersweet, solemn or yearning (“I’ll Be Home for Christmas,” “Blue Christmas,” “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”). Others, like “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,” tell a time-honored children’s story.\n\nEveryone has favorites on the holiday playlist, especially as Dec. 25 draws closer. But let’s face it: Some Christmas songs belong at the very bottom of Santa’s bag. They strike us as cringe-worthy, tone-deaf, inappropriate or just plain silly.\n\nAL.com’s lifestyle team recently made a few picks for the worst Christmas songs ever -- yep, we’re in Grinch mode -- and asked readers to chime in on those tunes via a poll, voting for the lowest of the low. Right now, most folks are gritting their teeth over Mariah Carey’s “All I Want For Christmas Is You.”\n\nComing in second: The novelty ditty “(All I Want for Christmas Is) My Two Front Teeth.” (The poll remains open, so you still can vote for the worst.)\n\nRELATED: Worst Christmas songs: Which makes you say ‘Bah humbug?’\n\nWe also asked AL.com’s social media followers to tell us about Christmas songs they avoid, dislike or downright hate. As it turns out, plenty of seasonal tunes are definitely NOT on the nice list. Here are some of worst offenders, according to responses posted on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.\n\n“THE CHRISTMAS SHOES”\n\n“Hands down! This wins worst Christmas song.” -- Heather Register Sachs\n\n“I hate that maudlin piece of cheesy schlock.” -- Allyson Kitchens\n\n“It’s godawful! And what kid has ever bought their mom shoes for Christmas? It’s not only maudlin, it’s just stupid!” -- Ginny Stahlman Crooks\n\n“Must change the channel, just can’t do it.” -- Kimberley Myers\n\n“It’s such a drag and still somehow catchy.” -- Jacob L. Smith\n\n“No, it’s not catchy. It’s throwy. As in, throw it away and destroy it so it can never be heard again.” -- Alison Parker\n\n“Why is this even a question? It’s “The Christmas Shoes.’ No discussion needed.” -- Jennifer Johnston\n\n“Oh absolutely. I cringe every time I hear it.” -- Naomi Hilton Archer\n\n“‘Chrismas Shoes.’ The name alone shortened my life expectancy. Lord God please inspire the SNL writers to create a skit that takes the laughable soul of the song to new levels. A goldmine. Don’t let us down, SNL. We’re choking on our own vomit over here ... which is certainly an upgrade from choking one someone else’s, but still ... SOS.” -- Jeannie Mullins Morton\n\n“I just listened to it for the first time. What a horribly cheesy song. Just horrible.” -- Daniel Rubin\n\n“Any list that doesn’t include ‘The Christmas Shoes’ is invalid.” -- @WrightBlan\n\n“GRANDMA GOT RUN OVER BY A REINDEER”\n\n“Disgusting, stupid, and horrendous.” -- Mike Cannon\n\n“Worst song ever!!” -- Della Perkins Moore\n\n“I totally agree! Not funny!” -- Annette Brooks\n\n“I’d rather dress as Mariah and karaoke her song than listen to ‘Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer.’ -- @MCSlate\n\n“I WANT A HIPPOPOTAMUS FOR CHRISTMAS”\n\n“Such a ridiculous song.” -- Melanie Vaughn Woods\n\n“With you about the Hippopotamus song. I want to shove an apple in the girl’s mouth so she will stop that awful sound.” -- Deb Lynn\n\n“Hippopotamus song should be outlawed!” -- Christine Foft Strasser\n\n“I detest that song! Makes me angry!!” -- Evelyn Colster\n\n“ROCKIN’ AROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE”\n\n“I absolutely DETEST ‘Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree. ‘I hate it .. with a passion.” -- @jwee1125\n\n“SAME OLD LANG SYNE”\n\n“I hate that Hippopotamus song and ... I also can’t stand the song that starts, ‘Met my old lover in the grocery store …'” -- Jan. W. Barrett\n\n“The song about the stupid grocery store and them drinking is the worst Christmas song ever. I don’t even know what it had to do with Christmas except it takes place on Christmas Eve.” -- Heather Robertson Taylor\n\n“I can’t remember the title but it’s that song where at the end the ‘snow turned into rain.’ It’s a depressing song.” -- Joey Patterson\n\n“I SAW MOMMY KISSING SANTA CLAUS”\n\n“I hate that song!!!” -- Brenda Faye Guy\n\n“Eww.” -- Becky Lloyd\n\n“That one is pretty creepy.” -- Nancy McCall\n\n“DO YOU HEAR WHAT I HEAR?”\n\n“I truly hate ‘Do You Hear What I Hear.’ ‘The child shivers in the cold, let us bring him silver and gold.’ If he’s cold, bring a blanket ... and there’s no mention of silver being brought. And the shepherd boy never talked to the king. ‘Said the king to the people everywhere, pray for peace, people everywhere.’ No, what the king said was to go to Bethlehem and kill all the baby boys. Yeah, really hate this song.” -- Beth Rawls-Welford\n\n“HAPPY XMAS (WAR IS OVER)”\n\n“Terrible song!!!” -- Sherry Maynard\n\n“Hate that song!” -- Susan Covington Fleming\n\n“The one with Yoko yowling in the background.” -- Dan King\n\n“Nothing makes you wanna go kill yourself like the dang song ‘So this is christmas, ahh ahh ahhhhh ah.’ It should be banned like I just can’t even ...” -- Christie Michelle\n\n“GO TO HELL”\n\n“That song Dolly Parton sang to the devil on her Christmas special last night about “Go to H---.” -- Anne Barrow Lowery\n\n“I love her but couldn’t have been more disappointed. I had recorded it but erased it this morning.” -- Joanne Ferguson\n\n“The most ridiculous uncalled for song for a Christmas special.” -- Beth Sheppard-Snow\n\n“I thought if my 9-year-old grandson had been watching this, how would we explain this song to him. ... so disappointed in that song selection.” -- Gay Morgan\n\n“JINGLE BELLS” BY BARKING DOGS\n\n“Those #@*! barking dogs doing ‘Jingle Bells.’” -- Allen Mincey\n\n“Can’t stand the dogs barking ‘Jingle Bells.’” -- Mary Peters Rutland\n\n“SANTA BABY”\n\n“Greediest song ever!” -- Mona M. McClendon\n\n“I can’t stand that mess.” -- Betty White\n\n“I came here to say the same thing. I change the station as soon as it comes on.” -- Cindy Carpenter Hester\n\n“‘Santa Baby’ is the worst ... sung by anyone. Avarice sung by a woman in a sleezy tone. We call it Santa’s hooker song.” -- Michelle Nelson\n\nMORE DISHONORABLE MENTIONS:\n\n“‘Thistlehair the Christmas Bear’ by Alabama… if you don’t know, look it up!” -- Rebecca Hunt\n\n“Anything by Mariah Carey. She sounds like a strangling chipmunk.” -- Ella Byrd Rinehart\n\n“‘Merry Christmas Mama’ (by) Bill Cosby.” -- Ed Turner\n\n“Mary Did You Know?’ is the worst Christmas song ever. Sorry, it just goes on and on.” -- Justin Nash\n\n“Anything sung by the Chipmunks.” -- Pamela Pangle Parsons\n\n“Anything by The Carpenters.” -- Gretchen Sides Aderholt\n\n“The Temptations version of ‘Silent Night.’ That song is eight hours long.” -- Nikki McCelleis\n\n“‘Last Christmas I Gave You My Heart’ ... so sick of this one.” -- Wanda Houck\n\n“‘Feliz Navidad.’ I think it’s because I had to sing it all the time in elementary school music class. Still sick of it.” -- Jennifer Jelinek Rider\n\n“When you actually listen to the words of, ‘Baby, It’s Cold Outside.’” --Jordan Saunders\n\n“‘Blue Christmas’; I had to listen to it, over and over, when I worked one Christmas at Woolworth’s. The manager would not let me or co-workers turn the record over, to hear Elvis’ other songs. If we tried, he would come to turn the record back to that song.” -- Pam Underwood Moore\n\n“‘Last Christmas’ by Wham. Not a Christmas song ... just a pathetic song about George Michael getting dumped the day after Christmas. Nothing to do with Christmas.” -- Matthew Vicinanzo\n\n“Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas’ by The Pretenders. In the words of Randy Jackson, ‘It was pitchy, dawg!’” -- Alex Valencia\n\n“‘Please Daddy Don’t Get Drunk This Christmas.’ The absolute worst!” -- Sherri Russell Brown\n\n“(Everybody’s Waitin’ for) The Man With the Bag.” -- Ben Smith\n\n“Way too many birds in ‘12 days of Christmas!’ Really?? The hell I’m going to do with 184 birds of mixed species?” -- Christopher Horne"
