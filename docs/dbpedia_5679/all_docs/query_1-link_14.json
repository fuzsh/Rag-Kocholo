        "text": "When NewSong presents a free concert in Spartanburg Monday, vocalist Russ Lee will be returning to the city where his music career started.\n\nLee was youth pastor at Bethel Assembly of God in 1990 when he seized the opportunity to tour with the contemporary Christian group TRUTH. ''I realized in Spartanburg that my singing and music were a gift that I could use to reach others,'' Lee said this week in a telephone interview from his Atlanta home. NewSong will perform in the parking lot of First Baptist Church of Spartanburg, 250 E. Main St., as a part of Impact Spartanburg. Singers Erin O'Donnell and Peter Penrose will open at 7 p.m. for the band, which will begin its 90-minute concert about 7:30 p.m., said Britt Dillard, First Baptist minister of media. ''The concert will be absolutely free, no offering and no tickets,'' Dillard said. ''We believe the gospel was free so this evening should be free.'' He said some youth groups intend to arrive about 5 p.m. to tailgate before the concert in the Converse Street parking lot. When Lee and his wife, Mary, decided to go on the road, they had been told they couldn't have children. They found the excitement of 340 days a year on the road enticing. ''My wife and I took everything we had, which wasn't much since we'd only been at Bethel a year, and sold it at a yard sale,'' then went on the road with the group, he said. About three months later, Mary found out she was pregnant, something they saw as a sign they had made the right decision.\n\nTheir son, Casey, was born at Spartanburg Regional Medical Center, then he and Mary rejoined Lee. Life on the road soon became too hard for the family, so Lee traveled on his own for a few months. When Eddie Carswell, founding member of NewSong, found out Lee was on his own, Carswell called and asked if he'd like to join the group. ''NewSong had been the same guys for 12 years,'' Lee said. ''It was a tremendous opportunity.'' In Lee's three years with the group, NewSong has been busier than ever. ''Miracles,'' the debut single from the group's latest album, ''Love Revolution,'' was No. 1 in Christian music for a record five consecutive weeks. Lee said the age bracket to which the group appeals has broadened, but its music is ''not a radical departure from adult contemporary. As our audience gets younger, we try to reach them.'' Dillard said there is a ''strong edge to their music, a power-rock vocal sound. But they'll do plenty of their older stuff. It's definitely a family event.'' Monitors will be available inside the church for senior adults who find the music too loud. In case of rain, the concert will be moved into the sanctuary. Dillard said counselors will be available for people who would like to talk to someone, but that the organizers are interested in people getting to know Jesus, not in recruiting members for First Baptist. Lee said he wants people to see that ''they're not going to change from the outside in, they have to change from the inside out.'' Carswell is group leader, vocalist, percussionist and writer for NewSong, while Lee plays guitar and trumpet in addition to singing. Other group members are Billy Goodwin, who sings and plays guitar and mandolin; Leonard Ahlstrom, guitarist, vocalist and writer; and Scotty Wilbanks, vocalist and writer, who also plays keyboards and saxophone."
