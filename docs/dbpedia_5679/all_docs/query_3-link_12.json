        "text": "In an article I authored last year, Binding a Fragmented World Together with the Strongest Ties (Diplomatic Courier), I noted: \"People around the world are at their most vulnerable. Now is the time for ESG-minded entities to make a breakthrough—to collaborate with faith-based organizations in an all-hands-on-deck approach to address public health risks associated with the global increase in loneliness.\" I am inspired to see Seth Cohen's questions and thoughts included in this post.\n\nWho are faith-driven business leaders that Forbes and #ForbesImpactLab should be paying attention to? (Comments requested!) I have been thinking recently about the power of faith to inspire business leadership, entrepreneurship and prosperity and I am interested in Forbes catalyzing a community of these individuals to share ideas and celebrate successes. So these are the questions I am asking myself (and now you!): 1. Is my hunch right that there is a large group of individuals who lean into faith and spirituality in leading their organizations? 2. What are the best-in-class companies, startups and nonprofits that bridge faith and entrepreneurship in inclusive ways? 3. Who are the funds and foundations that would be interested in these types of business leaders and entrepreneurs? What initiatives already exist that we should be collaborating with? 4. Who are thinkers, authors, academics and influencers I should be meeting and speaking with to advance this project? 5. Would you be interested in joining such a community? I’d love your answers and ideas below and please tag anyone you think might be interested in this conversation and community. Thanks!! #faithpreneurs #faithbasedbusiness #spiritualintelligence #spirituality #faith #religion #religiousorganizations #religiousstudies #futurofwork #erg #brg\n\nHey there LinkedIn community 🚀, I've spent some time recently talking about a topic that I've always been passionate about - Veteran Entrepreneurship. It's an issue close to home, and I believe it merits significant attention. 👥 Veterans make exceptional entrepreneurs. It's been an absolute privilege, as a business leader, to witness how their resilience, discipline, and extraordinary ability to strategize translate into successful business ventures. Here are some points that I think are worth highlighting about our military-turned-business leaders: 🎯First, their grit and determination are unmatched. The military instills in them a never-quit attitude that serves them well in the cutthroat world of entrepreneurship. 🎯Second, they've honed their leadership skills on the toughest terrain - the battlefield. These are leaders who understand the importance of decision-making, motivating teams, and mission achievement in ways that others can only dream of. 🎯Third, with their background, veterans bring a unique perspective to innovation. They’re trained to improvise, adapt, and overcome, which opens the door to new ways of thinking and problem-solving. We need to do more to support these exceptional individuals. They bring their best to industries across the board – #DigitalMarketing, #CustomerExperience, and from #LocalBusiness to imperious corporate sectors. What strategies have you encountered that are specifically aimed at supporting #VeteranOwnedBusiness? Are there any inspiring #SuccessStories you’ve come across in your community or network? Let’s create a space to shine a spotlight on these incredible entrepreneurs! ✨ Share your thoughts, ideas, or stories below. I’m excited to engage in this conversation. #VeteranEntrepreneurship #VeteranLeadership #SmallBusinessTips #BusinessGrowth #BrandStrategy\n\nHello LinkedIn crowd 👋 Exciting News! 🚀 Guess what?
