Listeners are swept away on a Bethlehem journey in the tones and swells of an orchestral ocean, as the story of Jesus' coming unfolds in spoken word and song. The Symphony of Christmas will undoubtedly stand as a cornerstone in the collective library of Bradley Knight's body of musical works. This twenty-one-minute piece was written to accompany the portrayal of the Nativity in the Prestonwood Baptist Church dramatic Christmas program, which has become a renowned production in recent history. This original arrangement and original master recordings, as performed by the London Symphonica, are now available for your Christmas presentation. It stands alone or may be used as part of a longer music program. Production notes and suggestions have been included to help plan the vision of your presentation."
