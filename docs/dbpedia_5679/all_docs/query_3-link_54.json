I'm not doing a new show this year, but wanted to point out some of the holiday songs released in the last year or two.

And to do it after a painful breakup is even more amazing.\n\npublished on 07/24/2020\n\nNew Parent Smell\n\nWhat happens when a pair of professional stand-up comedians become new parents? Jokes in their set are bound to be influenced by parenting and may become harder hitting between the spouses.

Many of the lyrics were about fighting to survive. In the 90s, Peters fought a battle with lymph cancer. He’s since fought rounds with chronic lymphocytic leukemia as well. Looking back, it’s almost as though he’s been fighting cancer through his lyrics long before his first diagnosis. One such example is their breakout hit for America, “Strength” which opened with the lines, “Give me love / Give me hope / Give me strength / Give me someone to live for.”\n\npublished on 06/23/2020\n\nMatt Slocum on Drumming, Teaching, and the Meaning of Success\n\nMatt Slocum always knew he wanted to live close to New York City someday.

It would be one of my favorite albums of all-time from a New Jersey band and still holds up well today. Years after that band broke up, Commons’ guitarist Sean Glonek has become one of the hottest studio guys in the state, working with local artists like Doc Rotten, The Cryptkeeper Five, Honah Lee, and numerous others in addition to being part of national records by Juliana Hatfield and Tanya Donelly. It’s a second act that led to SRG Studios.\n\npublished on 01/25/2020\n\nJay & Molly: Connecting People to the Past via Their Music\n\nArt has always been about connecting us to the past.

David Vargo certainly has one. When he first became a professional musician after graduating from Berklee College of Music he found himself on the road more than 300 days a year touring with artists like Whitney Houston, Phoebe Snow, and Rupert Holmes. These days he’s running his own successful financial services company, promoting his second solo album, and playing clubs instead of arenas. Despite the lower profile he sounds much happier. In fact, he thinks of his national touring days as part of his past musical life.\n\npublished on 12/25/2019\n\nWork Songs\n\n\"I don’t mind the machine, I just don’t want to be its victim…\" Ever since the industrial revolution workers have been face to face with technologies that helped their productivity while threatening their jobs.

As the 2010s come to an end, it dawned on me that four of my favorite artists from New Jersey had all released albums throughout the entire decade with new releases in 2019. There’s something comforting about knowing these artists (James Dalton, Rick Barry, Arlan Feiles, and Anthony D’Amato) are not just continuing to produce music, but continuing to make great music. So here’s a look at their 2019 releases.\n\npublished on 12/25/2019\n\nDavid Spelman of the New York Guitar Festival\n\nThe New York Guitar Festival celebrated its 20th anniversary in May 2019.

It is the theatre company’s 15th anniversary and the 10th year of the Waterfront South Theatre, which was built on the site where Paprzycki’s grandfather once owned a bar. Joe’s life was closely tied to the theatre and to Camden itself for a long time, but that ended a few years ago. Today, he’s living up in North Truro, Massachusetts, and enjoying a new chapter in his life. Instead of regrets, he’s having fun hanging out with people like Kathleen Turner and Tony Kushner.\n\npublished on 11/26/2019\n\nSonofdov\n\n​​​​​​​Those of us who were affected and lived through Hurricane Sandy in 2012 will never forget it.

One thing he did have was a guitar and a desire to write music.\n\npublished on 11/26/2019\n\nZaritza\n\nIn the #metoo era, we have become accustomed to seeing women portrayed as victims. Zaritza, an artist living in Monmouth County, recently released a single and music video for a song that shows a different side - instead of being a victim, the song celebrates female desire and sexuality. It would be a bold song in any era, but it’s completely eye-opening today.\n\npublished on 11/26/2019\n\nSocial Justice and The Quilts of Angola Prison\n\n“I have not given up. I’m here and I want outta here, but, in the meantime, I will create.” That’s the message Maureen Kelleher says she gets from the quilts created by prison inmates. While it may be surprising to learn that people serving life sentences are quilters, it’s a wonderful way for them to express their humanity. Kelleher, an artist, activist, and private investigator, is the curator of an exhibit showcasing quilts created by inmates who first began making quilts through their work as volunteers in the prison hospice project.\n\npublished on 11/07/2019\n\n\"Four Women from Trenton\" at The Center for Contemporary Art\n\nDecades before Trenton’s first Art All Night, the Trenton Artists Workshop Association was created to promote local artists.

Theatre has the ability to bring history to life in plays which resonate with the current world. Luna Stage in West Orange will present the World Premiere of one such play in October.

That’s one of several themes in Tammy Ryan’s wonderful new play The Wake, which is being presented by Premiere Stages now through July 28th. The play, which won the 2019 Premiere Play Festival, deals with issues involving family, marital problems, nature, the environment and climate change.

Two or three songs in it’s clear you are hooked. After their set you head over to the merch table and see several CDs they’ve released over the years.

One look at the summer concert lineup for 2019 shows country artists headlining several shows at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel and BB&T Pavilion in Camden, while some of the biggest stars have brought huge crowds to shows on the Atlantic City beach in recent years. Even many of the biggest rock and roll clubs in the Garden State are hosting sold out country music shows nowadays.

One person who hopes to benefit from this is Lauren Davidson, a country music artist originally from Freehold who aims to build a fanbase while living outside of the Nashville scene.\n\npublished on 05/27/2019\n\nClarence Clemons: Who Do I Think I Am?\n\nAs the saxophone played alongside the Great Wall of China, a voice bellowed, “Who do you think you are?” The man playing the sax was Clarence Clemons and he was in China on a quest to learn the answer to that very question.\n\npublished on 05/27/2019\n\nThe Reservoir: Go To College Or On Tour?\n\nOne of the challenges in making a short film is telling a complete story.

New Jersey Stage was created to help keep arts coverage alive and we have been fortunate to lure many arts writers to our site and magazine. They come because of our audience, their love of the arts, and because they love covering the arts. Unfortunately, they are also working for free. Even celebrated journalists like Bob Makin do not get paid because there simply isn’t the money to do so.\n\npublished on 05/12/2019\n\nKim B.

Girl groups who projected a flashy, united front. Counterculture singers who protested the establishment. Punk rockers who democratized music-making. Riot grrrls who politicized it. And so many more.

Young black men with few ways to escape poverty saw music as a way out, traveling the “chittlin’ circuit” of churches, schools and small auditoriums across the South. Beginning with spirituals sung in an acapella “jubilee’ style, playing to all-black audiences, these groups developed over time a harder, often blues-influenced style with guitars, drums, organ and piano, playing at concert halls like the Apollo Theatre and large auditoriums across the country.\n\npublished on 01/23/2019\n\nJohn Oates Returns To His Roots\n\nWhat began as a tribute to the music of blues great Mississippi John Hurt became a much wider portrait of American music for Rock and Roll Hall of Famer John Oates. On the album, Arkansas, Oates goes back to the music which inspired him to pick up a guitar. He describes the music as being “like Dixieland, dipped in bluegrass, and salted with Delta blues.” It’s the record he says he always wanted to make, and one which may never have been created if he had not moved to Nashville a few decades ago.\n\npublished on 12/22/2018\n\nRise of the Goatman\n\nTheater For The New City presents Beltsville/Rockville, Part 1: Rise of the Goatman, an original play by Englewood resident Matt Okin (Artistic Director of Black Box Studios), from December 27 through January 13.

Cut to 2013, and the adolescent kids of those very same teens are struggling to make sense of their family histories - and the same “mythological” creature - that could be holding them back in life.\n\npublished on 12/22/2018\n\nDr. Demento Covered In Punk\n\nDo you remember Dr. Demento radio shows from back in the day?

Nora was a woman during the 19th century in male dominated Norway when women could not sign contracts without their husband’s permission. She challenged this law, essentially committing forgery. And, even though she committed a crime for the purpose of saving her husband’s life, her actions wound up destroying her marriage when someone tried to blackmail her.\n\npublished on 12/04/2018\n\nGooch & the Motion\n\nThis New Year’s Day will be 15 years to the day that Ryan Nelson’s life changed forever.
