        "text": "New prophecies convinced the first Mormons the end was near and as the Bible had predicted, an “overflowing scourge” of sickness and death was coming. One revelation penned by Joseph Smith, founder of Mormonism, called for elders to evangelize everywhere during this period of rising tribulation. Where they met rejection, they were to cast the dust of that home or town from their feet in a special ritual designed to absolve them of any burden of guilt should apocalyptic devastation befall the rejectors. Such apocalyptic intensity would not fully endure. Mormon leaders would eventually discontinue the feet-dusting ritual among a growing population of full-time missionaries. The decline in this missionary ritual corresponded with a profound missiological development in Mormonism, a shift from connecting mission with the end of the world to the connection of mission with personal salvation—or, put technically, a shift from an eschatological to a soteriological orientation. This essay charts the two-hundred-year development of Mormon missiology through the prism of the soteriological turn and argues this changing outlook explains how Mormons today have arrived at their approaches to mission.\n\nhe natural world was something that brought Joseph Smith closer to God and facilitated his reception of revelation. Natural surroundings led to questions that revelations answered, while also providing Joseph Smith with proof of God’s existence and helping him achieve a mindset where he could commune with God. In addition, nature became the backdrop for visions and spiritual impressions that were less uplifting and more instructive regarding danger or unease in the world. At other times, pondering the natural environment allowed Joseph Smith to receive inspiration about both the history and the potential of an area. Joseph Smith’s revelations could thus be spurred by the environment while also affecting how Smith and others regarded nature."
