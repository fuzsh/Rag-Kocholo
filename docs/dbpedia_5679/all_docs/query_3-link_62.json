Date- Printed Topic Quote RPR Comments <strong>1942</strong> 1/9/<strong>1942</strong> Schools & Forest, School CONSERVATION NOTES - SCHOOL FOREST \"Many schools now operate their own forests, offering both an educational and material contribution to the state welfare. Children plant the trees and in the care of the plots observe the intricate balance that is developed in a living forest. Some of these school forests have already made a substantial contribution in products. A child who, in a general way, understands the operation of a forest, has a sound foundation in conservation because Wisconsin is by nature a forest state and most conservation problems are forest connected.\" Page 1 of 176 This edition of the <strong>Herald</strong> continued with a column under the title \"Conservation Notes.\" It discussed the wisdom of municipalities having \"municipal forests\" and then went on to discuss \"brook adoption\": \"The availability of trees from the conservation department offers communities and people wide opportunities. At least some communities can probably adopt a nearby brook [creek], acquiring rights around the headwaters and for several miles along the street course. Such streams are apt to be cattle wallows throughout their length in the farming country now, but fenced and planted back to trees would be as nature intended them to be within a few years. Passageways for cattle and drinking places for the pastures would not detract from the development and would avoid any interference with farm economy. Such a development would be important from the standpoint of trout, game, song birds and the rarer types of native wild flowers.\""
