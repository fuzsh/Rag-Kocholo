They are not structured or in any specific order, but are provided in hopes that they may spur you on to begin to intercede daily for revival for yourself, your small group, your church, your nation, the world. We are experiencing a time of ever increasing spiritual darkness in America and are in great, grave need of a mighty move of God on our land. So Father we pray simply and yet sincerely \"Revive us according to Thy Word.\" (Psalm 119:25).\n\nNote: No attempt has been made to attribute these notes to specific sources (other than specific quotes, etc) as they were randomly accumulated over many years and there was never an intention to publish them any wider. So if you see something that you think should be credited to someone, please email me and they will be credited. Thank you.\n\nTozer said \"Revival will come when prayer is no longer used as a substitute for obedience.\" [1Sa15:22,23]\n\nThere will be No Revival\n\nwithout Rebible!\n\nLeonard Ravenhill \"In revival God is not concerned about filling empty churches, He is concerned about filling empty hearts.\"\n\nSend a revival, O Christ, my Lord,\n\nLet it go over the land and sea;\n\nSend it according to Thy dear Word,\n\nAnd let it begin in me.\n\n--McKinney\n\nLord, send a revival,\n\nand let it begin in me.\n\nO Lord, how we need a revival!\n\nPlease let it begin in me.\n\nO God, may I seek You and serve You\n\nWith love and humility.\n\n—Fitzhugh\n\nThe need of my heart is revival,\n\nMore trusting in God's precious Word,\n\nMore grace as I show forth His praises,\n\nAnd serve my adorable Lord.\n\n—Richie\n\nHere's a little survey:\n\n1). How many of you know we NEED a revival?\n\nAlmost everyone raises their hands here. The knowledge of this fact hardly takes scholarship or devotion.\n\n2). How many of you WANT a revival?\n\nAgain, a majority opinion in church groups. And in the 80's so did around 80% of the country according to George Gallup Jr. Even the lost know we need a revival!\n\n3). How many of you know WHAT a revival is?\n\nThe number drops off alarmingly now. Here is something we all want, we all know we need, but we don't have a clue what it is!\n\n4). How many of you have ever EXPERIENCED a real revival?\n\nAnd here, very few if any, ever respond. \"Another generation arose that did not know the mighty works of the Lord\". (Jdg 2:10-read comment)\n\nEVAN ROBERTS TESTIMONY--WELSH REVIVAL:\n\nThe seven o'clock meeting was devoted to asking and answering questions. Rev. W. W. Lewis conducted. At the close Rev. Seth Joshua prayed, and said during his prayer, 'Lord, do this, and this, and this, etc., and bend us.' He did not say, 'O Lord, bend us.' It was the Spirit that put the emphasis for me on 'Bend us.' 'That is what you need,' said the Spirit to me. And as I went out I prayed, 'O Lord, bend me.'\"On the way to the nine o'clock meeting Rev. Seth Joshua remarked, 'We are going to have a wonderful meeting today.' To this I replied, 'I feel myself almost bursting.'\" The meeting having been opened was handed over to the Spirit. I was conscious that I would have to pray. As one and the other prayed, I put the question to the Spirit, 'Shall I pray now?' 'Wait a while,' said He. When others prayed I felt a living force come into my bosom. I held my breath, and my legs shivered, and after every prayer I asked, 'Shall I now?' The living force grew and grew, and I was almost bursting. And instantly some one ended his prayer my bosom boiling. I would have burst if I had not prayed. What boiled me was that verse, 'God commending His love.' I fell on my knees with my arms over the seat in front of me, and the tears and perspiration flowed freely. I thought blood was gushing forth. For about two minutes it was fearful. I cried, 'Bend me! Bend me! Bend us! . . .' What bent me was God commending His love (Ro5:8), and I not seeing anything in it to commend. After I was bent a wave of peace came over me, and the audience sang, 'I hear thy welcome voice.' And as they sang I thought of the bending at the judgment Day, and I was filled with compassion forthose who would be bent on that day, and I wept.Henceforth the salvation of souls became the burden of my heart. From that time I was on fire with a desire to go through all Wales, and if it were possible I was willing to pay God to allow me to go. A plan was agreed upon, and eight of us were to go through Wales, and I was to pay all expenses.\"\n\nIn other parts of South Wales crowded and enthusiastic services are being held, and everywhere large numbers of inquirers are announced. At the Tabernacle in Cardiff a gang of gamblers has been broken up by the revival, and twelve of them have yielded to Christ. One of the Welsh hymns sung most fervently at all the services says -\n\nGone is the morn, it's getting late,\n\nBut open still is mercy's gate.\n\nAnd in at that gate hundreds are still flocking. A well-dressed shop assistant staggered to the front and asked a minister to pray for him. As soon as he found the Lord he got up and shouted out in Welsh, \"Is mother here?\" When he was told she was at the back of the chapel, he called out, \"Mother, I've had to give in at last. I tried to refuse, but I was compelled.\" And so the glorious work goes on.\n\nRelated Resources:\n\n10 Things You Should Know about the Welsh Revival - Sam Storms\n\n1904–1905 Welsh revival - Wikipedia\n\nThe Story of the Welsh Revival - Revival Library\n\nPASSAGES THAT MENTION REVIVE OR REVIVAL - Surprisingly, there are not that many occurrences in the Bible. Most are in Psalm 119 every verse dealing in some way with the Word of God.\n\nTHOUGHT - Do you think there is any association between personal revival and personal time in the pure milk of God's Word (1 Pe 2:2)? As you have surely surmised, that is a rhetorical question! Of course there is an association, and in fact they are intimately related - read especially Ps 119:25, Ps 119:50, Ps 119:93, Ps 119:107, Ps 119:149, Ps 119:154, Ps 119:156. If God seems distance and you feel dry in your spiritual life and are in need of the times of refreshing which come from the presence of the Lord (For ultimately His Presence is the essence of revival) then purpose in your heart over the next few days are weeks to meditate on (even memorize) the passages in Psalm 119 that link revival with intake of God's Word, beseeching God that from our \"innermost being will flow rivers of living water.’ (Jn 7:38). I'm not speaking of a \"second experience\" but a renewal of that first love exhilarating experience we all remember when we were first born again. (cf Rev 2:4-5), and then waiting on the Lord in humble expectation for Him to answer in His perfect timing and His good and acceptable and perfect will in Christ. God's will for our life is revival, because when we are spiritually revived, the aroma of Christ is bountiful and the Light of Jesus is clear and bright and the Father is glorified as Jesus alluded to in Matthew 5:16 \"Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father Who is in heaven.\" “Therefore repent (CONFESS ANY KNOWN SIN. SEPARATE FROM AND \"KILL\" ANY SECRET SIN, ANY \"PET\" SIN YOU HAVE BEEN \"TOYING\" WITH) and return, so that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord.\" (Acts 3:19+)\n\nEzra 9:8 But now for a brief moment grace has been shown from the LORD our God, to leave us an escaped remnant and to give us a peg in His holy place, that our God may enlighten our eyes and grant us a little reviving in our bondage. 9 “For we are slaves; yet in our bondage our God has not forsaken us, but has extended lovingkindness to us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us reviving to raise up the house of our God, to restore its ruins and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem.\n\nPsalms 69:32 The humble have seen it and are glad; You who seek God, let your heart revive.\n\nPsalms 71:20 You who have shown me many troubles and distresses Will revive me again, And will bring me up again from the depths of the earth.\n\nPsalms 80:18 Then we shall not turn back from You; Revive us, and we will call upon Your name.\n\nPsalms 85:6 Will You not Yourself revive us again, That Your people may rejoice in You?\n\nPsalms 119:25 Daleth.

In Your righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.\n\nIsaiah 57:15 For thus says the high and exalted One Who lives forever, whose name is Holy, “I dwell on a high and holy place, And also with the contrite and lowly of spirit In order to revive the spirit of the lowly And to revive the heart of the contrite.\n\nHosea 6:2 “He will revive us after two days; He will raise us up on the third day, That we may live before Him.\n\nHabakkuk 3:2 LORD, I have heard the report about You and I fear. O LORD, revive Your work in the midst of the years, In the midst of the years make it known; In wrath remember mercy.\n\nNOTE: Similar to preceding \"THOUGHT\"\n\nIN NEED OF REVIVAL? Most of us frequently are if we are being honest. When somebody told Billy Sunday that revivals weren’t necessary because they didn’t last, the evangelist replied, “A bath doesn’t last, but it’s good to have one occasionally.” So then, where do you think we could go to find the answer to the question of how we might experience revival? You might be surprised to discover that the best place is Psalm 119 which has more than 1/3 of all the uses of the word “revive” in the Bible.\n\nPs 119:25 My soul cleaves to the dust; Revive me according to Your word.\n\nPs 119:37 Turn away my eyes from looking at vanity, And revive me in Your ways.\n\nPs 119:40 Behold, I long for Your precepts; Revive me through Your righteousness.\n\nPs 119:50 This is my comfort in my affliction, That Your word has revived me.\n\nPs 119:88 Revive me according to Your lovingkindness, So that I may keep the testimony of Your mouth.\n\nPs 119:93 I will never forget Your precepts, For by them You have revived me.\n\nPs 119:107 I am exceedingly afflicted; Revive me, O LORD, according to Your word.\n\nPs 119:149 Hear my voice according to Your lovingkindness; Revive me, O LORD, according to Your ordinances.\n\nPs 119:154 Plead my cause and redeem me; Revive me according to Your word.\n\nPs 119:156 Great are Your mercies, O LORD; Revive me according to Your ordinances.\n\nPs 119:159 Consider how I love Your precepts; Revive me, O LORD, according to Your lovingkindness.\n\nAs you observe those passages, do you think there is any association between personal revival and personal time in the pure milk of God's Word (1 Pe 2:2)? As you have surmised, that is a rhetorical question! Of course there is an association, and in fact they are intimately related - read especially Ps 119:25, Ps 119:50, Ps 119:93, Ps 119:107, Ps 119:149, Ps 119:154, Ps 119:156. C H Spurgeon said \"If we want revival, we must revive our reverence for the Word of God.\"\n\nIf God seems distant and you feel dry in your spiritual life and are in need of the times of refreshing which come from the presence of the Lord (For ultimately His Presence is the essence of revival) then purpose in your heart (Da 1:8) over the next few days or weeks to meditate on (even memorize) the passages in Psalm 119 that link revival with intake of God's Word, beseeching God that from our \"innermost being will flow rivers of living water.’ (Jn 7:38). I am speaking of a renewal of that exhilarating experience when we first fell in love with Jesus when His Spirit birthed us into the Kingdom of God (cf Rev 2:4-5).\n\n“Therefore repent (Confess any known sin. Separate and “kill” any secret sin you have been trifling with) and return, so that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord.\" (Acts 3:19)\n\n\"Call to Me and I will answer you, and I will show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.’ (Jer 33:3) And then “wait for the LORD and you will gain (literally exchange your weakness for His strength – 2 Cor 12:9) new strength and will mount up with wings like eagles, will run and not get tired, and will walk and not become weary,” (Isa 40:31) “for thus says the high and exalted One Who lives forever, whose name is Holy, “I dwell on a high and holy place, And also with the contrite and lowly of spirit In order to revive the spirit of the lowly And to revive the heart of the contrite. (Isa 57:15)\n\nGod's will for our life is revival, for when we are spiritually revived, the aroma of Christ is evident (2 Cor 2:14-16) and the Light of Jesus (Jn 8:12) is clear and bright and the Father is glorified as Jesus called for in Matthew 5:16 \"Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify (give a proper opinion of) your Father Who is in heaven.\"\n\nAnd so we see that the \"secret\" to personal revival is simply to \"re-Bible!\" Let me suggest that instead of reading a larger portion of Scripture (as in most reading plans where too often it is in one ear and out the other), you take smaller \"bites\" of Scripture, giving yourself a chance to chew on the passages as you would a bite of select prime rib. And then you will be more likely to ponder that passage as you go throughout your day.\n\nSend a revival, O Christ, my Lord,\n\nLet it go over the land and sea;\n\nSend it according to Thy dear Word,\n\nAnd let it begin in me.\n\n-McKinney\n\nMay God \"revive His work in the midst of the years.\" (Hab 3:2) and may our prayer frequently be \"Revive me according to Your Word.\" (Ps 119:25) In Jesus' Name.

Such a revival is not a momentary outburst of excitement, not a temporary manipulated stir, not a mere reformation, but a real awakening, a profound and awful conviction of sin by the eternal Spirit of God. For such a revival we ought to pray w. our whole souls; pray like Jacob, till the day dawns and the blessing comes; pray like Elijah, till the answer by fire comes, till heaven is unlocked and pours out its treasures.'' E. M. Bounds\n\nSammy Tippitt - REVIVAL OF THE SOUL \"My soul cleaves to the dust; Revive me according to Thy word\" (Ps.119:25).\n\nThroughout the ages, the great revivals of Christianity have been directly related to the ministry of the Word of God. As wonderful as is music of praise, it will not produce a great spiritual or moral revival. It's pleasant to have creative means of worship in our churches and personal lives. However, there's no substitute for the ministry of the Scriptures. They have the ability to revive the weak and sickly saint. They turn the focus of the Christian away from defeat and point him to the victory of the conquering Christ. On many occasions in my personal walk with God, I've been discouraged and defeated. But I only have to be still and meditate on the Scriptures to discover the One who's able to revive the heavy heart. The Scriptures have the ability to shine forth the glory of God in places where His light has grown dim. Spiritual renewal comes to the individual, church, or community that is open to the light of God's Word.\n\nJohn Piper - Revival happens when we see God majestic in holiness, and when we see ourselves, disobedient dust. Brokenness, repentance, unspeakable joy of forgiveness, a \"taste for the magnificence of God,\" a hunger for his holiness -- to see it more and to live it more: that's revival. And it comes from seeing God. (Holy, Holy, Holy Is the Lord of Hosts)\n\nJohn Phillips on Ps 119:25 - \"My soul cleaveth unto the dust; quicken Thou me according to Thy word.\" We don't know what it was that so prostrated the psalmist before God. It may have been an overwhelming sense of his own guilt (guilt will do that). And that, after all, is the first function of God's Word-to expose guilt. The Holy Spirit's first work in the soul is to convict of sin, righteousness, and judgment to come.\n\nThere can be little doubt that the psalmist was in the grip of deep depression. He was flat on his face in the dust. He had come to the end of himself and his own resources.\n\nAt this point our society would advise us to see a psychiatrist, seek professional help. There may be times when a Christian psychologist can help, but that was not the solution the psalmist discovered.\n\nSometimes when people go to a psychiatrist, they are put into group therapy and encouraged to let it all \"hang out.\" They are to talk openly about their problems to others, who have problems too. Everybody comments on the problems, criticizing hangups, attitudes, personality traits, weaknesses, and shortcomings. All that is supposed to help.\n\nThe psalmist makes a different suggestion. He says to the Lord, \"Quicken Thou me.\" He was going to air his problems all right, but he was going to take them to the Lord. He was going to seek a counselor-the counsel of the Word of God. There are very few problems in this life that cannot be solved by a thorough-going, honest exposure of one's life to the Scriptures. To do that is the greatest therapy in the world.\n\nThe psalmist asked God to \"quicken him,\" that is, to put new life into him. What he needed was a stiff dose of Scripture, taken with a mixture of faith, every day. Try it. Read your Bible consistently. Say with Samuel, \"Speak, Lord, Thy servant heareth.\" The Bible is a book of people and principles. Sooner or later, God will confront us in the pages of His Book with the basic cause of our problem and with His inspired, infallible solution to that problem. The psalmist had discovered the best way of all to handle depression.\n\nBut we must be prepared. The Bible will not hedge or redefine sin. It will put its finger unerringly on the sin question, frequently at the root of other problems of life (Exploring Psalms)\n\nHerbert Lockyer - \"Quicken thou me according to thy word.\" Psalm 119:25\n\nHere the Psalmist is pleading the promise of revival. While the word \"quicken\" is used of life being given to the dead, it also implies God's power to raise up and cheer all who languish. And what is revival but God's quickening of His own! He finds them cleaving to the dust and touches them. As branches of the Vine, they trail on the ground where the sun, rain and air cannot benefit them. But when His Spirit is abroad in revival blessing, the trailing, dust-covered branches are raised to a trellis where, fully exposed to atmospheric conditions, they can become fruitful. Then it must not be forgotten that all revival comes through the medium of the Word. A revival that is not according to God's revealed will, is not a heaven-sent one. The Lord deliver us from a Bible-less, and therefore spurious, revival!\n\nOctavius Winslow - 3 devotionals on Psalm 119:25\n\n\"I lie in the dust, completely discouraged; revive me by your word.\" Psalm 119:25\n\nAh! how many whose eye scans this page may take up and breathe David's words. You feel a deadness, a dullness, and an earthliness in spiritual enjoyments, and duties, and privileges, in which your whole soul should be all life, all fervor, all love. You are low where you ought to be elevated; you grovel where you ought to soar; you cleave to the earth where you ought to be embracing the heavens. Your thoughts are low; your affections are low; your feelings are low; your spirits are low; and you seem almost ready to question the existence of the life of God in your soul.\n\nBut even in this sad and depressed state may there not be something cheering, encouraging, hopeful? There was evidently in David's–\"My soul cleaves unto the dust: quicken me.\" This was the cheering, encouraging, hopeful feature in the Psalmists's case–his breathing after the requickening of the Divine life of his soul. Here was that which marked him a man of God. It was a living man complaining of his deadness, and breathing after more life. It was a heaven-born soul lamenting its earthliness, and panting after more of heaven. It was a spiritual man mourning over his carnality, and praying for more spirituality. It is not the prayer of one conscious of the low state of His soul, and yet satisfied with that state.\n\n\"I lie in the dust, completely discouraged; revive me by your word.\" Perhaps no expression is more familiar to the ear, and no acknowledgment is more frequently on the lips of religious professors, than this. And yet where is the accompanying effort to rise above it? Where is the putting on of the armor? Where is the conflict? Where is the effort to emerge from the dust, to break away from the enthrallment, and soar into a higher and purer region? Alas! many from whose lips smoothly glides the humiliating confession still embrace the dust, and seem to love the dust, and never stretch their pinions to rise above it. But let us study closely this lesson of David's experience, that while deep lamentation filled his heart, and an honest confession breathed from his lips, there was also a breathing, a panting of soul, after a higher and a better state. He seemed to say–\"Lord, I am prostrate, but I long to rise; I am fettered, but I struggle to be free; my soul cleaves to the dust, but quicken me!\" Similar to this was the state of the Church, so graphically depicted by Solomon in his Song–\"I sleep, but my heart wakes.\"\n\nJULY 24. \"Revive me.\" Psalm 119:25\n\nThis prayer implies what, alas! is so needful in many, a revival of soul. It is a putting of the Lord's hand a second time to the work of grace in the heart. \"When you are converted,\" said our Lord to Peter, \"strengthen your brethren.\" What! had not Peter already been converted? Most truly. But; although a regenerate man, he had so relapsed in grace as to need a re-conversion. Our Lord's meaning, then, obviously is, \"When you are restored, recovered, re-quickened, then strengthen your brethren.\" How many religious professors stand in need of a fresh baptism (filling) of the Holy Spirit! You, perhaps, my reader, are one. Where is the spiritual vigor you once displayed? where the spiritual joy you once possessed? where the unclouded hope you once indulged? where the humble walk with God you once maintained? where the fragrance that once breathed around you? Alas! your soul cleaves to the dust; and you need the re-converting grace, the renewed baptism (filling) of the Spirit. \"Revive me\" is your prayer.\n\nA clearer manifestation of Divine life in the soul is not the least blessing contained in this prayer for quickening. How little realization enters into the religion of many! There is the full credence of the judgment to the truth; a conversing about religion, the ministry, and the Church. But where is felt the realizing power, the earth-fading, heaven-attracting power, of vital godliness into the soul? Dear reader, the hour that will bring your religious profession, your religious creed, your religious notions, to the test, is at hand; and the great question in that awful moment will be, \"Am I ready to die?–have I in my soul the life of God?–am I born of the Spirit?–have I a living Christ in my now failing, dying heart?\"\n\nBut what a prayer is this in view of a scene and a scrutiny so solemn: \"Revive me, Lord, quicken Your work in my soul, and strengthen that which You have wrought in me. The love that congeals, the faith that trembles, the hope that fluctuates, the joy that droops; inspire with new life, new energy, new power! It is of little moment what others think of me; Lord, You know my soul cleaves to the dust. There is in my heart more of earth than of heaven; more of self than of Christ; more of the creature than of God. You know me in secret–how my grace wanes, how my affections chill, how seldom my closet is visited, how much my Bible is neglected, how insipid to my taste the means of grace, and how irksome and vapid are all spiritual duties and privileges. Lord, stir up Yourself to the revivifying of my soul; quicken, oh, revive me in Your ways. Enlarge my heart, that I may run the way of Your commandments.\"\n\nJULY 25. \"I lie in the dust, completely discouraged; revive me by your word.\" Psalm 119:25\n\nThe argument with which this holy petition is urged is most powerful and prevalent. According to the promise of the word, and the instrumentality of the word. Both are engaged to quicken the soul. The promise is most precious: \"I will heal their backslidings, I will love them freely; for my anger is turned away from him. I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon. Those who dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine.\" This precious promise to quicken and revive you, to shed the dews of His grace upon your soul, thus moistening and nourishing the roots and fibers and fruits of the new and heavenly life within you, God stands ready to fulfill in your holy and happy experience. \"I will be to Israel like a refreshing dew from heaven. It will blossom like the lily; it will send roots deep into the soil like the cedars in Lebanon.\" Christ is our dew: the dew of His love, the dew of His grace, the dew of His Spirit, is prepared, silent and unseen, but effectual and vivifying–to fall upon the renewed powers of your nature–reviving the work of God in your soul.\n\nBut by the instrumentality of the word, the Lord quickens the soul. The word of Christ is \"spirit and life,\" therefore it is a quickening word. \"This is my comfort in my affliction; for Your word has quickened me.\" Again, \"I will never forget Your precepts; for with them You have quickened me.\" Therefore did Jesus pray to His Father in behalf of His Church, \"Sanctify them through Your truth.\" Thus does the word quicken. We are here constrained to suggest an inquiry–May not the prevalent decay of spiritual life in the Church of God–the low standard of spirituality–the alarming growth of soul-destroying error–the startling discovery which some modern teachers appear to have stumbled upon, that doctrines which the Church of Christ has always received as revealed truth, which councils have authorized, and which creeds have embodied, and which the sanctified intellects of master-spirits–the Anakims and the Shamgars of polemic divinity and divine philosophy of past ages–have contended for and maintained, are not found in the Bible, but are the visionary dogmata of a by-gone age–we say, may not these prevalent evils be mainly attributable to the contempt thrown upon the word of God? We verily and solemnly believe it to be so.\n\nWe need to be constantly reminded that the great regenerator and emancipator of the world is the Bible–that nothing short of this disturbs the spiritual death which universally prevails, and that nothing short of this will free the human mind from the shackles of error and superstition which enslave at this moment nearly two-thirds of the human race. This \"sword of the Spirit\"–like that of Goliath, \"there is none like it\"–has overcome popery and infidelity, and, unimpaired by the conflict, it is ready to overcome them yet again. Oh, that in this day of sad departure from the word of God, we may rally round the Bible in closer and more united phalanx! Firm in the belief of its divinity, strong in the conviction of its potency, may we go forth in the great conflict of truth and error, wielding no weapon but the \"sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.\" In all our spiritual relapses, too, may the word of the Lord quicken us. May it, like a mighty lever, raise our soul from the dust to which it so much cleaves.\n\nJames Smith - Often, very often, have we to cry out from bitter experience, \"My soul cleaves unto the dust; quicken me according unto Your Word!\" Psalm 119:25\n\n\"My soul cleaves unto the dust!\" Psalm 119:25\n\nHow common is this complaint of the true Christian!\n\nWhat is the world? DUST! Its pleasures, profits, employments, honors—all dust! That is, they are . . .\n\ncomparatively worthless,\n\nbeneath an immortal soul,\n\nunsuitable to a child of God. Yet . . .\n\nour thoughts are filled with them,\n\nour affections are entangled by them, and\n\nour graces are weakened through them.\n\nWorldlings are at home in the DUST—they appear to be satisfied with it!\n\nBut the Christian, when he cleaves to it most—is not at home, and cannot be satisfied with it. This is a mercy.\n\nMy soul, rouse yourself from your lethargy; arise and shake off the dust of the world—and put on your beautiful garments! It is beneath your dignity to lie there in the dust! Treat the things of time as they deserve!\n\nHeaven is your home!\n\nHoliness is your element!\n\nThe King of kings is your husband!\n\nGlory is your eternal portion!\n\nEarth is but a wilderness through which you have to pass; a lodging-place for a few days. \"Arise and depart—for this is not your rest, because it is polluted!\"\n\nQuickening Spirit, daily quicken my soul!\n\nJames Smith - \"Wilt Thou not revive us again?\" Ps. 85:6\n\n1. THE NEED OF REVIVAL. The need is apparent wherever there is Coldness, Languidness, and Fruitless-ness.\n\n2. THE SOURCE OF REVIVAL. \"Thou.\" It is God, the Spirit, that quickeneth. No artificial appliances will bring a revival in Nature.\n\n3. THE MEANS OF REVIVAL. \"Wilt Thou not?\" The fervent prayer of the righteous availeth much. James 5:17; Ps. 65:9; Isa. 40:28.\n\n4. THE SUBJECTS OF REVIVAL. \"Us.\" It is a personal need.\n\n5. THE EFFECT OF REVIVAL. \"That Thy people may rejoice in Thee.\"\n\nJohn Gill - O Lord, quicken me according to thy judgment; either according to his word of promise, or according to his manner and wonted method he used towards his people; see Ps 119:25; This is a prayer, not for the first work of quickening grace, or the first implantation of a principle of spiritual life, which the psalmist had had an experience of; but for the reviving of the work and principle in him, that he might be refreshed and comforted, and be animated and stirred up to a lively exercise of grace and performance of duty: finding himself in dead and lifeless frames, and not able to quicken himself.\n\nJ D Watson on Ps 119:25 - In the Psalms, especially 119, chāyāh is often rendered \"quicken\" or \"quickened\" in the AV. In Psalm 119:25, for example, David prays, \"Quicken thou me according to thy word.\" While some modern translations reflect the basic meanings \"live\" and \"be alive,\" as in \"preserve my life\" (NIV) and \"give me life\" (ESV), such renderings miss the true point. This word also speaks of reviving someone, as in reviving them from sickness or discouragement, and it is that idea in view in David's prayer. Only God can revive us from despair. It will not come from self-determination, will power, psychological technique, or clever cliché. It will come only from God's Word working in our heart and mind.\n\nC H Spurgeon on Ps 119:25. My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word.\n\n“I feel heavy, unhappy, dull: ‘My soul cleaveth unto the dust.’ Or I feel worldly, lethargic, lifeless: ‘My soul cleaveth unto the dust.’ There is nothing but the power of new life that can separate me from that dust: ‘ Quicken thou me according to thy word.’” Divine life is the great cure for most spiritual evils. When a man has vigorous life in his constitution, he throws off many diseases; and when the soul is full of spiritual life, it masters a great number of evils. “My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word.” That is good pleading, — “according to thy promise, for thou hast promised to quicken me. It is the nature of thy Word to be quick and quickening; therefore, Lord, ‘quicken thou me according to thy word.’”\n\nMy soul cleaveth unto the dust: “It sticks to it as though it were glued to it; my soul cannot be lifted up, at least by myself, out of its sadness, and its earthiness.” The psalmist was not one who could boast of perfection. He had to lament that the earth which was in him by nature, made even his soul cleave to mother earth. He did not like it; he was not content that it should be so, and therefore he breathed this prayer:— Quicken thou me according to thy word. “Lord, there is nothing but life that can bring me up out of the dust, for death lurks in the dust, and the dust tends to death. Put life into me, Lord; thy life, the divine life. Thou hast promised to do this; therefore, do it, Lord, ‘according to thy word.’ ” That is a prayer which is always sure to succeed, for it is based upon the promise of God. Hath the Lord promised anything? Then he will surely perform it; and you cannot use a better argument in prayer than to say to him, “Do as thou hast said;” or, as the psalmist puts it, “Quicken thou me according to thy word.”\n\nSpurgeon - REVIVAL—Absence and Presence of.\n\nThe decline of a revival is a great testing season. It discovers the true believers by chilling the false. A frosty night or two suffices to nip all the exotic plants of a garden; but the hardy shrubs, the true natives of the soil, live on even in the severest cold. Converts raised in the hot-bed of excitement soon droop and die if the spiritual temperature of the church falls below summer heat: what are these worth compared with the hardy children of divine grace, whose inward life will continue in enduring vigour when all around is dead! Yet we do not desire to see the revival spirit droop among us, for even the evergreens of our garden delight in a warmer season, for then they send forth their shoots and clothe themselves with new leaves; and thus it will be seen that the best of the saints are all the better for the holy glow of the \"times of refreshing.\"\n\nREVIVAL the Holy Spirit\n\nTo raise a revival by suppressing truth, is dealing deceitfully; it is a pious fraud, and our Lord wants no profit which might be supposed to come by such a transaction.\n\nPerhaps we imagine that if we could only get up a revival, we should easily secure large additions to the church? Is it worthwhile to get up a revival? Are not all true revivals to be got down?\n\nRevivals, if they are genuine, do not always come the moment we whistle for them. Try and whistle for the wind, and see if it will come.\n\nNow one sign of a true revival, and indeed an essential part of it, is the increased activity of God’s labourers.\n\n“The wind bloweth where it listeth,” is a truth well calculated to hide pride from man.\n\nThat was a very good remark from Dr. McDonald, the apostle of the North. He said, in reference to his experience of revivals, that the real success, he always found, was in inverse proportion to the excitement; that is to say, that the more permanent the revival was the less of noise there was about it, and the more there was of mere carnal stir, the less there was of God and his grace.\n\n“Lord, if this is our work, end it; if it is man’s work, break it down; but if it be thy work, revive it.”\n\nJ VERNON McGEE: My friend, let’s be very candid and very matter-of-fact and very direct. I believe we could have a revival today, but first there must be a return to the Word of God to find out what God wants us to do. Then I believe there will be and there must be a total commitment to God on the part of God’s people (ED: THIS COMES ABOUT BY DEPENDENCE ON THE SPIRIT OF GOD TO PROVIDE THE DESIRE AND THE POWER FOR THIS KIND OF COMMITMENT! Php 2:13NLT+). There can be none of this half-hearted service which we see. There can be none of this business of trying to go with the world and trying to go with God (cf Mt 6:24+, 1 Ki 18:21). It is impossible to do both. There must be a clear-cut dedication of heart and life to God. When that takes place, the Spirit of God is free to move.\n\nRobert Morgan - What do I mean by revival? I’m not talking about a week of meetings in a local church. The term “revival” refers to a special movement of God in which His church is dramatically refocused and revitalized, with ensuing conviction and conversion among sinners.\n\nBible scholars tell us there are sixteen different revivals described for us in the Bible, and the greatest book in the Bible on the subject of revival is 2 Chronicles. This Old Testament record gives us the biblical formula for revival, and then describes for us five different revivals under five different Old Testament kings. The formula for revival is found in the words spoken by the Lord on the occasion of the dedication of the long-anticipated Temple. In the first part of chapter 7, Solomon and all of Israel dedicated this imposing edifice, and the last half of the chapter records God’s response:\n\nIf my people who are called by My Name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and heal their land.\n\nThe rest of 2 Chronicles illustrates this for us by describing a series of five revivals that swept over the nation of Judah. We don’t have time to look at all five revivals this morning, but I’d like to briefly glance at the fifth and final revival, one that occurred under King Josiah in 2 Chronicles 34-35. Because of time, we’ll just look at chapter 34, and leave the rest of the story for our more extended study next year. The story begins in 2 Chronicles, chapter 34, and we notice the first characteristic of biblical revivals: Biblical Revivals Come Just in the Nick of Time.

Evangelist Sammy Tippit has preached throughout Eastern Europe, including Russia and has seen thousands of people in those countries find peace in Jesus Christ, despite persecution, oppression, and dwindling educational and job opportunities. Spiritual awakening has touched millions in Africa, South America, Korea, and Eastern Europe. Why, then, have Western Christians, the people who worked so hard to send Christianity eastward, become lukewarm? How can we regain the passion we once felt? Fire in Your Heart will gently show you the way to personal revival, using Scripture, history, and the experiences of men and women from communist Eastern Europe.

You will come to think less of the speaker and more of the truth spoken… Let God but send down the fire, and the biggest sinners in the neighborhood will be converted; those who live in the dens of infamy will be changed; the drunkard will forsake his cups, the swearer will repent of his blasphemy, the debauched will leave their lusts- Dry bones be raised and clothed afresh, And hearts of stone be turned to flesh.--Charles H.

There were remarkable tokens of God's presence in almost every house…God's day was a delight. The congregation was alive in God's service, in tears while the Word was preached; some weeping for sorrow and distress, others for joy and love, others with pity and concern for the souls of their neighbors. --Jonathan Edwards...\n\nChapter 2 - Continued\n\nChapter 2 - Conclusion\n\nChapter 3 - The Secret of Prayer\n\nChapter 3 - Continued\n\nChapter 3 - Continued\n\nChapter 3 - Continued\n\nChapter 4 - Power for Witnessing\n\nAnd oh, how I loved my Savior Christ then!

But when he is turned to the Lord by evangelical repentance, then his will is changed; then his conscience, now hardened and benumbed, shall be quickened and weakened; then his hard heart shall be melted, and his unruly affections shall be crucified.

Moths could not corrupt this God-given robe. He never fished for praise with humility's bait, but in the long line of sinners put himself first (where we would have put him last). What a heart's ease is the virtue of humility - the great joy of having nothing to lose! Having no opinion of himself, Paul feared no fall. He might have swaggered in the richly embroidered robes of the chancellor of a Hebrew school. But in the adornment of a meek and quiet spirit, he shines with more luster. Leonard Ravenhill\n\nLet every day be a day of humility; condescend to all the weaknesses and infirmities of your fellow creatures, cover their frailties, love their excellencies, encourage their virtues, relieve their wants, rejoice in their prosperities, compassionate their distress, receive their friendship, overlook their kindness, forgive their malice, be a servant of servants, and condescend to do the lowliest offices of the lowliest of mankind.

After this, he was chained to the stake, and repeating the 51st Psalm, and crying to God, \"Merciful Father, for Jesus Christ's sake, receive my soul into Thy hands,\" stood quietly amidst the flames without crying or moving, till one of the guards dashed out his brains with a halberd.

Ritual and dogma may have their place, but if the individual life does not manifest itself in bringing glory to God and eternal blessing into the lives of sinful men, they are clouds without water. Hezekiah's revival work was the outcome of his own faith in the Living God— the faith which works by love. We shall try and find some helpful lessons here. We observe some—\n\nI. Evidences that a Revival was Needed.\n\n1. Holy Things are Cut in Pieces. \"Ahaz... cut in pieces the vessels of the House of God\" (chapter 28:24). These sacred things which had been so useful in the House and service of God became the objects of the wrath and hatred of those who despised Him, whose instruments they were. All those who are seeking to cast discredit upon the books of the Bible are, in their own way, attempting to \"cut in pieces the vessels of the House of God.\" These sixty-six books, which compose the Bible, are so many vessels needed in the House of God for the work of the ministry. Every servant of God is also a vessel in His House, and the ungodly still try, with the sharp tongue of scorn and calumny, to cut their testimony in pieces.\n\n2. The Way of Access is Closed. \"He shut up the doors of the House of the Lord\" (v. 24). It is surely a sign that a revival is needed when men seek to block the way of others from worshiping God. Ahaz denied Jehovah, then sought to shut others out from the acknowledging of Him as God. There are doors in the temple of every man's heart that may be closed to his own loss and destruction. The door of communion with God may be shut by our love of, and delight in, the things which He hates. Our own unfitness is as a self-closed door. The door of Divine love and light may be closed by our own pride and prejudice. The door of faith and prayer is shut up by the unbelief of our own hearts.\n\n3. The Light of Testimony is Quenched. \"They put out the lamps\" (chapter 29:7). The lamps of God, aflame with the holy oil, became unbearable to those who loved the darkness of falsehood rather than the light of truth. The Christian's testimony for God is as a flame kindled and sustained by the oil of the Holy Spirit. When this is \"put out,\" it is an insult to God and a grieving of that Spirit, whose character and mission is to make us as a flame of fire. It was a sad experience the foolish virgins had when their lamps went out. It is even the work of the world, the flesh, and the devil to put out the lamp of truth, and to quench the light of testimony, that the darkness of death and desertion may settle down in the House (Church) of God.\n\n4. The Offering of Incense is Given Up. \"They have not burned incense\" (v. 7). When the lamp of testimony has been put out, the offering up of the incense of prayer and adoration will speedily cease. These two are vitally connected—they live or die together. Testimony for God will be but as sounding brass and tinkling cymbals where the sweet incense of believing prayer is awanting.\n\n5. There is a General Departing from the Worship of God. \"Out fathers have forsaken Him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the Lord, and turned their backs\" (v. 6). There is great need for a revival when the multitude turn their backs upon the House of God. Of course we do not wonder at many turning away their faces from God's House when the doors are shut up and the lamps out. Polished stones, carved wood, and all sorts of material finery have no attractions for a soul hungering for the Bread of Life. But there are many who turn their backs upon God's provision because they prefer the broken cisterns of their own hewing. To turn the back on God is to turn the face to destruction.\n\nII. Evidences that a Revival had Come. There was—\n\n1. A Personal Consecration. \"Hezekiah did that which was right in the sight of the Lord\" (chapter 29:2). He began by getting himself put right in the eyes of the Lord. It is one thing to pray for a revival, it is quite another to yield ourselves definitely to God, that His will and work may be done in us and by us. A coming shower of blessing is sure to be heralded by drops falling on some individual soul. Seek to be that soul by personal consecration.\n\n2. The Opening of Closed Doors. \"He opened the doors of the House of the Lord\" (v. 3). Every avenue of the soul that has been closed through indifference and unbelief will be immediately thrown open, and the light of God's truth will have free access to the heart, which should be the House of the Lord. \"Clear the darkened windows, and let the blessed sunshine in.\" All revival comes from the presence of the Lord, who waits outside the closed door, saying, \"Behold, I stand at the door and knock, if any man hear, and open, I will come in.\"\n\n3. A Casting Out of the Unclean. \"Sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house... and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place\" (v. 5). \"And the priests went into the inner part, and brought out all the impurity\" (v. 16). It is an unmistakable evidence that the power of God's Spirit is moving mightily when His servants take to the work of cleansing the inner part. Out of the heart are the issues of life. If God the Spirit is to dwell in us, the inner sanctuary of the life must be purged of all that is unfitting in His presence. The common Levites had no power to deal with those abominations that were in the inner parts of the temple, the priests had to go in and bring them out to the court, before the Levites could remove them (v. 16). There are evils and hindrances to the work and worship of God that can be seen and dealt with only by those who have had the anointing of the Holy Spirit. Others, like the Levites, may see the sinfulness of certain things, when they have been pointed out, and put them away. \"Cleanse You me from secret faults\" (Psalm 19:12).\n\n4. Realization of their True Position before God. \"The Lord has chosen you to stand before Him, to minister unto Him, and that you should be His ministers, and burn incense\" (v. 11, R.V.). A revolution is certain when God's people realize their true relationship to Him as chosen ones.\n\n(1) They are chosen by the Lord—called by His grace.\n\n(2) They are chosen to stand before Him—to wait before Him, and to receive His Word.\n\n(3) Chosen to minister unto Him—to do all in His Name and for His glory. \"You are not your own.\"\n\n(4) Chosen to be His ministers—to carry His Word and will to others.\n\n(5) Chosen to burn incense—to offer unto God the sweet incense of intercessory prayer. You know your calling, brethren; are you walking worthy of it?\n\nOBEDIENCE (ENABLED BY THE HOLY SPIRIT - see Php 2:12+ = our responsibility and Php 2:13NLT+ = God's provision of desire and power) IS DOING EXACTLY\n\nwhat I'm told to do,\n\nwhen I am told to do it\n\nwith the right heart attitude.\n\nThe first time God prompts your heart & you refuse to obey, your revived life begins to dry up. Beware!\n\nTo delay is to disobey.\n\nTo maintain the fire of revival in your heart, you must be committed to absolute obedience (in continual reliance on the Spirit indicating our continual need to be filled with the Holy Spirit - Eph 5:18+)\n\nThe closer you are to God, the faster you will obey.\n\nAs you read this note, is God prompting your heart to take a step of obedience regarding which you are hesitating and even about to put off? Beware! Read Jesus' warning...\n\nRevelation 2:4-5+ But I have this against you, that you have left your first love. Therefore remember (present imperative) from where you have fallen, and repent (aorist imperative) and do (aorist imperative) the deeds you did at first; or else I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place–unless you repent. (WHAT CALL IS REPEATED?)\n\nComment - Note the three commands. In our own strength we cannot obey Jesus' call for personal revival (remembering, repenting, doing) unless we rely on the Holy Spirit. See discussion of the Need for the Holy Spirit to obey NT commands\n\nREVIVAL DOES NOT BEGIN IN A THEOLOGY. IT BEGINS IN A THEOPHANY.\n\nTo renew your love for Christ,\n\nreview Christ's love for you.\n\nWe need revival ...\n\n- when we do not love Him as we once did.\n\n- when earthly interests and occupations are more important to us than eternal ones.\n\n- when we would rather watch TV and read secular books and magazines than read the Bible and pray.\n\n- when church dinners are better attended than prayer meetings.\n\n- when we have little or no desire to pray.\n\n- when we put people into leadership positions in our churches who do not meet scriptural qualifications.\n\n- when our Christianity is joyless and passionless.\n\n- when we know truth in our heads that we are not practicing in our lives.\n\n- when we make little effort to witness to the lost.\n\n- when we have time for sports, recreation, and entertainment, but not for Bible study and prayer.\n\n- when we do not tremble at the Word of God.\n\n- when we seldom think thoughts of eternity.\n\n- when God's people are more concerned about their jobs and their careers, than about the Kingdom of God.\n\n- when our church services are predictable and \"business as usual.\"\n\n- when believers can be at odds with each other and not feel compelled to pursue reconciliation.\n\n- when Christian husbands and wives are not praying together.\n\n- when our marriages are co-existing rather than full of the love of Christ.\n\n- when our children are growing up to adopt worldly values, secular philosophies and ungodly lifestyles.\n\n- when we are more concerned about our children's education, and their athletic activities than about the condition of their souls.\n\n- when sin in the church is pushed under the carpet.\n\n- when known sin is not dealt with through the Biblical process of discipline and restoration.\n\n- when we tolerate \"little\" sins of gossip, a critical spirit and lack of love.\n\n- when we watch things on television and movies that are not holy.\n\n- when our singing is half-hearted and our worship lifeless.\n\n- when our prayers lack fervency.\n\n- when our hearts are cold and our eyes are dry.\n\n- when we aren't seeing regular evidence of the supernatural power of God.\n\n- when we have ceased to weep and mourn and grieve over our own sin and the sins of others.\n\n- when we are bored with worship.\n\n- when we have to be entertained to be drawn to church.\n\n- when we don't long for the company and fellowship of God's people.\n\n- when our giving is measured and calculated, rather than extravagant and sacrificial.\n\n- when we are not seeing lost people drawn to Jesus on a regular basis.\n\n- when we aren't exercising faith and believing God for the impossible.\n\n- when we are more concerned about what others think about us than what God thinks about us.\n\n- when we are unmoved by the thought of neighbors, business associated and acquaintances who are lost and without Christ.\n\n- when the lost world around us doesn't know or care that we exist.\n\n- when we are making little or no difference in the secular world around us.\n\n- when the fire has gone out in our hearts, our marriages and the church.\n\n- when we are blind to the extent of our need and don't think we need revival.\n\nThe fact that the blessings didn’t last is no argument against times of revival and refreshing. When somebody told Billy Sunday that revivals weren’t necessary because they didn’t last, the evangelist replied, “A bath doesn’t last, but it’s good to have one occasionally.” A nation that is built on spiritual and moral principles must have frequent times of renewal or the foundations will crumble.\n\nThe response of worship is expressed as AN INNER ATTITUDE, a willingness to serve, to obey, like Paul when he was arrested by Christ on the Damascus Road (on his way to arrest Christians) who exclaimed \"And I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?...'' (ACTS 22:10). That's the natural response of falling down before the Lord Jesus Christ. REVIVAL is more than entertainment. REVIVAL is when you come into a fresh awareness of Who God is and there is a freshness of your SURRENDER to Him. It's not seeing people getting saved. People getting saved is the result of REVIVED Christians. A man does not come into the church and motivate people to serve if they have not recognized Who He is and have fallen down before Him. We do ''church'' really well, but TRUE CHRISTIANITY is a foreign language to us. Christianity is much more than what you do in a building. Christianity is an ATTITUDE towards God that so overwhelms you that His word dictates to you your whole pattern of behavior. from latrís (n.f.), one hired. To serve, in a religious sense to worship God (Mt 4:10; Lu 1:74}\n\nJonah records the account of the greatest revival of history.Nineveh's Revival was short-lived not necessarily because of the insincerity of the people, but because they failed to pass on their new found knowledge of God and it only took 150 years for that to happen!!! America is a little over 250 years old and the same thing is occurring here.!\n\nNo awakening or revival of the church has ever occurred apart from strong preaching of God’s holiness and the corresponding call for believers to forsake sin and return to the Lord’s standards of purity and righteousness. No church that tolerates known sin in its membership will have spiritual growth or effective evangelism. In spite of that truth, however, such tolerance is standard in the church today-at all levels.\n\nWelsh Revival of 1904 -- In an eyewitness report of the great Welsh revival of 1904, G. Campbell Morgan wrote, “The horses are terribly puzzled. A manager said to me. ‘The haulers are some of the very lowest. They have driven their horses by obscenity and kicks. Now they can hardly persuade the horses to start working, because there is no obscenity and no kicks.’”\n\nHugh Thomsen Kerr put the emphasis correctly: “We are not to preach sociology, but salvation; not economics, but evangelism; not reform, but redemption; not culture, but conversion; not progress, but pardon; not a new social order, but a new birth; not revolution, but regeneration; not renovation, but revival; not resuscitation, but resurrection; not a new organization, but a new creation; not democracy, but the Gospel; not civilization, but Christ; we are ambassadors, not diplomats.”\n\nIt is impressive that Epaphras prayed for believers in three different cities. We are fortunate today if church members pray for their own pastor and church, let alone believers in other places! Perhaps one reason that revival tarries is because we do not pray fervently for one another.\n\nIt is one thing to learn the Truth about personal revival and victorious living but it is quite another to take up our cross daily and walk the narrow road of renunciation of the old self, the old Adam that screams out for satisfaction by the passing pleasures of this world (Heb 11:25, 1 Jn 2:17).\n\nTOZER: \"all of us who love our Lord Jesus Christ are facing such great changes in this period before the return of Christ that we are going to have to recall and have back upon us the kind of spiritual revival that will eventuate in a new moral power, in a new spirit of willing separation and heart purity, and a new bestowing of the enablings of the Spirit of God.\"\n\nWhen F. B. Meyer was pastoring Christ Church in London, Charles Spurgeon was preaching at Metropolitan Tabernacle, and G. Campbell Morgan was at Westminster Chapel. Meyer said, “I find in my own ministry that supposing I pray for my own little flock, ‘God bless me, God fill my pews, God send my a revival,” I miss the blessing; but as I pray for my big brother, Mr. Spurgeon, on the right-hand side of my church, ‘God bless him’; or my other big brother, Campbell Morgan, on the other side of my church, ‘God bless him’; I am sure to get a blessing without praying for it, for the overflow of their cups fills my little bucket.”\n\nIn 1746, about six years after the Great Awakening, in which Jonathan Edwards was the primary instrument of God to preach the Gospel and bring about the greatest revival in American history thus far, Edwards wrote A Treatise Concerning the Religious Affections. He wrote it to deal with a problem not unlike one we face today: the matter of evidence for true conversion. Many people want the blessings of salvation, especially eternal security, but no more. In the explosive drama of the Great Awakening, it seemed as though conversions were occurring in great numbers. However, it didn’t take long to realize that some people claimed conversions that were not real. While various excesses and heightened emotional experiences were common, scores of people didn’t demonstrate any evidence in their lives to verify their claim to know and love Jesus Christ, which led critics to attack the Great Awakening, contending it was nothing but a big emotional bath without any true conversions.\n\nAs the Puritans used to say, \"There is much insensibility to divine things among Christians.\" This is why we need revival. And this is what revival is. Revival is not first the conversion of the lost. Revival is first the answer to Paul's prayer in 2Th3:5, \"May the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God.\" When the Lord takes hold of the hearts of his people and directs them into the love of God, they experience the outpouring of the love of God through the Holy Spirit. When that happens to lots of people in the same place at the same time, we call it revival.\n\nThe well-known Greek scholar Frederic Godet called Romans \"the cathedral of the Christian faith\" and wrote \"the Reformation was undoubtedly the work of the Epistle to the Romans…and the probability is that every great spiritual revival in the church will be connected as effect and cause with a deeper understanding of this book.\" ne cannot say what might happen if Christians undertake an intensive study of this epistle. What happened to Augustine, Luther, Calvin, and Wesley, which left a mark on the world, could happen to us today. So, let the reader beware. Do not begin a serious study of this epistle unless you are willing to bear the consequences.\n\nRevival Quotes - from Complete Gathered Gold - highly recommended resources (digital versions are available from Logos and Wordsearch)\n\nI believe nothing so distinctly causes the people of God in any generation to ‘stand in awe’ as when they hear of the great works of God in awakening his people powerfully.

And all the people entered into the covenant.\n\nParallel passage - 2 Chronicles 34:33 And Josiah removed all the abominations from all the lands belonging to the sons of Israel, and made all who were present in Israel to serve the Lord their God. Throughout his lifetime they did not turn from following the Lord God of their fathers.\n\nWhen Josiah died it appears that evil rose up again and the so-called \"revival\" (more accurately \"reformation\") also died. 2Ch 34:33 supports this conclusion of reformation but not true revival. ''All\" the Israelites had been on this road before but in both cases when the ''leader'' (Moses, Joshua) died & was \"out of sight\", their promise to God were \"out of mind\" & they broke the solemn oath they had made! (Ex 19:8 Jos 24:21-24).\n\nTrue God breathed REVIVAL is a special season of heart searching when many believers simultaneously experience a deep, Holy Spirit conviction of sin. It results in their confession and renunciation of sin (sometimes publicly). It culminates in a renewal of their dedication to the Lord. And the whole experience often bears fruit in the salvation of sinners. Even though great spiritual awakenings have occurred from time to time, they have not come in fulfillment of any Bible promise relating to them. There is no \"revival formula\" prescribed for us in the Scriptures. In fact, you will not find the word revival anywhere in the New Testament. Even though revivals are a historical reality,they are not a biblical certainty. Revival is not the calculated result of bringing into play a combination of religious exercises. Instead, it is a blessing that the God of grace, in keeping with His all-wise purposes, may send upon believers in times of deep spiritual need. But it cannot hurt to cry out \"Oh God send a Christ exalting, Word centered, Spirit empowered revival to America, in Jesus' Name.

Yet the Passover had been ordained by God as an everlasting ordinance to be kept each year for a memorial, to keep alive the memory of the divine deliverance (Ex 12:24-27). Whether Israel's neglect of the Passover was a cause or an effect of their recurring national apostasy, it certainly highlighted it, illustrating the vital importance of keeping alive the true understanding of our origins, whether of the world as a whole (Ex 20:8-11) or of one's nation and family. It is possible, however, that the Passover custom had been retained as a ritualistic observance of tradition, even if its spiritual significance had been forgotten. When the rediscovered Scriptures (2 Ki 22:8 KING JOSIAH'S REIGN) were found to describe its origin and meaning, the result was a true Passover celebration.\n\nW A Criswell commenting on 2 Chr 29:1-3 says that the events in Hezekiah's day mark \"the beginning of the most extended account of any revival in biblical history (2 Chr 29:1-31:21 - See Our Daily Bread Devotional - Continuing To Trust), with the exception of the one which started on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2). Periods of repentance and revival were numerous in the times of the judges (Jdg. 2:16). There were numerous other occasions of large-scale revivals described in the O.T., including the revival at Mount Sinai under Moses (Ex 32-34), at Mizpah under Samuel (1 Sa 7:1ff), on Mount Carmel under Elijah (1 Ki 19:1ff), in Judah under Asa (2 Chr. 15:1ff), in Nineveh under Jonah (Jon. 3:1ff), in Judah under young King Josiah (2 Chr. 34; 35), and the postexilic revival under Ezra and Nehemiah (Ezra 9; 10; Neh. 8-10).\" (Believer's Study Bible)\n\nLeonard Ravenhill, “There are three persons living in each of us: the one we think we are, the one other people think we are, and the one God knows we are.....“The Church right now has more fashion than passion, is more pathetic than prophetic, is more superficial than supernatural....The Gospel is not an old, old story, freshly told. It is a fire in the Spirit, fed by the flame of Immortal Love; and woe unto us, if, through our negligence to stir up the Gift of God which is within us, that fire burns low.” (Why Revival Tarries)\n\nRelated Resources:\n\nThe Price of Revival by Leonard Ravenhill - 1 hr 21 minutes audio\n\nRevival Forum Interview by Leonard Ravenhill - 58 min audio\n\nSix characteristics of worship among those who have experienced revival:\n\n1). A FRESH KNOWLEDGE OF GOD, and the revived need an expression of worship for the true and living God. Handel wrote Messiah in 24 days w/o leaving his house, even his food often being untouched. Once his servant found him weeping as he wrote ''Hallelujah Chorus''. Handel cried ''I did think I did see all Heaven before me, and the great God Himself!''\n\n2). THE ONLY MOTIVE OF TRUE WORSHIP IS THE GLORY OF GOD. When revival comes, there is but one purpose in our music: the promotion of the glory of God.\n\n3). KEEN AWARENESS THAT GOD HIMSELF IS THE CHIEF AUDIENCE OF OUR WORSHIP. In a church that has experienced awakening, many times the congregation sings w/o hymnbooks. They are not caught up w. the intricacy of their music but w. the simplicity of its message. They lift their heads and bellow their songs toward heaven. It becomes clear to Whom they are singing. Music is a vehicle that transports what is on the heart of man to the throne of God.\n\n4). PARTICIPATION-ORIENTED RATHER THAN PERFORMANCE-ORIENTED: True worship is always a people's movement.\n\n5). THE WORSHIP IS HAMMERED OUT OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE: when God is truly your Hiding Place when you are afraid, our song has a different ring to it and is an expression of what we have experienced of Him and His sufficiency. ''Because Handel lived fully w. his heart, his suffering was deep, but out of it came his great music.'' H.G. Spafford's family (except his wife) went down w. a French steamer and he wrote ''When peace, like a river, attendeth my way, When sorrows like sea bilows roll; whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say, it is well, it is well with my soul.''\n\n6). THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC WORSHIP IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE QUALITY OF OUR PRIVATE WORSHIP: revival grows out of hearts that seek God and when those hearts find God, there is a joy explosion and a new song reigns. The fruit of the awakened church is her worship of the true and living God, in Spirit and in Truth, truth that God Himself is the object of our worship.\n\nThe purpose of Christian music is NOT entertainment but WORSHIP. True worship will bypass neither the intellect nor the will. True worship involves MIND, WILL, and EMOTIONS. We need to be like Handel when the Messiah was first performed in Dublin in 1742. A nobleman complimented the composer on the great entertainment of the Messiah. Handel replied,''My Lord, I should be sorry if I only entertained them. I wished to make them better.''\n\nWe could experience one of the greatest revivals of all time if we would learn to worship bc it is for that purpose we were created.\n\nVance Havner defined REVIVAL as \"a work of God's Spirit among His own people...what we call revival is simply New Testament Christianity, the saints getting back to normal!''\n\nMartyn Lloyd-Jones - \"The essence of revival is that the Holy Spirit comes down upon a number of people together; upon a whole church, a number of churches, districts or perhaps a whole country. It is a visitation or outpouring of the Holy Spirit - God has come down among them.\"\n\nTrue revival is marked by powerful and often widespread outpourings of the Spirit. Many times preaching has to cease because the hearers were prostrate or because the voice of the preacher was drowned by cries for mercy. \"The Holy Spirit FELL ON all them which heard the Word.\" (Acts 10:44)\n\nJonathan Edwards son-in-law David Brainherd who prayed in the snow until it melted around him and was stained by his blood as he coughed away his life with T.B. prevailed in prayer for revival among the American Indians. Before he died he describes in his journal how it finally began in 1745:\n\n\"The power of God seemed to descend on the assembly 'like a rushing mighty wind' and with an astonishing energy bore all down before it. I stood amazed at the influence that seized the audience almost universally and could compare it to nothing more aptly than the irresistible force of a mighty torrent . . . Almost all persons of all ages were bowed down with concern together and scarce one was able to withstand the shock of the astonishing operation.\"\n\nBrian Edwards - Someone has described revival as 'the top blowing off' and that is very true. But the top does not blow off before the bottom has fallen out.\" (Revival: A People Saturated With God p.130)\n\nArthur Wallis in his classic study \"In The Day Of Thy Power\" points out the word is determined by its usage. It had historical consistency of meaning up until recent years, where (especially in America) it began to take on a lesser, more limited sense.Nevertheless, he says:\n\n\"Numerous writings on the subject preserved confirm that revival is Divine intervention in the normal course of spiritual things. It is God revealing Himself to man in aweful holiness and irresistible power. It is such a manifest working of God that human personalities are overshadowed and human programmes abandoned. It is man retiring into the background because God has taken the field. It is the Lord...working in extraordinary power on saint and sinner.\"\n\nJ. Edwin Orr, a prolific writer and eminent authority of both scholarship and experience in the subject defined a spiritual awakening as \"a movement of the Holy Spirit bringing about a revival of New Testament Christianity in the Church of Christ and its related community.\" It may significantly change an individual, a group of believers, a congregation, a city, a country or even eventually the world but it accomplishes \"the reviving of the Church, the awakening of the masses and the movement of uninstructed peoples towards the Christian faith; the revived church by many or few is moved to engage in evangelism, teaching and social action.\"\n\nA.W. Tozer defined revival as that which \"changes the moral climate of a community.\"\n\nRevival is essentially manifestation of God; it has the stamp of Deity on it which even the unregenerate and uninitiated are quick to recognize. Duncan Campbell described it as a \"community saturated with God.\" Revival must of necessity make an impact on the community and this is one means by which we may distinguish it from the more usual operations of the Holy Spirit.\" (Wallis,op. cit.) John Dawson points out that the community of the twentieth century is different from that of previous ages; modern communities are \"linked vocational villages of communication\" not necessarily geographically connected. A revival in the 18th Century affected your neighbor who probably lived next door; a revival that affects your neighbor in the Twentieth Century may touch neighbors in touch with you who live hundreds or even thousands of miles away, and are linked not by geographic location but by common vocation and communication. Revival is what the church first experiences; evangelism is then what she engages in. Revival is periodic; evangelism is continuous. Revival cannot last; evangelism must not stop. Do we want a revival? Do we really? James Burns writing in \"Revival, Their Laws and Leaders\" said in 1909: \"To the church, a revival means humiliation, a bitter knowledge of unworthiness and an open and humiliating confession of sin on the part of her minsters and people. It is not the easy and glorious thing many think it to be, who imagine it fills pews and reinstates the church in power and authority. \"It comes to scorch before it heals; it comes to condemn ministers and people for their unfaithful witness, for their selfish living, for their neglect of the cross, and to call them to daily renunciation, to an evangelical poverty and to a deep and daily consecration. That is why a revival has ever been unpopular with large numbers within the church. Because it says nothing to them of power such as they have learned to love, or of ease, or of success; it accuses them of sin, it tells them they are dead, it calls them to awake, to renounce the world and to follow Christ.\"\n\n\"The inevitable and constant preliminary to revival has always been a thirst for God, a thirst, a living thirst for a knowledge of the living God and a longing and a burning desire to see Him acting,\n\nmanifesting himself and his power, rising and scattering his enemies . . . The thirst for God and longing for the exhibition of His glory are the essential preliminaries.\" D.M. Lloyd-Jones: Revival pp.90-91)\n\nSUDDENNESS \"and suddenly there came . . .\" Acts 2:2.\n\nRevival is a Divine attack on society. In revival God's work may be sudden and unexpected; often even believers are caught unawares, while fear and astonishment grip unbelievers hearts: \"There was nothing, humanly speaking to account for what happened\" noted Joseph Kemp of Charlotte Chapel in Edinburgh in 1905. \"Quite suddenly, upon one and another came an overwhelming sense of the reality and awfulness of His Presence and of eternal things. Life, death and eternity seemed suddenly laid bare.\"\n\nRevival is God springing a convicting surprise on His creation: \"I have declared the former things from of old; yea they went forth out of My mouth and I shewed them; SUDDENLY I did them and they came to pass, and new things do I declare; before they SPRING FORTH I tell you of them.\" (Isa 42:9; 2 Chron.29:36)\n\n\"The effect of the sudden working of the Spirit in revival is very striking in the conviction of sinners. Often without any preparatory concern or even thought for spiritual things, a sinner will be suddenly seized with overwhelming conviction of sin.\"\n\n(Acts 3:19 - \"seasons of refreshing . . . from the presence of the Lord\") . . . \"a movement bears this mark of spontaneity when men cannot account for what has taken place in terms of personalities, organizations, meetings, preachings, or any other consecrated activity; and when the work continues unabated without any human control. As soon as a movement becomes controlled or organized, it has ceased to be spontaneous - it is no longer a revival. The course of the 1904 revival has been outlined thus: \"God began to work; then the Devil began to work in opposition; then God began to work all the harder; then man began to work and the revival came to an end.\"\n\nThe spirit of revival is the consciousness of God. Men were \"pricked in their heart\" (Acts 3:7) \"fear came on every soul\" (v.43) \"The effects of such manifestations of God are twofold; men are made aware both of His power and His holiness. This manifestation . . . was intensely personal.\". . . It is God moving in power and holiness toward you; God coming for you, and calling your name! \"Here is an outstanding feature of revival; it is easy to see why it results in overwhelming conviction both among the saved and the lost whenever there is unjudged sin . . . At such times man is not only conscious God is there; but that He is there, it seems to deal with him alone, until he is oblivious of all but his own soul in the agonizing grip of a holy God. If these facts are bourne in mind, the extraordinary effects of past revivals will not seem incredible. The ruthless logic of Jonathan Edwards famous discourse \"Sinners In the Hands of an Angry God\" could not have produced the effect it did had not God been in the midst.\"\"When they went into the meeting house the appearance of the assembly was thoughtless and vain; the people scarcely conducted themselves with common decency.\" recorded Trumbull, but goes on to describe the effects of the sermon: \"the assembly appeared bowed with an awful conviction of their sin and danger. There was such a breathing of distress and weeping that the preacher was obliged to speak to the people and desire silence that he might be heard.\" Conant says, \"Many of the hearers were seen unconsciously holding themselves up against the pillars and the sides of the pews as though they already felt themselves sliding into the pit.\"\n\nThis overwhelming sense of God bringing deep conviction of sin is perhaps theoutstanding feature of true revival. Its manifestation is not always the same; to cleansed hearts it is heaven; to convicted hearts it is Hell.\n\nSpurgeon noted \"If you read the story of the Reformation, or the later story . . . of Whitefield and Wesley, you are struck with the singular spirit that went with the preachers. The world said they were mad; the caricaturists drew them as being fanatical beyond all endurance; but there it was, their zeal was their power. Of course the world scoffed at that of which it was afraid. The world fears enthusiasm, the sacred enthusiasm kindled by the thought of the ruin of men and by the desire to pluck the firebrands from the flame, the enthusiasm which believes in the Holy Ghost, which believes God is still present with His church to do wonders.\"\"Dislike of enthusiasm,\" said D.M.Lloyd-Jones \"is to quench the Spirit. Those . . . familiar with the history of the Church and in particular the history of revivals will know this charge of enthusiasm is one always brought against people most active in a period of revival. (Revival op. cit p.72)\n\nSEVEN ''REVIVALS'' IN THE OT:\n\nDr. Wilbur Smith notes seven \"outstanding revivals\" in the Old Testament in addition to the one under Jonah.\n\n1) In Jacob's household (Gen. 35:1-15);\n\n2). Under Asa (2 Chron.15:1ff);\n\n3). Jehoash (2 Kings 11,12; 2 Chron 23,24);\n\n4. Hezekiah (2 Kings 18:4-7; 2 Chron. 29:31)\n\n5). Josiah (2 Kings 22,23; 2 Chron. 34,35)\n\n6&7). Two revivals after the Exile under Zerubbabel (Ezra 5,6) in which Haggai and Zechariah play a prominent part and finally in Nehemiah's time in which Ezra was the outstanding figure (Neh.9:9; 12:44-47)\n\nNINE CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE REVIVALS:\n\n(1) They occurred in a day of deep moral darkness and national depression\n\n(2) They began in the heart of one consecrated servant of God who became the energizing power behind it, the agent used of God to quicken and lead the nation back to faith in and obedience to Him\n\n(3) Each revival rested on the Word of God and most were the result of preaching and proclaiming God's law with power\n\n(4) All resulted in a return to the worship of Jehovah\n\n(5) Each witnessed the destruction of idols where they existed\n\n(6) In each revival there was a recorded separation from sin.\n\n(7) In every revival they returned to offering blood sacrifices\n\n(8) Almost all recorded show restored great joy and gladness\n\n(9) Each revival was followed by a period of great national prosperity.\n\nThe Greek equivalent of the OT word for revive is only used five times in the NT. \"Why is it not more of a N.T. word? For the simple reason that New Testament Christianity IS revived Christianity.\" (Spurgeon On Revival: Eric W. Hayden). This Greek word-- anazo is used for the restoration of the prodigal son (Luke 15:24 and also for the deadly effect of sin (Ro 7:9).\n\nThe primary aim is to lead souls to repentance . . . There is so much emphasis today on believing,receiving, deciding and so on and so little on the vital step of repenting . . . the men dealt faithfully with the question of sin that the conscience might be aroused.\"\n\n\"It was a precept of Wesley to his evangelists in unfolding their message to speak first in general of the love of God to man; then with all possible energy so as to search the conscience to its depths, to preach the law of holiness; and then, and not till then, to uplift the glories of the gospel of pardon and of life. Intentionally or not, his directions follow the lines of the epistle to Romans.\"\n\nBishop Hadley Moule on Romans - John Nelson records of Wesley at Moorfields, \"His countenance struck such an awful dread upon me before I heard him speak that it made my heart beat like the pendulum of a clock; and when he did speak, I thought his whole discourse was aimed at me.\" (Wesley, Pollock p.154)\n\nSTORY OF JOHN WESLEY\n\nIn the 30 years following the outpouring of the Spirit on the Moravian congregation at Herrnhut (1727) their evangelists, with a motto of \"To win for the Lamb that was slain the reward of His suffering\" had carried the gospel not only to nearly every country in Europe but also to many pagan races in North and South America, Asia and Africa. Dr. Warnek, German historian of Protestant Missions wrote \"This small church in 20 years called into being more missions than the whole evangelical church has done in two centuries.\"\n\nIf there is no revival of righteousness, there is no revival at all. It is characteristic of revivals that sins long hindering blessing are exposed, confessed and forgiven; relationships wrecked by pride, envy and evil-speaking are wonderfully restored\" . . .Jonathan Edwards wrote - \"Abundance has been lately done making up differences,confessing faults one to another and making restitution; probably more within these two years than in the thirty years before.\"The cycle of change and decay, of reformation and apostasy, the record of any nation with a godly heritage that follows the pattern of Israel's four-fold collapse:\n\nIsrael forgot GOD\n\nIsrael forgot God's LAWS\n\nIsrael made up NEW gods\n\nIsrael made up NEW LAWS\n\nPsalm 119:37-note Turn away my eyes from looking at vanity, And revive me in Thy ways.\n\nSpurgeon - He had prayed about his heart, and one would have thought that the eyes would so surely have been influenced by the heart that there was no need to make them the objects of a special petition; but our author is resolved to make assurance doubly sure. If the eyes do not see, perhaps the heart may not desire: at any rate, one door of temptation is closed when we do not even look at the painted bauble. Sin first entered man's mind by the eye, and it is still a favourite gate for the incoming of Satan's allurements: hence the need of a double watch upon that portal. The prayer is not so much that the eyes may be shut as \"turned away\"; for we need to have them open, but directed to right objects. Perhaps we are now gazing upon folly, we need to have our eyes turned away; and if we are beholding heavenly things we shall be wise to beg that our eyes may be kept away from vanity. Why should we look on vanity? - it melts away as a vapour. Why not look upon things eternal? Sin is vanity, unjust gain is vanity, self conceit is vanity, and, indeed, all that is not of God comes under the same head. From all this we must turn away. It is a proof of the sense of weakness felt by the Psalmist and of his entire dependence upon God that he even asks to have his eyes turned for him; he meant not to make himself passive, but he intended to set forth his own utter helplessness apart from the grace of God. For fear he should forget himself and gaze with a lingering longing upon forbidden objects, he entreats the Lord speedily to make him turn away his eyes, hurrying him off from so dangerous a parley with iniquity. If we are kept from looking on vanity we shall be preserved from loving iniquity.\n\nGive me so much life that dead vanity may have no power over me. Enable me to travel so swiftly in the road to heaven that I may not stop long enough within sight of vanity to be fascinated thereby. The prayer indicates our greatest need, - more life in our obedience. It shows the preserving power of increased life to keep us from the evils which are around us, and it, also, tells us where that increased life must come from, namely, from the Lord alone. Vitality is the cure of vanity. When the heart is full of grace the eyes will be cleansed from impurity. On the other hand, if we would be full of life as to the things of God we must keep ourselves apart from sin and folly, or the eyes will soon captivate the mind, and, like Samson, who could slay his thousands, we may ourselves be overcome through the lusts which enter by the eye.\n\nComment: Did you note the association of prayer and revival and prayer for our eyes!\n\nDECLENSION:\n\n\"The concealing and the neglect of certain truths and certain aspects of Christian truth has always been the chief characteristic of every period of declension in the long history of the Christian church . . . No revival has ever been known in the history of churches which deny or ignore certain essential truths . . . And without a single exception it is the rediscovery of these cardinal doctrines that has led to revival.\" (Martyn Lloyd-Jones: \"Revival\" pp.33,35)\n\nThe German who started it all was Nikolas Count Ludwig Von Zinzendorf, a Moravian of unlikely name, who established a community called Herrnhut (\"The Lords Watch\") in 1727. It almost wasn't! Division and argument nearly destroyed the work until repentance, forgiveness and a prayer-meeting were established to hold it together. This went on for an even more unlikely duration - for 100 years, 24 hours a day! Even children wept and prayed with power before God. In 1732, these Moravians sent out their first missionaries. Two kinds of teams left - to win the lost and to win the church. By 1792 they mobilized over 300 such radicals. Their motto was \"To win for the Lamb that was slain the reward of His suffering\". One such team bumped into an unsaved Anglican missionary. Born 17th of June, 1703, and now 32 he was on board a ship to America. In contrast to the English, the Moravians never complained when struck or pushed and s"
