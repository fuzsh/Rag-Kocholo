To what extent does the religion promoted by the Hebrew Bible require that Israel live its communal life in the national homeland? Might Israel fulfill its destiny, however defined, outside the land? And how does life in the land, however demarcated, compare in importance with other elements presented as belonging to Israel’s ultimate destiny, such as, for example, adherence to the law? To what extent can the Lord of Israel be worshiped outside the land, and to what extent is the law of the covenant bound to the land and dependent on it? To what extent must the people of Israel take hold of and settle in the “entire land of Canaan” for them to fulfill their destiny? Might the land be shared with other peoples, or must non-Israelites be expelled, subjugated, or at least kept at a safe and isolated distance? Or might non-Israelites have a territorial share in the land of Israel while still preserving their non-Israelite identity? Might non-Israelites live in the land and even take part in the religious destiny of Israel? And would a situation of this sort require the complete rejection of all other religious cults, or might non-Yahwistic cults be somehow given a place and function within the land of Yhwh and the Yahwistic faith? These are just some of the questions that will be raised in this book. I will be asking these questions of the Hebrew Bible as a whole and of the biblical texts individually, inquiring how the individual biblical writers and editors addressed these issues. I will attempt to show that all of these questions were addressed by various biblical authors and that diverse and even opposing answers were given to them. It is thus extremely difficult to speak simplistically about the biblical conception of territory, as if the Hebrew Bible speaks in one voice on this issue, and my emphasis will lie instead on disclosing and comparing “theologies” of territory in biblical literature. At the same time, an attempt will be made to evaluate the place that territory plays in the final form of Hebrew Scripture as a whole. The issues that I raise in this book are not completely new. Many of them have been addressed in recent times by various scholars and theologians who have taken a renewed interest in the “territorial dimension” of the Hebrew Bible, and the present work is greatly indebted to them. At the same time, works of a predominantly theological or sociological orientation can sometimes suffer from a tendency to gloss over textual difficulties and inconsistencies, a tendency that can distract the interpreter from direct\n\nvii\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\nand immediate attention to the broader issues that are at the center of his or her concern. And yet, at least from the perspective of this book, a great deal of significance is specifically embedded in the “small” details. Textual snags and jagged edges in biblical passages, far from being a mere nuisance in the analysis of broad theological and ideological issues, are of paramount consequence. They provide us with a most important key toward unlocking the terms of debate and the intensity of disagreement between biblical writers. An innocuous passage could be left alone by later readers and will therefore read smoothly and without complication. It is the controversial text that elicits editorial comment, qualification, or a thoroughly transformative reinterpretation, and this often results in an awkwardly formulated text. The snags and inconsistencies in the text often enable us to reconstruct the process of the growth of the text in question and to uncover the final editor’s transformative exegesis, thus providing us with an important window into the diversity of outlooks in ancient Israel. Diachronic analysis of the biblical text will thus constitute an essential component in the attempt of this book to retrieve something of the heated dynamic that animated the work of the authors and editors whose efforts consummated in the formation of the corpus of the Hebrew Bible. It will be shown, in particular, that behind the present form of several biblical texts can be found earlier forms that often displayed remarkably open and inclusive conceptions about the relationship between the people of Israel and the land of Canaan. It would be quite disingenuous to claim that the questions raised in this book have been raised out of academic and historical interest alone. As a religiously observant Jew and as a citizen in the modern State of Israel, I raise questions that are of great personal and existential significance. And yet, though the questions have been largely determined by my personal concerns, I have made every attempt to put my personal preferences on hold in order to elicit as accurately as possible the biblical answers to these questions. Indeed, there are many biblical conceptions expounded in this book with which I would most definitely not identify on a personal level. At the same time, I have presented here many new and hitherto unrecognized biblical conceptions and traditions that I believe may bear significant implications for the contemporary religious and political situation in the State of Israel. It seems to me that this is the proper way to attempt to bring out the theological relevance of biblical literature to the contemporary situation. The questions raised must be significant, without any predetermination of the answers. Only after the biblical conceptions are accurately identified, analyzed, and categorized can one begin the process of discussing the possible relevance of these conceptions for the contemporary situation. A modest indication of how an endeavor of this sort might proceed is provided in the epilogue of this book. The extent to which the theological\n\nPreface\n\nix\n\nconceptions reconstructed and presented in this book will be found both academically cogent and theologically meaningful remains, of course, to be judged by the reader.\n\nNote to the Reader Abbreviations used in this book are the standard abbreviations found in the Society of Biblical Literature Handbook of Style (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 1999).\n\nChapter 1\n\nIntroduction: The Significance of the Land in Defining Israel The theme of Israel’s relationship to its land is clearly pivotal, holding a central place within the overall structure of the narrative of the Hebrew Bible. With the exception of just a few biblical books, noted the Israeli scholar S. D. Goiten, 1 “the entire Bible is one long story with one theme: how the people of Israel merited the land of Israel, how they lost it, and how they regained it.” It may be readily granted that the political agenda of the times profoundly influenced Zionist students of the Hebrew Bible such as Yehezkel Kaufmann, David Ben-Gurion, and many others, 2 who discerned in it a pronounced preoccupation with the theme of the land. (It is similarly far from coincidental that contemporaneous Christian scholars of “Old Testament Theology” often failed to give proper attention to the centrality of this theme, highlighting in its place prophetic universalism. 3 The same desire to downplay the national-territorial quality of the biblical 1.

See the collection of essays in D. Ben-Gurion, BenGurion Looks at the Bible (trans. J. Kolatch; London: Allen, 1972). See also M. Cogan, BenGurion and the Bible (Beer Sheba: Ben-Gurion University, 1989) [Hebrew]. For a penetrating analysis of the central place of the Hebrew Bible and its study in early Zionist thought and in Israeli society and its later decline, see U. Simon, “The Place of the Bible in Israeli Society: From National Midrash to Existential Peshat,” Modern Judaism 19 (1999): 155–77. 3. A typical example of this tendency is exhibited in W. Eichrodt’s classic Theology of the Old Testament, Volume One (trans. J. A. Baker; Philadelphia: Westminster, 1976). Expressions of nationalism are continuously referred to as narrow, and the height of spirituality is exemplified in passages that allegedly transcend nationalism and territorialism (cf., e.g., ch. 11, esp. pp. 482–85). There has been since then, however, a growing appreciation among Christian theologians and scholars of the centrality of the territorial orientation of the religion of the Hebrew Bible as more than just a passing phase in an evolutionary spiritual process leading to the New Testament. See especially: W. Brueggemann, The Land: Place as Gift, Promise, and Challenge in Biblical Faith (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1977); R. Rendtorff, Israel und sein Land: Überlegungen zu ein politische Problem (Munich: Chr. Kaiser, 1975); W. D. Davies, The Territorial Dimension of Judaism (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1982); Norman C. Habel, The Land Is Mine: Six Biblical Land Ideologies (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1995).\n\n1\n\n2\n\nChapter 1\n\ntradition is clearly evidenced in much of the early Reform Jewish theology, which opposed political Zionism. 4 However, the thesis of the pervasiveness of the land theme within the biblical corpus is no mere anachronism through which later political concerns are projected back into the ancient past. 5 Concern with the relationship between the people of Israel and the land of Israel indeed manifests itself at nearly every turn in the biblical corpus, and this fact tends to indicate that life on the land constitutes a central element within the nationalreligious faith system that the Hebrew Bible both reflects and promotes. Let us review, then, some of the evidence for the prominence of the theme of Israel’s relationship to the land within biblical literature.\n\nThe Prominence of the Land Theme The Torah One of the first motifs that we encounter in the very first book of the Bible is the divine promise to the patriarchs, in which the promise of land is a major element. The motif of the promise of the land runs throughout the stories of the patriarchs and, to a great extent, may be seen as the literary “mortar” that holds together and imbues continuity into the diverse and variegated materials that comprise the patriarchal narrative. 6 Indeed, most of the dramatic action in the patriarchal stories takes place in the vicinity of cities or individual sites, and it is chiefly the patriarchal promises that lend these local traditions a broader national tenor (cf. esp. Gen 28:13–15). 7 The unconditional and interminable character of the promise of the land, whether stated explicitly or merely implied (Gen 12:7; 13:14– 4. See, for example, K. Kohler, Jewish Theology, Systematically and Historically Considered (New York: Ktav, 1968), chs. 48–53. For an insightful analysis and discussion, see A. M. Eisen, The Chosen People in America: A Study in Jewish Religious Ideology (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1983), esp. pp. 12–22, 53–72. See also the illuminating discussion of Hermann Cohen’s anti-Zionist views in J. Melber, Hermann Cohen’s Philosophy of Judaism (New York: Jonathan David, 1968), 376–406. 5. For a consideration of this problematic with regard to the modern historical attempt to reconstruct Jewish identity in Greco-Roman times, see S. Jones and S. Pearce, “Introduction: Jewish Local Identities and Patriotism in the Greco-Roman Period,” in Jewish Local Patriotism and Self-Identification in the Graeco-Roman Period (ed. S. Jones and S. Pearce; JSPSup 31; Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1998), 22–28. 6. Note that the only explicit connections between the figures of Jacob and Abraham are to be found in the promises to Jacob in Gen 28:4, 13–15; 35:12. Note also the editorial nature of Gen 26:3–5, where Isaac is presented as receiving the blessing due to the merit of his father, Abraham. On the originally independent nature of the Isaac tradition, see M. Noth, A History of Pentateuchal Traditions: Translated with an Introduction by Bernhard W. Anderson (Engelwood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1972), 103. 7. See Z. Weisman, “National Consciousness in the Patriarchal Promises,” JSOT 31 (1985): 55–73; J. Emerton, “The Origin of the Promises to the Patriarchs in the Older Sources of the Book of Genesis,” VT 32 (1982): 14–32.\n\nThe Significance of the Land in Defining Israel\n\n3\n\n17; 15:7–21; 17:8; 16:3; 18:4, 13; 35:12), 8 underscores the cardinal importance of the land theme for Genesis and seems to indicate that life on the land is practically axiomatic for the constitution of “Israel.” In Exodus through Deuteronomy, the goal and purpose of the exodus from Egypt are depicted in terms of fulfilling the promise to provide Israel with a land “flowing with milk and honey” (Exod 3:8; Deut 7:23). 9 The laws of the Sinai covenant are given with the intention that they be implemented specifically in the land (Deut 4:1; 8:1; 11:31–32; etc.). Some of the laws are actually prefaced by the phrase “when you come into the land” or the like (Exod 34:11–12; Lev 25:2; Num 15:2; Deut 17:14; 26:1), clearly indicating that it is specifically for the regulation of life in the land that the covenant stipulations are made. 10 This connection between the laws and the land is clear even when the above-mentioned preface is lacking, since the reward promised for obedience is national prosperity and fertility in the land (see Exod 23:25–26; Lev 26:1–10; Deut 11:13–17; 28:1–14). The goal of the wilderness wanderings is the arrival in the land, and any apparent detour or delay requires explanation and justification (Exod 13:17–18; Num 13–14; Deut 2:14). The cardinal Israelite sin of the desert period is the rejection of the divine gift of the land, in light of the report of the spies that the land “devours its inhabitants” (Num 13–14). It is this land-oriented sin that brings on the punishment of the 40-year wandering in the desert and the death sentence for the entire exodus generation. According to Ps 106:24–27, the eventual exile of Israel from the land was already determined at the time of the incident of the spies and was actually a long-postponed punishment for this initial primal sin. The concluding chapters of Numbers deal with various issues related to the inheritance of the land. 11 8. Scholars often contrast this with the conditional covenant made at Sinai (Exod 19:5–6; 23:22). See J. D. Levenson, Sinai and Zion: An Entry into the Jewish Bible (Minneapolis: Winston, 1985). 9. See Naḥmanides on Lev 26:16, and Y. Elizur, “The Land of Israel in Biblical Thought,” in Reflections on the Bible: Selected Studies of the Bible Circle in Memory of Yishai Ron (ed. M. Hobab; Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 1973), 33–46 [Hebrew]. Following the rabbis, these authorities see in Lev 26:32 and Ezek 36:8 an assertion that the fertility of the land is inherently connected to the people of Israel. When the Israelites are in exile, the land itself remains barren and uninhabitable. See also Deut 29:21–27. Though there may be some basis for deriving this idea from that which is implied in the biblical texts, the reading seems somewhat overstated. There is no unequivocal statement that the nations will fail in their attempts to live off the land. According to the implication of 2 Kgs 17:24–28, the foreign colonists succeeded in settling the northern territory of Israel after the initial attacks by lions were countered. 10. See the discussion of Naḥmanides in his commentary at Lev 18:25. 11. First, a census is taken to determine who will receive inheritances and how they are to be allotted (Num 26). This leads to the inheritance claims of the daughters of Zelophehad and the laws that derive from this incident (27, 36). The issue of the inheritance of the two Transjordanian tribes is dealt with in Num 32, and in Num 34 the exact contours of the land that is to be divided are outlined.\n\n4\n\nChapter 1\n\nThe book of Deuteronomy continues to accentuate the issue of the land, its conquest and settlement, bringing the theme to an even higher level of prominence. The land is continually referred to here as the ultimate gracious gift that the Lord bestows upon the people of Israel. 12 The book begins with a lengthy retelling of the story of the spies (Deut 1:19–46), continues with a recitation of the laws that are to be adhered to so that Israel may inherit the land and flourish therein (see Deut 4:1, 40; 6:18; 8:1; 11:8–9; etc.), and warns that disobedience will bring plague and sterility to the land (Deut 28:15–44; 29:21–26) and that the Israelites will ultimately be forced to leave the land (Deut 4:25–27; 28:36–37, 63–68). The book ends with the tragic depiction of Moses, who is allowed to view the land from a distance but barred, in spite of his heartfelt pleadings, from actual physical entrance therein (Deut 34; compare 3:23–28). 13 The Historiographical Books The issue of Israel’s relationship to the land continues to dominate in the historical narrative that follows the Pentateuch, particularly in the book of Joshua. It is in the book of Joshua that the basic narrative tension of the Pentateuch, first elicited by the unfulfilled patriarchal promises of national life in the land, finally achieves its climactic resolution. It is here that the patriarchal promises are fulfilled and the goal of the exodus from Egypt realized. Von Rad, noting this thematic balance of weight, postulated an original “Hexateuch” that was only later truncated into the present five-book structure known as the Pentateuch. 14 In a way, the rabbis of the Talmud may be said to have anticipated von Rad’s position when they stated, “If it were not for the fact that the Israelites sinned, they would not have received more than the five books of Torah and the book of Joshua, for it [relates] the estimation of the land of Israel.” 15 The implication of this 12. See P. D. Miller Jr., “The Gift of God: The Deuteronomic Theology of the Land,” Int 23 (1969): 451–65. 13. There is no parallel to Deuteronomy’s depiction of Moses pleading with the Lord to enter the land in the book of Numbers. This seems to be the creation of the author of Deuteronomy, reflecting his concern to heighten the intensity of the divine punishment of exclusion from the land. In Num 27:12–23 the Lord, of his own initiative, commands Moses to climb Mt. Nebo and see the land before his death. Moses pleads here that God provide the people with a new leader but makes no supplications for himself concerning entrance into the land. Furthermore, Moses’ punishment in Num 20:12 is not that he may not enter the land but that he will not bring the people into the land. The divergence is slight but significant. Moses’ punishment consists of the fact that he loses his status as leader of the people. The fact that he will not enjoy the personal fulfillment of walking in the land is not the main issue. This understanding of the punishment of Moses is only found in Deuteronomy. Thus, while Deuteronomy highlights the significance of life in the land, the Priestly material in Numbers may be said to play down this element somewhat. 14. G. von Rad, “The Form-Critical Problem of the Hexateuch,” The Problem of the Hexateuch and Other Essays (Edinburgh: Oliver & Boyd, 1966). 15. B. Ned. 22b. Note Rashi’s explanation of “for it relates the estimation of the land”: “the estimation of each portion of each tribe is written in it, and it would not suffice with-\n\nThe Significance of the Land in Defining Israel\n\n5\n\nstatement is that the material in the book of Judges and in the books that follow is little more than a record of the later historical unfolding of the founding events that are fully related in the six books of the Hexateuch. Thus, the events of the Hexateuch alone are the fundamental and theologically constant foundational events. The subsequent books did not need to be written. 16 This rabbinic conception may be grounded not only in the discernment that Joshua brings thematic closure to the books of the Pentateuch but also in the perception of the editorial presentation of the book of Judges as a kind of appendix to the book of Joshua. The editors of the books of Joshua and Judges look back at the period of Joshua as an idyllic period of Israelite faithfulness to God, which was the natural product of the wonders they witnessed in relation to the conquest ( Josh 24:31; Judg 2:7). The sinfulness of the period of the judges is attributed to the birth of a new generation that did not experience those impressive, wondrous acts ( Judg 2:10). These editorial comments probably form the basis for the rabbinic distinction between founding divine acts of the Hexateuch and the subsequent history of sinful Israel that begins with the book of Judges. Historians have long argued that the distinction between an initial period of a unified national conquest of the land under the heroic leadership of Joshua and a later period of protracted and only partly successful tribal battles after Joshua’s death ( Judg 1:1a) is, to a great extent, an artificial construct of the historiographer. In reality, there was no single, unified conquest of the land by the entire twelve-tribe confederacy of Israel. The establishment of the people in the land was, rather, a protracted and gradual development, in which disparate clans and tribal groups slowly came to see themselves as sharing a distinctive national identity and in which military conquest played only a limited and qualified role. The picture that emerges from parts of the book of Judges, where clans and tribes sometimes act independently and where military achievements are often local and limited, is probably closer to the historical reality of “the conquest” than the picture that emerges from much of the book of Joshua. Of interest to us here, however, is not the historical reality but the historiographical out it. Since they rebelled and sinned, the great wisdom of the remaining books was added to them in order to perturb them further” (!) 16. The question of Tetrateuch/Pentateuch/Hexateuch is complex and need not concern us here. In any event, the many literary connections between the book of Joshua and the materials in Exodus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy concerning the conquest and settlement make the unique connection between the Pentateuch and Joshua at some stage in the textual development of the biblical corpus difficult to deny. A detailed treatment of the issue can be found in A. G. Auld, Joshua, Moses, and the Land: Tetrateuch-PentateuchHexateuch in a Generation since 1938 (Edinburgh: T. & T. Clark, 1980). See also G. N. Knoppers, “Establishing the Rule of Law? The Composition Num 33,50–56 and the Relationships among the Pentateuch, the Hexateuch, and the Deuteronomistic History,” in Das Deuteronomium zwischen Pentateuch und Deuteronomistischem Geschichtswerk (ed. E. Otto and R. Achenbach; Göttingen: Vanderhoeck & Ruprecht, 2004), 135–54.\n\n6\n\nChapter 1\n\nrepresentation and what it tells us about the significance of the land theme within the Hebrew Bible. From the point of view of historical credibility, the story of the mixed successes and failures of the individual tribal battles of conquest, such as the account presented in Judg 1, for example, could have served well as the direct continuation of the exodus story. The biblical editors could easily have depicted the tribes as individually capturing their respective inheritances, attributing their failures to idolatry and sin. However, the editors prefaced the account of Judg 1 and all the battles of the period of the judges with the inaugural and foundational “period” of Joshua. The reason for this seems clear. The conquest and inheritance of the land was too important a theme to be depicted in the equivocal and partial terms of realistic historical presentation. Theological exigencies required that the fulfillment of the patriarchal land promise be depicted in terms of a dramatic and heroic act of divine grace to the nation as a whole, in which the conquest was both swift and complete. (See Josh 10:40–43; 11:16–17, 19–20, 23; 18:1; 21:43–45; of course, contemporary political concerns may well have influenced the historiography as well.) The book of Joshua establishes the conquest as an “event” that occurred within a brief span of time as the culmination of the saving acts of God for Israel. The events depicted in Judges, when made to follow the idyllic period of Joshua, become a subsequent fall from an original period of grace. Rather than reflecting the partial and gradual establishment of the Israelites in the land, the stories of Judges are made to reflect a lapse from an original pristine state of national and territorial completeness, 17 when all of Israel lived in the entirety of the land. In light of this editorial structure, the rabbinic understanding of the biblical books beginning with Judges as theologically secondary and ultimately unessential is, we may say, thoroughly grounded in the biblical text. Though the book of Judges presents material that in many ways may be seen as postfoundational, it still sets its focus on Israel’s secure hold on the land in the face of surrounding enemies that subdue them. In fact, the entire Deuteronomistic History may ultimately be seen as centering on the issue of Israel’s prosperity and fortunes in the land. Nothing is told here of the fortunes of the exiles who were expelled by Assyrian forces from the Northern Kingdom, and next to nothing is told of the fortunes of the exiles from Judah. According to M. Noth, 18 the entire Deuteronomistic His17. The picture that is reflected in the present form of the book of Joshua on the completeness of the conquest is, to be sure, complex and contradictory, reflecting various editorial layers. See, most recently, N. Wazana, All the Boundaries of the Land ( Jerusalem: Bialik, 2007), 199–229 [Hebrew]. This notwithstanding, the Deuteronomistic introduction to Judges clearly presents the entire book of Joshua in terms of an idyllic past. 18. See M. Noth’s classic treatment of this issue in Deuteronomistic History (trans. J. Doull et al.; JSOTSup 15; Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1981), 89–99. Note especially his minimalist position on Deuteronomy’s attitude toward the future on pp. 97–99. For the predominance of the theme of the land in the Deuteronomistic History, see J. G.\n\nThe Significance of the Land in Defining Israel\n\n7\n\ntory is little more than an attempt to provide a historiographical theodicy that would justify Israel’s loss of the land in terms of divine retribution for disobedience to the deuteronomic law. Scholars since Noth have come to appreciate the redactional complexity of the Deuteronomistic History, so that the subsuming of the entire corpus under a single purpose or agenda may now appear overly simplistic. 19 Nonetheless, the concern to justify the expulsions of Israel and Judah clearly holds a highly prominent place in many Deuteronomistic texts (e.g., Josh 23:13–16; 1 Kgs 8:46–50; 14:14–16, 22–24; 2 Kgs 17). The entire history thus reflects a land-centered perspective. Similarly, the concern of the book of Kings to depict synchronically the history of both Judah and Israel clearly shows that, in spite of its strongly pro-Judean slant, it conceives of “Israel,” at least initially, in terms of both the northern and southern tribes and in terms of the land as a whole. The book’s conclusion, which tells the story of the elevation of the exiled Judean king Jehoiachin in the Babylonian court to a position above all the other exiled kings (2 Kgs 25:27–30), certainly reflects more than simply the last incident of interest that the historiographer could report. 20 McConville, “Faces of Exile in Old Testament Historiography,” in After the Exile: Essays in Honor of Rex Mason (ed. J. Barton and D. J. Reimer; Macon, GA: Mercer University Press, 1996), 27–44. 19. The literature on the Deuteronomistic History is enormous. For a good collection of representative essays, see G. N. Knoppers and J. G. McConville, eds., Reconsidering Israel and Judah: Recent Studies on the Deuteronomistic History (Sources for Biblical and Theological Study 8; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2000). 20. So Noth, Deuteronomistic History, 74, 98. A more recent attempt to understand the story of Jehoiachin’s release and the book of Kings as a whole is that of J. R. Linville, “Rethinking the ‘Exilic’ Book of Kings” JSOT 75 (1997): 21–42. Linville understands Kings as promoting an “exilic” conception of Israel, wherein life outside the land is “normative” and according to which “a true relationship with Yahweh does not depend on political autonomy” (p. 23). According to Linville, Kings does reach something of a high point and resolution with Josiah, but this can be seen to serve the “exilic” ending well, as it anticipates a resolution to the problem of “Israel” surviving the punishment. The resolution is that “exile” is the normative status of “Israel,” a status accepted through conscious agreement with Yahweh in the days of the famous king. Josiah learns that his piety in the face of divine judgment will fail to secure salvation for the nation (22:15–20). Still, he and all the people make a covenant with Yahweh to obey every detail of the law. . . . Josiah’s reign provides a paradigm of “exilic” behavior; an ideal king carrying out a sweeping reform, in the full knowledge that exile will not be revoked . . . the monarchy could be retained as a symbol of “exilic” Israel . . . his story may have been shaped to imply that reconciliation with Yahweh is not to be confused with national sovereignty or salvation, and that Exile is not to be confused with abandonment by the deity. The book can then hurry to its conclusion, with the release of Jehoiachin again signaling that Exile is not destruction. (pp. 37–38) This interpretation appears rather forced and overstated. Josiah’s behavior can hardly serve as a paradigm of exilic behavior since no Judean king could use his regal authority to sponsor a public covenant of obedience to a civil law-code such as the deuteronomic law outside the land. The idea that “reconciliation with Yahweh is not to be confused\n\n8\n\nChapter 1\n\nIt surely was written to indicate that hope for the restoration of the Davidic Kingdom in the land was not lost and that the future restoration of the monarchy was still a possibility. 21 Later biblical historiography displays the same concern to depict Israel’s fortunes in the land and to justify the exile, even if its theological tenets diverge from those of the Deuteronomistic History. 22 It is interesting to note that, in an unparalleled passage, the Chronicler depicts Hezekiah as encouraging the northern Israelites who still remained after the attacks of the Assyrians to repent by joining the Judeans in coming to the Jerusalem temple for the Passover sacrifice. Hezekiah promises that this will with national sovereignty or salvation” is only true of the book of Kings in the sense that national sovereignty in and of itself is not deemed sufficient for a proper relationship with Yahweh. Linville implies, however, that for the book of Kings national or political autonomy in the land is no longer deemed necessary for complete reconciliation with Yahweh. This hardly seems supported by the evidence. It is true that 1 Kgs 8:46–48 only mentions that the exiles who sincerely repent will be forgiven and that God will have their captors bestow mercy upon them. It does not speak of a return to the land as in Deut 30:3–10. Yet we cannot conclude from this reticence anything more than the fact that those living at the time of the exile felt that it would be religiously inappropriate to speak confidently of a return at the time that God’s wrath was raging. We certainly cannot conclude that the author viewed political autonomy in the land as completely a thing of the past. Indeed, if this were so there would be little need for the exiles of the text to direct their prayers to the temple, city, and land! Linville also argues that Kings may have been edited at a much later date than the immediate aftermath of the exile. If so, however, why is there no depiction of the new developments of exilic history that the author of Kings is supposedly so interested in promoting? 21. Though the messianic implication of the story of Jehoiachin’s release and the exaltation of his throne above those of the other exiled kings is perhaps somewhat understated, it should not be completely denied. Even if an immediate implication of the story was that Israel could continue its existence and thrive as an exilic community under foreign domination (so C. T. Begg, “The Significance of Jehoiachin’s Release: A New Proposal,” JSOT 36 [1986]: 49–56), this does not contradict the fact that the story also opens up the possibility of a future restoration in the land. We should not minimize the fact that the story centers on the Davidic king and the exaltation of his throne in relation to all the other exiled kings. If the exclusive purpose of the narrator was to indicate that Israel could thrive in exile, he could have ignored the incident of Jehoiachin’s release and told, for example, of the release of the high priest instead (as related in Josephus, Ant. 10.154). On the significance of the story of Jehoiachin’s release as a reflection of a tempered and conditional messianic hope, see J. D. Levenson, “The Last Four Verses of Kings,” JBL 103 (1984): 353–61. This should be contrasted with the view of H. W. Wolff (“The Kerygma of the Deuteronomistic Historical Work,” in Reconsidering Israel and Judah [Sources for Biblical and Theological Study 8; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2000], 77–78), who suggests that the story of Jehoiachin’s release hints at Israel’s new vocation to serve as a mission to the nations. I find this suggestion extremely forced. 22. For the approach of the book of Chronicles to these issues, see S. Japhet, The Ideology of the Book of Chronicles and Its Place in Biblical Thought (trans. A. Barber; Frankfurt: Peter Lang, 1989), 125–98. Note in particular the Chronicler’s removal of the blame for the exile from Manasseh (in contrast to 2 Kgs 21:1–16; 23:26–27) and the depiction of Manasseh’s exile, repentance, and return to the land (2 Chr 33:10–16), no doubt symbolic of the Chronicler’s view of the divine workings with the nation as a whole.\n\nThe Significance of the Land in Defining Israel\n\n9\n\nlead to the return of their exiled brothers and children to the land (2 Chr 30:6–9). 23 The Chronicler diverges here from the historical presentation in Kings, insofar as Kings asserts that the northern Israelites were completely removed from the land (2 Kings 17). 24 For the Chronicler, the northern Israelites were never completely severed from the land. More importantly, the Chronicler here (as elsewhere) 25 exhibits a concern for the future fortunes of the northern Israelite populations, both those in the land and those who went into exile. The book of Kings, in contrast, shows little concern for the future fortunes of the exiles from the north and hardly seems to incorporate them in any hopes for the future. 26 Instructive for an appreciation of the centrality of the land for late biblical historiography is the conclusion of the book of Chronicles and the continuation of the narrative in Ezra and Nehemia. As noted by Kaufmann, Chronicles and Ezra–Nehemia pay no attention whatsoever to the events that transpired in the Babylonian Exile. 27 After describing the destruction 23. This passage should be compared with and contrasted to the late material in 1 Kgs 8:46–48, where the exiles themselves are to pray in the direction of the land, city, and temple. This repentance will lead to forgiveness and the mercy of the captors, but not a word is said about returning to the land. Verse 34, however, may reflect the same idea as that of Chronicles. 24. For the Chronicler’s interest in and attitude toward the Northern Kingdom, see Japhet, The Ideology of the Book of Chronicles, 308–33; and n. 27 below. 25. See the summary of H. G. M. Williamson, Israel in the Books of Chronicles (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1977), 130–31. 26. F. M. Cross (Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Ethic [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1973], 279–80, 283) assumes that there was an expectation of an ultimate reunion of the two kingdoms under a Davidide in his first edition of the Deuteronomistic History. He sees this expectation in 1 Kgs 11:39b and in the references to Josiah’s destruction of Bethel (1 Kgs 13:2–5; 2 Kgs 23:15–20). Yet the acts of Josiah are extremely limited in scope and hardly appear to reflect a “reincorporation of the North” (p. 283). The people enjoined to partake in the paschal sacrifice in v. 21 are the Judeans alone, as indicated by the fact that the call was issued only after Josiah returned to Jerusalem. The “entire people” that participate in it are identical to the “entire people” that Josiah brought into the covenant—“all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem” (2 Kgs 23:1, 4). The Passover of Josiah was said to have been unparalleled since the time of the judges (vv. 22–23), not since the time of the division of the kingdom. There is therefore no reason to assume that the text seeks to indicate that the northern Israelites participated in it. Indeed, the assumption of Kings that the Israelites of the north were completely removed from the land and replaced by foreigners implies that the northern populace would not have been invited to participate. Finally, the material in 2 Kgs 17:7–23, the bulk of which Cross assigns to his first Deuteronomistic editor, gives no indication whatsoever that there is any hope left for a restoration of Israel. The only remaining evidence of hope for a reincorporation of the north is the brief comment in 1 Kgs 11:39b. The originality of this clause, however, is highly suspect, is not attested in the LXX, and is often considered a gloss. See S. J. De Vries, I Kings (WBC 12; Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 2003), 147, note; G. N. Knoppers, Two Nations under God: The Deuteronomistic History of Solomon and the Dual Monarchies (2 vols.; HSM 52–53; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1993–94), 1.191, note T. For further discussion, see nn. 90 (p. 37) and 158 (p. 70) below. 27. Kaufmann, The History of Israelite Religion, 4.451–52.\n\n10\n\nChapter 1\n\nof Jerusalem and the temple and the exile of the inhabitants to Babylon, the biblical historian goes on to relate that, in the first year of the reign of Cyrus, king of Persia, the king sent forth an edict allowing the Judeans to return to the land and rebuild the temple. For both Chronicles and Ezra– Nehemiah, happenings outside the land of Israel are not deemed “national history,” so the events that transpired between the exile and the return need not be recorded. Only that which relates to the return of the exiles is deemed worthy of attention. 28 As a complement to this, we may observe that, at the other end of the biblical spectrum, the Abraham story begins with his travels as an elderly man to the land of Canaan. All that transpired in his life in the land of Ur or Haran until this point is again deemed historically irrelevant. 29 The Land Theme in the Cult The land theme holds a central place not only in the orientation and focus of the biblical historiographical literature. Its prominence is also reflected in the liturgical texts of the Bible. From passages such as Deut 33:26– 29; Ps 44:2–5; 48:8–11; 80:9–12, we may learn that the great “event” of the conquest was recalled in cultic liturgy with the purpose of praising Yhwh’s heroism in the past and goading him on to do more of the same. 30 It seems almost certain that a major theme of the “Book of the Wars of the Lord” (Num 21:14; cf. 1 Sam 18:17; 25:28) and perhaps of “The Book of Yashar” as well ( Josh 10:12 and see LXX 1 Kgs 8:13) was the cultic glorification of the Lord of Israel in light of his role in the battles of conquest. 31 Quite possibly the stones of Gilgal were pointed to in an ancient festival as a reminder of the miraculous crossing of the Jordan and the divine bestowal of the land ( Josh 4:20–24). 32 From Ps 95:8–11, we learn that the paradigmatic sin through which the Israelites of the desert period lost their right to enter the land was rehearsed and highlighted within liturgical contexts as a warning or reproof for the present. 33 The centrality of the land in cultic matters is most clearly expressed in the famous words of the psalmist from the Babylonian Exile, “How can we sing the song of the Lord on foreign land?” (Ps 137:4). Worship of the Lord is so bound up with the land of the Israelites 28. The book of Daniel, which does depict life in exile, relates the fortunes of an individual and does not constitute historiography. 29. The significance of this observation is amplified following the assumption of J. Weingreen (“‫ הוצאתיך‬in Genesis 15:7,” in Words and Meanings: Essays Presented to David Winton Thomas [ed. P. R. Ackroyd and B. Lindars; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1968], 209–15) that many traditions circulated in ancient Israel concerning the early life of Abraham outside the land. 30. See also 2 Chr 20:7 which, though late, surely reflects early usage. 31. For this identification, see I. L. Seeligmann, Studies in Biblical Literature (ed. A. Hurvitz, S. Japhet, and E. Tov; Jerusalem: Magnes, 1996), 71 [Hebrew]. 32. See on this Cross, Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic, 103–5. 33. See W. M. Schneidewind, “Are We His People or Not?” Bib 76 (1995): 546–47.\n\nThe Significance of the Land in Defining Israel\n\n11\n\nthat it would be an impossible self-contradiction to sing his praises in a foreign land. This explains the force of the plea of the psalmist, “Save us, Lord our God, and gather us up from the nations so that we may praise your holy name and glory in your praise” (Ps 106:47). Outside the land, the Lord cannot be praised. Of course, the entire book of Lamentations is also testimony to the centrality of life on the land for biblical religion. The centrality of the land for Israelite religion also comes to expression in the basically cultic designation of the land as the “inheritance of the Lord.” According to the Priestly passage in Lev 25:23, the land of Israel’s settlement is the Lord’s, and the Israelites are mere sojourners in his land. The implications of this idea are very significant. 34 On the one hand, it renders Israel’s national connection with the land much more precarious. The land is ultimately the Lord’s alone, so Israel has no real title to the land. 35 Indeed, it seems that there is no essential difference, following this conception, between the Lord’s relationship to the Israelites in the land and to the previous Canaanite population in the land. Both groups are expected to honor the requirements of the Lord of the land, and both risk expulsion if they fail to do so (Lev 18:26–28). On the other hand, the idea that the land belongs to the Lord as his own private estate implies an intimate and lasting relationship between the Lord and the land. The land of Israel is not merely the land that the Lord designated for Israelite settlement. It is the land that the Lord has chosen for his own home, and, as such, it is “holy territory” (Ps 78:54). In several passages where this concept of the land as the “Lord’s inheritance” is employed, one gets the clear sense that the primary relationship that the Lord maintains is his relationship with the land, and his relationship with the nation is secondary to it. 36 The laws, following 34. The importance of the idea of the land as “Yhwh’s land” and its contrast with the idea of the land of promise was first highlighted by G. von Rad, “The Promised Land and Yahweh’s Land in the Hexateuch,” The Problem of the Hexateuch and Other Essays (Edinburgh: Oliver & Boyd, 1966), 79–93. See also Habel, The Land Is Mine, 75–114. 35. In my opinion, von Rad (ibid.) did not sufficiently emphasize the extent of the theological gap that separates this theme from the theme of the patriarchal land promise. Von Rad emphasizes the cultic character of the theme of Yhwh’s land and contrasts it with the historical conception of the patriarchal land promise. The divergence goes beyond this. The patriarchal land grant implies a complete transferal of ownership of the land to the patriarchs and their descendants. Once the land is given as a gift, it belongs fully to Israel. This basically contravenes the conception of the land as belonging to the Lord permanently and being given to the Israelites only as resident aliens. The effect of the patriarchal land promise theme, it thus appears, would be to remove the sacral character from the land and understand the land in more “nationalistic” terms. 36. See S. E. Loewenstamm (From Babylon to Canaan: Studies in the Bible and Its Oriental Background [Jerusalem: Magnes, 1992], 322–60), who discuses the relationship between the national and territorial meaning of the idea of the Lord’s inheritance. The primacy of the relationship between the Lord and the land is clearly reflected in the law of the sabbatical year (Lev 25:1–7, 20–22; 26:34–35). It is the land that must observe the sabbatical\n\n12\n\nChapter 1\n\nthis conception, are the “demands of the deity of the land,” and they apply equally to all those who dwell there, regardless of their nationality (cf. 2 Kgs 17:26). The religion of Yhwh, according to this cultic conception, is thoroughly land centered. The Lord punishes the settlers of the north who took the place of the exiled Israelites with lion attacks for their failure to worship him even though they never entered into covenant with him, and he, for his part, never acted on their behalf. Ultimately, the basis of the deity’s claim to worship is his lordship over the land and not his acts of salvation for a covenanted community. Following this conception, one could hardly worship the Lord of the land on any other territory. On the contrary, outside the land of Yhwh, one perforce worships other gods (1 Sam 24:19). The land-centered character of this conception comes to further expression in its close connection with the land’s fertility. Obedience to the cultic demands of the land’s deity brings blessing and fertility to the land (Lev 25:18–22; 24:3–5, 9–10). This is a major focal point of cultic worship in general (Hag 1:3–11; Mal 3:10–12). 37 Instructive is the action taken by David to relieve the land of the famine that lasted for three years (2 Sam 21). David provides the Gibeonites with seven descendants of Saul to hang or crucify “before the Lord” (v. 9), so that the “inheritance of the Lord” might be blessed (v. 3). 38 The efficacy of this cultic act is clearly affirmed in v. 14: “Afterwards, God accepted supplication on behalf of the land.” Prophetic Literature Israel’s relationship to the land is a major thematic axis around which so much of prophetic literature revolves as well. Some of the prophets highlight the central act of divine benevolence—the bestowal of the good land. Ezekiel speaks of Israel’s land as being “the glory of all lands” that the Lord had sought out for them (Ezek 20:6; see also Jer 51:6–7; Mal 1:2–3). When Amos castigates the Israelites for their violations, the Lord reminds them, “It was I who destroyed the Amorites from before them, whose height was as high as the cedars, and whose strength was like that of the oaks, and I destroyed his boughs above, and his trunk below” (Amos 2:9). The prophet in Isa 17:9, according to the reading reflected in the LXX, speaks of the day when “his strong cities will be like the abandoned cities of the Hivites and Amorites, which they abandoned in the presence of the children of Israel.” 39 rest, and the Israelites must leave the land untilled so as to allow it this rest. Failure to grant the land this rest will result in the removal of the people not only as punishment but also in order to allow the land its rest. 37. For the connection between cult and fertility in biblical literature, see G. A. Anderson, Sacrifices and Offerings in Ancient Israel (HSM 41; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1987), 91–126. 38. For the exact meaning of the term crucify (‫)יקע‬, see P. K. McCarter Jr., 2 Samuel (AB 9; Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1984), 442 note. 39. See BHK.\n\nThe Significance of the Land in Defining Israel\n\n13\n\nPerhaps the most prominent of the threats voiced by the canonical prophets is the threat of territorial devastation and dispersion of the land’s inhabitants (Mic 3:12; Jer 4:6–7, 27; 7:14–15; etc.). In various prophecies, mostly deriving from the preexilic period, a small remnant of inhabitants will survive the divine onslaught unscathed (1 Kgs 19:18; Isa 4:12–13; 37:31–21; etc.). These remnants survive in the land, and they will constitute the “Israel” with whom the Lord will continue his covenantal relationship. 40 For these prophecies, it appears, the people who have been exiled from the land are seen as on par with those who have been destroyed and killed. It is just as unfathomable for the exiles to return as it is for the dead to be resurrected. From the point of view of the national covenant with the Lord, the exiles are the rejected ones. Though they continue to live as individuals, nationally speaking, they no longer exist, and so the covenant continues with the survivors in the land. This conception may be seen as the prophetic counterpart to the cultic conception of the land as the Lord’s inheritance. Since there can be no worship of the Lord outside his land, any relationship with him must continue with the few who survive and continue inside the land. The formulation of some of the patriarchal and Zion-Davidic promises in terms of an unconditional and interminable oath (Gen 17:8; 2 Sam 7:13–16; Ps 89:29–38; 122:13–14) probably belongs within this general theological category as well. Punishment for disobedience is foreseen here in terms of limited assaults that do not endanger the constancy of divine presence in the land. An interesting example of this outlook is found in the liturgical historical review of Neh 9. It is striking to note that nowhere in this extensive review of Israel’s fortunes up until the time generally referred to as “postexilic” is there any reference to the exile or the return from exile. 41 Nor is there mention of the destruction of the temple or of the renewal of temple service. 42 The ultimate divine punishment, which God is said 40. This idea was nicely emphasized by R. de Vaux, The Bible and the Ancient Near East (trans. D. McHugh; London: Darton, Longman & Todd, 1972), 15–30. For a thorough examination of the conception of the “remnant” in prophetic literature, see G. F. Hasel, The Remnant: The History and Theology of the Remnant Idea from Genesis to Isaiah (Berrien Springs, MI: Andrews University Press, 1972). 41. This is analogous to the downplaying of the exile in Chronicles ( Japhet, The Ideology of the Book of Chronicles, 363–73). The difference is that, while in Chronicles the temple constitutes a major theme of the book, in this liturgical piece the theme is not mentioned. 42. Similarly, the prayer mentions the divine provision of “saviors” (Neh 9:27) but not the divine covenant with the Davidic Dynasty. The entire chapter speaks in terms of Israel as a whole without any mention of a division between north and south. The references to the kings, prophets, and priests in vv. 32–35 make no distinction between Israelites and Judeans. The land on which the supplicants now live as slaves is still “wide and fat” (v. 35), indicating that the land in its entirety is envisioned. It seems, then, that the prayer does not stem from individuals who sought to continue the Davidic ideology of Judah. Rather, there is somewhat of a return to the early outlook of divine kingship, which sees in human kingship something of a sin. This understanding is buttressed by the reference to the divine kingship in several textual witnesses to v. 35 (cf. BHS).\n\n14\n\nChapter 1\n\nto have visited upon the people in light of their continued disobedience, consists of his delivery of the people into the hands of the “peoples of the lands” without, however, destroying them, abandoning them, or forsaking the covenant (vv. 31–32). As a result of this punishment, the people now live on the land as slaves and must pay for the produce of the land to the subjugating foreign kings (vv. 36–37). This situation of divine chastisement is said to have prevailed continuously “from the times of the Assyrian kings until this day” (v. 32). It seems that the focus of the review is exclusively on the fate of the people in the land. History is presented in terms of two main periods—the period of national independence on the land and the period of national subjugation on the land. There is no reference to any period of divine grace and reconciliation that came to expression in the return of the exiles to the land of their ancestors. The periodization of Israelite history in terms of “exilic” and “postexilic” simply does not exist here. The perspective of the liturgical piece of Neh 9 is thus completely land centered, in accordance with the early prophetic outlook concerning the “remnant” in the land, which I have mentioned. 43 In spite of the devastations inflicted on the land and its people, a remnant in the land still endures, and the Lord never abandoned his covenant with this remnant. The presence of this ideology within the late context of Neh 9 indicates that the land-centered outlook is not exclusively an early outlook. 44 On the contrary, it continues to inform the religious outlook of individuals who lived in the land for a very long time. According to another prophetic conception, one that as a result of the work of the canonizers holds a much more prominent place in the Bible, the continuity of “Israel” is embodied in the exilic community rather than in any remnant in the land (see Jer 24, 29, etc.). 45 Even though it is con43. For a somewhat similar analysis, see H. G. M. Williamson, “Structure and Historiography in Nehemiah 9,” in Proceedings of the Ninth World Congress of Jewish Studies, Division A: The Period of the Bible ( Jerusalem: World Union of Jewish Studies, 1988), 117–31. For “exile” as a spiritual condition that applied to life in the land in the postexilic period, see B. C. Gregory, “The Postexilic Exile in Third Isaiah,” JBL 126 (2007): 475–96. 44. What is remarkable is the fact that this liturgical piece has been preserved in a book that champions the view that “True Israel” is specifically and exclusively made up of Judeans who returned to the province of Yehud from the Babylonian Exile. The editors place the land-centered liturgical piece in the mouths of the returnees from exile, and in so doing, significantly blur the land-centered perspective of the original material. Within the liturgy’s new context and setting in Ezra–Nehemiah, the initial significance of the piece was covered over and brought into the service of the exilic theology that the editors sought to promote. 45. For the theme of exile and return in prophetic literature, see the collection of essays in A. Gileadi, ed., Israel’s Apostasy and Restoration: Essays in Honor of Roland K. Harrison (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 1988); J. M. Scott, ed., Exile: Old Testament, Jewish and Christian Conceptions ( JSJSup 56; Leiden: Brill, 1997). It has been argued compellingly that the original letter of Jer 29 is in vv. 4–7, and vv. 10–14 concerning the return after 70 years are\n\nThe Significance of the Land in Defining Israel\n\n15\n\nceded that exile is equivalent to national death, the Lord will yet “resurrect” the dead body of Israel from the grave (Ezek 37:1–14). In spite of the exilic orientation, this conception also must be seen as land centered, for the present exile from the land constitutes a chastisement that serves as a prelude to a future return to the land. According to Ezekiel, the resurrected body of Israel will immediately be brought back to the ancestral land. The return of the exiles to the land will be accompanied by the return of the divine presence, which was said to have departed from the land at the time of the exile (Isa 52:12; Zech 2:14–16; etc.). At that time, the desolate and withered land will be restored to a new state of lush fertility (Ezek 36:8–12, 35; 47:1–12; Joel 4:18–21; Amos 9:13–15). The theological significance of the doctrine of the divine departure from the land and the future return, as opposed to the doctrine of the Israelite remnant in the land, is that the Lord’s presence on earth is not believed to be inexorably bound to a particular territory. 46 If the Israelites go into exile, the Lord leaves the land as well and, as perhaps implied in a few passages, may even follow them into the exile. 47 Thus, according to Ezek 11:16, the secondary. See W. McKane, Jeremiah xxvi–lii (ICC; Edinburgh: T. & T. Clark, 1996), 738; A. Rofé, “Studies in the Composition of the Book of Jeremiah,” Tarbiz 44 (1975): 25 [Hebrew]. This would imply that Jeremiah was not prepared to speak of any imminent return, even one that would take 70 years to materialize, and only advised adjustment to the exilic reality in an open-ended way. We may also compare the prophecy of Jer 27:19–22 concerning the temple vessels. The last words of v. 22, ‫והעליתים והשיבתים אל המקום הזה‬, are missing in the LXX, which apparently reflects an earlier version of the text. That the original Jeremiah oracle would have forfeited all hope for the return of the temple vessels is indicated by Jeremiah’s oracle about the ark ( Jer 3:16). Cf. McKane, Jeremiah xxvi–lii, 703–8; P. R. Ackroyd, “The Temple Vessels: A Continuity Theme,” in Studies in the Religion of Ancient Israel (ed. G. W. Anderson et al.; VTSup 23; Leiden: Brill, 1972), 176–77. On the entire issue of the exclusively exilic provenance of prophecies of return from exile, see most recently B. Oded, “Redemption after Exile,” Beth Mikra 52 (2007): 7–41 [Hebrew], and the references cited therein. Oded contends that some of the prophecies of return from exile are of preexilic origin. 46. An interesting position is reflected in the story of the ark that is “exiled” from Israel, only to wreak havoc in the land of the Philistines (1 Sam 4–6, esp. 4:21–22). On the one hand, the ark can be captured in the battlefield and presents no threat to the Philistine armies there. On the other hand, once it is brought to foreign territory it begins to afflict the people and land and seeks to return to its own territory (6:9). For Mesopotamian parallels to the idea of the deity’s leaving from and returning to the temple, see P. D. Miller Jr. and J. J. M. Roberts, The Hand of the Lord: A Reassessment of the “Ark Narrative” of I Samuel (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1977), 9–17, 77–87. 47. For an exposition of Ezek 11:16 and Ezekiel’s visions of the divine chariot in this direction, see M. Ben-Yashar, “The Chariot in the Book of Ezekiel and the ‫מקדש מעט‬,” in Studies in Bible and Exegesis, vol. 4 (ed. R. Kasher, Y. Sefati, and M. Zipor; Ramat Gan: BarIlan University Press, 1997), 9–22 [Hebrew]. This conception is fully developed in rabbinic literature. See A. J. Heschel, Heavenly Torah as Refracted through the Generations (trans. and ed. G. Tucker, with Leonard Levin; New York: Continuum, 2005), 104–26. The idea that the divine presence follows the exiles is hinted at in Gen 46:4, in a secondary passage that we will discuss below. It is also somewhat implied in the assertion of Jer 29:14 that the Lord will be present for the repentant exiles when they seek him.\n\n16\n\nChapter 1\n\nLord can serve as a ‫מקדש מעט‬, a sort of spiritual sanctuary, for the Israelites in exile. 48 Further, any new non-Israelite inhabitants in the land or individual Israelite remnants there cannot take Israel’s place as worshipers of the Lord of the land, for the Lord removes his very presence from the land when he sends his people into exile. 49 Clearly, the Lord’s attachment to the land in this conception is far more equivocal. He is much more fundamentally the Lord of the people. Even for this conception, however, the exile comes as divine punishment and to live in exile is still tantamount to living under the shadow of divine chastisement. The centrality of life in the land for this prophetic understanding of exile is highlighted by the vision of the “new covenant” that will be formed at the time of the restoration ( Jer 31:31–34; see also the implication of Jer 3:1–5). With the end of national life in the land, the entire covenantal bond between God and Israel comes to an end (see also Zech 11:10–11). 50 In exile, Israel’s national existence hangs in suspension. Only a new covenant made upon return to the land and based on a new act of salvation other than the exodus ( Jer 16:14–16) will be able to restore the broken relationship between God and Israel. At the same time, as long as the Lord’s presence is removed from the land, his “divinity,” so to speak, also hangs in suspension. 51 It will not be possible for anyone (whether in the land or out) to invoke his name in cultic worship until he restores his presence in the land. All of the evidence assembled above, and much more not mentioned here, points to Scripture’s pervasive understanding of the land as the essential “playing ground” where “biblical religion” is supposed to occur. 52 48. For a review of interpretations of the term ‫מקדש מעט‬, see Ben-Yashar, “The Chariot in the Book of Ezekiel,” 20 n. 78; W. Zimmerli, Ezekiel 1 (trans. R. E. Clements; Hermeneia; Philadelphia: Fortress, 1979), 115–16, 262–64; Paul M. Joyce, “Dislocation and Adaptation in the Exilic Age and After,” in After the Exile: Essays in Honour of Rex Mason (ed. J. Barton and D. J. Reimer; Macon, GA: Mercer University Press, 1996), 45–58. 49. Of course, the question about which community constitutes “Israel,” the small remnant in the land or the presumably larger exilic community, could never be determined by any “objective” criteria. 50. See the compelling interpretation of G. W. Buchanan, “The Covenant in Legal Context,” in The Concept of the Covenant in the Second Temple Period (ed. S. E. Porter and J. C. R. de Rooh; JSJSup 71; Leiden: Brill, 2003), 40–43. For the understanding of Zech 11:10–11, see C. L. Meyers and E. M. Meyers, Zechariah 9–14 (AB 25C; New York: Doubleday, 1993), 268–70. 51. See Pesiq. Rab Kah.102b on Isa 43:12: “Similarly, You are my witnesses, says the Lord, and I am God—When you are my witnesses I am God, and when you are not my witnesses, I, as it were, am not God.” 52. What I mean by “biblical religion” is not the religion of the ancient Israelites whose story is told in the Hebrew Bible but the religion of people for whom the Hebrew Bible, to the exclusion of other written documents, served as the defining canonical text. Several attempts have recently been made to formulate a theology of the Hebrew Bible within a Jewish context. For the problematics involved in such an enterprise, see most\n\nThe Significance of the Land in Defining Israel\n\n17\n\nTo a great extent, the Hebrew Bible appears both to reflect and to promote a national-religious faith system in which national life on the land constitutes a vital, indeed indispensable element. To say the same thing in different terms, the Hebrew Bible may be said to reflect and promote a type of Israelite national-religious “identity” in which life on the land is a critical component. 53 Having said this, we must be careful to avoid facile simplifications and unnuanced generalizations. 54 What does it mean to say that life on the land is of “central” importance within the structure of the religious system of the Hebrew Bible? Does it mean that there can be no “Israel” outside the land whatsoever? Does it mean that, outside the land, “Israel” does continue to exist but only in limbo form and that biblical religion outside the land hangs in suspended animation? Is presence in the land a sine qua non for living in covenant with the Lord of Israel or for worshiping the God of the land of Israel in any meaningful way? There should be little doubt that much of the evidence mentioned above does indeed reflect these land-centered outlooks. At the same time, we should not overlook other pieces of evidence that seem to point in a different direction. In the following paragraphs, I will attempt to gather evidence pointing to what appears to be a different current of thinking within the biblical corpus. This current reflects a more tempered view of the place of the land in biblical religion. Though life in the land is still usually seen to be important in these passages, and even central, it is clearly not seen as thoroughly indispensable.\n\nThe Qualified Importance of the Land The Narrative Traditions Perhaps the most prominent example of a text in which life in the land is presented as a value of qualified significance is the story of the settlement of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half of Menasseh outside Canaan, in the territory of the Transjordan referred to as “the land of Gilead” (Num 32). The story makes it clear that the settlement of these tribes in this area did not coincide with the original divine plan. The original divine plan called recently Z. Zevit, “Jewish Biblical Theology: Whence? Why? and Whither?” HUCA 76 (2005): 289–340. See also S. Gesundheit, “Gibt es eine jüdische Theologie der Hebräischen Bibel?” Biblische Theologie (2005): 53–64. 53. On the ways in which national identity is constructed, see B. Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origin and Spread of Nationalism (London: Verso, 1991); P. Connerton, How Societies Remember (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989). 54. See Elizur, “The Land of Israel in Biblical Thought”; and H. M. Orlinsky, “The Biblical Concept of the Land of Israel: Cornerstone of the Covenant between God and Israel,” ErIsr (Avigad Volume; 1985): 434*–55*. Reprinted in The Land of Israel: Jewish Perspectives (ed. L. A. Hoffman; Notre Dame, IN: University of Notre Dame Press, 1986), 27–64. These studies may be said to suffer from a certain one-sidedness.\n\n18\n\nChapter 1\n\nfor settlement in the land of Canaan, which, as indicated by the territorial demarcations of Num 34:11–12, refers to the territory to the west of the Jordan. The tribes in question, however, asked to trade in their portions of Canaan for settlement in the Transjordanian territory. This request was granted after assurances were given that they would serve in the forefront of the conquest for Canaan before fully settling down in the Transjordanian territory. It is important to emphasize that the story does not attempt to justify the settlement of the two and a half tribes outside the land of promise in terms of some life-threatening circumstance. The Transjordanian tribes simply want to settle in the territory outside the land of Canaan because it appears to have fertile pastures that are suitable for their flocks. No consideration is given to the fact that the request most naturally implies that the land of promise is not sufficiently fertile and that such an implication is sacrilege (cf. Num 13–14). The only objection raised against the request concerns the obligations of the tribes in the battles of the conquest. Once assurances of their contribution to the war effort in Canaan are obtained, the request to live outside Canaan is readily granted. Moses is not even depicted as feeling constrained to consult with the Lord about the request. The implication of this story is fairly clear. Tribal settlements outside the land are legitimate as long as military obligations are honored and upheld. Another narrative piece that apparently deems life in the land unessential for “national” existence is the book of Esther. In opposition to the overwhelming majority of historiographical literature in the Bible, which focuses exclusively on Israel’s history in the land, this book focuses completely on life outside the land (see also the stories of Daniel). The book’s obvious disinterest in the idea of national life in the land of Israel is exhibited first of all in the fact that at the end of the book the two Jewish leaders, Mordechai and Esther, have no intention of gathering the exiles for a return trip to the land of their ancestors. What is more, though Mordechai and Esther reach the heights of political power and influence in the Persian Empire, they make no effort to use their positions to assist their brothers and sisters who have returned to Jerusalem beginning with the time of the declaration of Cyrus (see Ezra 4:6 concerning the difficulties of the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem during the reign of ‫)אחשורוש‬. This stands in marked contrast to the figure of Nehemiah, who prays and mourns over the plight of the Jewish community in Jerusalem, and even goes on to intervene with the Persian king on their behalf (Neh 1–2). In fact, the book of Esther never even mentions the community in Jerusalem. Mordechai is depicted as a semiregal Jewish figure with a significant measure of power within the Persian Empire. Though Mordechai is said to have used his influence for the benefit of the Jews within the various provinces that make up the Empire (Esth 8:9–15; 10:3), no reference is made to the fact that the Jews had their own semi-independent province in the land of Israel. Possibly this province was something of an embarrassment to the\n\nThe Significance of the Land in Defining Israel\n\n19\n\nauthors of Esther, since it threatened to give credibility to the allegations of Jewish dual loyalty (see Esth 3:8). Mordechai’s Benjaminite rather than Judean descent may indeed have made him fit to take on kingly qualities that would deflect Jewish loyalties from the Davidic House of Jerusalem and encourage, instead, allegiances with the Persian dynasty. 55 In any event, from the perspective of the book of Esther, it seems, the “postexilic period” does not exist. Though hopes of ultimate national restoration on the ancestral land may lie hidden in the deeper recesses of the story, 56 these hopes clearly lie in the unforeseen future. For the present, the exilic period continues 55. For the possibility that Benjaminite-Judahite rivalry reasserted itself in the Persian period, see J. Blenkinsopp, “Benjamin Traditions Read in the Early Persian Period,” in Judah and the Judeans in the Persian Period (ed. O. Lipschits and M. Oeming; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2006), 629–45; Y. Amit, “The Saul Polemic in the Persian Period,” in ibid., 647–61. For additional conceptions of an “unended exile,” see M. A. Knibb, “The Exile in the Literature of the Intertestamental Period, Heythrop Journal 17 (1976): 253–72; Robert P. Carroll, “Israel, History of,” ABD 3.575; idem, “Exile! What Exile? Deportation and the Discourses of Diaspora,” in Leading Captivity Captive: “The Exile” as History and Ideology (ed. L. L. Grabbe; JSOTSup 278; Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1998), 62–79; idem, “Deportation and Diasporic Discourses in the Prophetic Literature,” in Exile: Old Testament, Jewish and Christian Conceptions (ed. J. M. Scott; JSJSup 56; Leiden: Brill, 1997), 63–85. Carroll’s rhetoric is sometimes provocative and needlessly evaluative. His basic thesis is capsulated in statements such as the following: “We need to keep in mind that not all prophetic voices spoke of exile with restoration, but that some ancient voices never recognized any actual or possible return after catastrophic deportations. There is a literature of deportation which effectively has been silenced by the more dominant voices given prominence by the ideological holding of the canonizing strategies” (p. 71); “since the collapse of Jerusalem against the Babylonians to this day, Diaspora has been the normal and normative experience of the majority of Jews who have ever lived” (pp. 83–84). Though Carroll is surely correct in emphasizing the selectivity of the canonizers and in asserting that many in the diaspora (or even in the land) did not believe that the exile ended with the edict of Cyrus, there is no indication that the idea of a future return was ever given up as a possibility or as a future ideal by biblical writers or their constituents after the exile. Carroll admits that “any sense of the permanence of the diaspora experience” is missing from the prophetic literature but then asserts that this “might not convey very much positive information about the Hebrew Bible.” Again, “the rhetoric of return and rebuilding is very strong in Isaiah 40–55, but it may point to nothing more than fantasy or chauvinistic rhetoric . . . for many generations it must have represented no more than a conventional trope. Perhaps at best only a distant echo of ancient tales . . . without any sense of a place to which people might aspire one day to ‘return’ thither.” It is totally unclear why the hope of restoration should be dubbed “chauvinistic rhetoric.” Nor is it clear why those who believed in the Hebrew Bible as sacred Scripture would have taken the biblical rhetoric of return from exile as nothing more than “a distant echo of ancient tales.” Formulations of this sort sound much too modern, and the history of Jewish nationalism in ancient (and modern) times both inside the land and out (on which, see D. Mendels, The Rise and Fall of Jewish Nationalism [New York: Doubleday, 1992]) seems to belie Carroll’s assessment. Of course, this does not mean that many of the exilic communities did not adjust to their new environments and develop a lifestyle that was, practically speaking, one of permanence. Yet this does not stand in conflict with the preservation of the ideal of a future return. 56. The book takes care to mention that Mordechai was part of the community that went into exile at the time of Jehoiachin (2:6). The memory of the Jerusalemite origins is\n\n20\n\nChapter 1\n\nunabated, regardless of whatever steps toward restoration may have been taken by some in the province of Yehud. It is worth noting that the failure of Mordechai and Esther to intervene on behalf of the community in Jerusalem and the temple was greatly disturbing to the rabbinic sages. They ameliorated this difficulty by supplementing the story with imaginative additions. According to b. Meg. 15b, the fact that Ahasuerus offered Esther specifically “until half [‫ ]חצי‬of the kingdom” was because he was indicating that he would not allow the rebuilding of the temple, which would divide the kingdom (‫)שחוצץ למלכות‬. 57 The implication of this is clear. We should not hold Esther accountable for not responding to the king’s offer with a request on behalf of the temple, since the rebuilding of the temple was specifically excluded from his offer. This is made even more explicit in the First Targum to Esther (at Esth 5:3), which reads: The king then said to her: What do you need, Queen Esther, and what is your request? Even if you were to ask for half of my kingdom, I would give it to you; only [the request for the re-]construction of the Temple, which is located within the border of half of my kingdom, I shall not grant you, for thus I have pledged in oath to Geshem the Arab, to Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the Amonite slave, not to let it be [re-]built, for I fear the Jews, lest they revolt against me; this request I shall not grant you, whereas [any] other thing you request of me I shall decree that it be promptly carried out, and your wish shall be granted to you.\n\nOther additions in rabbinic literature that seek to bring the theme of the land and temple back into the Esther story are also evidenced. According to the targum (at Esth 1:1), Vashti advised Ahasuerus to revoke the original decree allowing the work on the temple. In divine retribution for this sin, it was decreed that she be executed in the nude and that Ahasuerus, who accepted her advice, would lose reign over his subjects. Extrapolating from Dan 5, some of the midrashim understand the “vessels” used in Ahasuerus’s banquet (at Esth 1:7) to be a reference to the temple vessels. 58 According to several sources, Mordechai did not simply accept his position as a deportee at the time of the exile of Jehoiachin (2:6). Rather, he returned to live in the land of Israel, only to be deported again during the thus highlighted. The only purpose of this note, so it seems, is to preserve the memory of life in the land as the ultimate ideal. 57. The idea seems to be that the king offered until half the kingdom, thus excluding the actual half, which is interpreted as the temple, which would divide the kingdom. The present form of the text in the Talmud reads: “half the kingdom, and not the whole kingdom, and not that which would divide the kingdom.” We would suggest that the first word “until” fell out of the text, thus requiring the addition of the doublet “and not the whole kingdom.” 58. See the sources in B. Grossfeld, The Two Targums of Esther (Edinburgh: T. & T. Clark, 1991), 33 n. 38.\n\nThe Significance of the Land in Defining Israel\n\n21\n\nexile of Zedekiah. 59 According to other sources, Mordechai used a third of the money from Haman’s treasures to help rebuild the temple. 60 All of these additions bring into focus that which is lacking in the biblical text. The biblical story is exilic in orientation and has no immediate interest in the land or the temple. Similar observations may be made with regard to the Joseph story, which, as has been widely observed, exhibits multiple parallels with the book of Esther. 61 Throughout his administrative career in Egypt, Joseph shows no concern for the welfare of his family in the land of Canaan. He provides for his family by bringing them to Egypt and promoting their welfare there. Joseph never gives expression to the idea that the land of Canaan has been promised to his ancestors or that it is in the land of his fathers that he sees his future destiny. Indeed, he and his entire family (including his wife, who is the daughter of an Egyptian priest) continue to live out their lives in Egypt without making any concrete plans to return to the ancestral land. Joseph’s brothers receive from their regal brother their own permanent land holdings in the choicest region of Egypt. Some have even suggested, in my view quite plausibly, that the Joseph story originated as an independent novella in the Egyptian diaspora and that, in its original form, it sought to justify and promote Jewish life in Egypt. 62 The Jews can be fruitful and multiply in the land of Egypt under the sure protection and sponsorship of the successful Jewish courtier. This may coincide with another tradition that saw Egypt in a positive light as providing a haven for the first Israelites who migrated there. 63 We may also mention, in this connection, the biblical emphasis on the exterritorial origins of Israel’s first patriarch(s) (see Gen 11–12; Deut 26:5; Josh 24:2, 14). Aside from Isaac, the patriarchs are not born on the land and are not inextricably bound to it. Paticularly telling is the presentation of the lives of the 12 eponymous tribal patriarchs. They are depicted as having been born in Padan Aram (Gen 29–30) and having died and undergone burial (except Joseph) in the land of Egypt (Exod 1:6). If the tribal 59. L.

The same idea is evidenced in the frequent employment of the designation “the land of Canaan” and the general avoidance of “the land of Israel” throughout most of biblical literature. 64 The clear preference for “the land of Canaan” seems to indicate that “Israel” as a people is distinct from the land and can ultimately exist independent of it. We mentioned above the observation of Y. Kaufmann that the Hebrew Bible hardly preserves any record of the history of Israelite life outside the land. The books of Ezra and Nehemiah pass over in silence all that transpired to the communities of Israel in exile. The implication of this is certainly significant. It seems to suggest that only when “Israel” (that is, the returnees from Babylon) lives in its land does it live and create a noteworthy “history.” At the same time, the significance of life in the land should not be overstated. For the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, where the story of the restoration in the land is depicted, the atmosphere of exile still prevails. In spite of the rebuilding of the temple and the restoration of at least some semblance of independence in Jerusalem and its surroundings, Ezra speaks of the community as standing before God in guilt and shame. This condition is said to have prevailed uninterrupted from the time of the fathers who were given over for slaughter and captivity “until this day” (Ezra 9:6–7). The restoration that has taken place is estimated as reflecting little more than a small modicum of divine grace, granted undeservedly to the sinful “remnant” (vv. 9, 15). In sum, restoration of life in the land and even the reestablishment of the temple and its cult does not significantly enhance the character of the relationship between God and Israel. 65 For all intents and purposes, Israel in the land seems to be thought of as little more than any another “exilic” community within the Persian Empire. 66\n\n64. For the uses of the terms in the Bible, see Japhet, The Ideology of the Book of Chronicles, 362–63 and n. 38. 65. Some of the rabbis asserted that the divine presence did not abide in the Second Temple at all. According to one explanation, the divine presence refused to settle in the temple as a sort of punishment for the fact that so many people failed to heed the call of Cyrus to go up to Jerusalem. For the sources and brief discussion, see E. E. Urbach, “When Did Prophecy Cease?” Tarbiz 17 (1946): 2–3 [Hebrew]; G. I. Davies, “The Presence of God in the Second Temple and Rabbinic Doctrine,” in Templum amicitiae: Essays on the Second Temple Presented to Ernst Bammel (ed. W. Horbury; JSNTSup 48; Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1991), 32–36. 66. Note also that in the prayer of Daniel 9, dated in the reign of Darius, son of Ahasuerus (v. 1), supplication is made on behalf of the Judeans, inhabitants of Jerusalem, and all Israelites in all their lands (v. 7). All of these populations are presented as living under the same shadow of divine disfavor. Verses 17–18 present the temple and city as desolate. The prayer is clearly a secondary addition. See B. W. Jones, “The Prayer in Daniel IX,” VT 18 (1968): 488–93.\n\nThe Significance of the Land in Defining Israel\n\n23\n\nThe Limited Emphasis on the “Land of Yhwh” The understanding of national life on the land as an ideal of only relative or qualified importance and significance is not merely expressed in various narrative traditions scattered throughout the Bible. In fact, it appears to run quite deep, coming to expression in some of the most fundamental aspects of the biblical tradition. It comes to expression, first of all, in the relatively minor place that the conception of the land as the “Lord’s inheritance” holds within the overall scheme of the Hebrew Bible. It is possible, of course, that the understanding of Yhwh as the deity of the land was deeply rooted in ancient Israel. The decisive point is, however, that this idea is only faintly alluded to in the narrative and law of the Hexateuch. The land of promise is most often referred to as the “land of Canaan” rather than the “land of Yhwh.” The dominating idea in the narrative material of the Bible is that of a deity who comes to the aid of a people in distress and forms a covenant with them that is grounded in an act of salvation. The Lord’s claim to allegiance is thus based upon his activity for his people in history rather than on his ownership of the land on which these people are living. The deity is thus much more of a community-oriented deity than a land-based deity. One of the main functions of the covenant ceremony is to unify into a single community all the various groups that participate in it. 67 The historical bonds that unite the covenant community ultimately transcend territorial borders. This is why the Israelite tribes are prepared to attack the Transjordanian tribes in response to what is perceived as a breach of the terms of the covenant, in spite of the fact that the Transjordanians are thought of as having settled outside the land ( Josh 22; see also Judg 21:8–12). The limited emphasis on the land as “Yhwh’s inheritance” is reflected not only in the biblical narrative but in the law codes as well. It has often been noted that many of the originally agriculturally based festivals are interpreted in the Hebrew Bible in terms of God’s acts of salvation in his­tory. 68 Famously, in the farmer’s religious confession of Deut 26:5–10, which is made upon bringing the first fruits of the crop to the temple, no thanks are given to the deity of the land for the provision of fertility. Instead, the farmer expresses thanks for the deity’s activities in national 67. The point is made forcefully and succinctly by D. Sperling, “Israel’s Religion in the Ancient Near East,” in Jewish Spirituality: From the Bible through the Middle Ages (ed. A. Green; New York: Routledge, 1987), 25–27. 68. Sperling (ibid., 22), following a very common scholarly trend. It is irrelevant for our purposes here to determine the extent to which the passages that highlight the historical realm of God’s activity, as opposed to his role in providing fertility, accurately reflect Israelite religion as understood by the people. It is also irrelevant for our purposes here to determine the extent to which this orientation toward history mirrors or diverges from other ancient Near Eastern religions. For discussion of these issues, see J. J. M. Roberts, “Myth versus History: Relaying the Comparative Foundations,” The Bible and the Ancient Near East: Collected Essays (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2002), 59–71.\n\n24\n\nChapter 1\n\nhistory. Of course, God is still thought of as controlling the rains and blessing the land with fertility and life. But he does so in his capacity as the Lord of the people. He is not the deity of the land who, at least theoretically, could have been just as happy being Lord of the Canaanites (cf. Lev 18:24– 28). The Deuteronomic Law Code continually emphasizes that the land is a gift that is given by God in history to Israel (Deut 8:7–10; 11:10–12). Similarly, the Lord of the Covenant Code is depicted as being situated at Sinai. It is from Sinai that the Lord comes to redeem the slaves of Egypt (Exod 19:4). His own attachment to the land of Canaan is thus not presented as primordial or ultimately essential. 69 Finally, it is highly significant that the phrase “Yhwh’s inheritance” is often used to designate the people of Israel (Deut 4:20; 1 Kgs 8:51–53; 2 Kgs 21:14; etc.). 70 To be sure, both the land and the people can be thought of together as constituting God’s inheritance, so no strict dichotomy between God’s relation to the land and his relation to the people should automatically be assumed. At the same time, the much greater preponderance in Scripture of the “national” application of the term in comparison with the “territorial” application is surely significant. And in many cases, it is clear that the national signification is narrow and exclusive and does not incorporate the territorial signification with it. In Deut 9:26–29, for example, Moses warns God that if he destroys his “nation and inheritance” in the desert, the Egyptians will conclude that he was unable to bring them into “the land that he promised them.” The application of the divine “inheritance” strictly to the nation again points to the idea that the primary relationship is the one between God and the people. The relationship between God and the land is, for many of these texts, secondary to it, even if it is still important. This implies that the relationship between God and Israel is not completely dependent on the land and can ultimately exist independent of it. The Limited Commemoration of the Divine Bestowal of the Land in the Law The qualification of the importance of the land is also to be seen in the choice of the historical act of salvation that is emphasized and commemorated. It is striking to note that hardly a single commandment legislated in the Pentateuch relates to the historical act of the divine bestowal of the land of settlement to either the patriarchs or the Israelites. 71 The Sabbath, 69. See also the passages depicting the arrival of the Lord from Sinai, Seir, and so on (Deut 33:2; Judg 5:4, etc.), all of which depict Yhwh as an outsider to the land. 70. H. O. Forshey, “The Construct Chain nahalat Yhwh/Elohim,” BASOR 220 (1975): 51–53. 71. The rabbis interpreted Deut 8:10 as a commandment to bless God for the land (b. Ber. 21a), and this interpretation is followed by J. H. Tigay, Deuteronomy (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1996), 94–95. It seems more likely, however, that the text refers\n\nThe Significance of the Land in Defining Israel\n\n25\n\nthe feasts of Mazzot and Booths, and a variety of other legal enactments are all said to commemorate the exodus from the bondage in Egypt. They all are intended to instill a sense of gratitude to the deity for his role in that event, and not for his role in Israel’s possession of and settlement in the land. There is only one solitary law, the law of the first fruits of Deut 26:1–11 referred to above, that recalls and expresses thanks for the land grant. Significantly, even in the prayer of the bringer of first fruits, only one verse is devoted to the bestowal of the land, while four deal with the theme of the exodus from Egypt. Again, not a single recorded festival commemorates the conquest and provision of the land, in spite of the fact that the three pilgrimage festivals are clearly rooted in agriculture and the gifts provided by the land. It surely would have been much simpler and more natural to present these festivals as festivals of thanksgiving to God for the good land that he gave them, rather than as commemorations of the exodus from Egyptian bondage. The fact that the connection between the festivals and the land grant was never made is a clear indication of the relatively secondary importance of this theme in biblical law. Indeed, throughout the Hebrew Bible, the Lord is predominantly referred to as the Lord of the exodus rather than the Lord of the conquest. 72 Nor should it be considered mere coincidence that the book of the “Wars of the Lord,” which probably presented a ritual exaltation of the Lord for his victories in the conquest of the land, is not preserved in the biblical corpus. The failure to preserve this material or any festival related to the land theme goes hand in hand with the preservation and canonization of a different festival in the biblical corpus—the Festival of Purim of the book of Esther. We have already emphasized the exilic character of this book. Naturally, the same characterization adheres for the festival. It commemorates and celebrates Jewish survival in the midst of the exile, assuring the exiles of God’s hidden protection. The festival is marked by feasting and drinking, the exchange of food portions, and gifts to the poor (Esth 9:17, 19, 22) and in no way expresses any anticipation of an imminent return to the land of Israel. The Limited Place of the Divine Bestowal of the Land in the Nonlegal Material We spoke above about the limited place of the conquest theme in the laws and rituals of the Pentateuch. This may be said to find its parallel in the muted position of the conquest story of the book of Joshua in comparison with the plagues and Sea of Reeds story in the book of Exodus. It can to a spontaneous exclamation of thanks rather than a ritual commandment. See S. D. Luzzatto, Commentary on the Pentateuch (Tel Aviv: Dvir, 1965), 521 [Hebrew]. 72. The centrality of the exodus tradition was emphasized by Noth, A History of Pentateuchal Traditions, 47–51.\n\n26\n\nChapter 1\n\nhardly be denied that, dramatically speaking, the stories of the conquest pale in comparison with the stories surrounding the exodus. There is nothing in Joshua that compares with the sustained dramatic presentation of ten successive plagues through which the Israelite deity displays his supremacy over the forces of Egypt. Similarly, the story about the crossing of the Jordan River in Josh 3–4; 5:1 appears as little more than a dim reflection of the much more impressive event at the Sea of Reeds. Indeed, while the story of the sea event has left its imprint on a wide range of biblical texts ( Josh 2:10; 24:6–7; Isa 43:16–17; 51:10; 63:12), the story of the splitting of the Jordan has left nearly no mark whatsoever. 73 And though Joshua promulgates a law and establishes a covenant between God and Israel at Shechem ( Josh 24), the grounding events orchestrated by Moses at Sinai thoroughly outshine this almost innocuous event. All of this corresponds to the fact that the book of Joshua, whose theme of conquest and settlement theoretically brings closure to the earlier books, has been excluded by the earliest canonizers from the primary unit known as the Pentateuch. Canonically speaking, Joshua does not bring closure to the material that precedes it so much as it serves as the beginning of a new unit, the historical books. 74 As we have noted, following von Rad, the entire literary corpus from the patriarchal promises in Genesis to the covenant on the Plains of Moab in Deuteronomy anticipates the themes of conquest and settlement. And yet, within the structure of the Pentateuch, the themes of conquest and settlement are never completely realized. The narrative of the Pentateuch leaves the reader hanging in mid-air, with Moses viewing the land from afar yet remaining with the people of Israel on foreign soil. The theological significance of this division is unmistakable. The elements of the Heilsgeschichte that are of interminable significance for Israelite religion include creation, exodus, law, and covenant. The inheritance of the land is an important appendix—but an appendix all the same. 75 73. While in Josh 4:6–7, the children are to be instructed about the miracle of the crossing of the Jordan alone, in the parallel in vv. 22–24, the comparison with the crossing of the Reed Sea is unavoidable. 74. It should be noted that we do not really find "
