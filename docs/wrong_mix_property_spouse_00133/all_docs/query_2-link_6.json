Dopamine Receptors and Presynaptic Synthesis Capacity Predict Behavioral Flexibility in Foraging Decision-Making in Humans\n\nAngela Ianni*, Daniel Eisenberg, Erie Boorman, Sara Constantino, Catherine Hegarty, Joseph Masdeu, Michael Gregory, Philip Kohn, Tim Behrens, Karen Berman\n\nNational Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States\n\nBackground: Foraging is experimentally defined as a reward-guided behavior that involves deciding whether to engage with the current environment or leave and search elsewhere. This type of decision is crucial for survival and depends on a widespread circuit in the brain (including the midbrain, striatum, medial prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex) that is important for encoding and comparing values of different options in order to appropriately adjust behavior (6,7,8). Furthermore, neuromodulators such as dopamine and norepinephrine have been implicated in foraging behavior due to their role in value coding, through integration of reward prediction errors, as well as by controlling the tradeoff between exploitation of a known reward environment and exploration of other unknown options (1,3,4,11). Abnormalities in this type of decision-making have been found in addiction, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia, all associated with dysfunction of the dopamine system. Although previous studies have identified an important role of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and of neuromodulators in foraging behavior, it is unclear how regional variation in dopamine synthesis and receptors impacts behavior in humans. Here we directly measured dopamine presynaptic synthesis capacity and D1 and D2 receptor binding potential with PET imaging. In these same individuals, we measured foraging behavior using a computer-based task and tested for relationships between dopamine measures and adaptive foraging behaviors.\n\nMethods: Fifty-one healthy adults (mean age 33.9 ± 1.3 years; 25 females) were recruited from the local community and screened by a physician to rule out psychiatric, neurological, or major medical illness. Participants were also excluded if they were taking medications that could affect neural function. Foraging behavior was assessed with a computer-based task in which subjects collect apples (later converted to money and added to their compensation) from trees in four different apple orchards (hereafter referred to as reward environments) that differ in how quickly the trees run out of apples with each harvest (depletion rate) and how long it takes to travel from tree to tree, both of which affect the average reward rate (2). With each presented decision, subjects can either harvest apples from the tree they are currently at or leave and move on to a new tree. The behavioral measure of interest is the threshold for leaving a tree (patch-leaving threshold) and how the threshold changes between reward environments that differ in average reward rates. On separate days, subjects completed three PET scans to directly measure presynaptic dopamine synthesis capacity ([18F]-FDOPA, 45 participants) and D1 ([11C]NNC112, 39 participants) and D2-3 ([18F]Fallypride, 39 participants) receptor binding potential (BPnd), while resting with their eyes open. Subjects also completed a T1-weighted MRI scan used for registration and brain segmentation (with Freesurfer and manual adjustments) to generate native-space regions of interest (ROIs) in the basal ganglia (putamen, caudate nucleus, ventral striatum, and dopaminergic midbrain). The FDOPA uptake rate (Ki) was calculated with the Gjedde-Patlak method (5,10) and dopamine D1 and D2 receptor BPnd was calculated with the SRTM method (9) using a cerebellar reference region. We tested for correlations between PET measures and adaptive foraging behavior, measured as the change in patch leaving threshold between the two reward environments with maximally different average reward rates, using statistical thresholds of p<0.05 (hypothesis-driven basal ganglia ROIs) and p<0.005 (whole-brain voxelwise data), uncorrected.\n\nResults: Adaptive foraging behavior was positively correlated with FDOPA Ki in extrastriatal regions including the ACC (r=0.50, p=0.00073) and posterior midbrain (r=0.47, p=0.0015), with D1 BPnd in the ventral striatum (r=0.43, p=0.0071), and with D2-3 BPnd in the dopaminergic midbrain (r=0.41, p=0.033).\n\nConclusions: We found PET correlates of decision-making in a patch foraging task that supports previous work in animals and patients with Parkinson’s disease suggesting a role of neuromodulators in tracking the average reward rate of the environment and adjusting the threshold for deciding to leave a particular potentially rewarding environment (3,6). Specifically, the change in patch exit threshold between environments with maximally different average reward rates was correlated with dopamine synthesis capacity in the anterior cingulate cortex and posterior midbrain as well as D1 receptor BPnd in the ventral striatum and D2 receptor BPnd in the midbrain. These data provide direct insights into the roles of dopamine synthesis capacity and receptor availability in frontostriatal and midbrain in modulating adaptive behavior in humans.\n\nKeywords: Dopamine, Reward-Based Decision-Making, Patch Foraging.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nM2. Acute Elevation of Corticosterone Enhances Working Memory and Associates With Preserved Cognitive Ability in Aging\n\nJoseph McQuail*, Ashley St. John, Caesar Hernandez, Eric Krause, Barry Setlow, Deborah Scheuer, Jennifer Bizon\n\nUniversity of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, United States\n\nBackground: Working memory, or the ability to transiently hold information “in mind” to support goal-directed behavior, is a foundational cognitive process that requires optimal neural activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The PFC is enriched in glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors that bind the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) and this brain region is highly susceptible to the effects of advancing age. Indeed, impaired working memory is a hallmark of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders and age-related executive dysfunction. In addition to its role in higher order cognition, the PFC innervates limbic and hindbrain nuclei that modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to dynamically regulate circulating CORT levels. As such, the PFC is well positioned to couple affective and cognitive processes. While long-standing theory posits that the cumulative effects of stress precipitate deleterious cognitive and neuroendocrine changes that emerge later in life, little is known about the relationship between stress, HPA axis function, and age-related impairment of working memory. The current study integrated behavioral, pharmacological, and physiological approaches in rats to determine the extent to which CORT signaling influences PFC-dependent working memory and HPA output and also whether HPA integrity is a physiological correlate of working memory in aging.\n\nMethods: All experiments used male, F344 rats at 4-6 mo (young adult) or 22-24 mo (aged). Experiment 1 used a PFC-dependent, delayed response test of working memory to evaluate the consequences of CORT signaling and HPA feedback on cognitive performance in young adult rats (n=5/drug). All drugs were administered via IP injection 30 minutes prior to task performance, using a within-subjects design such that each rat received each dose, with at least a 48 h washout period between successive injections. CORT (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) was used to directly evaluate its effect on working memory ability. Spironolactone (SPIRO; 3-30 mg/kg), a MR antagonist, was used to block HPA negative feedback and elevate circulating CORT. Dexamethasone (DEX; 0.1-1.0 mg/kg), a GR agonist, was used to activate HPA negative feedback and deplete circulating CORT. In Experiment 2, young (n=11) and aged (n=16) rats were characterized for working memory performance on the delayed response task (as in Expt 1) followed by determination of CORT release elicited by 1 hour of restraint stress. CORT was measured in blood samples obtained by tail-bleed during and after restraint. In Experiment 3, two cohorts of young adult rats (n=5-6/drug) were implanted with cannulae directed at the PFC to evaluate the effects of blocking GR (100 ng mifepristone; MIF) or MR (50 ng SPIRO) in the prelimbic (PrL) or infralimbic (IL) subregions of PFC on stress-dependent CORT release (as in Expt 2).\n\nResults: In Experiment 1, 1 mg/kg CORT enhanced working memory performance of young adults. This enhancing effect of CORT on working memory was recapitulated by blocking HPA negative feedback to stimulate CORT release with the MR antagonist SPIRO. Depletion of circulating CORT by activating HPA negative feedback with the GR agonist DEX did not affect working memory. In Experiment 2, individual differences in peak CORT elicited by 1 hour of restraint stress were positively correlated with better working memory performance among aged rats. In Experiment 3, blockade of GR or MR at either the level of the PrL or IL was not sufficient to influence CORT levels during or after recovery from 1 hour of restraint stress.\n\nConclusions: The present findings suggest that the capacity to dynamically elevate CORT/HPA output is beneficial to working memory in both young adult and aged rats. Our studies show that acutely elevating circulating CORT can enhance working memory that depends on the PFC, though CORT is not necessary for normal working memory. Further, a more robust CORT response elicited by exposure to a novel, stressful stimulus was associated with better working memory function in aged rats; age-matched rats with impaired working memory exhibited a relatively diminished CORT response during stress. Despite the significant effects of CORT on working memory supported by the PFC, modulation of neural activity imparted by GR and MRs within this brain region is not sufficient to influence to HPA output in the context of stress. This latter finding suggests that activity in other regulatory centers (i.e. hippocampus or hypothalamus) is required for the modulation of responses to stress. Future work from our lab will examine the basis for CORT’s enhancing effects on working memory and also evaluate the status of CORT receptors in other brain regions that modulate HPA activity in young and aged rats.\n\nKeywords: Corticosteroids, Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis, Prefrontal Cortex, Acute Stress, Cognitive Aging.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nM3. Leukocyte Telomere Length is Associated With Widespread Grey and White Matter Deficits in Early Aging: Impact of Sex and Menopausal Status\n\nEmily Jacobs*, Nikos Makris, Marek Kubicki, Ofer Pasternak, Martha Shenton, Immaculata de Vivo, Jill Goldstein\n\nUniversity of California, Santa Barbara, California, United States\n\nBackground: Leukocyte telomere length (TL) provides an index of cellular age that predicts the incidence of age-related diseases and early mortality in older adults. Leukocyte TL predicts preclinical cognitive decline in the elderly and patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) exhibit shorter TL cross-sectionally relative to healthy individuals. Evidence from a telomerase-deficient mouse model demonstrated the widespread consequences of telomere attrition on neurodegeneration including reduced proliferation of neural progenitor cells, restricted neurogenesis, and atrophy of white matter tracts. These phenotypes were reversed following reactivation of endogenous telomerase activity. While clinical evidence suggests a correlation between chromosomal and neural aging, direct evidence in humans is limited. Previous work from our group provided initial evidence extending the animal findings to humans, demonstrating in a sample of midlife women that TL (and the ratio of TL to telomerase) is associated with hippocampal volume (Jacobs et al, JAMA Neurology 2014). In this new, population-based multi-modal brain imaging study, we characterized the relationship between TL, grey/white matter volume and white matter tractography in men and women to determine whether cellular markers of aging reflect age-related structural brain changes.\n\nMethods: Healthy mid-life adults (N=208, 104 men/104 women; mean age= 49.9; age range 45-55) who are part of a 50-year prospective prenatal cohort were enrolled at Brigham and Women’s Hospital Outpatient Clinical Research Center, where they completed a fasting morning blood draw followed by a structural and functional MRI scan and clinical and cognitive testing. Menstrual cycle histories and serological evaluations were used to determine women’s reproductive stage per STRAW-10 guidelines (premenopause, n=32; perimenopause, n=29; postmenopause, n=31). Automated computational reconstruction of brain surface, cortical thickness maps and segmentation of cortical and subcortical structures was performed on a T1-weighted (MPRAGE) anatomical scan. For the study reported here, regions of interest included the medial temporal lobe (hippocampus, parahippocampus and entorhinal cortex) and rostral middle frontal gyrus. Using Fractional Anisotropy (FA) measures, DTI was used to characterize two white matter fiber connections, the cingulum bundle and the superior longitudinal fascicle II. Leukocyte telomere length was determined by extracting genomic DNA from buffy coats using the QIAmp (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) 96-spin blood protocol and a modified version of the real-time PCR-based telomere assay.\n\nResults: We characterized the relationship between leukocyte TL and structural indices of neuronal aging and examined sex-dependent relationships therein. Regression models were adjusted for established risk factors and potential confounders, including age, BMI and smoking status. When examined across subjects, shorter TL was associated with lower white matter volume in the parahippocampus and rostral middle frontal gyrus. However, analyses by sex revealed that this association was exclusive to men and absent in women. In men, shorter TL was associated with an overall reduction in cortical white matter (left hemisphere, t=2.68, p=.009; right hemisphere, t=2.74, p=.007) as well as regional grey and white matter volume in the parahippocampus (grey matter: left, t=2.28, p=.025; right, t=2.03, p=.045; white matter: left, t=2.94, p=.005; right, t=2.79, p=.006), and prefrontal cortex (rostral middle frontal gyrus, grey matter: left, t=1.8, p=.068 (trend); white matter: left, t=2.74, p=.007; right, t=2.79, p=.006). In women, the relationship between TL and neuronal indices was dependent on women’s reproductive stage. For premenopausal and perimenopausal women, TL was associated with entorhinal cortex white matter (t=2.03, p=.05; t=1.9, p=.064 respectively), a relationship that was no longer evident in postmenopause (t= -.61, p=.55).\n\nConclusions: Preclinical studies showed that reduced telomerase activity and telomere loss have widespread consequences on neurodegeneration, including restricted neurogenesis and atrophy of white matter tracts. Here, we demonstrate that TL is associated with age-related grey and white matter deficits in humans, findings that are sex-dependent and already present in early midlife. Telomere length was associated with widespread neuronal deficits in men, including overall cortical white matter and grey/white matter reductions in the middle temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex. In women, these associations were dependent on menopausal status. Mounting evidence suggests estradiol helps sustain telomerase, telomere length and PFC/HIPP morphology. Taken together, TL could offer a promising early marker of age-related neural deficits, one that is sensitive to sex-dependent aging trajectories.\n\nKeywords: Aging, Leukocyte Telomere Length, Neurodegeneration, Human Neuroimaging, Sex Differences.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nM4. Decreased FADD Protein is Associated With Clinical Dementia and Cognitive Decline in a Community Sample\n\nM Julia Garcia-Fuster*, Alfredo Ramos-Miguel, Alasdair M Barr, Sue E Leurgans, Julie A Schneider, David A Bennett, William G Honer, Jesus A Garcia-Sevilla\n\nUniversity of the Balearic Islands, Palma de Mallorca, Spain\n\nBackground: FADD (Fas-associated death domain) adaptor is a crucial protein involved in the induction of cell death but also mediates non-apoptotic actions (cell survival, differentiation and neuroplasticity) via a phosphorylated form (p-Ser194-FADD). Multifunctional FADD works in vivo as a common and major signaling step in the initial activation of structurally different receptors (e.g. neurotransmitter G protein-coupled receptors and receptor channels). Although FADD has a crucial role during embryogenesis/ development, little is known about its expression or functions as the brain ages. This study investigated the possible association of FADD forms with the presence and severity of cognitive decline and increased risk of dementia in an elderly community sample.\n\nMethods: FADD forms were quantified by western blot analysis in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) samples from a large cohort of participants in a community-based aging study (Memory and Aging Project, MAP), experiencing no-(NCI, n=51) or mild-(MCI, n=42) cognitive impairment, or clinical dementia (n=57). The possible contribution of FADD regulation to the full range of age-related cognitive impairment was also evaluated.\n\nResults: Pro-apoptotic FADD protein was decreased (-42%, p<0.01) while p-FADD was unaltered in the DLPFC of subjects with dementia as compared to NCI subjects. Using linear and logistic regression models taking into account age, education and sex, postmortem interval, APOE genotype, multiple age-related pathologies (i.e., amyloid plaques, tangles, Lewy bodies, cerebrovascular diseases, hippocampal sclerosis), and overall synapse density, higher FADD levels in the DLPFC were associated with decreased likelihood of clinical dementia as well as better global cognitive function in MAP participants (p<0.01 for both associations).\n\nConclusions: Contrarily to what we initially expected, pro-apoptotic FADD was decreased in an elderly, community-based cohort subjects with dementia. Interestingly, loss of FADD in the DLPFC was associated with cognitive decline and increased risk of dementia in a community sample. The discovery of biomarkers for diagnosis and for a sensitive assessment of the progression of clinical dementia associated with aging is an important area of current research.\n\nKeywords: Biomarkers, Aging and Dementia, Postmortem Human Brain.\n\nDisclosure: Supported by SAF2014-55903-R and ‘Ramón y Cajal’ Program to M.J.G.-F.

A Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Study of Neurogenesis Enhancers in Persons With Subjective Cognitive Impairment: Electrophysiologic Results in the First 5 Study Subjects After 2 Years of Treatment and at 6 Month Follow-Up\n\nBarry Reisberg*, Melanie Shulman, Francoise Guillo Benarous, Anaztasia Ulysse, Thet Oo, Jaskirat Sidhu, Ayesha Atif, Alok Vedvyas, Leslie Prichep\n\nNYU Alzheimer's Disease Center, New York, New York, United States\n\nBackground: Neurogenesis refers to the production of new neurons in the brain. This process was first reported in humans in 1998 (Eriksson, et al, Nat Med). For reasons related to safety, this process could not be confirmed in humans until 2013 (Spalding, et al, Cell). All antidepressant medications are believed to be neurogenesis enhancers. Recent studies have also related serotonergic medication with lower mean cortical binding potential by PET PIB imaging in human brains (Cirrito, et al, PNAS, 2011), and decreased cerebrospinal fluid Aß concentrations (Sheline, et al, Sci Transl Med, 2014).\n\nWe hypothesized that antidepressants might slow the progression of decline in persons with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), a pre-mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of eventual Alzheimer’s disease beginning ~ 22 years before mild dementia occurs, and lasting for ~15 years prior to the advent of MCI (Reisberg and Gauthier, Int psychogeriatr, 2008; Reisberg et al, Alzheimers and Dement, 2008). Accordingly, we have been conducting a double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized study of two neurogenesis enhancer antidepressant medications, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), Lexapro, and a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), Effexor ER (brand medications are used).\n\nMethods: Subjects are treated with identically appearing tablets of Lexapro, 5 mg, Effexor XR, 37.5 mg, or placebo at baseline. Dosing is titrated by a clinician who is blinded to the specific treatments for a two-year period, after which the treatment is tapered and discontinued. Subjects are re-evaluated at 6 months post-treatment. One primary outcome, reported herein, is quantitative EEG (Q-EEG) values. We have previously reported remarkable sensitivity for these measures in predicting outcome in SCI persons over a 7-9 year follow-up. Using logistic regression, an R square of 0.93 (p<0.001) was obtained between baseline Q-EEG features and probability of future decline, with an overall predictive accuracy of 90% (Prichep, et al, Neurobiol Aging, 2006). Q-EEG results are reported herein for 6 brain regions, the left (L) and right (R) hippocampus, L and R superior/transverse temporal cortex, and the L and R dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\n\nResults: We previously reported results for the first 2 study subjects who had been randomized to Effexor XR and treated primarily with 2, 37.5 mg tablets and Lexapro 2, 5 mg tablets, respectively, over the course of the study. The Lexapro treated subject, KR, showed significant (p<0.01) improvement on the left side in the 3 brain regions studied at the 2-year follow-up (p<0.001 for the L hippocampus and p<0.00001 for the L superior/ transverse temporal cortex). This improvement was present in one region at the 6-month post study evaluation, the L superior/transverse temporal cortex (p<0.001). No significant changes were observed with Effexor XR. We now report results in 3 placebo treated subjects (JH, LN, and DG). JH and LN did not show significant changes in Q-EEG in any of the 6 brain regions at the 2 year follow up. DG showed significant worsening in the L dorsolateral/prefrontal cortex (p<0.01). None of the 3 placebo treated subjects showed significant changes from baseline to 2.5 years.\n\nConclusions: Subject KR, who received Lexapro, reported at the 2-year visit “Everything seems better … more acute memory… less forgetting… quicker recall.” Hence, from electrophysiologic and subjective perspectives, the current results for possible utility of Lexapro treatment of SCI are encouraging.\n\nKeywords: Neurogenesis Enhancers, Electrophysiology, Subjective Cognitive Impairment, Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nDisclosure: United States Patent and Trademark Office: Pending Patent, Self; Stringer Foundation: Research Grant, Self; Hagedorn Fund: Research Grant, Self; Louis J.

Differential Fear Conditioning is Associated With Anterior Insula GABA in PTSD\n\nIsabelle Rosso*, Elizabeth Olson, Olga Nazarenko, Edward Pace-Schott, Scott Rauch, J. Eric Jensen\n\nMcLean Hospital, Belmont, Massachusetts, United States\n\nBackground: Enhanced fear conditioning and deficient differentiation of danger and safety signals have been implicated in the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Functional imaging studies have consistently implicated the anterior insula (AI) in the acquisition of conditioned fear, and there is emerging evidence that the AI may be involved in discriminative fear learning. In PTSD and anxiety-related disorders, the right AI is thought to contribute to anticipating future aversive physiological responses to conditioned stimuli (Paulus and Stein, 2006), and to predicting how the relative value of stimuli might affect bodily states. In this study, we examined whether differential fear conditioning differed between adults with PTSD, trauma-exposed non-PTSD (TENC), and healthy comparison (HC) subjects. We also tested the hypothesis that individual differences in autonomic indices of differential fear conditioning would be associated with right AI neurochemistry, specifically markers of excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory (GABA) metabolism using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).\n\nMethods: This sample included 30 PTSD, 21 TENC, and 26 HC adult participants who completed both single-voxel 3T MRS and a two-day fear conditioning paradigm. All participants were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, and PTSD and TENC participants also received the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale. MRS spectra were collected from a 2 X 2 X 3 ml right anterior insula voxel using a MEGAPRESS sequence for detection of GABA, and 2DJPRESS editing for glutamate (Glu). Both metabolites were normalized to creatine (Cr). The fear conditioning paradigm involved an acquisition phase with 16 paired presentations of conditioned stimuli (CS+) with the unconditioned stimulus (US, shock), and 16 trials of another conditioned stimulus (CS-) never paired with the US. Skin conductance response (SCR) was recorded as a peripheral indicator of conditioned fear; differential fear conditioning was defined as SCR to each CS+ minus SCR to its temporally closest CS- during the conditioning phase.\n\nResults: PTSD patients had significantly less differential fear conditioning than HC (t(54)=-2.32, p=.02) but not TENC (t(49)=-0.76, p=.45) participants. GABA/Cr and Glu/Cr levels in the right AI did not differ significantly between groups. There was a significant correlation of differential SCR with GABA/Cr (r=0.36, n=77, p=.0013) in the sample as a whole, such that participants whose SCRs showed stronger differentiation between CS+ and CS- trials had higher right AI GABA. Follow-up analyses identified similar effect sizes when this correlation was examined separately in PTSD patients (r=0.35, n=30, p=.06), TENC subjects (r=0.31, n=21, p=.17), and HC participants (r=0.41, n=26, p=.04). Glu/Cr was not significantly associated with the SCR index of differential fear conditioning (r=.06, n=77, p=.58).\n\nConclusions: Higher anterior insula GABA measured by MRS was associated with greater differential fear conditioning in adults with and without PTSD. These findings support a role for the right AI in the detection and encoding of stimulus relevance that is acquired through differential fear conditioning, and are consistent with this region’s broader role in the anticipation of aversion.\n\nKeywords: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Insula, GABA, Fear Conditioning.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nM7. Mother to Infant Transmission of Fear Through Maternal Alarm Calls: The Involvement of the Amygdala, the Glucocorticoid and the Noradrenergic Systems\n\nDa-Jeong Chang, Sophie Numbers, Joanna Hider, Amanda White, Jacek Debiec*\n\nUniversity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, United States\n\nBackground: Fear and anxiety may be transmitted to subsequent generations and potentiate the emergence of mental disorders. One of the ways fear may be transferred across generations is social fear learning. In social fear learning, children exposed to their caretakers expressing fear, acquire their fear responses. Using a rat model, we previously demonstrated that frightened mother passes fear to her pups though alarm odor (Debiec & Sullivan, 2014; Chang & Debiec, 2016). Here we show that maternal alarm 22 kHz calls paired with a neutral odor produce in rat pups fear responses to this odor. This fear transmission is associated with increased activity of the pup's amygdala and is modulated by glucocorticoid and noredrenergic systems.\n\nMethods: Rats pups at postnatal day 18 were isolated from their mother and presented with 11 pairings of pre-recorded 30 s maternal 22 kHz stress vocalizations (delivered by Ultrasonic Dynamic Speaker Vifa) paired with the peppermint odor delivered by a flow dilution olfactometer controlled by FreezeFrame software (2 L/min flow rate, 1:10 CS odor:air). Controls were pups matched for age that were presented with the equivalent number of peppermint odor exposures without stress vocalizations. On the test day, all pups were re-exposed to the peppermint odor and their freezing responses during the odor presentation were recorded and scored. In a subsequent experiment, we analyzed neural activity of the pup's brain during the 22 kHz stress vocalizations - peppermint odor pairings using the early expression c-Fos gene expression. In a series experiments, using pretraining systemic injections of either saline (controls) or corticosterone synthesis inhibitor metyrapone or beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol we investigated the role of the glucocorticoid and noradrenergic systems in the mother-child fear transmission using alarm vocalizations. Statistical analysis was performed using Student t test. Differences were considered significant when P< 0.05.\n\nResults: Pups exposed to maternal alarm calls paired with a neutral odor (n=7) compared to pups exposed to the neutral odor alone (n= 6) were showing higher levels of freezing responses to this odor on the following day (P< 0.05). Additional experiments showed that an exposure to maternal alarms calls (but not to the neutral odor alone) was associated with increased c-Fos expression in the amygdala nuclei, auditory thalamus, auditory cortex, hypothalamic regions and the periaqueductal grey. Pretraining infusions of metyrapone or propranolol prevented the transmission of fear using maternal alarms calls.\n\nConclusions: Our data show that pups may acquire fear responses to the neural odor paired with maternal alarm calls. This transmission is associated with increased amygdala activity and is modulated by the gluococortocid and noradrenergic systems. Elucidating the behavioral, neural and molecular mechanisms of parent-child fear transmission may inform the development of novel therapeutic and preventive methods.\n\nKeywords: Fear, Infancy, Maternal Behavior, Glucocorticoids, Noradrenergic.\n\nDisclosure: Supported by: K08 MH014743-01A1, NARSAD Young Investigator Award by Brain & Behavior Research Foundation and Todd Ouida Clinical Scholar Award in Childhood Anxiety and Depression to JD.\n\nM8. A Roadmap to Medication Assisted Augmentation of Psychotherapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder\n\nEric Vermetten*, Harm Krugers, Steven Kushner\n\nLeiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands\n\nBackground: Several psychotherapeutic procedures have been identified for the treatment of PTSD, most are exposure based. Their procedures typically overlap and induce traumatic stress in a safe environment. Patients are confronted by increasingly difficult feared situations while applying cognitive restructuring techniques and forms of avoidance strategies. While these therapies are used as first line interventions, a significant number of patients fail to respond optimally to these interventions.\n\nRecently several compounds have been identified to be used in conjunction with this procedure, e.g. the finding that the NMDA receptor complex is critical for associative learning has spearheaded the launch of several new studies in which NMDA antagonists are used to enhance fear extinction employing diverse paradigms. D-cycloserine is one of the compounds since this binds to the glycine site at the NMDA receptor and has therefore clinical potential in augmenting responses to cognitive and behavioural therapies. But also the glucocorticoid and adrenergic signaling systems are targets of novel investigational approaches. These go beyond treatment for the disorder as stand alone treatment, but demonstrated their effect in close conjunction with psychotherapy. Medication provided before or after exposure therapy can enhance outcome by: 1) strengthening learning and memory of fear extinction; 2) disrupting reconsolidation, thereby weakening fear memories; or 3) facilitating engagement in psychotherapy by reducing fear and enhancing openness to experience.\n\nMethods: While this novel medication assisted psychotherapy offers an important opportunity to target these emotional memories and the expression of fear, and there is some validation from clinical studies, there is currently a need for roadmap that will assist in identification and evaluation of these compounds in their efficacy in treatment for PTSD. (This work is part of the Traumatic Stress Network of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology). Trials are evaluating modulation of neurosteroids, glutamate, GABA, endocannabinoids, oxytocin, neurokinin/Substance P, and dopamine. Yet, for these studies it is not known what the optimal dosing is, as well as what parameters need to be addressed to assess their clinical utility for the treatment of PTSD.\n\nResults: This paper identifies compounds to be used in medication-assisted augmentation of psychotherapy for PTSD. In addition, parameters are identified that need to be monitored in order to assess the efficacy of the intervention. For these parameters, a roadmap is constructed that identifies the essential study design that is needed to assess the efficacy of the intervention: study population, time of administration, mode of administration, dosing, therapeutic strategy, identification of SUDS/emotional involvement during therapy, assessment of outcome and follow-up. The following potential compounds will be discussed: propranolol (adrenergic beta-receptor), hydrocortisone (GR receptor), D-Cycloserin (part agonist at glycine site of NMDA receptor), Ketamine (NMDA receptor antagonist), oxytocine (oxytocine receptors) and MDMA (serotonin and norepinephrine transporters, oxytocine release), LSD (D2 receptor, serotonin receptor).\n\nConclusions: We conclude that several compounds exist that are or will be investigated in the near future for medication-assisted augmentation of psychotherapy for PTSD. Reconsolidation represents an interesting opportunity to modify or alter fear and fear-related memories. Also compounds that facilitate the engagement in therapy by reducing fear may be targeted for a specific population. These interventions require careful planning, and collaboration with prescribers. This roadmap will assist in moving the field forward in terms of design, dosage as well as effectivity and augmentation strategies for treatment of PTSD.\n\nKeywords: Roadmap, Medication, Psychotherapy, PTSD.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nM9. Neurotensin Differentially Modulates Positive and Negative Associations in Basolateral Amygdala Circuits\n\nPraneeth Namburi*, Anna Beyeler, Gwendolyn Calhoon, Ada Felix-Ortiz, Suzuko Yorozu, Christopher Leppla, Kun Yi Li, Jesse Gray, Kay Tye\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States\n\nBackground: The ability to differentiate between stimuli that predict rewarding and threatening outcomes, and engaging the appropriate behavioral response is critical for survival. The Basolateral Amygdala (BLA) is an almond shaped structure in the brain where different populations of neurons encode positive and negative associations. BLA neurons that differ in their long-range anatomical connectivity play opposing roles in the acquisition of positive and negative associations. BLA neurons orchestrate several behaviors via their long-range connections with diverse structures in the brain. The connection between the BLA and the nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been implicated during positive behaviors, whereas the connection between the BLA and the centromedial nucleus of the amygdala (CeM) has been implicated during negative behaviors. Inputs to NAc- and CeM-projecting BLA neurons (BLA-NAc and BLA-CeM neurons) undergo opposing changes in synaptic transmission after acquiring positive and negative associations. Reward-related associations increase synaptic transmission onto BLA-NAc neurons and decrease synaptic transmission onto BLA-CeM neuron, whereas fear-related associations increase synaptic transmission onto BLA-CeM neurons and decrease synaptic transmission onto BLA-NAc neurons.\n\nHowever, the mechanisms underlying these opposing changes in synaptic transmission are yet to be elucidated. In this work, we identify that the action of a neuropeptide known as Neurotensin in the BLA has the potential to modulate positive and negative associations through opposing modulation of synaptic transmission onto functionally-distinct BLA neural populations.\n\nMethods: We used RNA-Seq to profile the transcriptomes of BLA-NAc and BLA-CeM neurons.\n\nWe used in vivo pharmacology to test the functional role of neurotensin-1 receptor (NTSR1), one of the differentially expressed genes. NTSR1 antagonist was infused into the BLA prior to the association of a tone with either a sucrose reward or an aversive footshock, and the memory was tested a day later.\n\nWe used ex vivo whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology and induced long-term potentiation (LTP) either in BLA-NAc or BLA-CeM neurons, both in the presence and absence of NT in the bath.\n\nWe searched for potential sources of NT to the BLA using the Allen Brain Atlas, and identified the posterior thalamus as a candidate source of NT to the BLA. We confirmed the existence of functional synapses from posterior thalamic NT neurons in the BLA using ex vivo whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. We expressed Channelrhosopsin-2 (ChR2) selectively in posterior thalamic NT neurons using an NT:Cre mouse, and evoked synaptic release in the BLA using light. Monosynaptic currents were evoked from NT axons in the BLA by blocking action potentials using the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) and enabling light-evoked synaptic release by blocking the voltage-activated hyperpolarizing potassium channels using 4-Aminopyridine (4-AP).\n\nWe used in vivo electrophysiology and identified posterior thalamic NT-expressing neurons using photostimulation in mice expressing ChR2 in posterior thalamic NT neurons. Neural activity was sampled during positive and negative associations.\n\nResults: Profiling the transcriptome using RNA-seq provided a list of candidate genes that were differentially expressed between BLA-NAc and BLA-CeM neurons, including the neurotensin receptor -1 (NTSR1). Upon examination of the functional role of the NTSR1 antagonist, we found that NTSR1 blockade in the BLA selectively impaired reward, but not fear, learning. Indeed, neurotensin differentially modulated transmission, as reflected by EPSC amplitude in BLA-NAc and BLA-CeM neurons. In the presence of NT, spike-timing dependent induction of long-term potentiation onto BLA-NAc neurons was reduced, whereas LTP onto BLA-CeM neurons was enhanced. Monosynaptic currents evoked by posterior thalamic NT axons onto BLA neurons were blocked with a glutamate receptor blocker NBQX, indicating that the posterior thalamic NT neurons co-release glutamate onto BLA neurons. Using single unit recordings, we discovered that posterior thalamic neurons, both NT-expressing and unidentified neurons encoded tone onsets and offsets, port entries to consume sucrose solution, as well as foot shocks. However, during the association of a tone with sucrose reward, posterior thalamic NT neurons showed greater responses to port entries, relative to unidentified neurons in the posterior thalamus.\n\nConclusions: In conclusion, we have discovered that divergent populations of neurons in the BLA are differentially sensitive to NT, a neuropeptide whose action modulates BLA-mediated learning. Moreover, we identify the posterior thalamus as a source of NT to the BLA, characterize the response properties of these neurons, and provide initial evidence of a circuit mechanism whereby NT-expressing thalamic neurons likely impact the activity of BLA neurons during positive and negative associations.\n\nKeywords: Basolateral Amygdala, Neurotensin, Valence.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nM10. Social Modulation of Conditioned and Innate Fear Responses\n\nVanessa Gutzeit, Meghin Sadsad, Tabia Santos, Samantha Ong, Rene Hen, Christine Denny, Zoe Donaldson*\n\nColumbia University, New York, New York, United States\n\nBackground: Amongst social animals, the presence of a conspecific companion can have powerful effects on mood and behavior. In particular, the social modulation of fear and anxiety represents a highly conserved trait, as both humans and rodents display decreases in anxiety and stress responses when an affiliative conspecific is present. However, the neural processes underlying this social buffering phenomenon remain largely unknown.\n\nMethods: Our group has found that in mice, conspecific presence decreases freezing in both conditioned and innately fearful contexts. In order to identify neural populations that may contribute to social buffering of fear responses, we used a mouse line in which neurons expressing the immediate early gene, Arc, are indelibly labeled following interaction with a novel conspecific. Using this line, we optogenetically re-activated socially-labelled cells in order to test the hypothesis that these neuronal populations may mediate the social modulation of fear responses.\n\nResults: We identified a subset of cells within the infralimbic prefrontal cortex (ILPFC) of male and female mice that are labeled in response to interacting with a novel, ovariectomized female conspecific but not in response to a toy mouse, novel object, or food reward. Optogenetic activation of conspecific-labeled ChR2-eYFP+ neurons decreases freezing in conditioned and innately fearful contexts, without impacting locomotion, recapitulating the effects of conspecific presence.\n\nConclusions: These data suggest that activation of neurons associated with an affiliative conspecific in the ILPFC may be sufficient to mediate the effects of conspecific presence on fear responses. Thus, targeting this cell population may provide novel therapeutic opportunities that harness circuits naturally engaged by social interaction in order to treat fear and anxiety-related disorders.\n\nKeywords: Social Buffering, Optogenetics, Fear.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nM11. Intranasal Administration of Neuropeptide Y in Patients With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Single Ascending Dose Study\n\nJames Murrough*, Seharish Sayed, Nicholas Van Dam, Sarah Horn, Marin Kautz, Sara Costi, Katherine Collins, Brian Iacoviello, Michael Parides, Aleksander Mathe, Dan Iosifescu, Adriana Feder, Dennis Charney\n\nIcahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States\n\nBackground: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common and disabling psychiatric condition and current treatments possess only limited efficacy. Safe, more effective, and mechanistically novel medications are urgently needed for the treatment of PTSD and other stress-related disorders such as major depressive disorder. A large body of work implicates the neuropeptide Y (NPY) system as a critical regulator of stress and fear-related behaviors, and as a promising therapeutic focus for PTSD. Therapeutic development of NPY and other peptides is limited by lack of passage of NPY across the blood-brain barrier, and by the digestion of peptides within the gastrointestinal tract. Prior work suggests that intranasal delivery may represent a viable delivery route for peptide-based therapeutics. The current study, therefore, was designed to assess the safety and initial efficacy of ascending doses of NPY delivered via an intranasal route in patients with PTSD.\n\nMethods: We conducted a proof of concept randomized, double blind, crossover single ascending dose study of NPY in patients with PTSD. The study featured a hybrid dose escalation design in which cohorts of three patients were treated at each dosing level beginning with the lowest study dose (1.4 mg); at the point at which a dose limiting toxicity was observed, the study switched to a continual reassessment method in which subsequent patients were assigned to one of five pre-specified dose levels (1.4 mg, 2.8 mg, 4.6 mg, 6.8 mg, and 9.6 mg) according to a Bayesian dose-toxicity model. NPY (Bachen, Bubendorf, Switzerland) was dissolved in saline and delivered via nasal drug delivery device (Kurve Technology, Bothell, Washington). Each patient underwent baseline assessments and was dosed with NPY or saline placebo on two separate treatment days that occurred one to two weeks apart. On each treatment day, patients underwent a trauma script provocation procedure 30 min following drug dosing and completed assessments throughout the day. Measures of anxiety [Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)] and PTSD [Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R)] were acquired and comparison of change from baseline to immediately post-trauma script between NPY and placebo at different dose levels represented the analytic approach to detect efficacy.\n\nResults: Twenty-six patients with PTSD were randomized in the study and received at least one dose of NPY or placebo. Two patients discontinued subsequent to the first treatment day and were not crossed over. Therefore 24 subjects completed the study at the following dosing levels: 1.4 mg (n=3), 2.8 mg (n=6), 4.6 mg (n=5), 6.8 mg (n=6), and 9.6 mg (n=6) as dictated by the dose escalation algorithm. NPY was well tolerated up to and including the highest dose of 9.6 mg; the study did not identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Repeated measures ANCOVAs showed a trend towards a significant drug x time x dose interaction for the BAI [F(5, 100)= 1.95, p= .092] and a significant drug x time x dose interaction for the IES-R [F(5, 100)= 2.39, p= .042]. To examine these interactions, we compared change in scores in low dose (1.4 mg, 2.8 mg, 4.6 mg; n=13) and high dose (6.8 mg, 9.6 mg; n=11) groups, respectively. In the high dose group, there were significant increases in BAI [t(10)=2.98, p= .014],and IES-R [t(10)= 2.73, p= .021] under placebo but not NPY, indicating that NPY may have an anxiolytic and stress decreasing effect. In contrast, there were no significant increases in scores for either NPY or placebo in the low dose group. These data are suggestive of a therapeutic signal at the high but not low dose, although the study had low power to detect dose-related efficacy effects.\n\nConclusions: Herein we report results of a single ascending dose study of intranasal NPY in patients with PTSD. We show that doses up to and including 9.6 mg are well tolerated and without toxicity; the MTD was not identified. We found a preliminary efficacy signal at higher NPY doses. Additional studies exploring the safety, efficacy, and target engagement of NPY in humans are warranted.\n\nKeywords: Traumatic Stress, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, Resilience, Neuropeptide Y, Early Phase Drug Development.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nM12. Prefrontal Cortical mGluR5 Availability in PTSD: Preliminary Findings From a [18F]FPEB PET Study\n\nSophie Holmes*, Matthew Girgenti, Robert Pietrzak, DellaGioia Nicole, Nabulsi Nabeel, Matuskey David, Southwick Steven, Carson Richard, Krystal John, Esterlis Irina\n\nYale University, New Haven, Connecticut, United States\n\nBackground: The lifetime prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the US is approximately 8% (Kilpatrick et al. 2013). PTSD is characterized by a constellation of symptoms including intrusion symptoms, avoidance, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and hyperarousal. PTSD is associated with a dysregulation in threat-related processing, namely hyperarousal of the amygdala and reduced inhibitory control of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, relatively little is known about the molecular underpinnings of this disorder. The ability of the metabotropic glutamatergic receptors (mGluRs) to modulate neuronal excitability in brain circuits involved in anxiety and stress has made them a promising target for drug development for psychiatric disorders (Krystal et al. 2010). Here we focus on the mGluR5 as the potential target for the reduction of PTSD symptomatology. Blockade of mGluR5 has been found to produce anxiolytic effects in animal models (Swanson et al. 2005) and modulation of mGluR5 has been implicated in fear extinction (Fontanez-Nuin et al. 2011). However, to date the mGluR5 has not been investigated in individuals with PTSD in-vivo. Using positron emission tomography (PET) and the radioligand [18F]FPEB, which has high selectivity and specificity for mGluR5, we aimed to quantify mGluR5 availability in individuals with PTSD. Additionally, in a postmortem sample of individuals with PTSD and controls, we aimed to investigate expression of proteins that have a functional relationship with mGluR5 and glucocorticoid (GC) function, which is implicated in PTSD.\n\nMethods: Ten individuals with PTSD (age=34±8years) and 10 age-, sex-, and smoking status-matched healthy controls (age=35±9years) participated in one [18F]FPEB PET scan and a comprehensive clinical assessment. Volume of distribution (VT: the ratio of activity in tissue relative to that in blood) in grey matter PFC regions was computed using a venous input function. The radiotracer was injected as bolus plus constant infusion and subjects were scanned during steady state (90-120mins post-injection). Using postmortem brain tissue from the PTSD Brain Bank, massively parallel RNA-sequencing was performed on Brodmanns Area 25 (part of vmPFC and anterior cingulate) in 19 individuals with PTSD and 19 matched controls. Transcriptome profiles were generated from the sequencing data and were interrogated for mGluR5 and GC related transcripts.\n\nResults: We observed higher mGluR5 density in individuals with PTSD compared to controls in regions of the PFC [ventromedial PFC (vmPFC; 18% higher; Cohen’s d=0.85), dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC; 19% higher; Cohen’s d=0.86) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; 19% higher; Cohen’s d=0.86). There was a positive correlation between mGluR5 density and severity of depressive symptoms (vmPFC r=0.73, p=0.02, dlPFC r=0.72, p=0.02 and OFC r=0.73, p=0.02). In the postmortem sample, we found an increased expression of Shank-1 (1.8 fold increase, Q<0.01) in individuals with PTSD compared to controls. Conversely, we observed decreased SGK1 (-2.3, Q<0.01) and FKB5 (-2.5), Q< 0.02) expression in PTSD as compared to controls.\n\nConclusions: Our in vivo evaluation of mGluR5 availability in individuals with PTSD indicated a nearly 20% higher PFC mGluR5 availability as compared to controls. Of clinical relevance, higher mGluR5 availability was associated with a greater depressive symptomatology in PTSD, which might also reflect a greater severity of PTSD itself. In fact, inverse agonism of mGluR5 has been suggested for preventive treatment of acute- and PTSD (Tronson et al. 2010). Consistent with an upregulation of mGluR5, we found an upregulation of Shank-1 in an independent sample of postmortem brain tissue, a protein which anchors mGluR5 receptors to the cell surface. We also replicated our previous finding of decreased SGK-1 in PTSD (Licznerski et al. 2015). In animals, cortisol upregulates SGK-1 (Anacker et al. 2013) and corticosterone administration has been shown to reduce mGluR5 expression (Besheer et al. 2014). Taking this together with evidence for lower cortisol levels in PTSD (Meewisse et al. 2007), one explanation for our findings is that deficits in cortisol signaling in PTSD could contribute to the upregulation in mGluR5 by upregulating Shank1. While further work is needed to confirm our findings in a larger sample and clarify the relationship between mGluR5 and GCs in vivo, our findings suggest that the mGluR5 may be implicated in the pathophysiology of PTSD and represent a novel target for drug development.\n\nKeywords: PTSD, PET Imaging, Glutamate Receptor Activity.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nM13. Characterizing Extended Amygdala Neuron Populations in Primates as a Basis for Exploring Altered Ce and BST Function in Anxiety\n\nRothem Kovner*, Andrew Fox, Tade Souaiaia, Patrick H Roseboom, Delores A French, Jonathan A Oler, Julie Fudge, James A Knowles, Ned Kalin\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, United States\n\nBackground: Alterations in extended amygdala (EA) function have been linked to stress-related psychopathology, including anxiety and depressive disorders. Our laboratory has developed a non-human primate (NHP) model of anxious temperament (AT) as a means to investigate the neural and molecular mechanisms underlying the childhood risk to develop anxiety and depression. In preadolescent rhesus monkeys, we demonstrated that two major nodes of the EA, the central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce) and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST), are key regions in the neural circuitry mediating AT. The Ce and BST are primarily composed of striatal-like medium spiny GABAergic neurons that can be subdivided into multiple subtypes based on their neuropeptide profile. Importantly, some studies in rodents demonstrate an uneven anterior-posterior (A-P) distribution of neuropeptide expression in the lateral subdivision of the Ce (CeL); however, little is known about the functional significance of this gradient in expression and whether this is a feature of neuropeptide distribution in the EA of NHPs. To further understand the cellular and molecular alterations in the EA that mediate AT it is critical: 1) to understand the extent to which EA GABAergic neurons are similar to or different from striatal GABAergic neurons and 2) to use these data to characterize cell types that are more highly expressed in and across the A-P extent of the Ce and the BST.\n\nMethods: To examine selectivity in EA gene expression, we first used human and monkey microarray data from the Allen Brain Atlas to identify genes that are more highly expressed in Ce compared to striatum (putamen and caudate). We then validated these findings using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) in rhesus tissue samples from our NHP brain bank. Because somatostatin (SST) and cholecystokinin (CCK) were both more highly expressed in Ce than the striatum and the previous rodent studies demonstrating a role for these neuropeptides in mediating aspects of threat responding, we focused on these neuropeptides in the NHP EA. In situ hybridization was used in 4 rhesus monkeys (mean age= 9.55, 3 female) to characterize the expression of SST and CCK mRNA within amygdala and BST. Additionally, we characterized the distribution of SST and CCK mRNA across the A-P extents of the CeL and the corresponding dorsal lateral division of the BST (BSTLd). Finally, immunohistochemical staining methods were used to characterize the distribution of protein expression in relation to the mRNA expression studies.\n\nResults: Confirming results from the Allen Brain Institute databases, RNA-Seq analyses identified many neuropeptides with significantly greater expression in the Ce as compared to striatal regions. SST and CCK were among the neuropeptides that were more highly expressed in Ce. In situ hybridization for SST and CCK revealed that SST and CCK are distributed throughout the amygdala. With focus on the EA distribution of these peptides, CeL SST expression was significantly correlated with A-P position, such that higher expression was found in the posterior CeL (F4, 30=19.29, p=0.02). A similar gradient in SST expression was not observed in the BSTLd. Furthermore, CCK distribution was not significantly associated with A-P position in either CeL or BSTLd.\n\nConclusions: Using existing databases in combination with our rhesus monkey RNA-Seq data, we characterized genes that are preferentially expressed in the Ce as compared to the striatum. This approach provides a foundation for more in depth investigation of EA GABAergic neuronal subtypes. In addition, these studies demonstrate the value of examining the distribution of mRNA and protein expression across the A-P extent of the NHP CeL and BSTLd. Understanding the functional relevance of differences in the A-P expression of neuropeptide-expressing populations that are enriched in the primate EA will help direct cellular and molecular studies aimed at understanding the function of these neuropeptides, and guide the development of target-specific novel therapeutics.\n\nKeywords: Anxiety, Extended Amygdala, Neuroanatomy.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nM14. Altered Dynamic Brain EEG Connectivity in Social Anxiety Disorder\n\nOlusola Ajilore*, Mengqi Xing, Annmarie MacNamara, Ouri Wolfson, K Luan Phan, Heide Klumpp, Alex Leow\n\nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, United States\n\nBackground: Inspired by the Nash embedding theorems, which showed that any compact Riemannian n-manifold can be isometrically embedded in a Euclidean space of dimension 2n+1, and by Theorema Egregium, which showed that the Gauss curvature of a 2-manifold embedded in 3D depends only on the first fundamental form and is thus invariant when it is bent without stretched or torn (i.e., complete isometric mappings preserve the Gauss curvature), the goal of proposed study was to understand the manifold properties or the intrinsic geometry of the brain’s state-space. Furthermore, we explored whether these manifold properties differed in participants with social anxiety disorder (SAD) compared to healthy comparison subjects using dynamic electroencephalography (EEG) connectivity during an emotion regulation task.\n\nMethods: EEG data were collected from 20 healthy participants (age: 26.95±9.64, 8M, 12F) and 20 participants with SAD (age: 26.9±8.43, 8M, 12F) using the Biosemi system (Biosemi, Amsterdam, Netherlands) with an elastic cap with 34 scalp channels. Each participant underwent one session of the Emotion Regulation Task (ERT). During the ERT, participants were asked to look at pictures displayed on the screen, and listen to a corresponding auditory guide. Two types of pictures were on display for seven seconds in random orders: emotionally neutral pictures (landscape, everyday objects, etc.) and negative pictures (car crash, nature disasters, etc.). After the picture was displayed for one second, participants were instructed to “look”: viewing the neutral pictures; to “maintain”: viewing the negative pictures as they normally would; or to “reappraise”: viewing the negative pictures while attempting to reduce their emotion response by reinterpreting the meaning of pictures. EEG data were preprocessed using Brain Vision Analyzer (Brain Products, Gilching Germany), by first segmenting task trials into 7-second segments with a window size of 0.05s (the first and last 5 time points were discarded, resulting in 130 time points per task; resting state data was similarly preprocessed). Frequencies-of-interest were set from 1Hz to 50Hz in increments of 1Hz. The final output of each subject was averaged over trials within the same task. As functional communication between two brain regions result in synchronized or phase-coupled EEG readouts, in this study we used weighted phase lag index (WPLI) computed between the times series of two channels to form EEG connectomes (each of which a symmetric 34 by 34 matrix). In order to learn the intrinsic geometry of a high-dimensional manifold, the EEG connectomes from all subjects at all time points were used to sample possible states of the manifold that is shared among all subjects. Then, graph dissimilarity space embedding is used to represent each connectome as a point in a very high-dimensional space (number of dimensions equal to the number of connectiomes for each subject at each timepoint). This is then followed by 1) manifold learning via local neighborhood reconstruction and 2) manifold embedding into a lower dimensional Euclidean space using nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NDR). Once this is achieved, thought chart of any given individual can be constructed by tracing the trajectory of the time-dependent connectome of that subject for any given task. Manifold properties can be quantified by measuring the trajectory length of a given subject's thought chart or the \"spread\", the area occupied by a given subject's thought chart in the state-space. We examined group differences for trajectory length and spread in the state-space during the ERT and correlations with measures of anxiety severity (Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale: LSAS and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety: HAM-A).\n\nResults: Participants with SAD had significantly greater trajectory lengths and spread with all aspects of the ERT (neutral, maintain, reappraise) (p< .0001). Furthermore, trajectory length and spread associated with all aspects of the ERT correlated with anxiety severity scores in the total sample (length x HAM-A: neutral r= .64, p< .001, maintain r= .68, p< .001, reappraise r= .69, p< .001; length x LSAS: neutral r= .83, p< .001, maintain r= .88, p< .001, reappraise r= ). Within the SAD group, trajectory length and spread during the maintain phase of the ERT correlated with LSAS scores (r= .54, p= .015; r= .54, p= .01).\n\nConclusions: The present study is the first-ever demonstration of altered brain network dynamics in SAD using unsupervised manifold learning applied to dynamic EEG connectivity. Future work will examine whether brain state-space dynamics could be used as a platform for neurofeedback applications.\n\nKeywords: EEG Biomarkers, Social Anxiety, Connectome, Dynamic Connectivity.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nM15. Mechanisms by Which the Prefrontal Cortex Distinguishes Ventral Hippocampal From Mediodorsal Thalamic Inputs\n\nSarah Canetta*, Scott Bolkan, Nancy Padilla-Coreano, Joshua Gordon, Christoph Kellendonk\n\nColumbia University, New York, New York, United States\n\nBackground: The prefrontal cortex (PFC) serves as a hub for cognitive and affective behaviors including spatial working memory and anxiety. Two major sources of information to the PFC are provided by the ventral hippocampus (vHipp) and the mediodorsal thalamus (MD), both of which provide glutamatergic input to this structure. Despite this convergence of input, optogenetically silencing either the vHipp to PFC or MD to PFC inputs produces distinct behavioral responses. For example, silencing vHipp to PFC terminals decreases anxiety (Padilla-Coreano N et al, Neuron, 2016) and selectively impairs encoding of spatial working memory (Spellman T et al, Nature, 2015) while silencing MD to PFC terminals does not affect anxiety and instead selectively impairs maintenance of spatial working memory (Bolkan et al, in preparation). However, the mechanisms by which the prefrontal cortex is able to selectively distinguish between seemingly identical neurotransmitter inputs to generate behaviorally distinct responses is unknown.\n\nMethods: We used Channel-rhodopsin (ChR2) in combination with slice electrophysiology in the PFC to assess the efficacy of synaptic transmission for both projections under different input frequencies. We are currently using a combination of red-shifted and blue-light activated ChR2 to investigate whether vHipp and MD cells project to the same PFC neurons and whether synaptic transmission from these two projections is differentially affected by input frequency.\n\nResults: In mice with either their vHipp or MD bilaterally injected with ChR2, we have found that all layer III/V PFC cells sampled receive MD or vHipp input. vHipp to PFC inputs seem optimally tuned to respond at lower frequencies (8 Hz), as the response amplitude to repeated 5-ms stimulations at this frequency produced consistent, high-fidelity responses, while the responses to repeated stimulation at 20 Hz displayed significant attenuation and increased failure rate. In contrast, MD to PFC inputs, while responding to a single 5-ms light pulse with a comparable amplitude to that of vHipp to PFC inputs, showed less attenuation to subsequent stimulations at 20 Hz and no failures. Experiments probing MD-PFC and vHipp-PFC inputs in the same animals are ongoing and will be presented at the meeting.\n\nConclusions: Our current data are consistent with a model whereby MD and vHipp inputs broadly project to overlapping pyramidal cell populations, but may be distinguished by optimal synaptic transmission at distinct frequencies.\n\nKeywords: Prefrontal Cortex, Mediodorsal Thalamus, Ventral Hippocampus, Optogenetics, Electrophysiology.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nM16. Ketamine for Social Anxiety Disorder: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Crossover Trial\n\nJerome Taylor*, Angeli Landeros-Weisenberger, Catherine Coughlin, Jilian Mulqueen, Jessica Johnson, Daniel Gabriel, Margot Reed, Ewgeni Jakubovski, David Klemanski, Michael Bloch\n\nYale Child Study Center, New Haven, Connecticut, United States\n\nBackground: First-line treatments for Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) are only partially effective. Many SAD patients experience little or inadequate symptom relief with available treatments. Ketamine has robust short-term anti-depressant effects, and is particularly effective in depressed patients with comorbid anxiety. Ketamine is a potent NMDA receptor antagonist and represents an agent with a potentially novel mechanism of action for the treatment of anxiety disorders. We sought to determine the short-term efficacy of ketamine compared to placebo in the treatment of social anxiety disorder.\n\nMethods: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 18 adults with SAD and compared the effects of intravenous ketamine (dosed 0.5 mg/kg) on social anxiety symptoms to placebo (normal saline). All participants met DSM-5 criteria for SAD and endorsed a fear of public speaking. Ketamine and placebo infusions were administered in a random order with a 28-day washout period between infusions. The primary outcome of the trial was average Lebowitz Social Anxiety Scale Score for the first 3 days following infusion. All participants were asked to give a 10-minute impromptu speech in front of a small audience at baseline and 24 hours after the intravenous infusion. Anxiety during the speech was self-rated by patients on a visual analog scale (VAS) scored 0 (“not at all anxious”) – 100 (“as anxious as you could possibly be”) during the impromptu speech. Additionally, blinded raters used the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale (CGI-I) scored 1 (“very much improved”) to 7 (“very much worse”) to measure overall improvement at 24 hours after each infusion.\n\nResults: Of the 18 participants, 17 completed both infusions and 3 met criteria for current DSM-5 Major Depressive Disorder at enrollment. The CGI-I score at 1 day following infusion was significantly reduced in the ketamine group compared to placebo (paired t-test t=2.78, p=0.015). Eleven of 18 subjects receiving ketamine were rated as minimally improved or better on the CGI 1 day following infusion compared to 2 of 17 receiving placebo. The only two responders to treatment (CGI<3) received ketamine.\n\nConclusions: Ketamine resulted in a significantly greater reduction in social anxiety when compared to placebo as assessed by CGI completed by blinded raters at 1 day following infusion. A significant limitation to the self-rated anxiety during the impromptu speech is that 17 of 18 patients correctly identified when they received ketamine, suggesting that the use of saline (placebo) as a control for ketamine led to inadequate blinding. Analysis of change in depression symptoms, performance on the speech, social anxiety symptoms, and period effects over the full 2 weeks of symptom monitoring is pending and will be presented at the poster session.\n\nKeywords: Social Anxiety, Clinical Trial, Ketamine, Anxiety Disorders, Mood and Anxiety Disorders.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nM17. Adolescent Social Anxiety is Associated With Dysregulated Neural Response During the Anticipation and Receipt of Peer Evaluation\n\nJohanna Jarcho*, Ashley Smith, Brent Rappaport, Tessa Clarkson, Mala Masson, Ellen Leibenluft, Daniel Pine, Eric Nelson\n\nStony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, United States\n\nBackground: Social anxiety (SA) increases during adolescence, when the salience of peer-based social evaluation peaks. Prior neuroimaging studies show that in socially anxious adolescents, peers elicit dysregulated engagement in key brain regions implicated in social cognition and affect processing (Guyer et al, 2005, Lau et al. 2012). However, SA symptoms are differentially triggered by distinct social contexts. Specifically, uncertain, rather than predictable social situations, commonly elicit SA symptoms. Thus, peer evaluation in the presence of uncertainty may be associated with distinct, yet unknown patterns of brain function that promote the affective symptoms and social biases common to SA. We recently developed an ecologically valid fMRI-based paradigm optimized to test for the effects of social evaluative uncertainty during ongoing social interactions with peers in a virtual school setting (Jarcho et al, 2013, 2016). In the present study, we utilized this paradigm to determine whether neural response in SA, compared with healthy adolescents, varied during the anticipation and receipt of predictable and unpredictable peer acceptance and rejection feedback.\n\nMethods: After undergoing a clinical diagnostic interview (KSADS-PL), gender, and IQ-matched healthy (n=21) and SA (n=21) adolescents (12.36±2.36 years) were told they would visit a Virtual School and interact with purported “Other Students”. Before completing the fMRI paradigm, participants learned each student had a reputation for being nice, mean, or unpredictable. While scanning, participants entered classrooms with the Other Students. Unpredictable peers provided 50% positive and negative social evaluation, while nice and mean peers respectively provided 100% positive or negative social evaluation. Whole brain analyses (p< .005; cluster threshold> 50 voxels) tested whether SA and Healthy adolescents had different patterns of neural response as they anticipated, and then received predictable and unpredictable positive and negative peer evaluation.\n\nResults: Participants were able to learn Other Student reputations prior to interacting at the Virtual School and subsequently reported believing these interactions involved real peers. During anticipated peer evaluation, extensive group differences in brain function emerged in medial prefrontal cortex (9, 37, 8; 678 voxels) dorsal anterior cingulate (-9. 20, 43; 64 voxels), superior temporal gyrus (57, -27, 5; 76 voxels), putamen (29, 9, -1; 73 voxels), and ventral striatum (6, 6, -1; 54 voxels), key regions implicated in social cognition and affective processing. For each activation cluster, SA adolescents had heightened engagement relative to healthy adolescents. Additionally, more severe symptoms of anxiety, measured by the Screen for Child and Anxiety Related Disorders, and more fear during the scan, were associated with greater activity. During the receipt of peer evaluation, a distinct pattern of group differences emerged in the right temporal pole (49, 16, -30; 51 voxels), a brain region implicated in mentalizing and binding affective meaning to social experiences. SA adolescents had less activity when they received negative social evaluation from unpredictable relative to mean peers, t(18)= −3.39, p< .005; healthy adolescents exhibited the opposite pattern t(18)= 3.29, p< .005. Neither group differentiated between positive feedback from unpredictable compared with nice peers.\n\nConclusions: These results demonstrate that anticipating peer evaluation, regardless of the valence of its expected outcome, elicits heightened engagement in socio-affective processing networks among SA adolescents. Moreover, they suggest that peer-related uncertainty may play a more central role in potentiating neural dysreguation in SAD than social rejection alone. Results also suggest further nuances in the relationship between brain function and experiences of social acceptance in normatively developing adolescents.\n\nKeywords: Adolescence, Anxiety, Social Interaction, Functional MRI (fMRI), Fronto-Striatal networks.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nM18. A Reproducible Inbred Mouse Model of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms That Identifies Susceptibility\n\nStephanie Sillivan*, Nadine Joseph, Sarah Jamieson, Itzamarie Chévere-Torres, Illeana Fuentes, Gleb Shumyatsky, Gavin Rumbaugh, Courtney Miller\n\nThe Scripps Research Institute-Florida, Jupiter, Florida, United States\n\nBackground: A history of stress increases the likelihood that an individual will develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) . The disorder is defined by persistent recollections of a traumatic event that are accompanied by hyperarousal, avoidance of trauma-related cues and negative changes in mood and cognition3. The limited neurobiological understanding of PTSD has been attributed, in part, to the need for improved animal models.\n\nMethods: We employed a stress enhanced fear learning (SEFL) paradigm that combines restraint stress with fear conditioning to precipitate traumatic memories in mice. Extinction profiles of male and female mice after SEFL were examined. Further characterization of behavioral and molecular patterns induced by SEFL in male mice were assessed with anxiety tests, Fos immunohistochemistry and RNA-sequencing.\n\nResults: This SEFL paradigm recapitulates several hallmark features of PTSD, including differential vulnerability to the effects of stress. The stress susceptible subgroup displays persistently elevated, extinction-resistant fear memory, hyperarousal, generalization, dysregulated corticosterone and altered Fos activation in PTSD-associated brain regions, the infralimbic cortex and basolateral amygdala (BLA), following remote memory retrieval. Importantly, behavior during SEFL training was predictive of stress susceptible and resilient animals, enabling molecular studies without the typical confound of additional behavioral phenotyping. Transcriptome-wide analysis of the BLA revealed divergence between these two subgroups, including dysregulated transcription of genes that have been implicated in PTSD by polymorphisms specific to PTSD patients. Finally, key behavioral outcomes of the model, including susceptibility, were easily replicated in an independent laboratory.\n\nConclusions: This SEFL model provides a readily available tool for development of PTSD therapeutics that is construct and face valid, as well as compatible with the growing number of mouse-specific research resources.\n\nKeywords: Fear Extinction, Traumatic Stress, Resilience.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nM19. HIV Alters PTSD Symptomology and Psychophysiology in Traumatized Individuals\n\nVasiliki Michopoulos*, Gretchen Neigh, Igho Ofotokun, Tanja Jovanovic\n\nEmory University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States\n\nBackground: HIV-infected individuals are exposed to high rates of trauma that can lead to the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The incidence of PTSD in people living with HIV (PLWH) has been reported to be as high as 30% in both women and men. Importantly, low socioeconomic status (SES) among disadvantaged African Americans living within urban environments is strongly associated high levels of trauma exposure and PTSD, as well as increased risk for HIV infection. Exposure to stressors and increased stress reactivity associated with PTSD increases antiretroviral therapy (ART) non-compliance, care drop out, and engagement in transmission risk behaviors. While PTSD in PLWH has been associated with attenuated levels of ART compliance, hastened disease progression and decreased quality of life, it still remains unclear how HIV infection influences PTSD presentation in trauma-exposed individuals. Furthermore, the lack of knowledge surrounding how HIV status influences the presentation of PTSD may limit the generalizability of behavioral and pharmacological treatment strategies to PLWH and PTSD. Thus, we undertook the current study to characterize how HIV infection influences PTSD presentation (symptoms and psychophysiological hyperarousal) in trauma-exposed PLWH. Furthermore, because HIV has been linked to cognitive deficits, we tested the hypothesis that PLWH would show deficits in physiological learning as assessed in a fear-conditioning paradigm.\n\nMethods: All participants (n=42, 25 without HIV, 17 PLWH) were between 18 and 48 years old recruited from Grady Memorial Hospital in downtown Atlanta, GA and provided informed consent. All subjects participated in a clinical interview conducted by a trained clinician on all psychological assessment instruments. Lifetime trauma history was determined by the 14-item Traumatic Events Inventory (TEI), which assesses for experiencing and witnessing traumatic events. Childhood trauma history was assessed via the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). The PTSD Symptom Scale (PSS) was used to determine current overall PTSD symptoms, as well as avoidance, re-experiencing, and hyperarousal sub-clusters. A sub-set of subjects also participated in a fear-potentiated startle (FPS) paradigm to assess for psychophysiological hyperarousal previously described to be present in PTSD, as well as deficits in physiological learning. FPS was measured by the relative increase in the acoustic startle reflex in the presence of conditioned stimuli that have been paired with aversive unconditioned stimuli. The FPS consisted of an initial habituation phase wherein conditioned stimuli (CS) were presented without any reinforcement. The fear acquisition phase consisted of three blocks with four trials of each type of CS (reinforced conditioned stimulus, CS+; non-reinforced conditioned stimulus, CS-; noise probe alone, NA) for 12 trails per block and a total of 36 trials. Both CSs were colored shapes (i.e. blue square, purple triangle) presented on a computer monitor for six seconds each and counterbalanced across subjects. The unconditioned stimulus (US; aversive stimulus) was a 250-msec air blast of 140-psi intensity to the larynx.\n\nResults: PLWH exhibited higher levels of re-experiencing (F=12.19, p=0.001) and avoidance (F=8.12, p=0.007) PTSD symptoms compared to individuals without HIV, after controlling for trauma exposure. PLWH also showed impaired fear conditioning in the FPS paradigm compared to the traumatized controls (interaction effect of HIV and Trial Type, F=7.34, p=0.03). While individuals without HIV showed a typical increase in startle magnitude to the CS+ that was previously paired to an aversive stimulus (F=23.75, p=0.003), PLWH exhibited a deficit in fear conditioning, even after controlling for trauma exposure (p>0.05). Specifically, PLWH did not show FPS to the danger signal (CS+).\n\nConclusions: Taken together, these preliminary data indicate that HIV is associated with altered PTSD symptom presentation and fear learning deficits in traumatized individuals. Furthermore, these data suggest that HIV is associated specifically with symptoms of re-experiencing and avoiding the traumatic event; rather than more general trauma-related psychopathology such as hyperarousal. Given that these symptoms promote avoidance of PTSD treatment, these data have high clinical significance for treating PLWH. The finding that PLWH also show psychophysiological fear learning deficits also has treatment implications for PLWH, as the most effective evidence-based treatments for PTSD are based on fear learning mechanisms. Ongoing analyses are being performed to directly assess the effects of HIV on fear extinction in traumatized individuals.\n\nKeywords: PTSD, HIV, Psychophysiology.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nM20. Identification of a Novel Genetic Candidate for Fear Extinction in Mice\n\nOzge Gunduz Cinar*, Emma Brockway, Lauren Lederle, Troy Wilcox, Lindsay Halladay, Ying Ding, Hyunjung Oh, Erica Busch, Katie Kaugars, Shaun Flynn, Kathryn MacPherson, Sophie Masneuf, Courtney Pinard, Etienne Sibille, Elissa Chesler, Andrew Holmes\n\nNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, Rockville, Maryland, United States\n\nBackground: Although stress and psychological trauma affects many people, some people are more susceptible due to inherited factors and some people are in high risk due to their environment. In our previous studies we identified that inbred mice strain 129S1/SvImJ (S1) has impaired fear extinction compared to normally extinguishing C57BL/6J (B6) mice. In this study we aimed to identify gene candidates that would be critical in the extinction of traumatic memories and associated behaviors.\n\nMethods: In order to identify phenotypic and genetic differences across mouse strains to locate genomic regions associated with variation in trauma-relevant behaviors we performed a quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with fear extinction in a population generated from crossing these inbred mouse strains. We used Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction protocol to test our mice. Using Palkovits punch techniques we collected basolateral amygdala (BLA) after test and used the tissue punches for biochemical and genetic analysis. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify the perineuronal nets in BLA. We used in situ hybridization for detecting the distribution, neuronal subtype-specific expression of our gene of interest in BLA. Stereotaxic injections were used for lenti viral based functional modifications in BLA.\n\nResults: First, we found these strain differences to be resistant to developmental cross-fostering and associated with anatomical variation in BLA perineuronal nets, which are developmentally implicated in extinction. Next, we performed BLA expression-profiling on genes located within an extinction-associated QTL and nominated Ppid (peptidylprolyl isomerase D, a member of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein family) as an extinction-related candidate gene. Subsequently, we showed that the extinction-impaired mouse strain had reduced BLA Ppid and GR (glucocorticoid receptor) gene expression, but retained the extinction-facilitating effects of a systemic GR agonist. Then, using a virus-based approach to directly regulate Ppid function, we demonstrated that downregulating BLA-Ppid was sufficient to impair extinction, while upregulating BLA-Ppid produced facilitation of extinction coupled to changes in in vivo neuronal extinction-encoding.\n\nConclusions: Collectively, our results identify Ppid as a novel gene involved in regulating extinction possibly via modulations on downstream GR signaling. Identification of Ppid as a novel gene critically involved in fear extinction in mice could potentially help us to understand more on the genetic and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying risk for trauma-related disorders.\n\nKeywords: Fear Extinction, Basolateral Amygdala, QTL, GR Chaperone, Mouse Behavior.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nM21. Neural Response During Reward Anticipation Differs in Tanner-Staged Children and Adolescents as a Function of Task Difficulty and Reward Probability\n\nShau-Ming Wei*, Shanna Murray, Tiffany Nash, Katherine Reding, Pedro Martinez, Ellen Boyle, Sheila Brady, Lynnette Nieman, Steven Soldin, Caroline Zink, Shane Kippenhan, Philip Kohn, Peter Schmidt, Karen Berman\n\nNational Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States\n\nBackground: Changes in the neural underpinnings of reward processing during adolescence may contribute to observed increases in risk-taking behavior during this developmental period, but the existing literature regarding differences between children and adolescents in brain activation during reward processing has provided inconsistent information. For example, studies have found both hyperactivation and hypoactivation in the striatum and related inter-connected regions (including the amygdala, the hippocampus, and the anterior cingulate) during reward anticipation, and even those investigations employing similar task designs do not always yield equivalent results. These contradictory findings may result from different ages and/or developmental (pubertal) stages of participants, cohort effects, or differential task demands. Here, we compared the neural processes underlying reward anticipation during variable task difficulty and reward probability in adolescents and pre-pubertal children, with pubertal (Tanner) stage ascertained by clinicians.\n\nMethods: Typically developing children (17 girls, mean age=8.6, range=8.1-9.1; 24 boys, mean age=8.7, range=8.3-9.4; all Tanner Stage 1) and adolescents (12 girls, mean age=13.1, range=12.3-14.6; 18 boys; mean age=13.0, range=12.2-14.0; Tanner Stages 2-5, median=4) performed a modified monetary incentive delay (MID) task in a 3T fMRI scanner. The task included trials with potential monetary reward and two levels of predictable difficulty (depending on required response time), as well as baseline trials where no monetary gain was possible. Anticipatory background cues indicated whether the imminent trial would be a potential reward trial (and its predicted difficulty) or a non-reward trial. A green background cue indicated a reward trial with a 67% chance of being easy (up to 1250 ms given for the response, thus requiring little effort and having likely success), whereas a red background cue indicated a reward trial with a 67% chance of being ‘difficult’ (response required within 175 ms, thus requiring high effort and having less likely success). A gray background cue signaled a baseline control trial with no possibility of reward and a 50:50 distribution of required response times. At the first level, for each trial we modeled the anticipation phase (three levels: red, green, or gray cues) as well as reward outcome (two levels: successful or unsuccessful monetary outcome), and the contrast of interest was defined as the anticipation phase for the red (67% difficult) versus green (67% easy) trials for each participant. The Artifact Detection Tools (ART) software package was used to remove TR’s with more than 1.5 mm displacement. These first-level contrasts were then entered into a second-level, whole-brain voxel-wise analysis using a full factorial model to test for effects of pubertal status and sex, and their interaction, in SPM5.\n\nResults: The number of TR’s removed did not differ between sexes or pubertal groups and averaged 5%. Whole-brain voxel-wise analysis examining the main effect of pubertal status revealed several regions where neural response in pre-pubertal children differed from adolescents as a function of task difficulty during reward anticipation; these included the caudate (voxel-level p=0.0005, uncorrected), anterior cingulate (p=0.001, uncorrected), amygdala (p=0.002, uncorrected), and hippocampus (p=0.002, uncorrected). Post-hoc analyses showed that in all of these regions, children had greater neural response during easy trials with more likely success than during difficult trials, whereas adolescents showed the opposite pattern. No significant main effect of sex or interaction between pubertal status and sex were observed at p<0.005, uncorrected.\n\nConclusions: In the present study, we measured brain activation associated with task difficulty and reward probability during reward anticipation by independently manipulating reward-predicting anticipatory background cues. Our data provide evidence for differential neural recruitment in adolescents and pre-pubertal children in several regions previously associated with reward processing. The results emphasize the importance of considering differential task demands in interpreting brain responses to reward-predicting stimuli. In addition, our determination of pubertal stage by clinician-performed Tanner staging provides a foundation for future longitudinal examination of the role of hormonal changes in reward-related neurodevelopment.\n\nKeywords: Children and Adolescents, Reward Neural Circuitry, Striatum, Puberty, Brain Development.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nM22. Age-Related Changes in Atypical Structural Covariance Networks in Males With High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder\n\nSusan Shur-Fen Gau*, Yu-Chieh Chen, Ting-Fong Tiffany Liu, Hsiang-Yuan Lin, Kathleen R Merikangas\n\nNational Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China\n\nBackground: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with atypical structural and intrinsic functional connectivity in the main brain networks. Network-level brain structural organizations may reflect not only structural and functional connectivity but also the prevention of functional signal bias (Alexander-Bloch et al, 2013). Limited ASD studies investigated structural covariance networks based on variable seed definitions, in heterogeneous cohort with a wide age range and mixed sex, thus still yielding inconsistent findings. As age and sex effects on brain structures and functions may be distinct in ASD from typically developing controls (TDCs), we aimed to directly explore structural covariance networks comparable to intrinsic functional networks in a more homogeneous sample with ASD, regarding male-only participants and narrower age subsamples.\n\nMethods: We assessed 230 male participants (115 ASD, and 115 TDCs) with clinical evaluation and structural MRI scans on Simens Magnetom Trio 3 T system. Participants were subgrouped into children (54 ASD, age range 7-12.5 years, mean±SD 10.8±1.2 years; 54 age-matched TDC), adolescents (33 ASD, age range 12.5-18 years, mean±SD 14.6±2.4 years; 33 age-matched TDC), and adults (28 ASD, age range 18-30 years, mean±SD, 21±2.6 years; 28 age-matched TDC). Surface-based morphometry analysis was implemented using FreeSurfer ver. 5.3.0. Structural covariance analysis was applied to characterize structural relationships of cortical thickness (a seed-based approach). The seeds were derived from the hubs of Yeo’s 7-networks (2011) based on functional parcellation, including the salience network, default mode network, dorsal attention network, control network, visual network, somatomotor network and limbic network.\n\nResults: In children with ASD, we identified that there was significant structural covariance within the salience, default mode, dorsal attention, control and limbic networks as compared with TDC children. TDC children had significant visual and somatomotor structural covariance networks, but these covaried relationships were not identified in children with ASD. In both ASD and TDC adolescent groups, there was no significant structural covariance network identified from the seeds based on Yeo’s 7-networks. In young adults with ASD, we identified only limited regions showing significant structural covariance with the key hubs of the brain networks subserving high cortical functions, as compared with TDC adults. Between-group comparisons, in terms of the significant group by seed interactions, showed that TDC adults, relative to adults with ASD, had higher structural covariance within these networks involved in high cortical functions. ?In young adults with ASD, we identified the prominent structural covariance between homologous lateral prefrontal regions, concurring with earlier resting-state fMRI reports (Hahamy et al, 2015), whereas this covariance was not identified in TDC adults.\n\nConclusions: Our results extend prior results of age-related neurostructural atypicality in ASD to structural covariance networks. Overall, we identified increased structural covariance of the major networks in children with ASD, whereas reduced covariance in adults with ASD was found. These age-specific differences echo earlier literature of resting-state functional MRI in ASD, further endorsing the speculation that structural organizations may reflect intrinsic functional connectivity. Future work to investigate the replication and generalization issues to other subgroups on the spectrum is warranted.\n\nKeywords: Autism Spectrum Disorder, Structural Covariance, Networks, Age Effects.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nM23. Identifying Convergent Biological Pathways in Autism Using a Zebrafish Model\n\nSundas Ijaz, Marcus Ghosh, Catalina Sakai, Stephen Wilson, Jason Rihel, Matthew State, Antonio Giraldez, Ellen Hoffman*\n\nYale University, New Haven, Connecticut, United States\n\nBackground: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of devastating neurodevelopmental syndromes that affect up to 1 in 68 children. The zebrafish is a model vertebrate system well-suited for conducting small molecule screens to uncover convergent biological pathways in ASD. We have shown that zebrafish mutants of the ASD risk gene, Contactin Associated Protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2), display forebrain GABAergic deficits, and we identified estrogenic compounds as suppressors of the cntnap2 mutant behavioral phenotype. Here we investigate morphological and behavioral phenotypes in zebrafish mutants of Chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 8 (CHD8), one of the strongest ASD risk genes identified to date, to illuminate neurochemical pathways underlying ASD.\n\nMethods: To investigate the function of Chd8, we generated two lines of chd8 mutants in zebrafish using TALENs that target regions early in the gene and an exon containing a nonsense mutation in an individual with ASD. We analyzed inhibitory and excitatory neuronal populations in chd8 mutants during early brain development. To predict neural pathways that are disrupted in mutants, we conducted quantitative pharmaco-behavioral profiling of chd8 mutant larvae and compared the mutant behavioral fingerprint to a previously reported dataset of the behavioral profiles of wild-type larvae exposed to 550 psychoactive compounds. Finally, we conducted pharmacological screens to identify phenotypic suppressors.\n\nResults: We found that zebrafish chd8 mutants display GABAergic deficits in the forebrain, though the deficit is less than in cntnap2 mutants (10-20% versus 34%). There were no significant regional differences in glutamatergic neurons. Head and brain size are unaffected in homozygous chd8 mutants during early developmental stages, though homozygous mutants are smaller on average as adults and show increased mortality. High-throughput quantitative behavioral profiling revealed a robust and reproducible phenotype of decreased periods of inactivity during the daytime in both lines of chd8 mutants. In addition, we found that estrogenic compounds modulate the chd8 mutant behavioral phenotype.\n\nConclusions: Pharmaco-behavioral profiling of zebrafish mutants highlights the strength of this system to investigate common morphological and pharmacological pathways involving ASD risk genes. These results illuminate a novel neurochemical pathway with relevance to ASD.\n\nKeywords: Autism Spectrum Disorder, Zebrafish, Genetics, Translational Neuroscience, Pharmacology.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nM24. Characterization of the Intrinsic Functional Connectivity of the Habenula in Children With ADHD\n\nAmy Roy*, Melissa Arfuso, Ramiro Salas, Rachel Klein, Francisco Castellanos\n\nFordham University, Bronx, New York, United States\n\nBackground: The habenula is a small brain region adjacent to the thalamus that directly influences striatal monoaminergic circuitry through its connections with the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra compacta. These striatal circuits have been implicated in reward processing and motor function, and show abnormalities in individuals with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD; Swanson et al, 2007). This suggests that habenula function, as well as its functional connections, may be disrupted in ADHD. Initial support for this comes from animal work demonstrating that habenula lesions result in hyper-locomotion, impulsivity, and attention deficits (Lee & Goto, 2011). The present study takes an initial step towards evaluating the role of the habenula in pediatric ADHD by examining the intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) of this region. While we predicted that children with ADHD would exhibit alterations in habenula iFC with the VTA and striatum, whole-brain analyses were conducted due to our limited knowledge of broader habenula iFC networks, particularly in children.\n\nMethods: Children (ages 5- 9 years old) were recruited across two groups: children with a diagnosis of ADHD (ADHD; n= 40) and children without any current Axis I disorder (healthy comparisons, HC; n= 38). Diagnoses were determined by parent interview using the Schedule of Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for Children, Present and Lifetime Version (KSADS-PL; Kaufman et al, 1997). Following this assessment, children attended an MRI scan session during which they completed a 6-minute resting state scan (e.g., lie still with eyes open) and a high-resolution anatomical scan for registration. All neuroimaging pre-processing and group level analyses were conducted using an alpha version (0.3.9) of the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC; http://fcp-indi.github.io/). Seed-based intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) was assessed using habenula regions of interest (ROIs) identified individually by inspection of normalized T1-weighted images. Two 2mm radius spherical ROIs were created that encompassed the left and right habenulae for all but 3 participants, who were excluded. A time series was obtained for each ROI and then correlations were calculated between these time series and every other voxel in the brain resulting in individual correlation maps which were then converted to Z-value iFC maps using Fisher’s r-to-z transformation and transformed into MNI152 2mm standard space. This analysis produced subject-level maps of voxelwise correlations with the time-series of the left and right habenula ROIs. Group-level iFC analyses were conducted using a random-effects, ordinary least-squares model, including two group mean predictors (ADHD vs. HC) and three nuisance covariates (demeaned age, sex, framewise displacement); all were GRF corrected at p< 0.05, Z> 2.3.\n\nResults: Groups did not differ in age, sex, or movement during the resting state scan. Direct comparison of ADHD vs. HC children elicited two significant findings. First, HC evidenced significant positive iFC between the left habenula and bilateral putamen that was absent for the ADHD group. Second, group differences were observed for iFC between the right habenula and the precuneus. Specifically, HC showed positive iFC while the ADHD group showed negative iFC between these two regions.\n\nConclusions: These findings point to possible disruptions in habenular functional networks in children with ADHD. Specifically, the absence of typical iFC between left habenula and the putamen may reflect ADHD-related dysfunction of striatal dopamine circuits. Further, children with ADHD exhibited altered iFC between the right habenula and the precuneus, suggesting disruption of broader habenula-based networks encompassing the default mode network. Of note, ADHD-related alterations in habenula iFC differed for the left and right habenulae, which is consistent with previous work suggesting differential functions of these homotopic regions.\n\nKeywords: Habenula, ADHD, Resting State Functional Connectivity, Children.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nM25.
