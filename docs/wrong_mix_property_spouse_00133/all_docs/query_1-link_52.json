        "text": "May 2024\n\nBig News\n\nZone I Deputy Division Director Ryan Crews instituted a new quarterly award and presented the first one for MTC to Librarian II Jacqueline West. (See below for details.)\n\nEmployee of the Month\n\nCustody – COIII Jay Mackey was nominated by COI Derrick Shields who wrote, “This employee has always gone above his daily duties. He will help out officers in need, big or small, inside and outside of the institution. He is a role model of not just a good supervisor but a good man. An example of his generosity is when it is lower temperatures out, he will take the time after shift and scrape off other officers’ cars that have snow and ice.”\n\nNon-custody – Executive II Tiffany Chambers was nominated by Business Office SOSA Holly Rush who wrote, “Ms. Chambers has gone out of her way to show the janitorial workers the best housekeeping skills for the buildings. She had them thoroughly cleaning the bathrooms, hallways, and assembly. She has even purchased other cleaning supplies for staff to use to make sure areas are sanitized better. Not only has she been going out of her way to help with cleaning, but she has also stepped up and started to help make sure Aramark's items are filled. She has been making sure that the utensils, napkins, coffee cups, and as well as the coffee and creamer are filled for each shift …I feel Ms. Chambers is always going above and beyond, not only in her area, but others as well. She constantly provides amazing feedback and is always there to help in any way possible! She is a great team leader and a great contribution to MTC!”\n\nAwards & Recognition\n\nWarden’s Award for Excellence 2Q24 – Warden Warren’s announcement email to all employees said, “Please join me in congratulating COI Laura Purcell and COI Andrea Morrow on being selected as the winners of the Warden’s Award for Excellence for the second quarter of 2024. I chose two recipients this quarter to recognize the many hours of overtime they’ve volunteered to work in Food Service so far this year. They have worked their RDOs and beyond their regular shifts and, by doing so, have helped ensure the men received their meals on time every day. As many of you know, Aramark has faced an ongoing challenge of staying fully staffed, even though Director Weir has worked tirelessly to make the operation successful. You’ve probably heard me say on more than one occasion that hiring is easy but keeping people is hard. That’s why I’m particularly proud of Officers Purcell and Morrow. They saw a need for teamwork and stepped up to fill a gap where their help was needed most. While I’m proud of their efforts, I’m not surprised. Simply put, MTC is a team and that’s what we do here. Officers Purcell and Morrow are each fine examples of the sort of professionalism that builds trust, rapport, respect, listening, appreciating, and valuing across our entire organization. Thank you, both, for a job well done!”\n\nGoing the Extra Mile – Deputy Division Director Ryan Crews was on site May 17 to present a new zone level award for Going the Extra Mile. He anticipates presenting the award quarterly. The first winner from MTC is Librarian II Jacqueline West. Mr. Crews stated Ms. West earned the award because of her because she’s an\n\nemployee you can always count on. He said Ms. West assisted the WMCC librarian with the move to CRCC and continues to help WRDCC’s new librarian. Last year she completed 650 synopses for all the books she ordered. She also attended the ALA Conference and brought back ideas to encourage attendance at MTC’s library.\n\nNew Team Members\n\nScott Ray, 19-hr COI, 05/13\n\nShawn Howard, 19-hr Career Coach, 05/21\n\nPromotions\n\nSherry Hall, CCMII to ETS, 05/26\n\nStaff Moves\n\nMohaganie Thomas, COI to 19-hr COI, 05/05\n\nMelissa Harrison, PO from P&P to IRC, 05/26\n\nTraining\n\nStaff have almost completed the required training.

Only 2 staff need to complete this training and they were rehired in May. 98% of staff completed GPS online mandatory training. 96% of all staff completed their 40 hours of annual training.\n\nTown Hall Report\n\nTown Hall meetings for all three shifts were held on Friday, May 10, 2024. Twenty staff members attended, and the following topics were discussed: staffing, Division Directors’ Roundtable, security audit, The Corrections Way, Personnel Club, training, SOMO Torch Run, Fish with a First Responder, MOSERS retirement seminar, soft serve ice cream, new heating system, sergeant promotions, Employee Support Specialist services, phase 3 of Ad Seg remodel and request for area in Ad Seg for UAs\n\nImportant Dates\n\nJune 4 – TCP deadline\n\nJune 5 – ETA, SAMII deadline\n\nJune 9-15 – Blue Jeans Week fundraiser for Special Olympics and Personnel Club\n\nJune 10 – Town Hall Meetings at 7:00 am, 2:00 pm, and 3:00 pm\n\nJune 14 – Payday\n\nJune 17 – TCP deadline\n\nJune 18 – ETA, SAMII deadline\n\nJune 19 – HOLIDAY (Juneteenth)\n\nJune 28 – Payday\n\nSuccess Story\n\n25 offenders were released.\n\n23 offenders completed treatment.\n\nApril 2024\n\nBig News\n\nMTC’s Corrections Way Ambassadors kicked off a promotion that will run from April through June called “Do you have what it takes to be a TCW star?” The campaign uses a movie theme with games and prizes that are designed to encourage staff to attend monthly training workshops.\n\nEmployee of the Month\n\nCustody – COI Niki Runion was nominated by Capt. Rusty Preston who wrote, “On 1-26-24 at approximately 8:00 a.m. while conducting her routine searches of her assigned area, Officer Niki Runion located a metal rod behind the wall of the toilet in the bathroom between rooms 433 and 434. The metal rod was recovered at which time it was found to have been sharpened into a point to use as a weapon. The metal rod measured approximately 10 inches in length. The metal rod was taken to the Shift Commander’s Office for safekeeping. Officer Niki Runion's attention to detail and due diligence to her job duties has eliminated a possible dangerous weapon from the institution creating a safer environment for both offenders and staff.”\n\nNon-custody – Gateway Clinical Supervisor Melissa Sandusky-Ury was nominated by DORS TUS Christina Wood and DORS ACIII Matthew Goedken. Ms. Wood wrote, “Supervisor Sandusky-Ury has been instrumental in the implementation of the GOGI class for the Residents in the Treatment Program.

Well done, COI Price!\n\nDistinguished Service Award – CTO Ryan Spire – To encourage evidence based practices in offender management, the DOC is in the process of implementing the use of Brief Intervention Tools (BITS) by custody staff at\n\nseveral institutions.
