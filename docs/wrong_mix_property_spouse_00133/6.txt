Employee of the Month

Custody – COIII Jay Mackey was nominated by COI Derrick Shields who wrote, “This employee has always gone above his daily duties. He will help out officers in need, big or small, inside and outside of the institution. He is a role model of not just a good supervisor but a good man. An example of his generosity is when it is lower temperatures out, he will take the time after shift and scrape off other officers’ cars that have snow and ice.”

Non-custody – Executive II Tiffany Chambers was nominated by Business Office SOSA Holly Rush who wrote, “Ms. Chambers has gone out of her way to show the janitorial workers the best housekeeping skills for the buildings. She had them thoroughly cleaning the bathrooms, hallways, and assembly. She has even purchased other cleaning supplies for staff to use to make sure areas are sanitized better. Not only has she been going out of her way to help with cleaning, but she has also stepped up and started to help make sure Aramark's items are filled. She has been making sure that the utensils, napkins, coffee cups, and as well as the coffee and creamer are filled for each shift …I feel Ms. Chambers is always going above and beyond, not only in her area, but others as well. She constantly provides amazing feedback and is always there to help in any way possible! She is a great team leader and a great contribution to MTC!”

Awards & Recognition

Warden’s Award for Excellence 2Q24 – Warden Warren’s announcement email to all employees said, “Please join me in congratulating COI Laura Purcell and COI Andrea Morrow on being selected as the winners of the Warden’s Award for Excellence for the second quarter of 2024. I chose two recipients this quarter to recognize the many hours of overtime they’ve volunteered to work in Food Service so far this year. They have worked their RDOs and beyond their regular shifts and, by doing so, have helped ensure the men received their meals on time every day. As many of you know, Aramark has faced an ongoing challenge of staying fully staffed, even though Director Weir has worked tirelessly to make the operation successful. You’ve probably heard me say on more than one occasion that hiring is easy but keeping people is hard. That’s why I’m particularly proud of Officers Purcell and Morrow. They saw a need for teamwork and stepped up to fill a gap where their help was needed most. While I’m proud of their efforts, I’m not surprised. Simply put, MTC is a team and that’s what we do here. Officers Purcell and Morrow are each fine examples of the sort of professionalism that builds trust, rapport, respect, listening, appreciating, and valuing across our entire organization. Thank you, both, for a job well done!”

Going the Extra Mile – Deputy Division Director Ryan Crews was on site May 17 to present a new zone level award for Going the Extra Mile. He anticipates presenting the award quarterly. The first winner from MTC is Librarian II Jacqueline West. Mr. Crews stated Ms. West earned the award because of her because she’s an

employee you can always count on. He said Ms. West assisted the WMCC librarian with the move to CRCC and continues to help WRDCC’s new librarian. Last year she completed 650 synopses for all the books she ordered. She also attended the ALA Conference and brought back ideas to encourage attendance at MTC’s library.

Thank you for your foresight and dedication to your team, Officer Clifford.

Non-Custody – TUS Christina Wood has been an integral part of developing and implementing a plan of action to help redirect several different floors who have been struggling to live by treatment concepts, which is often detrimental to their recovery. She often takes all the information she is provided, evaluates it from several different angles, then presents it so the supervisory team can make the best decision possible. Thank you TUS Wood.

Non-Custody – FUM Michael Mullock: FUM Mullock has been getting food trucks to come to MTC and serve staff who want something a little different for lunch.

According to COI Cummins, who nominated Ms. Stevens, “If she hadn’t taken the time to do this, I would not have been paid several hundred dollars of earned overtime. I will always be grateful that she took the time and effort to do this.”

Custody- CO II Jay Mackey – Over the last year Sgt. Mackey has shown himself to be an excellent supervisor on numerous occasions. During the same time period he had multiple new officers assigned to the unit and did his best to ensure they were all properly trained in operations of the administration segregation unit. He does this day after day and maintains a positive attitude regardless of the situation.

Non-Custody- AC Lacy Kobbe – Ms. Kobbe has gone above and beyond her job duties with her work on the Personnel Club. For the past three years she has invested a lot of time and effort into the club. She shops for all supplies to do food day fundraisers, Christmas meals and Corrections Week meals, oftentimes using her weekends for this. She works to serve these special meals on other shifts in addition to her own shift. Lacy coordinates the food day meals ahead of time, using some of her time at home for food preparation. She steps in and covers for vacant Personnel Club positions to send flowers to funerals. All these things are in addition to the treasurer job she does for the Personnel Club.

Employee of the Month

Custody - CO II Travis Winter and CO II Paul Woodruff – Sergeants Winter and Woodruff have both been assigned to frontline supervisory positions on the 2nd shift due to circumstances beyond anyone’s control. During this period of time, they have both been expected to not only complete their own scheduled duties but also those of vacant positions. They have willingly completed those details in a professional manner and without complaint. For these reasons they were selected as Employees of the Month.

Non-Custody - DORS AC III Dianna Sunderman – Ms. Sunderman went above and beyond her job duties by her coverage, creation of forms and training of new staff. She covered for two other supervisors who were out due to illness and also covered for the Treatment Unit Supervisor when she was away for training. She covered additional

case management sessions, completed treatment plans and discharges for those who were gone, and also helped her supervisors out by taking a few sessions for them when they needed to get caught up. Ms. Sunderman both creates and fixes written forms to enhance the organization and professionalism in treatment operations. She also trained a new staff member in treatment processes and procedures. For these reasons she was selected as Employee of the Month.

Awards & Recognition

Lifesaver Award – CO I Ryan Price – COI Price was recognized for preventing an offender from choking on November 6, 2021. During mainline movement for the evening meal an offender began choking. COI Price noticed that the offender was not breathing and administered the Heimlich maneuver, clearing the offender’s airway. The offender was then escorted to medical to be seen by nursing staff. Officer Price’s quick thinking and action potentially saved the life of the offender and qualifies Officer Price for this honor. Well done, COI Price!

Distinguished Service Award – CTO Ryan Spire – To encourage evidence based practices in offender management, the DOC is in the process of implementing the use of Brief Intervention Tools (BITS) by custody staff at

several institutions. Part of this responsibility includes the need to instruct custody staff on how to properly document the use of BITS in the AS/400 OPII system. CTO Ryan Spire took the initiative to create a video to instruct staff on how to complete this task. The video will benefit all staff Department-wide in their learning of the use of BITS and will encourage them to document their offender management activities in the chronological data system. Thank you, CTO Spire!

Warden’s Award for Excellence – CO I Trevor Runde – COI Runde was recently appointed to the Property Officer

post and has done an outstanding job of organizing things and improving processes to make sure everything runs smoothly. He is managing the area effectively and meeting the needs of the offenders. He has a can-do attitude and is willing to do whatever is needed to make Property a success. Officer Runde’s efforts are truly appreciated.

Employee of the Month

Custody - CO I John Tye

John began his career with the Department of Corrections on 3/8/21 and since becoming part of the MTC team he has worked over 100 days of overtime. He is a highly dependable officer who can be counted on to get his job done while assisting others on a nightly basis.

Non-Custody - ROII Dillon Alexander

Dillon heard that KCRC might be getting rid of its weight equipment since it was becoming part of Probation and Parole. He was able to acquire three smith machines, a U bar and a universal machine from them. With assistance from PPSII Troy Ragan, Fire & Safety Coordinator Jeff Ogbourne and Locksmith James Welch, he transported the equipment to MTC where it was reassembled. The offenders are now using the equipment. If it had been purchased, the equipment would have cost approximately $40,000.
