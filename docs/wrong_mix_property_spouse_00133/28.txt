Through this, the adoption/foster parent support group was started as so many families came up after service saying how alone and isolated they were. This was several years ago – so the content has changed over years and focuses more on practical ideas for parents and kids, as well as churches.

After being on staff in the local church for 11 years, I realized that I was a pastor who had no idea how the church could practically address the orphan crisis. In 2010, I started Patch Our Planet to unite church leaders and orphan advocates by customizing long-term orphan care strategies under each church’s vision.

My past experience is a beautiful mosaic of God’s grace along the journey. I served as Road Pastor/World Vision Representative to the Christian Band, Newsong, for three years. My wife and I lived in Argentina early in our marriage. And I spent 11 years of my life pastoring college/singles in the local church and leading yearly mission trips in several countries during that time. In 2010, I started Patch Our Planet. The following year, I was asked to serve on the White House’s International Adoption Panel. Since then, we’ve been equipping the local church and making our orphan care curriculum available online so that every church in every community can make a lasting difference in the orphan crisis. I’ve been married for 16 years to the love of my life. We have two children, one with special needs.

Mark and Monica have an incredible story about how God took an ordinary pediatrician and his family and showed how He can use them to bless so many more lives if they would just listen and follow His call. Beginning with a family trip to Uganda, the Barrets were able to see firsthand the work of Pastor Emmy and Supermom and their single school of 120 children and 2 dozen churches. In May of 2008 the Barrets founded PCM USA and began to be a voice, one opportunity at a time, for needy children and pastors.

Most family trees are pictured as mighty oaks, but Glenn refers to his as a cactus. It’s easy to see why Glenn — with two moms and three dads — describes his background this way. Glenn hasn’t seen his birth mother since the day he was born. His birth father was a chaotic presence, in and out of rehab recovering from addictions. His adoptive father, an alcoholic, committed suicide when Glenn was twelve. His adoptive mother’s fear of living alone made way for “Psychopath Ben,” Glenn’s controlling stepfather. Though Glenn’s family didn’t provide him with much hope for the future, everything changed when Glenn, as a teenager, made the decision to follow Christ.

God has redefined Glenn’s understanding of “family”— demonstrating His fatherly love through positive examples of husbands and fathers in the Church. It took five adults to mess up his life, but only one Jesus to transform it!

The fruit born of this transformation is extraordinary. Glenn and his wife, Robin, have been married for 29 years and blessed with three children: David (25) and his wife Ally, Matthew (23), and Janae (20). After establishing and directing the second Royal Family KIDS Camp, Glenn serves today as Vice President of Camps for Royal Family KIDS. He considers his job — challenging adults to give of their time, talent, and treasure on behalf of the fatherless — as that of a “hopebroker.” Just as some folks buy and sell stocks, he makes transactions of hope using the currency of God’s love.

Orphans and Vulnerable Children – Responding through the Church

My wife, Denise, and I became foster parents at the age of 21, and in the past ten years have fostered 30 children. We never planned to adopt as we had 3 biological children, but God has a funny way of working in us when we make ourselves available. So we now have 8 total children…a 20 year-old who spent 9 years in foster care and has made us grandparents, a 16 year-old from Ethiopia who we adopted after two prior adoptions broke down, our 10, 8 and 7 year old biological kids, and our youngest three lovingly called the ninos at ages 6, 5 and 4.

I entered vocational ministry as a student pastor when I was 19, and in 2009, my wife and I became full-time missionaries with Embrace submitting to God’s call on our lives to serve orphans and waiting children, families and the Church.

Founders of PCM, Emmy and Sarah “Supermom” Nnyanzi have each traveled to the US and UK to share about how God continues to work in incredible ways in Uganda. Both of them came from broken homes where they were mistreated and abused. This bond brought them together as a couple and now propels them to provide “parental care” for hundreds of children lacking physical, emotional and spiritual needs. Pastor Emmy serves as Executive Director in Uganda and is a very anointed preacher, evangelist, and ministry leader who loves to share his testimony, how to overcome bitterness, hearing God’s voice, spiritual warfare and the gifts of the Holy Spirit to name a few.

Overcoming Bitterness (from the perspective of an orphan), Hearing God’s Voice

In 2010 I felt God calling me to step away from my career in the secular non-profit sector, to first focus on my family and second, use my gifts to expand our family’s ministry of caring for orphans and vulnerable children.

Around this same time, my husband was diagnosed with stage three melanoma, our adoption journey inched along towards year three of being “in the process” and I realized that our story is important because God is writing it for us.

Not only is He writing it, but we believe God wants us to share our story with others. My desire is to encourage and equip others with practical ideas for orphan care and adoption through this blog, personal relationships, speaking engagements and coffee with strangers-soon-to-be-friends.

My experience is rooted in being a wife of seven years, mama to two sweet bio babes (ages four and two), our three and a half year pursuit of adopting a little boy from Africa, being a Safe Families host family, certified foster family and orphan care ministry leader.

Doug Walker is the founding and Senior Pastor of Fellowship of the Parks Church with three campuses in North Texas. He is a graduate of Carson Newman College and Southwestern Seminary. Doug wrote the book “Things Were Better Before You Came – A Story of Adoption, Acceptance and Unconditional Love.”

Doug was adopted when he was a baby. When he was nine years old, his adoptive mother—in a moment of intense anger—said something that would change Doug’s life. She said, “Things were better before you came.” From that point on, Doug questioned his value, not just in his parents’ home, but also in the world. This began a lifetime of struggling to earn love and acceptance. Doug’s life was lived with the question, “Were things really better before I came?” Through many years of struggles, Doug came to a point of understanding that God loves us unconditionally.

For the longest time, Doug lived in “Orphan Culture,” which is the perspective that we are only as valuable as our greatest achievements and that we are worthless if we cannot validate our own existence. However, God has invited us to live in “Son Culture,” which is to realize that God loves us unconditionally, regardless of our achievements and accolades.

This book is for people who feel unwanted and unloved. It is for those who have felt that the world would be better off without them and that they have nothing to contribute. This book is for people who need to receive the unconditional love of a God who calls himself Father.

Who would have guessed that a newborn baby abandoned at birth, who failed to thrive with her adoptive parents, who suffered attachment, learning and sensory challenges, and whose mother wanted to abort her, would end up thriving?

Sherrie believes that being adopted equates to a life of mysteries, just waited to be discovered. A twice-reunited adoptee, Eldridge is a straight shooting, transparent, and compassionate author, speaker, and trainer in the field of adoption.

Her books are research based, yet woven within are poignant, biblical messages pounded out on the anvil of her adoptee heart.

This is what makes Eldridge unique!

Because her books hit core needs, readers review her work with either anger or thanks. She takes this in stride, knowing that many critics have returned over the last 20 years to thank her. One adoptive father said she had a beautiful heart because she had the courage to say what his adopted daughter might experience someday.

Her first book, Twenty Things Adopted Kids Wish Their Adoptive Parents Knew, is required reading by many adoption agencies and universities. Her first book, Twenty Things Adopted Kids Wish Their Adoptive Parents Knew has sold more than 160,000 copies and continues to sell well. Sherrie has authored five other books and four workbooks.

In 2010, Eldridge and husband Bob, traveled to DC to receive the Congressional Angel in Adoption Award.

Sherrie has been married for 47 years to Bob Eldridge. They have two married daughters and six grandchildren.

He was overwhelmed by the poverty and yet encouraged by their faith. Seeing the people in need of food, fair wages and a relationship with Christ, C.H. felt called to help the poorest of the poor.

After graduating from Talbot Seminary with a Master of Arts Degree in Theological Studies in 1989 and a Bachelor’s Degree in Finance and Marketing from Northern Illinois, C.H. began full time ministry to help those living in extreme poverty. He added the economic development area to Bright Hope and has founded and shaped the organization’s partnerships and programs.

I am a former foster child who was placed in care at 7 & aged out of the system at 18. I was never allowed to be legally adopted by the last family who took me in at 10 because my birth parents rights were never terminated. I spend most of my life trying to hide the fact of where I came from. After being introduced to the Gospel through a Christian Family I accepted the Lord into my life at 13. There were no overnight transformations but slowly over time the fruits of the Spirit began to fill my life & the Lord began to heal my heart. 2 Corinthians 5:17 say’s anyone who is in Christ in a new creation. I was able to find a new identity one rooted in love to help me overcome my past.

I have spent the past 4 years volunteering for Olive Crest, traveling around WA State sharing my testimony in the faith community to recruit foster families. It is my passion & feel extremely blessed to be able to use my past to participate in His kingdom plan, helping families & saving children one family at a time. Since I first started speaking the Lord has opened many doors, and have had the opportunity to speak at a maximum security women’s prison as well as join the team for Focus On The Family and speak in different states for the Wait No More Conference.

Speaking Themes

My passion is to engage the church & us as believers that the time to respond to the call to foster/adopt is now. To share about the healing & redeeming power that Christ can have in a child’s life. With Him and the support of a loving family, it is possible to break the cycle of sometimes generational abuse. I also hope to offer encouragement to families as well as foster teens traveling on this journey through workshops & trainings.

Miracles of Love. That sums up the story of my life. Born into a tragic, heart-wrenching environment of alcoholism, drug addiction and abuse, God’s first miracle was sparing my life. God then proceeded to put His plan into action.

One couple, led of God, responded to His calling to simply love me. Being adopted by my forever family led to my adoption into the family of God. My Heavenly Father, through His sovereignty, orchestrated my experiencing His love through my parents. Then by the acceptance of His grace and mercy I was adopted into the Kingdom of God when I took Christ as my personal Lord and Savior. God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ. This is what He wanted to do and it gave him great pleasure (Ephesians 1:5, NLT).

That was just the beginning. God who faithfully provided parents to love and adopt me called my husband Dave and me to be instruments of His love through adoption. We have been blessed with 16 beautiful children (2 biological daughters and 14 adopted children). A calling on our lives that would prove to bring the greatest blessings one could ever wish for…our children.

That the God of the universe could love me and use me is humbling. He loved me before I was even formed in my mother’s womb and created me for His purpose, manifesting His plan. Through the years my Heavenly Father felt every tear and faithfully provided for every need. He wants to use me, a mere broken vessel. I am His so that He can live through me for HIS GLORY! Because of God’s matchless grace and perfect strength every misfortune and heartbreak of my journey have been transformed from something to be endured to opportunities to worship Him. I would love the opportunity to share His story- from an orphan to an adoptive parent. A story of healing grace, transforming my life into a dangerous, surrendered, faith building journey of joy. With His heart…Our hands can become His miracles of love!

Six years working directly with children in a mission orphanage in the Philippines. Gerald is one of the early pioneers advocating for Adoption as Ministry and Evangelism since January 1997. He has spoken about adoption ministry in churches across the USA and on several islands in the Philippines.

Author of a comprehensive Adoption Bible Study in 2005

Teaching pastors from Africa, India and Myanmar has led to the launching of adoption ministries in churches in their respective countries where Christian families are now adopting children in their own country and culture.

Gerald and his wife spent six years working with children in a mission orphanage in the Philippines where they learned how desperately children need and want to belong to a loving family.

Gerald believes that Adoption should be the preferred form of orphan care, and advocates for Adoption as a ministry in every evangelical church around the world. Christian families who adopt should be viewed as missionaries who bring the Gospel and God’s love to orphan children by living example.

While teaching pastors from Africa, India, Myanmar, USA and the Philippines about adoption ministry in their churches, Gerald discovered they all knew of families in their churches who already wanted to adopt. Meeting many of those families even in remote villages in the Philippines led to the realization that adoption really can be the solution for the world’s orphan crisis, and that local adoption is far more cost-effective than institutional care. Governments in the Philippines and Uganda are openly opposed to building new orphanages and heartily approve of the Home For Good model for local adoption.

The Home For Good teaching and adoption bible study have been instrumental in helping others to launch adoption ministries in churches in the USA and other countries where Christian families are now adopting children in their own culture.

Recent REVIEW:

“Gerald’s message is one that should be heard in every bible believing church. It is a transforming message that will revolutionize the church’s role in orphan care. His speech is dynamic, succinct and very moving. Mr. Clark’s teaching is well organized, scripturally sound, and keeps the audience engaged. This speaker is not to be missed if you have a chance to hear him. Gerald and his wife are well worth inviting to your church.” – Dianne Liskey

Travel Notes

I have a small child at home so my availability to travel may be limited and will depend on the timing of the request, location, and other details.

Speaking Themes

World Orphans ministry and model of care, specifically: Church-based orphan care, Residential care and (community) home-based care, Holistic Child Care (caring for children spiritually, emotionally, physically and mentally).

What if we were each other’s greatest resource? What if we had ways to support foster and adoptive families both “before and after the balloons”? What if everyone – young, old, married, single – knew they had a part to play? And knew what it was? What if, together, we could find life from loss?

This is my dream. To be honest, it was a dream birthed in heartache. I never dreamt that words like orphan care, infertility, and failed adoption would be part of my story. But each of those have led me to a greater understanding of who I am, and who my God is. It’s also led me to believe that this generation can end the orphan crisis. No really, I believe it. In fact, with an unexpected career as an Attorney and Real Estate Broker, I run Home4Good and have lofty plans like changing the world – one home at a time. As a graduate and former faculty of Trinity Law School, I began – and continue – my professional endeavors with a view to integrate social justice, law, theology, and practical psychology. I try to blend those passions into each opportunity to speak and lead sessions directed at everyday ways to build a culture of support for foster/adoptive families. Because God chose the family as His vehicle of healing for the lonely, I want to see each foster/adoptive family be as healthy and strong as possible as they weather the storms inherent in loving the fatherless.

I am “Auntie Boo” to 16 littles, 3 by adoption, and I’m lucky enough to be married to my best friend – eleven years and counting. My favorite thing to buy is a stamp in my passport, and while I haven’t been everywhere, it’s on my list. The pitter-patters coming down our hallway belong to Abby, our Cavalier Spaniel. No one could be more surprised than me.

Pastor David A. Arruda was born and raised in Fall River, MA. Was a Member of the US. Army. Resided in Alaska for 13 years before returning to New England. Pastor David A. has been a United Methodist since 1993 his has been in the pastoral ministry since 2002. David came into the ministry with a passion to help churches turn around. In 2004 he developed the 11th Hour Church process. This process is to take a closing church and turn it around. In 2005 Bishop Weaver gave David the opportunity to put the 11th Hour Church process into practice. Since then David has led two churches through successful “turn-a-rounds”, and has helped coach other churches.

David is a member of the New England Annual Conference Local Church Transformation Committee, one of the founders of the New England Annual Conferences School of Congregational Development, chairs the RISEM District Congregational Development Committee, member of the RISEM District Ministry Team, a Natural Church Development Coach, chairs N.U.H.O.P.E. (NEAC orphan and adoption ministry), advisor to the We C.A.R.E Village Orphanage Zimbabwe, Massachusetts State coordinator for “Christian Alliance for Orphans” Orphan Sunday and currently the Director of Pastoral Outreach “Christian Alliance for Orphans” Orphan Sunday

David’s approach to church and church transformation is far from the so-called “norm”. To say David’s approach is somewhat unorthodox would be an understatement.

No matter how far he is outside of the boat or box or how unorthodox his approach is, David is never far from his relationship with Jesus. David feels without a solid up close and personal relationship with Jesus Christ there cannot be any church transformation. A relationship with Jesus is paramount for reviving our churches.

in 2005 David lead the New England Annual Conference to pass Resolution 210 Which brought the orphan & foster children crisis to the for front of the conference and established N.U.H.O.P.E which he chairs. Also David is in the process to be a similar resolution to the General Conference in 2016.

David loves nature and the great outdoors, Fly Fishing, Hiking, Climbing, Photography, and an avid Woodworker & Wood Carver.

David lives in Somerset MA with his wife Jane, has three children Elvis, Katie, and Matt and on grandson Masen.

Bill R. Hancock says that he didn’t find foster care. Foster care found him. When he was a young teen, his stepfather asked him to leave their home. He dropped out of high school and found his way to a workhouse. Several years later, he heard a televangelist preaching on TV. The next Sunday, he went to church where God became the father he never had and the church became his family. This experience, coupled with the support of several key individuals, afforded him a new start and he was able to go to college, then graduate school, where he got a job working in an emergency children’s shelter—and he’s been serving foster children ever since.

Bill’s passion and vision is to change the way America does foster care—with the local church as the solution. With more than 30 years of child welfare and church leadership experience, Bill possesses a unique understanding of foster care, public policy, church culture, and social entrepreneurship. His career crosses disciplines with prior leadership roles in both churches and foster care agencies—and this diverse experience led him to co-found FaithBridge Foster Care, a child placing agency that partners with local churches and communities to address their local foster care crisis through the FaithBridge Community of CareSM.

The FaithBridge Community of Care is research-based, integrated delivery system that creates local foster family capacity with built-in stability and quality through unparalleled volunteer support, Christian caseworkers and competency-based curricula and certification. FaithBridge not only works to create localized foster care ministries in partnership with churches, but also has a national scope and reach through partnerships, research and consulting projects with national denominations, foster care providers and others FaithBridge completed the first-ever national survey of a single denomination’s involvement and potential impact in foster care and is now working on a national rollout of its FaithBridge Community of Care model in multiple states. The organization is involved in system transformation and thought leadership activities with organizations ranging from the Christian Alliance for Orphans, Child Welfare League of America and more.

Prior to founding FaithBridge, Bill served in leadership roles in several residential group homes, emergency shelters, and served as a consultant to the child welfare industry. He also has pastored local churches while maintaining an active foster care advocacy and consultancy role. Hancock has been the recipient of numerous recognitions and awards, including a gubernatorial appointment to Georgia’s Policy Council for Children and Families, the Georgia Association of Homes and Services for Children’s Gail Bayes Visionary Leadership for Children and Families Award and an Angel in Adoption Award from the Congressional Coalition on Adoption. In addition, Bill is a Board Member for Georgia Life Alliance and a member of the CWLA National Faith-Based Advisory Committee. He and his wife have three biological children and three foster children.

Jesse Rivers was born in and grew up in central Maine. Living through a challenging

and abusive childhood, he was finally rescued by the U.S. government at the age of 13

and placed in foster care. Fortunately, Jesus Christ pursued Jesse from a very young

age, and at the age of 7 years old Jesse received Jesus Christ as his Savior. While in

foster care, at the age of 15, after a very traumatic accident, Jesse came to the place of

surrender and service to the Lordship of Jesus Christ as well.

Throughout most of his lifetime, Jesse has been very aware of the calling of God on his

life, to serve precious children, most needing of love and care. He earned a BA in

Christian Ministries from Messiah College in 2002, and an MA in Cross-Cultural Studies

from Fuller Theological Seminary in 2010. Jesse currently lives the majority of the year

in Guatemala, where he serves with Abogar International Ministries, to fight for children

who are orphaned, abandoned, abused, at-risk, and/or homeless; seeking to promote

forever families, forever homes, and educational opportunities for the children. He also

enjoys serving in a diverse array of ministry positions; advocate, youth pastor, camp

pastor, evangelist, and motivational speaker.
