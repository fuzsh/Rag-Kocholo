Dean's List

In recognition of undergraduate academic excellence, a Dean's List is compiled each academic semester. To qualify, students must complete at least 12 credit hours at Webster University, of which no fewer than 6 credit hours must have regular letter grades. All enrolled coursework must be successfully completed, with no Incomplete or Withdrawn grades recorded. Qualified students who achieve a current semester GPA of 3.80 will be placed on the Dean's List for that semester.
