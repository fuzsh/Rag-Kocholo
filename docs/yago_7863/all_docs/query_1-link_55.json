        "text": "Die Hard is a 1988 action film directed by John McTiernan and written by Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza. The film is based on a novel titled Nothing Lasts Forever by Roderick Thorp.\n\nThe film stars Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman (in his film debut), Alexander Godunov, and Bonnie Bedelia, with Reginald Vel Johnson, William Atherton, Paul Gleason.\n\nStuart was hired by 20th Century Fox to adapt Thorp's novel in 1987. His draft was greenlit by Fox, which was eager for a summer blockbuster the following year. The role of McClane was turned down by a host of the decade's most popular actors, including Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. Known mainly for work on television, Willis was paid $5 million for his involvement, placing him among Hollywood's highest-paid actors.The deal was seen as a poor investment by industry professionals and attracted significant controversy prior to its release. Filming took place between November 1987 and March 1988, on a $25 million–$35 million budget and almost entirely on location in and around Fox Plaza in Los Angeles.\n\nSimilar Topic: World War Z Celebrates Its 10th Anniversary\n\nExpectations for Die Hard were low; some marketing efforts omitted Willis's image, ostensibly because the marketing team determined that the setting was as important as McClane. Upon its release in July 1988, initial reviews were mixed: criticism focused on its violence, plot, and Willis's performance, while McTiernan's direction and Rickman's charismatic portrayal of the villain Hans Gruber were praised. Defying predictions, Die Hard grossed approximately $140 million, becoming the year's tenth-highest-grossing film and the highest-grossing action film. Receiving four Academy Award nominations, it elevated Willis to leading-man status and made Rickman a celebrity.\n\nDie Hard has been critically re-evaluated and is now considered one of the greatest action films. The film produced a host of imitators; the term \"Die Hard \" became a shorthand for plots featuring overwhelming odds in a restricted environment, such as \"Die Hard on a bus\".\n\nThe film was the start of a franchise comprising the sequels Die Hard 2 (1990), Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995), Live Free or Die Hard (2007), and A Good Day to Die Hard (2013).\n\nDue to its Christmas Eve setting, Die Hard is also often named one of the best Christmas films, although its status as a Christmas film is disputed.\n\nHere is the goodreads synopsis of Nothing Lasts Forever:\n\nThis bestseller was the basis for the blockbuster film Die Hard starring Bruce Willis.\n\nHigh atop a Los Angeles skyscraper, an office Christmas party turns into a deadly cage-match between a lone New York City cop and a gang of international terrorists. Every action fan knows it could only be the explosive big-screen blockbuster Die Hard. But before Bruce Willis blew away audiences as unstoppable hero John McClane, author Roderick Thorp knocked out thriller readers with the bestseller that started it all.\n\nA dozen heavily armed terrorists have taken hostages, issued demands, and promised bloodshed all according to plan. But they haven't counted on a death-defying, one-man cavalry with no shoes, no backup, and no intention of going down easily. As hot-headed cops swarm outside, and cold-blooded killers wield machine guns and rocket launchers inside, the stage is set for the ultimate showdown between anti-hero and uber-villains. Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good fight to the death. Ho ho ho!\n\n​Source: Wikipedia"
