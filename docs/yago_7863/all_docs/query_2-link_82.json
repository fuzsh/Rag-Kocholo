        "text": "Street Fighter is a 1994 film about Col. Guile and various other martial arts heroes who fight against the tyranny of Dictator M. Bison and his cohorts. It is loosely based on the video game Street Fighter II.\n\nDirected and written by Steven E. de Souza.\n\nThe ultimate battle.taglines\n\nColonel Guile\n\n[edit]\n\nTroopers! I have just received new orders. Our superiors say the war is canceled, and we can all go home. Bison is getting paid off for his crimes. And our friends who have died here, will have died.. for nothing. But, we can all go home. Meanwhile, ideas like peace, freedom, and justice; they get packed up. But, we can all go home. Well.. I'm not going home. I'm going to get on my boat, and I'm going up-river, and I'm going to kick that son-of-a-bitch Bison's ass so HARD, that the next wannabe is going to feel it. Now, who wants to go home... and who wants to go with ME?!\n\nIt's the Collection Agency, Bison. Your ass is six months over-due, and it's mine.\n\nFour years of ROTC for this shit!\n\n[to Ken and Ryu] The only way you two are leaving is over my dead body.\n\n[to the citizens after he crashes into a building with his tank] You're all under arrest.\n\nAm I right Bison? Are you man enough to fight with me?\n\n[after defeating Bison] Bison, you're off the air!\n\n[to Chun-Li after revealing himself alive and okay after getting shot by Ken during the prison break] If I didn't give you an interview when I was alive, no way I'm gonna do it when I'm dead.\n\nBison\n\n[edit]\n\nI was hoping to face Guile personally on the battlefield. One gentleman warrior to another, in respectful combat, then I would snap his spine. Ah! The road not taken. But why? Why do they still call me a warlord? And mad?! All I want to do.. is to create the perfect genetic soldier! Not for power, not for evil, but for good! Carlos Blanka will be the first of many. They shall march out of my laboratory and sweep away every adversary, every creed, every nation! Until the very planet is in the loving grip of the Pax Bisonica. And then peace will reign...in the world. And all humanity... shall bow to me... in humble gratitude.\n\n[to hostages] The world thought very little of you my dear guests. Too little to pay the pittance I asked for. Too little to even mount a decent rescue attempt. Your masters at the AN call me a wild beast. So be it. You do not deserve the martial dignity of a firing squad. No! You shall be killed BY a wild beast! A beast born of my own genius!\n\nGame Over!!\n\nAnyone who opposes me will be destroyed!\n\n[to Guile] Something wrong Colonel? You come here prepared to fight a madman and instead you found a god?!\n\n[to Guile before attempting to defeat him] You still refuse to accept my god-hood? Keep your own god! In fact, this might be a good time to pray to him. For I beheld Satan as he fell FROM HEAVEN! LIKE LIGHTNING!!\n\nOthers\n\n[edit]\n\nDhalsim: If good men do nothing, that is evil enough.\n\nZangief: Quick, change the channel!\n\nDee Jay: Jamaica, here I come!\n\nCammy: [after arresting Chun Li] Darling, basic black's not you. Prison grey, perhaps?\n\nVega: Where were we?\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\n[Ryu and Ken are being taken to a van in chains to get close to Victor Sagat and his lackey, Vega.]\n\nRyu: You just had to come to this country didn't you. Why do I even listen to you? You can't sing. You can't fight. You can't even act.\n\nKen: You know what, Ryu, I'm sick of your crap.\n\n[Sagat and Vega turn around to see Ryu and Ken punching each other in shock as AN military policemen break up the fight.]\n\nMilitary Policeman: Hey! Hey! Break it up. Get in the truck.\n\n[The military policemen forces Ryu and Ken in the truck. The men in front move further to make room for Sagat and Vega due to knowing the two men's reputation.]\n\nChun Li: [to Bison] It was twenty years ago. You hadn't promoted yourself general yet. You were just a petty drug lord. Huh. You and your gang of murderers gathered your small ounce of courage to raid across the border for food, weapons, and slave labor. [indicates her binds] My father was the village magistrate. A simple man with a simple code: justice. He gathered a few people that he could stand against you. [chuckles] You and your bullies were driven back by farmers with pitchforks. My father saved his village at the cost of his own life. You had him shot as you ran away! A hero...at a thousand paces.\n\nBison: I'm sorry, I don't remember any of it.\n\nChun Li: You don't remember?\n\nBison: For you, the day Bison graced your village, was the most important day of your life. But for me, it was Tuesday.\n\nA.N. Official: [getting saluted by Guile] As you were, Colonel.\n\nColonel Guile: What a surprise. Welcome to the Shadaloo front. You're just in time for for the kickoff.\n\nA.N. Official: I'm afraid not Colonel. The Security Council has just voted. They've decided to negotiate.\n\nColonel Guile: You're joking.\n\nA.N. Official: We think we can deal with General Bison. You're instructed to call off the assault. Contact him. Request an extension of his deadline. We are prepared to pay the ransom demand.\n\nColonel Guile: Twenty billion dollars? What will prevent him from taking more hostages next month and asking for fifty billion? One-hundred billion? [gives him a light shove]\n\nA.N. Official: Colonel, have you lost your mind?\n\nColonel Guile: No, you've lost your balls!\n\nChun Li: [reporting on GNT World News] Colonel Guile? Colonel Guile! Colonel Guile, Chun-Li Zang, GNT News. May we speak to you please?\n\nColonel Guile: No.\n\nChun Li: But don't you want to speak to the world audience?\n\nColonel Guile: No, but I do want to talk to someone... [takes Chun Li's microphone] That bastard Bison! I know you like to look at yourself on television, you sick son of a bitch. So look at this! [flips Bison off]\n\nKen: I'm sorry I talked you into this.\n\nRyu: I'm sorry that I listened to you.\n\nDee Jay: [upon hearing that Colonel Guile is \"dead\"] That's great news general, congratulations!\n\nBison: On the contrary I mourn.\n\nDee Jay: Okay.\n\nVictor Sagat: Guile? Alive?\n\nBison: Of course! His death was designed to ingratiate his spies on you! [covers one eye] I guess you didn't see that, did you? Tch. This time Colonel, you die for real!\n\nRyu: I know you, you're Edmond Honda. The sumo from Hawaii. Almost made from Yokozuna.\n\nE. Honda: Until the Shadaloo Tong destroyed my repuation.\n\nBarlog: They did the same thing in my boxing career.\n\nKen: [looks at Chun Li] Don't tell me, figure skating?\n\nCammy: Still no sign of Bison.\n\nColonel Guile: He is probably hiding.\n\nBison: [on computer screen] Hiding? What do I have to fear from you? Worker ants, scurrying about with their pitiful weapons, afraid of the purity of unarmed combat!\n\nColonel Guile: Come out from behind the curtain wizard! Let's see how pure your combat really is. Come on!\n\nT. Hawk: Sir no, that's exactly what he wants!\n\nColonel Guile: No, T. Hawk. That's what we both want.\n\nBison: You have made me a happy man.\n\nColonel Guile: Next, I'll make you a dead one.\n\nColonel Guile: No weapon, Bison? What happened to the purity of unarmed combat?\n\nBison: This is merely superconductor electromagnetism, surely you've heard of it. It levitates bullet trains from Tokyo to Osaka. It levitates my desk, where I ride the saddle of the world. And it levitates... me!\n\nChun Li: Colonel Guile! How about that interview... for my network?\n\nColonel Guile: Sure, but only if you're wearing that dress.\n\nTaglines\n\n[edit]\n\nThe ultimate battle.\n\nAdventure is the name of the game.\n\nGet ready for the ultimate street fight!\n\nThe ultimate battle is about to begin.\n\nThis Christmas, shop early. The streets won't be safe.\n\nThe fight to save the world is on!\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nJean-Claude Van Damme - Colonel Gulie\n\nRaúl Juliá - Bison\n\nMing-Na Wen - Chun Li\n\nDamian Chapa - Ken\n\nKylie Minogue - Cammy\n\nSimon Callow - A.N.
