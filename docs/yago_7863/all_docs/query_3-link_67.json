        "text": "While Robert Pattinson fans await his big screen return next January in Bong Joon-ho‘s “Mickey17,” a new upcoming project of his looms on the horizon. And it’s a doozy, a risky venture that has Hollywood’s top studios in a frenzied bidding war. So, what is it? THR reports Pattinson will star in a remake of Andrzej Żuławski‘s 1981 film “Possession,” widely regarded as one of the best supernatural thrillers ever.\n\nREAD MORE: Most Anticipated 2024: 27 Blockbusters & Big Spectacle Movies To Watch\n\nAnd almost everyone wants in on this: A24, Netflix, Paramount, Sony, and Warner Bros. have bid on the package, with other studios reportedly looking to get in on the action. No surprise there, as Pattinson, a generational actor, hasn’t been on screen since 2022 in Matt Reeves‘ “The Batman.” But the director of the project may raise the eyebrows of some readers. “Smile” filmmaker Parker Finn will write, direct, and produce “Possession” through his Bad Feeling banner. “Smile” wasn’t a dud, but is Finn ready to tap into Żuławski’s singular delirium, or at least put a spin on it that’s comfortable Finn’s own? That’s up for date.\n\nStill, Finn is an up-and-coming director in horror, and he’s working with other producers also making their name in genre films right now. For instance, it doesn’t hurt that Roy Lee also produces “Possession” through Vertigo Entertainment. Lee also produced Zach Cregger‘s cult breakout “Barbarian” a couple of years ago, so he’s a good guy to have on board. And Pattinson will also produce the film through his Icki Eneo Arlo company, so he’s involved creatively, too. Also of note: it’s unclear who Pattinson plays in the new “Possession.” Ostensibly, he’d take over Sam Neill‘s lead role, but that still needs to be confirmed. Stay tuned as the film’s shooting schedule comes more into focus.\n\nA rep cinema mainstay, Żuławski’s “Possession” stars Neill as a spy in West Berlin who returns from a mission only for his wife, played by Isabella Adjani, to ask for a divorce. But the couple’s downward spiral is just beginning. As their marriage crumbles, so does Adjani’s sanity, with Żuławski’s film roiling out of control with infidelity, murder, doppelgangers, alien creatures, and an unforgettable climax. Derided by critics when first released, “Possession” has since reached cult status, with Adjani’s performance often heralded as an all-time great. And it’s only one of Żuławski’s arguably many masterpieces in his filmography; a Polish auteur still slept on eight years after his passing."
