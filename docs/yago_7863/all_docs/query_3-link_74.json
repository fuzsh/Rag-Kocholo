        "text": "Has Hollywood run out of ideas? Is the well of creativity so dry that they have to resort in remaking every classic in the books?\n\nThe latest example has Andrzej Żuławski’s 1981 horror masterpiece “Possession” being remade by “Smile” director Parker Finn. Please, no. There is nothing in Żuławski’s film that demands to be remade — it was so uniquely original and its own wild creation that any attempt to do so is misguided.\n\nAlas, it’s set to happen. Finn has quietly teamed up with Robert Pattinson, who will be producing and, possibly, starring in the film. In fact, the remake has spawned a bidding war between some top-notch studios, including A24, Netflix, Paramount, Sony and Warner Bros. Meetings are set to take place this week. (via THR)\n\nThe reception to the pitches has been extremely positive, with execs talking about the “batshit” and “out there” story but also its strong commercial potential. How to market the eventual movie is also part of the conversations.\n\nAll I can say is, best of luck to whoever ends up taking the role originally, and brilliantly, played by Isabelle Adjani. She was an on-screen FORCE in “Possession.” It’s possibly one of the best female performances I’ve ever seen.\n\nSet in West Berlin, “Possession” starred Sam Neill as a spy who returns home to his wife (Adjani) only to learn that she’s having an affair. She asks for a divorce; he hires a private investigator and that leads the story into this nightmare descent into utter and surreal hell.\n\nThis was Żuławski’s grueling meditation on marriage, written as a reaction to his own, which was also in its final days. “Possession” received very mixed reviews upon release but has since been reappraised as a classic, and for good reason — you’ve never a film quite like this one.\n\nFinn is currently in post on “Smile 2” which is set for release October 18. The “Possession” remake will most likely be his next project."
