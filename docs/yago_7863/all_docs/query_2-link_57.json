Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he’s John Wayne? Rambo? Marshal Dillon?”\n\nThe Bosque Film Society cordially invites everyone to attend our members-only 5th Annual Christmas Party beginning at 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday, December 17 featuring the widely debated greatest Christmas movie ever – 1988’s action thriller film “DIE HARD” – at The Cliftex Theatre in Clifton with an introductory presentation by Bosque Film Society founding board member and filmmaker-in residence J Matt Wallace.\n\nWhile the Bosque Film Society will be providing a seasonal adult beverage, wine and beer along with some Christmas treats, members are encouraged to contribute to the holiday spread by bringing their favorite holiday dish or desert. Since this will be a private showing, BYOB will be allowed, and the theatre concession stand will be open for purchases.\n\nIn addition to refreshments and Christmas treats provided for its members, the Bosque Film Society will be using a real-time voting system allowing members to choose 12 films for the 2025 Film Appreciation Night At The Movies Series, followed by the feature film “DIE HARD” at approximately 6:30 p.m. With Bosque Film Society members nominating their favorite films to be shown on the big screen once again, members attending the Christmas party will be voting on 225 nominated films, narrowing the field down to 12 films for our 2025 schedule.\n\nDirected by John McTiernan and written by Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza based on the 1979 novel Nothing Lasts Forever by Roderick Thorp, DIE HARD stars Bruce Willis, Alan Rickman, Alexander Godunov and Bonnie Bedelia with Reginald VelJohnson, William Atherton, Paul Gleason and Hart Bochner in supporting roles. Die Hard follows New York City police detective John McClane (Willis) who gets caught up in a terrorist takeover during a Christmas party held in the Los Angeles skyscraper Nakatomi Plaza while visiting his estranged wife.\n\nMcClane goes on a Christmas vacation to visit his wife Holly in Los Angeles where she works for the Nakatomi Corporation. While they are at the Nakatomi headquarters for a Christmas party, a group of robbers led by Hans Gruber take control of the building and hold everyone hostage – with the exception of John – while they plan to perform a lucrative heist. Unable to escape and with no immediate police response, John is forced to take matters into his own hands.\n\nUpon release in 1988, expectations for Die Hard were low. But since then, Die Hard has been critically re-evaluated and is now considered one of the greatest action films of all time. Often given credit for having revitalized the action genre, Die Hard depicts McClane as a vulnerable and fallible protagonist, in contrast to the muscle-bound and invincible heroes of other films of the period.\n\n“Come out to the coast, we’ll get together, have a few laughs…”\n\n“Happy trails, Hans.”\n\nSince this will be a private showing, BYOB will be allowed, and the theatre concession stand will be open for purchases. Although the event will be closed to the public, those wishing to become Bosque Film Society members Tuesday night will be admitted.\n\nIf you love movies, consider joining the Bosque Film Society’s non-profit efforts to support the historic Cliftex Theatre in Clifton, the longest continuously operating movie house in Texas, showing films on the silver screen since 1916.
