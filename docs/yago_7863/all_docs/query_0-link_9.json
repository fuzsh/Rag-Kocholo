Furniture begins to move on its own when he is around, and he doesn't remember any of it. After giving up on the protestants, the boy's parents turn to the catholic church for help. Father Bowden is a WWII veteran who is experiencing nightmares, flashbacks and other personal problems, including alcoholism. He is recruited by the archbishop to perform a series of exorcisms. This is the apparent true account of the last exorcism known to have been done by the catholic church.",

        "text": "This is such a stupid movie. I kind of loved it, but in a stupid way. Timothy Dalton is inexplicably tasked with playing an american, which just robs him of like 98% of his appeal. He has to try and exorcise this shady little ginger kid while juggling world war II PTSD and alcoholism, and damn is he melodramatic about it. The whole thing feels kind of like a propaganda effort to show that priests and young boys and college aged boys hang out together all the time, in a purely godly way and it's totally normal and cool.\n\nThe fun thing about Possessed is mainly the possession & exorcism scenes. The little kid does a great job and calls everyone‚Ä¶\n\nTimothy Dalton is doing his best to keep this sinking ship from bottoming out. Unfortunately he's only human and I cannot think of any talent being strong enough to save this wretched film.\n\nThe film claims to be the true life story that influenced \"The Exorcist\" yet it's mainly working on boring movie clich√©s that have developed years after the iconic Friedkin horror. There is a scene when the possessed child pretends to talk into a mike and starts performing a stand up comedy routine roasting the priest. WTF! It is not even ironically funny. How did they mess that up? There's little to no attention to the parents' torment, no work on allowing someone to care about the child,‚Ä¶\n\nHaven't watched this in a looong time. I had a phase in the early 2000's where as a teenager I became obsessed with exorcism and catholic rituals, mainly due to finally discovering The Exorcist. I read the books. I watched the movies. And this one is a doozy.\n\nThis Showtime TV movie is based on the only documented case of exorcism in America, the 1949 exorcism of Ronald Hunkeler (here called \"Robbie Mannheim\", and often listen as \"Roland Doe\", clearly a reference to \"John Doe\"). He was said to have been possessed by demonic forces and a Father William Bowdern (Timothy Dalton) performed several rites to help the boy. That case inspired William Peter Blatty to write his novel and‚Ä¶\n\nI mentioned a couple of times now across reviews I've posted for some previously unseen Roger Moore films I've watched of late, that Moore was the actor in the role of Bond who I felt least aware of outside of Bond, now I stand by that assertion, I did mention at least once or twice I'm sort of discrediting poor old George Lazenby on this one, he wasn't a professional actor and only had one film as Bond, I do intend to look in on films he put out after his brief stint as Bond because he certainly went on to do more, but limitedly through the years since OHMSS and not in the biggest productions one could imagine either.‚Ä¶\n\nHe can carry a film, save a film and by god he can act, so I‚Äôm now convinced that the only thing Timothy Dalton can‚Äôt do is an accent.\n\nI thought this might not be the best cure for my recent mild insomnia, but it‚Äôs not horrific at all. It‚Äôs actually fucking hilarious. I‚Äôve always maintained that Dalton knows exactly what kind of film he‚Äôs in and exactly what kind of performance to give and he demonstrates that again here. So entertaining (and oddly very attractive‚Ä¶? ‚Ä¶God help me. üòîüôè)\n\nNot unwatchable but probably not something I‚Äôd subject myself to again. But maybe to see priestly Dalton swearing like a sailor, gleefully taunting the actual Devil & inexplicably committing assault left‚Ä¶"
