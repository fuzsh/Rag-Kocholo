        "text": "This article may or may not be a stub, but it's definitely missing something.\n\nSpecifically: Trimming trivia and making info about credits.\n\nYou can help the Street Fighter Wiki by giving us what we need.\n\nStreet Fighter (fully titled as Street Fighter: The Ultimate Battle) is a 1994 American action film written and directed by Steven E. de Souza based on Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers (1993).\n\nThe movie features an international and multicultural cast and was also produced in the United States by Amblin Entertainment, Capcom of America, HarMoviesMony Entertainment, HOG! Pictures Unlimited and Virgin Interactive and distributed by Universal Pictures.\n\nThe movie altered the plot of the original game and motives of the Street Fighter characters as the story is Guile's spin-off. It also significantly lightened the tone of the adaptation, inserting several comical interludes into the mix and the plot taking place in one fictional Asian country instead of traveling the world.\n\nTwo video game tie-ins based on the movie were released which used digitized footage of the actors performing fight moves, similar to the presentation in the Mortal Kombat series of games.\n\nPlot[]\n\nThere are several major players in the plot of the movie: Guile, Chun-Li, Ken, Ryu, Dhalsim, and Charlie (Blanka) and M. Bison. The plot described below follows primarily Guile. The other characters have supporting roles in the story.\n\nThe movie takes place in the fictional nation of Shadaloo in South East Asia (the movie was shot mostly in Thailand, although some interior shots were filmed at a studio in Australia`s Gold Coast, and maps at the beginning of the movie show Shadaloo occupying a segment of modern-day Burma). After months of fighting, a multinational military force of the Allied Nations has managed to enter the city of \"Shadaloo City\". The Allied Nations is fighting against the armed forces of drug lord turned General M. Bison, who has recently captured a couple of dozen AN workers. Bison makes his demands in a live two-way TV broadcast with William F. Guile, the regional commander of the AN forces. If he is not paid $20 billion in three days he will kill the hostages and the world will hold Guile and the AN accountable.\n\nGuile's assistant Cammy is only able to partially trace Bison's signal. From that it can be determined that Bison's hideout is somewhere in the river-delta region outside Shadaloo City. After one of the thugs of Victor Sagat, head of the Shadaloo Tong, attempts to assassinate Guile, which Guile himself quickly foils, he figures out that Sagat is the main arms-supplier for Bison.\n\nMeanwhile, Bison orders a team of captive scientists to experiment on Guile`s close friend and comrade-in-arms Charlie (Blanka); (known as Carlos Blanka in the movie) he is among several AN soldiers who were captured by Bison along with the relief workers. The chief scientist is Dr Dhalsim, who has been ordered to turn Blanka into an aggressive mutant-soldier using volatile chemicals to warp his body and violent videos to warp his mind. Bison intends Blanka to be the first of many such super-soldiers who will help him conquer the world and bring about what he calls the \"Pax Bisonica\".\n\nGuile recruits Ryu Hoshi and Ken Masters, two foreign operators who were arrested along with Sagat while fighting a cage match - they had tried to cheat Sagat beforehand by selling him fake weapons, and Sagat was not amused - and attempts to infiltrate them into Sagat's gang. He decides to stage a prison-break and his own death in order to find out the location of Bison's hideout via a homing device carried by Ryu and Ken. Guile's plan hits a snag when a GNT News Reporter Chun-Li Xiang (spelled \"Zang\" in the film; played by Ming-Na), who is out for Bison's blood, finds out that Guile is alive and with the help of her partners, Sumo wrestler E. Honda and professional boxer Balrog, attempts to kill Bison and Sagat with a truck bomb while they are engaged in arms trade at a thieves' camp. The explosion destroys much of Bison's arms cache but fails to kill the dictator. The plan thus fails (in part because Bison and Sagat are tipped off by Ken and Ryu), and Chun-Li and her friends are captured.\n\nRyu and Ken are welcomed as Bison troopers, and they even receive karate suits with matching colors (Ryu gets a white suit while Ken gets a red one). Once in the fortress, they free Balrog and Honda, and the four of them go to \"save\" Chun-Li, who is delivering an unexpectedly severe beating to a surprised Bison. Unfortunately, the arrival of Honda, et al. interrupts Chun-Li, giving Bison a chance to escape and trapping the five of them in a room flooding with gas.\n\nRyu and Ken's homing device is tracked by satellite, which also detects the explosion at Bison's camp, and the AN is able to locate Bison's headquarters in an abandoned temple. Since Bison's air defenses are too deadly, Guile orders an amphibious assault on the base. As the troops comprising the strike force stand in salute and are preparing to march out, a group of peace negotiators arrives to inform Guile that the invasion is no longer authorized, since the ransom demand is about to be paid. Guile makes a speech to the troops protesting what he sees as appeasement and decides to go ahead with the assault.\n\nMeanwhile Guile, T. Hawk and Cammy head up river to lead the attack in a stealth-boat, which they use to blow up part of Bison's radar system and keep it from detecting the main force approaching Bison`s headquarters. Bison notices the attack and manages to compromise the boat's stealth-mode, making Guile a perfect target for underwater mines which Bison can control manually. The boat is blown out of the water but Guile and his comrades escape in time.\n\nGuile heads in to Bison's fort alone while T. Hawk and Cammy stay and wait for the rest of the attack-party. Guile falls in to the laboratory of Dr. Dhalsim where he encounters his friend Carlos \"Charlie\" Blanka who has been warped in to a powerful beast. Unbeknownst to Bison, Dhalsim has begun showing Blanka video scenes of peace, goodness, and love in an attempt to disrupt the super-soldier experiment. After realizing that Bison attempts to use Blanka to execute the hostages he hides in Blanka's incubation chamber and takes Bison by surprise. Unfortunately he is not able to prevent \"red-alert\" from going off and Cammy and T. Hawk end up in a tight spot as Bison`s troopers quickly mobilize. The AN attack party is not far behind, and once the amphibious force lands on shore just outside Bison`s hideout the battle begins. The five heroes captured by Bison (Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, Balrog, and Honda) use this as an opportunity to free themselves and help Guile.\n\nWhile some of the heroes try to free the hostages, Ken wants to leave the battle now that the military is there. Ryu disagrees and goes back in to fight, but as Ken is leaving, he sees the monitors of the cameras spread out through Bison's base. He sees Sagat and Vega trying to ambush Ryu. Ken goes back in to help Ryu, and the two of them defeat Vega and Sagat after an intense fight. Meanwhile, Guile and Bison engage in a one-on-one fight. Guile seems to be winning and finally knocks Bison out cold, causing Guile to think that Bison is dead, but then an automatic revival system brings Bison back to life and charges his body with great amounts of electromagnetism, allowing him to shoot lightning bolts and fly across the air. After taking a serious beating, Guile manages to kick Bison and sends him flying against his gigantic monitor wall. As he crashes, there are severe electrical disturbances which destabilize the power system of the base. As the base sounds the alarm, the heroes find and release the hostages just in time, and everyone evacuates.\n\nGuile manages to find the laboratory and talk to Dhalsim and Blanka one last time before he is forced to leave them behind; Blanka, now a warped beast with red hair and green skin, cannot return to human society changed like this, and Dhalsim decides not to leave Blanka to die alone and to pay for his own part in having done this to him. When the temple comes crashing down after an explosion everyone thinks that Guile is dead, but then he appears from amongst the smoke.\n\nThe movie ends semi-humorously, after Guile converses with Chun-Li, Ryu, Ken, Cammy, Zangief, Balrog, E-Honda, T-Hawk and Sawada, they see the last ruins of the temple fall and take their familiar win poses as the camera freezes and fades out.\n\nIn the home video version of the film, at the end of the closing credits a scene shows the ruins of M. Bison's lair, as the main computer announces that its batteries are recharging from solar power and it begins fibrillating Bison's heart with electricity. As a close up of a computer screen reveals a readout: \"initializing... run programs... world domination, replay\", Bison's fist smashes through the rubble, apparently having been resurrected. The computer greets him: \"Welcome back General M. Bison.\"\n\nCast[]\n\nActor/Actress Character Jean-Claude Van Damme Colonel William F. Guile - an American A.N. Colonel. Raúl Juliá General M.

This caused many changes in character background and behavior. Cammy and T. Hawk's characters were reduced largely to supporting characters for Guile whilst Ken and Ryu were made con men who try to steal money from criminals leading them to direct conflict with Sagat, the underworld boss at Shadaloo. The film attempts to stay geographically consistent by setting the events in South East Asia (in the game Bison's hideout is in Thailand). Notably Balrog switches sides in this movie becoming one of the good guys while Dee Jay and Zangief are traded in as Bison's lackeys, largely for comical relief purposes. However, Zangief and Dee Jay redeem themselves in the end. The characters of Blanka and Charlie were combined for the film in order to ground Guile's story (though in the game universe the characters are separate, however, Charlie's appearance in this film predates his appearance in the Street Fighter Alpha series). Only the characters of Guile, Chun-Li and Bison remain unchanged for the most part. The character of Fei Long was dropped from the movie with the character of Captain Sawada considered a replacement of sorts.\n\nNonetheless, Steven E. deSouza attempted to have some direct referencing of the game content in the film's production design. For instance in Bison's private room, a hatrack is shown which contains identically-designed officer's caps, each colored as one of Bison's palette-swapped costumes from Street Fighter II. In addition, the control panel for Bison's levitating desk is the joystick and buttons to a Street Fighter II arcade game and after he finishes using them he comments \"Game over!\".\n\nDirector Steven de Souza notes in the DVD commentary that the crew tried to make references to some of the stages in the game. The fresco found in the training room of Bison's base (a tsunami) is a reproduction of the stamp found in Honda's stage, on the wall of a bathroom, in the original game. The Buddha statue in Sagat's hideout is taken from the one present in his stage, and according to de Souza, the docks that the AN army uses and the bell in Bison's fortress are references to Ken and Bison's stages respectively. Bison's base features a large bell at its center similar to the one in his stage.\n\nDuring the holding yard brawl with Ryu and Ken, there are barrels that have \"Capcom\" painted on them. The barrel used in the magic-act at the Thieves' Market also says Capcom on the lid. The lines \"Are you man enough to fight with me?\" and \"Anyone who opposes me shall be destroyed\" are direct references to the game Street Fighter II (Guile and Bison's win quotes in the SNES version, respectively). The final scene in which all the good guys (including Zangief) are celebrating with their signature win poses is a direct reference to an image which appears when the player completes the SNES version of Street Fighter II and Super Street Fighter II in the highest difficult level, and without losing rounds, which shows an image with all the characters.\n\nIn the Japanese dub version of the film, the characters Balrog (the African-American boxer), Vega (the Spanish cage fighter) and Bison (the leader of Shadaloo) were all addressed by their western names, despite the fact in the games that the three bosses are named differently in Japan.\n\nOutside references[]\n\nThe release date, December 23, 1994, is the 34th birthday of main character Guile according to the character's profile in Street Fighter II. The game designers at Capcom have referenced the movie a few times. The first was in X-Men vs. Street Fighter. In one of the stages, Blanka is in the background. However, when Charlie is fighting on the stage, Blanka is replaced by Beast. The second time was in Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike, one of Chun-Li's win quotes is: \"Hey, leave me alone! I'm a fighter, not a news reporter!\" Similarly, in Mega Man 9, Chun-Li appears as an anchorwoman on a new broadcast during the game's opening cutscene. In Street Fighter × Tekken, Bad Box Art Mega Man's victory quote against Blanka is \"Roll says your name is Jimmy, but I saw this movie once and it had this guy named Charlie...\".\n\nSignature moves[]\n\nMany of the characters use signature moves from the games, except when the moves are too fantastic (i.e. projectiles, electricity, etc.) to work, as Steven E. de Sousa claims he didn't have the time on his film schedule to have their superpowered moves to be developed. The sole exception is M. Bison, who uses devices built into his costume to produce \"superconductor-electromagnetism\" that is different from Psycho Power.\n\nDuring the fight scene where Ryu and Ken were battling off Sagat's thugs in his secretively, notorious arena, Ryu and Ken both use the Tomoe Nage on two thugs at the same time. After that, during the intro of the Ryu vs. Vega weaponless cage-match, Vega strikes one of his win poses from the game by doing a backflip, then holding up his mask, only to show off in front of his audiences. Sagat uses his Tiger Knee on Ryu and Ken. Ryu fires a Hadoken during his second battle with Vega. Inexplicably, this Hadoken is cut out from the US broadcast version (shown regularly on USA and Sci-Fi Channel) along with most of the fight with Vega (including Ryu's scarring of his opponent using a furnace). The version of the movie that aired on the Canadian sci-fi channel Space, however, kept these scenes intact. The \"Hadoken\" effect was created without special effects due to time constraints: Byron Mann simply mimed the action, and the screen went entirely white for a frame or two, creating the illusion of a flash, in Capcom vs. SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001, Sakura Kasugano has a signature move called Hadosho, which looks similar to Ryu's supposed Hadoken in the live-action movie. Vega attacks Ryu with his Rolling Crystal Flash. Ken uses a Shoryuken on Sagat which is a spinning uppercut with no jump whatsoever. Ryu knocks Vega out with a \"short kick\" version of his Tatsumaki Senpukyaku.\n\nGuile using a \"short kick\" version of his Flash Kick twice during his fight with M. Bison. E. Honda performing his Hundred Hand Slap on Zangief in their final fight scene. Cammy performs variations on two of her moves: She does a basic forward kick to a Bison trooper, and her voice is dubbed in saying, \"Thrust Kick!\" (her lips are clearly not moving). She also performs a hurricanrana on a Bison trooper, snapping his neck while perched on his shoulders. T. Hawk does a version of his Mexican Typhoon, basically a chokeslam. While not direct adaptations of the movies.\n\n[]\n\nComics[]\n\nA one shot comic book adaptation of the film, titled Street Fighter: The Battle for Shadaloo, was published by DC Comics in 1994. The comic was drawn by Nick J. Napolitano and written by Mike McAvennie. A Japanese one-shot manga adaptation by Takayuki Sakai was also published in the June 1995 issue of CoroCoro Comics Special.\n\nVideo Games[]\n\nTwo video games based on the film were produced. The first was an arcade game titled Street Fighter: The Movie that was produced by American developer Incredible Studios, published by Toy HeadQuarters Publishing and distributed by Capcom.\n\nThe second was a home video game developed by Capcom also titled Street Fighter: The Movie, released for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. Despite sharing the same title, neither game is a port of the other, although they both used the same digitized footage of the film's cast posing as the characters in each game.\n\nAnimated series[]\n\nIn 1995, an animated series premiered on USA Network. Street Fighter was a semi-sequel to the live-action film that referenced and carried over much content from the latter (Charlie and Blanka being the same character, Captain Sawada and the Allied Nations, Shadaloo being a country, etc.) while using character designs and story elements from the original video games.\n\nReception[]\n\nDespite negative reviews the movie did make a profit. It grossed 33 million domestically and 66 million worldwide, earning almost triple its production budget of 35 million.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nMany plot elements of the film, such as Blanka's identity and Dhalsim's role as a scientist, were reused in the American-produced 1995 Street Fighter animated series, though certain elements were also altered to match the game's lore (such as Balrog and Dee Jay switching alignments to their canon roles).\n\nThe controls to M. Bison's floating \"desk\" are identical to the joystick & button layouts controls of the Super Street Fighter II arcade cabinet.\n\nVega is presented with a certain degree of mutism, and has very few lines in the film:\n\nHe is seen shouting \"Go! Go!\" during the escape from the AN headquarters.\n\nHe says \"I told you we couldn't trust them...\" off-camera, the audience does not realize it is him until Bison directly refers to him.\n\nAs he is putting on his mask prior to his fight with Ryu he says \"Where were we?\".\n\nHis final line is \"Die!\" which he says during his fight with Ryu.\n\nThe film includes characters from the video games up to and including Super Street Fighter II. Most notably absent is Fei Long; rumor has it that the character of Captain Sawada was supposed to be Fei Long, but was changed and renamed because the producers felt that the original video game character was \"too generic\".\n\nThe final scene with all the characters who escaped the collapsing Shadaloo base is a real-life recreation of an animation from the video game, where all the characters are on screen at the same time, and do their \"win\" animation (which is often seen when one beats the game, after the end credits).\n\nThe final amphibious attack on M. Bison's compound, filmed on location in Thailand, was originally supposed to be an air assault. The Thai government wouldn't allow the use of its airspace for the large number of aircraft the scene would require, so the producers changed the final battle to a boat assault instead. This is subtly lampshaded in the movie through Guile's line, \"An attack from the air is impossible.\"\n\nFabio Lanzoni was considered for the role of Vega.\n\nDuring the second night of filming in Bangkok, Damian Chapa, who played Ken, needed to say the name of Byron Mann's character, Ryu. But no one, Chapa, Mann or even director Steven de Souza knew for sure how to pronounce it. Mann, who'd done some research, believed the Japanese pronunciation to be \"ree-ewe,\" like \"free\" - with a silent f and Ew. Chapa took three passes at saying the name. For whatever reason, even with phonetic help, Chapa couldn't say \"Ryu\" correctly. De Souza called cut and pointed at Mann. In one stroke of direction, de Souza then said to Mann: \"We'll just call you Rye-you.\" However, Raúl Juliá pronounces it correctly in the only scene where M. Bison refers to Ryu by name. (Ryu's Japanese name is fluently pronounced as \"Diu\", which rhymes with the name of Mortal Kombat's Liu.)\n\nThis film was dedicated to Raúl Juliá, who died after the film was completed. In fact, he had been diagnosed with stomach cancer and knew he could be shooting his last film before accepting the role, which he did at the behest of his two children, who were fans of the games. The movie's closing title card reads: \"FOR RAUL: Vaya Con Dios\", which translates from Spanish to \"go with God\".\n\nIn the \"magic trick\" scene where Chun-Li is put in a barrel and then made to disappear, the word \"Capcom\" can be seen printed in yellow on top of the orange barrel lid.\n\nDuring the fight between Ryu and Vega, a text on the wall is written in Esperanto: \"Atenti: Incinerato - Esti zorga\", which means: \"Caution: Incinerator - Be careful\".\n\nThe fresco found in the training room of Bison's base (a replica of Katsushika Hokusai's Great Wave off Kanagawa) is a reproduction of the stamp found in E. Honda's SFII stage.\n\nJean-Claude Van Damme turned down the role of Johnny Cage in the Mortal Kombat film to do this one. Notably, Cage's character had been a parody of Van Damme himself.\n\nWhen Dhalsim is showing Bison his progress on Blanka's brainwashing transformation by using monitors, one of the footages that is seen on a monitor is of a man being shot in the head by a Nazi was real historic footage from World War II.\n\nGOOFY HOLLER: Toward the end of the movie when the A.N. forces first arrive at Bison's fortress, one of Bison's troopers is sent flying from an explosion. This makes it one of the few non-animated and non-Disney films to use the sound effect.\n\nDhalsim, an Indian Yogi in the games who is instead depicted as a short and meek British-Indian doctor, is shown doing psychic/praying-like poses in his official and promotional movie-still photos, which implies that he is still a Yoga expert.\n\nDhalsim’s second-to-last scene his arms were splashed with mutation chemicals after getting knocked into them, possibly foreshadowing what would become of him in a sequel, which would turn him into what he is shown as to mirror his in-game counterpart:\n\nThe mutation chemicals on Dhalsim's arms is a nod to the character's limb-stretching abilities that he is known for.\n\nHe also starts balding with three bloody cuts on his scalp while he turns into a darker complexion as a result of side effects from the chemicals, this was shown to bare a resemblance to his bronze skin and the red-paint on his head.\n\nDhalsim is also shown with tattered clothes with his white pants still on as well as his skull neck-shackles being turned into a skull neck-bracelet, he possibly burned his clothes and melted his thin chains off while indirectly self-discovering that he has the ability to breathe fire.\n\nGuile is an Allied Nation Colonel in the film. Most anime refer to him as \"Captain/Sergeant Guile, United States Air Force\", while in the game canon, Guile was formerly an elite teammate of the Special Operation Forces who moved onto being a U.S.A.F. Major in the present.\n\nThe AN Forces Radio DJ is played by Adrian Cronauer, whose exploits as an Armed Forces Radio DJ in Vietnam were dramatized in wikipedia:Good MorningGood Morning, Vietnam (1987), where his role was played by Robin Williams. He even gives a variation of his signature sign-on phrase: \"Good morning, Shadoloo!\".\n\nThe character Carlos Blanka is a combination of Blanka and Charlie. In the video games Blanka is a feral savage, with green skin and long orange hair, resembling a monster more than a human. Charlie is Guile's deceased war buddy according to his profile in Street Fighter II, and his appearance was not known until his debut in Street Fighter Alpha in 1995. Blanka is played by Robert Mammone, but a more muscular stunt double was used for some wider shots.\n\nWhile Guile and Chun-Li wear their trademark costumes by the film's climax, they are actually different colors from the original Street Fighter II variations. In the film, Guile is wearing his blue tank top/camouflage pants, which is based on his Turbo version. Chun-Li is wearing her red lady dragon dress, which is based on her Champion Edition version, though with a variety of changes (no puffy sleeves or white boots, for example).\n\nThere is an oil painting in Bison's private quarters of a frowning clown holding a cluster of balloons and wearing Bison's signature cap. This is a reference to the famous \"Pogo the Clown\" oil paintings done by the infamous serial killer John Wayne Gacy.\n\nIn 2003, Jean-Claude Van Damme was actually working on a sequel, Street Fighter II, for Universal, which had released the original. Several cast members had been hired to join him in the sequel, including his Universal Soldier co-star Dolph Lundgren in an unrevealed role, Australian actress Holly Valance would have replaced Kylie Minogue as Cammy, and Damian Chapa would have reprised his role as Ken. Byron Mann was also reportedly in talks to return as Ryu. However, after a few years of trying to get the sequel off the ground, the project never materialized and any plans for a sequel were scrapped in favor of a reboot, Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li, when the Street Fighter film rights reverted from Universal Pictures to 20th Century Fox.\n\nAccording to an on-line interview with MTV, Jean-Claude Van Damme was originally offered the role of Guile for Fox's Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li. He would've been the only original cast member to reprise the role for the Street Fighter reboot, but Van Damme turned down their offer. After the theatrical release of The Legend of Chun-Li, which was intended to be better and more successful than the original Street Fighter film, The Legend of Chun-Li actually made less money at the box office than Street Fighter and was considered by many fans and critics as an inferior film compared to the original.\n\nDuring the fight between Ryu and Vega near the end of the movie, Ryu's shirtless appearance and scarring makes his appearance resemble the final fight scene from Enter the Dragon (1973), with Ryu being both a homage to Bruce Lee, and another replacement to Fei Long.\n\nEver since when Vega scarred Ryu's stomach with his claw, Ryu's gi's black belt was missing and it remained missing for the remainder of the film.\n\nIn the film, E. Honda is Hawaiian rather than Japanese. And his kabuki face paint is replaced by bloody scars during the final fight.\n\nBalrog's actor, Grand L. Bush, had previously played a boxer in an episode of the TV show Police Squad!.\n\nOne of the variant covers for issue seven of UDON's Street Fighter Unlimited comic series is a tribute to the movie's poster.[1]\n\nThe movie came out in December 23rd 1994. This date is actually Guile's birthday.\n\nGallery[]\n\nHeroes[]\n\nVillains[]\n\nMiscellaneous[]\n\nVideos[]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nWikipedia article"
