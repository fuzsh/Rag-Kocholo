        "text": "Die Hard (1988)\n\nDirected by John McTiernan.\n\nScreenplay by Jeb Stuart & Steven E. de Souza, based on the novel by Roderick Thorp.\n\nThis is a re-watch.\n\nOkay so – extant within the movie DIE HARD is a very important, very bothersome issue that – while I’m going about my business in my everyday, non-film-blog life – pops into my head & annoys me more often than I care to admit. Lucky for us, this issue pops up within the first 5 minutes of this film, so I can talk about it immediately & then we can all move on to bigger, brighter, & less idiotic things.\n\nY’all…my problem is with the toe fists.\n\n…Toe fists??? Toe? Fists? Setting up the ridiculous barefootedness that accompanies our hero’s actions for pretty much the entire duration of the film, John McClane (Bruce Willis)’s row-mate on the airplane to Los Angeles suggests that McClane remove his shoes and make toe fists on the next carpet he finds, to help him relieve the (alleged) anxieties of air travel. WTF is this advice, you guys?! If BooBoo has to be barefoot for all of his coming adventures…why couldn’t they come up with a better reason than motherfucking toe fists? Why couldn’t McClane, you know, step in a puddle or some mud on the way to the Plaza, then the shoes get knocked out of an open window after he’s placed them on the sill to dry, or something? Or perhaps when he arrives, he feels he’s wearing footwear that doesn’t comply with Office Christmas Party Dresscode, and while he’s changing out of them, an office dog comes by & snatches them?\n\n…The best they could do was toe fists? Seriously??? Toe fists. Goddamn it, that’s dumb.\n\nWhew. Alright. Okay. I’ve been wanting to get that off my chest for literal years. Now…for the rest of this movie.\n\nBonnie Bedelia (Mrs. McClane)(or is it Ms. Gennaro?) looks a lot like Mary Astor in this! I know that’s a strange comparison to make – but if we look past the fluffed-out ’80s hair – the resemblance is definitely there.\n\nArgyle (De’voreaux White) is an awesome name for a character.\n\n(However – where does the teddy bear & McClane’s luggage go, when he goes inside the Plaza? Argyle just keeps both in his car, and…then what? I don’t understand these logistics – in the event that McClane doesn’t call Argyle & say he’s been jilted & is headed back down…what does Argyle do with his left-behind belongings? Deliver them to his house? Sell them at an auction? This is concerning to me.)\n\nNext problem…er, question: are we really supposed to believe that Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) & his team are detailedly familiar with the entire physical layout of this building, the innerworkings of this company’s intricately coded computer system, can recite Mr. Takagi (James Shigeta)’s entire educational & personal histories on demand, flawlessly – – but they don’t know what the dude looks like???\n\nUm. What!\n\n“I will count to three. There will not be a ‘four.'” — Gruber, to (now identified)(phew, close one!) Takagi.\n\nWell, no shit, man – you just said you were counting to three. Of course there’s not gonna be a motherfucking “four.”\n\nDumbass!\n\nPoor Mr. Takagi. I liked him. He seemed cool.\n\n“Now I have a machine gun / HO-HO-HO”\n\nI mean…there’s no way McClane writes that neatly, that quickly…especially if he’s using this dead cat’s blood. I mean, come on, prop people. We’re not stupid. (Do we think he used an unseen red Sharpie? Even if that was the case…those letters, on that sweatshirt material, under that kind of time-pressure…it seems like a notably questionable scenario to me.)\n\nHowever – handwriting neatness plausibility issues aside – the message & the Santa Hat placed on the elevator deadling are hilariously badass, and I love it.\n\nThe lighting of this film is really cool. The movie’s got a lot of flaws – but the lighting design is undeniably awesome.\n\nI wonder how much “shooting in/around an elevator shaft” knowledge cinematographer Jan de Bont learned from this & applied to SPEED (1994), which, six years later, he’d go on to direct. Probably a fair amount, huh?\n\n“See if there’s a black and white that can do a drive by”?! “See if there’s a black and white that can do a drive by“?! A man transmits a message of emergency over your “reserved” radio signal, yelling that there’s a hostage situation – AND THEN IS INTERRUPTED BY MACHINE GUN FIRE WHICH ALMOST BURSTS YOUR EARDRUMS – and that – accompanied by an eye roll – is the best you can do?!\n\nLike…what a fucking dumbbunny dweeb that Radio Lady is! Who would ever respond to a radio transmission like that, made by someone who is clearly – based on the voice – not a 6-year-old kid feeling pranky??? That’s so goddamn stupid.\n\nWriters…write better.\n\nAha! Yes! Write like this (aka: context for what is the film’s most famous & well-remembered line):\n\nHans: “…But who are you? Just another American who saw too many movies as a child? Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he’s John Wayne? Rambo? Marshall Dillon?”\n\nMcClane: “I was always kind of partial to Roy Rogers, actually. I really like those sequined shirts.”\n\nHans: “Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?”\n\nMcClane: “Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker!”\n\n(I love that line, by the way, and the natural, conversationally relevant way it comes about. It’s not just said as a bizarro hero tagline, you know? It actually makes sense within the narrative dialogue.)\n\nAlso: it’s here that Bruce Willis really sinks into the John McClane character – and, in a demented sort of way that is hard to describe – the fun that he’s having being this guy (and let’s be clear, he fucking commits to this role & the partial mania that comes with it) begins to seep out of the screen and encompass us as viewers.\n\nBruce Willis fucking goes for it in this movie, y’all – and I have a ton of respect for him for that.\n\nSergeant Al Pal (sorry – Sergeant Al Powell)(played by Reginald Vel Johnson) is the best. He’s a smartling who’s also fully dialed into his intuition & just keeps arguing his perspective – despite Mr. Vernon showing up & trying to ruin everything by being a total idiot, the way – well, you know – Mr. Vernon is wont to do.\n\n(For the record, Paul Gleason is called “Dwayne T. Robinson” here; hi, I’m Dawn Glory, and I’m a THE BREAKFAST CLUB person, nice to meet you.)\n\n(Also – the film does a good – though admittedly unsubtle – job at making you care about Sgt. Al Pal from the start, with the whole ‘buying snacks for his pregnant wife’ character introduction scene. When he does his “drive by” at Nakatomi Plaza, the tension & viewer-felt anxiety on his behalf is much stronger knowing this detail about him than it would be if we’d just seen a random cop car pull off the freeway & head over there to investigate, instead.)\n\nClarence Gilyard Jr. does an entertainingly solid job as Theo, the bad guy computer-vault whiz. The way he delivers his security-camera-aided commentary on approaching policemen & vehicles is excellent. I think his gleefully animated “OH MY GOD – the quarterback is toast!” (after the LAPD’s dumbass robo-vehicle gets exploded into a fireball) is one of my favorite moments in the film.\n\nLike…so maybe this is “trifles” – but how in the world does the entire building not blow up and/or collapse when Cowboy John drops that block of C-4 down the elevator shaft?\n\nThis is some kind of architectural miracle/phenomenon, right? So why does no one comment on it?\n\n(PS: Great work on designing/approving (?) this building’s structure, Mr. Takagi. I am very sorry you are not around to see this triumph. RIP.)\n\nThe choice to cut to Argyle’s reaction to Cowboy McClane’s telling-off of Mr. Dwayne T. Robinson via walkie talkie was a champion one.\n\nOn Hans’s negotiation request regarding the internationally held prisoners…including “the Asian Dawn”:\n\nHans, to a quizzically expressioned Karl (Alexander Godunov), with a shrug: “I read about them in Time Magazine!”\n\nNext: “I’m Agent Johnson. This is Special Agent Johnson. No relation,” says the Johnson played by Grand L. Bush. Ha.\n\nThe moment on the roof when Cowboy McClane stumbles on a wandering Hans – and Hans, on a dime, assumes the character of a scared, fleeing building employee – presents a very interesting situation, acting-wise. Do we believe Hans’s performance, and thus buy McClane’s belief in it? Yes. But is this because Alan Rickman is a world-class actor? Or because Hans is?\n\nFlip that one over in your head a couple times. Let me know what you come up with.\n\nBlehhh. The bare feet + shards of glass scene(s). That is painfully nasty, man.\n\nHowever! The visual orchestration of the scene that precedes it is really quite stellar, from a visual effects perspective.\n\n“Ode to Joy” backing the vault springing open with the third Johnson’s shutdown of “Grid 212” is…inspired, and I love it.\n\n[Edit: IMDb tells me that this musical choice was made at the suggestion of director McTiernan, based on Kubrick’s use of “Ode to Joy” in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (1971). This is fabulous information, since I have never seen that film – and probably never will – as it is on my (very thoughtfully curated, I assure you) ‘Do Not Watch This Ever’ List!]\n\nBruce Willis is also shockingly great in his ‘Bathroom Goodbye via Al Pal’ scene. He does an exceptional job with the emotion necessary in that scene – the way he plays it fits both the moment & character perfectly.\n\n“She’s heard me say ‘I love you’ a thousand times. She never heard me say ‘I’m sorry.'”\n\nThat is some good, ‘simple is beautiful’ writing, right there. Kudos, Writing Squad.\n\nCan we talk about what an absolute idiot asshat that reporter Thornburg (William Atherton) is?! Busting into a nanny-watched house under threat of deportation (poor Pauline!) to interview tiny children while their parents are being held hostage, on live TV?! What the fuck, man?! Who does that shit?!\n\nThe shot of McClane dangling several stories off the roof – as the roof explodes – firing bullets into the glass window in front of him so he can crash through it……\n\nHahahahaha.\n\nAnyone who went to this movie to see ACTION! did not leave disappointed – we can be damn sure of that.\n\nOh my God – I did not remember this part:\n\nHans: “Well, this time, John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.”\n\nCowboy: “That was Gary Cooper, asshole.”\n\n(The first time I saw DIE HARD, I must not have seen HIGH NOON (1952) yet. Get out of town, “Yipee-ki-yay”…this is actually my favorite line!)\n\nJohn Wayne walking into the sunset with Grace Kelly. HA! Oh, Hans Gruber. You.\n\nThe falling, blowing-in-the-wind sheets of computer paper are a nice touch…with it being Christmas, and that being as good of a snowfall as LA is likely to get.\n\nSgt. Al Pal & Cowboy John’s buddy-ship is such a fun time…and it’s cool that Ms. Gennaro Mrs. McClane (I see you, Mrs. Maine), Argyle, and Sgt. Al Pal all get their own chances to kick some bad guy ass, in their own unique ways, before the Heroism Party is over for good.\n\nSo – this sort of movie is not exactly my cup of tea…but really & truly, you guys – this film is a goddamn triumph of an action movie. Sure, it has some dumb lines of dialogue & some dumb pieces of narrative…but as a whole, it’s an engaging, exciting experience that’s (pretty) cleverly written & sublimely lit.\n\nWould I recommend this film to everyone? Hahaha. 100% no. But for enjoyers of action/modern-day excitement films – this one is right at the top of the list & cannot be missed.\n\n“That was Gary Cooper, asshole.”\n\nHahahaha.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
