        "text": "Every great film starts with a great script. This is a universal truth of the movie industry. While an inexperienced director can ruin an excellent screenplay, even the most revered auteur can't turn a bad script into a good movie. This is great news for screenwriters who care deeply about their craft — and terrible news for the robot behind ChatGPT.\n\nIf you're in the former group, you've come to the right place. One way aspiring screenwriters can improve their craft is to consume screenplays that got it right. That's why we've compiled a list of the best screenplays to read if you're looking to become a better screenwriter.\n\nWhy You Should Be Reading Scripts as a Screenwriter\n\nAll the screenwriting guides in the world can't compete with the benefits of reading stellar movie scripts. Exposing yourself to the work of great screenwriters is the best way to master vital script elements like narrative structure, character development, dialogue, and pacing. Most importantly, reading scripts will help you to find your own unique voice as a screenwriter.\n\nThe best way to find this voice is to consume scripts from a variety of genres. Even if you identify exclusively as a horror buff or sci-fi nerd, reading scripts from across genres will only sharpen your craft and open your creative mind. And don't stop at genre diversity — seek out scripts from writers of all backgrounds, as well.\n\nHow to Read a Script\n\nBecoming a better screenwriter isn't just about reading great scripts. It's about reading great scripts actively. Turn your brain all the way on and dive in with a purpose. Pay close attention to elements like scene transitions, storytelling techniques, and structure. Read the script more than once. Like great movies, great screenplays will reveal something new with every read. Focus on plot the first time around, dialogue the second, and structure the third. Above all, take notes — you'll appreciate having them when you're in the depths of writing your own great screenplay.\n\n10 of the Greatest Screenplays Ever Written\n\nTo kickstart your masterclass, we've selected 10 of the greatest screenplays ever written. While art may be subjective, the following screenplays are widely acknowledged in the industry as some of the best scripts to come out of Hollywood. From Thelma and Louise to American Beauty to Get Out, our list is composed of screenplays that have more than earned their place in the American cinematic canon. They span genres and eras but all have one important thing in common — they've got a lot to teach aspiring screenwriters. So start reading.\n\n01. \"Die Hard\" by Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza\n\nYear of release: 2006\n\nScreenwriters: Todd Field, Tom Perrotta\n\nDirector: Todd Field\n\nTodd Field built his directing career on the humanization of unsavory characters and Little Children is no exception. Based on a novel penned by Tom Perrotta, Little Children is the story of an affair between two unhappy suburban parents, set against the backdrop of a quiet neighborhood whose peace has been ruptured by the arrival of a convicted pedophile. Perrotta is first and foremost a novelist, which could be why this screenplay reads at times like a novel. Together, Field and Perrotta managed to adapt Perrotta's book into a screenplay without losing the most important elements, like Perrotta's penchant for visual description. The script also functions as a study on how to pull off narration, a challenge screenwriters have struggled with for generations. In Little Children, the narrator supports the story without resorting to distraction or cheap exposition. Whether you're a novelist looking to try your hand at screenwriting or you'd like to adapt a book of your own, Little Children has a lot to teach you.\n\n08. \"Juno\" by Diablo Cody\n\nYear of release: 2017\n\nScreenwriter: Jordan Peele\n\nDirector: Jordan Peele\n\nIt's practically written into law that one must always include Jordan Peele's debut on best screenplay lists — and for good reason. Released during a significant period of American political upheaval, Get Out tells the story of Chris Washington, a young black man who travels to the suburbs to meet his white girlfriend's family and finds that they belong to a cult that invades and inhabits the minds and bodies of black people. It's said that Peele wrote over 200 drafts of Get Out, including one that ends with Chris going to jail. That level of commitment and care is readily apparent throughout the script, which reads less like a debut than the work of a seasoned screenwriter. There's no shortage of takeaways from Peele's screenplay but his use of symbolism is particularly deft. In one of the most iconic scenes, Chris is hypnotized by his girlfriend's mother, who sends him to \"the sunken place\" — a symbol of the marginalization of black people. Later, Chris picks cotton out of the chair he's tied to and stuffs it into his ears so as to block out the hypnotic trigger, subverting the oppressive trope of an enslaved person picking cotton. I could go on — or you can simply pick up a copy of Get Out and read it for yourself.\n\nHelp Turn a Great Screenplay into a Great Movie!\n\nFrom mastering three act structure to crafting three-dimensional characters, learning to write a great screenplay is a process. The good news is you don't have to drop six figures on a film degree to get started — most of the above scripts can be downloaded for free on the Internet! Reading the best screenplays across genres and eras should be a regular part of any aspiring filmmaker’s routine.\n\nOnce you're finished reading these recommendations, hop on over to Kinolime to participate as a reader in their inaugural screenwriting competition.
