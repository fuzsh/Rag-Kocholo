        "text": "Sonic the Hedgehog - the spiky blue hero who has spent his life fighting Doctor Robotnik - is making his way to the big screen.\n\nThe computer game character will move from SEGA consoles to film with a mix of CGI and live action techniques, according to the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nBut will the move from the gamer's chair to the cinema seat pay off for Sonic and friends?\n\nWe take a look at some of the other gaming giants that have become blockbusters - and whether they have been a success.\n\nStreet Fighter (1994)\n\nStarring: Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue\n\nThe famous fighting game made its way out of the arcades and into live action when one of the action genre's biggest stars took on the role.\n\nJean-Claude Van Damme plays Colonel William F. Guile, regional commander of the Allied Nations, fighting against military dictator and drug baron General M. Bison, played by Raul Julia.\n\nWith the help of Sergeant Cammy - played by Kylie Minogue - Bison is stopped from taking over the world with a swift roundhouse kick into a wall of television screens.\n\nThe film earned more than $3m (£2.3m) on its opening day and came in at number three in the box office charts.\n\nReviews: \"If Steven E de Souza, who wrote and directed 'Street Fighter', has captured the look and mood of a video game, the film is an otherwise dreary, overstuffed hodgepodge of poorly edited martial arts sequences and often unintelligible dialogue\" - New York Times.\n\n\"Though it offers mild entertainment through campy one-liners and the overacting of the late Raul Julia, Street Fighter's nonstop action sequences are not enough to make up for a predictable, uneven storyline\" - Rotten Tomatoes\n\nLara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001)\n\nStarring: Angelina Jolie and Jon Voight\n\nThe legendary character of computer screens across the globe - and many a gamer's first crush - Lara Croft was brought to life by Angelina Jolie in this 2001 film.\n\nCroft is an archaeologist and explorer in search of answers after her father disappeared in mysterious circumstances.\n\nIn this film, she is on the hunt for the Triangle of Light, but she is not the only one, as she faces rival tomb raiders and the Illuminati on her quest.\n\nThe movie debuted at number one in the box office charts, taking in more than $48m (£36m) and led to a sequel, also starring Jolie, called Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life.\n\nAnother movie is due in 2018, but Jolie has been replaced by Alicia Vikander.\n\nReviews: \"In the games, the joystick jockey is supposed to be tempted to guide Lara to an undignified comeuppance as often as he gets her through perils - but a smug heroine you half-want to see splattered over the landscape isn't a workable movie notion\" - Empire\n\n\"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider elevates goofiness to an art form. Here is a movie so monumentally silly, yet so wondrous to look at, that only a churl could find fault\" - Roger Ebert\n\nResident Evil (2002)\n\nStarring: Milla Jovovich\n\nThe Umbrella Corporation is central to both the Resident Evil computer games and the 2002 film of the same name.\n\nIt operates a top secret genetic research facility that goes under the name of The Hive, but things go wrong and the release of the T-Virus leads to zombies popping up in every corner.\n\nFormer security officer Alice - played by Milla Jovovich - tries to fight her way out with her team, but it is far from an easy journey.\n\nThis movie did not just give life to one sequel, but an entire series, with seven films in total to date.\n\nReviews: \"Game fans will be disappointed. Zombie fans will be disappointed. Paul Anderson's fan will be disappointed. If you want scary, boot up your games console\" - Empire\n\n\"Like other video game adaptations, Resident Evil is loud, violent, formulaic, and cheesy\" - Rotten Tomatoes\n\nSilent Hill (2006)\n\nStarring: Radha Mitchell and Sean Bean\n\nKnown as one of the most chilling and eerie computer games to grace the small screen, when entertainment company Konami agreed to grant the rights to a film version of Silent, it was always going to give viewers a fright.\n\nRose Da Silva, played by Radha Mitchell, takes her adopted daughter to the town of Silent Hill in search of a cure for her sleep walking and nightmares.\n\nBut after blacking out when crashing her car, Rosa's daughter goes missing and she discovers a darker side to the abandoned town.\n\nThe film grossed almost $100m (£75m) around the globe and led to a sequel - Silent Hill: Revelations - in 2012.\n\nReviews: \"A step in the right direction for console-to-screen transitions and a twisted masterpiece of set design. Ultimately, though, it's a little too much like watching someone else play the game\" - Empire\n\n\"The tagline for Silent Hill reads, 'Once you enter this world, there's no turning back.' Fortunately, that's not true for moviegoers who might accidentally wander into this aberrant excuse for entertainment\" - PluggedIn.Com\n\nAssassin's Creed (2016)\n\nStarring: Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard\n\nThe cross-platform epic of Assassin's Creed has seen games set over multiple historical eras as the Assassins and Templars fight it out for superiority.\n\nCome 2016, this battle came to the big screen with Hollywood A-listers onboard.\n\nIn the film, Michael Fassbender plays two characters - Cal Lynch in the 21st Century and his ancestor Aguilar de Nerha. Aguilar is of the Assassin's Brotherhood and the last man known to have had possession of the Apple of Eden, which can be used to stop violence.\n\nThe story follows Aguilar and his partner Maria as fight to find the Apple, and protect it."
