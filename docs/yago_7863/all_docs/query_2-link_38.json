        "text": "The OP expressed surprise that it has been as close as it is, which I did, also, take to mean he was expecting a landslide for the “yes” vote.\n\nIt's not what the OP expected:\n\nEven Die Hard explains the Christmas debate best:\n\nI was expecting this to be a controversial subject therefore I was expecting a 50/50. If anything, I expected the poll to favor the no vote but not for much, I was wrong, there are more \"yes\" Backers\n\nThe OP started this thread because of another one that's been hanging around for a while, he knew very well many people don't think it is a Christmas movie and there would be lots of no votes.\n\nIt's been seen over and over here, there is no subject where you will be able to get 100% agreement. Since the OP -lets say- is winning, to me the poster I've quoted fails to see there are more than 50% people supporting the OP which is as good as it gets when it comes to divided opinions, that's the reason they are divided, you always get pretty much as many people for as you get against.\n\nAs per my previous post, unless you don't know what is going on in this forum, this thread was triggered by another to which the OP was posting on, and obviously reading too. I won't underestimate OP thinking that he managed to skip all the negative posts on that thread to then expect getting only yes votes this other thread which is about the same subject.\n\nI have lost my ability to be surprised by anything but sometimes these forums do a good job at reviving it.\n\nLet me check with Hans...\n\nNo. No it is not. It's a heist / action-adventure movie where about 10 minutes of it concern Christmas. Christmas movies actually have to incorporate Christmas as part of the story and characters. It's a Wonderful Life, A Christmas Carol, The Santa Clause, Elf, Miracle on 34th Street, Home Alone... those are legitimate Christmas movies.\n\nNoted DP Jan de Bont worked on the film for three months, and he told me when we remastered the film around 1995 that he did not believe the film was a \"Christmas movie.\" The film was released in July 1988 and was intended as just a straight action film with occasional moments of comedy and lots of violence -- so much so that it's rated R. In fact, de Bont's initial answer was, \"are you crazy?\" But he also said that director John McTiernan would probably say, \"I don't care what you call it as long as the audience pays to see it and I get a percentage.\"\n\nWe also asked Bruce Willis about it in the 1990s, and he said:\n\nSteven E. de Souza: Die Hard IS a Christmas Movie\n\nAlso,\n\n8 reasons why ‘Die Hard’ is a Christmas movie\n\n(From the article.)\n\n8. The screenwriter who wrote it says it’s a Christmas movie. The script for “Die Hard” was written by Steven E. de Souza. He’s been asked in interviews and through social media several times whether or not the film is a Christmas movie and he always confirms it is. In fact, in 2018 de Souza posted a chart on social media that showed that “Die Hard” was just as much of a holiday film as “White Christmas.”\n\nChristmas is the reason the events in the movie take place when they do. The gang have planned a fake hostage crisis to cover for their robbery. A hostage crisis on Christmas Eve, at a Christmas party. Christmas is quite literally “part of the story”.\n\nI just watched Miracle on 34th Street the other day and surely it’s a Thanksgiving movie?\n\nNot to be a smart-aleck, but that is the Macy's Thankgiving parade in the background, isn't it?\n\nSome interesting trivia you may or may not already know, the original marketing for this movie went out its way to hide the Christmas theme of the movie, which came out in June.\n\nOh, and Die Hard is a Christmas movie."
