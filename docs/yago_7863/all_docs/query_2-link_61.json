        "text": "Written by Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza, Die Hard is an American action film released in 1988 starring Bruce Willis, Bonnie Bedelia, Alan Rickman, Reginald VelJohnson, and William Atherton, and directed by John McTiernan. The movie is based on a novel by Roderick Thorp titled Nothing Lasts Forever.\n\nDie Hard was filmed in and is set in Los Angeles, but a latermovie in the series (Die Hard 3) is set in New York City.\n\nDie Hard 2 (Die Hard 2: Die Harder)\n\nDie Hard 2, also known as Die Hard 2: Die Harder, is a 1990 film starring Bruce Willis reprising his role as police detective John McClane and co-stars Bonnie Bedelia, reprising her role as Holly McClane. The movie is based on a novel by Walter Wager entitled 58 Minutes. Die Hard 2 was the first movie to have a digitally-manipulated Matte Painting.\n\nThough it takes place in Dulles International Airport in Virginia, the movie was actually filmed in many other locations. Many of the airport terminal shots were from LAX in Los Angeles, other shots were from many runways of other airports, such as Stapleton International Airport in Denver, CO. Some runway scenes were also shot at Alpena County Regional Airport in Alpena, MI.\n\nDie Hard 3 (Die Hard with a Vengeance)\n\nDie Hard with a Vengeance, also known as Die Hard 3, is the third film in the Die Hard series released in 1995. It was directed by John McTiernan and written by Jonathan Hensleigh.\n\nMany of the scenes were filmed in New York City, and you will get a chance to see these sites on our Central Park TV & Movie Sites Tour. You will see the New York City Water Tunnel No. 3, a then-unfinished tunnel connecting the city to reservoirs in the Catskill Mountains in upstate New York, where the chase scenes in the tunnel were filmed.\n\nA pivotal tense scene is also shot in Tompkins Square Park, which is a prominent location on the brand new East Village TV & Movie Sites Walking Tour. On this tour, you’ll also see locations from Law & Order: SVU, The Godfather, Will & Grace, and more.\n\nDon’t forget the subway station entrance at 72nd St. and Broadway where John McClane and Zeus (Samuel Jackson) race to pick up the pay phone in order to beat the deadline imposed by the mad bomber Simon (Jeremy Irons). Also, the Tompkins Square Park at Avenue A and 7th St. is where John and Zeus struggled to solve a riddle in order to prevent the detonation of a bomb.\n\nThere is also the Federal Reserve Building at William and Liberty St. where Simon and his team tried to remove the city’s gold supply. Sam went in through the front entrance while the others drove trucks along the side of the building.\n\nDie Hard 4 (Live Free or Die Hard)\n\nLive Free or Die Hard, released as Die Hard 4.0 or Die Hard 4, is the fourth installment in this series. The film takes place some 19 years after the first film, and sees McClane face a gang of cyber-terrorism.\n\nFilming for Live Free or Die Hard started in downtown Baltimore, Maryland on September 23, 2006 but it didn’t go quite as expected. Willis was injured on January 24, 2007 during a fight scene, when he was kicked above his right eye. The injury was regarded as “no big deal” and Willis saw a doctor and went home for the rest of the day.\n\nUnfortunately, Bruce Willis’ stunt double was seriously injured when he fell twenty-five feet to the pavement. He suffered broken bones in his face and fractures in both wrists and the production was temporarily shut down. Willis picked up the tab at area hotels for his stunt double’s parents and visited him a number of times at the hospital.\n\nAfter the injuries, the movie was finally able to get going and was eventually released in June 2007. Most locations in this film were in Los Angeles, California such as 20th Century Fox Studios, Los Angeles Center Studios, Los Angeles International Airport, Hahn Plaza in the University of Southern California and many others.\n\nCome take this tour with us and catch a glimpse of some of the sites in this Die Hard thrilling series!\n\n* In an effort to stay current, we are constantly updating our tours with new locations and cannot guarantee the presence of locations mentioned on our site.
