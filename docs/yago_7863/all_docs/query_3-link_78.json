        "text": "Vertical Entertainment has released the trailer for a new demonic possession horror thriller titled All Fun and Games. The movie stars Asa Butterfield (Ender’s Game) as a young man who finds himself getting possessed by a demon after he participates in a game involving a mysterious cursed old knife.\n\nThe film “explores the elements of cruelty inherent in children’s games – Flashlight Tag, Hangman, Hide & Seek – and what happens when the games go too far. A group of Salem teens who discover a cursed knife that unleashes a demon that forces them to play gruesome, deadly versions of childhood games where there can be no winners, only survivors.”\n\nAfter Butterfield’s character Marcus is possessed, he starts to hunt down his friends through a series of deadly childhood games.\n\nAll Fun and Games is co-directed by Ari Costa and Eren Celeboglu from a screenplay they co-wrote with JJ Braider. The movie is also produced by Joe and Anthony Russo through their production company ARGO.\n\nThe film also stars Natalia Dyer (Stranger Things), Benjamin Evan Ainsworth (The Haunting of Bly Manor), Laurel Marsden (Ms. Marvel), Kolton Stewart (Locke & Key), Annabeth Gish (Midnight Mass), Keith David (The Thing), Summer H. Howell (Curse of Chucky) and more.\n\nThe film will be released in theaters and on VOD on September 1."
