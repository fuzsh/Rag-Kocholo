        "text": "Lets not fool ourselves here - Street Fighter is a piece of shit.\n\nBut I'll be damned if time isn't being kind to this car crash. Watching it as a straight comedy last night in a packed cinema, it was a hoot.\n\nThings that are bad about Street Fighter = Everything.\n\nThings that are amazing in Street Fighter =\n\n- Raul Julia's straight delivery of a proposterous script.\n\n- Van Damme's inspirational call to arms.\n\n- Van Damme calling Bison a dick head.\n\n- Bison's clown painting.\n\n- Bison's horseback painting.\n\n- Everything Zangief - EVERYTHING. The guy is dynamite.\n\n- Dr Dhalsim's vanishing hair.\n\n- Blanka maintaining his humanity watching video's of Dolphins and Puppy's.\n\n- Van Damme telling a polititian that he's lost his balls.\n\n- Bison's Arcade Controller.\n\n- E.Honda & Zangief's slow motion fight with overdubbed Godzilla sound effects.\n\nThe list could easily go on. This movie is a riot.\n\nbasically a PG-13 paul verhoeven movie. van damme in this is so coked out of his mind that it feels like he's acting on a different plane of existence, and all the actors named after the videogame's characters are stumbling around trying to make sense of what, if anything, are their character motivations/emotions, which half of the time results in them under-acting and the other half of the time results in de souza's pulpy dialogue achieving this gawky iconic humor that makes this film so incredibly quotable.\n\nand raul julia... what a fucking legend. too good for this world.\n\nthis a luminously special film, an essential 90s text. everyone should be required to watch it in order to truly understand american cinema.\n\nI never liked this movie as a kid. I was wrong.\n\nIn the Holy 90s Video Game Trinity of Live Action Adaptations, this is clearly God.\n\nMORTAL KOMBAT is weighed down by trying to be cool, and SUPER MARIO BROTHERS is made by people who are filled with shame at having to make a video game movie, while STREET FIGHTER is simply a goof 'em up with a game cast, big colourful sets, and all the characters I vaguely know (I was a MORTAL KOMBAT boy) doing fun stuff. JCVD gives a rousing speech! The big Russian guy makes jokes! Raul Julia steals the entire show while on the brink of death! As a lover of Steven E. de Souza's other masterpiece HUDSON HAWK, I should have given this another chance sooner.\n\nOh, I forgot DOUBLE DRAGON was a live-action movie that came out in the 90s. In religious terms, it's clearly Hot Stuff, The Little Devil.\n\n“For you, the day Bison graced your village was the most important day of your life. But for me, it was Tuesday.”\n\nThis movie is camp that takes itself seriously, and it’s kind of great. Raul Julia as Bison was incredible, he’s worth watching the movie for.\n\n“Jean-Claude was coked out of his mind” is an actual quote from the director about making the film.... but it made $105 million on a $35 million budget soooo I would still call it a success!\n\nHoly campy fun, Batman! Err, Guile??\n\nThe reference is absolutely appropriate, as this really brings the same kind of cheesy charm as Adam West's Caped Crusader. Kinda-sorta representations of sometimes silly but nostalgicly beloved characters in often ridiculous costumes, all having way too much fun.\n\nHaving not seen this since maybe theaters, I didn't have a lot in the way of expectations. Way better than I anticipated!\n\nSpecial love to Raul Julia, who knew he was on his way out while filming. He's having maybe the most fun on set."
