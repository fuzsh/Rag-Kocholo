        "text": "Just two years after 2023’s The Pope’s Exorcist, Russell Crowe stars in yet another exorcism movie this year with The Exorcism and this time he’s the one who seems to be possessed…\n\nCheck out the trailer here…\n\nThe Exorcism tells the story of Anthony Miller (Crowe), a troubled actor, who begins to unravel while shooting a supernatural horror film. His estranged daughter wonders if he is slipping back into his past addictions or if there is something more sinister at play.\n\nDirected by Joshua John Miller (The Final Girls), the movie also stars Ryan Simpkins (Fear Stree: Part Two), Sam Worthington (Avatar), Chloe Bailey (Swarm), Adam Goldberg (Taken TV series) and David Hyde Pierce (Frasier)."
