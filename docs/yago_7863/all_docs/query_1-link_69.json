        "text": "Directed by: Perry Henzell | Written by: Perry Henzell and Trevor D. Rhone\n\nThe Harder They Come is not the first movie I ever saw, nor the first movie that had a profound impact on me. But it is a movie that I revisit over and over and over again. And the more people that get a chance to see this movie, the happier I'm going to be. It is a Jamaican movie starring Jimmy Cliff, and it has the record for the longest unbroken theatrical run of an indie movie at the Orson Welles Cinema in Cambridge. It's a classic. Trust me on that.\n\nObviously it's Jamaican, so I recognize so much of the movie. I connect with it at a deep elemental level. But it's a journey of an outlaw, a rebel, a person who insists on being able to live by his own personal mandate. That's always a thrilling hero's journey, if you will, for me. I'll spoil it — it ends tragically — but nonetheless, it's a great outlaw movie.\n\nWritten and Directed by: James Cameron\n\nAliens is a flawless movie, and I'll tell you why I think it's a flawless movie: Think how tough it is coming off Ridley Scott's first movie. You're Jim Cameron, how do you leave your own imprint on this burgeoning franchise? And what Jim Cameron did was he told a character piece, but utilizing a genre. Sigourney Weaver is, for all intents and purposes, a career woman. She finds an adoptive child on the terraformed planet, and it ignites in her a sense of maternal responsibility. And it culminates in the climactic sequence with her confronting an alien who is doing exactly the same thing — a mother trying to protect her brood. It's this amazing character piece with this incredible lead performance by Sigourney Weaver, that honors both the genre and the truth of that character journey as well. And it's hard to imagine a better execution of an elevated genre movie.\n\nDirected by: John McTiernan | Written by: Jeb Stuart and Steven E. de Souza\n\nI know it's not original to put Die Hard on the list, but Die Hard is a flawless movie. I'm going to avoid the debate as to whether it's a Christmas movie or not. I will say, for me, it's a Christmas movie, but no one else is obliged to agree with that.\n\nBut what it is is an amazing execution of Joseph Campbell's mandate of a hero's journey. At the opening of the movie, John McClane is a man who has treated the largess of his family carelessly. He has been careless with his wife and his time with her, and consequently, runs the grave risk of losing her. He has to go on this hero's journey, and cross many raging rivers, meet many goblins, witches, demons along the way, and only by going through that journey, can he re-earn his place in his wife's affections, and his place in that family constellation. It is an amazing genre exercise. It's an action movie, but it's a character movie first and foremost.\n\nAll of those movies that I just listed have, to me, the one essential ingredient of a great movie: And that is that you can watch them over, and over, and over again. And the magic of the movies is when you get to, 'Get away from her, you...' I'm not sure if I'm allowed to use that word. Or 'Yippee ki-yay' — not sure I'm allowed to use that word either! Or, 'This is the beginning of an amazing friendship.' The magic of movies is that you can know how they end, but you are still going to be sitting on the edge of your seat each time you watch those movies, because they're so flawlessly constructed. So, those are five movies that are justifiable classics, and influence me, and I think about them all the time."
