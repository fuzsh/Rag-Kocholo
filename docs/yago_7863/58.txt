This real-life version of The Exorcist includes all the ghost-story hooks -- flying objects, blood messages burned into flesh, Latin phrases, screaming obscenities and church skeptics. While Father Bowdern sees saving a boy possessed by the devil as a "moral imperative," the archbishop is more concerned about the church's public reputation. A terrifying movie, made all the more frightful because it's real.
