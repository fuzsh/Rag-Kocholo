He enrolled at the Art Student League and the New York School of Industrial Design, honing his artistic talents. Upon graduation, he worked in the art department at a publishing house.\n\nHe is well-known for the lively illustrations and contemporary style he used in more than 300 books, some of which he adapted from fairly tales or wrote himself. His books, Anatole (1957) and Anatole and the Cat (1958), both written by Eve Titus, received Caldecott Honors.\n\nMr. Galdone died in 1986."
