        "text": "Barrie Ingham voices Basil, the titular mouse detective who must stop the evil Professor Ratigan, voiced by Vincent Price, from becoming the supreme ruler of all mousedom.\n\nGoing deeper into the 1980s, Disney animation was sinking so badly that the division almost shut down and in one last gasp, decided to go back to its roots with a film about a mouse. The Great Mouse Detective ended up being exactly what the company needed. This fantastic film not only saved the studio but was able to stop the bleeding in time for a reverse into what became the Disney Renaissance. Personally, I’ve always liked this movie and will never say no to getting a chance to watching it again. It may not be my favorite animated Disney movie, but it’s certainly up there.\n\nWhat makes this film so great is the near ludicrous idea it throws viewers, where a mouse who lives under Sherlock Holmes’ apartment takes it upon himself to also be a well-known and quirky detective, and not only delivers on the premise but takes the idea and just doesn’t stop trying to top itself with each spirited scene not only landing with the amount of vigorous it needs to be enjoyable but containing enough energy to outdo what came before. It starts incredibly strong with a kidnapping before giving us Basil who demonstrates his weirdness immediately before introducing Ratigan with a villain song where he kills a character simply for saying the wrong thing. From there we have a toy shop chase made interesting where every character uses their surroundings to their advantage, a Victorian strip tease that ends up being one of my favorite Disney songs, an over the top trap with an over the top means of escaping, one of the best climactic fights I’ve ever seen in an animated film and an ending that lets us all breathe and take in the wild ride we’ve just been on.\n\nI really like the characters too. Basil is essentially Holmes as a mouse with an establishing moment that highlights his lightning intellect and eccentricities, such as shooting a group of pillows to test a bullet. He’s made better by Olivia and Dawson as his supporting characters, where his lack of social skills is rebuffed, giving him character growth where he brings out his more empathetic side (which I would say is the exact purpose of a supporting character).\n\nAt the same time, Ratigan is one of my favorite Disney villains because of how fun he is along with how great he works as a foil to Basil. Where Basil acts rudely even to people he likes at first, Ratigan is outright friendly to his minions, except when they say the wrong thing, but is immediately shown to be downright evil from the song that he and his minions sing. Also, while Basil goes through character development to be kinder and more empathetic, Ratigan devolves. He goes from a sly, collected evil genius who acts like he’s got everything figured out to this crazed psycho, flying into an unstoppable rage in order to kill his archnemesis.\n\nI’m happy to say that every time I watch The Great Mouse Detective, I find that it keeps holding up as a fun adventure. There’s something for everyone here and if you haven’t seen this one yet, I highly recommend you do.\n\nAwards\n\nNew wpDataTable"
