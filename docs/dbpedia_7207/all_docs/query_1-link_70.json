        "text": "Did you now there's a miniature mouse world beneath our own? No, neither did I! Well in this world Basil of Baker Street replaces Sherlock Holmes, Dr Dawson is his sidekick Watson, and there is even a Great Mouse Queen! What happens in this film? Let me fill you in on the facts!!\n\nYou look up at your father in delight, as he shows you how your new clockwork present works, you hear something but push it out of your mind, you're too happy to worry! Rattle, Rattle, who's that trying to get in? Your dad puts you in a cupboard and you peep out to see a peg-legged bat wrestling with your father, the cupboard door is suddenly forced shut; and by the time you get it open...your father is gone! You think for a while but the only solution you can think of is something you read in a newspaper, the Great Mouse Detective; Basil of Baker Street.\n\nThe story you just imagined is Olivia... er..Flamerhanger's? No? ...whatever, it's her story!\n\nAfter she set out to find Basil a kindly gentleman called Dr Dawson hears her crying inside a boot then, after comforting her, he takes her to Basil who not only plays the violin as well as Sherlock, but also lives in his house!\n\nBasil soon reveals that Olivia's father has been mouse-napped by the most diabolical, odious criminal mind...Professor Ratigan, the Rat...oops, er Mouse who will commit any crime!\n\nBasil is soon chasing Ratigan, only to find he is plotting he most evil scheme of schemes ever schemed. The Queen is in mortal peril..\n\nMake sure your prepared, dear watcher, to disappear down London's Lowest, Vilest mouse holes as you watch this movie.\n\nSome reasons older people will like this film is because the evil Prof Ratigan is voiced by old-time well-known \"Horror\" movie actor: Vincent Price! In his words he said, \"If it wasn't Disney I would be insulted at being animated!\" Disney did the character of Ratigan very well and everyone will love to hate him. Basil is always after this dastardly Ra...MOUSE!\n\nAlthough this film is rated U I think it's a 6+ firstly the rating is \"very mild\" whereas I think it's more than that; a toy-shop scene is VERY creepy, and would scare young people, and even scares me, though I'm 11...But not MUCH.\n\nHowever there are elements which littler kids will like, such as Toby, a dog who is both comical, sweet and seemingly immune to danger. The other element is of course the cute Olivia Flabberbum... NO?! Whatever!\n\nAll in all this film was pretty good, they did the animation well, and definitely chose great characteristics for everyone. There are (of course) elements which some people would not like, understand or approve of, such a a pub scene which includes a dance which I don't understand fully but I do know it's based around something rude.\n\nAnd sometimes (especially when you're not in the right mind frame) the film can drag slightly.\n\nSo I rate this film 3.5 stars (or I would if I could!) because it's a movie to watch in the evening when you have kids, but it's not necessarily first choice.\n\nPrint this review"
