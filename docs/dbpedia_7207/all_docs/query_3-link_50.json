This version stands out! Paul Galdone, a Caldecott winning illustrator, gives this cautionary story charm and humor with his delightful ink and wash illustrations full fof telling details and facial expressions. While other versions just have the repetitive response, “Not I”, standing on its own, Galdone has each charcter next to the words adding depth and personality to these adorable shirkers! However, this much-loved book not only offers a sage message, but also shows children what it takes to make a cake from the ground up.",
