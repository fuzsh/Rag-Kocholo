Movie Filming of \" 11th Hour \" at Bluff Park Rare Books on Broadway in Long Beach Finished Shooting Recently. The Entire Movie for Fox Was Shot in the Bookstore. Film Called, The 11th Hour, Had to do with Strangers meeting a Grown up Alice in Wonderland on Rainy Night in the Bookstore. My how Alice Has Changed !Filming of the Movie The Eleventh Hour aka The Journey Beneath Alice's Bed was An Original Screenplay by David Daniels . This is Foxs way of Discovering New & Upcoming Filmmakers & Actors & Camera People ETC, And it started Raining right on Cue when Filming Started ! The Filmmakers are doing this Short Film on a Relatively Small Budget , but who knows it Might Become the Next Blair Witch Project. It Will be Shown on TV's Bravo , Fox Family Channel & on the Internet ! It Turned out to be a Wonderful Experience & the Cast & Crew were Delightful. After 12 Hours or so of shooting, Around 4 A.M. each morning when filming concluded for that day , they were careful to put everything Back in its Original Place. Filming in such Cramped Quarters must have been a Challenge for the Young Filmmakers ! One of the Stars of the Film is Dead Ringer for a Rita Hayworth lookalike ! Other Characters were a Devil, Billionaire, Derelict, Etc. They also used a Lightning Machine whose Bright Light seemed to Give People Headaches & Many Wore Sunglasses During the Shoot ! They rented the recently Closed Antique Store next door to us for the Food Catering & for Actors to Hang out in waiting for Their Scenes !We At BPRB would highly recommend the Rental of your Premises if asked for Movie Filming !
