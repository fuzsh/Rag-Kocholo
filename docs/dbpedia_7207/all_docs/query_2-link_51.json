        "text": "Hey you, yeah you the one in the back row do you like mysteries??? If so then Basil The Great Mouse Detective is the film for you. It is jam packed with excitement and fun you will be hanging off the edge of your seat!!! No film can beat this one!!! Come on, help Olivia, Mr.Dawsal and Basil on a mission to defeat Professor Ratigan in his evil tracks.\n\nOlivia Flaversham , who is an adorable, cute young mouse, lives with her father in a toyshop for mice. On Olivia's birthday her father gives herva handcrafted ballerina doll. All of a sudden the windows smash and the lights gooff when they turn on her father is gone....... When all hope is lost Mr. Dawsal finds Olivia in a moldy, crusty boot. Mr Dawsal realises what happened so he took Olivia to Basil the great mouse detective. Is all hope still lost or with Basil on board will everything change???\n\nBasil The Great Mouse Detective is similar to Sherlock Holmes because Basil solves mysteries like Sherlock Holmes. To add to that, Sherlock has an assistant : Doctor Watson and Mr Dawsal acts like an assistant to Basil the great mouse detective.\n\nI thought the film was very thrilling because although the film is 30 years old the animation was truly amazing. Well the music built some tension to the watcher, it was very quiet at points but that is what builds the most tension really, it being silent and then it just goes BOOM!!! I literary nearly fell off my seat, it was that good :-D!!! I felt as though I was there in the room or the streets with them following the whole way.\n\nThis is definitely a film to watch with the whole family. You may even sing along\n\n'Even meaner? You mean it?\n\nWorse than the windows and orphans you drowned?\n\nYou're the best of the worst around\n\nOh, Ratigan\n\nOh, Ratigan\n\nThe rest fall behind\n\nTo Ratigan\n\nTo Ratigan\n\nThe world's greatest criminal by mind'\n\nI recommend this film 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nPrint this review"
