'Not I!' said the dog. 'Not I!' said the mouse.\" They won't water, cut, or grind the wheat... or help bake a cake with it, either.\n\nSo in the end, the Little Red Hen eats the cake all by herself as well!\n\nPaul Galdone's delightfully detailed ink and wash illustrations--packed with charming details--add plenty of sly humor to the well-loved story that not only offers a sage message but also shows children what it takes to make a cake from the ground up!"
