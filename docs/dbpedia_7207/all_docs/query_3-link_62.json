With a gorgeous cover in keeping with the rest of the Folk Tale Classics series, the story of Jack and his magic bean has never been more irresistible.\n\n\"This spirited and broadly comic version will be a welcome addition to fairy tale collections and to the picture book hour.\" School Library Journal --\n\nPaul Galdone was born in Budapest, Hungary, in 1907 and emigrated to the United States in 1928.
