        "text": "I was hired on “The Great Mouse Detective” in October, 1985, as an Assistant Animator in Clean-up. My job was to help get the film done on time. I worked with Key Assistant, Dave Pacheco, to translate rough animation drawings to a single clean line, and do the in-betweens.\n\nDave allowed me to animate the hair, tails, and drapery on our scenes, which were of Basil and Dawson. I loved doing this overlapping animation, and my good work attracted the attention of the animators whose scenes we were cleaning up.\n\nStone Sculpture\n\nI learned the value of doing the best I can. This directly carries over to my stone sculpture. A great finish on a sculpture allows the artist to justify a higher price. More importantly, flawless work builds a good reputation.\n\nSenior animators emphasized the pursuit of perfection when I animated at Disney Feature Animation, and I embraced the philosophy."
