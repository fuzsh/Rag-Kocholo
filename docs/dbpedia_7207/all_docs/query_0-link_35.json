        "text": "The Great Mouse Detective, a 1986 Disney animation movie. Many reviews give high praise to it, but is it worth your time?\n\nRight under our feet, in a mouse kingdom hidden in London, a toymaker was kidnapped. His little girl being the only eyewitness was taken to the best detective known to all mice, Basil the great mouse detective. It becomes apparent fast that the toymaker was taken by a minion of the land’s greatest criminal, Ratigon. Why would Ratigon need a toymaker? Will Ratigon be stopped? You’ll have to watch to find out.\n\nThe Great Mouse Detective interestingly had 4 directors, John Musker, Burny Mattinson, Ron Clements, and David Michener. Basil’s character is based on Sherlock Holmes and the movie is based on a children’s book series “Basil of Baker Street” by Eve Titus and Paul Galdone.\n\nI would recommend this film to anyone who likes detective movies but wants to watch one with all the family. The normal rating for it is “U” meaning for everyone, but I would personally rate it “PG” since there are a few scenes that wouldn’t be in a “U” today, so there might be better options."
