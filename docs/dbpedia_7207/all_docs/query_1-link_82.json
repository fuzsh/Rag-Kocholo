The opinions expressed therein reflect those of the authors and are not to be viewed as factual documentation\n\nBasil the Great Mouse Detective is a film that is not given as much credit as it should be. Hidden between the failure that was The Black Cauldron and the successes of Who Framed Roger Rabbit and The Little Mermaid, Basil the Great Mouse Detective is a forgotten gem. Its own success at the box office at the time was dwarfed by the major success of Don Bluth’s An American Tail, the highest grossing non-Disney animated feature ever, several months later. Even Disney themselves do not seem to acknowledge the scope of Basil, with Jeffrey Katzenberg saying ‘Everything about The Great Mouse Detective is at a level of 80%. Everything about it is pretty good as opposed to GREAT’. We beg to differ – it is not an 80% film.\n\nVery loosely inspired by Eve Titus and Paul Gadone’s Basil of Baker Street series of books from the 1970s (which in turn were based on Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes books), rodent equivalents of Sherlock Holmes, John Watson and James Moriarty in Victorian England seemed like a perfect fit for Disney. However the idea stayed in development for a long time, due to fears of it being too similar to The Rescuers. But The Rescuers was financially successful and after all, the Walt Disney Company started with a mouse so … what the hell.\n\nMichael Eisner eventually greenlit the project, but the budget was sliced in half and the team were given only a year and a half to complete the film. The film had four directors, Burny Mattinson (who stepped back to produce in the end) and Dave Michener, plus soon to be The Little Mermaid double act John Musker and Ron Clements. It was a tough time of disillusionment for the animators. After the abominable failure that The Black Cauldron was at the box office, new management came down hard. The animation department were moved from the original building on the lot in Burbank where Walt Disney and co. made the classics, to a shabby converted warehouse in a rubbish part of Glendale. They were given this news by memo – the business equivalent of being dumped by text.\n\nThe morale was incredibly low, despite the appearances that management were keeping up for the media.\n\nSmile everyone! We can’t let anyone know how dismal it is right now\n\nBut Basil of Baker Street (the film’s original title) was a project that the animators were excited about and determined to prove their worth to the higher ups, and their audiences. In a storyboard meeting, it was said that Basil of Baker Street was going back to what animation is supposed to be. A great deal was at stake with this film – The Black Cauldron had lost to The Care Bears Movie and there had been huge losses. Animation was in trouble, and management even pointed out that Disney may not even get to release any new animated films and instead just keep re-releasing the classics. Roy Disney, in fear that the company would become a museum, objected fiercely and got management on his side that animation was vital at Disney. This film needed to do well to keep animation at Disney alive. It was Cinderella all over again.\n\nNew management in the 1980s meant an entirely new perspective on the business of filmmaking in animation – a perspective entangled in money, statistics, charts, focus groups and test screenings. Basil of Baker Street, a title that the animators loved, was perceived as ‘too British’ by the marketing team and would ‘alienate’ American audiences.\n\n(Yes God forbid a film inspired by Sherlock Holmes is too British – that’s just madness!)\n\nVice President of Feature Animation, Peter Schneider announced that they had changed the name to The Great Mouse Detective, much to the fury of the team (although as you can see by our title, it is Basil the Great Mouse Detective in the UK and Ireland). Animator, Mike Gabriel said ‘That’s when we knew we were in trouble with the new leadership … Basil is a character you can fall in love with, the great mouse detective’s kind of an arrogant little idea that we didn’t think was going to connect with an audience … the resistance was fierce [but] it wasn’t going to change’. In response to this decision, an inter-office memo was sent out in Schneider’s name, announcing the renaming of films in the canon: Seven Little Men Help a Girl, The Wooden Boy Who Became Real, Robin Hood with Animals, Puppies Taken Away, Two Mice Save a Girl, Two Dogs Fall in Love, A Boy a Bear and a Big Black Cat, The Amazing Flying Children, The Girl With the See-Through Shoes, The Girl Who Seemed to Die, A Fox and a Hound are Friends, The Evil Bonehead, etc…\n\nHilarious. We applaud you!\n\nSchneider was then asked by management to explain himself. He was furious and feeling like the joke memo was undermining his authority, he blew up at the animators, demanding to know who did it. Apparently the animator who wrote the memo was Ed Gombert but none of the team would turn him in. Funnily enough the memo ended up in the L.A. Times …\n\nDespite Schneider’s fury, apparently from then on, the animators had more respect for him, as he acknowledged that he, like them, wanted to make great films at Disney. In turn management had more respect for the animators as this joke memo showed their frustration and passion for what they did. Even Head of Marketing Robert Levin said that they would be much more sensitive to the animators in the future. But The Great Mouse Detective it would be. So how does this film, in spite of this incredibly rocky and turbulent time at Disney, fare? Let’s find out!\n\nBut first, Original Trailer Time!\n\n…\n\nWait there is no Original Trailer Time?\n\nCome ON Disney it’s the 1980s! How could you have lost this? It wasn’t that long ago.\n\nProtagonist\n\nWe’ll get straight to the point: Basil of Baker Street is one of our favourite protagonists so far in The Disney Odyssey. Although apparently at Disney they initially struggled with getting Basil’s character down, with an early approach to the character that was closer to Conan Doyle’s Holmes being rejected for being unlikeable. They then went in the opposite direction, apparently with a ‘Bing Crosby’ approach, that also didn’t work.\n\n(Special Note from Melissa: Bing Crosby couldn’t even channel loveable jerk C.K. Dexter Haven without seeming too vanilla to be true)\n\nTheir final inspiration was Pygmalion’s Henry Higgins, and then they finally found the right balance, especially when they cast Barrie Ingham in the role. Originally actors like John Cleese, Michael Palin and Peter Cook were considered for the role of Basil. Cleese was even offered the role but had to turn it down due to filming schedules for A Fish Called Wanda.\n\nHowever, Barrie Ingham provides a highly entertaining performance, showcasing great versatility to correspond with Basil’s penchant for disguises. Ingham’s voice is eloquent and witty, a natural fit for the sharp-tongued sleuth, and yet there’s a warmth to his vocal performance which ensures that there is no doubt that Basil is an agent for good. Barrie Ingham seemed to just get his character and really loved playing the role: “Playing Basil is just as thrilling to me as playing a lead in The Royal Shakespeare Company. I found Basil to be surprisingly sensitive. He is terribly egocentric but in the end, it is his sensitivity that prevents him from being bombastic and overbearing. He has a lot of frenetic energy which made his character quite a challenge.”\n\nCuriously one of the most appealing aspects of the Sherlock Holmes character is his lack of social skills – he is very eccentric, and consequently can be very blunt, tactless and even rude to others, but it doesn’t come from any feelings of genuine malice, it mainly comes from a lack of perception of human emotions. His mind operates in a very intellectual way, one which transcends social decorum and politeness (which could be seen as inhibitors to the true professional mind). The introduction to his character is one of the most memorable for a protagonist, and one of our favourites. He bursts into the room, accompanied by lightning and an over-the-top disguise.\n\nFollowing that at rapid speed he makes a deduction straight out of A Study in Scarlet, already builds a rapport with Dawson, ignores the child, waves a gun around with great abandon, nearly shoots Dawson in the face, destroys some pillows, is on the verge of a huge discovery, then has a minor nervous breakdown.\n\nA very genuine concern would be that Disney might sanitise such a character, for fear that it would be sending out a bad message to impressionable audiences if their protagonist was perceived as impolite. Again that easily could have been the case when they went down the road of Bing Crosby Basil. Fortunately that isn’t the case, and as a result Basil is one of the strongest protagonists in the canon thus far. Despite being egotistical and incredibly self-involved, the character is full of charm, charisma and British dryness; he manages to remain likeable and engaging throughout.\n\nA complexity to the character is that he is much more self-serving than he is concerned with good winning out over evil. The one moment when Basil feels like giving up occurs, not because of the dire nature of the situation and its consequences, but because Basil was outsmarted by Ratigan. He prises his own ego above the fate of their civilisation.\n\nA great deal of humour emerges from the character’s lack of tact and sensitivity, and rather than sanitising this aspect for the children, Olivia actually becomes the butt of this as part of a ‘rule-of-three’ running gag when he calls her by the wrong name.\n\n(Special Note from David: Ingham’s delivery of the subsequent “Whatever!” is what really makes this joke work, as it could very easily be a lame gag if delivered by a lesser performer)\n\nThe character is rather reminiscent of Robin Hood (another protagonist that we love), a charismatic and energetic character who regularly assumes different identities, and matched with an excellent vocal performance from an established English actor. The difference is that while Robin Hood is sharp and witty, he is also popular and compassionate, while Basil is socially awkward and not altruistic in the slightest. Robin Hood helps the poor, but while Basil does help the public too, he does it primarily to satisfy his intellectual urges. He is only interested in Olivia’s case when he realises that Ratigan is involved. His softer side is revealed now and again (but sparingly and when it matters most), and when the situation gets dire in the climax, he does care about the welfare of others. Essentially his heart is in the right place, without sacrificing the true essence of his character.\n\nHaving an incredibly cerebral character in a lead role is an inspiring move for Disney – a character who succeeds on account of his intellect rather than his physical prowess. It is a point they were trying so hard to prove in The Sword and the Stone, but do a much better job of it here, primarily because Basil is already intelligent. The battle of wits between Basil and Ratigan is one of the main factors that makes this film so enjoyable. When each character is outwitted by the other, they lose it:\n\nWhen outwitted to the highest degree, Basil goes into a fit of depression, while Ratigan’s feral side completely gives out. As we see in the film’s climax, unlike Robert Downey Jr, Basil is no fighter so the stakes feel high when a wilder enraged Ratigan, having given up on their intellectual war, gets embroiled in a physical fight, for which Basil is out of his depth.\n\nLastly like characterisations of Holmes before him, Basil says ‘Elementary my dear Dawson [Watson]’\n\nBut we must point out, literary Holmes himself never actually said that:\n\nAntagonist\n\nAkin to our feelings about Basil, Professor Ratigan, the film’s answer to Professor James Moriarty, is one of our favourite antagonists in the canon so far.\n\nWhile Basil shared certain similarities with Robin Hood, his arch rival also shares traits with Prince John – particularly with regard to the voice actors’ enjoyment playing the part. Much like Peter Ustinov before him, Vincent Price was clearly having so much fun playing the part of Ratigan – Price himself stated that Ratigan was his one of his favourite roles that he ever got to play in his very long career. At Disney, they got the idea to cast Price after seeing him in 1950 film, Champagne for Caesar: Glen Keane recalls, ‘We realised we had found the perfect actor for the role. Price’s expressive voice and attitude inspired us to further redesign the character’. Originally Ratigan had been designed as scrawnier figure, but Price’s voice invoked a larger, more bombastic and theatrical presence. When he was asked to audition, Price said that if anyone but Disney had asked him to audition for a role, he would have been really offended: ‘Disney is really a magical name to me. They had never offered me one of these parts before, so I really wanted to do it because when you’ve been around as long as I have what you look for are new challenges and voicing Ratigan was a real challenge!’\n\nSomething that it very appealing about Ratigan’s character is the fact that he revels in how diabolical he is, taking great delight in his villainy. There are some wonderful nuances to Price’s performance which emphasise this trait: frequently chuckling away to himself, rolling his “r’s” and over emphasising the consonants in words like “wicked”. He is a hilarious antagonist, right up there with Prince John, yet even more diabolical and continuing to raise the bar. The ‘Welcome Basil’ party, the ridiculously elaborate execution he sets up for Basil and Dawson, and his long list of political demands, are only a handful of moments when we’d burst out laughing.\n\n(Special Note from Melissa: I must point out, something I realised from watching the film again is how … bad Ratigan’s scheme is. How did he think everyone would go on thinking the robot was a Queen?:\n\nBut at least he does a crap plan with a flair\n\nIn Robin Hood, the filmmakers were unwilling to make Prince John too threatening, but this is not the case this time around. They are more willing to take the character to darker places by having him play an active role in killing-off some of his own henchmen for insubordination (new territory for Disney villains).\n\nBleak\n\nOne of the first things he does is orders the execution of Bartholomew for referring to him as a rat – even interrupting his villain song to do so. Later on he throws his right-hand man Fidget to his death, in order to lighten the load.\n\n(Special Note from David: Take note Peter Jackson, when the villain’s irritating sidekick gets thrown overboard, let him stay dead – don’t let him survive and receive an inexplicably large amount of screentime, for no ultimate purpose!)\n\nGlen Keane animated Ratigan, and already he is becoming one of our favourite animators. His work on Ratigan was done freelance, and there is such fantastic nuance to how the character has been animated, especially when holding back his rage. Ratigan is constantly forcing himself to suppress his violent and animalistic nature behind the façade of a sophisticated and debonair gentleman-criminal, but throughout the film Keane hints at the monster beneath the surface; many times Ratigan appears to be on the verge of an outburst, before he regains his composure.\n\nBasil and Ratigan are two side of the same coin. Under their well-spoken, straight-laced exteriors, lie manic, erratic personalities that comes out in bursts, and have to be repressed. But while the film’s journey brings out Basil’s compassionate side, it draws out Ratigan’s wild side. Consequently when the finale comes around, and the rage consumes him – it really feels as if it has been properly built up. He had spent the entire film in an intellectual war with Basil, he had almost succeeded in winning it, only to be foiled by his adversary. Villains get foiled at the last minute all the time, but his response to it is frightening, horrific and consequently results in excellent tension and smart psychological perspective on his character. Despite denying that he is a rat throughout, he is so consumed with rage that his inner rat bursts through, reminiscent of Lady and the Tramp’s savage rat.\n\n…\n\nIt is a true Jekyll and Hyde moment, as he races up the clock tower on all fours, his clothes ripped, and abandons the intellectual war to succumb to physical aggression on his physically weaker opponent. But even then, he cannot win. However like a true villain, if he cannot win, he’s taking his opponent down with him – pulling Basil down as he plummets to his death.\n\nKeane would go on to animate many heroes and heroines in future animated films, but here he treats Ratigan like a hero in his own film: ‘At a certain point I became enamoured with heroes and heroines and characters that have a burning desire inside of them to do something, and I love that. Although, I sense that there’s something of the same motivation to – and why I love – Ratigan. I mean the guy truly, deeply believes in himself, and there was this burning desire inside of him to be considered like a mouse, not a rat. He really did want that. At a certain point, though, that shifted to characters that … really pursued their dream and obtained it … But I’ve got to tell you that there is probably no character that I had more fun on than Ratigan’.\n\nSupporting Cast\n\nDr. David Q. Dawson serves as the film’s opening and closing narrator, as the whole story is being recounted by him. Like Watson, he is a surgeon returning from service in Afghanistan, as Basil quickly deduces.\n\nWe know that Dawson’s design is inspired by Nigel Bruce so he is an older looking, more portly man but … just returned from military service? Hmm.\n\nAlongside the lively and eccentric Basil, he is required to be the sensible one in the partnership; although he does embody the slightly bumbling sidekick at times, especially during the scene in the tavern.\n\nOther Watsons are not pleased\n\nIn any adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes formula, the Watson equivalent is typically the emotional anchor in the pair’s dynamic, and Dawson is no exception. Basil has a tendency to demonstrate a lack of tact and sensitivity, but Dawson is there to counteract this, offering a voice of comfort and reassurance. Val Bettin has such a lovely, grandfatherly voice that really suits the character. Perhaps a little too bumbling (but we do have more recent Watsons that counteract this), but when it matters, he’s there to comfort, to advise, and ultimately to knock some sense and hard truths into Basil when he has plummeted into self-doubt and misery. As always, he is the down-to-earth character that serves as a perfect foil to the erratic and flighty Basil.\n\nOlivia was originally intended to be an older character as a potential love interest for Basil or even an infatuated Dawson. However it was decided that she should be a child to better gain audience sympathy.\n\nGood thing that they went off the idea of making Olivia a love interest for Basil. We don’t really perceive Sherlock Holmes as a lady’s man.\n\nFurthermore, it would not have been necessary. The competitive, charged, almost homoerotic relationship between Basil and Ratigan is engaging enough, alongside the sweet double act relationship between Basil and Dawson. A romantic relationship between Basil and alternate Olivia may have been a case of too many cooks.\n\nAnyway back to the real Olivia. Olivia is not as annoying as you would expect, as kids in Disney films can be. She is genuinely a sweet character, voiced by Susanne Pollatschek, a genuine Glaswegian child (no out of place Americanisation or bad accents here!), who was allegedly cast because of the sincerity and naturalism in her performance. The relationship between her and her father, Hiram Flaversham, is very touching.\n\nHe looks like a combination between Gepetto and Rufus\n\nA toymaker and a loving father, he only goes through with Ratigan’s scheme because his daughter’s life is threatened. Fortunately, Olivia, cute as she can be, is taken out of the drama at the right time (after being kidnapped at the toy shop), meaning that we can have more ‘adult’ conversation between Basil and Dawson without having to give the kid something to do.\n\n(Special Note from Both: If only Disney had known when to keep Skippy, an unimportant character, out of the drama!)\n\nDisney succeeded with what they were trying to do; we did feel sympathy for her. Plus, she is proactive, bold and able to stand up for herself, demanding to be heard when talking to a dismissive Basil and having the courage to attack her kidnappers. In a way, it’s astonishing that this character is never pointed out as a strong female character. She does have to be saved, but she is a child after all.\n\nFidget is an incredibly rare type of character in the animated canon: the overly talkative diminutive sidekick to the main villain who isn’t incredibly annoying, despite possessing many of the traits that suggest he would be. The raspy voice of Candy Candido (a regular performer in the studio’s voice actors – his low voice was sped up) coupled with Fidget’s propensity to be overly talkative – even when he’s on his own – should be irritating, but is actually performed in a way that makes it funny. In addition, the character is actually a useful and effective henchman on several occasions – and when he isn’t he pays the price. Even though he remains a loyal henchman to Ratigan, ultimately he is thrown to his death by his own master as a means to lighten the load aboard the airship.\n\n(Special Note from David: You can make arguments that he survived, but I’m going with dead – it’s more effective storytelling that way)\n\nBooks, paper, a teacup and a mace … we feel for you Mrs Judson\n\nMrs Judson, a not too imaginative name-change from Mrs Hudson, serves as a great foil in one scene to Basil’s social ineptitude as she rages at him for destroying her pillows, only for him to close the door on her.\n\nThe Queen (inspired by Queen Victoria) has a few zingers in her style of delivery (including her robotic counterpart), and Ratigan’s henchmen, despite being on the side of the antagonist, do show they are not completely heartless (considering that they are background characters), by standing up for and later grieving for poor old drunken Bartholomew when he meets his gruesome fate.\n\n(Fun fact: Bartholomew was also voiced by Barrie Ingham – There’s a subtle element of wish fulfilment for Ratigan here in ordering his death!)\n\nAlso, hello Bill. Long time no see.\n\nLike Marty McFly, he travelled from the 1950s to the 1980s\n\nA lot has changed since you left Bill. The Nine Old Men have retired and … Walt has been dead for twenty years.\n\nI should have stayed in the 1950s\n\nArtwork and Imagery\n\nThe artwork in the film shows the effects of the film’s reduced budget, and certain backgrounds and crowd shots give a clear indication of where the animators had to cut corners. It is not a beautiful looking film, nor is it an ugly film, but rather simple in its overall appearance. We discovered that at Disney they considered making a film about a dog detective instead of a mouse detective … well considering how they animated Toby, we are glad that didn’t happen.\n\nSheesh you look awful\n\nAlso … does anyone at Disney know what a crumpet is?!!\n\nThat’s not a crumpet!\n\nDisney this is a crumpet:\n\nYou weren’t even close!\n\nRegardless of this there are still some very impressive visual set-pieces and sequences; the folk at Disney were clearly still enamoured with London’s iconography, as Big Ben makes its third appearance in one of their animated features. Here are some particularly striking shots from the film:\n\nThere are also quite a few nightmare-inducing images reminiscent of Pinocchio:\n\nThis time around the famous clock tower plays a more active role in the story as it provides the setting for the climactic showdown. In addition, this same sequence sees one of the studio’s first major steps towards use of computer animation (something they had used incrementally in the past) to create the rotating cogs and gears that make up the clock mechanism. The animated characters are placed inside a CGI background, and thus there are more opportunities for sweeping and follow shots that are closer to what you would see in a live-action film. The effect looks impressive and holds up very well nearly thirty years later.\n\nWhere the artists really excel though is with the character animation, especially the characterisation of Basil and Ratigan. For us, it is some of the best character animation since The Jungle Book. Both characters have very clearly defined personalities and there are so many great nuances to the ways in which they move, as well as their facial expressions. Despite their voice actors being so good that they could easily have recorded a radio play, on the other side, you could easily watch these characters with the sound turned off – the artwork is that communicative and impactful. Basil’s eccentricity and liveliness is showcased a great deal, and leads to many genuinely funny moments.\n\n(Special Note from David: A moment that made me laugh out loud was when Basil sank dejectedly down into his armchair, and then slowly his trembling hand reaches out for his violin)\n\nRatigan also has plenty of memorable moments, getting his first major showcase during “The World’s Greatest Criminal Mind” where we see his refined artistic nature (playing the harp, admiring his reflection and twirling around like a ballet dancer) as well as hints of the dangerous animal under the surface. He is like a bomb wrapped in pretty packaging ready to explode at any time.\n\nMusic\n\nLuckily Disney chose not to go down The Black Cauldron route and we have returned to songs!\n\nIt is not a full on musical. There are three songs, one of which is a ‘break-into song’ type, while the others are both performances. But it’s a start!\n\nHowever we will start off first with Henry Mancini’s score. The score definitely suits the tone of the film – it feels very English, Holmes-like and captures the sense of the period. It feels like the score of a classic detective film, adventure flick or a thriller. It is very brass-heavy, meaning that when other instruments like strings or woodwind or percussion become centre-stage, the emotional and/or intense significance is really felt. The characters’ themes are very distinctive and skilfully reflect who they are to the audience. It is Mancini’s only score for a Disney animated film, and he did a great job! The music in the climax is particularly fantastic – really exciting during the flight chase and super intense and sinister in the clock tower scene. The only issue we had with the score was the jarring moment when immediately following the film’s very harrowing opening scene, it is bluntly interrupted by Basil’s jaunty theme.\n\nWell Basil never was one for indulging in sentiment was he?\n\n“The World’s Greatest Criminal Mind” is a highly entertaining song, emphatically introducing the film’s larger-than-life villain. Ratigan is not only someone who takes great delight in being the villain, he also prides himself on his superior intellect – and this song is constructed to appease the ego of such a character. Lyrically the song repeatedly lauds the brilliance of its subject, alternating between Ratigan proclaiming his own brilliance, and his own henchmen reinforcing that fact. The song is broken into different sections, after the initial verse and chorus there is a harp solo (somewhat akin to Duchess’ solo in The Aristocats – perhaps conscious or not it is a pastiche!) to show off Ratigan’s ‘sophisticated-gentleman-criminal’ persona, the main tune then continues but is abruptly halted when one of the henchmen touches a nerve by calling Ratigan a rat. The song is put on hold for a minute as the offending henchman is executed (by being fed to Felicia), then Ratigan threatens the rest of his henchmen with the same fate if they don’t resume the song as though nothing happened, and there is a big Busby Berkeley-style finish.\n\nThe song is also a milestone as it is Disney’s first major villain song that is sung by the villain about the villain. Yes there have been songs about villains: Headless Horseman, Cruella DeVil, The Elegant Captain Hook, etc. but The World’s Greatest Criminal Mind has taken us in such a new direction for villains, turning the villain song into a great, bombastic showcase number. It has been fascinating that before doing The Disney Odyssey, we had no idea that the style of villain songs that we grew up with really was relatively new for Disney – it is certainly a trend-setter. The song introduces the antagonist, provides exposition and character development, showcases the different facets of his personality as well as his nefarious nature (not many villains interrupt their own song to kill off one of their henchmen), and even serves to further the plot.\n\nFor Sherlock fans, someone made a hilarious video using “The World’s Greatest Criminal Mind”:\n\n“Let Me Be Good To You” is an odd number (although not as odd as its backstory but we’ll get to that), it is the only part of the film that feels glaringly out of place.\n\n…\n\nFor the most part Basil the Great Mouse Detective does a good job of maintaining consistency with its time setting, but the song itself sounds too much like it’s from the 1980s, which is mainly because of the style of Melissa Manchester’s singing. It is strange that the song is sung by a character who has no bearing on the plot whatsoever and that we never see again. We do enjoy the scene – an entertaining sequence is taking place, but had the song been better, we may have not have minded her being a one scene character. Originally Henry Mancini wrote more of a Victorian oom-pah-pah music-hall style of song that would have fit the period called ‘Are You the One Who Loves Me’. It was even recorded by Shani Wallis (Nancy from Oliver!) with rough animation – a very authentic touch! Katzenberg however disliked the song because he felt like the 1980s kiddies wouldn’t think it was hip and contemporary enough.\n\nWe see where you’re going Katzenberg and we don’t like it\n\nDespite Mancini writing another song, they were still not satisfied. Eisner suggested that Michael Jackson do a song in the bar scene.\n\nWe can’t even – what? The suggestion was received with complete silence, and we imagine it was never spoken of again. He also suggested Madonna … alright less bizarre but still, WHAT IS GOING ON? An 1890s English setting and an adaptation inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle, and what Eisner sees as making it perfect are American 1980s pop icons… God we need to lie down.\n\nFinally they brought in Melissa Manchester to write and sing the song, partly because she had won lots of awards … real subtle Disney. All the rough animation had to be retimed to fit the new song, hence why the dubbing looks really weird in that scene. However despite our feelings that the song could have fit the period much more, the lyrics are very provocative for a Disney film. The song was nearly cut because it was considered too risqué, but in a nutshell it was kept in on the grounds that mice aren’t sexy. Logic.\n\nWell … at least we get this strange gem of a moment:\n\n“Goodbye, So Soon” could easily be dismissed as a throwaway comic song, were it not for the fact that it is genuinely really funny (attribute this to Vincent Price’s performance). By this point Ratigan’s ego has already been established, and here we get the coup de grace with this repetitive number that smugly repeats exclamations of farewell. Having proved himself the superior mind, Ratigan leaves Basil and Dawson with the song playing on a gramophone – intended to set off the trap that will kill them as soon as the song comes to an end. Delightfully wicked and smug (with some enjoyable silliness thrown in).\n\nAnd of course the chipper Disney chorus have to chime in with a reprise of “Goodbye, So Soon” over the end credits, like they’re doing a number from A Chorus Line.\n\n(Special Note from Both: We thought we’d heard the last of the Disney chorus, apparently not it would seem!)\n\nStory\n\nThe story for the film is another standout element, well-paced and rarely staying in one place for too long. The plot isn’t built around a big mystery, so much as a villainous scheme, but the details of the plan are revealed gradually throughout the film, so it is presented in a similar style to that of a mystery. A child’s father is kidnapped (in a rather harrowing opening scene), which is what brings Olivia and Dawson to Basil, but it ultimately leads to getting on the tail of a much greater and more dangerous case. The real centre of this story is Basil and Ratigan trying to outdo and outwit the other, climaxing at the battle on top of Big Ben, reminiscent of Holmes and Moriarty falling from the waterfall. If you’re going to do one Disney animated adaptation of Sherlock Holmes, go for the big guns – Holmes and Moriarty make for an exciting story, and consequently so do Basil and Ratigan\n\nStructurally it is very similar to that of The Rescuers, starting with a ‘cold-open’ to set up the villain’s plot – and then getting straight into the story, and following it right through until the end without any major deviations. Songs – or rather song-sequences – are used to develop the plot (“Let Me Be Good To You” isn’t plot-related at all, but plot-centric events continue to occur during that sequence).\n\nAnother similarity to The Rescuers is that the main characters inhabit a society that functions below the human one, but this time around the distinctions between these separate worlds are much clearer. In The Rescuers Bernard and Bianca were able to communicate with Penny despite being different species and from different worlds, this time around though the only characters who cross-over from one ‘world’ to another – Toby and Felicia – don’t interact verbally with any of the characters therein. The separate world’s trope also allows for a fun little homage to Sherlock Holmes, as the famous detective appears a couple of times (in silhouette form only) voiced by Basil Rathbone, living upstairs above Basil.\n\nThe filmmakers have learned from previous experiences, and fine-tuned a lot of the storytelling techniques. The story certainly showcases a love for the source material (or in this case the source material for the source material) as well as the setting; the film isn’t afraid to go to darker territory when it needs to, which legitimises the sense of threat posed by the villain, but there is also a lot of humour as well (something that The Rescuers was very light on). The humour and tension bounce off each other fantastically, aided by the tight narrative, witty script, excellent storyboarding and inventive sequences – humour and tension are never used at the expense of the other.\n\nDavid’s Verdict\n\nThe Disney Odyssey has taught me to acknowledge and appreciate a film as a whole, taking all of the different components (characters, voice-acting, music, artwork, story etc.) into consideration when forming my opinion. With this enhanced approach I was apprehensive that I wouldn’t enjoy the film as much as I had done during previous viewings. However, if anything, it only made me appreciate the film even more – and having viewed all of the films that preceded it, I could see the progress made by the studio also.\n\nIn Basil the Great Mouse Detective I recognised elements that I had praised from other films: the well-paced and continuous story-structure of The Rescuers, the highly entertaining hero and villain from Robin Hood, and the delightful character animation of The Jungle Book. All of those elements are present here, and it makes for an effortlessly entertaining film. The film manages to be intelligent and yet remains accessible at all times, never talking down to the audience. There are some wonderful performances, particularly from Barrie Ingham and Vincent Price – and interviews show that it meant a great deal to them to be involved in a Disney film.\n\nThe film made some very bold moves, particularly where the villains are concerned: despite being a comical villain at times, Ratigan progressively becomes more threatening. Also Ratigan, Fidget and Felicia all appear to meet their demises during the finale.\n\nDue to the reduced budget, the artwork in the film does look quite cheap at times, but generally the film still looks really good – clearly this film was a passion project for the artists who worked on it, and they show their worth despite the financial cuts. The film manages to avoid making characters like Olivia and Fidget really annoying (no mean feat for a Disney film – it’s not something they get right very often) and even though the songs aren’t the most memorable in the canon, they are still enjoyable.\n\nAside from these nitpicks there really isn’t much about the film that I can criticise, because I really like it. I feel that it’s a film that gets overlooked quite often, and some critics stated that they wouldn’t consider it amongst Disney’s best. I, however, really rate this film very highly and would rank it amongst my absolute favourites from the animated canon – this is a film I will watch again and again.\n\nMelissa’s Verdict\n\nI did not own Basil the Great Mouse Detective on VHS as a child but I remember we frequently borrowed it from the video shop – in fact, there is home video footage of me watching it when I was four. It’s the big chase scene and I look incredibly nonchalant while eating a packet of crisps. I liked it when I was little but when I returned to Basil as a teenager, I loved it, and the more I continue to watch it over the years, the more I enjoy it. While at university, in company of fellow English and Drama students, I came to realise that literary and theatrical types adore this film, primarily because it is a very clever adaptation produced with such a dramatic and nuanced flair. Basil the Great Mouse Detective is an incredibly enjoyable film, featuring one of the sharpest, wittiest and most intelligent scripts in the canon. Disney animated films have played around with adaptations of (originally) British material many times, but this film really captures Englishness the best so far. The character animation is some of the greatest that I’ve seen since The Jungle Book and the dynamic between the hero and the villain is, for me, my favourite protagonist-antagonist relationship so far in The Disney Odyssey. I haven’t laughed this much watching a Disney film since watching Robin Hood. The Big Ben clock tower climax still gives me goosebumps – it is so intense, well-executed in terms of animation and score, and it is a fantastic stand-off between Basil and Ratigan.\n\nAny issues that I have with the film are relatively minor. I can see where cut-backs have been made, particularly in terms of still backgrounds and some cheaper looking animation (but it is nowhere near Robin Hood levels of cheap). Let Me be Good to You is a jarring song in what is generally a very authentic-looking nineteenth-century setting. I do wish they had held a bit longer on Basil’s possible death, but as always, there’s the fear of upsetting les enfants. In a way because the film is so good and has such a fantastic pace, it is a shame that the film isn’t longer. At the end when we hear Basil and Dawson on another case, I want to see more of these characters! Again mere minor details (also learn what a crumpet looks like!), but despite that, it is a very impressive film that does not patronise its audience, but instead entertains with brilliant character animation, a sharp and witty script, a tight narrative structure, excellent storyboarding and a wonderful balance between humour, emotion and tension. An underrated film, it is a greater gem than Disney ever gives it credit for. The new generation of animators should be very proud. Once more unto the breach! The game’s afoot for Disney Animation!\n\nLegacy\n\nBasil the Great Mouse Detective made a profit, was a moderate financial success of over $25 million at the domestic box office and was well-received by critics.\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and praised it, pointing out that Disney had been ‘cutting corners’ in recent decades but computers are here to save the day, somewhat foreshadowing the future for animation: ‘A movie like The Great Mouse Detective … looks more fully animated than anything in some 30 years … For a long time, I was down on the full-length animated efforts of Disney and others, because they didn’t seem to reflect the same sense of magic and wonderment that the original animated classics always had … But now, maybe thanks to computers, animated movies are beginning to sparkle again’.\n\nNina Darton from the New York Times seemed to love the film: ‘Many of the new crop of children’s animated movies are so saturated with powdered sugar that one suspects just watching them will produce cavities. What a treat it is to see an animated feature that doesn’t moralize or patronize young children, or drown them in bathos. With The Great Mouse Detective … the Disney people have gone back to the basics that have delighted children and their parents for half a century … The heroes are appealing, the villains have that special Disney flair – humorous blackguards who really enjoy being evil -and the script is witty and not overly sentimental. Basil is a delightfully cool character. He doesn’t even especially like children’.\n\nThe film was nominated for an Edgar Allen Poe Award for Best Motion Picture, and Susanne Pollatschek was nominated for a Young Artist Award. It won the Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing at the Motion Picture Sound Editors Awards.\n\nThe Care Bears Movie II was released the same year but unlike 1985 with The Black Cauldron, Basil was not defeated by the cuddly little bears.\n\nCare bear-staring will not bring you financial success\n\nKnowing they must never be defeated by greeting cards bears, Katzenberg hatched a scheme:\n\nAnd voila! The film didn’t even make half what Basil made. Disney could breathe easy. However …\n\nMeanwhile at another studio: Don Bluth formed a rather dynamic partnership in 1984 … with Steven Spielberg. But not only did Bluth have Spielberg, he also had Universal and the Sears marketing department behind his film, An American Tail – coincidentally a film also about rodents.\n\nSoon this will become much more common with animation studios …\n\nThe film had ‘American’ in the title, and it was about a significant part in US history – immigration. Put that against a film set in Victorian England in which they were concerned that the original title was too British, and inevitably there will be trouble. An American Tail became the highest grossing non-Disney animated film to that date, making over $47 million at the domestic box office. It is incredibly fortunate that these two films were not released at the exact same time (it came out four months after Basil) – if that had happened, perhaps there would have been no Disney Renaissance. However, while An American Tail was commercially successful, the critics were not quite so keen, with Roger Ebert giving it two stars out of four, and Vincent Canby from The New York Times giving it two out of five stars. Basil was critically more successful than An American Tail, but was still nevertheless overshadowed. Personally we both think that Basil is a much better film than An American Tail. The underscore for the latter is excellent and there are some very touching emotional moments (especially the ending), but the film is completely all over the place: the narrative structure is very choppy, the animation is uneven, the songs vary in quality, it is tonally very depressing, and most of the characters are either irritating or forgettable.\n\n(Special Note from Melissa: Agh people will hate me for this but personally I prefer the sequel …)\n\nIt was another wake up call for Disney, as Glen Keane recalls. He said that he was shocked, as he didn’t even like An American Tail and yet it did so amazingly well – he remembers Katzenberg saying, ‘We are going to get back that mantle’. However despite An American Tail’s huge success, the success of Basil (especially in relation to the bleak failure of 1985), gave new management, Katzenberg, Wells, and Eisner, confidence in the abilities of the animation department. Without Basil’s success, there would be no The Little Mermaid. It is a huge milestone in Disney’s history, bigger than it is ever given credit for. But then again, isn’t that very typical of Holmes?\n\nUnderstatement and humility. We don’t need any credit.\n\nThe film was re-released at the cinema in 1992 and also on VHS that same year. Disney must have been shaken by the calamity that came with the film’s title that they changed the name of the film … again. This time to The Adventures of the Great Mouse Detective. That’s … no better. First of all, they’re not adventures! Sigh. Why not just call it Basil of Baker Street and get it over with? It has been released on DVD, but of course, does not receive the special treatment that certain Disney films get. Shame. It’d be great to hear a commentary!\n\nLastly, Basil the Great Mouse Detective is truly up there with the great adaptations of Sherlock Holmes. It even left its own legacy in future adaptations. With the huge popularity of Sherlock Holmes adaptations these days and the greater warmth from the US market towards British films and actors, it makes us wonder whether Basil the Great Mouse Detective would be more popular if released now …"
