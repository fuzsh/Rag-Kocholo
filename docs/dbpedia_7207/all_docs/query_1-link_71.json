        "text": "Spoilers\n\nThe Great Mouse Detective also known as “The Adventures of the Great Mouse Detective” and “Basil the Great Mouse Detective” (just pick a fucking name) is a movie based on the book series “Basil of Baker Street”, a series about the mouse equivalent of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. Is it any good though? Well you’ll just have to wait and see.\n\nWe open with a toy maker called Mr. Flaversham celebrating his daughter Olivia’s birthday. Suddenly a bat bursts through the window and kidnaps Mr. Flaversham. This scene is great, it sets up so many questions which are pretty essential for a Sherlock Holmes story. Who is this bat? Why does he want to steal a toymaker?\n\nOlivia decides that she needs to rescue her father so goes to seek the famous mouse detective, Basil. On her way there she encounters Dr. Dawson, who agrees to take her to see Basil. When they arrive at Basil’s place Basil isn’t interested in helping the girl until she mentions the bat who Basil knows works for his archnemesis Professor Ratigan.\n\nYou already know the deal of the characters Basil and Dr. Dawson, they’re the mouse equivalent of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. Basil is pure intelligence, not really knowing how to deal with emotions but deep down being a good person. He’s eccentric but brilliant. Dr. Dawson is the heart of the pair, he’s not as smart as Basil but is essential for their dynamic as he’s the people person of the duo or I guess the mice mouse of the duo. He’s the character us simple minded losers are meant to relate to. Basil is a great iteration of Sherlock but Dawson is a bit underwhelming. The only time he helps Basil is when he accidently says something that triggers something in Basil making him destroy some traps. Basil ending up recruiting him as a companion seems more like a desire for a friend than a partner, which is fine, the problem is I never really brought their friendship either. Dr. Dawson seems to only be here because he has to be. They don’t really know what to do with him most of the time.\n\nWe rejoin the bat who it turns out is called Fidget. He has stolen Mr. Flaversham so he can build a clockwork robot of the Queen for his master Ratigan. Ratigan and his men discuss their plan to replace the Queen of Mice with a clockwork version of her. This clockwork version of the Queen will then give Ratigan all the power in England. They all sing the song “The World’s Greatest Criminal Mind” which is great, one of the best Disney villain songs, it’s all his men detailing his crimes including the line “Worse than the widows and orphans you drowned?” wow that’s dark for Disney. At the end of the song one of Ratigans mice call him a rat by mistake which is a huge insult to Ratigan. Ratigan prefers to be called a mouse even though he isn’t, I’d argue maybe he should change his name then. So, guess what Ratigan does? He feeds the mouse that insulted him to a cat. This is great, Disney does this a lot, they’ll make the villain casually kill their own men just so when they die later, we don’t feel bad. This is one of the best versions of this trope. A rat owning a cat so he can control his mice henchman is perfect, if any of them speak up he’ll get his cat to eat them.\n\nBasil meets up with the actual Sherlock Holmes dog Toby to help track down Fidget’s scent. Yeah Sherlock Holmes and John Watson also exist in this world and live above Basil which sets up so many questions. Does everyone have a mouse equivalent in this universe? They find Fidget in a toy store as Fidgets gathering materials for the clockwork Queen. Olivia who came with them for some reason ends up getting kidnapped by Fidget. Basil finds a checklist that Fidget left behind and analyses it determining a tavern which Basil drinks at. The duo decides to go to this tavern to find Fidget. In this tavern we encounter some sexualised mice who sing the song “Let Me Be Good to You” which is just weird. These mice sing lyrics like “I’ll take off all my blues”, they’re wearing blue clothing. “There’s nothing I won’t do”, yikes. And “Boys, what you’re hopin’ for will come true”. It’s all a bit weird but I guess it fits the scene of a rundown mice tavern. Basil and Dawson almost get drugged once they ask if the waitress knows where Ratigan is. Well Dawson does get drugged but quickly gets over it so what was the point. Basil notices Fidget and follows him to Ratigan’s hideout.\n\nTurns out it was all a trap and Basil and Dawson end up being captured. I love this scene, Ratigan can’t decide what method to kill Basil with so ends up using all of them. Basil and Dawson and tied down and after a song Ratigan made ends, a ton of traps will activate, obliterating Basil and Dawson. The song is “Goodbye so Soon” and is great, it’s Ratigan reminiscing about his and Basil’s battles in the past and how it’s kind of sad that it all has to end, it really establishes their rivalry. Dawson says something that triggers something in Basil allowing him to deactivate all the traps. The pair rescue Olivia and go on there way to stop Ratigan’s plans.\n\nRatigan replaces the Queen with his clockwork version. The clockwork Queen starts to announce that she gives Ratigan a ton of power before Basil destroys the clockwork version and rescues the real Queen and Mr. Flaversham. Ratigan kidnaps Olivia and flies off with her on his flying machine. Basil crafts his own flying machine and gives chase. They rescue Olivia but Basil and Ratigan end up on top of Big Ben. They fight in and on the clock in an amazing scene which incorporated both computer animation and hand drawn animation and actually still looks good, most early computer animation looks like trash but since they keep things simple here it still looks good and gives an epic feeling to the scene. Two hand-drawn characters fighting on some vast computer animated cogs in a clock. It’s grand and a marvel to look at. They both end up falling off Big Ben but Basil saves himself with the motor from Ratigan’s flying machine. Everyone is saved and Basil and Dr. Dawson agree to become a team to solve mysteries together.\n\nThis movie is an underrated gem, nothing amazing but good enough that some people should be talking about it. The thing is at points it barely feels like a detective story. The questions the opening set up are answered five minutes later and no more questions are ever set up. It’s a mouse version of Sherlock Holmes I don’t expect a complex mystery with numerous twists and turns, all I expect is a mystery.\n\nSo that’s The Great Mouse Detective, tomorrow I’ll review the final movie of the bronze age, Oliver & Company. Then onto some movie’s you guys have likely seen. We’re almost at the Disney renaissance don’t worry.\n\n7 / 10"
