        "text": "The Great Mouse Detective is a 1986 Disney animated feature film set in a world of talking mice, in which famed detective Basil of Baker Street sets out to find a little girl's father, and in the process stop crime lord Professor Ratigan from enacting his evil plan to take over Mousedom.\n\nDirected by John Musker, Ron Clements, Dave Michener, and Burny Mattinson. Written by John Musker, Ron Clements, Burny Mattinson, Matthew O'Callaghan, and Melvin Shaw.\n\nCan he bring the dirty rat to justice?\n\nBasil of Baker Street\n\n[edit]\n\n[of Professor Ratigan] He's a genius, Dawson! A genius twisted for evil! The Napoleon of Crime!\n\nNot a corner of London is safe while Ratigan is at large. There's no evil scheme he wouldn't concoct, no depravity he wouldn't commit! Who knows what dastardly scheme that that villain may be plotting even as we speak?\n\nRemember, Dawson, we're low-life ruffians.\n\nThere's always a chance, Doctor, as long as one can think.\n\n[in an almost friendly tone] Ratigan, no one can have a higher opinion of you than I have. [furiously] And I think that you're a slimy, contemptible sewer rat!\n\nProfessor Ratigan\n\n[edit]\n\nPoor Basil. Oh, he is in for a surprise!\n\nMy friends! We are about to embark on the most odious, the most evil, the most diabolical scheme of my illustrious career! A crime to top all crimes, a crime that will live in infamy! [The henchmen cheered. Ratigan holds up a newspaper featuring the Queen's picture on the front page.] Tomorrow evening, our beloved monarch celebrates her Diamond Jubilee. And...with the enthusiastic help of our good friend, Mr. Flaversham... [The henchmen chuckle] it promises to be a night she will never forget! [burns her picture with his cigarette. The henchmen gasp in terror] Her last night...and my first, as supreme ruler of all mousedom! [The henchmen cheer.]\n\n[Rubbing his head, irritated] How dare that idiot Basil poke his stupid nose into my wonderful scheme and foul up everything!\n\nBravo, Basil! A marvelous performance. Though frankly, I expected you 15 minutes earlier. Trouble with the chemistry set, old boy?\n\nYou don't know what a delightful dilemma it was, trying to decide on the most appropriate method for your demise. Oh, I had so many ingenious ideas I didn't know which to choose. So I decided to use them all. [the camera zooms out to show many various weapons aimed at the mousetrap] Marvelous, isn't it? Oh, ho, but, here, let me show you how it works. Picture this, first, a sprightly tune I've recorded especially for you. As the song plays, the cord tightens, and when the song ends, the metal ball is released, rolling along its merry way until... [gestures to mousetrap] Snap! [gestures to gun] Boom! [gestures to crossbow] Twang! [gestures to axe] Thunk! [gestures to anvil] SPLAT! And so ends the short, undistinguished career of Basil of Baker Street.\n\nNow, you will remember to smile for the camera, won't you?\n\nFidget, you delightful little maniac!\n\nThere's no escape this time, Basil!\n\nStay where you are. Or the girl dies!\n\nOh, I love it when I'm nasty.\n\n[looks above the doorway to another barrel, where Fidget, the bat, is hanging from the faucet, sleeping] Fidget? [Fidget doesn't wake up, so Ratigan screams in his ear.] Fidget! [Startled, Fidget falls from his perch and rolls down the stairs at Rattigan's feet.] Bright and alert as always. [hands Fidget a list] Here's the list. You know what to do, and no mistakes!\n\nThe Mouse Queen\n\n[edit]\n\n[reading Professor Ratigan's letter] \"To our beloved Queen, this gift we send, as her sixty-year reign.... comes to an end?\"\n\nAh, I just adore Jubilees.\n\nOlivia Flaversham\n\n[edit]\n\n[to Fidget] Stop! Let me go! You ugly old thing! Help, let me out! Let me out!\n\n[after the fight's over with Fidget, door closes, and the cupboard door, Olivia was put in, creaks open with big mess.] Dad, where are you?! [goes to a window] Father... where are you?!! Papa! [echoing noise] DADDY!\n\n[to Ratigan] Just wait! Basil's smarter than you! He's going to put you in jail. [tugs on his tail to accent her next few insults.] He's not afraid of a big, old, ugly, rat like youǃ\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nDr. David Q. Dawson: Toby's?\n\nBasil of Baker Street: Oh, you must meet him, he's just the chap for this.\n\nDr. David Q. Dawson: You- You want me to come?\n\nBasil of Baker Street: Hah! I should think a stout-hearted army mouse like you would surely leap at the chance for adventure!\n\nDr. David Q. Dawson: [chuckles] Well, I am rather curious.\n\nOlivia Flaversham: Wait for me! I'm coming, too! [her hat and scarf knocks over Basil's violin in the process. He dives down to catch it]\n\nBasil of Baker Street: What?! Certainly not! [sets the violin back on the chair] This is no business for children.\n\nOlivia Flaversham: Are we going to take a cab?\n\nBasil of Baker Street: [puts his hand on his forehead with a sigh as Olivia puts several crumpets into her pocket] My dear, I don't think you understand. It will be quite dangerous. [sits on his violin, snapping it in two] Why you-! Look what- [restrains himself] Young lady, you are most definitely NOT accompanying us! AND THAT IS FINALǃ!! [Later, as they sneak out into Sherlock Holmes' house, with Olivia right beside them] And not a word out of you. Is that clear?\n\n[Hiram is programming the robot; Professor Ratigan arrives from the shadows]\n\nProfessor Ratigan: [chuckles evilly] Quite an ingenious scheme, eh, Flaversham? And aren't you proud to be a part of it?\n\nHiram Flaversham: This whole thing, i-i-i-it's monstrous!\n\nProfessor Ratigan: We will have our little device ready by tomorrow evening, won't we? [holds up his bell] You know what happens if you... fail.\n\nHiram Flaversham: [angry] I don't care!\n\n[Hiram pulls the levers of the robot, causing it go haywire until it falls apart and spatters a drop of oil onto Professor Ratigan's jacket, which he wipes off with a handkerchief.]\n\nHiram Flaversham: You can do what you want with me. I won't be a part of this-this... this evil any longer!\n\n[Pause]\n\nProfessor Ratigan: Oh, very well. If that is your decision. [noticed the wind-up doll Hiram Flaversham made for Olivia] Oh, by the way, I'm taking the liberty of having your daughter brought here. [he winds up the doll to let it dance]\n\nHiram: [gasps] Olivia?\n\nProfessor Ratigan: Yes. [he lets go of the wind-up doll to let it dance] Yes. I would spend many a sleepless night if anything unfortunate were to befall her.\n\nHiram Flaversham: [understands what Professor Ratigan is saying] Y-You wouldn't!\n\n[Professor Ratigan picks up the wind-up doll and squeezes it so hard, its head pops off.]\n\nProfessor Ratigan: [after a tense silence, then screams bloody murder] FINISH IT, FLAVERSHAM!\n\nThe Henchmen: [singing] Oh, Ratigan! Oh, Ratigan! You're tops, and that's that! To Ratigan! To Ratigan!\n\nBartholomew: [drunkly singing] To Ratigan, the world's greatest rat! [hiccups]\n\n[Professor Ratigan spits out a mouthful of wine in shock, gasping. The henchmen turn around, gasping in terror.]\n\nProfessor Ratigan: WHAT WAS [turns to Bartholomew] THAT?!!!!! What did you call me?!!!!\n\nThe Henchman #1: Oh, he didn't mean it, Professor!\n\nBill the Lizard: It was just a slip of the tongue!\n\nProfessor Ratigan: [seizing Bartholomew] I AM NOT A RAT!\n\nThe Henchman #2: 'Course you're not. You're a mouse!\n\nThe Henchman #1: Yeah, that's right. A mouse!\n\nBill the Lizard: Yeah, a big mouse!\n\nProfessor Ratigan: SILENCE!\n\n[Professor Ratigan throws Bartholomew out of the hideout.]\n\nProfessor Ratigan: Oh, my dear Bartholomew. I'm afraid you've gone and upset me. [Pulls a small bell out of his pocket] You know what happens when someone upsets me...\n\n[The henchmen watch from the door, frightened as Professor Ratigan rings the bell. They then look up and gasp in terror. Felicia, Professor Ratigan's pet cat, hears the ringing of the bell and slowly walks up to Bartholomew]\n\nBartholomew: [drunkly singing] Oh, Ratigan. Oh, Ratigan. You're the tops, and that's that. [hiccups] Whoops, dear. To Ratigan. To Ratigan. To Ratigan, the world's greatest-\n\n[The henchmen tremble and gasp in fear as they see Bartholomew being eaten, while Professor Ratigan nonchalantly smokes and watches. A gulp is heard. The henchmen quietly mourn their lost friend with two removing their hats and placing them over their hearts and one shedding a tear]\n\nProfessor Ratigan: [hugging Felicia] Oh, Felicia, my precious, my baby. [Fatherly] Did Daddy's little honey-bun enjoy her tasty treat?\n\n[Felicia burps. Professor Ratigan's smile slowly collapses into a look of slight dismay. He soon regains his smile and turns back to his henchmen]\n\nProfessor Ratigan: I trust that there will be no further interruptions.\n\nBasil of Baker Street: [after Toby has picked up Fidget's scent] Miss Flamchester!\n\nOlivia Flaversham and Dr. David Q. Dawson: Flaversham!\n\nBasil of Baker Street: Whatever. [hooks up Toby's leash] Your father is as good as found.\n\nDr. Dawson: Olivia! Olivia! where is she?\n\nBasil of Baker Street: She's gone, Dawson! Confound it! Told you to watch over the girl! Now she's been spirited away by that maniacal little monster! Soon to be in the clutch of the most depraved mind in all of London! I should've known better than to… than to… Dawson? I say! Dawson old chap!\n\nDr. Dawson: Poor girl. I'm so sorry.\n\nBasil of Baker Street: Don't worry, old fellow. We'll get her back.\n\nDr. Dawson: Do you think there's a chance?\n\nBasil of Baker Street: There's always a chance, Doctor! As long as one can think.\n\nDr. Dawson: [finds Fidget's checklist; reads:] \"Get the following: Tools, Gears, Girl, Uniforms\"…\n\nBasil of Baker Street: Dawson, you've done it! This list is precisely what we need! Quickly! Back to Baker Street!\n\nProfessor Ratigan: Ah, the uniforms! Oh, Fidget, I knew I could rely on you. Now, you didn't forget anything?\n\nFidget: No problem. I took care of everything. Everything on the list. [tries to display the list, but finds it's not there] Uh oh.\n\nProfessor Ratigan: What's wrong?\n\nFidget: [searching himself, to no avail] The list, but I knew I had it!\n\nProfessor Ratigan: Where's the list?\n\nFidget: Well, you see, it was.... It was like this; [reenacting] I was in the toy store, getting the uniforms, when I heard a 'Aroo! Aroo!'\n\nProfessor Ratigan: [irritated] You're not coming through.\n\nFidget: [reenacting still] A dog came. I ran! I had a baby bonnet, girl in bag, and Basil… he chase me!\n\nProfessor Ratigan: [shocked] What?! (You know what, Fidget) BASIL ON THE CASE?! [furious] WHY, YOU GIBBERING LITTLE--!!! [groans as he holds his anger in, then calms down and picks Fidget up] Oh, my dear Fidget. You have been hanging upside down too long.\n\nFidget: You mean, you're not mad? I'm glad you're taking it so well. [Professor Ratigan takes Fidget behind a wall. A bell is heard ringing and screaming soon follows. Cut to Felicia holding a struggling Fidget in her paw, about to eat him] Not me, you idiot! No, stop, you stupid furball! [He breaks free, but Felicia catches him and stuffs him into her mouth] Open up! Open up! Oh! Ay! Ah! Ooh! You're hurting my wing!\n\nProfessor Ratigan: [ranting to himself] How dare that idiot Basil pokes his stupid nose into my wonderful scheme and foul up everything?!\n\nFidget: [inside Felicia's mouth] Let me out! Let me out! [opens Felicia's mouth and still struggling for help] Help! [Felicia puts Fidget backs in her mouth with her finger]\n\nProfessor Ratigan: Oh, I can just see that insufferable grin on his smug face! [realizes something] Yes. Yes, I can just see it. Felicia, release him.\n\nFidget: [inside Felicia's mouth] I'm too young to die!\n\n[Felicia sulks for a moment, then spits out a battered Fidget]\n\nProfessor Ratigan: [holding Fidget up by his cheeks] Fidget, you delightful little maniac. You've presented me with a singular opportunity. [drops Fidget, feigning a look of concern] Poor Basil. Oh, he's in for a little surprise.\n\nProfessor Ratigan: Bravo, Basil! A marvelous performance. Though frankly, I expected you 15 minutes earlier. Trouble with the chemistry set, old boy?\n\nBasil: Ratigan, no one can have a higher opinion of you than I have. And I think you're a slimy, contemptible sewer rat!\n\nProfessor Ratigan: Oh, Basil, I just love your disguise! One would hardly recognize you: the greatest detective in all Mousedom! [laughs]\n\nBasil: [enraged] Ratigan, so help me.... [screams] ....I'LL SEE YOU BEHIND BARS YET!\n\nProfessor Ratigan: [also enraged] You fool! Isn't it clear to you? The superior mind has triumphed! I've won! [He, Fidget, and the rest of their posse start laughing at Basil. Basil steels himself against the jeering and pointing, but after a few moments, he slumps and hangs his head as the cruel laughter continues and Professor Ratigan points at him] Ooh, I love it, I love it, I love it!\n\n[Basil and Dawson are tied by Professor Ratigan to a machine, which he explains]\n\nProfessor Ratigan: Let me show you how it works! First, a sprightly tune I've recorded especially for you. [indicates a record player]. As the song plays, the cord tightens, and when the song ends, the metal ball is released, rolling along its merry way until;–– snap! [indicates a mousetrap]. Boom! [indicates a gun] Twang! [indicates a crossbow] Bunk! [indicates an axe and an iron weight] Splat! And so ends the short, undistinguished career of Basil of Baker Street.\n\nDr. David Q. Dawson: You're despicable!\n\nProfessor Ratigan: Yes. Now, I would love to stay and watch, but you were fifteen minutes late, and I do have an important engagement at Buckingham Palace. Now you will remember to smile for the camera, won't you? Say Cheese!\n\n[exit Ratigan; the music plays on the record player].\n\nDr. David Q. Dawson: Basil, what did he mean, An engagement at Buckingham Palace?\n\nBasil of Baker Street: Haven't you guessed, Doctor? The Queen's in danger, the Empire's doomed.\n\nDr. David Q. Dawson: The Queen?!\n\nDr. David Q. Dawson: Basil?\n\nBasil of Baker Street: [groans]\n\nDr. David Q. Dawson: Basil?!?\n\nBasil of Baker Street: Oh, how could I have been so blind?\n\nDr. David Q. Dawson: Well, we all make mistakes, but we can't let that stop us. We have to.\n\nBasil of Baker Street: Ratigan's proved he's more clever than I. He never would have walked into such an obvious trap.\n\nDr. David Q. Dawson: Oh, pull yourself together. You can stop that villain.\n\n[The record begins to skip over Ratigan's continues 'So Long' with repeating the song: \"Goodbye So Soon\".]\n\nDr. David Q. Dawson: Basil, the record!\n\nBasil of Baker Street: It's finally happened! I've been outwitted!\n\nDr. David Q. Dawson: Basil, please!\n\nBasil of Baker Street: Beaten! Duped! Made a fool of! So ridiculed and belittled!\n\nDr. David Q. Dawson: [finally loses his temper] That's enough! [The record resumes playing, startling Dawson.] Dash it all, Basil. The Queen's in danger. Olivia's counting on us. We're about to be horribly splattered, and all you can do is lie there feeling sorry for yourself. I know you can save us, but if you've given up, then why don't we just set it off now and be done with it?!\n\nBasil of Baker Street: [weak chuckle] Set it off now. [slight pauses, as his eyes go wide, and he realizes something] Set it.... off.... now? [suddenly regains his old confidence] Yes, ha-ha-ha, yes, we... we'll set the trap off NOW!\n\nDr. David Q. Dawson: Basil, wait. I didn't mean that we ought--\n\n[The marble starts falling as the record's done.]\n\nBasil of Baker Street: Angle of the trajectory, multiplied by the square root of an isosceles triangle.... [mutters] ....dividing Guttermeg's principle of opposing forces in motion, [continues to mutter] and adjusting for the difference in equilibrium.... [all this while the marble has been rolling closer and closer] Dawson, at the exact moment I tell you, we must release the triggering mechanism. Get ready Dawson, steady.... [Olivia pushed stuck the green bottle in a corks] now! [Dawson screams and the trigger is released, but the bar traps the marble, stops the bar. A spring pops off, hits the gun which misfires into the crossbow. The bow is offset, hitting the axehead off and causing it to chop the mousetrap in half, freeing the two. Finally, the anvil crashes down, burying the axe, shaking the ground, and causes Olivia's bottle to shake and pop her out. Basil then whips off his disguise, and puts his detective outfit back on.] Thank you, Dawson. [catches Olivia] Smile everyone! [Their pictures are taken]\n\n[At Buckingham Palace, the Mouse Queen is preparing for her speech. Outside, the two guards at the door are knocked out by Professor Ratigan's henchmen, dressed as the guards]\n\nThe Henchman 1: [As the other henchmen moves the box to the door] Psst! Over here. Come on. Over here.\n\n[They knock on the door]\n\nThe Mouse Queen: Come in.\n\nThe Henchman 2: Uh, begging your Majesty's pardon? A present has just arrived in honour of your jubilee.\n\nThe Mouse Queen: A present? Oh, how wonderful! Oh, I just adore jubilees.\n\nFidget: [Hands the queen a note] Here you are, sweetheart.\n\nThe Mouse Queen: Have you been with us long? [reads the note sent with the present] \"To our beloved Queen, this gift we send as her 60 year reign...\" [she becomes confused at the last words] \"...comes to an end\"?\n\n[Fidget and the henchmen open the box to reveal an exact duplicate of the Queen.]\n\nThe Mouse Queen: How interesting.\n\n[The Robot Queen activates and chases the real Queen around the room.]\n\nThe Mouse Queen: Good gracious!\n\n[The Robot Queen stops. We see Professor Ratigan at the door with Hiram Flaversham at the controls]\n\nProfessor Ratigan: Amazing likeness, isn't it, Your Majesty?\n\nThe Mouse Queen: Professor Ratigan! [To Professor Ratigan's henchmen] Guards! Seize this despicable creature!\n\n[Fidget and the henchmen do nothing except grin. Professor Ratigan takes control of the Robot Queen]\n\nProfessor Ratigan: [As the Queen] Guards, seize this despicable creature.\n\n[Professor Ratigan cackles into the reciever while Fidget and the henchmen seize the Queen]\n\nThe Mouse Queen: How dare you!\n\nProfessor Ratigan: Take her away. [Rings his bell, dooming the Queen to be a meal for Felicia]\n\nThe Mouse Queen: Let go of me, you ruffians!\n\nFidget: Move along, honey!\n\nThe Mouse Queen: You fiends! [cries] Traitors!\n\n[Professor Ratigan reads an extremely long list of laws he intends to pass as the Queen's Royal Consort]\n\nProfessor Ratigan: Item 96: [chuckles] A heavy tax shall be levied against all parasites and spongers, such as the elderly, the infirm, and especially [glaring] little children.\n\nThe Crippled Old Mouse: That's ridiculous! You're insane!\n\nProfessor Ratigan: Perhaps I haven't made myself clear. [Professor Ratigan grabs the crippled old mouse's crutch, jumps up on stage and snaps it in 2.] I have the power!\n\nThe Robot Queen: Of course you do.\n\nProfessor Ratigan: I am supreme!\n\nThe Robot Queen: Only you.\n\nProfessor Ratigan: THIS IS MY KINGDOM! [laughs maniacally, then calms down] That is, of course, with your Highness's permission. [The Robot Queen doesn't respond. Professor Ratigan slaps it gently to get it going again]\n\nThe Robot Queen: Most assuredly.... you insidious fiend!\n\nProfessor Ratigan: [horrified] What?\n\nThe Robot Queen: You're not my royal consort!\n\nProfessor Ratigan: [to the crowd] What a sense of humour.\n\nThe Robot Queen: You're a cheap fraud and impostor!\n\nProfessor Ratigan: [aside] Flaversham!\n\n[Cut to backstage, where we see Basil at the controls of the robot, Olivia and her father reunited and Fidget and the rest of Professor Ratigan's minions tied up by Dawson and the real Queen]\n\nBasil of Baker Street: [controlling the Robot Queen] A corrupt, vicious, demented, lowlife scoundrel! There's no evil scheme you wouldn't concoct!\n\n[The Robot Queen's head springs up and bites Professor Ratigan on the nose. Professor Ratigan tries in vain to keep the robot down]\n\nThe Robot Queen: No depravity you wouldn't commit!\n\n[The Robot Queen rapidly starts flailing and falling apart until little remains but a pile of scrap metal and a pair of eyes and a set of teeth on a spring.]\n\nBasil of Baker Street: [Controlling the Robot Queen] You, Professor....\n\nThe Robot Queen: [as Professor Ratigan starts to grow infuriated, seeing through the insults] ....are none other than a foul stenchus rodentus, commonly known as a--!\n\nProfessor Ratigan: DON'T SAY IT!\n\nBasil of Baker Street: [reveals himself] SEWER RAT!!\n\n[Professor Ratigan screams in anger upon hearing Basil]\n\nBasil of Baker Street: Arrest that fiend!\n\n[Professor Ratigan sees in horror that Basil is behind him]\n\nOlivia Flaversham: [to Professor Ratigan] Just wait! Basil's smarter than you! He's going to put you in jail. [tugs on his tail to accent her next few insults.] He's not afraid of a big, old, ugly, rat like youǃ\n\nProfessor Ratigan: [being much stronger, easily takes his tail back.] Would you kindly sit down and SHUT UP?!?!?!\n\nFidget: We have to lighten the load! [looks pointedly at Olivia]\n\nProfessor Ratigan: [mockingly] Ohh. You want to lighten the load? Excellent idea!\n\n[Professor Ratigan grabs Fidget and tosses him overboard]\n\nFidget: [as he pitifully flutters in the air] No! Not me! Wait, I can't fly! I can't fly! [falls towards the river]\n\nProfessor Ratigan: [After knocking Basil off the clock hand, seemingly to his death] I'VE WON! AHAHAHAHA!\n\nBasil of Baker Street: On the contrary! The game's not over yet!\n\nOlivia Flaversham: [hugs Basil] Goodbye, Basil. I'll never forget you.\n\n[Basil smiles at Olivia and leans down and puts his hands on her shoulders]\n\nBasil of Baker Street: Nor I you, Miss--Miss Flangerhanger. [Olivia stares for a moment, then shakes her head, a smile on her face]\n\nDr. David Q. Dawson: [chuckles] Whatever.\n\nDr. David Q. Dawson: [closing lines; voiceover] From that time on, Basil and I were a close team, and over the years we had many cases together. But I shall always look back on that first with the most fondness: My introduction to Basil of Baker Street: The Great Mouse Detective.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nBarrie Ingham - Basil of Baker Street/Bartholomew\n\nVal Bettin - Dr. David Q.
