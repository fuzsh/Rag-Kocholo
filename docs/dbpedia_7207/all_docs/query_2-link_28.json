        "text": "MANY of the new crop of children's animated movies are so saturated with powdered sugar that one suspects just watching them will produce cavities. What a treat it is to see an animated feature that doesn't moralize or patronize young children, or drown them in bathos. With ''The Great Mouse Detective,'' which opens today at the New Embassy 49th Street and other theaters, the Disney people have gone back to the basics that have delighted children and their parents for half a century.\n\nThe story takes place in London in 1897. The star is Basil of Baker Street - a brilliant, arrogant neurasthenic little Sherlock Holmes of a mouse who plays the violin and is determined - as much out of vanity as virtue - to defeat his archenemy, Ratigan. Ratigan uses his evil genius to try to conquer all mousedom. Dr. Dawson, a chubby somewhat blustery mouse aristocrat, recently employed on Her Majesty's Service in Afghanistan, becomes Watson to Basil's Sherlock and the two are engaged to help a poor little girl mouse get her father back. The father, a toy maker who is the film's working-class hero, has been kidnapped by Ratigan's peg-legged bat henchmen. The toy maker is forced to help with a nefarious plan to kill the mouse queen and put Ratigan in control.\n\nIn ''The Black Cauldron'' the Disney animators tried to combine their winning formula with some of the new, fast-paced cinematic devices children have become used to from adventure movies such as ''Star Wars'' and ''Raiders of the Lost Ark.'' It was a technique that worked only to a limited degree. But in ''The Great Mouse Detective'' the Disney formula is used undiluted, and that is how it works best. The heroes are appealing, the villains have that special Disney flair - humorous blackguards who really enjoy being evil -and the script is witty and not overly sentimental. Basil is a delightfully cool character. He doesn't even especially like children. When he says farewell to the little girl he has rescued he says with a flourish of British understatement, ''Not a bad child, actually.''\n\nUnlike many modern cartoons, this story does not take place in never-never land but in a real place, at a specific time. It makes reference to historical figures like Napoleon and literary ones like Sherlock Holmes, giving a much appreciated intellectual grounding. Instead of cheap magic tricks to solve all problems, Basil wins in the end by the force of his intelligence. ''Is there a chance to get her back?'' Dawson asks, disconsolate after the little mouse has been kidnapped by the bat. ''There's always a chance, doctor,'' says our hero, ''as long as I can think.''"
