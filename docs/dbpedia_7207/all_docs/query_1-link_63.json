        "text": "For a long time, we owned the movie, “The Great Mouse Detective” on VHS. I was thrilled when Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment gave me the opportunity to review “The Great Mouse Detective (Mystery in the Mist Edition) “ on DVD. The DVD was released on Tuesday, April 13th and is available in stores through the U.S., as well as online. The DVD retails for $19.99.\n\n“The Great Mouse Detective: Mystery in the Mist Edition” is a favorite in our family! We love how adorable and sophisticated the brilliant and tiny Basil of Baker Street is. He is set to take on the evil genius, Dr. Ratigan, in a battle for the entire city of London.\n\nViewers can test their own powers of deduction and go behind the scenes of the movie with bonus features that include:\n\n• So You Think You Can Sleuth? — An animated look at the history of detective\n\nwork, complete with a crime-solving puzzle for the entire family.\n\n• The Making Of “The Great Mouse Detective”\n\n• “The World’s Greatest Criminal Mind” Sing-Along Song\n\nWhen talented toymaker Hiram Flaversham is mousenapped, his winsome daughter Olivia turns to the most famous mouse detective of them all, Basil of Baker Street. Accompanied by his assistant and confidante, Dr. David Q. Dawson, Basil uncovers a villainous plot by the “slimy, contemptible sewer rat” Dr. Ratigan to replace Moustoria, Queen of Mice, with a look-alike robot and take control of the entire rodent population of London. Based on Eve Titus’s book Basil of Baker Street, The Great Mouse Detective channels the spirit of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s most famous creation into a richly animated, Sherlock Holmsian tale set in Victorian-era London’s underground mouse kingdom.\n\nThe Great Mouse Detective: Mystery in the Mist Edition DVD is priced at $19.99 SRP (US) and $24.99 SRP (Canada).\n\nSTREET DATE: April 13, 2010\n\nPricing: $19.99 SRP (US), $24.99 (Canada)\n\nFeature run time: 74 minutes\n\nRated: G\n\nFastPlay™: FastPlay enabled\n\nTechnical specifications may only apply to feature.\n\nAspect ratio: Fullscreen (1.78)\n\nSound: Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound\n\nFrench and Spanish Language Tracks\n\nLanguages: English SDH, French and Spanish Subtitles\n\nFeaturette: Scotland Yard (bonus)\n\nSmall Frame\n\nLarge Frame\n\nFeaturette: Sleuth (bonus)\n\nSmall Frame\n\nLarge Frame\n\nBasil of Baker Street (film)\n\nSmall Frame\n\nLarge Frame\n\nBasil’s Experiment (film)\n\nSmall Frame\n\nLarge Frame\n\nOn the Trail (film)\n\nSmall Frame\n\nLarge Frame\n\nBasil’s Calculations (film)\n\nSmall Frame\n\nLarge Frame\n\nMY THOUGHTS\n\nI really enjoyed watching “The Great Mouse Detective” in a crystal clear picture on DVD and the special features were fun to watch as well. My favorite special features were “The Making of ‘The Great Mouse Detective'” and “The World’s Greatest Criminal Mind” Sing-Along Song. I used to love singing along with the Disney Sing-Along Songs when I was a kid and enjoyed them once again, this time with my own kids. Thanks for another great DVD hit Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment!\n\nI received a copy of “The Great Mouse Detective: Mystery in the Mist Edition” on DVD from Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment to facilitate this review. All opinions expressed in this post are 100% mine."
