        "text": "The Great Mouse Detective is Disney’s 26th animated film. The film focuses on the detective Basil as he and his sidekick Dawson help Olivia find her kidnapped father.\n\nDirected by: Ron Clements, John Musker, David Michener and Burny Mattinson.\n\nCast\n\nRatigan was voiced by Vincent Price. This wasn’t Vincent’s first voice role, he has voiced many different characters throughout his career. This experience taught him to act out his line in the booth as well as voice them as this gives the character more depth and personality. Ratigan’s animator, Glen Keane used some of Vincent’s mannerisms when animating Ratigan.\n\nVincent also narrates the Disneyland Paris Phantom Manor attraction.\n\nBasil of Baker Street was voiced by Barrie Ingham.\n\nDawson was voiced by Val Bettin.\n\nOlivia Flaversham was voiced by Susanne Pollatschek. This is Susanne’s only film work to date. She recorded the lines in London when she was just 8 years old.\n\nHiram Flaversham was voiced by Alan Young. Alan has worked a lot with Disney over the years. Returning again and again to voice Uncle Scrooge McDuck.\n\nFidget was voiced by Candy Candido. This was not Candy’s first voice role for a Disney film, he had previously voiced an Indian Chief in “Peter Pan”, Maleficents Goon in “Sleeping Beauty”, Brutus and Nero in “The Rescuers” and many more characters.\n\nMrs. Judson, Basil’s maid, was voiced by Diana Chesney.\n\nThe Mouse Queen was voiced by Eve Brenner.\n\nMiss Kitty, the dancing and singing mouse, was voiced by Melissa Manchester. She actually wrote the song she performed in the film. Melissa has said that while recording the song she danced along and several of her dance moves make it into Miss Kitty’s dance routine. This was very bold for Disney as the character dances in a very skimpy outfit in a provocative manner. It’s not something you’d normally expect from a children’s film.\n\nFilm Development\n\nThe film is based off the book “Basil of Baker Street” written by Eve Titus which itself is inspired heavily of the books of “Sherlock Holmes” written by Arthur Conan Doyle. Eve named her main character, the detective Basil because the role of Sherlock Holmes was performed by Basil Rathbone.\n\nDr. David Q. Dawson is based on John H. Watson from the original story. Mrs Judson is based on Mrs. Hudson from the original stories and Ratigan is based on Moriarty, who is Sherlock Holmes’s evil nemesis.\n\nWithin the film it’s revealed that Basil lives within the home of the real Sherlock Holmes who we see in shadow form along with Watson. The voices of these characters were taken from the Sherlock Holmes film starring Basil Rathbone and Laurie Main.\n\nOnce it was decided that they were going to turn “Basil of Baker Street” into a film they needed to work out what the plot would be, who the characters would be and so on. When working on the characters they did more planning than normal, they planned out each characters life story even though none of that research would be seen on screen.\n\nIt took only 4 years for the film to be made, that quite a short amount of time in comparison to other Disney films.\n\nOriginally the film was going to be titled “Basil of Baker Street”, just like the book. However when discussing how to market the film they thought that title didn’t make much sense so Peter Schneider changed the name to “The Great Mouse Detective”. Peter was the president of Walt Disney Feature Animation at the time. The new title didn’t really sit well with the animators but knowing that the decision was final someone sent out a fake joke memo to the employees at Disney explaining how they were going to change the names of many Disney classics. For example Snow White would be renamed “Seven Little Men Help a Girl”, Pinocchio would be “The Wooden Boy Who Became Real”, 101 Dalmatians would become “Puppies Taken Away”, The Jungle Book would be “A Boy, a Bear and a Big Black Cat” and so on. Everyone saw the funny side expect Peter Schneider.\n\nThe story was picked up by the newspapers and the memo became inspiration for a category on Jeopardy titled “In Other Words”.\n\nCGI\n\nTowards the end of the film there is a scene where Ratigan, Basil and Olivia are inside Big Ben, the clock tower. In that scene the characters are hand drawn, like the rest of the film, however the gears are computer animated. This was a little test that became common in Disney films while they learn how to use CGI. For example CGI is used in the ballroom dance scene of “Beauty and the Beast”. CGI was expensive and new, animators weren’t sure what the limitations were so little test scene were really exciting for the animators.\n\nThis was only the 4th film that came out with CGI, however if we didn’t have little test sequences like we do in The Great Mouse Detective then we might not have complete CGI films like “Tangled” and “Frozen”.\n\nMusic\n\nHenry Mancini was the composer for the film.\n\nRelease, Reception and Awards\n\nThe Great Mouse Detective premiered in NYC on 23rd June 1986 and then it was released to the world later throughout the year. The film received positive review however it died a painful death in comparison to Steven Spielberg’s animated film “An American Tail” which received $22million at the box office MORE than “The Great Mouse Detective”. Now Disney weren’t the only company releasing successful animated films.\n\nThe only award “The Great Mouse Detective” won was for Best Sound Editing, by comparison “An American Tail” won two Grammys and was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe. It was obviously time for Disney to step up their game.\n\nEaster Egg\n\nThere is a Dumbo bubble toy that can be seen in the toy store.\n\nOpinion\n\nI really enjoyed the first 40 minutes of the film but after that I lost interest. I thought the plot became too silly and it wasn’t enjoyable to watch. I also didn’t like how adult it was with scenes of kidnapping, murder, smoking and provocative dancing. I also didn’t like that it was another Sherlock Holmes style film. It feels like it’s been done to death and done much better in my opinion.\n\nLet me know your thoughts in the comments bellow, do you like the film? What do you think about all the smoking?"
