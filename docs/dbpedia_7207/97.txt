“The Great Mouse Detective” (1986), Walt Disney Animation Studios’ 26th animated motion picture. Based on the Basil of Baker Street books by Eve Titus and Paul Galdone. Disney’s lighthearted take on the Sherlock Homes mystery genre. A diverting film and a return to form for the studio. “There’s always a chance…as long as one can think.”
