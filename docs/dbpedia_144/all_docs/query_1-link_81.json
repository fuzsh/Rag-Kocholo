        "text": "This page of IGN's Animal Crossing: New Horizons guide is about explaining the differences between Nook Miles, a new currency introduced in the game, and Bells, the long-standing currency present in all major Animal Crossing releases.\n\nIn-Game Currency\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nIn Animal Crossing: New Horizons, there are two forms of in-game currency. In previous versions of the games, Bells were the only currency used to purchase items. However, while the mobile game Pocket Camp introduced Leaf Tickets that could be earned by completing tasks or with real money, New Horizons only features Nook Miles and Bells.\n\nBells\n\nBells are the recurring primary currency in the Animal Crossing franchise, and are roughly equivalent to the Japanese Yen. For almost all transactions, you'll require or receive Bells, including at Nook's Cranny, The Roost, buying cards at the Dodo Airlines airport, or making exchanges with your Villagers.\n\nThere are several different ways one can find or earn Bells in ACNH:\n\nSell stuff at Nook's Cranny. Practically anything can be sold at Nook's Cranny, from Flowers worth next to nothing all the way up to incredibly valuable Fish and Bugs. Villagers can also offer to buy things from you if your Friendship is strong enough.\n\nShaking Bell Coins out of Trees. Be careful, you may shake out a Wasp Nest instead! Bring a Net.\n\nHitting the Money Rock. If you can stop yourself from moving backwards when hitting it, you can get over 14,000 Bells this way. We have a page on How to Get 8 Items from Every Rock, Every Time.\n\nDig up the Glowing Spot. Digging at the glowing spot in the ground that appears each day will give 1,000 Bells.\n\nGrow a Money Tree in the Glowing Spot. If you bury some Bells in the shining hole where you dug on the Glowing Spot, it'll grow into a Money Tree. Check out our guide on How to Plant a Money Tree to learn more.\n\nBells can then be spent on buying Furniture, Tools and other items at Nook's Cranny, buying clothing from Able Sisters, buying pretty much anything via Nook Shopping, or the wares of the various merchants who may visit your island, like Kicks, Redd, Daisy Mae or Sahara. You can also eventually spend it on housing and infrastructure via Tom Nook at Resident Services, such as moving buildings or paying off your home loan.\n\nWhen you hit 99,999 Bells, excess Bells will be kept in one of your Inventory slots and take up space. It's a good idea to deposit your spare Bells into your bank account via the Nook Stop terminal inside Resident Services, or via the ABD that you can order with NookMiles.\n\nNook Miles\n\nNook Miles is the new, secondary form of currency. Rather than being earned through selling items, Nook Miles are awarded for completing various tasks, including catching bugs and sea creatures, chopping down trees, watering flowers, planting crops, completing DIY and Cooking Recipes, doing group stretching, catching snowflakes during winter, having a cup of coffee at The Roost, and so much more.\n\nThere are two types of Nook Miles achievements:\n\nNormal Nook Miles are the long list of cards in the Nook Miles app on your NookPhone. these are themed chains awarded for long-term accomplishments, like catching a certain number of bugs or visiting a particular amount of Nook Miles Islands.\n\nNook Miles + is the section at the top of the Nook Miles app. These are smaller accomplishments that are in infinite supply: once you complete one, another will replace it. Notably, the first five of these you get on any given day will always have at least a x2 multiplier on them. Tasks can include talking to a few Villagers or performing the group stretching minigame.\n\nNook Miles can then be spent at the Nook Stop, the green terminal in the corner of Resident Services. It has a special section where you can spend your Miles. Items here include town-themed objects like vending machines, lamp posts and ferris wheels, practical upgrades like the Tool Wheel and expanded inventory, and cosmetics like extra emotes and more hairstyles.\n\nYou can also spend them on Nook Miles Tickets, which you can spend at the airport to fly to a randomly-chosen Nook Miles Island. These allow you to get more resources such as wood, stones and iron if you've gotten as much of these as you can already, which is very helpful in the early game.\n\nPretty much all of the new features added to New Horizons after launch can be purchased with Nook Miles, so check here if you can't seem to find something!"
