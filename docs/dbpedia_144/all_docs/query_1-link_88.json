        "text": "Street Fighter 6\n\nThe Nikkei 225, an index for the Tokyo Stock Exchange, has dropped over 12% on August 5, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThe news agency cited a surge in the yen against the US dollar, rising interest rates, and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East as the main reasons behind the stock rout. This was the largest single-day drop for Japanese shares since 1987’s Black Monday collapse.\n\nAs spotted by industry analyst and Kantan Games CEO Serkan Toto, many Japanese game-related companies saw their shares slide. Below are the biggest drops at the close of today’s trading:\n\nCave Interactive — down 26.87%;\n\nCapcom — down 17.3%;\n\nNintendo — down 16.53%;\n\nMarvelous — down 16.1%;\n\nSEGA — down 13.62%;\n\nNexon — down 13.45%;\n\nKonami — down 11.69%;\n\nCyberagent — down 11.35%;\n\nKoei Tecmo — down 8.14%;\n\nSony — down 7.6%;\n\nSquare Enix — down 4.76%.\n\nUPDATE (August 6): Serkan Toto noted that almost all companies regained their losses on Tuesday, including Nintendo (shares up 12%), Sega (+13%), Capcom (+18%), and Nexon (+12%).\n\nMany other stock exchanges across the globe also tumbled, including Nasdaq (-6.34%) and the pan-European STOXX 600 index (-3%). Overall, European shares fell to near six-month lows, while South Korea’s Kospi fell 9% to its lowest since April.\n\nAnother reason for the global stock route is that the US economy added 114,000 jobs last month (fewer than expected), with the jobless rating rising to 4.3% (the highest since October 2021).\n\n“Markets were on edge before Friday but a weak payrolls has really escalated a profound move across the globe,” Deutsche Bank global head of macro research Jim Reid told the Guardian, adding that “it’s like the market has added up two plus two and made nine.”"
