        "text": "By Ho Qingxiang\n\nFinding New Ways to Develop Paradise\n\nThe concept of Animal Crossing was first developed by Katsuya Eguchi, a 21 years old man who moved from his hometown of Chiba and relocated to Kyoto in order to start his job at Nintendo in 1986. Having to leave behind his family and friends to adapt to a new environment, Eguchi felt immensely lonely and disoriented. These feelings went on to become the essential themes of Animal Crossing: family, friendship and community.\n\nWhile Animal Crossing has to some extent retained these core themes as the series grew over the years when it comes to player-to-player engagement, the games have treated relationships with villagers or NPCs (non-playable characters) more as accessories rather than reciprocal interactions. Furthermore, the role of the players have expanded from being a neighbour to becoming a policy maker. In Animal Crossing New Horizons, players can greatly influence the structure of the game world by constructing buildings, laying down roads, terraforming landmass and enacting laws to suit their whims.\n\nIronically, these features have transformed players into authoritative god-like despots who do what they can to maintain their nicely-manicured paradise. In terms of game design, this is a popular motivating factor for players who are more conscientious and open to experiences. It is satisfying to see your actions have payoffs quickly and to have absolute control over the beauty and efficiency of your creations without fearing retaliation. People who have maintained gardens or renovated their houses can easily relate. This power over things while still receiving praise also psychologically reduces the impact of loneliness and solitude, making Animal Crossing the ideal game for many shy individuals.\n\nBecause relationships are complicated and difficult matters, Animal Crossing’s main focus is on customisation, decoration and collection. For the series to grow as a franchise, I believe attention should be redirected to exploring relationships and interactivity to better enliven the game world.\n\nAnimal Crossing games are well-suited for players who want relaxing fun and creative control.\n\nSuggestion 1: Create a Narrative with Multiple Mysteries\n\nAnimal Crossing is not known to have a compelling story. Usually, the game reaches an end point once you collect and construct enough things. In many ways, this is a good thing because a strict narrative can get in the way of the non-linear progression of the players. However, to aid in exploration and discovery, it can be greatly motivating to know that you are unravelling a story while you are collecting and constructing stuff. The best way to blend this narrative to the game’s non-linear structure is to introduce multiple mysteries around a central theme or lore. This is similar to games like No Man’s Sky where multiple endings can be reached from a similar set of actions.\n\nEach mystery functions like an open-world quest where you can start and drop off at any time during the game. The mystery comprises of a sequence of objectives that may be done in a specific order. Once the mystery is completed, you will receive a conclusion that shines new light on the game world, and the you are free to explore another mystery until all are finished. Any NPCs that are involved in the mystery become important figures for a moment and you deepen your relationships with them during the process. For this story to work, no combat systems are needed.\n\nRegarding the central theme, there are plenty of templates that can be used such as a wild west theme, a pirate theme, a sci-fi theme, or a feudal theme. Given the fantastical and quirky nature of Animal Crossing, even if the players decorated their world in conflict with the theme, it will be fine since the point of Animal Crossing is carving out your own piece of paradise in the world. Familiar Animal Crossing favourites like Isabelle and Tom Nook can take on new identities and interact with players in refreshing ways that are not bound to roles in previous games. For example, Animal Crossing can take place in a space colony on an alien planet and Isabelle can become a scientist tasked to help you terraform the environment. With this, every subsequent Animal Crossing can be treated like a theatrical adaptation with the villagers role-playing new identities each time. The possibilities are endless.\n\nWhile Animal Crossing allows players to imagine their own stories, it can be beneficial to have secret mysteries to unravel.\n\nSuggestion 2: Level Up Relationships with Villagers\n\nCurrently, Animal Crossing characters are largely one dimensional. Other than more prominent characters such as shopkeepers and assistants, most villagers are caricatures of stereotypes. For example, Ankha is a snooty cat villager who dresses in Egyptian attire. She also she loves makeup and gossiping. However, that is pretty much the most you can learn about her. You do not get to know her motivations or her upbringing. This makes most characters in Animal Crossing feel more like decorative acquaintances rather than friends.\n\nA way to build stronger bonds with your fellow NPCs or Villagers is to have you complete a sequence of quests from them to reveal their personalities incrementally. This is similar to the Persona games where you level up your bonds with NPCs by hanging out with them to open up new dialogues and revelations. The activities that you do for the villager can be simple, such as collecting objects, taking photographs, or decorating spaces. Ideally, you would want to know the characters on a deep level, but given the number of characters in Animal Crossing, creating unique dialogue for each of them can be a huge undertaking. At minimum, each character should voice out character details like their likes and dislikes, their hobbies and their troubles, their ambitions and their fears, as well as their upbringing and history. To incentivise players to level up relationships, villagers who are close to you could give you gifts or help in projects to lessen your need to buy everything with currency.\n\nIf paired with Suggestion 1, your relationship with your villagers can be used to trigger story cues or hidden events that can further create memorable moments. To work around the random appearance of villagers in the game, the story cues can be tied to traits that are shared by multiple characters to increase the chances of the story progressing.\n\nBuild relationships with your villagers to unlock new dialogue and uncover new information.\n\nSuggestion 3: Have a Skill Tree to Dampen Randomness\n\nAnimal Crossing is a game filled with tasks and checklists. These tasks are often repetitive yet simplistic to do, but they are made frustrating due to the randomness of the results. From catching bugs and fish to digging up items and materials, your daily efforts can fail to achieve your targets. On one hand, having randomness can introduce a sense of surprise and delight when players get lucky. Such randomness can also encourage trade between players and prolong player retention. On the other hand, players greatly feel unsatisfied when their efforts go unrewarded and this can also push players to abandon the game.\n\nTo invoke a sense of progression despite the randomness, Animal Crossing can introduce a skill tree system similar to Stardew Valley. By using specific tools or doing specific actions, players can gain a skill level to improve their proficiency. Players can unlock ‘tricks’ that they could use to trigger the spawning of specific bugs and fish, or improve their luck in the game, allowing them to obtain rare objects easier. This skill tree system can be blended together with the current Nook Miles system where players aim to complete a quota or checklist in order to receive a badge of recognition in the same way as Scout badges.\n\nAdding on to ‘tricks’, it will be ideal for every collectible living creature to have a recognisable pattern in which they interact with the environment. Currently, players can obtain ants by leaving turnips on the ground or lure moths with lanterns. Seeing as how real people also rely on rituals or secret techniques to catch their prize, these tricks do not need to be realistic or scientific to maintain the immersion in game.\n\nHaving a skill tree can give players a stronger objective, making their tasks more meaningful.\n\nSuggestion 4: Make ‘Time Travel’ into a Feature\n\nTime travel in Animal Crossing means adjusting the date and time settings in your game device in order to work around the time-gated mechanics. While this is not a form of hacking, the process remains a heated topic in the player community. Some players say time travel goes against the intrinsic design of the game with respect to time-based progression. In some ways, time travel can create an uneven play space where some players have more than others and this can be seen as cheating.\n\nIn view of this, the better solution is to remove real-world time as a core gatekeeper or make time travel a game mechanic. The time concept has always been a gimmick of Animal Crossing rather than a need. Unlike modern mobile games where time is used as a form of monetisation, Animal Crossing does not have a feature where players pay real-world money to reduce time. Buildings should not need to take real-time to appear. There is no benefit for players to wait other than limiting their play time or training their patience. Instead, the real-time mechanic adds more anxiety onto players by pushing FOMO (fear of missing out). In place of time, quantity of actions should be be the core gatekeeper to prolong player retention as mentioned in suggestion 3.\n\nWhile Animal Crossing should retain its day and night cycle, there can be a feature that allows players to pass the time immediately to their desired point. Like Minecraft, sleeping on a bed can give players the option to wake up at a specific time. While online limited period events like holidays can still be tied to real-world dates for the festive mood, they do not affect the main game and are optional to participate in. These events can be added into the main game at a later date in the form of modular memories that players can relive through a new character similar to Luna. In this way, the thrill and zeitgeist of holidays can be maintained without causing depression in players who missed out.\n\nRegarding seasons, it will be more convenient to create zones where the seasons are constant so that players can catch seasonal creatures at ease. These zones are like biodomes and are separate from your main area. The structure of these zones can be subjected to some daily randomness to excite players to visit regularly, and players are not allowed to terraform or customise these zones.\n\nRather than push players to adjust their device settings, make time travel into a tool within the game.\n\nSuggestion 5: Create Interactive Multiplayer Mini-Games\n\nMy biggest grape with Animal Crossing is the lack of interactivity of the furniture, especially the outdoor ones. You cannot shoot hoops in the basketball count, you cannot ride the carnival rides, and you cannot operate the claw machine to win prizes. It is reasonable to expect that not everything in the game could be highly interactive, but given that New Horizons has started the emphasis on more players being able to hang out in a single space, I believe it is time to introduce multiplayer mini-games in the new Animal Crossing.\n\nCurrently, players have to manipulate the game in unexpected ways to create mini-games. While this is a cool way to flex your creativity, I would prefer to have ready-made mini-games within some of the furnitures. For example, entering the basketball court triggers an option to start a shooting contest where players can aim and score as many shots as possible within a time limit. Other players for the contest can be selected from a lobby. If there are no other players around, neighbouring villagers can be selected to play with. Other activities can include bowling, jumping rope and hitting music beats.\n\nOn the topic of fishing, that activity can be made more interesting by using the simple yet satisfying fishing mechanic of Kirby and the Forgotten Land. A mixture of button mashing and quick-time reactions can help to break up the monotony of Animal Crossing’s fishing. Add on a multiplayer aspect where players can compete to see who caught the biggest or heaviest fish is a sure-win to have fun with friends.\n\nFans have used their creativity to craft their own mini-games in Animal Crossing, but having in-built mini-games will be more appealing.\n\nThe Potential\n\nIn recent years, there have been plenty of games that shared the same comfy life-sim vibes as Animal Crossing. However, Animal Crossing continues to maintain a charm that feels unique and enduring. That said, the series have been hitting an overly familiar rhythm. While each entry in the series have been improving in terms of quality of life features and a growing variety of decorations, the formula largely feels the same, going as far as to import mechanics from the first game that are mostly obsolete and unattractive in modern gaming.\n\nI imagine the next game in the series to continue holding on to its traditional roots but innovating in its execution. Animal Crossing has always been about relatedness, so having stronger story elements and deeper character relationships would give players more things to talk about. Reducing tedious randomness and time-gating would also decrease anxiety in players and improve the game’s relaxing atmosphere. Finally, by incorporating more interactive mini-games for multiplayer participation in the form of furniture, this new game would increase community engagement and attract retention.\n\nLife-sim game design is more than abstracting realism into a game format. The goal is still to make an entertaining and motivational game for the purpose of escapism. My hope for Animal Crossing is for the series to take more risks in fantastical interpretations of real life, rather than be stubborn in trying to mimic real-life in the game world."
