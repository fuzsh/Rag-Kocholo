Animal Crossing(Gamecube)\n\nThis version was a great start but compared to the others it feels a bit bland with limited features. I still had alot of fun with it,fun game\n\n3. Animal Crossing:Wild World(Nintendo DS)\n\nThis version was a massive hit when it came out because of all the new features and compatibility. Everything from the first AC was expanded upon greatly. Sharing a house was a hassle tho...\n\n2. Animal Crossing: City Folk(Wii)\n\nThis game was great and had some great new features and it is technically better than the last 2, but the main problem I had with this version is that it didn't do to much to differentiate itself from ACWW\n\n1. Animal Crossing: New Leaf(Nintendo 3DS)\n\nThere's no suprise this is #1. It's just perfect. Clearly Nintendo thought alot and made great new ideas, (along with Hamsters and Deer who are awesome ^-^) Every possible thing was expanded upon and this is the best true AC experience\n\nJust for fun I will put them in terms of presentation\n\nI wont count the original because it was the one that started it all\n\n3. City Folk. Like I said they didn't work to hard on this one which made it to similar to WW\n\n2. Wild World. I had a real tough time between this and NL but I decided to put WW here on the list. Like I said,it expanded upon all the great things of the original.\n\n1. New Leaf. With all of it's great ideas it just made for an amazing game with amazing ideas\n\nSo what's your list?\n\nHere's to hoping we get another AC soon!\n\nSatan915 7 years ago#2\n\nCity Folk had terrible grass deterioration and like you said it was basically a non-portable Wild World, so Wild World would rank better in my opinion. But New Leaf would definitely be the best for all the improvements and additions it got, while also referencing or expanding concepts from the original game like starting on a Train with Rover, Gulliver appearing on the beach, having a basement (unlike Wild World), an island, an event Plaza similar to the event Pond, and PWPs that include Town Decorations or structures that were present in the original game. The original game itself however would probably be ranked the lowest since it is the most basic and non-portable, although some people may disagree and rank it above City Folk and even Wild World (especially now that Wild World and City Folk lost online functionality if you count that).\n\nXLudicoloX 7 years ago#3\n\n1. New Leaf\n\n2. Wild World\n\n3. Animal Crossing GC (better than wild world but had no online)\n\n4. City Folk (waste of $60) (felt like a copy paste wild world)\n\nHeliotrope 7 years ago#4\n\n1: New Leaf\n\n2: City Folk\n\n3: Game Cube\n\n4: Wild World\n\nNL is easily my new favourite. I think they improve as each game goes on really (it makes it kind of hard to go back and play the old ones though, to be honest ^^).\n\nIt's hard to choose between the Wii/GC version because I really enjoyed both, but CF is the one I've played most, so I'll put that in 2nd.\n\nWild World on the other hand I could not stand. I litterally found it difficult to play, between the bad graphics/framerate and having to stare down at the bottom screen all the time - it gave me a neck ache when I played it. XD\n\nloseswithluigi 7 years ago#5\n\nGCN: I like the acre system, the player house town square and NES games.\n\nACNL: Barring what I like more about GCN this game is the sum of its predecessors and more\n\nACWW: Some improvements, some steps back in my eyes from GCN\n\nACCF: Mostly a copy paste job, and annoyingly disjointed city and incredibly quick grass degredation, yeesh.\n\nSatan915 7 years ago#6\n\nloseswithluigi posted...\n\nGCN: I like the acre system, the player house town square and NES games.\n\nOh yeah, the NES games were nice and likely haven't and wont appear in future games because of Virtual Console. But there were some that you needed an e-Reader card or even hacking device for. As for acres it was nice that their borders were more obvious, but they were the most restrictive in this game since the camera was locked in place in each acre, and villagers couldn't leave them. In New Leaf it's nice that the acres became irrelevant to getting a perfect town. The town square may have looked nice but all the player houses had to be near each other because of it.\n\nkatysu 7 years ago#7\n\nI never played the game cube version, and didn't try to get a copy to play on the wii.\n\nIn part this was due to the shifting acre system - this movement can cause headaches & nausea & cos of other times I got headaches (while watching automatic changing slides on a projector & similar) I made a guess I could be affected.\n\nI played acww, and liked it, but looking back I remember the slog to get bells, no proper holidays, (I never want to play la di da day ever again), the small screens & poor graphics.\n\nI also remember that it could be difficult to wifi with other players - to do so I would have had to disable the firewall and that wasn't an option on the family PC.\n\nHostile hacking could lead not only to another player losing their game (remember those town hall seeds put in front of your house etc) but in a few cases actually bricked the DS itself.\n\nAccf was a breath of fresh air for me - I loved it, beautiful lush graphics, proper holidays, I could wifi with other players - even speak with them via Wii speak, and I experienced DLC for the first time.\n\nGrass wear was an issue until I learned how to manage it - thanks to the players who edited the game and found out the mechanics.\n\nThe downside to editing was HDLC - which spread like a virus through the whole community. Maybe it didn't do any harm but you were not given a choice as to whether it entered your game or not - unless you shut down and didn't wifi with other players at all.\n\nAnd then we got new leaf - a major upgrade loads of new things to do, being Mayor, PWP, swimming, streetpassing, different types of DLC (spotpass, Nintendo Zone & download), Club Tortimer islands, easy connection to other players.\n\nHacking has reared its head again but on the whole is at least neutral in its effects.\n\nSo for me New leaf is the best so far, in particular I like the connections to other towns - via streetpass & the HHA plaza houses, dream towns & Club Tortimer.\n\nMagicalMeltdown 7 years ago#8\n\nNew Leaf and Wild World are my favorites in the series, I've probably spent equal amounts of time on them, but NL is better due to the amount of new features added, but I do prefer WW's opening music.\n\nI didn't enjoy the Wii game but I can't explain why? I think I just prefer the handheld consoles and didn't spend enough time playing.\n\nI've never played the gamecube version but I remember my cousin had it and I messed up her town when I was younger, oops.\n\nFC: 0619 - 3190 - 6388\n\nDream Address: 6800-5924-4719 | Town of Gayville, Mayor Kirsty\n\nVermillion612 7 years ago#9\n\nI've only played ACNL and the original on the GC.\n\n1) ACNL\n\n2)AC on Game Cube\n\nBefore I started coming to this board I never knew there were other games in the series (which tells me they must have been poorly promoted).\n\nFC: 1435-4373-0803 Town Name: Paradise Mayor & Mii Name: Lon"
