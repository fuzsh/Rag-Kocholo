        "text": "The Wednesday Inbox wonders how Microsoft makes any money out of Game Pass, as one reader highlights the pros and cons of being PC-only.\n\nTo join in with the discussions yourself email gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk\n\nMissing in action\n\nI find it incredible that we have now gone a whole generation without a ‘new’ game from the following franchises: Splinter Cell, Saints Row, Fable, Dead Space, Crysis, Max Payne, and Bioshock. Not including remakes and remasters, we haven’t technically had a new GTA, Ratchet & Clank, or a mainstream Gran Turismo, depending on where you stand on GT Sport.\n\nI’m sure there are plenty more, but all of the ones I have listed had at least two games in the last generation and were, at the very least, generally well received. Some were completed trilogies, yet not even a reboot seems to be on the cards. That seems amazing to me when this generation has been going six and a half years. I’m of course hoping for these franchises to be revived and with backwards compatibility expected to be commonplace in the next gen, this should lead to less cash-ins on remasters.\n\nShould…\n\nNatorDom\n\nGC: The problem is a lot of those franchises died off a good few years before this generation began. Although the lack of Gran Turismo and Saints Row is certainly surprising.\n\nSunk costs\n\nAdmittedly I haven’t gone back to it since launch but is Anthem really worth saving? Apart from the controls being good I’ve never heard anyone say anything particularly good about it. In fact I don’t remember anyone saying anything about it full stop.\n\nIt all smacks of the sunk cost fallacy to me, where they think they’ve spent so much money on it already they have to keep doing it until it’s a hit. But I don’t think it works that way.\n\nWouldn’t the sensible thing to do be take out the controls and the graphics and use that in a new Mass Effect? I’m sure there’s some technical reason why that wouldn’t work but it makes sense to me. Unless they’re planning to make the game free-to-play at some point? That could save it, I guess, but it all seems a bit pointless continuing with a game no-one cares about when people are actually excited about the ones BioWare aren’t making.\n\nAncel\n\nComplete package\n\nI really hope Nintendo doesn’t mess Animal Crossing: New Horizons up with microtransactions. I’m relatively confident they won’t and this ‘in-game purchases’ thing is like Fire Emblem: Three Houses, but it’s certainly a test for them. For me one of the big appeals of Nintendo games is that they’re always full of content, have no bugs, and are the complete package. If that changed it would change the whole way I think about them.\n\nThat said I am generally in favour of expansion passes, which are at worst pointless (Zelda: Breath Of The Wild) and at best seem to be a much better way of introducing new content than the old director’s cuts (Pokémon Sword and Shield).\n\nWe’ll just have to wait and see but I hope that just as Activision seems to be pulling back on microtransactions Nintendo don’t take over from them.\n\nCatalog\n\nE-mail your comments to: gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk\n\nAdding it up\n\nRE: Game Pass. Many people talk about it not being good for future AAA titles, especially the Microsoft day one titles and all that lost revenue from game sales. Gears 5 had 3 million players early in its launch on Game Pass. If we guess maybe 1 million of those would have bought the game if there was no Game Pass, at £40 a pop, that’s £40 million in lost revenue. Surely Game Pass isn’t sustainable for AAA Microsoft exclusives coming to Game Pass day one?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Game Pass? Do you think it will still be around in its current state two to three years down the line? Will AAA titles decrease in numbers if something like Game Pass really takes off?\n\nJez\n\nGC: From a consumer’s point of view it’s excellent value for money. We agree from a layman’s perspective it seems unsustainable, but Microsoft continue to push it more and more, so we assume the numbers must add up somehow. Considering all the new studios they’ve bought recently, Microsoft seem intent on significantly increasing the number of first party games.\n\nEveryone can see that\n\nThat Pokémon leak story is so weird. I don’t understand what the reviewer was gaining by leaking the information? He didn’t get any money for it and he didn’t advance his career. Instead he got sacked and labelled as an idiot… for what?\n\nSometimes I get the distinct impression that some people don’t realise that the Internet is public and everyone can see what they’re doing!\n\nI’m curious as to how Nintendo tracked this guy down though as they said it quickly became obvious who it was. Do review copies of games have special codes in them or something? I don’t see how they’d know it was them? I’d laugh if it was because they used a traceable onscreen name.\n\nAustin\n\nGC: Sometimes games have their own unique onscreen codes, that would appear in any screen grab, but that’s very rare. Usually it’s just done on trust, which is why incidents like this upset everyone in the business.\n\nNothing new\n\nIn response to Cranston, while I wasn’t one of those to criticise the feature in the Underbox I didn’t think it made its point terribly well, and it should be fine to say that, as long as you don’t make it personal. The main point of contention for me was the authors refusal to consider any games that have been released previously, even recently.\n\nWhile they are not newly released games, if you haven’t played them, and they are worth playing, what’s the difference? They are new to you. I’d also point out that he wrote ‘I don’t like to whine, but…’, which sits right alongside ‘I don’t mean to be offensive, but…’ as a statement of intent.\n\nMore positively, I’d suggest that if Andrew J hasn’t played Prey, he takes a look. Outside of the deceptive opening section it’s a real spiritual sequel to the System Shock series and an absolutely terrific game.\n\nMatt Woolley (he_who_runs_away – PSN ID)\n\nGC: But the lack of newly released games was the main point of the article?\n\nOcarina of light\n\nRE: Royce and ocarinas. There’s lots of ocarinas for sale in ancient tourist towns in China like Lijiang and Suzhou, for some reason. You can get them in all different sizes, and the song they often have playing in those shops is a version of the Trails In The Sky The Whereabouts of Light theme tune.\n\nSpeaking of the Ocarinas of Time, anyone else see University Challenge on Monday night where a team of four top academics thought a NES was an N64? Made me feel old.\n\nOwen Pile (NongWen – PSN ID)\n\nGC: We’re curious, what exactly was the question?\n\nCatch up on every previous Games Inbox here\n\nHappy birthday\n\nI’ve been PC gaming only since February last year (just realised this is my one-year anniversary!). In an ideal world I’d have both console and PC as there are pros and cons to both. One con is that I’ve played fewer triple-A titles and some I might not ever play, even though I’ve got a passing interest in them. Take Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare for instance. I played the beta but didn’t like the multiplayer, so it wasn’t a day one purchase. Had I still had a console, I’d have bought it on disc second-hand by now, blasted through the campaign then flogged it.\n\nAs people have mentioned already, PC gaming means no second-hand market as you are practically digital only. Modern Warfare probably won’t drop in price low enough for me to buy it anytime soon but this leads to one of my pros, which won’t be true for everyone but because I’ve played fewer triple-A games I’ve played more older titles and particularly, more indie games over the past year than I would have done otherwise. Superliminal and Baba Is You to name two, which are both fantastic. I’ve previously wrote about Superliminal and I have to thank GC for their glowing praise of Baba Is You in their top 20 of 2019 which led me to get it.\n\nPsillyPseudonym\n\nPS: Here is a Steam code for GC to give away for the upcoming Bleeding Edge closed beta. It runs from February 14 – 17 and you can preload it now.\n\nGC: That’s very good of you, we’ll give it to whoever asks for it and sends us a useable Inbox letter.\n\nInbox also-rans\n\nJust a quick message to say you can get to The Last Of Us Part 2 themes on the PSN Store for free at the moment. Just downloaded mine. Looking forward to Part 2, as I really enjoyed the first game.\n\nAndrew J.\n\nFan art Yoshi and Peach, painting and smoothing still to do but coming along.\n\nShrekseviltwin\n\nGC: Did you sculpt that yourself?\n\nThis week’s Hot Topic\n\nThis weekend’s Inbox is devoted to the Readers’ Top 20 of 2019, where you get to vote on your favourite games of last year.\n\nAs usual, all you need to do is send us a list of your three favourite games and we’ll log your vote and present the results on Saturday. If you want to also describe why you made your choices then we’ll use that in the Hot Topic, where everyone can go into detail on their top picks.\n\nUnlike our Top 20 the only limitations are that the game has to have been released new in the UK in 2019, so as long as that’s true you can vote for anything you like – including remakes, remasters, re-releases, etc. Feel free to also let us know what you thought of 2019 in general and how it compares to previous years.\n\nE-mail your comments to: gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk\n\nThe small print\n\nNew Inbox updates appear every weekday morning, with special Hot Topic Inboxes at the weekend. Readers’ letters are used on merit and may be edited for length.\n\nYou can also submit your own 500 to 600-word 4Player viewer features at any time, which if used will be shown in the next available weekend slot.\n\nYou can also leave your comments below and don’t forget to follow us on Twitter.\n\nMORE : Games Inbox: Call Of Duty 2020 schedule, Uncharted 5 on PlayStation 5, and Dreams release date\n\nMORE : Games Inbox: PS5 release date delay, The Wonderful 101 on Xbox One, and GTA 6 inevitability\n\nMORE : Games Inbox: Final Fantasy 7 Remake episodes, Sonic movie chills, and Luigi’s Mansion 3 love"
