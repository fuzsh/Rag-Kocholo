Its by far Nintendo's most intense and cool, with the whole Aliens inspiration oozing from it. Also one of the most impactful, seeing how there werent any games like it before and birthing a whole genre.\n\nClose second is Mario , as platformers are my favorite genre.\n\nPSN: TijuanaTacoToker / Xbox:SmokeyTokey89 / NSO: Nuggetry\n\nhttps://www.backloggery.com/tijuanatacotoker\n\nSymphonicGlory 2 years ago#2\n\nUsed to be Pokemon followed by Metroid. Now it's reversed since Pokemon has declined so much over the last decade.\n\nSW-6172-7071-1642\n\nAlfredoJones 2 years ago#3\n\nAll of them have their positives such that it's hard for me to pick a favorite. It really just comes down to what I feel like playing at that moment. About the only one on that list that I can say I don't enjoy is Fire Emblem, though that's only because strategy games aren't really my thing.\n\nGot pasta on the brain!\n\nNintendo Switch Friend Code: SW-2960-9608-3596\n\nskier8390 2 years ago#4\n\nI love so many franchises so for me this comes down to replayability and in that sense Fire Emblem wins. I’ve played Mario Odyssey once for instance and have never felt the need to replay it. Three Houses on the other hand I’ve replayed at least 9-10 times and have over 200 hours in it. And I can’t even count the number of hours I’ve put into all the 3DS Fire Emvlem games.\n\nFire Emblem Echoes is an underrated 3DS game.\n\nSportsaholic 2 years ago#5\n\nZelda easily and then Metroid second.\n\nBuffalo Bills, Sabres, Bison, & Bandits, UB Bulls, Buffalo Braves/SD/LA Clippers, NY Yankees\n\nSwitch: 2611-7568-0218 | XBL: mbbrp | PSN: mbbrp\n\nStephenYap3 2 years ago#6\n\nMario for me. Even its most simplistic elements can be a lot of fun and Paper Mario 64 still happens to be my favorite video game of all time.\n\n\"Paper Mario needs a 'Sonic Mania' right now\", my feedback for Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling survey\n\nPlease be good, Fantasy Life i...!\n\nx_darkness_x666 2 years ago#7\n\nProbably Mario, but Zelda & Animal Crossing are a close tie for second. Also love me some Kirby, Metroid, Pokemon, & Donkey Kong.\n\nSwitch FC: SW-7457-0430-9710 New Horizons Island: Serenity\n\nDiscord: Clexxian#6757\n\nHyperonicX 2 years ago#8\n\nMetroid followed by Zelda.\n\nAfter the Pokemon DP remakes, I've been losing interest in the series, so I can't really classify that as number 3.\n\nMaybe Fire Emblem, but only the 3DS games onwards.\n\nCurrently playing: Pokemon Crystal (3DS), CP2077 (PC)\n\n2times 2 years ago#9\n\nFor me..\n\nMario > Zelda > Metroid > Fire Emblem > Donkey Kong >> F-Zero > Pokemon>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Animal Crossing.\n\ni CANNOT stand animal crossing.\n\nPSN: TwoTimes504 : Switch FC SW-6806-2698-6384 |\n\nCurrently playing: Tears of the Kingdom - Zelda | Persona 5 Royal | Luigi's Mansion3 | Metroid Prime Remastered"
