These are:\n\nMario\n\nDonkey Kong\n\nThe Legend of Zelda\n\nMetroid\n\nPokemon\n\nAnimal Crossing\n\nPikmin\n\nSplatoon\n\nWhy these franchises in particular? Could this give an indication of Nintendo's future projects? What else could this mean?\n\nIt’s very peculiar Nintendo would pick out these specific franchises to group together. Pokémon has never been developed in-house. Pikmin is clearly far less relevant than the other franchises. Donkey Kong hasn’t had a new release in ages. And the franchises that aren’t in this list raise further eyebrows: Wii Sports, Smash Bros., Kirby, Yoshi, Fire Emblem, and Xenoblade to name a few. It’ll be interesting to see how this list changes in the future, if at all.\n\nBlue Monty\n\nInkling\n\nPronouns\n\nhe/him\n\nApr 14, 2022\n\n#2\n\nMetroid is only big in USA\n\nPikmin only big in Japan\n\nWii Fit/Ring fit and Wii/Switch sports are bigger franchises than Metroid/Pikmin (and even Splatoon/DK)\n\nDonkey Kong is part of the Mario universe imo but alone I agree is top 6\n\nPokémon it’s not a ‘Nintendo’ IP in the sense of Nintendo promotional material it’s usually not mentioned is it’s own thing .\n\nMario is above all franchises honestly\n\nI think it’s Mario>>Zelda/Animal Crossing>Splatoon>DK\n\nApr 14, 2022\n\n#3\n\nOnly one that raises my eyebrow is Pikmin, is that really a \"household name\"?\n\nI would think many of the other franchises you mention in your OP have outsold it and have greater brand recognition.\n\nApr 14, 2022\n\n#4\n\ni feel like kirby is bigger than metroid and pikmin. both in sales and also in popularity as a general name even outside of gaming.\n\ndonkey kong maybe hasn't had the biggest games recently but is still a massively recognizable brand.\n\nCrusters\n\nKoopa\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/him\n\nApr 14, 2022\n\n#5\n\nFranchises?\n\n.....\n\n........\n\nFeel this is more brands.\n\nMazi: (Geeze, my phone REALLY wanted to auto'correct' your handle)\n\ni feel like kirby is bigger than both metroid and pikmin. both in sales and also in popularity as a general name even outside of gaming.\n\nThe first thought that came to mind was is Kirby still technically hal, but, well, Pokemons up there.\n\nLast edited: Apr 14, 2022\n\nApr 14, 2022\n\n#6\n\nIsn't Wii Sports bigger than Pikmin?

I'd replace it with Wii/Switch Sports, or even something like Xenoblade or Fire Emblem as a companion to Metroid (in that they're not huge sellers but they're big fan favorites).\n\nApr 14, 2022\n\n#13\n\nI wouldn't really read too much into this - it's a press release blurb of a few franchises they want to note, and outside of Pokémon, which is perhaps too big to ignore, they're all franchises created in-house. Kirby, Fire Emblem, and Xenoblade are notable exclusions, but they got stable homes with their dev teams and Nintendo pays all of them plenty of mind. If we're talking internal franchises minus Pokémon, yeah, this seems like this most prominent seven - Wii Sports is a massive game, but I wouldn't say is a marketable IP in the same way as any of the other listed franchises.\n\nAlso, the franchises in the blurb are listed in chronological order of release, assuming that \"Donkey Kong\" counts as both a Mario game and a DK game. That's pretty neat.\n\nMagic-Man\n\nPerseus Jackson\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nApr 14, 2022\n\n#14\n\nReplace Pikmin with Kirby and the list is correct.\n\nCrusters\n\nKoopa\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/him\n\nApr 14, 2022\n\n#15\n\nKirby’s exclusion is the weirdest, since it’s inarguably a bigger franchise than Pikmin and Metroid in basically every region (maybe it’s equivalent to Metroid in America but that’s it).\n\nIf not for Pokémon it would have seemed like just in-house IPs were included but that’s obviously not the case since Pokémon is there.\n\nThis is one of several reasons why using the word franchise just feels off and odd to me. This seems like they are talking more about brand power than franchise power..... Honestly that's the only way I can grok Metroid even being on the list.\n\nIt's one of those situations where 90% of the end results will be the same, but the things that are different, are really different.\n\nMetroid as a franchise, just doesn't have the sales to be on this list, even if it's been around since the 80's. Kirbys been around nearly as long, and has vastly higher number if entries, and sells as well if not better per entry.\n\nMetroid as a brand, has a LOT of power. That powers just a double edged sword right now. I know there are people in here, as everywhere with all manner of takes on the responses to games like other m and federation forces.\n\nBut I don't think you can mount much of an argument against those responses, however you feel about them, those responses to the brand were very powerful.\n\nI fully believe that If the brand is used right, marketed right, the game is right, that power can absolutely be united nearly unanimously in the pro direction, like a freaking bat signal.\n\nMetroid Dread may not be all the way there.... But it's definitely a viable proof of concept. A shape of things primed to come.\n\nI hope.\n\nNathan Little\n\nParatroopa\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/him\n\nApr 14, 2022\n\n#16\n\nI would replace Pikmin with Kirby, and I say that list is about right.\n\nSorry Pikmin.\n\nApr 14, 2022\n\n#17\n\ni feel like kirby is bigger than metroid and pikmin. both in sales and also in popularity as a general name even outside of gaming.\n\ndonkey kong maybe hasn't had the biggest games recently but is still a massively recognizable brand.\n\nThe character kirby yes. I could say 2d metroid sells a tad better than fire emblem but they re generally in the same range imo. Of course, the new kirby will elevate kirby considerably but its much more metroid than zelda for example\n\nApr 14, 2022\n\n#18\n\nPikmin seems pretty Jim Bob, but I'm glad they consider Metroid that important. Bodes well for its future.\n\nApr 14, 2022\n\n#19\n\nNintendo doesn’t wholly own Kirby, they share it with HAL.

Metroid gave its name to a genre, for example. These could also all be franchises which Nintendo sees as particularly important right now and in the near to medium term; Pikmin seems odd but it is the series they used for their latest mobile effort and it has a presence in their new merchandising.\n\nDK I'd guess is something we see get bigger investment in the next few years outside of the theme park. And, with Prime 4 and Dread, we're seeing Metroid get that investment too. One reason I like this potential interpretation is because it would mean new DK and new Pikmin are coming...\n\nI'd also agree with what others said about co-owned IP. Pokemon is too big to ignore, and Sports etc doesn't make for an easily marketable \"household name\" franchise.\n\nDunban\n\nRiki may well be the softest of all Nopon\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/him\n\nApr 14, 2022\n\n#21\n\nQuite surprised to see Pikmin there.

The store also carries a decently large selection of Kirby merch and some special Pokemon merch (plus there's a whole dedicated Pokemon Center store a few steps away anyway).\n\nSuper Nintendo World currently has the Mario Land completed in Japan, with Donkey Kong Land on the way. TPC have announced a partnership with Universal Studios for Pokemon content at the park, a Zelda Land is known to be in the cards for future expansion and Kirby was part of the initial pitch. The Mario segment of the park also has minor Pikmin cameos littered throughout.\n\nFinally, Sanei are Nintendo's go-to plush manufacturer (they have a Twitter account dedicated to their Nintendo products, cute profile banner below), so what characters and series are they currently working with? Mario, Donkey Kong, Zelda, Kirby, Animal Crossing, Splatoon, Pokemon, Pikmin and Fire Emblem.\n\nThat's five sources, five potential points for each IP. We'll say the minor roles Pikmin has at Super Nintendo World and Nintendo Store Tokyo only account for half a point each. What does the mascot of each series score?\n\nMario - 5/5\n\nLink- 5/5\n\nPikachu - 5/5\n\nIsabelle - 4/5\n\nInkling - 4/5\n\nKirby - 4/5\n\nDonkey Kong - 3/5\n\nPikmin - 3/5\n\n(Current FE Lord) - 2/5\n\nSamus - 1/5\n\nI think this assessment is totally fair! Those top 6 are what I would argue to be the top 6; but I think the other four IPs have earned their place as Nintendo mascots too.\n\nScrawnton\n\nT1D Gamer\n\nApr 14, 2022\n\n#28\n\nXenoblade needs to be added and either Pikmin or Metroid need removed for it.\n\nNow that I read all the posts in the thread; dump Metroid and Pikmin and add Xenoblade and Kirby.\n\nSirArthur\n\nStarman\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nApr 14, 2022\n\n#29\n\nIf they’re only discussing in-house Nintendo IPs (with Pokémon being the main exception due to how big it is), then I would swap Pikmin for Xenoblade.\n\nI agree. But maybe since the IP came from Monolith and not EPD then maybe thats why. Regardless, it should be there.\n\nD\n\nDeleted member 887\n\nGuest\n\nApr 14, 2022\n\n#30\n\n\"has created franchises that have become household names worldwide, including\" Nintendo isn't saying that these are their biggest franchises/IPs, they're saying \"these are some of our big IPs\".
