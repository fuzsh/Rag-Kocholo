Will something like that be in the game?\n\npokedude900 4 years ago#2\n\nThe original Animal Crossing was the only one that had these. They will never do it again because Nintendo wants you to buy from the Virtual Console/subscribe to Nintendo Online.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/lfI7zGE.jpg https://i.imgur.com/tgLNUuX.jpg\n\nCome to the (un)official GameFAQs Touhou board. http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/1110-\n\nmbowsher76 (Topic Creator)4 years ago#3\n\nWell that is dumb\n\n#4\n\n(message deleted)\n\nTouhou 4 years ago#5\n\nIIRC, aside from Punch Out, none of the games were that special or fun, anyway. They really did act like mini-games.\n\nFinally. A topic I claimed 500. https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/234547-super-smash-bros-ultimate/79727215\n\nYoumu, Yuuka, and Doremy are my favorite Touhous.\n\nMajor_Marth 4 years ago#6\n\nTouhou posted...\n\nIIRC, aside from Punch Out, none of the games were that special or fun, anyway. They really did act like mini-games.\n\nI always thought they were the full games. I remember being able to make decent progress in LoZ and Super Mario Bros.\n\nmy romantic side wanted a miracle boner, followed by a miracle recovery followed by stripper wedding Abnormal Ernie\n\npokedude900 4 years ago#7\n\nThey are the full games. He just means they felt like minigames because most of them were 1st generation NES games like Excite Bike and Balloon Fight. But then you've got some amazing ones like Wario's Woods.\n\nLoZ and SMB weren't available without hacking, btw.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/lfI7zGE.jpg https://i.imgur.com/tgLNUuX.jpg\n\nCome to the (un)official GameFAQs Touhou board. http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/1110-\n\nPkmTrainerAbram 4 years ago#8\n\nNew Leaf had a Planet Puzzle League and rpg-lite minigames, so, yeah, it wasn't just need ROMs.\n\nIt certainly can't hurt to patch these types of things in.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/abramj.broomiii/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/AbramJBroomIII"
