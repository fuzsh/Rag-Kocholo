        "text": "Highlights\n\nBalloon popping in Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a simple task but could use some excitement to make present gathering more engaging.\n\nAdding new gameplay mechanics like tougher balloons or special abilities could make shooting down presents more fun in the next title.\n\nNintendo should consider expanding present gathering options to include underground, fishing, tree drops, and mini-games for a more lively experience.\n\nWhile nothing has been officially announced yet, based on the success of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, another chapter of this relaxing franchise is no doubt on the horizon. And with a new title, Nintendo will likely want to spruce things up considerably with new gameplay mechanics, a whole new style, and dozens of new things for players to discover. Even though there are plenty of areas that the studio could improve in the next Animal Crossing, there is one simple side activity that definitely needs to be spiced up a bit.\n\nAs players do their daily tasks in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, they will occasionally be greeted by a balloon carrying a present. After they shoot it down, they are given whatever the present holds, which is usually some type of furniture or clothing item. This can be a fun way to earn new cosmetic items while simply playing the game, but it also leaves much to be desired. It does not have to be the most advanced mini-game in the world, yet it could benefit from something more.\n\nAnimal Crossing's Present Hunting Needs to be Injected With Some Life\n\nThe Balloon Popping Could Be Spruced Up a Bit\n\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with Animal Crossing: New Horizon's balloon popping, as it is an extremely simple and relaxing task. That said, some players may be looking for a more exciting way to gather mysterious presents. And while there is likely room for new present gathering mini-games, the balloon popping could simply get a bit of a facelift in the next title.\n\nInstead of being a random side activity in New Horizons, these balloons could require players to put more effort into shooting them down. Maybe they need to spend more time aiming, maybe some of the balloons are fake, or maybe more than one balloon is carrying some presents. Additionally, there may be varying balloon sizes that require stronger ranged attacks to take down or even balloons that have special wild abilities that make hitting them a bit harder. While Nintendo would have to balance these additions so that they are still fun to shoot down, it could make things a lot more engaging and unique if done well.\n\nOther Present Hunting Activities May Also Help the Game Shine\n\nImproving the balloon popping could go a long way in making present gathering more fun, but if Nintendo wants to take it even further, then it could expand the gathering options considerably. These presents could be hidden underground, they could come from fishing, they could wash up on the beach, they could fall from trees, or they could come from brand-new mini-games like slot machines or the classic shell game. No matter where they come from, having more options would spruce up Animal Crossing considerably.\n\nNot only should presents be obtained in more ways, but they should also contain even more exciting and unique items. They should still be filled to the brim with furniture and clothing, with even more pieces being introduced to the pool.\n\nHowever, along with that, the presents could include items themed after other Nintendo games, villager-exclusive items, house designs, and maybe even a series of collectibles that build to something greater."
