        "text": "Technobubble covers games, gadgets, technology and all things geek. Follow Technobubble poobah Jason Hidalgo's shenanigans on Twitter @jasonhidalgo\n\nI love, love Animal Crossing. I mean, I seriously adore it.\n\nCase in point, I'm terrible with Villager in Super Smash Bros. for the Wii U or 3DS and I still use the character despite knowing I'll likely be on the receiving end of a serious shellacking. Gotta represent Animal Crossing, man.\n\nNaturally, when I heard that the franchise was going to get a Wii U spinoff game, I was delighted. Yes, it's not a main line Animal Crossing game but that was the case with Happy Home Designer for the 3DS and that actually turned out to be quite fun. So a Mario Party-style board game with mini-games set in the Animal Crossing universe? Sign me up, dood.\n\nBy the way, the first time I fired up the game, I may or may not have squealed like a little girl upon seeing Animal Crossing characters and environs rendered with console-quality graphics. There stood Isabelle and the rest of the cast in all their adorable splendor. Just imagine if Nintendo decides to do a bonafide Animal Crossing game at some point! So far so good.\n\nOnce I started playing, however, the sheen started to slowly wear off. The game certainly looks like Animal Crossing and even quacked like it at first thanks to a multitude of charming touches such as little mini-stories that popped up when I landed on certain squares. While Animal Crossing games typically had plenty of stuff for you to do, however, that wasn't the case with Amiibo Festival's board game. There were no mini-games a la Mario Party during the actual board game segments, for example. All in all, there was just a surprising lack of things to do besides spinning the dice and going around the board to collect currency and happiness points.\n\nThe lack of interaction is compounded by the method you use to spin your dice. Playing multiplayer basically involves passing the Wii U tablet around like a hot potato so players can spin the dice by constantly placing their amiibo figurines on the sensor, which feels forced and cumbersome.\n\nI did like some of the game's mechanics, such as the stock market-style take on buying and selling turnips. See, the market can swing from great to Enron-like each week or even by day so players take a risk when buying those turnips every Sunday (one turn represents one day in Amiibo Festival, with a full game lasting a whole month). If your gamble works out, you could turn the tide and come from behind in the money race by landing on a square with a great turnip sell price. On the flipside, you can lose your lead and tumble down the bottom of the pack if you buy a ton and the market crashes with prices far less than what you paid for.\n\nThe game also adds events such as fishing day and special guest characters like a fortune teller that can provide bonuses for certain dice rolls or even a trader that can give you some cool cards let you move a certain number of steps or change tile effects. Those things, however, don't add enough interaction. It's basically like watching a game play itself for you at times.\n\nThe game does a bit better with the mini-games, which at least requires you to interact. The quiz show, for example, is good as is Desert Island Escape. I just wish there were more of them and that they were integrated into the board game somehow. The mini-games also require using amiibo cards for the most part, but the implementation can be cumbersome at times.\n\nThe included amiibo, on the other hand, is a totally different story. The bundle comes with three amiibo cards as well as amiibo figures for Digby and — squeal! — Isabelle that's just gosh darn adorable. I'd rate Digby a 4.5 out of 5. Meanwhile, the Isabelle figure gets a 5 out of 5 for me and now joins 30th Anniversary Mario and Yarn Yoshi as my favorite amiibos because, well, it's freaking Isabelle. When you factor in the cost of the amiibos to the price of the total package, then it makes sense that the actual game feels more like a budget title.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nAnimal Crossing Amiibo Festival is a spinoff title that features plenty of the charm and cuteness the franchise is known for but lacks the depth of other games in the series. Although the production values are great, the gameplay for the main mode is a bit on the shallow side and the amiibo figure and card integration also can be a bit cumbersome. It's ideal for young kids and family-friendly gaming but likely won't hold the interest of older gamers for extended play. The includes amiibo figures, on the other hand, are freaking awesome. I'd actually get this for those two amiibos alone."
