        "text": "I have always associated the Animal Crossing series with comfort and calm. I became a fan of the series in middle school. I would spend many hours perched on the ottoman in our living room after school playing Animal Crossing: City Folk on my Wii. In those days, it was a fun and simple world to escape to, a world where the worst thing that could happen to you was missing out on a rare bug or fish, or a favorite villager moving away.\n\nThen, in high school, New Leaf came along. Again, it acted as an escape during a time of great stress and change for me. Even as my responsibilities grew, the things I was in charge of in New Leaf were always the same. Being the mayor of a small town was a simple and fun task, a welcome relief from the stress of high school.\n\nIt seems this franchise has always come to me at the right time, providing a comforting and delightful world to escape to. And the newest installment, New Horizons, has continued the pattern.\n\nI got the game on its release date and played it as soon as I could – around midnight last Friday. As such, I’ve had the game for a little over a week now, and have played it quite extensively every single day since I’ve started. Regardless, I have the feeling I’ve only scratched the surface of the features available in this game!\n\nAs usual, Animal Crossing is a series with a lot to discover, and moves at a fairly slow pace (two things I will touch on in more detail in the review) so my opinions so far are only based on what I’ve seen! It’s possible I might return with more thoughts as I continue my island adventure, but I thought I’d share a bit about my experience in the game so far if you’re on the fence on whether or not to pick up this game yourself. Or if you just like to hear my opinion! Either way, let’s talk New Horizons.\n\nMy first impression of New Horizons was awe at its graphics. Of course, being on the Switch enables this game to have better graphics than any game before it, and they’ve really delivered. Everything is so beautiful and shiny-looking. The grass and trees achieve a perfect balance of natural and stylized, and its aesthetic is overall such a triumph. It provides a fresh new look at the Animal Crossing aesthetic without travelling so far away that it’s unfamiliar.\n\nAnd so many of the buildings have really experienced a glow-up in this game. Particularly notable is the Town Hall and the museum. Ohhhh the museum. It’s so detailed, so beautiful, and endlessly fun to explore. Huge props to the designers behind that beautiful, beautiful building.\n\nThe process of choosing my island was pretty fun. I was hell-bent on getting an island with peaches, and didn’t really care much about anything else. Thankfully, it only took one reset to get my beloved peaches, and after that I was pleased with the natural beauty of my new island, Blue Lace.\n\nAlso in the beginning worth mentioning, though, is the character creator. Much has been made of the gender neutral character creator, and lots of people smarter and more knowledgable than me have talked about it, so I’ll keep this brief. I think this game has really struck a perfect balance of gender inclusion.\n\nYou still get the option to pick a more “masculine” or “feminine” character, but that really affects nothing besides the style of the randomly generated character you then get to edit however you like. (I assume in other languages this also changes which gendered language the character experiences, but in English your character is almost never referred to with gendered pronouns, so this choice affects essentially nothing.) Then, you get the option to customize your character with the same hairstyles and face as anyone else, with no gender restrictions.\n\nIt doesn’t really need to be said, but this change is welcome. The previous installment, New Leaf, played a bit with gender-neutrality, allowing characters of either gender the same access to all clothing, but face and hairstyles were still restricted by gender. This was nice, but honestly giving everyone the same options regardless of the gender they pick at the start of the game is so much better, allows for more customization freedom, and is more inclusive of all players. It can only be a good change.\n\nOn a less gender-related note, getting a character creator at the beginning of the game at all is new for the series, and I absolutely love the flexibility it gave. I spent a lot less time at the beginning of this game being annoyed with the appearance of my character because I got the chance to change it to my liking immediately, with options only growing more and more numerous as the game went on.\n\nI will say one possible weakness of this game is it’s pretty slow to start. This isn’t terribly unusual for this series – previous installments usually asked players to wait a day or two for some important features to open up – but it’s pretty dramatic in this game when you literally start on a deserted island with nothing but a few tents and crudely-built tools to protect you.\n\nI think this is easier on Animal Crossing veterans, who are used to spending slow days in the game mostly catching bugs, fishing, shaking fruit off trees. For newbies, this might be a bit startling. Of course, there’s always time-travelling (moving forward your Switch’s clock to make time in-game move artificially forward), which, in this game, isn’t really punished in the same way it was in previous games. So, if the slow pace is too much for you, you can easily move forward.\n\nYou begin the game with only two villagers, and I started with Mira and Sterling. I don’t mind either of these villagers – they kind of have a cute cosplayer vibe going on – but neither will likely be staying.\n\nThe villagers in this game are so much more lively and have so many more ways to interact not just with your character but also with the world around them. Sometimes I find my villagers exercising, watering flowers, singing and dancing, or just reacting to events around them. It adds a whole new level of personality to characters that can sometimes come off as samey or flat in previous games, considering the limited personality and dialogue options they have.\n\nIt also appears that villagers can interact with each other! A few days back, I found one of my new villagers, Paolo, steaming angry. Upon talking to him I discovered he and Mira were arguing. Later that day, I found the two of them singing together, so I imagine they made up. These little touches add so many unexpected moments of fun to the game that feel so true to this series.\n\nAnother big new feature and aspect of this game is the huge amount of customization options exist for the island itself. For the first time in Animal Crossing History, we are able to put furniture items all over the island, not just inside our houses. This vastly expands the possibilities for decorating and developing the community, and puts way more control into the player’s hands. It provides a similar opportunity for creating public spaces as the Public Works project feature in New Leaf, but with vastly more flexibility and accessibility for players.\n\nIt’s so awesome to be able to make little spaces throughout my town. For example, when my campground was built I was able to put furniture items – like a lantern, a bonfire, seating, and recreational activities – around it to make it look like a real camp site. I put a water fountain in the center of my town for my villagers to drink from. I’m creating a little bamboo garden in the corner of my island with seating areas! There’s so many possibilities with this new feature.\n\nI also really enjoyed how some parts of the game require the player to place certain furniture items outside incoming villager’s houses to help “prepare” them for their arrival. It’s a fun little way to integrate this new ability into previous features of the game.\n\nNook Miles is a huge feature added, one I really love. To some extent, small quests with rewards were present in the Welcome amiibo update of New Leaf, but Nook Miles is far more all-encompassing, rewarding players for doing short-term tasks around their islands and for more long-term goals, like catching a certain number of bugs or fish or reaching certain milestones. It’s another wonderful incentive to keep playing that helps the slow pace somewhat – if you’re not sure what to do, it’s never a bad idea to knock out a few of the Nook Miles quests.\n\nThe other big feature added to the game is crafting. Your island is full of natural resources that your character can harvest and use to build tools, furniture, and other items. The collection of materials adds another daily task to the player’s to-do list. This might not sound like a good thing, but in a game as focused on daily upkeep and routine as Animal Crossing, it adds more layers of gameplay and makes certain steps to progression a bit more challenging.\n\nIt also adds to the new tool breakage feature. Where, in the past, all tools (except axes) were indestructible, the tools in New Horizon have a limited number of uses before they break. Though I was at first a little annoyed by this feature, it does make sense alongside crafting and harvestable resources. Also, as the player gains the ability to make better tools, it becomes less of a pain.\n\nAlso nice is the fact that nets and fishing rods aren’t less effective in their “flimsy” forms, just less durable, meaning no rare bugs or fish are off limits, no matter what kind of tool you have.\n\nPlus, the crafting table is a furniture item, meaning you can simply carry it with you if it’s too much of a hassle to have to go back to a stationary crafting table each time your tool breaks. You can just plop your table down wherever and use it on the spot.\n\nThese features do somewhat expose a flaw in inventory space. Animal Crossing has always had limited inventory space as a major drawback to carrying too many items, but it’s extra noticeable now that there’s more tools and more crafting materials the player will often be carrying with them. This is offset somewhat when the player progresses enough to expand their inventory, but it is somewhat of a hassle.\n\nAnother side effect of the need for resources is the need for a never-ending supply of these resources. Though your own island is initially the best place to gather wood, stone, iron and more raw materials, as you develop the land it becomes more and more necessary to have an undeveloped area to gather more. In comes the Nook Miles tickets, which you can use to fly to unlimited small deserted islands.\n\nThe fun thing about these islands is you can rarely find special ones. There’s one shaped like a shark fin that only spawns sharks in the ocean around it. Another sports a beautiful selection of hybrid flowers, which you ordinarily can’t get unless you breed normal flowers. And of course, there is the feared and respected tarantula island – a pit of death that only spawns tarantulas. (Bad for the heart but great for the wallet; those terrifying suckers sell for 8,000 a pop.)\n\nI haven’t found any of these special islands myself, but they become almost a gambling-like mechanic. You gamble a few Nook Miles on a ticket, and you might get a special island that makes you a ton of bells… or you’ll just end up with the same boring common island with your native fruit and pansies, for some reason. Either way, it’s fun and adds a dimension of variety to the game it might otherwise lack.\n\nFinally, as always, the cast of non-playable characters is charming and memorable. Old favorites like Tom Nook, Timmy, Tommy, Blathers, the Able Sisters, and Isabelle make appearances, as do some new characters. I haven’t actually met any of the new NPCs in my game (except for Daisy Mae, the adorable granddaughter of Joan, the boar previously responsible for selling turnips to the player every Sunday), but from what I’ve seen on Twitter, they are full of personality and life. The characters are one of my favorite parts of this game, and I really like the cast that has made it into this one. (Though I will dearly miss my beloved Cyrus and Reese, as well as Kapp’n.)\n\nI also can’t possibly wrap up my review without touching a bit on the timing of this game’s release. Though obviously not planned, New Horizons released in the middle of a worldwide crisis that has kept many people, myself included, holed up in their homes. The monotony of daily life being mostly unable to go anywhere or see anyone besides my immediate family in person has been really hard, but having this game has helped immensely.\n\nThough New Horizons, I’ve been able to spend time with friends. I’ve been able to travel, able to experience new things and meet new friends, real or not real, and it’s been amazing. It’s a calm and gentle escape from a scary and uncertain world, and I’m deeply thankful for it. I would have loved the game either way, but it’s extra meaningful that, like all of its predecessors, this game has found me exactly where and when I needed it most."
