        "text": "Animal Crossing New Leaf is a wonderful game and is not for everyone! New Horizons is much more modern and entertaining, you have most likely heard about the whole “AC is not for everyone” before and this is why. If you truly love what makes AC original than it will get better! However, you say you dont care about the characters or villagers which is half of the fun! There are various other non social aspects that make ACNL great! The beginning is much slower, especially coming straight from New Horizons.\n\nSome things that happen and are enjoyable are… (bolded are not in NH)\n\nSlowly building up your town with PWP’s and changing ordinances after finishing the permit.\n\nUpgrading all the shops on Main Street (took me 3 years)\n\nGetting all the golden tools.\n\nFinishing the Museum.\n\nGetting all the golden badges.\n\nCompleting the encyclopedia.\n\nCollecting the many different fruits.\n\nVisiting the Island and collecting medals to get stuff from the gift shop.\n\nMaking friends with each villager and fulfilling 3-5 requests daily. (Catching fish / bugs, buying them furniture, bringing fruit, visiting homes etc.)\n\nSaving up MEOW coupons to buy things from the campsite. ️\n\nGetting exercise IRL to obtain playcoins to buy fortune cookies.\n\nObtaining an in-game 3DS or Wii U to play Puzzle League and Desert Island escape respectively.\n\nCheck for Plaza visitors when visiting your town tree to see it grow as the months pass!\n\nYou've barely scratched the surface of New Leaf if you've only played for 3 days. Even New Horizons is slow in the first few days. Timmy and Tommy expand their shop numerous times the more you buy and sell from them, including eventually getting a deluxe Gracie section on the top floor with expensive seasonal furniture sets and clothing. More shops unlock on Main Street as you play.\n\nMr_Keroppi covered a lot of it. You can also do stuff like catch expensive beetles and sharks on Tortimer Island to take back to town to sell, play minigames on Tortimer Island to acquire things (like exclusive furniture, clothing, and wetsuits), work at The Roost, and get stuff customized by Cyrus at Re-Tail. Cyrus can even make miniatures of dinosaurs if you have their full set of fossils. He'll be asleep until you progress in the game more though.\n\nAlso, as Gabby touched on, if you go in expecting to design the town like you do in New Horizons then you're not going to get that. Public Works Projects can be installed around the town but most of the decorating is interior decoration within your home. The rooms of your home can be expanded larger than the ones in New Horizons. The exterior of your home can be customized a bit more than in New Horizons, and you can customize the exteriors of the Train Station and Town Hall as well.\n\nThere are a bunch of furniture sets and other items that didn't make the jump to New Horizons and there are a bunch of classic gyroids that weren't included in New Horizons as well.\n\nEven if you don't care about the characters, it still can be a fun game for you since I'm more into the series for interior decorating. While New Horizons has some improvements, some pretty big, New Leaf is still my personal favorite just for the interior decoration aspect. If not having terraforming and lacking the ability to place furniture outside is a dealbreaker though, can't help ya. Like Gabby was saying, it depends on what you liked about New Horizons and what you expect."
