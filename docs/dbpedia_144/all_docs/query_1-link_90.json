        "text": "Even after the New Horizons boom, I think The Sims is the larger franchise. The series has undoubtedly experienced its ups and downs, but you cannot ignore how quickly it became a phenomenon with just the original release on PC.\n\nAnimal Crossing was comparatively much more niche, especially since it was limited to only the GameCube. The Sims would rapidly have one (or more) versions on the Mac, PC, as well as all mainstream game consoles by the time Wild World launched on DS in 2005.\n\nAnimal Crossing seems to be more popular in the cultural zeitgeist now.\n\nDon't really care about sales. By that metric, Angry Birds is more popular than Fortnite and Minecraft.\n\nWhat cultural zeitgeist? What has been the conversation about AC the last two years besides \"remember how well it sold the during the pandemic, and mostly only during the pandemic\". I mean, Sims ain't trending on Twitter, but this place doesn't really run in those circles. People mention sales, but they also mention consistent updates and support, modding scenes (hell, there's a whole conversation about improving racial diversity through mods in Sims through more hair options and that's being said without even touching where Animal Crossing was at in terms of diversity last decade), criticisms about the game and so on.\n\nIt is what it is, I've just never seen people double down on getting such slam dunk easy question wrong. I don't hear about PUBG, but I'm not gonna argue people aren't playing and streaming it and that it's not still one of the most popular shooters. Same with League of Legends and MOBAs.\n\nWhat cultural zeitgeist? What has been the conversation about AC the last two years besides \"remember how well it sold the during the pandemic, and mostly only during the pandemic\"\n\nThat sales bit is Only by people who are either desperately wanting that to be true or deliberately ignorant. Animal crossing routinely has been the second best selling leggy title from Nintendo in quarterly updates only behind mario kart, outperforming things like smash, 3d mario, Pokémon and botw outside of the quarter totk released. It dropped to 3rd place in literally the last update we had, smash had a bit of a resurgence with he update about Sora apparently, but anyone who claims it stopped selling is factually wrong.\n\nUpdated sales numbers for Switch titles: Pikmin 4 (2.61M), Tears of the Kingdom (19.50M), and more\n\nhttps://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2023/231107_4e.pdf https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html updated sales numbers as of September 30, 2023 (+sales in the last quarter): Mario Kart 8 Deluxe - 57.01M (+1.55M) Animal Crossing: New Horizons - 43.38M (+590K) Super Smash Bros...\n\nOnly by people who are either desperately wanting that to be true or deliberately ignorant.

You will struggle to find anyone even just a teeny tiny familiar with games who doesn't know that The Sims is, even if they've been out of the loop with gaming for ages.\n\nSpeaking of which, is there a way to (legally) play The Sims 1 on modern systems without a physical copy? Last I checked it wasn't available on any digital stores but I'd really like to revisit it.\n\nSadly no, don't think TS1 has ever been released digitally even. Only TS3 and TS4 are easily available to buy digitally. EA is awful at supporting anything before TS4 unfortunately.\n\nThe Sims is a significantly bigger series by a large margin but I feel like they've fumbled the bag in recent years.\n\nMeanwhile, you can walk into any Target or Walmart and you'll see Animal Crossing merch/toys/plushies/etc.\n\nAnimal Crossing is unquestionably growing bigger among kids nowadays due to AC's brand recognition but the Sims name still carries a LOT of weight in a way I think a lot of people underestimate. There hasn't been a full new numbered Sims game since the rise of the \"cozy game\" genre.\n\nWhenever the Sims 5 releases, I fully expect a Fortnite level boom in popularity again. There just hasn't been a full new game since 2014 and Animal Crossing had the benefit of 2020.\n\nThe Sims and I don't think it's even close, even post New Horizons.

Only TS3 and TS4 are easily available to buy digitally. EA is awful at supporting anything before TS4 unfortunately.\n\nDamn. Is it legal to \"pirate\" a copy if I own an original physical box/disc, but don't want to open it? I mean, I know emulation is, but not sure if the same applies to PC native games.\n\nI see the sims shit everywhere, but AC was huge during quarantine.\n\nThe Sims, AC was huge during the pandemic but I feel it mostly remained \"inside\" the regular gaming space( people that play other games, gaming enthusiasts, gaming forums and gaming youtube channels) once that moment in time passed.\n\nThe Sims is popular even amongst people that do not usually play videogames, there are people that play no other videogames except The Sims and this has been a thing for a long time. The sims community seems kinda \"insular\" in that regard.\n\nThe sims to me it's kinda like COD and FIFA were it can do great and be super popular regardless of the discussion(or word of mouth) on the usual gaming spaces, and it does super well regardless if it gets talked about in the broader gaming sphere or not.\n\nThe Nintendo or Nintendo adjecent franchise that feels most similar to it to me it's Pokemon(even though I think Pokemon is more popular overall).\n\nThat sales bit is Only by people who are either desperately wanting that to be true or deliberately ignorant.

Excluding pack-ins, it's the second best-selling platform exclusive of all-time, trailing only Mario Kart 8. It's sold almost double the best-selling Sony game of all-time, despite Sony's aggressive price cutting strategy. It's sold dramatically more than The Sims did even at the height of its popularity.\n\nGiven the timing of its release, it's fair to be skeptical of whether future entries will sustain that level of success. But it's been on this trajectory for a while, growing in popularity with each main installment. Even New Leaf, which was locked to a platform with an install base of around 80 million, sold 13 million copies (which, as far as I can tell, is better than any individual release in The Sims franchise outside of the original game, which sold a few million more) and was one of the best selling titles on the 3DS.\n\nThe Sims, AC was huge during the pandemic but I feel it mostly remained \"inside\" the regular gaming space( people that play other games, gaming enthusiasts, gaming forums and gaming youtube channels) once that moment in time passed.\n\nThe Sims is popular even amongst people that do not usually play videogames, there are people that play no other videogames except The Sims and this has been a thing for a long time.

It's the most valuable entertainment IP in the entire world."
