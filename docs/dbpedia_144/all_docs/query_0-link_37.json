        "text": "History of Nintendo Worldwide 1980-1990\n\n1980\n\nThe company created a wholly owned subsidiary, Nintendo of America Inc. in New York. Nintendo began selling the \"GAME & WATCH\" product line in Japan, the first portable LCD videogames with a microprocessor.\n\nNintendo artist Shigeru Miyamoto created the game Donkey Kong. The hero, originally called Jumpman, is a carpenter racing to save his girlfriend, Pauline, from a crazed ape. Jumpman was later renamed during the establishment of Nintendo of America's headquarters by Nintendo Co., Ltd. In honour of Jumpman's resemblance to their office landlord, Mario Segali, he was later renamed 'Mario'.\n\n1981\n\nNintendo developed and distributed the coin-operated video game \"Donkey Kong.\" This video game quickly became the hottest-selling individual coin-operated machine in the business.\n\n1983\n\nThe company built a new plant in Uji City to increase production capacity and to allow for business expansion. In July, Nintendo listed stock on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange and started work on the home videogame console \"Family Computer\" (Famicom), employing a custom CPU (Custom Processing Unit) and PPU (Picture Processing Unit).\n\n1984\n\nNintendo developed and started selling the unique, twin-screen interactive coin-operated videogame \"VS. System\". At the same time, the company launched the Famicom system in Japan, later renamed Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) when it launched worldwide. Stellar software titles were developed one after another, from Excitebike, Super Mario Bros. and Metroid to The Legend of Zelda and Punch-Out! From these titles, it was Super Mario Bros. that quickly became a smash hit around the world. Studies at the time showed that children were as or more familiar with Mario as they were with Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny.\n\n1986\n\nThe Nintendo Entertainment System was launched in Europe and instantly became a major hit and a must-have in homes across the continent. Nintendo developed and began selling the \"Family Computer Disk Drive System\" in Japan to expand the functions of the Famicom. Also in Japan, the company began installation of the \"Disk Writer\" to rewrite game software.\n\n1987\n\nNintendo sponsored a Famicom \"Golf Tournament\" in Japan as a communications test using the public telephone network and Disk Faxes to aid in building a Famicom network.\n\n1988\n\nThe company researched and developed the Hands Free controller, making the NES accessible to even more Nintendo fans. The game library for the NES grew to 65 titles, helping to broaden the system's appeal to include more adults.\n\n1989\n\nThe Game Boy, the first portable, handheld game system with interchangeable game cartridges, is introduced in Japan along with Tetris.\n\n1990\n\nJapan entered the 16-bit market by releasing the Super Famicom in the autumn. Game Boy was launched in Europe and established what would become an astronomical worldwide installed base for the Nintendo handheld console.\n\nIn June, Nintendo of Europe was set up as a wholly owned subsidiary of Nintendo, based in Grossostheim, Germany.\n\nHistory of Nintendo Worldwide 1991 - present\n\n1992\n\nThe Super Nintendo Entertainment System (Super Famicom) was launched in Europe in June. The console went on to sell more than 46 million units worldwide. Japan saw the release of the Super NES Super Scope and Mario Paint with the Super NES Mouse Accessory. The long-awaited Zelda sequel, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, also arrived for the Super NES.\n\n1993\n\nThe Super FX Chip was announced: a breakthrough technology for home video systems. The first game using the Super FX Chip, Star Wing, was released in April.\n\nNintendo of the Netherlands was established and Nintendo products, which had previously been distributed and managed by Bandai in the Netherlands, were handed over. Other subsidiaries were also established in France, UK, Spain, Belgium and Australia.\n\n1994\n\nThe Super Game Boy accessory was released, expanding the library of games that could now be played on the Super NES. Nintendo helped pioneer the development and implementation of an industry-wide rating system in the United States. This year also saw the introduction of a game that would set a new standard in video game excellence - using proprietary Advanced Computer Modeling (ACM) graphics, Donkey Kong Country took the US holiday season by storm.\n\nThe Nintendo Gateway was launched, putting Super Nintendo units and a selection of SNES games into commercial planes for the enjoyment of passengers.\n\n1995\n\nThanks to the success of Donkey Kong Country, ACM graphics were introduced to the Game Boy system by way of Donkey Kong Land. Along with this boost to the Game Boy system line, Nintendo also introduced the Play It Loud! series of Game Boy systems with colour casings. ACM graphics made another appearance on the Super NES with the release of the arcade smash-hit, Killer Instinct. In Japan, Nintendo began selling the SatellaView adapter for Super Famicom, enabling the system to receive digital data from a broadcast satellite. At the same time, Nintendo introduced a 32-bit Virtual Immersion system known as the Virtual Boy.\n\nNintendo enhanced the quality of ACM graphics for the upcoming release of Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest and released Cruis'n USA and Killer Instinct in arcades.\n\nNintendo produced its one billionth game cartridge.\n\n1996\n\nNintendo 64 launched in Japan on 23 June. Thousands lined up to be the first to experience the world's first 64-bit home videogame system. More than 500,000 systems were sold on the first day. Another system launch occurred in early September when Nintendo introduced the Game Boy Pocket, a sleeker, 30-percent-smaller version of the world's most popular handheld.\n\nSuper Mario 64 was proclaimed by many as \"the greatest video game of all time.\" Meanwhile, the Super NES saw the release of the third game in the continuing Donkey Kong series, Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble. Pok√©mon, a new gaming phenomenon on the Game Boy, was released in Japan on 26 February.\n\n1997\n\nIn March, Nintendo 64 launched in Europe and sold 2.3 million in the first year. Nintendo introduced the Rumble Pak, which enabled players to feel the realistic vibrations contained in the game.\n\n1998\n\nNintendo introduced Game Boy Color and the innovative devices Game Boy Camera and Printer, bringing new life to the longest-running hit in the history of interactive entertainment. Game Boy Color systems were cased in two brand-new colours: purple and clear purple.\n\nThe highly anticipated The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time for Nintendo 64 was released, setting new standards and breaking pre-order records for any videogame to date.\n\n1999\n\nNintendo released Pok√©mon throughout Europe on 8 October. Nintendo expanded the library of high-quality software with innovative titles such as Pok√©mon Snap and Pok√©mon Pinball, the latter including a built-in rumble feature. Hits such as Mario Golf, Donkey Kong 64 and Perfect Dark were launched. Also, during the summer, the range of Game Boy Color coloured casings expanded with red, green, yellow and blue added to the collection.\n\nNintendo first announced plans for a new system utilising an IBM Gekko Processor and Matsushita's Unique DVD Technology.\n\n2000\n\nThe Nintendo Game Boy became the most popular selling console ever as sales surpassed 100 million. Meanwhile, the Pok√©mon franchise continued to be a worldwide phenomenon, and Nintendo celebrated its success with a limited edition release of Pikachu Nintendo 64. The N64 expanded its library of classics with hits such as The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, Ridge Racer 64 and Mario Tennis.\n\nThe Nintendo of the Netherlands office became responsible for both Belgium and the Netherlands market and changed its name to Nintendo Benelux. Meanwhile, the headquarters of Nintendo Co., Ltd were relocated to Minami-ward of Kyoto, Japan.\n\n2001\n\nNintendo UK was established in January, and a new office opened in Slough, Berkshire, UK. Pok√©mon Gold and Silver for Game Boy Color were simultaneously and successfully launched in Europe on 6 April, 2001. Over its launch weekend, one million units of Pok√©mon Gold and Silver were sold, making it the fastest selling game ever in Europe. Game Boy Advance launched on 21 March in Japan, 11 June in US and 22 June across Europe. It set the mark as the fastest selling console ever with 500,000 units being sold within the first week in Europe. Game Boy Advance launch successes included first-party favourites such as Super Mario Advance and F-Zero: Maximum Velocity.\n\nNintendo GameCube was launched on 14 September, 2001 in Japan and 18 November, 2001 in America. In all, 2.7 million units were shipped by December, of which 95% sold through. The sales success of Luigi's Mansion and Super Smash Bros. Melee marked both popular games as flagship titles for the console.\n\nGame Boy Advance e-Reader hardware launched in Japan on 1 December and brought a new meaning to portable gameplay. Different game information stored on e-Reader cards could be swiped through the e-Reader and transferred onto the Game Boy Advance.\n\n2002\n\nNintendo Italia was established on 2 January and opened an office in Milan. Game Boy Advance - now available in new Black and Platinum editions - smashed the 5 million hardware units barrier across Europe. Pok√©mon mini, the world's smallest console, was launched on 15 March across Europe with four titles, including Pok√©mon mini Party and Pok√©mon mini Pinball.\n\nNintendo, Sega and Namco announced joint development of 3D computer graphic board \"TRIFORCE\" on 22 February for next generation arcade machines. Nintendo GameCube launched in Europe on 3 May with 1 million units, a recommended retail price of ‚Ç¨199 and 20 launch titles. Since that time, it's been joined on the shelves by spectacular new Mario adventure Super Mario Sunshine, revolutionary wireless controller Nintendo WaveBird, and over 100 titles of every genre and description.\n\nAt the end of May, after 52 years at the helm of the company, Nintendo Co., Ltd, President Hiroshi Yamauchi announced his retirement, naming Satoru Iwata as his successor. By the end of 2002, more than 25 million Game Boy Advance units were in homes around the world.\n\n2003\n\nIn March, the Game Boy Advance SP was released, building on the massive success of the Game Boy Advance by adding a smart clam-shell design. The new system was an instant success.\n\nMarch also saw the release of the stunning Metroid Prime, hailed by fans and critics alike as one of the best games for Nintendo GameCube. In May, to celebrate the first birthday of Nintendo GameCube, the eagerly awaited The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker arrived, bringing one of Nintendo's flagship characters to the system in striking, cel-shaded style.\n\nIn June, the release of the Game Boy Player for Nintendo GameCube meant that gamers could experience Game Boy and Game Boy Advance titles on their television sets. With the release of Pok√©mon Ruby and Sapphire in July, the Pok√©mon phenomenon erupted for the first time on Game Boy Advance.\n\nOctober saw the return of a well-loved franchise in the form of Mario Kart: Double Dash!! for Nintendo GameCube.\n\n2004\n\nJanuary saw the worldwide announcement of Nintendo's ‚Äòmystery system‚Äô: the Nintendo DS, a dual-screened handheld with Touch Screen technology.\n\nIn the autumn, Pok√©mon FireRed and LeafGreen are launched for Game Boy Advance, continuing the success of the Pok√©mon phenomenon.\n\n2004 also saw the arrival of many different special editions of the Game Boy Advance: Tribal Edition (June), Classic NES Edition (July), Limited Pink Edition (October), Zelda Limited Edition (November) and Mario Limited Edition (November) were all released across Europe.\n\nToward the end of the year, the Nintendo DS was released in the US and Japan to immediate success. The new dual-screened system also featured wireless multiplayer, Touch Screen technology and backward compatibility with Game Boy Advance titles.\n\n2005\n\nOn 11 March, the Nintendo DS was launched in Europe to immediate success. By June the system had sold a million units throughout Europe.\n\nMeanwhile, Nintendo introduced the Game Boy Micro. Measuring just 4 inches wide by 2 inches tall, the ultra-stylish Game Boy Micro featured a backlit screen.\n\n2006\n\nIn 2006, Nintendo DS rose to the top of the gaming world as the most popular portable console, thanks to games suitable for everyone. Players all over Europe made Animal Crossing: Wild World, New Super Mario Bros and Metroid Prime Hunters best-sellers.\n\nNintendogs ushered in the Touch! Generations brand of games, a range of titles that let people play like never before. Dr Kawashima's Brain Training - the top Touch! Generations title - became a huge hit even among people who never played before.\n\nNintendo DS renewed its look in June with the Nintendo DS Lite, which features brighter screens along with its slim design.\n\nThe year ended with the launch of Wii. The new home console with its innovative control system found an audience with both Nintendo fans and those who don't traditionally play videogames. The console's success is bolstered by titles such as Wii Sports and the newest episode in the Zelda series, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.\n\nPrior to the launch of Wii, Nintendo President Satoru Iwata conducted a series of internal interviews with Nintendo staff as well as external developers providing an in-depth look behind the scenes of the company and the process of bringing new hardware and software to market. The ‚ÄúIwata Asks‚Äù series of interviews would be continued in years to come, often candidly revealing information about the inner workings of the company, both past and present.\n\n2007\n\nWith Wii‚Äôs emergence at the end of 2006, the stage was set in 2007 for the arrival of a range of titles that took advantage of the system‚Äôs unique capabilities and threw the door wide open to a whole new gaming audience.\n\nGames like WarioWare: Smooth Moves, Endless Ocean and Big Brain Academy for Wii invited everyone to dive into the fun regardless of previous experience, while the arrival of Super Mario Galaxy and Metroid Prime 3: Corruption brought cherished Nintendo franchises back into being with the addition of new features only possible on Wii.\n\nFans of classic games rejoiced in September when the first Hanabi Festival was celebrated on Virtual Console. Millions of European Wii players could get their hands on titles like Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels for the very first time, as the Hanabi Festival saw the launch of gaming classics never before released in Europe.\n\nThe Mii Contest Channel launched on Wii in November, allowing players to enter Mii characters of their own creation in themed competitions. The Channel resides in an ongoing tradition of providing players with tools to allow them to express their creativity and get more actively involved with Nintendo products, further highlighting the shift from passive playing to active involvement.\n\nOn Nintendo DS, Sight Training: Enjoy Exercising and Relaxing Your Eyes as well as More Brain Training from Dr Kawashima expanded the Touch! Generations range of software and continued to attract new users, a feat also achieved by the newest instalment in the Legend of Zelda series, Phantom Hourglass - which invited players to control all the exploration and action on the Nintendo DS Touch Screen.\n\n6 December saw the launch of the revamped website for Nintendo of Europe.

Later in the year, the launch of Mario Kart Wii and the Wii Wheel accessory brought players of all ages and experience levels together for classic Mario Kart action that was straightforward for beginners and engrossing for experts.\n\nContinuing the trend on Nintendo DS, Professor Kageyama‚Äôs Maths Training and ‚ÄòCooking Guide: Can‚Äôt decide what to eat?‚Äô expanded on the traditional uses for games systems by turning calculation into a fun diversion and offering users a helping hand in the kitchen, while the arrival of Professor Layton and the Curious Village had players young and old scratching their heads for solutions to problematic puzzles.\n\nThe month of May saw the launch of WiiWare, a game download service that offered Wii owners access to a host of affordable and varied new titles that could be purchased from the comfort of their sofas via the Wii Shop Channel. Another new service, the Nintendo Channel, was also launched on Wii, providing users with access to info, news and interviews relating to upcoming titles.\n\nIn June Nintendo of Europe‚Äôs website welcomed another country with the inclusion of South Africa.\n\nTowards the end of the year two more high-profile titles were released for Wii. Shigeru Miyamoto‚Äôs entry into the music game genre, Wii Music, allowed families to get together and freely experiment simulating the playing of a wide variety of music instruments. Closing the year was Animal Crossing: Let‚Äôs Go to the City which supported the Wii Speak accessory, connecting living rooms across an Internet connection, allowing players to talk to each other as they visited each other‚Äôs towns in the game.\n\n2009\n\nIn March 2009 Nintendo Iberica S.A. opened a branch office in Lisbon to provide marketing and commercial services of Nintendo products in Portugal. During the same month Nintendo also announced it had shipped its 100 millionth Nintendo DS system worldwide.\n\nA month later the Nintendo DS range grew with the arrival of Nintendo DSi in Europe.
