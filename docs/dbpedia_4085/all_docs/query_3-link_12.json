        "text": "Great days are coming for the Pool-Billiards industry. More and more organizations value billiards higher than ever before and investments increase year after year. The World Billiards Museum in Yushan, China highlights the culture that every player knew about but most people who hadn‚Äôt had the chance to engage more with billiards, didn‚Äôt! Take a look at the video and let me know what you think in the comments section. *If you were looking for the right moment to invest in pool-billiards, that would be now. #billiards #pool\n\nWe're looking for great examples of cultural projects around the world that have used a 'meanwhile use' or festival-based approach to test out ideas and establish a cultural destination for the longer term. Do you know of... * Any art museums that have started out as festivals? * Any foundations that have emerged from a programme-driven model? * Any destinations that had a strong participatory or co-design model? They can be large or small. A couple that spring to mind as inspiration include Derby's Museum of Making, National Museums Liverpool Sunrise to Sunset festival, and Nantes as a city-wide approach to festivals that established longer term destinations... Ideas and examples welcome! Petra Marko Carl Turner Juliette Rizzi Aki Carpenter Allison Louis Walker Catherine Botibol Sam O.

Did you know that Bucharest has some of the most beautiful and interesting museums in the country? This video will show you all you need to know on this topic! - - - üìå In this video, our colleague Casiana will present to you the top 5 museums you must visit while you are in Bucharest, as well as various tips and tricks on this subject. - - - https://lnkd.in/dpyzyed4\n\nüåü Thrilled to Share My Experience from The Good Lobby Summer Academy! üåü Just back from three transformative days in Bilbao, I am excited to reflect on my participation at The Good Lobby Summer Academy. This event brought together thought leaders in public affairs, sparking intense discussions and valuable insights into the efficacy and ethics of business associations in the public sphere. üîç Key Insights: - We delved deep into the concept of the 'political footprint' of companies and associations, a timely topic given the current global trends in polarization and legislative challenges. - One significant takeaway was the impact of associations on the democratic legislative process. There‚Äôs a fine line between influence and interference, and it was enlightening to examine this in the context of public affairs. - We also tackled the common misperceptions about the influence of trade associations. Often seen as powerful entities, the reality is that many struggle with resource limitations and the challenge of consolidating diverse member interests into a unified voice. üìà My Contribution: I was fortunate to contribute my insights on how business associations can navigate public affairs with efficacy and ethical integrity. Discussing these topics with peers was enriching and highlighted the crucial role of transparency and the recognition of trade associations as legitimate stakeholders in public discourse. ü§ù Looking Forward: The discussions left me with mixed feelings about the polarization in public affairs‚Äîboth challenged by the complexities and inspired by the potential for positive change. Such platforms must exist to amplify diverse voices in public affairs, ensuring a balanced and comprehensive understanding. Thank you to The Good Lobby for a fantastic opportunity to grow, share, and connect. Let‚Äôs keep the conversation going and continue to drive meaningful change in the world of public affairs! #PublicAffairs #TheGoodLobby #SummerAcademy #EthicsInBusiness #PoliticalFootprint #Bilbao2024 #ProfessionalGrowth #Networking\n\nIt's all about the story... The story behind something is what adds depth and life to it, whether that be the antique writing desk handed down through generations, or the well worn leather jacket your dad purchased in the 70's from Camden Market. These stories add soul, and that's one of the reasons I love where I work - the story. Not just the Sofas & Stuff story, but the story, thought, and inspiration behind every piece and collection. With the latest V&A collaboration being rich in history - not just beautiful fabrics, but history woven into each design."
