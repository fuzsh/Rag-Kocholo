        "text": "Join us for a special tour of our South Asia Gallery, a landmark partnership with The British Museum. Lead Curator Nusrat Ahmed is ready to let you into the stories behind this unique gallery, which captures the vibrancy and richness of the British South Asian experience. We start by focusing on the stunning mural from the Singh twins that adorns the entrance to the gallery. Riches to Rags, Rags to Riches is an emotional map of South Asia, charting the journey through three periods in Indo-British history, from ancient to colonial and post-colonial times. You can take the full tour on Manchester Museum‚Äôs YouTube channel. https://lnkd.in/eX-4GZpU\n\nSouth Asian Heritage Month is underway and we're starting the celebrations with Nepal Day. Join us at the Museum tomorrow for our first event focused on Nepali culture, heritage, and arts, organised as part of the programme around our award-winning South Asia Gallery. Dance, sing, find your flow through yoga and enjoy temporary exhibitions featuring everyday objects and photography. https://lnkd.in/ewgch6An üì∑ Louisa Kamal\n\nIt was so much fun to welcome BBC Breakfast down at the Museum this morning. They reported live throughout the morning, with a focus on the vital role museums play in providing inclusive and accessible days out for families, particularly in the context of the cost of living crisis. It‚Äôs important to us that entry, special exhibitions and the vast majority of events remain free for all. If you fancy catching our star turn, head to the link below and you‚Äôll find us at 47:27 and 2:54:30. https://lnkd.in/e6_-vgwa\n\nOur brilliant National Saturday Club members are off to Somerset House this weekend to see their work in this year's Summer Show. Over the past six months, they've been taking part in creative workshops with industry experts and artists, exploring the big issues shaping our world today. Themes have included climate change, social justice and activism. Their ideas are reflected in artwork they created for this year‚Äôs exhibition. The National Saturday Club will return to the Museum in autumn 2024 so, if you're 13-16 and interested in how we can work together to create a fairer and more sustainable future, watch this space.\n\nThe day is almost here! Tomorrow we finally find out who is Art Fund Museum of the Year 2024. As we get ready for the big day, we thought we‚Äôd take a quick look back at the day the judges paid us a visit and use this opportunity to say thank you to all the brilliant people who have made the past 18 months totally unforgettable. If we win tomorrow, it's one for our staff, our volunteers, our partners, our visitors, our communities and our city.\n\nCalling all local makers with a passion for sustainability. We‚Äôre holding a Wild Christmas Market at the Museum on 7-8 December and we‚Äôd love to get as many of you involved as possible. Head to the link for more info and to register your interest. https://lnkd.in/ebtHqrB5 üì∏ Howard Wood / COAST\n\n‚ÄúIf we can do this, we have the power.‚Äù Rose from Rainbow Haven of TEMCA (The East Manchester Community Association) talks about the impact A Sense Of Flora will have on the displaced people they work with. Artist Daksha Patel's project draws on Manchester Museum's botany collection to explore how experiences and memories of natural environments and plants are linked to identity and belonging. The centrepiece of the show, which debuts at the Museum on 3 August, will be a large installation of prints, made by asylum seekers and refugees during workshops at Rainbow Haven. Based in Gorton, Rainbow Haven is a place of welcome, support, and opportunity for displaced people in Manchester and the surrounding areas and we're proud to celebrate their work during #RefugeeWeek. * A Sense of Flora is supported by Arts Council England.\n\nEven a small action can make a huge difference. Our Curator of Entomology, Diana Arzuza Buelvas, has brought together an incredible selection of insects for our new exhibition Wild. It includes the beautiful purple emperor butterfly, which has become the poster child of the Knepp Rewilding Project. Prior to the project, none had been recorded at Knepp in the recent past but the estate is now home to the UK's largest colony. Diana hopes stories like this one will inspire us all to take action on biodiversity loss. Head down to Wild this weekend to start your own journey. https://lnkd.in/eYGEM6wD\n\nWild Talks | Art, nature, place and belonging Delve deeper into the issues raised by our new exhibition, Wild, through our series of free public lectures, in collaboration with The University of Manchester. On Saturday, our Director Esme Ward will be in conversation with Mike Murawski, a leading advocate for museums as agents of change - bringing people together, contributing to communities and changing lives. They‚Äôll be exploring how stronger connections to the world around us can help to accelerate this change and how museums can play a leading role in addressing environmental challenges. üóìÔ∏è Saturday 15 June ‚è∞ 2-3.30pm üéüÔ∏è Free üîó https://lnkd.in/eqxiyTxE\n\nJoy and celebration will fill the Museum next week, as we mark Africa Day, not once but twice. The two events are part of wider work around African collections, centred around engagement with communities in Africa and across the diaspora. Curator of Living Cultures, Dr Njabulo Chipangura, explains the story around this beautiful Zulu beadwork, which you can find in our Collections Reimagined gallery. Working with communities, we are reassessing provenance research, shaping object biographies, exploring restitutions and repatriations, and creating new knowledge."
