With a new entrance, and a mission to build understanding between cultures and a more sustainable world, this tile shows more than simply the museum’s architecture. The building is reimagined amid plants and animals, illustrating the museum’s action to make a greener Manchester.\n\nRendered in The Sculpts' distinctive pen and ink style, the M tile shows Manchester Museum as a place that people of all ages gather, to enjoy, be inspired, learn and share.\n\nEach Tile is designed in Manchester by The Sculpts. The tiles are screen printed and hand-rolled in Stoke-on-Trent, before being fired in Manchester-local kilns."
