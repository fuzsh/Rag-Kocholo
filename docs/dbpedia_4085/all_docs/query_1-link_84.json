        "text": "“When I was growing up, I didn’t feel like I belonged in museums,” says Nusrat Ahmed, a first-generation British-born South Asian. “If I had the opportunity of seeing myself within museum spaces, through the stories being told, then finding a way to connect to my heritage would have been far easier.” Manchester Museum has introduced the UK’s “first permanent gallery dedicated to the lived experience of the South Asian community” so that the diaspora feels rooted to their heritage. The gallery that is all set to open on 18 February is part of a £15 million overhaul for the 130-year-old museum.\n\n“There is a large community of people of South Asian heritage in Greater Manchester, and it’s important that museums reflect and work for the cities they serve,” says Ahmed who is the lead curator of the gallery. She is supported by a team of 30 people from the community, each of whom brings their own perspectives and stories to the exhibits. “We put an open call out for Collective members and we didn’t turn anyone away. We wanted to include as many people as possible from community leaders and teachers to artists and musicians,” she says.\n\nThe collective was formed over five years ago by Manchester Museum director Esme Ward. The idea sparked after she asked more than 100 people from the South Asian community what they wanted to see.\n\nThe gallery is driven by stories rather than objects alone and is divided into anthologies named Lived Environments, Movement and Empire, Sound Music and Dance, and more for a contemporary take on the culture. “There are stories of what it’s like to be a young British-Asian person today; there are stories about the LGBTQ+ community; there are stories about the environment to inspire and motivate, and much more,” says Ahmed.\n\nWhen visitors enter the gallery, they will be greeted with the work of Amrit Singh MBE and Rabindra Kaur Singh MBE who are known as The Singh Twins. The two are acclaimed for redefining the Eurocentric perceptions of art and identity. Their work includes an “emotional map” of South Asia that embodies the twins’ identity and experience as British artists of both Indian and English descent. “It also explores interconnected and hidden histories, which challenge institutionalised prejudice, negative racial stereotyping and misperceptions about cultural identity and ownership,” says Ahmed.\n\nThe anthologies also feature diverse objects and artefacts that have been chosen to represent and further interpret the stories being told, from a rickshaw imported from Bangladesh and decorated by UK-based artist Daya Bhatti to a seven-foot-tall self-portrait by local artist Azraa Motala exploring what it means to be British-Asian today. The British Museum has also loaned 45 objects to the gallery. They range from a 2,000-year-old statue of the Buddha from Gandhara, an object that reveals cultural and artistic connections between ancient India and the Greco-Roman world, to a miniature model of a Charkha spinning wheel, a device for spinning thread that became a symbol of self-sufficiency for Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian Independence movement in the early 18th century.\n\nThe anthology ‘Movement and Empire’ sparked from difficult and traumatic conversations that the co-curators had during the process. “Many South Asian people living in Greater Manchester are here because of the Partition of 1947, a dark moment in the history of the British Empire in which millions of people were displaced. We don’t shy away from these difficult stories,” she says. Some of the objects at the gallery belong to the co-curators themselves. Talat, a member, loaned his great-grandfather’s World War 1 uniform for display. Fal Sarker, the grandson of quantum science pioneer Satyendra Nath Bose, has contributed letters between Bose and Einstein.\n\nThe gallery also spotlights the people the community may not be aware of. “For example, it shines a light on overlooked historic discoveries such as Anna Mani, an inspirational woman who measured the skies. She was an Indian meteorologist who, in the 1950s, developed one of the first-ever devices to measure the atmospheric ozone - and subsequently broke the glass ceiling in the scientific world!”\n\nIn an attempt to keep the diaspora connected with their homelands, the museum recently launched RhythmXChange, a year-long collaborative project by Indian Music Experience Museum, Bengaluru and Manchester Museum supported by the British Council. The project brings together four young musician mentees to explore rhythm as a shared language between East and West. The gallery will also host a range of performances, films and activities to keep the cultural exchange vibrant and relevant.\n\nAhmed truly believes representing the South Asian diaspora and preserving South Asian history in museums is long overdue. “My hope is that the gallery shines a light on the achievements and contributions of South Asia and that people might see themselves represented in the space and find a connection to their heritage. I hope my grandchildren and great-grandchildren will feel that they belong in galleries and museums. ”"
