        "text": "The National Railway Museum in York has opened a new temporary exhibition called Go as you Please to highlight underrepresented and authentic stories about disability alongside 20th century railway artwork.\n\nThe exhibition opened on 8 February 2024 and is an exploration of rail travel from the perspectives of people with lived experience of D/deafness, disability and neurodivergence. It will feature objects from the collection including railway artwork and marketing posters.\n\nPart of the national Curating for Change programme, Go as you Please will include a specially-commissioned original artwork called Shifting Landscapes by neurodivergent artist Hayley Wall.\n\nObject labels for the exhibition include quotes from community participants and in a first for the museum, the exhibition includes many accessible features such as QR codes that lead to an audio descriptive tour, portable object labels and a British Sign Language exhibition overview.\n\nThe exhibition includes a film called We Do Get Out and About (created by Manchester-based filmmaker David Bewick) which has subtitles, a transcript and British Sign Language interpretation.\n\nGo as you Please is curated by Amy Thraves-Connor, Curating for Change Fellow at the National Railway Museum. Amy said:\n\n“I hope visitors are drawn to the exhibition for its eye-catching artwork and are encouraged through this artwork to engage with stories they otherwise might not have thought relevant to them. The unexpected narrative explores the experience of travel and destination from a range of often overlooked perspectives. I want visitors to the exhibition to make their own interpretations and memories from these artworks and feel encouraged to question their thoughts around disability.”\n\nCurating for Change is an England-wide programme that offers fellowships and traineeships to D/deaf, disabled and neurodivergent curators and was founded to challenge the underrepresentation of disabled museum professionals.\n\nThe programme aims to build a more diverse sector workforce, which is representative of the wider population, and to encourage a broader range of narratives to be explored in museums and galleries.\n\nCurating for Change is delivered in partnership with Screen South and the Accentuate Programme and funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, Art Fund and Arts Council England.\n\nGo as you Please opened in the National Railway Museum’s Highlights Gallery in Great Hall and is on display from Thursday 8 February until June.
