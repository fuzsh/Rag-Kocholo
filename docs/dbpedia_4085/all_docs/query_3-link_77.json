        "text": "View Audio Described Performances\n\nWhat is an Audio Described Performance?\n\nDesigned to improve the experience for people who are blind or visually impaired, as well as listening to the dialogue on stage, the theatregoer can wear a headset and listen to a live description of the action on stage. The description only happens in between dialogue and supplements the voices of the performers in explaining the emotions and action of each scene.\n\nThere is usually a free touch tour approximately one hour prior to the performance. During a touch tour, a member of the visiting company will give you an introduction to the production and tell you about the visual elements of the production; you will also be able to explore the set and touch selected props and costumes.\n\nAudio Described Performances are discounted and are delivered by Mind’s Eye or Caroline Burn, Talking Theatre\n\nHow do I use this service?\n\nSimply ask one of our Information Assistants for a headset when you arrive.

During these performances, the interpreter will stand in a spotlight and communicate with the audience by signing throughout the show.\n\nHow do I use this service?\n\nWhen booking, our Box Office staff will advise you of the best places to sit so that you have a clear view of the interpreter.
