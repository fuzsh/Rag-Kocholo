Lesson 6: Crafting Your Campaign Implementation Procedures\n\nDevelopers: Verena Calas, National Park Service Museum Educator, Washington D.C\n\nGrade Level: 6-8 grades\n\nNumber of Sessions in the Lesson Unit Plan: 6\n\n[Back to top]\n\nB. Overview of this Collection-Based Lesson Unit Plan\n\nPark Name: Treasured Landscapes: Virtual exhibit artworks from multiple parks.\n\nDescription: This unit explores how landscape art contributed the preservation and conservation of natural, cultural, and historic places of importance to Americans that are part of the National Park System. These artworks, are owned and preserved by the National Park Service and are locate in the collections of many different parks. This unit includes activities that develop studentsâ skills of observation, documentation, and analysis. Students will be able to apply these skills to through a real-world application in which they will develop a campaign to conserve and reorganize a significant local site.\n\nEssential Question: How did American landscape artists and photographers such as Thomas Moran and William Henry Jackson help to promote the conservation of Americaâs natural and cultural wonders and establishment of the National Park Service?\n\nLesson Overviews\n\nLesson 1: This lesson teaches students how to identify NPS parks by theme and state on a U.S. map. Students will also discuss the relationship between 19th century conservationism, Westward expansion, and the NPS.\n\nLesson 2: Explore Your World! This lesson teaches students how to compare and contrast casual and scientific observation techniques and interpret the field notebook of a Yellowstone botanist. Students will systematically observe and document the geography, plants, and animals of an area.\n\nLesson 3: For the Record: This lesson teaches students how to compare and contrast photography, drawing, and painting as visual records while using primary source sketches to identify artistic choices and perception of an artistic subject. Students will also explore the process and tools of traditional film photography.\n\nLesson 4: The Campaign for Yellowstone: This lesson explores who 19th century conservationists worked to establish Yellowstone National Park. Students will conduct a mock interview of a historical figure and write a newspaper article.\n\nLesson 5: The Bull Pen: A Photographic Comparison: This lesson explores how landscape painting and photography preserve and convey the significance of historical places.\n\nLesson 6: Crafting Your Campaign: In this lesson students will collaboratively design a campaign advocating for the preservation and recognition of a local site.\n\n[Back to top]\n\nC. Museum Collections, Similar Items and other Materials Used in this Lesson Unit Plan In this lesson students will collaboratively design a campaign advocating for the preservation and recognition of a local site.\n\nMUSEUM OBJECT [photos of objects in the Parks museum collections] SIMILAR OBJECTS [local items similar to museum objects] & OTHER MATERIALS Length of time\n\nSimilar Items [similar to objects in the Park museum collection] & OTHER MATERIALS:\n\nArt Supplies\n\n120\n\nminutes (2 days)\n\n[Back to top]\n\nD. National Educational Standards\n\nNSS-USH.5-12.1 Era 4\n\nStandard 1 Understands United States territorial expansion between 1801 and 1861, and how it affected relations with external powers and Native Americans\n\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RH.6-8.1\n\nCite specific textual evidence to support analysis of primary and secondary sources.\n\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RH.6-8.2\n\nDetermine the central ideas or information of a primary or secondary source; provide an accurate summary of the source distinct from prior knowledge or opinions.\n\nCCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RH.6-8.9\n\nAnalyze the relationship between a primary and secondary source on the same topic\n\n[Back to top] E. Student Learning Objectives\n\nStudents will be able to (SWBAT) articulate the ideas, emotions, and attitudes reflected in Thomas Moranâs artistic works.\n\nSWBAT work in groups to create a campaign to preserve a local site, area, or landmark.\n\n[Back to top]\n\nF. Background and Historical Context See Making a Scene, Background Information PowerPoint\n\n[Back to top] G. Vocabulary Cultural Resources: Tangible objects and structures that are the material evidence of past human activities. H. Teacher Tips\n\nUse online collections; objects, documents, maps, and photographs to further student inquiry and to address student learning objectives.\n\nActivities can be adapted for class length and grade levels.\n\nActivities can be adapted for different grade levels (and reading levels).\n\nObtain for classroom use, tangible items similar to the museum objects that students will study.\n\n[Back to top] I. Lesson Implementation Procedures J. Evaluation/Assessment for Measurable Results\n\nParticipation in daily activities.\n\nProducts from Student Activities (Lessons 2-5).\n\nIndividual homework assignments that build towards culminating project.\n\nCampaign material preparation\n\nMounting of campaign material in exhibit\n\n[Back to top]\n\nK. Extension and Enrichment Activities\n\nProduce a 5-10 minute documentary video on a selected local landscape/monument/landmark.\n\nCreate a publicity poster for the student-curated exhibitions\n\nUse the dates and locations recorded in Thomas Moranâs diary to trace the route of the Hayden expedition. Use maps of Yellowstone to calculate daily distances that Moran travelled.\n\nResearch a recent preservation or conservation controversy at a National Park of your choice (e.g. the reintroduction of gray wolves in Yellowstone).\n\nSelect a National Park or Historic Site and research its designation as a protected site\n\nL.
