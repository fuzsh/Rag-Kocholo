        "text": "Creating alt text for the images in your book\n\nMUP is committed to ensuring new publications are accessible for users with different requirements and preferences, as well as improving the accessibility of previously published content.\n\nAn important way of making your book accessible is to ensure all the images included in the ebook editions can be processed by assistive technologies such as screen-readers. A description of each visual element needs to be tagged and formatted as part of the ebook file content so that it can be read out to the user alongside the caption and the main text. This is called ‘alternative text’, commonly referred to as ‘alt text’.\n\nMUP will take care of the technical side of things, and we ask our authors to submit an alt text description for each image included in their book alongside the captions and permissions information.\n\nGuidelines for writing alt text\n\nPlease read the following 7 guidelines when preparing your alt text, and contact your Assistant Editor or Commissioning Editor if you have any questions:\n\nDon’t include ‘Image of…’ or ‘A photograph of…’ at the start of your alt text. Assistive technology will automatically indicate for the user when an image is being described.\n\nTry to keep each alt text description concise – about 30 words is ideal. This can be one sentence or more than one. Use standard punctuation in your alt text.\n\nConsider how to make your caption and alt text description different – where the caption might include the title and artist of a painting, or the character names and year of release of a still from a film, the alt text should only include details you can determine from looking at the image itself. Extraneous, factual and contextual details are more appropriate to include in the caption, list of figures or within the main body of the text.\n\nThere isn’t one ‘ideal’ alt text for every image – the best alt text description for each image will depend on why it has been included in the book, and will focus on the feature or features that you are drawing the reader’s attention to in the context of the discussion in your text. See the next section for some examples.\n\nIf an image includes text (e.g. an image of part of a letter or a poster), it is best practice to include all the wording in the alt text. However, if the text from the image is already included in full in the caption, it may not need to be repeated in the alt text. And if a user who is able to access the image isn’t expected to read all of the text in full (e.g. an image of a letter that has been included to demonstrate the style of handwriting or age of the document), it is not necessary to include all the text in the alt text, just the relevant aspects of the image.\n\nUnless permissions preclude it, MUP include all images in colour in the ebook editions (where the original image files provided are in colour). Bear this in mind if it you need to include descriptive details of an object or image in your alt text.\n\nIf you are including a detailed image such as a complicated diagram in your book, this might require a significantly longer description than 30 words. In such cases, a special category of alt text (a Long Description) might be more appropriate than standard alt text. Please ask your Commissioning Editor or Assistant Editor about this if necessary.\n\nThere are many useful resources online to support people in creating alt text, some of which are linked to below. You might notice different organisations and publishers occasionally mentioning conflicting advice on particular points (for example, on how many words or characters alt text should be). MUP recommends that you follow our guidelines here in the first instance, as they have been developed to suit the majority of MUP titles. However, if you think the images in your book might have different alt text requirements, or if you want to check a couple of examples of alt text are ok before proceeding with the rest, please do get in touch with your Assistant Editor or Commissioning Editor and we will be happy to provide further advice.\n\nAlt text examples\n\nThese 4 images all have multiple possibilities for alt text, depending on the context of the book and the reason the image has been included. We have included 2 possible examples for each image, to demonstrate how the level and type of detail could change, and how the alt text differs from the caption:\n\nFurther examples\n\nIf your book includes visual depictions of data, such as graphs, charts, diagrams or maps, this guidance from United Nations Publications contains several useful examples. For the most part, the short alt text example will be appropriate to use, describing what the data represents and possibly including an overall trend or conclusion, with more specific details or examples included as part of the discussion in the main text of the book:\n\nUnited Nations tips to craft and edit alt text\n\nThis guidance from Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, includes many examples of alt text for different types of illustrative image, with advice for constructing image descriptions:\n\nCooper Hewitt museum alt text guidance\n\nWhy do we need good alt text?\n\nHere is a 1-minute video that demonstrates the importance of alt text. It shows how an image is processed by assistive technology when alt text is not included, compared with the same image being processed when good alt text is correctly formatted and included:\n\nScreen reader test video\n\nDifferent types of screen-reader and text-to-speech tools will have slightly different ways of introducing and presenting alt text, and there are a range of different types of voice used (these are becoming increasingly sophisticated, often through AI technology, and some assistive tech enables users to choose authentic types of voice and accent).\n\nAlt text is also useful when a website or user’s device is affected by outside circumstances that might stop image or video content displaying fully (e.g. site maintenance or limited internet connection). In such cases, good alt text will support the reader’s experience even if their device isn’t able to load images.\n\nWhatever the tool or technology being used, having appropriate and concise alt text is an important way of making your book accessible to as many readers as possible.\n\n[last updated May 2024]"
