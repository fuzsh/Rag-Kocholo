        "text": "When writing alt text, ask yourself:\n\nWhy is this visual element here?\n\nWhat information does it present?\n\nWhat is its purpose?\n\nIf the image were removed, how would I describe it to convey the same information and/or purpose?\n\nFor example, the below image could be interpreted differently in different contexts.\n\nIf the main text was about the presentation of Greek sculpture the alt text might read:\n\n“Several marble statues in a museum. Each statue represents a torso as a fragment of a larger sculpture which has been damaged, with limbs missing. The statues are placed above the viewer’s eye level on plinths, behind a small protective guiderail.”\n\nHowever, if the text was about de-colonising museums the alt text might be different, e.g.\n\n“People looking at seven marble sculptures of Greek origin in The British Museum.”\n\nIf a screenshot is part of an instructional document, and the steps outlined in the process are already fully represented within the text, screenshots can be marked as decorative.\n\nIf the screenshot image adds additional information, this must be made available via alt text.\n\nFor example, if the below image was used on a PowerPoint slide directing students where to submit their exam with no other instructive text, alt text would be needed which would adequately explain this to a visually impaired user.\n\nIn this case you could apply a description like:\n\n“The link to ‘Submit Your ABDC12345 Exam’ can be located by navigating to Assessments in Blackboard, where it will be the first link under the heading.”\n\nHowever, it would probably be more useful for both visually impaired and sighted users simply to add this to the main text of the document, so there is clear instruction, which is reinforced using a screenshot.\n\nIf using charts or graphs, the alt text needs to contain all the information in the chart that is not already featured in the main body of the text.\n\nFor example, if there was no text referring to the information shown in the chart above, it should have alt text that reads:\n\n“Pie sale percentages for the first quarter: Apple 23.8, Blackberry 14.3, Cherry 28.6, Peach 19, and Stargazy 14.3.”\n\nIf this information is already featured in the main body text, there is no need to repeat this, and the chart could be marked as decorative.\n\nIf using charts and graphs, it’s better to convey their content in the main body of the text and use the image as a reinforcement or complementary visual aid, rather than the sole way to convey this information."
