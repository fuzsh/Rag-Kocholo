Political meetings were held to protest against the government and demand reform. The climax came in 1819, when 60,000 people gathered at St. Peter’s Fields in Manchester. The main speaker at the meeting was Henry Hunt, a leading political reformer. The crowd gathered to hear Hunt speak about parliamentary reform.\n\nHowever, the Manchester magistrates chose to arrest Hunt. They used the local yeomanry (amateur cavalry) to seize him. In the chaos that followed, 11 people died and many were injured. This event soon became known as ‘Peterloo’, after the recent Battle of Waterloo in 1815.\n\nAfter these events some people blamed the magistrates; others cited the violence of the crowd. Many attacked the behaviour of the yeomanry, saying they were guilty of overreacting because the meeting was peaceful. However, the government chose to defend the magistrates and the yeomanry and promptly introduced new laws to restrict political rights.\n\nUsing the original documents in this lesson, find out about events at ‘Peterloo’ and the response of the authorities.\n\nTasks\n\nBackground\n\n‘Popular radicalism’ was based on democratic ideals and was critical of government corruption. After the French Wars, there was a return to public political meetings and riots. The Spa Fields riots were incidents of public disorder resulting from the second of two mass meetings held at Spa Fields, Islington in London, 1816. There was a rising at Pentrich in Derbyshire in 1817. A few months before these events, a demonstration was held in Manchester by radical weavers known as the ‘Blanketeers’. They planned to march to London and present a petition to the Prince Regent about the depression in the textile industry in Lancashire and the suspension of Habeas Corpus (making it possible for people be imprisoned unlawfully). This so-called ‘March of the Blanketeers’ was broken up violently and the leaders imprisoned.\n\nPerhaps the best-known demonstration for political rights at this time is known as the ‘Peterloo Massacre.’ The reform meeting at St Peter’s Field in Manchester in August 1819 followed two years of revived interest in the radical press, mass petitioning and trade unionism, still illegal at this time.\n\nIt has been estimated that perhaps 60,000 men, women and children met at St Peter’s Field to hear Henry Hunt and others speak in favour of political reforms and rights for the poor. For several weeks beforehand, the reformers practised military drills with those planning to attend to ensure order on the day. However, local magistrates believed the reformers were preparing for armed rebellion; they declared the meeting illegal and warned people to stay at home. The meeting went ahead and started peacefully. However, when Hunt arrived, the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry (the amateur cavalry) were sent by the magistrates to arrest him. They slashed their way through the crowd, killing 11 people and resulting in 400 people being injured. The 15th Hussars on standby, who had previously fought at Waterloo, came in to support the yeomanry and cleared the field. Out of contempt for what happened, the disaster soon became referred to as the ‘Peterloo’.\n\nMr W. R. Hay, a Lancashire magistrate, justified the position of the local authorities when he wrote to Lord Sidmouth, 16 August 1819 to say: ‘the whole bore the appearance of insurrection; that the array was such as to terrify all the king’s subjects, and was such as the magistrates had felt a decided conviction that no legitimate purpose could justify’. He goes on to describe the flags at the hustings which can be seen in the engraving showing the event: ‘The flag on which was “Equal Representation or Death,” was a black one; and in addition, on the same side, had “No borough mongering – Unite, and be Free;” at the bottom, “Saddleworth, Lees, and Morley Union;” on the reverse, “No Corn Laws; – Taxation, without Representation, is unjust and tyrannical.” On the Middleton flag was, “Let us die like men, and not be sold like slaves;” reverse, “Liberty is the birth right of man.”’\n\nHowever, others reported events differently. The radical ‘Manchester Observer’ and ‘The Times’ of London commented on the deaths and hundreds of casualties caused by the cavalry, which the authorities tried to discredit by referring to individual cases, as shown by one of the sources in this lesson.\n\nThere were further protest meetings resulting in arrests as news of events spread. The government, which had supported the actions of magistrates after ‘Peterloo’, introduced new laws to prevent any future disturbances. The ‘Six Acts’ were aimed at suppressing any meetings for the purpose of radical reform. They meant that drilling for military exercises was forbidden and warrants were issued to search for arms. Far more repressive was the extension of stamp duty to more newspapers, increased powers for magistrates to seize seditious literature, and powers to prevent meetings designed to present petitions.\n\nTeachers' notes\n\nStudents use sources from The National Archives to examine events at St Peter’s Field, Manchester in August 1919.\n\nStarter Activity\n\nTeachers can use our illustration image, an anonymous print published in 1819, as a starter document to introduce the lesson. [Students are later tasked to compare this to another image in Source 2.]\n\nThe image from the British Museum is entitled: ‘To Henry Hunt, Esquire, as chairman of the meeting assembled on St. Peter’s Field, Manchester on the 16th of August, 1819’. The title continues: ‘and to the Female Reformers of Manchester and the adjacent Towns who were exposed to and suffered from the Wanton and Furious Attack made on them by that British Armed Force the Manchester and Cheshire Yeomanry Cavalry’. According to the National Portrait Gallery, who have also have print of this image, it was published by radical journalist Richard Carlile. From 1817, Carlile promoted two radical weeklies, ‘The Black Dwarf’ and ‘Sherwin’s Weekly Political Register’. In 1819 he was put on trial for publishing the work of Thomas Paine and was heavily fined and jailed for 9 years.\n\nIt shows a view of the scene around the platform on the day. A woman holds a banner inscribed ‘Manchester Female Reform’ which shows a female figure trampling on ‘Coruption’. There are three more banners on the platform saying: Universal Suffrage’; ‘Liberty or Death’, ‘Universal Civil and Religious Liberty’. In the foreground a man holds a banner on which a female figure holds a sword and is pursued by one of the yeomanry. Each banner is topped with a cap of Liberty.\n\nAsk the students to describe what they see.\n\nWho does the artist show sympathy for? How is this achieved?\n\nWhat do we learn about the role of female reformers at this meeting?\n\nWhat does the original caption of this image add to our understanding of events at ‘Peterloo’?\n\nWhat other sources do we need to help understand what happened?\n\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages of visual evidence?\n\nIn this lesson, students examine a letter sent to the authorities in Manchester on behalf of Lord Sidmouth, the Home Secretary on 4 August 1819. Sidmouth gave advice on the steps to be taken before the meeting happened in St Peter’s Fields.\n\nStudents can explore what is revealed about the government’s attitude to the meeting. Are they prepared to use force to disperse the crowd? In what situation would the public behaviour be the subject of prosecution?\n\nThe second source is a coloured engraving of the events at St Peter’s Fields on 16 August 1819 in Manchester. Students can discuss the advantages and disadvantages of visual evidence. The engraving shows how ‘Peterloo’ soon came to be used as radical propaganda. It is also possible for them to find out more about the story of John Jenkins who bought the engraving by using other original sources on the ‘Chudleigh show’ in our themed collection Democracy and Protest (part 2).\n\nStudents then look at a scrap of paper giving an account of events at St. Peter’s Fields in Manchester which shows that few expected the Yeoman Cavalry to be used to break up the crowd. This brief, vivid, immediate account is said to be our earliest report of ‘Peterloo’, 16 August 1819. This information was received in London the following day and sent to Lord Sidmouth’s office. With this document, students acquire more context for the engraving seen in Source 2.\n\nThe fourth source is an extract from a printed paper called ‘Evidence disproving some of the charges’: an attempt to explain away the death of a child called William Fildes at ‘Peterloo’. Here the authorities justify their actions, admit that a child was trampled to death in the Yeomanry charge, and blame the mother for letting go of her child when startled by the charge. There was a huge amount of public discussion after events at ‘Peterloo’, and this source could have been used by the radical press to explain the use of force by the authorities to break up a peaceful meeting.\n\nThe final source is letter from the Home Office on behalf of Lord Sidmouth, the Home Secretary, praising the conduct of the Manchester magistrates at ‘Peterloo’. Apparently the Prince Regent had also extended his praise of their handling of the situation. Both feared revolution and were not sympathetic to reforming the political system. Sidmouth was responsible for the Six Acts of 1819 following ‘Peterloo’, which were intended to reduce disturbances and radical propaganda. A contemporary magistrate’s account by W. R. Hay can also be found in our themed collection Democracy and Protest (part 2).\n\nBy way of conclusion, teachers could ask the students, which document in this lesson is the most useful for understanding events at ‘Peterloo’? How did the government respond? What are the limitations of looking at this evidence to evaluate any understanding of these events?\n\nYou may want to split the lesson for students working individually or use the document sources in paired/group work. All sources are transcribed and difficult language defined in square brackets. For further original sources on ‘Peterloo’ and the later ‘Cato Street Conspiracy’, see our themed collection Democracy and Protest (part 2), which teachers could also use to create further tasks and activities.\n\nPlease note that content in this lesson has been redeveloped from content in our Power, Politics & Protest focussed topic website, which has been archived as the interactive parts no longer work.\n\nSources\n\nIllustration image entitled:‘To Henry Hunt, Esquire, as chairman of the meeting assembled on St. Peter’s Field, Manchester on the 16th of August, 1819. © The Trustees of the British Museum.\n\nSource 1: A letter sent to authorities in Manchester on behalf of Lord Sidmouth, Home Secretary, 4 August 1819, Catalogue ref: HO 41/4 f.434\n\nSource 2.
