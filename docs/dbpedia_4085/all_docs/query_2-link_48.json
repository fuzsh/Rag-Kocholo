Visitors from all over the world are welcome to see some of the most fascinating art collections, special exhibitions, science inventions, hat works and learn about the history and culture of Greater Manchester through a friendly and knowledgeable staff and interactive activities.\n\nBefore you make your way to visit some of the best museums in Manchester, make sure to drop your belongings with one of our partners for secure luggage storage in Manchester. Most museums do not allow large bags to be brought inside.\n\nHat Works\n\nThis is a quirky award-winning museum that people might not think to visit at first, but it is pretty cool. There are two floors of interactive exhibits that delve into the history of Stockport's once-booming hatting industry. Take a step inside the museum and be transported back in time to the hatting industry's meek beginnings and the height of its production in the early 19th century.\n\nYou will find twenty rescued and restored Victorian-style machines on the museum's recreated hatting factory floor. It houses a collection of over 400 hats from around the world, but only 250 are on display at one time.

You will even hear the sounds of horses and carriages, and children laughing and playing in the street. If that doesn't make you feel like you are standing in another time, you can really get into it and get dressed up in Victorian-style clothing.\n\nAnd after the visit, you can have a picnic or take a stroll through Peel Park located beside the museum.\n\nHours: Tuesday to Friday 9:30 am - 4 pm, Saturday and Sunday 11:30 am - 4 pm\n\nThe Lowry\n\nThis is a museum that is more than just an art gallery, it is also a theater.

It's good to know that Manchester on a budget is entirely possible!\n\nHours: Gallery - Tuesday to Friday 11 am - 5 pm, Weekends 10 am - 5 pm\n\nTheatres - Monday to Sunday in line with performance times\n\nNational Football Museum\n\nIn the United States, football (soccer) is not as big as it is in most of the world. The National Football Museum shows why it has been the world's best-loved sport in so many countries and cultures. You will find an incredible collection of memorabilia such as shirts, trophies, films, and photographs from as far back as 1863.\n\nEven if you are not the biggest fan of the sport, just looking at the stunning architectural design of the former Urbis building is worth the visit. The National Football Museum also has great rotating interactive events and exhibitions that allow you to test your own football skills. And if you are not an athlete, there is a fantastic collection of retro arcade games to play.\n\nYou might be told this is a free museum but that is only true if you live in certain areas of Manchester.\n\nHours: Wednesday to Sunday 10 am - 5 pm\n\nManchester Museum\n\nThe largest university museum in the UK, the Manchester Museum houses over four million objects to explore, including a lifesize T-Rex skeleton.

You might suspect that it would be a very depressing museum to visit but on the contrary. While it does hit home how devastating war is it also reveals the resilience of the human spirit.\n\nThe museum holds an emotional perspective on Britain's conflicts since WWI. It shows how technology, science, and the involvement of women have affected the way in which wars are now fought. With over 2,000 pieces on display, like the gun that fired the first shot at the Western Front for the UK in WWI, plus films ad photos, the Imperial War Museum North provides a moving and uplifting experience.\n\nThe museum is limiting entrance so you will need to book space on their website before you go.\n\nHours: Wednesday to Sunday 10 am - 5 pm\n\nMuseum of Transport\n\nAre you a lover of trains, train stations like Manchester Piccadilly, or any form of transportation? Located in close proximity to Manchester city center, this museum will take you back in time with some of the most fascinating vehicles Britain had in the past, starting from a Victorian horse-drawn bus. You get to learn about Greater Manchester's public road transport history by browsing through two halls filled with buses from the 1930s and trams, all restored or being restored. See how people of Greater Manchester traveled to get to work or shopping.\n\nExpect to also see old ticket machines, uniforms, an old brewery lorry, and other equally fascinating vehicles from the past. This is one of the best museums in Manchester where the entire family can have fun for a good three hours of the day.\n\nHours: Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday from 10 am - 4.30 pm\n\nElizabeth Gaskell's House\n\nElizabeth Gaskell is Manchester's renowned Victorian artist. If you want to see where and how she lived, then head down to the city center (this guide can tell you what form of transport to use), where you can step inside her 180 years old Victorian middle-class house for a hands-on experience. Knowledgeable staff will take you back in time around the restored house to learn about Elizabeth Gaskell, Charlotte Bronte, and the history of other famous artists.\n\nDon't be fooled by the looks. This place is great for the entire family. With interactive activities and fascinating period rooms, a Tea room, a cafe with delicious cakes, and a nice villa garden, a day spent here with the kids, is a day well spent.

Expect to spend two hours in this house.\n\nHours: Wednesday, Thursday, Sunday from 11 am to 4.30 pm\n\nThe Pankhurst Centre\n\nThis small museum located close to Manchester Royal Infirmary is full of information about the history of the Suffragettes. Learn about their struggle and efforts by watching a video of the events and demonstrations, going through photos, and even looking at real objects from the time.

They may let you wait outside in their garden until there is an open spot for you to get in.\n\nHours: Thursday and Sunday from 11 am to 4 pm\n\nWhat are the best free museums in Manchester?\n\nWhen looking for a free museum you don't have to look far. Pretty much all the museums in Manchester and all of Great Britain are free. Most are founded by government resources, but even though they are free, they do ask for donations.\n\nWhen it comes to being able to go to a free museum most will pick one of the big ones with lots of sciency things. But if you want to be unexpectedly surprised and inspired then the choices are easy. The funky little Hat Works is just plain fun, and at The Pankhurst Centre you can't help but be uplifted by the spirit of the Suffragette movement and volunteers that work at the museum today.\n\nWhich are the best museums in Downtown Manchester?\n\nWhat is considered the best museum really depends on what you are into for instance modern art, social justice, or natural history. But for the money (which in this case there is none because they are free) the top of the list has to be the Science and Industry Museum and the Manchester Museum.\n\nBeing able to experience the amazing exhibitions and displays, not to mention all the wonderful interactive attractions they both have right in the heart of Manchester is incredible. These museums offer so many different attractions that you will have to come back again and again.\n\nAre there any cheap museums in Manchester?\n\nEven though most of the museums in Manchester are free, there are some that you will have to pay to get in, fortunately not a lot. The National Football Museum is a definite must for not just a football fan but any sports fan, and even if you are not it is still an incredibly beautiful building to admire. And it doesn't cost much to check out, who knows maybe it will make you a fan of the game.\n\nAlthough the gallery areas of The Lowry are free, the theatres do cost, but again not much. Ask any Mancunian (a person from Manchester) and they will probably tell you how inexpensive it is. Where else can you go in this present day and find one of the world's best galleries and get great stage entertainment in one building? Well ok, it is two buildings but they're connected.\n\nWonderful museums in Manchester\n\nNow when you know which museums to visit on your culture trip to Manchester and where to find them, you can plan your days easily. With all these museums and art galleries to check on your stay in Manchester, spending time in the city solo or with the family will always be exciting!"
