        "text": "Title (AO)\n\nThe textual title of the work, or reference name. Do not confuse this with the Title field for the image showing this artwork or object.\n\nContent Description (AO)\n\nFree-text description of the content depicted in the artwork or object e.g. View of the Rhine River in Cologne.\n\nContribution Description (AO)\n\nContributions made to the artwork or object expressed as free-text. This can include find, restoration, engraving, or any contribution not included under the work âCreator'. Include the type, date and location of contribution, and details about the contributor.\n\nPhysical Description (AO)\n\nThe physical characteristics of the artwork or object as free-text. Object type, materials-techniques and measurements may be described but not content of the artwork or object, for which there is the Content Description field.\n\nDate Created (AO)\n\nThe date (and optionally the time) that artworks or objects in the image were created. Please note that historical dates (before about 1900) may be handled differently by different operating systems and/or software versions and the same holds for partial dates such as year only. It may be advisable to also enter dates before that year in the Circa Date Created field. Do not confuse this field value with the Date Created field for the image showing this artwork or object.\n\nCirca Date Created (AO)\n\nA free text field for use where the exact date of creation of the artwork or object is unknown. An approximate date is entered in text rather than date format e.g. âca 1900', â19th century'\n\nStyle Period (AO)\n\nFree-text field for style, historical or artistic period, movement, group, or school describing the artwork or object.\n\nCreator (AO)\n\nName of the creator of the artwork or other objects in the image. Where the artist cannot or should not be identified, the name of a company or organisation may be used. Do not confuse this field value with the Creator of the image showing this artwork or object.\n\nCreator ID (AO)\n\nGlobally unique identifier for the creator of the artwork or object in the image. For example use an identifier issued by an online registry of persons or companies. Multiple IDs should be entered in the same sequence as the creator names. Do not confuse this field value with the Creator Id of the Image Creator of the image showing this artwork or object.\n\nSource (AO)\n\nName of the organisation or body that holds or has registered the artwork or object for inventory purposes.\n\nSource Inventory Number (AO)\n\nInventory number issued by the Source, for example an accession number.\n\nSource Inventory URL (AO)\n\nURL supplied by the Source for the online metadata record.\n\nCopyright Notice (AO)\n\nCopyright notice for claiming the intellectual property for the artwork or object in the image. It should identify the current owner of the copyright and associated intellectual property rights. Do not confuse this field value with the Copyright Notice of the image showing this artwork or object.\n\nCurrent Copyright Owner Name (AO)\n\nName of the current owner of the copyright in the artwork or object. Do not confuse this field value with the Name field of the Copyright Owner of the image showing this artwork or object.\n\nCurrent Copyright Owner ID (AO)\n\nA globally unique identifier for the current copyright owner e.g. issued by an online registry of persons or companies. Do not confuse this field value with the Identifier field of the Copyright Owner of the image showing this artwork or object.\n\nCurrent Licensor Name (AO)\n\nName of the current licensor of the artwork or object. Do not confuse this field value with the Name field of the Licensor of the image showing this artwork or object.\n\nCurrent Licensor ID (AO)\n\nA globally unique identifier for the current licensor e.g. issued by an online registry of persons or companies. Do not confuse this field value with the Identifier field of the Licensor of the image showing this artwork or object.\n\nAddress (CCI)\n\nThe address field is a multi-line field. Enter the street name and number or postbox to which mail should be sent, and a company name or location (building name, floor number) if necessary.\n\nCity (CCI)\n\nThe name of the city in which the primary contact’s business is located.\n\nState/ Province (CCI)\n\nThe State or Province in which the primary contact’s business is located. For clarity, it is best to use the full name rather than the abbreviation.\n\nPostal Code (CCI)\n\nThe local postal code (such as ZIP code) in which the primary contact’s business is located.\n\nCountry (CCI)\n\nThe name of the country (or ISO Country Code) in which the primary contact’s business is located.\n\nPhone(s) (CCI)\n\nThe primary contact’s business or work telephone number. Multiple numbers can be given, separated by a comma. Be sure to include the complete international format of a phone number which is: +{countrycode} ({regional code}) {phone number} - {extension if required} e.g. +1 (212) 1234578\n\nEmail(s) (CCI)\n\nThe primary contact’s business or work email address, such as name@domain.com. Multiple email addresses can be given, separated by a comma.\n\nWebsite(s) (CCI)\n\nThe URL or web address for the primary contact’s business. Multiple addresses can be given, separated by a comma.\n\nCreator\n\nFor displaying the creator of the image, the Creator field is read and shown with the label Creator. Google first reads the ISO XMP dc:creator field, and if that is empty, then the IPTC IIM 2:80 Creator field. Your editing tool probably just gives you a single field labelled \"creator\" so just use that and you won’t have to worry.\n\nBy its definition this field contains \"the name of the photographer, but in cases where the photographer should not be identified the name of a company or organisation may be appropriate.\"\n\nCopyright Notice\n\nGoogle displays the Copyright Notice field (XMP dc:rights or IIM 2:116 Copyright Notice). So while you’re tidying up your image metadata it makes sense to get this right too. The definition for this field is: \"Contains any necessary copyright notice for claiming the intellectual property for artwork or an object in the image and should identify the current owner of the copyright of this work with associated intellectual property rights.\" The format can differ according to the relevant copyright legislation of different countries. Again, Google first reads the ISO XMP dc:rights field, and if that is empty, then the IPTC IIM 2.116 Copyright notice field.\n\nCredit Line\n\nThe Credit Line field (XMP photoshop:Credit or IIM 2:110 Credit) is used as \"the credit to person(s) and/or organisation(s) required by the supplier of the image to be used when published.\" Generally this would be a line of text that the supplier expects users of the image (such as Google Images) to display to users alongside the image. Again, Google first reads the ISO XMP photoshop:credit field, and if that is empty, then the IPTC IIM 2.110 Credit field.\n\nMost tools label this field as \"Credit Line\" in the editing interface, but some tools call it simply \"Credit\"."
