        "text": "This month, we officially publicly launch our exhibition on access to justice: ‘Ten Years (In)Justice: an exhibition of art and stories from the front lines of the failing civil justice system’.\n\nThe exhibition will be held at the Manchester Museum on Saturday 13 and Sunday 14 January 2024 on their beautiful top floor in the Social Justice Hub. The address of the venue is Manchester Museum, University of Manchester, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL. The exhibition will run from 10am until 4pm on both days, and is free and open to the public.\n\nAs well as art and stories, the exhibition shares information about the state of the civil justice system and Legal Aid sector following ten years of cuts and decline – but also highlights the importance of campaigning for free access to justice.\n\nWe held our preview exhibition for members and volunteers in December 2023, and had a really successful day. The final version will feature more art and more content and will be in the scenic setting of the Museum’s top floor."
