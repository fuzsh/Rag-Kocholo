        "text": "We are looking for YOUR ideas about sessions for #NEMA2024! The theme of this year's conference, taking place November 6-8 in Newport, RI is \"We the Museum: Toward a 'More Perfect' Vision for our Changing World.\" As we approach America‚Äôs 250th anniversary, now is a time to reflect on both the origin of America‚Äôs museums, and consider the field not only in its current state, but where it has grown from the past, and what it can be in the future. Just as America was by no means perfect at its inception, neither was the museum field. While the U.S. Constitution seeks a ‚Äúmore perfect union,‚Äù how can we work towards a ‚Äúmore perfect‚Äù museum world? How can we be better, if perfection is out of reach? Do you have a great idea for a session unrelated to the conference theme? We want to hear those too! Submit your session proposals by March 29, 2024. Click here for details: https://ow.ly/RxM150QQmvz\n\nAs we embrace a future where spatial computing becomes mainstream, the role of Augmented Reality (AR) in mobile apps is pivotal. At Snap Inc., we're at the forefront of this revolution, leveraging AR to transform how we interact with the world around us. üåü Snap's AR capabilities are not just advanced; they are setting new standards in the industry. With CameraKit, these innovative AR features are readily accessible, making it easier than ever for businesses and users to integrate AR into their daily digital experiences. The practical applications of AR are vast and varied, enhancing everything from shopping experiences to social interactions. By adopting Snap's AR technology, businesses can offer more engaging, interactive, and personalized experiences to their customers. üîç Imagine trying on clothes virtually, visualizing ancient Rome in your home, or even interactive learning experiences - all made possible with AR. Let's not just think about the future; let's build it. The integration of AR in mobile apps is a significant step towards a world rich with spatial computing. And with Snap's AR capabilities, we are not just ready for this future; we're leading it. #AugmentedReality #SpatialComputing #SnapAR #FutureTech #Innovation #MobileApps #DigitalTransformation\n\n#Legacy150: 'The Museum will not be Decolonised' conference schedule is now live https://lnkd.in/gyTEreAh Sumaya Kassim writes that ‚ÄúMuseums are not neutral in their preservation of history. In fact, arguably, they are sites of forgetfulness and fantasy‚Äù. Her discussion was based on work she and colleagues did with Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery, and it holds true of many museums throughout the UK. It is the ‚Äúforgetfulness‚Äù of the objects‚Äô lived history and the ‚Äúfantasy‚Äù of these objects being out of time that is endemic in museum spaces. In this conference we discuss objects held in non-ethnographic museums and explore what they mean as representations of human experience, how we can accurately represent their lived experience using digital technologies and their weight as political and social signifiers in the contemporary world. The conference provides a space for interested parties to discuss the ways objects are presented and their histories represented.\n\nThe Spring 2024 issue of Exhibition journal is now out. ‚ÄúAlternative Realities‚Äù surveys many ways exhibitions can question existing systems and open pathways to new and more equitable futures. At a time when what divides us can feel almost insurmountable, authors share how they are harnessing hope, challenging prevailing narratives, and upending established museum practices as they seek to reshape our vision of what is possible‚Äîwithin and beyond the museum. Exhibition is a journal of exhibition theory and practice for museum professionals published by the American Alliance of Museums.
