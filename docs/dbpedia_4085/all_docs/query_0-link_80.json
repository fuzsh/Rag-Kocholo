        "text": "The fonds consists of correspondence to and from the Directors, Keepers and curators of The Manchester Museum, pertaining to the Zoology Department of the museum (which does not include entomology). Letters largely pertain to the acquisition of specimens by the museum by donation, purchase and exchange, requests for identifications and information on specimens.\n\nThe Manchester Museum was opened in 1888, as a result of the transfer of the collections of the Manchester Natural History Society to Owens College (now the Victoria University of Manchester) in 1868; the transfer of the collections was completed in 1873. The collections grew around this nucleus, mainly as a result of donations, so as to include the Humanities. All of the collections are Designated.\n\nArranged in files in one alphabetical series by surname of correspondent or by organisation name. Series was formerly arranged alphabetically in files in two boxes (A-J, K-Z). The contents of these were listed in 2002, at which time unsorted items were inserted in their presumed correct place within filed. Contents of each file were sorted in chronological order. The collection was rehoused in archival storage in 2003 retaining the original alphabetical arrangement of files."
