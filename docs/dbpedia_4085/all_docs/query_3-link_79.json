        "text": "In late autumn 1940, the Blitz spread beyond London to Britain's other major towns and cities. Many were the locations of major war industries. However, it was often their compact commercial centres and residential areas that were most badly affected by air raids.\n\nLiverpool experienced its first air raid in August 1940 and was targeted regularly through the autumn of 1940 with 15 raids in September and nine in October. The first major raid came on 28 November when it was hit by 350 tons of high explosive bombs, 30 land mines and 3,000 incendiaries.\n\nThe Blitz and its vivid collection of photographs is the sixth title in the new series showcasing the best of IWMâ€™s photography collection and is available to buy from the IWM Shop.\n\nThese striking photographs tell the stories of those who experienced the Blitz and highlight the bravery and determination of civilians in wartime Britain.\n\nThe Blitz, the German bombing campaign against Britain during the Second World War, had a profound impact on London. From September 1940, the German Luftwaffe dropped some 20,000 bombs on the city, killing thousands, and leaving many more homeless. But for all its human cost, new research has revealed that the London Blitz may also have had some positive effects on the capital.\n\nLondon, Coventry, Manchester and many more were bombed. But could the Blitz have worked?\n\nIn this episode of IWM Stories, Senior Curator Ian Kikuchi answers that very question by looking at one the deadliest nights of the Blitz, the bombing of Coventry."
