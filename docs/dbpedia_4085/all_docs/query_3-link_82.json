        "text": "Since the mid-1980s, the new, socially responsive role that museums have assumed and the critically engaged positions of chief curators and directors have led to a variety of practices that attempt to break the old canon of exhibitions, to promote new and interactive ways of communicating their collections to the public and to achieve the much-desired engagement with museum objects. In this framework, artists are often invited by art and other museums (historical, archaeological, ethnographic, etc.) to display or to produce their work as artists-in-residence, creating different contexts for existing exhibitions. But what happens when contemporary artists are called to \" reorganize \" parts of a museum's permanent collection, commenting in parallel on the institution's own history and function? In our paper, we discuss curatorial projects undertaken by artists that critically assess the museum's historical role, its epistemological background and its power to legitimize culture. Artistic installations and redisplays of historical collections by artists become the focus of our inquiry, especially in the now fashionable display format of the Renaissance Wunderkammer. Our aim is to examine how artistic knowledge and practice can illuminate aspects of art-historical and museological practices, aspects which are rendered invisible when working separately in our academic fields. Keywords : curatorship and art practices; museum's epistemology; artists-as-curators; Wunderkammer If we are now living in \" Liquid Times \" as Zygmunt Bauman proposed (2000), then what are the role and the raison d'être of museums? How can these powerful by-products of an outdated modernity attract new audiences, offer new narratives using aging collections and respond to current sensitivities? How do they manage to survive as they try to come to terms with current institutional criticism of their authority and social utility? In this paper we discuss one such \" survival strategy, \" namely the curatorial projects undertaken by artists that critically assess the museum's historical role, its epistemological background and its power to legitimize culture. Our thoughts stemmed from museums' and artists' apparent fascination with a rather unexpected historicism, which is characterized by several contemporary artworks presented, in particular in museums that are not directly devoted to art. Artistic installations and new exhibitions of historical collections put on by artists become the focus of our inquiry, especially in the now fashionable display format of the Renaissance Wunderkammer. 1 ARTICLE\n\nThe theoretical and ethical debate fostered by the reflexive turn of the last decades is increasingly guided by the concern to recover a sphere of political action of the museum: activist and decolonial in nature, deeply entangled in the world and built from an intraactive engagement with it. As a consequence, the museum tends to address the emergent and the urgent through situated practices that collectively analyse and respond to circumstances in the world. In doing so, the contemporary museum seeks to create conditions for visitor engagement by empowering their unmediated voices to be heard. This text aims to explore the critical space between the apparent decolonial vitality of the museum and how diffractive practices may be designed in a postcritical and postrepresentational context, arguing that approaches based on artistic and design processes of speculative fabulation (as Design Culture) are helpful for thinking and acting in these spaces of experience, acting as a tool of philosophical enquiry, which promotes responsiveness to «know» and «do» differently in the present. Pragmatically, it highlights three modes of speculative (moderated) design engagement with the present and the future to help museums to break out of their ontological blindness and fulfil their critical and transformative potential.\n\nNew Museology does not pay attention to masterpieces. 1 One could spend hours searching for this term in the tables of contents and indexes in the ever-increasing pile of museum studies books and readers. All in vain. The celebrities in museums' collections, the warrants of the museums' popularity among the widest public, have not been included among the issues to be tackled by critical museology. Clearly, this reluctance to approach the phenomenon of the masterpiece stems from the disciplinary aims of the New Museology which is concerned with social hierarchies and exclusions rather than with the objects themselves, and which must be, programmatically, distrustful of any old claims to the universality of aesthetic values and transcendence. Not writing about masterpieces is thus tantamount to adopting a critical approach, to silence those claims. The notable absence of masterpieces in critical museum studies is more than compensated for by their excessive presence everywhere else. It is hardly worth noting that any search for the term in online library catalogues, online bookshops, not to mention the search engines, is totally unproductive, as thousands of hits appear instantly. Indeed, the word 'masterpiece' has been adopted widely and indiscriminately as a measure of perfection in all spheres of human activity, so much so that its ubiquity renders it invalid, relegating the notion from the highest realm of art to the more popular strata of culture industry. It is difficult not to notice, instead, that a significant number of 'masterpiece' books have been, and still are, produced by museums. The term features prominently not just in amply illustrated publications with the most celebrated objects from museums' collections, addressing the widest public, but also in catalogues of the major international exhibitions, aimed at professionals. Masterpieces are not given, but are constructed by the museum and academic art history textbooks and, to a large extent, by the shifting demands of popular opinion. When discussing the concept of the critical museum, the hegemony of the masterpiece in the museum world, then and now, presents one of the issues to be considered rather than bypassed. How can we reconcile the notion of the masterpiece as a privileged object in a museum's collections, and its accompanying claims to autonomy and transcendence, the licence to aesthetic worship and the burden of social exclusions 1 I would like to thank Stefan Muthesius for his help in preparation of this chapter. Special thanks are also due to the students of my 'Defining the Masterpiece' course taught at Birkbeck in 2014.\n\nThis paper explores the consequences of the \" museumization \" of a site-specific installation by the Polish-Argentinian artist Lea Lublin. 2 My interest is in the transformations that allow museums to coopt and reify works of art that were intended to take a critical stance toward the museum system; these transformations being carried out, on the one hand, in the name of conservation—preserving the work for the future—and, on the other, in the name of capital—turning an ephemeral event into a cultural commodity. If the neo-avant-garde practices of the postwar period expanded the traditional understanding of the art object to encompass performance, audience participation, and ephemeral events—often with the explicit aim of challenging the passive viewership endemic to the museum—museums have dealt with this period of art history by nevertheless crystallizing these works into objects of cultural and economic value. The result is a coming apart of the artwork as an object—one that is now, to borrow Martha Buskirk's word, not only contingent (dependent on scores, instructions, documentation, etc.), but also dispersed. As in the example I discuss here, the act of museum acquisition no longer only concerns the movement of auratic original artworks."
