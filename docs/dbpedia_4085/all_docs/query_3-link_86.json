        "text": "We were edged 2-1 by Pep Guardiola's side under the famous arch last summer and, despite also being beaten by City twice in the Premier League this term, Erik is confident that if his players perform to their highest standards, we can lift the historic trophy for the first time since 2016.\n\nSpeaking to journalists at Carrington on Thursday afternoon, Ten Hag outlined his ambitions for Saturday's showcase and reiterated his desire to finish 2023/24 with a second piece of silverware in as many years.\n\nRead on to see the best quotes from Erik's press conference...\n\nSILVERWARE IN OUR SIGHTS\n\n\"It's all about trophies and we have a huge opportunity to win a trophy. In the last 10 years [there have been] not many trophies in this club but we have an opportunity to win two trophies in two years.\"\n\nWE MUST BELIEVE\n\n\"In a season that's not [gone] our way, we are there. We have an opportunity and it will never be easy but we have to go for it and we will go for it. We have to believe it as we did last season and as we know, often against good opponents, we play our best football and I expect us to do this on Saturday.\"\n\nRASHFORD WILL BOUNCE BACK\n\n\"He looks good. A career has ups and downs and a down can also give you fuel and that is what I see in training. So he will be highly motivated and as you said, speak with your feet. He is very talented and already has a big career and I am sure he will get over this and make even more goals.\"\n\nWE EARNED THIS CHANCE\n\n\"I came here to win trophies. On Saturday, I have the next opportunity and we achieved this. We earned the opportunity as a team and now we have to go for it. In the same time, in the last two years, of course, after every season you review it and we will see where we are in the project and things we have to change. We spoke lately about it, underneath there are very good things. Players coming up, players developing, and in the same time on Saturday we have a big opportunity to win the next trophy.\""
