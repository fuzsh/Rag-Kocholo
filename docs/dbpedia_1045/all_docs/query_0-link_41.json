        "text": "Hats \"Khaki Fur Felt\" were used throughout the British Empire and were generally of similar construction and are still in use and manufacture today. The shaping of the crown (blocking) is achieved by filling the hat with water, allowing it to thoroughly soak through and then shaping it. If you are blessed, the Q-store has a wooden hat block so you can get the correct shape absolutely right on the first go (my Q-store had one but the RQMS was a precious *** and never let it be used). So the critical distinction of the blocking for British/Australian/NZ/Canadian use is really a feature of the blocking rather than actual manufacture.\n\nColour varies considerably through shades of green, browns and tan. The hat above appears more typical of British issue.\n\nThe width of the brim, much narrower for use by Gurkhas but otherwise similar for all users. So yours is not a Gurkha hat.\n\nEdge of brim, left plain or wrapped with a narrow khaki ribbon, sewn over the edge. WW2 manufacture is often the plain raw edge but earlier and latter production is usually trimmed.\n\nLiner band, the leather band and method of sewing is typical. Bands often have maker marks and year of manufacture but are often unmarked.\n\nThe Lions Head clip with braided cord for the clip is usually associated with pre-WW1. They also widely used (and still use) a stamped sheet metal clip sewn to the side of the hat with a small square ring sen to the brim, or just press studs. Press studs are common on WW2 hats.\n\nVent rivets - There is a wide variety of combination of rivets, usually 2 or 3 each side, usually copper or bronze and left plain, chemically blacked or painted.\n\nThe pugaree (hat band). A very wide variety used. The example shown is probably the most common/universal style. If you are lucky there will be makers marks and a date inside the pugaree.\n\nFrom what I can see in the photo this hat is a \"genuine\" British Empire / Commonwealth example manufactured between the 1880s and today. Most probably made in the UK for use by troops directly issued with British made uniforms (ie British troops, or use in India or Africa, rather than Australia Canada or NZ). Date is really an absolute guess - if the lions head and cord are original fittings then pre-WW1, but I have seen boxes of unissued lions head clips, so the presence of this clip is no guarantee of the early date.\n\nSorry I cannot give a definitive user group and date. Hopefully others will add their opinions.\n\nCheers\n\nRoss\n\nFirst off, thanks so much Ross and Frogsmile for your educational and very informative reply's\n\nThese hats are far from my knowledge base so any info is just brilliant, I did stumble onto an archive photo of this style of Slouch hat been worn by Kiwis during the boer war. The image below is of the Klee brothers photo borrowed from the IMCA Digital Archive it looks to have a lion clasp with leather/rope? and also a pagri, sometimes hard to tell, we often see what we want to see in old photos!\n\nI was just hoping that there might have been info or photos of Kiwis etc using this style of hat during the early part of ww1, as I know our lads wore slouch style hats before regulations passed to bash them into a Lemon squeezer.\n\nBut I will aim to get some better photos, remove the Pug to see if any date hides behind it. fingers crossed.\n\nThanks again so much for your time!\n\nThe lemon squeezer and the slouch hat are basically the same thing, its just an issue of blocking the hat.\n\nI was interested in Frogsmile's comment that the lions head hooks were repurposed cape hooks. I was not aware of that but I have hardly ever handled military capes. They are very uncommon out here, our army never particularly issued them. The Air Force (RAAF) did in WW2 to officers but even then I have not handled one of those. The Navy ones turn up occasionally.\n\nCan you give any information on where you obtained it ? Is there any provenance at all ?\n\nPart of the problem is that back in the late c19 and early c20, people were very mobile, migrating around the British Empire. My G-Grandfather was born in the Colony of NSW, took the whole family to Cape Colony in the 90s. He served in a local unit there during the Boer War and migrated back to Australia in 1910. So my G-mother was born in NSW had her childhood in Cape Town but married and lived her life here in Oz. This sort of thing creates a very confusing mess for identifying military photos and momentoes.\n\nThe \"Pagris\" or \"pugaree\" (its a Hindi word, but in Australia always corrupted to pugaree, so Frogsmile is absolutely correct for writing in the UK while I revert to my vernacular) was very widely used in the 1899-1902 Boer War. In Australia it was always used, both with colonial uniforms and after Federation by the Australian Military Forces. Australian variations include - wide strips of possum fur, woven narrow strips of possum fur (some people claim its Koala) woven cotton strips folded over like in Frogsmile's photo, woven cotton folded and seam to look like it was made from a continuous strip, a wide parallel woven wool bands and the folded cotton, with one fold of coloured cloth to give a unit, corps or branch of service designation. The continuous cotton strip folded over (Frogsmile's photo) is typical of Boer War. Yours is the cotton folded and sewn to give the appearance of a continuous strip - unfortunately that style of pugaree has been in the longest use (130 years and still going). As in my original comment, you may find a makers mark or date on the inside of the pugaree if you are lucky. Post WW2 they always seem to be marked, WW2 and earlier its very hit an miss. With the ones that are the continuous piece of cloth, never take them off the hat, as you will be at risk of them coming apart and you will never get it looking right again.\n\nWhen issued from the Q-store, the hat, the chin strap and the pugaree are each separate items of inventory. I had my first issue in 1972. A collector friend who is a lot older than me (and still going) told me how a Boer War veteran (British) told him they managed the continuous cloth pugarres. As a new recruit you went to one of the old soldiers in the unit who would wind it onto your hat or pith helmet for you, using pins to secure it in shape, and paid him with a tin of tobacco. You then carefully sewed it together. As the traditional indian garment, you could take it off, soak it in water and put it back on the hat, to keep your head cool. Thats why on early pith helmets, the winding is often about 1cm thick.\n\nCheers\n\nRoss\n\n23 hours ago, Hessian said:\n\nFirst off, thanks so much Ross and Frogsmile for your educational and very informative reply's\n\nI second that, thank you for starting the post Hessian. Very interesting for me as my Grandfather wore one of these or similar when he was with the 5th Light Horse AIF. Pictured below. I always thought the slouch hats were much thinner but it seems not. I suppose they had to be hard wearing and somewhat tough to repel water and keep off the sun. Deserts being hot in the day and cold at night, also the western front was a pretty cold and wet place. Extremely interesting to read your first hand account/experience of using them @Chasemuseum did they keep your head cool in the heat, they look as if they would keep you warm rather than cool? I suppose that the wet Pugaree helps a lot? Which would keep you cooler, slouch hat or pith helmet? Thanks for the link @FROGSMILE Time to start looking further into Grandfathers time in Australia and his time in the Great War, I have quite a bit but always good to get more. Cheers all, Bob."
