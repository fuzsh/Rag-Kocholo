        "text": "In the lead up to Remembrance Day 2014, Australia Post honoured the contribution made by our defence forces over the last century with a new stamp issue A Century of Service: The Australian Defence Force.\n\nAustralia Post Managing Director & Group CEO, Ahmed Fahour, said 2014 commemorates the centenary of World War I and this stamp issue remembers the contribution made by the Australian Defence Force (ADF).\n\n“We hope that these stamps serve as a symbol of our appreciation to those who have served and continue to serve our nation,” Mr Fahour said.\n\nChief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, AC said, “We are honoured that Australia Post is paying tribute to the men and women of the Australian Defence Force in this way.”\n\n“Whether they are in combat or on humanitarian operations, our military personnel are internationally renowned for their skill and widely respected for their professionalism.”\n\n“This stamp issue is an outstanding tribute to all those Australians who have served our nation,” said Air Chief Marshal Binskin.\n\nThe Australian Defence Force (ADF) comprises the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). The three services operated more or less independently until an integrated command structure was established with the formation of the Australian Defence Force on 9 February 1976.\n\nThe four domestic base rate (70c) stamps were designed by Tim Hancock of the Melbourne-based design studio XSD. The stamp designs are based on the caps and badges of the respective three services, with the fourth stamp depicting the Australian Defence Force Emblem.\n\nAssociated with the stamp issue is a special prestige cover. The ‘Remember Me To All’ prestige cover includes a facsimile of a pocket book carried by Private John Hector Croft of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) during the landing at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915. Croft’s life was saved when an enemy bullet lodged in the pocket book after penetrating his arm. Also included is a facsimile of a letter written by Croft describing the incident.\n\nOther products associated with this stamp issue include a miniature sheet, first day cover, stamp pack, booklet of 10 x 70c self-adhesive stamps, set of four maxicards and four designed gutter strips of 10 x 70c stamps.\n\nFurther information: A Century of Service – The Australian Defence Force\n\nAustralia has maintained military forces since shortly after Federation in January 1901, when the Australian Army and Commonwealth Naval Force were established by the amalgamation of the forces maintained by each of the states. The new Australian Army comprised 28,923 colonial soldiers, which included professional soldiers, paid militia and unpaid volunteers.\n\nThe Royal Australian Navy\n\nThe Royal Australian Navy (RAN) is the naval branch of the Australian Defence Force. Two months after the Federation of Australia in 1901, the ships and resources of the separate colonial navies were integrated into a national force, the Commonwealth Naval Forces. On 10 July 1911, King George V granted the title of Royal Australian Navy, after which the RAN became increasingly responsible for defence of the region.\n\nDuring World War I, the RAN was initially responsible for capturing many of Germany’s South Pacific colonies and protecting Australian shipping from the German East Asia Squadron. Later in the war, most of the RAN’s major ships operated as part of Royal Navy forces in the Mediterranean and North Seas.\n\nDuring the 1920s and Depression of the 1930s, the RAN was drastically reduced in size. As international tensions increased, however, the RAN was modernised and expanded. Early in World War II, RAN ships again operated as part of the British Royal Navy, and many served in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the West African coast, the Persian Gulf, and the Indian Ocean. Following the outbreak of the Pacific War and the virtual destruction of the Royal Navy force in Asia the RAN operated more independently, or as part of United States Navy forces. By the end of World War II, the RAN was the fifth-largest navy in the world.\n\nAfter World War II, the RAN saw action in many Cold War–era conflicts in the Asia-Pacific region and operated alongside the Royal Navy and United States Navy off Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam. Since the end of the Cold War, the RAN has been part of Coalition forces in the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean and has become a critical element in Australian operations in East Timor and the Solomon Islands.\n\nThe Australian Army\n\nThe Australian Imperial Force (AIF) was formed on 15 August 1914, in response to Britain declaring war on Germany, because existing militia forces were unable to serve overseas. The first commander of the AIF was General William Bridges, who also assumed direct command of the infantry division.\n\nWhen the Second World War broke out between Britain and Germany in 1939, the 2nd AIF was formed to fight in France and Major General Thomas Blamey was appointed commander. Compulsory military service was introduced; however, to ensure home defences, Militia members were barred from joining the AIF. After 1947, when a standing peacetime regular infantry force was formed, the CMF (the Militia or Citizens Military Force, known as the Army Reserve after 1980) began to decline in importance.\n\nDuring its history the Australian Army has fought a large number of major wars, including the Second Boer War (1899–1902), World War I (1914–18), World War II (1939–45), Korean War (1950–53), Malayan Emergency (1950–1960), Indonesia–Malaysia Confrontation (1962–66), Vietnam War (1962–73), and more recently in Afghanistan and Iraq. Since 1947 the Australian Army has also been involved in many peacekeeping operations, usually under the auspices of the United Nations. Australia’s largest peacekeeping deployment began in 1999 in East Timor, while other ongoing operations have included peacekeeping on Bougainville, in the Sinai, and in the Solomon Islands.\n\nThe Royal Australian Air Force\n\nThe third arm the Australian Defence Force is the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). The Army established the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) in 1912 which then separated to form the Royal Australian Air Force in March 1921. The following June, King George V approved the prefix “Royal”. The RAAF then became the second Royal air force to be formed in the British Commonwealth, following the British Royal Air Force.\n\nDuring World War I four AFC squadrons were part of the AIF and were mainly used for purposes of reconnaissance. During the Great War 175 members of the AFC lost their lives. In World War II, Australian aircrew fought in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East; over the North Atlantic, the Indian and Pacific Oceans and the Mediterranean; India, Burma, Malaya, Singapore, Thailand, China, the Netherland East Indies, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, the Philippines and Borneo. They also fought over Australia, its territories, and its approaches. In late 1944, the RAAF peaked at over 182,000 personnel and 6,200 aircraft in 61 squadrons. In 1945, Australia had the fourth-largest air force in the world (after the USA, USSR and UK). Over 215,000 men and women served between 1939 and 1945, and 9,870 RAAF personnel lost their lives, with just over half of these deaths occurring in the air war against Germany over Europe.\n\nAir Force personnel have since served with distinction in Korea, Malaya, the Indonesia–Malaysia Confrontation, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan and have had a proud peacekeeping and humanitarian role throughout the world including Bougainville, Cambodia, East Timor, Indonesia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Rwanda, Solomon Islands, Somalia and Sudan.\n\nBiography\n\nChief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, AC\n\nAir Chief Marshal Mark Binskin was born in Sydney in 1960. He joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1984 after an initial period of service with the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Air Chief Marshal Binskin’s service commenced in May 1978 and on completion of flying training was posted to fly A-4G Skyhawk aircraft. He served in VC724 and VF805 Squadrons and in January 1982 was selected as the first RAN pilot to undergo an exchange with the Royal Australian Air Force flying Mirage III aircraft. On completion of this exchange and with the disbanding of the Navy’s fixed wing capability, he joined the RAAF.\n\nAir Chief Marshal Binskin’s other flying tours include No 2 Operational Conversion Unit and No 77 Squadron at Williamtown, NSW flying Mirage and F/A-18 Hornet aircraft; training on F/A-18 aircraft with the United States Navy at VFA-125 at Lemoore, California; instructing on F-16C aircraft with the United States Air Force at 314 Tactical Fighter Training Squadron, USAF at Luke AFB, Arizona; and No 75 Squadron at Tindal, Northern Territory flying F/A-18 aircraft.\n\nHis command appointments include Commanding Officer of No 77 Squadron at Williamtown, Commander of Air Combat Group (F/A-18, F-111, Hawk and PC9-A(F)) and later as Air Commander Australia. Air Chief Marshal Binskin’s flying qualifications include Fighter Combat Instructor and Tactical Reconnaissance Pilot. Additionally, he has served as the RAAF F/A-18 Hornet Demonstration Pilot. He has over 3,500 hours in single-seat fighter aircraft.\n\nAir Chief Marshal Binskin has served in various joint staff positions including Staff Officer to the Chief of Defence Force and in the Defence Materiel Organisation as Officer Commanding the Airborne Early Warning and Control System Program Office.\n\nDuring Australia’s 2003 contribution to the war in Iraq, Air Chief Marshal Binskin served as Chief of Staff at Headquarters Australian Theatre. Following this, he served as the Director of the US Central Air Force Combined Air and Space Operations Centre where he was responsible for the conduct of Coalition air operations in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom (ADF Operations Catalyst and Slipper). For this service he was awarded a Commendation for Distinguished Service.\n\nAir Chief Marshal Binskin is a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC). He has also been recognised by the Republic of Korea with the Order of National Security Merit, Gukseon Medal; and the Republic of Singapore with the Meritorious Service Medal (Military) Air Chief Marshal Binskin is a graduate of the Harvard Business School Advanced Management Program, Australian Institute of Company Directors and RAAF Command and Staff Course where he was awarded the Chief of Staff’s Prize for Professional Excellence.\n\nAir Chief Marshal Binskin was Chief of the Air Force from 2008-2011, Vice Chief of the Defence Force from 2011-14 and was appointed as Chief of the Defence Force on 30 June 2014.\n\nAir Chief Marshal Binskin is married to Gitte and they have two sons. Air Chief Marshal Binskin’s interests include flying, most motor sports and motorcycle riding with his family.\n\nRoles and responsibilities\n\nThe Chief of the Defence Force has primary responsibility for the command of the Australian Defence Force (ADF). This role arises directly from section 9(2) of the Defence Act 1903, whereby the Chief of the Defence Force commands the ADF under direction of the Minister.\n\nThe Chief of the Defence Force is also the principal military adviser to the Minister and provides advice on matters that relate to military activity, including military operations.\n\nSource: defence.gov.au/CDF\n\nThis article was produced at the time of publication and will not be updated."
