        "text": "I am excited to share with you the release of my new Art Works titled \"Suddhi Vinayaka\" on September 8'th, 2021.\n\nWe are living in a very polluted world with the pollutants affecting our environment and we are getting suffocated due to bad air in our cities. Air pollution is impacting the monsoon in India and we are at a risk of losing 10-15% of average mean rainfall in the coming years. New Government data points to dangerous groundwater pollution levels in Punjab. Concentrations of tiny deadly particles in New Delhi's air regularly exceed safety limits by up to 20 times. Such news reports coming everyday frightens us and we wonder what can be done?\n\nLord Ganesha is well known for his sharp intelligence, wit and he is also called Vignnaharta, the one who takes away all the problems and pain of mankind. So in my new Art series I have conceived of this Ganesha to come and show us how to keep planet Earth free from such pollution. My art form is in the traditional Mandala style and I have tried to address the Air, Environmental, Noise pollutions.\n\nRajasthan with its deep-rooted culture and traditions boasts of a rich culture with a story around every corners. My art and story in this new painting series is about the artistic people of this land, the art found in the rural areas, in their attire, architecture, bazaars and rituals. I connect so well with the people of this land who incorporate colors into their daily lives, the turbans and sarees they use to decorate every facet of their lives. They follow the age-old traditions spanning thousands of years and I am mesmerized with the whole rainbow of colors they use in their daily lives.\n\nhis is an attempt by these two artists to tell the story of the worship of Goddess Durga through their own style and medium and a confluence of both to come up with a unique experience for the audience. Artist Rashmi, who works with oils, acrylics to create her art works portrays the circle of life representing a Mandala depicting the worship of Goddess Durga, who is invoked and worshipped during the Navratri festival in the whole of India in different forms and names. In Bengal she is called Durga and worshipped with the beating of drums, blowing of the conch shells and the rhythmic Dhunuchi dances by her worshippers. In the South she comes forth as nine different Devis and worshipped over nine days. These events happen every year and the festivities are performed with great fervor and sacred hymns are chanted to worship her. This all can be compared to a Mandala with an individual at the center and around which revolves the yearâ€™s events and experiences. Goddess Durga is the epitome of Shakti and every woman represents Durga in her own way and with her internal strength she can conquer everything. This collaboration is about realizing the divinity within. Artist Veena will synchronize her dance movements to bring out the Mandala in the worship of the Shakti, which is inherent in all women."
