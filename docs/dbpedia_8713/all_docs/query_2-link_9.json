        "text": "I occasionally get pinged by grads looking for inspiration for a software engineering PhD. My advice: work as a software engineer for a couple of years. While you're asking \"What can I research in this field?\" we're often asking \"How is there not any good research on this?\" It also brings the extra benefit of having a PhD in a subject you actually understand. (You might even decide a PhD isn't worth the effort, especially if you get involved with hiring.)\n\nHi everyone!! I am sharing my on-campus #placement experience. My Background: I have experience in machine learning (specifically computer vision). I also did a little competitive programming in my 2nd year of college, so I applied for some software roles. Although I am not an expert in DSA and competitive programming, given my CGPA and resume, I was shortlisted for interviews by several companies like #Google #Microsoft #Deshaw #Media.net #Qualcomm #Olaelectric #Plutus #Hilabs #Dolat #Javis #Inito #SuperAGI for different roles (#software, #research, #quant, #datascience). I gave interviews for only 2 companies (Google and Microsoft). Google: There were 3 rounds of interviews Round 1: 45 min (DSA: Array) + 15 min (Googleyness and leadership) (difficulty: leetcode easy+medium) Round 2: 45 min (DSA: DP) + 15 min (Googleyness and leadership) (difficulty: leetcode medium+hard) Round 3: 45 min (DSA: DP on trees) (difficult: leetcode medium+medium) All DSA questions had follow-up questions. Microsoft: There were mainly 2 rounds of interviews. Round 1: DSA: Graphs (modified connected components) and Trees (right view) (difficulty: leetcode medium) Round 2: Projects, Oops and Problem-solving Round 3: They liked some of my projects and discussed them in detail in this round. Finally, I got SWE offers from both Google and Microsoft.

And YES, I achieved my goal, eventually! However, I’ve seen many working professionals like me who plan to make a switch but give-up half-way because: - They get overwhelm with the Syllabus to cover - Feel demotivated & depressed - And those who pick-up get inconsistent due to busy work-life So, here’s what helped me make a great switch from Software Engineering to Data Science: 1. Making a Structured Plan & Timeline: Like, since, my target was Data Scientists Role or ML Engineer role, for each of them I kept a timeline and tried to cover the topics within that time-frame. 2. I began by polishing my basics concepts of ML, Computer Vision & NLP along with Maths & Stats. 3. Since, Data Science also includes coding as well, I made sure to Practice DSA every single day. For this Leetcode came in handy. Make sure to practice Medium problems since, these are mostly asked. 4. Lastly, I moved to Advanced topics of my interest like Generative AI models, LLMs, etc.. Not just this I focused on building my resume strong by working on Projects. Following all this Consistently helped me achieve my target at the end. However if you’re a working professionals and are struggling to cover everything along, I’d suggest letting the veterans at Bosscoder Academy, help you. Check them here: https://bit.ly/4auWuW8 They can help you with - ✅ Structured curriculum to learn Machine Learning, Generative AI, Data Visualization and more. ✅ Personal Guidance from Data Analysts / Scientists working in Google, Samsung etc. ✅ Multiple projects for SQL, Python etc. to build portfolio. P.S. Personal Placement Support also provided. #datascience #collab #upskill #cse #iit #dsa\n\nThis question was asked by Microsoft company: 1775. Equal Sum Arrays With Minimum Number of Operations You are given two arrays of integers nums1 and nums2, possibly of different lengths. The values in the arrays are between 1 and 6, inclusive. In one operation, you can change any integer's value in any of the arrays to any value between 1 and 6, inclusive. Return the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of values in nums1 equal to the sum of values in nums2. Return -1 if it is not possible to make the sum of the two arrays eq class Solution: def minOperations(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int: sum1 = sum(nums1) sum2 = sum(nums2) if sum1==sum2: return 0 if sum1<sum2: nums1,nums2 = nums2,nums1 sum1,sum2 = sum2,sum1 diff = sum1-sum2 li = [] for num in nums1: if num>1: li.append(num-1) for num in nums2: if num<6: li.append(6-num) li.sort(reverse=True) ans = 0 for i in li: diff-=i ans +=1 if diff<=0: return ans return -1 Reason to consider me: · Internship experience · 2100+ on Leetcode · Expert at Codeforces · 2100+ on CodeChef · 10+ Project (Web Development + Data Science and Machine Learning) · Final year student from BITS Pilani · 2 Thesis (Mathematical Optimization and Machine Learning) #TechJobs #HiringNow #TechCareers #DataScience #MachineLearning #SoftwareEngineering #ITJobs #TechTalent #JobSearch #CareerOpportunities #MAANGJobs #BigTechJobs #TechRecruitment #GoogleCareers #TechHiring #EngineeringJobs Video Solution:\n\n🔑 Key to Success: Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)! 🔑 Hey everyone! 🌟 We all want to grow and succeed in our careers. But there's one area many of us, especially in Pakistan, often overlook - Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Why is DSA important? 🚀 Boosts Problem-Solving Skills: Helps you think critically and solve complex problems efficiently. 🛠️ Foundational Knowledge: Essential for understanding advanced computer science concepts. 🎯 Job Opportunities: Many top tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook prioritize DSA knowledge in their interviews. 📈 Career Growth: Mastering DSA can lead to higher salaries and better job roles. Let me share a personal experience: I recently interviewed for a Software Development Engineer II (SDE II) position at Amazon. In the second round, I faced a challenging problem that I couldn't solve. This made me realize how crucial DSA is, even for experienced developers. Let's change this! 💪 📚 Start Learning: Use free resources like online courses, YouTube tutorials, and coding platforms (LeetCode, HackerRank). 🧑🤝🧑 Join Study Groups: Collaborate with friends and colleagues to learn together. 💡 Practice Regularly: Dedicate a little time each day to practice coding challenges. Let's focus more on DSA and take our skills to the next level. Together, we can make a difference! 🌍✨ #Developers #DSA #Coding #Pakistan #CareerGrowth #TechCommunity #Amazon #AWS\n\nAt Dropbox, we’ve long believed in AI’s potential to completely transform knowledge work and it’s why we’ve invested in these areas to create solutions that enhance our users productivity.
