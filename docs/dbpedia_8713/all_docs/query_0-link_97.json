        "text": "On August 3, cries of “Inquilab Zindabad” and “we are workers, not your slaves” filled Freedom Park in Bengaluru as the Karnataka State IT/ITeS Employees Union (KITU) protested against a proposed amendment to the Karnataka Shops and Commercial Establishment Act. This amendment seeks to increase the working hours from the current 10 hours per day (including overtime) to 14 hours (including overtime).\n\nKey Figures and Concerns\n\nVJK Nair, president of KITU, presented a memorandum to the Additional Labour Commissioner, G Manjunath. Nair condemned the “hire and fire” policy in the industry and called for assured compensation for laid-off workers. The Additional Labour Commissioner acknowledged the high levels of emotional and physical stress faced by IT sector workers, which has increased the need for counseling and psychiatric consultations in Bengaluru. He emphasized the importance of a healthy work-life balance and promised to bring the issue to the government’s attention.\n\nVoices from the Protest\n\nSuhas Adiga, general secretary of KITU, declared that IT employees in Bengaluru are prepared to resist the proposed law. “We have gathered here, we will resist, and we will show them that the working class of Karnataka cannot be messed with,” he said.\n\nRashmi Choudary, vice president of KITU, highlighted the detrimental impact the proposed amendment would have on women in the workforce. She noted that the increased working hours would severely limit time for upskilling and preparing for promotions, ultimately leading to job loss under the guise of inadequate skills. She shared personal stories of workers affected by current practices, including a single mother from West Bengal who was fired for taking leaves to care for her chronically ill son.\n\nHealth Risks and Broader Implications\n\nKITU representatives cited a World Health Organization (WHO) report stating that working 55 or more hours per week is associated with a 35% higher risk of stroke and a 17% higher risk of dying from ischemic heart disease compared to working 35-40 hours a week. This underscores the potential health risks posed by the proposed increase in working hours.\n\nSupport from Other Unions\n\nThe protest received support from the Union of IT and ITES Employees (UNITE) from Tamil Nadu, indicating solidarity among tech workers across states. Representatives from UNITE assured that similar unions from other states stand with KITU in their fight against the proposed amendment.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe proposed amendment to the Karnataka Shops and Commercial Establishment Act has faced strong opposition from tech workers and workers’ unions led by KITU. The protest at Freedom Park is part of ongoing resistance, including gate meetings and street campaigns across Bengaluru, aiming to protect workers’ rights and well-being. As the debate continues, the voices of Karnataka’s IT workforce resonate, demanding a balance between work and life that safeguards their health and future."
