Derived from Sanskrit, one of the oldest languages in the world, Reshmi was likely used to emphasize the desired qualities of gentleness and elegance in a person. The use of such names was not just limited to personal identification but also as a means of invoking specific attributes or blessings upon the bearer.\n\nAs the Indian subcontinent evolved through various historical periods, including the Vedic age, Maurya and Gupta empires, and the medieval period, the name Reshmi continued to be used and revered.
