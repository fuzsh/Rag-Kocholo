An Evaluation Committee consisting of Mayor Janice S.

A two year contract beginning May 16, 2016 with renewal options was awarded based on the fact that the IXP proposal offers long term cost savings, improved operational efficiencies and financial predictability over the period of a five year agreement and offers these benefits while bringing improved service levels and increased staffing. The Township noted:\n\nThe IXP proposal results in a direct budget savings and revenue addition of $607,101 over five years.

The 10 existing movie theater screens will remain open as they are. CentraState anticipates opening the new medical facility by the end of 2016. The theater history is: Starplex Cinemas acquired the former East Windsor Multiplex in December 2013, purchasing 10 of the existing 15 theaters. Headquartered in Dallas, Texas, Starplex Cinemas at that time operated 40 theaters and 313 screens in 11 states, including East Brunswick and Ridgefield Park in New Jersey. In late 2014, Starplex undertook significant seating upgrades to larger reclining leather seats with additional room between the aisles, which work was completed by March 2015. AMC Entertainment had announced plans to acquire Starplex movie theaters, but the U.S. Department of Justice and the Connecticut attorney general's office brought an anti-trust complaint stating that the deal could harm competition because AMC and Starplex are rivals in the movie exhibition business in and around East Windsor, NJ and Berlin, CT, and that this rivalry spurs each to improve the quality of its theaters and keeps ticket prices in check. In a negotiated settlement, AMC was permitted to proceed if it divested the East Windsor theater as well as the Starplex theater in Berlin, CT, to an approved buyer. Carmike Cinemas purchased the two theaters, including the East Windsor movie theater. Carmike Cinemas, based in Columbus, Georgia, stated that the deal with AMC Entertainment brings Carmike's total number of theaters to 275, with 2,942 screens in 41 states.\n\nTownship Accepting Applications from Residents for Participation in the 2016 East Windsor Community Garden.

Thus, the 2016 municipal tax rate componentremains the same for four consecutive years, at the rate of 43 cents per $100 of assessed valuation for 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013. This means that for the average current residential assessment of $258,052, the 2016 municipal tax is $1120. The East Windsor municipal component remains at less than 15% of the total local property tax bill, and is among the lowest amounts in the entire region and well below the statewide average. The 2016 municipal tax levy also is well below the available state cap levy amounts. The fiscally conservative budget document also will continue to deliver a very high quality level of services to residents. The NO TAX INCREASEmunicipal budget is a result of the Township's commitment to continually seek out additional efficiencies, cooperative purchasing avenues and service sharing opportunities, a low debt level, and pro-active efforts to carefully plan and to closely monitor expenditures and revenues throughout the year.\n\nTownship Accepting Applications from Residents for Participation in the 2016 East Windsor Community Garden.
