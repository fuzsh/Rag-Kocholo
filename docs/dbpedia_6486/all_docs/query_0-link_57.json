In Florence the couple lived in the palace in the Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore, now the Banca Popolare di Milano. Notes and Queries placed her tomb a hundred years ago as visible in Sector E.\n\nHenry Adams' sister. Her death from tetanus in Bagni di Lucca is described in the 'Chaos' chapter of his autobiography The Education of Henry Adams:\n\nHe had been some weeks in London when he received a telegram from his brother-in-law at the Bagni di Lucca telling him that his sister had been thrown from a cab and injured, and that he had better come on. He started that night, and reached the Bagni di Lucca on the second day. Tetanus had already set in.\n\nThe last lesson,the sum and term of education,began then. He had passed through thirty years of rather varied experience without having once felt the shell of custom broken. He had never seen nature,only her surface,the sugar-coating that she shows to youth. Flung suddenly in his face, with the harsh brutality of chance, the terror of the blow stayed by him thenceforth for life, until repetition made it more than the will could struggle with; more than he could call on himself to bear. He found his sister, a woman of forty, as gay and brilliant in the terrors of lock-jaw as she had been in the careless fun of 1859, lying in bed in consequence of a miserable cab-accident that had bruised her foot. Hour by hour the muscles grew rigid, while the mind remained bright, until after ten days of fiendish torture she died in convulsion.\n\nOne had heard and read a great deal about death, and even seen a little of it, and knew by heart the thousand commonplaces of religion and poetry which seemed to deaden ones senses and veil the horror. Society being immortal, could put on immortality at will. Adams being mortal, felt only the mortality. Death took features altogether new to him, in these rich and sensuous surroundings. Nature enjoyed it, played with it, the horror added to her charm, she liked the torture, and smothered her victim with caresses. Never had one seen her so winning. The hot Italian summer brooded outside, over the market-place and the picturesque peasants, and, in the singular color of the Tuscan atmosphere, the hills and vineyards of the Apennines seemed bursting with mid-summer blood. The sick-room itself glowed with the Italian joy of life; friends filled it; no harsh northern lights pierced the soft shadows; even the dying woman shared the sense of the Italian summer, the soft, velvet air, the humor, the courage, the sensual fulness of Nature and man. She faced death, as women mostly do, bravely and even gaily, racked slowly to unconsciousness, but yielding only to violence, as a soldier sabred in battle. For many thousands of years, on these hills and plains, Nature had gone on sabring men and women with the same air of sensual pleasure.\n\nImpressions like these are not reasoned or catalogued in the mind; they are felt as part of violent emotion; and the mind that feels them is a different one from that which reasons; it is thought of a different power and a different person. The first serious consciousness of Natures gesture,her attitude towards life,took form then as a phantasm, a nightmare, an insanity of force. For the first time, the stage-scenery of the senses collapsed; the human mind felt itself stripped naked, vibrating in a void of shapeless energies, with resistless mass, colliding, crushing, wasting, and destroying what these same energies had created and labored from eternity to perfect. Society became fantastic, a vision of pantomime with a mechanical motion; and its so-called thought merged in the mere sense of life, and pleasure in the sense. The usual anodynes of social medicine became evident artifice. Stoicism was perhaps the best; religion was the most human; but the idea that any personal deity could find pleasure or profit in torturing a poor woman, by accident, with a fiendish cruelty known to man only in perverted and insane temperaments, could not be held for a moment. For pure blasphemy, it made pure atheism a comfort. God might be, as the Church said, a Substance, but He could not be a Person.\n\nWith nerves strained for the first time beyond their power of tension, he slowly travelled northwards with his friends, and stopped for a few days at Ouchy to recover his balance in a new world; for the fantastic mystery of coincidences had made the world, which he thought real, mimic and reproduce the distorted nightmare of his personal horror. He did not yet know it, and he was twenty years in finding it out; but he had need of all the beauty of the Lake below and of the Alps above, to restore the finite to its place. For the first time in his life, Mont Blanc for a moment looked to him what it was,a chaos of anarchic and purposeless forces,and he needed days of repose to see it clothe itself again with the illusions of his senses, the white purity of its snows, the splendor of its light, and the infinity of its heavenly peace. Nature was kind; Lake Geneva was beautiful beyond itself, and the Alps put on charms real as terrors; but man became chaotic, and before the illusions of Nature were wholly restored, the illusions of Europe suddenly vanished, leaving a new world to learn.\n\nOn July 4, all Europe had been in peace; on July 14, Europe was in full chaos of war. One felt helpless and ignorant, but one might have been king or kaiser without feeling stronger to deal with the chaos. Mr. Gladstone was as much astounded as Adams; the Emperor Napoleon was nearly as stupefied as either, and Bismarck: himself hardly knew how he did it. As education, the outbreak of the war was wholly lost on a man dealing with death hand-to-hand, who could not throw it aside to look at it across the Rhine. Only when he got up to Paris, he began to feel the approach of catastrophe. Providence set up no affiches to announce the tragedy. Under ones eyes France cut herself adrift, and floated off, on an unknown stream, towards a less known ocean. Standing on the curb of the Boulevard, one could see as much as though one stood by the side of the Emperor or in command of an army corps. The effect was lurid. The public seemed to look on the war, as it had looked on the wars of Louis XIV and Francis I, as a branch of decorative art. The French, like true artists, always regarded war as one of the fine arts. Louis XIV practiced it; Napoleon I perfected it; and Napoleon III had till then pursued it in the same spirit with singular success. In Paris, in July, 1870, the war was brought out like an opera of Meyerbeer. One felt ones self a supernumerary hired to fill the scene. Every evening at the theatre the comedy was interrupted by order, and one stood up by order, to join in singing the Marseillaise to order.\n\nIt was senseless, too, that Louise Kuhn's tomb seemed to be lost. Then it was discovered leaning, abandoned after an attempted robbery for its marble, against a wall so that its inscription was hidden. Daniel-Claudiu Dumitrescu and Nicolae Ovrei, under the direction of Alberto Casciani, next reconstructed it in its original place, known from the description a hundred years ago in Notes and Queries, moving the great octagonal base a great distance using the same methods as had Renaissance stone masons when raising the Obelisk at St Peters, with ropes and pulleys, no internal combustion engines, and then the damaged drum, into position, following having constructed a firm base in cement. Following this received funding to reconstruct the marble cross to replace the original one which was stolen, and for restoring the damaged surfaces of the drum.\n\nWhen Henry Adams' wife, Clover Adams, committed suicide from drinking photographic developing fluid, Henry had her magnificent tomb sculpted by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, now conserved in the Smithsonian Museum, alongside of sculptures by Hiram Powers, Edmonia Lewis and William Wetmore Story:\n\nGaudens' Clover Adams Edmonia Lewis' Cleopatra William Wetmore Story's Libyan Sibyl\n\nRestauro, consolidamento e pulitura, Daniel-Claudiu Dumitrescu, 2016-2017.

Katerine Gaja, Firenze, 2004.\n\nB12-13I/ B8/ 737/ ELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING/ JAMAICA/ENGLAND\n\nI have written elsewhere on Elizabeth Barrett Browning, especially in the notes to our edition for Penguin of Aurora Leigh and Other Poems, but also in the essay on her death and burial, ebbdeath.html of which the following excerpt is relevant to this virtual e-book on our tombs.\n\nIn her last letter, which breaks off unfinished, Robert halting it, we witness exhaustion (Kenyon, II.448-450).\n\nIn 1860, posing with her son Penini, she could still smile.\n\nThe terrible last photographs taken in Rome show her with emaciated deathhead, despite the crinoline and curls. In 1861, the year of her death, we see a prematurely aged Corinne in front of a painted backdrop of Rome's Colosseum (Arabella II.533). She was only fifty-five, though pretending to the even younger forty-five, and having packed into those years the writing of an epic poem longer than Homer's Odyssey, marriage, and a son. In May of that year, Hans Christian Andersen visited them, commenting on how ill Elizabeth looked (Arabella II.536). Her last poem, 'North and South', was about him, for the children played with Robert his Pied Piper of Hamelyn, processing through the rooms, and listened to Andersen's Ugly Duckling. But between these two dates, 1860-1861, is also the publication of her poem, 'A Musical Instrument'. Robert felt Elizabeth's poetic gift had ended, saying to her brother George in a letter written from Asolo, 22 October, 1889, 'the publication of \"Aurora Leigh\" preceded by five years the death of its writer - who was never likely to produce such another work', he being her literary agent during their marriage and following her death. But one of those last disparaged works was illustrated by Frederic Leighton for the Cornhill Magazine and this poem, 'A Musical Instrument', is of interest as a meta-poem, a statement about her poetic craft and her marriage. It is also a poem in which Elizabeth takes up a theme she has often used before, drawing on her classical and Christian learning, on the 'Great God Pan'. Pan, we recall, is that chimaera, part beast, part man, related to centaurs, satyrs and fauns, EBB speaking of Flush as 'Faunus', and echoing Milton on the death of the pagan Gods in 'The Morning of Christ's Nativity', both borrowing from Plutarch's 'De oraculorum defectu', in her 'Great Pan is Dead', and the Hawthornes noting that Robert is the Faun, Donatello, of the Marble Faun. This is Frederic Lord Leighton's fine illustration from the July 1860 Cornhill Magazine:\n\nAnd this is Elizabeth's poem, \"A Musical Instrument\" that it illustrates:\n\nWhiteSilence\n\nWhat was he doing, the great god Pan,\n\nDown in the reeds by the river?\n\nSpreading ruin and scattering ban, Splashing and paddling with hoofs of a goat, And breaking the golden lilies afloat\n\nWith the dragon-fly on the river.\n\nHe tore out a reed, the great god Pan,\n\nFrom the deep cool bed of the river:\n\nThe limpid water turbidly ran, And the broken lilies a-dying lay, And the dragon-fly had fled away,\n\nEre he brought it out from the river.\n\nHigh on the shore sat the great god Pan\n\nWhile turbidly flowed the river;\n\nAnd hacked and hewed as a great god can, With his hard bleak steel at the patient reed, Till there was not a sign of the leaf indeed\n\nTo prove it fresh from the river.\n\nHe cut it short, did the great god Pan,\n\n(How tall it stood in the river!)\n\nThen drew the pith, like the heart of man Steadily from the outside ring, And notched the poor dry empty thing\n\nIn holes, as he sat by the river.\n\n. . .\n\nYet half a beast is the great god Pan,\n\nTo laugh as he sits by the river,\n\nMaking a poet out of a man: The true gods sigh for the cost and pain, - For the reed which grows nevermore again\n\nAs a reed with the reeds in the river.\n\nThe verse about cutting the reed evokes The Runaway Slave at Pilgrim Point and the slashing at the sugar cane by slaves with their machetes. Robert, at Bagni di Lucca, would similarly swim in the river, at the time she had shyly presented him her superlative love Sonnets - which he immediately published, the best-selling Sonnets from the Portuguese. In Pythagorean teaching there are two kinds of musical instruments, the harp, which is Reason, and the wind instrument, which is Nature, about the world of procreation and sexuality. Yet in this poem Elizabeth seems to be speaking of her life and its thwarted sexuality as a sacrifice - which is killing her - for the sake of her art. We recall after five pregnancies, four of which ended in miscarriages, sex had to be given up. The poem is very close indeed in its verbal echoes to her magnificent translation of Apuleius' 'Cupid and Psyche', this section where Pan rescues Psyche from her suicidal despair, telling her to love innocently. We recall Elizabeth was a fine Classical and Hebrew scholar. But if so it is now re-written away from the Apuleian version towards that in Ovid, where Pan seeks to rape a nymph, who becomes a reed, which he then mutilates for his instrument upon which to play.\n\nShe leaves further clues about this poem's meaning. Thomas Adolphus Trollope in What I Remember (II. 175-179), his delightful gossipy book about the Anglo-Florentines, describes finding enclosed amongst Isa Blagden(B42)'s letters,\n\nWhiteSilence\n\none from Mrs Browning which is of the highest interest. . . . 'Dearest Isa, - Very gentle my critic is; I am glad I got him out of you. But tell dear Mr Trollope he is wrong nevertheless\n\n. . . There is an inward reflection and refraction of the heats of life . . . doubling pains and pleasures, doubling therefore the motives (passions) of life. I have said something of this in Aurora Leigh. Also there is a passion for essential truth (as apprehended) and a necessity for speaking it out at all risks, inconvenient to personal peace. Add to this and much else the loss of the sweet unconscious cool privacy among the 'reeds' . . . which I care so much for - the loss of the privilege of being glad or sorry, ill or well, without a 'notice.' . . . Yes! and be sure, Isa, that the 'true gods sigh' and have reason to sigh, for the cost and pain of it; sigh only . . . don't haggle over the cost; don't grudge a crazia, but . . . sigh, sigh . . . while they pay honestly. . . . But he is a beast up to the waist; yes, Mr Trollope, a beast. He is not a true god. And I am neither god nor beast, if you please - only a\n\nBa\n\nElizabeth's comment about the 'passion for essential truth (as apprehended) and a necessity for speaking it out at all risks, inconvenient to personal peace' is in reference to the Greek concept she well knew of parrhesia, the obligation to speak the truth, at personal risk, for the common good, so closely related to eleutheria, to freedom. This is the classic principle, discussed by I.F. Stone in The Trial of Socrates and by Michel Foucault in a lecture he gave at the University of Colorado, Boulder, shortly before his death, a concept lived today by Daniel Ellsberg, Julian Assange, Bradley Manning and Edward Snowden.\n\nWe can see that Frederic Leighton, friend to both Robert and Elizabeth, has brilliantly understood her poem in his engraving. When Leighton in the following year was to design Elizabeth's tomb he seems not to refer to Pan or to the other chimaera, but instead only to have it abound with harps, Greek, Hebrew and Christian, in reference to her great learning from her early childhood in Classics. the Bible and theology. Yet his first and Greek harp has two opposing faces, one serene, the other distorted, which at first I thought were meant for Tragedy and Comedy though I was uneasy about that identification. Then, one morning, we visited the Giardino Torrigiani in Florence, close to Casa Guidi, where Elizabeth would visit and which Leighton would have known from his student days at the Accademia delle Belle Arti, where Isa Blagden and Frederic Tennyson, the Poet Laureate's brother, would stay. And there is the god Pan, a bust upon a stele, one side of his face distorted, the other serene, the two profiles to be seen again on the Leighton harp. While on the stele are garlands about panpipes cut from a reed from a river bed.\n\nTowards the end Elizabeth is deeply affected by her sister Henrietta's death from cancer, then that of Cavour's. Robert is wanting to see his father and sister, living in Paris (his father had lost a legal suit for breach of promise to marry a widow following the death of his wife, forcing the family to live on the Continent in exile for him to avoid prison). Elizabeth's doctor, the Pole, Gresanowsky, warns Robert in Rome that Elizabeth by no means may make this journey to Paris and Elizabeth writes sadly to Arabella, 11 June, with this news (II.536-538), concerned for its effect on Robert. She had hoped her brothers could come to meet them there. (One wonders why Robert's father and sister and Elizabeth's brothers and sister did not come to visit her at Casa Guidi, given her frailty.) Then, on 15 June, she again writes to Arabella, with more vivacity and a long discourse on Christianity, includingspeaking of her opposition to dogmas such as the XXXIX Articles of the Church of England (II.541-542). A Dissenter from the Church of England, she had already had her son baptised by Pastor Droin of the Swiss Evangelical Reformed Church in Florence.\n\nLilian Whiting would write Kate Field's biography, composing it from her letters, publishing it in Boston in 1900 as Kate Field: A Record. This is the eye-witness account Kate, the young American journalist, gave in two letters written to her aunt concerning Elizabeth Barrett Browning's death and burial:\n\nFlorence, June 29th, 1861\n\nI am sick, sick at heart, for dear Mrs. Browning is dead. The news was as sudden as it is dreadful, for though she has been quite ill for a week past, yet her health has always been so feeble that I firmly believed she would rally as of yore. . . Yesterday Mrs. Browning said that she felt better, read a little in the \"Athenaeum\" and saw Miss Blagden as late as eight o'clock in the evening, who left her with but little misgiving. This morning, at half-past four, she expired unconsciously to herself with the words, \"It is beautiful,\" upon her lips. Poor Mr. Browning was entirely unprepared for the terrible blow. When she raised herself to pronounce her dying words wherein she expressed the glorious life which was opening upon her, he thought it was simply a movement premonitory to coughing. I have not seen him, but Miss Blagden, who is constantly with him, says he is completely prostrated with grief. The poor boy wanders about the house, sad, and disconsolate, hardly realising that his angel mother is no more. We went to the house the moment we heard of Mrs. Browning's death, but could be of no use. All that we did was to buy flowers and consecrate them by placing them around all that is left of one who was too pure to remain longer in this world. They have cut off all her hair, and the emaciated form was heart-rending to look upon. I almost regret that I have seen her in death, only that I do not wish to shun the house of mourning. . . . I cannot help perceiving that Dr. Wilson, who was called in owing to the absence of Gresanowsky, and who is most forbidding in physiognomy and is said by some to be a humbug, has hastened Mrs. Browning's death by resorting to a violent practice which her weak body was thoroughly incapable of enduring. He began by frightening her, telling her what a fearful state her entire system was in, - a fine way to treat an imaginative person. Gresanowsky knew her constitution, and it does seem most unfortunate that he should have been absent. Since the medical murder of Cavour, I have begun to distrust all doctors in Italy. . . . (Whiting, 134-137)\n\nI do not recall anywhere else it being said that not only were Pen's curls cut off but so also were Elizabeth's. That mirroring identity, so crucial to Elizabeth, shorn by 'funeral shears'. We remember the story of Elizabeth being upset one day because Robert had in a fit of fury cut off his own hair. Kate Field's narration opposes that given by Henry James in William Wetmore Story and His Friends (II.61-65), and by other contemporary accounts which have Robert saying at the time that Dr Wilson had prescribed too much morphine, Elizabeth in her drug euphoria (and not in the terror she would speak of in her letters of withdrawal when the drug-taking was momentarily forgotten during her travels) speaking of the bedroom curtains as hung with Hungarian colours (which are the same as Italian colours, the red, white and green we know Elizabeth to have used for the windows of Casa Guidi because the tricolour was banned by the Austrians). Dr Wilson was deeply opposed to laudanum usage and would not have overdosed her. See A109, Jean Elizabeth Wilson, AB5, Cornelia Loring. Rather it was Dr Gresanowsky of the fine bedside manner who enabled it. Lily Wilson, who had stopped the laudanum long enough to allow the successful pregnancy with Pen, had already been dismissed from her service. Robert, who had written the dramatic poem Paracelsus about laudanum's inventor, was knowledgeable about these opiate drugs, more so than was Elizabeth, and it was he who now administered the 'amreeta' drops to her. In all these accounts narrated by others of Elizabeth's dying their common source is Robert, the sole witness.\n\nThe body would have been brought from Casa Guidi to the 'English' Cemetery and laid on the huge cypress wood table built in 1860 at the same time as was the Gate House and its mortuary chapel, all using the cypress trees on the hill, these being still extant, though the chapel is now turned into a library.\n\nKate Field continues:\n\nFlorence, July 1, 1861\n\nI have been completely upset for the last three days, - the death of Mrs. Browning has unfitted me for doing anything. We have just returned from her funeral. We have seen all that is mortal of her buried in the beautiful Protestant burial-ground outside of Florence's walls, . . . The service was according to the Episcopal form. No discourse. Her life had been a sermon; she needed no other. It was agonizing to look on Mr. Browning - he seemed as though he could hardly stand, and his face expressed the most terrible grief. The poor boy stood beside him with tears in his eyes, and when I glanced from them to the pall where their loved one's remains lay, it seemed as though the sorrow was too much to bear. I yearned to go to Mr. Browning and weep with him that wept. The scene was made impressive in spite of the ministery; it was very short, and we were hurried away by Mr. Trollope. A lovely wreath of white flowers and a laurel wreath were placed upon the coffin. The funeral was managed by a friend of the Brownings, and so managed that no one knew anything about anything. Orders were given to the greatest confusion during the three days, and up to this morning I was told that no ladies were to be at the grave. However, Mr. Browning expressed a wish that Miss Blagden (B42) should be present and all other friends that desired to; therefore at the last moment I sent word to those whom I knew would wish to attend, and in this way there were sorrowing women to mourn for a great woman. The funeral would have been meagre without them. I thought that Mr. Landor (A29) ought to have been there, and had I known that the service would have been so short would have gone for him. The Storys (D108) came up from Leghorn; young Lytton, Mr. Trollope, the Powers (B32), and others paid their last tribute to her memory (Whiting, 137-138).\n\nLet us turn to the entries concerning Elizabeth Barrett Browning's burial for more clues. As Custodian of the Swiss-owned 'English' Cemetery I kept asking whether there were any more documents concerning these burials, apart from one ledger compiled in 1877 of the list of burials in alphabetic order. Always it was said everything had been lost in the 1966 Florence Flood. Finally, these were handed over: two ledgers created contemporaneously, and a third listing burials in temporal order, created in 1873 from the previous records, like the alphabetical register, Plus further ledgers giving the burial expenses, and the duplicate receipts for these funeral expenses and the payments to the grave-digger, which I now share with you.\n\nFirst the two Burial Registers, neither of which give her status as married, nor her parentage, and not even her correct age:\n\nI.\n\nII. The duplicate volume of the above:\n\n[Interestingly, Pen's baptismal certificate in the same Swiss Evangelical Church's Register tells us that it was performed on what would be almost her death date, 28 June, 1849, she dying 29 June, 1861, when he was twelve years old.]\n\nIII. The chronological listing of burials in the Swiss-owned so-called 'English' Cemetery, compiled in 1873 from the previous records:\n\nThe Alphabetical Register, compiled in 1877 from the previous records:\n\nIn all these documents Elizabeth's age is given incorrectly as '45', rather than '55'. We recall that she did not tell her husband she had visited the Battlefield of Waterloo immediately following Napoleon's defeat, though she describes a child loosed upon that same battlefield in Aurora Leigh. (The English Cemetery has fourteen participants in the Peninsula and Waterloo Battles against Napoleon, some of whom, like B98/ MAJOR FRANCIS CHARLES GREGORIE, were Elizabeth's friends.) Nor does her tomb give her birth date, only that of the year of her death, 'O+B+1861'. Her initials are given, 'E+E+B', but not her name, as if Robert penny-pinched on the payment to the stonemason, who would have charged for every letter. Another husband composed a lengthy poem at the death of his wife, F23/CAROLINE (BENNETT) NAPIER, Sector F, and paid for each letter of it to be engraved on her tomb slab.\n\nThe Funeral Expenses\n\nIV. Signor L. Gilli, Inspector of the Cemetery, is paid 271 paoli for the funeral of Elizabeth Barrett Browning out of which he pays the tax to the English Church of 113 paoli. Further payments are made to the English 'pasteur' of 108 paoli for conducting the service, and 10 paoli for his carriage. Yet further payments still are made for him to have crepe for his hat and gloves. But Elizabeth, clearly, from Pen's christening through her last letter to Arabella, would not have wanted to be buried by the Church of England's Rev O'Neill, but instead by the 'pasteur' of the Swiss Evangelical Reformed Church, Charles Berthoud. Apart from a pauper funeral this is the lowest amount paid at this time for an adult funeral. Those of Charlotte, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorn (E44), and of Theodore Parker (D108), cost more than a 1000 paoli each. The Trollopes, nine years earlier, had paid 572 paoli for a first class funeral for their favourite maid Elizabeth Shinner (C71) .\n\nV. Then Ferdinando Giorgi, Master Mason, is paid a total of 760 lire toscani from Signor L. Gilli for the burial of 16 persons, the first of which is #737, Elizabeth Barrett Browning's.\n\nNormally, Ferdinando Giorgi is paid 45 Tuscan lire a burial. He gets 90 Tuscan Paoli on 26/9/61 for EBB's burial, number #737, because he had to dig two graves. Which means the Swiss Evangelical Church this time only got 68 Paoli, less than the amount of a pauper's burial, which is 110 Paoli. Then the bill came for the carriage for the coffin from Luigi Pagliai at 32 Paoli, leaving the Swiss Church with just 36 Paoli.\n\nI puzzled over this payment for the digging of two graves. Had Robert had one dug for himself for when his time came? Had another body been found in it while digging the first? Then I found the answer to this question.\n\nMrs Sutherland Orr in Life and Letters of Robert Browning tells us that in September of 1861, writing from St.-Enogat, near Dinard, where he is staying with his father and sister, two months after Elizabeth's burial, Robert Browning requests Isa Blagden to arrange moving his wife's body from one grave to another, as this is required for the subsequent placing of the monument designed by Leighton, just the same as had been done for A3/ ROBINA (WILSON) CATANI CAVALCANTI and would be for A111/ HARRIET FRANKES (WEBSTER) PELLEW:\n\n. . . Isa, may I ask you one favour? Will you, whenever these dreadful preliminaries, the provisional removement, etc., when they are proceeded with - will you do -- all you can - suggest every regard to decency and proper feeling of the persons concerned? I have a horror of that man of the graveyard [Ferdinand Giorgi], and needless publicity and exposure - I rely on you, dearest friend of ours, to at least lend us your influence when the time shall come - a word may be invaluable. If there is any show made, or gratification of strangers' curiosity, far better that I had left the turf untouched. These things occur through sheer thoughtlessess, carelessness, not anything worse, but the effect is irreparable. I won't think of it - now - at least . . . (Orr, 395-396; McAleer, 175, dates this letter as of 19 September 1863, as from Ste Marie, Pornic, however, the receipt clearly indicates the revised burial, the twice-digging of graves, was carried out almost immediately in 1861).\n\nEarlier, Elizabeth had noted Robert's great fear of cemeteries. He had refused, for instance, to go to the funeral and burial of his first cousin James Silverthorne, the witness at their wedding (Arabella I.490-91,494). Mrs Orr similarly observes this of Robert and remarks of this letter: 'The dread expressed in this letter . . . connects itself with an habitual aversion for the paraphernalia of death, which was a marked peculiarity of Mr Browning's nature' (366-367), noting that he never visited her grave. Nathaniel Hawthorne modeled the character of Donatello in The Marble Faun on Robert Browning and likewise vividly described his mirroring character's horror of death.\n\nImmediately after the funeral, Robert commissioned the painting by Giorgio Mignaty of the Salone at Casa Guidi as it was when she died, on finding the room could not be photographed, perhaps by Longworth Powers (who would later photograph the tomb), perhaps by the Fratelli Alinari.\n\nWe recall that two of the Mignaty children, E131/ DEMETRIO FREDERICK MIGNATY and E130/ ELENA MIGNATY, are buried in the English Cemetery, Demetrio's inscription in Greek,\n\nand that the head of the beautiful but not faithful Signora Mignaty was model for B32/HIRAM POWERS ' Greek Slave about which Elizabeth wrote her powerful anti-slavery sonnet from which we take the title of this book, 'Thunders of White Silence'.\n\nThe American sculptor B32/HIRAM POWERS, who had been present with his wife Elizabeth at Elizabeth Barrett Browning's funeral, is also buried in the English Cemetery,while Michele Gordigiani, who painted the portraits of Elizabeth and Robert and likewise that of Camille Cavour, whose death on June 6th Elizabeth so deeply mourned,\n\n1858\n\nhad his studio just across the street, his descendant, Francesca Gordigiani, still living there.\n\nRobert Browning, who sculpted and who wrote poetry on the ordering of tombs, who was himself indulging in sculpture rather than poetry at the end of their marriage, accepted Frederic Leighton's offer to design Elizabeth's tomb, Count Cottrell having Francesco Giovannozzi carry it out in Browning's and Leighton's absence. Frederic Leighton had studied at the Accademia di Belle Arti and would become President of the Royal Academy. His earliest triumph had been to paint what Elizabeth had already described in Casa Guidi Windows, published in 1851, the 'Procession of Cimabue's Madonna from Borgo Allegri to Santa Maria Novella', in 1854, the huge canvas being purchased by Queen Victoria when he was all of twenty-four.\n\nFrederic Leighton, Cimabue's Madonna\n\nFrederic Leighton, Self Portrait, Uffizi\n\nLeighton, we noted, also illustrated Elizabeth's final poem to Pan, 'A Musical Instrument', when it was published in the Cornhill Magazine in 1860 (175-179), the year before her death. Leighton likewise illustrated George Eliot's Romola, including the despicable Tito's late return home to her, which both author and artist set in the Via dei Bardi house of Elizabeth's friend, Seymour Kirkup:\n\nRobert, who similarly often went out at night, leaving Elizabeth at home, after the initial years of marital - and sexual - bliss, immediately following the funeral, left Florence with young Pen, accompanied by B42/ ISABELLA BLAGDEN. He proceeded to write The Ring and the Book, the Aretine and Roman trial account in verse about spousal abuse and murder, as if his own confession: with Caponsacchi as if Robert being Elizabeth's rescuer from the bondage of Wimpole Street, and with Franceschini as if Robert, who as husband constantly quarrelled publicly with his wife over politics, over spiritualism, over their son, who lied to her saying the Gabinetto Vieusseux was forbidden to women, who held the purse strings of EBB's inheritances and her earnings, who lately carefully administered her laudanum, and who, as the author of Paracelsus, the inventor of laudanum, may have knowingly overdosed her, while blaming Dr Wilson for doing so. If so, it is a kind of mercy killing, for he carefully explains to everyone that she is unaware that she is dying, only that she is in a state of euphoria from the drug. She does not die hemorrhaging from the lungs with tuberculosis.\n\nLeighton Sketch Book XXXV, Royal Academy Library\n\n__ __\n\nGreek Lyre Christian Harp Hebrew Harp\n\nPan Cross Jubilee with Broken Slave Shackle\n\nLeighton's tomb for Elizabeth is a magnificent monument. But Robert never saw it, never returned again to Florence, though Pen did, living in the Torre di Antella, seeking to make Casa Guidi a museum, searching out memorabilia of his parents, which at his death were all dispersed in auction sales. Leighton did return to Florence and did see the work in progress, and was deeply angered by the changes made to his design by Francesco Giovannozzi and approved of by Count Cotttrell. Lilian Whiting's biography of Kate Field, the young American writer who had been present at that funeral, tells us that on Christmas Day, 1864, nearly three and a half years later than the funeral,\n\nMrs Browning's monument has not yet been erected, but will shortly be so. Leighton, who was intrusted by Mr. Browning with the design, was exceedingly and very reasonably angry on coming here in the autumn to superintend the erection of the monument, to find that the sculptor had most unwarrantably changed divers parts of the design. Some of these departures from his plan Leighton insisted on having restored, and this has led to considerable delay. And I should fear that the monument, when it is put up, will not be wholly satisfactory to Mr. Browning or Mr. Leighton (Whiting, 157).\n\nCount Cottrell, whose title was given to him for his services as Chamberlain by the Grand Duke of Lucca, had refused to go to the English Cemetery at the burial of one of his children there, Carlo Lodovico, B102/CHARLES LEWIS COTTRELL, Robert exceptionally officiating for him as chief mourner (Arabella, II.322-323). In some of the earlier Letters to Arabella the relations between the Cottrells and the Brownings became decidedly strained, for Mary Trepsack had had her life savings conned from her and lost in a bankruptcy by Cottrell relatives, partly through Robert's actions, Elizabeth desperately trying to get reparations paid to her in compensation while obeying Robert in keeping secret from her brothers his involvement in the case (Arabella I.268-269, 271-272, 286, 305, 311, 349-350). Mary Trepsack was the beloved freed slave in the Barrett Moulton Barrett entourage who had paid for the publication of Elizabeth's second magnum opus, The Essay on Mind, in 1826; Elizabeth's first magnum opus, The Battle of Marathon, begun when she was eleven, having been privately printed by her father in 1820. Robert now put Count Cottrell in charge of overseeing his wife's tomb in Florence. He had already defied her in giving her a Church of England funeral, bilking the Swiss Evangelical Reformed Church.\n\nBrowning writes, in 1866, to George Moulton-Barrett, Elizabeth's younger and favourite brother (284-5):\n\nI feel very grateful indeed for your letter, and all the kindness it is replete with. For the monument, I am simply rejoiced that you like it. You know it was just what I was able to accomplish in that direction, and no more: I meant, - that had it been of pure gold it would have gone no farther in the way of being a fit offering, - and on the other hand, if my circumstances had only allowed me to put up a wooden cross, that would have sufficed. But I was fortunate in the sympathy of Leighton, and so, I hope, have been able perhaps to manage that the little which is done, is on the whole well done. I could not be on the spot and care for the execution personally - and mistakes were made at first which have been rectified since: but, by the photographs, I judge that Leighton's work is adequately rendered, - and we must be content.\n\nBrowning writes again, in 1875, to George Moulton-Barrett (298), who has been to see the tomb in Florence, noting in a letter to Robert that it was already grimed and needing care (Sutherland Orr, 367-68):\n\nYou will certainly have wondered at the delay in replying to your kind letter: it was occasioned by the necessity of consulting with Leighton about the proper course to take in a matter which concerned him so much. I am deeply obliged to you for informing me about what I might else have long remained in ignorance; and the particulars of the damage, as well as the estimates of needful repair & expenditure are just what I should have desired. I wish every fit measure to be taken, and leave the whole in your most capable hands: but there is this difficulty, - Leighton is very averse to the destruction of his design by the substitution of black marble: he would prefer the renewal of the old work, even if one needs to begin again in another eleven years. Cannot this be managed? I wish it were as easy to replace the coarse nature of the relic-mongers by some more human and decent stuff, but that is impossible. Would a more effectual railing be any use? or would a cover, such as you mention as being made for the Demidoff monument, answer the purpose here? You have such an advantage over me who never saw the Tomb, that I accept your judgment, whatever it may be. Leighton said he would prefer letting the ornaments quite go, in process of time, and then renewing them - that is, prefer this to substituting the black stripe.\n\nElizabeth's absence from her own tomb is strange. Though there are many tombs with portrait medallions:A64/ GEORGE AUGUSTUS WALLIS by Aristodemos Costoli, A15/ ANNE SUSANNA (LLOYD) HORNER by Francesco Jerace; AB7/ INA BOSS SAULTER, by Ettore Ximenes;B4/ ELENA NIKITICNA DIK, NATA AKZYNOVA by Fyodor Fyodorovitsch Kamensky; C3/ THOMAS SOUTHWOOD SMITH by Joel T. Hart; D108/ THEODORE PARKER by William Wetmore Story; D127/JAMES ROBERTS, by Joel T. Hart?; E12/ JAMES LORIMER GRAHAM, JR by Launt Thompson; E9/WALTER KENNEDY LAWRIE by Pietro Bazzanti,F27/ PHILIPPINA (SIMONS) CIAMPI, Joel T. Hart?, and two portrait busts: B23/ PROFESSORE CESARE PAGANINIby Emilio Zocchi, C106/JEAN DAVID MARC GONIN by Pietro Bazzzanti), there is no recognizable medallion portrait of Elizabeth Barrett Browning, only an ideal figure of Poesy, and we learn from Robert's letter from the Athenaeum Club, January 19, 1863, to B42/ ISABELLA BLAGDEN, that the Italians, through Cottrell, sought to pre-empt Leighton's design, and that Robert himself decided against having her portrait,\n\nI have determined at last that the central medallion shall be appropriated, not to a Portrait, but to an ideal head of 'Poetry': a portrait proves to be impossible, - one, that is, which we would accept: there is nothing to be done but submit to a necessity - for any playing with the truth there would be hateful to me (185-186),\n\nand then in Robert's letter to Frederic Leighton, August 20, 1863, that he had sent portraits of Elizabeth to him. Finally he writes to Isa, October 19, 1864, about Leighton's explosion concerning the badness of the execution, and speaking of the portrait medallion as altered, particularly as to the hair, to falsely 'better' it.\n\nIt was fortunate indeed that I was saved from the addition to my annoyances which I should have had to bear had my journey been to Florence. Leighton writes to me that nothing can be more impudently bad than the execution of his designs - there has been no pretence at imitating some of them - and the four (sic., for six) capitals of the columns will have to be sawn off and carved afresh, - also two of the medallions have to be cut out and replaced - as infamous: while the third 'though indeed detestable is not quite irremediable\". The Profile is \"less slovenly than the rest\", though open to many objections - \"the hair, with that designing of which I took great pains, is entirely different: the fellow had the coolness to say that he thought I had probably done the thing hastily without nature, and that he had put up a plait, and done the thing afresh himself (if you could see it!) - also, in the ear, \"ho cercato di migliorare!\" he added that he had obtained from Cavalier Mathas [architect of the façade of Santa Croce] and Count Cottrell the sanction to improve these parts of the work - let us hope there is no truth in this. Cottrell says he saw all the criticism I make, himself - but that he thought it better to leave them to me to make, as the mischief was irremediable\"- On the contrary, Cottrell wrote to me that it was \"extremely well-executed\", - and as he paid up the last instalment, though not due till the work was really erected, I have no sort of remedy. Don't say one word about this - I won't have any wrangling over - literally - the grave (194-195).\n\nOne can see in three of the photographs taken by the son of Hiram Powers (B32), Longworth Powers, preserved in the Gabinetto Vieusseux, the various stages of the tomb's long drawn out building, first the white marble base, then the columns, then the whole.\n\nLeighton had other errors changed, but Robert connived at the false portrait medallion on the most visible part of the tomb. Not only is Elizabeth's name absent from her tomb, but so also is Frederic Leighton's, while 'FRANCESCO.GIOVANNOZZI.FECE' in great capitals is sculpted onto its base. It is a tomb to which the 'Ba', the Soul, according to the Egyptian Book of the Dead, lacking image or name, would be unable to return. A double dying, a double murdering. One wonders who paid for the tomb? Was it Browning? Or Leighton, so deeply disturbed that his honouring of her was thus countermanded into the oblivion of her name and of her image.\n\nHowever, it seems from sketches in the Royal Academy's Library that Andrew Potter has so kindly sent me that Leighton conceived it not as a classical sarcophagus so much as a medieval pilgrim tomb with space under it for pilgrims to enter, like that of Edward the Confessor's Tomb in Westminster Abbey. An aside: When Elizabeth was preparing herself for the elopement with Robert, she dared to go outside, to take walks, and on one of them visited Westminster Abbey and its Poets' Corner where her husband would come to be buried apart from her. This is how she described it, 31 July, 1846:\n\nHow grand - how solemn! Time itself seemed turned to stone there! . . . we stood where the poets were laid - oh, it is very fine - better than Laureateships and pensions. Do you remember what is written on Spenser's monument - 'Here lyeth, in expectation of the second coming of Jesus Christ, . . Edmond Spenser, having given proof of his divine spirit in his poems'.\n\nI found this photograph placed on EBB's tomb, 5/10/2011, by Jan Taylor who wrote on the back of it: 'This quest of mine started when I watched a film called The Barretts of Wimpole Street. It turned out to be a wonderful love story between two poets, Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning, whereupon they eloped to Florence and lived there until Elizabeth Barrett Browning died, and was buried in Florence. Robert Browning, however, returned to London where he is buried in Poet's Corner in Wetminster Abbey. I felt saddened to hear they were buried apart, although it is an honour to be buried in Poet's Corner. I would like to give up the honour for love. I took this photograph of Robert Browning's resting place and travelled to Florence to place it on Elizabeth's grave'.\n\nWe find indeed that Leighton had intended a more true portrait on the tomb as he originally conceived it, these drawings being supplied by the Leighton House Museum from those in the Victoria and Albert Museum (Leighton even shows a togaed Robert approaching it, remembing the scene where Romney and Aurora in Aurora Leigh speak of the tomb at the Appian Way, 'Siste, Viator!') We remember that Emily Dickinson, America's greatest poet, treasured a postcard of this tomb, and wrote of it and of Aurora Leigh's use of the Appian Way, in her lyric, 'The soul selects her own society, Then shuts the door; On her divine majority, obtrude no more. Unmoved she notes the chariot's pausing At her low gate; Unmoved, an emperor is kneeling Upon her mat. I've known her from an ample nation Choose one, Then shut the valves of her attention Like stone'. She also wrote of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's final volume (312):\n\nWhiteSilence\n\nHer -- \"last Poems\" -- Poets -- ended -- Silver -- perished -- with her Tongue -- Not on Record -- bubbled other, Flute -- or Woman -- So divine -- Not unto its Summer -- Morning Robin -- uttered Half the Tune -- Gushed too free for the Adoring -- From the Anglo-Florentine -- Late -- the Praise -- 'Tis dull -- conferring On the Head too High to Crown -- Diadem -- or Ducal Showing -- Be its Grave -- sufficient sign -- Nought -- that We -- No Poet's Kinsman -- Suffocate -- with easy woe -- What, and if, Ourself a Bridegroom -- Put Her down -- in Italy?\n\nI will now give comments concerning the Brownings from William Holman Hunt, PreRaphaelitism and the PreRaphaelite Brotherhood, pp. 96-96:\n\nWhen I returned to town from Oxford, I found the Brownings had come to London, and soon Gabriel and I were invited to spend the evening with them. When the appointed hour approached I had a return of Syrian ague upon me, but this was not enough to prevent me from greeting the two poets; both were extremely unaffected and genial.\n\nBrowning was taller than he had been described to me, perhaps about five feet six, robust and hearty in his tone of interest in all questions discussed, but I felt some self-reproach in so faintly recognising in him the stamp of a man as elevated above his fellows as his noblest poems had proved him to be. Mrs. Browning was small and very fragile; she betrayed nervous anxiety in her eager manner, so that the supersensitive tenour of her poems seemed fitly embodied in her. Her hair was brought forward and fell in ringlets on her face in a manner quite out of fashion, and thus helped to make one feel that she disregarded all changes of mode since her youth. The special interest of the evening was the production of a poem by their son, aged about six, the subject Leighton's picture of Orpheus and Eurydice. It was, even taking the child's parentage into consideration, a wonderful example of precocity. Gabriel seemed throughout the evening over apt to break in with jocular interruption to the conversation, as though claiming proprietorship in the company present; it was easy to yield to him in this whim, since it happened that we were all his debtors for the first knowledge of the works of our new friends.\n\nBrowning was constantly there, being deeply interested in art, an interest which, it was said, he had shown several years before by drawing in the Schools at Rome. After the death of Mrs. Browning his devoted sister became the mistress of his house, and they made it the anxiety of their life to watch the prospects of the son. For a time all seemed uncertain about Pen's proclivities, but one day when I called upon the poet, in Bloomfield Terrace he showed me a group of still life, composed of a human skull and accessories, which the son had spontaneously painted. The assurance that Pen would take to painting was a great joy to his father, and he consulted me earnestly as to the course to be followed, but on a subsequent occasion he told me that he had been advised to send him to study in Belgium. After a few seasons some examples of\n\npage: 270\n\nhis son's work were seen in the Grosvenor Gallery, when the poet expressed great gratification at any recognition that they gained. By this date Browning was an honoured celebrity. Some of his original champions were confessedly displeased in that he seemed to approve the fashionable admiration of London society rather than their own, and words were wafted about expressing indifference to his later poems. He spoke to me of a visit he had made to the National Gallery after a prolonged absence abroad, and of his close attention to the Dead Knight by Velasquezhe said it had struck him then with a weird astonishment in that it was an illustration of the initial scene of his poem of Childe Roland and that Velasquez had anticipated his vision. (The title now given to the picture is changed.) Once when I was talking to the poet I chanced to mention the name of Rossetti; he suddenly flamed up, saying, That is a man I will never forgive; he is unpardonable. I replied: Certainly I cannot pose as one of his  idolaters but one of his great merits in my eyes is that he was the first who introduced me to your poetry, and that was thirty years ago. But Browning was still irate, declaring that he had no patience with him, and would never overlook his insolence. I did not inquire further about the exact cause of offence. It is possible that Rossetti, originally nearly as great an enthusiast for Mrs. Browning as for the poet himself, had recently uttered something derogatory to her as\n\npage: 271\n\npage: 272 well as to the poet, and his verdict that Browning and poetry had parted company for ever could scarcely have escaped the poet's ear.\n\nBrowning's and Leighton's scoffing, angry letters were not the only ones about the tomb.
