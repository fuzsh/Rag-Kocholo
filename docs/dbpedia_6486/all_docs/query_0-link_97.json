        "text": "For academics, working in the archive is often a romanticised journey—its letters, diaries, and billets-doux retain the frisson of history (Steedman 2001; Dever, Newman and Vickery 2009). In contrast, the work of the textual editor is seldom considered more than dry scholarship. This chapter puts aside the idea of textual editing as detached, rational scholarship in order to re-think its obsessive passions as research practice and discuss how the editing of life-writings can bring relationships and events to life in a meaningful way.\n\nThe article adresses the practice of critical editing in Poland. The author, Paweł Bem, calls for an evaluation of theoretical thought underlying the practice of establishing critical editions meant to refl ect an author’s intention, and promotes the New Philology paradigm for scholarly editing. The New Philology perspective provides a methodological background for handling each text as a unique artifact. Bem also advocates for respecting original spellings and opposes standard modernization practices in scholarly editing."
