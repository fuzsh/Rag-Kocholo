        "text": "'08 - FROM THE SIMPLE TO THE COMPLEX\n\nContemporary Thoughts about Being Polish American\n\nAnthony J. Bajdek\n\nA couple of weeks ago a friend of mine informed me that he had learned on good authority that a preliminary draft pf the forthcoming United States Census of 2010 included a question in which the term âPolish raceâ was included among the possible answers. My reaction to the fact that someone in the Census Bureau had conceived the existence of a âPolish raceâ was one of complete surprise. My surprise, however, wasnât unsubstantiated.\n\nAs of the end of 2008, I had taught history for some 42 consecutive years in a major American university, now ranked among the top 100 national universities in the United States. Over those years, for at least two semesters per year, I taught courses variously titled Western Civilization, Ancient and Medieval World History, Early Modern World History, Modern World History, Eastern Europe since 1500, Poland in the 20th Century, Russia since 1917, The World from 1900 to 1945, and The World from 1945 to the Present.\n\nWhereas over the years I thus have been familiar with popularly-known terms such as the human race, the white race, the black race, the Asian race, the Amerindian race, and many years ago with the now-obsolescent academic equivalents such as the Caucasoid race and the Mongoloid race, for example, I must have missed something teaching those courses because I never had seen the term âPolish raceâ in print or ever heard it spoken in informed academic circles.\n\nThe Census Bureau episode, however, caused me to think about my ethnicity.\n\nAs a child I grew up in an urban Polish neighborhood. In that Polish neighborhood with its Polish parish, Parafia ÅwiÃªtego MichaÂ³a ArchanioÂ³a and its elementary school, I simply thought that I was Polish. I heard the language at home. It was my fatherâs language because he had been born in Poland. It was the only language of both sets of my grandparents, one set living in the neighborhood, the other in neighboring town. Every day during the school year, I walked by a piekarnia on my way to and from school and savored the aroma of Polish bread baking in the ovens. I had no trouble understanding who I was. I was Polish, and I never gave any thought to the fact of my having been born in the United States and thus being an American citizen by birth. In short, as a child approaching adolescence I had been more likely to identify myself as being Polish than being American.\n\nFor eight years in Saint Michaelâs Elementary School, five days a week, half of the school day was conducted in English, the other half in Polish. I recall studying Biblja ÅwiÃªta daily. I never heard the name Moses in English. I only knew him as Mojzesz. I studied geography in Polish as well, so much so that I pronounced California as Kalifornia.\n\nIn the annual przedstawienie conducted by the School in St. Michaelâs Polish National Alliance Hall, the nuns used me as one of the song-and-dance second or third grade kids (I was better at song than dance by the way), and I vividly remember being dressed up in a little black tuxedo, bow tie, and bowler hat singing as lead singer no less, âJestem sobie Polak maÂ³y, hop, hop, hejzecha.â\n\nSome sixty years later, the Census Bureau faux pas of a couple of weeks ago that caused me to re-examine my ethnicity also evokes a time-tested expression that I will refer to today, that being âfrom the simple to the complexâ.\n\nThe opening phrase, âfrom the simpleâ had illustrated my thinking about my own identity as a child living in my small, reassuring Polish neighborhood. The concluding phrase, âto the complexâ is where I am today, and for that matter, where we all find ourselves today.\n\nThe inherent wisdom of that expression â from the simple to the complex â is applicable to everything in life on earth, from the pre-history and the recorded history of the human experience, and specifically to the history of human institutions whether they be social, economic, scientific, cultural, educational, or governmental.\n\nAs a child, I thought that I had been Polish. I spoke the language. I studied the language for eight years. Each teaching nun (siostra nauczycielka) of St. Michaelâs insisted on proper, native-like Polish pronunciation. I had been an altar-boy (ministrant) for all eight years. I sang in Polish in the childrenâs choir for all eight years. To this day I know the words and melodies of at least a dozen and a half kolendy by memory.\n\nThen some twenty years ago, a brilliant elderly Polish-born professor in Harvard Universityâs Russian and Ukrainian Studies Center informed me as he said it then, that âYou are not Polish, you can never be Polish or a Pole for that matter because you have been born in the United States.â\n\nSo much for the significance of my singing âjestem sobie Polak maÂ³yâ as a child in St. Michaelâs PNA Hall.\n\nSince being given that reality check by Professor Bohdan StrumiÃ±ski, I have proceeded through the remaining possibilities that define my ethnicity, those being, American of Polish heritage, American of Polish descent, and Polish American. I prefer the second and third options and use them interchangeably. Therefore, as you see, my experience of self-identification that evolved into ethnic consciousness progressed from the simple to the complex. Yet I recall one line in the lyrics of an old Polish melody, âJak dÂ³ugo w sercu naszych, choÃ¦ kropla polskiej krwiâ and I remember the foundation of who I am.\n\nThat being said, the second integral part constituting my presentation to you today is a much different anecdote. It concerns a Northeastern University student who made an appointment to visit me in my office some twenty-five years ago. When my secretary buzzed me to announce that Walter Â¯urkowski had arrived I told her to send him in. I had never met him prior to that one meeting, but the name alone caused me to speculate about his appearance because I took pride in the fact that I could identify a person of Polish descent in a crowd of many people just by appearances alone, or at least I thought so prior to meeting Walter in person.\n\nWalterâs appearance completely surprised and stunned me. Not that he stood about six feet three inches in height. Rather, it had been his jet black, shiny well-combed hair, and his complexion which suggested either a Mediterranean or Latin American admixture. As a matter of fact I thought to myself that he could have easily been a Hollywood actor.\n\nOn the contrary, Walter was simply a junior in our College of Business Administration, and was doing very well academically because I had accessed his record in the Registrarâs Office on my computer and had it on the screen as he sat in front of me.\n\nThe first thing he said to me, all the while smiling, was, âI donât have any problems, Dean, and most of all, I donât need financial aid from the University. I donât need financial aid because Iâm Hispanic and received a lot of it from other sources when I graduated from high school.â When he said âbecause Iâm Hispanicâ his smile broadened from ear to ear.\n\nWalter then related that his grandfather had emigrated from Poland with his family in the early 1930s because he was tired of always being cold, and therefore selected to live the remainder of his life in Puerto Rico where he could always be warm, really warm, some would say hot. Grandfather Â¯urkowskiâs son, Walterâs father, grew up into adulthood and subsequently married a Puerto Rican woman who became Walterâs mother.\n\nAlways good-naturedly smiling as he told me his familyâs story, he must have anticipated my question which was, âWalter, what do you consider yourself to be ethnically?â\n\nUnhesitatingly, he responded, âMy nationality is Puerto Rican, my culture is Hispanic, and my ancestry is Polish.â By the immediacy of his answer, it became apparent that he had been asked that question before.\n\nAnd I might add in closing that he spelled his surname with a âyâ instead of an âiâ. English was his second language, but he spoke it without any trace of a Spanish accent. He informed me as well that he spoke no Polish at all, and finally that he intended to seek employment and settle in the United States.\n\nThe third integral part of my presentation is yet another anecdote.\n\nIn my role as National Vice President for American Affairs for the Polish American Congress, I began a campaign some five years ago for the passage of Visa Waiver for Poland Joint Resolutions by state legislatures as a method by which to âmemorializeâ the President and the Congress of the United States that Poland should be admitted to the United State Visa Waiver Program. It was no accident, therefore, that the Massachusetts legislature was the first in the nation to pass such a Visa Waiver for Poland Joint Resolution in May 2004, and was followed chronologically by New Jersey, Vermont, Pennsylvania, Maine, Connecticut (with a Senate Resolution), Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Michigan, Arizona, and ended with Illinois in October 2007. In Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut, Maine, and Nebraska I had been the only one to approach legislators with the idea of sponsoring such Resolutions. In all other states, except for New Jersey, I worked with someone residing in the state to approach legislators who might be inclined to sponsor the Resolution.\n\nMy search for likely sponsors of Visa Waiver for Poland Resolutions in state legislatures continues to this day unfortunately, despite the fact that Poland is a proven loyal friend and ally of the United States which has supported American counter-terrorism military initiatives in Iraq and Afghanistan with Polish combat soldiers whereas most of the European nations enjoying Visa Waiver status never sent their troops to help the United States. In addition to the United States Senate and Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security also continues to have a good say in what nations are admitted to the Visa Waiver Program.\n\nThat said, all of us here today know that Polandâs citizens are not potential terrorists threatening the United States. Yet Polandâs citizens cannot travel to the United States visa-free. Virtually all other Europeans can travel here visa-free except for those of Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Malta, Romania, and Poland.\n\nMy friends, this is an insult to Poland and Polish Americans by our government. The exclusion of Poland from the Visa Waiver Program causes Polish citizens traveling to the United States to be treated as second-class visitors. Thatâs why I continue working on behalf of the Polish American Congress to rectify the situation in Washington, DC and in state legislatures. Currently, I am working to identify potential sponsors in the California, Florida, and Indiana legislatures.\n\nIn the legislature of the state of Washington, I came across the name of Mark Miloscia, a member of the House of Representatives. He spells his surname without Polish diacritical marks, but clearly his surname is indicative of a Polish origin. He is a graduate of the United States Air Force Academy, earned an MA at Chapman University, an MBA at the University of North Dakota, graduated as well from the Kennedy School of Government of Harvard University, and had been a career USAF B-52 bomber pilot.\n\nHowever, Representative Miloscia insisted that he was of Italian descent, indeed his great grandfather Miloscia emigrated from Bari, Italy in the second half of the 19th century.\n\nWhile trying to enlist his sponsorship for a Visa Waiver for Poland Resolution in the state legislature of Washington, I had ample opportunity to exchange messages with him about his surname as well and forwarded its spelling to him via email so that he could see it in its original Polish version with diacritics as being MiÂ³oÅÃ¦ia.\n\nI informed him that throughout the 19th century, Poles in Austrian-controlled Galicja who emigrated to the United States, Canada, and Latin America made their way to the Italian port city of Bari on the Adriatic Sea rather than to Hamburg on the Baltic Sea because Bari was more convenient for them geographically and had fewer bureaucratically-imposed travel impediments by Austria than the Prussian and Russian sectors of partitioned Poland.\n\nRepresentative Miloscia finally admitted to me that I was the second person in his life to point out that he had a Polish surname. The other person had been a Polish American cadet in the United States Air Force Academy whom he met during his Academy days.\n\nI bring you now to the concluding segment of my presentation.\n\nAs we Polish Americans of many generations progress through the 21st century and thereafter, the centrifugal forces characterizing our dynamic multicultural society will create on an unimaginable scale more Walter Zurkowskis and Mark Miloscias, not that there was and is anything wrong about these two very fine men. The forces of intermarriage and sorry to say, indifference about Polish ancestry and correct pronunciation of Polish surnames by the institutions of society will be the major corrosive factors, unless challenged. Society will also confront those of us who thought that they had been secure in their ethnicity, ancestry, and productive role in society by fostering distractions that weaken our ethnic sensitivities and curiosity about our ancestral past, among the major sustained distractions being the motion picture industry, commercial and cable TV, and round the clock professional sports, for example, that numb the senses and dull the intellect, the intellect being the source of human curiosity, remembrance, and progress.\n\nBy the year 2100, just 91 years from now, all Americans of European ancestry will represent somewhere around 40% of the population of the United States, a point well worth remembering.\n\nHow will Polish Americans â an integral part of those of European ancestry â have to face that reality, one may ask.\n\nThough the âKiss me, Iâm Polishâ ethnic approach of the sixties, seventies, and eighties, may have been an enjoyable pastime perhaps for many, its type of response cannot be a viable strategy for the 21st century. It is clear that a well-reasoned and executed intellectual response will be very appropriate to counter the centrifugal forces that act to weaken our ethnic solidarity as Polish Americans. Yet we also have to be âstreet smartâ about ourselves as integral components of greater American society as well.\n\nIn this regard, it is worthwhile to consider the slogan of the Solidarity movement that brought down Communism in Poland: âNie ma wolnoÅÃ¦i bez solidarnoÅÃ¦i.â For the 21st century in the United States, I propose a somewhat equivalent slogan that symbolizes determination to preserve our ethnic consciousness and presence in American society in the face of societyâs centrifugal distractions. The slogan is: âNie ma polskoÅÃ¦i bez solidarnoÅÃ¦i.â\n\nIn short, though conditions today are very different in 2009 than they had been in 1909, Polish Americans will have to move forward united and resolved much like their ancestors who arrived in the United States over the past century and a quarter as they struggled to create American Polonia. The good work of organizations and individuals such as those being honored here today by the AM-POL Eagle must be sustained, but not as the sole approach to sustaining polskoÅÃ¦ in America.\n\nMost of all, however, we must correct a problem that detracts from all the wonderful cultural, academic, commemorative, and anti-defamation activities and organizations that we have to our credit as Polish Americans established over the prior century and a quarter, works and infrastructure that are truly impressive, and are reflected among your local and regional friends and neighbors whose work is recognized annually thanks to Roger Puchalski.\n\nAs I have cautioned the National Directors of the Polish American Congress we as an ethnic group have established such organizations to a fault simply because our predecessors had an understandable tendency to pour more energy into them than we did to the matters of political life in and governance of the United States, both on the federal and state levels. Our immigrant ancestors had no choice in the matter. They were viewed by American society as ignorant, dirty, and un-American. They were the objects of derogatory jokes. My grandfather, JÃ³zef Taraszkiewicz, had the local members of the Ku Klux Klan burn a gasoline-soaked cross on the front door of his home because he had the audacity to seek employment in the General Electric plant in Lynn, Massachusetts during the immediate period after 1919 known as the âRed Scareâ in the history of the United States when Americans thought that anyone with a name ending in wicz or ski was a Bolshevik communist.\n\nThe fact is that the vast majority of our immigrant ancestors never achieved the so-called âAmerican dream.â Their lives were harsh. Their expectations and ambitions though high were limited by the prejudice and disdain by greater American society. Their only solace was in the parafia and okolica. Their hopes were for their childrenâs advancement.\n\nOur problem is different today.\n\nTo perpetuate polskoÅÃ¦ in America, we have to be smart, and not just sentimental and emotional. Whereas we are not a special racial subset as someone in the Census Bureau apparently thought, we are in fact the fifth largest European ethnic group in the United States, and we must not avoid engaging in American political life, because for better or worse politics, along with economics, drives society. It is true that politics is usually perceived as being dirty, but it is equally true that all politics is local. Furthermore, civic-minded public service can be uplifting as well. Service to oneâs country can also be a noble calling, Just ask cadets of West Point, Annapolis, and the Air Force Academy about the matter.\n\nHereâs a fact that it worth remembering. Nearly 60% of the members of the United States Congress originate in state government, a fact that should engage our attention as Polish Americans on a sustained basis. That fact creates an opportunity not only for the men and women currently serving in state government, principally in the legislative and executive branches, but also for their constituents â you and me â who can get to know them at the grass roots level before they go off to Washington, DC.\n\nWith 50 state legislatures alone, the probability for finding Polish American legislators serving in them is less than the possibility, but nevertheless, bears our attention. In preparation for my presentation I reviewed the composition of all 50 state legislatures, Mark Miloscia included, searching for Polish surnamed legislators. I found a total of 74 across 26 legislatures as follows:\n\nAlaska 2\n\nArizona 2\n\nConnecticut 8\n\nDelaware 2\n\nIllinois 2\n\nIndiana 4\n\nIowa 1\n\nKansas 1\n\nLouisiana 1\n\nMaryland 3\n\nMassachusetts 7 (Knapik, Kocot, Koczera, Kujawski, Kulik, Scibak, SmoÂ³a)\n\nMichigan 4\n\nMinnesota 4\n\nMissouri 1\n\nMontana 1 (a Pomnichowski in cowboy country nonetheless)\n\nNew Hampshire 3\n\nNew Jersey 3\n\nNew York 4 (Gabryszak, Maziarz, Stachowski, and Zebrowski)\n\nOhio 1\n\nOregon 2\n\nPennsylvania 6\n\nRhode Island 1\n\nUtah 1 (a Biskupski in Mormon country)\n\nVermont 4\n\nWashington 1\n\nWisconsin 5\n\nOnly time will tell how many of them go on to serve in the United States Congress.\n\nTo those who bemoan the fact that our government doesnât seem to do enough for Poland and the interests of Polish Americans, I always respond with the cautionary expression:\n\nâToo much polonaise, not enough politics.â\n\nConcerned Polish Americans and Americans of Polish descent such as the wonderful folks being honored here today who must sustain the promulgation of the knowledge, truth, and dignity of Polish culture and tradition nevertheless cannot expect solely to sing, dance, and commemorate events of Polandâs history -- all of which are absolutely necessary and commendable -- as a means by which to attract the attention of the White House, the United States Congress, and the executive and legislative branches of state government. Those three activities, however, should be viewed as threshold âproducing opportunities over time, but not limitless time, that create the follow-up circumstances to engage the leaders of our nationâs and our statesâ political life and governance.\n\nI offer a practical example of the foregoing for your consideration. On May 3, 2004 after completing a commemoration of Polandâs Constitution of May 3, 1791 at the State House on Beacon Hill in Boston, Massachusetts, I wandered through the halls of the state legislature in search of potential sponsors for what turned out to be our nationâs first Visa Waiver for Poland Joint Resolution that was sponsored, referred to committee, and passed eight days later. Since most of the sponsors had been Polish Americans, I approached them in 2007 with a different proposition, that being to create a Polish legislative Caucus in the Massachusetts Legislature. They created it in February 2007. In the fall of 2008, I approached them again with the request that they sponsor and work for passage of a Polish American Congress Joint Resolution. Not only did they agree, but they asked me to draft the wording of the Resolution. In April 2008 such a first-in-the-nation Resolution was passed. In January of this year, I asked them to consider making Polish American Congress Day a statutory state celebration under Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 6, so as to put Polish American Congress Day on the same statutory footing as Casinir Pulaski Day, Thaddeus KoÅciuszko Day, Constitution of May 3, 1791 Day, and Polish American Heritage Month.\n\nAnother form of related advice that I offer anyone about engaging politics and governance is:\n\nâDonât be timid, donât be shy, and donât be afraid to ask.â\n\nIn short, if you donât do anything, you wonât gain anything (z niczego nic nie bÃªdzie).\n\nIf Polish Americans a century ago had been able to devote equivalent propitious time, resources, and talent to sustaining political activism in Washington, DC and in state government as they did to produce the breathtaking physical and cultural infrastructure constituting American Polonia, we would not find ourselves in the relatively weak position we find ourselves today in terms of influence with our American government both federal and state.\n\nWe have progressed generally from the days when our immigrant ancestors and their children who over a century and a quarter found solace in their parafia and okolica to our often chaotic and always centrifugally-based contemporary world that has radically reduced the presence of Polish parishes and neighborhoods and includes in the suburbs more and more Â¯urkowskis and MiÂ³oÅÃ¦ias to whom we must not turn our backs â these are the challenges that we must confront and resolve successfully as we Polish Americans continue to progress âfrom the simple to the complex,â for after all, we live in a complex society, and we seek and sustain careers in complex organizations, both public and private.\n\nWe have to be smart about preserving what you so wonderfully do here in Buffalo and western New York by also initiating and sustaining engagement in the governance and politics of the United States and the great state of New York, an example of which occurred on April 20, 2009 in Albany when a delegation of the Polish American Congress representing the western, central, and downstate NY conducted its first annual Polish American Congress Day in the halls of the executive and legislative branches of state government.\n\nAnother example of being smart rather than emotional occurred in Washington, DC on March 25, 2008 when the President of the Polish American Congress and several members of his Executive Committee had a private scheduled meeting with Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania who, you may recall, made a public derogatory remark about Polish Americans several months earlier. During our meeting, the Committee proposed that the Senator should consider demonstrating his apology to Polish Americans substantively by sponsoring a Resolution in the United States Congress honoring the 6,066 Polish Christians who, during Nazi Germanyâs brutal occupation of Poland in World War II, risked their lives and those of their families to save Polish Jews from extermination during the Holocaust. Those 6,066 Polish Christians are included as the âRighteous Among the Nationsâ by Yad Vashem in Israel. Senator Specter agreed to do it and asked us to provide him the wording. On my return flight to Boston that evening, I drafted the words of the Resolution which he and his staff are now working on.\n\nBy way of such initiatives and by energetically supporting the 74 Polish American state legislators across the United States as well as the much smaller number serving in the United States Congress, we Polish Americans as an ethnic entity rather than a separate race can demonstrate that we have long ago progressed âfrom the simpleâ stage of being recent additions to the American landscape and are now and forever will be in our âcomplex stage,â fully capable of navigating and thriving in the complex world of American society, politics, and governance.\n\nThis is how polskoÅÃ¦ in America must and will survive into the unknown future.\n\nDziÃªkujÃª za uwagÃª i za wysÂ³uchanie.\n\nPrepared and presented by:\n\nAnthony J.
