        "text": "Keith Schipper is in need of another oil change.\n\nThe campaign manager for state Rep. Teri Hickel and state auditor hopeful Mark Miloscia just had one at the end of August. But from Tuesday, Sept. 13, to Friday, Sept. 16, Schipper said he put roughly 3,800 miles on his 1999 Honda Accord driving Miloscia around the state for numerous meet-and-greets.\n\nIn addition to owning and managing a consulting firm in Seattle, he’s been working with Miloscia since 2014 and Hickel since 2015. The long hours on the road are part and parcel of being the gatekeeper to two successful Federal Way political candidates.\n\n“Getting a lot more oil changes this year,” Schipper said. “A lot more than usual, that’s for sure.”\n\nThe hat collection\n\nSchipper is tired as he saunters into a Federal Way coffee shop, gets an iced coffee and plops into a chair. He pulls an iPhone out of his blazer breast pocket and takes a look.\n\n“I promise, this is the last time I’m going to look at this,” he said.\n\nThis interview was item No. 1 on a rather hefty to-do list – on Schipper’s “light” day no less. A “light day” that included a candidate meeting to schedule additional meetings.\n\nAt this moment, he is officially in campaign manager mode.\n\n“I wear many different hats,” he said. “I have my own consulting business. But I’m focused on the Mark Miloscia for State Auditor campaign right now. I’m also doing some things for Representative Hickel as well.”\n\nIf a statewide race and a competitive state House race weren’t enough, Schipper is also managing Paul Graves’ campaign in the 5th Legislative District.\n\nManaging three candidates is stressful on its own, but Schipper is in charge of running one of the more challenging statewide races of 2016: the Republican campaign for state auditor. There hasn’t been a Republican in that position since 1928.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nWhen former State Auditor Troy Kelley was indicted in 2015, it was Schipper who put a bug in Miloscia’s ear.\n\n“Once the writing was on the wall that our current auditor could no longer be in that office anymore,” Schipper said, “I started talking to him, and I thought it was just a natural fit to work with him on that race. With the work he’s done within both parties, it was just too special of an opportunity to pass up.”\n\nSchipper said Miloscia is an ideal candidate for the position because he “frequently takes on pro bono audit work for companies and government agencies.”\n\nA purple district\n\nSchipper has made the commute from north Seattle to Federal Way almost daily since 2014.\n\nSince getting to know the community, Schipper, who also worked as the state’s Republican Party Communications Director for two years, said Federal Way is one of the most “interesting” cities in King County when it comes to politics.\n\n“These folks work hard and come home to their families,” Schipper said. “They’re not political, they just want a government that works for them, that doesn’t stifle them. They’re a very true moderate district. They won’t like the far-right or far-left person.”\n\nWhile he doesn’t live here, the 30th Legislative District is where he spends most of his 10- to 12-hour workdays.\n\n“In addition to the candidate stuff, I do my best to go to the Farmers Market here,” Schipper said. “Or the North Lake Fourth of July festivities. I’m fortunate to have candidates who have introduced me to these events.”\n\nSchipper added that he’s learned a lot about the community from both Hickel and Miloscia.\n\n“I think one of the biggest things they’ve taught me is how impactful simply listening to someone can be,” Schipper said. “Talking with people when I go to the Farmer’s Market… Just listening to someone, whether you agree with a position or not, can mean a lot and go a long way. And it’s just a simple gesture.”\n\nThe sprint\n\nSchipper had Monday and Tuesday this week to decompress after the grueling travel itinerary of the week prior. Between the travel and his candidate unveiling his plan to address the city’s homeless crisis, Schipper couldn’t remember the last time he had a chance to stop and take a breath.\n\nAfter the unveiling, Schipper had a press conference and debate to gear up for.\n\nDuring the four-day stretch, Schipper and Miloscia lived out of hotel rooms and operated on room service, something typical for statewide politicos.\n\n“That was a pretty high week,” Schipper said. “You just have to keep pushing and push through it. It’s pretty exciting, but now that the adrenaline has run out, I’m a little exhausted.”\n\nHe looks at campaigns as marathons. With October and the “Get Out The Vote” efforts approaching, he said it’s getting to the “home stretch” portion of the race – the point when it’s time to sprint.\n\n“It’s on my calendar,” Schipper said. “I can sleep like a normal person on Nov. 9.”\n\n“Typical” days\n\nMiloscia and Hickel are the faces the public sees during election season. Most couldn’t pick Schipper out from the crowd if they tried.\n\nHe’s regularly the driver and schedule-keeper extraordinaire of the campaign trail. Last Tuesday, Schipper was in charge of getting Miloscia to an 8 a.m. meeting in Auburn, then to Renton for a speech, and then to Seattle.\n\nWednesday was Cle Elum to Suncadia and back. Thursday was on to Walla Walla and back to Federal Way. Friday was Tri-Cities to Yakima and back.\n\nIt’s a brutal pace, and one in which driving isn’t the only work to be done. Schipper said it’s not uncommon for him to break out the iPhone and sort through the 50 emails he got in the last seven minutes while en route to a destination.\n\n“There’s always projects going on that need my input,” Schipper said. “It really just depends on the day. There is no typical day. It just depends on where we’re at and what needs to be done. But I am getting a lot more oil changes, that’s for sure.”\n\nNot for everyone\n\nOn the busiest of days, such as last Tuesday, the first day of a long leg of traveling, the iPhone alarm clock went off for Schipper at 6:30 a.m. For the next 30 minutes he was free to get up, take a shower and get dressed.\n\nThen it’s back to the phone. Schipper said he likes to get to bed early and get at least six hours of sleep. Before getting to bed, Schipper goes through and responds to emails. By the time he wakes at 6:30, the inbox is just as full as it was just hours before.\n\nSchipper then has to get out the door — he has Seattle southbound Interstate 5 traffic to look forward to.\n\n“I hope I don’t get in trouble for this,” Schipper joked, “but I’m actually thankful for the traffic and cruise control. It allows me to sort through any emails or messages I coudn’t get to hours earlier, thanks to the traffic. I’m able to check any news that could be important for us.”\n\nSchipper said he’s gotten abnormally good at memorizing traffic-heavy commutes and the quickest routes to take to events.\n\nOnce he arrives at the Federal Way office, Schipper can map out everything on the docket for both he and Miloscia. From there, he heads off to meetings Miloscia can’t make.\n\nHe said the two regularly reconvene throughout the day to coordinate what’s been taken care of and which agenda items are still in progress.\n\n“With driving, we do a lot of that in the car. I’ve forgotten what the radio sounds like because I never have it on,” Schipper said. “It’s a lot of briefing in the car, going to the meetings, sitting in on them. Just another pair of ears.”\n\nAll work, no play\n\nWhat Schipper does with his evenings depends on how late he gets home and how full the inbox is.\n\n“DVR is truly an amazing thing,” Schipper said.\n\nSchipper grew up in the state and got his Political Science degree from the University of Washington. Being the homer he is, he said he loves the success the Seattle Mariners are having this year. Schipper regularly records the games and watches them once he gets home, after all his candidate duties are done.\n\n“Few things I enjoy more than coming home and finding the Mariners game saved and ready to go,” he said.\n\nSchipper said it’s easy for political consultants to “get stuck” around the job all the time, including by socializing with those in the business. He said he makes it a point never to do that when he has a day off.\n\nWhen election season is over, Schipper blocks off time in the spring to go off the grid and take a road trip or a traditional vacation.\n\nThe high-stress job of managing campaigns is what Schipper loves to do. His only complaint about the career and lifestyle he chose, he said, is not his candidates’ opponents and it’s not the opposing party. For Schipper, the biggest hurdle is not having enough time in the day; too few hours to get everything done.\n\nLike that oil change.\n\n“This, for me, is like… fun,” Schipper said. “So I rarely complain about the stresses on my time. I’m not married, no kids, so I can get away with it right now.”"
