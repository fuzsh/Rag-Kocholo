        "text": "OLYMPIA (April 14, 2017) — Wednesday was the cutoff deadline for policy bills to have passed both houses of the Washington State Legislature and sent to Gov. Jay Inslee for his signature or veto. As in recent years, having Democrats control the House and Republicans control the Senate meant that a lot of policy bills — both supported and opposed by labor — failed to advance.\n\nLegislators are now focused on negotiating budget bills, including the 2017-19 biennial operating budget, and other fiscal legislation deemed necessary to implement the budget. They have until April 23, the final day of the regular session, but few think they’ll agree to a budget by then. If that happens, the governor will call for a 30-day extended session. Or two.\n\nBut for now, here’s a status report on some key working family bills that have been previously described in the Washington State Labor Council’s Legislative Update newsletter and here at The Stand. This is not a comprehensive list. There are other bills upon which the WSLC and its affiliates have taken an interest and position.\n\nBills SUPPORTED by the WSLC\n\nAEROSPACE TAX INCENTIVE ACCOUNTABILITY — HB 2145 (Rep. Noel Frame) and HB 2146 (Rep. Richard DeBolt) would amend existing aerospace tax incentives, which have already been amended several times since they were extended in 2013, to add job conditions resembling those required in other states in order for Boeing to receive tax incentives. Both are in House Finance Committee. See details. These bills are EXEMPT from cutoff deadlines because they would be considered necessary to implement the budget.\n\nAPPRENTICESHIP UTILIZATION—HB 1849 (Rep. Mike Sells) strengthening compliance with existing apprenticeship utilization standards. Passed House 51-47, but DIED without a vote in the Senate Transportation Committee chaired by Sen. Curtis King (R-Yakima).\n\nCOLLEGE FACULTY PAY—HB 1237 (Rep. Mike Sells) allowing full-scope collective bargaining so colleges can use local funds in negotiating faculty/staff wages. Passed House 65-32, but DIED without a vote in the Senate Commerce, Labor & Sports Committee chaired by Sen. Michael Baumgartner (R-Spokane).\n\nCLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION ACT—HB 1646 (Rep. Joe Fitzgibbon) represents an innovative, comprehensive climate solution that invests in 21st century infrastructure and delivers economic and environmental justice to communities disproportionately impacted by poverty and pollution. Now in House Finance. See details. This bill is EXEMPT from cutoff deadlines because it is considered necessary to implement the budget.\n\nCONTRACEPTIVE HEALTH—SHB 1234 (Rep. June Robinson) require insurance carriers to provide a full year’s supply of birth control at a time; 12 months of contraception will improve women’s health and birth outcomes by preventing unintended pregnancies.

This bill is EXEMPT from cutoff deadlines because it is considered necessary to implement the budget.\n\nNURSE MEAL & REST BREAKS—HB 1715 (Rep. Marcus Riccelli) would require that nurses be provided with uninterrupted meal and rest breaks, and says an employer may not require intermittent meal or rest periods. It would also close the mandatory overtime loophole by clarifying that employers may not use prescheduled on-call time to fill chronic or foreseeable vacancies due to staff shortages. Passed House 55-42, but DIED without a vote in the Senate Commerce, Labor & Sports Committee chaired by Sen. Michael Baumgartner (R-Spokane). See details.\n\nNURSE STAFFING—HB 1714 (Rep. Eileen Cody) would ensure that staffing committees are a stronger entity within hospitals and require that the adopted staffing plan actually be implemented.

Marcus Riccelli) reinstating the Motion Picture Competitiveness Program tax incentive to encourage filmmaking in our state and attract a wide range of associated jobs and economic investment.

See details.\n\nBills OPPOSED by the WSLC\n\nCOLLECTIVE BARGAINING RESTRICTIONS—SB 5726 and SB 5727 (Sen. Steve Hobbs) would remove health benefits from the scope of collective bargaining for local K-12 school employees. Instead, school employees would be given token representatives on a statewide board that would purchase and provide benefits, and dictate point-of-service cost-sharing levels and premium costs for districts and employees. Both are in Rules and Ways & Means, respectively. These bills are EXEMPT from cutoff deadlines because they are considered necessary to implement the budget. See details.\n\nFARMWORKER WAGE THEFT—SB 5720 (Sen. Brad Hawkins) creates a new “production-based safe harbor” for growers by which they can avoid liability for unpaid wages for rest breaks as ordered by a state Supreme Court decision. The original bill would have allowed employers to avoid responsibility for payment of wages for work performed outside production. Passed Senate 28-18, but DIED without a vote in the House Labor & Workplace Standards Committee chaired by Rep. Mike Sells (D-Everett). See details.\n\nRELIGIOUS OBJECTORS—SB 5339 (Sen.

It also broadly expands the list of “charities” to include quasi-political groups like the Freedom Foundation.

See details.\n\nTNC REGULATORY PREEMPTION—SB 5620 (Sen. Curtis King) creating a statewide regulatory program for “transportation network companies” (Uber, Lyft, etc.) strongly opposed by Teamsters 117 and other advocates for drivers because, among other reasons, it would repeal cities and local jurisdictions from creating their own stronger standards for TNCs and preempt them from adopting standards in the future. Passed Senate 34-15 and now in House Labor Committee, but is EXEMPT from cutoff deadlines because it is considered necessary to implement the budget because it includes fees for TNCs. See details.\n\nTNC UNEMPLOYMENT EXEMPTION—SB 5362 (Sen. John Braun) would create a special exemption for TNCs so they do not have to provide unemployment insurance coverage for their drivers.
