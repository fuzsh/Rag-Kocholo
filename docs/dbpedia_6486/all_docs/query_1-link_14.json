        "text": "ayor Janice Mironov and Members of Council -- Walter Daniels, Hector Duke, Marc Lippman, Alan Rosenberg, Perry Shapiro, and Marsha Weinstein -- Present\n\nEast Windsor Township\n\nE-News Alert!\n\nMarch 19, 2009\n\nOn Monday, March 16, the N.J. Senate and the N.J. General Assembly, by a one vote margin each, passed Senate Bill S-2577 and Assembly Bill A-3772, the \"Age Restricted Housing Conversion Bill\". The bill is on the Governor's desk. The Governor has the power to stop this bill by a veto, and at this time there would not appear to be enough legislative votes to over-turn his veto. If the Governor signs the bill, it becomes law. There are 400 units in East Windsor which could be affected by this proposal. We are bringing this matter to your attention, because the bill could potentially have extraordinary negative impacts for East Windsor Township, as set forth in the below Mayor's letter to Governor Corzine requesting that he veto the bill.\n\nWe encourage residents to also contact the Governor's office and voice comments. Below is the contact information for the Governor’s office:\n\nPhone – Constituents Relations Office – 777-2600\n\nFax – Constituents Relations Office – 292-3454\n\nE-mail – from website – www.state.nj.us/governor\n\nMAYORS LETTER TO GOVERNOR\n\nMarch 18, 2009\n\nGovernor Jon Corzine\n\nState of New Jersey\n\nP.O. Box 001\n\nTrenton, New Jersey 08625-0001\n\nRE: Senate Bill S-2577/Assembly Bill A-3772\n\nAge-Restricted Housing Conversion Bill\n\nDear Governor Corzine:\n\nI am writing, at the unanimous direction of the East Windsor Township Council, to express East Windsor Township’s strong opposition to Senate Bill S-2577/Assembly Bill A-3772, known as the “Age-Restricted Housing Conversion Bill”, and requesting that you veto this bill.\n\nThe passage of Senate Bill S-2577/Assembly Bill A-3772, is contrary to the public interest and constitutes one of the most stunning, unprecedented and outrageous actions taken by State legislative officials. And on top of it all, the bill was posted last minute in both legislative bodies for “emergency vote”, thereby circumventing the ability of the public and local officials to fully discuss and voice comments on the proposals.\n\nIn summary, the legislation provides to a developer an “as of right” application to a municipal planning board to convert an approved age restricted development into a market rate housing project as long as it incorporates an [undefined] affordable housing component. Upon application by the developer, the town is required to declare the application complete within 30 days, to make a decision within 60 days of completion or the application is automatically deemed approved, and if the town board denies the application, the developer is empowered to file a court action against the town under a summary proceeding. All municipal fees and court fees are waived for the developer.\n\nSince age-restricted housing does not allow for school children, this bill imposes a direct increased property tax burden on local residents, by generating unplanned for student costs and overcrowding school facilities, as well as increased negative impacts on our sewer/water system and road infrastructure, and an increased need for police, public works employees, as well as burdening other municipal services.\n\nThe bill is “anti-democratic”, constituting a fraud on local citizens, and making a travesty of the long-developed well defined legal protections and procedures provided for residents under state and local laws and set forth in the Municipal Land Use Law. Zoning changes and development applications entail a local public process by which everyone has an opportunity to be involved and to input pursuant to a series of public notices and public hearings. This legislation, by fiat from Trenton, changes existing municipal zoning and approved development applications, contrary to well established law, prior legal proceedings and approvals, and with total disregard for our citizens and towns.\n\nThis bill disregards the significant planning and site plan differencesbetween age-restricted developments and other residential communities, in terms of a host of factors including but not limited to layout, types of buildings, unit sizes, recreational amenities, sidewalks and pathways, parking, traffic impacts, and ingress/egress. Compatibility of locations and zones in a town also are important local considerations in developing an overall municipal zoning plan.\n\nThe East Windsor Township Council believes that Senate Bill S-2577/Assembly Bill A-3772 would result in serious hardship to municipalities and taxpayers, would make a mockery of citizen rights of participation, and would unjustifiably undermine local zoning and development procedures and policies.\n\nOn behalf of our community, I respectfully urge you to veto Senate Bill S-2577/Assembly Bill A-3772. As always, we stand ready to work with you and your Administration to identify alternative approaches to assist developers and business entities in this challenging economic climate, without undermining local zoning and planning and negatively impacting local governments and property taxpayers. Thank you for your thoughtful consideration of this important issue."
