        "text": "by RAECHEL DAWSON\n\nFederal Way Mirror Reporter\n\nAs summer nears, many are wondering when the Redondo boardwalk along the Puget Sound in Des Moines will reopen after it was ruined by a storm in November 2014.\n\nDes Moines City Manager Tony Piasecki said people need to wait a few more months.\n\n“We are expecting the Redondo boardwalk project to be completed in the late August/early September time frame,” Piasecki said in an email.\n\nDistrict 30 legislators Sen. Mark Miloscia and Rep. Linda Kochmar secured $1.5 million of the $4.7 million needed for the boardwalk’s repairs last year when lawmakers passed the state capital budget in June 2015.\n\nPlanning for the Redondo Boardwalk Repair Project occurred in fall 2015. Construction began in mid-March this year.\n\nAccording to city of Des Moines documents, the decking on the boardwalk will be made of wood-grain embossed, precast, stained concrete panels and will be secured to the current bulkhead using steel bolts. The existing pilings will be sleeved with plastic pipe and reinforced with concrete fill, with decking attached to the piles with steel bolts.\n\nBecause this isn’t the first time the boardwalk has needed repair, the concrete decking panels were designed to withstand “large log damage” and high wave pressure. The water side pilings, reinforced with pipe sleeves then filled with concrete, are also expected to hold up against Northwest storms.\n\nThe boardwalk will also have low-level lighting installed along the roadside railings that will shine on the deck.\n\nThe project will span from Salty’s restaurant to the south end of Redondo Beach Drive South, which may have lane closures during construction.\n\nCity documents reflect the impacted sections of the road will be coned off and a flagger will control traffic. Still, officials recommend using a different route during this time, which has yet to be determined.\n\nFor more information on the Redondo Boardwalk Repair Project, contact Andrew Merges at amerges@desmoineswa.gov or 206-870‐6568."
