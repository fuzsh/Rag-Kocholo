        "text": "The paper deals with the French view on the morality of peoples considered uncivilized, specifically Southern Slavs inhabiting the territories of today’s Croatia and Montenegro. The problem of morality is analyzed first of all in the context of natural honesty, which was attributed to peoples considered uncivilized. The analysis uses not only the testimonies of French authors, but also French-language descriptions that were popular in France during the Enlightenment, especially the works of Alberto Fortis and Stefano Zannowich. These sources shaping the image of the Morlachs (Slavic shepherds living in provincial Dalmatia) or Montenegrins, which were popular in the second half of the 18th century, are compared with documents related to French rule in Dalmatia (1806–1813). The analysis has allowed to show what place the Slavic communities living in the peripheries of Europe at the time had in the Enlightenment’s discussions on the morality of civilized and savage people.

I try to show that Al-Ġazālī in his criticism of philosophy focused not only on theoretical issues, but that one of the key parts of his criticism are practical issues concerning the philosophers’ way of life. Pointing to specific examples of using the two aforementioned concepts to overthrow philosophy, I propose a different interpretation of these two late works by Al-Ġazālī. Whole book: https://www.wuw.pl/product-pol-12401-Truth-and-Falsehood-in-Science-and-the-Arts-PDF.html\n\nThe text is a re-reading of “The Human Condition” by Hannah Arendt with emphasis on the concept of natality, showing connections between this book from 1958 and the author’s dissertation written three decades earlier. The linking point is the thought of Augustine of Hippo, whose topics Arendt re-wrote into modern language, aiming to ultimate overcome gnosis, of both Christian and modern provenance. The era of nihilism as a modern type of gnosis reduced life to a biological process, a fact Arendt counterbalanced with “the divinity of birth” and, more precisely, with the latent sacredness of spontaneity. However, the operation of overcoming of gnosis can only be grasped through careful research on Arendtian language, which is full of nuances. The hypothesis that Arendt worked on concepts as a “philosophical Marrano” helps elucidate the assertion that her secular anthropology is at the same time a cryptotheology."
