        "text": "They Don't Know What You're Going To Say One of the biggest fears people have is forgetting what they‚Äôre supposed to say in their presentation. This is a reasonable fear because no one wants to feel embarrassed. But, this fear masks an important fact: The audience doesn't know your script. They don't know what you're planning to say. The great contradiction of speaking is that we have to develop our presentations so well that we know the words. We have to pick the right words, sentences, and phrases that generate emotions and make listeners think about the implication of the points we're making. But, they're going to forget 99.5% of those words. They WILL remember the feelings, and they'll remember the ideas that they translate in their own heads about the points you make. So don‚Äôt memorize your presentations word-for-word. Know the flow of your ideas, practice until you don‚Äôt need to think about what you‚Äôre going to say next, and have a conversation with your listeners. If you do forget part of their presentation, don‚Äôt sweat it. Move on to the next point you DO remember and keep going. If you don‚Äôt tell them, they‚Äôll be none the wiser because‚Ä¶ They don‚Äôt know your script! Need help with your presentation? Schedule time in the Comments box to talk about how I can elevate your presentation skills...\n\nYou will never get nervous for presentations after reading this. üëá Have you ever felt your heartbeat racing before stepping in front of an audience?. ‚ÄúWhat if I mess up?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat if I forget what I have to say?‚Äù These are the thoughts that wandered through my head when I first presented to an audience. Now, it‚Äôs the opposite. Here are 5 unconventional things I‚Äôve learnt to do over the years to help me crush my presentation anxiety. 1) Have a powerful walk and take deep breaths While walking up to present, take deep breaths and walk towards the podium with your chest up and shoulders back. Do this even if you are nervous. You must take up space with this ‚ÄòPower Pose‚Äô. Not only will this make you look more confident from the outside, but it will also make you feel confident on the inside because it gives you a feeling of ‚Äúowning the room‚Äù. Plus, deep breathing will allow you to focus on the present and is a great way to reduce anxiety. 2) Have a brief chat with your professor Before your presentation begins, always greet your professor. If possible, have a brief chat with them. A polite ‚ÄúHello, how are you?‚Äù will do the trick. This will help you view your professor as a friend rather than just someone grading you. And the best part is - your professor will also see you in a more positive light after the polite greeting and conversation. 3) Have the mindset that nobody is paying attention We have a tendency to overestimate how much other people notice us. This is known as the Spotlight effect. If you‚Äôre afraid the audience is scrutinising your every move while you are presenting, you are mistaken. They are either more interested in the slide content, or not interested at all and are focused on themselves. Having this mindset allows you to not worry about what other people might think of you during your presentation. 4) Make eye contact While presenting, make eye contact with classmates/friends/people that you are familiar with. Familiarity breeds comfort, and comfort calms us. Making eye contact will not only calm your nerves, but it will also make you look more confident while presenting. 5) Don‚Äôt mug up a script, understand your content instead Contrary to what most people do, reciting a mugged up script while nervous will only make you forget your lines, which will leave you stuttering. You need to be articulate. Instead of mugging up a script, first understand your content. Teach it to yourself as if you‚Äôre teaching a 5 year old. Cement your thoughts. Only then, remember a few keywords that you can elaborate on during your presentation. This eliminates your worry of having to mug up lines and will help you get into a flow state while presenting. And there you have it. 5 unconventional tips to never get nervous during a presentation. What tricks do you use to crush your presentation anxiety? Let me know in the comments below. üëá #linkedinlearning #publicspeaking #confidencebuilding #presentationtips\n\n\"I didn't have time to prepare a short, clear presentation, so I'll just give a long, rambling, boring one instead.\" Have you ever made a last minute presentation and looked into the eyes of an increasingly bored, unimpressed audience? Did you get that cold, alone feeling of panic? As someone who has done their fair share of helping people to prepare their presentations, I can tell you that preparation and, above all, practice are key to delivering a great presentation. I guess you knew that already...but, please read on anyway. Franklin D. Roosevelt said this of his former boss: \"He had a power of words and a power of phrasing which was absolutely remarkable. He was not a great orator in the sense that he had the voice of a great actor, but he had an intensity of feeling and a clarity of expression which made him a great orator in the sense that the message got across.\" Years before, Roosevelt's boss was US President, Woodrow Wilson. Wilson was once asked about the amount of time he spent preparing his speeches. He answered: ‚ÄúThat depends on the length of the speech. If it is a ten-minute speech it takes me all of two weeks to prepare it. If it is a half-hour speech it takes me a week. If I can talk as long as I want to, it requires no preparation at all. I am ready now.‚Äù Unfortunately, many people don't prepare adequately for their presentations. This can be due to a variety of barriers or preconceptions, such as: ‚Ä¢ Believing that preparation takes too much time ‚Ä¢ Thinking that they know the material well enough already ‚Ä¢ Feeling nervous or anxious about the presentation ‚Ä¢ Not knowing where to start or how to structure the presentation But the benefits of preparing for a presentation are clear. By taking the time to plan and practice your presentation, you can: ‚Ä¢ Deliver a clear and effective message ‚Ä¢ Engage your audience and keep them interested ‚Ä¢ Build your confidence and reduce anxiety ‚Ä¢ Anticipate and address potential challenges or questions So, if you want to deliver a great presentation, don't skimp on the preparation. Take the time to plan and practice your presentation, and don't be afraid to reach out for help if you need it. Yes, it takes more effort and skill to be concise and clear than it does to be verbose and rambling. Mark Twain actually said: \"I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead.\" In business, you need to take time for preparation and practice if you want to deliver short, impactful speeches instead of delivering long and low- or no-impact monologues.

Would you like a sample review/rehearse session? Send me a message on LinkedIn or email me. We can set up a day and time. No charge. No obligation.\n\nHave you ever noticed how often you say \"but\" throughout the day? We throw our \"but\"s A LOT into our everyday language. It has become like a punctuation in our communication that runs the gamut from objection to just a break in a sentence. I looked up the official definition of \"but\" just for fun, and this is what I found...\" used to introduce a phrase or clause contrasting with what has already been mentioned\". Think about that for a moment, \"contrasting what has already been mentioned\". That's just it! Every time we throw a \"but\" in the middle of a sentence, we negate anything that we just said before it. Take this sentence for example...\"I really like you BUT...\" Ouch! Or I tried my best BUT... I think you did a great job BUT... I love that idea BUT... See how quickly one little \"but\" can turn a positive comment into a negative one? So I challenge you to make one little change in your communication that will make a drastic difference in how your message is received. Switch out that \"but\" with the word \"and\" and see what you get. \"I really like you AND...I tried my best AND...I think you did a great job AND... I love that idea AND...\" It opens up a whole new world of possibilities for insights and ideas that enhance the quality of your interactions and builds better relationships. ----------------------------------- When you are ready to turn your \"but\" into an \"and\" to discover what is possible for you, click the link below and book your FREE Coaching Consultation Call. https://lnkd.in/dRYJ3Wmq Follow Core Essentials Consulting #nobutsallpossibilities #professionalcoaching #coactivecoach #coressentialsconsulting\n\nQuestions during presentations used to terrify me! But not anymore, thanks to 5 key steps. I used to see Q&A sessions as a test, always anxious someone would ask a question I couldn't answer. My strategy was to tackle them like a game show contestant, trying to respond as quickly as possible. As I listened, I focused on words I ‚Äòknew the answer to.‚Äô The moment I heard those magic phrases, I‚Äôd jump in, often talking over the questioner. And when I didn‚Äôt know the answer? I‚Äôd panic, turn red, and mentally beat myself up. These days, my approach is different, and I LOVE Q&As. Now, I see them as an opportunity for a valuable discussion. Here are the five steps to answering questions that work for me: 1. LISTEN TO THE QUESTION Like really listen. This means actively listening to what the audience member is asking, not just scanning for topics you're comfortable with. Audience questions can be long and rambling because they're processing your information and feeling the pressure of the spotlight. Be patient and give them the space to articulate their thoughts. 2. BE RESPECTFUL Engage with the person asking the question. Don‚Äôt check your watch, phone, or look around the room. This isn‚Äôt your chance to take a break! Keep your focus on them. Your internal dialogue should be positive, aiming to connect rather than suspecting they‚Äôre trying to trip you up. Smile and give them the benefit of the doubt, especially if they are triggering a defensive response in you. Rather than thinking 'they are challenging me', think 'they are passionate about this topic'. 3. REPEAT OR PARAPHASE THE QUESTION Repeating or paraphrasing the question ensures you‚Äôve understood it correctly, gives the questioner a chance to clarify, allows the audience to hear it, and gives you time to think. This step is crucial for questions that are unclear or complex. 4. IDENTIFY THE MAIN POINT Before formulating your answer, identify the key issue of the question. Focus on the essence of the query. This helps you stay on point and reduces the waffle. 5. ANSWER CONCISELY It‚Äôs okay to pause and organize your thoughts. Structure your response logically. Start with a brief answer and support it with a few clear reasons. Aim for conciseness to keep the audience engaged and check if the questioner is satisfied. #presentationskills #businesspresentations I help professionals become more confident, comfortable and effective business communicators. Link to my upcoming courses in the comments.\n\nA couple of my colleagues have commended on my presentation skills, including my professor at a point and I wonder. I wish I could tell them that each time I‚Äôm about to step forward, my heart still races. Like everyone else, I want to sit down and just listen without the burden of dealing with the faces staring at me. But immediately I step forward, my fears vanish and I know this is action time. It‚Äôs either this or nothing else. There is no getting out of this now, so I‚Äôd rather give it my best than cower in fear. Once I start speaking, I have just one thought sitting in my mind: ‚ÄúIf there is just this one chance to prove myself and no other, how do I make this count?‚Äù. Oftentimes, we only have just one shot. So every opportunity you have, give it your best like another one isn‚Äôt gonna come. Here are a few personal tips: 1. Understand the subject you‚Äôre about to speak on: I spend more time understanding the topic than the delivery itself. The delivery is key but ensuring you know what you‚Äôre speaking on goes a long way in building your morale. There is a confidence that comes with that. 2. Practice: The only way you can get better is by practicing to speak in front of people. This means putting yourself in situations where you can speak. Volunteeer to take that 5 mins class presentation. It counts. 3. Be yourself: Don‚Äôt emulate someone else‚Äôs style. You are unique. Owning your uniqueness and allowing it to reflect in your presentation captivates your audience. 4. Speak to your audience: Don‚Äôt speak to the screen. Don‚Äôt speak to yourself. Speak to your audience. This means having eye contact, asking questions, a few jokes (if it‚Äôs an informal gathering), etc. 5. Ask for feedbacks: Get feedbacks from friends, colleagues or tutor. Let them objectively assess your performance. You‚Äôll get better over time. See you in the next one."
