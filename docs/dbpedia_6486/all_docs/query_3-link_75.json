        "text": "I have two work New Year's resolutions and they may be at odds with each other. 1. No meetings scheduled without meeting descriptions and agendas. I've become acutely aware of how much time I spend in meetings and not on focused work. My goal is to make meetings more focused and efficient by providing clear purpose and discussion topics. This extends to having more 10-15 min meetings instead of defaulting to 30 min. 2. More meetings to just chat. While this may seem like the opposite of item 1, it's not. I mean meetings every so often that are just for chatting. Not the last 15 min of a meeting that was meant for something else, but a meeting that is meant to build connection with someone else. Maybe it's someone you don't work with very often OR someone you work with so much that you don't really know that much about them, but building humanity and empathy with our coworkers is IN in 2024. Would love to hear what's on your work New Year's resolution list.\n\nI am still surprised that even senior professionals often struggle to organize efficient meetings. Meetings run over time, involve too many people who don‚Äôt add value, suffer from poor preparation, and lack clear next steps. If you find yourself: ‚ùå Not providing clear objectives and necessary preparation ‚ùå Inviting too many people ‚Äújust in case‚Äù ‚ùå Mismanaging meeting time ‚ùå Failing to agree on next steps You need to rethink your approach to meetings. ‚úÖ Take time to think about how much a meeting should take. Make 10, 15, or 20-minute discussions a thing. ‚úÖ If you run out of time, schedule another meeting to continue. Be respectful of other people‚Äôs calendars. ‚úÖ Booking an hour and finishing in 5 minutes indicates poor planning. Plan accurately. ‚úÖ Set an objective and communicate it clearly. ‚úÖ Let people know what they need to prepare in advance. ‚úÖ Use the last 10-20% of the meeting time to summarize and agree on the next steps. By following these steps, you‚Äôll ensure meetings are efficient, respectful of everyone‚Äôs time, and productive. Do you have any other tips for effective meetings? Share below!\n\nHow much money did that meeting just cost? Everyone should ask themselves that question when scheduling a meeting. Next, ask yourself what is the (theoretical) ROI of that meeting. Or what cost savings could be achieved from having this meeting. I think if people started putting an associated cost to a meeting, meetings would be run more effectively and efficiently. I'm not an advocate for fewer meetings or \"this could have been an email\" thinking. Talking with someone one-on-one has a different impact than sending an email. I do better with a quick call than reading an email; that's just me. But most meetings are lousy when it comes to intention, facilitation, meeting notes, accountability, and action taking. There is no follow-up. There is not resolution. People often feel more confused after the meeting. People aren't tired of meetings; people are tired of shitty meetings.\n\nHow to Schedule a Meeting Like a Pro! So, you know how scheduling meetings can sometimes turn into this long back-and-forth? Well, let's talk about how we can make that a whole lot smoother. üïóWhen scheduling a meeting, avoid asking your clients or colleagues to decide the time. Instead, take the lead in suggesting a time that works for you and propose alternatives for their convenience. ‚úîWhy Avoid Open-Ended Questions: Asking questions like, \"What time works best for you?\" or \"When would be the best time for you to attend the meeting?\" can lead to delays and added pressure on the other party. ‚úîThe Problem with Letting Them Decide: Allowing others to decide the meeting time may result in extended delays as they contemplate and discuss with their team, causing unnecessary pressure and extra work for them. ‚úî The Solution - Take the Initiative: Instead, suggest a specific time for the meeting that works for you, and ask if it suits them. This approach streamlines the process, reducing decision-making stress for the other party. ‚úîAsking for Feedback: Encourage them to provide alternative times if the suggested one doesn't work for them, ensuring a quick resolution without unnecessary back-and-forth. üëç Let's try! - Hi, Jack. The meeting is scheduled for 11 a.m. Does this work for you? Feel free to suggest a different time if needed. - Reply: Yeah, 11 a.m. is fine. Please send the meeting link to this email. Boom! üòé Next time, schedule a meeting like a pro. If you find this informative, share it with someone and let me know how it works for you in the comments. #MeetingScheduling #ProductivityTips #EfficientMeetings #TimeManagement #ProfessionalCommunication #CommunicationTips #JeevaA #Speakbro #communicationSkills #BusinessEtiquette #SchedulingLikeAPro #WorkplaceEfficiency #CollaborationSkills #StreamlinedMeetings\n\nHow often do you have these questions in your mind after some meetings: ‚û° Did I accidentally stumble into a masterclass on 'How to Waste an Hour?\" ‚û° What was the main goal of this sync? ‚û° Did they add me on purpose or by mistake? ‚û° Or Did we just join a competition to see who can stay serious longer? If you've ever had that feeling, here's a friendly tip: when you're the one setting up meetings, you might want to keep this advice in mind to avoid leaving folks with that weird aftertaste: ‚è≤ Timing Matters: Pick a time that suits everyone and keep time zones in mind. ‚è∞ Watch the Clock: Keep meetings under an hour. You don't want to bore people, but also make sure you're not racing against time. üìÉ Guest List Wisdom: Invite the right people. Think about who's vital for the topic you plan to cover - team members, other teams, stakeholders. But don't go overboard. üìù üë®üíº Designate a Note-Person: Chat during the meeting is golden. Assign someone to jot down all the important things. It can keep people engaged, and you can choose a new note-person next time. üí≠ Plan your Meeting: Your meeting plan should cover introductions, topic background, goals, actions, what's next, and Q&A. üîÉ Share Agenda: Share the agenda with everyone before the meeting. Let them know who's talking about what. üõ§ Stay on Track: Meetings can wander or some team members fall into philosophy for too long during the meeting, so you need to make sure to get things back to the plan if they go off track. üóí After Meeting: Once it's done, create a summary. Include notes and any stuff that needs doing. #productivemeetings #meeting\n\nLast week, I set my personal record - over 15 hours in meetings! ü§Ø Meetings are essential for collaboration, but let's be honest, sometimes they can feel like an endless loop of \"meeting about meetings.\" üîÑ The key is to strike the right balance - ensuring we have productive meetings that drive results. Here are some goals I've set to cut out meetings that really could just be emails: üéØ Set clear objectives: that \"decline button\" looks super tempting when a meeting doesn't have a goal mentioned in the invite. üìä Keep it focused and on-topic: let's stop having meetings within meetings. üìù Assign action items and follow up: A meeting where nothing happens afterward really kills productivity and motivation! üì≤ Consider alternative communication methods when appropriate: ask yourself, \"Could a Slack or a short video also work here?\" How do you manage your meeting time effectively?\n\nRecently, I set up a new 20-minute \"virtual coffee\" introductory meeting type in Calendly...and I was immediately skeptical about ever sticking to the time limit. ü§îIt got me thinking: how can I make these short meetings more efficient? I decided to include a clear meeting description and a structured agenda, not just in the calendar invite but also in the reminder email. Sure, my meetings might still run over - I'm guilty of talking a bit too much - but now, I'm stepping in with a concrete plan. Thought I'd share this tip for anyone else looking to keep their meetings concise and on track! #productivitytips #meetings #efficiency ======The Meeting / Reminder Script====== This is a short meeting, and it's sometimes hard to stay on time (usually because of me üòÖ). I've included the meeting overview and proposed agenda below, just to keep us on track and respect our time together. Let's get to know each other! This meeting is our chance for a quick, friendly chat, much like the first conversation we might have at a party. It's brief, but I hope we can share some meaningful insights and get to know each other a bit better. Purpose of the Call: In this 20-minute call, we aim to briefly introduce ourselves, sharing key professional highlights and interests. Our goal is to lay the foundation for a potentially deeper, more detailed discussion in the future. This is an opportunity for us to understand each other's professional backgrounds and areas of interest, setting the stage for future collaboration or more in-depth conversations. Proposed Call Agenda: ¬ª Quick Intros (2 minutes each) ¬ª Main Discussion (5 minutes each) ¬ª Questions and Answers (3 minutes) ¬ª Conclusion and Next Steps (3 minutes)\n\nEver sat through a meeting and thought, \"Well, that's an hour of my life I'm never getting back\"? Well, you're not alone. The problem isn't meetings themselves; it's how they're run. Here's the lowdown on why most meetings crash and burn, and how to ensure yours soar instead. 1. Lack of Clear Purpose: Meetings often derail because they lack a specific goal. If you can't summarize why you're meeting in one sentence, reconsider if you need to meet at all. 2. Wrong Attendees: Ever been in a meeting and wondered why you were there? That's a sign of a guest list gone wild. 3. No Agenda, No Control: Meetings without an agenda are like ships without a rudder‚Äîthey go in circles. 4. Monologues That Could Win Oscars: Ever had one person hijack a meeting? Not fun. 5. No Follow-Through: The meeting ends, everyone leaves, and... nothing happens. The decisions made and tasks assigned disappear into the ether. Meetings aren't about filling time; they're about achieving outcomes. Learn how to transform your meetings from boring to brilliant with the Level 10 Meeting Agenda: https://lnkd.in/giABRGwy\n\nMeetings can drag on forever. You're stuck in a loop, repeatedly talking about the same things. Your day gets eaten up by these long discussions, leaving you drained and with less time for your work or yourself. As I've been discussing lately, I want to share the killing secret with you today so we can strive to be more productive and avoid long meetings. Here's the secret: Pre-Meeting Assignments. This one tip can change everything. Before the meeting, everyone gets a task. They come prepared, knowing exactly what's on the table. This means less time explaining and more time deciding. It's simple. You do some work before the meeting, and then the meeting flies by. You get back hours in your day. Meetings become something you look forward to, not dread. Try it for your next meeting. Watch the magic happen as your meetings get cut in half, leaving everyone more time to do what they love. It's a game-changer.\n\nWhat are you doing about meetings? Research would tell us that we are not using our meeting time effectively. One study with senior managers showed that 65% said meetings keep them from completing their work. 71% said meetings are unproductive and inefficient. 64% said meetings come at the expense of deep thinking. It's time to rethink our approach and ensure that every minute counts. Meetings should drive action, not delay it. How do you ensure your meetings are productive? Here are a few tips to consider: Set up: Before the meeting, clearly define what needs to be accomplished. Show up: Invite only those who are directly involved in the agenda items. Speak up: Keep meetings focused and efficient. If you're struggling to transform your meetings culture, I can help.
