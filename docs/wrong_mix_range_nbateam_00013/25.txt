Bosh also had a game-high 14 rebounds and three blocked shots.

"Defensively, we had no answer for Bosh," Portland coach Nate McMillan told reporters after the Trail Blazers lost for only the second time in 19 games.

Brandon Roy kept Portland in the game with 33 points and 10 assists. His three-pointer forced a second overtime.

Bosh then took over, collecting four consecutive points to start the second extra session, giving the Raptors a 108-104 advantage they never lost.

"You're not going to have much energy but you have to get it done," the Raptors forward told reporters when asked about playing for 55 minutes.

Bosh finished with six points in the period while Roy was shut out.

"We made it tough for him in the end," Bosh told reporters. "He got us early a little bit but we continued to make him shoot jump shots and made it tough for him in the lane."

Toronto thought it would win in regulation, holding a four-point lead with 22 seconds to go.

But Travis Outlaw was fouled on a three-point attempt, which he made with 16 seconds remaining and added the free throw to tie the score at 93-93.

"They snatched a win from us a couple times but we just kept on fighting," Toronto coach Sam Mitchell told reporters.

"You just have to be proud of them (his team) because that was an unbelievable win for us."

Anthony Parker added 25 points and Jose Calderon had 22 points and 10 assists for the Raptors.
