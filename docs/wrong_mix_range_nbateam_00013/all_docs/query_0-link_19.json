        "text": "The Raptors have yet to be informed of Bosh’s intentions by his Chicago-based agent, Henry Thomas, who also represents Wade. Thomas did not respond to requests for comment from CBSSports.com. But the Raptors, aware that Bosh has been a goner for a while, are “100 percent” prepared to move forward with sign-and-trade proposals with the Heat in order to facilitate their All-Star power forward’s departure without losing him and getting nothing in return.\n\nThe Miami Herald has confirmed through Wade family sources that he will re-sign with the Heat. A Heat source told The Herald that Bosh will also sign with the Heat. Bosh is expected to travel to Miami later Wednesday. Wade declined to speak with reporters Wednesday morning at his youth camp being run at Nova Southeastern University in Davie.\n\nAs a possible contingency plan if they don’t get James, the Heat are planning to pursue the Portland Trail Blazers’ Andre Miller in a trade to play point guard for the team, a source said. The Heat could absorb Miller’s salary into their cap space. The Heat have had trade conversations since before the draft about sending point guard Mario Chalmers and a first-round pick to Portland for shooting guard Rudy Fernandez, according to a source. It’s possible the talks have now expanded with Heat forward Michael Beasley and Miller.\n\nKerr, the former Suns GM who left Phoenix after the season and is now working for TNT, compared and contrasted the twin 6- foot-10, 245-pound All-Star free-agent power forwards yesterday for The Post. “I think the attraction of Bosh is that he’s a little younger, a little more healthy than Amar’e. He’s probably a little better defender. Maybe a little better overall player,” Kerr said. “I think Amar’e is more explosive and more feared by defenses. But they’re both excellent players, All-Star players. “I don’t think either one is going to be a No. 1 guy who’s going to lead a team to a title. Both guys need help. . . . I think the reason some people give Bosh a little bit of an edge is the injury history.”\n\nDwyane Wade and Chris Bosh have decided to sign with the Miami Heat while continuing to recruit LeBron James to help them form an All-Star triumvirate that threatens to shift the NBA’s balance of power, two sources with knowledge of the plans told Yahoo! Sports. “They think they’ve got a real chance to pull this off with LeBron,” a league source said."
