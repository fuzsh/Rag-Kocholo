        "text": "When Dwight Howard was 23, he looked to many like the future of the NBA. He had just carried the Magic to the NBA Finals, upsetting a 66-win Cleveland Cavaliers team in the process. He was the only All-Star on Orlando’s roster; as the team’s offensive and defensive centerpiece, he averaged 20 points and 15 rebounds a game in the playoffs. Needless to say, not too much has gone right for Howard since, and six drama-filled years later, he has inexplicably become somewhat of a forgotten man.\n\nThe story of “Superman’s” demise is well known. After their run to the Finals in 2008-’09, the Magic never reached those heights again and Howard eventually demanded a trade, forcing his way out in a protracted year-long process that destroyed his reputation. Adding insult to injury, he concurrently suffered a major back injury — which required surgery in the spring of 2012 — that temporarily robbed him of his athleticism and turned him into a shell of himself.\n\nThe list of knocks on Howard is a mile long. At various points in the last few years, he has been widely criticized for his indecisiveness, immaturity and selfishness. In the five seasons since he made the NBA Finals, his free throw shooting has never improved, his post moves still don’t look very natural and he still acts like an overgrown kid when he is on the court. And, while he has made in incremental improvements to his game over the years, those have been obscured by injuries and a failure to meet expectations. To wit: Howard has played on three different teams over the last three seasons, but hasn’t gotten out of the first round of the playoffs since the 2009-’10 campaign.\n\nGiven all that has transpired — for Dwight in general and for Houston this summer — there isn’t that much enthusiasm surrounding the Rockets as they come into this season. They won 54 games with Howard and James Harden playing alongside one another for the first time, but that solid regular-season performance was overshadowed by a six-game loss to the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the playoffs. After losing Chandler Parsons, Jeremy Lin and Omer Asik in free agency — while striking out in their critical pursuit of Chris Bosh —some actually have the Rockets finishing out of the playoffs entirely.\n\nStill, though, there’s plenty of reason to be optimistic about Houston, and it starts with Howard, who averaged 26 points, 14 rebounds and three blocks a game on 55 percent shooting against Portland in that series. There isn’t another center in the NBA who can put up numbers like that. Were it not for Damian Lillard’s heroics in Game 6, the Rockets would have had Game 7 at home, and everyone could have been talking about how Howard turned back the clock to his Orlando days.\n\nThe reality is that Howard has needed every bit of the better part of two seasons to get back to 100 percent after his back woes. The extent of his injury was severely underplayed by the national media — I remember covering a game in his first few months with the Lakers where he could barely bend over. And while his reputation was busy taking a nose dive because of the perception that he wasn’t giving it everything he had, Howard probably shouldn’t even have been playing for most of that season.\n\nHowever, instead of getting credit for playing through a serious injury, Howard was blasted for a running feud with Kobe Bryant, even though was hardly the first big man to have problems with the Black Mamba’s tendency to dominate the ball. Like before in Orlando, the storyline in L.A. was written — and while there are countless reasons why his teams have never won a championship, Howard, once again bore the brunt of the blame for why the Lakers weren’t getting it done. Clearly, that’s why, when he reached free agency, he simply told Los Angeles, “I’m out.”\n\nThe perception of Howard is quite interesting, really.\n\nChris Paul has never gotten out of the second round of the playoffs, despite playing with All-Stars like David West and Blake Griffin for most of his career. Does that mean Paul is a bad leader who doesn’t have what it takes to win? Of course not. At the same time, Howard has played with exactly three All-Star teammates his entire career — Jameer Nelson in 2009, Kobe in 2013 and Harden in 2014 — and Nelson and Kobe missed the playoffs in those seasons due to injury.\n\nIt has been proven time and time again that you need a good supporting cast to win in the NBA. There are very, very few guys who could do what Howard did in 2009 and 2010, when he carried the Magic to the NBA Finals and then the Eastern Conference Finals by himself. A healthy Dwight makes everyone on his team much better on both sides of the ball. He covers up his teammates’ mistakes defense and consistently commands the team on offense. All of which makes the Howard-is-a-bad-teammate stuff completely ridiculous. When a team can deploy a player capable of blocking shots and control the defensive glass, his teammates can be more aggressive. Similarly, when a team can deploy a big man who averages 18 points per game on 57 percent shooting, that creates more open perimeter shots for everyone else.\n\nHoward is well on his way to a Hall of Fame career. He is a three-time Defensive Player of the Year and an eight-time All-Star who has made eight All-NBA teams and five All-Defensive teams. He is one of the best defensive players and best rebounders in the game, and when you stack Dwight’s resume up against any under-30 player in the sport who isn’t named LeBron, he ends up looking pretty good.\n\nThe problem for Howard, though, is that he’s not compared with his peers, but with Hall of Fame big men like Shaquille O’Neal. It’s no knock on a guy to say he is not as good as Shaq, who is probably one of the 10 greatest players of all time. Not only was the Diesel more skilled than Howard, he was much, much bigger. At 6-foot-11, 240 pounds, Howard is an average-sized NBA center who dominates based on athleticism. In his prime, Shaq was just as athletic, and measured at least 7-foot-1 and 350 pounds, if not bigger.\n\nIn Howard’s case, he didn’t have to be best friends with Kobe for things to have worked out with the Lakers, and he surely needn’t be besties with James Harden for the Rockets to be successful. As long as the pair knows how to play the game — how to move without the ball, how to read the defense and how to anticipate what the other guy will do — they can co-exist.\n\nI don’t need to know about a player’s personality and I don’t really care what his favorite TV show is or whether he visits sick kids in the hospital. I just want to see what he can do on the court and how he helps a team win. Howard can spend all his money on candy, he can play for a different team every season, and he can make reporters wait an hour for quotes after a game. I don’t care. As long as he plays the game at a high level, I will enjoy watching him play.\n\nWe’re in a more analytical, stats-oriented era, but when it comes to players NBA fans have decided they don’t like, we still look the other way. Take a look at the raw stats last season of the guys widely regarded as the four best centers in the league — Howard, Tim Duncan, Marc Gasol and Joakim Noah:\n\nHoward: 18.3 points, 12.2 rebounds, 1.8 blocks, 1.8 assists, 59.1 percent FG\n\nDuncan: 15.1 points, 9.7 rebounds, 1.9 blocks, 3.0 assists, 49.0 percent FG\n\nGasol: 14.6 points, 7.3 rebounds, 1.3 blocks, 3.6 assists, 47.3 percent FG\n\nNoah: 12.6 points, 11.3 rebounds, 1.5 blocks, 5.4 assists, 47.5 percent FG\n\nFor all the negative press Dwight has received about wanting the ball in the post, he is a more prolific and efficient scorer than any of his peers right now. And while the other three are all great defensive players in his own right, none are as long and athletic as Dwight is, and none had to cover up the mistakes of four under-26 starters last season.\n\nDwight also racked up his numbers while playing “just” 33.7 minutes a game last season, his lowest total since his rookie season in 2004–05. (In comparison, Noah played 35.3 minutes per game, Gasol was at 31.4 and Duncan was at 29.2, which makes his numbers at 37 years old even more impressive.) If you like John Hollinger’s PER, Duncan and Howard both finished at 21.4 last season. Noah was at 20.1 and Pau was at 19.3.\n\nHowever you want to cut it, there’s a strong argument that Dwight remains the best center in the NBA, and any team that can pair him with the league’s best shooting guard is pretty dangerous. The Rockets don’t have a third star, but Terrence Jones, Trevor Ariza and Patrick Beverley all have the talent to be starters on an elite team. If Houston makes a deep playoff run this season, don’t be surprised."
