        "text": "Sports fans on social media seemingly always have receipts of players’ old statements that would contradict their current status.\n\nThe latest victim was Portland Trail Blazers star Damian Lillard.\n\nMiami Heat fan HeatvsHaters re-shared a 2011 tweet of Lillard disagreeing with the Heat’s Big Three of LeBron James, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade.\n\n“I am a heat fan lol but I’m not a fan of everyone trying to make their own big 3 lol,” Lillard said. “Not good for the league.”\n\nOver a decade later, Lillard may replicating this with Bam Adebayo and Jimmy Butler. User HeatvsHaters re-tweeted saying, “You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.”\n\nIt was a shock to many when Lillard first requested a trade. His loyalty to Portland and preaches about \"team basketball\" led many to believe he would remain there for the rest of his career. However, after their extension to forward Jerami Grant, Lillard finally requested to be traded from the Trail Blazers.\n\nThe Heat are his preferred destination, given the organization’s culture and commitment to team-oriented basketball. Their recent Finals run likely enticed Lillard to have a chance to win a championship. He is also close with center Bam Adebayo, who he quoted as one of the main reasons he was drawn to Miami.\n\nSo at this point, does Lillard really care about being the “villain?”\n\nMORE HEAT-RELATED STORIES\n\nNikola Jovic trolls Dillon Brooks after Serbia’s FIBA victory over Canada.
