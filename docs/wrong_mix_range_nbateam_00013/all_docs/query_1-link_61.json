        "text": "Sixers rookie Michael Carter-Williams will participate in the Taco Bell Skills Challenge, and former Delaware and Ursuline Academy star Elena Delle Donne, the reigning WNBA Rookie of the Year, will participate in the Sears Shooting Stars competition on Saturday, Feb. 15, during NBA All-Star festivities in New Orleans, the NBA officially announced Thursday.\n\nAs was previously reported, Carter-Williams also will play in the 2014 BBVA Compass Rising Stars Challenge, formerly known as the rookie-sophomore game, on Friday, Feb. 14.\n\nThe Skills Challenge features four teams of two players each competing in a two-round timed relay-style course consisting of dribbling, passing and shooting stations. Carter-Williams will team with Orlando Magic rookie Victor Oladipo. Damian DeRozan of the Toronto Raptors and Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks, the brother of Delaware 87ers swingman Thanasis Antetokounmpo, also will represent the Eastern Conference. The Sevens are the Sixers' NBA Development League affiliate.\n\nDamian Lillard (Portland Trail Blazers), Trey Burke (Utah Jazz), Reggie Jackson (Oklahoma City Thunder) and Goran Dragic (Phoenix Suns) will represent the Western Conference.\n\nCarter-Williams, selected out of Syracuse with the 11th overall pick in the 2013 NBA Draft, leads all rookies in with 17.2 points 5.4 rebounds, 6.6 assists and 2.24 steals per game. He will become just the second Sixers player to compete in the Skills Challenge. Jrue Holiday was runner-up in 2013.\n\nThe Shooting Stars contest features one current NBA player, one current WNBA player and an NBA Legend on each team. Two teams will represent each conference. A two-round competition, the Shooting Stars contest features four numbered shooting locations of increasing difficulty, with each team attempting to make all shots in numeric order in the fastest time.\n\nDelle Donne (Chicago Sky), the second overall pick in the 2013 WNBA draft, will represent the Eastern Conference and be joined by Tim Hardaway Jr. (New York Knicks) and his father and NBA legend, Tim Hardaway Sr. Two-time NBA champion Chris Bosh (Miami Heat) is joined by Hall of Fame member Dominique Wilkins and three-time WNBA champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist Swin Cash (Chicago Sky).\n\nJoining Kevin Durant (Oklahoma City Thunder), the three-time NBA scoring champ (2009-10, 2010-11, 2011-12) on one Western Conference team are Hall of Famer Karl Malone and Skylar Diggins (Tulsa Shock), the No. 3 overall selection in the 2013 WNBA Draft. Stephen Curry (Golden State Warriors) is joined on the second West team by his father, NBA legend Dell Curry, and six-time WNBA All-Star Becky Hammon (San Antonio Stars).\n\nDelle Donne is also partnering with the 87ers for a Lyme disease awareness night during a game against the Maine Red Claws at 7 p.m. Monday at the University of Delaware's Bob Carpenter Center. The Sevens will host a silent auction, where fans can bid on special lime green jerseys the players will wear during the contest, and all fans in attendance will receive a commemorative T-shirt. Delle Donne will also treat a select group of children to a basketball clinic from 4 to 5 p.m. Monday at Ursuline.\n\nAll proceeds from the events will be donated to LymeAid 4 Kids of the Lyme Disease Association, Inc., a financial resource for the families of children who have been diagnosed with Lyme disease.\n\nContact Jason Wolf at jwolf@delawareonline.com."
