A season many believed would at the very least end with a playoff berth has been derailed by injuries, COVID-19 protocols and yet another poor defense.\n\nThe Blazers (18-26) are in 10th place in the Western Conference standings and would have to be considered a long shot to earn a playoff berth now that Damian Lillard has undergone abdominal surgery and is out at least another five weeks when he will be reevaluated."
