        "text": "Update: Jrue Holiday was traded to the Boston Celtics on Oct. 1. Details of that trade can be found here.\n\nThe Miami Heat haven’t experienced this feeling very often.\n\nUsually, when Pat Riley and the Heat organization set their sights on a superstar, it’s only a matter of time before the bright lights of South Beach draw them in. We’ve seen it before with Shaquille O’Neal, LeBron James, Chris Bosh, and, most recently, Jimmy Butler.\n\nOnce Damian Lillard and his representatives made it clear this summer that the seven-time All-Star desired a move to Miami, most of the basketball world assumed it was a done deal — even if the Portland Trail Blazers had no interest in what the Heat were offering in a trade.\n\nThis led to a monthslong standoff that finally ended Wednesday with the Milwaukee Bucks agreeing to trade for Lillard in a massive three-team deal.\n\nIn the deal, Lillard lands in Milwaukee, and Portland gets Jrue Holiday, Deandre Ayton, Toumani Camara, a 2029 Bucks first-round pick and two future Bucks pick swaps. The Phoenix Suns get Jusuf Nurkić, Nassir Little, Keon Johnson and Grayson Allen.\n\nThe Heat thought they had Lillard in their grasp. Instead, they were left holding a major L.\n\nThe reporting out of Portland for months has consistently stated the Blazers had no interest in Miami’s offer, which was reportedly centered on Tyler Herro and multiple first-round picks. Portland already has a stable of smaller, score-first guards, and Miami’s future picks would have little value if Lillard were there leading an Eastern Conference contender.\n\nRegardless, the Heat maintained a patient approach, with hopes. Portland wouldn’t find a better deal and/or Lillard’s stated desire to be in Miami would scare off other suitors.\n\nEven outside of Miami’s past success getting deals like this across the finish line, recent NBA history suggests stars of Lillard’s caliber usually have enough leverage to force their way to the team of their choice. We’ve seen it with Anthony Davis and the Lakers, Paul George and the Clippers, James Harden and the Nets (and the Sixers) and, most recently, Kevin Durant and the Suns. The Heat also benefitted from this recent trend when they acquired Butler in a 2019 sign-and-trade after Butler told the Sixers he wanted to go to Miami in free agency.\n\nSo, it’s understandable why the Heat might have felt so confident their pursuit of Lillard wouldn’t end like this.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nA timeline of the saga that led to Damian Lillard's trade to the Bucks\n\nInstead, this is about as close to a worst-case scenario as the Heat could’ve imagined. Not only did they miss out on adding one of the best point guards in the game, but also they watched him go to a Milwaukee squad that will almost certainly enter the season as the favorites to win the East. And with the addition of Lillard, Giannis Antetokuonmpo will be much more enticed to sign an extension that’ll keep him with the Bucks through the late prime years of his career – and thus remove him from Miami’s potential wish list next summer.\n\nBut this one will probably sting a little more as long as the speculation persists about the Heat’s willingness to go “all in” with their offer.\n\nThe Athletic’s Shams Charania reported earlier this summer that Miami was prepared to offer “three to four” first-round picks along with Herro in a potential deal. Could a more aggressive pursuit from the Heat have ended with Lillard in Miami? Should they have been more willing to include players like Caleb Martin, Nikola Jović and Jaime Jaquez Jr. in trade offers? Did Portland ultimately decide to go in a different direction because Miami wouldn’t budge on its offer? Or did the Blazers genuinely feel the Bucks-Suns package was better for them? We might never know.\n\nLillard’s agent Aaron Goodwin released a statement to the Miami Herald on Wednesday that seemingly addressed this theory: “(The Heat) did everything they could to acquire Dame,” Goodwin said. “It takes two to get a deal done. I appreciate all that Pat, Andy and Micky did to try and make this happen.”\n\nIt’ll be easier to judge the deal from the Blazers’ perspective once there’s more clarity on their plans with the 33-year-old Holiday, who holds more value to contenders than a rebuilding Blazers team clearing the point guard position for rookie Scoot Henderson. As of now, it’s tough to say Milwaukee’s offer was that much better than what the Heat could’ve given them.\n\nBut there’s also a chance Portland decided its stance would be “anybody but Miami” while looking for potential deals because of the Heat’s brazen confidence the Blazers would eventually give in. The Heat didn’t make their stance public, but it doesn’t help when Butler is out at events jokingly mimicking Lillard’s “Dame Time” celebration.\n\nEither way, Lillard is headed to the Bucks, and Miami needs to figure out a Plan B quickly.\n\nGO DEEPER\n\nDamian Lillard trade grades: Bucks cash in; Suns, Blazers swap centers\n\nThe Heat begin training camp next week with a roster that looks incomplete without Lillard in the mix. They’ll bring most of the same faces back from a team that won 44 games last season before becoming the second No. 8 seed ever to reach the NBA Finals.\n\nBut Gabe Vincent and Max Strus, who both started every game of the Heat’s postseason run last year, left in free agency this summer, which seriously damaged the team’s backcourt depth. The Heat were already 25th in points scored per 100 possessions last regular season with Vincent and Strus starting a combined 67 games. After doing very little in free agency, how will they replace that production?\n\nVincent, in particular, was a crucial part of the Heat’s historic playoff run after taking over the starting point guard duties and allowing veteran Kyle Lowry to move to the bench. Can the Heat move the 37-year-old Lowry back into the starting lineup? Would they consider starting free-agent signee Josh Richardson, who hasn’t been a full-time NBA starter since the 2020-21 season? Is Herro now the team’s de facto point guard?\n\nWhoever starts at the point, the rest of the roster, sans Strus and Vincent, doesn’t exactly scream Eastern Conference contender. And we know that as long as Butler, Bam Adebayo and Erik Spoelstra are in the building, anything less than another trip to the Eastern Conference finals will be considered unacceptable.\n\nBut the Heat need to find more firepower to compete with the amount of talent teams like Milwaukee, Boston, Philadelphia (as presently constructed) and even Cleveland can put on the floor. As phenomenal as Butler was during last year’s playoffs, his gradual decline once the finals started showed the Heat’s need for a dynamic partner to share the offensive load with him — especially now that he just turned 34 years old.\n\nMaybe the Heat switch their plans and go after another disgruntled All-Star guard: Philadelphia’s James Harden. Though Harden isn’t exactly an ideal fit with “Heat Culture,” he’s still one of the top playmakers in the NBA, and he’d make life much easier for Butler and Adebayo on the offensive end. However, I find it hard to believe the Sixers would willingly move a piece like that to a fellow Eastern Conference contender.\n\nHoliday is another name several contenders will be pursuing, and he’d be an outstanding fit with Miami on and off the court. His personality would mesh well with Miami’s rugged approach in its locker room, despite his verbal jousting with Butler during last year’s playoffs. Holiday is also coming off one of the most productive offensive seasons of his career, and I’d be terrified for any offense looking to score consistently against the trio of him, Butler and Adebayo. However, Holiday will soon be a member of the Blazers, and we saw how negotiations between Miami and Portland just went with Lillard.\n\nChicago’s DeMar DeRozan or Toronto’s Pascal Siakam are other names the Heat could go after. But it’s tough to find a fit that was more ideal than Lillard, who could’ve alleviated Miami’s offensive woes and possesses a work ethic that fits the “Heat Culture” ethos.\n\nThen, there’s one other complicating factor the Heat must consider: Herro.\n\nAs awkward as things will be at Monday’s media day in Miami, I’m willing to bet Herro will say all the right things in front of reporters. But it’s hard to believe there aren’t any hard feelings after the team so openly made him available in trade talks. Though Herro does have his flaws and missed the majority of Miami’s 2023 postseason run, he’s still only 23 years old and has averaged at least 20 points per game each of the last two seasons.\n\nHerro did send a post on X, formerly Twitter, Wednesday, seemingly co-signing a video of Butler halfheartedly (I think?) accusing the Bucks of tampering after the Lillard news came out. This could be a sign that Herro isn’t ready to cut ties with Butler and the Heat just yet. But who knows where things will stand a few weeks from now?\n\nEveryone deals with rejection differently. Unfortunately for the Heat, they’re the ones dealing with that unfamiliar feeling this time.\n\n(Top photo: Abbie Parr / Getty Images)"
