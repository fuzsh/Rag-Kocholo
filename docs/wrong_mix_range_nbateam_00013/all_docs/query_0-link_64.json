        "text": "MIAMI -- In a game in which both teams enjoyed 14-point leads, the Miami Heat outlasted the Portland Trail Blazers, 117-104, Tuesday night.\n\nMiami's LeBron James had 30 points, six rebounds and nine assists. He also made 11 of 15 shots from the field. It was the sixth straight game in which James scored at least 30 points and shot at least 60 percent from the field, an NBA record.\n\nPreviously, the record had been shared by Moses Malone and Adrian Dantley.\n\nHeat forward Chris Bosh had 32 points, 11 rebounds and made 13 of 16 shots from the field. Heat guard Dwyane Wade added 24 points, nine rebounds and seven assists.\n\nThe Heat improved to 23-3 at home and earned their third six-game winning streak of the season. Miami is 19-5 against Western Conference teams this season, including 12-1 at home.\n\nThe Blazers led 103-101 with 4:42 left, but the Heat put together a 16-0 run to put the game away.\n\nPortland has lost four straight games, all on the road.\n\nBlazers point guard Damian Lillard, who has become a star in his rookie season, had 33 points. He was coming off maybe his worst game of the season, making only 1-of-16 shots and scoring a season-low four points on Sunday in Orlando.\n\nPortland's LaMarcus Aldridge added 29 points, and Wesley Matthews had 20 points.\n\nHeat starting forward Udonis Haslem played just 10 minutes because he suffered a lower-leg contusion. He scored three points.\n\nHeat reserve guard Ray Allen broke a shooting slump that had lasted for four games. He scored 14 points and made 3 of 5 shots from three-point range.\n\nPortland had won four straight games in Miami before Tuesday's loss.\n\nThe Heat avenged a 92-90 loss at Portland on Jan. 10. In that game, Miami blew a 12-point lead with eight minutes to play. James finished with a near triple-double -- 15 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists. But he made only 6-of-16 shots for a season-low shooting percentage of 37.5. It was also the first time in 69 games, including playoffs, that he scored less than 20.\n\nNOTES: Portland forward Nicolas Batum entered Tuesday sixth in the NBA in 3-pointers with 118. ... The flu continues to hit the Heat. On Tuesday, Mike Miller sat out because of flu-like symptoms.. ... Portland 6-11 forward LaMarcus Aldridge is of concern to Heat coach Erik Spoelstra. \"It's size and length with Aldridge,\" the coach said. \"Every time I see him in person, he looks bigger, and you forget how long he is. We have to get to him early and try and chop that tree down.\" ... For five straight games entering Tuesday, Heat star LeBron James had scored 30 points or more and shot over 60 percent from the field. The only other NBA players to accomplish the feat were Moses Malone (1981-82 season) and Adrian Dantley (1999-00). ... For the season, James is shooting a career-best 56.2 percent, including 71.4 over his past five games entering Tuesday. ... Portland coach Terry Stotts said his team has not lacked for effort. \"We've had some good wins and some disappointing losses,\" he said. \"Like a lot of young teams, we have a lot of ups and downs.\" ... Up next, Portland concludes its six-game road trip at New Orleans on Wednesday. ... The Heat travels to Oklahoma City for a rematch of last year's NBA Finals."
