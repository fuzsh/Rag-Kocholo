        "text": "The Miami Heat all-decade team is filled with stars. The start of the decade for the Heat was very promising, as they assembled one of the best big threes of all time. Then as the decade went on, they transitioned from a big three to a talented young core. The Heat started the 2010s with a star-studded roster and ended the decade with a promising roster for the future. Pat Riley and the entire Heat organization cultivated an extremely talented all-decade lineup.\n\nMiami Heat Best from the 2010s\n\nRecapping the 2010s\n\nTo start, the Heat acquired two top ten players in the league in Chris Bosh and LeBron James. Add those two to Dwyane Wade, and they have arguably the best big three of all-time. They were a promising trio and were expected to win a lot of basketball games. Although most believe they underachieved, they were still able to win two championships in the four years that the trio was intact.\n\nIn 2014, James made the executive decision to return back to the Cleveland Cavaliers to try and win a championship in his home town. Bosh and Wade stayed with the Heat, but couldn’t make it back to the Finals. On February 9, 2016, Bosh played his final game in the NBA due to heart issues. In the summer, Wade returned to his hometown Chicago to play for the Chicago Bulls.\n\nWade eventually returned to the Heat after being traded from the Cavaliers. The following season, the 2018-2019 season, would be his last. The Heat had already started the rebuilding process, acquiring assets and picks along the way. The Heat have managed to develop a nice young core while sending Wade off. They ended the decade with star players Bam Adebayo and Jimmy Butler, as well as young pieces like Tyler Herro and Kendrick Nunn.\n\nMiami Heat All-Decade Team Starting Five\n\nGuard – Dwyane Wade\n\nNo surprise here. Wade is the most iconic player in Heat history and one of the best ever at his position. He helped contribute to two titles during the 2010s and much more. Although injuries derailed his last few seasons, Wade is obviously one of the best to ever play the game. During the Heat’s big-three runs, Wade was an essential part of the team. Wade contributed championship leadership, as well as countless memories and highlight plays.\n\nWade was an All-Star for six straight years before leaving the Heat for the Bulls. During those times, he had countless impressive statistical performances. During the first championship run of the big-three era in the 2011-2012 season, Wade averaged 22.8 points, 4.3 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.3 blocks. Wade showed up on the defensive end during hard-fought games and was there to assist James and Bosh during tight stretches of gameplay. Wade will forever be cemented in Heat culture and is widely known as the best Heat player of all-time.\n\nGuard – Goran Dragic\n\nSince the Phoenix Suns agreed to trade Goran Dragic to the Heat during the 2015 season’s trade deadline, Dragic has balled out. Dragic has proven to be an important part of the Heat roster and has contributed to a lot of impressive victories. Dragic is able to bring veteran leadership to a young roster looking to build a strong winning culture.\n\nIn the six seasons so far with the Heat, Dragic has averaged 16.6 points and 5.3 assists. Dragic was also named a first-time All-Star with the Heat during the 2017-2018 season. With the way that the team is headed, Dragic will be able to provide good leadership presence while they build for the future.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRx8qdnrAeI\n\nForward – LeBron James\n\nIt is no surprise that the current Los Angeles Lakers superstar forward is on this list. James was the leader of the big-three dynasty and led the Heat to two championships during his four-year tenure. With the Heat, he was a four-time All-Star, two-time MVP, two-time NBA champion and NBA Finals MVP, and one-million-time lob catcher from Wade.\n\nJames made a lot of great memories during his short time with the Heat. The game-winner against the Golden State Warriors. The ten straight points against the Boston Celtics to shut them out of the 2012 NBA Playoffs. A career-high performance of 61 points against the Charlotte Bobcats (now the Charlotte Hornets). James’ time with the Heat is no short of pure greatness, and he will forever be appreciated by the Heat.\n\nForward – Chris Bosh\n\nIt’s also no secret that the former Toronto Raptors‘ star Bosh is on this list. Bosh was the third piece to the dynasty that was the big-three era. Obtaining Bosh during the 2010 free-agency period was a huge win for the Heat, as Bosh was one of the best big men in the game at the time. Bosh was an All-Star six straight years with the Heat before playing his last game in early 2016. During his time with the Heat, he averaged 18 points and 7.3 rebounds. He also was a key part in helping lead the Heat to two championship victories. On March 26th, 2019, the Heat officially retired Bosh’s number. He is cemented in the Heat’s legacy.\n\nForward – Udonis Haslem\n\nUdonis Haslem is one of the most loyal players the game has ever seen, and one of Miami’s own. Although Haslem wasn’t the most dominant player during the 2010s, he stuck through the team through the decade and provided tremendous leadership. Haslem is a great captain and veteran presence for the franchise. He has helped the franchise transition through several different iterations of rosters. He is also the franchise’s all-time leading rebounder.\n\nHaslem, who was considering retirement, returned for his 17th NBA season this year. With the coronavirus pandemic selling this season short, his plans on returning for another season are unclear.\n\nMiami Heat All-Decade Team Bench\n\nGuard – Mario Chalmers\n\nThe starting point guard for the two championship runs in Miami is a lock for this list. Mario Chalmers played with the Heat for the better half of the decade, before moving on to the Raptors in 2015. Although he didn’t produce the most jaw-dropping statistics and highlights, he was a valuable piece to the Heat this decade. During the Heat’s first championship playoff run, he averaged 11.3 points and 1.2 steals during the playoffs. During his entire time with the Heat, Chalmers averaged 8.8 points and 1.5 steals.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5FFMQZ8sho\n\nGuard – Ray Allen\n\nAll Heat fans are grateful for Ray Allen because of the famous shot against the San Antonio Spurs in Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals. Although Allen started less than 10 games for the Heat, he is remembered for one of the most iconic shots in NBA history. Allen was vital to the Heat as he was the one man that if they needed a three-point bucket in the clutch, he would always knock it down. During the 2012-13 NBA season, Allen shot a great 41.9% from the three-point line. During that year’s playoffs, he averaged 10.2 points and shot 40.6% from three. Allen will always be known as a shooter and a legend among the Heat community.\n\nForward – Bam Adebayo\n\nAdebayo was a late lottery pick for the Heat, and an amazing pick at that. Adebayo was slow to produce the first two years of his career, but during the 2019-20 NBA season, he flourished. He earned his first of most likely many All-Star appearances this year. He is currently averaging 16.5 points, 10.5 rebounds, 5.1 assists, 1.2 steals, and 1.3 blocks. the league has taken notice of how much he has improved and has been a Most Improved Player candidate throughout this season. Adebayo is a great fit for the Heat. The future for him looks bright in Miami as they look forward to building another great team for the future.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eLXKUtY-0s\n\nForward – Jimmy Butler\n\nButler is the newest addition to the Heat. Although he hasn’t been with the Heat for very long, he has made a tremendous impact on their franchise. Butler made the All-Star team this year with the team, one of his five appearances. Butler has brought with him a special type of mentality to the Heat roster. He is an extremely hard worker, and it’s obvious that it has rubbed off on teammates. The four-time All-Defensive Team and two-time All-NBA Team player has made a great addition to the Heat. The future looks bright in South Beach with Butler there.\n\nCenter – Hassan Whiteside\n\nHassan Whiteside didn’t start or end the decade with the Heat but still was an important piece during this decade. Whiteside left the Sacramento Kings to join the Heat in 2014 and was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers during the 2019 offseason. During the 2016 season, Whiteside was selected to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team while leading the entire NBA in blocks. He led the league in rebounds the following season. During his time with the Heat, Whiteside averaged 14.1 points, 11.9 rebounds, and 2.4 blocks."
