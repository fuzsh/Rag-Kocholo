        "text": "Tired of a rainy Pacific Northwest winter and mediocre postseason runs, Blazers All-Star point guard Damian Lillard wants desperately to be in Miami.\n\nBut does Pat Riley’s Miami Heat want him in the Sunshine State enough to execute the kind of deal the Blazers are demanding after Lillard requested a trade in late June?\n\nSome NBA personnel men wonder about Lillard's impact, whether a \"Dame Blockbuster\" would make Miami that much more dangerous, considering the gritty group led by Erik Spoelstra just made the NBA Finals.\n\nBlazers GM Joe Cronin is reportedly seeking four first-round picks and two players (presumably Tyler Herro and point guard Kyle Lowry to make the salaries work). A third team likely will be needed.\n\nThe Heat have already lost two playoff starters - point guard Gabe Vincent, shooting guard Max Strus (Cleveland Cavaliers) - to free agency from an 8th-seeded club that advanced to the Finals by beating Milwaukee, New York and Boston.\n\nThe Heat drafted UCLA forward Jaime Jacquez Jr. with the 18th pick of the first round on June 22, but he is no certainty to crack the rotation and could be part of a Lillard package. Jacquez already hurt his shoulder in Las Vegas summer-league play.\n\nMore: Heat, Panthers make South Florida center of the sports universe | D'Angelo\n\n“They would move up a notch,’’ one Western Conference scout told The Palm Beach Post. “The only issue is depth with Vincent and Strus gone and maybe Lowry. Boston has more balance and you can’t count out Milwaukee. If this deal is made with Lowry, I’d still go Boston, Bucks and Heat third.\n\nThe Lillard Sweepstakes may just be getting started judging by Cronin’s first remarks since the trade demand.\n\nSpeaking on Monday from the Las Vegas summer league, Cronin told reporters, “If it takes months, it takes months. We’re going to be patient. We’re going to do what’s best for our team.’’\n\nAaron Goodwin, Lillard’s agent, told Portland brass Lillard will only accept a trade to the Heat, but Cronin is not listening and has opened up the bidding. Reportedly, the Clippers and Celtics have made offers.\n\nGoodwin has gone as far as telling other teams Lillard won’t play for them, but he is in the middle of a four-year contract and a holdout would be costly. Lillard stands to make $45.6 million next season and $48.7M in 2024-25, the pact’s final year.\n\n“He makes a ton of money in the last two years of his contract and by then his effectiveness will be less,’’ the Western scout said. “I think Miami is concerned about that. I don’t know if Miami is the favorite any more but we’ll see.’’\n\nIndeed, there is skepticism about a Lillard investment considering the Weber State alum is 32 and led the Blazers to the Western finals just once – in 2018-19 when they were swept by the Warriors. That’s the last time Portland made it out of the first round.\n\nBut Lillard averaged 32.8 points last season and shot 37.1 percent from 3.\n\n“They run the risk of making a big change but not knowing the impact positively or negatively,’’ an Eastern Conference personnel director said. “Lillard is a small guard (6-foot) who has struggled to advance in the playoffs against bigger guards.’’\n\nThe Eastern personnel director would’ve enjoyed seeing this Heat squad run it back with Vincent and Strus and see what effect Herro would have brought in a backup role.\n\nHerro, the 2022 Sixth Man of The Year, missed virtually the whole playoff run after breaking his hand.\n\n“The question is Miami was already good,’’ the personnel director said. “They were in the Finals. So the question of trying to add to this team or change this team is a good debate. They won with the roster without Herro. If you added Herro to that group, maybe another role guy, how good are they?’’\n\nLillard does not put Heat at top of Eastern Conference\n\nEven with a Lillard addition, the Eastern personnel man doesn’t see Miami jumping to the top of the East. “I would think the same three best teams in the East would still be Milwaukee, Boston and Miami and really it could be any order pending injuries,’’ he said.\n\nOf course, it’s about star power and the Heat would have its new Big 3 of Lillard-Jimmy Butler-Bam Adebayo. Not exactly LeBron James-Dwyane Wade-Chris Bosh of the championship years but still a national TV draw.\n\nAn NBA assistant coach says the Heat proved more fluid in the postseason minus Herro because it allowed Butler more time with the ball.\n\n“With Herro, there were too any ballhandlers and not enough defense,’’ the assistant coach said. “Jimmy is better when he has the ball a lot to control the pace.\n\n“They’re better with Lillard but it’s possible now they’re the type of team that just gears up for April and May, realizing they can’t sustain a 55-win season,’’ the assistant added.\n\nOne former NBA scout, Michael VandeGarde, who runs a scouting service, said, “If it’s Herro, Lowry, picks and prospects for Lillard, it’s a massive upgrade. But it comes down to finding the role players and Miami is good at that.’’\n\nThe Heat could have offered Vincent what the Lakers offered – three years, $33 million – but Miami owner Mickey Arison was concerned about the new punitive measures of the luxury tax.\n\nA Lillard-Lowry point-guard tandem is tantalizing if the former NBA champion is left out of the deal. Reports are the Heat pushed to include Herro and fading sharpshooter Duncan Robinson’s pact instead of Lowry. Another report said talks are still preliminary.\n\n“With Miami losing Vincent and Strus and whoever is included in the trade, I don’t know what kind of team they will have pertaining to depth,’’ an Eastern Conference assistant GM said. “They also could be an injury away from struggling to get wins.’’"
