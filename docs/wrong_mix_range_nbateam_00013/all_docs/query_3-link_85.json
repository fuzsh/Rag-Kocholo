        "text": "Chris Bosh\n\nFILE - In this May 8, 2014, file photo, Miami Heat center Chris Bosh celebrates after the Heat defeated the Brooklyn Nets 94-82 in Game 2 of an NBA basketball Eastern Conference semifinal series in Miami. Two people familiar with the situation say that Bosh has agreed to a maximum deal with the Heat. The people said that Bosh will be getting a five-year deal worth about $118 million. The people spoke to The Associated Press on Friday, July 11, 2014, on condition of anonymity because neither the team nor Bosh had publicly announced the deal. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee, File) ORG XMIT: NY163\n\n(Wilfredo Lee)\n\nMIAMI, Fla. -- Friday began very difficult for Miami Heat fans as LeBron James announced that he was going to go back to his hometown of Cleveland.\n\nHowever, the news improved significantly for the team as power forward Chris Bosh announced that he would be resigning, first reported by Yahoo sports NBA insider Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nThe contract is a five-year, $118M deal that will keep Bosh in South Florida. Bosh was in serious talks with the Houston Rockets, as the team offered him a four-year, $88M contract. The Rockets were convinced that Bosh would accept, as they traded Jeremy Lin to the Los Angeles Lakers to clear up the necessary cap space.\n\nNow, the Rockets must decide whether or not they match the offer sheet that Chandler Parsons signed with the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nWith Bosh back to Miami, the next step for the Heat is to bring back shooting guard Dwyane Wade. Joe Kotch of Sheridanhoops.com reported that Wade will be offered a max contract as well.\n\nWith the money available after James' departure, look for the Heat to go after another free agent. Guys like Trevor Ariza, Luol Deng, Pau Gasol and possibly Lance Stephenson will be considered."
