        "text": "Bruce Ely/The Oregonian/OregonLive\n\nBy Geoffrey C. Arnold, The Oregonian/OregonLive\n\nThe 2018 NBA draft tips off Thursday, giving teams a another chance to make history, for better or worse. For teams like the Portland Trail Blazers, who have made multiple picks that turned out to be busts, the draft can be history-making for the wrong reasons. So we're taking a look at the 31 of the biggest draft busts in NBA history.\n\nDid we miss anyone? Sign into the comments and make you case to have a player added to this list.\n\n31. LaRue Martin, No. 1 pick, 1972 draft (Portland Trail Blazers)\n\nRoger Jensen/The Oregonian/OregonLive\n\nMartin outplayed Bill Walton during a college game between Martin's Loyola-Chicago team and Walton's juggernaut UCLA squad. Martin posted 19 points and 18 rebounds, but the Bruins rolled 92-64. However, Martin's play set the basketball world on fire and the Blazers selected him, passing over future Hall of Fame players Julius Erving and Bob McAdoo, along with guard Paul Westphal. Martin averaged 5.3 points and 4.6 rebounds during four seasons in Portland.\n\n30. Robert Swift, No.12, 2004, (Seattle Sonics)\n\nTed S. Warren/AP\n\nChosen straight out of high school, the 7-foot Swift was selected ahead of Al Jefferson and Josh Smith. He struggled with injuries and poor play, and he averaged 4.3 points and 3.9 rebounds a game in just 97 games in four seasons with the franchise (three in Seattle, one in Oklahoma City).\n\n29. Dajuan Wagner, No. 6, 2002 (Cleveland Cavaliers)\n\nDuane Burleson/AP\n\nWagner, who once scored 100 points in a high school game and averaged 42 points a game during one prep season, was selected before Amar'e Stoudemire, Caron Butler and Tayshaun Prince. He averaged 9.4 points a game in four seasons and was out of the league after struggling with health issues.\n\n28. Kent Benson, No. 1, 1977 (Milwaukie Bucks)\n\nGeorge Brich/AP\n\nHe was a member of the Indiana Hoosiers team that went 31-0 on the way to winning the national championship in 1977 (that squad is the last Division I college team to go undefeated in a season). Drafted ahead of Walter Davis, Bernard King and Jack Sikma, Benson played for four teams during 11 seasons in the NBA, averaging 9.1 points and 5.7 rebounds a game.\n\n27. Trajan Langdon, No. 11, 1999 (Cleveland Cavaliers)\n\nMark Duncan/AP\n\nThe first Alaskan player to play in the NBA, Langdon set a Duke program record for most career three-pointers. His accuracy didn't carry over to the NBA, he played just three seasons in the NBA, averaging 5.4 points a game during his career.\n\n26. Robert \"Tractor\" Traylor, No. 6, 1998 (Dallas Mavericks)\n\nAssociated Press\n\nThe 6-foot-8 Traylor earned his nickname while weighing at or more than 300 pounds during his college days at Michigan. The Mavericks selected Traylor, but immediately traded him to the Milwaukee Bucks for Pat Garrity and a European prospect named Dirk Nowitzki. Traylor played seven seasons, averaging 4.8 points and 3.7 rebounds a game. Nowitzki just finished his 20th season, all with the Mavericks. Traylor was found dead in Puerto Rico in 2011, at age 34.\n\n25. Michael Olowokandi, No.1, 1998 (Los Angeles Clippers)\n\nKevork Djansezian/AP\n\nThere were red flags before the Clippers selected Olowokandi before Vince Carter, Dirk Nowitzki and Paul Pierce. He started playing basketball at age 18 and walked on at the University of Pacific. He never came close to living up to his potential, never averaging more than 13 points a game during a single season and he finished his career averaging 8.3 points and 6.8 rebounds a game.\n\n24. Luke Jackson, No. 10, 2004 (Cleveland Cavaliers)\n\nTony Dejak/AP\n\nHard to know what the Cavaliers were thinking when they selected Jackson out of the University of Oregon. They had drafted LeBron James the previous year and Jackson played the same position as James. Jackson was never a good fit in Cleveland, appearing in just 46 games in two seasons before he was traded to Boston and waived by the Celtics before the season began.\n\n23. Joe Kleine, No. 6, 1985 (Sacramento Kings)\n\nWalter Zeboski/AP\n\nThe Kings opted for the big center out of Arkansas, instead of selecting Karl Malone, Joe Dumars, Detlef Schrempf or Chris Mullin. Kleine did play 15 seasons and won a NBA championship ring (he was a member of the Bulls in 1998), but his best statistical season was with the Kings in 1985, when he averaged 9.8 points a game.\n\n22. Bo Kimble, No. 8, 1990 (Los Angeles Clippers)\n\nGetty Images\n\nRemember those high-scoring Loyola Marymount teams with Kimble and Hank Gathers? Gathers collapsed and died during a game in 1990, but Kimble led the nation in scoring at 35.3 points a game and the Clippers selected him. He struggled in the NBA, averaging just 5.6 points in two seasons with Clippers before he was traded to New York Knicks. He appeared in just 105 games in three seasons.\n\n21. Shawn Bradley, No. 2, 1993 (Philadelphia 76ers)\n\nRoberto Borea/AP\n\nHe was tall at 7-6, but really frail at 245 pounds. That made him the biggest gamble and mystery of the draft and the 76ers chose him over Penny Hardaway, Jamal Mashburn and Vin Baker. He played three seasons in Philly, averaging 9.7 points, 7.5 rebounds and 3.2 blocked shots a game. However, he gained more attention for the number of players who dunked on him during his career.\n\n20. Kwame Brown, No. 1, 2001 (Washington Wizards)\n\nNick Wass/AP\n\nHe reportedly told then Wizards coach Doug Collins, \"If you draft me, you'll never regret it.\" Well then Wizards president Michael Jordan - yes, that one - made Brown the first No. 1 pick to be selected out of high school. The Wizards could've selected Pau Gasol, Tyson Chandler, Tony Parker, Joe Johnson or Zach Randolph. Brown played 12 seasons, but he averaged just 6.6 points and 5.5 rebounds a game with eight different teams.\n\n19. Stromile Swift, No. 2, 2000 (Vancouver Grizzlies)\n\nLance Murphey/AP\n\nJamal Crawford and Hedo Turkoglu were available, but the Grizzlies opted for 6-10 forward out of Louisiana State. Swift played seven of his 11 NBA seasons with the Grizzlies, averaging 8.7 points and 4.8 rebounds a game.\n\n18. Chris Washburn, No. 3, 1986 (Golden State Warriors)\n\nAssociated Press\n\nDrug addiction derailed his career before it ever really got started. The 6-11 center received a lifetime ban from the NBA in 1989 after he failed three drug tests in three years. Washburn played in only 72 games over two seasons and averaged 3.1 points and 2.4 rebounds a game.\n\n17. Frederic Weis, No. 15, 1999 (New York Knicks)\n\nGetty Images\n\nWeis is known for being on the receiving end of the famous Vince Carter \"Dunk of Death\" in the 2000 Olympics. He played for the Knicks summer league team, but he never played in a regular season game with the Knicks. Influenced by his unscrupulous agent, who owned a piece of Weis's team in France, the 7-foot-2 Weis decided to return to play in France.\n\n16. Steve Stipanovich, No. 2, 1983 (Indiana Pacers)\n\nDavid Breslauer/AP\n\nThe Pacers saw the 7-1 Stipanovich as the best center this side of Ralph Sampson and selected him instead of players like Clyde Drexler, Byron Scott, Darrell Harper and Jeff Malone. Stipanovich suffered a degenerative left knee injury that was so bad that he \"couldn't even cut the grass\" and he retired after just five seasons, averaging 13.2 points and 7.8 rebounds a game.\n\n15. Sebastian Telfair, No. 13, 2004 (Portland Trail Blazers)\n\nBrent Wojahn/The Oregonian/OregonLive\n\nThe latest in a long line of star point guards - Kenny Anderson, Dwayne \"Pearl\" Washington, Stephon Marbury, Mark Jackson - out of New York City, Telfair was arguably the most hyped. Then Louisville coach Rick Pitino reportedly told Telfair he wasn't ready for the NBA out of high school and implored him to enroll in college. The 6-foot Telfair was a disaster for the Trail Blazers, but improved later in his career to average 9.8 points and 3.0 assists a game during a 12-year career with eight teams.\n\n14. Bryant \"Big Country\" Reeves, No. 6, 1995 (Vancouver Grizzlies)\n\nChuck Stoody/AP\n\nDamon Stoudamire and Michael Finley were still on the board when the Grizzlies decided to make Reeves their first ever draft pick as a franchise. The 7-foot, 275-pound Reeves, a dominant center at Oklahoma State, was expected to be very effective in the NBA. He posted decent numbers in his first three seasons, but a knee injury and back problems hampered his career and forced him to retire in January 2002.\n\n13. Adam Morrison, No. 3, 2006 (Charlotte Hornets)\n\nBill Kostroun/AP\n\nNot allowing Morrison's sobbing following Gonzaga's loss in the NCAA tournament to deter them, the Bobcats passed on Brandon Roy, Rudy Gay, Kyle Lowry, J.J. Redick and Rajon Rondo to draft the 'stache.' He possessed a reliable perimeter shot, but he really didn't develop other aspects of his game and struggled in the NBA. He averaged 11.8 points a game and shot just 37 percent from the floor in his rookie season. He suffered a season-ending torn ACL in a preseason game in 2007 and played in just three more seasons.\n\n12. Dennis Hopson, No. 3, 1987 (New Jersey Nets)\n\nGetty Images\n\nLook at the players the Nets passed over to select Hopson, who lasted just five years in the league: Scottie Pippen, Reggie Miller, Kevin Johnson, Kenny Smith and Mark Jackson. The Nets won 19 games during Hopson's rookie season, second-worst in the league.\n\n11. Joe Smith, No. 1, 1995 (Golden State Warriors)\n\nDavid Phillip/AP\n\nWhat's notable is Smith lasted 16 seasons in the NBA. Still, he was selected ahead of Kevin Garnett, Rasheed Wallace and Jerry Stackhouse, but never came close to them in production, averaging 10 points and 6.4 rebounds a game during his career. Smith also played for 12 teams, tying him for most all-time with Jim Jackson, Chucky Brown and Tony Massenburg.\n\n10. Darius Miles, No. 3, 2000 (Los Angeles Clippers)\n\nBill Janscha/AP\n\nNone other than Michael Jordan himself compared Miles to Kevin Garnett and said he would've used the No. 1 pick to select Miles out of high school. Miles and Garnett were similar in their physiques, but that's where the similarities abruptly come to an end. Miles possessed a questionable work ethic and a nasty attitude that resulted in him playing for four teams in his eight seasons.\n\n9. Raef LaFrentz, No. 3, 1998 (Denver Nuggets)\n\nDavid Zalubowski/AP\n\nIt's hard to fault the Nuggets for selecting LaFrentz. He was a two-time, first-team All-American at Kansas. He possessed a solid stroke from the perimeter and he was a good rebounder and shot blocker. However, he played in just 12 games before a torn ACL in his left knee ended his rookie season. He produced decent numbers during his 11-year career, just not numbers worthy of being the No. 3 pick.\n\n8. Ed O'Bannon, No. 9, 1995 (New Jersey Nets)\n\nDaniel Hulshizer/AP\n\nHis best days - college basketball’s most outstanding player, leading UCLA to its first national title in 20 years, most outstanding playing of the Final Four - were already behind him by the time of the NBA draft. He was too skinny for the physical NBA and his deteriorating knees didn't help. The Nets traded him in his second season and he was out of the league at age 24.\n\n7. Jonathan Bender, No. 5, 1995 (Indiana Pacers)\n\nTom Olmscheid/AP\n\nThe prep star opened eyes when he scored 31 points in the McDonald's All-American game, rocketing his stock up the draft charts. The 6-11 draftee was awfully thin and his frail physique led to numerous injuries. He played in at least 60 games just once and missed three consecutive seasons with knee problems during his seven-year career.\n\n6. Eddy Curry, No. 4, 2001 (Chicago Bulls)\n\nAnn Heisenfelt/AP\n\nScott Skiles, then the Bulls coach, was asked what Curry could do to improve his rebounding skills. Skiles replied, \"Jump.\" That tells you alot about Curry, who was known for his profound lack of work ethic. Worried about a possible congenital heart condition, the Bulls traded Curry to New York, where he averaged 13.6 points and 6.0 rebounds a game in his first season and 19.6 points and 7.1 rebounds a game during his second season. But Curry reverted back old ways in the following seasons, often coming into training camp overweight and unprepared.\n\n5. Anthony Bennett, No. 1, 2013 (Cleveland Cavaliers)\n\nTony Dejak/AP\n\nHe averaged 4.2 points and three rebounds a game in 52 games during his rookie season. It only took four years before Bennett's NBA options ran out. He played in just 151 games, averaging 4.4 points and 3.1 rebounds a game.\n\n4. Pervis Ellison, No. 1, 1989 (Sacramento Kings)\n\nEd Bailey/AP\n\nHe earned the nickname \"Never Nervous Pervis\" for his cool and calm demeanor while leading Louisville to the national championship. However, he played in just 34 games before a season-ending knee injury in his rookie season. He never played a full season because of injuries and his nickname was changed to \"Out of Service Pervis.\"\n\n3. Greg Oden, No. 1, 2007 (Portland Trail Blazers)\n\nBruce Ely/The Oregonian/OregonLive\n\nThe hype surrounding Oden was stratospheric after he led Ohio State to the national championship game. Seen as a franchise-changing, once-in-a-generation player, the Blazers selected him to join Brandon Roy and LaMarcus Aldridge, causing fans to start dreaming on multiple NBA titles. Oden's rookie season ended before it began after he had microfracture surgery on his knee. Multiple microfracture surgeries resulted in him missing three entire seasons and playing in just 82 games during five seasons with the Blazers. Oh, and by the way, the Blazers passed up on Kevin Durant.\n\n2. Darko Milicic, No. 2, 2003 (Detroit Pistons)\n\nPaul Sancya/AP\n\nPistons general manager Joe Dumars had a choice between Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and Milicic. He chose Milicic, thought to be the next Dirk Nowitzki. The 7-foot Milicic was playing behind forwards Rasheed Wallace and Ben Wallace, and he rarely got off the bench, playing in 71 games in his first two seasons. Milicic had a career average of 6.0 points a game and 2.9 rebounds a game while playing for six teams in 10 seasons.\n\n1. Sam Bowie, No. 2, 1984 (Portland Trail Blazers)\n\nRick Stewart/AP\n\nBowie's career numbers - 10.9 points, 7.5 rebounds, 1.8 blocks a game - during his 10-year career aren't bad. However, the Blazers didn't draft Michael Jordan, arguably the greatest player in NBA history. They also passed up on Charles Barkley and John Stockton, both Hall of Fame players. The Blazers did have Clyde Drexler on the roster, so they didn't need another shooting guard/small forward. But still, they'll never be allowed to forget that draft.\n\nBowie suffered a broken left leg in 1985 and a broken right leg in 1986. He followed that up by fracturing his right tibia during the next preseason reportedly while walking on the court before a game, forcing him to miss the entire 1987-1988 season."
