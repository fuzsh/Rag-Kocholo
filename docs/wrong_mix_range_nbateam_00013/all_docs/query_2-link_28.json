It’s that time of year where we talk about the teams still alive, with a chance to win a championship.\n\nHow the Blazers are Like Online Dating\n\nBumble, Hinge, and the Trail Blazers roster take center stage in the Dave and Dia Podcast. Your favorite Portland Trail Blazers podcast is back with all kinds of off-season laughs, topics, and analogies to carry you through the dog days of September.\n\nAdelman Thanks Blazers’ Fanbase in Hall of Fame Speech\n\nFormer Trail Blazers head coach Rick Adelman detailed his time in Portland during his Hall of Fame speech.
