        "text": "MIAMI (WSVN) - Days after news broke of Chris Bosh’s failed physical exam, and Pat Riley’s announcement of the end of his Heat career, Bosh has released a heartfelt statement to his fans and team.\n\n“It’s funny how things change,” starts his note, posted on his official website, Friday afternoon. “All I have right now associated with basketball are my friends and memories. And I’m so thankful for those things. I remember just a few years ago when the Big 3 were together and we were having a ball playing the game we love with some of the most professional, talented guys the NBA has ever seen.”\n\nBosh went on to thank not only his Miami Heat fans here in South Florida but his fans around the world.\n\n“I remember the fans of Miami coming out to see the show every night. The love, the compassion and the energy we felt was second to none. I want to thank the city of Miami from the bottom of my heart because things may change but the good times will last forever in my memories. Thank you!”\n\nTo read the rest of his letter to his fans and Miami Heat family, click here.\n\nHeat President Pat Riley delivered the news Monday, revealing that the team is essentially out of options with Bosh — especially after he failed a physical last week and wasn’t able to get cleared by team and other doctors to get back on the floor.\n\nCopyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp.
