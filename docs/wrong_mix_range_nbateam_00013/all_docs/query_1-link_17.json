        "text": "Chris Bosh and the Miami Heat shocked the Portland Trail Blazers in a 108-107 victory while LeBron James sat out with a groin injury. Dwyane Wade tied the game at 105 with 26 seconds remaining, but Nicolas Batum put the Blazers up two with 7.7 seconds left for Miami to take the final possession. Bosh caught a pass off a drive-and-kick from Wade and drained the game-winner from deep:\n\nBosh had a huge game for Miami, scoring a game-high 37 points on 26 field goal attempts. He also finished with a double-double, grabbing 10 rebounds. Wade finished with 16 points and seven assists.\n\nLaMarcus Aldridge was outplayed by Bosh, scoring 22 points on 9-for-22 shooting. Wesley Matthews finished with a team-high 23 points. Damian Lillard only attempted nine field goals, but went four-of-seven from deep for 16 points on the night.\n\nThe Heat improved to 23-7, bouncing back from their overtime loss to the Sacramento Kings on Friday. Portland drops to 24-6 on the season.\n\nMore from SB Nation NBA:\n\n• The Hook: Rethinking the NBA draft lottery\n\n• The Lakers come to grips with reality\n\n• Why players don’t like Blake Griffin\n\n• Prada's pictures: Phoenix's 2-headed dragon and Drummond's development"
