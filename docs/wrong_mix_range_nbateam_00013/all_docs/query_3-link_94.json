        "text": "TORONTO \"” For a second consecutive year, Miami Heat forward Chris Bosh will have his season interrupted around the NBA All-Star Break.\n\nThe only difference is this time it happened before, and not, after the game.\n\nOn Friday, Bosh was ruled out of the weekend festivities because of a strained calf. He will miss both the 3-point contest Saturday and Sunday\"™s game at Air Canada Center. The league announced Atlanta Hawks forward Al Horford as his replacement in the game, and Portland\"™s C.J. McCollum was added to the 3-point competition.\n\nBosh even looked toward the second half of the season.\n\n\"œWell, I mean, we have to be more consistent,\" Bosh said. \"œWe\"™re still, of course, like a mix of young and old and we try to figure things out as a team. But we need to be more consistent and put a string of wins together and not let a bad loss knock us off course of what we\"™re trying to do.\"\n\nThe injury appeared to have caught both players off guard. Wade spoke at length at what it was going to be like watching Bosh in the 3-point contest for the first time.\n\n\"œIt\"™s going to be fun,\" Wade said. \"œI\"™m looking forward to it.\"\n\nAfterward, the two posed for pictures and held a joint photo session for the league. Wade posted some of the images to his Snapchat account.\n\nThe narrative changed a few hours later.\n\nYahoo Sports first reported Bosh would miss the game because of injury. It marked the second consecutive year a Heat player was sidelined. Last season Wade opted not to play because of hamstring issues.\n\nFor Bosh, it slows the momentum he gained the past five months. He survived a scary ordeal when his life was threatened because of the blood clots. He wasn\"™t allowed to do anything basketball-related for seven months.\n\nA healthy Bosh returned to the court last September, quickly reverting to old form. His averages of 19.1 points and 7.4 rebounds while shooting a team-high 36.5 percent from the 3-point line were enough to earn an 11th All-Star appearance.\n\nThe injury also ruined Bosh\"™s opportunity to play an All-Star game in the city of the team that drafted him. Bosh played for the Raptors from 2003-10 before joining the Heat.\n\n\"”\"”\"”\n\nÂ©2016 Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.)\n\nVisit the Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) at www.sun-sentinel.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC."
