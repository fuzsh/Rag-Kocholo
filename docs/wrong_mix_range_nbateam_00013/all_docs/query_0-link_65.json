        "text": "Chris Bosh revealed on ESPN’s First Take this morning that not only is he still working out and still able to play basketball but also interested in possibly making a comeback this season.\n\n“Yeah, I’m trying to comeback,” a broadly grinning Bosh said during the show. “Man, I see all these guys shooting threes and not playing defense — man, I gotta get some of it.”\n\nNaturally, that eventually led to a discussion of which teams he’d most like to join and he indicated that he’d be interested in the top six teams.\n\nAnd while he somewhat strangely tried to backpedal when Stephen A. Smith tried to nail him down on specific teams, it’s hard to imagine that he wouldn’t be interested in the Golden State Warriors if he’s interested in joining “a winning situation”.\n\nHere’s a transcription of exactly what was said (you can watch the full video below):\n\nMax Kellerman: “What would your dream scenario be?”\n\nChris Bosh: “A winning situation.”\n\nStephen A. Smith: “Any of the top six teams in the NBA, basically?”\n\nBosh: “Yeah! I mean, top three.”\n\n** Laughter **\n\nSmith: “Well, what’s your top three?”\n\nBosh: “Man, I would say Houston, Golden State, uh- man, Toronto’s playing well right now; you’ve gotta put them in the top three.”\n\nSmith: “You would go to Toronto? You would go back to Toronto?”\n\nBosh: “I didn’t say that. You asked me who my top three was.”\n\nSmith: “Well, you said top three; I said top six, you said top three, which means you’d consider them one of your top three.”\n\nBosh: “We’re talking about the top three. I’m a free agent. I’m a free agent.”\n\nKellerman: “If you could go to either Cleveland or Toronto, what would you pick?”\n\nBosh: “Whoever makes me the best deal. One thing I’ve learned is if you have a good deal-”\n\nMolly Qerim: “Give him an offer he can’t refuse, right?”\n\nBosh: “Yeah, you have to make a good offer -- that’s what it’s about.”\n\nSo, yeah — maybe his top three statement was a joke, maybe with all the laughter and cross-talk he really did believe they’d changed the subject to a random discussion of his top three, and maybe Bosh is just part of First Half Twitter and doesn’t believe the Warriors are a top three team after last night’s loss to the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nWhat the Warriors can’t do is make him an offer he can’t refuse financially and the Houston Rockets would be quite a fit for him ...but hey, why join a first place team when you can join a struggling second place just trying to keep pace ? (Did I do that right, First Half Twitter?)\n\nBut Bosh would make a nice fit with the Warriors’ culture and the Warriors Silicon Valley could be a great fit for him.\n\nThe sticking point, of course, is Bosh’s health: he hasn’t played since February 2016 due to a blood clotting issue. A NBA doctor ruled that his condition was career-ending back in July 2017. But Bosh insisted during his appearance on First Take that his health is not an issue, as transcribed by Ira Winderman of the Sun Sentinel.\n\n“Medicine is like law. That’s what I’ve come to find out,” he said. “It’s very gray area. Some people say yes. Some people say no. Usually it’s about what the majority agrees to, and usually sometimes it’ll take somebody to kind of have some revolutionary plan or something like that.\n\n”I’m not going to be in a position where I’m risking my life. So if I ever get back on the court like that and people are worried, it’s not going to be a life-risking situation.”\n\nBosh has previously contended his condition could be managed with blood thinners, with a schedule that takes into account the contact of the NBA game and the league’s scheduling.\n\nAs Bosh alluded to during his appearance on First Take, March 1 is the NBA’s deadline for un-signed players to sign and be eligible to compete in the playoffs, according to NBA.com."
