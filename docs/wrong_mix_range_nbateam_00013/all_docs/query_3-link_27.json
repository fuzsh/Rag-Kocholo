        "text": "June 26, 2003\n\nBy The Associated Press\n\nBosh Photo Gallery from 2002-03 Season\n\nNEW YORK (AP) – With the fourth pick in the first round of the 2003 NBA draft, the Toronto Raptors select Chris Bosh.\n\nChris Bosh\n\nPosition: Power forward.\n\nHeight: 6-foot-11.\n\nWeight: 210 pounds.\n\nCollege: Georgia Tech.\n\nDOB: March 24, 1984.\n\nScouting report: Declared for the draft after just one year with the Yellow Jackets. Quick, athletic big man who runs the floor well and can beat most players his size off the dribble. Most dangerous facing the basket from the post. Has nice shooting touch for his size. Works hard for position and has good footwork down low, but will have to bulk up to bang with NBA power forwards. Only 19 years old, so still physically developing. Quickness off the floor makes up for lack of strength when rebounding. Averaged 15.7 points, 9.0 rebounds and made 46.8 percent (22-for-47) of his 3-point attempts in college. Didn’t shoot from behind the arc often, but was very accurate when he did. Named to the ACC’s second team and was a member of its All-Defensive team. Shot 56 percent to lead the conference in field goal percentage, only the second freshman ever to do that; North Carolina’s Antawn Jamison was the first in 1996. Consistent free-throw shooter at 73 percent. Named High School Player of the Year by Basketball America in 2002.\n\nNBA Draft History Involving Georgia Tech Players…\n\nA few facts regarding the history of Georgia Tech players in the draft:\n\nHighest draft pick previously: Kenny Anderson (No. 2 overall to New Jersey in 1991)\n\nNext highest picks: Stephon Marbury (No. 4 overall to Milwaukee in 1996, traded to Minnesota); Dennis Scott (No. 4 overall to Orlando in 1990)\n\nLottery picks: Bosh is the sixth lottery pick (one of the top 13 players chosen) from Georgia Tech since the lottery was implemented in 1985. The others were: John Salley (11th overall to Detroit, 1985), Tom Hammonds (9th overall to Washington in 1989), Scott, Anderson and Marbury.\n\nFirst-round picks: Bosh is the 13th Tech player taken in the first round overall, the 11th since 1989 and the fourth in the last five years.\n\nActive NBA players: Seven former Tech players were on active NBA rosters in 2002-03. Bosh would make it eight in 2003-04 if all of the other seven remain active.\n\nEarly NBA entries: Bosh is the fifth Tech player to make an early entry into the NBA draft. All except Dennis Scott (1990 draft, retired after 2000-01 season) remain active in the league. The other early entries were Dennis Scott (1990), Kenny Anderson (1991), Stephon Marbury (1996) and Dion Glover (1998).\n\nFor more information:\n\nBosh’s official Georgia Tech bio"
