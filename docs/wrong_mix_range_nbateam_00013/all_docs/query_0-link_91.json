        "text": "Bosh was admitted to the hospital on Thursday (Feb. 19) after complaining about discomfort in his chest for several days. A spokesperson for the Heat said Bosh has received treatment for the clots and is resting comfortably. Coach Erik Spoelstra said Friday that he was confident that the condition is not life-threatening, though the medication required to treat such a condition typically requires at least six months of limited physical activity.\n\nAfter playing in the All-Star game last weekend, Bosh spent the early part of this week on vacation with family and friends, including teammate Dwyane Wade, in Haiti. Wade said Bosh wasn't \"feeling his best\" on the vacation. When Bosh hadn't improved by Wednesday, he was sent to a team doctor, and from there went to the hospital for tests.\n\n\"There just came a point in the vacation where he didn't feel right,\" Wade said. \"He kind of relaxed and rested, and then when he got back, he did what he should have done ... [he] got to the doctor and tried to see what's up.\"\n\nThe timing of Bosh's diagnosis is particularly scary. Former Portland Trail Blazers star Jerome Kersey died suddenly Wednesday of a blood clot in his lung at age 52.\n\nThe news comes on the heels of excitement in Miami for the Heat landing point guard Goran Dragic in a trade Thursday.\n\nBET Sports News - Get the latest news and information about African-Americans in sports including weekly recaps, celebrity news and photos of your favorite Black athletes.
