        "text": "In the midst of a growing push toward formulaic basketball and a tsk tsk tsk attitude for any team taking long two-point shots lives the team that is wrecking all of this.\n\nThe Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nThey are a team bucking a lot of trends — analytical and conventional — and winning big.\n\nPortland’s most egregious transgression? Entering play Saturday, no NBA team has taken more midrange jump shots. Without conscience, Portland has hoisted 816 of them, a full 32 percent of its total shots. And, against doomsday figures laid out by the numbers-based analytics set, the Trail Blazers are not dying a slow, painful death because of it. In fact they are thriving.\n\nAt the center of all of that is the type of player analytics basketball is trying to terminate — LaMarcus Aldridge.\n\nThe star power forward is a midrange jump-shooting machine and not much else, and some of them are the the dreaded long-range 2, and yet he’s burying a good percentage of them. Overall, he’s shooting .477 on two-point attempts. He has a hair-raising 110 more midrange attempts than the next player (Dallas’ Dirk Nowitzki). And there’s no sign he’s slowing down. Aldridge is riding this midrange train all the way to the All-Star Game.\n\nPortland, however, balances all of its midrange madness in a way that dovetails completely with analytic basketball — by shooting the 3-point shot, and lots of them.\n\nAbout 28 percent of the Blazers’ shots come from behind the arc, well above the NBA’s average. Only Golden State shoots a greater percentage of 3s, according to NBA.com. Only eight teams — one of them the Nuggets, strangely enough — shoot the corner 3-ball better. And that, as any progressive basketball thinker will tell you, is the Mecca of all shot positions on the court.\n\nSo the Trail Blazers have been this weird blend of both, which makes it fair to ask: Can they continue to win this way?\n\nThe biggest percentage of their shots comes from midrange, but, hey, they have to shoot them from somewhere because they all but ignore scoring in the paint. The Blazers get outscored by around 13 points per game in the paint on a nightly basis — and that’s no bueno no matter what your style of play is.\n\nThe kicker: Portland is not horrendous in postups. The Blazers can go to Aldridge when they have to have that easy bucket, and Synergy stats say they average 0.83 points per possession on postups. That’s workable. But they have been so efficient in every other type of offensive set that pounding it inside has largely become an afterthought. Portland is averaging more than a point per possession in eight of 10 specific offensive categories. That’s unreal.\n\nAnd, it may be unrealistic to think Portland, which also gets hammered on the offensive glass and struggles to turn teams over, can keep this up.\n\nBut it sure is fun to watch.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost"
