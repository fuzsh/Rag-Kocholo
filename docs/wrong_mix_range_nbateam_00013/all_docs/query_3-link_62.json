        "text": "MIAMI -- The Heat released Chris Bosh on Tuesday and announced his jersey number would be retired, clearing the remaining $52.1 million of his contract off its salary cap and ending a seven-year relationship that including the exhilaration of two championships and the numbing news of multiple blood clots that ultimately ended his Heat career.\n\nMiami needed to make the move Tuesday to push its available cap space from $9 million to a bit over $34 million in time for the end of the NBA's signing moratorium on Thursday.\n\nPlayers with guaranteed contracts (such as Bosh) must be given 48 hours to clear waivers in order for that player's salary to be removed from a team cap. So the Heat needed to make the move Tuesday to maximize its cap room, with players eligible to sign contracts beginning at noon on Thursday.\n\n\"Chris changed his life and basketball career when he came to Miami,\" Heat president Pat Riley said in a statement. \"And he changed our lives for the better, in a way we never would have imagined, when he joined the Miami Heat. We will forever be indebted to CB for how he changed this team and led us to four trips to the NBA Finals and two NBA Championships. He is, without a doubt, one of the greatest players in the history of the franchise.\n\n\"The number '1' will never be worn by another player and we can't wait to someday hang his jersey in the rafters. Today, we are both moving on but we wish Chris, Adrienne and their family nothing but the best. They will forever be part of the Miami Heat family.\"\n\nBecause of a change in the new labor agreement, Bosh would not go back on the Heat's cap or luxury tax calculations even if he plays for another team during the next two seasons. Under the old agreement, Bosh's cap hits would have returned to the Heat's cap if he played 25 games with another team.\n\nIn order for Bosh to be cleared from the Heat's cap, a doctor jointly chosen by the Heat and NBA needed to rule that Bosh's injury was career-ending or at the very least, would put him at risk if he plays again. That ruling happened in the past two months.\n\nBut an associate said Bosh has by no means ruled out playing again.\n\nBosh will receive the remaining money on his Heat contract -- $25.3 million next season and $26.8 million in 2018-19, with insurance paying a substantial chunk of that.\n\nBosh, 33, averaged 18 points and 7.3 rebounds and shot 49.6 percent from the field in 384 games over six seasons with Miami.\n\nHe also averaged 14.9 points and 7.3 rebounds in 78 playoff games for Miami, helping lead the Heat to four Finals and two championships in the Big Three era. He was named to the All-Star team in all six of his seasons playing for Miami.\n\nAmong Bosh's most memorable moments: He grabbed an offensive rebound with 6.3 seconds remaining in regulation of Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals and passed to Ray Allen for his game-tying 3-pointer, forcing overtime. The Heat won the series in 7.\n\nBut he was diagnosed with blood clots in February of both 2015 and 2016, ending both of those seasons prematurely.\n\nThe Heat were prepared to allow Bosh to play this past season, but a preseason medical exam revealed more clotting, and the Heat at that point decided that it would no longer be open to a Bosh comeback.\n\nBosh's final game for the Heat was on Feb. 9, 2016; he scored 18 points in an 18-point loss to Sacramento.\n\nHe was voted to play in the All-Star Game that month and selected to compete in the Three-Point Contest; he withdrew from both because of a calf injury. Soon after, he was diagnosed with a blood clot in his leg and never played for the team again.\n\nBosh, who relocated to Los Angeles last month, told Larry King in an April interview that he believes he will play in the NBA again.\n\n\"Yeah, I think so. At heart. I'm still an athlete. That is not how I want it to end.\"\n\nThough Bosh was initially angry with the Heat for not allowing him to play, the Bosh/Heat relationship ended on good terms, according to an associate, with contact between Bosh and owner Micky Arison.\n\n\"Yeah, I understand what they have to do as a team,\" Bosh said. \"It is a business. I know we -- as athletes and owners and people involved with the NBA -- never want to say it's a business, and things like that. It is a business. And hurt does come in with that. But as president of the Miami Heat, I understand what he has to do.\"\n\nBosh, during the interview with King, declined to disclose specifics about his health.\n\n\"It's complicated,\" he said. \"It's very, very complicated, and that's why I haven't been able to play this year.\"\n\nAsked if he misses playing, he said: \"I do, but a part of me doesn't. Yeah. I've come to enjoy different aspects of life. There's a lot of life out there.\n\n\"I mean only because as basketball players, we do that, and that's really it. I've enjoyed spending time with my kids, enjoyed spending time with my wife, and just kind of relaxing and working on my mind and my soul. ...\n\n\"It's been a very interesting time for me, only because I'm used to playing basketball. I'm used to practicing. I'm used to the schedule. That's kind of what I was born to do. That's what I've been doing my whole life. And over the last year, I have not been able to kind of fall back on that. So it's forced me to grow in a lot of different ways.\""
