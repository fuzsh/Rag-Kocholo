        "text": "UPDATED, Sept. 24, 2019, 11:30 a.m.: After retiring from professional basketball, Miami Heat legend Dwyane Wade put his waterfront Miami Beach home on the market for $33 million last week.\n\nThe six-bedroom, 13,800-square-foot mansion at 5980 North Bay Road includes a wine room – likely with some bottles from his winery, D Wade Cellars — a game room, outdoor basketball court and a home theater.\n\nWade isn’t the only basketball player with an impressive pad in South Florida. Wade’s current and former teammates have also made a splash in real estate, buying luxury homes in Pinecrest, Coconut Grove and Miami Beach.\n\nBelow is a list of where current and former Miami Heat players bought or sold homes in South Florida.\n\nLeBron James\n\nAfter LeBron James depleted Miami Heat fans’ hopes of winning a championship and took his talents to Cleveland, he sold his mansion at 3590 Crystal View Court in Coconut Grove for $13.4 million in 2015.\n\nThe home has a 4,500-square-foot guest section with a lounge and game room, an infinity-edge pool, an outdoor kitchen and a concrete dock with space for two 60-foot yachts. The house also has a private theater, office and a wine cellar fit for a sommelier.\n\nWhen he put the 12,178-square-foot home on the market in October 2014, James originally wanted $17 million, which was $8 million more than what he paid in 2010.\n\nChris Bosh\n\nFormer Miami Heat power forward Chris Bosh and Big 3 member still owns a home just down the street from Wade’s Miami Beach pad.\n\nThe ex-Heat star and his wife, Adrienne Williams Bosh, own a 12,400-square-foot estate at 6396 North Bay Road that they put on the market at the end of 2017 for $18 million.\n\nBosh paid $12.3 million for the seven-bedroom North Bay Road estate in 2010, a year after it was completed. The property includes an infinity-edge pool, boat dock, outdoor kitchen, gym and guesthouse.\n\nJames Johnson\n\nThe player who bears the nickname “Bloodsport” for his black belt in karate, bought an estate in Pinecrest for $5.2 million last year.\n\nJames Johnson bought the seven-bedroom, 7,700-square-foot home at 8955 Southwest 63rd Court in May 2018. The property initially hit the market in 2016 for $5.35 million, and again in November 2016 for nearly $5.3 million, according to Realtor.com. Johnson was previously renting the house.\n\nThe house features a home theater, pool and spa, and an outdoor kitchen.\n\nErik Spoelstra\n\nMiami Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra flipped his Coconut Grove house, selling it at a slight loss in 2017.\n\nIn May 2016, Spoelstra paid $2.6 million for the five-bedroom home at 3720 Poinciana Avenue. He listed it in January 2017 for $2.7 million, hoping to make a profit, but sold it for $2.5 million in February 2017.\n\nBuilt in 1937, the Coconut Grove home sits on a 32,706-square-foot lot with tropical landscaping and a canopy of oak trees. It was recently renovated and features high-end appliances, vaulted wood ceilings, a gourmet kitchen, pool, and a cottage suite with its own kitchen.\n\nAnfernee “Penny” Hardaway\n\n“Lil’ Penny,” who played briefly with the Miami Heat before retiring in 2007, sold his Pinecrest mansion for $2.6 million.\n\nSign Up for the undefined Newsletter\n\nAnfernee “Penny” Hardaway initially listed the 8,639-square-foot home at 5940 Southwest 108th Street for $3.8 million in 2017. The home has six bedrooms, seven-and-a-half bathrooms and features a basketball court, home theater, gym, swimming pool and six-car garage.\n\nHardaway is now the head basketball coach at the University of Memphis.\n\nHassan Whiteside\n\nRight after signing a four-year, $98 million contract, Heat center Hassan Whiteside bought a new Miami Beach home for $7.3 million in 2016 . Whiteside’s house at 528 Lakeview Court spans 5,406 square feet on 17,676-square-foot property.\n\nBuilt in 2014, the home features an open floor plan with a gourmet kitchen, pool, bar, summer kitchen, cabana, a guest house with a private entrance, staff quarters, and a large dock.\n\nThis summer, Whiteside was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers.\n\nDion Waiters\n\nDespite holding the nickname “Waiters Island,” Dion Waiters chose to buy a non-waterfront mansion in Pinecrest in 2017.\n\nWaiters paid $7.4 million for the mansion at 5745 Southwest 94th Street, property records show. It marked the priciest sale in Pinecrest in 2017.\n\nThe custom-built 17,700-square-foot house has nine bedrooms and 10-and-a-half bathrooms. It features a Balinese architectural style and a 20-foot-high ceilings, three terraces and a six-car, two-sided garage.\n\nMike Miller\n\nMike Miller was always known for his outside shooting, which could explain why he bought a house away from Miami.\n\nMiller sold his Pompano Beach mansion at 2308 Bay Drive at auction for $3.4 million in 2012. The 9,717-square-foot, three-story home is located in the posh Hillsboro Shores neighborhood of Pompano Beach. Through its large floor-to-ceiling windows, the home overlooks a wide inlet that connects the ocean to Florida’s Intracoastal Waterway.\n\nRay Allen\n\nRight after Ray Allen’s Heat career ended, he laid down roots in Miami and bought a 10-bedroom Coral Gables home for $11 million. Billionaire medical entrepreneur Miguel Fernandez sold the mansion at 5 Tahiti Beach Island Road to a trust tied to Allen in 2014.\n\nThe more than 37,000-square-foot property includes a private beach. Other features include a library, elevator, gym, sauna and spa bath. Property records show the trust tied to Allen still owns the property. Allen retired from the NBA in November 2016 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\nPat Riley\n\nMiami Heat President Pat Riley and his wife, Christine, paid $8.1 million for unit 507 in the south tower of the luxury condo-hotel Four Seasons Residences at the Surf Club in Surfside earlier this year, records show.\n\nThe unit has four bedrooms and five-and-a-half bathrooms.\n\nFort Partners completed the project in 2017. It includes 150 condo units, a 72-room hotel, a Le Sirenuse restaurant and a Thomas Keller restaurant.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the year and the sales price of Mike Miller’s home. He sold the house in 2012 at auction for $3.4M."
