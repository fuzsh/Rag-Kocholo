        "text": "Overshadowed by the NFL Wild Card Weekend, the anticlimactic BCS Championship Game and nonstop Tebowmania, the NBA has been somewhat under the radar this last week. Honestly, this might have been for the best, as there has been plenty of inconsistent (and in some cases, just plain lousy) basketball during this time period. The experts who said that the shortened offseason would lead to greater number of preseason-level efforts may have been on to something. But, following the hectic Holiday Season opening, we are now beginning to see patterns emerge.\n\nThe Portland Trail Blazers are this season's trendy pick\n\nThe Portland Trail Blazers began the season losing two former \"futures of the franchise\", Brandon Roy (forced by injuries into premature retirement) and Greg \"Mr. Glass\" Oden (who just broke), before the season even started. Led instead by franchise present LaMarcus Aldridge, the Blazers have emerged as a genuine threat in the West, particularly at home where they seem practically unbeatable.\n\nOver the past few decades, the Blazers have been more defined by disastrous draft choices (Sam Bowie over Michael Jordan, Greg Oden over Kevin Durant) and disreputable rosters (the so-called Jail Blazers era) than what they've accomplished on the court. But this could change if they continue to keep pace with the likes of the Thunder and the Lakers (although victory over the Thunder spurred Oklahoma City to back-to-back-to-back wins). With the city of Portland entering the public consciousness with the hipster-parodying sketch comedy show \"Portlandia\", I could see Blazers gear replacing trucker hats and retro t-shirts as iconic symbols of this omnipresent subculture: \"I'm wearing a Nicolas Batum jersey, he's a pretty good player but you probably never heard of him.\"\n\nIt's already Open Season on head coaches\n\nLast week Sacramento Kings Coach Paul Westphal made it clear that DeMarcus Cousins would no longer be playing under him. Westphal said that Cousins had demanded to be traded, and that he would no longer play, or even travel, with his team. In his quest to never have to coach Cousins again, Westphal lost this battle - Cousins ended up sitting out only one game - but won the war: the Kings fired him a less than a week after the supposed trade request. The lesson here is that a coach with a 51-120 record is more replaceable than a talented young player, no matter how difficult. Who knew?\n\nMeanwhile, in Washington D.C., Flip Saunders is all but waiting for his last meal request to be approved. The Wizards finally won their first game on Tuesday, but that may just delay the inevitable. Shades of the DeCousins affair, there are reports of a feud between Rashard Lewis and his coach, who, in turn, is bizarrely blaming John Wall's sophomore slump on Wall playing too much basketball during the lockout. Even if you're a fan with no outside knowledge, it's difficult to watch the Wizards sloppy play without coming to the conclusion that either the coach has quit on the team, the team has quit on the coach or that just about everyone has quit on everybody else. It's enough to make an entire fanbase quit. The season has barely begun, but already the only balls that are likely to matter much for the draft lottery bound Wizards are ping-pong balls.\n\nNot all Triple Overtime Games are thrilling\n\nIf any game demonstrates the sometimes lackluster play plaguing the early weeks of this cobbled together semi-season, it's last Thursday's Miami Heat/Atlanta Hawks game, quite possibly the least loved triple overtime game in NBA history. Far more enjoyable than the game itself was reading the Tweets of fans and media members alike as the game stubbornly refused to end. A few months ago the same people were lamenting the possibility of there being no basketball at all, and now they were upset that there was entirely too much of it. With Dwyane Wade and LeBron James out, the nationally televised game played out as if neither team wanted to win, less of a game than a thudding, maddening endurance test.\n\nIf there was one bright spot in this uninspired display of entropy, it was Chris Bosh reminding his many, many critics that he was once more than the Heatles' Ringo. Bosh's game, punctuated by his game tying three at the end of regulation, was a reminder of his days being the main attraction with the Toronto Raptors. Unfairly mocked for the sin of not being as good at basketball as two of the best players in the league, Chris Bosh used this rare solo showcase to prove he was more than a punchline. At least someone enjoyed the game.\n\nWe've only made Kobe angry\n\nWhy do we continually disrespect and count out Kobe Bryant when we know it only spurs him on? Kobe will be older. Kobe wouldn't get along with new Lakers Coach Mike Brown. Kobe will be distracted by his divorce. Kobe's wrist was going to be a lingering problem. Kobe was upset that the Chris Paul trade fell apart, and this was going to affect his performance in some tangible way. These were the Official Kobe Storylines when the season began.\n\nThen, on Tuesday night, Kobe Bryant just went and demolished the Phoenix Suns to the tune of 48 points.\n\n.\n\nKobe Bryant isn't getting younger, that's not really how time works, but for Kobe that just means he's not likely to score 81 points in a single game again. Nobody, with the possible exception of Kobe himself, expects him to dominate every game like this, which is a good thing for the Lakers. It's difficult to win a championship if your club operates less like a team and more like a supervillain flanked by henchmen. If the Lakers as currently constructed are going to make a deep playoff run, it's going to depend on Kobe's chemistry with Pau Gasol, Andrew Bynum and company.\n\nFans should still appreciate these Kobe Bryant games because there will be fewer and fewer of them as time takes its toll on Bryant, no amount of mysterious, overseas medical treatments will keep a player going forever.\n\nWhen Peak Kobe, in all of his selfish ego-driven glory, is determined to single-handedly dispose of his opponent, turning his teammates into a loose collection of personal attendants and spectators, it is awe-inspiring. Watching Kobe nearly score 50 against the Suns is like watching Godzilla on a rampage, demolishing everything in his paths. It's impossible not to take some delight in the carnage, even if you're quite glad he's not doing it to your city.\n\nOther things we've learned\n\nPicked off the scrap heap mere weeks ago, Golden State Warriors guard Nate Robinson led his team to an improbable fourth quarter comeback win over the Heat. Watch for the Warriors to use this performance as an excuse to give the reliably unreliable Robinson enough playing time to sabotage their season, because that's just what the Warriors do.\n\nIn a blatant attempt to bring down Andrew Bynum's trade value, Warrior Kwame Brown stated in an interview that he taught the Lakers center everything he knows.\n\nThanks to Ricky Rubio and Kevin Love, the Minnesota Timberwolves may be the most entertaining team in NBA history that sometimes seems destined to never win a game again.\n\nUnder the assumption that he would not be invited to the White House along with his Dallas Mavericks teammates due to a very public weapons charge, Delonte West went off on an angry late night full-blown Twitter breakdown. Because psychotic rants are the best way to prove to the Secret Service you're not a threat.\n\nThe New York Knicks #21 Iman Shumpert is winning fans and making a push to remain in the starting lineup, which would do wonders in my attempt to establish the nickname \"21 Shump Street\". You're welcome, t-shirt hawkers outside Madison Square Garden, just make sure you send me a percentage of the profits.\n\nCongratulations to New Jersey Nets part-owner Jay-Z and his wife Beyonce on the birth of his child Blue Ivy Carter. No truth to the rumor that if it was a boy, Jay-Z would have attempted to sway a certain superstar's upcoming decision by naming him Dwight Howard Carter.\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers are making a push to become the next Philadelphia sports team to raise its city's hopes for the sole purpose of later dashing them."
