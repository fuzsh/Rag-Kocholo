Regardless he's in a dream position and a nightmare situation at the same time. I'd have to imagine it would be quite difficult to manage those egos and it may be a bit more than Speolstra can handle.\n\nRe: A lucky man...or Erik Van Spoelstra?\n\nby DaTruRochin Thu Jul 08, 2010 10:39 am\n\nA YEAR? Unlikely... The one year the Heat one the title Stan Van Gundy barely got half a season before the aging oil slick took over.

Can I root for Spoelstra and against LeBron?\n\nI'm conflicted\n\nRe: A lucky man...or Erik Van Spoelstra?\n\nby onetouchfutbol Sat Jul 10, 2010 2:43 pm\n\nErik's involvement is the only reason I'm remotely interested in what happens to the Heat. I love that ESPN is finally giving the World Cup it's fair respect so that the networks will have a bidding war for the next Cup due to ratings. On the other hand, I can't stand the arrogance in creating \"The Decision\" for James and then the stupid interviews involving their own employees afterwords. The whole \"We covered the story first\" idea just feels insane to me. This whole thing was like a paid advertisement of Lebron and his new contract...except that the Boys and Girls Club received the proceeds.

Also, has anyone considered the fact that maybe it isn't Spoelstra's lack on control but rather a lack of respect and control from the Big 3? I would never yell at my coach the way that Wade did in that video.\n\nAlso also, it seems like the Miami Heat are like some of America's big banks and corporations: too big to fail? too good to fail? I guess not.\n\nRemembering the Making of Erik Spoelstra ....\n\nby DoubleDipper Tue May 29, 2012 11:37 pm\n\nA nice insider perspective on Erik Spoelstra as he heads into the Eastern Conference finals by onetime Boston College and Miami Heat player (1997) Malcolm Huckaby from the Green Street Blog.\n\nHere are some fun facts that many may not know about the history of Spoelstra: I did not know that Spoelstra was on the court when Hank Gathers collapsed and died during the 1990 WCC tournament. I did not know his father was an NBA executive for the Portland Trail Blazers, Denver Nuggets, Buffalo Braves and New Jersey Nets. I did not know that Erik was the grandson of the late Watson Spoelstra, a sportswriter in the Detroit area. I did not know that ‘Spo’ or ‘E’ as I used to call him back in the day when he was shagging balls for me or working me out to develop my mid range game, had won freshman of the year in the West Coast Conference his freshman year as a point guard for the University of Portland. I did not know that he is a member of the University of Portland’s 1,000 point club.\n\nhttp://greenstreet.weei.com/sports/boston/basketball/celtics/2012/05/28/remembering-the-makings-of-erik-spoelstra/\n\n......and even more on Erik\n\nby DoubleDipper Wed May 30, 2012 1:29 pm\n\nAnother look at Erik, this time from ESPN:\n\nhttp://espn.go.com/blog/truehoop/post/_/id/43890/the-book-on-erik-spoelstra\n\nWhat were his characteristics as a player?\n\nSpoelstra was a heady point guard who started all four seasons at the University of Portland and was the WCC's freshman of the year in 1989. A proficient 3-point shooter. Willing passer.\n\nWhich coaches did he play for?\n\nAt Portland, Spoelstra played for Larry Steele, a Trail Blazer lifer (and member of the 1977 championship team) who had a less-than-successful career as a college coach.\n\nHa, ha, good one. I love these master's of the understatement!\n\n.............and still more\n\nby DoubleDipper Sun Jun 03, 2012 12:34 pm\n\nOn the hot seat, Erik Spoelstra has stayed cool for Miami Heat\n\nApparently the Celtics are still playing; from the Boston Globe:\n\nIt was during a flight to London for a scouting trip in 1995 that Chris Wallace first urged then-Heat general manager Dave Wohl to take a chance on a kid he had known since high school. Erik Spoelstra had played basketball at the University of Portland and in a professional league in Germany, and was now out of work\n\nThe rest of the story is at:\n\nhttp://www.boston.com/sports/basketball/celtics/articles/2012/06/03/on_the_hot_seat_erik_spoelstra_has_stayed_cool_for_miami_heat/\n\nMo 'bout Spo'\n\nby DoubleDipper Tue Jun 19, 2012 3:46 pm\n\nFrom BackPageLead today:\n\nThe Miami Heat hasn't exactly been short of narratives in the past two seasons. Initially, they were poised to be one of the greatest teams ever, then once that didn't eventuate their collective carcass was dissected in a manner usually seen during CSI: Miami.\n\nInevitably, the discussion reached head coach Erik Spoelstra, and whether he was the right man to be at the helm of the newly forged superstar trio. The fact that Hall of Fame and championship winning coach Pat Riley has been omnipresent during his time at the helm certainly couldn't have been a calming influence for \"Spo\", and it armed writers with an additional source of ammunition. Surely, it was only a matter of time before Riley would step down from atop his throne in the Heat front office, and take his place at the top of the bench. Spoelstra, if the vernacular was to be believed, was a man living on borrowed time.\n\nYet, almost two seasons have passed since the Miami landscape was forever altered, and the one-time University of Portland point guard is still calling the shots. And doing a pretty good job, too.\n\nWhile many people dismiss Spoelstra's record, stating that the dynamic triumvirate of players at his disposal makes his job easy, there's no disputing with his record. On Sunday night, competing in their second-consecutive NBA Finals, Coach Spo's Heat took a 2-1 lead over the Thunder, and has the chance to close out the series on their homefloor in the next two contests.\n\nIf that happens, no one will talk about the Illinois native, with headlines instead being devoted to LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. But Spoelstra deserves a tremendous amount of credit for Miami's successes to this point, even though he probably won't get it.\n\nRe: A lucky man...or Erik Van Spoelstra?\n\nby Geezaldinho Tue Jun 19, 2012 3:52 pm\n\nI had no idea Jesuit high was in Illinois.\n\nRe: A lucky man...or Erik Van Spoelstra?\n\nby DaTruRochin Tue Jun 19, 2012 3:54 pm\n\nBeaverton is kind of far out there....

An old friend of mine who gained fame in the ’76 Olympics in Innsbruck was born in Chicago, but moved to Greenwich, Connecticut as a very young child and did most of her athletic training in New York. When interviewed by the press, or when asked by others where she considered home, she would invariably say she’s “a native of Illinois, but was raised in Connecticut.” Personal choice, I guess.\n\nI don't know Erik's choice.\n\nRe: A lucky man...or Erik Van Spoelstra?\n\nby DoubleDipper Thu Jun 21, 2012 10:41 am\n\n“Probably big on heart, a little bit less on skill, and that’s why he’s a good coach.”\n\nAnother article about Erik, this time from Manila. Nothing really new, but interesting nonetheless:\n\nhttp://www.abs-cbnnews.com/sports/06/21/12/fil-am-coach-spoelstra-verge-history\n\nLiving vicariously through his son, Erik\n\nby DoubleDipper Thu Jun 21, 2012 10:58 am\n\n\"Most fathers don't get to watch what their sons do for a living on TV,\" Jon said, \"and most fathers don't hear criticism of their sons doing their jobs.
