        "text": "The career Chris Bosh had worked most of his life for ended much sooner than expected. After 13 seasons, two championships, and 11 All-Star appearances, recurring blood clots that were viewed as potentially life-threatening cut short the final two seasons of his tenure with the Miami Heat. In the midst of a five-year contract with Miami, he was eventually waived, an unfortunate close to what will soon be a Hall-of-Fame career.\n\nFrom the outside, the split from the Heat appeared contentious. The team would be paying nearly $24 million a year to a player that had been, at best, rarely available for multiple seasons and no guarantee that he’d ever be fully healthy again. They also weren’t prepared to further risk the life of their superstar, even if Bosh himself was. He wanted to keep playing and understandably so. A lifetime of sacrifices to be one of the best players in the world and he had no say in when he would be able to walk away from the game. Accepting that reality was not easy. Rumors circulated that he’d play again for another team–any team–that would have him. None ever did.\n\nAnd so the choice was made for him. There were doubts and emotional struggles. His body had betrayed him and the end was a regretful one. But he had another choice, to remain bitter or simply move on. “I kept coming back to the same conclusion every time, which was ... I had to get over it,” Bosh said when I spoke to him by phone, “I can’t keep regretting a decision that could have catastrophic consequences, you know what I mean?” Moving on was the only real option.\n\nHe began the transition out of necessity but persevered, for his sake and his family’s. “Just looking at my children you get that sense that...you can’t blow it,” Bosh said, “I have to keep it together. I have to overcome this because I’m setting the tone for my children, setting the example for my family.” Years have passed now and Bosh can chuckle as he recounts the difficult transition. Acceptance, it would appear, has finally come.\n\nHe’s still connected to basketball and will be, for as long as it will have him. “I love the game, teaching the game. Learning from the game.” His relationship with the Heat, whether it was ever truly contentious, is as strong as ever. His jersey was retired by the team last March and now hangs in the rafters where it belongs.\n\nBosh even worked out with Miami’s promising young center, Bam Adebayo, earlier this summer. Adebayo’s addition to USA Basketball’s training camp roster cut those workouts short but Bosh had seen enough in what time they did share. “If we’re talking about raw, natural talent, he’s got all that,” says Bosh, adding, “The sky’s the limit for him.”\n\nIf there’s any limitations to Adebayo’s impact, Bosh believes those are mostly self-imposed. “For him it’s all about confidence and what he really sees himself doing...now, it’s just about focusing on the thinking portion of the game.” Adebayo was eventually cut from Team USA before the group traveled to China for the FIBA World Cup. And while Bosh was surprised by the decision, he sees the potential for something positive. “And whatever happened [with Team USA], he can take that with him and I hope it puts a chip on his shoulder for the season...because he’s gonna need it.”\n\nPerhaps less surprisingly, Bosh likes Miami’s addition of Jimmy Butler. “You want guys that are competitive, that love the game and want to win. That’s what it’s all about, so I think it’s a great pickup. He fits the culture there”\n\nBosh sees team chemistry as a potentially “interesting” concern, especially considering Butler’s past issues in that regard. But he also believes that Butler is “up for the challenge” by choosing to come to Miami. He also points to Udonis Haslem’s role on the team as an important one. “[Haslem] will be able to act as a buffer and help [Butler] communicate and be that other veteran presence for leadership purposes.”\n\nWhile it’s clear that Bosh is still strongly connected to basketball and the Heat, he admits that his perspective has changed as a result of “being away from the game a little bit,” particularly when recalling his own career. His impact is often dismissed by casual fans, particularly as his production lessened alongside Dwyane Wade and LeBron James in Miami.\n\nBut he’s comfortable with his time in the NBA and his legacy, even if understanding it comes late or not at all. “The story’s there. I was able to have big moments. The proof is in the work, even if it takes time for people to understand. ... If people wanna dive into it, they can. They can dissect it. I’m proud of it. It’ll live on forever.”\n\nIt’s that nuanced point of view that has helped Bosh make the transition as a retired player much easier. He has achieved far more than he ever dreamed possible. He is healthy again and has his family and their support at home. He is fulfilled to such a degree that he can succinctly sum up his journey through basketball, one that didn’t end with his playing days but rather evolved into something different, with only one word. “Perfect.”\n\n(CarMax has partnered with the NBA to launch their “Call Your Shot” campaign. Chris Bosh, an 11-time All-Star and 2-time NBA Champion, is part of the campaign’s launch.)"
