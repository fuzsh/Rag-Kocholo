        "text": "This article is about the basketball player. For the professional wrestler, see Chris Bosh (wrestler). For the South African rugby union player, see Christopher Bosch.\n\nChristopher Wesson Bosh (born March 24, 1984) is an American former professional basketball player. A Texas Mr. Basketball in high school, he played one season of college basketball for Georgia Tech before declaring for the 2003 NBA draft. Bosh was selected fourth overall by the Toronto Raptors. He is considered to be one of the greatest power forwards of all time, and one of the best players of his generation.[1][2]\n\nQuick Facts Personal information, Born ...\n\nClose\n\nWhile at Toronto, Bosh became a five-time NBA All-Star, was named to the All-NBA Second Team once, played for the U.S. national team (with whom he won a gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics), and supplanted former fan favorite Vince Carter as the face and leader of the Raptors franchise. In the 2006â€“07 season, Bosh led the Raptors to their first playoff appearance in five years and their first-ever division title. He left Toronto in 2010 as the franchise's all-time leader in points, rebounds, blocks, and minutes played.[3]\n\nIn 2010, after seven seasons with the Raptors, Bosh entered into a sign-and-trade deal whereby he was traded to the Miami Heat.[4] In Miami, he joined fellow stars Dwyane Wade and LeBron James; the trio became known as the Big Three. Bosh spent the second half of his career with Miami, appearing in the NBA Finals each year from 2011 to 2014 and winning NBA titles in 2012 and 2013. Bosh made the NBA All-Star team every year during his time in Miami. Bosh's career was cut short by a blood clotting condition that the NBA ruled to be a career-ending illness.[5][6] He played his final NBA game on February 9, 2016.[7] Notwithstanding the NBA's ruling, Bosh fought to resume his playing career for three years[8] before announcing in February 2019 that he intended to retire.[9] The same year, the Heat retired Bosh's No. 1 jersey.[10][11] In 2021, Bosh was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame.[12]"
