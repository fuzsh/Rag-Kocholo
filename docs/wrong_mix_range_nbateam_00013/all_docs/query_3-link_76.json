        "text": "Power forward Chris Bosh said all along that he wanted to stay with the Miami Heat, and the departure of LeBron James did not lead to a change of heart.\n\nBosh agreed Friday to a five-year contract worth about $118 million, two people familiar with the situation told the Associated Press. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because neither the team nor Bosh announced the deal.\n\nSo now, the “Big Three” — who officially broke up Friday when James announced he was returning to the Cavaliers — are the “Big Two.” The Heat are continuing to negotiate with Dwyane Wade, the other member of the star triumverate that led Miami to the NBA Finals in each of the last four seasons, winning two titles.\n\nBosh is an All-Star who averaged 16.2 points on 52 percent shooting last season, and now figures to potentially get many more shots in the Heat offensive scheme. For his career, Bosh has averaged 19.2 points in 11 NBA seasons.\n\nThere’s still plenty of work for Heat President Pat Riley to do. But first, he and the team lauded what James meant to them over the last four seasons.\n\n“While I am disappointed by LeBron’s decision to leave Miami, no one can fault another person for wanting to return home,” Riley said Friday night in a prepared statement. “The last four years have been an incredible run for South Florida, Heat fans, our organization and for all of the players who were a part of it. LeBron is a fantastic leader, athlete, teammate and person, and we are all sorry to see him go.”\n\nLAMAR ODOM WAIVED — The New York Knicks waived forward Lamar Odom and re-signed center Cole Aldrich. Knicks President Phil Jackson signed Odom, who played for him in Los Angeles, at the end of last season. But the former Sixth Man of the Year and husband of Khloe Kardashian never played a game for New York. “Unfortunately, Lamar was unable to uphold the standards to return as an NBA player,” Jackson said Frida. “We found it necessary to free up the roster spot.” But the Knicks are keeping Aldrich, who averaged 2.0 points and 2.8 rebounds in 46 games last season.\n\nSIGN AND TRADE — The Phoenix Suns agreed to a sign-and-trade deal with the Sacramento Kings for point guard Isaiah Thomas, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. The sources requested anonymity because the deal hasn’t been formally announced. Thomas is signing a four-year, $27 million contract. In exchange, the Kings get the draft rights to center Alex Oriakhi, a second-round draft pick in 2013, plus a $7 million trade exception. In three seasons with the Kings, Thomas played in 216 games, averaging 15.3 points and 4.8 assists.\n\nJAZZ SIGN PICKS — The Utah Jazz formally signed draft picks Dante Exum and Rodney Hood. Exum, a 6-foot-6 guard from Australia, was the fifth overall pick in June’s NBA Draft. He averaged 18.2 points, 3.6 rebounds and 3.8 assists with the Australian team at last year’s FIBA U19 World Championships. Hood was the 23rd overall pick in the draft out of Duke. The 6-foot-8 forward averaged 16.1 points, 3.9 rebounds and 2.1 assists with the Blue Devils last season. The terms of the deals were not released. Both players are eligible to play for the Jazz in the NBA Summer League in Las Vegas.\n\nHAWKS REQUEST WAIVERS — The Atlanta Hawks requested waivers on forward John Salmons. The move announced Friday was expected after the Hawks acquired Salmons from the Toronto Raptors last week. Salmons, 34, averaged 5.2 points in 78 games for the Raptors last season. Atlanta dealt away guard Lou Williams and the rights to Brazilian center Lucas Nogueira in a move to clear space under the salary cap. By paying the $1 million buyout of Salmons’ $7 million salary, the Hawks will have about $11.5 million for additional signings.\n\nCONTRACT FINALIZED — The Golden State Warriors signed guard Shaun Livingston to the contract agreed to last week. The deal is worth three years and about $16 million using Golden State’s full mid-level exception, which starts around $5.3 million next season. Livingston, 28, averaged 8.3 points, 3.2 rebounds and 3.2 assists with the Brooklyn Nets last season."
