        "text": "FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. — Former Razorback Joe Johnson has been named to the 12-man roster for the USA World Championship Team, announced by USA Basketball Senior National Team Managing Director Jerry Colangelo and USA head coach Mike Krzyzewski. The USA opens FIBA World Championship preliminary group play on Aug. 19 against Puerto Rico in Sapporo, Japan. Preliminary play continues through Aug. 24, with the U.S. playing a total offive games over the six days. \"This is very big,\" said Johnson. \"I am very proud of myself and the other 11 guys that made it. I think we all put a lot of hard work into it and now the real deal is about to start. We’ve got to be prepared to represent our country and hopefully bring home the gold.\" Joining Johnson, who plays for the Atlanta Hawks, on the team are Carmelo Anthony (Denver Nuggets), Shane Battier (Houston Rockets), Chris Bosh (Toronto Raptors), Elton Brand (Los Angeles Clippers), Kirk Hinrich (Chicago Bulls), Dwight Howard (Orlando Magic), LeBron James (Cleveland Cavaliers), Antawn Jamison (Washington Wizards), Brad Miller (Sacramento Kings), Chris Paul (New Orleans/ Oklahoma City Hornets) and Dwyane Wade (Miami Heat). \"This has been a great process, it’s difficult especially when you get down to the end because you get so attached to the last members of the team,\" said Krzyzewski. \"Gilbert (Arenas) and Bruce (Bowen) are every bit a part of this team as the 12 others guys, it’s just we can only go forward with 12. You have to make tough decisions and our group made that decision and we thank both of them. Gilbert unfortunately had an injury and Bruce was right there, he could just of easily be on the team because he did a good job. We appreciate that and now its time to concentrate on the 12 people we do have to go forward and try and win a gold medal. \"I think we’re very together,\" he says. \"I think we’re working hard. We’re very unselfish. No one really cares who gets the credit. I think they all have one goal and that is to win. They’ve been easy to coach. I haven’t had to worry about minutes, who’s starting, that type of thing, although I do think we need to get into a little bit better rotation than we had when we were doing a platoon system, but we knew we would do that when we got down to 12. \"We now have one phase behind us regarding getting to the final 12 players and it was difficult because we really had a great group of guys,\" said Colangelo. \"Making the selections was challenging because you could build a case for any one of the players to stay or not to stay. So we made the tough decision. We think the decision that was made protects us where we thought we needed some protection, up front. We have versatility in terms of swing people and defenders, which led us to make the final determination regarding Bruce (Bowen). It was very difficult. Bruce is a quality guy, a terrific defender, but it was a numbers game. \"We feel very good about where we are,\" he says. \"We’ve had a very successful exhibition run. We had one little scare that was a wake up call and a good one. Other than that I think we have made progress in all of our games. We know a lot more about who we are and what we need to do. We’re very focused, it’s a hard-working group and there’s a lot of good chemistry here and that’s something we sought.\" The averaged age of the 12 US players selected for the World Championship is 24.5 years old, with 30-year-old Miller listing as the oldest member of the team and 20-year-old Howard the youngest. The players also boast of an average of 4.25 NBA regular seasons of experience. Krzyzewski is serving as head coach of the USA Senior Team and is being assisted by Syracuse University (N.Y.) and Hall of Fame mentor Jim Boeheim, Phoenix Suns head mentor Mike D’Antoni and Portland Trail Blazers head coach Nate McMillan. The USA team is scheduled to train Aug. 17 and 18 in Sapporo, Japan, where it will play its preliminary group games of the 2006 FIBA World Championship for Men from Aug. 19-24. Joining the US in preliminary Group D are China (Asia Zone champion and ranked #14), Italy (wild card qualifier and ranked #6), Puerto Rico (wild card qualifier and ranked #11), Senegal (Africa Zone runner-up and ranked #30) and Slovenia (European zone sixth place finisher and ranked #22).
