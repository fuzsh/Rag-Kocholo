        "text": "Following this weekend’s delayed festivities for the 2020 Basketball Hall of Fame process, the members of the 2021 entered the spotlight on Sunday. Former Portland Trail Blazers head coach Rick Adelman was included in a group of three coaches set to enter the Hall of Fame later this year.\n\nESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski delivered the list of inductees earlier today.\n\nFollowing a stint as Chemeketa Community College’s coach, Adelman joined the Blazers’ staff as an assistant prior to the 1983-84 season. Adelman took the reins as Portland’s head coach in the 1988-89 season. Under Adelman’s guidance, the Blazers went on to secure two Western Conference titles.\n\nAdelman departed Portland following the 1993-94 season. Following his time with the Blazers, he would go on to make coaching stops with the Warriors, Kings, Rockets and Timberwolves. He will enter the Hall of Fame with a coaching record of 1042-749 (291 wins with the Blazers, second-most behind his stint with the Kings).\n\nAs a player, Adelman appeared in 237 games over three seasons in Portland. He was a part of the Blazers’ first squad in the 1970-71 season."
