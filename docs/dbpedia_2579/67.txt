The El Auja Zone was a Demilitarized zone in the western Negev desert between Israel and Egypt, about 60 km south of Gaza. It was created as a result of the 1949 Armistice Agreements around the Negev Bedouin village of "El Auja" (also "Auja el Haffir" or "Auja Hafir"), which was located three kilometers east of the border with Egypt. The area was to become part of the Palestinian State according the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine. The zone was occupied by Israel on September 21, 1955. It has been a part of South District (Israel), Beersheba Sub-District, since.

The Israeli name of the area is Nitzana (also "Nitsana", "Nizzana" or "Nessana"), after an ancient Nabatean city.
