        "text": "Israel demanded today an emergency session of the Israel-Jordan Mixed Armistice Commission to consider three charges of truce violations during September and October. These three are the only cases of the more than 350 submitted by Israel covering the seven-month period when Israel boycotted the MAC,that Israel insists on discussing. There is a possibility that if these three cases are considered in an emergency session, Israel will agree to strike out all of the other complaints. The three incidents are: the murder of two Israeli soldiers near Bir Mayin, September 10; an attack on Israeli army vehicles by Arab Legionnaires in the same area October 10; and the rustling of a flock of sheep in the Megiddo-area September 27.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel has complained to the Israel-Egyptian MAC over the fact that an Israeli truck was brought under fire by Egyptian positions near Auja el Hafir yesterday."
