For each of us, it has meant an unaccustomed foray into the most contemporary style of academic work, collaborative scholarship. We can say with confidence that three authors are behind every entry in Fifty Early Medieval Things. Though each artifact in our assemblage was researched and written up by one of us, we took full advantage of the possibilities opened by current electronic forms of communication: the others read, weighed in on, commented, and edited every Thing. Our cooperation began fortuitously, as a coffee-hour discussion at a medieval studies conference in 2011, and developed through hundreds of e-mails, online PDF exchanges, and further meetings in person. Thus we must acknowledge first each other’s contribution to what we wrote individually, and to the formation of the book. But if we think Fifty Early Medieval Things is not the product of traditional, isolated scholarly research into the past, that is also due to the kindness and interest of numerous other people who have read parts of the book, provided valuable sounding boards, given encouragement, supplied materials, offered advice, and made important corrections in our text, beginning with the three anonymous reviewers for Cornell University Press. Among those people, we somewhat arbitrarily single out the following for their generous engagement with our work: Haley Behr, Leila Bisharat, Vincenzo Binetti, Gianfranco Brogiolo, Heidi Busch Binetti, Lanfredo Castelletti, Alice Choyke, Erdem Cipa, Florin Curta, Rosanna Di Pinto, Bonnie Effros, Laura Garver, Stefan Heidemann, Lynn Jones, Kenneth Jonsson, Filip Kobylecki, Genevra Kornbluth, Anita Korom, Stephanie Leitzel, Will MacFarlane, Daniele Manacorda, Bob Miller, Giovanni Minonne, Ian\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-0FM-r02.indd 9\n\n11/20/2018 12:34:45 PM\n\nx\n\nACknowledgments\n\nMladjov, Eric Morgel, Tina Pannella, Helmut Puff, Giacomo Squatriti, Marina Uboldi, Umberto Utro, Fred van Doorninck, Carola Zimmermann. To all of them, our grateful thanks. Further thanks are due to the University of Michigan Office of the Vice President for Research, Indiana University’s Institute for Advanced Study, and the Presidential Fund for Faculty Advancement at Hunter College, CUNY, for contributing funds toward the book’s production. Paolo Squatriti’s share in the present volume is dedicated to Anna, Giulia, and Luisa, whose commitment to materiality is different than this book’s, but who always look over his historical pursuits with indulgence. Hendrik Dey dedicates his share to his students at Hunter College, who always remind him in various ways of how and why things matter so much. Deborah Deliyannis dedicates her share to Plato, Harry, and Simon, whose answer to every question is “Sutton Who?”\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-0FM-r02.indd 10\n\n11/20/2018 12:34:45 PM\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-0FM-r02.indd 11\n\n11/20/2018 12:34:45 PM\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-0FM-r02.indd 12\n\n11/20/2018 12:34:47 PM\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-0FM-r02.indd 13\n\n11/20/2018 12:34:48 PM\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-0FM-r02.indd 14\n\n11/20/2018 12:34:48 PM\n\nFifty Early Medieval Things\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-0FM-r02.indd 15\n\n11/20/2018 12:34:48 PM\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-0FM-r02.indd 16\n\n11/20/2018 12:34:48 PM\n\nIntroductIon\n\nThings, Matter, and Meaning in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages\n\nAt the very end of the early Middle Ages, in the year 1000, a gathering of colonists from Scandinavia who had settled in Iceland took the unprecedented step of voting to abandon the ancestral gods and embrace Christianity. Disregarding the King of Hearts’ excellent advice in Alice in Wonderland to “begin at the beginning,” in this case it makes sense to begin at the end because the meeting of Icelanders was called a “thing.”1 Like the closely related Old English word þing that spawned modern English “thing,”2 the Icelandic assembly suggests that the postclassical era (ca. AD 300–1000, and divided by historians into the overlapping periods of Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages) has much to offer to the contemporary study of material culture. Indeed, we shall see in what follows that some of the most acute theorizers on material culture, like Martin Heidegger, have borrowed from this early medieval etymology of “thing” to analyze modern engagement with objects. Fifty Early Medieval Things has its roots in our conviction that the material culture of the postclassical world is not only inherently interesting but also opens vistas onto the period that are fresh, surprising, and instructive.3 In this volume, we deal with tangible things—artifacts, buildings, and archaeological features— while remaining alert to their intangible, even invisible dimensions so as to fit the things we discuss into appropriate historical contexts. Our things are usually interpreted alongside written sources that help in understanding their historical context; however, sometimes the material culture seems to contradict what the writings say, or even fills spaces left void by written sources. One purpose of this book is to show how material culture from the period AD 300–1000 informs us\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 1\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:12 PM\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nboth about the past and how interpreting such material culture can be fraught, difficult, and ambiguous. Our presentation of late antique and early medieval things is informed by (and hopefully informs) ideas about the relationship of material culture to the study of the past that have established themselves in recent scholarship. Until lately, the study of the medieval past tended to take place in compartments, divided between those who studied its manufactured objects, buildings, traces of agricultural practice, and human remains—primarily archaeologists and art historians—and those who studied historia in the form in which the written sources delivered it to the present. Historians have only in the past two decades begun to interact fruitfully with archaeologists’, anthropologists’, and art historians’ findings, and with their theories of material culture. The 1990s development of a “thing theory” as part of the broader “material turn” in academia has offered a new way to understand material culture and bring it into literary and historical discourse. Since people made and used things during the period 300–1000, investing them with meanings that could go well beyond the practical, we concur that the study of postclassical things can benefit from these recently developed ideas about material culture. We also think that the late antique and early medieval periods have much to contribute to material culture studies, which have tended to focus on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In the following sections, we introduce the reader to the historical background and theoretical underpinnings for the study of early medieval material culture. The first section presents an outline of late antique and early medieval history in Europe and the Mediterranean. The second part traces the main contours of the academic study of things. And in the third part, we explore the materiality of late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, providing an overview of what the things included in this book can tell us about early medieval people and the material world they inhabited.\n\nOutlines of a Postclassical History The late antique and early medieval periods were characterized above all by sharp fluctuations in the power of rulers and their governments, and by the conversion of most people in western Eurasia and northern Africa to Christianity or Islam. The two processes were of course closely connected, but here we treat them sequentially, beginning with the history of state authority, and then turning to the history of the most successful monotheisms of that time. The term Late Antiquity refers to the period of time in which the regions of the Roman Empire and the Mediterranean saw many changes, while at the same time retaining political and economic structures from the classical past. In the\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 2\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:12 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nthird century, the Roman Empire faced civil war, invasion, epidemic disease, and economic depression. The empire reacted to these events by reforms; the gradual, mostly controlled reduction in the range and proficiency of Rome’s imperial administration affected Rome’s western provinces the most. In the eastern half of the empire, there were more numerous and populous urban centers, more robust and variegated agriculture and industry, better-developed infrastructure for the circulation of people and goods, and more committed rulers, ensconced in an impregnable new Rome on the Bosporus: Constantinople. Such resources meant that life in the East flowed by with fewer ripples and waves, at least until the seventh century. Even in the 600s the eastern Roman Empire was solid enough that it became one model of efficient governance for the most effective postclassical state of all, the Islamic Caliphate (another of whose models was the Sasanian Empire, centered in Persia). But demographic decline (related to recurrent epidemics after 541), military reverses, and general impoverishment related to both of these, deprived eastern Roman government of capability. This state of affairs was ruptured in the early seventh century. First the Sasanians occupied vast swathes of Roman territory. Before the eastern Roman Empire had completed its reconquest, in the 630s Arabs, politically and religiously unified by Muhammad, began to conquer large parts of Persia and the Roman Mediterranean, and after 711 had reached Spain and the Hindu Kush, setting up their own imperial state. The Islamic Caliphate’s central government judiciously marshaled its assets, including the financial backing (there was a special poll tax on non-Muslims) and the know-how of its Jewish, Zoroastrian, and Christian subjects. Whether in Damascus (under the Umayyads, AD 661–750) or in the new, circular capital of Baghdad, “crossroads of the universe,” under the Abbasid dynasty (750–1258), early medieval caliphs formed and managed efficient, meritocratic, literate state apparatuses based on taxation of their subjects’ property. This upbeat account of early medieval state formation is tempered somewhat by the tenth-century revival of provincial authorities in Iran, Egypt, North Africa, and Spain, where governors who were increasingly independent of Baghdad ruled and represented local interests, and some of whom eventually adopted the title of caliph themselves. The Roman Empire in Constantinople continued as a political entity in its reduced territories, still emphasizing its connections with the Roman past; modern historians often call it the Byzantine Empire. From 650 to 850, Byzantine emperors ruled a rump state, tenuously clinging to Anatolia, pockets of the southern Balkans, south Italy, and the Aegean islands. Constantinople’s rulers never stopped taxing land or paying troops in cash, while around their Great Palace literate administrators scurried with documents a Roman bureaucrat might have recognized. In the tenth century, buoyed by the Caliphate’s decentralization and Baghdad’s weaker grip over the provinces, as well as by the creation of\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 3\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:12 PM\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nvigorous Orthodox Christian churches in the Balkans and, by 1000, in Russia, the Byzantine Empire could again imagine itself as an ecumenical power in the truest sense. The early medieval Islamic and Byzantine states were far more centralized than their contemporaries in Latin Christian Europe. There, during the fifth century, outsiders identified by the Romans as “barbarians”—Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Franks, Angles, Saxons, Lombards, and others—replaced western Roman governance with competing, regional polities. Their leaders relied on personal ties to elite subjects and on ethnic loyalties to create solidarity and maintain power. Though most early medieval rulers surrounded themselves with capable clergymen as well as muscular retainers, few had elaborate administrations or the ability to systematically tax their subjects. These weaknesses kept barbarian hegemony regional in scale until the eighth-century rise of the Frankish Carolingian family. And though the Carolingians experimented skillfully for about a century (ca. 750–850) with pan-European statehood and power, their precarious construction fell apart in the later ninth century. Certainly the collapse of the Carolingian Empire was aided by incursions of Vikings, Arabs, and Magyars to which the Franks found no adequate military response. But the personal nature of royal authority, the limited range of state bureaucracy, and the scanty taxation of which early medieval kingdoms were capable meant that tenth-century Europe settled back quickly into its congenital divided condition. Attempts to revive the Roman Empire of Charlemagne (d. 814) by the dukes of Saxony (now called the Ottonians) were ephemeral and enjoyed limited support in Europe. Otto II (d. 983) confronted continuous uprisings in Italy, Bavaria, and along the Elbe River; his successor Otto III (d. 1002) faced stiff resistance even in Rome, nominal capital of his empire. In the cultural sphere, the affirmation of relatively new, exclusive monotheistic religious systems was certainly late antiquity’s biggest innovation. Rome’s tolerant, inclusive paganism had allowed Christianity to survive, and then from the third century to thrive. The conversion to Christianity by Rome’s emperor Constantine and, over a few generations, by the governing class of the empire, led to more rigid conceptions of religious community. By the fifth century, openly polytheistic believers were few in Roman-ruled territories, and pagan religious practices were banned. Christianity became the official state religion, and though Judaism was allowed to exist, it did so under severe restrictions. Islam’s swift expansion into west Asia and the Mediterranean in the mid-seventh century further extended the influence of One-God religions. Originating in Arabia, on the southernmost fringe of the ancient world, its success can appear surprising. (Indeed, surprise is often invoked to explain why the Sasanian and Roman empires so ineffectively resisted the armies of the Rightly Guided Caliphs in AD 630–670.) But Islamic monotheism participated in a broader trend.\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 4\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:12 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nIn the Roman Empire, Christian clergymen labored diligently to adapt their religion to the new circumstances in which it found itself after Constantine’s conversion. They hammered out a consensus on what Christians should believe, which texts they should consider divinely inspired, and which Christians should hold authority in society. Supported by the Roman government and funded by Roman elites, these ideas took hold in cities throughout the empire. Particularly in places where Roman authority became weaker, bishops became urban leaders in a practical as well as a spiritual sense. Even where cities (and hence bishops) were fewer, for example in Western Europe, Christianity remained an urban religion well past the middle of the first millennium. The conversion to Christianity (and indeed, to Islam) of rural populations is not well understood, but clearly monotheism penetrated more slowly in rural areas. Monasteries, many of which were built as isolated rural retreats, played an important role in spreading Christianity there. Monasticism had arisen in the Egyptian wastelands around 300 partly as a critique of Christianity’s compromises with power. Christian nuns’ and monks’ evident holiness, as embodied in their self-discipline and apparent disregard of social obligation, as well as their living out Jesus’ injunctions to his followers, elevated them above ordinary folk. They won respect and social prestige. This was just as true in Constantinople, the foothills of the Caucasus, and the hamlets of the Nile Valley as it was on the windswept crags of Ireland. Especially in Europe, Irish and English monks had an impact disproportionate to their numbers on the export of Christianity to the countryside. Monks were also effective missionaries to Germanic- and Slavic-speaking areas (eastern Germany, southern Scandinavia, Poland, the Danube Valley, even the Balkans, via Byzantine missions) from the seventh century onward. In the last centuries of the early Middle Ages, monastic institutions turned their high spiritual and social standing into economic and political power through the patronage of wealthy families and powerful secular rulers. This transformation is not entirely surprising. From its inception, monasticism was also an integral part of the Christian societies that supported it, reflecting not just the aspirations of pious people but also the realities of their lives. Europe’s aristocratic abbesses and monks, and opulent monasteries, reflected the hierarchical arrangement of tenth-century communities. The aristocratic tenor of European monasticism circa AD 1000 mirrors the renewed ascendancy of elites in other Christian societies, like Byzantium. It also mirrors the growing authority of the ulama, the class of legal specialists who, after about 800, articulated a code of conduct for Muslims out of the Qurʾanic scriptures and the records of Muhammad and his immediate followers’ activities (hadith). The Islamic communities of western Asia, North Africa, and Iberia were far more socially and economically complex than the Christian one of Europe\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 5\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:13 PM\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\n(or Byzantium outside Constantinople); yet late in the first millennium new social hierarchies emerged within them, too, reflecting a new cultural balance. Thus, the universal acceptance of monotheistic belief systems, initially sponsored by all-powerful imperial rulers, had the unexpected consequence of fostering new self-confident elites more independent of central authority. By the tenth century, Islamic belief and practice provided sufficient legitimation to these elites. The seven postclassical centuries, therefore, encompass both state failure (the western Roman Empire) and state building (the Caliphate, the Carolingian Empire, several smaller polities with more provincial horizons, like Fatimid Egypt, Bulgaria, or Wessex in England). They also witnessed massive cultural shifts, particularly in religious sensibilities that would shape the medieval, early modern, and modern Eurasian world. The later repercussions of political and religious choices made by postclassical people impart special interest to their material culture.\n\nMaterial Turns As noted above, it has been only in surprisingly recent times that historians have joined the fashion for material culture studies. Scholars of things associate the “material turn” that Anglophone academia took sometime late in the 1990s— which foregrounded discussions and analyses of material culture, of objects, artifacts, and things—with the reception of a now-celebrated collection of essays, including one by Igor Kopytoff entitled “The Cultural Biography of Things: Commodification as Process,” that questioned the distinction between human and thing and proposed that objects had voices.4 The intellectual movement labeled “material turn” was partly a reaction to an earlier “discursive turn” and to perhaps exaggerated interest in how words alone constitute perceived reality. But one of the key insights it generated is that objects are best understood when closely scrutinized within their real-life contexts. Some of the leading practitioners of the trend have taken up this important concept and set their own movement into its cultural context, speculating that at least four contemporary conditions undergirded the “material turn.”5 First, in the last twenty years, the gradual and growing digitization of culture may have inspired the fascination with objects and their use. Since many of the academics who fashioned or followed the “material turn” grew up when (for example) listening to music was done not by download but by putting a round piece of black plastic onto a record player (or, later, a silvered, slightly smaller one into a disc-player), they are particularly sensitive to the dematerialization that digital culture brings. Lovers of books, too, might rue the digital flows of text and image by which contemporary information moves between people, and these\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 6\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:13 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nexamples could easily be multiplied. Thus, a kind of compensatory anxiety typical of recent settlers in the e-world might motivate the current heightened interest in objects and how they function among people. Closely related to this is a second bit of cultural background. The increasing competence of things, their ability to perform all manner of tasks formerly the exclusive domain of people, their ability to replace people, has blurred the lines between thing and person, but also fostered worries and curiosities about things’ nature. When robots regularly beat Grand Masters at chess, drive far more safely than commuters do, and leave floors much cleaner than human hands can, a rational human reaction might be to begin to wonder about things and to want to observe them more closely.6 This remains true even though the underlying cause of the triumph of things over people is intangible artificial intelligence. A third important component of the cultural context within which First World people took the “material turn” is globalization and advanced capitalism.7 One of the peculiarities of that economic and cultural formation is the ever speedier production, circulation, and consumption of goods, namely of things. But in order to consume more things more quickly, people have to make room for them by abbreviating the utilization of the things they already have. The very fast life cycle of things necessary to sustain the contemporary consumption economy is based on a rapid devaluation of things, enabling them to be thrown away and replaced. This novel situation has produced some curious side effects. For instance, since human memory depends on things to avoid oblivion, some critics propose that contemporary indifference to the past derives from the enforced indifference to things that rapid consumption cycles imply.8 In addition, some historians note that the history of hoarding, the opposite of the throw-away-to-consume-more culture, is quite shallow, barely extending back past 1950. Though early medieval people did create hoards that have been uncovered centuries later, they generally did so in exceptional moments of stress, as when natural disasters or invading armies undermined the foundations of their lives and they feared losing the things they deemed most valuable (see Things 1, 23, 34). And in the North Sea region, ritual deposits also created hoards, from the fourth through the seventh centuries. But houses full to the rafters of collected knick-knacks, plastic bottle caps, old newspapers, long-unworn baseball caps, or whatever else the inhabitant fancied, are a phenomenon of very recent times, one that has been plausibly connected to the huge surge and rapid turnover in the possession of things that advanced capitalism generates.9 The modern hoarder, then, may be expressing anxiety about the impermanence of things and their apparent loss of value by clinging to them, even though the neighbors consider them useless and the hoarder crazy. Hoarders might seem to resemble the nostalgic collectors of Barbie dolls, or muscle cars, in attempting to resist the impermanence of the contemporary material culture as it has\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 7\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:13 PM\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nbeen shaped by the prevailing economic system. Yet the collectors do more than reflect twenty-first century attitudes toward things; ironically, this nostalgia for objects, particularly objects associated with the nostalgic person’s youth, itself feeds a booming business and supports the heightened consumption patterns of the twenty-first century.10 A fourth contextual explanation for the “material turn” is ecological. The earth, to some of the proponents of the turn, is the most precious thing of all, and it is being devastated on a scale and at a speed with few precedents, none in the past few millennia. The realization that the irrevocable ruin of the planet on which we live may be imminent, and that the productive systems that sustain us increase the likelihood of its destruction, seems to some of those engaged in the study of material culture an important motivation for their studies. They point out that it is the very things that make our lives easier and more pleasant that are causing the damage, both because producing them has several unintended consequences, and because after they are discarded we lose control over things and they go about their business, decomposing at variable rates (or not), in ways that are detrimental to our interests. Environmental pollution, in other words, is an inevitable component of human involvement with things, giving the “new materialists” (a collective term for those who study material culture after the “turn”) even more reason to uncover the history of humanity’s relationship to the things it creates. One could object that these various rationales for current interest in things are all predicated on an exceptionalist idea of contemporary times, as if only twentyfirst century capitalism has produced the conditions for deep engagement with artifacts. Yet it was the great early twentieth-century economist John Kenneth Galbraith who proposed (way back in 1958) that Western societies had attained an unprecedented level of affluence, making it possible for people to surround themselves with unprecedented numbers of things, and to enjoy thereby unprecedented ease.11 Taking a broader perspective, we find that for at least two hundred years capitalist modernity has coincided with the production, distribution, and consumption of lots of things, so one may doubt that what has transpired over the past twenty years is radically different from what happened earlier, well before anyone had swerved into any “material turn.” This leaves the causes of First World intellectuals’ “material turn” somewhat indeterminate. But, as we shall see in the next section, indeterminacy characterizes things, at least in their abstract, written form.\n\nObject, Artifact, Thing: Secret Agents? Our discussions of things have tended so far toward a rather unscientific vagueness about what a thing is. We want to uphold this indeterminacy: the terms thing,\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 8\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:13 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nartifact, and object are used pretty much interchangeably in this book, though here we follow fashion and tend to use “thing” the most.12 While we recognize that significant semantic distinctions are possible, and respect the intellectual labor behind the construction of these distinctions, in our book, which is about specific things more than theories of things, it seems sufficient to explain what differences practitioners of material culture studies have seen in the words used to describe things, and some ramifications deriving from the chosen vocabulary.13 This section explores in a little more depth the recent scholarly theories about things and sketches in some of their genealogies. Artifact is perhaps the easiest to deal with, as it involves artifice and human ingenuity and is thus a special category of thing: one made by humans. But even that apparently simple distinction, under scrutiny, becomes hard to support. For it is possible to argue that virtually nothing in the material world is utterly unaffected by humans. Even seemingly pristine wilderness depends on human choices and strategies of resource use, its animal populations are shaped by faraway humans’ hunting, gathering, and farming activities, and its plants are affected by people’s use of fire, whose aerially transmitted waste can settle hundreds of kilometers from where the people are. Similarly the natural, organic chestnut (Thing 12), like all domesticated plants, is a product of centuries of human selection, propagation, grafting, and is not so purely natural after all. “Object” is the least popular term these days, as it implies a subject who controls it, and many who took the “material turn” are unconvinced by the subject/object divide, as they are by other traditional dualities like person/thing and mind/matter. Since the object is (according to the word’s Latin etymology) that which is thrown up against, or that which opposes the subject, the use of the word object reduces the thing’s capacity to shape outcomes except in this oppositional way. Hence most new materialists follow the lead of Bill Brown and especially of Ian Hodder and embrace the word thing. To them, things are what artifacts and objects aspire to be; that is, they are the realization of artifactual and objective potential. Things are vastly more capable and potent than objects and artifacts, more in control of their fates, and ours. A central tenet to most current theories of things is the recognition of things’ irreducible thingness, their uncontrollable nature. Things have an ability to cooperate with people in producing outcomes without ever being completely dominated by them. Thus, new materialists tend to deny humans any supremacy in the material world. They suggest that things can do things. They propose that reality is a composite of humans and things, knitted together in an infinitely convoluted mesh. Within this mesh both humans and things “co-constitute” each other because it is the relations between them that create the physical world; both depend on dealings with the other for their own existence and identity. The perplexities of the new materialism confirm the wisdom of Winnie the Pooh, who\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 9\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:13 PM\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nsaid, “When you are a Bear of Very Little Brain, and you Think of Things, you find sometimes that a Thing which seemed very Thingish inside you is quite different when it gets out into the open and has other people looking at it.”14 Things had seemed so simple and determinate; they turn out not to be at all. The new materialism is, of course, in dialogue with older materialisms in the long history of Western philosophy. Some recognize in ancient Greek atomist philosophy the precursor of the current “material turn.” Building on it, the Latin Epicurean Lucretius’s poem The Nature of Things described the perceptible world as the outcome of the random circulation of miniscule particles. The contemporary materialists, who define a thing as a stage in the process of matter’s never-ending transformation are no doubt cheered by the encounter with such venerable antecedents to their own sense of the world. The idea that everything, including people, is made of the very same particles has also resonated among those who find the distinction between human and nonhuman things troubling.15 More directly relevant to most new materialists, however, are the materialisms of the nineteenth century devised by thinkers who observed how the new industrial modes of production that emerged after 1800 multiplied the number of things.16 In particular, Karl Marx’s insights into relations between people and things as a result of industrial capitalism, which he termed “fetishism,” have deeply informed the recent scholarship on things.17 For Marx, industrialization was an epochal shift in the history of things, because the “use value” of things lost ground to their commercial value when the things’ makers no longer had full control over, and thus full understanding of, what they had made; for now all decisions regarding production were made by the capitalists. Regardless of the skepticism that surrounds it as a philosophical system, Marxist materialism contributed to the “material turn” an insistence on the importance of matter and commodities, especially their production, in any analysis of culture. It also contributed a worldview in which capitalist, industrial modernity radically departed from a premodernity that encompasses Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. While Marxist materialism focuses on production, theories on the consumption of things have diverse genealogies.18 In the 1970s, anthropology became interested in the “consumer society” and the cultural ramifications of being inundated with things.19 Historians of consumption soon followed suit, inspired by the innovative French historian Fernand Braudel (d. 1985), again identifying in heightened modern consumption patterns a turning point in history.20 But interest in the “crystallized” form of things, the version of them the consumer encounters, means that contemporary scholarship on things sometimes forgets Marx’s point about the materials that went into making the thing, and the processes of production. For instance, the ongoing transformation of things, their impermanence, their erosion or decay, depends on the materials that make them up, which Ingold believes need to be taken more seriously in the study of material culture.21\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 10\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:13 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nAnother formidable figure in the intellectual lineage of the new materialism is the German philosopher, Martin Heidegger (d. 1976). In his 1950 lecture on “The Thing” (which was published in English in 1971),22 Heidegger discussed a pottery jug, proposing that the void within it, though not produced by the potter, is central to its being. Like the jug, other things gather together materials, forms, human work and care, but their thingness remains autonomous, beyond their manufactured properties. Heidegger was deeply impressed by the early medieval usage of the word thing to mean a gathering, like the Icelandic assembly with which this introduction opened. Heidegger’s belief in things’ autonomous reality and their ability to gather human intentions and wants has inspired materialists who ascribe a vigorous agency to things. To some of them, things are “vibrant matter” endowed with a kind of vitality that constrains and directs human activity.23 They advocate for more conscious, respectful treatment of things, recognizing that people and things are not so very different. They resist the notion that equating things and people, as for instance did early medieval slave traders and some landowners, so lowers human status as to invite inhuman treatment of people.24 Instead they think more democratic relations between things and people will produce humbler people acting in more ecologically responsible ways. Related to this critique of twentieth- and twenty-first-century engagement with the material world is actor network theory (ANT), associated especially with the French sociologist of science Bruno Latour. ANT, too, assigns a kind of agency to things. Latour called things “actants” because they participate in creating the outcome of any action. Hence, in a lab, the white apron and the test tube are actants, like the technician using them. All three are symmetrical in a relationship that produces the experiment.25 In a certain sense, ANT aligns with the late thinking of Charles Darwin (d. 1882), whose study of earthworms resulted in his belief that they exercised a “small agency,” with impact on history because of the worms’ positive contribution to plant and human life.26 Likewise, ANT advocates argue for less anthropocentric conceptions of how events happen. Unsurprisingly, Latour has been an important presence in discussions of the hybrid object, the robot or the bionic man that melts some of the formerly rigid boundaries between thing and person.27 Over the past few years, Ian Hodder, the archaeologist most active in excavating and publicizing the large Neolithic and Chalcolithic town at Çatalhöyük in southern Anatolia, has also animated debates about things.28 At University College, London, Hodder has organized a center of material culture studies that also publishes the Journal of Material Culture.29 His notion of “entanglement” attempts to convey how things, whose life cycles do not synchronize with those of humans, drive people into ever deeper, more laborious relationships through maintenance. For example, the mud brick walls of Çatalhöyük’s houses forced the inhabitants to rebuild, reinforce, buttress, and fix them with still more walls\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 11\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:13 PM\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\npractically every year, because of the wall’s material nature (gooey when wet, which made thickening them prudent prior to the rainy winter months). Hodder eventually came to see such entanglement as a more sinister “entrapment.”30 Each thing calls for other things in order to work properly, and human servicing of the mesh of interrelated things becomes increasingly burdensome over time. Yet a “path dependency” obliges people to keep up the cycle of fixes, endlessly adding more things to the mesh to keep it running.31 Thus, Hodder recognizes that a thing, even if it is not a conscious, intentional “primary” agency, has the power to create outcomes.32 In fact, he thinks that it is precisely when things blend into the background, when people hardly notice them any more so essential are they to the everyday rhythms of life, that things are most powerful: they have become naturalized. Not everyone is persuaded that the thing has agency (with academics, unanimity is unattainable). Both archaeologists, long acquainted with artifacts, and historians, congenitally predisposed to skepticism, have expressed doubt over this particular perspective afforded by the “material turn.”33 Indeed, the anthropologist Tim Ingold has called the agent thing “magical mind-dust” and advocated paying more attention to what things are made out of, how, and why.34 Ingold concedes things may have an animating principle but suggests that to conceive of such a principle as external to the things, added to it somehow, and not inherent in their matter, is wrongheaded. Even Brown, who was instrumental in convincing literary scholars that the material lurking in the words they read was an important intellectual concern, allowed that it might be disappointing for those who turned toward things in search of the solid, the authentic, the straightforward, to find that instead the object world was active, unstable, tricky, and very complicated.35 For our part, as historians, art historians, and archaeologists trained before the swerve toward materiality dematerialized things into sophisticated sets of ideas, we tend to side with the skeptics about the utility of imagining “agential objects” and “vibrant matter.” But as we think Fifty Early Medieval Things proves throughout, we are very much in sympathy with the attempt to understand the past less anthropocentrically, to see more symmetries in the relations between people and their stuff, to recognize the limits in human capacities to control events and things, and overall to observe the things that surround people as a crucial, even “co-constitutive” part of their reality, past as well as present.\n\nEarly Medieval Things I: Enchantment Recent treatments of things, as described above, are largely indifferent to the premodern period, and particularly to the Middle Ages. It is the supposedly\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 12\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:13 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nunprecedented acceleration in the circulation of things around 1450, the increased consumption levels that accompanied it, and the incipient scientific approach to the physical world that render things worthy of study.36 According to this idea, modernity corresponds to a “disenchantment” with the material world, to a rational ability to see things empirically, indeed objectively, and to a persuasion that stuff is just stuff and need not mean anything beyond itself.37 Cultures in which this was not the case are hard for these theories to digest. Thus scholars of early modern times fit their objects of study into the discourses of the new materialists by differentiating post-1450 attitudes from the medieval millennium. The unspoken assumption has been that a time like the later first millennium, associated with otherworldliness and primitive living conditions, cannot offer much to the comprehension of things and material culture.38 We would instead argue that these conditions provide an even more interesting case study about the relation of things to people. Many writers of the late antique and early medieval period did consider the created, material world to be less significant than the immaterial, invisible one, but the very fact that they could make this argument implies not indifference to, but a notable awareness of, materiality. And most who study the period today would agree that the archaeological and literary evidence for considerable reductions in the size and refinement of economic activity is very strong, especially for the period 550–800 in Western Europe, the Balkans, and Anatolia. The “decline and fall of the Roman empire” and the attendant economic shrinkage provide a thought-provoking case study in dis-entanglement with things and call into question some teleological assumptions of the followers of the “material turn.” Thus, postclassical culture offers some important insights for the conceptualization of things today. In the early seventh century, Isidore of Seville, a bishop and early medieval polymath, noted the atomist theories of ancient materialist philosophers. As he was attempting to capture all necessary knowledge, and to explain the observable world through the meaning of words, he was highly motivated to include materialist teachings in his encyclopedia called Etymologies. It is intriguing that he did not actually condemn them.39 Isidore of Seville had other, theocentric ideas about the nature of matter and the process whereby the material world was created, yet he presented the atomist universe dispassionately as a feasible hypothesis. He also discussed the nature of matter, as usual for him etymologically, and pointed out that the word materia (he was writing in Latin) was identical to the word for wood, and that both were related to the word for mother (mater). Consequently, the great Iberian data-cruncher conceived of matter as a generative substance, able to give birth to things, alive as trees are alive, and thus potentially an agent. However subordinate to the will of God the creator, Isidore’s material world was certainly not inert or passive.40\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 13\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:13 PM\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis curious alignment of a Dark Age thinker with postmodern materialist thought is replicated also when we consider the enormous respect early medieval people, especially, but not only, Latin and Eastern Orthodox Christians, had for certain things. By the fifth century, relics—the corporeal remains of holy people or objects those people had touched—were just about the most potent things in the Mediterranean region. Relics were often parts of a human body, and sometimes were housed in special containers (see Things 16 and 19). Even fragmentary relics, veiled from view by elaborate reliquaries, nevertheless were able to evoke the full presence of God’s most devoted servants, the dead saints, and channel into the everyday world all the power of God that saints could evoke. Late antique and early medieval Christians had a decidedly postmodern awareness of the power in apparently inert stuff. They understood how the material fused with the immaterial aspects of life. Likewise, portraits of holy people, properly approached, could function in a similar way.41 Such icons, whether portable or in buildings, were the target of state-sponsored destruction in the iconoclastic movement that gripped the Byzantine Empire, off and on, in the eighth and ninth centuries. Iconoclasm was also based on a recognition of these special objects’ enormous power, which became the subject of reams of theological arguments on both sides.42 That a Frankish ruler, far removed from Byzantine influence, should worry about the issue, and become personally involved in composing a theological treatise about the correct treatment of icons in the 790s, underlines the point, as do eighthand ninth-century Muslims’ doubts about the appropriate religious use of pictures:43 early medieval people took their material culture very seriously, and many ascribed potency to things, whether natural or man-made.44 This observation is confirmed by early medieval laws of Celtic, Germanic, and Roman inspiration. These routinely ascribed to things the ability to do harm to people, and punished plants and animals (considered animated things), as well as obviously inanimate things like swords, for the harm they did. The culpability of things was related to the religious sensibility behind Latin liturgical invocations addressed at objects. These elaborate prayers abjured objects to behave well or stop behaving badly, in ways that were damaging to people. Like the secular laws, such prayers could only be effective in a thought world where things had agency, and in which they could understand human language and reasoning.45 Of course, the reason why postclassical people thought things had talent was not the same as the reason why postmodern critics perceive thingly agency around them and argue for an indissoluble union of matter and culture. In a series of lectures about late medieval European attempts to grapple with the problem of how the holy, which is eternal, could become embroiled in matter, which is ephemeral, Caroline Walker Bynum pinpointed a basic tension in\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 14\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:13 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nChristian theology.46 Bynum emphasized the differences between early and late medieval Christian sensibilities, illuminating late medieval Europe’s greater propensity to recognize the vitality in matter, and the later period’s dedication to a very human (and therefore material) Christ as opposed to the severe, distant, rather abstract judge early medieval people apparently preferred. Yet early medieval Christians, too, dealt with the material world under the assumption that God created it, so it could manifest Him. They too knew that matter could be in touch with God and make God accessible on earth. Indeed, the manufacture of so-called contact relics, sometimes quite humdrum things like scraps of cloth that had been in contact with holy things like relics, or liquids that had been near them (see Things 19 and 24), was well under way in the sixth century, and remained an early medieval passion thereafter. The existence of holy things like relics and contact relics, but also of mosques and the Torah, qualifies early medieval engagement with the material world. If the incarnation of God as Jesus did not enjoy the primacy in early medieval theology that it came to enjoy later, still early medieval Christians accepted that matter could and sometimes did present ordinary mortals with a chance to grasp the immaterial, however scary the experience might be. Muslims and Jews, more persuaded by divine transcendence, nevertheless accepted that an omnipotent creator might manifest Himself miraculously in the physical world. In the early Middle Ages, not everyone rejoiced over the potential of things. Most matter was not incorruptible, like saints’ bodies, but prone to decay, a reminder of human transience. To some it was primarily a distraction from the more urgent concerns of life. Zoroastrians in the Persian Empire were committed to advancing spirituality and restraining materiality both in everyday transactions and in the cosmic encounter between good and evil of which believers were earthly witnesses. Christian and Islamic asceticism derived from a more fundamental, scripturally sanctioned, suspicion of the material world and of enjoyment of its plenty. The ability to control one’s bodily wants, to reduce one’s dependence on others, and throughout to limit one’s use of things was highly regarded from Ireland (Thing 30) to Armenia, from Monastir (Thing 33) to Novgorod. Monasticism in its various forms was a response to Jesus’ injunctions and to a widespread longing to be free of things, or anyhow less involved with them so as to focus on spiritual pursuits monks and nuns imagined to be immaterial. Some of the most successful holy people of the first millennium managed to find viable compromises with things, like the wealthy Cappadocian aristocrat Macrina, who turned her mansion into a monastery around AD 350, or the charitable widow Mathilda, who fed and clothed the indigent in tenth-century Germany.47 That many early medieval hermits and monasteries ended up quite entangled in the material world, despite herculean efforts to the contrary, does not reduce the impact of their ideal. It is an ideal that animates, still today, many\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 15\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:13 PM\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\napparently secular ideologies, and arguably one that undergirds the aspiration of many scholars of the “material turn” to disentangle from capitalist patterns of hyperconsumption.\n\nEarly Medieval Things II: Disentanglement Both in their acceptance of matter as animate and in their suspicion of matter as spiritually corrupting, postclassical people seem to speak to contemporary concerns about relations between people and things.48 Though the separation of matter and spirit seems to many new materialists an unnecessary one, there is another way in which this remote time seems able to participate in the current debates about matter, things, and modern consumption: during the late antique period, in many of the regions where our fifty things were made and used, there occurred a visible reduction in the availability and use of things. This widespread, sometimes dramatic (and sometimes attenuated) slump in the production, circulation, and consumption of things is related to the end of Roman power in the Mediterranean, and the economic restructuring that event made necessary. Some scholars describe it much as the luminous British historian Edward Gibbon did in the eighteenth century: it was “the decline and fall of the Roman empire,” at least in the western Mediterranean.49 They single out the administrative discontinuities, the shriveled cities, the abandoned villas, the smaller size of ships (see Things 21, 39, and 42), the absence of imported wares, and many other signs of what they consider a civilizational collapse that began in the fourth century and was accomplished by the seventh.50 Even those with a more optimistic sense of what happened, who abbreviate the “transformation of the Roman world” (beginning in the 400s, with a big acceleration in the 500s), and restrict its impact to Western Europe and the Balkans, remark on a vast shrinkage in economic activity.51 Though this narrative is easy to nuance, pointing out how some regions flourished (Sicily, northern Syria, Constantinople and its hinterland, probably Persia) at the same time as others floundered, taken as a whole the archaeological record is unequivocal. By the sixth and seventh centuries, in most regions in the early medieval world by any measure the economy was smaller than it had been two centuries before and much smaller than it had been in the second century AD. Whether a slow, gradual, and partial deflation of an economic balloon overinflated by Roman state appropriations took place, or a catastrophe created by a perfect storm of barbarian invasion, volcanic eruption, climatic deterioration, and epidemic disease, the postclassical period offers students of material culture an opportunity to observe how societies deal with a reduction in the production, circulation, and consumption of things. This is pertinent to those new materialists\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 16\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:13 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nwho suppose that people have grown increasingly entangled by things over time.52 They point out that for the first 70,000 years of human existence, people used very few things.53 Then, quite suddenly, 10,000 years ago people began to farm, live sedentary lives, and to do both with increasing numbers of things. Those ten millennia have brought growing entanglement because each thing leads humans to “path dependency,” obliging the humans to take care of it, often by means of acquiring more things. Things are liable to unavoidable “biological, chemical, and physical processes of transformation” that humans try to control with the use of still more things because humans and things deteriorate at different speeds (things have different “temporalities” that make them “unstable” in human terms). As things are usually already themselves entangled with other things, the result is an ever-expanding “heterogeneous entanglement juggernaut” held together by a mesh of mutual dependencies.54 A frequently cited example of how one thing leads to another, in entanglement narratives, is the wheel. Its invention about 4000 BC is supposed to have put people on a narrow path of dependency that led (through animal domestication, war chariots, and metallurgy), to the internal combustion engine, suburban living, and “global warming.”55 It is the inevitable, ineluctable part of the story that deserves scrutiny, for during the early medieval period large swaths of the Islamic world disentangled themselves from use of the wheel, the laborious maintenance of roads, and the irrational long routes wheeled traffic imposed, and developed a highly integrated, commercial economy based on camels, donkeys, and other quadrupeds excellently adapted to getting around the Caliphate with packs strapped to their backs, and wholly without wheels.56 The shift to unwheeled traffic shows how contingent on cultural choices can be the history of entanglement. The late antique and early medieval economic downturn in turn shows that a large, complex, affluent, materially entangled society (ancient Rome and its neighbors) can dis-entangle itself from the strangling constraints of material engagement. It also suggests how such interruptions in the forward march of entanglement might work out in practice. Recently Hodder recognized that entanglement and any disentanglement from things will affect people in different socioeconomic groups in different ways, or that these processes will have a class dimension (he is less clear about whether it also has a gender or age dimension).57 Since social preeminence tends to be mediated through access to things, the more entangled in society, namely the elites, should find disentangling harder to carry out. On the contrary, Hodder has found, it is the poorer, less powerful members of societies whose entrapment is more total and whose dependency on things more inescapable. Postclassical material conditions in Europe, the Balkans, and the western Mediterranean area were more measly than they had been when Rome’s hegemony was strong. Tiny hamlets prevailed, built of light, ephemeral materials,\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 17\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:14 PM\n\n18\n\nIntroduction\n\nespecially wood, thatch, and mud (Thing 15). Tools too were simple (e.g., Thing 26), and the landscape showed fewer signs of human interference than it had for centuries before: there were ample woodlands and teeming swamps. While full autarchy (economic self-sufficiency, where people consume only what they themselves produce) never prevailed, a lot of people grew and made most of what they consumed and used. It is hard for archaeologists to distinguish between the houses and settlements of ordinary farmers and those of the people who exercised military and political power for the period of about two hundred years between AD 550 and 750. It therefore seems that in several parts of Europe, though not in northwestern France between the Rhine and Loire rivers, peasant and elite living standards were very similar. Everyone was disentangled from things, with only small distinctions visible in house size, burial ornaments, and so on. The best accounts of what happened suggest that when the state stopped taxing and recruiting in order to sustain its military machine, and the aristocracy in consequence suffered limitations on its ability to take rents from lesser folk working the land, social groups that had been lowly under Roman governance felt very considerable relief. This was true in places as different as the Danube basin, Tuscany, or the Basque lands. It was also true in Anatolia, though somewhat later, and with somewhat different effects (because the Byzantine state was not dead yet). Perhaps the most striking example of this simplification of economic arrangements comes from the Lower Danube basin, rapidly “de-Romanized” in late antiquity, and filled with tiny villages whose occupants relocated often, whenever soil fertility waned: a fine case of disentanglement, of deliberate, premeditated separation from the things people took care of.58 It is possible to poke fun at descriptions of this liberated peasantry, newly able to orient its productive strategies as it saw fit, with less concern about producing surplus for taxes and rents. It has been called the “hippie economy,” because it imagines farmers who produced household subsistence and rested when they had attained that minimal goal.59 More soberly, one leading scholar of the early medieval economy has called this (echoing a famous conversation between an English medievalist and an Italian archaeologist that seems to have taken place in the mid-1960s60) “the golden age of the peasantry.”61 And lately a giant survey of global inequality, from the Stone Age to the Internet Age, has singled out this period as one of a tiny handful of cases when the economic and social gap between “haves” and “have nots” actually shrank a bit.62 Like all golden ages, this one turned to bronze soon enough. It had never been universal anyway, and being a peasant in the Frankish heartland or in the vast Caliphate was not so different from being a peasant in Sasanian or Roman times. But also in Europe by about 800 again prevailed more competent states,\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 18\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:14 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nmore acquisitive aristocracies, and more farmers with more obligations toward both states and aristocracies. The castles of the aristocracy we still call feudal (see Thing 44), and the beautiful manuscripts of the Carolingian renaissance (Thing 40), are indications that human entanglement with things had resumed its progress. Still the major “correction” at the end of late antiquity and the beginning of the early Middle Ages stands as a reminder that growing entanglement, indeed entrapment, is not destiny. The codependency between people and things through which both co-constitute each other has many tones and, whatever its causes, a lower one is possible.63 It is an encouraging thought for dispirited new materialists considering their twenty-first century. Likewise encouraging is the thought that when societies disentangle, the majority on the low end of the pyramid can come out on top, or anyway enjoy conditions as good as anyone else, and arguably a lot better than those of their more entangled ancestors. “Golden age” peasants worked less, and less monotonously, than Roman farmers did, which seems like a decent compensation for having less access to high-quality pottery like ARS (Thing 3). Another way to consider the lessened materialism that the removal of the Roman state from the ancient economy permitted is in the trash heap. Critics of contemporary consumer culture have been interested in the creation of vast dumps, or vast “storage” industries, for the unwanted stuff people find stifling. Coping with garbage is an important entanglement that things impose on people: in societies with high consumption levels and rapid turnover of things much labor and energy gets invested in disposing of unwanted things, according to local cultural parameters. Abbasid Baghdad, Roman Carthage, tenth-century Constantinople were large agglomerations of people and things, and their “urban metabolisms” depended on dumping a lot of things in nearby rivers, roadways, and fields.64 They did this in an organized way, disposing of items in places other than where they were used. By keeping their dwellings scrupulously distinct from their garbage dumps they assigned an order to things. The most famous early medieval garbage dump was discovered in downtown Rome in the 1980s, and by 2000 had occasioned the creation of a new museum (see Thing 39). The Crypta Balbi contained a dazzling array of things, many of them imported to seventh-, eighth-, and ninth-century Rome from far away: since camels are not native to central Italy, an eighth-century camel bone, with butchery marks on it, tells a surprising story of involvement with (probably) North Africa, and there are pots and amphoras (see Thing 21) from across the eastern Mediterranean.65 Their garbage is always a more truthful revelation of what people are actually doing than what they say they are doing. In the Crypta Balbi case, several dwellings, and a couple of refined workshops manufacturing beautiful things of wood,\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 19\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:14 PM\n\n20\n\nIntroduction\n\nbone, and metal, as well as a kiln where ancient marble was baked into lime (an essential ingredient for mortar) were doing different things at different moments in the long history of occupation of the site. But here what matters is the collective indifference to waste materials, to jettisoned things, that transpires pretty much uninterrupted from the fifth century onward. The people who dumped stuff at Crypta Balbi deposited what archaeologists call “primary refuse” (intentionally discarded, usually worn out items, in their location of use) in the long run creating a thick matrix of deposits that goes a long way to explaining why the current ground level is six meters higher than the early medieval one (see Thing 39). This casual approach to garbage, tipped where people lived and worked, is quite unlike what took place in the same area during classical antiquity and reveals a new, maybe more indifferent attitude toward things, or at least toward their previous ordering. At Crypta Balbi old and useless, as well as quite new and functional artifacts got mixed in with semifinished objects, food waste, and the bits of horn and bone or metal that were carved off during manufacture, compounded with sludge deposited by the occasional flood of the Tiber that no doubt contributed to the mixing. Since the floors were hard at Crypta Balbi, one must have carefully picked one’s way around, wearing robust shoes.66 The promiscuous mixture of things at Crypta Balbi is exceptional in several ways, not least because the site lies in the center of early medieval Western Europe’s most populous city. But if other garbage dumps are simpler, and less extensive, it seems fair to say that the garbage most postclassical communities generated was hardly perceived as garbage at all. Instead it was a conglomerate of things few felt a need to keep at a distance. Such unwillingness to invest work and energy on waste disposal might be interpreted as another form of early medieval disentanglement. So might the postclassical obsession with recycling and reusing older things. The most famous example is the use of spolia, or architectural elements from previous, often pagan, buildings in early medieval structures, often churches or mosques, as well as many luxury artifacts (see Things 10, 16, 23, 32, 46).67 But a similar enthusiasm for ancient things and repurposing them has been tracked in the British Isles, where shortages of metal and other useful materials led to the stripping and destruction of older structures by teams of avid scavengers.68 Yet if the widespread practice of recycling things, for pragmatic or for ideological reasons, typified early medieval attitudes to material culture and limited waste, similar frugal habits also signal early medieval attachment to things. Surely it was her emotional investment with the brooch that led those who buried her to include a worn and broken fibula in the tomb of an Anglo-Saxon woman of the eighth century (see Thing 18 for a fibula).69 This was an heirloom, a thing she had loved and kept after it broke and lost its functionality, and the people who buried her respected her investment in it. In the early Middle Ages, detachment\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 20\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:14 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n21\n\nfrom things could coexist with passionate attachment to them, to deep emotional entanglements. Certainly that is what some written sources suggest. In spite of the declared hostility to the material world, Christian and Islamic institutions found it clung to them tenaciously. To an extent, this was because in both religious cultures the act of giving things away was important, for both individuals and religious structures. Numerous benefactors caused churches, monasteries, and mosques to amass landed property as well as movable things. Charitable redistribution of goods by religious foundations was expected, and celebrated. In practice, religious institutions became managers and stewards of lots of things, intermediaries between the donors and the religious figures or ideals to whom the gift was offered. Since these things had a special status, and participated in an immaterial economy of salvation, as well as in a terrestrial economy of production and consumption, they tended to be meticulously recorded in writing. An example is the collection of papal biographies known as the Liber Pontificalis, wherein stupefyingly long lists of gifts to churches, including lamps, altar cloths, candlesticks, clerical clothing, equipment for the celebration of Christian rituals, and so on fill up at least half of the book’s pages. When responding to iconoclastic antimaterialism seemed necessary, as it did in Rome around 800, it may not have been love for these things that motivated the listings; yet donors and recipients certainly paid intense attention to the objects in circulation.70 And though the records that survive give pride of place to descriptions of things that came into the possession of religious foundations, private wills also reveal an intense engagement with the paraphernalia of domestic life, furniture and bedding in particular when the testator was a woman, war gear for upper-class men.71 Likewise, the diplomatic dealings of Byzantine emperors and Abbasid caliphs involved much exchange of thoughtfully selected gifts (like Thing 47), scrupulously described and listed, especially but not only by the givers, in such a way as to betray sensual involvement in their materiality.72 The material early Middle Ages, all told, are far more interesting than the modernist narratives of the new materialism imagine. This period gave life to a vigorous antimaterialism and to a real case of large-scale societal disentanglement that tests the belief in things’ relentless and always expanding pull on people and communities. Europeans experimented with a new way of being on the land, imposing a far lighter footprint on it, and therefore accumulating around themselves far fewer things derived from it. With somewhat different rhythms the Byzantines in Asia Minor did the same, but on the southern rim of the Mediterranean, in Egypt and into Persia, most opulent entanglements arose, the stuff of A Thousand and One Nights, in a rich and commercially oriented society. The variegated early medieval world shows how complex, culturally contingent, and sometimes downright passionate could be people’s dealings\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 21\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:14 PM\n\n22\n\nIntroduction\n\nwith things. Though we may be modern and disenchanted with our environments, we can still see that.\n\nThe Order of Things As Dr. Seuss knew, Thing One should precede Thing Two.73 We arranged our book chronologically, so the artifacts and monuments that were created earlier appear before those that were created later in the postclassical period. Thus our collection opens with the imperial standards discovered recently near the Roman Forum and concludes with the fresco cycle representing a horse race in Kiev. This arrangement has its limits, naturally. For things have “biographies” and their durability often implies that they were used, not necessarily in the way their makers intended, long after they were made. But our entries account for the afterlife of things and show how early medieval people, and in some cases later people too, repurposed the things before they ended up inside glass cases, or on tourist itineraries, having finally become heritage. The “Vienna Dioscurides” (Thing 8) is a case in point, a book whose multiple users for over a millennium left traces of their engagement with its words, and images, on pages that sixth-century scribes first created. We have attempted to choose things we consider particularly interesting, worth knowing about, and representative of something else, especially of trends we see as significant to the history of the early medieval world; to us, all the things in these pages fuse matter and meaning usefully for any who want to understand the period 300–1000. Our choices are of course idiosyncratic, a mirror of our formations and outlooks, and many other ones could have been made. Though our assemblage of things contains several that are famous, and many that were associated with the topmost segments of postclassical societies, we purposefully included many humdrum things. We are aware that the material record is as tendentious, in some ways, as the written one, and reflects social hierarchies as much as texts do. But since neither early medieval people, nor modern archaeologists, completely controlled the things they deposited or unearthed, the material record can give a better random sampling of the texture of life, which as we know involved mostly ordinary people doing ordinary things, like combing their hair (Thing 22), or plowing their field (Thing 26), or attempting to bring home in a bottle some of the transcendence of the very special places they visited (Thing 19). As the first and last things in this collection already suggest, our thing-ly pursuits took us far afield, from the fringes of Ireland to the middle of Ukraine. We are pleased by this ecumenicism because we think that the early medieval period was less sundered than it was knitted together by its cultural, economic,\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 22\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:14 PM\n\nIntroduction\n\n23\n\nand social patterns. Certainly the division of the Roman Empire in this period, the ethnogenesis of competing barbarian peoples in Europe, and the development of an expansive Caliphate that swallowed the Sasanian polity whole, along with the juiciest slices of former Roman territory, introduced new boundaries, and divisions. Yet the prevalence of various types of monotheism, the reception and interpretation of classical Greek and Roman motifs and ideas, the continued circulation of goods like wine and marble, the predominance of courts and their culture, the political importance of military men, the ubiquitous agricultural practices, the persistent belief in the value of writing and texts, and many other characteristics besides, seem to us to create a vast, if vaguely bounded and unstable, culture zone in western Eurasia and the Mediterranean. For this reason, we gathered together “materials of history” from across the ample “world” that succeeded the ancient Mediterranean one. This is a didactic book. Though we hope more advanced readers will benefit from their encounter with some of our artifacts, the primary intended audience for our Things is beginners in the study of the early Middle Ages, and indeed of material culture. We think that the conjugation of the two areas of study usefully expands both and offers readers new ways to approach a period when texts mattered, but were relatively few, and when the human experience was wrapped up in the material world in challenging yet compelling ways.\n\nNotes 1.

Aristotle and high medieval philosophers instead distinguished between matter as potency and form as act, so while a mother provided the raw material of life, only the father was the agent in it.\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 25\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:15 PM\n\n26\n\nIntroduction\n\n41.

Squatriti (Ann Arbor, 2007), 288–326, develops the idea of premodern urban metabolism. English publications on this site are woefully lacking, but the museum guidebook was translated: D. Manacorda, Museo Nazionale Romano Crypta Balbi (Milan, 2000). Hodder, Entangled, 74, suggests that increased entanglement correlates with more meticulous waste removal, because the waste underfoot is more complex and hazardous. M.

Appadurai, “The Thing Itself,” Public Culture 18 (2006): 15–22, contains the thoughts on the field by an early adopter of the “material turn.” J. Bennett, Vibrant Matter. A Political Ecology of Things (Durham, 2010), stakes a claim for the vitality of things, and the moral-ecological benefits of thinking that way. B. Brown, Other Things (Chicago, 2015), includes Brown’s later thinking on “thingness” in literature and the arts, especially 1850–1950. B. Brown, “Thing Theory,” Critical Inquiry 28 (2001): 1–22, is virtually “the face that launched a thousand ships” of materiality studies in literary circles and also witty and insightful. G. Cross, Consumed by Nostalgia: Memory in the Age of Fast Capitalism (New York, 2015), offers an Americanist’s take on contemporary obsessions with old stuff. L. Daston, “Speechless,” in Things That Talk: Object Lessons from Art and Science, edited by L. Daston (New York, 2004), 9–24, lucidly introduces a collection of essays that presents things as knit together of matter and meaning, and able to teach history. M. Douglas and B. Isherwood, The World of Goods (New York, 1979), was a visionary (in hindsight) intervention in consumption theory by leading anthropologists. H. Hahn, “Words and Things,” in Materiality and Social Practice, edited by J. Maran and P. Stockhammer (Oxford, 2012), 4–12, locates the real “material turn” in the 1800s rise of consumer culture and describe the rise of material culture studies. C. Hesse, “The New Empiricism,” Cultural and Social History 1 (2004): 201–7, explains the intellectual genealogy of the “material turn” among historians. I. Hodder, Entangled: An Archaeology of the Relationships between Humans and Things (Chichester, 2012), argues things oblige people to take care of them, with the benefit of Hodder’s “deep-time” archaeological view of the process. I. Hodder, Studies in Human-Thing Entanglement (Creative Commons, 2016), complicates Hodder’s earlier work, but includes his German critics’ views.\n\n3050-2666f-Printer Pdf-Intro-r02.indd 29\n\n11/20/2018 12:35:16 PM\n\n30\n\nIntroduction\n\nT. Ingold, “Materials Against Materiality,” Archaeological Dialogues 14 (2007): 1–16 (with a response to criticisms on 31–38), suggests that the “material turn” forgot the materials that constitute things. J. Joy, “Reinvigorating the Object Biography,” World Archaeology 41 (2009): 540–66, tries to revamp the notion that artifacts have a life history. C. Knappett, An Archaeology of Interaction: Network Perspectives on Material Culture and Society (Oxford, 2011), thoughtfully applies ANT to archaeology. B. Latour, “Can We Get Our Materialism Back, Please?” Isis 98 (2007): 138–42, reminds readers of the difference between things and their scholarly representations. In Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor Network Theory (Oxford, 2005), Bruno Latour, one of the leading lights of French critical theory in the late twentieth century, articulates his ideas on the equality of people and things. T. LeCain, The Matter of History (Cambridge, 2017), seeks to convince historians that adopting a “new materialist” outlook is productive. B. Meyer and D. Houtman, “Material Religion—How Things Matter,” in Things: Religion and the Question of Materiality, edited by B. Meyer and D. Houtman (New York, 2012), 1–23, is a forthright confrontation of immaterial things’ materialization. D. Miller, Stuff (Cambridge, 2010), is an uncommonly lucid, philosophically sophisticated treatment of modern materiality by an anthropologist who formed this field of study. C. Renfrew, “Toward a Theory of Material Engagement,” in Rethinking Materiality, edited by D. De Marrais et al. (Cambridge, 2004), 23–31, attempts to theorize the oneness of human and thing. K. Robertson, “Medieval Materialism: A Manifesto,” Exemplaria 22 (2010): 99–118, explores medievalists’ investment in the “material turn.” D. Smail, “Neurohistory in Action: Hoarding and the Human Past,” Isis 105 (2014): 110–22, se"
