At the same time, evidence of the activity of the Nazi-trained commando unit which recently arrived in Gaza was seen in the forays against Israel installations and settlements as far from the Gaza frontier as 15 miles.\n\nMeanwhile, United Nations observers investigating a complaint by Israel that some Israel vehicles in the area near Auja el Hafir were shot at yesterday were told by a non-commissioned officer at an Egyptian military post in the area that his orders were to shoot at any vehicle in the demilitarized zone, even U. N. cars.\n\nYesterday the Egyptian-Israel Mixed Armistice Commission blamed Egypt for violating the armistice agreement with Israel in the Gaza area on the night of March 18 when two Egyptian soldiers crossed the armistice line from Gaza, planted a mine which exploded under an Israel Army staff car. Four Israel soldiers in the vehicle were wounded."
