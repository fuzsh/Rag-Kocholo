It uses the anthropogenic mobility of cultivated plants and other biological materials as a roadmap for understanding cross-cultural exchanges and the movements of people through space and time. It is my hope that this model of writing history, which uses diverse data sets and organic materials as proxies for human endeavors, will be applied to other temporal and spatial units. It is also my intention that this publication sustain and develop ongoing dialogues between practitioners and readers of the historical, social, and biological sciences. As a historian by training, it is also my desire that this book dissolves barriers within the field of ancient history. Too often the practice of ancient history is compartmentalized and parochialized along regional and linguistic lines. This not infrequently results in the failure to observe organic interconnections between societies, whether close together or far apart. I especially owe this book’s expansive vision of history to my undergraduate and postgraduate education at University College London. A book attempting a synthesis of this order naturally stands on the shoulders of giants, be they my own teachers and mentors or the many gurus through space and time with whom my only contact was through the printed word. I owe a particular debt of gratitude to Karen Radner (Munich) for her unstinting support as my primary PhD supervisor and her enthusiasm for all things Assyrian. I would also like to thank a number of brilliant educators and mentors I had the pleasure of interacting with at UCL, Oxford, and Yale-NUS College, including Amelie Kuhrt, Riet van Bremen, Eleanor Robson, Dorian Fuller, John Ma, Nicholas Purcell, David xi\n\nxii Preface and Acknowledgments\n\nd’Avray, Rajeev Patke, and Pattaratorn Chirapravati. For the many fond memories of conversational Sanskrit in both Heidelberg and Varanasi, a special thanks to the Heidelberg Sanskritists, especially Ute Hüsken and Sadananda Das. This book has also immensely benefited from the comments and assistance of its astute and kind reviewers, Robert Spengler (Jena) and Daniel Fuks (Cambridge). Many thanks to both of them. Any remaining errors of interpretation remain entirely my own. I should also like to thank Peter Palm (Berlin), who drew all the maps in this book on short notice. For trusting in the premise of the book and painlessly guiding the publication process, I am indebted to editor Eric Schmidt and editorial assistant LeKeisha Hughes. My gratitude is also due to the meticulous copyeditor Roy Sablosky, production editor Cindy Fulton, and others on the publishing team. I am especially grateful to the University of California Press for supporting the publishing process through its FirstGen program. Finally, a massive thank you to my parents, Indira and Muthukumaran; siblings, Rathika and Geetha; and friends for their unfailing encouragement.\n\nabbreviation s\n\nA S SY R IO L O G Y\n\nARM 21 BAM 2 BBS BdI Adab BE 9\n\nBM Cam CBS CT 2\n\nJ-M.

Half a millennium ago, the world not only looked different but also smelled and tasted different. Imagine Italy without tomatoes, Australia without cattle, Florida without oranges, India without chilies, France without tobacco, Colombia without coffee, and Switzerland without chocolate. The regime of diseases afflicting humans was also markedly different. The peoples of the New World had no experience of smallpox, the now-extinct dreadful pustular rash, and other viral and bacterial infections endemic to the Old World.1 The Afro-European colonization of the Americas brought little short of a revolution in the biosphere, irrevocably fusing the ecosystems, agricultural regimes, and dietary habits of the Old and New Worlds. Voyaging across the Atlantic from the New World were pumpkins, squashes, maize, peanuts, pineapples, guavas, cacao, chili peppers, cashews, cassavas, tomatoes, papayas, sunflowers, and potatoes, among other crops; while wheat, barley, rice, oats, sugarcane, coffee, bananas, citruses, and other Old World mainstays traveled to the Americas to become part of a labor-intensive, often slavery-based, cash-cropping system.2 The year 1492 inaugurated a world without biological borders—and, inadvertently, one of the worst ecological-demographic disasters. The influx of peoples, livestock, and food crops also opened a Pandora’s box of free-ranging weeds, pests, commensals, and microbes (and their attendant diseases) whose impact on the native 1.

But the Columbian Exchange is only the most recent and best known of a series of intercontinental biological dialogues involving floral and faunal exchanges. Both archeologists and historians have identified major thresholds in agricultural history, marked by the introduction of new crops and modifications in labor and capital inputs, and have described them as either a revolution or an exchange. The most fundamental “revolution” was of course the Neolithic Revolution, which witnessed the domestication of plants and animals and the related evolution of hunter-gatherers into sedentary farmers some 12,000 years ago in multiple regions of the Old World.4 The other notable prehistoric “revolution” was the Secondary Products Revolution, which entailed modifications in the management of domesticated animals to obtain secondary products like milk, cheese, yoghurt, ghee, wool, and leather—not to mention traction.5 More recent agrarian “revolutions” familiar to students of modern history include the eighteenth-century British Agricultural Revolution, a prelude to the Industrial Revolution, and the Green Revolution of the 1940s to 1960s; both led to higher crop yields and considerable demographic growth.6 In most cases, however, revolution is a misnomer, since these watersheds in agricultural history were often culminating points of a process long in the making or, as the archaeobotanist Marijke van der Veen puts it, a “time\n\n3. New World populations were not immune to a host of Old World diseases, including smallpox, measles, mumps, whooping cough, influenza, yellow fever, and malaria (McNeill 2014, 442). A genetic study by Llamas et al. 2016, based on mitochondrial DNA from the osteological remains of 92 preColumbian South American individuals, draws attention to mass mortality and extinction of lineages during the early phase of European colonization. 4. Barker 2006; Bellwood 2004; Childe 1936. On the issue of multiple centers and protracted processes of crop domestication, see Fuller, Willcox, and Allaby 2011; Meyer, Duval, and Jensen 2012. A DNA study of 44 Middle Eastern individuals dating between 12,000 and 1400 BCE demonstrates that the lineages of the earliest farming communities of the southern Levant and the Zagros were distinct, suggesting that the transition from hunter-gatherer to farmer developed independently in the two regions (Lazaridis et al. 2016). 5.

The Green Revolution (a term coined by officials at the US Agency for International Development) was marked by the introduction of high-yield, diseaseresistant, genetically modified crops to populous developing countries. The most conspicuous feature of more recent agrarian advances is the mechanization of farming, which led to the shift away from peasant agriculture to the agrarian capitalism of the present day. Mechanization freed labor for non-agricultural pursuits, which then, for the first time, became more significant than subsistence production in the local and global economy.\n\nIntroduction 3\n\nperiod when changes reached critical mass.”7 Admittedly, there are scholars who espouse more gradualist approaches, deploying the notion of a “revolution” as a metonym for a seminal transitional process.8 The post-Neolithic agricultural regime of the Old World was remarkably fluid, absorbing new cultivars from different biogeographic zones and adapting them to local social and cultural complexes.9 The histories of anthropogenic crop dispersals are, however, as much about resistance inspired by cultural preferences as they are about absorption. Exotica were fêted in some circles, but met in others with scorn and suspicion. In most cases, the process of crop nativization was longdrawn and dictated not only by climatic-environmental limitations but also, more crucially, by conservative agricultural practices and foodways. It took two centuries for early modern European farmers and consumers to be convinced that the New World tomato and potato were not toxic.10 Yet the very presence of new crops, and new varieties of old crops, indicates that some traditional agriculturists did experiment and innovate.11 Crop dispersals in the post-Neolithic world encompassed calorific staples like grains, pulses, and tubers; cash crops like fiber and oil plants, aromatics, and spices; ornamental plants; and non-staple calorific supplements like fruits and vegetables.12 Broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum), an East Asian grain, reached Europe by the late second millennium BCE through the mediation of Central Asian agropastoral communities.13 While Europe has a species of wild apple (Malus sylvestris), a species native to Central Asia (Malus sieversii) is the main contributor to the gene pool of the domesticated apple (Malus pumila).14 Other surprising Central and East Asian contributions to the European agricultural landscape of the Iron Age (c. 1200–550 BCE) include apricots (Prunus armeniaca), peaches (Prunus persica), hemp (Cannabis sativa), pistachios (Pistacia vera), and carrots (Daucus carota subsp. sativus).15 7.

In this book, I trace the origins of and examine one pivotal trajectory within the dynamic and multidirectional Old World exchanges of crops and fauna. The Indian subcontinent encompasses a great variety of ecosystems and is extraordinarily diverse agriculturally, with native crops being supplemented by cultivars from Africa, the Middle East, and Central, East, and Southeast Asia. It is specifically the transmission of crops and fauna of tropical and subtropical Asian origin from the Indian subcontinent to the Middle East and the Mediterranean which the archaeologist Andrew Sherratt describes as the “most important movement of crops before the Columbian Exchange.”19 The region of origin for the crops under consideration in this book falls in the tropical and subtropical zone extending between latitude 28° N and 9° S from Papua New Guinea to northwestern India. Broadly speaking, these crops are frost and drought intolerant and hence are predominantly summer irrigated cultivars in the Middle East and the Mediterranean. Tropical and subtropical South and Southeast Asian crops collectively constitute the single “largest group of introduced aliens” in the Middle East and the Mediterranean.20 This biological diffusion was responsible for the creation of a “unified ecological contact zone” of overlapping sets of cultivars and livestock across the southern Eurasian landmass.21 The growing agro-ecological coherence of AfroEurasia in turn abetted processes of cultural coalescence and facilitated the spread of ideas and technologies. The movement of crops from India to the Middle East and the Mediterranean has been variously styled in the scholarly literature depending on the agency, 16.

The historian Andrew Watson speaks of this exchange as an Arab Agricultural Revolution or the Medieval Green Revolution (c. 700–1100 CE).22 The archaeologist Andrew Sherratt opts for a more neutral “trans-Eurasian exchange” but elsewhere describes the same process as part of the “orientalization” of the Mediterranean.23 John McNeill, a global historian, privileges the maritime routes across the Indian Ocean and names it the Monsoon Exchange.24 Lynda Shaffer, another global historian, situates the crop exchange within a broader exchange of ideas and technology and describes it as the “southernization” of the Northern Hemisphere.25 In terms of chronology, scholarship has mostly failed to appreciate the lengthy process of crop transfers and has unhelpfully attributed agency to one or more political actors, including the Romans, the Sasanian Persians, and the medieval Arabs.26 But this book will show that South Asian crop movements to the Middle East and the Mediterranean extend back to the Bronze Age horizon, and no single political actor can be credited with initiating and sustaining this process. The “tropical turn” of the Middle East and Mediterranean under consideration here first entered scholarly purview with Andrew Watson’s groundbreaking 1974 article, “The Arab Agricultural Revolution and Its Diffusion.” This was followed by another article, “A Medieval Green Revolution” (1981), and finally a monograph, Agricultural Innovation in the Early Islamic World: The Diffusion of Crops and Farming Techniques (1983). In these works, Watson argued for an agricultural “revolution” in the early Islamic Middle East and the Mediterranean (c. 700–1100 CE) fostered by the diffusion of new Indian crops and improved farming techniques. The tropical South Asian summer crop package discussed by Watson included rice, sorghum, durum wheat, sugarcane, cotton, sour orange, lemon, lime, pomelo, banana, coconut, watermelon, spinach, artichoke, taro, eggplant, and mango. Watson identified the cosmopolitan, Islamicate populations of the Middle East and the Mediterranean as the principal agents in this biodiffusion. In Boserupian fashion, he held that the privatized labor-intensive farming of the Islamic lands, which involved equitable distribution of water, enriched irrigation methods (extensive use of water-lifting devices, underground canals, dams, and so on), crop rotation, and greater application of fertilizer, enabled greater crop yields, demographic expansion, and urban development. But Watson’s work is plagued by what one reviewer calls a “profound lack of interest in the pre-Islamic landscape and a host of flawed assumptions.”27 Most of 22. Watson 1974, 1981, 1983. 23.

The notion that tropical South Asian crops were an “exogenous deus ex machina to kick-start change” in hitherto static Middle Eastern and Mediterranean economies is misleading.30 The diffusion of South Asian flora and fauna to the Middle East and beyond was not a linear, uninterrupted event but an episodic process with its roots in the interconnected world of the Late Bronze Age. While Watson’s study provides the stimulus for thinking about biological diffusions in the Old World, the so-called Arab Agricultural Revolution is far older than supposed and a much more gradual process. SCOPE AND LIMITS\n\nThis book, in essence, offers an ecological reading of long-distance connectivity in the ancient world by investigating tropical and subtropical botanical transfers via maritime and overland routes, from South Asia to the Middle East and the Mediterranean, with the aim of assessing the motivations behind and impact of this phenomenon on ancient Middle Eastern and Mediterranean societies. The discussion of individual crops will be prefaced by a detailed and much-needed sketch of the Middle East and the Mediterranean’s relations with South Asia from prehistory to the late centuries BCE. This longue durée narrative of interactions between the Middle East, the Mediterranean, and South Asia, whose full contours have yet to be appreciated by ancient historians and archaeologists alike, forms an essential backdrop to both early and later crop movements. The textual and archaeological materials assembled in this book have yielded evidence for the introduction and naturalization of several South Asian cultivars in the ancient Middle East and the Mediterranean. The strategy employed here has been to maximize the available evidence while offering a selection of different 28. While Watson’s case for the introduction of new tropical crops in the Middle East and the Mediterranean during the early centuries of Islam has been shown to be an invalid causal association (Decker 2009; Kelley 2019; King 2015; Ruas et al. 2015; Samuel 2001, 418–22), there are many scholars who continue to cite his conclusions, albeit with modifications (e.g., Amar and Lev 2017, 49–53; Fuks, Amichay, and Weiss 2020; McNeill 2014, 439; Mears 2011, 153; Zohary 1998). See Squatriti 2014 for a discussion of the lasting influence of the “Watson thesis” on historical studies and other academic disciplines. There have, however, been strong critics of the “Watson thesis” from its inception. See Johns 1984 and Aubaile-Sallenave 1984 for early critiques of Watson’s work which argue that it is shoddy in the details. 29.

Of course a good number of these plants had non-comestible functions as well. And this list of new crops is far from exhaustive. A variety of Indian millet, sugarcane, eggplant, sebesten plum, and sambac jasmine are known from pre-Islamic Middle Eastern and Mediterranean contexts, but the textual and archaeological evidence for their dispersal and cultivation is meager.31 Yet crop transfers that were seemingly insignificant in their earliest phases could hold great potential in the future, as is the case with sugarcane. As our focus is strictly on economic plants from tropical Asia which were cultivated in the ancient Middle East and the Mediterranean, the survey excludes tropical species which were available as long-distance commodities but not taken into cultivation. Dozens of spices, for instance, have been moving between South Asia, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean throughout the ages, among them economically important ones like black pepper, ginger, cardamom, cinnamon, and cassia. These will not be discussed in any detail as they deserve a separate treatment of their own. Heading in the opposite direction, Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cultivars, most prominently barley and wheat, were also transmitted to South Asia in antiquity.32 A number of commonly used spice and aromatic plants in South Asia, including coriander, cumin, black cumin, ajwain, fenugreek, saffron, marjoram, and licorice, originate in temperate zones west of the Indian subcontinent.33 Although coriander (Coriandrum sativum), a native of the Middle East, was already identified as seeds in a late-third-millennium BCE context in Miri Qalat in Pakistani Baluchistan, its widespread use in South Asia is probably due to culinary exchanges with the Achaemenid Empire in the first millennium BCE.34 This is suggested by the use of an Akkadian or Aramaic loanword for the plant in Sanskrit: kustumburu (Akkadian kusibirru, Aramaic kusbara).35 Similarly, almonds, walnuts, pomegranates, and apples are not native to the Indian subcontinent but derive from Central Asia and the Middle East.36 Asafoetida (Ferula asafoetida), whose 31.

While these crop movements in the reverse direction shared the same routes and mechanisms with the tropical Asian crops moving to temperate zones, the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean contribution to South Asian agriculture, diet, and culture is beyond the scope of the present book. Like the Columbian Exchange, the tropical “Indian” exchange entailed the transfer of human populations, animals, commensals, pests, microbes, and diseases which left an irrevocable ecological imprint on host landscapes in the Middle East and the Mediterranean. The animals transmitted to the Middle East and the Mediterranean from South and Southeast Asia included both domesticates and exotica: chickens, peafowl, parakeets, Asian elephants, tigers, mongooses, langurs, water buffaloes, caprids, and even cat and dog breeds.38 The movement of fauna had a significant impact on agricultural practice, communications, warfare, and leisurely pursuits. The westward dispersal of chickens (figures 1 and 2) ensured that egg consumption could become regular rather than seasonal as is generally the case with eggs produced by geese and ducks.39 But calorific needs were not the only motivation for the chicken’s westward march. In classical Greece, cockerels appear as important courtship gifts in pederastic relationships and were intimately connected to one of the most common modes of gambling across the Old World: cockfighting.40 Pests and commensals trailing humans, animals, and plants along Indian Ocean routes included the black rat (Rattus rattus), house mouse (Mus musculus), Asian house shrew (Suncus murinus), house crow (Corvus splendens), gecko (Hemidactylus spp.), and a great variety of insects.41 Trade in grain and farinaceous products 37.

The wild red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) is the main contributor to the domesticated chicken’s gene pool. The native habitat of this species stretches from northeastern India to southern China and Southeast Asia. Introgression with another species of wild fowl in South Asia, the gray junglefowl (Gallus sonneratii), was responsible for the yellow-legged feature of many varieties of modern chicken. Chickens were known in the Middle East from the mid-to-late second millennium BCE on but only became common in the first millennium BCE.

It may be wise to embrace another caveat at this juncture. While I do not deny the importance of the “tropical turn” for the Middle East and the Mediterranean, the exceptionality of this exchange should not be exaggerated. The “Indian” tropical bioexchange stands out from other early crop movements not only on account of its wide geographical scope and diverse repertoire of calorifically and culturally significant crops but also because the cultures which were directly involved have bequeathed us written records, lending greater visibility to agrarian changes here compared to similar processes elsewhere in the Afro-Eurasian landmass. The stories of the latter have to be chronicled by archaeologists rather than historians. The only other ancient transcontinental Eurasian bioexchange with a comparable impression on documentary sources is perhaps the exchange of crops along the maritime and terrestrial Silk Roads between China and Central, West, South, and Southeast Asia between the Han and Tang dynasties (second century BCE to ninth century CE).45 S O U R C E S A N D M E T HO D S\n\nOwing to the wide spatial and temporal scope of the present study, the sources consulted here appear in a range of genres and in several ancient languages, including Sumerian, Akkadian, Elamite, Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, and the 42.

References to plants and their byproducts in ancient texts are often incidental to the work’s purpose, whether literary, spiritual, pharmacological, geographical, administrative, fiscal, or otherwise. While the diversity of sources reflects the multiplicity of applications for botanical materials, the cultivation context and modes of transmission are often invisibilized by all-too-casual references. The piecemeal nature of the surviving data is, however, compensated for by a cumulative reading of the textual sources. The documentary sources in Sumerian, Akkadian, and Elamite, preserved on clay tablets in the cuneiform script, have rarely been privileged in discussions of ancient crop translocations despite the wealth of references to wild and cultivated plants in these languages. This hesitation is a result of the imprecise identification of ancient plant names with modern botanical equivalents, especially in cases where there are no clear lexical cognates in other surviving languages.46 Even where cognates are present in related and neighboring languages, the sheer volatility of ancient naming conventions means that there can be no certainty in the identification of flora and fauna on the basis of textual data alone. The same plant and its constituent parts may go by several names within the same language. There may also be diachronic semantic shifts and expansion prompted by loss of familiarity or the usage of other plant species with similar morphologies or ethnobotanical applications. Furthermore, contextual data by way of extensive descriptions is often wanting in Mesopotamian contexts, in part due to the laconic nature of ancient scholarship on clay tablets. Some cuneiform texts, however, do afford brief notes on morphological features of plants and their medical applications.47 From the late second millennium BCE on, there was also a rudimentary attempt to systematize botanical and pharmaceutical knowledge in scholarly compendia and annotated lexical series.48 At present, most plant names in cuneiform records still merit generic descriptors like “a medicinal plant” or “a briar” in cautious philological studies, and only around sixty plants can be matched with modern botanical equivalents with any degree of certainty.49 While Greco-Roman records offer more substantial descriptions of plants, it must be borne in mind that not all authors saw the plant being described and some authors plagiarized and garbled older accounts, with the result that little useful information on the contemporary cultivation status of the plant can be extracted.

Take for example the word malum in Latin, a prodigiously well-documented ancient language. While malum is regularly translated as “apple,” its semantic field encompasses a whole range of fleshy arboreal fruits like peaches, quinces, pomegranates, and citruses. In light of the high mutability of botanical nomenclature in antiquity, the fields of archaeobotany and plant genetics are therefore of great importance in assessing interpretations of plant names in textual sources. As new crops fall outside the traditional taxation and tithing regimes, their frequency in administrative documents is also expected to be low or zero. In such instances, the archaeobotanical evidence, which typically appears as seeds, bolls, charcoal, plant impressions, pollen, starch granules, phytoliths (silica deposits in plant cells), or even whole desiccated fruits, is indispensable in understanding the spatial and chronological distribution of new cultivars.54 But the archaeobotanical record is far from exhaustive, and some countries (like Egypt, Israel, Italy, and Greece) have benefited from more extensive sampling of archaeological plant remains compared to their neighbors in the Middle East and the Mediterranean. Botanical remains are also subject to the fortuitous coincidence of deposition and preservation. The procurement, processing, consumption, and disposal practices of ancient peoples are crucial in determining what survives in the first place. Archaeobotanical assemblages are differentially affected by climate, soil types, deposition conditions, and other taphonomic processes like charring, desiccation, 50.

Not all organic materials survive well in the archaeological record. The fibers of cotton, one of the cultivars under consideration in this book, are largely composed of cellulose, which is easily degraded by cellulolytic microorganisms. Fleshy fruits which are not subject to charring rarely endure the passage of time, while others, like leafy vegetables, leave almost no macro-remains. This is also the case for most starchy tuberous crops, although the scrutiny of microfossil remains like charred parenchymatous tissue (soft “filler” tissue) and starch grains has facilitated their identification. Further avenues for research on ancient human diets and agricultural regimes are afforded by biomolecular studies on human, faunal, and plant remains, including ancient DNA, proteomic, lipid, and stable isotope analyses.55 The surfaces of ancient cooking, storage, and serving wares offer ample opportunities for residue analysis of biochemical compounds of botanical origin. Palaeoentomological records, especially those concerning invasive agricultural pests, can serve as proxies for anthropic crop movements. But the application of scientific methods in determining ancient organic remains has not been without challenges. The study of ancient proteins, for example, has been stymied by chemical degradation and contamination of samples, leading to polarizing, if not outlandish, results in some cases.56 Nonetheless, the convergence of diverse data sets remains the only viable option for establishing the stability and comparability of botanical nomenclature in a field where identifications of botanical materials solely on the basis of ancient textual materials can be highly contentious. Such an integrated approach also provides complementary data on cultivation contexts and modes of transmission which may not be explicit in textual sources.\n\n55.

The diversity of terrestrial and maritime routes, middlemen, and centers of exchange connecting South Asia, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean matches the complex peregrinations of individual crops. The arrival of a new crop was, in most cases, preceded by trade in related botanical produce.1 Increasing demand eventually made it profitable to replace imports with local cultivation. Other cases of crop introductions may be altogether inadvertent: piggybacking as part of a merchant’s subsistence needs before being bartered for local foods at the end destination. Traders apart, the foodways of porters, guides, nomads, deportees, refugees, mercenaries, fisherfolk, and other mobile communities would have been equally crucial in the spread of cultivated crops. To understand how the societies of the Middle East and the Mediterranean were transformed by exchange networks, commercial or otherwise, it is necessary to sketch a longue durée history of “Middle Asian” mobility across land and sea, from its prehistoric beginnings to the late centuries BCE. I have deliberately minimized any discussion of botanical translocations in this chapter, since they occupy the rest of the book. Our primary purpose in this chapter is to establish 1. Sherratt 1999, 19.\n\n15\n\n16 The Historical Context\n\nbeyond doubt that there were impactful linkages, from distant antiquity, between South Asia, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean. R O U T E S A N D M O D E S O F T R A N SP O RTAT IO N\n\nThe origins of east–west connectivity in the Eurasian landmass lie in the distant prehistoric horizon. The earliest transactional networks between South Asia and the Middle East, archaeologically discernible at least by the fourth millennium BCE, were little more than unorganized and random down-the-line transmissions of small portable goods and perishables like precious and semiprecious stones, shells, resins, reeds, hides, and cured foods, and finished crafts like baskets and stone and wood artifacts.2 These local and regional circulations of goods involved both mobile pastoralists and settled communities.3 Local deficiencies in vital raw materials probably played a key role in stimulating trade in bulky commodities over longer distances. The scarcity of materials like metal, timber, and stone in southern Mesopotamia made connectivity across the Persian Gulf and the Iranian plateau a recurring structural feature of the region’s historical development.4 In the earliest phases, no single agency shaped the contours of long-distance connections since there were no professional merchants responding to distant demand with premeditated commercial strategies. In the absence of paved roads and imperial highways, natural impediments to communication in the form of mountains and deserts funneled the prehistoric trickle of long-distance trade into several distinct routes, which have remained in constant use ever since. The northerly overland route, also known as the Great Khurāsān Road, led from the western Himalayas, stretched over the length of the Iranian plateau, bypassing its arid interior (the deserts of Dašt-e Kavīr and Dašt-e Lūt), and skirted the southern subtropical shores of the Caspian Sea before descending onto the Mesopotamian lowlands through the Hamadan-KermanshahBaghdad corridor (map 1). This route was, in later times, a significant arm of the so-called Silk Roads which connected East Asia with the Mediterranean. The southerly overland route, from the lower Indus Valley through the modern Iranian provinces of Baluchistan, Sistan, and Kerman, was less favorable to caravans owing to drier and harsher climatic conditions. Alexander the Great’s ill-fated return to Babylon from India across the Gedrosian desert (southern Baluchistan) in the late fourth century BCE exposes the perils of this route for large-scale convoys.5 But this route intersected at various points with the maritime coasting route 2.

It was, after all, a Gedrosian navigator named Hydrakes who guided Alexander’s fleet to Karmania (the Iranian provinces of Kerman and Hormozgan).6 A Persepolis Fortification tablet (c. 500 BCE) attesting to the travel of a relatively large party of fifty, possibly Indian, nobles from Susa to India through Karmania also raises the possibility that maritime and overland routes coincided in southern Iran wherever terrestrial travel became too hostile for pedestrians and pack animals alike.7 Both overland routes should not, however, be mistaken for single thoroughfares, as lesser riverine routes, side roads, and seasonal pastoral tracks offered the prospect of alternative journeys. Many of these lesser routes remain, for the most part, imperceptible to the modern observer, as premodern roads were determined by local perceptions of the environment, not by physical features alone.8 Pack animals like zebu cattle, Bactrian camels, donkeys, and horses were crucial for longdistance movement across the Iranian plateau. Before the widespread use of the horse and the donkey, camels and zebu cattle, a domesticate of northwestern India, were the chief pack animals between South Asia and eastern Iran.9 A pair of zebu cattle could pull a load of up to nine hundred kilograms over rough terrain and traverse forty kilometers in about ten hours.10 Depictions of zebu cattle occur in Mesopotamian and west Iranian contexts by the late fourth millennium, and osteological remains of zebu cattle are attested as far west as Shahr-i Sokhta in Sistan (Iran) by the early third millennium BCE.11 By the late third millennium BCE, if not slightly earlier, the two-humped Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) was to become the single most important mover of trade and communications along the plateau routes, especially across terrain that was difficult for wheeled transport. The Persian poet Saʻdī (thirteenth century CE) recalls the hardiness of the camel over that of the horse: “To walk and then sit is better than to run and then collapse. . . . An Arabian steed gallops in haste but a camel proceeds slowly night and day.”12 The late antique Greek author Didymus (fourth or fifth century CE) even remarks that he saw Bactrian camels “competing alongside horses and winning (in races).”13 Not only could Bactrian camels endure extremes of temperature (–40 to +40 °C), their individual load-bearing abilities over arid terrain (250 kilograms) rendered them superior to the ancient bullock and donkey carts.14\n\n6.

The earliest mention of the Bactrian camel is in an Early Dynastic list of animals from Šuruppak. While the Sumerian term amsi normally denotes an elephant, bilingual Sumerian-Akkadian lexical texts equate the compound form of the Sumerian word amsi (e.g., amsikurra, amsiḫ arran) with the Akkadian for camel (ibilu).

The fifth-century BCE Greek historian Herodotus esteems the royal Persian horse-mounted couriers as the fastest messengers known 23. Schmitt 2002b.

The Assyrian Empire’s expansion into the Zagros region of western Iran from the late ninth century BCE on was prompted, in particular, by the need to acquire finely bred horses for the army.27 Unlike other tributaries, who paid in metal, the Zagrosian tribute to Assyria came in the form of horses. In many ways, the horse complemented rather than competed with the older modes of transportation. Unlike its northern cousin, the dromedary or one-humped camel was domesticated for milk, meat, and traction much later, in late-second-millennium BCE southeastern Arabia. It substantially enhanced connectivity across the terrae steriles of the Arabian Peninsula and, by the early first millennium BCE, in the Levant as well.28 It is around the same time that the Arabian frankincense and myrrh trade takes off spectacularly, and with it the aromatics and precious stones received from the wider Indian Ocean world.29 Some of the cultivars discussed in this book, like the sacred lotus and taro, could well have arrived in Egypt and the Mediterranean via South Arabian–Red Sea routes, since the evidence for their presence in the Persian Gulf and Mesopotamia is woefully thin. THE OCEAN\n\nThe relative quiet of the Atlantic and the Pacific in early human history presents a dramatic contrast to the constancy, volume, and vibrancy of human activity in the Indian Ocean.30 The historian Felipe Fernández-Armesto remarks that the “precocity of the Indian Ocean as a zone of long-distance navigation and cultural exchange is one of the glaring facts of history: enormously important and puzzling, when you come to think about it, yet hardly remarked, much less explained, in the existing literature.”31 Trans-oceanic navigation and networking was to a great degree born and perfected in the Indian Ocean theatre. The volume of travel and the distances traveled by peoples, commodities, and ideas over this stretch of water in the prehistoric and early historic periods dwarfed those of other water bodies whose edges were colonized by human settlers. Monsoonal winds—seasonally reversing airstreams generated by the differential heating of land and sea during summer and winter—were the most important movers of long-distance trade in the Indian Ocean and defined the contours of interactive spaces (map 2). The northeasterly winds prevailing in winter above the equator 26. Hdt. VIII.98. On the Persian couriers, see Briant 2002, 369–71. 27. Radner 2003, 2013. 28.

The role of East Africa in the Bronze Age Indian Ocean interactive sphere is still unclear, although the spread of tropical African crops to India between the late third and early second millennia BCE suggests early trans-oceanic contacts. Whether this contact was direct or mediated by communities along the South and East Arabian littoral is still a moot point, as African crops transmitted to India have not been recovered in early Arabian archaeological sites (Boivin, Blench, and Fuller 2009, 266; Boivin and Fuller 2009, 114, 165–66). Copal, a hardened tree resin from East Africa (Zanzibar, Mozambique, and Madagascar), was found in a pendant in a mid-third-millennium context at Eshnunna (Tell Asmar) in Mesopotamia (Meyer et al. 1991). African copal may have reached Mesopotamia via Arabian intermediaries, lending support to the hypothesis that peninsular Arabia mediated Mesopotamian and Indian interactions with East Africa. 36.

Notwithstanding the perennial risks of shipwreck, freshwater shortage, and piracy, maritime transportation remained superior to terrestrial travel for much of antiquity. A caravan journey from Afghanistan to Mesopotamia could take over three months.43 In contrast, vessels plying the routes between the Indus and the Straits of Hormuz could make it in less than a month.44 T H E F O U RT H T O E A R LY T H I R D M I L L E N N I UM B C E : T H E L A P I S L A Z U L I R OA D S\n\nThe routes between the Indo-Iranian borderlands and the Middle East might well be dubbed the Lapis Lazuli Roads, as that azure stone, exclusively derived from eastern sources, remains the single most diagnostic feature of the east–west trade in archaeological assemblages in both early and later phases.45 Owing to the specific geological conditions under which lapis lazuli can be formed, its natural geographical distribution is extremely narrow. Geological surveys have established four main sources for lapis lazuli in the Old World, all of which lie east of Iran: Badakhšan in eastern Afghanistan, Iškašim in the Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan, the Lake Baikal region in Siberia, and the Mogok region of Upper Myanmar (Burma).46 While Iškašim is only about 130 kilometers northeast of Badakhšan, its lapis lazuli deposits are located on a precipitous cliff face 4,600 meters in elevation, making it extremely unlikely that this site was exploited in antiquity.47 The deposits in Siberia, bordering a glacier at 5,029 meters in altitude, are equally remote.48 The famed Mogok Stone Tract in Upper Myanmar, rich in jade, gold, placer diamonds, sapphires, and above all rubies, is also known to produce lapis lazuli, but it is unclear whether lapis lazuli from Mogok was mined and traded westward in antiquity.49 This makes the deposits in the mountains of Badakhšan, along the upper reaches of the Kokcha in eastern Afghanistan, the most feasible source of lapis lazuli in antiquity and certainly the main source for regions immediately to the west of Afghanistan. The Badakhšan deposits are themselves hard to reach, with the four known mines (Sar-i Sang, Chilmak, Stromby, and Robat-i Paskaran) ranging in altitude between 1,800 and 5,000 meters.50 Sar-i Sang (map 3), the most productive and still-active 43.

In Sumerian, the sky, certain plants, and even the beards of men were described as being the color of lapis lazuli.57 Lapis lazuli certainly did not travel alone but was accompanied by a host of other perishable and non-perishable commodities, the former having left scarce archaeological traces. Among the raw materials coming from the east, tin, the most common alloying agent in bronze, was undoubtedly a vital import. The most important sources of tin for the Middle East and the eastern Mediterranean are beyond the Iranian plateau, in southern Central Asia (eastern Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan) and northwest India (the Aravalli mountains).58 Minor tin deposits are also found closer to Mesopotamia, in the central Zagros region of western Iran (Deh Hossein, Sanandaj-Sirjan zone) and in the Helmand basin of Sistan, in eastern Iran (Chah Kalapi, Shahkuh, and Chah Ruh).59 Tin-bronzes are first attested in small quantities in Mesopotamia (Tepe Gawra, Kish, Ur, Tell Judeidah) and Iran 51.

This period also marks the eastward expansion of a southwest-Iranian material culture termed Proto-Elamite (c. 3100–2900 BCE). This cultural phenomenon, perhaps linked to the spread of an ethno-linguistic group, is marked by the adoption of distinctive ceramic forms (bevel-rim bowls, nose-lugged bichrome jars), the use of seals, and inscribed tablets in the Proto-Elamite script.62 Proto-Elamite tablets have been found in Kerman (Tepe Yahya), several sites on the central Iranian plateau (Qazvin, Kashan, the Tehran plains), and as far east as Sistan (Shahr-i Sokhta), while the pottery types (especially bevel-rim bowls) extend further east into Pakistani Baluchistan.63 While the exact impetus behind the expansion of Proto-Elamite culture across the Iranian plateau remains unclear, genetic and linguistic studies which provide evidence for wide-ranging east–west population movements in prehistoric and historic periods suggest that a similar population-language-culture dispersal may be at work here.64 In this regard, one study of DNA sequences from ancient osteological remains in the Middle Euphrates Valley has yielded evidence of a genetic link between Bronze Age populations of the Middle East and those of modern South Asia. The molecular biologist Henryk Witas and colleagues examined mitochondrial DNA sequences extracted from the dental remains of four individuals, two from Early (c. 2650–2450 BCE) and Middle (2200–1900 BCE) Bronze Age Terqa in Syria and two from Roman (200–300 CE) and late antique (500–700 CE) Tell Masaikh in Syria.65 All four individuals carried mitochondrial DNA haplotypes belonging to the M4b1, M49, and/or M61 haplogroups, which are absent in modern Syria but found in Trans-Himalayan and South Asian populations. Haplogroup M lineages are believed to have diversified in the Indian subcontinent between 5,800 and 2,500 years ago.66 The presence of a distinctive South Asian genetic signature in the Middle Euphrates Valley indicates an early (pre-2500 BCE) population movement from the 60.

The alternative suggestion of Witas and colleagues, that this might represent itinerant merchants, is untenable because direct Indo-Mesopotamian trade relations are only a feature of the late third millennium BCE, and even then it is extremely unlikely that South Asian merchants ventured as far inland as the Middle Euphrates Valley. The genetic evidence for an early migration from the east inevitably implicates itself with the much-disputed origins of the Sumerian-speaking peoples of southern Mesopotamia.67 Odontometric analyses of individuals from Chalcolithic (Eridu, Tell al-’Ubaid) and Bronze Age (Ur) sites in southern Mesopotamia have previously been used to suggest Sumerian affinities with Indian populations.68 In this regard, it has been proposed that the Sumerian language itself is a sort of coastal creole, including, among other contributors, the languages spoken by the peoples of coastal Iran and the Indus Valley.69 Although there is no scholarly consensus on Sumerian origins or the affiliations of the language, the bioarchaeologist Arkadiusz Sołtysiak notes that the South Asian origin theory for Sumerian-speakers is “relatively better grounded, although no author [has] tested it in [a] proper way and it still remains only a speculation.”70 The cuneiformist Julian Reade, remarking on the unfamiliarity of India to scholars of the ancient Middle East, pithily notes that the “Indian precedence over Early Dynastic Mesopotamia introduced a new and disturbing element into ancient history.”71 The Biblical baggage aside, there remains a strong historiographical bias in approaching the history of the ancient Middle East from the point of view of the modern West, both conceptually and geographically. This has even extended to the appropriation of the pre-Islamic Middle East as the “cradle of Western civilization.”72 The future work of scholars familiar with the archaeological, historical, and linguistic setting of regions to the east and north of the Middle East will hopefully promote more holistic readings of the ancient Middle East, as well as elucidate contentious issues like the Sumerian question and its alleged eastern associations. Whatever the origins of the Sumerian peoples, the archaeological and genetic data unmistakably indicate strong links between Mesopotamia and populations in the east. The earliest Sumerian polities, in particular the city of Uruk, may have even sponsored long-distance trading and diplomatic ventures in the early third millennium BCE, if later literary materials are to be believed.73 Sumerian literary texts of the late third and early second millennium speak of Uruk’s interactions 67.

While the Mesopotamian references to Aratta are generic and mythic, it is not impossible that they reflect a topographic reality. T H E L AT E T H I R D T O E A R LY SE C O N D M I L L E N N I UM : T H E M I D D L E A SIA N I N T E R AC T IO N SP H E R E\n\nWhile the expansion of Proto-Elamite culture, east–west population movements, the widespread use of lapis lazuli along the Nile–Indus corridor, and the Sumerian legends about the eastern country of Aratta already suggest some degree of connectivity across the Iranian plateau in the late fourth and early third millennium, the earliest historically verifiable organized trade between India and the Middle East belongs to the late third millennium BCE. The Harappan civilization of northwest India, stretching from the Makran coast in the west to the upper Ganga-Yamuna Doab in the East and southward into Gujarat; the Sumerian and Akkadian-speaking populations of southern Mesopotamia; and polities in Oman (Magan), eastern Arabia (Dilmun), and Iran (especially Elam in Khuzestan, Marḫ aši in Kerman, and Šimaški in the central Iranian plateau) were the key players in the creation of an intensively interactive zone between the late third and early second millennium BCE.76 In Mesopotamian chronology this extends from the Early Dynastic III to the Old Babylonian period. The Harappan archaeologist Gregory Possehl has fruitfully described this interactive zone as the “Middle Asian interaction sphere,” whose frontiers extended from southern Central Asia in the north to the Arabian Peninsula in the south and from the Mediterranean in the west to the Indian subcontinent in the east.77\n\n74.

Note also other eastern Iranian and South-Central Asian polities mentioned in Mesopotamian sources: Tukriš, which is probably to be identified with the archaeological culture termed the BactriaMargiana Archaeological Complex, covering the territories of modern-day northern Afghanistan, southern Uzbekistan, and eastern Turkmenistan; and Kupin, which was probably somewhere in Baluchistan (Steinkeller 2014, 693, 701–04). 77. Possehl 1996, 2002.\n\n32 The Historical Context\n\nHarappan artifacts in Mesopotamia, Iran, and the Persian Gulf are the main witnesses for the vibrant trade links between India and the Middle East in this period.78 Textual references to Meluḫ ḫ a, the Sumerian-Akkadian designation for the Harappan civilization and its peoples in northwest India, represent the other key source for understanding early trade and political links.79 There is no doubt in the identification of Meluḫ ḫ a with the Harappan realm, since it is described in Mesopotamian texts as the source of unmistakably South Asian articles like peacocks, carnelian, and sissoo wood. Furthermore, the few Meluḫ ḫ an loanwords in Sumerian and Akkadian have some resonances with Indic, particularly Dravidian, languages.80 The rarity of Mesopotamian artifacts in India and the extensive distribution of Indus artifacts in the Persian Gulf indicate that Mesopotamian traders were largely uninvolved in sailing to India.81 The newfound maritime confidence of the Harappans from c. 2500 BCE on expressed itself in the founding of trading enclaves on the southern Iranian coast (Sutkagen-dor, Sotka Koh), in Oman (Ra’s al-Jinz, Ra’s al-Hadd, Hili, Maysar), in Bahrain and eastern Arabia (Saar, Ras al-Qala), and perhaps even in southern Mesopotamia.82 The presence of distinctive Indus cooking and serving vessels alongside personal adornments like shell bangles and toys at these “colony” sites suggests that Harappan merchants were accompanied by their womenfolk and children, a rare phenomenon in ancient trade.83 Harappan trade commodities included raw and finished beads of semiprecious stones (lapis lazuli, carnelian, chalcedony, heliotrope), shell artifacts (Turbinella pyrum, etc.), ivory, animal figurines, gold, and a variety of timbers (sissoo, ebony, teak).84 Textiles almost certainly formed an important element of exchange, although they are largely invisible in the archaeological record, as are ephemeral agricultural products like wine, dates, ghee, honey, reeds, and cured foods, which are thought to have filled the diagnostic Harappan black-slipped amphora-like jars found across the Persian Gulf.85 The late-third-millennium horizon also saw the introduction of at least one South Asian cultivar and a few animals to the Middle East along east–west trading routes.

Compare, for instance, the Old Assyrian trade network in Anatolia, in which Assyrian merchants left their wives in Aššur to manage their households and, on occasion, maintained secondary local wives in Anatolia. A few Assyrian women did, however, accompany their husbands on the trip to Anatolia (Heffron 2017; Michel 2010, 2014). 84. Morello 2014, 541–43; Potts 1993; Ratnagar 2004; Reade 2001, 26–28. 85.

A few Indian animals, including water buffaloes, zebu cattle, peacocks, and monkeys, were also introduced into Mesopotamia. The Curse of Agade, a Sumerian composition of the Ur III or early Old Babylonian period (late third to early second millennium BCE), describes the former capital Agade as a place where the “monkey, mighty elephant, water buffalo (and) beasts of exotic lands rub shoulders in the broad streets.”89 The water buffalo (Sumerian abzaza) is well known from seals of the Sargonic period, including those belonging to royalty, like Tar’amAgade, the daughter of king Naram-Sin, and high administrative officials, like the scribes of the king Šarkališarri and Enheduanna, the high priestess of the moongod Nanna at Ur.90 The water buffalo’s disappearance in later periods suggests that there were never many buffaloes imported from India to begin with. It is not clear whether the water buffalo was bred for ornamental and ritual purposes or if it had an economic role in Sargonic Mesopotamia, much as it does in the marshlands of modern Iraq and Khuzestan in Iran. South Asian zebu cattle (Bos indicus), on the other hand, were undoubtedly important sources of milk, meat, leather, dung for fuel and fertilizer, and traction. While zebu cattle were already familiar in Mesopotamia and western Iran from eastern Iranian and Indian sources from as early as the late fourth millennium BCE, additional waves of zebu from the east and localized breeding increased zebu stocks in the Middle East from the late third millennium BCE on (figure 6).91 Although locally domesticated cattle (Bos taurus) were available in the Middle East, zebu cattle proved attractive as they are heat tolerant, highly resistant to livestock diseases, and need less water.92 Genetic (mitochondrial, autosomal, and 86.

The peacock, onomatopoeically named the ḫ aya-bird in Sumerian, was probably introduced to Mesopotamia in Sargonic times but, like the buffalo, disappears after the Old Babylonian period and only re-emerges in the first millennium BCE 93.
