        "text": "Judy\n\nNo such “regular” tours of the type Gallipoli sometimes deserve. Actually not too many Australians visit as groups at all!\n\nThe 2007 week desert march by the 50 Australian riders was the only occasion I remember when any organized group did a tour “in the path of the Great War battles” for more then a day: the actual trip was organized by local volunteers after work connections had been established with the ALH association. Even then, the rest of their tour included Gallipoli and a weeks standard “Holyland grand tour” arranged by a commercial travel organizer belonging to one of the Anglican churches in Jerusalem.\n\nApart from that sometimes groups – definitely not organized on the base of “battle fields touring” – sometimes divert half a day of touring to some Great War Related site or battlefield, but this is certainly not what you refer to.\n\nAt the moment the only potentially battlefield tour to take place is depending on some work done between the local and Australian organizers of that 2007 group – both remained with a “taste for more” and many plans for the future. However, nothing at the moment. The right place to check for any updates regarding this is with the ALH association heads – whom I know to deal with ideas and plans to some extent even at this time.\n\nIn case a small group would like to do a private visit – excluding pyrotechnics and full board type of tour, it might actually be easier then what your thing – at least the 1-2 day party involving the Beersheba area: A small net of the same “enthusiasts” that produced the local portion of the 2007 tour are actually randomly escorting and guiding visitors such as scholars and researchers (some have written books in the passing years). As these people are pretty much volunteers, as well as well acknowledged in this topic, it could end up a pretty satisfying visit – as long as you already decide to visit any way, not as something to base a whole trip on.\n\nThe following battle sites, or related sites, are easy to find and visit, sometimes with a good reading of a map:\n\nThe route of the LH charge on Beersheba\n\nTel e Sab’a (national park)\n\nBir Asluj and the destroyed railway bridge\n\nShellal (National park)\n\nTel Khuleife\n\nTel Sukkatti\n\nSemakh\n\nMusmus passage (main road…)\n\nJordan valley\n\nPlace where the charge at Huj took place\n\nMughar ridge\n\nRiver Auja (middle of city now)\n\nNazereth and the German military cemetary\n\nEasy to visit with appropriate vehicle/guidance are:\n\nKhallasa\n\nAuja el Hafir\n\nKh. Kasif\n\nEl Buqqar ridge\n\nHareira redoubt\n\nTel Shari’a\n\nHill 1070\n\nTel Safi\n\n“Tank redoubt”\n\nTurkish trenches west of Jerusalem\n\nBald hill\n\nDifficult to visit OR “nothing to see”\n\nRedoubts between Gaza and Shellal (2nd battle of Gaza. Mostly covered by fields and houses)\n\nGaza, Khan Yunis and Rafa and all related battlefields and cemeteries in the Gaza strip (I assume to be out of reach at the moment for battle fields touring).\n\nJabel Muntar and some other battles sites in the northern Judean desert (4WD needed, as well as guide who is well familiar with the area).\n\nThe actual banks of the Jordan River (certain procedures and dates – all needed to be taken into consideration ahead).\n\nWadi Far’a (Australian Air Force battle site: proper guidance needed).\n\nThe Front line near the coast, broken in Sep. 1918: few traces if any. Total modernly developed area.\n\nAll southern Samaria battle sites (Tel Asur, Kherbate etc. possible to visit some, but proper preparation is needed, and cooperation with various people who know the situation in the area).\n\nA visit to Jordan is pretty easy.\n\nAs for the Sinai peninsula: With the exception of Australian and New Zealander members of the peace keeping force, I haven’t heard of people combining tours of the 2 territories, even though I’ve heard people visiting Romani (telling that it was totally changed by developments). Perhaps Australian elements in the peace keeping force could help? One NCO of that force I spoke to a year or two ago actually told me – to my surprise – they can hardly “walk” anywhere they like as it used to be.\n\nHope it helps…\n\nHi to all\n\nThere is some great information here - thank you to all of you for your help and time taken to reply.\n\nWhat prompted this idea (along with a family connection) is that in early October I heard Roland Perry interviewed on Radio National in Australia on his recent book on the Australian Light Horse. I haven't yet obtained a copy of his book but it is on the (early) list.\n\nOne tour I have seen to this area from UK includes other theatres of war, holy land visits (which I am very interested in) but there was not a single mention of the Australians - not even on the visit to Beersheba. That is why, in this instance, I would like to find a tour with a special focus on the Australian Light Horse.\n\nI didn't see anything from the AWM or in Mat McLachlan's tours but just as the Western Front has become of so much interest to Australians in more recent times, perhaps after the circulation of Roland Perry's book, more interest will be generated in this area of conflict for visitors from Australia.\n\nBespoke is probably the way to go, but most likely outside my budget. The other thing is a compromise just so I can see the area - but I thought I'd do a bit more searching first before committing to anything.\n\nJudy"
