        "text": "GAZA – On Thursday, the UN warned of an impending famine in Gaza as strict Israeli restrictions continue to prevent relief convoys from entering the Strip, reported Amad Media.اضافة اعلان\n\nThe WHO believes that 93 percent of the population is experiencing crisis-level hunger, also pointing out that diseases are spreading rapidly. It also expects that the potential number of victims who will die from disease and famine in the coming months could exceed the number of people killed in the war so far, estimated at more than 24,000 people, most of them women and children, according to the latest statistics issued by the Ministry of Health in Gaza.\n\nUN Secretary-General António Guterres told reporters on Monday that “the humanitarian situation in Gaza is beyond words... no one is safe. Life-saving relief does not reach those who have endured months of continuous attacks anywhere near the required range.”\n\nRelief agencies told the Washington Post that the main factors that hinder the delivery of life-saving aid to the people of Gaza are almost entirely under Israeli control, where Israeli inspection operations for aid convoys are still long and ineffective and there are not enough trucks or fuel inside Gaza to distribute aid.\n\nLarge portions of Gaza remain off-limits to relief workers, and regular wire and cellular communication interruptions complicate their efforts.\n\nIsrael is heavily limiting the entry of aid trucks, claiming that Hamas seize UN aid trucks when they reach Gaza. However, in an interview with the Post, a senior US official denied that Israel provided any evidence of Hamas seizing any aid.\n\nAdditionally, relief workers and truck drivers who spoke to the Post said that there are long and exhausting inspection processes that take weeks to conduct prior to the entry of trucks. There are also apparent logistical problems in transporting goods from trucks at the Rafah Border Crossing. Palestinian trucks are unable to reach the majority of the Strip as they suffer from fuel shortages.\n\nIsrael insists that it is “doing everything in its power to alleviate the suffering of civilians.” Government spokesman Eylon Levy said last week that Israel facilitated the delivery of “more than 130,000 tons of humanitarian aid.”\n\n“Israel has an exceptional capacity to inspect and deal with trucks. There is no accumulation or restriction on our part,” he added.\n\nEvery day, an average of 100 to 200 trucks pass through the Rafah border crossing. Before the war, this number reached about 500 trucks, many of which carried commercial goods. After the outbreak of the war on October 7, 2023, Israel banned commercial trucks from entering Gaza. The flow resumed in mid-December but was “limited and intermittent,” according to the UNICEF office in Egypt.\n\nIsraeli inspection is complex and lengthy\n\nWhile Egyptian and Palestinian officials run the gates at the Rafah Border Crossing with Egypt, Israeli officials must inspect everything before it can enter. Relief groups describe this process as complex and time-consuming.\n\nEgyptian truck drivers take their cargo through a rough desert road to the Auja Al-Hafir crossing between Egypt and Israel, a journey that takes about two hours, according to Amir Abdullah, who oversees the convoys of the Egyptian Red Crescent.\n\nThe inspection point is only open during the day and closes after Friday and Saturday afternoons. Israeli authorities use dogs and scanning devices to inspect the cargo of the trucks in a long line.\n\nRelief workers say that materials that include necessary clamps for childbirth operations, water desalination equipment, power generators, oxygen tanks, and metal-columned tents are sometimes rejected without explanation from Israeli authorities. When one item on a truck is rejected, the process must be repeated on the entire truckload, which can take weeks.\n\nAccording to two Egyptian truck drivers who spoke to the Washington Post, the shipments that are approved return to the Rafah Border Crossing, where it takes days to transfer the shipment to Palestinian trucks.\n\nRelief workers also attribute the delays to the shortage of Palestinian vehicles, some of which have been damaged by Israeli strikes, and the lack of sufficient fuel for transportation, according to Shameza Abdulla, the senior emergency coordinator at UNICEF.\n\nAdditionally, in the first two weeks of January, humanitarian agencies were only able to carry out seven of the 29 planned missions in northern Gaza, and the Israeli authorities refused to grant permits to the rest, according to the United Nations Office for theCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).\n\nThere is no evidence of Hamas stealing aid – US senior official\n\nIsrael has imposed restrictions on fuel shipments, claiming that Hamas will steal fuel to operate its rockets, and defended the hefty inspection process as necessary to prevent the smuggling of illegal goods. Israeli officials also accused the UN, without evidence, of turning a blind eye to Hamas’s widespread diversion of aid for its own benefit. UN officials denied these allegations.\n\nA senior US official, speaking on condition of anonymity to the Washington Post, said, “The Israeli government has not provided any specific evidence to the US government of theft by Hamas or the diversion of aid provided through the UN and its agencies.”\n\nUnder US pressure, Israel opened a second crossing, the Karem Abu Salem crossing, in December, where the inspection process moves faster. The WFP also began sending convoys from Jordan to Gaza via the West Bank.\n\nSteve Taravella, a senior spokesman for the WFP, said, “These are some good news, but it is important to realize that this is not always a solution. We need to open all border crossings to deliver aid faster.”\n\nThe WFP says that nine out of ten people in Gaza eat less than one meal a day, pointing out the difficulty of the situation with the cold winter.\n\nMore than a million people displaced by the Israeli attack are crowded into a small strip of land along the southern border with Egypt, most of them without adequate shelter. Estimates also indicate that hundreds of thousands of people are still trapped in the north.\n\nRead more Region and World\n\nJordan News\n\nRead More"
