Shifting Paradigms in a Shifting Background An Introduction The idea for this book was first conceived during the planning of a one-­day conference, organized by the two editors of this volume. Originally entitled Perspectives on Byzantine Archaeo­logy from Justinian to the Abbasid Age (6th–9th Centuries), the conference was to be held in Rome in March 2020 at the Escuela Española de Historia y Arqueo­logía in Rome. Unfortunately, the conference never took place because of the dramatic rise and spread of the COVID-­19 pandemic. Nevertheless, we have decided to convert the conference into a book, both to justify the great efforts made by the invited speakers and to present a series of new and ongoing research projects in different areas of Byzantine history. For making this volume possible, we wish to extend our deepest thanks to Rosie Bonté at Brepols and the editorial board of the new series, Archaeo­logy of the Mediterranean World. But why this book? The editors of this volume are in charge of two ongoing projects in two key areas of the Byzantine world, one in Sicily (Castrorao Barba and others 2021) and the other in the Horn of Africa (Castiglia and others 2021), specifically in present day Eritrea. As our projects grew, we felt the need to figure out their place within the larger context of Late Antique and early medi­eval society, taking advantage of the fact that we could have at our disposal brand new and unreleased data. We wanted to compare these data with other areas and key contexts, and so the idea of organizing the conference (and publishing this book) was born. A first key issue that we would like to raise is the use of the term ‘Byzantine’; given the fact that the papers collected in this book embrace a very wide and multifaceted geo­graphical (and cultural) context, we are fully aware of the fact that the concept of ‘Byzantine’ does not apply in the same way in every area discussed. For example, Byzantine Thessaloniki has different connotations from Byzantine Spania.\n\nNevertheless, we believe that the term ‘Byzantine’ frames well the geo­graphical, political, and cultural setting that influenced the different areas in the Mediterranean and beyond. As an example, the kingdom of Aksum, in the Horn of Africa, was never fully under the control of Byzantium, but the direct contacts and influences it had with the Eastern Empire, mostly under Justinian, played a crucial role in shaping the evolution of Aksum as a leading force in the formation of an African Christianity (see Castiglia and Pergola, this volume). Thus the authors involved in this volume will use the term ‘Byzantine’ with a wide perspective, well aware of the different peculiarities and traits it had in the specific geo­graphic areas under debate, and with no pretension to extend it as a unifying model and even less as an all-­encompassing and comprehensive overview of every single macro and micro region under Byzantine rule. It is in fact well known that during the last decade interest in Byzantine archaeo­logy has increased in various contexts, with a major focus on regional studies of the eastern Mediterranean, for example Anatolia (Niewohner 2017; Kontogiannis and Uyar 2021), Cyprus (Zavagno 2017), Naxos in the Aegean (Crow and Hill 2018) or the Levant (Avni 2014; Eger 2014). Within the field of Byzantine studies, archaeo­logical and material culture perspectives are increasingly valued (Crow 2008), and the role of archaeo­logical data has become more and more prominent in historical studies (Böhlendorf-­Arslan and Schick 2021; Consentino 2021). Material culture and trade (Mango 2009; Vroom 2014) is another aspect of Byzantine archaeo­logy that is continuously providing fresh data from new discoveries, e.g., the Yenikapı Byzantine shipwrecks in Istanbul (Kocabaş 2008) or the recent Ma‘agan Mikhael B shipwreck in Israel dated to the mid-­seventh to mid-­eighth centuries (Creisher and others 2019).\n\nAngelo Castrorao Barba ([email protected]) Institute of Archaeo­logy and Ethno­logy, Polish Academy of Sciences (IAE-­PAS) Gabriele Castiglia ([email protected]; [email protected]) Pontificio Instituto di Archeo­logia Cristiana (PIAC) Perspectives on Byzantine Archaeology: From Justinian to the Abbasid Age (6th–9th Centuries), ed. by Angelo Castrorao Barba and Gabriele Castiglia, AMW, 2 (Turnhout, 2022), pp. 13–19 10.1484/M.AMW-EB.5.130669\n\nFHG\n\n14\n\nan ge lo c a s tro r ao b ar b a an d g ab r i e l e c a st i gli a\n\nWith these premises, then, the aim of this book is to collect new advances and perspectives from the field of ‘Byzantine’ archaeo­logy over the longue durée, from the Mediterranean basin and beyond, by providing an updated overview of many different geo­graphical contexts ( Jordan, Greece, the Danube region, the Italian peninsula, Sicily, Spain, and the Horn of Africa). One of the innovative keys of this book is the fact that it compares well known areas and contexts (such as Thessaloniki or Ravenna) with other areas that in the tradition of Byzantine studies have always been somehow marginal, like Spain, Aksum, or others that until a few decades ago were a sort of periphery to post-­classical archaeo­logy, but today are experiencing a new flourish of interest characterized by many projects on the Byzantine period such as Sicily or Southern Italy. Moreover, the book presents what is in many cases brand-­new archaeo­logical data, that will contribute to enrich the debate, sided also by new approaches to some key contexts, like the process of Christianization of the defensive system of Rome, the provocative approaches to architecture in the Iberian Peninsula, or the ‘Justinianic Renaissance’ in the Near East, just to mention a few. Using original and new data coming from surveys, excavations, material culture, and written sources, this volume addresses many different questions. What was the impact of the reconquest of Justinian? How did the territory change across the Byzantine Empire? What are the archaeo­logical indicators of the urban and rural transformations that occurred in this historical background? Did architecture represent a marker of socioeconomic and cultural change in the cradle of a ‘Byzantine space’? What issues of connectivity developed across the Byzantine and Islamic worlds? The volume is organized in three sections, beginning with cities, passing through landscapes and, in the end, focusing on material culture. Since we could not hope to cover all the contexts, we preferred to concentrate our attention on those sites where significant new research is in progress. Konstantinos T. Raptis’s essay on Thessaloniki offers a brilliant perspective on the longue durée of the imperial city, focusing on its evolutions from Late Antiquity until the sack by the Saracens in 904 ad. It is well known that the city gained its pivotal role with the tetrarch Galerius, who, after 308 ad, transferred his official court here from Serdica. One of the most interesting points offered by Raptis is the fact that Thessaloniki was not characterized, in either its topo­graphy or its monuments, by what we might call a ‘Justinianic mark’, since the extensive building programmes promoted by Anastasius I (and also by Justin I) left\n\nbasically ‘nothing […] to be done’ (see Raptis, this volume). Indeed, the erection of the great Christian monuments represented a turning point in the urban assets from the fifth century onwards, reshaping the topo­graphy of the town. Thessaloniki, in these phases, changed its internal balance, with its core no longer being the ancient forum, but the south-­ eastern area, around the imperial palace and the Rotunda (already built by Galerius), and the monumental decumanus maximus, which crossed the whole southern part of the city. The only activities attributable to Justinian are those relevant to the restoration of the decumanus itself and the building of the small funerary church of Hosios David, at the northernmost edge of the town. Another key point offered by Raptis deals with the long transition period from the seventh to the ninth centuries. Despite the incursions of the Slavs and the Avars in the Illyricum and the intense seismic activities that affected the area, it is possible to document a general trend of continuity in the urban framework, even though significant and irreversible metamorphoses irremediably changed the profile of the city. Notwithstanding the repairs to the fortifications and in parts of the decumanus, we can see from the seventh century onwards a reconfiguration of most of the former spaces and structures. This is the case of both the decumanus and the agorà, which were partially abandoned and then partially reoccupied with private and artisanal facilities, thus conforming to a trend found in many towns of the Orbis in these centuries. Thessaloniki, then, went through a contraction of its density, with most of the population concentrated in its southern area. Moreover, in this period — mostly after the earthquakes of the 620s — many of the churches were restored as well, even though they probably never went back to their original magnificence, with the exception of the Saint Demetrius pilgrimage basilica, the only one erected ex novo in the seventh century. To sum up, then, Thessaloniki, despite going through many evolutions and difficulties, culminating in the Saracen raids in the early tenth century, proved its resilience, as Raptis says, with a ‘continuous urban life’. Lucrezia Spera’s paper offers an interesting and original view of sixth-­century Rome by focusing on the urban defensive system at the time of the Gothic War. During the conflict, in fact, the Aurelian Walls saw significant interventions, with a peculiar innovation represented by the accentuation of Christian elements, ‘evoking in various forms the presence of the Saints’ (see Spera, this volume). This process was marked both by the frequent renaming of the city gates (such as the Porta Tiburtina, which became\n\n1. shi f t i ng parad i gms i n a shi f t i ng b ackground\n\nPorta San Lorenzo, or Porta Ostiense, renamed as Porta San Paolo), and by the building of churches and oratories in strict relation to the gates and the walls themselves. Spera also highlights a major connection with cults of military saints coming from the eastern bounds of the Empire. One of the best examples is the case of Saint Theodore, the martyred soldier from Amasea, whose presence had significant topo­graphic repercussions, not only in Rome (for example in the Church of Cosmas and Damianus in the Roman Forum or in the cult building by the Palatine hill), but also in Ravenna and Constantinople. The author, moreover, suggests that ‘the foundation of the San Teodoro church near Porta Prenestina-­Labicana is to be associated with the period of church building that unfolded when Rome was under Byzantine control’ (Spera, this volume). This leads to one of the most important conclusions of the paper: the topo­graphic distribution of the sixth-­century Christian buildings near the Aurelian Walls may have been directly related to the presence of Byzantine troops (like the Theodosiaci). Enrico Cirelli’s work presents an updated overview of Ravenna in the long term, summing up many years of research on this key city of Late Antique Italy. Cirelli offers different thematic approaches by analyzing the evolution of the urban defensive system (which was widely enlarged under the emperor Honorius when the capital was transferred from Milan to Ravenna in 402 ad), places of power (both secular and religious), the economy, private housing, changing patterns in building materials, and the ‘landscapes’ of the dead. It is well known that the heyday of Ravenna began with its ‘promotion’ to capital status, with numerous churches and places of imperial authority, such as the palace and the mint, appearing in the urban fabric. This zenith continued until at least the eighth century, which has been understood to mark the beginning of the city’s decline. Nevertheless, Cirelli stresses how even in the eighth century it is possible to discern the presence of different settlement units, all ‘organized around the main ecclesiastical buildings, close to the great monuments of the Imperial Palace and the Episcopal area, or along the river that ran through the inhabited area’ (Cirelli, this volume). This reveals on the one hand how Ravenna — perhaps also because of its crucial position as trade centre — experienced regression and crisis later than other towns in the West and, on the other hand, the role played by these centres of power. Churches and the imperial palace acted as crucial cores that shaped new urban topo­graphies, guaranteeing a sort of ‘selective maintenance’ (as recently defined in Dey 2014), meaning the ability of the central powers to guarantee\n\nthe continuity and monumentality only of selected buildings and areas in post-­classical towns. Basema Hamarneh provides a very useful and important reconsideration of the sixth century in the Levant. Using both written sources and archaeo­logical data, the author focuses mostly on the sixth-­century plague and the effects that it had on the social and economic fabric of the Byzantine Empire. The interpretation given by Byzantine historians regarding the outbreak of Yersinia pestis was inevitably related, in most cases, to divine punishment and anger. It is evident that these same authors somehow emphasized the impact of the plague on the population. But as Hamarneh rightly points out, since we lack exact demo­graphic data, current interdisciplinary projects are still debating the extent of the impact of the Justinianic plague (Eisenberg and Mordechai 2019; Mordechai and Eisenberg 2019). Another breaking point of the sixth century was the significant climatic downturn that had lasting effects on agriculture and, more generally, on daily life. Turning attention to the archaeo­logical data, one of the richest sources of information lies in the epi­graphic record; while Hamarneh underlines that the cause of death was almost always omitted from inscriptions, there are some recurring formulas that may quite reasonably be attributed to the effects of the plague, as well as some changes in standard burial practices. Nevertheless, Hamarneh’s final conclusion is that ‘the plague was certainly one of the factors that led to a short period of decline and recession, but not necessarily the most serious one. The wars and enemy incursions of first the Persians and then the Arabs were often accompanied by mass deportations and migratory movements, while natural disasters such as earthquakes and climatic downturns undoubtedly contributed to the gradual transformation of the social and economic fabric of the empire’ (Hamarneh, this volume). The paper by Carmelo Pappalardo proposes new readings on a landscape along the Limes Arabicus in transition between the Byzantine and the early Islamic periods, by analysing the site of Umm al-­ Rasas / Kastron Mefa’a in central-­eastern Jordan, and its changes from a military post to an inhabited settlement with numerous churches and agricultural installations. The use of resilience theory and the adaptive cycle (Redman and Kinzig 2003) — which in recent years has had great success in many archaeo­ logical applications, even if more as a metaphor than as an analytical tool (Bradtmöller and others 2017) — have framed a new perspective on the changes that occurred in this area. Pappalardo has identified specific indicators of resilience and evidence of the reaction of the local community to new political,\n\n15\n\n16\n\nan ge lo c a s tro r ao b ar b a an d g ab r i e l e c a st i gli a\n\nsociocultural, and environmental changes: development outside the city walls in relationship to the weakening of military needs; the iconophobic phenomenon in the churches of Jordan beginning in the first half of the eighth century, which may be read as an attempt by Christian communities to adapt to the emergence of Islam; the planning of rainwater harvesting and distribution systems for residential, quarrying, and agricultural purposes; and the continuous building and restoration phases in residential areas and in the churches. Another Limes, along the Lower Danube, was analysed by Ivan Gargano using an approach focusing on written sources. The paper is a critical perspective on the use of Procopius’s De Aedificiis, which Gargano believes cannot be considered a reliable source on changes in the administrative structure of Dacia Ripensis in the sixth century. Gargano also argues for the need to integrate the reading of De Aedificiis with other texts, such as the Iustiniani Novella. Gargano, based on a comparative analysis of De Aedificiis and Iustiniani Novella, hypothesizes that the definition of Aquae as a χώριον was not a reflection of its legal status. A reconsideration of early Byzantine (fourth to sixth centuries ad) Peloponnesian settlements and Christian churches has been proposed by Priscilla Ralli within a dataset of archaeo­logical (excavations and surveys) and documentary sources. As underlined in Gargano’s paper, the use of written source data needs a substantial critical reconsideration and may indeed come to inform an indispensable comparative approach, as evidenced by the comparison between the settlements mentioned in the Synekdemos administrative list and the Tabula Peutingeriana. The formation of a Christian topo­graphy is fundamental to understanding cities such as Corinth, Patras, and Argos in the early Byzantine period. In particular, the city of Argos reveals various phenomena also found in other cities of the Late Antique Mediterranean: an urban shift from the ancient monumental centre, settled around the Larissa hill; new road layers showing resurfacing with spolia and reused building materials; the reconfiguration of the entire agora into a private residential space; the repurposing of the ancient monumental centre for craft and metallurgical activities from the late fifth century; and the foundation of a great baptismal basilica around the sixth century in the south-­eastern area, which was later replaced by a new, bigger church located on the Profitis Ilias hill, incorporating the structures of the former temple of Apollo. In the interaction between city and countryside, the emergence of ‘third-­spaces’ is emphasized (Veikou 2009) — something beyond the usual dichotomy of urban\n\nand rural. For example the ‘ruralization’ of Nemea involved a Christian community building a church close to the gymnasium and burying their dead in the area of the temple of Apollo. Some of these burials contained jewels that attest to the presence of rural elites. Rural aristocracies are also attested in the countryside, as in the case of the lavish Late Antique villa of Loukou (Eua, Arcadia). The landscapes of Byzantine Italy — or the many Byzantine Italies (Zanini 1998) — have received renewed interest in recent years in parallel with the growth of post-­classical archaeo­logy, especially in southern Italy. Paul Arthur in his article asks: ‘What effects did half a millennium of Byzantine rule have on medi­eval and modern Italy and the Italians?’ (Arthur, this volume) In light of many years of research in Salento (southern Puglia), this question is at the centre of Arthur’s ambitious new project called ‘Byzantine Heritage of Southern Italy’. The impact of the Byzantine presence in Italy is presented in the light of new questions and new interdisciplinary approaches (isotope analysis, environmental archaeo­logy, archaeometry) aimed at understanding the change in the management strategies of agricultural spaces due to shifting political conditions and climate change, the formation of new settlement models and defensive structures, new regional productions (such as the so-­called ‘Rocchicella’ or ‘a stuoia’ cooking pots identified in Sicily in the late eighth to ninth centuries) and Mediterranean economic connectivity, the transformations in food habits reflected in archaeo-­botanical findings and changes in material culture, as well as the impact of new waves of migrations. In the framework of this renewed interest in the archaeo­logy of Byzantine southern Italy, Sicily has provided new and interesting data in recent years regarding the archaeo­logical approach to the formation of both rural and urban Byzantine landscapes and the complex dynamics of transition into the Islamic period. Angelo Castrorao Barba and Giuseppe Cacciaguerra (this volume) reveal the presence in the Byzantine countryside of Sicily of elements that break with the previous villa system through the various rounds of reuse and reoccupation of the Roman and late Roman aristocratic villae. In spite of this, continuity of occupation and complexity with respect to the late Roman past is recorded in the large secondary settlements (e.g., Sofiana/Philosophiana) — the so-­called agro-­towns — which constituted crucial edges in the settlement network until the early Middle Ages. The formation of the thema of Sicily during the late seventh century was identified as the key moment for structuring new settlement patterns. The planning of a terri-\n\n1. shi f t i ng parad i gms i n a shi f t i ng b ackground\n\ntorial defence based on the castra system (e.g., the state fortification of Monte Kassar in Castronovo di Sicilia) in the face of the insecurity brought by the first Islamic raids, as well as unprecedented forms of occupation like the circular huts found in Contrada Edera (Bronte) in eastern Sicily (late eighth to ninth centuries), are all examples of these new patterns. Gabriele Castiglia and Philippe Pergola (this volume) give a broad overview of a geopolitical context not often considered from the perspective of the Byzantine world: the Horn of Africa. By analysing both written sources and new archaeo­logical data (mostly from the town of Adulis in present day Eritrea) they describe the long process that led to the birth, formation, and full development of early Christianity in the Aksumite kingdom. Although the ‘new’ religion was already rooted in the kingdom from the first decades of the fourth century (following the conversion of King Ezana and his court), it was only from the sixth century onwards, with the first instances of church building, that Christianity took off as a monumental and topo­graphic asset. At about the same time Aksum entered into direct contact with Byzantium, first with Justin and then with Justinian, in the wider context of the Persian wars and the subsequent struggle for a monopoly over the silk trade. What Castiglia and Pergola stress is that this link with the siege of Constantinople may have represented the definitive catalyst for the affirmation of Christianity, with an architecture that revealed deep influences coming from the Byzantine koine. Joanita Vroom focuses mainly on the shifting and changing patterns of commercial networks in the eastern Mediterranean from the seventh to the ninth centuries by exploring them with ‘resilience’ as a key metric. One of the main points of her essay is that ‘archaeo­logical data can contribute to the understanding of how the Byzantine Empire managed to maintain the economic and commercial domination of its shrinking territory after the seventh century by carefully looking at the circulation of ceramics between the capital and its core areas during this period’ (Vroom, this volume). The author deals with three larger subjects: the distribution of imperial ceramics within the Byzantine Empire, the early Byzantine amphorae from a general point of view, and an in-­depth analysis of the ‘LRA 2/13’ amphora type. One of the crucial points stressed by Vroom in her chapter is the fact that from the seventh century onwards the trade of amphorae with small-­status ships proved to be ‘more prevalent than previously known’. This interpretation is well supported by the detailed overview of the ‘LRA 2/13’ type. Dated mostly from the mid-­seventh to the early ninth cen-\n\nturies, these amphorae had fairly standardized forms and were related mainly to ‘coastal small-­scale local and regional pottery workshops near oil and wine producing areas. This trend is evidence that after the seventh century, despite a general crisis, the central administration of the Byzantine Empire still had a top-­down control on trade, often functional, to supply the army. Vroom also stresses that the church may have had a crucial role as a production centre of such amphorae. All of this, then, may be a sign of the resilience of the empire itself, capable, as we have seen, of maintaining a ‘system of (military or ecclesiastic) exchange nodes, of connected and interlocking urban centres, and of durable coastal networks. Flavia Marani offers a very interesting and useful overview on the monetary circulation in Rome and Naples during the early Byzantine periods using a comparative approach. Both cities played a central role in the turbulent events of the Gothic War, being sites of important mints. Despite the disparity of the indicators coming from the two cities, with Rome being inevitably better known than Naples, the author presents some significant comparisons, thus bringing new light to some outdated interpretations. In Rome the crucial evidence is still that of the excavations carried out at the Crypta Balbi, which revealed indications of significant circulation of various goods, mainly related, in the seventh century, to the monastery of San Lorenzo in Pallacinis. Among this evidence, the study of coins — already completed by Alessia Rovelli — shows a meaningful continuity in the minting activities in Rome and a good amount of monetary circulation between the seventh and the eighth centuries, mostly related to the use of the minimi produced in the fifth and sixth centuries, and is a clear indicator of the long term use of such coins. It was only after the 730s, in Marani’s analysis, that the minting activity in Rome ended, in strict relation to the progressive dismissal of Byzantine power. The situation in Naples was in many ways similar to that in Rome. The opening of a mint in the middle of the seventh century represents a crucial aspect of the economic and political scenario and, just as in Rome, it is possible to document a prolonged circulation of minimi, probably minted in Rome itself. However some fundamental differences can be traced, and it is worth quoting directly Marani’s words: ‘The difference between Rome and Naples lies in the possibility of the former to melt down the coinage left by the Ostrogoths, and specifically by Totila (thus erasing the propagandistic message), for the minting of new coins, while in the latter the Byzantine authority could not apply the same con-\n\n17\n\n18\n\nan ge lo c a s tro r ao b ar b a an d g ab r i e l e c a st i gli a\n\ntrol, having need of coinage and being dependent on Rome for supply’ (Marani, this volume). Critical reflections are discussed by María de los Angeles Utrero Agudo about the Byzantine influence in Visigothic religious architecture and on the real material consistency of Byzantine Spania (552–624), limited to the south and east coastlines of the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands. In light of recent re-­evaluation, Utrero Agudo proposes a radical reimagining of the traditional vision of the influence of Byzantium on Visigothic churches. Furthermore, the evidence does not indicate any specific characteristics reflecting a Byzantine ‘patronage’ of religious architectures in Spania between the fifth and seventh centuries. Churches from this period maintain the typical elements of Late Antique Mediterranean architecture, such as the presence of a wooden roof, vaulted apses, rough stone masonries, and the use of single elements of spolia. Furthermore, some churches traditionally considered typically Byzantine have recently been reconsidered. For example, the basilica of Algezares (Murcia) is most likely from the early seventh century and not the second half of the sixth century; the church of La Alcudia (Alicante), whose mosaic pavement with a Greek inscription had been previously dated to sixth century, has been redated to the late fourth century; and the site of El Monastil (Elda, Alicante), which has recently been defined as ‘the first Byzantine monastery’, actually appears to be a Late Antique complex, and ‘no solid reasons\n\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to the Escuela Española de Historia y Arqueo­logía en Roma (EEHAR-CSIC) and its director Dr Antonio Pizzo for having agreed to host the conference.

However, a connection with the Byzantine Mediterranean is attested by the material culture, especially in the Balearic Islands, although many religious buildings seem to have been built before the arrival of Byzantine militias in Iberian territory and continued to be used afterwards. This article by Utrero Agudo seriously questions the archaeo­logical indicators of an effective definition of ‘Byzantine’ with regard to certain architectural and material evidence, and concludes that for many contexts, ‘although they are located in the Byzantine strip, this fact does not make them necessarily Byzantine’ (Utrero Agudo, this volume). With this book, then, we present a series of different observations on the Byzantine world using some well-­known contexts and also brand-­new areas and perspectives. What emerges is a heterogenous fresco with many shifting paradigms (economic, social, and religious) in a shifting background, a mirror of an ever-­changing ‘Byzantine world’. The data presented in this book, moreover, often also pushes us to go beyond the canonical debate over continuity/ transition, since we can often see traits of osmosis and resilience that contribute to shape an even more multifaceted complexity in a ‘global’ world that, even though it may not have been ‘Byzantine’ everywhere in the same ways, it was indeed the result of a series of influences that often had Byzantium (lato sensu) as a common denominator.\n\n1. shi f t i ng parad i gms i n a shi f t i ng b ackground\n\nWorks Cited Avni, Gideon. 2014.

Thessaloniki in Transition (Sixth to Ninth Centuries) The Transformation of a Late Antique Imperial Metropolis into a Medi­eval Urban Centre\n\nABSTRACT Taking into consideration the still\n\nstanding Byzantine monuments of ecclesiastical and secular architecture erected or restored between the early seventh and the late ninth centuries, and the urban reshaping of the intra-­muros area of Thessaloniki during the transitional period, as it has been traced in rescue excavations, along with the aid of literary sources of the same period, the present study attempts to draw, even vaguely, the urban face and character of the city from its definite shaping as a Late Antique, Christian, imperial metropolis during the early decades of the sixth century, until its conclusive transformation into a medi­eval urban centre from the early seventh until the late ninth or the dawn of the tenth centuries. The essay examines the urban transformation of the city through the difficult seventh century, which was marked by the unsuccessful sieges of the Avars and Slavs, and the notorious series of earthquakes in the 620s, which devastated the pre-­existing monuments and the urban infrastructure of the city, and were then followed by the subsequent — probably flourishing for Thessaloniki — Iconoclastic period, marked by the erection of the Hagia Sophia cross-­ domed cathedral, until the siege and the sack of the city by the Saracens in 904. In this way, it features the continuity of Thessaloniki’s urbanism through a difficult and dark period for the Byzantine Empire.\n\nKEYWORDS Thessaloniki; Transitional period;\n\nByzantine urbanism; ecclesiastical architecture; Secular architecture\n\nFrom the Foundation of the Hellenistic City to the Shaping of a Late Antique Imperial Metropolis Thessaloniki was founded in 316/315 bc by the Macedonian king Cassander (r. 317–305, 305–297 bc), and was named after his wife, the daughter of Philip II (r. 359–336 bc) and half-­sister of Alexander III (r. 336–323 bc). However, notwithstanding its prominent founder and the strategic importance of its location at the head of the Thermaic gulf, the city that became the third capital of the Macedonian kingdom did not play an important role in the Balkans until after the Roman conquest of Macedonia in the second century bc. The city served as the provincial capital of Macedonia from 146 bc and became a focal point on the broad road network implemented by the Romans (Adam-­Veleni 2003, 134–37; Allamani-­Souri 2003, 67–69; Tourta 2013, 76–77, Raptis in press a). The fortified Roman city was developed around the Agora, its civil and administrative centre, which was constructed at the end of the second and during the third centuries ad, and was most probably functioning until the middle or the third quarter of the fifth century (Bakirtzis 1977, 257–69; 1984, 5–19; Spieser 1984, 82–89; Hattersley-­Smith 1996, 120–22; Vitti 1996, 93–104; Adam-­Veleni 2003, 146–56; 2013, 10–12; Raptis 2015, 243 n. 37; 2017a, 113–14). The urban area was planned around the Agora according to the Hippodamian system with large rectangular insulae, shaped by parallel decumani — the two wider and most important of which connected the main gates of the fortification — and transverse cardines (Vitti 1996, 67–86, plan 2–3, 5).\n\nKonstantinos T.

View from north-­east.\n\nNotwithstanding its prior importance as a provincial capital, Thessaloniki (Fig. 2.1) evolved into a major urban centre with ‘worldwide’ significance during the period of the first Roman Tetrarchy, when Caesar Galerius (r. 293–311 ad) decided to make the city his seat during the war against the Persians, and especially after 308, when, as sole Augustus of the East, he officially transferred his court from Serdica to Thessaloniki, designating the city one of the four new Tetrarchic capitals along with Milan, Trier and Antioch (Ćurčić 2010a, 19; Tourta 2013, 78; Velenis 2018, 52; Raptis in press c). Galerius’ large palatial complex, founded at the south-­easternmost part of the city, marked the transfer of the city’s ‘headquar-\n\nters’ from the Agora and the Roman Praetorium, which was located at the north-­east sector of the lower city (Kanonidis 1996, 559–70) (Fig. 2.1), to the Imperial court at the newly founded Tetrarchic palace at the edge, and outside the limits of the formerly urban area. For details of the palatial complex of Thessaloniki, see: Adam-­Veleni 2003, 164–68; Stefanidou-­Tiveriou 2006, 163–88; Ćurčić 2010a, 18–19; Mentzos 2010a, 333–59; Athanassiou and others 2015). Over the course of the fourth and mainly the fifth centuries, after Thessaloniki had reached its final size, marked by the outline of the early Byzantine, trapezoidal fortifications (Velenis 1998, 171–73; Rizos 2011, 450–68; Tzevreni 2019, 50–53) (Figs 2.1–2.2), and until the two first decades of the sixth century, Thessaloniki passed through a gradual Christianization process, the result of which was the transformation of the former Tetrarchic capital into a Late Antique Christian metropolis, following the urban model of Constantinople (Ćurčić 2010b, 213–44; Raptis 2021a, 580; in press c). This Early Byzantine urban development was monumentally marked by a large, carefully designed, imperial building project, which involved the re-­design of the urban space with the addition of several rectangular, circular and sigmoid fora along the colonnaded decumanus maximus of the city (Vasileiadou and others 2018; Konstantinidou and Miza 2020, 9–34; Raptis 2021a, 579; 2021b, 17–25; in press c) (Fig. 2.1), as well as the restoration and the erection of several ecclesiastical monuments. Among the architectural oeuvres constructed in this framework are the secondary, Christian, phases of both the palatial Rotunda (Moutsopoulos 1984, 376; Spieser 1984, 113–64; Torp 1991, 13–28; Theocharidou 1992, 57–76; Hattersley-­Smith 1996, 149–52; Ćurčić 2010a, 202–04; 2010b, 216–22; Tourta 2013, 79; Velenis 2018, 53; Torp 2018, 13–51; Akrivopoulou 2020, 23–31; Raptis 2019a; in press c) (Figs 2.1, 2.3), and the Octagon near the Golden Gate (Fig. 2.1) (Marki 1983, 117–33; Hattersley-­Smith 1996, 163–64; Ćurčić 2010a, 104–05; 2010b, 224–25; Raptis 2021a, 579; 2021b, 17–25, in press\n\n25\n\n26\n\nko n s ta n ti n o s t. r ap t i s\n\nFigure 2.5.

It seems that this building programme was an ambitious plan ordered by and probably implemented during the long reign of Anastasius I (r. 491–518), who tried to strengthen the religious and political domination of the Constantinopolitan court against the papal Rome in the capital of the Illyricum (Raptis 2021a, 581; in press c). This extensive urban development of the main monumental axis of the city during the reign of Anastasius I is marked by major architectural endeavours, comprising both secular and ecclesiastical monuments — even though some were possibly only planned by Anastasius I, and were actually completed in the following period, during the reign of Justin I (r. 518–527) —, possibly explains why Thessaloniki lacks ecclesiastical monuments characterized by the innovative architecture of the Justianianic era. It must be noted that the Justinianic architectural sculptures that have been documented in Thessaloniki are rather few, when compared to Constantinople and other significant cities of the Byzantine world. At least in terms of monumental urban development, it seems that there was little to nothing left to be done in Thessaloniki by the time of the accession of Justinian (Raptis in press c).\n\nThessaloniki during the Reign of Justinian I\n\nFigure 2.7. Thessaloniki. Latomos monastery. View of the katholikon from the north-­east.\n\nAs they have emerged from recent excavations in the centre of the city, it seems that the only urban project that could be attributed to the reign of Justinian I (r. 527–565) or to that of his immediate successors — Justin II (r. 565–578), Tiberius II (r. 578–582) and Maurice (r. 582–602) — are the extensive, though partial, repairs and the topical widening of the pre-­ existing marble-­paved decumanus maximus with large rectangular paving stones cut from extremely hard metamorphic volcanic rock (Fig. 2.6) (Vasileiadou and Tzevreni 2020, 35–56).

Latomos monastery. The Theophany mosaic on the semidome of the apse.\n\nConstantinople and other significant cities of the Byzantine periphery, has ever been documented in Thessaloniki. Until the erection of the transitional cross-­domed cathedral of Hagia Sophia two centuries later, the architecture of the capital of the Illyricum was dominated either by the large, elongated basilicas (Episcopal basilica, Acheiropoietos, basilica of Saint Demetrius) of the late fifth or early sixth centuries, or the double-­shelled, centrally planned churches that were implemented through restorations in new design of previous Constantinian or Theodosian rotundas and octagons (Raptis 2019a; 2021b, 17–25; in press c). In this period, some restoration works could be also attributed to both — although not maintained and only partially documented by excavation — the late fifth ‒ early sixth-­century Episcopal basilica and the possibly three aisled basilica of Saint Demetrius (Fig. 2.1); However, this suggestion is not anything more than a vague hypothesis, based only on some Justinianic Impost capitals in secondary use, which crown some of the columns of the subsequent buildings on the same spots (Farioli 1964, 176–77). The only building that can be attributed to the long lasting period of Justinian’s reign is not a large timber-­roofed or domed basilica, but the small vaulted burial church that became the katholikon of the\n\nLatomos Monastery during the following centuries and is known today as the Church of Hosios David (Figs 2.1, 2.7) (Xyngopoulos 1929, 142–80; Pelekanidis 1949, 43–68; Hoddinott 1963, 173–79; Tsigaridas 1986, 11–23; Velenis and Semoglou 2005, 24–25; Ćurčić 2010a, 109–10; Raptis and Fantidou 2020, 69–92); a building located in the uphill area of Thessaloniki, close to and to the south of the northern fortification wall, which was not part of a wider architectural programme and did not play a significant role in the urban development of the Late Antique city. The cruciform core of this small, vaulted church was inscribed in a 12 metre-­w ide square. Initially, the fourcorner compartments, square in plan, were linked via low arched doorways only with the transverse arms of the cruciform core of the church. The presbytery occupied the eastern arm of the cross, which ended in the semicircular apse of the Holy Bema. The arms of the cross were covered with barrel vaults, the central area with a blind dome on pendentives and the corner compartments with sail vaults. As indicated by the large, vaulted graves — synchronous with the foundation of the church — which were documented below the floor of the cruciform core of the church, and in combination with the soterio­logical character of the Theophany mosaic (Fig. 2.8) on the semi-­dome\n\n27\n\n28\n\nko n s ta n ti n o s t. r ap t i s\n\nof the apse (Xyngopoulos 1929, 158–80; Grumel 1930, 157–75; Diehl 1932, 333–38; Pelekanidis 1949, 62–68; Gerke 1964, 179–99; Gkioles 1984, 83–94; Spieser 1984, 157–61; Velenis and Semoglou 2005, 24–25; Nasrallah 2010, 361–96; Semoglou 2011–2012, 5–16; 2012, 231–39; Kourkoutidou-­Nikolaidou and Mavropoulou-­Tsioumi 2012, 185–95; Cantone 2013, 63–112; Mastora 2014, 37–72) — dated probably, on the basis of stylistic criteria, to the period of Justinian I, or according to epi­graphic evidence after his reign (Velenis 2018, 60) — the church would initially have served as a burial hall, being either a cruciform martyrium or the mausoleum of a noble family of the city (Raptis and Fantidou 2020, 86–87). From the last decades of the sixth century, which coincide with the turbulent reign of Maurice (r. 582–602), danger knocked once more upon the gates of the city, when the Avars and Slavs several times raided and besieged Thessaloniki (Lemerle 1979–1981, ii, 104–10; Tourta 2013, 83). Even though the inhabitants of the city remained secured behind its circuit wall, the blessedness of the Late Antique ‘springtime’ would gradually come to an end, as the ‘winter’ of the Middle Ages was approaching.\n\nThe Transitional Period (Seventh to Ninth Centuries) As has already been implied, the key factors that brought the Late Antique Mediterranean world closer to its end also affected Late Antique/early Byzantine Thessaloniki. The extensive population movements that disordered Illyricum during the last decades of the sixth century, disrupting its administrative unity, threatened the fortifications of Thessaloniki as well. From the end of the sixth century until the last decades of the seventh century, Thessaloniki became the focal point of successive incursions and fortunately unsuccessful sieges by the Avars and Slavs, which occurred in the years from 586 or 597 to 620 and eventually from 676 to 678 — the last one being accompanied by famine (Lemerle 1979–1981, ii, 104–10; Tourta 2013, 83). Their description is contained in the extensive narrations of the Miracles of St Demetrius, which are preserved in two collections; the first composed by the Archbishop of Thessaloniki, Ioannes (d. 618), and the second by an anonymous writer, probably a member of the clergy, who completed his narration of the Miracles in the last decade of the seventh century, seventy years after the writing of the first book (Lemerle 1979–1981). According to these written sources (which were quasi-­synchronous to the aforementioned events), the city and its faith-\n\nful inhabitants were always saved by the supernatural — therefore miraculous — interventions of its patron saint. Eventually, the city definitively escaped the Avar and Slavic threats only after the conclusive victory of Justinian II (r. 685–695, 705–711) over the Slavs and his victorious entry into the city in 688. During the third decade of the turbulent seventh century, and just after the end of the fifth attempt of the Avars and Slavs to besiege the city, the urban history of Thessaloniki was also marked by intense seismic activity, also described in the third chapter of the second book of the Miracles of St. Demetrius (Miracles of St Demetrius, 262–73). The devastating earthquakes of the third decade of the century seem to have destroyed a large part of the city, including extensive sections of the fortification, urban infrastructure and most of the private and public, secular and ecclesiastical buildings of Thessaloniki, as recently proven by archaeo­logical evidence. Even though the plan and the size of the Early Byzantine fortified city did not change over the centuries (Fig. 2.1), the (largely) fifth-century fortifications of the city did undergo several partial reconstructions and additions up to the seventh century, aiming to enhance their defensive capacity. The masonry of the walls was gradually reinforced along the entire perimeter according to the various defensive needs. This successive reinforcement of the city walls resulted in a thickness of up to five metres. Typical characteristics of these early seventh-­century additions are the exclusive use of bricks in the corners of the towers and the large brick crosses at the northern and most vulnerable parts of the wall, which have been attributed to repairs of the fortification after the victory of Heraclius (r. 610–641) over the Persians in 622. Apart from the characteristic reddish — rich in ceramic aggregates — mortar and the building techniques of the transitional period, the sections of both the land and the sea walls, which were restored and reinforced after the 620s earthquakes, are also characterized by the extensive use of the spolia available after the earthquakes, most of which were taken from the destroyed Roman Agora and the theatre-­stadium complex. These were then incorporated mainly into the masonry of the land walls of the lower city as well as at the lower parts of the sea walls, which — as was already noticed by the tenth century — was significantly lower than the land walls until the siege and occupation of the city by the Saracens. After these repairs, a significant number of different types of masonry and building materials in addition to brick or marble inscriptions that are preserved in the fortification testify to the subsequent modifications and remodelling of the city walls. In the chrono­logical context of this paper,\n\n2. t he ssalo ni k i i n t ransi t i o n (si xt h to ni nt h ce nturies)\n\nthe earliest among the several inscriptions on the walls is the stone inscription — ΠΥΡ[ΟΥ] ΕΡΓΟ — located above the external side of the small gate of the northern wall, which has been already correlated with the Patriarch of Constantinople, Pyrrhus (638–641), whose office is synchronous with the last four years of the long-­lasting reign of Heraclius. This inscription, along with the brick crosses of the northern wall, indicates the wall’s repair or partial reconstruction during the reign of Heraclius and thus after the earthquakes of the 620s; it was an imperial decision, funded and under the control of high-­ level state officials. At the end of the period under discussion, another inscription dated to the second half of the ninth century (862) refers to the repair of the southernmost tower of the western wall by the royal Protospatharios Marinos, the double covering of which, combining brickwork with a filling of rough stones, is a typical early Middle Byzantine masonry style (Velenis 1998, 127–31; Ćurčić 2010a, 277–78; Tzevreni 2019, 53). In the centre of the city, the monumental colonnaded decumanus maximus and several of the early sixth-­century fora that formed the urban face of the Late Antique city (Fig. 2.1) were to a great extent destroyed after the collapse of their arcaded porticos (Fig. 2.9) (Vasileiadou and Tzevreni 2020, 54; Konstantinidou and Miza 2020, 25–26) The public sewage system also sustained serious damage (Badravos and Batzelas 2019). However, parts of the colonnaded porticos, and the sewer of the main decumanus of the city as well, were soon partially repaired and, though deformed, remained in use until the middle of the ninth century (Konstantinidou and Miza 2020, 26–28). During the same period, the south-­east corner of the decumanus maximus with the cardo that led from the Saint Menas church, near the harbour, to the grounds where formerly the Praetorium of the city had stood, was occupied by a new, most probably public, secular building — possibly a bathing establishment — the main façades of which were constructed with the extended use of marble spolia (Konstantinidou and Miza 2020, 26). However, most of the monumental architectural complexes, including the imperial palace of the city, were ruined and eventually, after losing their role in the urban life, abandoned and gradually occupied by private facilities, thus serving different functions. It is characteristic that the open square of the Agora, which was abandoned as early as the mid-­f ifth century, was soon occupied by workshops for artisanal productions such as ceramics, glass, and metalwares (Raptis 2015, 244). It seems that the destructive seismic activity of the 620s greatly affected the urban history\n\nFigure 2.9. Thessaloniki. The decumanus maximus. Masonry collapsed on the marble paved street (Venizelou Metro station).\n\nof Thessaloniki, bringing with it extensive urban changes; the monumental topo­graphy of the most important Late Antique metropolis of the Balkans literally vanished. Notwithstanding the aforementioned disaster, the surviving monuments, the archaeo­ logical data, and the written sources of the period from the seventh to the turn of the tenth centuries prove the continuity of the urban life in the city (Bakirtzis 2007, 89–118; Raptis 2015, 237–50; Raptis 2017a, 105–24). The population of the urban area, as well as people from the rural lands at the outskirts of the fortifications, gathered in smaller areas of the city centre, occupying and repairing parts of older damaged buildings, which intersected in smaller properties trying to resolve the housing problem of the seventh-­ century city. The large halls of the urban villas of Late Antiquity were divided into smaller rooms, as the luxurious houses of the previous period were adapted in the humbler needs of the new era. Thus, the villas located at the lowlands of the city were transformed into neighbourhoods. In most cases each one of the large chambers of the living quarters of these urban villas was converted into a separate private house, while their atria became the common courtyards, to which all households had access. Thus the lowlands within the fortification were eventually densely populated, while the urban villas of the upper city (Fig. 2.1), on the sloping terrain located to the north of Saint Demetrius basilica were totally abandoned; this area of the city ceased to be inhabited after the seventh-­century earthquakes. Thus, even though traditionally the agricultural, stockbreeding, and artisanal activities had been\n\n29\n\n30\n\nko n s ta n ti n o s t. r ap t i s\n\nsystematically carried out in the rural areas outside the fortification, these large parts of the urban area, within the walls, near the walls, and in the hilly area of the upper city, hosted during this period private crops, orchards, or small crafting facilities, providing goods and enhancing the city’s autarky in both agricultural and artisanal commodities (Bakirtzis 2007, 105–06). After the earthquakes of the 620s, the colonnaded marble/stone paved decumanus maximus of Late Antiquity gave its place to the Byzantine thoroughfare of the city, with an earthen surface, called Leoforos or Mese by the Byzantine writers. This earthen thoroughfare was flanked by blocks of mud-­built stores, workshops, and houses that occupied the places of both the pre-­existing porticos and plazas that had once thrived along the monumental decumanus maximus (Vasileiadou and others 2018, 161; Konstantinidou and Miza 2020). During the period in question, mercantile activity evolved on both sides of this road (Fig. 2.1), which until the ninth century served as the main marketplace of the city for everything except food, including both luxurious and plain artisanal products. Pottery, glassware, metalware, and jewellery were produced and sold. According to the archaeo­logical data the small, mud and rough stone, buildings of the Byzantine marketplace had workshops and storage in the back-­rooms, while their fronts usually opened directly on the road with semi-­open spaces and rough-­made parapets and sheds for the display of their merchandise (Raptis 2015, 242). The significance of the city’s marketplace during the period in question is emphasized by John Kaminiates in his narration about the sack of Thessaloniki by the Saracens in 904, who notes that ‘the crowds — both locals and visitors seeking merchandise and commodities — were so infinite that would be easier to count the sand-­grains of the seashore than the people, marketeers, and buyers, crossing the city’s marketplace’ ( John Kaminiatēs, Ἰωάννου κληρικοῦ καὶ κουβουκλησίου τοῦ Καμενιάτου, § 9.7). Another marketplace in the city during the period in question is attested in a late eighth-­century letter of Theodoros Studitēs, describing his exile-­journey to Thessalonikē in 797, where an eighth-­century marketplace that was active in the area inside and probably close to the eastern walls, not far from the Kassandreotikē gate is documented (Theodore Studitēs, Θεοδώρου Ἡγουμένου τῶν Στουδίου, 917. Raptis 2015, 240–41; 2017a, 109–10). The same marketplace is referenced in the ninth-­century bio­graphy of St Theodora of Thessaloniki, wherein a marketplace organized close to the Kassandreotikē gate is clearly attested (Life of St Theodora, § 9; Raptis 2015,\n\n240–41; 2017a, 110). These markets, documented either by archaeo­logical data, or written sources, reveal the continuity of urban life and the prosperous economy of Thessaloniki during the period in question (Raptis 2015, 237–50; 2017a, 105–24). In this active, continuously moving, and densely populated urban environment of the city centre, and notwithstanding the insecurity and the general economic crisis of the seventh century, the main urban infrastructure and the most important ecclesiastical monuments for the episcopacy of the city, which had been partially or totally devastated by the 620s earthquakes, were either restored or completely rebuilt, if not with the former luxury of Late Antiquity, then with a character of diversity and spirit of practicality that seems to characterize the new era. Additionally, it is noticeable that while the private secular structures of the period are characterized by a certain improvisation and building inferiority, the contemporary military and ecclesiastical buildings are marked by structural quality accorded with a different — and not inferior — aesthetic order. Among the significant ecclesiastical buildings of the early Byzantine period that had been destroyed and rebuilt or remodelled after the seventh-­century earthquakes were the basilica of Saint Demetrius and the Acheiropoietos basilica. The Rotunda and Saint Menas church (Fig. 2.1), which had been also been affected by the earthquakes were also rehabilitated, though possibly to a lesser extent. On the other hand the episcopal basilica and the octagon near the Golden gate seem to have been destroyed so utterly by the earthquakes that their restoration was not feasible with the means of the period. The Saint Demetrius pilgrimage basilica (Figs 2.1, 2.10–2.11) is the only ecclesiastical monument erected in the seventh century; the newly built five-­aisled basilica with a three aisled transept at the east, though it incorporated a few parts of the pre-­existing, destroyed by fire — possibly three-­aisled — basilica of the late fifth century, does not follow the plan of the previous church. The seventh-­century basilica has certain architectural features that leave behind the morpho­logical uniformity of Late Antiquity, introducing gradually the ecclesiastical architecture of Thessaloniki into the multi-­collective aesthetics of the Byzantine era, with the most characteristic feature the articulation of the inner colonnades, with two pairs of masonry piers inserted between groups of three or four columns each, instead of the longitudinal uninterrupted colonnades of the early Byzantine basilicas of the city, which in this basilica are used only in the smaller outer aisles. It is remarkable that a small part of the former Roman baths, which was incorporated into the pre-­existing basilica of the\n\n2. t he ssalo ni k i i n t ransi t i o n (si xt h to ni nt h ce nturies)\n\nfifth century, was once again incorporated into the north-­west end of the outer north aisle and was converted into a chapel containing until modern times the saint’s cenotaph (Xyngopoulos 1929; Soteriou 1952; Spieser 1984, 165–214; 1992, 561–69; Hattersley-­ Smith 1996, 153–63; Kourkoutidou-­Nikolaidou and Tourta 1997, 153–74; Bakirtzis 1998; 2012, 139–79; Mentzos 2000, 179–202; 2001, 217–45; 2006; 2010b, 13–26, 214–26; 2012, 82–103; Ćurčić 2010a, 106–07; 2010b, 228; Bauer 2013; Tourta 2013, 82; Velenis 2018, 58–59). However, it has to be noted that most probably the seventh-­century basilica of the city’s patron saint did not have galleries, since, on the basis of architectural and structural documentation of the building, it seems that the galleries above the outer aisles and the transept were added to the seventh-­century structure during the Middle Byzantine period, while the original existence of galleries above the inner aisles is also disputable (Mentzos 2001, 222–25; 2012, 98; Bauer 2013, 105; Raptis 2017b, 304; in press b). Around the same period, and until the middle of the century, the Acheiropoietos basilica (Figs 2.1, 2.4–2.5), the upper structure of which had been partially damaged by the 620s earthquakes, was also monumentally restored. Since the lower part of the outer walls as well as the longitudinal arched colonnades of the main nave were not affected seriously by the earthquake, which devastated the upper structure — mainly the clerestory — of this late fifth or early sixth century basilica without galleries (Mentzos 2001, 222–25; 2012, 98; Bauer 2013, 105; Raptis 2017b, 304; in press c), the plan of the church remained the same. However, the upper structure of the basilica was remodelled, since galleries were now added for the first time to the building. The colonnades of the lateral galleries followed along the upper floor the longitudinal arched colonnades of the main nave, while the western — non surviving — gallery was possibly a wide, open, hall, looking towards the nave. The no longer extant clerestory which was added above the gallery arcades, was extended over the wider western gallery of the basilica to its western wall. At the same time pastophoria flanked the presbytery apse, vaulted annexes were added along the north side of the basilica, the south propylon of the basilica that gave access to the church from the Mese was remodelled as a barrel-­vaulted corridor, while the Early Byzantine diakonikon, located to the south side of the basilica to the east of the propylon, was transformed into a small scale baptistery, the existence of which is probably attested in the homily that archbishop Leo the Mathematician delivered in the church in 843 (Raptis 2019b, 29–60). It seems that, among the four great churches of the city, the Acheiropoietos basilica was the least damaged by the\n\nFigure 2.10. Thessaloniki. Saint Demetrius basilica. View from south-­west.\n\nFigure 2.11. Thessaloniki. Saint Demetrius basilica. Interior view from the narthex towards the east.\n\nearthquakes of the 620s, and the only one — since the basilica of the city’s patron saint was literally rebuilt with a different, more sophisticated plan — to have been monumentally restored, acquiring at the same time both galleries and extended annexes. As already suggested, after its monumental restoration in the mid-­seventh century and until the erection of the Hagia Sophia cross-­domed church in the third quarter of the eighth century, the Acheiropoietos basilica held the role of the cathedral of the city for more than a century, and also hosted the administrative services of the episcopate in its northern annexes (Raptis 2017b, 292–301; in press a). These two basilicas were decorated after their erection and/or restoration with mosaics that reflected both of the trends that characterize the art of the period. The conventional and linear rendering of the figures in the seventh-­century votive\n\n31\n\n32\n\nko n s ta n ti n o s t. r ap t i s\n\nFigure 2.12. Thessaloniki. Saint Demetrius basilica. Mosaic decoration: Saint Demetrius with the founders of the basilica.\n\nmosaic panels, depicting Saint Demetrius with secular or ecclesiastical officials (Fig. 2.12) as well as other military, full-­f igured saints such as Saints Nestor, Georgios, Sergius, and Bacchus, that adorn the pillars in his basilica (Mentzos 2010b; Bakirtzis 2012, 158–61, 164–77) are a typical example of the so-­called monastic style of the seventh century. On the other hand, the mosaics preserved in the southern gallery of the Acheiropoietos basilica belong to the second phase of its decoration (Fig. 2.13), which was most probably implemented either in the second half of the seventh or during the first half of the eighth century. Although they follow the icono­graphy of the early Byzantine decorative mosaics that adorn the intradoses of the arches of the main nave of the same basilica, in stylistic terms they find closer parallels to the late seventh century decorative mosaics of the Umayyad Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, which were made by a\n\nFigure 2.13.

On the contrary the Rotunda (Fig. 2.1, 2.3), which due to the seventh-­century earthquakes lost its circular, timber-­roofed, ambulatory, was rehabilitated to a lesser extent, returning to its original type/plan of the single-­shell, centrally planned building, with the exception of its elongated sanctuary apse, which continued to protrude towards the east. During this period urban monasteries for the first time occupied extensive abandoned areas or building complexes of the fortified city, where their facilities, both ecclesiastical buildings like churches and chapels, and secular structures including cells of monks or nuns, were spatially organized within monastic\n\n2. t he ssalo ni k i i n t ransi t i o n (si xt h to ni nt h ce nturies)\n\nprecincts, surrounded and protected by circuit walls. The only known monastery of the transitional period in the upper city is that of Christ Latomos (Figs 2.1, 2.7). It seems that the sixth-­century, cross-­inscribed burial church, after ceasing its function as either a martyrium or mausoleum, became the katholikon of this significant monastery, initially dedicated according to the written tradition to the Prophet Zacharias. During its conversion into a monastic catholicon, the Early Byzantine church underwent several architectural modifications in order to be adapted to the orthodox Liturgy as it was defined after the seventh century; most notable are the narrow doorways for the communication of the presbytery with the two eastern corner compartments, which were converted into the prothesis and the diaconicon (Raptis and Fantidou 2020, 87–89). In the lower city, during the same period, the nunnery of Saint Stephen (Fig. 2.1), where Saint Theodora lived as a nun during the eighth century, occupied a former artisanal and merchantile insula in the centre of the city to the south of the decumanus maximus, while the nunnery of Saint Luke was located near the Kassandreia gate (Fig. 2.1), possibly to the southeast of the Rotunda; both foundations were within walking distances from the Leoforos and the cathedral (Bakirtzis 2007, 107; Raptis 2015, 241, with previous biblio­graphy; 2018, 63–64; Akrivopoulou 2010, 255–56). More monasteries are referred to in the literary sources of the period, such as the monastery of Saint Mark which was founded by a certain layman, called Zacharias, who became a monk and turned his urban property in the north-­western part of the inhabited area of the city into a monastery (Bakirtzis 2007, 107). According to the Life of Saint Gregory of Decapolis, dated to the first half of the ninth century, a stylite was living atop a large late antique column in the western part of the city (Bakirtzis 2007, 105–06). Could the column of the late eighth‒early ninth-­century stylite be the monumental column, known as ‘Yilan mermer’, which was located at the northern end of the cardo on the axis of the main Gate of the Constantinian harbour, and during the early Byzantine period was most probably crowned by the statue of an undetermined emperor? (For more on the ‘Yilan Mermer’ — i.e. marble of the serpent — monumental column, see Stefanidou-­Tiveriou 2015, 65–82). After 732–733, when Illyricum was finally detached from papal influence by Leo III (r. 717–741) (Anastos 1957) and during the iconoclastic period (726–787, 814–842) (Brubaker and Haldon 2011) the city regained its important role in the European lands of the empire. However the only extant building that presents the architectural features and still reflects\n\nFigure 2.14. Thessaloniki. Hagia Sophia cathedral. View from south-­west.\n\nthe art of the iconoclastic period in the city is the transitional cross-­domed church of Hagia Sophia (Figs 2.1, 2.14), which was erected on the site of the ruined early Byzantine episcopal basilica, and from the period of its foundation until its conversion into a mosque in 1523–1524 functioned as the metropolitan church of the city (Theocharidou 1988; 1994, 45–221; Ćurčić 2010a, 257–60; Tourta 2013, 83; Velenis 2018, 62). Even though the foundation of this church has been dated by several scholars from the late sixth to the mid-­eighth centuries, it seems that the new Byzantine cathedral of the city was — most probably — erected during the third quarter of the eighth century (Velenis 1997, 70–77; 2003, 70–71; Velenis 2018, 62), and certainly not before the eighth century restoration/reconstruction of Hagia Eirene in Constantinople, implemented by Constantine V (r. 741–775) after the 740 earthquake (Ćurčić 2010a, 256–57; Brubaker and Haldon 2011, 212–14). Based not only on the Constantinopolitan architectural type but also on its structural techniques, the Hagia Sophia was most probably constructed by Constantinopolitan masons and with imperial funds provided by the Isaurian dynasty (712–802) — possibly by Constantine V himself — in order to emphasize with its Constantinopolitan cross-­ domed architectural form the rule of the Byzantine imperial Christianity over the ecclesiastical affairs of the Illyricum (Cormack 1977b, 35; Raptis in press a; Raptis 2017b, 305) which had been under Papal jurisdiction until 732–733. According to the inscription of its iconoclastic mosaic decoration (Fig. 2.15), which\n\n33\n\n34\n\nko n s ta n ti n o s t. r ap t i s\n\nFigure 2.15. Thessaloniki. Hagia Sophia cathedral. The iconoclastic mosaic crosses on the barrel vault of the sanctuary.\n\nis unfortunately preserved only in the sanctuary barrel vault, the original icono­graphic decoration of the church was financed by the emperor Constantine VI (r. 780–797) and his mother, the empress Irene of Athens (r. 797–802) in the period between 780 and 788, during which the underage emperor was under the regency of his mother (Mavropoulou-­Tsioumi 2012, 248–52; Tourta 2013, 83; Brubaker and Haldon 2011, 295–96). Two more iconoclastic churches of the early ninth century — posterior and less prolific than the cathedral of Hagia Sophia — have been documented by excavation in the city (Fig. 2.1): the one of unidentified type (Evangelidis 1937, 341–51) was possibly a vaulted three-­aisled structure, dedicated according to some scholars to Saint John the Forerunner (i.e. the Baptist) (Theocharidis 1978, 1–26; Ćurčić 2010a, 279–80; Velenis 2018, p. 62) and located close to the Leoforos within walking distance of the cathedral; the other, also undetermined in typo­ logical terms, was located in the lower parts of the upper city, to the northeast of the Saint Demetrius basilica (Makropoulou and Tzitzibasi 1993, 361–64; Tourta 2013, 83). Both churches preserved similar painted decoration depicting the large Latin crosses of the Iconoclastic period (Evangelidis 1937, 341–51. Makropoulou and Tzitzibasi 1993, 362–63). Almost two centuries after the notorious seismic activity of the third decade of the seventh century, another large earthquake hit the city during the reign of Leo V the Armenian (r. 813–820), once again dev-\n\nastating the urban infrastructure and the monuments of the city. Even though this earthquake is attested only in the ‘Narration of Ignatius’, contained in codex 34 of the Eikosifoinissa Monastery, attributed to the twelfth‒thirteenth centuries (Xyngopoulos 1929, 172–78; Pelekanidis 1949; Hoddinott 1963, 178–79) the text itself, according to internal evidence, can be dated back to the end of the ninth century (Cormack 1979a, 159). Notwithstanding the fact that this early ninth-­century earthquake is referred to only once in Byzantine sources, in relation to the ‘miraculous’ (re)appearance of the Theophany mosaic (Fig. 2.8) on the semi-­dome of the apse of the katholikon of the Latomos Monastery (Mastora 2014, 72; Raptis and Fantidou 2020, 75, 87) it seems that it did not significantly affect this small, vaulted, building, since the characteristic ninth-­century reddish — rich in ceramic aggregates — mortar is limited to local masonry repairs and joint fillings (Raptis and Fantidou 2020, 87–88). It is not clear to what extent this earthquake affected the basilica of Saint Demetrius (Figs 2.1, 2.10–2.11), but it is possible that the seventh-­century, five-­aisled, transept basilica acquired its inner galleries within the framework of a ninth-­century restoration. However it is not easy for this hypothesis to be verified, since the Saint Demetrius Basilica in its present state is the result of extensive interventions / reconstructions realized during the first half of the twentieth century. According to more recent research, related to restoration projects of the great churches of the city that have been implemented during the last thirty years, it is attested that the same earthquake greatly affected the Rotunda, the Acheiropoietos basilica, the Hagia Sophia cross-­domed church, and possibly the church of Saint Menas (Fig. 2.1). In Hagia Sophia (Figs 2.1, 2.14) the earthquake mainly affected the large dome of the eighth-­century building and the upper part of the galleries above the north and south wings of the ambulatory. The subsequent restoration of the city’s cathedral, which was carried out by local masons, possibly during the third and fourth decades of the same century, embodies the dome with the heavy cubic drum and a few sections of the upper part of the exterior walls of the church, which has been maintained up to the present (Velenis 2003, 71; 2018, 62; Ćurčić 2010a, 278–79). This phase of the church was previously dated to after the earthquakes of the 620s (Theocharidou 1994, 168–69). It has to be noted again that the drum of the dome was not constructed in this unexpected form due to the inexperience of the masons, but in order to incorporate two built-­in stairs to the eastern corners of the drum, necessary in order for the\n\n2. t he ssalo ni k i i n t ransi t i o n (si xt h to ni nt h ce nturies)\n\nclergy to have access to the exterior of the dome for the ceremony of the bishop’s message and the elevation of the cross on the dome of the cathedral on the feast day of the True Cross (Velenis 2003, 74–79; 2018, 62). During this ceremony, which probably had its origin in the period under question, priests and chanters would ascend to the dome while the bishop stood, along with the officials of the episcopacy and members of the clergy, on the balconies of the Episcopal residence, located to the north of the church. Laymen holding candles attending the ceremony gathered either in the atrium or the public space to the west of the church. Thus the ceremonial service was celebrated with antiphonal chanting between the chanters who were standing on the rooftop of the church, around its dome and the group of priests who were accompanying the Archbishop on the opposite balconies (Gerstel and others 2018, 191). The same earthquake also devastated the Acheiropoietos basilica (Figs 2.1, 2.4–2.5), motivating yet another restoration of the church, which can be dated between the 813–820 earthquake and 842, when the archbishop of the city, Leo the Philosopher delivered his homily in the — probably already restored — basilica on the occasion of the feast day of the Annunciation (Laurent 1964, 281–302). During this period, the upper part of the semi-­c ylinder and the semi-­dome of the apse were reconstructed, and at the same time the Early Byzantine five-­lobed window with marble mullions was redesigned under the architectural influence of the city’s new cathedral as three single-­arched windows, separated by brick-­built piers. Additionally, the eastern corners of the galleries, a large part of the western wall of the narthex, the entire exonarthex, the western gallery, the northern annex, and the ramp-­way to the galleries were reconstructed to a great extent (Raptis 2019c, 126–27). It seems that the early Byzantine church of Saint Menas was also restored during this period, since the building was probably also affected by the same ninth-­century earthquake. The similarities between the sanctuary apse incorporated in the post-­Byzantine church of Saint Menas and the Acheiropoietos basilica are possibly due to their almost synchronous restoration, with three single-­light arched windows according to the model of the apse windows of the Hagia Sophia cathedral. It seems that the Rotunda (Figs 2.1, 2.3) was also ruined during the same period. The damage was concentrated mostly at the eastern part of the building; the earthquake seems to have caused the collapse of the semi-­dome and the upper part of the semi-­ cylinder of the sanctuary apse, which resulted in the destruction of the eastern part of the dome as well.\n\nFigure 2.16. Thessaloniki. Rotunda. Interior view towards the apse.\n\nThus, the upper structure of the large apse, along with the sanctuary barrel vault and possibly the lost part of the dome, were reconstructed during the following period (Fig. 2.3, 2.16) (Theocharidou 1992, 70; Ćurčić 2010a, 279) with brickwork characterized by the extremely reddish mortar of the ninth century. The two flying buttresses of the apse were added during the same period (Ćurčić 2010a, 279) in order to strengthen the construction of the protruding elongated sanctuary, which had initially been designed and added to the cylindrical core of the monument along with the circular ambulatory as a result of the 620s earthquakes. Chrono­logically, the ninth-­century restoration of the Rotunda’s eastern part — a terminus ante quem for the completion of which is provided by the wall painting of the Ascension on the semi-­ dome of its apse (Fig. 2.17), in stylistic terms dated to the end of the ninth or the very beginning of the tenth century (Xyngopoulos 1938, 52), and seems to have followed the almost synchronous restoration\n\n35\n\n36\n\nko n s ta n ti n o s t. r ap t i s\n\nFigure 2.17.

The conversion of the Early Byzantine five-­ lobed window of the Rotunda’s sanctuary apse into five single-­light windows with brick-­built piers obviously imitates the prototype of the cathedral and the already redesigned apse of the Acheiropoietos basilica. However, the higher proportions of these windows in the Rotunda’s ninth-­century apse, when compared to those of the other two monuments, imply that the windows of the Rotunda were designed and constructed a few decades later than the rest (Velenis 2003, 52). Until the end of the ninth century, the only addition to the ecclesiastical architecture of Thessaloniki was the chapel of Saint Euthymios, which was annexed to the east side of the south wing of the transept of the Saint Demetrius basilica (Fig. 2.1), acquiring the form of a small three-­aisled timber-­roofed basilica (Velenis 2003, 8–16; Ćurčić 2010a, 279) probably according to a post-­iconoclastic trend regarding the addition of side chapels in large, pre-­existing churches (Velenis 2018, 64). The inhabitants of the city continued to worship in the great churches of the city that had been restored under the care of the episcopacy, performing their function as important nuclei of the ecclesiastical life of the city. Apart from the aforementioned wall painting of the Ascension (Fig. 2.17) on the semi-­dome of the apse of the Rotunda (Xyngopoulos 1938, 32–53; Tourta 2013, 83; Tsigaridas 2018, 78) during this period the cathedral of Hagia Sophia was adorned once again with mosaics. According to the prevailing theories, the mosaic depiction of the enthroned Virgin with Child (Fig. 2.18), which replaced the iconoclastic cross on the semi-­dome of the apse, has been dated to the middle of the century (Mavropoulou-­Tsioumi 2012, 252–58; Tourta 2013, 83) while the emblematic mosaic Ascension on the dome (Fig. 2.19) has been attributed chrono­logically to the last quarter of the century, c. 880–885 (Mavropoulou-­Tsioumi 2012, 258–90; Tourta 2013, 83; Tsigaridas 2018, 78–79). The mosaic panel of the Virgin with Saint Theodore (Fig. 2.20) in the basilica of Saint Demetrius was probably also created at the end of the period in question (Bakirtzis 2012, 162–63). The second half of the ninth century, after the definitive end of the iconoclastic crisis (726–787, 814–842), was marked by the Christianization of the southern and eastern Slavs and the creation of an alphabet for the Slavic languages by the Thessalonian monks, Cyril and Methodius (Tourta 2013, 84); an act that consolidated the political and religious sovereignty of the Byzantine state in the Balkan Peninsula\n\nFigure 2.20. Thessaloniki. Saint Demetrius basilica. Mosaic decoration: the Virgin with Saint Theodore.\n\nand marked the beginning of the cultural radiance of Thessaloniki in the Slavic world, elevating it to an important geopolitical centre. Archaeo­logical data and sources of the middle Byzantine period document the role of Thessaloniki as the largest city after Constantinople. Trade exchanges at local level, and overseas trade with international characteristics for the period in question, contributed equally to the economic life of the city which developed into the main commercial centre of Illyricum (Raptis 2015, 237–38). The fabled prosperity of the ninth century Thessaloniki, attracted the Saracens of Leo of Tripoli, who besieged Thessaloniki from the less effective sea wall and manag"
