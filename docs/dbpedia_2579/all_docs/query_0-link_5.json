        "text": "Most of the first Jewish rural settlements established in Ottoman Palestine in the late 19 th Century have something in common that has not yet been systematically analyzed. This common factor is their physical location: on low or high ground. Most of the first Jewish settlements were established in plains and valleys for several reasons, while Arab rural settlements were located in the hills and mountains. The paper discusses how Palestinian notables (effendis) who purchase or leased the usufruct rights to state land after the promulgation of the Ottoman Land Code in 1858, subsequently sold all or part of their landholdings in the valleys and plains of Late Ottoman Palestine to Jewish purchasers until the British conquest of Palestine in 1917.\n\nDuring the late Ottoman and British Mandatory periods the cultural and environmental landscape of Palestine changed dramatically. This was reflected in both urban development and rural settlement patterns. In the last decades of Ottoman rule much of the newly settled rural low country of Palestine, including the coastal plain and Jordan valley, was strongly influenced by Bedouin tribes, who were living in various states of mobile pastoralism. By the end of the British Mandate the majority of the Bedouin, with the exception of those living in the Negev in Southern Palestine, had become sedentary in one form or another. The Bedouin actively built about 60 new villages and dispersed settlements, comprising several thousand houses. The Mandate authorities estimated the population of these Bedouin villages to be 27,500 in 1945. Our paper examines who the inhabitants of these Bedouin villages were, tracing them from their nomadic and pastoral origins in the late Ottoman period to their final sedentarization under the British Mandate. We examine how Mandatory land policies and Jewish land purchases created legal and demographic pressures for sedentarization. In shedding light on these intertwined topics we illustrate the increasingly limited role the Bedouin played in the rural landscape due to constraints placed upon them and show how, as a result, their settlement was part of a change in the environment in the period.\n\nThis doctoral dissertation seeks to describe and explain the human factors that influenced the spatial distribution of Arab settlements in the Plain of Sharon and Samaria/Jabal Nablūs (hereinafter: Jabal Nablūs), which together form its area of study (hereinafter: AoS). More specifically, it explores the geographical, social and economic features of the Arab settlements in the AoS between the years 1700 – 1948 CE. In doing so, the study outlines the settlement processes, identifying the places of origin of the settlers and clarifying the circumstances of their arrival in the AoS. Furthermore, it describes the tenurials of land ownership, possession and use at the family, village and regional levels. The work won the Middle East & Islamic Studies Association of Israel (MEISAI)'s 2023 award for outstanding Ph.D. dissertation.\n\nThe following PhD project deals with the Arab settlement processes in the Sharon Plain and Western Samaria during the Late Ottoman and British Mandate Periods. Following two hundred years of demographic decline, in the eighteenth century, these regions experienced a prolonged period of settlement expansion, involving multiple population movements from diverse origins, village formation and abandonment. The precise causes of these transformations have yet to be satisfactorily explained. The state of current research: Traditionalist Israeli scholarship has portrayed the Sharon prior to Zionist colonization as a barren land, dotted here and there by Bedouin tents and a few scattered hamlets. The Zionist project is regarded as the principal source of progress, technological development, and socioeconomic modernization. More recently, other conceptualizations have emerged, describing the region as having significant native populations, or as the prime destination for external migrations from the mountainous hinterland or from other coastal and steppe peripheries. Due to the perceived paucity of accessible native sources, researchers have long relied on Western Travelers' Literature and other foreign sources as a staple for their craft. Over the last decades, however, increased corpora of native evidence became recognized or accessible. These sources contain rich cartographic, archaeological, archival and ethnographic evidence, which still awaits scholarly attention.\n\nThis paper provides a social and geographic account of al-Lajjun (Jenin Sub-district), a prominent Palestinian village during the British Mandate period (1918–1948). It portrays a countryside in renewal, encapsulated in the story of Umm al-Fahm’s expansion and Lajjun’s resettlement. In contrast to existing scholarship, the present work contextualizes the site within the wider diachronic, longue durée, history of the region, and the synchronous, shifting pattern of settlements in Marj ibn ‘Amir (Jezreel Valley), Bilad al-Ruha (Ramot Menashe), and Wadi ‘Ara (Nahal ‘Iron). It focuses on the development of the physical outlines of the (re)new(ed) village, with the development of three “Lajjuns” reflecting its founders’ Hebronite/Khalīlī patterns of settlement. Furthermore, it explores Lajjun’s diversified economy and its metamorphosis from a derelict hamlet into a hub of utilities and transportation infrastructure of regional importance under the British Mandate of Palestine (1920–1948)."
