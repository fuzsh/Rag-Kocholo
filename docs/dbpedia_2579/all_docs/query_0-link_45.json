The plant which in the swampy Lakes did grow, Split into pithy Ribands, broad and fine, Gives unto mortal men the Sheet divine. Then was it first that Friend to distant friend In sweet Exchange fond Messages could send; Then Books found honour: none there was but sought To follow Wisdom and to teach th’ untaught. Papyrus first the Mind of man did whet And many Books spread wider Learning’s net. Jean Imberdis, S.J., Papyrus, 1693, transl. E, Laughton\n\nH1S book is written as an aid to the use of Greek or Latin\n\n| papyri (Latin texts, though not specifically mentioned in the title, are treated throughout on the same footing as Greek). The reader may be textual critic, historian, or intelligent layman whose imagination has been stirred at the idea of making direct contact with the writers of two thousand or so years ago. I hope this guide will help him to find his way about an elusive branch of study, and make his exploration of the originals both more fruitful and more interesting. By setting out what it is useful for a man to know before be begins to use these texts, I hope also that I can save him from putting the wrong sort of questions and drawing unjustified inferences. The aim I have had foremost in mind 1s to facilitate a profitable approach to the originals (in the manner of W. Schubart’s Einfiihrung in die Papyruskunde, Berlin, 1918) rather than to summarize and codify the findings of past scholars. This book will not offer a body of results of the same kind as the magisterial\n\nsurvey of historical, administrative, and juristic knowledge derived from the papyri that is to be found in the Grundziige und Chrestomathie der Papyruskunde of U. Wilcken and L. Mitteis\n\nissued in 1912. Itis doubtful whether a single individual could\n\nnowadays possess the knowledge to survey the whole field\n\nvi Preface accurately, or whether, even if he had it, the result would be of sufficient value to other scholars to justify the time consumed in compiling it. It is partly the success of Wilcken and Mitteis’s great book in codifying the results of investigation that has led to a common interpretation of “‘papyrology’ (Papyruskunde) as ‘a body of knowledge derived from the study of papyri’. It is a one-sided, oversimplified interpretation. What the papyrologist does will, I hope, emerge from a reading of Chapter V. I prefer in consequence not to attempt prematurely to define the bounds of the discipline. I have indeed gone to some lengths to avoid making use of the words “papyrologist’ and ‘papyrology’. They suggest a department of knowledge which is only too easily elevated into a ‘mystique’. A man who wishes to work on Greek or Latin papyri needs no mystical powers. But he does need good eyesight, familiarity with the Greek language, a powerful fund of\n\ncuriosity, and a determination to relate what he finds that is new to the existing stock of knowledge. Add a faculty of critical judgement and a dash of critical scepticism and he will develop into a first-rate scholar. Papyrus itself is one of the most splendid legacies of Egyptian\n\ncivilization to later ages. It is well to pay this tribute now, for in this book when the term ‘papyri’ is used as acollective noun it does notin general include textsin Egyptian hieratic or demotic,\n\nCoptic, Aramaic, Pehlevi, or Arabic, but is applied only to texts in Greek or Latin. Most of these texts belong to the thousand years during which the Greeks occupied Egypt (roughly from Alexander the Great to the eighth century after Christ) and have been preserved by the dry sands of Egypt. Though I exclude from the term writings in other languages, I do include writings on other materials during this period: it is a matter of convenience to use the word ‘papyri’ to cover skins, parchment, vellum, potsherds, wooden boards, etc., indeed all materials carrying writing in ink done by a pen.\n\nTo one article of faith I had better confess in a preface. I have little patience with a common attitude, that literary texts alone are worth the attention of a scholar, and that documentary papyri may be left to a humbler kind of investigator. This dichotomy of the texts from Graeco-Roman Egypt into\n\nliterary and documentary papyri has put scholarship in\n\nPreface vii blinkers. There is not one kind of palaeography that applies to\n\nliterature and one kind that applies to documents. Some of the most precious texts of Greek literature survive only in copies made by scribes whose normal employment was copying\n\ndocuments; probably less than half of the total are written in ‘bookhands’ by scribes who devoted themselves to copying literature and literature only. I hope that Chapters VI and VII will make clear what illumination can be brought to the literary texts themselves by the documents which describe the conditions under which literature was studied and copied. Neither literary man nor documentary scholar has a monopoly of imagination or sensitivity, though it is imagination and sensitivity of\n\na different kind that they employ. To prevent their subject suffering they must try to come to terms with each other.\n\nA second notion I have borne constantly in mind is that at least as many papyrus texts still await an editor as have been published. The opportunities are there for those willing to take them. Consequently I have tried to treat the development of discovery and interpretation as a continuing process. A book such as this should, of course, answer questions; but it should also try to show what kind of questions can be answered and what cannot, and serve as a launching-pad for further investigation. Scholarship moves forward through the work of new generations.\n\nThe book can, I hope, be read straight through if the reader wishes, without recourse to the bibliographical references col-\n\nlected together at the end. They are there because a guide would be of restricted usefulness if it did not indicate what books and articles out of a widely dispersed literature are likely to be most helpful. These bibliographical references have been kept to a minimum: for any particular topic I have chosen as a base a recent discussion which itself subsumes much of the earlier literature. For literary texts ] have (though not consistently) adopted the\n\nplan of referring to them by the number they bear in R. Pack, The Greek and Latin Literary Texts from Graeco-Roman Egypt, 2nd\n\ned., 1965 (abbreviated as Pack?). This method has the advantage of a concise mode of reference both to the text in question and to a fairly full bibliography concerning it; its disadvantage is to interpose a second book between the reader and his quarry.\n\nviii Preface I hope that the searcher will not grow impatient at this procedure. I have it in mind in a later work, which I have provisionally called A Reference Book of Greek Papyri, to compile a\n\nmore extended critical bibliography alphabetically arranged.\n\nIt might start from the index entries of this book, but also contain additional matter, such as a detailed section about provenances, a bibliography on Herculaneum, and perhaps a table of formats of rolls and codices. ‘To supplement the plates in\n\nthis book, I have made a selection. from the papyri discussed and hope to present them in facsimile reproduction in a companion volume, Greek Manuscripts of the Ancient World, which\n\nis now in an advanced stage of preparation. For photographs and for permission to reproduce I should like to thank the Trustees of the British Museum (PI. IV), the Egypt Exploration Society (Pls. V, VII and VIII), the Kelsey Museum of Art and Archaeology, Ann Arbor (Pl. I), Mrs. Raissa Calza and the Fototeca Unione (PI. VI), Mme Semni Karouzou (PI. IT), and Miss Alison Duke and the Mistress and Fellows of Girton College, Cambridge, for Pl. ITI. This book and its companion volume would never have been written had I not enjoyed the opportunity of two periods of residence at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. The greater part of the present volume took its present shape in 1964. The date will explain the choice of illustrative material,\n\nand also its presentation (Pack? was not published till the manuscript was completed). The list of papyrological publications is, I hope, reasonably complete to 31 May 1966. A few items have been added since then, but systematic bibliographical revision has not been possible after that date.\n\nI am grateful to many scholars for their advice and help. Parts of the manuscript were read at an early stage by Professors Cl. Préaux, E. A. Lowe, Dorothy and Homer Thompson, B. D. Merritt, H. C. Youtie, and N. Lewis, and the plan benefited from their criticisms and suggestions. My wife has encouraged and helped me throughout, and lightened my load by making a fresh inspection of library shelves in order to compile the list of papyrus publications. The complete manuscript was read and improved by Dr. J. R. Rea, Mr. C. H. Roberts, and Professor C. B. Welles. The whole book has been read in proof by Dr. Douglas Young, Messrs. E. W. Handley,\n\nPreface ix P. J. Parsons, and by W. E. H. Cockle (to whom I am indebted also for compilation of the index); and sections of proof have been read by Professors A. H. M. Jones and J. A. C. Thomas. The scholarship and attentiveness of these learned men have removed many ambiguities and saved me from many errors. For those that remain I alone am to blame. I have two final acknowledgements to make. The first is to the non-pareil of scholars, Edgar Lobel, from whom I have learned\n\nmore than I can express. A very great deal of what is set out here originates from him. The second is to Sir Harold Idris Bell. In December 1966 he accepted the dedication of this book.\n\nAlas, he has not lived to see it appear. But I inscribe it to his memory with all the reverence and affection in my power. He first revealed to me the value and interest of papyri, taught me to read a papyrus text, and helped me to glimpse what was required to understand it.\n\nE. G.

But papyrus was in use as a writing material much earlier. A blank roll of papyrus for the use of the dead man was discovered in the tomb of the vizier Hemaka at Sakkara of the time of the first dynasty,\n\nthat is, about 3000 B.c.! The earliest fragments of written papyri? are fragments of books of accounts, and they come from a funerary temple of the fifth dynasty, a period which has also left a number of striking statues of seated scribes. ‘They have\n\nalready a long tradition behind them, for their hieratic script, writing simplified forms of the hieroglyphs, can be traced back to the first dynasty. Outside Egypt it is not unlikely that papyrus was used in the second millennium before Christ. In bronze age Crete, where Linear ‘A’ or ‘B’ writing has been preserved only as incisions on\n\nclay tablets or seals, or as painting on jars, papyrus may perhaps have been used for more permanent records. These intricate signs are ill adapted for incision in tacky clay; and sealings from Knossos and elsewhere often contain strands of papyrus,3 as though the object sealed were a papyrus roll wrapped in a string formed by pulling out one of its own fibres. We know from the tale of Wen-Amon‘* that papyrus was exported to Phoenicia. At his request “500 [rolls] of finished papyrus’ were among the goods sent in the twelfth or eleventh century to Zakar-Baal, prince of Byblos, in return for timber. It is precisely from Byblos’ that the Greek word bublos, ‘book’, or “Bible’\n\nwas formed. Moreover, both word and thing may well have been taken over by Greeks in the bronze age: Greek bublos must\n\nhave been based on a Phoenician form Gubla, and W. F. Albright claims that the accent changed from Gubla to Gebdl about 1200 B.c. Yet if papyrus was used by Greeks in the Mycenaean age we have to explain how memory of its use vanished utterly.\n\n814262 B\n\n2 Writing Materials and Books Ivory writing-tablets of the eighth and seventh centuries have been discovered at Nimrud® in Mesopotamia; possibly the Hittites employed them much earlier. On Assyrian monuments rolls can be seen in the hands of counting scribes, though they were perhaps made of skins, the great rival of papyrus as writing material in the early period, even in Greece. The word ‘papyrus’ apparently first appears in cuneiform’ in a text of the Assyrian king Sargon (721-705 B.c.): the term ‘writer-on-skin’ does not occur till the third century B.c. The oldest piece of papyrus to\n\nbe found outside Egypt® (in a cave near Murabba‘at on the Dead Sea) is written in Hebrew and assigned to about 750 B.c. We have no firm evidence as to when papyrus came into general use by Greeks in Greece. It is hard to think that it could be later than the time of Archilochus, that is, the middle of the seventh century B.c.? The Greek scribes no doubt at first sat cross-legged like the Egyptian, supporting the writing surface on the garment tightly stretched across their knees. But they improved on Egyptian methods by writing with a hard reed. This they trimmed and split with a knife, and used as a pen to draw strokes with!° rather than a soft reed to paint with, as their models did. The earliest inks were prepared for use on the day of writing as required—black ink from a dense carbon black (e.g. lamp-black), gum, and water; in palettes that survive in Egypt the ink is in the form of a dried cake; and Demosthenes taunts Aeschines with having to get up early and ‘grind the ink’ when his mother kept school.!! It is salutary for modern technologists to note that the oldest papyrus is also the best made. Papyrus manufactured in the Egyptian Ramesside period, let alone that of the Old Kingdom, is of a miraculous fineness and evenness of texture. Put alongside it a sheet of good quality made in the Ptolemaic period, a thousand years later, and the younger product, though still good, is heavier and thicker. Sheets of the Roman period tend to be clumsier and coarser still; but good standards are maintained till the third century after Christ. Thereafter though fine quality material! appears occasionally, notably in the Berlin and Chester Beatty Manichaean codices, the quality of\n\nordinary papyrus deteriorates rapidly, and ends up by resembling cardboard. In Ptolemaic Egypt we know that the manufacture of the best kinds of papyrus was subject to such\n\nWriting Materials and Books 3 a degree of royal control that the word ‘monopoly’! has (probably rather loosely) been applied to it. Certainly a stereotype of the tall plant stem with its feathery crest was early adopted as a symbol of the Land of Lower Egypt. The plant, in fact, rarely\n\ngrew outside the marshes of this territory. It provided its inhabitants with far more than ‘paper’—fuel, food, medicine, clothes, rugs, sails, ropes, even a kind of chewing gum, were some of the other products derived from it. To manufacture a writing surface’ the rind 1s first removed from a freshly cut piece of the plant’s triangular lower stem. Then thin strips of the underlying substance can be cut—or better, peeled off—in a vertical direction to as long a length as the maker is skilled to handle. These strips are laid on a hard bed just overlapping each other, and all facing the same way, and a second set of strips, placed at a right angle to the first layer, is laid above them. A few blows from a wide-surfaced mallet (a large flat pebble will do) cause these two layers to coalesce firmly without use of gum. The resultant sheet, when dried and polished with pumice, is light in colour, strong, and flexible. It has been made from the plant by purely mechanical means without first turning its material to liquid pulp; but it is as well able to stand folding and rolling as a good modern paper. Many ancient sheets of papyrus still retain something of their original flexibility and light colour. They become brittle and darken in colour after they have been exposed to damp: a surface that has been repeatedly wet and dried will disintegrate at a touch. Happily most ancient papyrus fragments are still fairly robust. The process just described is that successfully used by Mr. S.\n\nBaker in the British Museum in 1964 to produce a sheet of papyrus. The account given by the elder Pliny's adds refinements to it: no doubt the ancient craftsmen accumulated a stock of ‘know-how’ which has not yet been entirely recovered. The manufactured sheet does not require to be treated with size in order to take ink. The ancients speak of the application of ‘cedar oil’ as a preservative, and a brilliant yellow patina to be seen in some surviving texts, a patina which admirably sets off the ink, seems to be due to treatment ofa kind not yet fully understood.'®\n\nPliny adds a table of the standard sizes of sheet!” and their trade names in his day. They ranged from Augusta, ‘13 digits\n\n4 Writing Materials and Books wide’ (nearly 10 inches), to emporetica, ‘not more than six digits’ (about 4°5 inches). The sheets were immediately pasted together\n\n: to form rolls, a common number (Pliny wrongly says it was never exceeded) being twenty sheets'® to a roll. From such\n\n| a roll pieces could be cut to write a letter or invitation. Or if the roll was not long enough, additional pieces or even a second roll could be pasted on, so that your roll could be as long or as short as you cared to make it. But it is worth emphasizing that the manufacturer’s and retailer’s unit is the made-up roll, and that the Greek word ydprnc, Latin charta, does not mean a sheet but a roll. Seen through a microscope, a section cut across the stem of the papyrus plant reveals a number of dark-walled vascular bundles growing in a matrix of light-coloured pith cells. When the strips are hammered to form sheets, the pith is crushed and the vascular bundles are impacted into each other: they may join together, part again, or criss-cross. It is these impacted bundles which show up 1n the finished sheet as ‘fibres’, and their\n\npeculiar grouping or colouring may help a scholar to reconsti-\n\np. 62). |\n\ntute a page out of a mass of torn fragments (see Chap. V, Each sheet, it will be recollected, consists of two layers. In one of them the fibres will run in a horizontal direction, in the other in a vertical direction. If the sheet is well made there will be little difference in the smoothness and finish of the two sides; one side may be given a higher degree of polish than the other.\n\nWhether the fibres run with the direction of the writing or against it, in such a sheet there will be little resistance to the pen. Indeed, for a time in the early Ptolemaic period documents (i.e. sheets cut from a roll) were regularly written across the fibres; and similarly for a time in the Byzantine age. The custom has grown up of calling the side which looks smoother and which one would expect to be used first the recto, the other\n\nside the verso. Such a definition is a misuse of terms. When applied to Greek and Latin papyri the terms recto and verso should only be used in connexion with rolls: the recto is that side\n\nof a roll in which the fibres run horizontally (that is, along the length of the roll), and it is the inside; the verso is that side on which the fibres run vertically (that is, across the length of the roll), and it is the outside.!9 An ancient book roll is not written\n\nWriting Matercals and Books 5 from top to bottom of its length, as is a medieval scroll; it is written in a series of independent columns perpendicular to its length and beginning at the left-hand end of the roll. As the scribe writes (and the reader reads) he will roll up the used portion with his left hand and unroll more papyrus with his right. Now what is placed inside a roll is, of course, better protected against accident than what is outside, and the horizontal fibres placed inside are subject to less strain and less danger of tearing\n\nthan if they were on the outside. The sheets, moreover, are gummed together on the assumption that the inside of the roll will carry the writing. If two sheets are pasted together, one must inevitably be slightly higher than the other. The ancient manufacturer contrived his joins on the inside of the roll to make a series of easy steps down;?° the scribe’s pen, travelling from left to right, would, as it were, travel downhill. In a well-\n\nmade roll these joins are managed with great care. Usually there is an overlap of one to two centimetres. They are then smoothed over after pasting and cannot normally be detected on the back of a roll. One sheet only in a roll does not obey this\n\nrule, the first: it was usually gummed with its inside fibres running vertically. It was called protocollon; our “protocol’ derives from the authentication written here in Byzantine times. Earlier it was usually left blank to serve as a guard. The Greek word for a sheet forming part of a roll is kollema; selis, Latin pagina, is applied to the column of writing, which may at times be so wide as to extend over two or even three sheets. One would expect the kollemata in a good literary roll to be of approximately equal sizes, but the papyrus restorer should be warned that such is not always the case.?! It is worth empha-\n\nsizing that when all that survives is a single piece cut out of a roll, unless the gummed joins are retained, it is hardly possible to decide absolutely which side was first used for writing. A very common way of preparing a letter for delivery was to\n\nroll up the sheet to make a cylinder, pull out a fibre from the back, wrap the latter round the cylinder, and fix it in position with a lump of clay on which one impressed one’s seal. There were times in the ancient world when papyrus was relatively inexpensive.?? In the lavishly equipped government offices of the early Ptolemaic period an enormous amount of it was consumed: an account of 258-257 B.c. reveals that certain\n\n6 Writing Materials and Books departments of the auditor’s and secretary’s section of the prime\n\nminister Apollonius’ bureau used 434 rolls in 33 days. Nevertheless, even upper-class individuals would often emulate ‘paper-\n\nsparing Pope’ and write on the back of a sheet or roll already used for other purposes. At times, also, a man would go to the trouble of washing out the writing with a sponge, and then reusing the surface; the procedure is parallel to the scraping of parchment for reuse as a palimpsest.?3 For schoolboys, Roman soldiers, poor priests (in Christian Egypt), and tax collectors a serviceable material was offered by a fragment of broken pottery, an ostracon; or even a flat piece of limestone, much favoured by draughtsmen for pen trials. Other\n\nmaterials had their particular uses—lead, for example, on which to write and then bury curses on an enemy, defixiones.4 Linen mummy wrappings may carry writing, usually at least the identification of the dead. The most famous such wrapping is one in the museum at Zagreb inscribed in Etruscan characters.25 Materials such as bark or palm-leaves may be neglected here. But the schoolboy’s slates”® of fifth-century Athens should be mentioned: they are slabs of peculiar form, of slate-like stone,\n\nirregularly shaped, and pierced with a hole for suspension. The letters have been scratched on them with a sharp instrument. Among the commonest of materials is wooden board. It may\n\nbe used plain, shaped, for instance, into a tabula ansata (the common mummy?’ label bearing the name, father’s name, and age of the dead is like such a tablet cut in half and its end pierced). The surface may be prepared in various ways, as in\n\nthe tablets of the sixth century B.c. found in a cave near Sicyon,?° which were covered with white slip and then brilliantly\n\npainted. For whitening a common preparation was made from gypsum, and onsucha whitened board (leukoma, album) Athenians\n\nexhibited notices and Egyptians did their homework. Another way of treating the wood was to hollow out the centre (or make\n\na frame at the edges) and fill this area with coloured wax (maltha): such boards (deltoz) were from early times made in sets,\n\nhinged on a ring or a leather thong. They are implied in Homer’s story of the ‘folded tablet’ which Proetus gave to Bellerophon, or in Herodotus’ version of the secret intelligence conveyed to Greece during the Persian wars.29 They were used, above all, for first drafts, and therefore the deltos is often put as\n\nWriting Materials and Books 7 his symbol by the poet; but they can carry all kinds of memo-\n\nranda, letters, and exercises. Perhaps the earliest surviving example is a set of the third century B.c. from [llahun in Egypt3° recording expenses on a journey. Their wax was often coloured\n\nred. The wax could be scratched with the pointed end of a stylus, smoothed with its blunt end. Such texts, being ‘inscribed’\n\nrather than ‘written’, strictly should fall within the province of Greek or Latin inscriptions. Happily there need be no demarcation disputes. They would in any case be difficult to resolve, for there are added complications: in some cases the wax has disappeared and the writing can still be read because the stylus scratched the underlying wood; in others the wax was never run on (or was not renewed at the proper time) and the scribe has written in ink directly on to the wood. The term for a set of tablets such as this is diptych for one ‘of two folds’, triptych for ‘of three folds’, polyptych ‘of many folds’ (ten is the largest known\n\nnumber), and codex in Latin. A dossier of several polyptychs\n\nassembled in a kind of carrying case fitted with a handle is termed ‘codex ansatus’.3!\n\nFrom the codex made of hinged wooden tablets there was eventually to develop the codex of folded sheets of papyrus or parchment:3 a book in modern form, contrasted with a ‘volume’, volumen, a book roll. For Plato and for Cicero a book (bublos, biblion, volumen) was a roll of papyrus. It was inconvenient, impermanent, and not very capacious. As we have seen, two hands were needed to hold it open, to wind it so that its narrow columns of writing should always be within the reader’s angle of vision,\n\nand after use to rewind it. Its title, if written on a stuck-on tag of papyrus, parchment, or skin (szdlybos),33 was liable to tear away. he whole roll, even if protected by rollers3+ (which have rarely survived), was vulnerable. Athenian vase-paintings35 show readers getting into difficulties with a twisted roll, and the aged Verginius Rufus broke his hip while trying to collect up one he\n\nhad dropped.?¢ It is of interest to note that very many of our surviving literary rolls are torn vertically down the centre of a column. Estimates of its length of life37 can only be guesses. Galen speaks of handling rolls 300 years old. A roll of Pindar from Oxyrhynchus, written in the first century after Christ, was, to judge from patches on its back, some of which carry writing of the fourth century, still being read 300 or so years\n\n8 Writing Materials and Books later. But we do not know how far this was an exceptional case.\n\nAs for contents, one play of a tragedian, two or three short books of Homer were all that its one written side would hold. It did not encourage careful scholarship. Anyone who has tried to consult a dictionary contained in microfilm will sympathize with an ancient writer’s reluctance to check his references or his tendency to take his metrical and grammatical examples out of an author’s opening verses. By the time of Augustine, however, a ‘book’ (codex, cwudriov) has come to mean very nearly the object with which we are familiar: sheets of parchment folded\n\nat the spine, put together quire by quire, stitched, and protected by wooden binding boards. A codex could lie open on a reader’s desk and one hand could turn its pages backwards and forwards with ease; its pages could be written on both sides, and its total contents could hold four or five times as much text as a roll; it was stout and sturdy with a prospect of long life. In the change of format the substitution of skins for papyrus is\n\nnot the crucial feature. Apart from the fact that papyrus itself frequently, one might almost say regularly, forms the material of the earliest surviving codices (though this use may perhaps be restricted to Egypt), skins of one sort or another had long been in use in the East as carriers of writing. The oldest surviving text on skin (it is described as ‘leather’) is said to be a roll of the Egyptian twelfth dynasty preserved in Berlin. Ctesias says that ‘royal hides’ (BactAucat didfépar) were used by\n\nthe Persians for their historical records, and his statement is vindicated by a fifth-century archive written on ‘leather’, that of\n\nthe Persian satrap of Egypt, “Arsam, which was published in 1954.38 When found it wasstill in its protecting leather bag. When more space was required than was offered by a single skin, several\n\nwere sewn together to form a roll. The famous Qumran scrolls (of ‘leather’) are set out exactly like Greek book rolls except that the Hebrews work from right to left. Greek texts on ‘parchment’ and in several cases in roll form3° are preserved from Hellenistic and Parthian Dura-Europus, and even from Egypt.\n\nIt will be seen that there is an uncertainty of terms here— ‘leather’ and ‘parchment’ seem to be used interchangeably in the description of these texts. No doubt the materials are difficult to distinguish—when they are much damaged and\n\nWriting Materials and Books 9 needing extensive preservative treatment, perhaps only laboratory technicians are able to tell the difference. ‘The processes of\n\nmanufacturing leather and parchment go hand in hand up to a pointt°—the skins must be preserved if not worked on at once, must be washed and soaked, cleansed of flesh and hair, and limed. Thereafter ‘leather’ is made by tanning, i.e. soaking the skin with a vegetable matter containing tannin; parchment by tawing, that is, dressing it with alum, and dusting with sifted chalk.#! By convention the term ‘parchment’ is used for the skins of sheep and goats, ‘vellum’ being reserved for the finer skins of\n\ncalf and kid. The best kind of all is that derived from newly born or even still-born lambs (hence its title ‘uterine vellum’). Antelope skin, which Tischendorff claimed as the material of the specially fine vellum of the Codex Sinaiticus, probably represents a descriptive flight of fancy on the part of its author.\n\nIt is in this perspective that the much disputed notice of Varro, preserved by Pliny, W.H. xii. 11, should be viewed. Varro asserted that “papyri (chartae) were ‘invented’ in Egypt at the time of Alexander the Great, and ‘parchments’ (membranae) were invented at Pergamum by an Eumenes of the Attalid\n\ndynasty, in answer to an embargo placed by the king of Egypt on the supply of papyrus to a rival. Both ‘inventions’ are clearly false. Is there anything more in the story than that Pergamum had (presumably in the time of Eumenes II, 197-159 B.c.) to make do with skins? Varro’s credit has been hotly defended by those who point to the use of the adjective derived from Pergamum—fergamena charta, wepyapnvy (sc. dip8épa) or mrepyapnvov\n\n—as the regular term for parchment. This adjective 1s not recorded till Diocletian’s price edict of A.D. 301.42 One might speculate on whether this adjective owes its currency to the\n\ndevelopment of parchment manufacture at Pergamum (in which case the adjective would have arisen in the same sort of\n\nway as our word ‘china’), or whether its currency may be based on Varro’s notice. The earlier Latin word for parchment is membrana, Greek éi¢6épa. Alternative defences of Varro are\n\nthe suggestion that the story reflects an improvement in the technique of preparing the skins, e.g. in scraping, smoothing, and stretching, or else in concentrating on the finer kinds of skins. Others have held that the supposed improvement in technique now for the first time allowed both sides of the skin\n\n10 Writing Materials and Books (i.e. both ‘hair’ side and ‘flesh’ side) to carry writing, and such a view would be helped if membranae in Pliny’s account were interpreted, as C. H. Roberts shows it should be in the majority of examples, as ‘parchment notebooks’. Unfortunately there is no evidence for this ‘improvement’. Two of the many Greek\n\nparchments from Dura-Europus are assigned to the second century before Christ. One of them (P. Dura 15) is described as\n\n‘excellent parchment’, and it has been assigned on palaeographical grounds to the first half of the second century B.c. (it is certainly later than 190/189 B.c.). Did it come from Perga-\n\nmum? We may note that it is thought to be part of a stitched roll, and certainly has no writing on its back. Firm ground for a history of the development and date of the codex form has been won only slowly and painfully. The change\n\nin our view of it has come not only from the accumulation of examples, but from a slowly increasing confidence in the earlier\n\ndating of the handwriting of important examples. It is, of course, a tricky matter to judge a date only on the basis of the writing. For long it was held as a dogma that codices did not exist before the fourth century after Christ, and that papyrus made up in codex form was a freak, so used by poor men at a late date in imitation of parchment. In spite of the general view, F. G. Kenyon right from the beginning dated a parchment codex of Demosthenes in the British Museum (Pack? 293)\n\nto the second century A.p., W. Schubart a leaf of a small-size parchment codex of Euripides’ Cretans (Pack? 437) to the same time, and Grenfell and Hunt pioneered a relatively early dating of examples of codices, though they tended (under the influence of the dogma) to date the handwriting later than they would have if it had been on a roll. It is possible that the pendulum\n\nhas now swung too far, and that the modern tendency is to date new examples too early. But the anchor of the view now widely held is on good holding ground, and is supported by sufficient examples for which there is some measure of objective dating. It is possible, none the less, that the general picture may have to be revised in detail as new examples come forward. In 1955, when C. H. Roberts published his persuasive account\n\nof the growth of the codex, he pointed out that no early text of\n\nthe Greek New Testament known to us was written on the recto of a roll. Of the 111 examples of biblical manuscripts\n\nWriting Matertals and Books 11 in Greek then known which were dated before the end of the fourth century A.D., 99 were codices; of this total, such as were Christian in origin and could be assigned to the second century or the borderline between the second and the third centuries were\n\nall codices made of papyrus. He writes as follows: “When the Christian bible (to use a slightly anachronistic term) first makes its appearance in history, the books of which it is composed are always written on papyrus and in codex form.’ Since 1955, numerous new examples of Christian literature, some of them of\n\nearly date, have come to light in Egypt, but this statement is still true. Equally valid, I believe, though I have not reworked the figures,+3 is his statement of the completely different relation-\n\nship between roll and codex when used for classical (i.e. pagan) literature in Greek. In 1955 the tabulation stood as follows:\n\nand cent. 465 rolls 11 codices (2°31 %)\n\nand/3rd cent. 208 ,, 6s, (2:9%) grd cent. 207 55 60_—C t=, (16-8%) grd/4th cent. 28, 26s, (48-14%) 4th cent. 25» 70 oy (73°95 Zo) Of the eleven codices of Greek literature assigned to the second\n\ncentury, two are on parchment (one may also add one Latin codex on parchment), of relatively small size and written in tiny\n\nhands; the rest are made of papyrus. The latter include a philosophical manual, a medical treatise, a medical text, and two grammatical manuals. Roberts comments: ‘the high proportion of technical or professional texts is worth noting, as 1s the fact that several of the others are clearly designed to pack as much text as possible into the available space.’\n\nTo account for these facts Roberts offers a suggestive hypothesis. Noting the distinction in linguistic usage between Latin membrana singular as the material and membranae plural as ‘notebooks made of parchment’, he brings evidence for the use\n\nof such parchment notebooks by lawyers and businessmen. It was in a society of merchants and small traders that John Mark moved at Rome. Aware of the Jewish habit of writing Rabbinic teachings on tablets or ‘smooth surfaces’ he transferred to the parchment notebooks his account of the sayings of Jesus. A gospel once circulating in this format determined, partly by way of\n\nauthority, partly by way of sentiment and symbol, that the proper form for the Christian scriptures was a codex, not a roll.\n\n12 Writing Materials and Books Classical literature followed suit, slowly and perhaps at first for economic reasons. When the codex form was finally established, certain regular principles for its make-up eventually ousted the widely varying\n\nmethods used in the experimental period. It will usually be found in parchment or vellum codices that the leaves are laid hair side to hair side, flesh side to flesh side.44 F. G. Kenyon argued that this is the natural result of folding a large skin first vertically, then horizontally, and then perhaps vertically again; but the result is also pleasing in that it minimizes differences in colour between the two sides of the skin. If in the folding just described the skin is cut at the first and second fold (which will give 4 sheets—4 separate skins could of course be used), when the\n\nmass is folded again a gathering of 8 leaves or 16 pages will result. This unit, 16 pages = 8 leaves = 4 sheets, a quaternio (English ‘quire’, Greek rezpadiov), settles down eventually as\n\nthe standard form of assembly. But others are found: for instance, P.S.I. 1182 (a fine parchment codex of Gaius) groups its sheets in quinternions (10 leaves, 20 pages), an arrangement found -\n\nalso in the biblical Codex Vaticanus and the Bembinus of\n\nTerence. Such variations suggest that the successive folding of a skin is not the reason why hair side faces hair side, flesh side flesh; and that the gatherings were formed of pieces already cut to size. The variations may some day supply a clue to the scriptoria in which these manuscripts were written; as may also the order of flesh and hair side, whether the flesh or the hair side is on the outside of the quire—for both systems are found. GC. R. Gregory indeed laid down as a rule that the first and last pages and the central opening of a gathering display the flesh side of\n\nthe vellum. This rule applies in the East; but in Latin manuscripts and in western Europe the hair side is usually found on the outside. Before beginning to write, the scribe would rule each sheet (on one side) with a dry point, having fixed the framework of his lines by pricking right through the assembled quires so as to keep his text sitting in the same relationship to its margins on every page throughout the manuscript. When written the quires would be stitched internally and bound. It is likely that the increasing use of iron compounds as a basis for making ink is connected with the replacement of papyrus by skin; the free acid of the chemical ink acted as a mordant.\n\nWriting Materials and Books 13 The experiments which preceded this crystallization of practice may now be followed in detail in the many surviving papyrus codices, which show the most diverse methods of make-up. One method, practised for a long time in spite of its disadvantages, was to form a book out of a single quire of a large number of superimposed sheets (just as children form a notebook for themselves). ‘Two examples of this construction may be shortly described here. One is a papyrus codex containing the Gospels of Luke and John, P. Bodmer xiv—xv (I175), assigned by its\n\neditor to A.D. 175-225, and not likely to be later than the third century. What now survives is Luke ui. 18 to the end of Luke and John i to xv. The last words of Luke end on p. 87 (calculation, for the scribe did not write the page numbers), followed by end-title of Luke, initial-title of John, and first lines, all on the same page. It can be calculated that the total number\n\nof pages was 144, i.e. 36 sheets. As an example of a codex of classical literature we may note the book*s containing Iliad xi. 86—xvi. 499 now in the Pierpont Morgan Library (Pack? 870), which its editors date to ¢. A.D. 300. Its pages are numbered, and\n\nthe sheet containing pages 61-64 is in the middle: its total size can therefore be calculated at 124 pages, 31 sheets. In order that\n\nthe leaves should lie in a clean straight edge when shut, the inner leaves are not so broad as the outer (page width 12:5 centimetres®gainst 14 centimetres), a result probably achieved by trimming the fore-edge after the sheets had been folded.*° It seems not unlikely that the Bodmer codex including Menander’s\n\nDyskolos*7 was also a single-quire codex, though its editor formed a different view of its make-up. A book made up in this way, even if stiffened internally with\n\nbands of parchment, is liable to tear or break at the spine. Moreover, it is not easy to see into the middle pages alongside the fold. An improved method of make-up is to form the book of separate gatherings, which can then be secured by horizontal straps which pass through the vertical threads and are pasted to\n\nthe binding boards. The number of sheets included in these gatherings varies. The Chester Beatty codex of the gospels and Acts (II45) is made up of a succession of single-sheet quires.\n\nThe Chester Beatty Genesis has quires of 5 sheets, Chester Beatty Enoch quires of 6 sheets. P. Bodmer ii, a St. John in square format of perhaps A.p. 200 (II®), consists of quires\n\n14 Writing Materials and Books containing a varying number of sheets: 5, 4, 1, 5, 5, 8 according to V. Martin’s reconstruction. There are similar variations between 4- and 5-sheet quires in the seventh-century Heidelberg codex of the Minor Prophets; on parchment, in the Freer codex\n\nin Washington, the quires range from 4 to 8 sheets. It seems, however, that for papyrus as for parchment, 4 sheets became a regular number for a quire: we meet this number in the Cairo codex of Menander (Pack? 1301, fifth century), or Origen’s Dialogue with Heraclides (Pack? p. 58, sixth century).\n\nIn a number of these papyrus codices (e.g. in P. Bodmer ii,48\n\nthe early St. John codex) it is possible to trace the prickings which delimited the written area and kept it even throughout the book. But it does not seem that papyrus was ruled: traces of such ruling are rare. In other volumes no such pricking was undertaken: or else it was not adhered to. In P. Bodmer xiv—xv, which begins with Luke and continues with John, it is possible to trace the progressive realization by the scribe that he would not succeed in getting in the whole of John unless he crowded more on to his page and wrote his letters smaller and in a longer line.\n\nThe holes for the binding threads can also be observed in a number of cases, and sometimes the binding actually survives. Some early bindings in the Chester Beatty collection studied by Mrs. B. Regemorter consist of wooden boards, often hollowed\n\nout as if they were intended as wax tablets, coveréd in leather tooled to simple geometric shapes. Some early bindings in the British Museum have been studied by Mr. T. C. Lamacraft; some of the Coptic books from Nag Hammadi still retain their bindings. P. Bodmer xvii, of the sixth or seventh century, has an\n\nouter binding wrapper of tooled, supple leather, backed by cardboard (made out of old papyrus) and coarse canvas.‘9\n\nA counterpart to the alternation of flesh and hair sides in a parchment manuscript is offered by the fact, as we have already noted, that in a sheet of papyrus the fibres run in a horizontal direction on one side and a vertical direction on the other. It has perhaps been natural to use the terms ‘recto’ and ‘verso’ for these two sides of a sheet: but seeing that in codex terminology recto properly means the right-hand of two facing pages, it is desirable that terms involving such ambiguities be entirely avoided.®° If then a scholar wishes to indicate those pages\n\nin a papyrus codex in which the fibres run vertically, he should\n\nWriting Materials and Books 15 either use this full phrase or utilize as convenient shorthand an\n\narrow facing downwards |; similarly for ‘page in which the fibres run horizontally’ either the full phrase should be used, or else an arrow facing horizontally —. The sheets of which a papyrus codex is formed may, of course, easily be so large that they need to be made of two gummed sheets. In such a case the\n\njoin clearly cannot fall in the middle of the leaf at the point of fold. It will very commonly be found in the middle or towards the edge of the left-hand — page. H. Ibscher has observed 5! of a number of codices in Berlin that they were made of sheets of papyrus cut from a blank roll. But not all papyrus codices cannibalized rolls for their material (cf. also p. 53). The maker of a papyrus codex has a choice between placing his sheets all the same way up or making their horizontal and vertical fibres alternate. If he chooses the former method, when the sheets are folded there will be an alternation of | and > on facing pages; in the latter case, facing pages will be homogeneous, both -—> or both |. P. Bodmer xiv-xv (Luke and John) is an example of the former procedure, P. Bodmer 1 (John) an example of the latter. Sometimes, however, there may be further variations on this basic system. For instance, the\n\nmaker of the Crosby codex at MississippiS? (a single-quire codex) laid his eight outermost leaves with their horizontal fibres downwards (outside), then from folio 9 to the centre of the book he reversed the order. If then a codex has come to pieces, and no leaves survive in their conjugate form, it may be difficult to reconstruct the codex. Codices of papyrus will normally have held less than codices\n\nof parchment. We may contrast the Pierpont Morgan Iliad (described on p. 13 above), which contained Jliad xi-xvi, that is, not more than a third of the whole poem, with P. Ryl. 1. 53 (Pack? 1106), a more or less contemporary parchment codex, which (on the evidence of quire numberings) probably held the whole Odyssey. The Bodmer codices on papyrus held not more than one or two gospels each; the longest of the Chester Beatty New Testament papyrus codices held the four gospels and Acts; but the Codex Sinaiticus on parchment held the whole Bible and the Old ‘Testament Apocrypha in one original bound volume.53\n\nOur surviving manuscripts, which include such magnificent examples as the biblical Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus\n\n16 Writing Materials and Books assigned to the fourth century or the Vatican Dio Cassius assigned to the fifth, make it clear that by this date the parchment codex has replaced the papyrus roll as a luxury book: one written with loving calligraphy, on which no expense is spared. The narrow-column format is no doubt taken over from the best papyrus manuscripts of the Greek orators and historians. Vellum may occasionally be used for something of less prestige, e.g. in documents such as those of the second century from Murabba‘at (D.7.D. ii), or of the Byzantine age from Egypt (P. Oxy. 1720, areceipt for payment of the price of 110 jars of wine). But in general esteem vellum is considered superior to papyrus.\n\nIn a.p. 376 Basil’s fellow clergy did not think it proper for him to send to a brother bishop a copy of his treatise on the Holy\n\nSpirit written on a papyrus roll, and claimed the latter had given orders that it should be written on vellum5+ (Letter 231, to Amphilochius, Bishop of Iconium). The author of the Epigrammata Bobiensia in about A.D. 400 apologizes for writing on fibres\n\nof papyrus from the Nile, Niloticae fibris papyri: fair copies should be ‘worthy of pages of parchment’, pergamenis digna pagints.\n\nNone the less, papyrus rolls were still being used occasionally\n\nin the sixth century to carry literary work. And papyrus continued to serve as the principal material for documents, letters, and accounts. In Egypt there are considerable archives in Greek on papyrus written during the Arab domination, at the end of the seventh and beginning of the eighth century.55 Outside Egypt papyrus is still the regular standby for letters and documents. Augustine, writing to Romanianus in the fifth century (P.L. xxxilil. 80), apologizes for having to make do with vellum instead of papyrus. A whole series of documents, sales, contracts, etc. from the Ravenna archives or scriptoria in Italy still survive, dating from the fifth century to the tenth and later.\n\nPapyrus was in regular use by the papal chancery till the eleventh century at least.5° The last extant papal bull on papyrus is dated a.D. 1057, but there are references to papyrus later\n\nthan that. The material was, apparently, still being manufactured in Egypt in the tenth and eleventh centuries. Its supersession by paper does not belong to the province of this book.\n\nIl THE REDISCOVERY OF PAPYRUS N idea of some power in human history has been that of\n\nA the reappearance of the heroes of an earlier day: King\n\nArthur will return when needed from Lyonesse; in a cave\n\nin Thuringia sleep Frederick Hohenstaufen and his knights awaiting the trumpet call that will summon them to rescue their harassed posterity. The discovery of 800 ancient papyrus rolls at Herculaneum in 1752 seemed to promise that the wisdom of the ancients would help the modern world in a similar way. Papyrus as a writing material had in fact passed so far out of\n\nthe experience of ordinary men that the Latin word was then in common use for paper. It is Latin usage of the later Middle Ages! and more especially of the Renaissance that has given the word ‘paper’ to modern Europe. When Father Imberdis in 1693 composed in Latin his didactic poem on the art of papermaking (from which a few lines were quoted in the preface, p. v) he felt no qualms in applying the word ‘papyrus’ to the modern product. Since paper was unknown to ancient Rome, there was no precise term available for medieval writers to use, and antiquarian fashion adopted ‘papyrus’. It is a fashion based on a false interpretation of the ancient writers. Regularly in conscientious ancient Latin authors, and without exception in Greek authors, ‘papyrus’ means the plant or its products (see p- 3), and is used for the writing material only by a figurative extension of meaning. Antiquarians, however, knew and puzzled over their Pliny (already discussed on p. 3). A few archivists and chancellors were aware of the medieval documents on papyrus among their records. One or two sixteenth-century humanists chanced on small pieces of this material bearing writing of the late imperial\n\nage and described them with interest as curiosities.2 The rediscovery of the ancient written word of Graeco-Roman civiliza-\n\ntion was to come late in the history of the Renaissance.\n\n814262 Cc\n\nThe finds of papyrus rolls at Herculaneum? were made\n\n18 The Rediscovery of Papyrus fourteen years after excavations began on this town buried in ash during the eruption of Vesuvius in a.p. 79. They stirred the imagination of contemporaries: Winckelmann described them with enthusiasm, George IV of England contributed a scholar’s salary to help the decipherment of the rolls. Alas, they were ‘carbonized’, that is, turned into hard masses by decomposition, by the action of water and damp and the hardening of the tufadeposit. They could not be unrolled. The best that could be done was to break through the crust and detach single thicknesses of the original, reconstitute the pieces, and copy them by holding them obliquely to the light so that the iridescence of the ink might stand out from the blackened background. They proved to be a library of the Epicurean school of philosophy. In 1966 there is a hope that new technical methods may permit the unrolling of more of this find, and make it worth while to search under the tufa for further ancient libraries. In Europe and most of the countries bordering on the Mediterranean, writing materials are unlikely to resist the onset of damp unless they are protected in libraries. It is only in special conditions—under the ‘terracotta skin’ at Derveni,*+ the tufa cover of Herculaneum—that they will survive. But in Egypt, parts of Palestine, and Mesopotamia the climate is not hostile to long life. Away from the Delta and the coastal belt in Egypt rain does not fall in any appreciable quantity. Papyrus books, parchment books, wooden tablets all have an excellent chance of survival even in ordinary ground, provided they are not too close to the surface and not so far down that they grow damp from water rising from below. If papyri can have the protection of a cave, a jar, or a ruined building there are many places where they can remain intact, outside as well as inside Egypt. From the sixteenth century onwards a sprinkling of travellers visited Egypt and the Nile valley. James Bruce,’ who in 176870 reached the headwaters of the Blue Nile, purchased two codices on papyrus at Medinet Habu, one Greek, one Coptic, containing Gnostic writings. But his finds made less stir than\n\nthe papyrus roll sent in 1778 as a gift to Cardinal Stefano Borgia. A Dane, Nicholas Schow, wrote the story of its discovery ten years later.© An unknown merchant (‘negotiator quidam’) was offered at a low price a bundle of forty or fifty papyrus rolls. ‘They were said to have been found underground\n\nThe Rediscovery of Papyrus 19 (‘in loco quodam subterraneo’) in the ‘town’ of Giza, hidden in a container of sycamore wood. The traveller bought one\n\nonly: the rest were torn up by the Turks (“Turcae’), who enjoyed their aromatic odour. Schow implies that they set fire to them. The details of the story have been suspected by critics: they seem to resemble the story of the Sibylline books, and it is said that other eighteenth-century travellers told similar tales. Whether papyrus when burned has an aromatic odour is a question answered with a definite ‘no’ and an equally definite ‘yes’ by those who claim to have tried it. The former answer was given by Grenfell and Hunt in 1900: the latter by N. Lewis in 19347 (who also points to the Roman custom of burning papyrus\n\nmaterial on the funeral pyre in support of his claim). The roll itself, however, is not to be dismissed. It is now to be seen in the\n\nVatican Museum. To Niels (latinized as Nicholas) Iversen Schow belongs the honour of wrestling with a new kind of Greek cursive script and editing the first documentary text on papyrus. But instead of containing the wisdom of the ancients this three-and-a-halfmetre-long roll® carries a list of the men of the village of Ptolemais Hormou liable for dyke corvée at Tebtynis in the Fayyam in the year A.D. 192.\n\nThe publication came as an anticlimax. Great expectations (those of Goethe included) were once again disappointed. In Mozart’s Magic Flute (written in 1791) we can still feel how the\n\nlate eighteenth century hoped to find in the wisdom and ritual\n\nof Egypt a new and satisfying answer to the mystery of life itself. Egypt had so far remained withdrawn, a land of secrets. But wonder and curiosity are good starting-points for scholarship. An enduring effect of Napoleon’s imaginative Eastern campaigns was to throw Egypt open to the West. Though\n\nNapoleon’s hold on Egypt lasted a bare three years (he evacuated it in 1801), in his train, like Alexander the Great, he had brought scientists, economists, botanists, and antiquarians.\n\nTheir magnificent statistical and topographical Description de L’Egypte, published between 1809 and 1817 under the editor-\n\nship of E. F. Jomard, laid a firm foundation for the coming science of Egyptology. Under this heading, and as a minor part of it only, the study of Greek papyri was to be treated for almost a century yet. In 1802 the famous trilingual stone from Rosetta\n\n20 The Rediscovery of Papyrus was forwarded to the Society of Antiquaries in London, and set\n\nThomas Young and Champollion le Jeune on the right track\n\n: for the decipherment of the Egyptian hieroglyphs. A succession of travellers with observant eyes and critical minds—Champollion himself, Letronne, Lepsius, Brugsch—carried on the task of recording and cataloguing. Many of the visitors to Egypt, even though not scholars, also found their imaginations stirred by the country’s monuments. Shelley, who never went to Egypt, caught the infection in his ‘I met a traveller from an antique land’. Even before Waterloo, diplomats, scholars, and adventurers were competing to form collections of Egyptian antiquities in which papyri (including Greek and Latin papyri) came to occupy an increasingly pro-\n\nminent place. Among them may be mentioned Bernardino Drovetti, French Consul General 1810-29; Henry Salt, Consul General in Cairo 1816-27; G. Passalacqua, who was present\n\nat excavations at Thebes and Memphis in 1820 and 1824; the Prussian general Heinrich de Minutoli, who undertook a journey to Egypt in 1821 on behalf of the Prussian Academy; Giovanni Anastasi, Swedish and Norwegian Consul General from 1828; Jean-Francois Mimaut, French Consul General from\n\n1829; William John Bankes, son of a secretary of the British Museum and assistant in 1815-20 to Henry Salt; these persons (conveniently listed in W. R. Dawson’s Who Was Who in Egyptology) and many others have given their names to both individual texts and to whole collections of papyri. The first person to follow N. Schow in publishing a Greek text was L. Furia in 1813, and in 1821 August Bockh himself published a paper on a text now in Leiden.® Several further editions fall in\n\nthe 1820’s: in 1826 and 1827 Peyron published the first two volumes of the Turin papyri, Pettretini the Vienna papyri in 1826, and J. G. Droysen a few Berlin papyri in 1829. Some Vatican papyri were edited by A. Mai in 1831-2, a first instalment of the British Museum collection by Forshall in 1839, of Leiden in 1843 by Leemans, of Paris in 1865 by Brunet de Presle.\n\nThese papyri most often originated in finds made by local inhabitants. But a number are by-products from the search for objects of vertu, especially precious metals, promoted by col-\n\nlectors, such as Salt, acting through Giovanni d’Athanasi and\n\nThe Rediscovery of Papyrus 21 Belzoni. Perhaps the first piece of archaeological exploration directed at the discovery of knowledge for its own sake was that\n\nof Mariette at the great Serapeum of Sakkara in the 1850s. A number of Greek papyri had already been found there, and Mariette (incidentally as it were) was present at the finding of more. The early collectors were interested mainly in complete texts, archives, or whole rolls. ‘Their pieces make their effect by their\n\nsize, splendour, or number of items. But Greek and Latin papyri were still not specially numerous: Ulrich Wilcken has collected and re-edited such of them as belong to the Ptolemaic period (the bulk of them) and had been published before 1891 in his Urkunden der Ptolemderzeait (U.P.Z.). Their total is a bare\n\n200. The principal literary finds up to the 1860s were the two rolls of Hyperides in the British Museum; the Louvre poem of Alcman; and three Homers of substantial size in the British Museum, one named after Bankes, the other two after A. C. Harris.9\n\nAn entirely new stage in the process of rediscovery began in\n\nthe 1870s. The sites of ancient settlements had always been a legitimate hunting ground for building materials: stones were\n\nquarried out and reused, marble reduced to lime in the kiln, and their very earth (rich in nitrates) used as a fertilizer. Even the ancients seem to have dug out the soil for this purpose. In the 1870s, as the cultivated area expanded, the demand for ‘fertile earth’ or sebakh grew enormously. Farmers removed it by donkey- and camel-load, by cart, and at last by railway. As ancient sites were stripped, papyri began to appear in masses, just as they had been thrown away in the ancient world on rapidly forming out-door rubbish heaps. In 1877 spectacular finds of this sort began to be made at the mound (kom) el-Faris,\n\na part of the ancient Arsinoe, capital of the Fayyim. Similar finds were made elsewhere (though the date of the first discovery is not recorded) at Ihnasya (Heracleopolis) and Eshmunein (Hermopolis). Naturally the strata reached first were those offering Arabic, Coptic, and Byzantine Greek papyri; col-\n\nlectors had little regard for products of so late a period, and many thousands, perhaps millions, of texts must have been destroyed. Among the first to realize their value was Joseph Karabacek, Professor in Vienna and later librarian of the\n\n20 The Rediscovery of Papyrus imperial library there. He worked closely in co-operation with his fellow countryman Theodor Graf. A glimpse into their activities\n\nis offered by their recently published correspondence.!® Eventually thousands of texts, parts of papyrus rolls, single sheets and\n\nbooks, quires and leaves of parchment, and a considerable amount of actual paper coming mainly from Arsinoe, but also from Hermopolis and Heracleopolis, were transferred to Vienna,\n\nprincipally for the collection of the Archduke Rainer. As the word went round that Europeans were ready to buy written sheets, more and more were offered to the dealers by their finders, or scraps were made up into ‘rolls’ to sell to tourists. In 1887 a new and untouched source of sebakh was discovered at Dimai (Socnopaei Nesus) on the edge of the Fayyim,\n\nthe so-called ‘Second Fayyim find’. Two local dealers in antiquities organized their own excavations there. At this site papyri were actually found on the floors of the ancient houses buried in the sand. The museums of Berlin, Paris, and London became alive to the desirability of adding new papyri to their collections. The new material for Berlin was especially that\n\nrecovered from the second Fayyaim find. The Bibliothéque Nationale in Paris benefited from the exploration of Panopolis (Achmim) by G. Maspero and Urbain Bouriant. There were finds of Greek literature and also whole codices of apocryphal Christian and Jewish books—the Gospel of Peter, the Apocalypse of Peter, and the Book of Enoch. A long roll of Hyperides reached the Louvre in 1888.!! On behalf of the British Museum Ernest (later Sir) Wallis Budge was sent on a journey to Egypt\n\nin 1888 that was to be exceptionally profitable. The Revd. Greville Chester, an Englishman resident in Cairo and already purchasing on behalf of the Museum, put him in touch with Mr. J. R. Alexander, director of the American Missionary School at Assiut, and Mr. Chauncey J. Murch, director of a similar establishment at Luxor. Alexander above all is worthy\n\nof honour, for it seems to be he who should have the credit (inadequately acknowledged in Budge’s account) for saving the famous four rolls of Aristotle’s Constitution of Athens'2 and the Herodas roll. The arrival of texts such as these challenged a new generation of scholars. In Vienna Carl Wessely had taught himself to read the most difficult handwritings, and began a chalcenteric\n\nThe Rediscovery of Papyrus 23 output of publication. His pioneering work and devoted application have never received the credit they merited. He was overshadowed by a younger German scholar, a man of undoubtedly more balanced judgement and greater accuracy of exposition, Ulrich Wilcken. The latter was under the influence of Mommsen’s early appreciation of the importance for historical study of collecting from a mass of documents detail that in\n\nitself is trivial but when assembled and related becomes significant. “The nineteenth century’, Mommsen was wont to say,\n\n‘is the age of inscriptions: the twentieth will be the age of papyri.’ Consequently the young Wilcken chose the history of Egypt as illuminated by the papyri for his doctoral dissertation, published in 1885. From then until his death in 1945 Wilcken was at the centre of papyrological investigation, himself editing texts, founding a periodical, the Archiv fur Papyrusforschung, in\n\nwhich he passed in magisterial but kindly review the publications of others (always having himself something to contribute), and forming a school of brilliant pupils. Very slightly younger was Frederic Kenyon, who joined the British Museum in February 1889 as a 26-year-old classical scholar, and was almost immediately commissioned to work on its growing papyrus collection. It was just before Budge’s parcel of papyrus rolls arrived in the Museum. It was on the 30th January 1890 [wrote Kenyon nearly fifty years later] that I was first introduced to them. I well remember my first sight of them, laid out under glass on long tables. The handwritings were for the most part totally unfamiliar. One, a small roll of poetry, looked easy to read, and so it was so far as mere decipherment went; but the matter was strange and often difficult, so it was reserved for a further examination. The two longest were in small and (at that time) difficult hands; but it was possible to discern that one was\n\nhistorical and one medical, while a third, in not very dissimilar writing, was oratorical. The latter was immediately identified as Isocrates wept eipjvnc, and the next day a letter of Demosthenes was recognised. The next discovery, after some days steady transcription work, was Hyperides xara DiAvr7idov. Presently the historical treatise\n\nwas taken in hand. I remember that progress was slow at first, as the first column was a good deal damaged, but my suspicions as to its identity were aroused. I remembered having heard at Oxford, in a lecture by Dr. Macan, of the fragments of Aristotle’s A@énvaiwy moXreia which had been identified at Berlin. I sent for Rose’s\n\n24 The Rediscovery of Papyrus edition of the fragments of Aristotle, and kept my eye on it, and on February 26th I find it recorded that I had identified the papyrus as\n\nthe lost Aristotle. Eleven months later (Jan. 19 1891) the first edition! was given to the world,—very inadequately done, through hurry and inexperience, but at least providing much material for\n\nother scholars to work on. The Herodas and Hyperides,' with descriptions of the Demosthenes and Isocrates and other texts, followed in August of the same year.\n\nIn the same summer (July 1891) there was printed in Dublin an edition by J. P. Mahaffy of texts and documents recovered from Ptolemaic mummies. W. Flinders Petrie had found papyri at a series of excavations in the eighties—at T'anis in 1883/4,\n\nHawara in 1889,'5 at Gurob in 1890.'° He noticed (Letronne had observed the same thing in 1826)!7 that the casings of a number of the mummies from Gurob were formed of ‘cartonnage’, a term applied to a kind of cardboard or papier maché built up of sheets of used papyrus. ‘These casings were taken to pieces, and turned out to be composed of texts and documents\n\n| of the early third century before Christ. One piece was an early copy of Plato’s Phaedo.'8 For ten years, until the discovery of the Timotheos roll at Abusir by German archaeologists, it was to rank as the oldest surviving Greek literary manuscript. Now even the Timotheos may have been robbed of its primacy by the Greek papyrus from Derveni in Macedonia.\n\nIT]\n\nEXCAVATING FOR PAPYRI: THE ORGANIZATION OF THEIR STUDY HE publications of the annus mirabilis of 1891 made a sensa-\n\n) tion. It seemed as though a sleeping emperor had really and truly awoken after centuries. What more might not be found of ancient literature in the desert sands? The competition to buy was intensified. From their journals and correspondence we can follow the activities of collectors such as Edouard Naville (laying the basis of the collections in Geneva), Urbain\n\nBouriant, Charles Edwin Wilbour, James Sandilands Grant. Publication of the new texts began to be organized. The first parts (issued serially) of the documentary papyri in Berlin, the Berliner Gniechische Urkunden (B.G.U.), appeared in 1892; the first volume of the Catalogue of Greek Papyrt in the British Museum\n\nin 1893; the first comprehensive publication from Vienna, volume 1 of the Corpus Papyrorum Rainert (C.P.R.), and the first\n\nfascicule of the Geneva papyri in 1895. The purchases made during his first winter in Egypt (1893/4) by B. P. Grenfell, Craven Fellow of the University of Oxford, appeared in 1896 (An Alexandrian Erotic Fragment and Other Greek Papyri). In the\n\nsame year he published a more extensive text (one part of which was purchased by Petrie in 1893/4, the second portion by Grenfell himself in 1894/5), The Revenue Laws of Ptolemy Philadel-\n\nphus. A. H. Sayce purchased papyri from the Oasis of Khargeh in 1893/4.! In 1896 a new prize, a roll of Bacchylides, came to the\n\nBritish Museum. Its place of origin was kept secret; Wallis Budge later said it was a tomb at Meir, Moirae, twenty-five miles from Hermopolis.? Certainly during the next four years the inhabitants searched Hermopolis intensively. Wilcken accepted the report that it was in a house in this town that the rolls containing the Berlin Didymus, Theaetetus commentary, and Hierocles were found—the constituents of the new series of Berlin classical texts (Berliner Klasstkertexte, B.A.T.) inaugurated in 1904.\n\n26 Excavating for Papyri To us, seventy years after, the nineties seem an era of rich discovery. What far-sighted contemporaries were more keenly aware of was the enormous number of texts that were undoubtedly being destroyed. In the hit-or-miss ransacking of ancient sites for anticas of intrinsic value, perhaps half the papyri\n\nthey contained were ruined by the coarse methods employed; of those found, many were destroyed in ignorance, or thrown away to evade detection by the Inspectors of the Antiquities Service, who valiantly tried to bring the illicit diggings under | control. Others were divided deliberately among the finders (examples will be given in a later chapter). Now a number of archaeological expeditions, though looking for other things, had recently found papyri: the French expedition at Achmim\n\nin 1887, and Flinders Petrie at Tanis, Hawara, and Gurob. Their experience suggested that exploration with the avowed object of searching for papyri might be rewarding. In 1895 the Egypt Exploration Fund (later to become the Egypt Exploration Society) commissioned its first excavators on the GraecoRoman side: D. G. Hogarth, B. P. Grenfell, and A. S. Hunt of Oxford. In the years 1895 and 1896 they visited a number of sites in the Fayyim and conducted test excavations to recover Greek and Latin papyri. Their searches were to be rewarded in a phenomenal manner, and to inaugurate a new period in the recovery of texts from Egypt. Previously papyri had usually been found by accident, in temples, graves, or various hiding-places; or else they had appeared from no one knew where in the baskets of the sebakh\n\ndiggers. Places were now selected for search as a result of rational choice. It has already been stated that in Egypt south of Cairo papyri have a good chance of survival in the ground,\n\nif they are not actually on the surface, and not so far down that they are ruined by damp from water rising from below (1.e. they must be above what 1s technically known as the height of the water-table). In Egypt the level of the water-table has risen constantly through the centuries as the bed of the Nile has been\n\nraised by the mud deposited on it. Now in Egypt no place that has for a millennium or more been subject to the annual inundation of the Nile can preserve papyri. The majority of papyri from Egypt will therefore come from the desert, tombs, cemeteries, monasteries, funerary shrines, or deserted town sites on\n\nExcavating for Papyri 27 the higher ground on either bank, above the irrigation level. They may also come from the upper levels of still-existing towns that have themselves climbed high above the earlier settlements\n\non the same site—a striking example of such climbing is presented to the traveller’s eyes at Elephantine Island, opposite Assuan. So in the sixth century of our era a dweller in Edfu gave his address as ‘on the mound [év t%apare] of the town’ (Archiv 1, p. 165).\n\nThese general principles were by now tolerably well understood. Grenfell and Hunt decided to make a systematic exploration of the sites of Graeco-Roman villages and towns that in the 1890s were still on the fringe of the cultivation level, and to search for cemeteries from these settlements that might contain papyrus rolls. The technique of investigating a town site for\n\npapyri inside a limited period of time had to be worked out from scratch. Grenfell and Hunt developed a method of looking\n\nfor afsh, a word used by the fellahin. ‘Afsh consists of earth mixed with little bits of twig or straw; and the depth of a stratum of it may vary from a few inches to several metres. Good afsh must not be too hard, for coagulation is somehow fatal to the preservation of papyri nor yet too soft, for then it tends to become Sebakh, 1.e. fine, powdery earth in which any fragile substance such as papyrus has decomposed.’ This afsh, they lay down, may be found in ‘(1) rubbish mounds pure and simple, which cover no buildings; (2) remains of buildings ~ which are partly filled up with and buried in rubbish; (3) buildings which were never used as places for throwing rubbish, but\n\nhave simply collapsed, and are filled by their own debris and wind-blown sand. ... As regards the completeness and value of the accompanying papyri, these three classes are arranged in an ascending scale.’3\n\nIn the winter of 1895/6 Grenfell and Hunt explored the villages of Kom Aushim (Karanis) and Kom el-Asl on the north-\n\neastern rim of the Fayyim. At the latter site papyri were relatively plentiful and were found in the houses themselves. In 1896/7 they moved further south to Behnesa, the ancient Oxyrhynchus, situated on the edge of the western desert 120 miles\n\nsouth of Cairo. The reasons for this choice may be given in Grenfell’s own words, written after the season’s work.‘ Being the capital of the nome, it must have been the abode of\n\n28 Excavating for Papyri many rich persons who could afford to possess a library of literary texts. Though the ruins of the old town were known to be fairly extensive, and it was probable that most of them were of the GraecoRoman period, neither town nor cemetery appeared to have been plundered for antiquities in recent times. Above all, Oxyrhynchus seemed to be a site where fragments of Christian literature might be expected of an earlier date than the fourth century, to which our\n\noldest manuscripts of the New Testament belong; for the place was renowned in the fourth and fifth centuries on account of the number of its churches and monasteries.\n\nThe site was in fact at this time just out in the desert west of the Bahr Yusuf; there were few inhabitants because of exposure to Bedouin raids. The area of the ancient town was roughly one and a quarter miles long, half a mile broad. My first impressions [wrote Grenfell] were not very favourable. As has been said, about half was Arabic [village] ; and, with regard to the other half, a thousand years’ use as a quarry for limestone and bricks had clearly reduced the buildings and houses to utter ruin. In many parts of the site which had not been used as a depository for rubbish,\n\nespecially to the north-west, lines of limestone chips or banks of sand marked the positions of buildings of which the walls had been\n\ndug out; but of the walls themselves scarcely anything was left, except part of the town wall enclosing the north-west of the site, the buildings having been cleared away down to their foundations, or to within a few courses of them. It was obvious from the outset that the\n\nremains of the Roman city were not only much worse preserved than those of the Fayyiim towns which we had dug the year before, and in which most of the houses still had their walls partly standing, but that, if papyri were to be found, they must be looked for not in the shallow remains of houses, but in the rubbish mounds. These, of course, might cover buildings, but it was more probable that they would not; and there is a great difference between digging houses which after being deserted had simply fallen in and become covered\n\nwith sand, and digging rubbish mounds. In the former there is always the chance of finding valuable things which have been left behind or concealed by the last occupants, such as a hoard of coins or a collection of papyrus rolls buried in a pot; while in rubbish\n\nmounds, since the objects found must have been thrown away deliberately, they were much less likely to be valuable, and were quite certain to be in a much worse condition. The result of our excavations showed that I had been so far right in that the rubbish mounds were nothing but rubbish mounds; and the miscellaneous\n\nExcavating for Papyri 29 small anticas which we found are of little interest, while the number of papyri which are sufficiently well preserved to be of use was but\n\ntrifling compared to the mass which is hopelessly fragmentary or\n\ndefaced. Fortunately, however, the total find of papyri was so enormous that even the small residue of valuable ones forms a collection not only larger than any one site has hitherto produced, but probably equal to any existing collection of Greek papyri.\n\nGrenfell and Hunt were, in fact, reluctant to dig these mounds. They spent three weeks, with little tangible result, looking for the Graeco-Roman cemeteries of the town. Then on\n\n11 January 1897 a low mound was dug. Almost immediately there turned up a sheet of papyrus recognized as containing ‘Sayings of Jesus’ (now known to form part of the apocryphal Gospel of Thomas) ;a second sheet was a portion of St. Matthew’s Gospel. “The flow of papyri soon became a torrent it was diffi-\n\ncult to keep pace with.’ One hundred and ten men, working in pairs, carried the trenches across the mounds. The papyri were rarely whole rolls; often only single leaves or fragments of leaves\n\nwere found. The mounds, it was noted, tended to divide into three classes: those on the outside of the site producing first to early fourth century papyri, those near the village being of the mediaeval Arabic period, while the intermediate ones chiefly produced papyri of the Byzantine\n\nperiod, varied occasionally by earlier ones or by Arabic papyri of the eighth or ninth centuries. The old town, founded probably on the riverbank where the modern village stands, thus reached its widest extent in the Roman period and has been contracting ever since.\n\nIt was noted that as a rule papyri found in one mound tended to be within a century or two of each other. But there were cases of ‘composite’ mounds, 1.e. ‘two or three small mounds heaped _ up at different periods’. The papyri tended to run in layers and to be associated with afsh. Often large quantities of papyri were\n\nfound together. Grenfell supposed that such finds represented a clearance of the local archives. In the first of these ‘archive’ mounds, of which the papyri belonged to the end of the first and beginning of the second century, we some-\n\ntimes found not only the contents of a basket all together, but baskets themselves full of papyri. Unfortunately, it was the practice\n\nto tear most of the rolls to pieces first, and of the rest many had\n\n30 Excavating for Papyrt naturally been broken or crushed in being thrown away, or had been subsequently spoiled by damp, so that the amount discovered which is likely to be of use, though large in itself, bears but a small\n\nproportion to what the whole amount might have been. In the second find of archives the papyri belonged to the latter part of the third or early part of the fourth century, and several of them are large official documents which are likely to be of more than usual interest. The third and by far the greatest find, that of the Byzantine archives, took place on March 18th and roth, and was, I suppose, a ‘record’ in point of quantity. On the first of these two days we\n\ncame upon a mound which had a thick layer consisting almost entirely of papyrus rolls. There was room for six pairs of men and boys to be working simultaneously at this storehouse, and the difh-\n\nculty was to find enough baskets in all Behneseh to contain the papyri. At the end of the day’s work no less than thirty-six goodsized baskets were brought in from this place, several of them stuffed with fine rolls three to ten feet long, including some of the largest Greek rolls I have ever seen. As the baskets were required for the next day’s work, Mr. Hunt and I started at 9 p.m. after dinner to stow away the papyri in some empty packing-cases which we for-\n\ntunately had at hand. The task was only finished at three in the morning, and on the following night we had a repetition of it, for twenty-five more baskets were filled before the place was exhausted.\n\nIt has seemed worth while to report zn extenso the conditions under which the first finds were made at Oxyrhynchus. First, it has often been doubted whether the mounds at Behnesa were\n\ntrue rubbish mounds. Such a doubt cannot survive Grenfell’s explicit testimony, explicitly confirmed by the account given later by U. Wilcken of the German excavations at Heracleopolis.’ Secondly, in view of the present-day trend to statistical treatment of data from papyrus finds, it is important to show the extent to which caprice governs the survival and discovery of papyri of any given epoch. On this point more will be said in the next chapter. The immediate result of the work at Behnesa was the formation of a Graeco-Roman branch of the Egypt Exploration Fund, to support further excavation and the costs of publishing the texts discovered. The first volume issued, The Oxyrhynchus Papyri\n\n(vol. i), with the names of Grenfell and Hunt as editors, appeared in 1898. The method followed in the publication— introduction, text, translation, and brief commentary on each\n\nExcavating for Papyri 31 text, together with lavish facsimiles—was to serve as a model for succeeding editors. The series was to reach volume xvii before\n\nthe death of A. S. Hunt. Now (in 1966) it totals thirty-two volumes. The papyrological posterity of Grenfell and Hunt can\n\nonly wonder at the speed with which publications on such a scale and of such authority were issued, especially when it is recalled that between 1894 and 1907 in only one year (1897/8) were Grenfell and Hunt not excavating in Egypt throughout the winter. Other European countries followed the example set by the Egypt Exploration Fund. In 1898 the German archaeologists H. Schaefer and U. Wilcken examined the mounds of [hnasya (Heracleopolis) with some success, even though the site had already been rifled by sebakh diggers. But bad luck dogged their expedition: the finds of the first season were destroyed while still\n\non board ship in the harbour of Hamburg. In 1898/9 and 1900 Grenfell and Hunt went back to the villages on the west side of the Fayyim, where the ancient sites were in immediate peril. In these villages their success was only moderate compared with the finds from Oxyrhynchus. But they had already learned that on town sites texts of the Ptolemaic period were usually so deeply buried by the later occupation levels that normally they were ruined by damp. Flinders Petrie’s texts from Gurob pointed a way to the discovery of earlier papyri: as already indicated, they were waste-paper made into cartonnage for mummy wrappings (a method commonly used in the third century before Christ, and one which lasted in some communities down to the time of Augustus, but rarely thereafter). Identification and digging of Ptolemaic cemeteries was therefore regarded as a first duty at any site explored. Their most sensational discovery was the cemetery of crocodile mummies of Umm-el-Baragat, Tebtynis, when they were working on behalf of the University of California. They were hoping to find human mummies from which cartonnage might be extracted; to some extent they were successful. “But on January 16, 1900... one of our workmen, disgusted at finding a row of crocodiles where he expected sarcophagi, broke one of them in pieces and disclosed the surprising fact that the creature was wrapped in sheets of papyrus. As may be imagined, after this find we dug out all the crocodile-tombs in the cemetery; and in\n\n32 Excavating for Papyri the next few weeks, several thousands of these animals were unearthed, of which a small proportion (about 2 per cent.) contained papyri.’® A similar but smaller crocodile cemetery was unearthed in 1901 at Khamsin, about six miles from Tebtynis. It is impossible (and would be tedious to the reader) to mention every site visited by Grenfell and Hunt or the other early excavators. The cartonnage obtained from some of the villages they visited has not yet been published. Buying up odd bits of papyri offered for sale would sometimes lead to a promising new source. In 1900/1 it was such a trail which led them to el-Hibeh, on the right bank of the river. ‘The spring of 1901 and a good deal of the following winter (1901/2) were spent in examining the Ptolemaic necropolis there. Its mummies have provided very early Ptolemaic texts and documents, some of them earlier than the Petrie papyri. At the same time Pierre Jouguet was finding texts of the same age on cartonnage in the Ptolemaic cemeteries of Ghoran (1901), and at Medinet-en-\n\nNahas (Magdola, 1902). In 1902 he excavated at Tehneh, thirty-five miles down the Nile valley.\n\nEarly Greek texts might survive, however, if protected by a container. L. Borchardt, directing the German excavations at Abusir in 1902, found a roll of Timotheos,7 an undoubted manuscript of the fourth century before Christ, lying alongside its owner in a wooden sarcophagus. At Abusir-el-Malaq, some fifty miles further south, the same excavators found cartonnage which went right down to the age of Augustus. The German excavators continued with a season at Eshmunein (Hermopolis)\n\nin 1904. Then, following discoveries of Aramaic rolls and of enormous archives of papyrus at Syene (Assuan) and Elephantine (opposite Assuan), Rubensohn and Zucker spent two years there (1906 and 1907). In Elephantine two different finds of early material were made by them, both again protected in jars: a marriage document and a will of 311 B.c., and a series of papers of about 230 B.c. It was in the year 1906 that a syndicate was formed in Germany to purchase papyri and distribute them to institutions of learning and museums in that country. During 1906 the French excavators Clermont-Ganneau and Clédat were also at work in Elephantine. Alongside the consciously directed hunt for papyri, finds of course continued to be made by natives. The Byzantine and\n\nExcavating for Papyri 33 Arab archives of Syene have already been mentioned. In 1gor a similar find was made at Aphrodito (Kom Ishqaw) during the digging of a well inside the present inhabited area. In 1905 a further accidental discovery on the same spot led to the unearthing of literary rolls. Gustav Lefebvre, the energetic and gifted Inspector of Antiquities, at once took charge, and seized the opportunity offered by the demolition of a recent building to excavate. Inside a room in a house of the sixth century he found a jar stuffed with papyri. On the top were remains of the\n\nnow famous Cairo codex of Menander. Of another find of roughly the same date (1906/7)—-four complete codices of Deu-\n\nteronomy, Joshua, Psalms, the four Gospels, and Pauline Epistles, belonging to the fifth century—no information 1s avail-\n\nable regarding origin. In the spring of 1903 Grenfell and Hunt returned to Behnesa, Oxyrhynchus. The site was far from being exhausted, and the English excavators spent five seasons there in a row (from spring\n\n1903 till spring 1907). Three particularly rich finds of literary texts were uncovered in 1905/6 and cleared up the following\n\nseason. One of the mounds containing these texts was surmounted by the tomb of a locally venerated holy man, the Sheikh Ali-Gamman. To the excavators’ chagrin the workmen refused to allow search under his tomb. The area was not to be opened up and the rest of the literary papyri garnered till more\n\nthan twenty years later by Italian excavators. Grenfell and Hunt left in 1907 with the hope of returning in 1909. But 1906/7\n\nwas in fact to be their last season of excavation. Grenfell became ill in 1908 and the concession was relinquished. It was taken up by the Italians who (inspired by G. Vitelli) had in June 1908 formed a society for exploring to find papyri (Societa per la ricerca det papiri).\n\nItalian excavators had already between 1903 and 1905 worked in Eshmunein (Hermopolis), and their finds began to be —\n\npublished in the Papirt fiorentini (vol. 1, 1906). In 1908 their excavators returned there, and then in 1910, I912, and 1913 Professors Pistelli and Farina worked in Oxyrhynchus. On behalf of the society E. Breccia returned there for seasons of work in 1927/8, 1932, and 1934. This list of excavations (not intended to be a complete one)\n\n814262 D\n\nmay be concluded by a mention of the later investigations by the\n\n34 Excavating for Papyri Egypt Exploration Fund. Between 1909 and 1914 J. de M. Johnson explored sites on both banks of the Nile south of Oxyrhynchus. Antinoe (previously explored by A. Gayet), already extensively worked for sebakh, was the principal source of papyri in the season’s work 1913/14, but finds were disappoint-\n\ning in bulk compared to those of Oxyrhynchus. At Atfieh (Aphroditopolis) some Ptolemaic cartonnage was recovered. But\n\ndamp was the enemy, both there and at a series of settlements\n\non the west bank which had had an abundant population in\n\nGraeco-Roman times. The twenty or so years between the first excavation for papyri in 1895/6 and the First World War in 1914 had seen organiza-\n\ntion brought into scholarly work in the study as well as into search on the ground. In this period thousands of texts were published and a working apparatus of scholarly aids and source books gradually assembled. ‘These works will be enumerated in\n\ndetail in later chapters, but a few should be mentioned here. It was the first generation of papyrological scholars which provided most of the essential subszdia which have not yet been replaced. Kenyon’s Palaeography of Greek Papyri (1899), supplemented by Schubart’s plates, Papyri Graecae Berolinenses (1911),\n\nhad no systematic successor till Schubart’s Griechische Paldographie (1925). The periodical Archiv ftir Papyrusforschung founded\n\nby Wilcken, in 1900, acted as a critical and bibliographical focus for papyrus work. Wilcken and Mitteis’s Grundziige und Chrestomathie der Papyruskunde (1912) formed a masterly summary\n\nof the contribution of papyri to the fields of history, administration, and law; and Schubart’s Eznfthrung in die Papyruskunde (1919) Js written for the scholar actually intending to decipher\n\ntexts and for the literary historian. Perhaps the biggest contributions to scholarly organization were made in the twenties by F. Preisigke, a retired German post office official. In 1915 he published an experimental vocabulary of technical administrative terms (Fachwérterbuch). ‘This led him to establish four other works: a Namenbuch (1920), listing the names of persons found in Greek and Latin documentary papyri and inscriptions from Egypt; the Worterbuch der griechischen Papyrusurkunden, a lexicon\n\nof Greek and Latin words in papyri (1926); a Berichtigungsliste, which attempts to collect all corrections proposed for published\n\npapyrus texts, whether verified or not; a Sammelbuch, which\n\nExcavating for Papyri 35 reprints all documents printed in periodicals (except—and alas for the exception!—the Archiv itself) or in books that have no\n\nindex. These works have helped scholars to find their way about material published in widely dispersed places. One other such list may also be mentioned here—that of the published literary papyri, the list of R. A. Pack (The Greek and Latin Literary Texts from Graeco-Roman Egypt, 2nd ed., 1965) superseding\n\nall previous ones.\n\nFrom what has already been said the reader will be able to appreciate the advantages for scholarship of organized excavations for papyri under a trained director. Such a system guaranteed that the origin and provenance of texts would be certainly known; that texts found together would be kept together, and that individual pieces would not be snipped into halves or quarters, or sold in small parcels to individual buyers. Writing in 1912, Wilcken expressed a hope that such a system would\n\nalways be adhered to in the future. It was, alas, a utopian dream. During the First World War excavations stopped, but the finding of papyri did not. In 1915 the largest and bestpreserved single archive of papyrus documents in history was turned up by Egyptian farmers near Darb-el-Gerza. European\n\nexcavators had repeatedly examined the site but failed to locate them. What makes them especially valuable is that they are early Ptolemaic, yet not on cartonnage. They consist of the papers of Zenon, manager for Ptolemy II’s finance minister, belonging to the years 260-240 B.c. Eventually the bulk of them were assembled in the Cairo Museum; but not before individuals\n\nhad bought on their own account both single texts and large parcels, which are now dispersed in many collections. It is, in fact, inevitable that most finds will be made by the inhabitants of an area as they go about their daily business, and that every effort will be made to keep a new find secret from the Antiquities Service. The result is that we know almost nothing of the origin of some of the most interesting caches, which are often more or less complete manuscripts: the Freer Collection of Old and New Testament codices acquired probably about 1906,8 the eleven Chester Beatty biblical Greek codices found about 1931,9 the Manichaean books found in a box about 193019 (K, F. W. Schmidt said ‘somewhere in the Fayyim’), the\n\nmanuscripts of Origen and Didymus the Blind hidden in the\n\n|\n\n|\n\n36 Excavating for Papyri Tourah quarries near Cairo and unearthed about 1940,! the Coptic Gnostic books from Nag Hammadi, or the find which has enriched the collections of M. Bodmer of Geneva, Sir Chester Beatty, the University of Mississippi and others!2 with a complete play of Menander, three nearly complete Greek gospels of early date, and a whole series of other New and\n\nOld Testament books in Greek and Coptic.\n\n} First in the excavation field after the First World War was the French Institut de Parchéologie orientale, based in Cairo. Girard, Henne, and later O. Guéraud resumed work begun by P. Jouguet in 1913/14 at Apollinopolis Magna (Edfu). One single big group of Greek papyri was found, all of them of the eighth century. They were in a jar, about a hundred metres south-east of the eastern pylon of the temple. French excavators continued to work on this site. In 1937 they were joined by Polish colleagues under the leadership of K. Michalowski. Only scraps of papyrus were found, but a large number of Ptolemaic and Roman ostraca, especially from the Jewish quarter, were assembled.\n\nPetrie paid a fleeting visit to Oxyrhynchus in 1922, but the principal excavations of the English-speaking world were the\n\nnotable ten years of work undertaken by the University of Michigan. The moving spirit in organizing it was F. W. Kelsey. From a visit to Egypt in 1920 he took back what H. I. Bell!3 has described as ‘a really splendid collection’. It was purchased in the flourishing Egyptian papyrus market for the universities of\n\nMichigan and Wisconsin. In 1922 a syndicate of buyers was formed, consisting of the universities of Michigan, Cornell, and Princeton, the City and University Library at Geneva, and the British Museum; purchases made during the next five or more years were inventoried by H. I. Bell before distribution. Later other universities (Yale and Columbia) joined in. Then in 1924\n\nthe decision was taken to reopen excavations in the Fayyim, not only to find papyri, but if possible also to plan and trace the growth of the communities from which papyri originate. The site selected was Kom Aushim (Karanis). Natives had recently turned up the papers of Aurelius Isidorus, a ruggedly independent and outspoken landowner of the early fourth century A.D.; they had also found some exceptionally long tax rolls. Work began in 1925 and was continued till spring 1935. The\n\nExcavating for Papyri 37 great mound had suffered previously from sebakh-hunters. But the excavators discovered a completely unknown temple, and\n\ncleared out a large "
