XXVI JULY 1951 No. 3 THE FOURTEENTH-CENTURY MADRIGAL: ITS FORM AND CONTENTS By W. THOMAS MARROCCO Tue word madrigal appeared for the first time in 1813 when Francesco da Bar- berino, in his Glosse Latine ait Documenti d’Amore,' enumerated the following poetic forms in use inter nostros: canzoni distesi, ballate, sonetti, sirventesi, cobbole, discordi, concordi, contese, libratici, prosaici, and voluntarii. He writes of the last- mentioned that it is ‘rudium, inordinatum concinium, ut matricale et similia.’ The second source on the madrigal dates from 1332 and comes from the pen of the Paduan judge-poet, Antonio da Tempo, who gives not only the etymology of the term but also the various forms of the madrigal with original examples.’ From the etymological view, the madrigal has remained one of the few art forms continuing to intrigue musicologists as well as philologists. There are those who favor the derivation from matricale, designating a poem in the mother tongue, and others from mandriale, meaning a rustic kind of pastoral poem. Since 1985 some philologists have advanced the theory that the term may be derived from materiale; others have suggested metricalis.‘ Fellowes, as well as this writer, believes that the derivation from matricale has been settled by Lean- dro Biadene’s article on the madrigal.® To most of us, the term is associated with the caccia and ballata as one of the most popular musical art forms during the Italian Trecento. Primarily, the madrigal was a poem set to music, but many madrigals have reached us that were, apparently, never adapted to musical settings. As a poetic form the madri- gal never attained the popularity of the canzona or the sonetto. While the musical form of the madrigal has been clearly defined, the descrip- tions currently found do not reflect the form of the poetry.* This ambiguity exists because the fourteenth-century madrigal, in its forty-odd years of existence, falls into two periods—an early formative period, and a later one which sees the madrigal as a crystallized form. A thorough examination of the literary and musical sources bears out this contention.’ ; Let us, in the interest of scholarly curiosity, focus our attention on the follow- ing rhyme schemes, which are representative of the early and late periods of madrigalian practice. The composers and poets selected are Magister Piero,* Jacopo da Bologna,® Giovanni da Firenze® (or da Cascia), Alesso Donati, Simone j 449 450 The Fourteenth-Century Madrigal Ciati, and Petrarca for the early period, with Gherardello da Firenze,* Donato da Cascia,* Francesco Landini,’ Nicolé Soldanieri, Franco Sacchetti, Saviozzo, Boccaccio, Stefano di Cino, Cino Rinuccini, and Francesco Vannozzo for the later period.

Indeed, no better evidence testifying to the irreg- ularity of the madrigalian form during the early Trecento can be found than in Antonio da Tempo’s treatise. The following are seven original madrigals with preliminary rules given by this author : Mandrialis [Madrigal] itaque undenarius tantum debet esse duarum partium sive copu- larum ad minus; potest etiam habere plures partes servata tamen regula incepta et sic de aliis mandrialibus. Debent etiam habere omnes mandriales in secunda parte tot versus quot in prima; excepto mandriali cum retornello, ut infra subjiciam in suo exemplo et tractatu. Undenarius ergo mandrialis constare debet in omnibus suis versibus ex undecim syllabis pro quolibet versu, cum trivus versibus pro qualibet parte in rithimis consonan- tibus et continuis, ut in hoc exemplo: Perché la bianca neve cader vidi Imaginava d’esser uom selvaggio Perché mia donna disse, tu mi ridi. Qual é cagion che di me non ti fidi? To gli risposi, donna, per l’oltraggio Che tu mi fai di cid che tu mi gridi. Questa mi disse, oimé, che tu m’ancidi Gittandomi nel cor si forte raggio Che I’anima dal corpo mi dividi. rhyme scheme ABA, ABA, ABA 452 The Fourteenth-Century Madrigal De mandriali undenario et septenario et eius forma.

The Fourteenth-Century Madrigal De mandrialibus repetitis et eorum forma. Gid per l’acqua corrente Colei m’offerse una bella ambasciata Colei m’offerse. Poi l’amorosa mente Tutta coperse di nova ballata Tutta coperse. It can readily be seen that the form found most frequently after about 1350, ABB, CDD:EE, is conspicuously absent. With the appearance of Franco Sac- chetti’s Libro delle Rime“ in 1362-1363, the madrigals of Soldanieri, and those of other members of the later period, we are instantly aware of an overwhelming majority of madrigals having the form ABB, CDD:EE. It is incomprehensible to this writer why Alfred Einstein states that the ideal form of the madrigal is that used by Petrarca in Nova angeletta sovra l’ale accorta, having the rhyme scheme ABC, ABC:DD.\" This scheme appears but once in the 222 madrigals examined. Percy Scholes makes a statement in similar vein: ‘Petrarch was one of the chief of those who developed and perfected the poetic form of the madrigal.’* As is seen in the above table, each of his five madrigals has a different rhyme scheme. When Gidino da Sommacampagna’s Trattato dei Rime Volgari was completed, (about 1384), the madrigal had been abandoned in favor of the ballata. Neverthe- less, Gidino lists seven varieties of madrigal forms, with rules and original exam- ples. The rhyme schemes alone are given here.'” ABB, CDD, EFF, GHH abb, edd, eff aCb, aCb, aCb AbA, CdC, EfE AbB, CdD: EE abB, cdD, efF AbB, AbB, CdD, EfF :F The fifth scheme almost corresponds to the form found most frequently. Why Gidino exhumes the madrigalian corpse and gives rhyme schemes which were no longer used cannot be explained. It is obvious, however, that this eclectic simply translated da Tempo’s treatise (without acknowledging the source) and substi- tuted original poems.'* In summarizing, the poetic form of the fourteenth century madrigal covers two periods. The early madrigal (about 1330-1350) may be described as having from two to as many as five strophes of three lines each, of which two lines are usually inrhyme. The strophes may or may not be followed by a distich called ritornello, and all the lines may be heptasyllabic or hendecasyllabic, or a combination of both. In the late period (about 1350-1370), the poetic form consists of two or three strophes of three hendecasyllabic lines, of which two lines are in rhyme. The strophes are followed by a hendecasyllabic ritornello. The seven metrical schemes suggested by Antonio da Tempo established a precedent for the budding madrigalists whose enthusiasm knew no bounds. After about 1350, the form ABB, CDD:EE predominates, and, as such, becomes amaster mould for the poets of the later period. The irregularity of the early madrigalian verse is not reflected in the form of 453 aCb, aCb 454 The Fourteenth-Century Madrigal the music. A poem whose lines are arranged in combinations of seven and eleven syllables does not modify the length of the musical phrases, for, the madrigal melody is too highly melismatic to be concerned with or influenced by the num. ber of syllables in each verse. AAB is the musical form usually encountered. A designates the first and longer section, containing the music for the stanza, while B indicates the shorter section, ritornello, designated by the following monogram in the Panciatichi Ms: 223 The ritornello is not to be interpreted as a refrain. In these manuscripts the first sec- tion is followed by the ritornello, at the end of which the second stanza is given (to be sung to the music of the first section). This in turn is followed by the incipit of the ritornello.!® This is misleading because it seems to indicate that the ritor- nello follows both stanzas. By careful examination of the poetry, one will see immediately that the sense of finality in the ritornello is so strong that a return to the second stanza would be illogical and anticlimactic. An examination of the contents of the madrigal poems shows a wide variety of subject-matter; they are contemplative, bucolic, encomiastic, satirical, and moralistic. Many express the delight of the poet who comes by chance, or other- wise, to a clearing in the woods where he espies lovely maidens, partially draped or undraped, bathing themselves.”° Others attempt to conceal the identity of the authors’ paramours by describing the beauty of certain birds or animals in lieu of the persons.”! This supports Carducci’s claim that certain representations of the hunt, as well as the idyllic madrigals, were allegories which veiled, more or less subtly, their amorous significance.” Still another describes the expediency with which the poet’s mistress dispatches her mother when she discovers them in a situation unequivocably comprising. There are, of course, texts with no erotic allusions, such as the eulogistic lo lume vostro dolce mio signore.” Lo lume vostro dolce mie signore Virtute sic perfecte est ornatum Ch’a’ rei non luce, a’ boni sempr’ é chiaro. Hoc est notum et satis probatum In quegli ch’han sentito et gusto amaro Nascosamente per comporre errore, {ritornello] Una donna vi regge ch’ E SI BELLA Sul ciel non é posta pid lucente stella. Prima virtute contains a moral; the first virtue is to control one’s tongue, for, while the tongue has no bone, it can break one’s back!”4 Prima virtute é costringer la lingua (set to music Cantasi’n Cato, ch’é perfetto autore by Jacopo) Chi’l sa ben fare, ben serv’! signore. Ma per ben fare e per ben dir s’impingua La mente di colui, ed é felice Ch’a ragion sa tacere, e perd dice. * As 4 leGhe * Madrigal Intrando ad abitar, set to music by Gherardello da Firenze, from Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, Florence, codex Panciatichi 26, fol. 86. This madrigal also appears in codex Palatino 87, fol. 31r of the Biblioteca Medicea-Laurenziana, Florence, and in codex Fonds italien 568, fol. 27, in the Bibliothéque Nationale, Paris. abot —— by acr as dev Nic vost tail the Te qu Ni ca dr ce its The Fourteenth-Century Madrigal {ritornello] La lingua non ha osso Ma spesse volte fa rompere ’] dosso. Tl ver non é mai mosso Chi perde per mal dir non é riscosso. Mention should be made at this point of the use of two poetic devices employed by the poets of the Trecento, the acrostic and the senhal. The function of the acrostic needs no explanation; the senhal, probably of Provengal origin, is used as a word-play to indicate a hidden name. There is no doubt that it was a favorite device for it appears in the texts of the compositions by Jacopo, Giovanni, Piero, Nicoldé, Landini, Donato, and Andrea da Firenze. The above example (Lo lume vostro) contains an acrostic and the senhal Isabella.** The following rhymes con- tain the senhal, ‘Anna’: Non A NNArciso fu pid amar lo specchio (set to music Della selvaggia fonte, com’é cruda by Landini) Questa donna di me di piata ignuda. Cosi sperando per seguirla invecchio Quella spiatata fugge raguardando Che io sanga mercé mi mor’ amando. [ritornello] Ma i’ pur credo, s’ella fugera Ch’Amor, giusto signor, la giungera.

[ritornello] ANNAmorar mi fa’l suo vis’umano E’! dolce sguardo e la pulita mano. That the fourteenth century madrigal was of humble origin is evidenced by the amorphousness of its early period and by evidence given by Antonio da Tempo who states: ‘Dicitur autem mandrialis a mandra pecudum et pastorum, quia primo nodum illum rithimandi et cantandi habuimus ab ovium pastoribus. Nam pastores tamquam rustici et homines grossi primo coeperunt amoris venerei causa compilare verba grossa et ipsa cantare et in suis tibiis sonare modo grosso, sed tamen naturaliter, licet hodie subtilius et pulchrius per rithimatores man- drialis huiusmodi compilentur.’* Biadene, while disagreeing with da Tempo con- cerning the etymology of the term madrigal, is in accordance with him regarding its origin: ‘Esso [the madrigal] sarebbe stato in origine il canto popolare per eecellenza; il canto che esce spontaneo dalle labbra del popolo.”?” 456 The Fourteenth-Century Madrigal The madrigal originated among the common folk, but soon entered the courts and became a vehicle which found favor with the Trecento poets. It was now no longer poetry and music for popular consumption. In this form, the music of the madrigal was too refined, too florid, and too complicated structurally and rhyth- mically to be sung with any degree of competence by provincial or itinerant musicians. The madrigal was written expressly for the amusement of the cour- tiers, it became the art-song of the period, and as such, laid the musical foundation of the Italian renaissance.

SHANNON, Jr The Tale of Gamelyn, that swift-moving metrical romance found in a number of manuscripts of The Canterbury Tales but no longer attributed to Chaucer, has been justly called by Mr Henry G. Leach! ‘a rattling good poem’; and aside from its importance as the literary ancestor of Lodge’s Rosalynde and Shakespeare’s As You Like It, it is of considerable interest as a record of the life of the times of which it tells. Among the interesting contemporary attributes of the work are its delight in physical violence, its strong anticlerical bias, and its presentation of such customary social pastimes as a wrestling match and a seven-day feast. But the most significant historical feature of the tale is its exact portrayal of the functionings of mediaeval English law. An amplification of this aspect of the narrative leads to a richer appreciation of the poem. Although the date of the tale is uncertain, Walter W. Skeat? and John E. Wells,? apparently dismissing F. Lindner’s‘ argument for the thirteenth century, assign the poem to 1340 or 1350. Skeat® is inclined to believe that the story was not original with the author, but Leach® says that both Gamelyn and The Geste of Robyn Hode ‘so far as we know, are without historical prototype’ and ‘seem to have been largely creations of popular tradition.’ At any rate, one would expect that the mediaeval writer in adding flesh to the bare bones of the plot, whether or not he was drawing upon an earlier source, would use customs and practices of his own day. There seems little doubt that such was the case with The Tale of Gamelyn, and we shall not be far wrong in assuming that it reflects English country life in the first half of the fourteenth century. The locality in which the action transpires, although as conjectural as the date, may well have been Lincolnshire or Nottinghamshire.’ The first legal act in the poem occurs near the beginning (Il. 57—64)* when Gamelyn’s father, Sir John of Boundys, who holds his land in fee simple and consequently has full power of disposition over it,® makes his will contrary to the rule of primogeniture, to which his friends at first wish to adhere.'® Primogeniture arose through the necessity of military service under the feudal system; for the eldest son would be the one most likely to be capable of bearing arms upon the death of his father, and if a knight holding one knight’s fee divided his land among a number of sons, the lord would have difficulty in placing responsibility for the knight’s service. During the thirteenth century the original reason for impartible succession was disappearing, but in Edward I’s reign the new justifica- tion was substituted that it was necessary ‘in order to maintain a race of wealthy landowners who can see to it that the land is cultivated and the cultivators protected.\" Although primogeniture was slower in gaining authority in free socage lands than in those held by military tenure,” the Statute of Wales\" shows that by 1284 impartible inheritance among male heirs was the established custom of England. Nevertheless, Sir John’s action was not so unusual as might be supposed. Exceptions were always made to the rule, and socages were divided if it could be Mediaeval Law in The Tale of Gamelyn 459 shown that partibility was the custom of the locality or that the lands had pre- viously been divided.“ Although Bereford, C. J., in 1312-13 maintained that land held by knight’s service ‘could not by any usage be parted between males,’ Staunton, in the latter half of the reign of Edward I, had sanctioned the division of such land, ruling that previous partition could make even military lands parti- ble.'® No doubt Sir John is able to divide his lands apparently without legal difficulty because they are not a single holding and are extensive enough for each brother to have at least a knight’s fee.!”? As Frederick Pollock and Frederic W. Maitland'* say, ‘We may believe . . . that in the outer zones of the feudal system the mense lords insisted on the impartibility of the knight’s fee and of the serjeanty, and that these as a general rule passed to the eldest son; but we can not say with any certainty that, if the dead man held two different fees of different lords, his eldest son was entitled to both of them.’ It is to be noted that in order to countermand the division proposed by the knights whom he has called to assist him, Sir John makes a nuncupative will. Such a will was recognized by the law of his day if proved by the testimony of two witnesses.'® He knows the law and wishes to make sure that the knights will prove his will after his death when he says, And I beseke yow, goode men . that lawe conne of londe, For Gamelynes love . that my queste stonde.’ (Il. 63-64) Gamelyn first meets the law in the persons of the sheriff and his deputies (ll. 553-610), who come to arrest him for his assault on the monks. The office of sheriff, well established before the Conquest, was strengthened by the Norman kings.” The sheriff was responsible to the crown for the entire government of the shire — for revenues, military force, police, jails, courts, execution of writs and any orders addressed to him by the king’s courts. It was his duty to appoint an undersheriff, bailiffs, and all other necessary county officials. Although he served without pay, he could, and often did, make the office profitable by fines and extortion. Except for the brief period from 1300 to 1315, when a royal statute” provided for the election of the sheriff by the free landowners of the county, he was appointed by the crown or its representatives.” Since the tenure of ‘office was seldom for life, it is no uncommon circumstance that Gamelyn’s brother succeeds the sheriff who first appears in the poem (I. 697). The appoint- ment of a man of no greater wealth and social position than this brother seems to be an accurate reflection of the times. The sheriff had lost some of his former functions and prestige; and by the fourteenth century, as William A. Morris” writes, ‘the office, once conferred upon great officers of state, is usually held by members of local families who are in theory knights. . . . ’ From the point where Gamelyn takes refuge in the forest to escape the sheriff and joins one of the bands of men living outside the law — so familiar to us through the romantic ballads of Robin Hood — the poem becomes an absorbing record of the processes of criminal law in the fourteenth century; for after a time his serfs bring him the direful news that he has been ‘endited’ and declared a ‘wolves-heed’ (1. 710). The procedure of indictment, stemming from the Assize of as m of re mn t. le ie y, he id ld t, d h ts in e n d e e e e d y i- y d 460 Mediaeval Law in The Tale of Gamelyn of Clarendon (1166) in the reign of Henry II, was not unlike the modern practice of indictment by a grand jury. It consisted of the sworn testimony that a person was suspected of a crime, given in the sheriff’s tourn or before the king’s itinerant justice by a jury of men summoned from the hundred and the vills.* This action required him to stand trial in the king’s court.” If the suspect had not been appre- hended, the justice made inquest of the jury concerning the probable guilt of the accused and, if assured of his culpability, directed by a writ of exigent that he should be exacted in the county court. Exactment meant the reading of the writ, entered on the coroner’s roll, at four successive meetings of the monthly county court, declaring that the offender was liable for outlawry and commanding him to make an appearance in the court.” If he did not do so at the fourth court, he was duly proclaimed an outlaw and his chattels were confiscated by the king. His lands were held by the king for a year and a day and then reverted to the lord by whom they had been granted.?” Obviously, since the king’s assize in each locality was usually held only three times a year,”* and since the proceedings in the county court required at least four months, considerable time elapsed before a man was put ‘outside the law. The custom of calling an outlaw a ‘wolf’s head’ dated back to Anglo-Saxon times and ‘appears to have originated from the circumstance that a price was set on the fugitive equivalent to that at which a wolf’s head was estimated.”* It also seems to have been associated with the idea that an outlaw, like a wolf, was a thing to be destroyed. At the end of the thirteenth century anyone could still kill an outlaw if he resisted arrest or took flight; but if he gave himself up, his life was protected by law until court action could be taken.*° Apparently, Gamelyn has not been aware that the legal wheels have been slowly revolving; for when his men bring him word, it is too late for him to stay the process by appearing in court. He has already been ‘cryed and maad’ a ‘wolves-heed.’ Nevertheless, he goes to the next shire court, at which his brother presides by virtue of his office of sheriff, to protest his outlawry. It is truly what the mediaeval jurist Bracton calls ‘a rash act of daring,’ since, as soon as it has been established in the king’s court that a man has been legally outlawed, he shall be hanged.*! As is to be expected, Gamelyn is put in the royal prison to await the coming of the king’s justice. When Sir Ote arrives to have Gamelyn released on bail, his words to his eldest brother, the sheriff, are: I bidde him to maynpris . that thou graunte him me Til the nexte sitting . of deliveraunce, And thanne lat Gamelyn . stande to his chaunce.’ (Il. 744-746) Although there was originally some distinction between mainprise and bail, the former signifying in general a laxer degree of security, the difference early became slight ;* and there is apparently no distinction in The Tale of Gamelyn. The person acting as surety put up no money or property but stood security for the appear- ance of the accused at the convening of court. The records often speak of the sureties as bound corpus pro corpore; but according to Pollock and Maitland,” as far as they can discover, ‘whether there has been bail or whether there has been Mediaeval Law in The Tale of Gamelyn 461 mainprise, the sureties of the thirteenth century, if they do not produce their man, escape with amercement’; i.e., paying a fine set by the court, not fixed beforehand. The tradition in England, Normandy, and France, however, was for an exacting suretyship, with the surety liable for the punishment meted to the released prisoner. This is the kind understood between Sir Ote and the sheriff, who says, ‘Brother, in swich a forward . I take him to thee; And by thy fader soule . that thee bigat and me, But-if he be redy . whan the Iustice sitte, Thou schalt bere the Iuggement . for al thy grete witte.’ (ll. 747-750) Since amercement was at the discretion of the court, the surety could hardly have been confident of his fate, if he failed to produce his man; and from later developments it is evident that the fear for his own safety expressed by Sir Ote, when Gamelyn prepares to return to the forest (ll. 759-760), is well-founded. The bailing of Gamelyn is particularly interesting because of its apparent illegality and at the same time conformity with contemporary practice. According to the first Statute of Westminster (1275),* an outlaw was ‘in no wise replevis- able.’ Yet a statute of 1299* declared that sheriffs had allowed prisoners freedom on bail contrary to the provisions of the Statute of Westminster and directed the justices of assizes to make inquiry and to punish the sheriffs found guilty of such action. Evidently the sheriffs continued to disregard the law, for in 1330 it was necessary to empower the newly established conservators of the peace to castigate sheriffs or their officers for releasing on mainprise prisoners who were not mainpernable. That Gamelyn is to appear before a justice of jail delivery is manifest in the line, previously quoted (1. 745), referring to the ‘nexte sitting of deliveraunce,’ and this fact requires a brief explanation. The king’s itinerant justices operated under various kinds of commissions from the crown and were specifically com- missioned for each circuit that they made.*” The commissions concerned primarily with criminal matters were those of oyer and terminer and of jail delivery. Justices of oyer and terminer had more general powers than those of jail delivery, and technically the latter could not try a person released on bail, since they were empowered to deal only with those held in jail upon their arrival. But in actual practice, as in Gamelyn’s instance, justices of jail delivery appear to have been given commissions general enough to deal with cases that were not strictly jail delivery The final section of the romance (ll. 769 ff.) is a commentary on trial by jury and different means of influencing justice. Toward the end of the twelfth century, trial by jury became available to an accused in place of the old methods of oath, proof, or combat; and by the middle of the fourteenth century it was established procedure.*® The trial jury in The Tale of Gamelyn corresponds to the modern petty jury. The number of members, though originally variable, had, as we see (1. 871), already crystallized into twelve. These men were selected, if possible, from those who could of their own knowledge testify as to the circumstances of the crime. The defendant was allowed no witnesses, and it was not until the sixteenth nt e- 1e 1e t, m 1€ g. h in n 0 a ll n y a r t e t 462 Mediaeval Law in The Tale of Gamelyn century that it became usual for the jury to rely on the testimony of others,“ While Gamelyn is again with his outlawed comrades in the forest awaiting the next assize, his brother is busy bothe day and other, For to hyre the quest . to hangen his brother. (Il. 785-786) As sheriff, he is responsible for finding the jury; and, as the sheriffs of his day often did, he produces by bribery a jury that will return the desired verdict.“ Unless Gamelyn can show that he has been outlawed illegally, he will automatical- ly hang;® but the vindictive sheriff leaves nothing to chance and, as it turns out, bribes the jury as well to allot the same punishment to Sir Ote, instead of letting him off with amercement. The sentence has been pronounced upon him before Gamelyn’s arrival, for he says, “Thou haddest almost, Gamelyn . dwelled to longe, For the quest is oute on me . that I schulde honge.’ (Il. 839-840) Here seems to be evidence of the growing powers of the jury. At first little more than neighbors of the accused brought in to answer the questions of the king’s justice,“ they were beginning to decide upon his guilt and to have a part in determining his penalty. As William S. Holdsworth“ says, ‘.. . although it was not till the latter part of the seventeenth century that the jury lost their character as witnesses, their character of judges was already predominating in the fourteenth century.’ Gamelyn effects poetic justice by freeing Sir Ote, condemning the justice, the sheriff, and the twelve jurors to death, and quickly hanging them all (Il. 836-886). With a somewhat ironic feeling for legal custom, he himself is no arbitrary lawgiver but selects a jury from among his followers to pronounce judgment. He is able to accomplish this sudden reversal by the threat of his outlaw band outside the moot hall: Durste non to Gamelyn . seye but good, For ferd of the company . that withoute stood. (Il. 853-854) Intimidation of sheriffs, judges, and juries, more frequently by powerful nobles with hired retainers than by outlaw bands, resulted in conditions in the fourteenth century, Mr George M. Trevelyan declares, ‘very much the same as in the bad old feudal days of King Stephen.’ Called ‘maintenance’ and defined as ‘the act of maintaining the cause of a dependent in the King’s Court by a display of force calculated to influence the decision,’ the practice became prevalent at least thirty years before the reign of Richard II and increased throughout the century.“ In the end Gamelyn and Sir Ote not only extricate themselves from their legal predicament by obtaining the king’s personal pardon, but are also rewarded with high offices of the realm. There may be a slight inconsistency with contem- porary law in Gamelyn’s recovery of his lands, since Britton, writing at the end of the thirteenth century, asserts that the king’s release of those who ‘have been legally and deservedly outlawed . . . will not avail them to recover any of the lands or chattels which were theirs before the outlawry’;*” but we may easily sup- Mediaeval Law in The Tale of Gamelyn 463 pose that Gamelyn has been improperly outlawed and consequently is entitled to the return of his real property. The Tale of Gamelyn seems filled with force and disorder. Yet it is clear from the foregoing discussion that the author was well versed in the law of his day and that the poem mirrors accurately and in some detail the uncertain, though gradually developing, processes of justice in the fourteenth century.

Some of the reasons for invalidity of outlawry given by Britton are: fewer than four courts before outlawry pronounced, meetings of the court held at irregular intervals, outlawry pronounced without royal writ or writ of the itinerant justice, coroner not present, the person out- lawed under age, out of the country, detained in prison, and man supposed killed found to be alive. AN AUGUSTINIAN INTERPRETATION OF CHAUCER’S PARDONER By ALFRED L. KELLOGG Tue purpose of the present essay is to suggest that the Pardoner’s Prologue and Tale constitute an integrated study in Augustinian terms of the secret punish- ment of evil. According to St Augustine, the soul which turns in pride from God, the supreme good, to seek its satisfactions in a lesser good, cuts itself off from grace and, like an organ deprived of the blood which nourishes it, begins to corrupt and decay. The struggle of the degenerating nature with this parasitic evil growing within itself produces an earthly hell whose principal characteristics are burning, insatiable longings — ‘concupiscence’ — and a darkened, perverted mentality. To escape this intolerable struggle of the created nature and corrup- tion, of good and evil, the proud sinner seeks to give himself up entirely to evil, but finds no relief from the good within him; he seeks to laugh at and pervert, if he can, the good he sees about him, but still finds neither rest nor relief. The present essay suggests that the portrait of the Pardoner, so often appreciated for its consistency of dramatic development, may be viewed as possessing another and deeper consistency—that of a spiritual degeneration conceived in Augus- tinian terms, the history of a mind averted from God, suffering and struggling against the penalty of its own evil. The essay further suggests that the Augus- tinian doctrine of the punishment of sin, and the additions made to it by Gregory the Great, were not only available to Chaucer, but to some extent appear in his Parson’s Tale. I ‘Est enim hic quaedam poena occulta’ In the teaching of Augustine,’ all sin is by the judgment of God punished, and if we look deeper, self-punished. Even the sin which to mortal eyes escapes pun- ishment is overtaken by a secret penalty, and that penalty is the progressive mental deformity and suffering which sin itself inflicts upon its perpetrator — the ‘secreta mentis poena.’ To understand this doctrine of the punishment of sin by sin, it is necessary first to examine certain assumptions on which the doctrine proceeds — the nature of the human soul, the effect on the human soul of original sin — and then to present against this background the progressive punishment of the spirit which defies God and gives itself up to sin. To St Augustine the human soul is at its creation good, the product of a good Creator. The created nature,” however, is not a part of God, but was created out of nothing. Hence, while God remains the perfect and immutable good, the creature, possessing an imperfect nature, is a mutable and lesser good. From this imperfection follows the possibility of sin. The will, like the intellect a part and function of the mutable nature, is free to adhere to God, the supreme good, or to avert itself from God to seek its own satisfactions in lesser goods. A lesser good is anything except God. 465 _| 0 : 466 Augustinian Interpretation of Chaucer’s Pardoner At the Fall the human will did in fact avert itself from God, preferring the created to the Creator. From this aversion, this separation from God which is the act of sin, followed the two penalties of the Fall: ignorance and concupiscence. Because it departed wilfully from the light of God, the mind became darkened and weakened in its ability to know the truth. Because it separated itself from the source of its being, the nature, which was created good, began to revert to the nothingness from which it came; it began to corrupt and decay. The disease and division of the nature, which afflicts the mind with ignorance, afflicts the will with concupiscence. The good nature lusts (‘concupiscit’) against the evil flaw within itself, striving to remove it utterly; the destructive, corrupting evil lusts against the nature, striving to consume it and to reduce it to nothing. This state of ‘infirmitas,’ of opposing lusts struggling against each other for domination of the will, is concupiscence — and concupiscence every man in- herited from Adam.’ It is against this background of a vitiated nature — darkened and divided — that the Augustinian doctrine of the punishment of sin by sin proceeds. The first step in this progress is the aversion of the now divided will from God. As St Augustine envisions it, the will is, through its division, faced by two alterna- tives — the way of humility and the way of pride. The good nature, created by God, urges the will to recognize its infirmity, to turn to God as the source of its being, and with divine aid to resist the evil lusts within it. This is the way of hu- mility. Concupiscence, the lust of the parasitic evil, urges the will to turn from God, to regard the rebellious desires it experiences not as the penalty of a just God but as a world of pleasure to be exploited to the full. This is the way of pride. If the will follows humility and turns to God, the grace of God restores in some measure the nature corrupted by the Fall. If, despite its knowledge of the ex- istence of God, the will follows pride, it averts itself from God in full awareness of its act, and in that aversion launches itself upon the career of progressive punishment which it is the business of the present section to explore.‘ That punishment may perhaps be summarized as the immediate judgment of God, the struggle against that judgment, and the ultimate judgment of God. The immediate judgment of God upon the aversion of the will is misery, the misery of mental anguish and mental deformity. Primarily the punishment is an intensification of the two penalties of original sin: ignorance and concupiscence. The intellect is further darkened; concupiscence is increased. The conception of concupiscence is here of extreme importance, for through concupiscence sin and suffering become synonymous. When the will yields to the concupiscence it inherited from the Fall, the good nature is diminished and suffers; the parasitic evil which consumes the nature increases and gains in power. The more one sins, the more concupiscence, the lust of the parasitic evil against the created nature, increases — and with it the darkness of moral ignorance. The more concupiscence and ignorance increase, the more one sins. Concupiscence and ignorance generate sin and sin concupiscence and ignorance in an endless pro- gression. At each step the destruction and suffering of the created nature in- creases. Thus through concupiscence sin becomes the penalty of sin.’ In the Augustinian Interpretation of Chaucer's Pardoner 467 Enarratio in Psalmum LVITI St Augustine gives perhaps his most vivid account of these sufferings. ‘Evil concupiscence,’ he says, ‘is like a burning and a flame.’ ‘He who disdains to conquer that concupiscence with which, through the conta- gion of sin, he is born, and excites and foments further lusts, shall not easily conquer these lusts, but divided against himself, shall be consumed in his own fire.’ But, as St Augustine further informs us, the flame which falls as a judgment upon sin has nothing in common with light; it is darkness as well as fire, an ‘ignis fumosus’ in which the sinner loses the sight of God. One may gain a somewhat clearer insight into these punishments if he notes that, according to Gregory the Great, ignorance and concupiscence together constitute an earthly counterpart to the black flame of hell.’ But the mind in sin is not simply tor- mented and stultified; it is altered in more subtle ways closely connected with ignorance and concupiscence but less frequently mentioned by Augustine: it is both perverted and embittered. The mind is perverted because the act of sin is perversion in that it prefers what is less — the creature or created thing — to what is supreme, the Creator.* The mind is embittered because it has shut itself off from God, losing thereby sweetness and light (an idea for which St Augustine is not indebted to Matthew Arnold or Swift) and gaining shadows and bitter- ness.’ Thus, as St Augustine conceives of him, the man who defies God is no exalted being, but the pain-racked, mentally deformed captive of an earthly Hell. The struggles of the captive to escape this hell are like those of a fish with the hook in his-jaws. He seeks to plunge to depths where the pain and inescapable attraction he feels will somehow be lost — to find in love of the creature and created thing compensation for his lack of internal happiness.'° He likewise seeks cunningly to fight back, to gain relief from his pain by venting the hatred his embittered mind bears toward the sense of God he feels to be bound up with that pain. He hates the peace of God that binds together creation; he hates those who serve God. Like Satan, his vengeance takes the pattern of his perverted mind, and he attempts to pervert those who enjoy a state to which he himself cannot attain.\" Alternately fleeing and attacking, his life is given up to evil and his spirit to progressive degeneration. It is extremely important to note in this connection that the Augustinian conceptions of the punishment of sin by sin, and of pride as the first of the sins, were formalized by Gregory the Great — per- haps the most notable transmitter of the Augustinian tradition to the Middle Ages — into a progress of the seven deadly sins. This progress of sin punishing sin originates in pride, moves through the sins of the spirit, and ends in the more material sins — avarice, gluttony, and lechery. Gregory, like Augustine, con- siders misery the effect of this progress. At least one commentator speaks of the effect as a kind of hell.” At the end of his progress, the rebel has experienced nothing but pain and frustration. He has solved nothing. The good he finds offensive he is powerless to pervert unless God for His own purposes wills it. The pain he would be rid of he can never escape, for the good nature, the work of God within him which experiences the pain, can never be destroyed no matter how deeply he sins.“ he is m to se il t y 5 t 468 Augustinian Interpretation of Chaucer’s Pardoner At the end of his progress, as at every point in it, the rebel is still torn by the same struggle of good and evil, confronted by the same two alternatives — hu- mility and pride. He may still return to God, although the difficulty of such a return has been immensely increased by the damage will and intellect have suffered from sin; or he may, despite his misery, still prefer himself to God, his own diseased will to the will of God, the painful pleasures he feverishly pursues to the peace of God. If pride is his choice, the way is opened to the most terrible judgment of God — to be permitted success in his sins, to be abandoned to the lusts of his own heart, ‘in concupiscentias cordis sui.’ Upon this text of Paul (Romans i, 24) St Augustine relies heavily, especially in the influential exposi- tions of Psalms XXXV and LVII. They who knew God, says Augustine in the Enarratio in Psalmum XXXV, but spurned Him with the foot of pride and yielded him neither worship nor thanks, are handed over to concupiscence to suffer the pangs of their own lusts.\"* And in the Enarratio in Psalmum LVII he says further of the punishment of the proud: ‘Upon this earth there is a secret punishment . . . “Like wax before the flame,” as the Psalmist declares, “they shall be dissolved and carried away.” Through the lusts of their own hearts, as I have said, shall this be accomplished . . . But these punishments few see, and therefore are they most highly commended of the Spirit of God. Hear the words of the Apostle: “God has yielded them up to the lusts of their own hearts.” Thus, in Augustine’s view, the ultimate judgment of God upon pride is to permit it to go its successful way into a kind of fiery bath of its own lusts — a penalty few see, the beginning and end of which is damnation.” That Chaucer knew or had every opportunity of knowing the Augustinian doctrine of the secret punishment of sin through concupiscence, is not difficult to demonstrate. Chaucer, like his contemporaries Langland and Gower, evi- dently possessed a general knowledge of concupiscence, for he devotes a section of The Parson’s Tale to a discussion of it.!* The more specialized doctrine of the punishment of actual sin through concupiscence — which appears in The Par- son’s Tale only in fragmentary form — Chaucer could have encountered in any number of works in any number of connections, for the doctrine had become central to the mediaeval conception of sin.'® If, for instance, Chaucer had at- tempted to ‘bulte it to the bren’ with Bishop Bradwardine, as in The Nun’s Priest’s Tale he intimates he did, he would have found the punishment of sin through concupiscence explained in terms of the two expositions of Augustine (Psalms xxxv, Lv) cited above. Bradwardine says in part: Every penalty of sin is just . . . as is clearly stated in Romans I concerning those who when they knew God did not glorify Him as God or give thanks. Therefore God yielded them up to the desires of their own hearts — to filth. And of this matter one may read in Augustine on Psalm 35. ‘Hear,’ he says, ‘what is the foot of pride: they who when they knew God did not glorify Him as God. Therefore there came unto them the foot of pride, whence they came into the depths of sin’ . . . and on Psalm 57: ‘Like wax before the flame shall they be carried away,’ and he says, “These punishments few see, and therefore does the Spirit of God most earnestly commend them to our attention. Hear the Apostle saying, ‘God has yielded them up, etc.’ This same doctrine of concupiscence as suffering and retribution for sin Chaucer Augustinian Interpretation of Chaucer’s Pardoner 469 could also have come upon in John of Salisbury, to whom he is indebted for illustrative material used in The Pardoner’s Tale and from whom recent investi- gation indicates he is most likely to have derived his ideas on Lollius.” In Book I of the Policraticus, John of Salisbury defines the relationship between pride and concupiscence, indicating the punishment which pursues those who through pride not only fail to repress concupiscence, but even stimulate the desire to sin: ‘Let him who fails to curb this love (pride), fear the leprosy (concupiscence) and the moral blindness which threaten to follow from it. If indeed those who fail to repress concupiscence . . . lose Salvation, what shall be the punishment of those who inflame concupiscence as with the blandishments of flatterers . . . what shall they suffer who . . . practice the excitement of all the senses?” The De Contemptu Mundi of Innocent III, which Chaucer translated and from which he seems to have borrowed in The Pardoner’s Tale,* expresses much the same idea from a more striking point of view. Discussing the torments of hell, Innocent points out in highly Augustinian language that hell is not the sole place of torment, for the sinner can never in any place be apart from the flame of concupiscence which torments him. Hell he carries with him. “To him who has rejected God every place is a place of punishment, for he bears with him cease- lessly his own punishment, and wherever he turns encounters torment. “I will produce,” says God, “from within you the flame which shall devour you” (Ezech. xxviii).”™4 The same punishment, expressed in terms of the progress of the seven deadly sins into which Gregory had recast the Augustinian doctrine of the punishment of sin by sin, Chaucer could very easily have known, for he himself uses this progress in his discussion of the seven deadly sins in The Parson’s Tale.” The idea of an earthly hell as the effect of progressive sin would have been available to him in a manual of the type he used as the source of this same tale. The Com- pendium Theologicae Veritatis describes the progress of the seven deadly sins and declares that the effect of sin ‘creates of man Hell, for within the sinner is the flame of avarice, the stench of lechery, the shadows of ignorance, the worm of conscience, the thirst of concupiscence.” Chaucer, then, must have known something about the ‘secreta mentis poena’ which overtakes the proud sinner in his aversion from God. He understood concupiscence in general; he knew, or had every opportunity of knowing, the doctrine of the punishment of sin by sin; he had come into contact with the progress of the seven deadly sins into which the conception of the hell produced by sin had been transmuted. If we would see with the eyes of St Augustine — or with the eyes of one who, like Chaucer, lived in a world impregnated with Augustinian ideas and atti- tudes — evil which proudly struts before the world and defying God rejoices in its own power and success, is only a hollow shell concealing torments which are a kind of prefiguration of those of hell. Such men are not to be feared or envied. Their bellies are full of the secret judgments of God: ‘even they who rejoice in evil are secretly wretched, for God has yielded them up to the lusts of their own hearts.”?? the 1u- 1a ve his les ble he ul si- he nd to he et ey as nd ds 16 it ly in It i. 1e y n e d n y 4 470 Augustinian Interpretation of Chaucer’s Pardoner II ‘Sed istas poenas pauci vident’ The previous section has attempted to trace the career of the proud apostate from God and Chaucer’s knowledge of the punishment which attends upon that career. It has shown the beginning of this progress in the aversion of the will from God; the immediate judgment of God which is misery; the human attempt to avoid that misery; the ultimate judgment of God. What evidences of this universal pattern, alike inevitable to angel or man, are to be discovered in Chau- cer’s treatment of the Pardoner? In reply it may perhaps be said — if one is willing to admit the psychology of Augustinian theology as well as the psy- chology of dramatic presentation — that beneath the surface of dramatic nar- rative a fairly consistent line of development in terms of this pattern is to be observed. In the Prologue one finds a concentrated study of the evil, destructive side of the Pardoner: his aversion from God through pride, his defiance of the judgment of God. In the Tale, which is told as a continuation of this defiance of Divine Providence, there is conveyed paradoxically the power of Divine Provi- dence: one begins to see emerging through the Pardoner’s defiance the inevitable judgment of God, the tormenting struggle of good and evil, of humility and pride, to which his aversion has made him heir. In the final confession (lines 916-918) there springs forth suddenly, fully disclosed, the side of the Pardoner’s being he has been striving so feverishly to conceal — the nature, created good, suffering, indestructible whose very presence makes the Pardoner’s existence a hidden torment and his whole way of life folly. Of the final judgment of God, Chaucer tells us nothing. At the end of the Prologue, in the speech with which the Pardoner climaxes his cynical disclosures, Chaucer gives us simply and directly the key to the Pardoner’s personality: What, trowe ye, that whiles I may preche, And wynne gold and silver for I teche, That I wol lyve in poverte wilfully? Nay, nay, I thoghte it nevere, trewely! For I wol preche and begge in sondry landes; I wol nat do no labour with myne handes, Ne make baskettes, and lyve therby, By cause I wol nat beggen ydelly. I wol noon of the apostles countrefete; I wol have moneie, wolle, chese, and whete, Al were it yeven of the povereste page, Or of the povereste wydwe in a village, Al sholde hir children sterve for famyne. Nay, I wol drynke licour of the vyne, And have a joly wenche in every toun.”* In this speech upon his will the Pardoner demonstrates not only the aversion of the will from God which is common to all sin, but the pure refusal of the will to serve God which is the sin of pride. The Pardoner sets himself up as his own end in place of God. In the full knowledge of the existence of God upon which Augustinian Interpretation of Chaucer’s Pardoner 471 St Augustine lays so much emphasis, he refuses to serve God. A more completely satisfactory fulfillment of the Augustinian definition of pride would be difficult to find.?® But this speech is only the climax. If we review what the Pardoner has told us about himself, we find that all the unamiable qualities upon which he congratulates himself: his contempt for his fellow human beings, his refusal to admit correction, his hypocrisy, his shamelessness, his boasting of the harm he does, all are to be found in Chaucer’s discussion of the sin of pride in The Parson’s Tale.*° It is worth noting that Chaucer’s description of the pride of (1e Pardoner, who will not ‘lyve in poverte wilfully,’ is the exact antithesis of his description of the humility of Christ, who ‘in wilful poverte chees to lyve his lyf.’* The judgment of God, the inescapable hell within which is the penalty of that pride, the Pardoner is extremely interested in concealing, for he is a man, as he eagerly informs us, whom justice cannot touch. Yet in the Prologue one senses his punishment in certain typical actions of the sinner defying the penalty of his sin — the attempt to escape where pain cannot follow, the attempt to pervert and destroy the offending good. The Pardoner’s attempted escape from the pains of thought is shrewdly cal- culated by Chaucer. We find that the objects among which the Pardoner revels are money, wine, and women — at least one in every town.” These pleasures are not without a plan. They are simultaneously the typical sins of all pardoners: avaricia, gula, luxuria,* and a very significant pattern in the progressive de- generation of the human spirit. These three sins in the order stated constitute a progression within the seven deadly sins — the final three — and suggest thereby the final resort of the creature which has lost its happiness in the sins of the spirit and now seeks to lose its misery in the more physical sins. In discussing this progression, Gregory the Great says of avarice: ‘Because within itself the troubled heart has lost the good of happiness, it seeks consolation outside itself; the less internal happiness it has to return to, the more it seeks to obtain external goods.’ And he adds that to avarice are joined the two carnal sins of gluttony and lechery. It is to be noted that in The Parson’s Tale these words of Gregory are quoted in the context of this very progression.** Thus, since Chaucer indicates in The Parson’s Tale his familiarity with the significance of this progression, and in the Pardoner’s speech on his will presents these sins in their conventional or- der,* one may suppose that Chaucer is here suggesting the loss of happiness which begins with the initial sin of pride as the impelling force behind the Par- doner’s progress through avarice, gluttony, and lechery. It is indicative of Chaucer’s skill as a literary artist at all levels that he is able so effortlessly to fuse the theological pattern with the realistic pattern of the recognized sins of the institutional pardoner. The second typical action of the defiant apostate is the attempt to pervert, to overthrow, to render ridiculous the order of the universe so painfully opposite to the disorder of his own soul. The Prologue also shows us this aspect of the Pardoner’s mind in some detail. Like Satan and Iago he delights in evil: Myne handes and my tonge goon so yerne That it is joye to se my bisynesse.** ostate n that e will tempt f this Chau- one is > psy- Nar- to be uctive of the nce of Provi- itable y and (lines oner’s good, nce a God, naxes o the rsion 2 will own yhich 472 Augustinian Interpretation of Chaucer’s Pardoner but unlike Satan and Iago, his perversion takes an essentially comic form. Under his perverted comic genius everything turns from its proper nature. A sermon against avarice and her followers, gluttony and lechery —the Pardoner’s cherished sins — becomes a sermon in financial support of them;*’ the essential regulation which forbade pardoners to grant indulgences to any who were not properly confessed becomes subtly intermingled with his false relics and emerges as a selling device which earns him a hundred marks a year;** a supposed holy relic becomes the means by which adultery may be committed with impunity;* moist and corny ale becomes an aid to holy meditation. As the Pardoner puts it: I moot thynke Upon som honest thyng while that I drynke.“ Irony, the humor of inversion, is the appropriate expression of the mind whose values sin has inverted.“ The perversion of Christian doctrine, the incongruity he is able to effect, is not only a reflection of the Pardoner’s perverted mind, but a source of necessary gratification to it. The Pardoner has within himself a dark unhappy bitterness and malice which claims its pound of flesh. The ironic note of triumph is rather distinct, for instance, in the Pardoner’s description of his credentials: Oure lige lordes seel on my patente, That shewe I first, my body to warente, That no man be so boold, ne preest ne clerk, Me to destourbe of Cristes hooly werk. In these lines the Pardoner proclaims the complete superiority of his evil will to God or man. He laughs at human law because it protects him; at the parish priest because he is powerless; at the ‘lewed peple’ because they cannot see be- hind his hypocrisy; at God, because he, a miserable mortal, parodies Christian doctrine with complete impunity. Order is turned upside down. But the Par- doner’s jokes are all in one way or another directed at the idea of God, and in this constant attempt to turn ‘up-so-doun’ we can see his terrible need to ridicule and reduce to absurdity the sense of the presence of God from which he can never escape. At the end of the Prologue we have examined rather thoroughly the evil of the Pardoner. We have seen the genesis of evil within his soul, his revelling in the physical sins, his delight in overturning the good he sees about him. We have further glimpsed in these typical actions of degeneration and perversion the attempt of the tortured mind to escape the judgment it has brought upon itself. The tale which the Pardoner tells is of course neatly integrated with his announced theme of avarice. In its immediate dramatic effect it is as delightful as ‘hende Nicholas’s’ appeal to John the Carpenter’s knowledge of Scripture in averting the effects of the second flood. Like the tale of the flood, the story of the three rioters gives the ignorant listener the precious sense of peering into ‘Goddes pryvetee.’ Essentially it is a simple device of dramatic irony by which the audience comes gradually to understand that the Old Man is not just an old man but something unimaginably mysterious and terrible,“ while the three male- factors are denied this superior position and understand nothing of the sort. Augustinian Interpretation of Chaucer’s Pardoner 473 With fascinated horror the ‘lewed peple’ watch the inevitable movement of divine justice and are overwhelmed at the neatness and simplicity with which the villains are dispatched. The moral is clear to them: evil — and particularly avarice — is self-destructive. The sense of their own wealth becomes oppressive. They press forward to rid themselves of so dangerous a commodity and to receive the absolution of this holy man who has peered so deeply into the ways of Divine Providence. But the Pardoner’s tale contains more than the simple plot necessary to gratify the not particularly elevated intelligence of his imagined typical audience. The meaning of the ingeniously chosen motto of his drama, ‘Radix malorum est Cupiditas,’ is not exhausted by its use as an encouragement to contributors; it suggests pride and the evil will more than it does avarice.“ The protagonists of his drama take on qualities which are not simply dramatic. They are drawn from the core of the Pardoner’s being; they are personifications of the two forces which are ever in combat in his mind. The Tale is a mirror of that never- ceasing struggle. The essential contrast of The Pardoner’s Tale is between living in accordance with ‘Goddes wille’ and living ‘right at our owene wille, the eternal antithesis of the pride of Satan and the humility of Christ. As in the nearly converse situa- tion which Gower presents in the “Trump of Death,’ Age represents the earthly functioning of the divine law, and those who fail to reverence in age the divine law, Pride.“ This contrast is first presented in the meeting of the three gamesters and the Old Man. The latter greets them ‘ful mekely’; the ‘proudeste’ of the three answers him in a very opposite fashion: What, carl, with sory grace! Why artow al forwrapped save thy face? Why lyvestow so longe in so greet age?*’ Once this contrast has been established, the opposing sets of values are pre- sented quite consistently. If we consider the three rioters as a group, we find that this characteristic of pride, of setting oneself up as one’s own absolute good, is constant and unvaried. The three set out upon a noble enterprise, to save mankind from the false traitor, Death. Thereupon, in epic fashion, they swear brotherhood : Togidres han thise three hir trouthes plight To lyve and dyen ech of hem for oother.* But once individual profit has appeared, the epic bond begins to undergo a strange perversion.*® Says the first rioter to his remaining companion after the youngest has gone for wine: Thou knowest wel thou art my sworen brother; Thy profit wol I telle thee anon.” Profit, one immediately discovers, contains a tendency toward oneness. The fact that the removal of one sworn brother should appear a ‘frendes torn’ to the others illustrates some characteristics of this oneness: the moral blindness and Perversion of normal values which occupy the hearts of those whose God is self. der 100 tial not ges oly it: ose is ry her of in ve he if. ul in he es ne in e- t. 474 Augustinian Interpretation of Chaucer’s Pardoner If we would discover in the youngest some nobler quality, we find instead only a more perfect example of the same singleness of self-devotion. The Old Man is very different. To the pride of the rioters he opposes humility, Although he is not fond of his grim position as world executioner, he will con- tinue ‘As longe tyme as it is Goddes wille.’ To their violence, impatience, and instability he opposes a granite stability and dignity: ‘I moot go thider as I have to go.”*' The Old Man possesses dignity because he possesses humility. He is at once the symbol of the unassailable might of divine government and the sym- bol of obedience and humility, of the soul angelic or human which subjects its own will to the will of God. The revellers dispatched in the midst of appropriate agonies and his moving collection peroration ended, the Pardoner has completed his sermon and with it the brilliant record of his successful defiance of God. Law, sermon, relics, all have been perverted to serve his ends. Even the moral exemplum with its dark tones of divine retribution has fulfilled an altered function. That tale which preaches the divine punishment of sin, which reflects the futility of his own life and fore- shadows his ultimate defeat, the Pardoner has used to demonstrate the superior- ity of his own will to divine punishment, by the example of his own impunity to render the very idea of retribution laughable. But he has not told us the cost of this defiance. What the tale reveals is precisely the price he has paid: the struggle of good and evil, of humility and pride, in which, as St Augustine informs us, the nature divided against itself is consumed as by a black flame.” But no one, the Pardoner is sure, has glimpsed the corroding Hell which con- cupiscence has produced within him. He stands before the Pilgrims the complete successful sinner. With satisfaction he pauses: ‘And lo, sires, thus I preche.”® Perhaps in the faces he sees before him there is a kind of beauty that makes him ugly.™ Perhaps behind the grinning mask with which he gleefully goes about his work of damnation, he may sense the grinning mask of Satan.® Perhaps the futility and suffering which is his life demands more than the sublimation his twisted mind has attempted in the tale of Death and the Three Rioters. But whatever be the impelling force, from the depths of his being comes revulsion, the voice of the created nature, the work of God within him which no evil can ever obliter- ate — which even in the midst of evil cannot lose its love of the good.* And Jhesu Crist, that is oure soules leche, So graunte yow his pardoun to receyve, For that is best; I wol yow nat deceyve.*” ‘May God grant you the grace to receive His pardon,’ he says, ‘the true pardon I cannot buy or sell. So may you never come where I am.’ The creature of God speaks like a creature, in humility, but only for a moment. The whole fiction of his joyous life has vanished and the anguish of his soul is laid bare. In desperation he gambles on one magnificent piece of salesmanship — to make the Pilgrims venerate his relics even though they know them to be false.* If this be carried off even in jest, it will more than recoup for him his mastery, for the Pilgrims will then knowingly join him in his own sacrilege, will laugh with him in his heretical pranks. If he can but find one man to begin — perhaps Augustinian Interpretation of Chaucer’s Pardoner 475 a man of the world — Harry Bailly! But for once the Pardoner’s stage sense fails utterly.°° Harry Bailly replies with a vehemence which spares nothing, and the Pardoner’s discomfiture is welcomed with violent laughter. Only the Knight is able to save the situation and bring the two together: ‘Anon they kiste, and ryden forth hir weye.’* Evil which has appeared so formidable and destructive is dissipated in laughter; evil which has seemed so repulsive and inhuman is absorbed into the pattern of existence and the universe goes on undisturbed. In this conclusion I think we are very near the heart of Chaucer — the pro- found faith which enabled him to look upon the existence of evil unperturbed and to portray the perpetrators of evil with love and kindness. Like St Augustine Chaucer saw no untamed evil in the universe, but only the will of God fulfilling itself even in the acts of the evil: “Therefore God uses the evil, not according to their own depraved wills, but according to His righteous will. For just as the evil make an evil use of their good nature, that is, of his good creation; so does the good God make a good use even of the works of the evil, that His will be nowhere overcome.”® Like St Augustine, Chaucer saw no man who was not worthy of love; he hated with a perfect hatred — he hated the vice and loved the man: ‘And since no one is evil by nature but only by vice, he who lives according to God owes the evil a perfect hatred: let him not hate the man because of his vice, nor love the vice because of the man, but hate the vice and love the man.’® And this, I think, is the unity and diversity in Chaucer’s presentation of the Pardoner. In his treatment of the Pardoner’s practices we feel his indignation; in his treatment of the Pardoner himself we feel only pity. The evils the Pardoner visits upon the world are worthy of indignation; the Pardoner himself is very pitiable. He is an apostate from God, a pariah amidst society. His life is a wretched and pitiful pretense. Chaucer treats him gently because the Pardoner’s vice is its own punishment: ‘Sed et omnis locus reprobis est poenalis, qui semper secum defert cruciatum, et ubique contra se tormentum incurrit.” Of the ultimate end of the Pardoner, Chaucer, who refused to follow Troilus and Arcite to their last abode, tells us nothing. The Pardoner has fulfilled virtual- ly every requirement for damnation, but like all human beings, he is to Chaucer somehow not quite damnable.® Rutgers UNIvERSITY ' The ensuing discussion of the Augustinian doctrine, as indeed the whole paper, is much indebted to the generous personal assistance of Professor Robert L. Calhoun of the Yale Divinity School. * The term “nature” denotes the whole created being, of which the soul is of course a part. ‘For a general treatment of the Augustinian doctrine, see M. L. Burton, The Problem of Evil (Chicago, 1909). Concupiscence in its relation to original sin may be found inG. A. Riggan, Original Sin in the Thought of St. Augustine (Unpublished Yale Dissertation, 1949), pp. 246-256. ‘Humility i is the recognition of man’s vitiated nature as the penalty imposed by God at the Fall; it is the submission of the will to God through which the soul receives grace, and regeneration be- comes possible. Pride is the opposition of the will of the creature to the will of God, the Creator; it is at once the aversion of the will from God to lesser goods by which the soul loses grace, and the per- version of values by which the soul abandons God as the ultimate good and sets itself up as its own Principle of action (see below, n. 8). Both these aspects can be seen in the definition of pride in the De ly a ity. on- and ave : is ym- its ing h it ave nes hes yre- or- to of gle the on- ete im his ity ed ver ice on at. is gh ps 476 Augustinian Interpretation of Chaucer’s Pardoner Civitate Dei: ‘Quid est autem superbia, nisi perversae celsitudinis appetitus? Perversa enim celsitudo est, deserto eo cui debet animus inhaerere principio, sibi quodammodo fieri atque esse principium’ (Migne, Patrologia Latina (hereafter cited as PL}, x11, 420). It is characteristic of those who follow Pride that they regard concupiscence as a source of pleasure and seek to enjoy rather than conquer it (see p. 469) and that, though aware of the existence of God, they yield God neither worship nor thanks: ‘Qui cum cognovissent Deum, non ut Deum glorificaverunt, aut gratias egerunt’ [Romans 1, 21] (Enarratio in Psalmum XXXV [PL, xxxvi, 349]). On this last aspect, the aversion of the will from God in the full knowledge of the existence of God, St Augustine lays especial emphasis. 5 The simplest statement by Augustine of this doctrine is to be found in the Contra Julianum Pelagianum: ‘ita concupiscentia carnis ...et peccatum est ...et poena peccati... et causa pec. cati’ (PL, xt1v, 787). The doctrine may be found in detailed form in almost any discussion of sin, One may cite Gregory the Great (Homiliarum in Ezechiel. 1, xi [PL, uxxv1, 915-916]), Peter Lombard (Sent., 11, xxxvi [PL, cxcu, 738]), Bradwardine (De Causa Dei, 1, xxxiv [London, 1618], pp. 296-297), Compendium Theologicae Veritatis, 11, vii, in Beati Alberti Magni Opera (Lyons, 1651), xu, 55. In his brief exposition of the origin of sin, Chaucer’s Parson states in rudimentary form the punishment of sin by sin when he says ‘and that that was erst but oonly peyne of concupiscence, is afterward bothe peyne and synne’ (X [I] 384 in Complete Works, ed. F. N. Robinson [Boston, 1933], p. 282). *‘Concupiscentia mala quasi ardor est et ignis.’ ‘Qui autem illam concupiscentiam, cum qua de peccati propagine natus est, contemnit vincere, et multas adhuc excitat exseritque lididines, difficulter eas superat, et adversus se ipse divisus, igne proprio concrematur’ (Enarratio in Psalmum LV II (PL, XXXVI, 687, 689]). ‘Supercecidit ignis, et non viderunt solem . . . ignis superbiae, ignis fumosus, ignis concupiscentiae, ignis iracundiae’ (Enarratio in Psalmum LVII [PL, xxxvi, 688)). 7 Gregory the Great seems rather clearly to have extended to the punishments of hell the idea of the double penalty of concupiscence and ignorance expressed by Augustine in the Enarratio in Psalmum LVII. In the universally known Moralia he explains, very much in Augustinian terms, the simul- taneous presence of flame and darkness in hell. Citing Psalm LVII, he says: ‘Natura vero ignis est, ut ex se ipso et lumen exhibeat, et concremationem; sed transactorum illa ultrix flamma vitiorum con- cremationem habet, et lumen non habet. . . . Hinc etiam Psalmista ait: Super eos cecidit ignis et non viderunt solem (Peal. tvu1, 9) . . . Hic flamma quae succendit illuminat; illic, ut superius verbis Psalm- istae docuimus, ignis qui cruciat obscurat’ (Moralium, rx, [PL, uxxv, 912, 914]). Peter Lombard follows Gregory in declaring that the corruption of the nature produced by sin is like the flame of hell (Sententiarum, u, xxxvi [PL, cxcu, 738]), while the Compendium Theologicae Veritatis states that hell is within the sinner (see below, p. 469). That Chaucer was aware of the tradition of the dark flame may be gathered from The Parson’s Tale: ‘the derke light that shal come out of the fyr that evere shal brenne’ (X [I] 188). Milton’s famous ‘darkness visible’ proceeding from the flames of hell would seem also to be a lineal descendant. (Paradise Lost, 1, 63.) 8 In aversion from God, the act of sin, is implied perversion: ‘Vivit apud te semper bonum nostrum; et quia inde aversi sumus, perversi sumus’ (Confessionum, rv, xvi [PL, xxx, 706]). According to St Augustine, the perversion and corruption of sin are opposed to the order and existence of creation. Be- cause sin deprives the creature of the source of his being, it causes the created nature to corrupt. Because it inverts the order of existence by preferring the lesser to the supreme, sin produces within the sinner an inversion or perversion of values. As Chaucer’s Parson puts it: ‘And ye shul understonde that in mannes synne is every manere of ordre or ordinaunce turned up-so-doun’ (X [I] 260). Thus existence and order are aspects of the creation of God, while perversion and corruption degrade existence and order toward non-being and disorder: ‘inordinatio vero non esse; quae perversio etiam nominatur atque corruptio’ (De Moribus Manichaeorum, u, vi [PL, xxxu, 1348)). * ‘a luce relinquitur, a tenebris occupatur; vacuatur dulcedine, impletur amaritudine’ (Sermones de Tempore (PL, xxx1x, 1974)). 10 See Confessionum, u, ii [PL, xxx, 675-676)). 11 To St Augustine happiness is living in conformity with the order of the universe. Conversely the order of the universe forbids that sin, which is disorder, should effect anything but misery: ‘si peccats fiant, et desit miseria . . . dehonestat ordinem iniquitas. Cum autem non peccantibus adest beatitudo, perfecta est universitas’ (De Lib. Arbit., 11 [PL, xxxu, 1284]). Bitterness, itself a penalty of disorder or sin, can be removed only by resuming one’s proper relation to God. If the sinner refuses to submit hin Go me veli env (De Aug thr Aug that the who Exe orde prid Gre; God spec ton men prog r to ca ated remo that dirair we Dixi comn eorum n 7 sin an perm: —ab Augu: what since | exposi permi! Peccar ire’ (D WS 1, $11) 9124; ed. G, Se Augustinian Interpretation of Chaucer’s Pardoner 477 himself to God, his bitterness is increased and expresses itself in hatred of everything connected with God, even in envious hatred of the good man whose happiness, so opposite to his own misery, tor- ments him: ‘Quid est invidia, nisi odium felicitatis alienae? . . . Quis vero sit invidus, qui non ei malum velit, cujus bono cruciatur?’ (Sermo CCCLIII (PL, xxx1x, 1561}). The great example of this bitter envy is, of course, Satan, who perverted man through envy of the unfallen state he had himself lost (De Civ. Dei, xtv, xi). [t is to Augustine that the conception of the Seven Deadly Sins seems ultimately to be indebted. Augustine’s principal contribution to the doctrine is the central idea of concupiscence as a force through which sin becomes the penalty of sin in an unending sequence (see above, p. 466 and n. 5). Augustine also establishes in the Enarratio in Psalmum LVII that pride is the first of the sins and that all other sins are penalties of this primary one [PL, xxxv1, 687-688]). However, he never takes the final step of setting up the order in which the major sins follow from pride. Gregory the Great, who in a much quoted passage follows Augustine in his definition of the punishment of sin (Hom. in Buch., 1, xi [PL, uxxvi, 915-916]), does in fact go beyond Augustine and establish the first major order of the seven deadly sins. The sins as he there states themin the order of their descent from pride are: vainglory (later assimilated into pride), envy, wrath, sorrow, avarice, gluttony, lechery. Gregory’s conception of the effect of this progress is the same as Augustine’s. The spirit separated from God loses happiness and gains misery. However, Gregory places avarice, gluttony, and lechery in a special position. The spirit loses its happiness in the sins of the spirit, and thereafter, in avarice, glut- tony, and lechery, the more material sins, seeks relief from its sufferings. (Moralium, xxx1, xlv (PL, xxv1, 620-622]). The Compendium Theologicae Veritatis gives a portion of the definition of Gregory mentioned above, and following it a complete progress of the sins. It observes that the effect of this progress is a kind of hell (see below, p. 469). 4 De Civ. Dei, xiv, xxvi-vii (PL, x1, 434-436). 4 Logically sin, which deprives the created nature of the source of its being, might be expected to cause its complete disintegration. This is not, however, true. Divine Providence forbids any cre- ated thing to come to nothing (De Mor. Man., u1, vii [PL, xxx, 1349]); there is no vice so strong as to remove all of the created nature (De Civ. Dei, xix, xii [PL, x11, 639}). This does not, however, mean that the presence of the good nature is to be detected in good deeds. In the evil man, the good nature, diminished by sin, is apparent in pain and punishment. The good nature remains ‘ad poenam.’ “The above is a synthesis of Augustine’s Enarratio in Psalmum XXXV, vv. 7, 12 (PL, xxxvi, 348-849; 353-354). ‘Est enim hic quaedam poena occulta . . . Sicut cera, inquit [Psalmista] liquefacta auferentur. Dixi per concupiscentias suas hoc eis fieri . . . . Sed istas poenas pauci vident: propterea eas maxime commendat Spiritus Dei. Audi Apostolum dicentem: Tradidit illos Deus in concupiscentias cordis corum’ (PL, xxxvi, 686-687). \" The distinction between the punishment of concupiscence which is the common penalty of all sin and the punishment which is given as damnation may perhaps be indicated in terms of degree and permanence, According to Augustine, pride, the greatest of the sins, merits the greatest punishment —abandonment to concupiscence, which is damnation in this world and the next. However, as Augustine also maintains, pride is a vice from which few are free. The question then remains: At what point does pride incur this most severe of all punishments? Such a question is unanswerable, since no one knows the judgment of God. However, Bishop Bradwardine, in commenting on the two expositions of Augustine discussed above, makes it clear that a point does exist at which the sinner is permitted to go his way into further sins without the possibility of return: ‘Facit e[r]go Deus quosdam Peceare, sed in quibus iam talia peccata praecesserunt, ut iusto iudicio eius mereantur in desideriis ire’ (De Causa Dei, p. 297). \"See William Langland, Piers Plowman, C Passus XII, 173 ff. (ed. W. W. Skeat (Oxford, 1886}, 1, $11); Parson’s Tale, X{1)322-$49. There are also various allusions in Gower: ‘Mirour de l’Omme,’ 9124; ‘Confessio Amantis,’ vu, 5223; vi, 293; ‘Vox Clamantis,’ 11, 1911-1916 (Complete Works, td. G. C. Macaulay [Oxford, 1899-1902], 1, 106; 111, 380, 394; rv, 159). \"See above, n. 5. * Translated from the De Causa Dei, 1, xxxiv (p. 296). \"See Robinson’s note to VI (C) 608. The marginal gloss ‘Policratici libro I’ makes it likely that 4 478 Augustinian Interpretation of Chaucer’s Pardoner the material is from the Policraticus (see Text of the Canterbury Tales, ed. J. M. Manly and Edith Rickert [Chicago, 1940], m1, 516). On Lollius and the Policraticus, see R. A. Pratt, ‘A Note on Chau. cer’s Lollius,’ MLN, uxv (1950), 183-187. * Translated from the Policraticus, 11, iii: ‘Quod superbia radix malorum est, et concupiscentia lepra generalis, quae omnes inficit’ (ed. C. C. J. Webb [Oxford, 1909], 1, 176-177). 23 See Prologue to the Legend of Good Women (G 414-415). Chaucer seems to have made at least one distinct borrowing in The Pardoner’s Tale (see VI [C] 587 ff. and Robinson’s note). * Translated from the De Contemptu Mundi, 11, vi: De igne gehennali (P.L., ccxvu, 739). Latin text below, p. 475. According to Augustine, concupiscence remains as a punishment in the sinful dead (De Nat. et Gratia, 1, liii (PL, xu1v, 277) and is present in the fallen angels (Enchirid., 1, xxv (PL, XL, 244). Compare Innocent on the torment of the damned: ‘semper secum defert cruciatum’ and the Compendium Theologicae Veritatis on the torment of the fallen angels: ‘semper infernum suum secum portant’ (Alberti Magni Opera, xu, 34). %5 X (I) 387-955. The indebtedness to Gregory is apparent in at least two respects. First, the order of sins observed in The Parson’s Tale is that of Gregory and is hence almost exactly opposite to that of Peraldus’s, Summa de Vitiis, which has been generally considered the most acceptable parallel to the Parson’s sins treatise (see Germaine Dempster, The Parson’s Tale, in Sources and Analogues, (Chicago, 1941], pp. 728-724). Second, portions of the brief progress of Gregory were employed as prefatory material to the discussion of the individual sins. One may find the best example of this in Chaucer’s derivation of avarice from accidia. Chaucer: ‘After Accidie wol I speke of Avarice. .. . For soothly, whan the herte of a man is confounded in itself and troubled, and that the soule hath lost the confort of God, thanne seketh he an ydel solas of worldly thynges’ (X [I] 739-740). Gregory: ‘Tristitia quoque ad avaritiam derivatur, quia dum confusum cor bonum laetitiae in semetipso intus amiserit, unde consolari debeat foris quaerit; et tanto magis exteriora bona adipisci desiderat, quanto gaudium non habet ad quod intrinsecus recurrat’ (Moralium, xxx1, xiv [PL, txxvi, 621-622]). This derivation is not contained in Peraldus. In his very different rationale avarice follows luxury. % Translated from the Compendium Theologicae V eritatis, 11, vii: ‘De ef"
