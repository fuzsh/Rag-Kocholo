        "text": "Ingo Gerstl heats up to the unofficial lap record in the Automotodrom with over 200 km/h average speed. Salvatore De Plano was the fastest FORMULA pilot on his return to BOSS GP.\n\nSixth qualifying, sixth pole position: Ingo Gerstl (AUT, Top Speed) is on his way to the next championship title. The fact that he doesn’t slow down despite his dominance is proven by the qualifying best time of 1:35.155 min. Since the engagement of tyre supplier Pirelli the lap records have tumbled, but a possible new track record (1:36.065; Ingo Gerstl last year) only counts during the race.\n\nIn addition to Gerstl, Phil Stratford (USA, Penn Elcom Racing) will start the 20-minute first race from the front row this afternoon (starting time: 14:50 local time) in the 1997 Benetton. Wolfgang Jaksch (DEU, F Xtreme Racing) in the Super Aguri had to start in Q2 once again, but still managed a strong time despite traffic. In the race a duel for 2nd place with Stratford is quite possible.\n\nSalvatore De Plano (ITA, MM International) makes his racing comeback after a five-month break and has lost nothing of his speed. The fast Italian with a time of 1:45.751 is only three tenths behind the slowest OPEN car. Florian Schnitzenbaumer (DEU, Top Speed) is the leader of the FORMULA standings. Schnitzenbaumer qualified ahead of his fiercest competitor for the title Andreas Fiedler (DEU, Fiedler Racing). Bernd Herndlhofer (AUT, H&A Racing) is a former BOSS GP champion De Plano and the two Germans. A thrilling four-fold fight for the podium places in the FORMULA is to be expected for the races.\n\nThe two Speed Center drivers Christian Eicke and Peter Göllner will follow in positions 8 and 9. Local Veronika Cicha made it into the Top Ten. Nicolas Matile (MCO, ZIG-ZAG) finished behind her. Like his team mate Marc Faggionato (no time in qualifying due to clutch damage), he also participates in a BOSS GP weekend for the first time this year.\n\nThe fast and technically demanding track in the Czech Republic claimed its victims in qualifying, with Armando Mangini, Walter Steding, Nicolas Matile and others spinning. However, all drivers were able to continue the qualifying without damage.\n\nPictures: Michael Jurtin/BOSS GP\n\nRoy Glaser wins the FORMULA class with a dominant performance, win number 2 for the Suiss; Gerstl ahead of Stratford in the OPEN.\n\nIt was the weekend of the comebacks: Roy Glaser (SUI, Speed Center) was the fastest driver of the FORMULA class yesterday, but two spins prevented a top result. Today, however, Glaser did not give his competitors the slightest chance. The Swiss won his class superiorly, in the overall rankings he thus made it to rank 3.\n\nIn front of him classified the fastest pilots of the OPEN class. Ingo Gerstl (AUT, Top Speed) clinched season’s victory number 8, allowing the Salzburg-born racing driver to crown himself BOSS GP Champion 2018 at the penultimate race weekend in Brno (September 7-9).\n\nPhil Stratford (USA, Penn Elcom Racing) climbed on the podium for the seventh time this year, and for the seventh time in second place – for Stratford with his Benetton B197 it was the smoothest weekend of the whole year. In contrast to last year’s Assen winner Wolfgang Jaksch (DEU, F Xtreme Racing), who already had to retire his 2006 Super Aguri at the end of the race, a technical problem forced him off the track several times before.\n\nIn front of full stands with enthusiastic Dutch fans the duels in the midfield were especially worth seeing. Peter Göllner (SUI, Speed Center) was the big surprise of the weekend. The Swiss drove the best race weekend of his BOSS GP career, despite an accident in free practice. With second place in the FORMULA class he confirmed his performance of the previous day.\n\nFlorian Schnitzenbaumer (DEU, Top Speed), who had a tough race, also made it on to the podium today. After yesterday’s accident, he had to switch to a spare car in the second race. Without power steering and with the consequences of an operation, the German went to his physical limits – with rank 3 he extended his championship lead. One reason for this was the retirement of Andreas Fiedler (DEU, Fiedler Racing), who was in the second place when he was forced to stop the car due a technical failure.\n\nLooking ahead: Next, the BOSS GP will be the headliner of the Masaryk Racing Days at the beginning of September (7-9) in Brno, Czech Republic. The season finale will take place two weeks later in Spielberg (21-23 September), as part of the DTM weekend.\n\nQuotes after the race:\n\nNew track record holder and double winner Ingo Gerstl (AUT, Top Speed): “Of course, the record was great, now it counts. I was even faster in qualifying. The second race was smooth, but the 25 minutes of racing time are really long in a Formula 1 car.”\n\nFORMULA winner Roy Glaser (SUI, Speed Center): “Two race weekends, two wins – what more could you ask for? In the end, I drove without risk today. Unfortunately I can’t be at any more races this year because of my job.”\n\n3rd FORMULA Florian Schnitzenbaumer (DEU, Top Speed): “After the accident yesterday I had to change the car. Once you drive a car with power steering, you’ll never drive anything else. I was about to give up halfway through the race. In the end I had to slow down, I couldn’t hold it anymore.”\n\nPhotos: Michael Kavena/BOSS GP\n\nIngo Gerstl sets lap record and wins for the seventh time this season. Andreas Fiedler wins the FORMULA classification for the first time and makes up ground in the championship.\n\nGAMMA Racing Day attracted tens of thousands of spectators to the beautiful race track in Assen on the first day of racing. The highlight for many of them have been the races of the BOSS GP for years. So probably also this year, because the grandstands were well filled just in time for the first race at 4:30 pm – with light wind and cloudy sky (22 degrees outside temperature).\n\nIt had already been promised in qualifying, and Ingo Gerstl (Top Speed) made it official in the race: The Austrian not only won the race and the OPEN class for the seventh time this season, but also set a new lap record at the TT Circuit Assen with 1:18,298 min. After Gerstl had already driven the fastest lap ever in qualifying (1:17,157), the record only became official in the race. Gerstl’s old record was 1:19,371 from 2016.\n\nPhil Stratford (Penn Elcom Racing) finished second behind Ingo Gerstl. The US-American complained about wearing down tyres on his Benetton B197, but was never pressed by the pursuers – all in all a problem-free race.\n\nUnlike Wolfgang Jaksch (F Xtreme Racing), who had his hands full throughout the race. With Andreas Fiedler, Wolfgang Jaksch and partner Veronika Cicha as well as Peter Göllner and towards the end of the race Roy Glaser formed an exciting fighting group. Jaksch was not only involved in all kinds of action, but also drifted in Fast and Furious style in the Super Aguri in the first lap to stay on track. Despite all the chaos, he became third overall.\n\nEven before the start of the race there was an accident: Florian Schnitzenbaumer (Top Speed) spun so hard into the barriers during the tyre warm-up that the broken car had to be lifted. The German could leave the car on his own, but lost valuable points in the championship. In return Andreas Fiedler (Fiedler Racing) made a considerable leap forward. After the injury-related non start at Hockenheim in July, he won the FORMULA class at the comeback. Now he is only 14 points behind Schnitzenbaumer.\n\nVeronika Cicha (H&A Racing) climbed the podium with Fiedler. The Czech was on the podium for the first time this year. A flawless race enabled her, as did Peter Göllner (Speed Center), to take a champagne shower. Göllner started after a practice accident in the spare car, and had to get used to the circumstances.\n\nThe fastest lap of the FORMULA drivers went to Roy Glaser (Speed Center), but the Swiss pole setter can’t buy anything for that. Glaser spun at the restart of the race, and was left behind by the rest of the field. After a furious chase to catch up, Glaser exaggerated his attempt to attack third-placed Jaksch. A shame: A spin ended his race shortly before the end.\n\nChristian Eicke (Speed Center) started from the pits, he became inconspicuous seventh. Walter Steding (Inter Europol Competition), who couldn’t get away at the restart, should also be unhappy. He also chased the field with a delay. Too bad, because the German had shown a good pace so far this weekend.\n\nTomorrow’s second race starts at 16:06 CET +1 and a live stream is available at www.podium.tv\n\nQuotes after the race:\n\nFORMULA winner Andreas Fiedler (DEU, Fiedler Racing): “My mechanic said I should slow down at the beginning and only push at the end – but that didn’t work out like this anymore. I was almost certain that Roy would make another mistake, he was eager to get Jaksch. I just didn’t want to make a mistake, take the points home. I had the championship in mind the whole time.”\n\n2nd OPEN Phil Stratford (USA, Penn Elcom Racing): “The race was difficult because the track is so demanding. I’ve never been here before, six laps in practice and then right into qualifying. I’m certainly not at the limit yet.”\n\n2nd FORMULA Peter Göllner (SUI, Speed Center): “A sensation! This podium was expensive to buy after the accident in the morning.”\n\nPhotos: Michael Kavena/BOSS GP\n\nIngo Gerstl broke the lap record at the TT Circuit in Assen on the first day with a 1:17.157 min under optimal conditions. Stratford in the Benetton in row 1, Glaser and Schnitzenbaumer start from row 2.\n\nThe Austrian Ingo Gerstl (Top Speed) was the first to qualify. Right at the beginning Gerstl used the free track in his Toro Rosso STR1, already in the second lap he managed a 1:17.2 min, shortly afterwards he improved the best time again to 1:17.157. In the following laps he improved in sector 3, but it was not enough for another record time. Nevertheless he set the fastest lap ever driven in Assen – an official lap record (currently: 1:19.371 by Gerstl in 2016) is only valid in the race.\n\nPhil Stratford (Penn Elcom Racing) will start the races (starting time 1st race: today at 16:30 GMT +1) next to Gerstl. The American in the 1997-Benetton had to go into Q2 and was long on rank 3, late (in his 9th lap) he could improve to rank 2. Roy Glaser (Speed Center) held this position until shortly before the end. The FORMULA winner from Hockenheim started in Q1 and improved lap by lap. Finally, Florian Schnitzenbaumer, leader of the FORMULA standings, had nothing against the Swiss. In the end, the Top Speed driver was a second behind Glaser. Thus the two fastest FORMULA drivers were ahead of Wolfgang Jaksch (F Xtreme Racing). However, last year’s winner in the Super Aguri SA06 is a hot tip for the race.\n\nAndreas Fiedler (Fiedler Racing) achieved a respectable result on his return to BOSS GP: The German had injured himself in a crash in Monza, and is making his comeback this weekend in Assen – he starts from 6th place.\n\nWalter Steding (Inter Europol Competition) proved to be really quick this weekend. In the meantime, Steding was even placed 5th. During the session he had to park his Dallara-GP2, so he dropped back to 7th place towards the end.\n\nPeter Göllner and Christian Eicke (both Speed Center) were on the track for a while in a row. The Swiss Göllner had an accident in free practice. The car spun and the GP2 Dallara hit the tyre stacks with its tail. The Speed Center crew managed to set up the spare car in the shortest possible time and get it ready for the following qualifying session. Göllner thanked them and finished eighth. The Speed Center duo blasted Veronika Cicha, who achieved her best qualifying result of the year with 9th place.\n\nFlat curbs and a wide track promise a lot of overtaking possibilities for the afternoon. According to current weather forecasts, it should remain dry despite overcast.\n\nFree, but not for nothing: at GAMMA Racing Day Formula 1-star Carlos Sainz Jr., superbike ace Michael van der Mark and the BOSS GP meet – with free admission for race fans.\n\nFor several years now, GAMMA Racing Day has been attracting Dutch motorsport fans: every summer, the event at the TT Circuit in Assen offers a monster programme that is absolute unique. The mix of kart, motorcycle, touring cars and formula cars is nowhere else to be found. It is therefore hardly surprising that up to 100,000 fans make a visit to the north-east of the Netherlands.\n\nAssen, a motorcycle circuit\n\nThe first Dutch Tourist Trophy (TT) for motorcycles took place in 1925, but still on public roads. It was not until 1955 that a race track was built specifically for this purpose, parts of the track however, were still open to public transport. The 7.7 km long track was completely renovated in 1984 and shortened to 6.1 km. In 1992 the current TT Circuit Assen was permanently separated from public transport for the first time. In 2006 there was another change to the layout: The track was shortened to 4.5 kilometres, and safety was significantly improved.\n\nAssen is the only track worldwide where a Motorcycle World Championship race has been held every year since 1949. But Assen is also on the map when it comes to automotive sports: In the past, for example, the ChampCar World Series and the A1 GP started on the TT Circuit. The BOSS GP has also been back in Assen regularly since 2015, providing a mega show year after year. Record winner is the Austrian Ingo Gerstl (Top Speed), who won five out of the last six races.\n\nGAMMA Racing Day: Event of superlatives\n\nFor three days, a densely packed programme thrills viewers on location and live on Dutch television. Admission is free, access to the paddock is limited and costs 15 euros per day or 25 euros for all three racing days. Tickets can either be purchased on site at the ticket offices or online in advance.\n\nDue to the tightly packed program, the BOSS GP only runs one free practice session. Both Saturday and Sunday there will be a race of the Big Open Single Seaters. The race cars and teams of the BOSS GP are located in the pit building, from Pit 11 to 20.\n\nOther series in the line-up: Supercar Challenge, TCR Europe, Ford Fiesta Cup, historic sports and touring cars, FIA Superkart EC, FIM Sidecar World Championship, Yamaha R3 Cup.\n\nPlus: Formula 1 demo laps by Carlos Sainz Jr. in the Renault, superbike demo laps by Michael van der Mark on the Yamaha, Formula 1 two-seater and much more.\n\nTimetable: BOSS GP at GAMMA Racing Day\n\nSaturday, August 18, 2018\n\n10:08–10:38: Free Practice\n\n13:12–13:42: Qualifying\n\n16:30–16:50: Race 1 (distance: 20 minutes)\n\nSunday, August 19, 2018\n\n16:06–16:31: Race 2 (distance: 25 minutes)\n\nParticipants: BOSS GP\n\nThe OPEN class is for type Formula 1 car built from 1997, Champ Car and IndyCar built from 1997.

Two safety car phases and the beginning of rain made the race the most exciting of the year.\n\nFor the 17 drivers and 2 pilots of the BOSS GP it was the race of their lives: In front of almost 30,000 spectators, Europe’s fastest racing series started for the second time this year at the Hockenheimring, but for the first time ever as support of the Formula 1 World Championship.\n\nThe start was already turbulent: Ingo Gerstl (Top Speed) in his Toro Rosso started from pole position, Phil Stratford (Benetton; Penn Elcom Racing) and Bernd Herndlhofer (Top Speed) were behind him at the flying start. The Swiss Roy Glaser (Speed Center) had a quick start and shot forward to third place in the first corner. However, he also benefited from the collision of team-mates Luca Martucci and Armando Mangini (MM International). Martucci lost the front wing of his GP2 Dallara.\n\nBut that’s not all with the action: Glaser made a 360-degree turn through his own fault, but continued immediately. Also Bianca Steiner (Top Speed) was involved in the action zone in turn 1, she had to avoid the flying front wing of Martucci over the asphalted run-out area.\n\nWolfgang Jaksch (F Xtreme Racing; started from position 8) and Florian Schnitzenbaumer (Top Speed; started from position 11) did as expected and were the biggest mover during the first part of the race. Surprisingly, Martucci did not enter the pits, instead he tried to continue without his front wing. Without much grip on the front axle the lap times dropped by five seconds. But Martucci was brave, behind him a slow train with at times five cars formed. First Jaksch passed the wounded Dallara of Martucci, then Schnitzenbaumer, who overtook three cars in only one and a half laps. Martucci finished surprisingly seventh, ahead of his opponent Armando Mangini (8th).\n\nThe first safety car phase brought disorder on the first places: The SC was triggered by a collision of Hans Laub (Speed Center) in the Forti with Bianca Steiner (Top Speed) in the Dallara GP2. The manoeuvre against Steiner went wrong, the gap was too small. Laub’s Forti rushed over the curbs on the inside and than into Steiner’s car – both did not finish.\n\nThe safety car brought the first pilots together again. When the track was cleared again, Roy Glaser reacted the fastest. The Swiss was at the start of a BOSS GP race for the first time this year. With his manoeuvre he surprised Stratford and Herndlhofer in front of him and overtook them, so he had made up to the first place in the FORMULA classification. Herndlhofer just overtook\n\nUnimpressed by the events, Ingo Gerstl clinched his sixth victory of the season. When it started raining, the race was stopped due to the conditions. One of the victims of the rain was Wolfgang Jordan, who spun in the hairpin bend. Behind Gerstl, Phil Stratford and Wolfgang Jaksch landed in the OPEN class. Behind Glaser the Top Speed drivers Bernd Herndlhofer and Florian Schnitzenbaumer completed the FORMULA podium.\n\nWalter Steding (Inter Europol Competition) finished in a good ninth place despite a spin in the reconnaissance lap. Karl-Heinz Becker, the oldest participant in the field, was probably just as happy about 10th place. Christian Eicke (Speed Center) finished eleventh ahead of Thomas Jakoubek (Top Speed), who only travelled to the Hockenheimring this afternoon.\n\nRace 2 starts tomorrow Sunday at 11:10 am and goes over the longer distance of 25 minutes. Starting grid is the same as for race 1.\n\nPhotos: Daniel Glaser/BOSS GP\n\nIngo Gerstl had an almost perfect qualifying session to mark the highlight of the BOSS GP year. Bernd Herndlhofer starts as best of the FORMULA class.\n\nWith an outside temperature of 20 degrees and a track temperature of 25 degrees, the eyes were initially directed towards the sky. It started raining again and again in the morning, but for the qualifying of the BOSS GP it remained dry to the delight of most drivers – the Pirelli rain tyres could thus remain on the wheel wagons.\n\nDefending champion Ingo Gerstl (Top Speed) will lead the field into the first of two races at the flying start this evening. With 1:20.939 min he missed the 1:20 mark, but none of Gerstl’s opponents could displace the Toro Rosso STR 1 from first place. Phil Stratford (Penn Elcom Racing) starts from position 2 on the grid. Stratford once locked brakes into the Sachs corner and the Benetton then rolled through the gravel. However, he managed to get back onto the tarmac.\n\nJohann Ledermair, who jumped in yesterday at last minute, has decided not to start today after finishing first in free practice yesterday. Regular driver Thomas Jakoubek will start for Top Speed this afternoon. Bernd Herndlhofer (Top Speed) therefore had one less opponent, with 1:29.382 he was the fastest GP2 driver in his class.\n\nThe closest to the Austrian was Monza winner Armando Mangini. The Italian was at the start in Q2, and thus had more time at his side, which the old fox also used until the last second. The experienced pilot and team owner increased steadily, and set the second fastest time in the FORMULA classification with 1:30.0 at the end of the 18 minutes, he starts the 20-minute race at 6.00 pm from second row.\n\nLuca Martucci (MM International) followed his team mate Mangini on his fastest laps around the track. He started from grid position 5, and together with the fastest lady Bianca Steiner from row 3. Steiner could also increase from medium 1:30 laps to 1:30.783, with that she was in the end only 6 hundredths behind Martucci. All drivers in the longer Q2 benefited from an uninterrupted session.\n\nRoy Glaser (Speed Center) in the black-neon-yellow car was also quickly on the way, with rank 7 the Swiss Speed Center pilot is certainly satisfied. The Swiss could be aiming for the podium in the races.\n\nWolfgang Jaksch (F Xtreme Racing) was allowed to compete in Q1 due to the withdrawal of Ledermair, but with rank 8 he is not where the German could stand. It was certainly unpleasant for Jaksch that his radio cable detached itself from the helmet during the session. His girlfriend Veronika Cichá was also angry: the Czech lost a wheel hub in her outlap and had to give up early.\n\nFlorian Schnitzenbaumer (Top Speed) will not be satisfied either: The leader of the FORMULA standings only starts from 11th overall, but could not use the few laps in Q1 as he had hoped.\n\nChristian Eicke and Peter Göllner (both Speed Centers) put their cars in the top 10, which is quite a surprise.\n\nKarl-Heinz Becker (Becker Motorsport) and Gianluca Ripoli (MM International) did a pirouette in the hairpin bend almost simultaneously, but both were able to continue immediately. Becker and his accident opponent from yesterday Walter Steding were on a time chase for a long time in parallel flight – Becker finished 13th behind Wolfgang Jordan, Steding 15th.\n\nRace 1 of 2 on this fourth race weekend of the BOSS GP year starts at 18:00.\n\nPhoto: Daniel Glaser\n\nEurope’s fastest racing series is part of the German Grand Prix weekend and for the first time support series of Formula 1.\n\nThe big stage\n\nFor the second time this season the Big Open Single Seater will come to Hockenheim. Like the season opener three months ago, the 20 players of the BOSS GP are bringing powerful sounds and high speed to the Motodrom. The 4.5-kilometer Grand Prix circuit will be the stage for a premiere: for the first time, the BOSS GP will drive as a support series for the Formula 1 World Championship.\n\nThe Protagonists\n\n20 cars divided into two classes – that is the setting for the BOSS GP premiere at Hockenheim. In the OPEN class Formula 1 and IndyCars are allowed, the engines are unrestricted. Four brave starters of the highest class compete in the magic Motodrom: The triple BOSS GP Champion Ingo Gerstl (Top Speed) from Austria with the very first Toro Rosso Formula 1 car; the American Phil Stratford (Penn Elcom Racing) in 1997-Benetton by Jean Alesi (team mate Gerhard Berger won the 1997 German Grand Prix in the identical car); Hans Laub (Speed Center) in the Forti FG 03, a rare piece of racing history; Wolfgang Jaksch (F Xtreme Racing) in the white and red Super Aguri from 2006, with 10 cylinders and 800 hp Cosworth power.\n\nStarting No.\n\nName Team Nat. Car 1 Ingo Gerstl Top Speed AUT Toro Rosso STR1 7 Phil Stratford Penn Elcom Racing USA Benetton B197 22 Hans Laub Speed Center DEU Forti FG 03 26 Wolfgang Jaksch F Xtreme Racing Team DEU Super Aguri 06\n\nFast identes Material haben die 16 Akteure der FORMULA zur Verfügung: 14 der 16 Teilnehmer starten mit Dallara-GP2-Rennfahrzeugen, allerdings mit unterschiedlichen Aerodynamik-Ausbaustufen. Der Franzose „Piter“ und der deutsche BOSS GP-Dauerbrenner Karl-Heinz Becker starten in Boliden der World Series by Nissan bzw. Renault. Die heißesten Kandidaten auf die Siege am Wochenende sind Tabellenführer Florian Schnitzenbaumer (Top Speed) aus Deutschland und Armando Mangini (MM International) aus Italien, der das letzte Rennen in Monza gewinnen konnte. Nicht außer Acht lassen dürfen wir Bernd Herndlhofer (Top Speed), der Ex-Meister startet zum ersten Mal in diesem Jahr in der FORMULA. Nach einem Rennen Pause ist Bianca Steiner (Top Speed) zurück: Die junge Österreicherin holte zuletzt am Red Bull Ring ihr erstes Podest. Sie ist übrigens nicht die einzige Dame im Starterfeld, Veronica Cicha (H&A Racing) ist schon länger fester Bestandteil der BOSS GP.\n\nStarting No. Name Team Nat.

Most recently in Monza, however, Phil Stratford in the Benetton F1 was the first to take Gerstl’s pace in the Toro Rosso F1, although Gerstl also clinched overall and class victory for the fifth time in six races up to now. In the second Monza race, both Gerstl and Stratford fell victim to a starting collision. The beneficiary of this unfortunate situation was Wolfgang Jaksch (Super Aguri F1). The German won in Monza for the first time this season, for the second time ever in the BOSS GP – right on time before his home race at Hockenheim. Hans Laub has only been on the track for testing purposes with his Forti F1 so far, and the German’s first race will take place this weekend.\n\nThe FORMULA is tighter and only slightly more silent. Four different winners in six races so far this season prove that this class is closer than ever before. In the overall standings after 6 of 14 races Schnitzenbaumer (120 points) leads ahead of Fiedler (101) and Mangini (87).\n\nTimetable: BOSS GP at Grosser Preis von Deutschland\n\nFriday, 20 July 2018\n\n13:00–13:25: Free Practice 1\n\n18:30–18:55: Free Practice 2\n\nSaturday, 21 July 2018\n\n10:40–11:10: Qualifying\n\n18:00–18:25: Race 1\n\nSunday, 22.
