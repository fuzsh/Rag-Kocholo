        "text": "The fourth race weekend from 21 to 23 July 2023 in Misano marks the mid-season for the Big Open Single Seater Racing Series, Europe’s fastest racing series.\n\nWith the BOSS GP Racing Series, the most powerful single-seater cars of the last 25 years will be guests at the World Circuit Marco Simoncelli this weekend – meaning that spectators on site will experience the fastest starting grid of the year. The Misano circuit has already celebrated its 50th anniversary. The 4.2-kilometre track has been rebuilt several times, including a change of direction in 2006. 16 corners demand a lot of patience on the throttle and precision from the pilots. Only a few kilometres from the Adriatic coast, the “Holiday Grand Prix” is a good opportunity for the participants of the BOSS GP to spend their holidays by the sea.\n\nEntries\n\nAntonio Pizzonia (BRA) is the favourite in the BOSS GP OPEN class. With the World Series V8 of the HS Engineering team, he has won all the races so far this season. The former Formula 1 driver will try to break the track record set last year by Harald Schlegelmilch (1:20.785 min). Schlegelmilch (LVA, HS Engineering) himself will make his BOSS GP comeback in Misano, but in the FORMULA Class. Last year’s OPEN Class champion will be driving a World Series by Renault 3.5.\n\nFor many years now, the Italian teams and drivers have been a fundamental reason for the success of the BOSS GP Racing Series. No fewer than eight Italians will be competing in Misano this time. Championship leader Simone Colombo (MM International), his rival Marco Ghiotto (Scuderia Palladio) and Ghiotto’s team-mate “Checco” Malavasi in the FORMULA class. Also competing for Ghiotto’s team is Bruno Jarach. Another Italian, Marco Minelli (AM Sport System), who recently made his debut in Spielberg, joins them in a World Series Dallara. New in Misano is Alessandro Rosi (Gruppo Piloti Forlivesi), who, like compatriot Minelli, will be driving a World Series car. They will all face Fabian Vettel (GER, Top Speed), who made a strong monoposto debut at the Red Bull Ring and will participate in the rest of the season in the BOSS GP. After the first podium, an attack for the win could possibly happen soon. For the first time this year, Nicolas Matile (MCO, Zig-Zag) will be on the grid, bringing one of the spectacular Auto GP cars with a loud 3.4-litre Zytek engine, as will team-mate Jean-Christophe Peyre (FRA). In addition to Simone Colombo, Marc Faggionato (MCO) is another contender for victory in the car for the Tuscan MM International team. In addition, Adriano Buzaid, a former top driver from the British Formula 3, will make his debut. The Brazilian will also compete in a GP2 car.\n\nIn the SUPER LIGHTS class, where primarily the 6-cylinder cars find their stage, Walter Colacino and Giulio Tine (both ITA) share a 1998 Formula 3000 with an Alfa Romeo engine. They will compete against Henry Clausnitzer, who exhibited with consistency in his debut season and continues on his way towards the title.\n\nThe BOSS GP F1 Class will not compete in Misano because the track is not approved for Formula 1 cars. Interested Formula 1 teams and drivers therefore have the opportunity to take part in two show runs this year in Brno (9/10 September) and Magny-Cours (30 September/1 October). These events are also the perfect opportunity to get a taste of BOSS GP. Send your enquiry to race@bossgp.com\n\nTimetable\n\nFriday, 21 July\n\n10:35–11:05 Free Practice 1\n\n16:35–16:50 Free Practice 2\n\nSaturday, 22 July\n\n09:35–10:05 Qualifying (two groups)\n\n15:00–15:20 Race 1 (20 minutes)\n\nSunday, 23. July\n\n12:15–11:40 Race 2 (25 minutes)\n\nall times CEST\n\nTickets\n\nAdmission on site is free of charge, paddock entry for visitors is possible.\n\nSupport programme\n\nThe PNK Motorsport Racing Weekend is the successor to the Gruppo Peroni events, which often hosted the Italian races of the BOSS GP in previous years. This year, the summer event in Misano will once again feature a variety of racing series. These include races with sports prototypes (Master Tricolore Prototipi and Sports Car Challenge), silhouette cars (Mitjet Racing Series), cup touring cars (RS Cup) and various historic classes (Histo Cup Austria).\n\nPhotos: Angelo Poletto/BOSS GP\n\nThe Red Bull Ring Classics from 9 to 11 June 2023 will celebrate its premiere in Spielberg. Joining them at Austria’s Formula 1 circuit is Europe’s fastest racing series,\n\nFans can expect a unique mix of Formula 1, Formula 2 and GP2, World Series and Formula 3000 cars. For the first time Sebastian Vettel’s younger brother Fabian will compete in the BOSS GP Racing Series next weekend. With him on the grid: ex-Formula 1 driver Antonio Pizzonia and thousands of horsepower.\n\nEntries\n\nFirst and foremost, Salzburg’s record champion Ingo Gerstl (AUT, Top Speed) will compete in the BOSS GP F1 Class. With his Toro Rosso STR1, he not only holds various track records, but has also conquered the hearts of numerous fans with the V10 Cosworth engine. Gerhard Berger’s Benetton from 1997, today driven by Ulf Ehninger (GER, ESBA Racing) in its original livery, also brings back nostalgic memories.\n\nModified cars that no longer comply with the original regulations of their racing series compete in the OPEN class. The best-known representative in this illustrious field is former Formula 1 driver Antonio Pizzonia. The Brazilian competed for BMW Williams on this circuit in 2003, this year once again he is chasing F1 cars in the field with a World Series V8 bolide with a big 4.5-litre Gibson engine. Team-mate Paul O’Connell from Ireland will start with a World Series car powered by a 3.3-litre Cosworth engine and will be able to fight among the GP2 cars. Both mentioned race cars are entered by HS Engineering.\n\nThe field of Formula 2, GP2 and World Series 3.5 cars features several highlights. 24-year-old Fabian Vettel (GER), who recently competed in the ADAC GT Masters, among others, is driving in the BOSS GP Racing Series for the first time. With a GP2 car from the Austrian Top Speed team, the driver from Heppenheim could cause a sensation in FORMULA class right from the start. Simone Colombo (ITA, MM International) comes to Spielberg as the overall leader. After three wins in four races this season, he has already pulled a few points clear of his toughest rival Marco Ghiotto (ITA, Scuderia Palladio). Other contenders for the top positions include Thomas Jackermeier (GER, Top Speed) in the Fanatec GP2, “Checco” Malavasi (ITA, Scuderia Palladio) and Andreas Fiedler (GER, Fiedler Racing). The debut of Alexander Geier (AUT, Geier Racing) from Salzburg in the GP2 car will be interesting. Last year, the young man from Salzburg made a big impression in the SUPER LIGHTS category. With the experienced hillclimb driver and organiser of the Rechbergrennen, Christian Ferstl (AUT), a Styrian local hero will also be competing in this class with a GP2 Dallara.\n\nThe 21-strong field is completed by the Formula 3000 of Walter Colacino (shared with Sebastiano Sibani; both ITA) and the V6 World Series of Henry Clausnitzer (GER, WF Racing) as well as Stefan Eisinger-Sewald’s (AUT, Red Rose Racing) Ralt-F3000 in the SUPER LIGHTS class.\n\nTimetable\n\nFriday, 9 June\n\n14:10–14:35 Free Practice 1\n\n16:35–17:00 Free Practice 2\n\nSaturday, 10 June\n\n09:10–09:40 Qualifying (separated in two groups)\n\n15:50–16:10 Race 1 (20 minutes/F1 Class 15 minutes)\n\nSunday, 11 June\n\n10:40–11:05 Race 2 (25 minutes/F1 Class 15 minutes)\n\nall times CEST\n\nTickets\n\nDay tickets for Saturday and Sunday cost 28 Euro each in advance booking (www.redbullring.com), the weekend ticket is available for 42 Euro – paddock and pit lane walk are included.\n\nSupport events\n\nIn addition to BOSS GP, nine other racing series will ignite fireworks of historic motorsport. Spectacular racing cars from all over the world will be on display. Further highlights are the Group C Supercup, the CanAm & Sportscars, the Super Sixties and the touring cars from the Golden Era of DRM, DTM and STW.\n\nPhotos: Angelo Poletto/BOSS GP, Vettel\n\nThe final decision will be made on the last race meeting of the year: the Pirelli Grande Finale in Misano from 4 to 6 November 2022.\n\nUpdated Entry List on 3/11/2022, 10:35 CET\n\nIngo Gerstl (BOSS GP F1 Class), Harald Schlegelmilch (OPEN) and Andreas Hasler (SUPER LIGHTS) have already been crowned the new champions of 2022 ahead of the Pirelli Grande Finale. The situation is completely different in the FORMULA class, where two drivers can still become champions after two dramatic races in Mugello. On the one hand, defending champion Marco Ghiotto (ITA, Scuderia Palladio). After two titles in a row, compatriot Simone Colombo (ITA, MM International) could break his winning streak this year. Colombo leads by 38 points after ten of the season’s twelve races and has two more victories than Ghiotto under his belt. With a maximum of 50 points up for grabs, Ghiotto will be going all out to repeat his victory double from last year at Misano in his 2011 GP2 car. Colombo (2017 GP2 car), on the other hand, has known since the second race at Mugello at the latest how quickly a race can end in the gravel bed. How much risk will he take this time?\n\nWith Luca Martucci (ITA, MM International), another Italian wants to finish his season in the best possible way. In the championship, he could still move up to third place. Whether the track record of 1:24.761, set by Marco Ghiotto in qualifying 2021, will fall this year is unclear. The weather forecast promises a high chance of rain for all three days of the event. Unfortunately, due to stricter noise regulations, the Formula 1 cars are missing on the BOSS GP Racing Series grid this time. The favourite for the overall victory is expected to be Harald Schlegelmilch (LVA, HS Engineering) in his 4.5-litre World Series car.\n\nEntry List:\n\nTrack:\n\nThe BOSS GP Racing Series makes its second stop at the 4.2-kilometre Misano World Circuit Marco Simoncelli this year after last year’s premiere. The track has been in operation near the Adriatic coast since 1972, with the biggest reconstruction taking place in 2006 and 2007, when the direction of the track was rotated (now clockwise) to create more space for run-off areas. Today, like all the other tracks on the BOSS GP Racing Series calendar, the circuit has the highest safety standard and regularly hosts MotoGP, World Superbike Championship and the Fanatec GT World Challenge.\n\nTimetable (CET):\n\nFriday, 4 November 2022\n\n10:35–11:05 Free Practice 1\n\n14:35–15:05 Free Practice 2\n\nSaturday, 5 November 2022\n\n10:00–10:30 Qualifying\n\n14:35–14:55 Race 1 (20 minutes)\n\nSunday, 6 November 2022\n\n11:05–11:30 Race 2 (25 minutes)\n\nSupport races:\n\nLike last time in Mugello, several Italian racing series will support the BOSS GP Racing Series in Misano. These include the Master Tricolore Prototipi sports car prototype series, the Lotus and Renault Clio RS one-make championships and the Mitjet Italia Racing Series silhouette championship. The line-up will be rounded off by regularity races of the Porsche Club GT. Saturday’s programme starts at 8:45 a.m. and goes until 9:20 p.m. with floodlights. Sunday starts at 8:30 a.m.\n\nLive Stream:\n\nThe race programme on Saturday and Sunday will be partly broadcast on promoter Gruppo Peroni’s YouTube channel.\n\nPhotos: Angelo Poletto/BOSS GP, PR & Event Keke Platzer (Poster)\n\nThe Italian “double” to close the 2022 BOSS GP season starts next weekend with two races in Tuscany.\n\nBefore the 28th season of Europe’s fastest racing series enters its finale in Misano (4-6 November), it is time for Mugello, one of the favourite tracks of many drivers. While last year’s championship started at Mugello, this year’s Forza Fanatec at Mugello is already entering the crucial stage. In the BOSS GP FORMULA Class, six drivers (all of them in GP2 cars) still have a mathematical chance of becoming the champion.\n\nSimone Colombo (ITA, MM International), who made his BOSS GP debut at Mugello in 2021, has the best chance of winning the title at the moment. He leads by 33 points over defending champion Marco Ghiotto (ITA, Scurderia Palladio) and the Portuguese Zdenek Chovenec-Lopez (MM International). As in Brno, however, Chovanec-Lopez will not be competing. Luca Martucci (ITA, MM International), Walter Steding (GER, Scuderia Palladio) and Giancarlo Pedetti (ITA, Nannini Racing) still have outside chances. Francesco Malavasi (ITA, Scuderia Palladio), who has only been participating in the championship since Le Castellet in the summer, was on the podium twice in Brno and should also be considered for a possible podium in Mugello. With Marc Faggionato (MCO, Zig-Zag) and Salvatore de Plano (ITA, MM International), two former race winners return to the grid, which this time also includes a former professional racing driver: Joey Foster (GBR, HS Engineering) will give his comeback in monoposto racing. A total of 17 drivers have entered for the FORMULA classification, including the French team from Zig-Zag and two Lola AutoGP cars.\n\nTwo drivers from Team Top Speed, Ingo Gerstl (AUT) and Thomas Jackermeier (GER), will be competing in the BOSS GP F1 Class. They continue their Toro Rosso duel between Gerstl’s STR1 and Jackermeier’s STR3. Harald Schlegelmilch (LVA, HS Engineering) from the OPEN class will again try to chase the Formula 1 cars in his modified World Series bolide. In the six-cylinder car class, Andreas Hasler (AUT, Hasler Motorsport) will try to keep his increasingly fast pursuer in the overall SUPER LIGHTS standings, Alexander Geier (AUT, Geier Racing), at bay. All the best ingredients for an exciting race weekend in Mugello.\n\nEntry List:\n\nTrack:\n\nThe 5.245-kilometre Mugello circuit (built in 1974) is owned by Ferrari and traditionally hosts the MotoGP. Two years ago, the track in Tuscany also hosted a Formula 1 race (winner: Lewis Hamilton). The youngsters and gentlemen of the BOSS GP Racing Series can expect fluid and fast sequences of corners embedded in a hilly topography. Last year in partly wet conditions Marco Ghiotto took a double victory in the FORMULA class, in the OPEN classification Ulf Ehninger (GER, ESBA Racing) won race 1 in a Benetton, in race 2 Ingo Gerstl in a Toro Rosso.\n\nTimetable (CEST):\n\nFriday, 14 October 2022\n\n11:10–11:40 Free Practice 1\n\n14:05–14:35 Free Practice 2\n\nSaturday, 15 October 2022\n\n09:55–10:25 Qualifying\n\n15:05–15:25 Race 1 (20 minutes)\n\nSonntag, 16 October 2022\n\n10:00–10:10 Warm-up\n\n13:15–13:40 Race 2 (25 minutes)\n\nSupport races:\n\nThe Italian promoter Gruppo Peroni is again gathering numerous racing series from different categories in Mugello this year. In addition to the BOSS GP Racing Series as the main series, the Italian Topjet F2000 Trophy (together with the Drexler Formula Cup from Austria) is another single-seater racing series at the event. The Master Tricolore Prototipi features sports prototypes, the Lotus (Cup Italia) and Renault (Clio RS Cup) one-make cups and the historic GT cars of the Campionato Italiano Autostoriche will complete the line-up. The programme starts on Friday from 8:45 am (without lunch break) with practice and qualifying sessions. On Saturday and Sunday, the programme will start with the races from 9 a.m. each day.\n\nTickets:\n\nAdmission to the standing areas is free, the pit roof and main stand cost 10 respectively 15 euros at the box office. Discounts are available for under-18s, women and ACI club members. Children under 14 can enter for free when accompanied by an adult, and the same applies to residents of the municipalities of Scarperia and San Piero (FI).\n\nLive Stream:\n\nThe race programme on Saturday and Sunday will be partially broadcast on promoter Gruppo Peroni’s YouTube channel.\n\nPhotos: Michael Jurtin/BOSS GP, PR & Event Keke Platzer (Poster)\n\nNext weekend (September 9–11) Europe’s fastest racing series, the BOSS GP Racing Series, returns from its summer break. Hosted by the Masaryk Racing Days at the Automotodrom in Brno.\n\nThe weekend of 9–11 September marks the start of the second half of the season for the BOSS GP Racing Series. After six races in Hockenheim, Spielberg and Le Castellet, six more races are scheduled in the next nine weeks in Brno, Mugello and Misano. Before the season ends in Italy, the unique mix of Big Open single-seaters in the Formula 1, Formula 2, World Series & Co. categories will head to Brno.\n\nIn the BOSS GP F1 Class, that is the classification for Formula 1 cars, four cars have been entered. Among them are three Toro Rossos, including the STR1 of championship leader Ingo Gerstl (AUT, Top Speed), who has won all races so far this season. In Sebastien Vettel’s premiere winning car, the Toro Rosso STR3 with a Ferrari engine, Thomas Jackermeier (GER, Top Speed) wants to break this streak in Brno. Racing fans can especially look forward to a rare piece of motorsport history in the form of the green and yellow Lotus T127. The Formula 1 car from 2010 is equipped with a Cosworth V8 engine and will be entered by Team Top Speed. The ex-car of Jarno Trulli and Heikki Kovalainen is driven by Austrian Thomas Jakoubek.\n\nIn the absence of championship leader Zdenek Chovanec Lopez (PRT), FORMULA title defender Marco Ghiotto (ITA, Scuderia Palladio) is aiming for his first win of the season. In the battle for the championship, however, Ghiotto’s compatriot Simone Colombo (MM International) could put himself in the best starting position. After three events, he is only twelve points behind Chovanec-Lopez, but already 35 ahead of Marco Ghiotto. Salvatore de Plano (ITA, MM International), who has won races with a GP2 in the past, has also been named. After a longer break from racing, he also wants to have a say in the fight for the podium.\n\nIn the BOSS GP SUPER LIGHTS, Alexander Geier (Geier Racing) in an older 2003 Tatuus-Renault and Andreas Hasler (Hasler Motorsport) will continue their inner-Austrian duel in the six-cylinder car class.\n\nEntry list:\n\nRace track:\n\nWith a track length of 5.403 kilometres, the former MotoGP circuit is also the second longest circuit of the year after Circuit Paul Ricard (5.8 km long). Fast and fluid corners alternate with a technically demanding section. Engine power is also a decisive factor because the Czech rollercoaster goes steeply uphill in the last third of the track. Here you not only see what the cars are capable of, but also which driver can control his vehicle best.\n\nTimetable (CEST):\n\nFriday, 9 September 2022\n\n12:35–13:05 Free Practice 1\n\n15:35–16:05 Free Practice 2\n\nSaturday, 10 September 2022\n\n09:50–10:20 Qualifying\n\n14:00–14:30 Race 1 (20 minutes)\n\nSunday, 11 September 2022\n\n09:50–10:00 Warm-up\n\n12:50–13:30 Race 2 (25 minutes)\n\nSupporting program:\n\nIn addition to the headliner BOSS GP, other racing series will round off the programme from Friday to Sunday, including Drexler Formula Cup, ESET V4 Cup with the TCR Eastern Europe and Renault Clio Cup Bohemia and historic racing classes (HAIGO).\n\nTickets:\n\nChildren under 12 are admitted free of charge, day tickets are available for 13 euros, weekend tickets cost 17 euros.

We have summarised everything you need to know.\n\nTens of thousands of fans will return to the Motodrom from 6 to 8 May 2022 to honour the widely honoured Scottish racing driver Jim Clark, who tragically lost his life in a Formula 2 race at Hockenheim in 1968. They will all bring the past back to life this weekend through intense racing action.\n\nHowever, the organisers of the Bosch Hockenheim Historic are not afraid of building a bridge to the modern age. And so the BOSS GP Racing Series has not only been a regular part of the Jim Clark Revival for years, but also a real crowd-puller. The Big Open Single Seater series was born out of a fundamental question: What should be done with the numerous old cars from classes such as Formula 1, IndyCar, GP2, Auto GP, A1 GP, Superleague Formula or even the World Series? Put them in a museum? Or bring them back to the race track? The answer was obvious. And so the BOSS GP 2022 enters its 28th season this coming weekend. Here are the entrants for the first of six season events in 2022:\n\nSupport races:\n\nIn addition to the BOSS GP Racing Series, five other formula series will be part of the Bosch Hockenheim Historic: Formula 2, plus the Historic Race Car Association‘s racing cars represent the legendary junior Formula Ford, Vee, Super Vee and Formula 3. The Raceclub Germany is home to various single-seater categories up to Formula 1. The Lurani Trophy is a reminiscence of the legendary Formula Junior, which formed the springboard for a great career for countless top talents. And the Historic Formula Vee Europe is, as the name suggests, about one of the most successful and long-lived junior formulas in history. They all open up a glimpse into a past in which perhaps not everything was more beautiful, but in which legends were written and which is associated with numerous and varied memories, not only among older racing fans.\n\nFans of historic touring cars, GTs and prototypes will also get their money’s worth at the Bosch Hockenheim Historic. Five other racing series are dedicated to the automotive jewels with roofs, some of which date back to the 1950s, and which offer absolute highlights in the colourful programme of the traditional event, and not only in the form of the brute racers of the legendary Group C.\n\nTimetable and livestream:\n\nFriday, 6 May 2022\n\n12:40–13:10 Free Practice 1\n\n16:45–17:15 Free Practice 2\n\nSaturday, 7 May 2022\n\n09:40–10:10 Qualifying\n\n15:30 Race 1 (20 minutes) LIVESTREAM\n\nSunday, 8 May 2022\n\n11:05–11:15 Warm-up\n\n15:55 Race 2 (25 minutes) LIVESTREAM\n\nThe programme on Saturday and Sunday, including the two races of the BOSS GP, can also be watched for free from home in the livestream with live commentary: www.hockenheim-historic.de/en/live\n\nSide events at the Hockenheim Historic\n\nAn event like the Bosch Hockenheim Historic thrives above all on interaction with the fans. The paddock and pit area are open and visible to everyone. All the action on the race track will be broadcast on Saturday and Sunday via a large video screen in the Sachs Curve, so that the spectators in the inner grandstand will be well informed at all times about what is happening on the rest of the 4.5-kilometre Grand Prix circuit. In addition, a wide range of information is displayed on the big screen. And if you want to enjoy some quiet time before, during or after your visit to the paddock and grandstands, you can simply visit the Jim Clark exhibition in the congress pavilion.\n\nTickets:\n\nThe ticket prices reflect the family character of the event. Friday tickets start at 10 euros, day tickets for Saturday and Sunday are available from 30 euros, and those who want to experience the entire weekend up close and personal can get in for 45 euros. And for those who like it a bit more exclusive, VIP packages are available from 200 euros. Tickets are available via the online ticket shop or by calling the hotline at +49 6205 950 222.\n\nPicture: Michael Kavena/BOSS GP\n\nOur preview for the BOSS GP Season Opening 2021 at Mugello Circuit on April 9, 10 and 11.\n\nThe BOSS GP Racing Series makes it possible: The upcoming weekend will mark the start of the new season for teams and drivers with their Formula 1, Formula 2, Formula 3000 and Auto GP bolides. At the season opening of Europe’s fastest racing series, one of the most beautiful racetracks in the world awaits the youngsters and gentlemen of BOSS GP. The 5.245-kilometre track in Mugello (built in 1974) is owned by Ferrari and traditionally hosts the World Motorcycle Championship. Last year, the circuit in Tuscany also hosted a Formula 1 race for the first time. The sequences of curves are usually smooth and fast, the topography hilly – all in all an absolute favourite track for many race drivers.\n\nAfter a few years of abstinence, Mugello was added back into the Big Open Single Seater race calendar last year. The Cuvee Sensorium Grand Prix became the season finale in October 2020. The first race was dominated by the duel for the FORMULA championship title between Luca Martucci (ITA, MM International) and Marco Ghiotto (ITA, Scuderia Palladio). Although Martucci won his first BOSS GP race, second place was enough for Ghiotto to defend his title. In rainy conditions again, a lot of courage and skill was demanded of the drivers in race 2. Both were combined by Andreas Fiedler (GER, Fiedler Racing), who added a surprising overall victory to a rather disappointing season.\n\nThe fact that the BOSS GP Racing Series can start the season as originally planned is also thanks to the race organiser Gruppo Peroni, who is hosting the event at Mugello. The support line-up of BOSS GP includes the one-make trophies Lotus Cup Italia, the Mitjet Italia Racing Series as well as sports prototypes, historic race cars and Porsche regularity classes. Due to the pandemic situation, the paddock and grandstands are not open to fans. BOSS GP hopes to welcome spectators back in our paddock soon.\n\nTimetable BOSS GP Season Opening Mugello:\n\nFriday, 9 April 2021\n\n10:35–11:05 Free Practice 1\n\n14:10–14:40 Free Practice 2\n\nSaturday, 10 April 2021\n\n10:05–10:35 Qualification (8+20 minutes)\n\n15:55–16:15 Race 1 (20 minutes)\n\nSunday, 11 April 2021\n\n10:00–10:10 Warm-up\n\n14:30–14:55 Race 2 (25 minutes)\n\nThe starting list BOSS GP Season Opening Mugello 2021:\n\nThe 25th season of BOSS GP starts this weekend at the Hockenheimring in Germany. With more track time and more power than ever.\n\nEurope’s fastest racing series has been around for 25 years, ten of them under the label BOSS GP. Reason enough to get the party rolling for the Big Open single Seater 2019. The season traditionally begins on the Formula 1 circuit of Hockenheim near Stuttgart this weekend (26 to 28 April).\n\nTwo races of the spectacular BOSS GP are on the schedule, in a setting that could hardly be more wonderful: The Bosch Hockenheim Historic, in honour of Scottish racing driver Jim Clark, who died in an accident in Hockenheim on 7 April 1968, attracts around 500 starters and more than 20,000 fans to the Motodrom every spring. The ticket includes free access to the paddock, the exhibitions, the pit roof and the pits themselves.\n\nCompetitors: BOSS GP\n\n20 drivers are registered for the race weekend in Hockenheim. With record champion Ingo Gerstl (AUT, Toro Rosso STR1), Gerd Thöny (LIE, Jordan EJ13), Phil Stratford (USA, Benetton B197) and Ulf Ehninger (DEU, Benetton B197) four Formula 1 cars have been announced.\n\nThere will also be 15 Formula 2 cars on the grid, including local heroes Andreas Fiedler (runner-up in the FORMULA class 2018) and Walter Steding.\n\nThe definitive starter list will be published later.\n\nApart from Andreas Fiedler (paddock), the teams and drivers of the BOSS GP will be based in the front pits (numbers 3 to 21).\n\nTimetable: BOSS GP at Bosch Hockenheim Historic\n\nThe 4.5-kilometre Grand Prix circuit and the supporting events will compete for the favour of the spectators. Each of the three days of the event start at 9 am. Alongside the BOSS GP, the highlights are the FIA Lurani Trophy, the CanAm racing cars and the Young Timer touring cars.\n\nThe BOSS GP will have two half hour practice sessions on Friday. On Saturday morning the qualifying for the starting grid of both races will take place. The first race (20 minutes) will be held on Saturday, the second race (25 minutes) on Sunday at prime time at 2:10 pm. Before that there will be an additional warm-up for the drivers and fans in the morning.\n\nThursday (25 April) is test day.\n\nFriday, 26 April 2019\n\n11:20–11:50: Free Practice 1\n\n16:00–16:30: Free Practice 2\n\nSaturday, 27 April 2019\n\n10:10–10:40: Qualifying\n\n16:10–16:30: Race 1 (20 min)\n\nSunday, 28 April 2019\n\n10:10–10:20: Warm-up\n\n14:10–14:45: Race 2 (25 min)\n\nAll times local time\n\nThe time schedule with all the racing this weekend can be found under the following link: www.hockenheim-historic.de/en/info/timetable/\n\nWeather Forecast: Typical for April\n\nPacking an umbrella can be helpful this weekend. In typical April weather with a change of sunshine and rain the drivers must adapt to changing conditions. At temperatures of around 10 to 15 degrees Celsius.\n\nTickets: Bosch Hockenheim Historic\n\nFor Friday there’s an offer for 10 euro. A day ticket for Saturday or Sunday costs 30 euro each, 45 euro the weekend. Wheelchair users and children under the age of 14 have free admission – paddock and free choice of seat included.\n\nTickets can be ordered on site, via the online ticket shop or by calling the hotline +49 6205 950-222.\n\nFree, but not for nothing: at GAMMA Racing Day Formula 1-star Carlos Sainz Jr., superbike ace Michael van der Mark and the BOSS GP meet – with free admission for race fans.\n\nFor several years now, GAMMA Racing Day has been attracting Dutch motorsport fans: every summer, the event at the TT Circuit in Assen offers a monster programme that is absolute unique. The mix of kart, motorcycle, touring cars and formula cars is nowhere else to be found. It is therefore hardly surprising that up to 100,000 fans make a visit to the north-east of the Netherlands.\n\nAssen, a motorcycle circuit\n\nThe first Dutch Tourist Trophy (TT) for motorcycles took place in 1925, but still on public roads. It was not until 1955 that a race track was built specifically for this purpose, parts of the track however, were still open to public transport. The 7.7 km long track was completely renovated in 1984 and shortened to 6.1 km. In 1992 the current TT Circuit Assen was permanently separated from public transport for the first time. In 2006 there was another change to the layout: The track was shortened to 4.5 kilometres, and safety was significantly improved.\n\nAssen is the only track worldwide where a Motorcycle World Championship race has been held every year since 1949. But Assen is also on the map when it comes to automotive sports: In the past, for example, the ChampCar World Series and the A1 GP started on the TT Circuit. The BOSS GP has also been back in Assen regularly since 2015, providing a mega show year after year. Record winner is the Austrian Ingo Gerstl (Top Speed), who won five out of the last six races.\n\nGAMMA Racing Day: Event of superlatives\n\nFor three days, a densely packed programme thrills viewers on location and live on Dutch television. Admission is free, access to the paddock is limited and costs 15 euros per day or 25 euros for all three racing days. Tickets can either be purchased on site at the ticket offices or online in advance.\n\nDue to the tightly packed program, the BOSS GP only runs one free practice session. Both Saturday and Sunday there will be a race of the Big Open Single Seaters. The race cars and teams of the BOSS GP are located in the pit building, from Pit 11 to 20.\n\nOther series in the line-up: Supercar Challenge, TCR Europe, Ford Fiesta Cup, historic sports and touring cars, FIA Superkart EC, FIM Sidecar World Championship, Yamaha R3 Cup.\n\nPlus: Formula 1 demo laps by Carlos Sainz Jr. in the Renault, superbike demo laps by Michael van der Mark on the Yamaha, Formula 1 two-seater and much more.\n\nTimetable: BOSS GP at GAMMA Racing Day\n\nSaturday, August 18, 2018\n\n10:08–10:38: Free Practice\n\n13:12–13:42: Qualifying\n\n16:30–16:50: Race 1 (distance: 20 minutes)\n\nSunday, August 19, 2018\n\n16:06–16:31: Race 2 (distance: 25 minutes)\n\nParticipants: BOSS GP\n\nThe OPEN class is for type Formula 1 car built from 1997, Champ Car and IndyCar built from 1997.
