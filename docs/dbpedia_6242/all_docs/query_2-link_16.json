The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10 a.m. in room SR-253, Russell Senate Office Building, Hon. Ted Stevens, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. TED STEVENS, U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA Senator Stevens. Good morning. We have a hearing this morning on nominations from the President for the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and the nominee for the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information. We welcome all of you and thank you for coming, and thank the nominees for their willingness to serve. Kevin Martin is currently serving as Chairman of the FCC, and has been with the agency since 2001. Prior to joining the FCC, Mr. Martin served as a Special Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, as well as an advisor to FCC Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth. Mr. Martin, I understand Senator Burr is here to introduce you this morning, and we look forward to his remarks. As many of you know, this Committee recently passed the communications reform bill which would address many of the policy issues that are also before the FCC, and we look forward to hearing from Chairman Martin about the agency's activities. John Kneuer has been nominated to be an Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information. If confirmed, Mr. Kneuer will oversee the National Telecommunications Information Administration, which we call NTIA, and that is the principal advisor to the President on telecommunications information policy. Mr. Kneuer was named Deputy Assistant Secretary of NTIA in 2003, has been the Acting Assistant Secretary since Mr. Gallagher stepped down. NTIA is charged with carrying out a number of provisions in last year's budget reconciliation bill that impact both the DTV conversion and the $1 billion for interoperability grants for first responders. We understand that the nominees have family and friends today. We ask them to introduce their families as they come to the table. First, however, we'll hear from our colleague Senator Burr. STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD BURR, U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA Senator Burr. Mr. Chairman, thank you. It is a good morning, and it's my pleasure to introduce the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, and my friend, Kevin Martin. I want to take this opportunity--and I will be brief--to strongly recommend that you confirm Kevin Martin as the next Chairman of the FCC. As the FCC Commissioner, Kevin's consistently served as an ambassador on behalf of the Commission at a time of great change and uncertainty in the world of telecommunications. He has a unique ability to bring together diverse groups, be they urban or rural or of opposing philosophies, and to forge consensus on complex issues. I've always found his door, as well as his mind, to be open to all who have had issues and concerns before the Commission. Throughout his tenure at the FCC, Kevin has had the best interest of the Commission at heart. And although our policy views have differed at times, he's always been thoughtful and diplomatic at exploring these differences. Kevin's vision of the industry he currently regulates, and his attention to details, make him eminently qualified and the best person to lead the Commission and help move this industry forward in the 21st century. Hailing from my home State of North Carolina, I'm proud to call Kevin Martin a fellow North Carolinian, and also a friend. I will also be proud to call him Chairman, once again, when this committee acts. I trust, Mr. Chairman and my colleagues, that all the members of this committee will confirm Kevin Martin as the next Chairman of the FCC as expeditiously as we can. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Committee for their attention to what I believe is absolutely one of the most crucial sectors of our economy, and that's telecommunications, and the rules and the legislation that it takes for that to flourish in the days, weeks, months, and years ahead. I thank the Chairman. Senator Stevens. Thank you very much, Senator. Do you have any questions, Senator Rockefeller, of our colleague? Senator Rockefeller. No. Senator Stevens. We'll not ask you any questions, my friend. We appreciate your coming to join us. Senator Burr. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Stevens. Now, let me turn to Senator Rockefeller to see if he has an opening statement, first. STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA Senator Rockefeller. I'll make this very quick, Mr. Chairman. I guess I just need to say this directly--I don't think that we've had a real concentration on communications policy in this Administration. The President outlined a goal of universal broadband connectivity by 2007. Clearly, we're not going to meet that goal. We've fallen much farther behind Europe and Asia in the next-generation broadband deployment. I know that many in the industry say that they're doing all that they can, but I, frankly, would disagree. I think access to broadband communications has to be a matter for rural areas, as well as for urban areas. That is not an impossible thing. Wireless will one day take care of that, but it doesn't yet. But a full 25 percent of my constituents in West Virginia have absolutely no access to any form of broadband. I think that Japan is now producing over 90 percent of the world's fiberoptic broadband deployment. However you want to look at it, it's very, very dramatic. So, I think we have to have an aggressive group of folks on the FCC. Chairman Martin is that, cares very much about these things. I fully support not only his nomination, but also the nomination of Mr. Kneuer. And I thank the Chairman. Senator Stevens. Thank you. Senator Sununu, do you have any opening comments? STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN E. SUNUNU, U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE Senator Sununu. Yes, I do, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity for the hearing--this is an important position--and certainly appreciate the introduction of Senator Burr, and would agree with Senator Burr that Chairman Martin, among the nominees that we're going to be hearing from today, is amicable, is thoughtful, and has tried to lead the Commission to the best of his ability. My concern, though, and the questions that I have today, have to do with policy and what kind of policies we're going to pursue, what kind of vision and leadership we're going to have at the FCC, given the current dynamic environment in telecommunications and Internet policy today. Chairman Martin will have an opportunity to provide testimony. I hope we have an opportunity for questions and answers. But, without a doubt, he has pursued policies to restrict marketing of Internet services in an age where those Internet voice services are growing and providing new opportunities for customers today. He's pushed to establish must-carry regulations for multicasting. He's advocated price controls on cable television. And all the while, I think it's fair to say, the Commission has failed to address some of the enormous inequities we see in the universal service system today. And this committee has had hearing after hearing about those problems, about the contribution factor, about weaknesses in distribution, about limitations in access in rural areas. And I think many of those problems fall on the shoulders of a Universal Service Fund that is failing to meet the valuable objective for which it was established. We've failed to address the access-charge regimes, which are antiquated. We have access charges of 10, 12, and 14 cents a minute, in parts of the country, that make no economic sense whatsoever. So, I do think these are significant problems in the policy direction that's been established for the FCC. They're issues that I've been outspoken on, but I think others in the House and Senate have raised them, as well. And these policies are particularly problematic in an environment where we have enormous growth in services, choices, options for customers, and new entrants. As a result, it's particularly problematic when the FCC seeks to protect existing business models or enforce specific business models on the industry. It's a dynamic environment; there are some people that don't like that. It's a very fragmented market; there are some people that don't like that. But I think it's good, from a consumer standpoint, that we have such a proliferation of services and choices on the Internet, choices and--channels and new products and new content being provided by satellite and by cable and by DSL. And it's a mistake to look at what we've had in the way of market structure in the past, or rules or regulations in the past, and say we automatically need to enforce these business models on any future competitors. There's a great deal of power vested in the FCC, and I think that that power needs to be used very judiciously. And I would hope that, in the comments and the responses we hear from the Chairman, it's made clear that in a dynamic environment we ought to exercise the utmost restraint in imposing new regulations that will adversely affect the competitive structure. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Stevens. Senator Dorgan, do you have any opening comments? STATEMENT OF HON. BYRON L. DORGAN, U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH DAKOTA Senator Dorgan. Mr. Chairman, I do. Mr. Chairman, the position of the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission is an incredibly important position. I like Kevin Martin, the Chairman. We've had a chance to meet and talk. I hope to be able to stay; we have an Energy Committee hearing going on, and I hope to stay long enough to ask a series of questions--I'm very concerned about what happens at the Federal Communications Commission, for reasons, perhaps, in some cases similar, in some cases different than my colleague has just explained. In 2003, the FCC began revising media ownership rules. They came up with a rule that would have said in America's larger cities it's OK for one company to own eight radio stations, three television stations, the dominant newspaper, and the cable company, all under the same ownership. It's not all right with me. I don't think it's all right with other people in this country. That is vesting far too much power in increasingly concentrated media. It's vesting far too much power in a few hands. We have about four or five hands in this country in which most of the media exists, and this would further concentrate it. I think it's a horrible mistake. Chairman Martin has announced that he intends to begin new media ownership rule considerations now. Senator Trent Lott and I have sent him a rather lengthy letter about that. My hope is that this committee will address that very aggressively. Chairman Martin was a part of a majority that created those rules that the Court had stayed. My hope is that we will see a different type of ownership rule proceeding come out of the FCC, and a different result, because I think the result they were headed toward is a result that increases concentration, increases the power in the hands of a few, and is, I think, devastating to the future of communications in this country. So, I hope to be able to be here long enough to ask Chairman Martin a series of questions. I appreciate him being here. I welcome his family. And I look forward to the discussion. Senator Stevens. Senator Boxer? STATEMENT OF HON. BARBARA BOXER, U.S. SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA Senator Boxer. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for holding hearings on these two very important nominations. I would like to welcome Chairman Martin. And I hear his daughter is communicating very freely or--is that your daughter or--OK, your son. The FCC has the vast responsibility of regulating interstate communications. And now, more than ever, Americans rely upon various forms of communications to enrich their lives and to conduct their daily business. Whether watching TV or making a call or accessing the Internet, consumers rely on the FCC to be the watchdog over the companies providing these services. And I think that's really worth repeating. Consumers are counting on the FCC to be the watchdog over the companies providing these services. Companies have a voice. The consumers often find they don't. Currently, there are a number of communications and media issues before the FCC that are of particular interest to the public. These include the FCC's media ownership proceeding, reports that companies are turning customer phone records over to the Federal Government without a warrant, and net neutrality. All of these are very hot-button, tough issues. I'm deeply concerned that a loosening of the media ownership rules will allow already-large media corporations to grow. These media giants already use--I kind of want to play with the baby--is what's going on. [Laughter.] Senator Boxer. I am deeply concerned that a loosening of the media ownership rules will allow already-large media corporations to grow. These media giants already use multiple media outlets to promote their views and dominate public debate. Americans have made it clear that a diversity of viewpoints and localism are extremely important to them, and I hope the Commission listens. On August the 10th, I sent Chairman Martin a letter urging him to conduct a public hearing in California regarding its recently released media ownership Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. I'm very pleased that the Commission just announced that its very first field hearing will be held in Los Angeles on October the 3rd. And, having said that, I hope the Commission will now pay attention to the public at these field hearings. It's also vital that the FCC aggressively protect the privacy rights and reasonable expectations of consumers. Reports that telephone companies are handing customer information over to the government without a warrant are very troubling, and I hope that the Commission will examine any allegations of such activity. As the head of the FCC, Chairman Martin is in a unique position to influence the Commission's activities. I have a number of questions regarding these issues and other issues, and look forward to hearing his answers. And I also welcome Mr. Kneuer. He's been nominated to head the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, an agency less known to the general public. But as a result of the Deficit Reduction Act, the NTIA has been charged with a number of new and important projects, including the establishment of a $1 billion program to promote interoperable communications, something I think we all agree has to happen, and the establishment of a program to distribute analog-to- digital converter boxes, another very important project. So, I'm very interested in hearing from Mr. Kneuer about NTIA's progress on implementing these important programs. Mr. Chairman, again, thank you for holding these hearings, and I look forward to hearing from these nominees. Senator Stevens. Senator DeMint, do you have an opening statement? STATEMENT OF HON. JIM DeMINT, U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA Senator DeMint. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Martin, I commend you on your renomination to the FCC. I am very interested in a lot of what you've been involved with, but I want to mention one thing, particularly, today, very quickly, if I can skip around in my statement. I have been working on, along with a number of members of this committee for the last year, an emergency alert upgrade system called the WARN Act. It has passed the Committee here, and, with the help of Chairman Stevens and Ranking Member Inouye, Ben Nelson, and others on this committee, it is headed for the floor today to be added to the port security bill. The same bill is being done on the House side by Congressman John Shimkus. And my concern, at this point, is, the FCC has proceeded with rulemaking on an emergency alert system, similar to the WARN Act, which would set up a mandatory structure which we believe would diminish the potential of a new emergency alert system using wireless technology all across the country. In a number of hearings and meetings with the wireless networks across the country, the potential of competition for the best system is clearly there. And my fear is, if the FCC moves ahead with its own mandates, that we'll end up with another government top-down, one-size-fits-all system that does not use the innovative possibilities that we have. As many of you know who have worked on this bill, the ability, in the event of a terrorist attack or a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, to use wireless technologies to not only be warned of a possible disaster, but to use NOAA information of wind directions and other available information to tell people which way to evacuate, where food and shelter is, a lot of other information that we've seen in Katrina and other problems, that is not currently available. I believe that if this Federal Government sets up the infrastructure to provide these signals and warnings, that our free-market economy can create the best delivery systems that the world has ever seen. And my request today, as we have done to your folks already, is to delay this rulemaking until we see what Congress finishes here before the end of the year, so that we can capture the will of the Congress instead of a mandate of the FCC. And, again, I look forward to your confirmation, but would request, I think, as others have today, that we let the free market work and use government mandates only as the last resort. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Senator Stevens. Senator Pryor, do you have any comments? Senator Pryor. I don't, Mr. Chairman, thank you. Senator Stevens. Would the Chairman and Mr. Kneuer please come to the table? Thank you. As Senator DeMint has just said, his amendment is pending on the floor at 10:30, and I will have to leave at that time. Mr. Chairman, would you please introduce your family for us? Mr. Martin. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Let me start with my mother, who's here with us today and my older sister, Pam. And my wife and our new son, Luke, have just come back in the room, as Senator Boxer was indicating. He's been anxious to communicate with all of you, as well. [Laughter.] Mr. Martin. So, I'm sure that he will probably continue to try to do so. But I do want to thank my mother and my sister for being here, and for all of their support in the past, and certainly my wife for all of her support, without which I wouldn't be able to be here and do the things at the Commission that are required. And I do want to make sure and emphasize Luke, whose birth has certainly been the most exciting thing over the last year to happen to our family. Thank you. Senator Stevens. Thank you. Senator Burns. How old is Luke? Mr. Martin. He's 10 months old. Senator Burns. Send him up here. I know how to quiet him down. [Laughter.] Senator Stevens. You can give him to me. You could have more; I can't. [Laughter.] Senator Stevens. Mr. Kneuer. Mr. Kneuer. Thank you, Senator. I've got a cast of thousands here. First and foremost, my lovely and very patient wife, Mimi, my daughter, Christine. I've got the two Josephs, my son and my father. My mother is here--they came from New Jersey--as well as my brother and sister-in-law, Paul and Melissa Kneuer. And, by a happy coincidence, my mother-in-law's sisters were in town from Texas to see Washington. They're getting a bit of an interactive tour they weren't expecting, but I'm glad that they could be here, as well. We also have our children's nanny, Margaret Bedawa, who is a dear member of the family, as well. And my sister, Ann. And my sister Ann. [Laughter.] Senator Stevens. Well, you're very fortunate to have such a lovely family. We welcome you. And I want to take the prerogative of the Chair to turn this over to Senator Burns in just a minute. If I may, I'd just like to ask a couple of questions before I go manage the bill on the floor. Mr. Chairman, net neutrality was the most hotly debated portion of our communications bill. And it is the subject that's holding up the communications bill, and may well lead to its total defeat this year, after 19 months of work on that bill. I want to ask you, Have you seen any abuse by cable companies or telephone companies in providing access to the Internet? And do you have a system in place for monitoring and identifying any such abuses? Mr. Martin. Well, Mr. Chairman, as you know, the Commission adopted a set of net neutrality principles last August in which we talked about the importance of consumers being able to have access to all of the information that's available for free over the Internet. And we continue to make sure and monitor the situation in the marketplace to see if we've identified any particular problems. And there has only been one instance that's been brought to the Commission's attention, where there was a telephone company that had been preventing consumers from getting access to some of the content that's available on the Internet, and the Commission took action in that instance. We were able to reach an enforcement agreement with them to stop. So, we reacted swiftly to it. And so, I think that the Commission has continued to monitor the marketplace, has been vigilant about it, has tried to continue to make sure that we are enforcing the net neutrality principles, to make sure that consumers aren't having access blocked. I am, obviously, aware of the debate that has occurred within this Committee on net neutrality. Certainly one of the helpful proposals that I think was included in your bill was the prospect of the Commission continuing to do ongoing monitoring, including officially issuing a notice asking for people to comment and identify any other problems that might be occurring, even if they haven't been brought to us in the context of a complaint. And so, I have asked the staff to prepare a notice seeking public comment on that, just as the draft legislation that came out of this committee would propose. But I think we do have in place some steps to monitor the situation. Senator Stevens. Do you think you have any existing authority to take action if a problem develops before this bill becomes law? Mr. Martin. I do. The Commission, I think, does have authority, under Title I of the Communications Act. And, indeed, last summer the Supreme Court, in affirming the Commission's Brand X decision determining that cable modem service is an information service, stated that the Commission had ancillary authority to adopt additional rules over the infrastructure providers of broadband access, if they needed to. So, I think we do have that authority. Senator Stevens. In our bill, we develop a new concept for universal service and eliminate the concept that only long- distance users pay into the Universal Service Fund. You have discussed a reverse auction concept whereby rural telephone companies, wireless companies, and other competitors would compete for the right to use the Universal Service Fund's support. The rural telephone companies in my state have serious problems with that concept. Could you explain that? And is this something you believe you could do without any further authorization? Mr. Martin. Well, there are significant problems with the Universal Service Fund, both with the number of carriers and providers that contribute into the fund and with the way that the current resources are distributed. The Commission has tried to take action on both. And I think that there are additional steps we need to take on both, both broadening the base of people that are contributing, to make sure that we've got an assessment rate on a broad base that's as low as possible. There are various proposals in front of us. I've talked, in the past, about trying to assess fees based upon telephone numbers. But I also think we need to do some additional work on the distribution side. Currently, we've seen a significant increase, just during my time at the Commission, on the number of carriers that are receiving so-called ``competitive Universal Service grants.'' When I arrived at the Commission, those grants totalled less than a million dollars. There is close to a billion dollars being distributed to competitive carriers today. That's putting an incredible strain on the Universal Service Fund, and I think that we need to make sure that we are distributing Universal Service resources in the most efficient manner possible. I grew up in a rural area of North Carolina. My mother still lives on the gravel road where I grew up. My address was Rural Route 3, Waxhaw, North Carolina, when I was growing up. So, I appreciate and understand how important it is to make sure that people in rural areas don't get left behind, but we have to do so in the most efficient manner possible. I think a reverse auction methodology is a serious proposal we should consider. Senator Stevens. Well, by definition, an entity with a fixed system, embedded system, having a wireless competitor would always lose. If you put it on a competitive basis, I don't see how existing technology can possibly survive against new technology, so you automatically have a revolving door, as far as Universal Service is concerned. Mr. Martin. I hope that we develop a system that actually encourages the development and deployment of the best new technologies. We should be determining the adequate level of service that people in rural areas deserve to have. But then, we want to make sure that we have a system that doesn't freeze in place one set of technologies, but, rather, encourages the most efficient technology to be able to go in and serve those consumers. So, I think that we need to make sure that we don't do so in a way that causes significant problems for carriers. We need to have it over a lengthy enough period of time to allow them to recover the resources that they've invested. But I think that we want to have a system that encourages the deployment and moving to new, more efficient technologies. Senator Stevens. But if a small rural carrier in a small community that's met the needs of that community for years is facing a national company that comes in and wants just to replace it completely with a wireless system, and do that nationally, the larger company has got enormous advantage over the local provider. I would hope you really take a look at the concept of continuity and, really, community presence, because the absentee owner, once they get the ability to serve, they have no further interest in that community, as the local provider who started the system, does. And I really think that it's going to be a system whereby the existing local providers are just going to be wiped off the map. And I hope that's not the case. Mr. Kneuer, I do apologize for mispronouncing your name at the beginning. I have a question for you concerning the question of the DTV converter boxes. I'll give it to you and hope you'll answer it for the record. And, again, I must go and turn this over now to Senator Burns, who will chair the Committee. I failed to do this. Commissioner McDowell and Commissioner Adelstein, we appreciate your being here. I think it's one of the few times you've been present at the same time. STATEMENT OF HON. CONRAD BURNS, U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA Senator Burns. [presiding] Well, did we have opening statements by the appointees? Mr. Martin. No. Senator Burns. Do you have an opening statement, Mr. Chairman? Mr. Martin. I do. Senator Burns. Maybe we should go to those opening statements. And could you keep them short, while I attain the batting order up here? Mr. Martin. OK. Senator Burns. If you would, please, and thank you very much. Your full statement will be made part of the record. STATEMENT OF HON. KEVIN J. MARTIN, RENOMINATED TO BE CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION Mr. Martin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and all the Members of the Committee, for this invitation to be here with you this morning. I want to thank Senator Burr for his introduction, and Commissioner McDowell and Commissioner Adelstein for their presence this morning. I do have a brief opening statement and then look forward to answering your questions. Senator Burns. You might want to pull that microphone a little closer. Mr. Martin. I've been fortunate to serve on the Federal Communications Commission for over 5 years, and I've had the opportunity to serve as the agency's chairman since March of last year. The job is not easy, and is, at times, a very humbling experience, but it has also been an enormous privilege, and it would be an honor to continue to serve the American people for a second term. As I told this Committee 5 years ago, I recognize that the FCC is an independent agency and a creature of Congress. Our highest priority, therefore, is to implement the will of Congress. If reconfirmed, I'll continue to look to this Committee and to Congress for advice and guidance. When I came before this committee for my first confirmation hearing, I was asked to make several commitments, all of which I feel I have fulfilled. Senator Stevens asked me to visit Alaska. Over the last few years, I've had the privilege of visiting Alaska several times. The vast beauty was breathtaking, and the communication challenges facing its citizens were eye-opening. Senator Rockefeller, you made me promise to protect the Schools and Libraries Program, which I have faithfully done. And finally, Senator Dorgan, you asked me to have children so that I could fully understand the importance of media from the perspective of a parent. Senator Dorgan, I'm proud to introduce you to my son, Luke, who was born last November. [Laughter.] Mr. Martin. As you know well, the communications industry is going through a time of unprecedented change. Television programs are sold on the Internet and streamed wirelessly to mobile devices. Teenagers use IM and MySpace, not the telephone. DVRs mean you can watch your favorite TV program whenever you want. And mobile phones show movies, play songs, and photograph your kids. In this fast-paced technological environment, regulations often struggle to keep up. If reconfirmed, I would continue to make decisions based on the fundamental belief that a robust, competitive marketplace, not regulation, is ultimately the greatest protector of the public interest. Competition drives prices down and spurs innovation, creating better products, and at lower prices. Government, however, still has an important role to play. We should focus on creating a regulatory environment that promotes investment and competition by setting the rules of the road so that players can compete on a level playing field. And we must be vigilant in our protection of the consumer interest, quick to act when it might be harmed. In the last 18 months, the Commission has worked hard to create a regulatory--or, rather, a deregulatory environment that promotes broadband deployment. We have removed legacy regulations, like tariffs and price controls, which discourage investment in broadband networks. We have also worked to create a level playing field among broadband platforms so that high- speed Internet access offered by phone companies is treated the same as high-speed Internet access offered by cable companies. And we have begun to see some success as a result of these policies. A recent Pew research report found that the number of Americans with broadband at home has increased by 40 percent from March 2005 to March 2006, twice the growth rate of the year before. And according to the study, the prices of broadband service have also dropped. But perhaps most important, the study found that the significant increases in broadband adoption were widespread, increasing by 70 percent among middle-income households and those without a high school diploma, and by over 120 percent among African Americans. I also believe that the government must act when doing so is necessary to achieve broader social goals. While eliminating economic regulations, we must recognize that there are issues that the marketplace alone might not fully address. Government should ensure that people with disabilities still have access to communications, that people in rural areas, schools, and libraries have access to affordable current technology, and that the local police and fire department can communicate seamlessly during a crisis. As memories of Hurricane Katrina and 9/11 continually remind us, basic public-safety requirements must be met. We must ensure that the public has the tools necessary to know when an emergency is coming, and to call for help, that the police, fire, and rescue can communicate seamlessly, and that commercial services can be quickly restored when a disaster strikes. The Commission has taken important steps to ensure that public safety keeps pace with the technological advancements in communications. During my tenure as Chairman, the Commission has taken a balanced approach to policy, eliminating burdensome economic regulations while protecting consumers and preserving our broader social goals. But I am perhaps most proud of the fact that my colleagues and I have been able to achieve such a balanced approach in a bipartisan, collegial manner. Thank you very much for your time and for your attention this morning. I appreciate the opportunity to share with you some of the recent progress the Commission has made, and I look forward to your questions. [The prepared statement and biographical information of Mr. Martin follow:] Prepared Statement of Hon. Kevin J. Martin, Renominated to be Chairman, Federal Communications Commission Good morning Chairman Stevens, Co-Chairman Inouye, Members of the Committee. Thank you for this invitation to be here with you this morning. I have a brief opening statement, and then I look forward to answering any questions you may have. I have been fortunate to serve at the Federal Communications Commission for over 5 years, and I have had the opportunity to serve as the agency's Chairman since March of 2005. This job is not easy; it is at times a very humbling experience; but it also has been an enormous privilege. It would be an honor to continue to serve the American people for a second term. As I told you 5 years ago when first before this Committee, I recognize that the FCC is an independent agency and a creature of Congress. Our highest priority, therefore, is to implement the will of Congress. If reconfirmed, I will continue to look to this Committee and the Congress for advice and guidance. As you know well, the communications industry is in a time of unprecedented change. Technological advances, converging business models, and the digitalization of services create unparalleled opportunities and considerable challenges. Television programs are sold on the Internet and streamed wirelessly to mobile devices; teenagers communicate over IM, SMS and MySpace, not the landline phone; DVRs mean you watch your TV when and where you want; mobile phones show movies, play songs, photograph your kids, and even send you emergency messages. In this fast-paced technological environment, regulations struggle to keep up. If reconfirmed, I would continue to make decisions based on a fundamental belief that a robust, competitive marketplace, not regulation, is ultimately the greatest protector of the public interest. Competition is the best method of delivering the benefits of choice, innovation, and affordability to American consumers. Competition drives prices down and spurs providers to improve service and create new products. Government, however, still has an important role to play. The Commission should focus on creating a regulatory environment that promotes investment and competition, setting the rules of the road so that players can compete on a level playing field. For example, high- speed Internet access offered by a phone company should be treated the same way as high-speed Internet access offered by a cable operator. Government also must act when necessary to achieve broader social goals. Thus, while I support eliminating economic regulations, I recognize that there are issues that the marketplace alone might not fully address. For instance, government should ensure that people with disabilities have access to communications in the same manner as all Americans, that people in rural areas, schools and libraries have access to affordable, current technology, and that the communications needs of the public safety community are met. During my tenure as Chairman, the Commission has taken important steps to remove economic regulations and encourage the deployment of new technologies while protecting consumers and preserving these broader social goals. Increasing Broadband Deployment I have made broadband deployment my highest priority at the Commission. Broadband technology is a key driver of economic growth. The ability to share increasing amounts of information, at greater and greater speeds, increases productivity, facilitates interstate commerce, and helps drive innovation. But perhaps most important, broadband has the potential to affect almost every aspect of our lives. It is changing how we communicate with each other, how and where we work, how we educate our children, and how we entertain ourselves. During my tenure as Chairman, the Commission has worked hard to create a regulatory environment that promotes broadband deployment. We have removed legacy regulations, like tariffs and price controls, that discourage carriers from investing in their broadband networks, and we worked to create a regulatory level playing-field among broadband platforms. We have begun to see some success as a result of the Commission's policies. A recent report from Pew Internet and American Life Project found that the number of Americans with broadband at home increased 40 percent from March 2005 to March 2006 (from 60 million in March 2005 to 84 million in March 2006), twice the growth of the year before. And, according to the study, the price of broadband services has also dropped in the past 2 years. But perhaps most important, the study found that the significant increases in broadband adoption were widespread and cut across demographics. According to this independent research: Broadband adoption grew by almost 70 percent among middle- income households (those with incomes between $40,000 and $50,000 per year). Broadband adoption grew by 120 percent among African Americans. Broadband adoption grew by 70 percent among those with less than a high school education. Broadband adoption grew by more than 60 percent among senior citizens. Broadband growth in rural areas was also brisk (39 percent), although overall penetration rates in rural areas still lag behind those in urban areas. In addition, wireless services continue to grow dramatically. Today, wireless competition is robust, with over 90 percent of the people in this country living in areas where there are at least four cell phone providers. And increasingly, wireless is not just voice, it is also data. Blackberries, hand-held devices, and laptops are increasingly providing broadband connections using traditional cellular, WiFi, and WiMax technologies. While we continue to further reduce the burden of economic regulation on the telecommunications sector, the Commission has worked also to ensure that law enforcement, public safety, and other public interest needs are met. Ensuring Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness When I first became Chairman, I identified public safety and emergency preparedness as another top priority. As memories of Hurricane Katrina and 9/11 continually remind us, one of our most important objectives is to ensure that basic public safety requirements are met. We must make sure that the public has the tools necessary to know when an emergency is coming and to contact first responders. And we must enable first responders to communicate seamlessly. We have taken steps to ensure that public safety keeps pace with the technological advancements in communications. For instance, last year the Commission expanded its emergency alert system rules to include a broader array of technologies, including providers of digital broadcast and cable TV, digital audio broadcasting, satellite radio, and direct broadcast satellite services. In addition to making sure that people are alerted to impending emergencies and disasters, we must also ensure that Americans are able to call for help when they need it. That means that new technologies must be able to communicate with emergency operators. As these new communications technologies come into use, the Commission also has worked to ensure that law enforcement continues to have the necessary tools to obtain appropriate access to them. Finally, we recognize that wireless communications are vital to Federal, state, and local emergency first responders. We have taken steps over the past year to help ensure that public safety authorities have access to sufficient spectrum to meet their needs. Serving Those With Disabilities Accessing communication services is vital to the ability of the individuals with disabilities to participate fully in society. With the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, the Commission was directed to ensure that hearing or speech disabilities not pose a barrier to participating in today's communication revolution. The Commission has taken a number of important actions over the past year to fulfill our statutory goal of ensuring that every person has equal access to this Nation's communications services. These actions include initiating a proceeding to explore solutions for the disabled to access 911 services; extending video relay services; providing Federal support for the provision of Spanish video relay service, allowing persons who communicate in sign language to communicate with those who speak Spanish; and providing for the Federal certification of carriers, which increases competition and facilitates more provider choices for consumers. Maintaining Universal Service The United States and the Commission have a long history and tradition of making sure that rural areas of the country are connected and have the same opportunities for communications as urban areas. In the 1996 Act, Congress explicitly required that the Commission ensure that consumers in all regions of the Nation have access to services that ``. . . are reasonably comparable to those services provided in urban areas.'' Specifically Congress required the Commission to establish Universal Service Fund mechanisms that are ``. . . specific, predictable and sufficient . . . to preserve and advance universal service.'' Changes in technology and increases in the number of carriers who are receiving Universal Service support have placed significant pressure on the stability of the fund. Over the past year, the Commission has taken several steps to ensure a sufficient and sustainable mechanism to collect and disburse funds in an efficient manner. As a result of our actions, the Universal Service contribution rate has decreased from over 11 percent to 9 percent. The Commission is also actively considering establishing a contribution system that is more technology neutral, and a distribution mechanism that is more efficient. The Commission remains committed to pursuing fundamental Universal Service contribution and distribution reform as needed. Managing the Agency Since becoming Chairman last year, I have been most proud of the collaborative manner in which my colleagues and I work. For the first 14 months of my tenure, we had two Republicans and two Democrats, and we were able to tackle extremely complex and controversial issues in a collegial, bipartisan manner. Even since we have had a full complement of Commissioners, almost every Commission item has had bipartisan support. We continue to work together effectively to address the broad range of day to day management issues and respond to the more extraordinary challenges we face. For example, the Commission is responsible for managing spectrum, an invaluable public resource. We have worked hard to improve our auctions processes to ensure more efficient distribution and use of spectrum resources. This market-driven approach maximizes the benefits to American consumers by making spectrum available for widespread deployment of new innovative wireless services. Today, the Commission is currently auctioning 90 MHz of spectrum for advanced wireless services. To date, the auction has raised more than $13.85 billion. The Commission had sold nearly all of the available licenses (1,082 out of 1,122) to 105 different bidders, more than half (57) of which are small businesses. The licensing rules for this spectrum included some smaller, more manageable license areas that can facilitate access to spectrum by entities seeking to provide service to rural areas. During the past year, the Commission has also met unprecedented management challenges. In the face of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, the agency responded quickly and comprehensively in meeting government, industry, and consumer needs. The Commission staff worked around the clock to cut bureaucratic ``red tape,'' reach out to the impacted industries, and help identify resources for use by disaster personnel. We granted more than 90 requests for Special Temporary Authority and more than 100 temporary frequency authorizations for emergency workers, organizations, and companies to provide wireless and broadcast services in the affected areas and shelters around the country. In most cases, these requests were granted within 4 hours, with all requests approved within 24 hours. We are working hard to implement the lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina. Conclusion Thank you for your time and attention today. I appreciate the opportunity to share with you some of the recent progress the Commission has made.

Thank you very much, Chairman Martin. Mr. Kneuer? STATEMENT OF JOHN M.R. KNEUER, NOMINEE TO BE ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR COMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION; ADMINISTRATOR OF THE NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION (NTIA), DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Mr. Kneuer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee. It is my distinct honor and privilege to be before you today as the President's nominee to serve as the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information at the Department of Commerce and as the Administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. Since 2003, it's been my privilege to serve in the Commerce Department under the leadership of both Secretary Evans and Secretary Gutierrez. I'm also honored to have had the opportunity to work alongside the dedicated men and women who have devoted their careers to NTIA and to the American people. If confirmed, I'm committed to working every day to follow the example they set through their dedication and to give them the leadership that they deserve. As you know, among its responsibilities NTIA provides telecommunications policy analysis to the Secretary of Commerce and the President, and manages the Federal radio waves. Throughout the Bush Administration, this intersection of telecommunications policy and spectrum management has been the key focus of NTIA. Working with our partners in industry and across government, we have made large amounts of spectrum available for wireless broadband, and other innovative services, as well as maintaining access for critical Federal and public-safety services. Indeed, as we meet here today, the FCC is in the final stages of an auction of licenses for 90 megahertz of spectrum for advanced wireless services. As of last night, that auction had generated net high bids of nearly $14 billion. More important than the money being raised, however, is the potential for this new spectrum in the marketplace. Once deployed, this spectrum will allow every licensed wireless carrier to be a broadband provider, as well. Carriers that are currently providing broadband services would be able to expand and improve those services. New market entrants will enter the marketplace for the first time. Together, these broadband services and other new technologies are critical to bringing competition to the incumbent cable and fixed-line broadband services, and extending services to rural and other hard-to- serve markets. Now, while this auction is an important event, the process that made it possible is also as significant, as it represents a real model of intergovernmental cooperation. Before this spectrum could be made available for auction, more than 50 Federal agencies needed to coordinate relocation to alternative spectrum. In order for the agencies to be reimbursed for the costs of this relocation, Congress had to act to pass the Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act. I'm grateful for the leadership of this committee in passing this important piece of legislation. Finally, the FCC, in addition to making 45 megahertz available from their own allocations, has obviously done the laboring work in issuing service rules and conducting the auction. As this process demonstrates, new technologies no longer fit easily into regulatory stovepipes. The introduction of new services and new innovative technologies requires cooperation amongst the Administration, the FCC, and Congress. If I'm confirmed, I'm committed to repeating that example and working with my colleagues across government, at the FCC, and Congress so that we can continue to have an environment for future American innovation and competitiveness. In addition to its traditional role, NTIA has also recently been entrusted with significant responsibilities related to the digital television transition. These include providing financial assistance to consumers to acquire digital-to-analog conversion devices, as well as funding for state and local governments' acquisition and implementation of interoperable communications equipment. We are currently working to ensure these critical programs are executed as efficiently and equitably as possible. And, if confirmed, I'm committing to working with the Congress to make the DTV transition a success for all Americans. Thank you, again, and I'll look forward to any questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Kneuer follows:] Prepared Statement of John M.R. Kneuer, Nominee to be Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information; Administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), Department of Commerce Chairman Stevens, Co-Chairman Innouye, Members of the Committee, it is my distinct honor and privilege to appear before you today as the President's nominee to serve as the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information at the Department of Commerce, and Administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). Since 2003, it has been my pleasure to serve in the Commerce Department under the leadership of both Secretary Evans and Secretary Gutierrez. I am also honored to have had the opportunity to work alongside the hundreds of dedicated men and women within NTIA who have devoted their careers to serving the American people. If confirmed, I am committed to working everyday to follow the example they have set through their dedication and to provide the leadership they deserve. As you know, among its responsibilities, NTIA provides telecommunications policy analysis to the Secretary of Commerce and the President, and manages the Federal Government use of the radio spectrum. Throughout the Bush Administration, this intersection of telecommunications policy and spectrum management has been the key focus of NTIA. Working collaboratively with our partners in industry and across government, we have made large amounts of spectrum available for wireless broadband and other innovative services while continuing to provide access for critical Federal and public safety systems. Because of technology and competition policies, American consumers have access to a wide array of innovative services and American companies continue to lead the world in the development and deployment of new technologies, creating global markets for American products. Today, American consumers have access to licensed wireless broadband services offered by multiple providers, using competing technologies at higher speeds than are available to consumers in Europe or Japan. At the same time, American companies continue to innovate with new unlicensed technologies like WiFi and WiMax. Now these services are rapidly evolving from small local ``hot spots'' in places like airports and coffee shops to large area networks that cover hundreds of square miles and provide service quickly and cheaply to entire rural communities. Indeed, as we meet here today, the FCC is in the final stages of an auction of licenses for 90 MHz of spectrum for Advanced Wireless Services. As of last night, this auction had generated net high bids of nearly $14 billion dollars. But more important than the money being raised is the potential for this new spectrum in the marketplace. Once deployed, this spectrum will enable every licensed wireless carrier to be a broadband provider. Incumbent wireless carriers already offering broadband services will be able to expand and improve their services; other carriers will enter the wireless broadband marketplace for the first time. Together these wireless broadband services and other new technologies are critical to bringing competition to incumbent cable and fixed-line broadband services especially in rural and other hard-to-serve communities. Now while this auction is an important event, the process that made it possible represents a model of intergovernmental cooperation and coordination.

I am grateful for your leadership and the efforts of this Committee in moving this critical legislation. Finally, the FCC, in addition to making 45 MHz of spectrum available from its own allocations, has drafted service rules and is conducting the auction. As this process demonstrates, new technologies no longer fit easily into defined regulatory stovepipes. To enable future innovation, we need to work collaboratively together. If confirmed, I am committed to work with the Congress and my colleagues at the FCC and across government to ensure that we continue to create an environment for future American innovation. In addition to its traditional role, NTIA has recently been entrusted with significant responsibilities related to the digital television transition. These include providing financial assistance to consumers for the purchase of digital-to-analog conversion devices, and funding state and local government's acquisition and implementation of interoperable communications equipment. We are already working to ensure that these critical programs are executed as efficiently and equitably as possible. If confirmed, I am committed to working with the Congress to make the DTV transition a success for all Americans. Thank you again for the opportunity to testify before you today.

Describe any activity during the past 5 years in which you have been engaged for the purpose of directly or indirectly influencing the passage, defeat, or modification of any legislation or affecting the administration and execution of law or public policy. During my employment at my former law firm. DLA Piper Rudnick (f.k.a. Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand), I represented a number of clients with interests before the Congress. During the covered period my representation included supporting the initial application to transfer control of DIRECTV to EchoStar, and the eventual sale of DIRECTV to NewsCorp. This representation was on behalf of DIRECTV's former parent corporation, General Motors. I also represented a variety of transportation, defense, and financial services clients monitoring legislative activity. During the covered period this representation did not entail advocacy directly or indirectly related to specific legislation. During my tenure as Counselor to the Acting Assistant Secretary, and Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Department of Commerce, I have supported Administration initiatives before the Congress, most notably the passage of the Commercial Spectrum Enhancement Act (Pub. L. 108- 494). 6. Explain how you will resolve any potential conflict of interest, including any that may be disclosed by your responses to the above items. If appointed to the position of Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information, I will take the following actions to avoid a conflict of interest. As required by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 208, I will continue to disqualify myself from participating personally and substantially in any particular matter that has a direct and predictable effect on my financial interests or those of any other person whose interests are imputed to me, unless such participation is authorized or permitted by regulatory exemption or written waiver.

And, Mr. Sununu? Senator Sununu. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Kneuer, I apologize for ignoring you. We've got--I hope I have more than a minute and 15 seconds, but I imagine it's about 5 minutes, and I do have a few questions I want to ask Chairman Martin, and I'll probably submit most of these for the written record so you can expand, you don't feel the need to make every single point in your oral testimony. First, a few questions about the Internet. Let me just ask a few. You can answer them all together. Do you think that the Internet should be regulated the same as we regulate--with the same regimes that we regulate other communication mediums? Do you support taxing Internet access? And should the FCC be allowed to regulate Google Video and YouTube? Mr. Martin. No, I don't think that the Internet should be regulated in the same manner as other telecommunications networks. And I actually have been opposed to any kind of taxes on Internet access. And, indeed, I've been opposed to any extension of our universal-service requirements to Internet access. I think that would only discourage people from subscribing to Internet access services, if we raise those prices on it. It's one of the reasons why I've been trying to focus on a telephone-number-based methodology. Telephone numbers are the key to using the public-switched telephone network, and I think that would be a more equitable means of contributing for those who are taking advantage of that public- switched telephone network. So, no, I'm opposed to taxing the Internet access, and I don't think they should be regulated the same. Senator Sununu. And Google Video and YouTube video services, should the FCC have the power to regulate those? Mr. Martin. No, I don't think that's necessary, at this time. Senator Sununu. You mentioned universal service and your desire to make some changes with regard to both distribution and revenue collection, but the FCC keeps raising the contribution factor. We're over 10 percent now, 10 percent Universal Service fee on consumers' use of communications. Do you think that there is an upper limit to what you ought to be allowed to impose? Are you willing to go to 20 percent, to 30 percent, under the current structure? Mr. Martin. No. And I think that there is an upper limit as to what we would be able to do, practically, before there was political pressure. But I would point out that, when I became chairman, actually, the assessment rate was over 11 percent. And the most recent assessment rate, that we released this quarter, is actually down to 9 percent. During my tenure as chairman, because of the actions we've taken on both trying to control both the distribution side and of beginning to broaden the base, we've actually been able to bring that down from 11 to 9 percent since I became chairman. Senator Sununu. Explain to me what the logic is behind voicemail qualifying for E-Rate money. They qualify, but it's my understanding that IP voice service does not. Why would voicemail qualify? Mr. Martin. I think that what we've said in the past, as far as for E-Rate money, is that telecommunications services qualified for it, but that not all information services qualified for it. We were actually trying to be more restrictive in what we allow schools to be able to receive money for. And most of the focus on information services was actually on infrastructure for the schools to be able to try to connect to the Internet, rather than for the services and applications that would ride over it. We haven't paid--for example, for any of the software for schools, but we do pay for some of the hardware, which means that we pay for their Internet connections and for wiring of the schools. Senator Sununu. You also subsidize their service, though. Mr. Martin. We do, for their access. We subsidize their Internet access services and items that have been telecommunications services or regulated directly as telecommunication. Senator Sununu. I just want to make the point that it's not all hardware, it's not all---- Mr. Martin. No. Senator Sununu.--infrastructure. Mr. Martin. It's not. Senator Sununu. And, in fact, the access portion is growing very, very rapidly---- Mr. Martin. That's right. Senator Sununu.--and is provided to all parts of the country, suburban as well as rural and high-cost areas. Mr. Martin. That's right. Senator Sununu. And I would simply make a point I've made before, is that you suggest you want to be restrictive so that the objectives of this fund are directed--or the money in the funds are directed--toward the key objectives of high-cost areas and rural areas. There's a tremendous amount of money that remains in the hands of districts that don't necessarily fit that description. A final question about IP voice service. And I know there are a lot of technical factors that go into determining how you assess contribution requirements for Universal Service, but the contribution factor for IP voice providers is approximately 65 percent, and the contribution factor for wireless providers is 37 percent. I'll stipulate both of these are very arbitrary numbers, but it seems extremely disproportionate, and even punitive, to assign a contribution factor of 65 percent to one, and 37 percent to another, when I think it's fair to argue that the overall mix of the kinds of communications that are taking place are quite similar. Mr. Martin. There's some confusion; that's actually not correct. The contribution factor for both wireless and for IP services is the same. Senator Sununu. I'm talking about---- Mr. Martin. It's 9 percent. Senator Sununu. I'm talking about the percentage of revenues. Mr. Martin. No, no---- Senator Sununu. You assess---- Mr. Martin. What---- Senator Sununu.--65 percent of the revenues on IP providers, 37 percent of the revenues---- Mr. Martin. We---- Senator Sununu.--are the basis for the---- Mr. Martin. We---- Senator Sununu.--wireless providers. Mr. Martin. We assess a 9-percent surcharge on all of their interstate revenues. We did studies, and we had people submit studies to us that said what percentage of these services are interstate in nature versus local in nature. And in the wireless side, the best estimates we had were that it was around 37 percent. On the Voice over IP side, the only study that we had in the record said that in the last few years, it had been over 66 percent in each instance. So, we selected 65 percent as a safe harbor. But, in both instances, both Voice over IP providers and wireless providers are allowed to come in and demonstrate that their revenues are significantly more local in nature, and then they don't have to pay that safe harbor. Senator Sununu. I respect the fact that you're trying to make a decision based on data, but it is spurious to make such an important and significant financial decision based on one datapoint. And I think it runs against common sense to assume that the percentage of interstate communication taking place under IP services is twice that taking place under wireless services. I will agree they might not be equal, but a factor of two to one, I think, really does defy common sense. I appreciate your responses, though; they're very direct. And I appreciate the indulgence of the Chairman. Senator Burns. Mr. Rockefeller? Senator Rockefeller. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Martin and Mr. Kneuer, I don't have questions for you, and I apologize, but I'm going to vote for you. [Laughter.] Senator Rockefeller. The--first of all, I want to thank you. It's my understanding you're going to be issuing an order, before too long, with regard to a West Virginia company---- Mr. Martin. Yes. Senator Rockefeller.--on a particular spectrum problem. And that's very important, and I thank you for that. As you know, we've talked about this before. We've been working--you've been working with OMB, we've been working together, to try and craft a letter on the Antideficiency Act-- and that's a very perilous Act--in which case the result of the Act is the opposite of what is intended in the case of the Universal Service Fund. I know you've been working to resolve that, very hard. But I think it has to be said that the OMB appears to be reasonably openly hostile to the Universal Service Fund, and, as is, unfortunate, to the E-Rate program. So, do you--what is your sense of how this is coming along? Can we resolve this? Mr. Martin. Well, I do think that we'll be able to provide you with some of the details of that soon, I hope. I think that, in general, as we've discussed, the Commission's conclusions are that the Antideficiency Act would otherwise apply to the Universal Service programs, that the high-cost program currently has enough in reserves that it would not be in violation of the ADA, and that if the ADA directly applied to the Schools and Libraries Program today, it would require us to raise the assessment rate slightly. So, that would be our best estimate today. Senator Rockefeller. And I thank you. As you know--and Senator Stevens has left--and he's been very helpful to us on this question of the appropriation's 1- year exemption for the Universal Service Program from the Antideficiency Act. And my question to you is, would it be helpful to have another year's extension? Mr. Martin. Well, I think that whether or not Congress decides to extend it any further is really a decision for Congress. I will pledge that, no matter whether it's extended or not, we will make sure it doesn't have a programmatic impact on the program. We will make sure that we have sufficient funds raised and that we are able to continue to have letters go out to the schools and libraries without being delayed. One of the fortunate benefits of some of the steps we've taken to lower the assessment rate is that I do think we have a little bit more cushion if the result is that a slight increase is needed--I think it would be able to be absorbed, at this time, if needed. Senator Rockefeller. Good. I have been trying for, I don't know, 10, 12 years, through a crude mechanism called a tax credit--I, along with a whole lot of other people; in fact, I think 75 Members of the Senate--to get broadband deployment done through a tax credit. And I'm unhappy to report to you that it hasn't worked in any single one of those 10 or 12 years. We've gotten absolutely nowhere. So, do you think that the Universal Service Fund has, in its range, the possibility of support for broadband infrastructure? Do you have the authority to make it a supported service, or is that something that has to come from the Congress? Mr. Martin. I think we have the authority to take some additional steps on the universal service side, but I think that, practically, the fund wouldn't be large enough to absorb that. So, I do think we have the authority. Our authority is pretty broad in Section 254 of the Act, that says that the Universal Service Program needs to ensure that people that live in rural areas have have access to reasonably the same services at reasonably the same prices as those who live in urban areas. I think that language is broad enough that we could do something else, but I also think that the Universal Service mechanism today wouldn't be able to support that financially. So, I think that we wouldn't be able to do that, but I think we have the authority. Senator Rockefeller. Thank you. Thank you very much. Senator Burns. Mr. Dorgan? Senator Dorgan. Chairman, thank you very much. Is it Kneuer? Senator Burns. Kneuer. Senator Dorgan. Mr. Kneuer, thank you. Mr. Kneuer, I intend to support your nomination. Mr. Kneuer. Thank you. Senator Dorgan. I think you have substantial qualifications, and I'm pleased that you offer yourself for service. I do want to mention that, this morning, the trade numbers came out. Today's monthly trade deficit announcement was $68 billion in a month, highest in history. We are engaged in a trade strategy that is fundamentally faulty and is going to be very damaging to this country. Most of the trade debt is owned by--a bulk of it's owned by the Chinese and the Japanese. And I know that being involved in the Commerce Department, you will hear people in the Commerce Department marching around and talking about how wonderful this trade strategy is. It's a disaster. It's been a disaster under Democrats and Republicans. It's grown much, much worse under this Administration, I might say. But I just wanted to make the point that we've had a pretty devastating announcement this morning about a $68- billion monthly trade deficit. That--at some point, somebody needs to say, ``Whoa, this isn't working.'' But, Chairman Martin, you were part of a troika in the FCC that said it was OK to create new ownership rules so that in one major city one company--one company--could own eight radio stations, three television stations, the newspaper, and the local cable company, and that would be just fine, no problem at all. The Federal courts found a problem with that. Do you still feel that way? I mean, you're now beginning a new ownership rulemaking process, but do you still feel comfortable suggesting that in one major American city it's fine for one company to own eight radio stations, three television stations, the cable company, the dominant newspaper? Does that give you pause? Mr. Martin. Yes, it gives me pause. I'm not so sure I would even concede that I was comfortable with the decision when we made the decision previously. Senator Dorgan. But you voted for it. Mr. Martin. I did. I did. Because I thought that the record indicated, in certain of the largest markets, you should be able to purchase more, under the record that we had in front of us. But were we all concerned about the impact of changes in media ownership requirements? Yes. Did it make me comfortable then? I wouldn't say so. And does it give me pause now? Sure. I think that the Commission is diligently trying to go back and reinitiate the media ownership process, to do so with an open mind regarding what we should end up doing. We start that process by not only receiving comments, but doing public hearings and listening to what the public has to say about where we should go on media ownership. Senator Dorgan. Chairman Martin, do you think there's been substantial increased concentration in virtually every area of the media? Mr. Martin. I think that it would depend. When you say ``increased,'' I think it depends upon what you're measuring that against. In general, I would say that yes, there has been increase, but I think that there have been some areas where there obviously has been a decrease. The availability of news and information, for example, by the Internet, is significant, and wasn't available previously, depending upon the timeframe you're looking at. Obviously, in the television area, there's a significant number of sources of news and information because of cable that were not available prior to cable, when some of these rules were put in place. So, it depends upon the timeframe you're measuring, but, yes, there has been "
