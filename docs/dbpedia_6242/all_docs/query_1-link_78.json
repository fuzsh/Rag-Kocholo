        "text": "More than a thousand people who lost $9 million with a once-popular Delray Beach securities broker who hosted his own investment talk-radio show will soon be getting some of their money back.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission began taking regulatory action against Kenneth W. Brown in April 2005, along with three of his companies.\n\nMany of Brown's investors came to him from the long-running, twice-daily radio show he hosted on MoneyTalk Radio, WSBR-740 AM in Boca Raton, a station that reaches the most populous areas of Palm Beach and Broward counties.\n\n\"This was focused very much in South Florida, in particular Broward and the south area of Palm Beach County,\" said South Miami attorney Kevin Love, who is serving as the equivalent of a receiver in the SEC case and is preparing to settle claims by investors who were defrauded, through a $6 million restitution fund.\n\nSome of the investors who are eligible for restitution may not know it, because they have moved and were not able to be tracked down, Love said.\n\nHe is urging anyone who lost money with Brown between September 2002 and July 2006 to contact him if they have not already received notices about the restitution process. Love has set up a website at kwbrownsecdistribution.com so Brown's investors can contact him.\n\n\"There are still many investors who are unaware of this,\" Love said, adding he estimates that fewer than 50 investors with losses still need to be located. \"I want everybody who deserves their money.\"\n\nSeveral of Brown's investors said they were pleased by the prospect of getting some restitution.\n\n\"I lost everything,\" said Rebecca Zaraya, 69, of Boynton Beach. \"It's not a pretty picture, but I try to stay positive.\"\n\nIn their federal civil suit against Brown, securities regulators alleged that he and one of his employees were \"cherry-picking\" stocks — placing winning trades in their own accounts at the end of the day, while putting losing trades in the accounts of investors.\n\nWhen the SEC lawsuit went to trial in 2007, U.S. Magistrate Judge Linnea Johnson found that Brown had caused $9.3 million in losses to investors who held accounts with him over the nearly four-year period. During the same time, Brown, his employee and others profited by $4.6 million, Johnson found.\n\nLove expects to send out letters to all of Brown's investors in the next week or so, informing them whether they qualify for restitution in the SEC case.\n\nBrown had approximately 2,700 accounts under management during the four-year period, and while many of Brown's investors complained about mismanagement of their portfolios, not everyone will qualify for restitution, Love said. Only those investors who had losing trades placed in their accounts as part of the scheme will qualify, affecting about 1,300 accounts, Love said.\n\nInvestors had no way of detecting that the losing trades were being placed in their accounts — it took a detailed SEC analysis to show that, Love said. \"It was impossible for any of these investors to pick up on this,\" he said.\n\nAfter the trial, the judge ordered that Brown had to pay $4.5 million to the SEC, and three of his companies — K.W. Brown & Co., 21st Century Advisors and K.W. Brown Investments — were fined an additional $4.5 million. WSBR took Brown off the radio after the judge's decision, and the SEC revoked his broker's license and the securities licenses of his companies. Brown, who lives in a waterfront Manalapan home, could not be reached for comment. He did not admit any wrongdoing in surrendering his license.\n\nIn the end, the SEC collected about $6.4 million from Brown and his companies, and roughly $6 million of that will go to investors as restitution, Love said.\n\nThe case is unusual because in most fraud litigations, investors receive only pennies on the dollar, while Brown's clients might receive nearly two-thirds of their losses, Love said.\n\n\"Getting 60 cents on a dollar on a fraud is just remarkable,\" he said. \"The SEC just did a tremendous job here to get this much money back.\"\n\nSEC trial attorney Christopher Martin, who handled the Brown civil suit, said a distinction can be made in fraud cases such as the $1.4 billion Scott Rothstein Ponzi scheme, where most of the money is dissipated and few assets remain, and securities enforcement cases such as Brown's, where assets remain and can be reclaimed through court judgments.\n\n\"We went after him,\" Martin said. \"It's a good result.\"\n\nFort Lauderdale commercial real estate broker Rod Loschiavo contacted the SEC in early 2008 — after the agency won its case — to encourage officials to set up the reimbursement fund. He said he could be entitled to several thousand dollars based on his losses during the time he had a portfolio with Brown.\n\n\"If there are some funds there, I think I should be entitled to some portion,\" he said. \"That would be great.\""
