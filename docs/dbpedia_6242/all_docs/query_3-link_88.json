        "text": "A key Member of Congress and two congressional staff expounded on congressional intent in the recently enacted commercial space law at a space law and policy conference in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday. The law’s provisions regarding property rights to materials mined from asteroids were center stage and Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX) left no doubt that he does not want any international organization regulating those activities, but that does not rule out international discussions.\n\nBabin provided the opening keynote at the 10th Eilene M. Galloway Symposium on Critical Issues in Space Law on December 9. The asteroid mining provisions are controversial in the space law community because the 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibits countries that adhere to the Treaty (“States parties”) from claiming sovereignty over the Moon or other celestial bodies. It also requires States parties to authorize and continually supervise the activities of their non-governmental entities, such as companies, making the governments internationally responsible for what they do in space. Supporters of the law point out that no sovereignty claims are made to celestial bodies, only property rights to materials mined from them, and the law fulfills U.S. obligations to authorize and supervise what U.S. companies are doing in space.\n\nBabin stressed that the new U.S. law does not support the idea of any international body regulating space resource mining. Instead, he expects the legal regime to “evolve naturally” over time with the advent of other nations’ domestic laws and development of customary practice. The U.S. State Department, he said, could engage diplomatically with other countries as they develop their own laws that support “mutual recognition of space resource rights,” but he emphatically rejected allowing any “international body to govern space resource mining.” Other countries might want to do that, he argued, in order to “impede” U.S. companies by establishing a “burdensome yoke of an international body around the neck of U.S. innovation. While there is certainly a place for the U.S. to engage internationally, those efforts should focus on mutually beneficial arrangements. “\n\nDuring a panel discussion later in the day, Tom Hammond, Republican staff director of the Space Subcommittee of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, which Babin chairs, reiterated that Babin’s objection is to an international body regulating such activities, not to an international agreement. He stressed that the law only sets forth U.S. policy.\n\nHammond’s Senate Democratic counterpart, Nick Cummings, agreed, saying that they knew discussions were underway in the academic and international communities and “we did not want to set those discussions back. …We want those discussions to happen.” Cummings works for Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL), the ranking member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, who was instrumental in getting the bill through the Senate.\n\nInternational discussions involving the five U.N. space treaties usually take place through the U.N. Committee on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS), which are led for the United States by the State Department. The State Department did not reply by press time to a query as to whether it plans to raise property rights in space at the 2016 meetings of COPUOS and its two subcommittees — the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee, which meets in February, and the Legal Subcommittee, which meets in April. The full COPUOS meets in June.\n\nHere’s our list of upcoming space policy events (updated December 14 to add a link to the list of AGU sessions that will be livestreamed). This version covers the three weeks between now and the end of the year as the number of events dwindles and thoughts turn to holidays and fresh beginnings. The House and Senate will meet this week at least. If they fail to reach agreement on an FY2016 appropriations bill, they might be back next week.\n\nDuring the Weeks\n\nIn Washington, everyone is awaiting congressional agreement on a full-year omnibus appropriations bill that will fund the government through the end of FY2016 (September 30, 2016). Congress extended the existing Continuing Resolution (CR) now funding the government from December 11 to December 16 in the hope that the extra 5 days is enough for negotiators to reach a compromise on what policy provisions (riders) are included. The goal is for the bill to be introduced tomorrow (Monday) and voted on three days later (Wednesday), giving House members three days to read the bill. The House has a rule that three days notice is required, but it is often bypassed. New House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) wants the House to return to “regular order” — following the rules — so if the bill is not introduced tomorrow, the date for a vote could slip. Congress may, in fact, keep extending the CR for short or long periods of time. As members of the appropriations committees point out, it is a wasteful and inefficient way to run a government (not only can new programs not begin, but existing programs cannot be terminated under a CR), so many are motivated to reach an agreement. We’ll see what happens.\n\nMeanwhile, the annual American Geophysical Union (AGU) conference is taking place at the Moscone Center in San Francisco this week. It is always a great venue for breaking news in the earth and planetary science fields and features top level industry, academic and government leaders. For example, Elon Musk is scheduled to be there on Tuesday morning (10:10-11:00 am Pacific Time). Al Gore was just added to the program for a Town Hall meeting on Wednesday at 12:30 pm Pacific Time on “The Earth from a Million Miles: Advancing Earth Observations from L1.” Gore was the initiator of what is now known as the DSCOVR program (originally called Triana), which was finally launched in February after years in political purgatory. It is now at Sun-Earth L1 sending back scientific data and the daily views of Earth that Gore sought. UPDATE: Many of the AGU general sessions, Town Halls, and press conferences will be livestreamed and/or archived on the AGU YouTube channel. A list is posted on the conference website with links. Note that all times are Pacific Standard Time (add three for Eastern).\n\nMusk has quite a schedule this week. He’ll be at AGU on Tuesday and on Wednesday SpaceX will hold a static fire test of the Falcon 9 rocket that will be used to launch 11 ORBCOMM OG-2 satellites “about three days later” if all goes well. This will be the first Falcon 9 launch since the June 28, 2015 failure and the beginning of a series of four missions the company plans to launch in the next two months.\n\nThe last of those four will be the next SpaceX cargo launch to the ISS, SpaceX-8 (SpX-8). NASA will say only that its internal plans call for a launch in “February.” There will be six ISS crew members awaiting those supplies. Three just returned on Friday and three more will launch on Tuesday, restoring the facility to its typical crew complement of six.\n\nSo this will be a very busy week, but if Congress gets the appropriations bill done, a two-week respite should follow.\n\nHere are all the events we know about as of Sunday morning. Check back during the week for anything added to our Events of Interest list as the days progress.\n\nMonday, December 14\n\nNASA Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP), telecon, 3:30-3:45 pm ET\n\nMonday-Friday, December 14-18\n\nAmerican Geophysical Union (AGU) fall meeting, Moscone Center, San Francisco, CA, Many of the sessions will be livestreamed.\n\nTuesday, December 15\n\nSoyuz TMA-19M Launch and Docking of Three ISS Crew Members.\n\nLAUNCH: Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, 6:03 am ET (5:03 pm local time at the launch site)\n\nDOCKING at ISS: 12:24 pm ET\n\nWSBR Luncheon Panel on DOD and Commercial SATCOM, University Club, 1135 16th St., NW, Washington, DC, 11:30 am – 1:30 pm ET\n\nTuesday-Wednesday, December 15-16\n\nInternational Synmposium on the Moon 2020-2030 (ESA), ESA/ESTEC, Noordwijk, The Netherlands\n\nWednesday-Friday, December 16-18\n\n11th Annual DOD Commercial SATCOM Conference (SIA), Crystal Gateway Marriott, Arlington, VA\n\nSaturday, December 19\n\nTENTATIVE date for Falcon 9 Return to Flight with ORBCOMM OG-2 satellites, Cape Canaveral, FL, 8:00-9:00 pm ET\n\nCongress passed a 5-day extension to the deadline for funding the government for the rest of the fiscal year today. The bill, H.R. 2250, passed the House by voice vote. The Senate passed it yesterday.\n\nThe bill in its current from is short and to the point, simply replacing the date of December 11 with December 16 in the previously-enacted FY2016 Continuing Resolution (CR). H.R. 2250 is being used as the legislative vehicle for the CR-extension. As introduced, it was on an unrelated topic, but was in a useful stage of the legislative process to move forward quickly. The Senate struck all the language in the original bill and replaced it with the extension to December 16.\n\nHouse and Senate Republicans and Democrats continue to negotiate over a wide range of controversial policy provisions — riders — that have held up final agreement on the funding bill. It is anticipated that they will reach agreement on a single bill that consolidates all 12 regular appropriations bills — an “omnibus” appropriations — to fund the government through September 30, 2016, but that is not a foregone conclusion. They could simply pass another short term extension.\n\nBut the good news is that today, at least, there will not be a government shutdown for lack of funds. The President still needs to sign the legislation; that should take place in the next several hours.\n\nRep. John Culberson (R-TX), chair of the House Appropriations Commerce-Justice-Science (CJS) subcommittee, which funds NASA, insists that NASA did not comply with the law when it participated in a State Department-led bilateral meeting with China in September 2015. He previously said he would “vigorously enforce” that law.\n\nSpacePolicyOnline.com asked Culberson late yesterday afternoon if he wanted to respond to the release of two letters to him from NASA prior to the meeting with China that provides information and certifications required by the law. SpacePolicyOnline.com obtained the letters through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to the agency and published them last evening. Culberson was not able to respond by press time yesterday, but did so this morning.\n\nVia email, Culberson said:\n\n“We\n\nhave had a strict prohibition in the CJS bill for several years to\n\nprevent NASA from cooperating or sharing information with the People’s\n\nLiberation Army\n\ncontrolled Chinese space program. The notice NASA sent the committee\n\nwas vague and did not disclose the details of the discussions held in\n\nBeijing on September 28, 2015.”\n\nAs reported yesterday, the law dates back to when Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA) chaired the subcommittee and instituted prohibitions on NASA and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), which is also funded in the CJS bill, on any type of activity related to bilateral civil space cooperation with China. Culberson succeeded Wolf as subcommittee chairman and shares his views on this topic. He led the effort to include Sec. 532 in the NASA’s FY2015 appropriations law.\n\nThe law states that NASA may not spend any funds to “develop, design, plan,\n\npromulgate, implement or execute a bilateral policy, program, order, or\n\ncontract of any kind to participate, collaborate, or coordinate\n\nbilaterally in any way with China or any Chinese-owned company unless\n\nsuch activities are specifically authorized by law enacted after the\n\ndate of enactment of this Act.” Those limitations do not apply if “no\n\nlater than 30 days prior to the activity in question,” NASA certifies\n\nthat the activity poses no risk of the transfer of “technology, data, or\n\nother information with national security or economic security\n\nimplications” and does not “involve knowing interactions with officials\n\nwho have been determined by the United States to have direct involvement\n\nwith violations of human rights.” Any such certification “shall\n\ninclude a description of the purpose of the activity, its agenda, its\n\nmajor participants, and its location and timing.”\n\nThe first of the two NASA letters provided to SpacePolicyOnline.com under the FOIA request was signed by NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden on July 31, 2015, well within the 30 day notification period in law. It made the requisite certifications, but provided little detail. The second letter, from NASA CFO David Radzanowski to Culberson, was signed on September 16. It provided more details and repeated the certifications, but missed the 30-day advance notice deadline for the September 28 meeting in Beijing and also revealed that NASA held a bilateral meeting with the Chinese in Washington on September 23. To comply with the law, the notifications to Congress presumably should have been submitted 30 days before September 23, not the 28th.\n\nCulberson told SpacePolicyOnline.com in October that he would “vigorously enforce” the law’s provisions. Whether anything will be included in the final FY2016 appropriations bill now in its final stages of negotiations remains to be seen. Earlier today Congress passed a 5-day extension for government funding. December 16 is the new deadline for agreement on a full year appropriations bill that consolidates funding for all discretionary government activities, including NASA.\n\nThe September 28 meeting was the first in a State Department-led “U.S.-China Civil Space Dialogue.” Another is planned for 2016.\n\nSpaceX will launch four Falcon 9 missions from two coasts in two months if tentative plans coming into focus today prove out. It all begins with a December 16 static fire test of the rocket for the ORBCOMM launch. If that goes well, ORBCOMM’s satellites will launch around December 19, followed by SES-9 and Jason-3 in mid-January, and SpaceX CRS-8 (SpX-8) in February.\n\nSpaceX and ORBCOMM announced the plans for the launch of 11 ORBCOMM OG-2 satellites yesterday. Their destination is low Earth orbit (LEO). SES also announced yesterday that its SES-9 communications satellite arrived at Cape Canveral for launch in “mid-January.” It is headed to geostationary orbit.\n\nToday, NASA and NOAA announced that the much-delayed Jason-3 ocean altimetry satellite is now scheduled for launch on January 17, 2016 at 10:42 am Pacific Time (1:42 pm Eastern) from Vandenberg Air Force Base. It will be placed into a high inclination (66.05 degree) orbit. Its launch had been scheduled for July 22, 2015, but was delayed due to thruster contamination and then by SpaceX’s Falcon 9 failure on June 28.\n\nSpaceX is recovering from that failure, which destroyed a Dragon cargo capsule full of supplies for the International Space Station (ISS) launched as part of the company’s Commercial Resuppply Services (CRS) contract with NASA. It was SpaceX’s seventh operational CRS launch, SpaceX CRS-7 or SpX-7. A failed strut in\n\nthe Falcon 9 upper stage is thought to be the cause.\n\nNASA’s Stephanie Schierholz told SpacePolicyOnline.com via email this afternoon that NASA is working toward a “no earlier than” (NET) February 2016 date for the next SpaceX cargo mission to ISS. ISS Program Manager Kirk Shireman said last week that January 8 was the NET date, but he conveyed that it was dependent on a number of factors. One is NASA’s desire to conduct a spacewalk to replace a failed part on the ISS exterior. January 12-18 is an opportune time to do that, Schierholz said, and “[w]orking toward a February launch date for [SpaceX] CRS-8 affords both NASA and SpaceX important opportunities in preparation for launch.”\n\nThe NASA statement adds that “We’re excited for this historic [SpX-8] mission to bring the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM), which was developed under a public private partnership, to the ISS as a commercial vehicle and continue paving exciting new paths of innovation and cooperation for both NASA and the space industry.”\n\nSpaceX is\n\nproceeding cautiously in its return-to-flight strategy in that it chose the\n\nORBCOMM launch to go first, instead of SES. The ORBCOMM satellites need to go only to low Earth orbit, which does not require a\n\nsecond firing of the second stage as would be needed to reach geostationary orbit. On the other hand, these next four launches present a challenging cadence that will test the rocket (which is being upgraded at the same time) in several regimes: three launches from Cape Canaveral and one from Vandenberg, placing satellites into low Earth orbit, geostationary orbit, and two different high-inclination orbits (66.05 degrees for Jason-3 and 51.6 degrees for the ISS cargo mission), all in about two months. The company additionally plans to continue its attempts to return one or more of the Falcon 9 first stages to Earth to demonstrate reusability, perhaps landing back at Cape Canaveral if it can get the required approvals.\n\nIn response to a SpacePolicyOnline.com FOIA request, NASA today provided two letters that it sent to Rep. John Culberson prior to a September 28, 2015 bilateral meeting with China to discuss civil space cooperation. Culberson said in October that the information he received did not have sufficient depth and scope to comply with a law limiting NASA’s bilateral interactions with China.\n\nFormer Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA), who once chaired the House Appropriations Commerce-Justice-Science (CJS) subcommittee, which funds NASA, included language in NASA’s appropriations bills sharply limiting NASA’s involvement with China. They also limit White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) interaction with China on space cooperation. OSTP is also funded in the CJS bill.\n\nWolf was succeeded by Culberson as chair of the subcommittee. He holds similar views regarding space cooperation with China and has included the same language in recent appropriations legislation.\n\nSection 532 of the FY2015 appropriations law (P.L. 113-235) states that NASA may not spend any funds to “develop, design, plan,\n\npromulgate, implement or execute a bilateral policy, program, order, or\n\ncontract of any kind to participate, collaborate, or coordinate\n\nbilaterally in any way with China or any Chinese-owned company unless\n\nsuch activities are specifically authorized by law enacted after the\n\ndate of enactment of this Act.” Those limitations do not apply if “no\n\nlater than 30 days prior to the activity in question,” NASA certifies\n\nthat the activity poses no risk of the transfer of “technology, data, or\n\nother information with national security or economic security\n\nimplications” and does not “involve knowing interactions with officials\n\nwho have been determined by the United States to have direct involvement\n\nwith violations of human rights.” Any such certification “shall\n\ninclude a description of the purpose of the activity, its agenda, its\n\nmajor participants, and its location and timing.”\n\nThe State Department announced in June that it was initiating a “U.S.-China Civil Space Cooperation Dialogue” and the first meeting would be in September 2015. The meeting took place on September 28 in Beijing.\n\nCulberson told SpacePolicyOnline.com in October that NASA did not provide his committee with sufficient “details on the depth and scope” of the meeting and he would “vigorously enforce” the law.\n\nNASA initially declined to provide copies of any communications it had with Culberson about the meeting. SpacePolicyOnline.com filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the agency for “all correspondence between NASA and the House Appropriations Committee\n\nin August or September 2015 in which NASA makes the certifications\n\nrequired by law regarding bilateral interactions with China with respect\n\nto space cooperation in conjunction with the meeting held in China on\n\nthat topic in late September 2015.”\n\nToday NASA provided SpacePolicyOnline.com with two such letters. The first was sent\n\nby NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden on July 31 notifying Culberson that NASA would participate in the State Department-led meeting and making the required certifications. The second was signed by NASA Chief Financial Officer David Radzanowski on September 16 restating the certifications and providing an agenda for the meeting in Beijing on September 28, as well as an earlier meeting at NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. on September 23. The Radzanowski letter references a July 22 letter from Bolden to Culberson, but NASA did not provide that in response to SpacePolicyOnline.com’s FOIA request. It predated the July 31 letter that NASA did provide. (Our original request for all correspondence between NASA and the committee in August or September 2015 related to the meeting with China was rejected because it was not specific enough, so we resubmitted it asking for letters where the required certifications were made.)\n\nThe Bolden letter was well within the 30-day time limit specified in the law and provided the requisite certifications, but little detail. The Radzanowski letter provided an agenda, list of Chinese participants, location and timing, but was not sent within that time limit.\n\nRep. Culberson had not responded by press time to a SpacePolicyOnline.com request for any additional comment he might want to make about the information he believes was missing from NASA’s communications prior to the meeting.\n\nUPDATE, December 11, 2015: Soyuz TMA-17M landed successfully, although weather conditions at the landing site were very poor and confirmation of landing did not occur until many minutes after the scheduled landing time of 8:12 am EST. Recovery forces are using an expedited procedure to get the crew out of the capsule and onto helicopters.\n\nORIGINAL STORY, December 10, 2015: Three International Space Station (ISS) crew members are preparing to return to Earth early tomorrow (Friday) morning Eastern Standard Time (EST). NASA’s Kjell Lindgren, JAXA’s Kimiya Yui and Roscosmos’s Oleg Kononenko are scheduled to land in Kazakhstan at 8:12 am EST.\n\nThe three men launched to the ISS aboard Soyuz TMA-17M on July 22, 2015, giving them almost 5 months on orbit.\n\nThree more crew members will be launched next Tuesday to replace them on Soyuz TMA-19M. That crew includes the first British astronaut sponsored by the British government, Tim Peake.\n\nHe is not the first Briton in space, however. Helen Sharman achieved that distinction in 1991 when she flew to Russia’s Mir space station as a “tourist.” Other people who were born in Britain, but became U.S. citizens before joining the NASA astronaut corps, also have flown. The British government’s decision to support a British astronaut as part of the European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut corps is generally seen as an indication that the British government has a more positive view of human exploration than in the past (where space applications has been the predominant theme).\n\nHouse Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers (R-KY) today introduced a Continuing Resolution (CR) to keep the government operating for 5 more days past the Friday deadline when the current CR expires. The hope is that work can be completed on a bill that will fund it for the rest of FY2016 by early next week.\n\nFY2016 began on October 1 and Congress should have passed 12 regular appropriations bills by then to pay for defense and non-defense discretionary federal government activities including DOD, NASA and NOAA. None of those bills cleared Congress and a CR was enacted instead to keep agencies operating at FY2015 levels until agreement could be reached. That CR expires on Friday, December 11.\n\nA budget deal reached at the end of October between the White House and Congress cleared the way for agreement on spending levels, but policy provisions — “riders” — continue to hold up final action. It is expected that all 12 bills will be combined into a single consolidated or “omnibus” appropriations bill that provides funding through the end of the fiscal year on September 30, 2016.\n\nThe decision to introduce another short-term CR can be viewed as good news in the sense that it indicates all sides may be close to an agreement if given just a few more days, though critics would argue that sufficient time has passed that they should have been able to get the job done by Friday.\n\nThe bill, H.J. Res. 75, would fund government operations at their current level though Wednesday, December 16. Rogers said in a statement that it is his “hope and expectation that a final, full-year bill will be enacted before this new deadline.”\n\nJapan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe today expressed his support for extending operations of the International Space Station (ISS) through 2024. President Obama just signed legislation codifying his pronouncement last year that the United States intends to operate ISS until then, four years longer than previously announced.\n\nThe ISS is a partnership among the United States, Russia, Canada, Japan and 11 European countries operating through the European Space Agency (ESA). Russia and Canada have formally agreed with the U.S. plan, while Japan and ESA have not officially done so.\n\nThe Japan Times reported today that Abe stated at a ministerial meeting that Japan supports extending ISS to 2024. It is not clear whether he was formally committing Japan to that time schedule or commenting within the context of Japan’s internal deliberations on the future of the facility. No official statement from the Prime Minister’s office has been released as of press time.\n\nThe newspaper reported that Japan has spent $7.3 billion on ISS to date. Japan built the Kibo (Hope) scientific research module that is part of the U.S. segment of ISS along with ESA’s Columbus and the U.S. Destiny science modules (Russia has its own science modules on the Russian segment). The total cost to the United States of building the ISS (not operating it after construction ended in 2011) is estimated to be $60-100 billion depending on factors such as how costs for space shuttle launches are defined (average cost, full cost, or marginal cost) and whether costs are counted beginning when the program began in 1984 or when it was revised to bring in Russian cooperation in 1993. Russia, Canada and ESA have spent their own funds on developing their portion of the ISS. With the exception of Russia, there is no exchange of funds between the United States and the other ISS partners.\n\nJapan also builds and launches Kounotori HTV cargo spacecraft to resupply the ISS about once a year. The most recent, HTV5, was launched in August and deorbited in September. It is the largest of the cargo vehicles currently supporting ISS, capable of delivering about 5.5 metric tons (MT) of supplies, experiments, and equipment. That compares, for example, to the 3.5 MT aboard the upgraded U.S. Orbital ATK Cygnus spacecraft due to reach ISS tomorrow morning.\n\nSeveral Japanese astronauts have worked aboard the ISS, including Kimiya Yui who is now on ISS and scheduled to return to Earth on Friday.\n\nPresident Obama announced in January 2014 that the United States wanted to extend ISS operations to 2024. Congress passed H.R. 2262 last month officially committing the United States to operating ISS “at least” until that time. The President signed that bill into law on November 25.\n\nAt first, Russia praised the launch of a Soyuz 2.1v rocket from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome on Saturday, only the second for this version of Soyuz. It soon became apparent, however, that one of the two payloads, Kanopus-ST, did not separate from the Volga upper stage. The two are expected to reenter imminently.\n\nTwitter is ablaze with postings from experts who analyze the Russian space program and the orbital parameters of space objects based on information from the U.S. Joint Space Operations Center (JSPoC). An early announcement in the Russian media that all went according to plan and JSPoC element sets (ELSETS) showing the expected number of objects (three) led to some misunderstanding about what transpired. The addition of a fourth object this evening (Eastern Standard Time) is adding to the confusion.\n\nSpace analyst Bob Christy of zarya.info (@zarya_info) told SpacePolicyOnline.com by email the problem was “a separation issue between Volga and the payload. The mechanism failed either totally or in part.” The payload that will soon reenter Earth’s atmosphere and burn up, Kanopus-ST (or Canopus-ST), or Kosmos 2511, is a “small military satellite with optical and microwave sensors to monitor naval activity on and below the ocean” according to Christy’s website. A second payload, Kosmos 2512, did achieve its intended orbit. It is a small military radar calibration satellite per Christy.\n\nRussianSpaceWeb’s Anatoly Zak (@russianspaceweb) reports that one of the four latches that connect the payload to the upper stage did not open. He describes the long history of the development of Kanopus-ST, which has a UHF radiometer and a camera for optical imaging of land and ocean surfaces.\n\nAs discussed via Twitter by orbit analysts T.S. Kelso (@TSKelso), Jonathan McDowell (@planet4589) of Jonathan’s Space Report, and Brian Weeden (@brianweeden) of the Secure World Foundation, the fourth object now reported by JSPoC could indicate either the spacecraft finally did separate from the upper stage or is a piece of related debris. All of it will reenter soon.\n\nPerhaps more important to Russia than the loss of the satellite, however, is its ongoing difficulties in conducting rocket launches. Its once sterling reputation has been tarnished over the past five years with repeated failures of several different types of rockets. Another version of Soyuz, the Soyuz 2.1a, which failed to place the Progress M-27M spacecraft loaded with cargo for the International Space Station into the correct orbit in April, is one example, but there are many others. The failures have led to wholesale changes in Russia’s space organizational structure, but it seems they have not solved all the problems yet.\n\nOther versions of Soyuz, however, like the Soyuz-U used for sending crews to the International Space Station, are highly reliable.\n\nThe Soyuz 2.1v made its first flight in 2013. In one piece of good news for the Russians, the first stage, which performed successfully, is powered by an NK-33 rocket engine. Orbital Sciences Corporation used NK-33s (refurbished in the United States by Aerojet Rocketdyne and redesignated AJ-26) for the original version of its Antares rocket, but an October 2014 launch failure traced to that engine led the U.S. company to switch to a different Russian engine (RD-181) for future Antares flights.\n\nZak tweeted soon after the Soyuz 2.1v launch that it “rehabilitated” the NK-33’s reputation."
