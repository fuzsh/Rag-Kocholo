        "text": "BLINKEN: UKRAINE IN A TOUGH SPOT: After traveling covertly overnight by train from Poland, Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Kyiv this morning for meetings with Ukraine’s president and other senior officials to deliver a message of reassurance as Ukraine is facing serious challenges from an aggressive new Russian offensive that is threatening to overwhelm Ukraine’s defenses in the north.\n\n“While in Ukraine, Secretary Blinken will meet with President Volodymyr Zelensky, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, and Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba to discuss battlefield updates, the impact of new U.S. security and economic assistance, long-term security and other commitments,” the State Department said in a statement announcing Blinken’s arrival. “He will emphasize America’s commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and democracy in the face of Russia’s ongoing aggression.”\n\nIn brief remarks before their first meeting, both Blinken and Zelensky admitted Ukraine is now in a tough spot, the result primarily of the six-month delay by the U.S. Congress in approving a $61 billion aid package, a delay that left Ukraine’s artillery and air defense systems greatly depleted.\n\n“That has put Ukraine in a hole, and we’ve made no bones about that from this podium,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan said at a White House briefing Monday.\n\nBlinken is scheduled to deliver remarks tonight at the Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute to “address how the United States and other Allies and partners will help Ukraine achieve its goal of building a free, prosperous, and secure democracy — fully integrated into Europe and the Transatlantic Alliance,” according to the State Department. His speech will be livestreamed at 11 a.m. Eastern time.\n\n‘RUSSIA HAS CONTINUED TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE’: With Russia expanding its foothold in the north and eyeing a future assault on Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, Ukrainian defenders who have been forced to fall back are in desperate need of practically everything.\n\n“Russian forces continued to make tactically significant advances north and northeast of Kharkiv City on May 13 and currently appear to be prioritizing the rapid establishment of a buffer zone along the international border over setting conditions for deeper penetrations into northern Kharkiv Oblast,” the Institute for the Study of War said in its latest assessment.\n\n“Active hostilities are very close. Ukrainians are concerned about it, so timely assistance is very important,” Andriy Yermak, a top adviser to Zelensky, said yesterday. “Kharkiv is an important strategic city. A large number of people stay there. We have preserved and will preserve it.”\n\n“Russia has continued to push the envelope in terms of just the brutality, intensity of its campaign,” Sullivan said. “It has sought more targets across a wider range of Ukraine, most of them civilian, frankly, trying to destroy the Ukrainian electricity grid with an even greater determination this year than they had last year.”\n\n‘THE LEVEL OF INTENSITY … IS 10 OUT OF 10’: Sullivan along with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. held urgent consultations by phone with their Ukrainian counterparts ahead of Blinken’s visit.\n\n“We spoke for 90 minutes. It was a detailed conversation about the situation on the front, about the capabilities that they are most in need of, and a real triage effort to say ‘get us this stuff this fast so that we can be in a position to effectively defend against the Russian onslaught,’” Sullivan said.\n\n“Our whole coalition, with the president, Secretary Austin, myself working day in, day out to coordinate those deliveries and to put Ukraine in a position where it is better able to defend against what Russia is throwing at them, and what they are throwing at them is quite considerable,” Sullivan said. “Some of that equipment is already on the battlefield. On Friday, [President Joe Biden] signed out another package. Some of that equipment will get onto the battlefield this week.”\n\n“What you will see is a steady flow week by week. It’s not like we’ve got to wait well out into the future before stuff starts getting delivered,” Sullivan said. “We’re doing everything humanly possible, both ourselves and our allies who are surging equipment as well, to get it there to the front lines. … The level of intensity being exhibited right now in terms of moving stuff is at a 10 out of 10.”\n\nISW: BIDEN POLICY HAS GIVEN RUSSIA ‘A VAST SANCTUARY’: In a special report, George Barros of the Institute for the Study of War argued that defeating Russia’s Kharkiv offensive requires allowing Ukraine to eliminate Putin’s “safe space.”\n\n“Current U.S. policy prohibiting Ukraine from using U.S.-provided weapons in the territory of the Russian Federation is severely compromising Ukraine’s ability to defend itself against the renewed cross-border invasion Russia has recently launched in Kharkiv Oblast,” Barros wrote. “U.S. policy has effectively created a vast sanctuary in which Russia has been able to amass its ground invasion force and from which it is launching glide bombs and other long-range strike systems in support of its renewed invasion.”\n\n“Russian aircraft can strike Kharkiv City indefinitely without ever leaving the sanctuary of Russian airspace. Kharkiv City lies 40 kilometers from Russia’s international border with Ukraine. Russia’s glide bombs have a glide range of 40-60 kilometers. Ukraine’s air defense systems do not have the capability to intercept glide bombs once they have been launched from Russian fighter-bombers. The Russian Air Force can therefore strike Kharkiv City without ever entering Ukraine’s sovereign airspace. It is absurd to constrain Ukraine’s ability to counter Russia’s glide bomb threat in Kharkiv at this pivotal movement,” Barros concluded. “Whatever the merits of this U.S. policy before the Russian assault on Kharkiv Oblast began, it should be modified immediately to reflect the urgent realities of the current situation.”\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nGood Tuesday morning and welcome to Jamie McIntyre’s Daily on Defense, written and compiled by Washington Examiner National Security Senior Writer Jamie McIntyre (@jamiejmcintyre) and edited by Stacey Dec.

Those big monster car manufacturing plants that you’re building in Mexico right now, and you think you’re going to get that, you’re going to not hire Americans and you’re going to sell the cars to us,” Trump said at a rally in Dayton, Ohio, in March. “Now, we’re going to put a 100% tariff on every single car that comes across the line, and you’re not going to be able to sell those cars if I get elected.”\n\nCurrently, very few EVs from China are sold in the U.S., but subsidized by the Chinese government, some models sold in China cost as little as $12,000.\n\nWHITE HOUSE CRITICIZES TRUMP TARIFFS AHEAD OF REPORTED BIDEN CHINA ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nUS BANS RUSSIAN URANIUM: Biden last night signed into law the bipartisan “Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act,” which bans imports of enriched uranium from Russia. The law will “strengthen our nation’s energy and economic security by reducing — and ultimately eliminating — our reliance on Russia for civilian nuclear power,” the White House said in a statement by national security adviser Jake Sullivan.\n\nThe law will take effect in three months but grants waivers to U.S. utility companies that operate nuclear reactors, giving them until 2028 to find other sources of uranium. The law also provides almost $3 billion to help stimulate domestic uranium processing.\n\n“This new law reestablishes America’s leadership in the nuclear sector,” Sullivan said. “It will jumpstart new enrichment capacity in the United States and send a clear message to industry that we are committed to long-term growth in our nuclear sector.”\n\nPUTIN’S MILITARY SHAKE-UP: Russian President Vladimir Putin’s surprise decision to fire his longtime Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and replace him with an economist with no military experience is widely seen as a recognition by Putin that over the long term, logistics win wars, and Russia rapidly needs to ramp up its defense manufacturing sector.\n\nPutin’s selection of Andrei Belousov underscores the need for Russia to rebuild its military, which has been significantly attrited by Ukraine over more than two years of combat, all while preparing for several more years of war.\n\n“He’s a first deputy prime minister. His background is in economics and not defense,” retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling said on CNN on Sunday. “It’s likely a reflection of Putin’s trust in him and the need for better internal management within the Ministry of Defense.”\n\n“Look, it’s an opaque system. It’s run by one man, Vladimir Putin. He calls the shots. He may move around professionals into various roles, but at the end of the day, he seems bound and determined to continue to try to inflict a brutal war of aggression on Ukraine,” Sullivan said when asked about the significance of the shake-up. “I can’t draw any conclusions at this point. We’ll have to see what unfolds.”\n\nRUSSIA ANNOUNCES SHAKE-UP TO PUTIN’S NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM\n\nTHE RUNDOWN:\n\nWashington Examiner: Netanyahu under fire, in Israel and abroad, for lack of strategy to defeat Hamas\n\nWashington Examiner: US-Israel relationship has not changed ‘fundamentally’ over paused weapons, envoy claims\n\nWashington Examiner: Army officer resigns over continued US support for Israel\n\nWashington Examiner: House Republicans target Biden after pausing weapons shipments to Israel\n\nWashington Examiner: Philippines ‘alarmed’ by China’s suspected new island-building\n\nWashington Examiner: White House criticizes Trump tariffs ahead of reported Biden China announcement\n\nWashington Examiner: Biden administration set to announce new tariffs on electric vehicles from China\n\nAP: Biden blocks Chinese-backed crypto mining firm from land ownership near Wyoming missile base\n\nReuters: U.S. And Taiwan Navies Quietly Held Pacific Drills In April\n\nWall Street Journal: Russia’s Bombardment of Ukraine Is More Lethal Than Ever\n\nWashington Post: Second Russian invasion is worse than the first, Kharkiv evacuees say\n\nAP: Ex-Ukrainian president says US delay in war aid was ‘colossal’ waste, let Putin inflict more damage\n\nNew York Times: White House Says Israel Still Hasn’t Offered Plan For Protecting Civilians In Rafah\n\nAP: Misery deepens in Gaza’s Rafah as Israeli troops press operation\n\nAP: More than half a million people flee fighting in Rafah and northern Gaza, UN says\n\nWall Street Journal: Israel’s Rafah Offensive Strains 45 Years Of Peace With Egypt\n\nWashington Post: U.S. threats led to rupture of vital military ties, Nigerien leader says\n\nThe War Zone: USS Carney Destroyed 65 Houthi Targets During Its Cruise\n\nAP: US calls on Iran to halt `unprecedented’ weapons transfers to Yemen’s Houthis for attacks on ships\n\nBreaking Defense: Draft House Subcommittee NDAA Language OKs Pentagon Commercial ‘Space Reserve’ Plan\n\nMilitary.com: 19.5 Percent Pay Hike for Junior Enlisted, 4.5 Percent for Everyone Else: House Panel Unveils Bill with Proposed Raises\n\nDefense News: House Lawmakers Aim to Cut F-35 Buy as Patience with Delays Wears Thin\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine: USAF Will Retire, Not Repair, Damaged B-2; Fleet Shrinking to 19 Aircraft\n\nThe War Zone: New Skunk Works Stealthy Tanker Concept Unveiled\n\nAviation Week: Next Generation Airlift Is Coming, but Not Anytime Soon\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine: Can the Air Force Do More to Shelter Its Aircraft from a Potential China Strike?\n\nWashington Post: Pentagon worried its primary satellite launcher can’t keep pace\n\nDefense One: Enemies May Disrupt US Satellites by Hacking Ground Stations, Pentagon Says\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine: Biggest Space Flag Ever Takes On Operational Focus\n\nAir & Space Forces Magazine: Canadian Defense Minister: China Spy Balloon Was ‘Wake-Up Call’ to Modernize\n\nDefense News: Lawmakers Propose DIU-Managed Military Testing and Evaluation Cell\n\nSpaceNews: Terran Orbital Confirms New Satellite Deal with Lockheed Martin Ahead of Earnings\n\nAP: Questions and Grief Linger at the Apartment Door Where a Deputy Killed a US Airman\n\nAP: Army whistleblower who exposed alleged Australian war crimes in Afghanistan is sentenced to prison\n\nThe Cipher Brief: Former Top NATO Commander Warns of “Drone Swarm” Threat\n\nThe Cipher Brief: Opinion: ‘Lamps are Going Out all over Europe’ when it comes to Russian Espionage\n\nC4ISRNET: Opinion: America needs to lead in drone warfare\n\nTHE CALENDAR:\n\nTUESDAY | MAY 14\n\n9 a.m. — German Marshall Fund of the U.S. virtual discussion: “From Ukraine to the Middle East: How Crisis-Proof is European Foreign Policy?” with Riccardo Alcaro, head of the Institute of International Affairs’s Global Actors Program; Nathalie Tocci, director, Institute of International Affairs; Lisa Musiol, head of EU affairs, International Crisis Group; Henry Foy, Financial Times Brussels bureau chief; Alexandros Yannis, head of policy planning and strategic foresight, European External Action Service; and Kristina Kausch, deputy managing director and senior fellow at GMF South https://www.gmfus.org/event/ukraine-middle-east\n\n9 a.m. — New America virtual Space Intersections Symposium: “How will religious and political ideologies define the future of human expansion into space?” with Ken Wisian, associate professor, University of Texas, Austin, and Namrata Goswami, professor at Arizona State University’s School of Global Management https://www.newamerica.org/future-tense/events/online\n\n10 a.m. — U.S. Institute of Peace virtual discussion: “Counterterrorism in Afghanistan and Pakistan,” with Laurel Miller, president and CEO of the Asia Foundation; retired Lt.
