I am hoping your busy calendars can find room for the following special event: In my role as Vice President, Washington Space Business Roundtable (WSBR), my colleagues and I will be hosting Richard Dalbello, Director, Office of Space Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce on Wednesday, February 14, 2023, 12Noon to 1:30 pm eastern time. Sign-in/networking starts at 11:30 am. Location: Hogan Lovells LLP, 555 13th St NW, Washington, DC. Close to Metro Center 13th Street entrance. The Aerospace Corporation is kindly sponsoring. As OSC Director, Dalbello is responsible for managing the Department’s efforts to establish a space traffic control system to ensure safe space operations for commercial and international civil space ventures. In addition, Richard is responsible for the regulation of the US commercial remote sensing industry and for general advocacy, across the government, for commercial space industry interests. As Congress and the White House consider tasking the Office of Space Commerce with overseeing a wide range of commercial in-space activities, learn how his office is addressing its important scope of work, his perspectives on the coming year for the commercial space sector, and how the Office of Space Commerce is focusing on ensuring that space remains sustainable in the long-term – both for commerce, and for safety. Rich is well known to many of us in the space community and his office literally, impacts, directly or indirectly, nearly all of us in the commercial space industry. I strongly encourage all of you to attend and network with your colleagues and hear Dalbello's update on his office and the Administation's latest policy/regulatory initiatives.
