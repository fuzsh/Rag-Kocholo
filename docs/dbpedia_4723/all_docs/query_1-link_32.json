The vessel class name honours the Russian writer Dmitriy Andreyevich Furmanov (1891-1926) who also served as Bolshevik commissar (Red Army officer).\n\nThese Russian river cruise ships (a total of 27 units) were all produced by VEB Elbewerft Boizenburg and represent an upgraded (larger) version of Project 301 (Vladimir Ilyich-class) riverboats. These ships were used for passenger (cruise) shipping in Northwestern USSR - on the rivers Volga, Belomorkanal, Lake Onega, Volga–Don Canal, Kama and Amur rivers, as well as on Dnieper River (Ukraine), Black Sea (coastal cruising) and Yangtze River (in China). Following the USSR's collapse (1991), all these boats were acquired by private companies (Russian and foreign).\n\n\"Project 302\" ship technology\n\n\"Project 302\" ships have the following details:\n\nLOA length 129 m (423 ft)\n\nwidth 17 m (55 ft)\n\nDWT tonnage 3852 tons\n\nV-shaped hulls - differ by series as external elements, window shape (rectangular or rounded), wheelhouse headlights\n\n5 decks (4 passengers)\n\nOriginally, each boat had capacity 332 passengers and 98 crew, all-outside cabins (1-2-3-bed), 2 restaurants (180 seats plus 80 seats), Cafe Bar (79 seats, with dance floor), 2 bar lounges (common rooms), Cinema (102 seats), Music Hall with Bar (75 seats), Observation Lounge with Bar (75 seats), Sauna Room, Souvenir Shop, Hair Salon, Massage Salon, Library, Hospital (first-aid room), 360-degree Promenade Deck (with outdoor seating / 100 seats, sports area).\n\nPowerplant includes three marine diesel engines \"Viertakt-Dieselmotor \" (4-stroke, model 6ЧРН 36/45 / aka ЭГ70-5) each with a turbocharger.\n\nPropulsion consists of 3 bow thrusters.\n\nThe powerplant consists of 3x diesel engines (4-stroke 6ЧРН 36/45, aka EГ70-5) with turbocharger and total power output 2,2 MW.\n\nStaterooms are single, double and quads (originally 1-2-3-bed cabins) with en-suite bathrooms.\n\nAfter reconstruction, to the ships were introduced larger cabins (including suites) and quads (with 2 upper bunks / wall-mounted Pullman beds).\n\nAll these traditional Russian ships were modernized, completely refurbished and rebuilt for both domestic and foreign river cruise companies. During their multi-million dollar drydock refits, the vessel's passenger capacity was considerably reduced to improve travel comfort and safety.\n\nProject 302 ships\n\nFrom Project 302's first series are the boats\n\nDmitriy Furmanov (1983, Дмитрий Фурманов)\n\nAkademik Viktor Glushkov (1983, now Igor Stravinsky / Игорь Стравинский)\n\nNovikov-Priboy (1983, now Sergei Rachmaninov)\n\nAleksey Surkov (1984, now Viking Helgi)\n\nKonstantin Simonov (1984, Константин Симонов)\n\nLeonid Sobolev (1985, Леонид Соболев)\n\nMikhail Sholokhov (1985, Михаил Шолохов)\n\nFrom Project 302's second series are the boats\n\nAleksey Vatchenko (1985, now Ivan Bunin)\n\nYuriy Andropov (1986, Юрий Андропов)\n\nZosima Shashkov (1986, Зосима Шашков)\n\nGeneral Vatutin (1986, Генерал Ватутин)\n\nMS Russ (1987, Русь)\n\nMS Lenin (1987, Ленин)\n\nSergey Kirov (1987, now Viking Truvor)\n\nMarshal Rybalko (1988, now Zirka Dnipra / Dnieper Princess)\n\nMarshal Koshevoy (1988, now Viking Akun)\n\nGeorgy Chicherin (1988, Георгий Чичерин)\n\nLeonid Krasin (1989, Леонид Красин)\n\nNikolay Bauman (1989, now Knyazhna Anastasia)\n\nGeneral Lavrinenkov (1990, Генерал Лавриненков)\n\nNarkom Pakhomov (1990, now Viking Ingvar)\n\nFrom Project 302's third series are the boats\n\nGleb Krzhizhanovskiy (1990, Глеб Кржижановский)\n\nMaxim Litvinov (1991, Максим Литвинов)\n\nFrom Project 302's fourth (last) series are the riverboats\n\nTaras Shevchenko (September 1991, now TG Shevchenko)\n\nKonstantin Stanyukovich (October 1991, now Princess Jeannie / Xian Ni) Regal China Cruises\n\nArkadiy Gaydar (November 1991, now Princess Sheena / Xian Na) Regal China Cruises\n\nAleksandr Grin (December 1991, now Princess Elaine / Xian Ting) Regal China Cruises\n\nVladimir Vysotsky (planned, hull built in 1996, launched in 2003 as \"Ocean Diva Original\")\n\nShare with friends\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nRSS"
