        "text": "Founded by Peter the Great in May 1703, St. Petersburg was the capital of Russia until 1918, when the administrative capital was moved to Moscow. During its rich history, St. Petersburg has been known as Petrograd (1914-1924) and Leningrad (1924-1991).\n\nRussians may tend to abbreviate the city’s name to just simply Peter, or Питер, pronounced Piter. The city is home to the Hermitage, the largest art museum in the world, and much of the city center has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. St. Petersburg is the northernmost city with a population of more than 1 million, and it is the most Western city in Russia.\n\nThe city has also been the site of some of the most defining moments of the last century, namely the 1917 Russian Revolution and the Battle of Leningrad, which lasted for 872 days between September 1941 and January 1944.\n\nYour River Cruise Ship Docks…\n\nRiver cruise ships calling on St. Petersburg typically dock deep within the city, and nowhere near the deep-ocean cruise terminal you may be familiar with if you’ve taken a mainstream cruise here. While there’s not much within walking distance of the River Cruise Terminal, there is a nearby Metro station, and most river cruise lines will offer guided excursions here.\n\nWhen in St. Petersburg…\n\nSt. Petersburg is filled with numerous sights and attractions:\n\nThe Hermitage– the largest art museum in the world, the Hermitage boasts more than 300,000 works by artists such as Rembrandt, Da Vinci, Michelangelo and many others. If entrance to this attraction isn’t included as part of your river cruise stop, be sure to purchase tickets online beforehand: not only is it cheaper, but you save yourself the hassle of standing in a long line. Be aware that an additional fee applies if you wish to bring your camera into the Hermitage.\n\nChurch of the Savior on Spilled Blood – One of the most frequently photographed structures in St. Petersburg, the Church of the Savior on Blood is an example of the beautiful architecture of Russia, with mosaic murals. Rather than being a place of worship, it exists primarily as a shrine to the assassinated Tsar Alexander II, killed in 1881 by an anarchist’s grenade as he rode in his carriage near the Winter Palace.\n\nMariinsky Theatre – a world-class theatre showcasing operatic and ballet performances, this is a must-do experience if you’re looking to truly soak in some Russian arts culture.\n\nWinter Palace – the former home of Russia’s Tzars, the Winter Palace is located along the Palace Embankment not far from the Hermitage. Definitely worth seeing.\n\nRiver Cruisers Should Know!"
