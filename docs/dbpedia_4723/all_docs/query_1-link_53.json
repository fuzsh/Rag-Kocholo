It is famous for a couple of feline workers: two cats that have become local stars.\n\nPress photos / VODOHOD Company\n\nDuring the winter the cats live in the captain’s home. It is no coincidence that his name is Vladimir Kotin (‘kot’ in Russian is ‘cat’).\n\nPress photos / VODOHOD Company\n\nThe passengers’ beloved pets are often seen sleeping in the captain’s deckhouse. Each cat has its own outfit, but Botsman mainly prefers to play with his peak cap instead of wearing it.\n\nPress photos / VODOHOD Company"
