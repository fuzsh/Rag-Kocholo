        "text": "Photo by Mateus Guimarães on Unsplash\n\nWhat can you see on a St Petersburg to Moscow cruise?\n\nTravel between St Petersburg and Moscow in style\n\nThere are many ways to travel between St Petersburg and Moscow – overnight train, high-speed Sapsan, or a quick hop on the plane. But the fastest option is not always the best, and there is so much that you can miss out on when speeding between the two capitals. A great alternative is a St Petersburg – Moscow Russian river cruise which uncovers many hidden gems along the way.\n\nAboard your river cruise you will have a front-row seat for European Russia’s most magnificent rivers and lakes – something you simply can’t experience from a plane or train. Starting from St Petersburg you will sail along the wide River Neva to its source, Lake Ladoga, the largest freshwater lake in Europe. Your journey continues along the winding River Svir, exiting in Lake Onega. From here you cruise the Volga-Baltic Waterway along the Vytegra River, through the White Lake and onto the mighty Volga – Europe’s longest river – before reaching Moscow.\n\nWith a river cruise, the highlights of your trip to Russia are not limited to the famous landmarks of St Petersburg and Moscow, but also encompass the ancient cities of the Golden Ring, the wild forests and vast lakes of Karelia, and the quaint villages which are only accessible by boat. What are the highlights of a St Petersburg - Moscow river cruise?\n\nPhoto by Tetiana SHYSHKINA on Unsplash\n\nHighlights of a St Petersburg – Moscow cruise\n\nSt Petersburg\n\nBegin your Russian adventure in the capital of Imperial Russia. St Petersburg is undoubtedly one of the world’s most beautiful cities, its historical streets basically untouched since the days of the tsars and dotted with world-renowned museums, galleries and theatres – among them the State Hermitage, Russian Museum and Mariinsky Theatre. Enjoy a White Night stroll along the waterways of the so-called Northern Venice, and head for a day trip to the suburban palaces of Peterhof or Tsarskoye Selo.\n\nShlisselburg\n\nShlisselburg is most famous for its formidable island fortress, the Oreshok Fortress, which was founded in 1323 by Prince Yuri of Muscovy, and later transformed into a prison by Peter the Great. Centuries later the fortress played a vital role during the Siege of Leningrad, as its defenders held out against the Nazis and prevented the isolation of the city from the mainland. Today, visitors can still explore the fortress’s medieval towers and dank prison cells.\n\nMandrogi\n\nPerched on the north shore of Lake Ladoga is Mandrogi, an 18th-century settlement that was rebuilt in the 1990s after being razed to the ground during WWII. Today it is more of a living museum than a live-in town, offering a window into the bygone era of a Russian peasant village. Visitors can observe artisan crafts such as wood carving, lacework and pottery, purchase unique souvenirs, and visit the Vodka Museum which contains 2,800 types of Russia’s favourite tipple!\n\nPhoto by Сергей Богатков on Unsplash\n\nValaam:\n\nValaam is an archipelago of 50 islands in northern Lake Ladoga, the largest of which is home to the 14th-century Valaam Monastery. Valaam has been a destination for religious pilgrims for hundreds of years, and its stunning architecture and landscape draw tourists to the island shores today. Dotted around the islands are several monastic communities where monks and their families reside.\n\nLodeynoe Pole\n\nOften known as the birthplace of Peter the Great’s Baltic fleet, Lodeynoe Pole was founded in 1702. Its attractions include the monument to Peter the Great and Svirskaya Svoboda Memorial Park. A few kilometres away lies the main landmark of the area – the Holy Trinity Alexander-Svirsky Monastery, founded more than 500 years ago.\n\nPhoto by Сергей Богатков on Unsplash\n\nKizhi\n\nOne of Lake Onega’s 1,650 islands, Kizhi is famous for its open-air museum showcasing the unique architecture, ethnography and history of Karelia. The jewel of Kizhi is undoubtedly the Church of the Transfiguration – a towering wooden construction crowned with 22 domes arranged in five tiers, all built without a single nail. Elsewhere on the island are the last two surviving villages of Vasilyevo and Yamka, with traditional wooden houses set against the magnificent lakeside backdrop.\n\nGoritsy\n\nGoritsy is home to the Resurrection Convent, whose 16th-19th century white stone buildings perch on the bank of the Sheksna River. The tiny settlement also serves as the access point to the 14th-century Kirillo-Belozersk Monastery. So influential did the monastery become that Ivan the Terrible had his own cell there, and it was one of 16th century Northern Russia’s religious, economic and cultural centres. Under the Soviets the monastery was turned into a labour camp, but it is today a functioning monastery.\n\nPhoto by Artem Shuba on Unsplash\n\nYaroslavl\n\nFounded in 1010 by Prince Yaroslav the Wise, Yaroslavl is one of the jewels in Russia’s Golden Ring. The city was largely destroyed by the Mongols but later rose to become Russia’s second-largest and most important city after Moscow. The highlights of this ancient city include: the Spassky Monastery with its medieval architecture and 17th-century cathedrals; the Church of Elijah the Prophet which boasts some of Russia’s richest religious art; and the Dormition Cathedral whose five golden domes dominate the skyline.\n\nMyshkin\n\nMyshkin is a quaint 19th century town which draws tourists for a rather unusual reason. The town’s name comes from a local legend of a mouse (mysh) who woke a sleeping prince just before a venomous snake bit him. Several of the town’s attractions are mice-related – such as the Mouse Museum, with its 2,000 mouse-related exhibits from all over the world. Also in the town are the Museum of Smirnoff Vodka and the Museum of Valenki (felt boots).\n\nPhoto by Joachim Pressl on Unsplash\n\nUglich\n\nFounded in 1148 as a small princedom bordering Muscovy, Uglich is a favourite place for Muscovites to visit at the weekends. It also has a fascinating history: 10-year-old Prince Dmitry, Ivan the Terrible’s last heir, died here in mysterious circumstances. The townspeople rang the Uglich Bell to summon an uprising, prompting Ivan to exile the bell to Siberia along with the local people. The bell was ‘pardoned’ in 1892 and returned to Uglich, where it hangs in the Church of Demetrius (built on the spot of the prince’s death) inside the Uglich Kremlin.\n\nMoscow\n\nThe last stop on the St Peterburg – Moscow cruise is the capital city of Russia. Playing a key role in global history and culture since the 12th century, Moscow is packed with world-class landmarks like the Moscow Kremlin, St Basil’s Cathedral, Tretyakov Gallery and Bolshoi Theatre. Lovers of luxury can browse the designer stores of GUM and dine in the clouds atop Moscow City’s skyscrapers. Otherwise, a stroll along Moscow’s grand boulevards and impressive Soviet-era parks is a great way to spend the summer days.\n\nPlease take note that not all stops are included in all tours.
