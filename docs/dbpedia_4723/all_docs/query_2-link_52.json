        "text": "Sitronics Group 02 June 2023 15:25\n\nThe passenger double-deck electric catamaran \"Ekohod 2\" was presented to the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation Denis Manturov and the Governor of the Nizhny Novgorod region Gleb Nikitin by the president of Sitronics Group Nikolay Pozhidaev and the general director of the cruise company \"Vodohod\" Rishat Bagautdinov. The 130-passenger vessel was built at the Imperium shipyard (part of the Sitronics Group) and delivered to Nizhny Novgorod the day before.\n\nThe vessel was built at the Imperium shipyard in the Leningrad region by order of the largest shipping company and tourist operator. This summer, walking routes along the Volga River for residents and guests of the city will begin to take place on an electric catamaran called \"Ecohod 2\".\n\nThe passenger vessel has two decks, a length of 31 meters and accommodates 114 passengers in the main cabin, and 16 in the high-comfort cabin in the bow of the vessel. The cabin of the vessel can be completely transformed and allows you to create any seating for guests, organize a zone for a photo shoot and even a stage for events. The electric catamaran moves on electric traction and rechargeable batteries, which makes its operation almost silent.\n\n\"We are creating a completely new approach to passenger water transport, we are confident that the future belongs to electric vessels, since energy efficiency is a priority today. They are economical to maintain and environmentally friendly due to the absence of exhaust gases and noise. The modern design of the vessel combines functionality and ergonomics, as well as an attractive appearance. Many Russian cities are developing river tourism and embed ships in their transport system. The electric vessels produced by us are designed to make water routes and walks convenient and pleasant for tourists and residents,\" said Nikolay Pozhidaev, President of Sitronics Group.\n\nThe electric vessels of the Ecocruiser model are easy to maintain. Thus, the battery system is built on a modular principle on quick-release connections, which allows you to quickly remove battery and control modules for diagnostics or maintenance.\n\n\"The launch of a modern electric catamaran on walking routes in the Volga water area became possible thanks to the successful cooperation of regional authorities, private business and state support. This project is an important step towards the renewal of the fleet and the development of the tourist infrastructure of the region,\" said Rishat Bagautdinov, General Director of Vodohod.\n\nThe Emperium shipyard was the first in Russia to launch mass production of electric vessels. The company develops and builds vessels of different navigation classes with a capacity of 50 to 200 passengers on board. There are several types of vessels in the line: Ecobus river trams, single-deck and double-deck Ecovolt and Ecocruiser cruises, other models are being developed.\n\nPlease note that this press release is based on materials provided by the company.
