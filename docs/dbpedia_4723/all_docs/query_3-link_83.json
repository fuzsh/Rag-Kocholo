        "text": "In this article, Chic Icon offers a comprehensive list of our favorite top-of-the-line luxurious and scenic cruises from around the globe. Listlessly drifting along the water on an all-inclusive cruise ship is sure to bring zen to even the most overworked personalities. Not only do these water-bound villas pass by some of the most picturesque locations from Scandinavia to Asia, but award-winning chefs and renowned entertainers are also stationed aboard to top off the luxury experience. Each cruise line has distinctive qualities that have captivated guests and propelled their status and popularity in high society.\n\nThe Oberoi Luxury Nile Cruises – Egypt\n\nOur first adventure takes us to Northeast Africa and sets us afloat upon of the most famous rivers in the world – the Nile. Commonly known as the world’s longest river, the Nile flows through Egypt and Sudan with its mouth opening at the Mediterranean Sea. Due to the river’s historical significance in Ancient Egypt, most cultural and heritage sites are located along the water’s banks, making this scenic cruise a top priority for tourists and history buffs alike.\n\nThe Oberoi Group was founded in 1934 and currently operates in seven countries with over thirty hotels and Nile Cruisers, among a plethora of other luxury sectors including flight catering, car rental, corporate air charters, and more. The Group’s main operational philosophy is to please any seeker of high-class hospitality – the guest is everything.\n\nThe elite experience that Oberoi has cultivated on their cruise lines and in their hotels has skyrocketed their popularity among the jet-setters around the world. On-board entertainment such as traditional dance and musical performances keep guests occupied while gliding at a leisurely pace along the Nile. English- speaking Egyptologists are readily available on board to chronologize events and provide answers to daunting questions about the surrounding landscape. Oberoi also arranges for small coaches with audio-visual presentations to optimize the all-inclusive luxury experience and detail the landmarks along the way.\n\nHighlights from the trip include grandstanding monuments, temples, centuries-old tombs and temples, and old Ancient-Egyptian ruins that will leave viewers incredulous. If you haven’t yet visited the Nile – this is your sign!\n\nTrip packages range from 3-4 days to 7-8 days depending on how many locations are visited – we highly recommend the 7 nights / 8 days itinerary to get the full experience – and embark year-round from either Luxor or Aswan – both of which are easily accessible from Cairo and other cities in the Middle East and Europe.

Featuring a modern Scandinavian-inspired design to provide unobstructed views of oceans of open space, Swan Hellenic operates all around the world and even in remote Polar regions – one of a few popular destinations are Antarctica, Papua New Guinea, and West Africa.\n\nUnderstated elegance accented with a spacious informal design perfectly culminates in creating what Swan Hellenic calls “Scandi-luxe”. Our selected choice from Swan Hellenic takes us to the northernmost parts of the world off the coast of Iceland’s capital city, Reykjavik – in which nearly a third of the country’s population lives – and we slowly coast north to Eastern Greenland before returning to circumnavigate the history-rich Nordic island nation.\n\nThis tour begins in the bustling town of Reykjavik, home to awe-inspiring geothermal baths, natural rock formations, and stunning destinations such as a pipe-organ-shaped church Hallgrimskirkja and the transformative Blue Lagoon spa. The cruise line then heads northwest to the country’s Westfjords region – which is famous for its iconic landscapes – and docks in the charming fishing village of Ísafjördur. After a bit of sightseeing and birdwatching, guests hop back on the cruise ship and spend the next few days discovering the world’s largest fjord network, Scorebysund.\n\nMeander through these fjords – narrow inlets created by submerged glaciers – surrounded by towering mountain ranges and take in the fresh breeze while scoping out the native wildlife such as Atlantic puffins, muskoxen, and snowy owls – you would be fortunate to stumble upon Greenlandic gyrfalcon!\n\nAlong the way, guests will visit Ittoqqortoormiit – one of the most remote towns in the world – the King Oscar Fjord, cultural hubs such as Seyðisfjörður, Höfn, and Heimaey – all of which carry a unique aspect of Scandinavian history. A final docking point for the cruise ship leaves patrons back in the capital city to enjoy day trips or shopping experiences.\n\nThe Arctic coverage of this Swan Hellenic cruise cannot be described in words or depicted well enough in photographs to emulate the sheer beauty of the landscape. Book HERE\n\nMoscow to St. Petersburg: 5-star Cruise by Vodohod – Russia\n\nOne of the two cruises from Vodohod on our list (you can tell we have high praise for them) treats guests to an 8-day voyage on board the ultimate luxury cruise liner, the Mustai Karim. Taking a more classical route, this cruise emphasizes accommodation and comfort while still offering extensive visits to iconic cities and historic sites in the area. The excursion shuttles clients from Russia’s capital city Moscow to the country’s cultural hub and second-largest city, Saint Petersburg, and makes a few stops along the way to highlight the magnificent landscape and diversity that the country has to offer.\n\nThe tour’s first day is spent outlining the riveting history of Moscow, Russia’s political and financial capital and Europe’s largest city. Tranquility abounds throughout the next four days, as the Mustai Karim floats by timeworn islands and battered buildings that offer a glimpse of post-classical and modern history. Destinations include the beloved Old Russia town of Uglich, founded in 1148, the trade-centered settlement Goritsy, and the island of Kizhi, located on the northern end of Lake Onega, famous for its elaborate wooden architecture. One of the final stops of the expedition lets guests explore the quaint village of Mandrogui, which acts as more of a living museum than a live-in village.\n\nAll these stops have their own distinct history, from showcasing the power struggles within the Russian kingdom – the czars, emperors, and clerical figures – to the Vodka Museum with over 2,800 types of international flavors, a tribute to traditional Russian pleasures.\n\nThe arrival in St. Petersburg will leave you well-rested and ready for a cocktail. City tour of St Petersburg is not included to the program but we encourage you to organize something by yourself as the city is well-known as the most beautiful city of Russia.\n\nThese memories will last a lifetime, along with the friends you make aboard the cruise line – so be sure to indulge heartily and catalog your travels well! Book HERE\n\nYenisey Expedition Cruise with Vodohod – Russia\n\nThe final and most authentic cruise on our list is Vodohod’s Yenisei River cruise. Treading through expanses of taiga and natural landscapes, UNESCO-protected zones, indigenous settlements, and abandoned Gulag construction sites may not sound “chic” to the swankiest of adventurers, but the undisputed leader in the Russian cruise industry has found a way to make it luxe. Top-notch cuisine and familiar modern European design will keep you satiated as you unearth authentic Siberia through undiscovered regions and unshared waters on this 12-day expedition cruise on the board Maxim Gorky.\n\nMaxim Gorky is one of the newest vessels of Vodohod. It is a 5-star river cruise featuring expedition adventures, spa treatments, and award-winning chefs. If you’re craving some Russian delights, black caviar, or local fish, it can be found on the dinner menu.\n\nWhether you enjoy a helicopter tour over the Plateau Putorana or simply spend the day fishing in Bakhta, this adventure will not leave you without a refined palette, remarkable experiences, and a treasure trove of distinct memories.\n\nSetting sail from Dudinka – one of the largest ports in Siberia – and making its way down Krasnoyarsk, Vodohod takes meticulous care in setting stops for the journey. Strong relationships with local tribes and proprietary routes allow a complete experience with unspoiled nature, historical rarities, and protected forests hosting animals in their natural habitat. Sights such as the technologically reluctant “Old Believer’s Village” and the remains of Stalin’s “Dead Road Railway” await the most intrepid guests. This trip is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to check off your bucket list. Book HERE\n\nAnd there you have it! Make sure to dress appropriately and prepare yourself for your serene maritime resort. One final word of advice – don’t forget to pack your camera and take pictures – you will want to memorialize your trip for generations to come."
