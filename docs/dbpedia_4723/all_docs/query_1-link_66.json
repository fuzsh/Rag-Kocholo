        "text": "Irkutsk is a beautiful Siberian city, founded in the 17th century on the banks of the Angara River.\n\nIrkutsk is a beautiful Siberian city, founded in the 17th century on the banks of the Angara River. Thanks to its good location at the crossroads of trade routes that connect Europe and Asia, Irkutsk quickly became the key city in Eastern Siberia. The Great Tea Road, which carried furs to China and tea, silk, and sugar back, used to pass here. When the \"gold rush\" began in Siberia, Irkutsk bore the title of a gold mining capital - ingots of gold and gold sand flocked here for sale.\n\nNowadays, you can see the greatness and wealth of that merchant Irkutsk, while walking along the embankments, squares and streets of this city. During your city tour, you will walk along the Lower embankment to the Moscow Gate, walk down the streets of Irkutsk Merchant Suburb.\n\nBreakfast at the hotel. Check-out from the hotel with luggage.\n\nIrkutsk bus sightseeing tour (2 hours).\n\nOgoy is the largest island in the Maloe More strait of Lake Baikal.\n\nThe whole day will be dedicated to the sights of the Maloye More (the Small Sea). Local nature is no less impressive and fascinating – your photo hunt will be really successful!\n\nThere is a small, uninhabited island in Baikal in the Maloye More (the Small Sea) Strait, and it is called Ogoy. The word \"Ogoy\" comes from the Buryat word, which means \"waterless\". The length of the island is 2,9 km, and the width is 0,6 km. It is the largest island in the strait between Olkhon Island and the mainland. About a hundred herring gulls nest on the Ogoy Island. There is also an endemic species of vole – the Olkhon vole. The local relict grasses are included in the Red Book. The island has never been inhabited by people, and this has helped preserve unique species of wildlife.\n\nIn 2005, a Buddhist stupa or Stupa of Enlightenment was erected on the highest point of the island. The snow-white, three-story structure with a dome and spire became a new symbol of the island. The shape of the island resembles the outlines of a dancing Dakini, where the head and body are clearly visible, and in the heart area of the goddess is a stupa. The Enlightenment Stupa is the main of the eight types of stupas in Buddhism because it symbolizes the main goal of Buddhism: enlightenment.\n\nBreakfast at the recreation centre.\n\nDeparture for the excursion program:\n\nHovercraft transfer to the Ogoy Island.\n\nWalking tour around the Ogoy Island, visit to the Stupa of Enlightenment.\n\n​One of the most mysterious and popular places on Lake Baikal is the Shaman Rock (The Burkhan Cape).\n\nOne of the most mysterious and popular places on Lake Baikal is the Cape Burhan (also known as the Shaman Rock).\n\nThe name \"Burhan\" appeared at the end of the 17th century after Tibetan Buddhism came to the Baikal region. The Buryat Buddhists began to call the main deity of Lake Baikal by the word \"Burhan\". The cape is made of crystalline limestone with veins of quartz, and the adjacent shore is made of granite rock. The rock is covered with bright red lichens. The height of the near shore part of the rock is 30 meters, the height of the far part is 42 meters.\n\nHovercraft transfer to the Cape Burhan.\n\nVisit to the Shaman Rock.\n\nLunch at the Port Olkhon Café.\n\nHovercraft transfer to the recreation centre.\n\nFree time*.\n\nDinner at the recreation centre.\n\n*Russian sauna service or ice-skating (extra charge).\n\nThe Chivyrkuisky bay is located on the east coast of Lake Baikal.\n\nIn winter, the Chivyrkuisky bay is one of the first to freeze over. It is just in winter that you have a unique opportunity to see the incredibly beautiful icy rocks of Baikal and to breathe in the freshest frosty air. In one of the wind-protected cosy places we'll have a picnic in the best Siberian traditions - with freshly caught omul, lingonberries and hot herbal tea. Right on the shore of the bay there are famous thermal springs in Baikal. Their temperature is about +40°C to +45°C. The water is hydrogen sulphide, has healing properties and is used for diseases of the musculoskeletal system.\n\nDeparture for the excursion program:\n\nWalking tour with the visit to the ice caves.\n\nVisit to the hot springs in Zmeinaya bay.\n\nLunch.\n\nYou will also meet the locals of Tarbagatai, one of the largest Old Believers' settlements in Transbaikalia. It will be a real journey down the history lane.\n\nIn the 17th century, Russian Orthodoxy after the Reformation split into the official and Old Believer branches. Old Believers did not want to accept the new rules, they were persecuted and exiled away from the capital cities. This is why so many adherents of the old faith have survived in Siberia and still live by the laws and traditions of their ancestors. The culture of the Old Believers is recognised by UNESCO as part of the World Cultural Heritage.\n\nYou will also meet the locals of Tarbagatai, one of the largest Old Believers' settlements in Transbaikalia. It will be a real journey down the history lane. You will visit the Old Believers' Museum and the Old Orthodox Church, get acquainted with the rites, customs, unique polyphonic singing and the Old Russian cuisine. You will get acquainted with Old Believers' folklore culture, visit the Museum of Old Believers' Culture and Life and the Old Orthodox Church.\n\nDeparture for the excursion programme in the Tarbagatai Old Believers' village (5 hours):\n\nVisit to the Museum of History, Culture and Life of Old Believers.\n\nVisit to the St. Nicholas temple of the Russian Orthodox Church.\n\nLunch (dishes based on ancient recipes of local Old Believers in one of the most beautiful villages in the country).\n\nDinner at the hotel."
