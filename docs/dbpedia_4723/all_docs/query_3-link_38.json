        "text": "The German states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland form one of the country's most beautiful regions, famous for its vineyards and offering visitors the special features of the many villages along the Saar and Moselle rivers. The river Saar flows through the regions of Alsace, Lorraine and the German state of Saarland into the Moselle, while the Moselle runs some 200 kilometres from Trier to its mouth on the Rhine. They navigate vine-lined hillsides with a meandering, looping course that offers spectacular scenery at every turn, and horseshoe bends as impressive as the one at Leiwen. The stately atmosphere of Boppard, a hiking tour of Cochem and its castle, a visit to the Gutenberg Museum or a stroll through the Rhine vineyards are just some of the activities on offer on these tributaries of the Rhine.\n\nOn the eastern side of the Rhine, the river Main is one of its main tributaries and connects the river with the Danube, through its 524km navigable, and crosses the Franconia region, which is located at the confluence of the states of Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg and Hesse, known for its thick forests and emblematic routes of castles and fortresses.\n\nTravel by river cruise to discover new and unexpected places and discover cities such as Strasbourg, Mainz or Cochem. Cruise down the Main to the heart of Frankfurt, home to the European Central Bank, Goethe's house museum and Römerberg Square, the city's most beautiful square and its main icon.\n\nThe Neckar is a river that flows through the German state of Baden-Württemberg and rises in the Black Forest, very close to the sources of the Danube. After 367km through forests and charming villages, it flows into the river Rhine at the city of Mannheim, named after the Celtic word Nikros, which means rough water, but its navigation is very pleasant along its valley, where you can see a variety of natural landscapes and castles. A beautiful and charming city to visit is Heidelberg, with an impressive castle full of legends.\n\nFrom Strasbourg to Remich, sail along 4 rivers and discover the beauty of the romantic Rhine valley, the Neckar, the Moselle and the Saar and their cultural and historical attractions."
