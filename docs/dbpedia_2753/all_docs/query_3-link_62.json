        "text": "Rita Hayworth dazzles in this new 4K restoration of Charles Vidor’s noir classic, Gilda. This was Hayworth’s first major dramatic role with Columbia opposite everyman Glenn Ford as crooked gambler Johnny Farrell. Ford was making his return to the screen after a four-year stint with the US Marine Corps during WWII.\n\nDeveloped with Hayworth in mind by the legendary “Queen of Columbia” Virginia Van Upp, who worked at the studio as a producer after a long career as a screenwriter, this Buenos Aires–set story of gambling, romance, infidelity, and revenge contains one of the most famous character introductions in the history of cinema."
