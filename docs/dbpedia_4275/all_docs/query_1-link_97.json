To the editor: I have read the Spring 1992 copy of Yale Medicine, and in particular, the article on the humanitarian service of Drs. Gaudio and Kini. Credit was given to Alcon Labs and Johnson & Johnson for their donation of supplies. On Page 6, mention was given to the treatment of river blindness by oral ivermectin. To be even-handed, Merck & Co. gave ivermectin to areas in Africa and ■elsewhere, where this disease was preva¬ lent. You did not credit Merck. Thank you for your attention. ! Elizabeth Tishler Middletown, Conn. 1 'Editor’s reply: The cited article, “ The ■ Gift of Sight: India ’s Cataract Camps, ” | dealt only with the authors ' experience in ' Mangalore, India, and in no way was meant to slight the many humanitarian \\ contributions that a wide array of Ameri¬ can pharmaceutical companies make \\ worldwide. For the record. Dr. Gaudio informs us that Merck & Co. did not do¬ nate medicines to the Mangalore cataract camp. More on Wilbur Downs To the editor: Upon receiving the Spring 1992 Yale Medicine, you can imagine how I was “blown away” by the tribute to my father, Wilbur G. Downs, M.D. He and I were fortunate enough to become good friends and mutual admirers and irascible fishing partners before he died, peacefully, last year. I thought Marty Gordon and Herb Sacks did very good jobs describing my dad’s talents, and will of course be writing them to thank them. Drs. Sack and Gordon offered up many more compliments than my father would or could tolerate, and I will not add any more, but rather will repeat Dr. Sacks’ most key sentence: “Wilbur Downs had a great capacity to approach people unthreateningly, with warmth and gentleness.” This capacity was based on profound, non-discrimi¬ nating respect and interest. It was quite inspiring to witness, pertaining, as it did, even in the most random situations such as airplane-seating arrangements. It was not unusual for him to disembark from an airplane with a new address in hand, establishing life-long written contact. Also, Tom Mcguane, in his Esquire article (October 1991), wrote a beauti¬ ful sentence that could be my father’s epitaph (or that of any helplessly ad¬ dicted naturalist): “He rhapsodized the burgeoning life that he saw.” Sadness played a key role in my father’s life, both professionally and per¬ sonally, and my observation was that he learned at least as much from it as he did from his joys or successes or achievements. Dr. Sacks’ article hinted at the professional sadness when he noted that their (his and my father’s) $6-million proposal for the Senegal Health Project was turned down. In¬ deed, my father witnessed a steady and major decline in funding (and other) support for most international health projects over the last three decades. And of course he concurrently and with sad¬ ness witnessed a resurgence of malaria, kala azar. Rift Valley fever, and many other communicable and preventable diseases (some devastating, and some apparently new, like AIDS) to Dark Age proportions. His prayer was to immediately have every penny taken from the defense bud¬ get, to be put into support programs for the famine-ravaged and disease-infested children who seemingly have no chance at the kind of life we try to provide for our own children. He once told me that he was inca¬ pable of standing around (much less sitting in lotus position) enjoying a glo¬ rious sunset. I later came to understand what he meant, namely that his fascina¬ tion was in what insects (or fish, or birds or people) might be appearing or disap¬ pearing during that climactic period of the day. Nevertheless I saw him, on more than one occasion, sneak a glance at the glorious sky and enjoy a deep breath even as he so intently and invol¬ untarily focused on life here on Earth. Similarly, he was not unaware of the inevitability of his own sunset, and of the forces and questions that surrounded it. But “rhapsodizing the burgeoning life on earth” was his love and his glory, and his way, as Dylan Thomas put it, of “singing in his chains like the sea.” Thank you for the excellent edition, which is an enormous honor and remem¬ brance for me and for my family. Mont}' Downs, M.D. '70 Lihue, Hawaii Senatorial Salute To the editor: I recently received a copy of the article in the summer edition of Yale Medicine about the cooperative venture between the veterans medical center at West Ha¬ ven and the Yale School of Medicine. While I was aware of the cooperation between the two institutions, I did not realize how close the association was — nor how mutually beneficial. Clearly the $90 million earmarked for capital improvement at West Haven will facili¬ tate the partnership between YSM and the veterans facility and will leverage an enormous dividend in improved patient care and expanded biomedical research. Thank you for a fine article. I am looking forward to continuing accounts of this fruitful partnership. Christopher J. Dodd United States Senator ( Conn.) Washington, D.C. Yale Medicine FallAVinter 1992-93 Fetal Rights To the editor: I have taken the liberty to add a footnote to the Yale University School of Medi¬ cine Human Relations Code of Conduct featured on Page 37 of the Spring 1992 edition of Yale Medicine: Respect for the dignity and worth of each individual ensures that Yale is free from intolerance based on age or physi¬ cal handicap. This makes certain that no unborn child will be aborted because of his sex, physical condition, genetic make-up, or even just because he is “un¬ wanted. ” (“Life Begins at Fertilization”: Brad¬ ley Patten. Jerome Lejeune, Isaac Azimov, Paul Weiss, Thomas Hilgers, A. E. A. Scheinfeld, B. Heffernan, etc.) Paul Bruch, M.D. '51 President, Conn. Right to Life Corp. Soutlibury, Conn. Editor's reply: Our human relations code of conduct is meant to encourage mutual respect among students, faculty and patients. This includes respect for differing points of view without pre¬ judging their intent and without imposing one ’s own opinions on others. The code encourages freedom of expression and respect for the dignity > and rights of individuals. In fact, it is in this spirit that we publish Dr. Bruch 's letter. Military Women To the editor: I have just finished reading the article by Linda Spoonster Schwartz, “Our Un¬ known Veterans Emerge from the Shad¬ ows” (Summer 1992), and wish to com¬ ment on her statement that “in the late 1970s women doctors began to serve in military hospitals.” I was a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Medical Corps Reserves, and while on active duty served in the military hos¬ pitals in Fort Devens. Mass., and Fort Drum, N.Y.. in the 1960s. In addition to the monument dedi¬ cated to military women that is to be constructed at the entrance to Arlington National Cemetery, the Association of Military Women is also requesting pho¬ tographs, uniforms, memorabilia, etc., for a museum to be devoted to women in the military. I personally had the privilege of pre¬ senting a sabre (in honor of my late hus¬ band Col. Ronald B. Stevens U.S.A.F.) to two women in the A.F.R.O.T.C. at the University of Connecticut for their outstanding academic and military ex¬ cellence in the early 1970s. Both are now captains in the Air Force. One is a pilot who flies the larg¬ est Air Force transport plane, and the other is in N.O.R.D. So women are on their way as they were when 1 was in medical school. Sophie Trent, M.D. '43 Meriden, Conn. Social Challenges To the editor: I liked your editorial, \"A New Dean, A New Dawn.\" in the Summer 1992 issue of Yale Medicine. 1 hope you will con¬ tinue to follow that line you enunciated, helping students, faculty and alumni to face the challenges of change. There is a tendency in house organs to soften and blur the outlines of the problematic di¬ mensions of the institution's mission. Yale School of Medicine has a rich tra¬ dition of responding to social challenges. Social medicine once had a foothold here and it would be valuable for that view¬ point to return. You've touched on international and military issues recently. Perhaps it is time to reflect on Yale's response to today’s social and economic challenges. Thanks again for your very forthright editorial. George A. Silver, M.D. Professor emeritus of public health Tribute to a Friend To the editor: It is with deep sadness that I write that Mr. Leonard Berger of Atlanta, Ga., died suddenly on April 16, 1992, of an acute myocardial infarction, at the young age of 65. Lenny was a longtime friend of the Child Study Center and a personal friend of many members of the faculty. In the middle 1970s, he established the Berger Fellowship program for support of research concerning autism and asso¬ ciated disorders. The Berger Fellow¬ ships have provided support for over 20 fellows from the United States, Europe. Asia and Israel who have become lead¬ ers in the field. Fenny took an active, enthusiastic interest in the work of the center, in the Berger Fellows and in ad¬ vances in scientific research. He was a remarkably devoted father, wonderful husband, and beloved friend. Mrs. Gloria Berger can be written to at 1585 Wesley Parkway, Atlanta. GA 30339. The center will continue to provide Leonard Berger Fellowships in his memory. He will be deeply missed. Donald J. Cohen, M.D. Director Yale Child Study Center Bravo, Dr. Sphar To the editor: I am writing to applaud your providing Capt. Ray Sphar space in the Summer 1 992 edition of Yale Medicine. He truly made a great contribution to his profes¬ sion and to his country. I can personally attest to Ray as an outstanding Navy medical officer. My career ended with my retirement in October 1990 with many fond memo¬ ries and great personal satisfaction. William M. Nan’a Rear Admiral, Marine Corps (ret.) Washington, D.C. Cushing Correction I To the editor: In the Summer 1992 Yale Medicine, on Page 33, it states that Harvey Cushing was professor of neurosurgery at Yale. Although offered that title, he refused because of ill health. He was then named Sterling Professor of Neurology. W.G. Cooper, M.D. '37 Little Rock, Ark. 7 Yale Medicine FallAVinter 1992-93 A Special Bond 1 by Gerard N. Burrow , M.D. I am delighted to welcome you, the entering Class of 1996. You are a very special class to me because I am entering also, although as dean, and we will go through the next four years together. I have a slight edge because I have been through this process once already. Thirty-eight years ago I sat in your place and with a certain level of anxiety and apprehension listened to the inspirational words of Dean Vernon Lippard. Now it’s my turn to provide some inspiration with a minimum of perspiration. Medicine is not a trade to be learned blit a profession to be entered. It is an ever-widening field that requires continued study and prolonged experience in close contact with the sick. All that the medical school can hope to do is to supply the foundations on which to build. When one considers the amazing progress of science in its relation to medicine in the last 30 years, and the enormous mass of scientific material which must be made available to the modern physician, it is not surprising that the schools have tended to concern them¬ selves more and more with this phase of the educational problem. And while we have been absorbed in the difficult task of digesting and correlating new knowledge, it has been easy to overlook the fact that the application of principles of science to diagnosis and treatment of disease is only one limited aspect of medical practice. The practice of medicine in its broadest sense includes the whole relationship of the physician with his patient. It is an art, based to an increasing extent on the medical sciences, but comprising much that still remains outside the realm of any science. The art of medicine and the science of medicine are not antagonistic but supplementary to each other. There is no more contradiction between the science of medicine and the art of medicine than between the science of aeronautics and the art of flying. Good practice presupposes an under¬ standing of the sciences which contribute to the structure of modern medicine, but it is obvious that sound professional training should include a much broader equipment. Interestingly, these are not my inspirational words but rather were delivered in 1927 by Dr. Francis W. Peabody, in a talk to Harvard medical students. Amazingly, 65 years later the words are perhaps even more applicable. Even though Peabody’s words remain cogent, the medical world you are entering is very different from the one in which I found myself. In 1954, when I entered Yale School of Medicine, polio and smallpox were rampant. No one had heard of AIDS. Dean Gerard N. Burrow delivered this address to incoming Yale medical students on Sept. 10. Dr. Gerard N. Burrow also welcomed first-year medical students at this year's inaugural white coat ceremony on September 9. (See Student News, Page 37.) Watson and Crick had just unveiled the double helix. Medicare and Medicaid had not been promulgated, and physicians will¬ ingly devoted free care a half day or more a week. You are entering medicine in what is truly the best of times and the worst of times. Medicine goes through periods of quiescence punctuated by an advance that fundamentally changes how medicine is practiced. The invention of the X-ray, the introduc¬ tion of antibiotics, the ability to bank blood all changed the practice of medicine. Today, advances in cellular and molecular biology are causing a revolution in clinical medicine. We now understand what causes certain kinds of cancer. We are able to genetically engineer medically important proteins. At the same time there are 35 million Americans without health insurance. Fully one-half of the children in inner cities have not been immunized. Everyone is unhappy with our health care system. You will be reaching the peak of your medical careers in the year 2010. Our role is to educate you to deal with medicine in the 21st century when the changes will be far greater than between when I entered and when you entered. I did not leave Southern California because of the weather, or the quality of the Yale football team. I came back because I believe in the Yale system of medical education, which treats the student as an adult and lets her or him learn at an individual pace, with support when and where it’s needed. I can’ t think of anything more satisfying than to be a physician. We are here to help you become the leaders of American medicine in the first part of the 21st century. YM Yale Medicine FallAVinter 1992-93 3 Harry Bishop YM Interview: Gerard N. Burrow, M.D Welcome back to the School of Medicine, Dr. Burrow. How does it feel to be back? It’s enormously exciting. You know, Thomas Wolfe wrote that you can't go home again. I don't think that’s true; in a sense you never leave. There's something very special about Yale. I’ve been reacquainting myself with some of the people I served with on the house staff. And it's wonderful, the letters I’ve gotten from classmates, former house staff, graduate students that I taught as I went through my early career here. What have been your first impressions? In one sense, how little things have changed. And in another sense, how much they’ve changed. In April, when we had the press conference at Harkness auditorium to announce my ap¬ pointment, it was incredible to look out in the audience. I think I knew half of the people there. Some were people who had taught me as a first-year medical student. Ed Crelin taught my anatomy class and sent me a copy of a book he had written. John McLean Morris was there. It really took me back. What differences seem most striking? There are a lot more buildings. The number of students has increased somewhat, but especially the faculty. I think one of the truly exciting things about Yale is the breadth and the depth of the medical school and the University communities, and how well they relate to one another. Any surprises? Well, I was surprised to see my name on the door. For 22 years, it was always somebody else’s name, and serving as dean had not been something that I'd thought about doing. The big difference I see between San Diego and Yale is that in San Diego the sun goes into the ocean, and here it comes out of the ocean, but the problems are the same. Before commenting further on the problems, what do you see as our strengths at the School of Medicine? I think there are some very good medical schools across the country, but there really are very, very few that have the number of extraordinary individuals, both in the medical school and the On August 21, Gregor y R. Huth and Rosalind D' Eugenio interviewed Dean Gerard N. Burrow. Mr. Huth is publications editor and Ms. D' Eugenio is media specialist at the School of Medicine’s Office of Public Information. main campus, as we do at Yale. Programmatically, we have enormous basic science strength at a time when science has never been more exciting. Our particular strength is in areas such as oncology, neuroscience, structural biology and genetics, areas that are really exploding with discovery. We boast a very good hospital, a strong clinical program, and the opportunity to build a bridge between the basic sciences and clinical care. And what are the school's major challenges? In the short term, and perhaps in the long term, we have to look at what’s going to happen with the U.S. health care system. Managed care is going to increase, and I think academic health centers are particularly ill-suited to practice in the kind of medicine that I see coming. Why is that? Take California as an example. In the five-year period that I was there, San Diego had 30 hospitals, which are collapsing into four channeled, managed systems of health care. By 1996, an esti¬ mated 70 to 80 percent of San Diegans will be in managed care. With channeled, managed care, if you're in one system, unless you are willing to pay the total cost, you can't be referred for care outside the system. So to be a part of the managed care system, which a university needs to do for medical education, you probably need access to 200,000 lives. To train residents inter¬ ested in doing surgery on the base of the skull, you probably need access to 400,000 lives. By and large medical schools do very well in specialized care, but to deliver primary care to huge numbers of people is not one of the things we’re designed for. Fortunately, Yale-New Haven Hospital does have a community practice. One of my goals, for the short term and the long term, is to build and solidify the bridges between University physicians and community physi¬ cians. Both groups face the same issues. The closer that we can get together, the better it will be. So you 'll emphasize closer ties with the New Haven community. New Haven is the city where redevelopment started in the United States. More recently, national policy with regard to cities seems to be going in the wrong direction, and I think that’s obviously unacceptable. In the long term, for the School of Medicine to be successful, the city has to be successful. One of New Haven's advantages is that it’s not a vast area like Los Angeles or New York, and I think that it’s possible to help. Although the University cannot solve the social ills of New Haven, I think it can use its academic strength to help solve those ills. 4 Yale Medicine Fall/Winter 1992-93 Have you been particularly impressed with any current town- gown programs ? For one. the needle exchange program. It's a wonderful example of the way that the University can contribute to the social well¬ being of the city. Also, the program that Jim Comer is directing to help strengthen the public schools, and the Child Study Center program working with children exposed to violence. These are perfect examples of using an academic approach to solve difficult social problems, and I think we need to do more of it. Will the department of epidemiology and public health (EPH) play a role in this approach? There's no question. I mean, the societal issues are not so much the care of individuals as the care of populations. The strength of EPH is that it is already playing that role. Another example of Yale’ s breadth and the depth is that EPH, the Forestry School, and the Center for International and Area Studies are cooperating in Brazil. This is not our local community, but again, it's melding the different schools in an important way. Could we return to your encouraging cooperation between the bench and the bedside ? Would you cite any current efforts at the school as a good example ? I think Lyme disease is a perfect example of a disease that was identified and described here at Y ale, the agent identified, and the treatment for the disease pursued. Now that the development of a vaccine is on the horizon, we’re successfully moving biotech¬ nology to the bedside. We need to be doing more of that. What's your perception about clinical care at the school? I think it’s been strong. I think that in order to become perhaps the premier medical academic institution in the country, we need to have a clinical program that’s as strong as our basic research program. We’ll start by building on areas in which we are really at the very forefront — transplantation, gene therapy — which again, feeds back on the basic science strength that we have already. Would you comment in more detail about the prospect of gene therapy at Yale? Gene therapy is clearly on the horizon, and we have the strength here to become leaders in this emerging field. We’ve had some meetings about setting up an active program; it would probably first happen in oncology and then develop from there. That’ s one program that I’d like to focus on right away. Could you provide some background about gene therapy for our readers who may not be conversant with this concept? Dr. Gerard N. Burrow in his Sterling Hall of Medicine office. Turning to our physical plant, do you see any major new construction happening during the next few years? Yes. We're now drawing up plans for a new Center for the Study of Human Disease. We still need to secure funding. Perhaps our most pressing need is expanded space for laboratory research, and this center will help us address that need. Which laboratories would be located in the new building? Programs from the department of internal medicine, which are probably under the greatest stress in terms of space. As in the Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine, the new building would encourage an interdepartmental approach to diseases such as diabetes mellitus or heart disease, and would bring together investigators from a number of disciplines. As departmental boundaries blur and research becomes more programmatic, our challenge is to foster interdepartmental research collaboration while allowing individuals to feel as if they have a home. You 've had extensive experience in the Canadian health care system and taught in Canada. From that perspective, would you comment on our struggles in the United States to reform our own health care system? Take, for example, a gene that makes a substance that could destroy a tumor cell. Insert that gene either directly into the tumor or into the bone marrow so that you’re really doing something to directly destroy the tumor without poisoning all cells, which is the price some patients now have to pay for life-saving cancer treatments. After being in Canada for almost 1 3 years and then returning to San Diego, I really felt like Rip Van Winkle. The American medical care system I left bore no resemblance to the one to which I came back. I returned to a system in which 10 percent of the women who delivered at the university hospital in San Diego had no prenatal care. Many of these were the working poor, that is, Yale Medicine Fall/Winter 1992-93 5 Photographs by Janies Anderson they made too much money to qualify for Medicaid hut didn't feel they had enough money to pay for prenatal care. These women had a four-times higher incidence of low birth-weight babies, babies which ended up in an intensive care unit at $3,000 a day. With no medical insurance, these mothers very quickly qualified for Medicaid. At the same time, at a hospital in La Jolla, the Caesarean section rate of fee-for-service patients was 36 percent, which is almost twice the national average. It’s what Alain Enthoven, the Stanford health economist, has called “the paradox of deficiency and excess,” which means that with close to 35 million Americans getting inadequate care, financially stable people may be getting too much care. How does this compare with the Canadian system ? There are problems with the Canadian health care system, but nevertheless, it delivers unquestionably better care to an entire population — for at the time I was there — 3 percent less gross national product than did the United States. I think that the American system is in chaos at the present time. Everybody is dissatisfied. There are at least 50 proposals to change the system, but there’s no champion or leadership. And though health is being discussed, you don't hear it as the number one priority. At both of the political conventions it was mentioned in passing. There certainly are models that work. Ours does not work. What kind of model would work for the United States? I use the word “single” health plan and stay away from either “national\" or “universal.” I think that the system could be broken up into individual states, but it’ s got to offer a broad approach that simplifies things. It’s estimated that as much as 20 percent of our $800 billion in health care costs is spent on administration. Things like single insurance forms and tort reform could make an impact, but we also have to come to grips with the amount of technology that’s available. It's not that technology is bad; we’re just going to have to use technology in a more reasonable way. Returning to medical school issues, would you briefly share your thoughts about the Yale system of education? Sure. I believe in it; that's the short answer. I really think that the Yale system of medical education is one that is enormously important. I don’t think it's the best system of medical education for everyone, but it’s important to individuals who want to take responsibility for his or her own education, with the ability to get help when needed. Another thing we sometimes forget is that people are in medical school for four years, and then they are in house staff training for a few years. But after that, they practice for another 40 years. A Yale medical education is not like taking a Berlitz course to master the language, only to take an exam and forget it. It’s really to develop a philosophy and attitude that allows the individual to learn for the rest of his or her life. That’s something that Yale gave me, and it’s what we need to pass on to today’s students. We, as faculty and alumni, need to be guideposts. We need to be teachers who will help students shape their lives to the benefit of the students and society. What do you see as the major differences in what medical students face today as compared to when you were a student at Yale? To begin with, the mass of material. It truly has reached the point. I think, where it\" s just very difficult to get even an overview of the main issues. At the same time, when I graduated in 1958, the future of medicine and the shape of medical practice were very clear. I think it’s not at all clear now. Finally, there are concerns about personal safety. By the time I had graduated from medical school, there were, I think, one or two classmates who had developed tuberculosis, but by and large there were really no life-threatening diseases that put you at risk. Today's students are faced with the AIDS epidemic. That has returned them to the tradition of doctors throughout the centuries who have cared for patients despite the risk to themselves. “There clearly has been enormous growth of all medical schools since 1965 when Medicare came in. 1 think this rate of growth simply can ’ tbe sustained. ” Given these challenges, do you favor professional rewards for good teachers? I firmly support promoting people on the basis of excellent teaching. One of the difficulties here is that it's easy to judge research. There are peer-review grants; there are published papers, so there are very clear, objective guidelines. And Yale is an academic institution, and that means that you need to be promoted on the basis of scholarship. We’ve not yet successfully, I think, been able to evaluate whether somebody is a really good teacher. We have to develop some way to objectively evaluate teaching performance. It’s one of the issues that we’ve been looking at and working on. Turning to the alumni, as both a medical school alumnus and former member of the house staff, you bring a particular perspective to the school. How do you view the alumni’s relationship to the School of Medicine? It's a very special relationship. I think that the people who have gone through the Y ale system of medical education have a warm feeling about this institution. One of the difficulties, I think, has been that there are relatively few medical alumni. Until recently, they really have had little communication from the school except through Yale Medicine, and when they have a five-year reunion. And still the alumni have been enormously supportive. Obviously, the alumni’s financial support is important, but so is their direct contact with students as mentors, and with each other as colleagues. I think we really need to cultivate those relationships. What that means is contact in between the five- 6 Yale Medicine Fall/Winter 1992-93 year reunions, and that’s something that I’m interested in devel¬ oping. In fact, I am setting up a series of visits across the country to meet Yale medical alumni. We'll do that on a continuing basis. Speaking of finances, federal research support seems almost sure to be reduced in the coming years, especially reimbursements for overhead expenses. Is the medical school 's fiscal health a particular concern ? Finances are a particular concern everywhere, and they’re always a concern. There tends to be a feeling that because Y ale has a very large endowment, its medical school therefore is similarly en¬ dowed. The medical school’s endowment is really autonomous from the University’s. By and large, our money comes from research funds and from clinical practice. And if managed care is indeed the future of American medicine, that may further limit clinical income. I think that it is clear that clinical practice is not going to be a place that’s going to bring extra funds into the University, if in fact it will even support an academic position. Research funds are certainly under continuing pressure and particularly, as you mentioned, indirect costs. The cold, hard facts are that it costs money to heat a building and to light a building and to clean a building, and somebody has to pay for that. And if reimburse¬ ment for those indirect costs decreases significantly, that’s really a major issue. Does all this add up to a funding crisis on the horizon for American medical schools? We’ll have to wait and see what happens. There clearly has been enormous growth of all medical schools since 1965 when Medi- “ Research funds are certainly under continuing pressure... ” care came in. I think this rate of growth simply can't be sustained. One of the things that I will be doing to position the Y ale School of Medicine for the 2 1 st century is to take a hard look at how much growth we can accommodate. We must have the resources to maintain the same level of excellence that we now have. Financial pressures have helped bring about increased cooperation with industry and other private funding sources. Do you see this trend continuing? Yes, and I think it’s going to grow. Part of our public responsibility tospeed the benefits of research tothe bedside is to embrace biotechnology. Again, take Lyme disease as an example. We can’t make our own vaccine here; we really do need to have a relationship with industry. From my experience in San Diego, which is one of the major biotechnology centers in the country, hospitals and universities have had those relationships without compromising academic integrity, even though the biotechnology companies benefit as well. I think it is an area where New Flaven could grow and provide jobs, which is one of the things this community needs to grow out of some of its problems. To touch briefly on another problem of the American health care system, what about increased specialization and a growing shortage of family practitioners? When 1 graduated from the School of Medicine in 1 958, most people felt if they were going into internal medicine, it was the equivalent of becoming a family physician who would have an interest in a specialty. I think that as medicine has become more complex, it has pushed people more and more into a specialty. One of the things that American medicine in general has not looked at is how many specialists we really need. By contrast, when I began my work in Canada in 1976, one of the first things we were looking at was whether we were training too many endocrinologists. That’s not a question that's been asked until very recently in the United States, and it has to be handled on a national level. The individuals who come out of Y ale School of Medicine will be leaders in many fields, including family practice. Our mission is to train good physicians, whether they be a family physician, clinical specialist or a researcher in molecular biology or some other branch of biomedical science. But Yale is after all, a research institution, and many of our students will go into research and academic careers. Any concluding words to your fellow alumni? My final message is that this truly is an enormously exciting school of which the alumni should be terribly proud. Yale is one of the best schools in the United States, and I look forward to working with the alumni and students as well as the faculty and staff in positioning our school to enter the 21st century successfully. YM Yale Medicine Fall/Winter 1992-93 7 Reflections of a Physician-Journalist by Randi H utter Epstein , M.D. '90 Anyone can be a journalist. There are no prerequisites for the job. No minimum number of grueling courses are required. No professional degree is necessary. And best of all. there are no national exams. Yet those of us with the intention of being a good reporter — the kind that sniffs out news and packages it in proper perspec¬ tive — recognize the best way to prepare is a self-designed educa¬ tion. 1 chose medicine, specifically the Yale system of medical education. Now I'm a foreign correspondent. The foreign correspondent, as the name implies, is a person who lives in a foreign country reporting first-hand news as quickly and accurately as possible. Sometimes it requires sitting in an office, manning the phones, scanning the local papers, doing umpteen telephone interviews. Other times, it’s out in the field to observe, ask questions, assimilate facts and piece together a coherent story — a journalist's version of physical diagnosis and admission note. It’s this latter image of a journalist’s field work, getting right in the thick of things, that lured most of us to try our hand at it. We dream of editors offering us assignments to exotic destinations, begging us to enliven their prestigious publications with our mesmerizing prose. For beginning reporters, such thoughts border on the delu¬ sional. More often than not. we're spending hours rewriting query letters to editors of not-so-famous publications. Those of us who have remained employed during the recent magazine-o- cide. spend more time doing telephone interviews than gallivant¬ ing the globe. Rather than leading to fame or adventure, these crucial con¬ versations enable the office-bound journalist to become an essen¬ tial cog in the wheel of worldwide information transmission. The aim is to pass along vital and not-so-vital news. Many fledgling correspondents move abroad after journalism school — if they choose that dubious training — to learn another language or fall into the rhythm of day-to-day life. Such intimacy with the natives serves as a spice to transform bland reportage into a well-seasoned story. Among my classmates at the Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University, one friend went to Ethiopia, another Nicaragua, a third to Spain. I moved to New Haven. Not surprisingly, my globe-trotting friends had more action-packed stories to send to the class notes section of our alumni magazine. Yet, in some key ways, their journeys to faraway places and my own into the world of medicine shared crucial common threads. Indeed, medical journalism is, in some respects, like foreign Randi Mutter Epstein and her husband , Stuart Epstein Randi H utter Epstein: AP Medical Reporter Before entering the School of Medicine in 1985, Randi Hutter Epstein spent a year honing her journalistic skills at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. There, in the process of earning her master’s degree, she won the American Tentative Society’s Science Writing Award and the school’s Magazine Design Award for her work as art director for Mira! Magazine. After graduating from the School of Medicine in 1 990, Dr. Epstein moved to England to become medical writer in the Associated Press’s London bureau. She also serves as London bureau chief for Physician 's Weekly. Her free¬ lance articles have appeared in such publications as the Washington Post, Harper's Bazaar and American Health. Yale Medicine Fall/Winter 1992-93 correspondence, even if we’re stationed on native soil. We’re typically not island-hopping like travel writers or reporting from combat zones like war correspondents. But like our colleagues, we, too, try to bridge very different worlds, that of doctors and patients. Like my classmates, I, too, learned a new language — medi¬ cine. I, too, tried to assimilate my new surroundings — struggling to keep pace with the frenzied pace of a doctor’s life. I, too, I widened my horizons — observing firsthand a broad range of human diseases. At Yale, I discovered that some of the skills I learned in journalism school also applied to the wards: “Look. Listen. Ask lots of questions.” Moreover, the five basic questions that form the “lead” (first paragraph) of a straight news piece: \"Who? What? When? Where? Why?” worked well for writing admission notes. In other ways, however, the worlds of medicine and journal¬ ism proved dramatically different. Doctors trust people. Journal¬ ists don't trust anyone. In medical school, our professors told us the only thing you never believe is a patient’s assessment of his average alcohol consumption. On the other hand, on my first day of journalism school we were taught the fundamental reporting skill, “If your mother says she loves you, check it out.” A Journalist’s Roots I I started free-lance writing my first year in medical school, reporting at night and squeezing in a few short articles here and there, primarily for health and women’s magazines. I’d try to pick topics touching on subjects we were covering in class. My journalism complemented my education. Writing helped so¬ lidify what I’d heard in class and read in texts. When I couldn't put words on paper, I knew I hadn't grasped the subject. During the spring semester, 1 discovered my knack for jour¬ nalism did not necessarily extend to fiction writing. Richard Selzer’s creative writing course brought together about 20 or so closet-fiction writers lurking in the medical school. Dr. Selzer provided me with the opportunity to humiliate myself every week as I read aloud my homework assignments. One week he told us to create horror stories, the next week, describe a plate of fruit and eggs. I must admit, though, that fiction writing made the chore of memorizing medical trivia seem a lot less onerous. At least the sentences in my textbooks were already written for me. I still talk about writing fiction, but I find myself drawn to non¬ fiction, primarily because it is just that, not fiction. I like to write about things that really did happen and report dialogue that was truly said. Moreover, the medical beat combines the thrill of delving into new health and science discoveries with the chal¬ lenge of writing about them in such a way as to intrigue even the most non-scientifically inclined readers. Plus, the vast selection of story ideas range from microscopic to macroscopic, from molecular biology to health policy. Many feature articles were inspired by patients I examined or the doctors with whom I worked. Days spent listening to the harrowing tales of in-patients at the Connecticut Mental Health Center and discussing the biology of mental illness with Dr. Lawrence Price lead to several articles about depression, one for In View , a magazine for college women, and a second for M, a men’s magazine. A seminar co-hosted by Yale's law and medical schools, an attempt to open the dialogue between doctors and lawyers while we were still in training, led to an article for Physician ’ s Weekly , a publication distributed mostly in American hospitals. This piece was entitled “Yale Deans Seek a Cease-fire.” My third-year clerkship at the Indian Health Service (IHS) seeded more stories and involved a few trips out West. I wrote about native American patients who use both traditional and Western medicine, and covered the plight of doctors working for the IHS. My first story from this period was about a medicine man in Gallup, N.M., who sprinkled corn seed and chanted Navajo songs in the labor and delivery wing of the IHS hospital. I later wrote about a 27-year-old kidney transplant patient who was convinced that her operation was successful because she and her family had attended a nine-day native American healing ceremony. My IHS clerkship also provided me a first glimpse of social¬ ized medicine. I met a lot of disgruntled and disillusioned physicians. I listened to their complaints and watched them try to get by with understaffed and inadequately supplied clinics. The bureaucracy, many said, was the most maddening part of it all. Many doctors spent more time buried in stacks of paperwork than in seeing patients. Further reporting when I returned East uncovered administrative financial abuses which led to an article for Physician 's Weekly entitled “The IHS Mess”. During my final year of medical school, I spent two weeks with a 1969 Yale medical graduate. Dr. Saundra Shepherd, who directed Montefiore Medical Center’ s social pediatrics residency until her tragic death in October 1 992. A day at Montefiore’ s day¬ care center for AIDS-infected toddlers led to a story about efforts to make the lives of these pathetically sick children a bit brighter. Amid working on these features, I was researching and writing my Yale thesis, a partial biography of the late Dr. Wilbur Downs, former director of the International Health Fellowship program at Yale. Dr. Downs and I spent hours chatting about his experi¬ ences as malaria prevention officer in the South Pacific during World War II, including the medical and health policy aspects, a feast of knowledge which he served up with a generous side portion of personal anecdotes. His stories, combined with a bit of digging into the medical archives at Yale, Harvard and the library of the Rockefeller Foundation, where he had worked before coming to Yale, led to my medical school thesis, “Dr. Wilbur Downs: Crusader Against Malaria.” A Difference in Perception Today I am based in England, covering medical news for the London bureau of the Associated Press and writing magazine stories on health and medicine for British and American publica¬ tions. I also serve as London bureau chief for Physician 's Weekly. Although the daily grind of journalism is no different here than it is in the United States, the title \"journalist” goes over a lot better on the western shore of the Atlantic. Americans as a rule seem eager to discover what we reporters really do. The British already know, and they don’t like it. Yale Medicine Fall/Winter 1992-93 9 Randi H utter Epstein keeps abreast of medical news as reported in a wide range of publications, from Lancet to the British tabloids. Here she works on deadline with AP London news editor, Robert Barr. To Americans, journalists are daily reminders of the First Amendment. We embody the independent spirit on which our nation was founded. Here in England we’re seen as professional parasites with a penchant for getting on the nerves of the smart, the rich or the famous. Worse, we’re the unwelcome guests at cocktail parties for fear we may be taking notes. This contrasts with my reception here at the Associated Press, where my colleagues were all too happy when I arrived to free them from the drudgery of weeding through medical journals. My responsibilities include reporting on medical news published in the British Medical Journal and Lancet. I read advance copies of both journals on Thursday morning, choose a few important news stories, interview the authors, get objective comments from experts, and ready a quick story by Thursday evening. AP sends my stories from London to the main bureau in New York, which relays them to newspapers and broadcast media worldwide. It wasn’t until I started choosing my own stories that I realized how much of the medical journalist’s job extends beyond trans¬ lating medical terminology into everyday language. This I learned my first week on the job in the spring of 1991 . A few British doctors wrote a letter to Lancet casting doubt on the safety of chorionic villus sampling, because five women in one hospital, all of whom had CVS early in pregnancy, delivered malformed babies. Realizing that the controversy would be of interest to millions of women, I decided to cover the story. To balance the claims put forth in the Lancet letter, I got a comment from Dr. Laird Jackson of Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, who keeps a worldwide data base of chorionic villus sampling. Not surprisingly, he doubted that the unhappy experience of five women proved cause and effect, when eight million women who underwent CV S apparently did so with no ill effect to their babies. (While some subsequent studies have associated CVS with slightly increased risk of premature deliv¬ ery, none yet has tied the procedure to birth defects.) So, while I led my article with the five women and their babies, I concluded the piece with CVS’s apparent safety. Having carefully explained chorionic villus sampling in everyday lan¬ guage, I transmitted my piece to New York, confident in my balanced approach and smug in the knowledge that stories about babies always get wide coverage. The British journalists got their story splashed across every leading newspaper here. My story never made it out of the AP’s New York office. “I want to tell you why we didn’t run your CVS piece,” Paul Raeburn, the New York-based AP science editor called to tell me. The article’s fatal flaw, he explained, was that I didn’t put the news in proper perspective. Paul pointed out the harsh reality that some of my readers don’t finish my stories. Upon reading about CVS and birth defects, pregnant women worldwide might have 10 Yale Medicine Fall/Winter 1992-93 contacted their doctors immediately, without ever getting to my final paragraph. The potential for igniting unnecessary panic was too great. “You should have started your story with Dr. Jackson's com¬ ment,’’ Paul suggested. Then he added the sobering reminder, “People believe what they read in the newspaper more than they believe their own doctor.” This experience added a new twist to the job. Since then, I think I spend more time grappling with whether to write a particular story than with the writing itself. It’s an aspect of my job that I never considered when I decided to become a medical journalist. A Responsible Balance As a doctor, I want to inform the public about the latest in medical research and developments in health care. As a journalist, I long for that front-page article. It’s a lot easier to write about the most recent “breakthrough” in cancer — no matter how tenuous the evidence — than to do extensive research and decide to write nothing at all. My editors see the bottom line: how many of my stories “get on the budget,” the AP version of a front-page story. When I choose not to cover a story, that’s my own loss. [Despite the pressure to produce newsworthy copy. I can’t crank out a story about potential cures for AIDS or cancer when I picture the patients I helped care for at Yale-New Haven Hospital combing the newspapers and perusing television news reports, ready to grasp at any hopeful straw. Sometimes my stand seems a lonely one. Not too long ago, the London Times Sunday reported on its front page that the drug acyclovir cures AIDS. Prior to that, the same newspaper gave half a page to a new treatment for breast cancer that avoids surgery. I phoned the investigator, who confirmed that the procedure had proven effec¬ tive — on rats with minuscule tumors. “As a doctor, I want to inform the public about the latest in medical research and developments in health care. As a journalist, I long for that front-page article” On a positive note, one of the greatest thrills of my job is positive feedback from readers (ranking close behind positive feedback from editors). A few months ago, I wrote a feature story for the AP about autism and was inundated with letters from parents of autistic children in New Zealand, Thailand, Venezuela and the Philippines. It was the first time I truly realized the worldwide impact of Associated Press stories. These parents wrote to say how relieved they were to learn that scientists are interested in this terrible illness, and that parents have formed self-help groups. One parent even sent money; I returned the $7 one grateful father sent me from Venezuela and put him and his fellow correspondents in touch with a British organization of parents with autistic children. As delightful as such surprises can be, on some level 1 have always known that there’s more to medical reporting than simply tossing out news briefs. A medical journalist not only provides the public with a condensed version of research findings, but also offers the reader an opportunity to peek into a world that is usually off-limits. An explosion of scientific advances, com¬ bined with a rapidly changing health-care delivery system, has dramatically whetted the public's appetite for medical news and analysis of health care issues. People don ' t want to hear that butter is bad, they want to know why. They not only want to know why one treatment is better, but if they can afford it. Readers want the inside story of how medical research is shaped, and how it is funded. Doctors, too, rely on the lay press for medical news. A study in an October 1991 New England Journal of Medicine showed that NEJM articles picked up by the New York Times received a \"disproportionate” number of scientific citations during the 10 years following publication. During the first year after publica¬ tion, NEJM articles reported in the New York Times got 72.8 percent more scientific citations than control articles. The effect, said the investigators, was not noted during a New York Times strike, when the newspaper suspended publication. The study’s author, David Phillips, Ph.D., of the University of California at San Diego, concluded, “Every medical researcher develops systematic and non-systematic mechanisms for reduc¬ ing and filtering what would otherwise be an overwhelming flow of scientific information. Our evidence suggests that a lay publication may serve as one of these filtering mechanisms, even for scientists.” He said further research is necessary to determine whether the lay press not only \"amplifies but distorts the trans¬ mission of medical information to the biomedical community.” Unfortunately, a field like medical and health reporting lends itself naturally to sensationalized stories. People read emotion¬ ally wrought stories about cures for hopelessly fatal diseases and miraculous remedies for the ravages of aging. Medical reporting, compared to, say, political reporting, is a relatively young beat, still coping with the growing pains of any inchoate field. Remember, it wasn't until the past two decades that newspapers began dedicating entire sections to health and medicine. This relative youth is by no means an excuse for shoddy reporting, but perhaps, a reason to hope that as the field matures it will weed out more of its sloppy stories. Despite sporadic lapses into hysterical print and broadcast reports. I’d say the prognosis for medical journalism is good. As for myself, as long as I continue to love my work. I'll keep plugging away, sitting by the telephone, waiting for responses from quotable people, writing in-depth and investigative medi¬ cal stories. And, of course, waiting for my editors to assign me to a story in some exotic place. YM Yale Medicine Fall/Winter 1992-93 11 Lerner Award 1992 Cheme by Jan Geiger Of all the children who came to play at my house, 12-year-old Cheme was the best artist. She almost never spoke, and she rarely smiled. When she started throwing up uncontrollably, her mother took her to the doctor in town. Cheme wouldn't or couldn’t speak, but her brother Moreno said she had eaten a strange fruit from the forest, so the doctor gave her a shot of antihistamine and sent her home. Moreno came across the river in the late afternoon to take me back to his house, where I found Cheme sitting slumped and immobile, drooling out of one side of her mouth that drooped downward. Her father had stayed home from the rice swamp that day to sit and watch her. I couldn't get her to respond to me, but she often didn’t answer questions even when she was well, so I couldn’t tell exactly how out of it she was. When her mother Nuri came home from selling fish to tourists, however, she only had to take one look at Cheme to start freaking out. She grabbed the girl by the shoulders and lifted her up to a standing position, shaking her like a rag doll and shouting, “Ay! Ay! Cheme’s dying! I'm going to die, too!” Then she dropped the child back into the chair and threw herself on the wooden floor, pounding the planks with her fists and howling. The house was on stilts a couple of feet off the ground, and the corrugated tin roof seemed to amplify sound, so the effect was thunderous, especially since Nuri must have weighed over 200 pounds. It was like being trapped inside a giant drum with an enormous insane infant. While she rocked the place thrashing and screaming that if God took her daughter she would surely die, I cringed in a corner wondering, “Is this cultural?” I sent Cheme and Nuri in the back of a pickup truck first to the hospital in town, then to the big provincial hospital in San Francisco de Macons. For three days Nuri sent back word daily that no doctors had come to see Cheme since her admission and that they were doing nothing for her. On the fourth day Moreno came before dawn to tell me his father Rufo was going on the seven o'clock guagua to Macons to take Cheme out of the hospital and bring her home to see the curandero , the local healer. I went and asked Rufo to let me talk to the hospital doctors before he brought his daughter home, just to find out if there was any medicine I should continue giving her while she was under the care of the curandero. We agreed that I would start the ride to Macons on my motorcycle right away and arrive before him, so we could talk to the doctors together. I should have made better time on the Honda than Rufo could on the loaded-down pickup truck, but the bike started to wobble. Halfway there I had to stop and realign the back wheel, so I didn’t reach the hospital in Macoris until sunset. The first thing I saw inside was a black rat the size of a rabbit running alongside one wall of the main hallway. Somehow in trying to find Cheme's ward I ended up in the maternity unit, where the preemies were lying in bedpans instead of bassinets. I recalled a story that a Catholic Relief Services nurse in the capital had told me about a rat getting into a premature infant’s incubator and chewing the baby’s hands off. Suddenly it seemed possible that the CRS nurse had been telling the truth, and that maybe Rufo was right about getting Cheme out of that place. I finally found Cheme lying on a plastic mattress without sheets, drooling and moaning without words, but watching her parents who sat beside her looking stolidly hopeless. Nuri told me that Cheme couldn’t move the right side of her body or the left side of her face, and that she was unable to eat or speak. The mother was sure, however, that the girl understood the speech of those around her. I went and talked with the hospital director, who told me that Cheme had probably had a stroke, but there was no way to tell without a CT scan. If a CT scan confirmed a stroke, she could be taken care of for free in the big public Children’s Hospital in the capital. Since the only CT machine was privately operated and in the capital, and Cheme's parents didn’t have the 500 pesos a scan would cost, the hospital was, as Nuri had correctly per¬ ceived, doing nothing while waiting for Cheme either to die or go home. I offered to pay for a scan, and the director promised to send Cheme to the capital in an ambulance that was going to Santo Domingo for supplies at six o'clock the next morning. I went back and told Rufo what the doctor had said, and that I'd give Nuri 400 pesos for the CT scan plus bus fare to the capital if he’d give her the 100 pesos I figured he was saving for the curandero. He gave in immediately, not knowing what the best thing to do was, only wanting desperately for someone to do something for his daughter. After much searching throughout the town I found someone willing to change a check for cash at an outrageous surcharge, gave Nuri the money and went to a fellow Peace Coips volunteer’s house to collapse on the floor asleep. When I awoke the morning was already getting bright and hot outside; it was after seven. I took my time getting cleaned up; it would have been nice to see Cheme off, but since she had already left for the capital in the six o’clock ambulance, why not take advantage of the luxury of running water? It was almost eight when I went to the hospital to thank the director and found Cheme and her parents where I had left them; the ambulance had gone without her. I sent Cheme bouncing on the bumpy road to the capital in the back seat of a cab instead of in an ambulance, and wondered what additional damage she might have suffered because of it. The CT indeed showed a stroke, and she stayed in Children’s Hospital 12 Yale Medicine Fall/Winter 1992-93 Jan Geiger and Ramsey Alsarraf: From Harvard to Yale Fourth-year students Jan Geiger and Ramsey Alsarraf share the 1992 Marguerite Rush Lerner Prize for creative writing by a Yale medical student. Both honed their creative writing skills while Harvard undergraduates. Ms. Geiger, after having dropped out of high school in Los Angeles, was accepted into the Harvard-Radcliffe creative writing program, where she graduated with high¬ est honors. She then studied Spanish literature on a Henry Fellowship at Oxford. In the Dominican Republic, she worked with women and children as a Peace Corps volun¬ teer in health education and decided to become a physician. Ms. Geiger did neuroscience research at Princeton while finishing her pre-medical requirements there. She says, “My plans include taking an Indian Health Service elective in Alaska and becoming either a pediatrician or a pipe¬ smoking radical feminist obstetrician-gynecologist.'’ Mr. Alsarraf says his poems “she waits” and “he watches” reflect his “interest in the politics of relationships, espe¬ cially the way in which meaning and identity exist within a relationship between two people in the name of love.” The two works are part of a recently composed poetry ¥ -A Jan Geiger and Ramsey Alsarraf collection entitled “Tornado Droppings.” While he was an undergraduate philosophy major at Harvard, Mr. Alsarraf published poems in The Harvard Advocate literary magazine, and his short story “Lucy” won the Iguana Press college writer’s prize. He is currently hard at work both on his medical school thesis, “Nietzsche and the notion of authenticity in the realm of existential psychotherapy,” and on editing his first short novel. there for three months getting anticoagulants and physical therapy. She came home to Villa Clara dragging one leg, with a useless arm, thick of speech and with a strange inappropriate laugh, a kind of disinhibition that made people think she was a little loony. Her father refused to put her back in school; though I argued with him then, I imagine he was right. I gave her a set of felt tipped pens and a sketch pad, but when she tried to scrawl with her non¬ dominant left hand, her face crumpled and she threw the pens back at me. The following week I invited all the children to my house and gave them all crayons and paper. Cheme sat motion¬ less in a corner, scowling with one side of her face. She could only stand it for about five minutes before she grabbed a crayon away from a younger cousin and started drawing. I tacked all her pictures up on my walls. One day I was boiling drinking water with nobody but elMello in the place. El Mello was four years old, supposedly, but he was the size of a two-year-old. He was so weird and precocious that if he hadn’t had a twin sister who looked exactly like him and acted like a normal kid I’d have thought he was actually an adolescent dwarf posing as a small child. He was lying in the doorway of my house so that every time I went from the front porch to the stove he’d get to look up my dress. Each time he caught a peek he’d explode into a lewd chuckle that sounded like Louis Armstrong laughing after a few drags of helium. Barbina’ s grandsons were knocking down a palm tree that had become too tall so that it wouldn't fall on the houses when the next hurricane came. Barbina, who was about 90 years old. was standing in the courtyard between the houses squinting through her cataracts and telling them they were doing it all wrong, but they laughed and told her to stick to women’s business. At a certain moment it dawned on me that perhaps I ought to get off the porch, so I grabbed el Mello and ran into the courtyard. Within several seconds the palm tree tipped the wrong way, toward the houses, and started to fall. Everyone who had been idling around watching operations ran like hell, totally panicked, grown men pushing children out of their way as the tree crashed down and flattened the front half of my house. The palm also knocked down an orange tree, so the courtyard was awash in frantic chickens, rolling coconuts, green oranges, and children running after all the fruit. Only Barbina remained motionless exactly where she had stood while haranguing the men about their technique, about 10 feet out of range of the fallen tree, wearing an ancient-goddess-I-told-you-so look.

Ackerman It started with a single patient in 1986 at the University of Milan. A physician drew a vial of blood from a 49-year-old Type I diabetic woman who also suffered from stiff-man syn¬ drome — a neurological disorder so rare that during the past 30 years, fewer than 100 cases had been reported in the literature. With its symptoms of rigidity and painful spasms of the skeletal muscles in the trunk and limbs, the virtually unknown disease resembles chronic tetanus and is often misdiagnosed as hysteri¬ cal paralysis. Analysis of this patient's blood, however, would provide a kind of Rosetta stone linking one of the world's rarest diseases with one of the most common. The lingua franca proved to be the antigen GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase), an enzyme that synthesizes the neurotransmitter GABA, and that triggers an autoimmune reaction both in stiff-man syndrome and Type I diabetes — also known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, or 1DDM. Hence, the study of an extremely rare disease helped launch a biomedical research effort that may one day help millions of Type I diabetics lead longer, healthier lives. That effort has been led by Pietro De Camilli, M.D.. professor of cell biology, who with several of his Milan colleagues was recruited to Yale in 1988. Since 1992, when Dr. De Camilli also became a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, his team has been based at the Boyer Center for Molecular Medicine. With their arrival from Milan, Dr. De Camilli and his colleagues joined the many YSM scientists whose research includes rare diseases. In explaining the tie between stiff-man syndrome and diabe¬ tes, Dr. De Camilli notes that scientists have come to understand Type I diabetes as an autoimmune disorder in which the body’s defenses destroy the insulin-secreting beta cells of the pancreas. Often, by the time physicians administer the classic blood test for IDDM. most of the beta cells already have been destroyed, leaving little chance to control further damage to the besieged pancreas. Sandra J. Ackerman is a free-lance writer living in New Haven. Her book. Discovering the Brain, was published in March 1992 by the National Academy Press. Further research into stiff-man syndrome may lead to diagno¬ sis of IDDM before much — or perhaps any — such beta cell damage has occurred. The study of this rare disease, which is often associated with IDDM, led the De Camilli team to hypoth¬ esize that the same or similar autoimmune process could be involved in both conditions. Collaborating with colleagues at the University of California at San Francisco, the Yale researchers discovered that the immune system in about 80 percent of Type I diabetics reacted to the GAD antigen. This finding may provide the basis for a sensitive, highly specific assay. This assay could make it possible to detect even a pre-diabetic condition, in which the immune system is just gearing up for a devastating attack on the pancreas. Should biomedical science continue its progress toward discovering how to prevent autoimmune diseases, physicians may one day be able to prevent IDDM altogether. Short of prevention, with careful monitoring, early detection could allow treatment from the onset of Type I diabetes, minimizing the disease’s destructive impact. Research into stiff-man syndrome affirms William Harvey’s sage observation that coming to understand a medical anomaly can throw new light on the human body’s best kept secrets. This knowledge, in turn, often can be applied to treat not only the rare disease itself, but also common diseases. When Roads Diverge Deciding which of myriad rare diseases to investigate, and how to pursue their study, involves many factors, ranging from the availability of funds to the background, interests and even the intuition of the researchers. In the case of stiff-man syndrome, explains Dr. De Camilli, the team had stumbled onto the disorder because of “serendipity and a brilliant co-worker” — Michele Solimena, M.D., who today works at Yale with Dr. De Camilli as a postdoctoral fellow. Dr. De Camilli also credits an insightful team of clinicians at the St. Raffaele Hospital at the University of Milan. The Milan scientists already knew that nerve cells and hor¬ monal cells similarly dispensed some of their chemical signals, such as neuroactive peptides and peptide hormones; the research¬ ers wanted to find out if other common mechanisms also were at work. Their pursuit of this question led to the discovery that 16 Yale Medicine Fall/Winter 1992-93 Pietro De Camilli, M.D. (left) with postdoctoral fellows Maggie Butler, Ph.D., and Michele Solimena, M.D. !! endocrine cells contained organelles, specialized pouches which release neurotransmitter, much like the synaptic vesicles in nerve cells. The researchers came to the hypothesis that insulin- secreting beta cells of the pancreas also secrete the neurotrans¬ mitter GABA through the organelles. Says Dr. De Camilli, “This finding prompted us to hypoth¬ esize that if something went wrong with the organelles, one I should expect both a neuronal disease and an endocrine disease.” Their suspicions were confirmed when Dr. Sol imena came across the woman suffering from both stiff-man syndrome and Type I diabetes. Studies of this patient’s blood led to the discovery that GAD. the protein associated with synaptic vesicles of GABA- secreting neurons and with the organelles of pancreatic beta cells, was a major target to autoimmunity in both diseases. This research offers a new model in which to study the interplay between both humoral and cellular immunity, two kinds of “smart bombs” in the body’s biochemical arsenal. To do its job, humoral immunity uses antibodies circulating in the blood; cellular immunity uses white cells, or lymphocytes, which are summoned as needed from the lymph nodes, spleen and other parts of the lymphatic system. Humoral and cellular immunity address different challenges. While antibodies clean up invading proteins outside the cells, foreign proteins that insinuate their way inside cells become the responsibility of white cells. This is because only white cells can Yale Medicine FallAVinter 1992-93 “see” through other cells’ outer membranes. In rare instances, the body may produce an immune response in two phases, rendering a kind of “one-two punch.” This may be the case. Dr. De Camilli speculates, in the autoimmune reaction to GAD. The first punch, a cellular response, occurs when cells which express the antigen GAD are targeted by lymphocytes. This occurs both in people who develop stiff-man syndrome or 1DDM. The lymphocyte raid sets up the second punch, a humoral response, as the debris from the white-cell attack makes its way to another class of lymphocytes, and thereby triggers the produc¬ tion of circulating antibodies to help destroy the violated cell. This model suggests the need for developing finely tuned therapy for autoimmune disorders, with the goal of treating the initial immune reaction without disabling the entire immune system. The Road Not Taken Must a disease be as scarcely reported as stiff-man syndrome before it is termed rare? Not according to the federal government. In 1983, in passing the Orphan Drug Act, Congress set the rare disease incidence level at fewer than 200,000 Americans, about one in 1,250. Continued on Page 19 17 YSM Faculty Member, Alumnus Lead in Treatment, Research Of Rare Genetic Disorder Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Although able to twist the tongue of the most eloquent physician. HHT does offer a more descriptive name for the progressive, inherited malformations of arteries and veins than did its former moniker, Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. In this rare, progressive disor¬ der. blood vessel fistu¬ las — a kind of short cir¬ cuit — develop between the arteries and veins in the lung, brain, gastroi¬ ntestinal tract, skin and nose of patients. When fistulas appear in the lung, they lead to a re¬ duction in blood oxygen and predispose the pa¬ tient to stroke and other potentially fatal develop¬ ments. Robert I. White Jr., M.D., professor and chairman of diagnostic radiology at Yale and Yale-New Haven Hos¬ pital, first treated the lung fistulas of patients with HHT by blocking them with detachable balloons, a technique called balloon embolization, which he invented while at Johns Hopkins Medical School in the late 1970s. With this non-surgical technique, the physician uses an image-guided catheter to repair the damage caused by HHT, at much lower risk — and cost — to the patient than with surgery, which was the previous treatment of choice. Dr. White’s commitment to HHT patients led him to form, with his patients and their families, a non-profit foundation, HHT Foundation International, based in New Haven, and to chair its medical advisory board. Other medical faculty who serve on the board are David J. Leffell. M.D., assistant professor of dermatol¬ ogy, and Pierre Fayad, M.D., assistant professor of neurology. Dr. Leffell treats skin telangiectasias by tunable dye laser, and Dr. Fayad is studying brain-lung relationships in patients with HHT. Comments Dr. White, “The work of the foundation centers on patient and physician education and development of new diag¬ nostic and treatment methods. Approximately 1 0 percent of these patients die from the disorder and another 20 to 30 percent will have a serious complication. Many of these patients are walking around with a medical 'time bomb’ loose in the brain or lung. Many serious complications such as hemorrhage or stroke occur, but fortunately, if patients with HHT are screened, these compli¬ cations can be avoided by treatment using interventional radiol¬ ogy techniques.” Complementing this faculty commitment to clinical and vol¬ unteer work with HHT is the genetic research of a distinguished Yale alumnus. Francis S. Collins. M.D., Ph.D., director of the Human Genome Center at the University of Michigan and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, also serves on HHT International’s medical board. Having graduated from Yale in 1974 with a Ph.D. degree in physical chemistry. Dr. Collins returned to New Haven for a post-doctoral fellowship in human genetics after receiving his M.D. degree at the University of North Carolina and completing his internship and residency at North Carolina Memorial Hospital. In his search for the HHT gene. Dr. Collins hopes to repeat the success of his research team in identifying the genes for cystic fibrosis and neurofibromatosis — crucial discoveries which have helped biomedical scientists focus their research. As he did in his previous landmark efforts. Dr. Collins is using positional cloning in his hunt for the HHT gene. Positional cloning begins with using family genetic histories to approximate the position on a chromosome for a disease gene. Researchers then compare the patient's DNA in that chromo¬ somal area with that of healthy subjects to reveal any defects. Dr. Collins comments: \"There are approximately 100.000 genes scattered throughout the 24 chromosomes of man, so finding the right one is a difficult process which has been compared to trying to find a burned-out light bulb somewhere in the United States without initially knowing what state to look in. Though the process is laborious and difficult, the technology for achieving it is getting better and better, and the time is right to carry out such a strategy for HHT.” Gregory R. Huth Dr. Robert /. White Jr. Dr. Francis S. Collins Yale Medicine Fall/Winter 1992-93 Harry Bishop Dr. Margretta R. Seashore Continued from Page 17 Taken together, though, rare diseases are not so rare at all, notes Abbey Meyers, executive director of the National Organi¬ zation for Rare Disorders (NORD). She estimates that in the United States, rare diseases comprise more than 5,000 disorders affecting between 10 and 20 million people. NORD, based in New Fairfield, Conn., is a non-profit group of patients and families, biomedical scientists and voluntary agencies which works with government, industry and academia to advance rare disease research. While rare diseases cut across the full spectrum of society, their toll is not evenly distributed. Joseph B. Warshaw, M.D., chairman of pediatrics at Yale and Yale-New Haven Hospital, points out that children bear more than their share: “Most problems that affect children, and that have a genetic basis, can be described as orphan diseases.” Dr. Warshaw points out that the genetic disorders that affect metabolism, for example, usually appear as childhood diseases. Moreover, if these disorders are severe, they may be poorly represented among adults simply because few patients survive to adulthood. Margretta R. Seashore, M.D., professor of genetics and pedi¬ atrics, conducts research into such metabolic errors, in addition to her clinical work with patients with rare disorders. When we are healthy, she reminds us, it may be easy to take for granted the crucial processes of metabolism. Through metabolism’s intri¬ cate series of chemical reactions, the body breaks down every¬ thing we eat, breathe, or otherwise ingest, and uses the resulting products for energy and for building new tissues, eliminating the waste from the body. “It all works wonderfully, when it works,” says Dr. Seashore. “But there are several hundred inherited disorders of metabolism. Usually, these involve a single defective enzyme, resulting in very profound consequences.” Take, for instance, a group of disorders that involves the urea cycle — the breakdown of amino acids in proteins. One such disease makes it impossible for the body to detoxify itself of a by-product of this cycle: ammonia. The disorder can be quite serious, because excess ammonia in the blood can damage the brain. Another metabolic defect may result in abnormally high levels of lactic acid, which interfere with eating and breathing. With the possible problems so numerous and the clues that distinguish them so subtle, diagnosing a specific disorder of metabolism poses no small challenge. Dr. Seashore has begun a project to develop ways to help improve the physician’s odds for an accurate diagnosis. Funded by the New England Regional Genetics Group, this project will produce a computer program that will guide clinicians through the series of observations that leads to diagnosis of little-known metabolic disorders. “These disorders are so rare that no one can have all the expertise required to recognize them,” says Dr. Seashore. “The computer program will be as much an educational tool as a diagnostic one.” Dr. Seashore also is working on several clinical research projects directed at better understanding and treatment of meta¬ bolic disorders. These include studying the use of the drug betaine in disorders of sulfur metabolism and developing ways to diagnose a metabolic disorder in children whose ailments are suspected to arise from metabolic disorders but whose diagnosis is unclear. “We will be challenging these young patients with fats, proteins and carbohydrates to determine which of these causes difficulties, in order to adjust their diets accordingly,\" Dr. Sea¬ shore explains. Dr. Diane M. Komp Yale Medicine FallAVinter 1992-93 19 Michael Marsland James Anderson Other Yale researchers are looking to prevent rare childhood diseases that originate in the womb. One such disorder is being studied by Martina Brueckner, M.D., assistant professor of pediatrics (cardiology), a specialist in congenital heart disease. Dr. Brueckner’s research includes acondition called situs inversus, in which the internal organs of the trunk and abdomen are mirror- image reversed. In a case of complete situs inversus, for example, the heart and stomach are located on the right, while the liver resides on the left. When this occurs, a problem does not usually arise, says Dr. Brueckner. She explains, however, that such is not always the case: “The patients we see have an incomplete form of the condition; for instance, the stomach and liver are in normal position, but the heart instead of being on the left is on the right. These patients frequently have severe congenital heart disease.” Scientists believe that the genetic coding which determines \"left” and “right” in the body expresses itself very early in development, probably in the first three weeks of gestation. Hence, a heart that is misplaced relative to the other organs cannot form the usual connections and fails to develop normally. Re¬ garding diagnosis, “this condition is usually picked up pretty early in life, often prenatally by ultrasound,” says Dr. Brueckner. Many of these patients require heart surgery before the age of 3. Even as the detection and treatment of incomplete situs inversus are now fairly standard, tracking down the mechanism by which the condition arises has become a research focus of Dr. Brueckner and other Yale researchers. She works closely with Arthur Horwich, M.D., associate professor of genetics and pedi¬ atrics, and David Ward, Ph.D., professor of genetics and of molecular biophysics and biochemistry. Dr. Brueckner comments: “Inherited defects have been iden¬ tified in both mice and humans that lead to loss of control over the development of left-right asymmetry of the heart and viscera.” Dr. Brueckner is studying the mouse mutation iv (inversus viscerum), which results in an inherited abnormality of develop¬ ment of left-right symmetry. In these studies, she uses positional cloning, a technique that led to the cloning of cystic fibrosis gene.

Pharmaceutical Safety Net Offered for Patients in Need For some patients in financial straits, an expensive pre¬ scription drug — even if vital to their health — may be be¬ yond their means. In such cases, the pharmaceutical industry has an informal tradition of providing the medi¬ cine free of charge, through the office of the attending physician. The PM A now hopes to begin formalizing this approach with a pilot program to help physicians find out what is available for patients in need. The program consists of two parts: • a directory that lists 59 \"drug indigent programs” by name of the providing company; • a PMA hotline whereby physicians can learn which companies offer a specific drug, and under what circumstances. The hotline number, 1-800-PMA-INFCK 1-800-762-4636), is toll-free; (within area code 202, call 393-5200). For a copy of the directory, write to: 1 992 Directory of Pharma¬ ceutical Indigent Programs, PMA, 1101 5th St. NW, Wash¬ ington, D.C. 20005. “So far, we have localized the iv gene to a small region on mouse chromosome 1 2 and we are isolating the DNA containing it,\" reports Dr. Brueckner. \"Once the gene is identified and its DNA sequence known, the iv gene product can be analyzed and detailed studies of its function in the developing animal can be carried out to better understand the mechanism by which it helps direct left-right asymmetry and early cardiac development.” She adds that the location of iv on mouse chromosome 1 2 corresponds to a position on human chromosome 14, and that researchers are studying human families with congenital heart disease, which may represent the equivalent of the mouse iv mutation. Like Dr. De Camilli, Diane M. Kornp, M.D., professor of pediatrics, and colleagues have focused much of their profes¬ sional attention on an extremely rare immune disorder. They are studying a blood disease called familial erythrophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FEL). [See “Laboratory Medicine’s Wid¬ ening Clinical Horizons,” Page 24.) In this condition, arising once in about a million live births, the histiocytes (a type of blood cell that carries out immune functions) proliferate abnormally and destroy other vital elements in the blood. FEL shows a clear pattern of inheritance: In a family in which both parents are carriers, children have a one-in-four chance of inheriting the condition. Just what goes wrong in FEL? To find out, the researchers studying some of the cell products that the disorder appears to affect. 20 Yale Medicine Fall/Winter 1992-93 A National Network for Information and Support To encourage people to form support groups on specific rare diseases, the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) maintains a networking service for patients and their families. In this confidential service, NORD releases names and addresses only to other families affected by the same disorder, or to a voluntary agency dedicated to the specific disorder. Anyone may register for this service upon joining NORD; annual dues are $25. NORD also offers reprints and articles from its database on rare diseases. Each entry describes in non-technical language the symptoms, causes and treatments of a particu¬ lar disorder and includes a list of related resources. The continually updated database lists more than 850 rare diseases; reprints cost $3.25. NORD’s address and telephone number are: 100 Route 37, P.O. Box 8923 New Fairfield, CT 06812-1783; (203) 746-6518. \"One particularly interesting product in the blood was soluble interleukin-2 receptor, which is produced normally in response to infections,” says Dr. Komp. \"What we found, to our surprise, was that its level in the blood of children with FEL is far in excess of what is seen in most patients with benign or even infectious diseases. The levels are more in the range of those seen in, say, leukemia. This implies that FEL is a disease of regulation — affecting the orderly growth and multiplication of cells — that falls somewhere between benign and malignant. Dr. Komp, too echoes William Harvey as she reflects on this twilight zone of medical science: “To unravel the sequence of events that leads to the death of one in a million children, as in FEL, may lead to discovering the sequence of events in other borderline diseases.” Effective Funding: To Make All the Difference Scientists who study rare diseases at Yale cannot help but be affected by the national debate over how to allocate limited funds for biomedical research. Some advocates for increased funding, including NORD' s Abbey Meyers, suggest that a more effective allocation would result from a national research policy on rare diseases. “In my opinion there has been a purposeful lack of policy,” Ms. Meyers says. “The National Commission on Orphan Dis¬ eases, created by Congress, submitted its report in 1989, a document which has been virtually ignored. The commission found that too many agencies and departments have control over research on rare diseases, and they're not talking to one another. “For example, although the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds a project, the researchers may have to submit their findings to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). But the FDA says, ‘We didn't order this study; you didn't set it up according to our criteria, you didn't do the protocol.”’ Ms. Meyers concludes, “A lot of money is wasted in this way.” Although the commission's report calls for establishing a central coordinating office on rare diseases in the U.S. Depart¬ ment of Health and Human Services above the level of the NIH and the FDA, such a step does not appear on the horizon. Ms. Meyers also protests that federal funding more often is distributed according to public pressure than scientific judgment. She observes, “Priority is given to the diseases that people fear most,” virtually guaranteeing an inequitable distribution of re¬ sources. Says Ms. Meyers, \"The commission found that in 1987, the federal government spent slightly more than $1 billion on rare diseases. But over half this amount went to rare forms of cancer, numbering only 200 or so. Meanwhile, 4,000 other rare diseases have to share the rest of that pie.” Despite such funding inequities, back in the clinics, the laboratories and the research offices, the prospect of taking the road less traveled still holds its appeal. For some rare disease researchers, perhaps those with a taste for riddles that promise a germ of universal truth, the potential rewards offer great allure. Pediatrician Warshaw explains: “If you say to one person in the department, 'Here, you can work on this problem. It affects one in 3 million people, and you can spend 10 years on it and it will never relate to anything else in the world' — do you think anyone is going to want to do that? But if the problem has implications for some aspect of normal functioning of the body that we haven’t understood up to now, then it becomes exciting.” In yet another 20th-century paraphrase of William Harvey, Dr. Warshaw concludes, “The more you understand about rare diseases, the more you understand about normal function.” YM Dr. Joseph B. Warshaw Yale Medicine Fall/Winter 1992-93 21 James Anderson EPH Reflections by Michael B. Bracken , Plt.D., M.P.H. 70 In the 1989 Turner Committee report, the department of epide¬ miology and public health (EPH) was invited to — and eagerly took advantage of — an offer to completely review its M.P.H. curriculum for the first time in 25 years and, possibly, longer. What was the philosophy underpinning this review? First, it should be obvious that profound changes have oc¬ curred in the science of public health. Molecular biology is advancing at such a rapid pace that even those of us within the academy have a hard time keeping up. Our students must know, for example, that p53 is not a school in the Bronx but an important tumor suppressor gene that plays a vital role in the development of several cancers. They must understand that PCR is not one of the new Baltic republics but polymerase chain reaction, a tech¬ nology which underpins many public health programs, including the needle exchange program for which New Haven is justifiably proud to be a leader. The faculty recognized that some grounding in the concepts of molecular biology was necessary for profes¬ sionals entering public health. Yale was the first school to implement such a requirement and other major schools are now following our lead. Those of you who recall computing as staggering over to the Yale Computer Center with boxes of IBM cards, and then returning the next day for the error messages, now realize that today's professionals have more computing power sitting on their desk than the big Yale computers had in 1968 when I first used them. Moreover, this increase in computing power has been accompanied, or perhaps driven, by enormous increases in our capacity to manage and analyze huge quantities of statistical and economic data; hence, the need to reflect these changes in the new M.P.H. program and to bring practical experience of data handling into our classrooms. EPH has preserved its traditional six divisions: biostatistics; chronic disease epidemiology; environmental health; health policy and resources; infectious disease epidemiology; and microbiol¬ ogy; as a way of administering the department, protecting profes¬ sional identity and organizing specialty research and training with some efficiency. However, the AIDS pandemic shows us once more — there have been numerous earlier examples — the ultimate futility of separating chronic from infectious disease epidemiology. Similarly, the need to understand the problems of addictive behaviors, or how to bring health care to the underserved, highlights the absurdity of delineating economics from health policy, or psychology from sociology. The resurgence of malaria This article is based on an address delivered on June 5 by Michael B. Bracken, professor and vice chairman of epidemiology and public health, to EPH graduates returning for alumni weekend. throughout the world is another example that highlights the need to consider economic and health policy along with agri¬ cultural policy. In the late '60s, when I worked on family planning pro¬ grams in Jamaica, we thought we understood the need to in¬ corporate family planning into general maternal and child health programs and to link them with reductions in infant mortality. But we were naive in ignoring at least two other major elements now under¬ stood to be critical. First was Michael B. Bracken the effect of the role and status of women in society generally; better educated women through¬ out the world have smaller families. Second, we didn't under¬ stand how overuse of agricultural land and decreased productiv¬ ity lead to the need to cultivate more land, requiring larger families to work unproductive fields. Again, this points to the importance of integrating policy in the health, economic and agricultural arenas. And so the M.P.H. degree core program must necessarily be integrated and interdigitated among many specialties; this is something the faculty is continuing to fine tune. It is also a University-wide tradition at Yale that professors, not teaching assistants, teach most of the introductory courses. To preserve that tradition in EPH, to upgrade the content of the introductory courses and to more efficiently organize our small department, all of the core courses are now taught by faculty from the relevant specialty. Each specialty core course for all students is also the introductory course for students in that specialty. The effect on streamlining the program is shown by having a single principles in epidemiology course replacing three or four previous introduc¬ tory courses. Similarly, one introduction to health policy course has replaced two or three courses. The philosophy that inter-specialty training is imperative also led to a conclusion that the department should construct well organized cross-divisional majors — the first of which is in inter¬ national health — and reconstruct our joint degree programs with the schools of organization and management, forestry, law and medicine, and the Center for International and Area Studies. But public health remains essentially an art. It is always community-based, requiring leadership skills and the ability to negotiate for competing demands on scarce resources. If John Snow — the 19th-century physician who stopped a cholera epi¬ demic in London by removing a neighborhood pump handle — 22 Yale Medicine Fall/Winter 1992-93 Maryann Bracken wanted to do so today, he would need to network with community leaders; interface with governmental agencies; write an environ¬ mental impact statement; and obtain Human Investigation Com¬ mittee approval. Clearly, public health training must include practical training within health agencies and these components, the community project and the prac"
