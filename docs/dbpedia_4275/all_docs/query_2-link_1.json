        "text": "Sir Michael Stoute's assertion that \"you won't learn anything\" from Golan's latest gallop proved spot on yesterday when the 2,000 Guineas winner, a notoriously lazy home worker, was once again unimpressive in his exercise over six furlongs on the Limekilns at Newmarket.\n\nWork-rider Roy Carter had to bustle up Golan before he pulled clear of stable companions Ghayth and Cover Up. This is nothing new with the laid-back colt, who reserves his energy for the racecourse, but his position as Derby favourite is under threat.\n\nGalileo, cut from 5-2, is now Ladbrokes' 9-4 joint-favourite with Golan. Dilshaan is 5-1, Perfect Sunday 7-1, Chancellor and Putra Sandhurst 14-1 and Tobougg 16-1.\n\nTobougg has been shortened from 33-1 and the Godolphin colt looks set to be Frankie Dettori's ride in the Epsom Classic on Saturday.\n\nRichard Quinn expressed his delight at picking up the ride on Chancellor for Barry Hills after Michael Hills opted for Storming Home with brother Richard on Mr Combustible.\n\n\"He's one of few horses in the race that has won a Group race so he would have an outstanding chance on that alone,\" said Quinn.\n\nTrainer's son Michael was expected to choose Chancellor, but decided after the horses worked on Saturday to go for Storming Home.\n\nQuinn, seeking a first Derby win after 12 attempts, expects to team up with Chancellor the day before the big race. \"I believe we are going to Epsom on Friday morning to have a canter round,\" he added.\n\nFifteen fillies stood their ground for Friday's Vodafone Oaks including the Stoute pair Flight Of Fancy and Gay Heroine. Ed Dunlop could also be double-handed with Mot Juste and Candice, but Aidan O'Brien relies on Imagine, the 3-1 ante-post favourite.\n\nStoute is likely to run both Petrushka and Little Rock in the Vodafone Coronation Cup on the same card. Fantastic Light is an absentee but Godolphin could be represented by Ekraar and Mutafaweq.\n\nWater Jump, who fought off a bout of colic last year, has returned better than ever and landed his hat-trick at Wind sor yesterday. John Dunlop's four-year-old added the Listed Berkshire Stakes to a win at the same level at Newbury last month with a comfortable half-length success under Richard Quinn from the pace-setting Ela Athena.\n\nQuinn, who did not resort to the whip, said: \"I always felt I was going to win and he's done just enough.\"\n\nThe jockey initiated a double when partnering Peter Harris's newcomer Resplendent Cee to victory in the Fimat 15th Anniversary Novice Stakes. The winner, a first successful juvenile with the second runner for the trainer, is a possible for the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot.\n\nLingfield are to install a new all-weather surface as part of a Â£2.8m development programme. A Polytrack surface, replacing Equitrack, is scheduled to open on November 13.\n\n\"We are determined to create the centre of excellence for UK all-weather racing with supporting facilities to match,\" said Ian Renton, director of racing for Arena, owners of Lingfield.\n\n\"All-weather racing is an industry itself and no longer the stand-by product originally envisaged. By laying this quality of surface, we will be able to raise the profile of all-weather racing and develop all the advantages that will offer us.\""
