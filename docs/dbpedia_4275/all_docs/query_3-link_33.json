        "text": "This morning, at 5 am, my daughter, my son-in-law, my granddaughter, my infant great-grandson and I drove three hours to a remote area of the Golan, just below the remains of the Nimrod Crusader Fortress. The plan was to meet my grandson’s commando unit, march with them for the last mile of their three-day hike, to witness the culmination of 14 months of intensive training in order to join this special forces unit of the Israeli army.\n\nAt 8:15, we caught a glimpse of the first group, arriving in well-worn, olive drab uniforms, each man carrying a huge field sack, a rifle, a helmet, weary at the end of this 150-mile trek. They were joined by hundreds of family members of all shapes, sizes, and ages to march with them until they reached a large amphitheater. I cannot imagine this happening in any other country. There, no one would ever consider breaking the ranks of marching soldiers. But here, families were actually walking shoulder to shoulder, sometimes even arm in arm, with these young commandos, as they approached the amphitheater. Civilians and combat soldiers walked the last stretch together.\n\nThe commandos had been on the march, braving foul weather, eating, and sleeping in their soaked uniforms, and sleeping in abandoned farmhouses during the day. But they still had the energy to smile, don their red berets, and cheer in unison.\n\nMy son-in-law, the commando’s father, commented, that as he marched with the group, he heard at least four different languages other than Hebrew. Here were hundreds of family members from every corner of Israel, representing Jews from all over the world. It was another prime example of the ingathering of the exiled.\n\nThe ceremony began. Each commando’s name was read out loud, preceded by the designated title of sergeant. My grandson was called first. My camera at the ready caught the moment. How exciting it was to witness my 22-year-old grandson join this elite unit as a medic. Oddly enough, this young man’s greatgrandfather had been a medic in the Russian army 118 years ago. How much more meaningful it is to become one in your own country. In Russia, he was not allowed to wear a kippah nor respect his religious obligations. Here, my grandson was wearing his kipah and his tzitzit proudly.\n\nAfter the ceremony, the families gathered in an open area to find tables stacked with meats, salads, vegetables, and fresh rolls. We all filled up our paper plates, found a rock to sit on and enjoyed our early lunch supplied by the IDF. As I sat eating, I thought I saw the face of someone familiar, only to realize it was my fellow student from my Ulpan, Judy. Little did we know that each of us had a grandson in the same unit, and both were medics. We eagerly introduced members of our respective families and reflected on how we had arrived at this moment.\n\nI learned that Judy’s mother had left Germany at age 14 in the “Kindertransport” of 1938, and that her grandparents had been on the last train to leave Germany to England before the war began. Here we were, Judy and I, living in Israel, her grandparents having escaped Germany before the war and my grandparents having left Russia because of the pogroms.\n\nI know not your personal affiliation with Israel, but I do know how important Israel is to every Jew in the world. To quote Robert Frost, “Home is a place where, when you have to go there, they have to take you in.” Israel is so much more than that. When you live in the diaspora, no matter how successful you have been, there are moments when you are made to feel less at home than you should. Take, for example, this time of the year. How are you made to feel when someone asks you, “What do YOU do on Christmas eve?”\n\nI made aliyah five years ago. Yesterday’s ceremony added to my perception, my feelings, my attitude about living in Israel.\n\nI am home.\n\nWilliam Kushner is a professor emeritus from Rowan University.

The Kushners made aliya five years ago to join their two daughters, Sura, Aviva, and their families. The have four children, 12 grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren."
