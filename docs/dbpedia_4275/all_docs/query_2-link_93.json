He's definitely a real Arc horse.\n\nThe other British raider, Storming Home, was last of the seven and has finished for the season but stays in training next year.\n\nAquarelliste oozed class as she ran out an impressive winner of the Prix Vermeille.\n\nThe Daniel Wildenstein-owned filly, trained by Elie Lellouche, quickened nicely for Dominic Boeuf to score by a short neck from Diamilina.\n\nAlec Wildenstein, the owner's son, said: \"She is a really exceptional filly. When she accelerates, the race is over.\"\n\nMot Juste fared best of the British raiders, holding Irish challenger Karsavina for fourth place.\n\nThe British raiding party had got the day off to the best possible start when the Paul Cole-trained Guys And Dolls struck in the Prix la Rochette.\n\nNEWMARKET trainer Mick Quinlan's four-pronged juvenile assault on Milan on Saturday paid off with a winner, a third and two fourths.\n\nThe stable's Mac King (24-10) landed the Premio Gudo over an extended seven furlongs for newcomers by a length and a quarter under Palmerio Agus.\n\nQuinlan's Cambrizia (Agus), placed on her Merano debut, was again in the money with a close third to Silvestre in the Premio Melzo."
