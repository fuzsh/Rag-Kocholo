        "text": "As many questions that Saturday's Sagitta 2,000 Guineas answered, it finally posed an even bigger one. Can Golan become the first horse since Nashwan in 1989 to complete the Guineas-Derby double?\n\nPredictably, the bookmakers are taking no chances and the colt is now a best-priced 5-2 with Ladbrokes for Epsom, while Coral's and the Tote go as short as 2-1.\n\nGolan certainly has the breeding to suggest he will stay a mile and a half and if he can combine that with the sustained speed he showed here, he will be very hard to beat in the Derby.\n\nAn analysis of the sectional times on Saturday indicated that Golan ran the fastest four consecutive furlongs of any horse in the race - from the six-marker until the two-pole.\n\nThat is truly remarkable. For an animal to sustain this sort of speed - he was averaging just over 40mph - for that length of time in the middle section of a mile race is little short of sensational and it puts him in a different league to last year's winner King's Best.\n\nThe latter appeared to produce stunning acceleration in the final quarter mile to win the Guineas, but it was more a question of those in front stopping. This was not the case this time and Golan could be a superstar.\n\nRaced only once as a two-year-old when he won a maiden at Chepstow in September, he is further proof of the training skills of Sir Michael Stoute, who was able bring him to a peak without a prior outing in the worst spring anyone can remember.\n\nNot over-racing your best two-year-olds in their first season, or even giving them a perfunctory couple of runs, is now becoming standard practice for the top English trainers, al though it is not a method favoured by Aidan O'Brien.\n\nThe Group One races for juveniles in the programme are now beginning to look of financial and academic interest only; a startling statistic being that the Dewhurst Stakes winner has gone on to win the 2,000 Guineas just three times in the last 30 years - El Gran Senor, Zafonic and Pennekamp.\n\nGolan is a very fresh horse and in the long term this must be of immense benefit to him. Stoute does not intend to give him another run before the Derby so his stamina must be taken on trust. But being by the Champion Stakes winner Spectrum out of a mare by Generous he has a middle-distance pedigree.\n\nIf Golan was the equine hero on Saturday, then Kieren Fallon's effort must not be underestimated. Like a cat with nine lives Fallon keeps coming back. Sacked by Henry Cecil two season ago, his world fell apart. But there was worse to come and by mid-summer last year, after a horror-fall at Royal Ascot, he was wondering whether he would ever ride again.\n\nHow he overcame the loss of use in his left arm has been well-documented and looking back, the Cecil sacking can be seen as a blessing in disguise. Indeed, you could put it even more strongly and say that is was the best thing that could have happened.\n\nPicked up by the powerful Stoute stable, Fallon's career has suffered not one jot. He has now won the 2,000 Guineas in successive years and stands on the threshold of gaining his second Derby triumph to follow Oath in 1999.\n\nCompared to Stoute, Cecil has strugged. Beset by personal problems and the loss of form of his horses, he is not exactly a back number. However, he has had to take an unaccustomed back seat.\n\nCecil's Derby colt, Curtain Time, seemed aptly named after failing in the opener on Saturday and the main danger to Golan at Epsom could turn out to be his stable companion Dilshaan, who beat Tamburlaine in the Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster last season.\n\nApparently Dilshaan, a 12-l chance for the Derby, worked well on Saturday morning and is on target for the Dante Stakes at York Wednesday week.\n\nO'Brien's Galileo, quoted at 8-1, is due to take the Sinndar route and will go for the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial at Leopardstown on Sunday."
