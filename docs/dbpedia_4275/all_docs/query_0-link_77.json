Post time: 4:55 p.m. Bets: WPS, exacta, trifecta, superfecta, daily double, pick 3.\n\nANALYSIS: Europeans have dominated this race recently (Daylami, Kalanisi, Fantastic Light), and with two of their best coming over this year – Irish-breds Golan and High Chaparral – that shouldn’t change.\n\nGolan, a 4-year-old, has raced just twice this year, with the Breeders’ Cup and the Japan Cup in November his major goals. Both Group 1 races this summer were sharp: a victory in the King George and a close second in the Juddmonte International.\n\nHis trainer, the legendary Sir Michael Stoute, has won the Turf twice.\n\nHigh Chaparral, a 3-year-old, won the English and Irish Derbys before coming down with the cough that swept trainer Aidan O’Brien’s Ballydoyle yard this summer. He returned with a third in the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, and O’Brien said he’ll move forward off that race.\n\nDenon, winner of the Turf Classic last out, has been America’s most consistent grass runner this year.\n\nLIVE LONGSHOTS: With Anticipation won three straight, beating Denon twice in photo-finishes, before finishing a tired sixth in the Turf Classic.\n\nBalingarry shipped over from Ireland to win the Canadian International. Formerly trained by O’Brien, he was sold after that race and will be saddled by Laura de Seroux.\n\nTHE BET: Play Golan to win. Box him in exactas with High Chaparral. Use them 1-2 in trifectas over Denon, With Anticipation and Balingarry.\n\nTOMORROW: Ray Kerrison on the Classic"
