        "text": "Stefanie Golan, a St. Charles, Missouri native, was named the University of Missouri's second women's soccer head coach in May 2021.\n\nThe 2023 season will be Golan's 15th as a head coach and third at Missouri. In 14 seasons, she has totaled a 137-100-38 (.567) career record.\n\nGolan came to Mizzou after spending nine seasons building a championship program at the University of Minnesota.\n\nIn nine seasons as head coach at Minnesota (2012-2020), Golan fashioned a 92-64-24 (.578) record with four NCAA Tournament appearances, one Big Ten regular-season title, a pair of Big Ten Tournament championships and eight winning seasons.\n\nLeading the Gophers to the 2018 Big Ten Tournament Title, Golan's squad ran through the tournament without allowing a single goal after entering as the seventh seed. With qualification secured for the NCAA Tournament, Minnesota upset Auburn 2-0 in the first round before falling to the UCLA Bruins in the second round of play.\n\nGolan earned her 100th career win against Utah State on Sept. 8, 2017. The milestone came in the form of a 5-0 defeat of the Aggies in her nine seasons as a head coach.\n\nNamed Big Ten Coach of the Year in 2016, Golan led Minnesota to a 16-3-4 record and the program's first sweep of the Big Ten regular-season and tournament titles. The Gophers finished the 2016 campaign ranked in the Top 15 nationally after earning the highest national ranking in program history at No. 8. That squad also boasted the Big Ten Forward of the Year in Simone Kolander and the Big Ten Defender of the Year in Rashida Beal, who earned All-America honors and later drafted by FC Kansas City.\n\nGolan guided the 2015 Gophers to the second round of the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2010 and a 12-7-3 record. The program was ranked as high as No. 11 during the season, and Kolander earned the first of two Big Ten Forward of the Year honors.\n\nIn 2013, after Minnesota's third NCAA Tournament appearance, freshman Tarah Hobbs earned a pair of invites to the U20 Women's National Team Training Camps after a season where she was honored with NSCAA second-team All-Great Lakes, 2013 Big Ten Goalkeeper of the Year, All-Big Ten first team and Big Ten All-Freshman Team honors.\n\nBefore moving to the Twin Cities to guide the Minnesota program, Golan sept five and a half years at Army West Point, serving as the associate head coach in 2007 and 2008. In three years as the head coach, 2009-11, she led the team to a 33-18-10 record and the program's second-ever NCAA Tournament appearance in 2011.\n\nAfter debuting as the Black Knights' head coach in 2009, Golan's 2010 squad registered the program's highest win total since 1996 with its 14-4-3 record. It allowed just six goals on the season en route to a share of the Patriot League's regular-season championship. In her final season at West Point, Army went 12-4-5 and won the 2011 Patriot League Tournament title with a thrilling 2-0 win over arch-rival Navy to earn the second-ever NCAA Tournament appearance in program history.\n\nPrior to joining the Army West Point staff, Golan served as an assistant coach at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Evansville after launching her career as a graduate assistant at Mercer University. The St. Charles native is an active member of the NSCAA and a former Chair of the NSCAA Great Lakes Region for the organization's All-America Committee.\n\nGolan earned a soccer scholarship to Duke University (Stefanie Kraay), where she played 56 games from 1997-2001 and helped lead the team to four NCAA Tournament appearances. The former Blue Devil earned a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 2001 before adding a master's in sports leadership from Northeastern University in 2012.\n\nGolan has two sons, Travis and Max, and a pair of dogs, Sarge and Captain.\n\nSTEFANIE GOLAN'S CAREER HEAD COACHING RECORD Year Overall Pct.
