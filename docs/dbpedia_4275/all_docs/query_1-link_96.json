        "text": "Gosh, I've only just recovered from the shock of Black Caviar's race. I'm so pleased that I went down to Ascot that day as it's a race I won't ever forget. Nor will anyone who saw it forget it. And I'd be kicking myself if I hadn't been there. We knew that it would be special, but I don't think that anyone knew how extraordinary it would be. The tension was oppressive beforehand. She simply had to win; and one didn't need to have too great an understanding of horses to realise that she's a mare for whom things could go wrong at any time. The grim expressions on those around her, as well as her feisty look, said it all: it was like watching a team preparing their gladiator for battle.\n\nAnd battle, of course, it was. At her best she'd clearly just stroll alongside them for four furlongs and then saunter clear. But every day horses who should be able to win, don't. And that's when they are playing in their own country, in their own hemisphere, in their own climate, in their normal conditions and when they don't already have a hell of a lot of wear and tear on their bodies. As Frankel is proving and as she has proved, it's easy enough for a horse who is a lot better than the others to keep showing up only when in peak condition and only when everything is in his/her favour, and keep winning easily. That's grand, and champions should be much better than their opponents.\n\nBut true champions can battle too. Ask them to race when everything is against them and they'll still win. They'll win on class, sure, but they'll also win on pure courage. I've never seen a sprinter so tired after the race as she was: she'd put her heart and soul into it to fall in by a head. Granted, it should have been more than a head had not Luke Nolen's brain frozen in the last furlong, but even so she wouldn't have won by much even if he hadn't got things so badly wrong. At first I thought that he'd mistaken the winning post, but on reflection I just think that he hadn't seen the two horses finishing fast on his left side. He'd been drawn the widest runner and he probably wasn't expecting anything to come from even farther out than he was. And he had the ones on his inside well covered.\n\nThank God she got him out of trouble because it really would have been very close to a tragedy (and I am aware that we should not use that word lightly) if he had got her beat. It would have been a tragedy in the Greek sense, because poor Luke would have been a broken man. Roy Higgins still hasn't been able to put the 1975 Moonee Valley Cup, when he dropped his hands on Hyperno and got beat, behind him. I see that he's written that this will haunt Luke, but it only will to a certain degree thanks to the fact that he held on: nobody would be going on about Roy's blunder now had Hyperno won, which by the grace of God is what the lovely, the best and the bravest Black Caviar did. And I'm so glad that I was there to see the victory.\n\nIn all of the excitement, it was almost possible to forget that the Melbourne Cup quinella were re-opposing yet again. And once again they passed the post almost as one. What two wonderfully consistent horses Dunaden (pictured in this paragraph) and Red Cadeaux are. Dunaden is in my XII to Follow, so let's hope that he can get his head in front soon. He ought to be able to do so as he's a cracking horse who is in great form and who has, I venture to suggest, still got improvement in him. Even if Black Caviar hadn't been there, Saturday would still have been a great trip to the races simply because of having seen him.\n\nWe had the perfect post script to the afternoon at the races when we welcomed a few guests to our picnic in the car park afterwards. Guest of honour was Peter Moody, who joined us with his friends after his car had, hard though this is to believe, broken down as they were about to leave. A new car too. It was good to see him unwind, the tension at last dissipating, the ordeal over, disaster avoided. He's a tremendous man as well as a terrific trainer and it was lovely to share the evening with him. Another Aussie trainer, albeit one who trains in the UK, Jeremy Gask, showed up, with a visiting South Australian trainer whom I used to know years ago, David Jolly, and there was further representation from the Aussie trainers with Peter's friend Brett Cavanough, who trains at Albury and who broke Black Caviar in. And the Aussie hoops were represented by Kathy O'Hara, so it was a proper league of nations. Which was great.\n\nSo now we have three more days at the races. Yarmouth tomorrow with Silken Thoughts. Newmarket Friday with Ethics Girl. And probably Doncaster Saturday with Batgirl. Hopefully they will all run well. I suppose that Silken Thoughts will be the shortest price of the trio and probably Ethics Girl the longest. But that doesn't necessarily mean anything. Let's just hope for three good runs. If the days are as enjoyable as Ascot was on Saturday, that'll be very good - and that's far from impossible because, of course, however good a day is when you don't have a runner, any day on which you have a runner has the potential to be even better. Or even worse, depending on how things go.\n\nRoyal Ascot. Two days down, three to go. Frankel, of course, has been the star - although So You Think provided us with yet another special moment today. And Frankel will remain the star right to the end of the Carnival, almost irrespective of whatever Black Caviar does. It is almost inconceivable that she can post as impressive a victory as the one to the sight of which he treated us. (Technically correct but unacceptably unwieldy clause at the end of that sentence, I'm afraid). His win was surely the best win anywhere in the world this century, and arguably the best win since Secretariat's Belmont Stakes victory in 1973, although it might be wrong to overlook Shergar's Derby. But, even leaving aside the stunning performance of Frankel, there have been some great runs by a few other horses whom I also enjoy seeing in the mornings.\n\nKing's Stand winner Little Bridge (pictured in the previous paragraph) can't really be termed a local horse, being trained in Hong Kong, but he's been in Clive Brittain's stable for around a month and we've seen a fair bit of him, mostly in the rain (which isn't as great a coincidence as it sounds, as it has rained on a disappointingly high proportion of the mornings of the past month). I didn't watch him exercising on the press open morning last week, but I didn't feel that I missed out as I'd already seen plenty of him. I rather fear, though, that nobody watched him at all, which would have been rather sad. It's great that the press are given the opportunity to inspect the overseas raiders on a designated pre-Ascot open morning each year, and it's great to sneak along to it (on the perfectly justifiable pretext of being Winning Post's overseas correspondent) but one has to say that this year's press open morning, which was obviously dominated by Black Caviar (pictured) was a complete debacle.\n\nBlack Caviar goes out each morning some time before 5.00 and wanders around for a while. There aren't many people at large at that time of day, so she has plenty of privacy to do her minute amount of work. On the open morning, she duly went up the Al Bahathri extremely slowly at 5.00 (pictured) and then returned to her stable. It wasn't a bright morning, so the snappers wouldn't have had great conditions to record her pacework for posterity - and then, to widespread consternation, they discovered that they were not allowed to photograph her in the stable because (hard though this is to believe) her owners had signed an exclusive-rights contract with Racing Victoria's TVN station, giving that channel sole access to her. So that was part one of the cock-up, and the part from which her connections emerged with no credit. However, things only got worse.\n\nUnbelievably (bearing in mind that each stable only has one horse here and all day to work him) the two HK-trained gallopers, Joy And Fun (stabled, like Black Caviar in Abington Place) and Little Bridge (stabled in Carlburg), then worked at exactly the same time (5.50) on different parts of the Heath (the former up Long Hill, the former on the Al Bahathri). I wasn't too fussed about having to miss one or the other, because I'd already seen plenty of Little Bridge, so it was an easy decision for me to head out the back to watch Joy And Fun canter slowly, ridden by his trainer Derek Cruz, up Long Hill (pictured).\n\nIf, though, it reflected poorly on the organisers that these two horses were working simultaneously and separately, it reflected even more badly on the press, who ignored them both. I suspect that nobody watched Little Bridge (and more fool them, as he's now the King's Stand winner) and, amazingly, only six people watched Joy And Fun - and two of them were Derek Cruz's wife and very nice son Trevor (seen walking in alongside the horse)! The remaining hundred-plus journos just mooched around in Abington Place, complaining about Black Caviar's invisibility and hoping to catch another glimpse of her. I was embarrassed on behalf of Joy And Fun's connections, as it was a collective disgrace that he was there but ignored.\n\nAnd then, to complete the f**k-up, Ortensia came out for her exercise, which involved walking around the extremely murky indoor ride (as she had galloped the previous day). That meant that she was as close to being invisible as it was possible to be (as you'll see from this photograph, in which photographer Steve Cargill is looking at, but not photographing, her) - but that didn't matter because nobody seemed interested in her anyway. I'm told that I very closely resemble the QC in the Leveson Inquiry - well, if that inquisition/whitewash (delete as applicable) paints the British press in a poor light, this press morning depicted it even less flatteringly. I thought at the time, 'I wish one of these other horses could go and win at Ascot and make the journos realise how stupid and ignorant they have been so completely to ignore them' - and now, justice done, Little Bridge has won the King's Stand.\n\nOn a more positive note, a more satisfactory event has been the annual pre-Ascot invastion of human visitors from Australia. There's always a really good crew of them here for a few days en route to Ascot. This year, courtesy of Black Caviar, they showed up in record numbers. I generally try to spend a bit of time with them. Going to Salisbury on Sunday, I couldn't see them then, but I spent an excellent evening on Saturday with one bunch in the Bedford Lodge and then joined two groups (led by two really nice men Bryan Martin and Wayne Wilson, the former chief race-callers of Melbourne and Brisbane respectively) for an hour or so on the Heath on Monday morning. It was an excellent hour, in which they saw plenty of nice horses including Frankel and were able to pass the time of day with plenty of the locals. Included among the locals was our favourite honorary local Michael Holding, who couldn't have been nicer when I pointed him out to a few dozen of the Aussies with the suggestion, \"There's Michael Holding. He's the friendliest man you'd ever find, so why don't you all head over to say G'day\". As all Aussies love cricket as much as racing, his presence was perfect - and I was delighted to be able to take a photograph of two sporting legends, the other one (on the left of shot) being the great former Kiwi jockey Bob Skelton.\n\nRemarkably, Bob was not the only Melbourne Cup-winning hoop on the Heath as Ray Selkrig, champion jockey in Sydney in 1958/'59 (following Neville Sellwood and preceding George Moore) and rider of the 1961 Melbourne Cup winner Lord Fury, was also in the group. He seems a lovely man and it was a pleasure and honour to meet and chat with him. Ray (pictured here, with Bryan Martin on right of shot) rode, of course, in the era when most of Australia's top jockeys rode in Europe at some stage, but he never did: he said that he was offered a contract one time but turned it down (Bill Williamson then accepted it) but that he didn't regret not coming as, although it would have been a great experience, he wouldn't have been champion jockey at home if he'd gone travelling and wouldn't have won six Derbys (including three, the VRC, AJC and QTC in 1964/'65, on Royal Sovereign, the best horse whom he ever rode and who has a feature race in Sydney named after him).\n\nJust before I close, I must salute Princess Haya. The Prince of Wales's Stakes today was a cracking race, with lovely So You Think recording his tenth Group One victory. I thought that he looked the best he's ever looked in Europe, appearing to have regained the depth, strength and solidity which he'd exhibited when trained by Bart but which he lacked last year. That was lovely and he was a really popular winner - but surely Carlton House (pictured returning from a gallop on Racecourse Side early one morning last week, with his usual rider John Nolan) would have brought the house down had he won rather than finished second. I'm full of admiration for this lovely horse because it seemed (with the wisdom of hindsight, now that we know that he didn't win it) to have been the wrong decision to run him in last year's Derby, from which he unsurprisingly seemingly came back very sore. It's great that, a year on, he's got over that - and it would have been really, really great had he been able to give the Queen a Group One victory at Royal Ascot in Diamond Jubilee year/month. The loveliest thing of all came when Princess Haya was being interviewed on the BBC after her filly Joviality had won the Windsor Forest Stakes, the previous race. She had Colombian set to run in the Prince of Wales's Stakes, and when asked of her hopes for him in the race, she replied, instantly, straight from the heart and with complete sincerity, \"I hope that Carlton House wins\". It was a lovely moment, and when Rishi probed further, asking about Sheikh Mohammed's views, bearing in mind that Godolphin had two runners, she responded, \"We all hope that Carlton House wins\". It was a wonderfully moving moment. Sportsmanship isn't dead.\n\nIt was an enjoyable trip to Windsor on Monday with Gus having some great fun running around both before and after racing; and with Grand Liaison doing us proud, even if it was a slightly frustrating outing as she didn't get the run of the race. But that's Windsor. I've never trained a winner there which might explain my reluctance to go there when we have a horse who looks as if he or she is just about ready to win; but, leaving my prejudices aside, it is widely reckoned that one needs even more luck in running than usual there. However, Grand Liaison, having been eliminated from Yarmouth the previous week, had only two options this week - and the other was Brighton, another track where one ought to expect the unexpected. She'd have been in a full field at Brighton, which means that one's fate could have been in the lap of the gods, so it was a relatively easy decision to head to Windsor.\n\nShe ran well to finish third, doing well to get so close after being too far back early on. It wasn't the aim to get back, but that's Windsor: it was a rough race, she was squeezed out after about 300m, and our goose (our metaphorical goose, that is, not one of the many geese who roam along the banks of the Thames next to the track while the races take place) was cooked at that point. Still, it was very good to see her run so well and so genuinely, especially after the form of her previous second place at Leicester had taken a couple of serious knocks. I wasn't actually too concerned about the Leicester form being let down, because the race at the time had seemed to be a proper test. However, one couldn't ignore the fact that its winner (Sea Fever), its third (Neige D'Antan) and it's fourth (Kaiser Wilhelm) had all subsequently run poorly, seemingly leaving a question mark over the merit of our second place. However, Sea Fever had over-raced when a badly beaten favourite next time (unlike at Leicester, where he travelled very kindly), Neige D'Antan had missed the start again (and I am happy to put a line through the performances of horses who develop a habit of missing the start, as it usually means that they've got something wrong with them) and Kaiser Wilhelm had run on very different (much firmer) ground when tailed off at Yarmouth.\n\nSo at least Grand Liaison has been the one of the four to hold her form from one race to the next. Let's hope that this lovely filly can continue to do so - and if the Racing Post's comments are anything to go by, one might expect Kaiser Wilhelm to pop up one day. I don't know if you noticed these words, but when the horse finished 10th of 14 in his third maiden race at Kempton on 30th April, Spotlight commented, \"Allowed to be very slowly into stride and soon held up in last, pushed along over 2f out, kept on steadily, capable of better\". It's lucky that Chris Catlin isn't litigious: lawsuits have been based on less than that! I don't know what the stewards' report made of it (disappointingly, unjustifiably and inexplicably, the Racing Calendar no longer carries stewards' reports, which is a real shame as they used to be the most interesting part of the paper) - but it might be worth noting that the horse ran considerably worse than that at Yarmouth last week when finishing last, beaten 29 lengths, off a rating of 62.\n\nYou may have seen the news story which Emma put up on the site about the favourite winning. This, of course, was Kadouchski, who is our favourite at all times, even when he is the outsider in the betting, as he was on Monday when winning at Folkestone under a top ride from Hannah. I'd been very pleased at the chance to let him run on the Flat on soft ground, conditions which have always brought out the best in him over hurdles but which he had never previously encountered on the Flat.\n\nI thought that the going would surely bring him right into it, especially as he was racing off a mark only 2lb higher than when winning at Folkestone on firm ground last July. And Spotlight in the Racing Post clearly held the same opinion, making him the selection. I was, therefore, rather surprised as the horses cantered to post to note that he was the 8/1 outsider (and actually returned 17/2) in the five-horse race (the field having been reduced by two scratchings). Even so, I have so much respect for the top-weight Golan Way, who has put in so many terrific runs over jumps, that I thought that, even getting a stone and a half with him on top weight as us at the bottom, he'd be a hard horse to beat.\n\nAnd so it proved: we won by three quarters of a length from Golan Way. And we have Hannah's ride to thank. She did everything right, mooching around on the inside behind the leaders all the way, waiting and waiting until the gap came in the straight almost as if George Moore was there with his whistle, and then squeezing through it. Carrying 7lb more (ie without her claim) he couldn't have won, and he couldn't have won without everything going right in the race too. If she had adopted the all-too-popular tactics of challenging on the outside around the final bend, as one sees on a daily basis, he wouldn't have won. So that was excellent. And it was pleasing that Hannah got so much recogition for it, the press being very quick to highlight the ride, and even one of the senior jockeys who rode in the race (Dane O'Neill) tweeting that it was a \"cracking ride\". So that was just lovely all round. And Gus enjoyed it too: as ours was the last race, things were quiet enough afterwards for him to help supervise Kadou in his victory pick.\n\nMonday was, of course, in plenty of other respects a shocking day. Terrible weather in much of the south east. Newmarket didn't fare too badly and neither did Folkestone (which apparently only copped 10mm of rain, all in the morning) but the area from north London down to the south coast and along into West Sussex seems to have had about two inches in the one day, which is as solid a deluge as one would usually ever see in the UK. We drove through so much really heavy rain on the way down to Folkestone (where, miraculously, we didn't get rained on at all) before finding that it was still raining solidly for most of the journey home several hours later.\n\nAnyway, as you can see in the previous paragraph, conditions were bleak on the Heath on Monday morning, while Tuesday was almost similarly grim. Much better conditions the past couple of days, fortunately, with Wednesday's dawn, as you can see, having the sky much less full of cloud than it had been previous couple of days. Things did subsequently spoil a little bit, but we've had reasonable amounts of sunshine too today so I hope that we're going in the right direction. Tomorrow could be a big setback, though, if the forecast is right, so we must hope that, while we want plenty of rain for Batgirl, Wasabi and Zarosa to get nice soft ground on Sunday at Salisbury, there isn't so much that racing is abandoned.\n\nEthics Girl and Ollie (Orla's Rainbow) were entered at Sandown tomorrow, but the ground 'soft, heavy in places' with more rain forecast made it a no-brainer not to declare those two particular horses. (Other entries not to be running include Grand Liaison, who missed out by one when eliminated from Yarmouth today; while Ruby's intended debut has been postponed by a couple of weeks, the result of a sore foot - the best laid plans of mice and men, and all that). However, we put Ollie in at Musselburgh too and I hope that we'll find a sound surface there, so I'll be heading up there with him early tomorrow. I love going up there so, once I've got over the very early start, I hope that it's an enjoyable trip. I hate being away from home overnight, but it would be unrealistic to go up and down in the day, so we'll stay there after racing and come home on Saturday. Let's hope that it's a worthwhile trip - and Ollie is certainly giving himself every chance: I've told him to keep himself fresh with a long journey ahead of him and, as you can see, he's taking me at my word."
