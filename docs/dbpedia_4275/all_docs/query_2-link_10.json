        "text": "Dilshaan looks both progressive and tough given his hard- fought win from Celtic Silence in the Dante at York last month and he carries a lot of stable confidence to become the first Stoute winner of the Derby since Shahrastani carried of the prize when ''The Mummy'' was still Prime Minister in 1986.\n\nWord from the Stoute camp is that Dilshaan has been impressing at his home work, while Golan, the drifting favourite, looks a real lazy individual.\n\nHowever, it is ability that wins classics, not just application, and Golan has outstanding claims based on both breeding and the sectional times of his Guineas win.\n\nOn breeding, this son of Spectrum should stay the Epsom mile and a half and, if anything, the reports of his lazy attitude to the gallops suggest a temperament which will help the horse get the trip.\n\nHowever, it is on the detail of the Guineas timings that Golan's chief claims lie. These were quite exceptional, suggesting a horse with both effortless cruising speed and a murderous burst of acceleration when required. On the basis of the clock, Golan could be a really above-average classic colt.\n\nForget drifting in the ante-post market. The truth is that no-one really knows if the colt is going to be on song, and his chance would be the same whether he opened at the 6-4 available a couple of weeks ago or the 11-4 which could well be available today.\n\nThe real doubt about Golan is not the stamina or the gallops but the tame eclipse of Guineas runner-up Tamburline in the Irish equivalent two weeks ago.\n\nHowever, the likelihood is that the Irish race came a bit too soon for Tamburline. Looking beyond the Stoute twosome, the other favourite is the Aidan O'Brien- trained Galileo.\n\nThere is a lot of Irish confidence behind this unbeaten colt but he did make heavy weather of beating Exhaltation at Leopardstown, and he looks to me unattractive at the odds.\n\nTobougg, the Godophin colt, is certainly better than he showed in the Guineas, where he ran a disappointing ninth, and he may be the one for a bit of each way money.\n\nHowever, to lift the big prize I stock with classic form and time ratings and make Golan a nap bet.\n\nEveryone has favourite races and one of mine is the Diomed Stakes at 3.05, where it seems I stumble on to the winner just about every year.\n\nThis time around I look no further than Ian Balding's hat trick- seeking Nicobar.\n\nThis four-year-old has already done the business at Epsom, with two wins over seven furlongs last year, including one at this equivalent meeting last year. He won a Group 2 at the San Siro last time out and is well up to the quality required to win from this field.\n\nNicobar is a tough customer who likes the course.\n\nHe is fit and in-form and well up to this Group 3 class. All in all he looks a decent bet to complete the double with Golan.\n\nIn the first at Epsom, which is a very trappy handicap, it might just be that Parisien Star has sneaked in at a very competitive weight.\n\nThere is a distance doubt here but, none the less, if he gets the trip, he might win this with something in hand.\n\nSarangani, who is a five-year-old trained by Balding, must also be in with a great shout, having returned to form last time out.\n\nSo on a great day for racing, go for Golan in the Derby as the best bet of the day, and take Nicobar as the next best in the race before the premier event.\n\nl Tobougg has been backed to give Frankie Dettori his first win in the Derby, from 20-1 to 14-1."
