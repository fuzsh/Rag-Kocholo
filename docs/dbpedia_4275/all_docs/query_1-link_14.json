        "text": "Crystal Ocean is a portrait of equine calm and readiness, but his trainer, Sir Michael Stoute, remembers a more stressful preparation for this weekend’s big race at Ascot. The horse who caused the crisis was the lost, lamented Shergar.\n\nStoute’s fine record in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth QIPCO Stakes might have been less impressive without a phone call from his great Newmarket rival, the late Sir Henry Cecil. Any mention of Shergar, the 1981 Derby winner who was kidnapped at stud in Ireland and almost certainly killed by the IRA, brings a certain sadness to proceedings, but this tale comes with a happy ending.\n\n“He [Shergar] had a little bit of naughtiness about him and he liked to spin around before he was going out to canter,” Stoute begins. “In fact, before the King George, he went out onto the Limekilns in the winter, in days when we could have road work; we would cross towards what we call ‘the boy’s grave’ and trot from Moulton up the hill to Warren Place.\n\n“I would be on my hack and organise the traffic; the horses would trot. That was his winter route. But this one morning, he got rid of his jockey at the bottom of the Limekilns. He turned around, shot up through a belt of trees, across the boy’s grave and up to Moulton. Would you believe it, some chap just followed him in a car.\n\n“He stopped outside Warren Place [Cecil’s former yard] and just started to pick at Henry’s hedge. Meanwhile I had jumped off my hack and into someone’s car. On my way up, there was a phone call from Henry to the office: ‘Well, he’s come up here because he wants to be trained by a proper trainer.’” Stoute busts into one of several fits of laughter. “Anyway, I get up there and I find him. His shoes have ground down to nothing. So we brought him back, checked him, poulticed him for 48 hours and watched him. Then bump-biddy-bump… he wins the King George.”\n\nCrystal Ocean is the world’s top-rated horse in his class but takes on Enable, the dual Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe winner ridden by Frankie Dettori, who accompanied Crystal Ocean to his first Group win at Royal Ascot (James Doyle takes over now). Stoute, who trained his first winner in 1972 but remains as keen as ever, is guarded in public but wildly entertaining in the more intimate surroundings of his Freemason Lodge stables.\n\nHis determination to avoid being kissed by Dettori for example is, in Stoute’s hands, comedy gold. “I am six times second in the f------ St Leger and Frankie comes in to ride Conduit,” Stoute begins. “The Weinstock family [the owners] are there. Frankie says: ‘Your trainer – he has tried Fred Archer, Charlie Smirke, Gordon Richards, Lester Piggott…He’s finally come to me and I am going to win it for you.’ But do you know what? He is very appreciative. He knew that meant a lot [winning the Leger]. He came in that night and had a couple of glasses of champagne and said ‘Thanks for the ride.” And the kiss was landed in the end.\n\nStoute, ten-times the champion Flat trainer, has won the King George with Shergar, Opera House, Golan, Conduit, Harbinger and Poet’s Word. He calls Harbinger’s 11-length win in 2010 “the best middle-distance performance any of my horses have ever achieved” - which is some compliment, given Shergar’s stunning record.\n\n“He [Harbinger] was dynamite that day,” Stoute says. “Look at the horses who were behind him. It was just unbelievable what he did. He came into the straight absolutely cantering, Olivier Peslier was looking left and right – in a King George. The Derby winner was there, other decent horses. Peslier came to ride him a week before and he said to me ‘nothing will beat him.’ Sadly his first piece of work after that victory [he clicks his fingers] – gone. That was it.”\n\nA close friend of Michael Holding, the former West Indies fast bowler, and a trainer to the Queen and Sir Alex Ferguson, Stoute is unfailingly discreet. Asked what wisdom Ferguson might have imparted, he heaves with laughter as he brings his hand slamming down on the interviewer’s knee: “He told me not to tell you!” He was also seduced by Brian Clough’s charisma after moving to England from his native Barbados in 1966: “I thought, I have to follow that man.”\n\nBut on the gallops and around the yard, this is a deadly serious master trainer, especially of middle-distance horses who benefit from patient handling. He says: “You don’t always get it right, believe you me. There are a lot of myths – or f--- ups. But if you have an owner who is prepared to be patient…”\n\nFixing his thoughts on Crystal Ocean he says: “It’s a joy to bring a horse like that along. The Rothschilds are well rooted in this game. I suppose Ascot was as good a performance as he has ever given but there were some very high-class ones last year. He was just touched off in the King George by Poet’s Word.”\n\nHe still remembers his first winner in 1972 - “Sandal, at Newmarket” - and says: “Oh, yes, the excitement is still there particularly when you see something come to fruition. You never lose your love of the game or that zest for success.” But power shifts have forced him to look for a way round the vast resources of rival yards, chiefly the Aidan O’Brien team in Ireland.\n\n“Oh well, that is formidable of course,” he says. “And John Gosden has built up a seriously successful organisation with a lot of horses. We have 150. We can accommodate that number with two yards. We are happy with that. We do three lots [on the gallops]. Nowadays there are some doing four, five, six, seven lots. I won’t go down that route. Of course I want to be competitive and I want to be successful in big races but we will never be champion trainer again. I had my ding-dong with Henry but I will never get into that bracket again.”\n\nThe Cecil-Stoute duel entranced Flat racing. “Yeeaahh! It was a tough rivalry, that’s exactly what it was,” Stoute says, adding modestly: “He won.” He has fought the biggest rivals and employed the finest jockeys: “I’m very fortunate, I have had the best of them. I started with Greville [Starkey], who rode my first Classic winner. Then there was [the late Walter] Swinburn, who could be a lot of trouble but had a lot of talent. Then we moved on. Kieren Fallon. When he was injured, we had Johnny Murtagh and Mick Kinane coming over from Ireland. We also had really good horses. Then Ryan [Moore] pops along. Well, we went for Ryan.”\n\nMoore’s distinguishing features, Stoute says, are “natural talent” and “dedication” - “his preparation and his knowledge. He is just a thorough professional – and a bright man. He prepares impeccably – and Frankie is p------ him off right now [with his run of big wins].” The laughter rolls again. Now you see how he has managed the stress of training winners for 47 years.\n\nThe King George VI and Queen Elizabeth QIPCO Stakes is part of the QIPCO British Champions Series.\n\nWill you be betting on the Grand National?
