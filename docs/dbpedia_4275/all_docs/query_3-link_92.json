        "text": "Akamai Technologies is acquiring Noname Security! It's difficult to summarize the last four years of such an amazing company in a post, so I will focus on the people who have been there through this journey. I will start with Gili Raanan; no words can describe what you mean to me: investor, board member, partner, friend, and family. You are a teacher, an amazing person, and an inspiration. We would never have achieved even 10% of what we have achieved without you, and for the founders out there, if you even consider working with someone else, please talk to me first. Guru Chahal, Thomas Krane, and Steve Leightell, you have been there for me through the highs and lows. You have taught me about product, finance, sales, and scale, and how to build a great company, and I'm so happy that we have become friends. I can't thank you enough for everything you have done for me. I love you and hope we will have the chance to work together. Michael Baker, you have been there with me since almost day one. No one loves more than you, learns more than you, and persists more than you. You are an amazing leader, salesperson, executive, and friend. I love you with all of my heart and am so happy we get to continue our journey together. I can't thank Noname's leadership and employees enough. We have achieved so much together, and it's thanks to your dedication, creativity, and hard work. You never gave up, never slowed down, and always tried to do more. I'm so proud to say that I have had the chance to work with such a talented group and so happy to continue working with you. We would have never built this company without Meitar | Law Offices Itay Frishman, Avinoam Fachler, Iael Bak, Nextage, Nevo Ramati,Hila Lebenthal EY Naama Mairanowski, and many more. Thank you so much for everything you have done for us. I also have to thank our hundreds of customers and partners, those of you who have been with us since day one, trusted us, and supported us. We will continue to build, innovate, and have the best API Security product in the world. Shay Levi, The journey started with you and ended with you. I love you so much. You taught me so much of what I know. You are so smart and talented. I have no doubt you will build the most amazing company in the world. Now I'm going to be part of an incredible organization. I'm proud to be part of Akamai. Rupesh Chokshi and Mani Sundaram, I appreciate the trust and can't wait to work with you."
