        "text": "The news that two sitting Directors of the Board of the Barbados Olympic Association (BOA) have decided to challenge entrenched incumbents Steve Stoute (president) and (secretary general) is good news. The pace of change in todays world mandates that we infused the leadership of any organization that wants to remain relevant with new blood.\n\nSteve Stoute has served as president for 16 years and before that as secretary general since 1968! Erskine Simmons has been a director since 1986 and gained the post of secretary general in 1996. It should be noted Erskine is the nephew of Michael Simmons who was the founding secretary general of the BOA in the 80s. A little legacy has developed it seems.\n\nLet BU cut to the chase and continue our view about the BOA management hierarchy – see Time For Steve Stoute To Step Down. We congratulate Lieutenant Trevor Browne and Craig Archer for having the gumption to stand up to the two incumbents who represent the ‘establishment’, especially Browne. It is unfortunate given where Barbados finds itself on the ladder of sports that Messrs Stoute and Simmons would NOT have declined to run for another four year term but we have come to expect this behaviour from those who lead our sports agencies. BU also take the opportunity to suggest to Erskine ‘Boozer’ King at the National Sports Council that he should step aside. By doing so there is room for earth making decisions to take place in local sports.\n\nPlease see the biographies of the those contesting the positions of President and secretary general of the BOA:."
