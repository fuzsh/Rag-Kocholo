        "text": "With Ryan Moore confirmed for Conduit, the 2-1 favourite, Stoute has booked Mick Kinane for 4-1 chance Tartan Bearer.\n\nThe Newmarket trainer has also engaged Olivier Peslier for third string Ask, despite the Frenchman having come in for criticism last year for his ride on the Stoute-trained runner-up Papal Bull. Critics argued that Peslier's finishing burst was premature though most conceded that Papal Bull was 'quirky,' even on his best days.\n\nKinane is the most successful modern-day jockey in Ascot's King George, with five wins. His first two wins in the race were for Henry Cecil – Belmez (1990) and King's Theatre (1994), but it was his third victory that will live long with genuine racing fans.\n\nThe Irishman partnered Montjeu, whose brilliance shone like a beacon in the humiliating defeat he inflicted on Fantastic Light, a genuinely top-class racehorse, back in 2000. A year later, Kinane rode Galileo (to again beat Fantastic Light), and in 2005 he won the race a fifth time, on Azamour when the race was run at Newbury.\n\nKinane became available when John Oxx decided that Sea The Stars would bypass Ascot in favour of the Juddmonte International at York and the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown, plus one more race before the colt is retired to stud.\n\nIn the days of multiple entries from Ballydoyle, it is hardly unusual for one trainer to have such a strong hand. But Stoute is more inclined to spread them around, aiming at various targets, particularly when owned in similar interests, though not on this occasion.\n\nIs it a concern to Stoute that he has three major chances in the King George? \"No, I just wish I had four,\" he laughed. \"Conduit and Tartan Bearer worked [separately] on Saturday, and I'm very happy with them.\"\n\nStoute is always on weather-watch with the talented Ask, who scraped home for a memorable last-stride win in the Coronation Cup at Epsom. \"But his owner (Pat Fahy) tells me there will be some rain, which is good news,\" the trainer added.\n\nStoute has won the King George three times – Shergar, ridden by Walter Swinburn in 1981, Opera House, ridden by Michael Roberts in 1993, and Golan, partnered by Kieren Fallon in 2002.\n\nThe win with Golan, owned like Conduit and Tartan Bearer by the late Lord Weinstock's Ballymacoll Stud, was a great achievement as the colt was resuming after a long lay-off and fought courageously to get the better of Nayef in a protracted struggle to the line.\n\nAt Newbury, Richard Hannon's judgment with his juveniles proved spot on when Monsieur Chevalier gave him his seventh win in the Weatherbys Super Sprint. But he had much to thank his son-in-law Richard Hughes for; Hughes gave the two-year-old one of the best rides seen this season.\n\nWatching Brief by Marlborough\n\nClear Chance: Bomber Brown (2.15 Yarmouth) was unlucky to encounter the smart Laaheb – a winner again since – when runner-up here last time. He finished six lengths clear of the third that day and is patently capable of winning a run-of-the-mill maiden such as this.\n\nGold Strike: Having won in good style over this course and distance in May, Luminous Gold (3.45 Yarmouth) then improved to finish fourth from a poor draw in a better race at Folkestone. Dropped down in grade once more, this progressive filly can regain winning form.\n\nLeading Light: Honimiere (6.30 Beverley) proved she acts well on a stiff track like this when winning at Carlisle two starts back and then returned a career-best effort in a strongly-run affair at Doncaster. Front-running tactics suit her and she might well lead all the way.\n\nLearning Curve: Once she realised what was required on her debut, L’Enchanteresse (7.20 Windsor) finished strongly in a decent Newmarket maiden. She should have learned plenty from the experience."
