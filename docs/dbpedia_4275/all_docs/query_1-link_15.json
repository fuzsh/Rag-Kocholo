        "text": "Today's best bets, by Chris Cook\n\n\"The best horse always wins the Derby,\" is one of those mind-numbingly glib things that people in racing often say, but Epsom has never looked like a fair track to me and every year there are horses in the Derby who lose all chance by being unable to cope with its tricky contours.\n\nIf you want a fair racecourse, The Curragh would be a lot higher up the list. Big, wide and galloping, it generally gives the horses all the space they need to sort themselves out into an accurate pecking order, though you still get the odd stramash, as when Alessandro Volta drunkenly rolled off the rail and mullered Tartan Bearer and Curtain Call in last year's Irish Derby.\n\nTalking Horses is disposed to believe that Frozen Fire would have won anyway, but that may be because the 16-1 shot was tipped in this space that day. We also had the 10-1 winner of the Summer National, and only one losing tip. Great days.\n\nIt almost seems a pity to mention it, since there is no chance of similar fireworks today. Masterofthehorse (4.20) is just 3-1 to land the Irish Derby, but they can't all be flashy outsiders.\n\nI was on Fame And Glory at Epsom, in the expectation that Aidan O'Brien's pacemakers would ensure a strong pace and a proper test of stamina. It was hugely frustrating to watch Golden Sword chug along at a snail's pace through the first half-mile, virtually handing the race to the classy acceleration of Sea The Stars.\n\nSince then, it seems like there's a conspiracy of people trying to drive me mad by insisting that Sea The Stars would have won, however the race had been run. Tom Segal in today's Racing Post is the latest. But how in blue blazes do you know? That horse's stamina, we all agreed, was the one potential weak spot before the race, and it went entirely untested. If it had been tested, it may have let him down, or held up – by all means have an opinion, but don't pretend you know for sure. Nobody does and anyone who claims they do is a charlatan.\n\nThat being said, it seems to me that Fame And Glory may not have run the best race among the beaten horses, even though he came second. Richard Hughes had steadied Masterofthehorse so far off the steady pace that he only had two behind him at the turn into the straight, but his mount flew home to finish just a neck behind Fame And Glory.\n\nYes, he was a bit lucky with the way a path opened up for him among those in front, but the horse showed really impressive speed. Had there been a proper gallop, he may well have finished in front of Fame And Glory, who looked a little short of pace.\n\nClearly, I'm not going to want to remember this year's Derbys if Fame And Glory comes home in front but, at the odds, I'd much rather be on his stablemate. Masterofthehorse is ridden this time by Seamus Heffernan, who has had the good fortune to win the last two Irish Derbys on second or third-strings from the O'Brien yard. His mount today has a much more obvious chance than the last two.\n\nMourayan has finished behind Fame And Glory on both starts this year, which makes him untempting, despite first-time blinkers. Gan Amhras completely failed to cope with Epsom and has to be respected on his Guineas third, but he was apparently ready for that race and may not be progressing at the same rate as some of his rivals.\n\nGolden Sword may get to run on his own merits today. He's been given a soft lead as a pacemaker on his last two runs, which probably flatters him, and his overall form does not look good enough.\n\nAt 37-1 on Betfair, the really interesting outsider is Recharge, who beat Intense Focus in March when all the other runners from that rival's yard were at the top of their games. Recharge flopped on heavy going in the Irish Guineas but it won't be anything like that soft today and may even dry out to good going. He's bred to be a 10-furlong horse, so he probably won't stay, but he has the necessary class and his big odds make him a tempting saver.\n\nThey will barely have crossed the line in Ireland before the tapes go up for the Summer National at Uttoxeter. It's not very adventurous but, at 5-1, Sea Wall (4.25) is a bigger price than I was expecting for what does not seem a very competitive race. Jonjo O'Neill's runners are flying and this is a summer horse who will relish the 'good to firm in places'.\n\nSince the Racing Post are going to start charging for their website, it seems fair to say how disappointing it is that the site can't tell me the past 10 winners of the Summer National, or the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. 'No previous runnings of this race,' it says.\n\nI can exclusively reveal that Youmzain won the Saint-Cloud race last year, and he is favourite to do so again. But 6-4 seems a tad short, considering that was his only success since September 2006, and I'd much rather be on Curtain Call (3.30) at 11-1. Luca Cumani's runner won a Group Three in Ireland on his reappearance but was taken off his feet over nine furlongs last time. This return to a mile and a half should suit.\n\n1.15pm Hi 23skidoo\n\nA very fair point re the Uttoxeter race, I'm sure that is the reason. Still, I'd rather be able to see the last 10 winners of the race that has carried the same name and has been run under broadly similar conditions.\n\nTheWinningLineUk, you appear to be seething about something. If you read it again, you'll see I didn't claim that Fame And Glory would have won with a stronger pace - in fact, my point was the same as yours, that Masterofthehorse may well have beaten him.\n\n3.15pm O'Brien wins the Railway Stakes, of course\n\nAmazing. That's an 11th win for Aidan O'Brien in the last 13 runnings of this Group Two race. This time, victory goes to Alfred Nobel, who was made 6-4 favourite despite one or two others seeming to have better form claims. Why would you bet against the O'Brien runner when his record reads like it does?\n\nHis past winners have included Rock Of Gibraltar, George Washington, Holy Roman Emperor and Mastercraftsman, but Alfred Nobel doesn't look likely to progress as they did after this fourth racecourse outing. He carried his head on one side through the last quarter-mile.\n\nHe is best-priced 25-1 with Ladbrokes for next year's 2,000 Guineas.\n\n3.45pm Group One glory for exiled Spanish Moon\n\nSpanish Moon came home like a good 'un in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud, so that's another £220,000 in the hod for Sir Michael Stoute and Ryan Moore. The horse may be trained in Newmarket but he's banned from running in Britain until November, having refused to go in the stalls three times in the past year. Stoute had a wee dig in today's Racing Post, saying: \"We're coming because the handlers in France are very professional.\"\n\nYoumzain and Curtain Call ran fair races to be third and fourth, just behind Alpine Rose in second.\n\n4.25pm Fame And Glory wins Irish Derby\n\nAll the money was for the favourite and the money was right. Fame And Glory finished well to beat Golden Sword to give Aidan O'Brien a 1-2 and his seventh Irish Derby, a training record. Mourayan was third, Masterofthehorse a distant fourth and Recharge fifth.\n\nRockhampton set a furious gallop, with Golden Sword trailing him. Fame And Glory was settled well back, with Masterofthehorse just behind him.\n\nGolden Sword went to the front at the top of the straight but Fame And Glory was already moving up and the race was quickly over. It's still hard to know how good the winner is, since he has mostly beaten his stablemates today, but he must be a contender for races like the King George and the Arc. Golden Sword has really proved himself today, keeping on well after racing prominently behind a strong gallop. Masterofthehorse found disappointingly little in the straight and is now appears flattered by his Epsom effort.\n\n4.35pm Fire And Rain (7-1) lands Summer National\n\nEmma Lavelle's six-year-old racked up a hat-trick over fences last season but was beaten more than 30 lengths when last seen over obstacles, at Wincanton in April. Maybe he just needed a wee break. Lavelle can certainly train handicap chasers and you'd think she'd be the type to win a National one day if she could improve the material she gets to work with.\n\nThe King Of Angels, Keenan's Future and Rackalackey filled the places. Sea Wall went well in front for a long way but was being rowed along and finding little when McCoy suddenly pulled him up, looking down at one of the horse's hind legs. Here's hoping he's ok.\n\n6.15pm Hi kvms\n\nYou may have been sure that Sea The Stars had the stamina for the Derby - aren't you clever - but his trainer John Oxx wasn't. \"To win a Derby, you've got to stay and we just don't know for sure he will,\" Oxx said, the week beforehand.\n\nMost commentators agree that the race was run at a steady pace, it's not just my view, though it's hard to analyse this properly in the absence of sectional times. Writing in the Racing Post, James Willoughby had this to say: \"Coarsely expressed, the Derby turned into a downhill sprint in which a 2,000 Guineas winner was given a running start over the stayer Fame And Glory, and did not defeat him any further than when he started the dash.\"\n\nI'm not saying Sea The Stars definitely doesn't stay a mile and a half, but, at the odds, I was prepared to bet against him doing so in the Derby. Having done that, of course, I was dismayed to see the way the race panned out. Maybe he would have won in any case, but no one can be certain about that.\n\nAnd we may never find out, since connections seem to want to keep him to 10 furlongs from now on. That's sensible - Oxx reckons it's the \"perfect distance\" for him and there's no need to risk proving he doesn't actually stay further when he's already won the Derby.\n\nClick here for all the day's racecards, form, stats and results.\n\nAnd click here for today's latest odds.\n\nAnd post your racing-related comments below."
