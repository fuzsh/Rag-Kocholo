        "text": "Johnny Murtagh has been booked to ride Golan in the Japan Cup, worth £1.6m to the winner, in Tokyo on Sunday week. He takes over from Kieren Fallon, who is wintering in Japan but whose retainer with the horse's trainer, Sir Michael Stoute, has not been renewed.\n\nMurtagh, tipped to replace Fallon at Freemason Lodge before it was announced there would be no retained jockey, enjoyed big-race success for Stoute last year with Kalanisi, Daliapour and Petrushka.\n\nGolan won the 2,000 Guineas under Fallon at Newmarket in May and has since made the frame in the Vodafone Derby and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, as well as winning the Prix Niel at Longchamp.\n\nBehrajan, 7-1 second favourite for Saturday's Thomas Pink Gold Cup at Cheltenham, is expected to miss the race for the Edward Hanmer Handicap Chase at Haydock the following day.\n\n·Aidan O'Brien landed a remarkable 23rd Group or Grade One winner of the year Criterium de Saint-Cloud in Paris with Castle Gandolfo second and Black Sam Bellamy third.\n\nThe victory was O'Brien's ninth win in the top 10 two-year-old races of the season with his Landseer finishing runner-up in the other."
