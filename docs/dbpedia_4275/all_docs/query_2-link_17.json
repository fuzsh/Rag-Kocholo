        "text": "The venue is different, and so too is the distance of the race, but the outcome could be the same when Golan and Nayef go head to head in today's Juddmonte International Stakes at York.\n\nWhen the pair produced one of the best finishes of the King George at Ascot last month Kieren Fallon brought Golan from last to first to beat Nayef by a head. That, of course, was over one and a half miles and with two furlongs less to travel Marcus Tregoning, trainer of Nayef, is confident that revenge will be sweet this afternoon.\n\n\"I think the trip will suit my horse better than Golan,\" says the Lambourn trainer. \"I'm really looking forward to it.\"\n\nAnother reason why Tregoning is in a confident mood is the fact the Nayef puts his best foot forward at this time of the season. Last year, after finishing third in the Gordon Stakes on the final day of July, he rattled off four consecutive victories culminating with a threequarters of a length win over Tobougg in the 10-furlong Champion Stakes at Newmarket in October.\n\nNayef's CV is attractive, but it does not match that of Golan. Last year he kicked off with a victory in the 2,000 Guineas, was second in the English Derby, third in the Irish equivalent (both won by Galileo) and fourth in the Arc.\n\nHis final race last year proved a trip too far when he finished sixth in the Japan Cup in November.\n\nA setback earlier this year denied him an outing before the King George, but to win Ascot's prestigious race at the first time of asking says as much for Golan as it does for the training skills of Sir Michael Stoute.\n\nWith Golan and Nayef both around the 6-4 mark, such odds represent 1-4 about either of them winning, but it is hard to envisage any of the others mounting a serious challenge. The only dark cloud is the record of top horses who failed to progress after a hard race in the King George - notably Grundy and Bustino - who fought out an epic finish in 1975.\n\nAfter his gut-bursting victory, Grundy ran only once more, finishing a moderate fourth to Dahlia in today's race when it was called the Benson & Hedge's Gold Cup, while Bustino never ran again.\n\nWith Tregoning reporting Nayef in great shape and Golan, who never shows a great deal on the gallops, giving Stoute all the right signs, we should be in for a treat.\n\nThe distance may be shorter, but with the long Knavesmire straight and a classy pacemaker in Starbourne, the race could be set up for Golan (2.55). But it could be mighty close.\n\nAnother rematch is on the cards in the Weatherbys Insurance Lonsdale Stakes with the Goodwood Cup 1-2, Jardines Lookout and Give Notice dominating the proceedings.\n\nJardines Lookout returned to form when getting the better of the argument in the Goodwood marathon, beating Give Notice by one and a half lengths.\n\nGive Notice (2.20) did not have the best of runs, being carried out right at the two furlong marker, and now with a 3lb advantage is fancied to reverse the placings.\n\nThe Great Voltigeur Stakes provides Bandari (3.30) a chance to enhance his St Leger prospects. Mark Johnston's three-year-old put his disappointing performance in the Derby well behind when scoring by seven lengths from First Charter at Goodwood last month and should prove too strong for these rivals.\n\nJohnston could complete a great day by landing a treble with Bourbonnais in the opening Paradine Acomb Stakes and Nuit Sombre in the Ger rad Wealth Management Eglinton Nursery.\n\nBourbonnais (1.45) started his career with an impressive five length win over course and distance last month when he beat My Fas by five lengths.\n\nHe lost nothing in defeat at Goodwood next time out when going under by a length and a quarter to Dublin and is preferred to easy Doncaster winner, Wahsheeq.\n\nNuit Sombre (4.30) improves with every race and can complete the hat-trick. He made short work of the opposition in an auction maiden event at Ayr last month and then followed up in some style at Newcastle 13 days ago.\n\nDespite receiving a bump at the start, he came with a strong run to lead at the furlong marker to win by one and a half lengths from Phamedic."
