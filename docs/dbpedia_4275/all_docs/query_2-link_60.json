        "text": "High Chaparral winner of the Turf with Mick Kinane up.\n\nWorld Thoroughbred Championships\n\nBreeders' Cup Turf Results\n\nDate: 10/26/02 Juvenile Juv.Fillies Sprint Distaff F&M Turf Mile Turf Classic\n\nSurprisingly only eight horses entered this $2 million Grade 1 event, with Epsom Derby winner High Chaparral from the powerful Coolmore stable of Aidan O'Brien sent off as the huge 9-10 favorite. Also in the race were the highly regarded American representative With Anticipation at 8-1 and Sir Michael Stoute trainee Golan the 4-1 second choice.\n\nAfter the break, 14-1 shot The Tin Man set the early pace, leading for the first 10 furlongs with fractions of 25.69, 51.36, 1:17.01, 1:41.33, and 2:05.99, with 9-1 shot and Canadian International winner Ballingarry stalking in behind him. But the two pacesetters were no match when the late runners began their charges. The Tin Man was done in mid stretch and faded to fourth, while Ballingarry weakened at the top of the stretch and finished seventh. With Anticipation, held up in the rear early, made headway with three furlongs to go and collared The Tin Man to get second. High Chaparral came from fifth early, gained the lead a furlong out, and drew away to win by 1 1/4 lengths over With Anticipation. It was another 3/4 lengths back to another closer, Falcon Flight, in third. The final time was 2:30.14 for the 1 1/2 miles over the yielding turf.\n\nThe John Deere Turf\n\nPurse: $2,000,000 Distance: 1 1/2 miles turf\n\nPgm Horse Jockey Win Place Show 5 High Chaparral Kinane 3.80 3.00 2.60 7 With Anticipation Day 5.20 4.20 3 Falcon Flight Valenzuela 5.20\n\nHigh Chaparral lived up to his favoritism with a 1 1/4 lenght win in the Turf.\n\nWinning Time: 2:30.14 $2 Exacta 5-7 34.80 $2 Trifecta 5-7-3 233.20 $1 Superfecta 5-7-3-8 780.50 $2 Head2Head 3 over 10 2.20 Results chart Race 9\n\nFirst time by in the Turf with The Tin Man out front followed by Ballingarry, Denon, and Perfect Soul. Mike Smith who rode The Tin Man said: \"My horse ran a great race. He was in the clear but he propped twice - each time he came toward the overhead wire and it cost me at least two lengths.\"\n\nHigh Chaparral circles with his flowers before entering the winner's circle. Jockey Mick Kinane said, \"He is lazy. You really have to get after him. I thought we'd be going quicker. I expected Ballingarry to be setting a faster pace, but that didn't happen, so I saw [With Anticipation] come up the outside and I knew it was time to go to work. Then he really let it go. He's the kind of horse that has loads saved. He's all class.\"\n\nHigh Chaparral in the winner's circle. Trainer Aidan O'Brien said, \"We are delighted. We've always thought he was a high class horse. He ran his own race and he quickened really well when he was asked. I was a little concerned early when he got shuffled back but he got out at the right time and picked it up really late. He's been doing this all year.\"\n\nHigh Chaparral in the post parade. Trainer Aidan O'Brien said: \"He was very sick in the middle of the summer. I think it was a testimony to the horse really that he even turned up today, but we saw what he can do and it showed today.\"\n\nSecond place finisher With Anticipation in the post parade. Trainer Jonathan Sheppard said, \"I'm very proud of him. He ran a tremendously courageous race. He ran he best he possibly could. Our horse is a tremendous horse but he's not an English Derby winner.\" Jockey Pat Day added, \"Jonathan said I should lay behind High Chaparral. He settled nicely for me and Jonathan called it right. I had a pretty good hold on him, he was on the bridle and wanted to run.\"\n\nThird place finisher Falcon Flight. Jockey Pat Valenzuela said, \"Turning for home I thought I had a hell of a shot. He really kicked in and ran a great race. In his last race he was a little rank, but he realized really good today.\" Trainer Donald Burke added, \"If the turf had been firmer it might have helped the pace scenario but the winner is arguably THE turf horse out of Europe. I think my horse proved he deserved [to be here] and I don't think anyone can argue with that.\"\n\nJuvenile Juv.Fillies Sprint Distaff F&M Turf Mile Turf Classic\n\nMore Breeders' Cup info:\n\nBreeders' Cup Wagering - a new record for total handle was set, but an investigation has been requested into the strange circumstances surrounding the winning Pick 6 wagers placed at an OTB in New York NEW!
