        "text": "Moshe was born in Cairo, Egypt, on the 27th of Tevet 5727 (27.12.1946) to his parents Chana and Yehoshua Goldenberg, with whom he immigrated to Israel after the establishment of the State of Israel. He spent his childhood and youth in Magdiel-Hod Hasharon in the regular track of primary and secondary education. In addition to his studies, he was active in the Hanoar Haoved movement, passed a Gadna commanders’ course and developed his special talents in writing, art and music. In 1965, Moshe enlisted in the IDF and served in the Armored Corps, completing training courses for the IAF: basic training, vocational courses at the Armored Corps School, officers ‘course and the company commanders’ course. During his ten years of military service, Moshe held a number of operational positions and training and command posts. His last position in the IDF was a brigade sergeant officer. Moshe fought in the Six-Day War, the War of Attrition and the Yom Kippur War. In 1975, Moshe was discharged from the IDF with the rank of major and joined the General Security Service, where he served as an “anonymous soldier” for five years, a member of the “secret warriors” in the Israeli intelligence community. For nearly half of his life Moshe devoted himself to the security of Israel, and at the same time built a house in Magdiel and established a magnificent family. In 1968, Moshe married his childhood friend, Bunia nee Beaver, and they had three children: Eitan, Alona and Ariella. His son, Eitan and his daughters, Alona and Ariella, who grew up in the shadow of memory and in light of his beautiful, beloved and revered figure, constitute a living monument to Moses, the salt of the earth. Moshe fell during his service in the Shin Bet during secret operational activity on 11 Tamuz, 25 June 1980. He was thirty-four years old when he fell, and was brought to rest in the military section of the Magdiel cemetery."
