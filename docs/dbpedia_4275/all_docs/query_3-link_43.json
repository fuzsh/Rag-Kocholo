She is a founding member of the Buteyko Breathing Educators Association (BBEA). Having suffered from asthma since childhood, she decided to take the Buteyko course in 2006 and is now free of any asthma-related drug or symptom. Hadas works at Boston University Medical Center in the Department of Otolaryngology, specializing in voice disorders and the care of professional voice. She also runs a private practice primarily working with patients on Buteyko breathing. She also offers educator training programs.\n\nCombining breath work, hands-on techniques, gentle movement, voice work, physical exercise guidance, and life-style changes, Hadas helps her clients become self-aware of their habitual patterns that lead to dysfunction and symptoms, and teaches skills and strategies that will enable them to take active control of their health."
