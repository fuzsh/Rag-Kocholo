        "text": "Stoute was close to Golan's owner-breeder Lord Weinstock, who died last Tuesday, and while the win marked a triumphant turnaround in the four-year-old's fortunes on the racecourse, it was all a little hollow without the great man himself being there.\n\n\"The occasion was tinged with sadness for me,\" Stoute said yesterday. \"The King George is the sort of race that Lord Weinstock wanted to win. He was a great traditionalist. He had high ideals for his horses and his stud.\n\n\"I remember being extremely disappointed that we were unable to win it for him with Pilsudski,\" the trainer recalled. There must have been moments during Saturday's race when Stoute suspected it might be a similar story with Golan.\n\nKieren Fallon sat at the rear of the field and needed luck on his side to make progress approaching the home bend. Fortunately, the breaks came and he secured a passage along the inside rail, going around only one horse, before taking a split to deliver his challenge over a furlong out.\n\nNayef had taken up the running inside the two-furlong marker, and he showed great fighting qualities in his attempt to repel Golan, who edged to the front close home to win by a head.\n\nFallon played down his efforts in the saddle.\n\n\"The splits came and I got lucky,\" said the champion jockey. \"The horse is tough and he wanted to win this race.\n\n\"I don't know why because usually when he gets to the front he pricks his ears and thinks he has done enough. But his head was down and he really wanted it.\n\n\"I was under orders to go on the inside. It went through my mind coming into the straight, but the boss said you don't win races by going around horses. It was far better to stick by what he said.\"\n\nThere will be no rush to plot a campaign for Golan for the rest of the season, Stoute was eager to point out.\n\nLord Weinstock sold a major share in Golan to Coolmore last year, and with both High Chaparral and Hawk Wing, two Aidan O'Brien-trained colts also destined to stand at the same stud, great care will be taken to ensure this high-priced trio do not devalue each other by unnecessary defeat. Do not expect any early decisions or plans for Golan, whose optimum trip might well prove to be a mile and a quarter.\n\nSaturday's King George completely restored the reputation of both Golan and Nayef, the former having won last year's English 2,000 Guineas, and the latter having been winter favourite for the same Classic.\n\nNayef looks to be heading to York next month for the Juddmonte International, thus setting up a fascinating clash with the highly-regarded Hawk Wing. Marcus Tregoning, Nayef's trainer, said yesterday: \"I'm very keen on York because I feel the track would really suit the horse. He's at the top of his game and lost no weight at all.\"\n\nAfter that, he could be on his way to America. \"I'd really like to go to Chicago (for the Breeders' Cup) as I think the track will suit him.\n\n\"It is 30 hours door-to-door for the journey so it is a bit daunting but I think he is worthy of it. It just might be that he goes for the Classic as he was very effective on dirt in Dubai.\"\n\nFinally, a word about the Ascot going. All week, it appeared unlikely the weather was going to break, and eventually that is the way it turned out to be. Nick Cheyne, the clerk of the course, was not going to fall into the trap of watering significantly earlier in the week, while there was any threat of a late cloud burst. His experience told him that would be disaster.\n\nBut with three runners' connections expressing an intention to drop out 24 hours before the King George and yet another saying they were concerned about running the race seemed to be falling apart.\n\nCheyne then ordered enough watering to ensure the going was safe for the big day. He appeared to overdo it, leading to complaints from some of the jockeys, notably Frankie Dettori.\n\n\"We've ended up running the wrong horse,\" he said. \"If we'd known it was going to be like this we should have run Sakhee.\n\n\"They were just strung out like jumpers today. He slipped, stumbled and just didn't like this ground.\n\n\"I know you can't please everybody, but the ground was good, not firm like Friday and it just comes down to them over-watering the ground.\"\n\nDaily Telegraph, London and other agencies."
