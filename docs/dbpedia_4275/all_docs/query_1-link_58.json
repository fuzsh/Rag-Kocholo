        "text": "Aidan’s thoughts on Minding\n\nBy Red\n\nAidan was non-committal when asked if he has trained a better filly in the past two decades, he said: “She's great, isn't she? I'm not sure if we've had a more resilient filly and we've been delighted with her this season. I'm not sure what her best distance is. We know she has the pace for the top league at a mile and we know she gets a mile and a half. She's also comfortable in between at a mile and quarter, which is lovely. It's very unusual to be so adaptable.\n\nShe's progressing with every run and is a very strong traveller. We are very happy with her going into Saturday, but have not looked beyond it. It's one race at a time, let's see how she comes out of the race.” Minding is set to encounter the fastest conditions she has faced so far this season, but connections do not see it as a problem, particularly after persistent rain on Thursday. \"All anybody wants is safe ground and Seamus (Buckley, clerk of the course) will keep it safe. That's what everyone wants for every horse,\" said Aidan. Coolmore's UK representative Kevin Buckley was glowing in his praise of the brilliant filly.\n\nHe said: \"She handled it (10 furlongs) perfectly last time. She's the perfect racehorse - absolutely fantastic. She's so versatile and can handle anything. You can never count your chickens, but it's the perfect race for her.\"\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSwordfighter and Colm 5th in the Goodwood Cup\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIntelligence Cross & Ryan Moore 3rd in the Richmond Stakes (G2) at Goodwood\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHe's A Record Breaker\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAidan has a Very healthy lead in the British Flat Trainers Championship to say the least\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRhododendron blooms in the Goodwood gloom\n\nBy Red\n\nRhododendron won the Dove 100 colours EBF British Stallion Studs Maiden fillies stakes at Goodwood by 1 ¾ lengths from Amabilis. The filly is another winner for her sire Galileo who is in the middle of a purple patch. She tracked the leaders throughout the race sitting in midfield and was pushed along over 2 furlongs out, where she made headway down the outside to take 2nd just over a furlong out, she ran a bit green, she led inside the last 150 yards and was soon clear of the rest of the field she stayed on well.\n\nJ P Magnier, son of co-owner Sue Magnier, was happy with the performance of Rhododendron after the race.\n\n\"Ryan said that she felt like she hadn't had much of a race,\" said Magnier.\n\n\"There's plenty of improvement in her by the looks of it. It's amazing what Galileo has been doing over the past few weeks.\n\n\"We'll take her back to Ireland and there's plenty of options for her there.\n\n\"I didn't see her goose stepping around the paddock but they tell me it's a sign of well-being when they do that. Zenyatta used to do it so hopefully that's a good omen!\"\n\nMagnier also had news of Intelligence Cross, who finished a well-beaten third behind Mehmas in the Qatar Richmond Stakes earlier on the card.\n\n\"Ryan wasn't overly happy when he got off Intelligence Cross - he said he was a bit sore. \"We'll take him home and check him out - hopefully he'll be fine\n\nRyan Moore, registering his third victory of the week, said of the two-year-old: \"Rhododendron is a smart filly. She picked up very well when I asked her and she is another filly with a good future.\n\n\"It's only her second run today. She picked up very well and travelled really well. I'm sure Aidan will get her home and see where she goes afterwards.\"\n\nMoore also suggested the rain which has fallen at the Sussex venue today has started to affect the going. He added: \"It's loose ground now and not all the horses are comfortable on it.\"\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMinding to make it 6 in the Nassau\n\nBy Red\n\nMinding faces just four rivals as she goes in search of a sixth Group One victory in the Qatar Nassau Stakes at Goodwood on Saturday at 3.10. Her opponents are Beautiful Romance, Jemeyal, Queen's Trust and Swiss Range. Minding will be running in her fifth race this year, she has already made two successful attempts in Britain this year when landing the Qipco 1000 Guineas at Newmarket before following up with victory in the Investec Oaks at Epsom. Last seen when beating her elders in the Group 1 Sea The Stars Pretty Polly Stakes at the Curragh at the end of June. Aidan has won the Nassau twice in the past with Peeping Fawn in 2007 and Halfway to Heaven in 2008. Currently 2/7 with Stan James\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWashington DC for the King George\n\nBy Red\n\nAidan’s Zoffany colt Washington DC will run at the Goodwood Festival Tomorrow in the Group 2 Qatar King George stakes over 5 furlongs.\n\nHe will be having his seventh run of the year, winning two of them The Listed Text your bets to Paddy Power on 51465 stakes over 7 furlongs and the Listed Coolmore Stud Power stakes over 6 furlongs. The trip shouldn’t be a problem for him as he won two races over 5 furlongs as a two year old. He was last seen at the beginning of July when finishing 5th 3 ¾ lengths behind Limato in the Group 1 Darley July cup. He was held up that day, made headway 2 furlongs out where he was carried out left a bit, was driven to chase the leaders over a furlong out, got outpaced and stayed on at the one pace inside the final furlong. Currently 12/1 with Paddy Power.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFurther Group success for the evergreen Galileo\n\nBy Red\n\nGalileo is showing his dominance once again this time at this years Goodwood Festival with a quick fire Group race double yesterday led by his son The Gurkha in the Group 1 Sussex stakes. The Aidan O’Brien trained colt was unraced as a two year old due to illness but has proved to be a revelation so far this year. He demolished his field in the Group 1Poule D’essai des Poulains the French 2000 guineas, in May on only his third ever start, he followed up that success with two narrow seconds in the Group1 St. James’s Palace stakes behind Galileo Gold and the Group 1 Coral Eclipse behind Hawkbill. On Wednesday afternoon the Galileo colt reversed placings with his Royal Ascot conqueror Galileo Gold beating him by a neck to record his second Group 1 victory of the year. The win also gave Galileo a fourth victory in the race following wins from his sons Rip Van Winkle in 2009 and Frankel in 2011 and 2012. Earlier in the afternoon the Michael Stoute trained Ulysses led home a one two for Galileo when winning the Group 3 Gordon stakes from another son The Major General. It was the second time this year that Galileo’s have filled the top spots in a Group race, he sired the first three home in the Group 1 Qipco 1000 Guineas when Minding won the race from Ballydoyle with Alice Springs back in third. The victories from both colts sees another £616,000 of prize money added to Galileo’s already impressive total this year, increasing his already sizable lead in his bid to win an eighth sires title. So far in the month of July Galileo’s offspring have won five top level Group 1 or Grade 1 races they include Alice Springs winner of the Group 1 Falmouth stakes on the 8th July, Deauville winner of the Grade 1 Belmont Derby on the 9th July, Seventh Heaven winner of the Group 1 Darley Irish Oaks on the 16th July, Highland Reel winner of the Group 1 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth stakes on The 23rd July , and The Gurkha winner the Group 1 Sussex stakes yesterday 27th July. Minding hopes to add to the success on Saturday in the Group 1 Qatar Nassau stakes. Further Group success for Galileo may happen this afternoon when his son Sword Fighter runs in the Group 2 Qatar Goodwood Cup.

Housesofparliament lead over a furlong out staying on well to beat Platitude by 1 ½ lengths providing Galileo with another Group winner to add to his already impressive tally.\n\nThe win means that Aidan will have a lot more options open to his colt.\n\nBookmakers reacted positively by cutting Housesofparliament to 12/1 for the Group 1 Doncaster St. Leger.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHousesofparliament boosts leger claims by taking Bahrain Trophy\n\nAidan O'Brien's Housesofparliament (9/2) got Newmarket's July Meeting off to a winning start for Ryan Moore.\n\nAs is so often the case in races run on the July Course, the field were spread right across the track at the two-furlong pole and Harrison and Harbour Law looked to be right on terms in the sprint to the winning post.\n\nBut Housesofparliament and Moore, racing alongside Platitude and Frankie Dettori towards the stands' side, got on top inside the final furlong and it was the former, fourth in the King Edward VII Stakes last time out, who prevailed under Moore by a length and a half, with Harrison third.\n\nMoore said: \"Aidan's horses all take their racing very well. This horse has run on soft ground all year and it's the first time he's had decent ground and he's relished it.\n\n\"He saw it out well and the ground has made a difference to him today.\"\n\nVictory saw the winner cut in the betting for both the St Leger and the Ebor Handicap, but O'Brien has a number of options for both contests and it remains to be seen which route they choose to take - both races, possibly.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOptions still remain open for Minding\n\nThursday 7th July By Red Hrafan\n\nMinding the brilliant winner of the 1000 Guineas and the Oaks at Epsom is still one of the 31 horses standing their ground for the Group one Qatar Sussex Stakes run on the 27th of July at Goodwood.\n\nThe Aidan O’Brien filly would be taking on the colts for the first time, chief amongst her rivals could be Galileo Gold the winner of the 2000 Guineas and St James’ Palace stakes. Minding may also be joined by her stable companion in the race The Ghurkha the impressive winner of the French 2000 Guineas,\n\nMinding Last seen out at the end of June when beating her elders convincingly is still amongst the 31 fillies and mares for the Group 1 Qatar Nassau Stakes on the 30th of July at Goodwood here she is likely to come up against Arabian Queen one of only two horses to beat Golden Horn last year and the unbeaten John Gosden trained filly Persuasive.\n\nIt seems more than likely that Minding will head for the Nassau.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBelmont Oaks - Ballydoyle stall 7 Coolmore stall 13 - Belmont Derby - Deauville stall 13 Long Island Sound stall 7 - (Jockey Bookings) Colm rides Long Island Sound and Ballydoyle and Jamie Spencer rides Deauville and Coolmore at Belmont Park Saturday night\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMeet Finn McCool (Here is his profile)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAidan has taken all his entries out of the Prix Jean Prat in France at the weekend. - Inca Gold, Pipes Of Peace and Etched declared for Leopardstown tomorrow. - Ryan Moore booked to ride Alice Springs in G1 Falmouth Stakes & Roly Poly in the G2 Cherry Hinton on Friday at Newmarket - Ryan Moore booked to Ride Landofhopeandglory in Sunday's German Derby at Hamburg\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWelcome to our new Team Member @RHrafan Red has been helping us for years bout time we added Red to the team roster\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHoping for a fairytale ending\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSimply Fallon our tribute to a legend thanks for the memories champ @KFallonJockey\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHousesofparliament among Bahrain nine\n\nWed 6th Jul 2016, 15:03\n\nHousesofparliament pictured on his way to victory at Dundalk in April\n\n(Healy Racing Photos)\n\nThe Aidan O'Brien-trained Housesofparliament will be the only Irish representative in the Bahrain Trophy at Newmarket.\n\nHousesofparliament was last seen running really well when finishing fourth in the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot last month and will face eight rivals on Thursday.\n\nSaeed bin Suroor is looking forward to seeing Prize Money test his powers over a longer distance having chased home fellow Godolphin inmate and subsequent Eclipse hero Hawkbill in the Tercentenary Stakes at the Royal meeting.\n\nAn impressive winner on his only appearance at two, the Authorized colt has filled the runner-up spot on each of his three starts so far this season and his trainer feels he could develop into a realistic contender for the St Leger at Doncaster in the autumn.\n\n\"He ran three times (this season) and finished second every race,\" Bin Suroor told At The Races.\n\n\"The horse is doing really well, he's a tough horse, and the jockey (James Doyle) advised us after his last run to run over a mile and six (furlongs) in the future.\n\n\"I think a mile and five in the the Bahrain Trophy will suit him well, he worked well in his last piece of work and he's in great form. I think he can go on any ground.\"\n\nHe added: \"We are thinking about the St Leger but we'll see how he runs at Newmarket.\"\n\nBin Suroor also saddles outsider Race Day .\n\nTrainer Laura Mongan is quietly confident about the chances of Harbour Law, who after winning at Salisbury and Sandown in May, was narrowly beaten by O'Brien's Sword Fighter in the Queen's Vase.\n\n\"We're going there full of hope,\" said Mongan.\n\n\"He hasn't let us down so far and came out of Ascot pretty well. He's coming on all the time and we think there is still some improvement in him.\n\n\"We didn't run him as a two-year-old, which has probably helped, and we think he goes there with every chance.\n\n\"We're not worried about the drop back in trip.
