        "text": "Conduit took the honours from Tartan Bearer with Ask staying on like a tenacious terrier for third place.\n\nSeconds after the trio flashed across the line a stewards inquiry was called but it did not matter a hoot to Stoute or the owners.\n\nMick Kinane, the rider of Tartan Bearer, had to momentarily stop riding when Conduit and Ryan\n\nMoore lunged into him. But before Kinane had time to work out his ten per cent, the stewards allowed the result to stand.\n\n“I’m very proud of them - they’ve all ran great races,” said Stoute who was wining the race for the fourth time.\n\n“The others (Tartan Bearer and Ask) are top-class horses. They are lovely, sound horses.\n\n“It ranks very high among my career achievements - this is a bit special.”\n\nThe occasion was also a bit special for the Ballymacoll Stud, the owner of Conduit and Tartan Bearer. The Irish Stud has bred legends. Arkle was one of them. Peter Reynolds, the stud manager, said: “That is our 50th Group One winner, and Michael’s 10th individual and 20th overall Group One for Ballymacoll.\n\n“We have 28 Group One winners stretching back to 1966.\n\n“Lord Weinstock bought the place in 1960 and we have kept it going, and we need days like today. He was nearly here for the last one when Golan won, and was only dead a week.\n\n“Michael had the idea to run both horses. It is a great result.\n\n“It is great to keep the fi rm up there. We are competing against some heavy hitters in Sheikh\n\nMohammed and John Magnier’s team and it is nice to have something to take them on with.”\n\nA piebald mare takes a large slice of the credit for yesterday’s winner as she fostered Conduit when he lost his mother at birth."
