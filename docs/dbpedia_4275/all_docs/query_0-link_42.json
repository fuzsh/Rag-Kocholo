        "text": "Sir Michael Stoute had his first ever Racing League winner when the regally-bred Reaching High formed part of an incredible five-timer for Team East on the second night of action.\n\nBy Sea The Stars and out of Gold Cup winner Estimate, the three-year-old, owned by the King and Queen, made a sweeping move under Luke Morris and sprinted clear to win for the first time at the seventh attempt by seven and a half lengths, relishing the step up in trip.\n\nMorris said: “He’s a gorgeous, big, scopey horse and I feel awful winning so far on him but it was a very messy race. I think he’ll make into a really nice stayer in the future.\n\n“It’s great to see such top connections supporting the Racing League.”\n\nFollowing three winners at Yarmouth on the opening night, the team managed by Chris Hughes and assisted by trainer Charlie Fellowes, extended their league at the top of the table in some style\n\nMorris got the night off to a flyer on Terry Kent’s Habooba (9-1) while there were also victories for Neil Callan on Fellowes’ Glam Squad (9-1) and two for Danny Muscutt on Kevin Philippart De Foy’s Bint Al Daar (10-1) and James Fanshawe’s Willem Twee (7-2 favourite)\n\nHughes told ITV 4: “We seem to be winning every other race at the moment!\n\n“It’s great because we have great sets of owners and for Kevin to get a winner on his birthday is great. Hopefully we keep charging.\n\n“It’s the beauty of the Racing League, good prize money has attracted good horses which attracts good crowds as well. I’ve seen loads of racing people here.\n\n“Hopefully people get behind it. We’ve had loads of support and it’s an easy game when you are winning.”\n\nYorkshire opened their account for the new season, aptly given August 1 is Yorkshire Day, when Longlai (9-1) won for Michael Wigham and David Allan while Thunder Blue (13-2) led home one a one-two for Wales & The West, winning for for Jamie and Saffie Osborne.\n\nStaged at Ascot racecourse, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes is run over a distance of 1m4f and is generally regarded as Britain’s most prestigious all-aged flat horse race.\n\nWith over £600,000 up for grabs for the winner the it goes without saying the race always attracts horses from the best yards around the country with Sir Michael Stoute and Saeed Bin Suroor, who have won the King George six and five times, are the trainers with the best recent record in the contest, while the powerful Aidan O’Brien yard have won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes four times. Don’t forget the John Gosden yard either – they’ve won the race 3 times in the last 8 years.\n\n12 months ago, in 2023, we saw the Owen Burrows-trained Hukum win the race in a tight battle with Westover. Hukum became only the third 6 year-old win win the King George since 1951.\n\nHere at GeeGeez, we take a look back at the recent winners of the race and gives you the key trends to look out for ahead of the 2024 renewal – this year run on Saturday 27th July.\n\nRecent King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes Winners\n\n2023 - Hukum (13/2)\n\n2022 – Pyledriver (18/1)\n\n2021 - Adayar (9/4)\n\n2020 – Enable (4/9 fav)\n\n2019 – Enable (8/15 fav)\n\n2018 – Poet’s Word (7/4)\n\n2017 – Enable (5/4 fav)\n\n2016 – Highland Reel (13/8 fav)\n\n2015 – Postponed (6/1)\n\n2014 – Taghrooda (7/2)\n\n2013 – Novellist (13/2)\n\n2012 – Danedream (9/1)\n\n2011 – Nathaniel (11/2)\n\n2010 – Harbinger (4/1)\n\n2009 – Conduit (13/8 fav)\n\n2008 – Duke of Marmalade (4/6 fav)\n\n2007 – Dylan Thomas (5/4 fav)\n\n2006 – Hurricane Run (5/6 fav)\n\n2005 – Azamour (5/2 fav)\n\n2004 – Doyen (11/10 fav)\n\n2003 – Alamshar (13/2)\n\n2002 – Golan (11/2)\n\nKing George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes Trends\n\n22/22 – Previous Group 1 or 2 winners\n\n20/22 – Had won over 1m4f before\n\n19/22 – Placed last time out\n\n18/22 – Had 2 or more runs already that season\n\n18/22 – Returned 13/2 or shorter in the betting\n\n18/22 – Previous Group 1 winner\n\n17/22 – Aged 3 or 4 years-old\n\n14/22 – Had run Ascot before\n\n13/22 – Won their previous race\n\n12/22 – Aged 4 years-old\n\n10/22 – Favourites that won\n\n10/22 – Won at Ascot before\n\n8/22 – Ran at Royal Ascot last time out\n\n5/22 – Trained by John Gosden\n\n4/22 – Trained by Sir Michael Stoute\n\n3/22 – Trained by Aidan O’Brien\n\nJust three 6+ year-old winners since 1951\n\nFrankie Dettori has ridden the winner in 1995, 1998, 1999, 2004, 2017, 2019 and 2020\n\n2 of the last 9 winners were that season’s Epsom Oaks winner\n\nAdayar (2021) and Galileo (2001) were the last horses to do the Derby/King George double in the same season\n\nTrainer John Gosden won the race in 2011, 2014, 2017, 2019 & 2020\n\nTrainer Sir Michael Stoute won the race in 1981, 1983, 2002, 2009, 2010 & 2018\n\nTrainer Saeed Bin Suroor won the race in 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999 & 2004\n\nTrainer Aidan O’Brien won the race in 2001, 2007, 2008 & 2016\n\nThe average winning SP in the last 22 runnings is 4/1\n\n================================================\n\nTRAINERS-QUOTES.COM\n\nGET THE BEST DAILY TRAINER INFO FROM 13 TOP STABLES - Sent direct to your in-box!\n\n**SPECIAL OFFER** TRY US FOR JUST £1.99!!\n\nFIND OUT MORE HERE\n\n==================================================\n\nSir Michael Stoute will leave it late before deciding if Passenger will take up his engagement in the Sky Bet York Stakes on Saturday.\n\nThe lightly-raced son of Ulysses won the Wood Ditton on his first run last year before going on to finish an unlucky third in the Dante, disappoint in the Derby and then land the Group Three Winter Hill Stakes on his final outing of 2023.\n\nHe has not been seen since May, when he beat Israr by a cosy one and a half lengths to win the Huxley Stakes at Chester.\n\nIsrar has since won the Wolferton Stakes at Royal Ascot, while Passenger was forced out of the Prince of Wales’s Stakes by an infection.\n\nThe Coral-Eclipse at Sandown also came too soon for the four-year-old and all eyes now turn to the Knavesmire, where Stoute will decide whether to take in the York Stakes or go straight to the Juddmonte International in August.\n\nAlan Cooper, racing manager to owners the Niarchos family, said: “The entry was made and Sir Michael will decide through the week what the plan is. Whether he needs to race before going to the Juddmonte or whatever.\n\n“The idea was to go to the Prince of Wales’s, but we couldn’t run there. We had to scrap that plan and this could be a good stepping stone to the Juddmonte, so now we need to decide whether to run here or just go straight to the Juddmonte.\n\n“We’ll see what Sir Michael decides during the week.”\n\nOthers in contention for what could prove a high-class renewal include last year’s winner Alflaila (Owen Burrows) and Hampton Court Stakes one-two Jayarebe (Brian Meehan) and King’s Gambit (Harry Charlton).\n\nPassenger will miss the Coral-Eclipse at Sandown on Saturday week as he continues his recovery from a setback which caused him to sit out Royal Ascot.\n\nSir Michael Stoute’s colt made a thrilling start to his four-year-old campaign, brushing Israr aside with a degree of ease that sent him straight to the top of the ante-post lists for the Prince of Wales’s Stakes at the Royal meeting.\n\nAn infection ruled him out of that particular Group One assignment and connections have now run out of time to prepare Passenger for the Eclipse, where he was generally the second-favourite behind Derby hero City Of Troy.\n\nAlan Cooper, racing manager for owner the Niarchos family, confirmed that Passenger will be missing from the Esher Group One – where he would have had the chance to replicate the achievements of his sire Ulysses, who struck in the Sandown feature in 2017.\n\nHowever, having seen the form of his Chester win franked in good style by Israr’s Wolferton Stakes romp at Ascot, hopes are high the four-year-old can be back soon to build on his Roodee triumph in one of the many top-race entries he holds later in the season.\n\nCooper said: “Sandown will come too soon for Passenger and we’re now just playing it all by ear. We entered him yesterday in the Juddmonte International (at York) and Sir Michael will make his recommendations in due course.\n\n“He was all set to run at Ascot in the Prince of Wales’s Stakes but he got a temperature which knocked him out of Ascot unfortunately and these biological things can take a bit of time to get over. He’s getting back on track. The horse will tell Sir Michael and we will go from there.\n\n“It’s a good form line (with Israr) and we look forward to seeing Passenger back on track.”\n\nSaffie Osborne has described riding the fancied Never So Brave in the Jersey Stakes for Sir Michael Stoute as a “massive privilege”.\n\nOsborne’s career has been one of steep progression in recent seasons and while her father Jamie provided her with a large proportion of her winners in her early days, her biggest victories have come for Ed Walker, Harry Fry and Clive Cox.\n\nHowever, a Group Three winner for Stoute on the biggest stage of all would be another level entirely and in Never So Brave, a horse who won easily at Chester’s May meeting, she has a live chance.\n\n“He’s obviously put two wins to his name and is a very nice horse,” said Osborne.\n\n“It’s an honour to be riding for Sir Michael at the Royal meeting. It’s a pretty deep race with lots of horses with good form, but hopefully he can run well.\n\n“It’s a massive privilege to ride for Sir Michael. He is someone I have grown up watching train so many big winners all around the world and to be consistently riding for him now is really special.”\n\nWith his form boosted by stablemate Rosallion earlier in the week, Haatem is out to bag his own big race sporting his new colours of Wathnan Racing.\n\nThird in the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket and only just reeled in by Rosallion in the Irish equivalent, Haatem is dropping down in trip and class for the seven-furlong Group Three.\n\nHe was bought by Wathnan following the Irish Guineas but with a 3lb penalty for his Craven Stakes win, he may not have things all his own way.\n\n“He’s going to have to carry a penalty, which is never easy to do, but he’s a big, strong horse. Physically it looks like the penalty shouldn’t hinder him too much,” said Wathnan’s Richard Brown.\n\n“He’s a top-class horse and has proven it this year. He was a very impressive winner of the Craven and has gone on to prove it in two Classics.\n\n“He’s not short of speed, but we know he’s going to stay. In the Jersey you have to be a strong stayer and you don’t win the Jersey if you don’t stay.\n\n“I think he will be a good candidate in what is shaping up to be a very hot race and we’re looking forward to seeing him in the Wathnan colours for the first time.”\n\nRalph Beckett’s Task Force was a top-class juvenile, finishing second in the Middle Park. He has only run once this season when seventh in the 2000 Guineas.\n\n“We haven’t seen him since the 2000 Guineas but he came out of it in good shape,” said Barry Mahon, racing manager for owners Juddmonte.\n\n“We just felt he was maybe a little bit weak at that stage and with him being a May foal, he had only just turned three when he ran in the Guineas and he was probably just going through a bit of a growth spurt and looked a little on the weak side in the parade ring.\n\n“Ralph has been happy with him since and the drop back to seven furlongs I don’t think will be an inconvenience.\n\n“He was a staying on second in the Middle Park over six, so I think seven will be a nice trip for him and we’re looking forward to seeing him back in action.”\n\nAlso in the famous Juddmonte silks is Harry Charlton’s Kikkuli, a half-brother to the brilliant Frankel. He was second in Listed company last time out on just his third run.\n\n“He was still learning his trade at Sandown and the ground had probably just got a little soft,” Mahon said.\n\n“We were happy he handled ease in the ground and we had no great worries about ease in the ground to be honest, but I just felt that day it blunted his speed a little bit.\n\n“The winner got away from him and Ryan (Moore) didn’t give him a hard time. I think he will have learned plenty from that and he will come on again.”\n\nAidan O’Brien runs River Tiber, last year’s Coventry Stakes winner and third in the Irish Guineas on his only outing this season, plus Mountain Bear and Pearls And Rubies.\n\nO’Brien’s Bedtime Story is bred to be very good indeed, being by Frankel out of the top-class sprinter Mecca’s Angel.\n\nShe won on her debut and is likely to go off favourite in the Chesham Stakes, a race the trainer has won four times since 2016.\n\nCharlie Appleby’s Age Of Gold, another Frankel colt, looked a runner of huge potential winning on his debut at Yarmouth.\n\nAppleby told Godolphin: “He’s a once-run colt who won very well at Yarmouth over six furlongs and I feel the step up to seven is going to suit him. Hopefully he’s a live player.”\n\nAmo Racing run the €260,000 newcomer Duke Of Monroth, from the family of Roaring Lion, with Paul and Oliver Cole’s Seaplane related to some strong stayers.\n\nElsewhere, Clive Cox has secured the services of Moore for Harry Three in the Wokingham.\n\nA Group One contender two years ago, he returned from a long layoff to finish fourth in a Listed race on his comeback.\n\nThe Lockinge Stakes is a Group One race staged at Newbury racecourse and run over a distance of 1 mile.\n\nFirst run in 1958 the contest is for 3 year-olds and older horses and has been won 4 times in the last 13 years by the Richard Hannon yard. In recent years the race has also been dominated by 4 year-olds, with 15 of the last 20 runnings going to horses in that age group, while 17 of the last 20 winners hailed from the first three in the betting.\n\nHere at GEEGEEZ we look back at past winners of the race, plus are on-hand with all the key ahead of the 2024 renewal - this year on Saturday 18th May 2024.\n\nRecent Lockinge Stakes Winners\n\n2023 - MODERN GAMES (3/1 fav)\n\n2022 – BAAEED (4/9 fav)\n\n2021 – PALACE PIER (1/2 fav)\n\n2020 – No race\n\n2019 – MUSTASHRY (9/1)\n\n2018 - RHODODENDRON (10/3 fav)\n\n2017 - RIBCHESTER (7/4 fav)\n\n2016 – BELARDO (8/1)\n\n2015 – NIGHT OF THUNDER (11/4 jfav)\n\n2014 – OLYMPIC GLORY (11/8 fav)\n\n2013 – FARHH (10/3)\n\n2012 – FRANKEL (2/7 fav)\n\n2011 – CANFORD CLIFFS (4/5 fav)\n\n2010 – PACO BOY (8/11 fav)\n\n2009 – VIRTUAL (6/1)\n\n2008 – CREACHADOIR (3/1 fav)\n\n2007 – RED EVIE (8/1)\n\n2006 – PEERESS (4/1)\n\n2005 – RAKTI (7/4 fav)\n\n2004 – RUSSIAN RHYTHM (3/1 fav)\n\n2003 – HAWK WING (2/1 fav)\n\nLockinge Stakes Betting Trends\n\n20/20 – Won over a mile before\n\n17/20 – Came from the top 3 in the betting\n\n16/20 – Returned 4/1 or shorter in the betting\n\n16/20 – Had won a Group One race before\n\n15/20 – Drawn between stalls 3-7 (inc)\n\n15/20 – Aged 4 years-old\n\n15/20 – Had won at least 4 times before\n\n14/20 – Winning favourites\n\n11/20 – Having their first run of the season\n\n10/20 – Unplaced last time out\n\n6/20 – Godolphin owned\n\n4/20 – Won by the Richard Hannon yard (Has won the race 5 times in all)\n\n4/20 – Won by a mare\n\n4/20 – Ran at Newmarket last time out\n\n3/20 – Won by a Cheveley Park stud-owned horse (won it 5 times in all)\n\n3/20 – Won by trainer Sir Michael Stoute (has won the race 8 times in all)\n\n1/20 – Winners from stall 1 or 2\n\n================================================\n\nTRAINERS-QUOTES.COM\n\nGET THE BEST DAILY TRAINER INFO FROM 14 TOP STABLES - Sent direct to your in-box!\n\n**SPECIAL OFFER** TRY US FOR JUST £1.99!!\n\nFIND OUT MORE HERE\n\n==================================================\n\nInfinite Cosmos will command plenty of attention in the Al Basti Equiworld Dubai Middleton Fillies’ Stakes at York on Thursday, falling as she does into the bracket of one who could thrive as an older horse under the expert guidance of Sir Michael Stoute.\n\nLightly-raced with just four outings to her name, the daughter of Sea The Stars was third in the Musidora Stakes at this meeting 12 months ago but was forced to miss Royal Ascot and did not reappear until Yarmouth in September.\n\nShe was beaten there by Godolphin’s Sapphire Seas, but was perfectly entitled to be rusty after her time off and in any case ran with promise for the future.\n\n“Free Wind and Bluestocking are obviously the form fillies, but the boss has his horses in good form and hopefully there is plenty more to come from Infinite Cosmos as a four-year-old,” her jockey Ryan Moore told Betfair.\n\n“You’d hope there is progression in her after just the four starts, and she comes into this in good form at home.\n\n“I’m happy with her. I think the track will suit her, as will the recent rain.”\n\nFree Wind defends her title for John and Thady Gosden, with her liking for the track confirmed when running Warm Heart to a head in the Yorkshire Oaks at the Ebor meeting.\n\nThe Ralph Beckett-trained Bluestocking was fourth in that race and went on to be runner-up on British Champions Day at Ascot, while the aforementioned Sapphire Seas takes on Infinite Cosmos again.\n\nCharlie Appleby’s filly was most recently seen finishing second to stablemate English Rose in the Balanchine in Dubai in February.\n\nAppleby told www.godolphin.com: “Sapphire Seas had a little break after her run in Dubai and looks great heading into this. She has a bit to find on the ratings, but stepping back up in trip should suit and she deserves to be in the field. We hope that she can be competitive.”\n\nNovus represents Gary and Josh Moore, with last year’s Oaks third Caernarfon taking her chance for Jack Channon.\n\nPassenger began what could prove to be a big four-year-old season in the best possible fashion, with a smooth victory in the IRE-Incentive, It Pays To Buy Irish Huxley Stakes at Chester.\n\nA eighth victory in the race for Sir Michael Stoute, he looks a top-notch prospect for connections.\n\nNot blessed with the smoothest of journeys when dead-heating for third in the Dante last year, before disappointing in the Derby, for which he was supplemented, the Ulysses colt was only seen once after Epsom, when getting home by a short head in the Winter Hill Stakes at Windsor.\n\nIn breaking the track record on the Roodee, he now looks booked for bigger and better things having beaten Israr by a length and a half to add Group Two honours to his CV.\n\nRichard Kingscote was content to take a lead off Jim Crowley until the turned into the short straight, but once he asked his mount the response was immediate and the 7-4 scorer quickened impressively.\n\nPaddy Power initially cut the winner to 14-1 for the Prince of Wales’s Stakes, but were immediately forced to trim him into 8-1.\n\n“I had a good chat with Ryan yesterday (about a plan) and we wanted to use Israr for as long as possible really and it’s nice when a race goes to plan,” Kingscote told Sky Sports Racing.\n\n“This lad does battle, but obviously he’s still lightly-raced. We had to have a good battle at Windsor last year when I probably got to the front a little early. Today when he went by he didn’t hesitate and he put the race to bed really nicely.\n\n“The Dante was a mess, I overcomplicated things and that was always going to be how we rode the race today, it’s nice when things go our way.”\n\nThe Derby-winning rider added on ITV Racing: “I think I let the horse down a couple of times last year, this went better so hopefully we can keep going forwards.\n\n“Sir Michael doesn’t like bigging them up, but he’s a very likeable horse. The race was smooth for him, but you could just feel he was learning a bit on the job which is why I just feel Sir Michael loves coming here. He’s one to look forward to.\n\n“Sir Michael has been at the top table a very long time, there’s a group of people who love him and are delighted to see him do well. Hopefully we’ve got another nice one.”\n\nNever So Brave took Sir Michael Stoute’s tally for the season to two with a straightforward success in the Halliwell Jones Handicap at Chester.\n\nNotoriously a slow starter, the three-year-old had also provided the Freemason Lodge handler with his first winner of the season, when cruising to victory at Thirsk.\n\nThat saw him allotted an opening handicap mark of 94 and on this evidence that was pretty generous, as Ryan Moore was able to sit just behind the leader before pressing the button and winning with the minimum of fuss as the even-money favourite.\n\nHe is owned by Saeed Suhail, who has had some great days teaming up with Stoute, and his assistant racing manager Philip Robinson indicated a possible Royal Ascot bid could be on the cards for a horse who was unfortunate to bump into Vandeek and Ancient Wisdom in his two juvenile starts.\n\n“He keeps progressing. We were very hopeful. He showed some nice form last year, won nicely at Thirsk, won as he likes there and this was a step up to see how good he was,” said Robinson.\n\n“He’s been a typical one of Sir Michael’s, just brought him along gradually to peak at the right time.\n\n“I think he’ll be nice, but it’s difficult to say how high he could go. If he got the mile he could be a Britannia horse so we’ll have to have a chat.”\n\nDemocracy Dilemma (11-4 favourite) made full use of his low draw to win for the first time for his new connections in the CAA Stellar Handicap.\n\nOver five furlongs a draw near the rail takes on even greater significance on the Roodee and Tom Marquand bided his time behind the pacesetters.\n\nBought for 105,000 guineas by Jim and Fitri Hay and sent to sprint specialist Robert Cowell, he had disappointed twice in Dubai and then refused to enter the stalls at Bath. But he looked a reformed character when getting up on the line to pip the veteran Copper Knight by a neck with a nose back to Vintage Clarets.\n\nMarquand said: “The idea was to get him out of the gate and get him travelling in a comfortable position – when you have that draw around here you don’t want to be giving it away.\n\n“He had some problems with the gates last time, but Jake Launchbury has done a fantastic job with him getting that sorted and he didn’t miss a beat so it was a job well done.\n\n“The ground has sharpened up a good bit, but he had form on fast ground before. To be honest it’s all about the draw around here and we made good use of it.”\n\nThe Karl Burke-trained Teej A (4-1) went one better than on debut when quickening up on the inside for Clifford Lee in the British Stallion Studs EBF Maiden Stakes.\n\nMarquand set the pace on Jessica Harrington’s Passing Phase, but Lee looked to be travelling the better with a furlong to run, just waiting for a gap on the rail as soon as he reached the cutaway.\n\nThe Mehmas filly quickly put three lengths between herself and the rest, but it was a good job she did as the 3-1 favourite Rashabar made rapid late gains, beaten two and a quarter lengths looking yet another Chester hard luck story from his stall 10 draw.\n\n“It went pretty much according to plan to be honest,” said Lee.\n\n“She travelled well and as soon as we got to the cutaway away she went. That was important as you can get a lot of hard luck stories here.\n\n“She’s sharpened up a lot for her first run and she galloped through the line as well. She was green for her first run but she’s wiser now.”\n\nOne-time Classic contender Passenger will take flight on his four-year-old campaign in the Ire-Incentive, It Pays To Buy Irish Huxley Stakes at Chester on Friday.\n\nThe Sir Michael Stoute-trained colt burst onto the scene in the Wood Ditton last spring and earned a shot at the Derby when deemed an unlucky third in the Dante at York.\n\nHe ultimately disappointed in the Epsom Classic, but after a break finished his three-year-old season with a first Group-level success at Windsor to give connections hope he could follow in the footsteps of his sire Ulysses and thrive for Stoute at four.\n\n“It will hopefully be a good start to an exciting year,” said Alan Cooper, racing manager for owners the Niarchos family.\n\n“He’s got some very nice entries and has wintered well and, as always, we’ll take it step by step and see how Friday goes and take things from there.\n\n“Sir Michael takes his horses along gently and has given Passenger plenty of time to mature and Friday is hopefully the first step on a good four-year-old season.”\n\nStoute has won the race twice in the last 10 years with Cannock Chase (2016) and Solid Stone (2021) and also saddles Regal Reality, who is the mount of Saffie Osborne and gave a fair account on his return in the Earl of Sexton Stakes.\n\nA man with an even better recent record is Aidan O’Brien, with the Ballydoyle handler attempting to follow up Point Lonsdale’s success 12 months ago with Hans Andersen, who is fresh from victory at Dundalk and partnered by William Buick.\n\nMeanwhile, John and Thady Gosden’s Israr has been a consistent performer for connections and is tried in blinkers once again having sported the headgear when pipped late on in Sandown’s Gordon Richards Stakes recently.\n\nJockey Jim Crowley had made a bold bid for home on that occasion before being headed by Okeechobee and the King and Queen’s Desert Hero in the dying strides. Angus Gold, racing manager for the Shadwell operation, said: “He’s a funny horse who doesn’t do a lot when he hits the front and he was sort of left in front a long way out.\n\n“Obviously the other two just quickened past him up the hill but he ran well in the headgear and we’ve kept that on him.\n\n“It’s anybody’s guess how a horse will get on at Chester, but hopefully it is a track that might suit him and it will be lovely ground I’m sure. Hopefully he will run. He’s a lovely horse to have.”\n\nJohnny Murtagh’s Mashhoor and the Ed Bethell-trained Oviedo complete a six-strong field with Certain Lad, Royal Rhyme and Sunchart all non-runners.\n\nNostrum is out to prove he remains a high-class prospect when he makes his return in the bet365 Mile at Sandown on Friday.\n\nThe one-time Classic hope endured a frustrating three-year-old campaign and having missed the first half of the season due to a setback, made a winning reappearance in Newmarket’s Listed Sir Henry Cecil Stakes.\n\nHowever, that was the sole bright moment for the Sir Michael Stoute-trained colt, who got stuck in the mud when second in Goodwood’s Thoroughbred Stakes before finishing lame when the odds-on favourite at York in the Strensall Stakes, after which his season was brought to a halt.\n\nThe son of Kingman is now back to correct a few records and after pleasing his connections in the lead-up to his reappearance, has the chance to give his handler a fourth win in the Group Two event.\n\n“He’s in good shape and has had a good winter, so it will be exciting to see him back and what he can do,” said Barry Mahon, European racing manager for owners Juddmonte.\n\n“He has won at Sandown before and that is a plus, we know he likes the track and it will be good to see him back. He’s been slightly frustrating, but we know he’s talented, so it would be nice to see it on the track.\n\n“He’s had a pretty unremarkable prep leading into it, he’s been sound and moving well and the team there have been happy. Ryan Moore was happy last Wednesday when he rode him and it seems to have gone smoothly this spring, whereas last year we had setbacks and were always on the backfoot.\n\n“Hopefully the ground will be good and we get to see the true Nostrum.”\n\nJohn and Thady Gosden’s stalwart Lord North will drop back to a mile having failed to land a fourth straight Dubai Turf at Meydan last month.\n\nThe Clarehaven eight-year-old has not raced over this distance since finishing second in the Balmoral Handicap in 2019, but has become a regular figure in the biggest events over middle distances since that contest.\n\nRoger Varian’s Charyn regularly hit the frame without getting his moment in the spotlight last term, but got the new campaign off to the perfect start when striking in the Doncaster Mile on the opening day of the Flat turf season.\n\nHe now makes the move into deeper waters and his Carlburg Stables handler warns he will need to improve to match his exploits on Town Moor.\n\nVarian said: “He’s in good form and the race on Friday will require a bit more winning than Doncaster, it’s a strong, select field, I think.\n\n“It’s a very solid Group Two, but the track, trip and ground should suit him and he goes there in good form.”\n\nPoker Face claimed the scalp of the reopposing Flight Plan in Pontefract’s Pomfret Stakes last year, a victory that kick-started a three-race winning run for Simon and Ed Crisford’s representative.\n\nHis streak came to an end in Italy in November, but he reappears as the second best runner in the field on official figures, rated just 2lb inferior to Lord North.\n\nMeanwhile, the aforementioned Flight Plan ended his three-year-old season on a high when claiming the Group Two Dullingham Park Stakes at Leopardstown and will have sharpened up thanks to a racecourse gallop at Newmarket during the Craven meeting.\n\nHungerford Stakes winner Witch Hunter represents the in-form Richard Hannon team, with Charlie Hills’ Pogo completing the line-up."
