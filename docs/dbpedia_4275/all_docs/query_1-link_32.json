He joined the Lancer family in September of 2006, and has been supporting the blue and gold on and off the field, court, track, and ice ever since.\n\nA pillar in the UWindsor and Windsor-Essex communities, Winston’s schedule is jam packed as he is always busy bringing awareness to several causes and special events throughout the year including Welcome Week, Breast Cancer Awareness Day, Lancers Against Bullying, the Strawberry Festival Mascot Dance Off, and Relay for Life (just to name a few….)\n\nWinston is a proud alum of the Odette School of Business graduating with a degree in marketing, with a major in Crowd Leader, Spirit Raiser, Ambassador, Athlete and Entertainer.\n\nIf you would like Winston to appear at your next event, please click here to fill out an appearance request form. Please note that requests must be submitted a minimum of two weeks in advance of the event. There is also an appearance fee for Winston that helps cover the rising cost of general maintenance, travel, and repairs associated with the high number of events that he attends each year."
