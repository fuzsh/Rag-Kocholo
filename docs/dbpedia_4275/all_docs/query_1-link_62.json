        "text": "The following Factfiles are kindly provided by my good friend Mark Popham at Racenews. In order, for each runner, they feature facts on Horse, Owner(s), Trainer, Jockey\n\nFactfiles for the 2014 Crabbie’s Grand National\n\nAcross The Bay (IRE) 10-10-11\n\nBreeding: b g Bob’s Return (IRE) – The Southern (IRE) (Glacial Storm (USA)) Breeder: Noel McLoughlin\n\nBorn: April 9, 2004\n\nOwner: Scotch Piper Syndicate\n\nTrainer: Donald McCain\n\nJockey: Henry Brooke\n\nForm: 3/14512/49312U2/PP1P8/782425P3/112710-581U\n\n*Finished 14th after making a lot of the running in last year’s Crabbie’s Grand National.\n\n*Won four times in Ireland when trained by Noel Meade.\n\n*Joined current connections after selling for £10,000 at the 2011 DBS Spring Horses In Training Sale.\n\n*Has scored three times over fences, all on heavy ground, for Donald McCain, most recently in a three and a half mile handicap chase at Haydock Park on December 30.\n\n*Also captured the Grade Two Rendlesham Hurdle at the same course in February, 2013.\n\n*Unseated his rider at the 16th when behind in the Betfred Grand National Trial Handicap Chase at Haydock on February 15. Race record: Starts: 36; 1st: 8; 2nd: 6; 3rd: 3; Win & Place prize money: £142,642\n\nScotch Piper Syndicate\n\nBackground: The syndicate derives its name from the Scotch Piper pub at Lydiate north of Liverpool – dating back to 1320, it is said to be the oldest pub in Lancashire. The current Scotch Piper Syndicate comprises Lancashire-based Graham Worsley and the brothers Anthony and Kevin Coyne, while past members have included Graham’s brother Mike, and Ireland-based Frank Towey and Barry Brennan. The idea for racehorse ownership came together over a drink in the pub, and in 2008 the group travelled to trainer Noel Meade’s yard in Ireland, viewed half a dozen horses and bought an unnamed gelding for 25,000 euros – he turned out to be Across The Bay, one of three runners for the late Ginger McCain’s son Donald in this year’s John Smith’s Grand National. The syndicate came up with the name of their horse while taking lunch with Meade at a restaurant in Galway that looked ‘across the bay’. Initially their horse ran from Meade’s yard, but at Fairyhouse’s Irish Grand National meeting in April, 2011, the idea of moving him to Britain was discussed. With some syndicate members preferring to pull out it was decided to achieve the market value for Across The Bay at Doncaster Bloodstock Sales the following month. He was sold for £10,000 to Kevin Coyne, who was acting for himself and his brother, plus Graham Worsley and sent into training with Donald McCain. Worsley, whose interest in racing came from visiting the Grand National with his family, is chairman of St Helens-based GPW Recruitment. A chartered engineer, he joined the family engineering business after graduating in Liverpool with a degree in mechanical engineering. In his late 20s, Graham went on to become a director of Babcock International where he was involved in the design and development of fluidised bed hot gas generators. He spent 20 years as managing director, developing GPW Recruitment into one of the North-West’s leading providers of permanent and temporary recruitment services and became chairman in 2009. Kevin Coyne is a lawyer from Crosby and a partner in Coyne Learmonth LLP, which specialises in helping those who have suffered loss or personal injury due to any form of vehicle accident nationwide. He qualified as a solicitor in 1974. His brother Anthony is a dentist at Netherton near Bootle, close to Aintree. His practice is called Saving Faces. Born in Waterloo, Liverpool, Coyne qualified as a dental surgeon in 1985 at Sheffield University. From 1986-1991, he was surgeon lieutenant dentist with the Royal Navy. In 1996 he opened Old Roan Dental Practice, converting it to private practice in 2001 and the named changed to Saving Faces in 2005. The switch to Netherton was made in 2010. Dr Coyne has trained at Harley Street in London, the BICON Dental Institute in Boston, USA, and the University of Cartagena in Columbia. Crabbie’s Grand National record: 2013 Across The Bay (14th)\n\nDonald McCain (Cholmondeley, Cheshire)\n\nBorn: June 13, 1970, Background: son of the late Ginger McCain, trainer of the legendary Red Rum, the only horse to win the Grand National three times (1973, 1974 and 1977) and also Amberleigh House, the 2004 victor. Ginger McCain died at the age of 80 on September 19, 2011. Donald learnt to ride on his sister Joanne’s pony Gambol and rode in his first race on the Flat aged 15 (his father told a few white lies so he could ride) at Haydock Park. Subsequently became a jump jockey, firstly as an amateur and then a professional, partnering around 40 winners under Rules. He rode several times over the Grand National fences, finishing fifth aboard Harley in the 1992 Fox Hunters’ Chase and 17th on Sure Metal in the 1996 Grand National. He also spent time working for trainers Luca Cumani, Sir Michael Stoute and Oliver Sherwood. Donald subsequently became assistant trainer to his father and played a significant role in Amberleigh House’s Grand National victory in 2004. He took over the licence from his father in June, 2006, with his first winner coming courtesy of Bearaway in a handicap chase at Newton Abbot on June 8, 2006. The highlight of his training career so far was when Ballabriggs won the Crabbie’s Grand National in 2011. He has made strong progress as a trainer and is one of the leading jump trainers in Britain. He sent out 100 British winners for the first time in the 2010/11 season and has topped that figure ever since, with 153 British scorers being his best total in 2011/12. Achievements: Has sent out six Cheltenham Festival winners and saddled 2011 Crabbie’s Grand National winner Ballabriggs. Crabbie’s Grand National record: 2007 Idle Talk (UR 19th); 2008 Cloudy Lane (6th), Idle Talk (14th); 2009 Idle Talk (12th), Cloudy Lane (UR 15th); 2010 Cloudy Lane (8th), 2011 BALLABRIGGS (WON); 2012 Ballabriggs (6th), Weird Al (Fell 26th); 2013 Across The Bay (14th), Weird Al (PU bef\n\n25th), Ballabriggs (PU bef 24th)\n\nHenry Brooke\n\nBorn Tadcaster, October 31, 1990 Background: Brooke was raised at Easingwold, Yorkshire, by his parents Glen and Julia Brooke, who now live in Middleham where Glen is a blacksmith, and Julia, who rode in point-to-points under her maiden name of Platts, runs a pre-training yard which also houses a veterinary clinic. They have another son, Danny, who takes part in pony races and rides out for trainer Philip Kirby. Henry’s first ride in a race – in a point-to-point – came on Pikachu Blue, a horse that was gifted to him as a birthday present by trainer Sue Bramall. He finished third on that debut, but it took him another two seasons before he broke his duck in points. He flirted with Flat racing and had 14 rides on the level in 2010 and 2011. He became a conditional jockey and is now in his fourth season with Cholmondeley-based Donald McCain. The move has been a great success, for Brooke rode 17 winners in his first season (2010/11), 42 in 2011/12, when he won the conditional jockeys’ championship, and 34 in 2012/13.

Race record: Starts: 21; Wins: 8; 2nd: 3; 3rd: 1; Win & Place Prize Money: £60,239\n\nWilliam & Angela Rucker\n\nBackground: William Rucker, born on June 18, 1963, is chief executive of Lazard’s London operations and has been since June, 2004. He is also deputy chief executive of the European investment banking business at Lazard. The bank dates back to 1848 and is one of the world’s pre-eminent financial advisory and asset management firms, operating from 40 cities across 24 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, Central and South America.

Racing interests: Amazingly, five of their six runners in the Crabbie’s Grand National have been placed. Angela herself is also a talented rider and trains pointers and the couple’s daughter Emily also rides in point-to-points. The Ruckers are based at Himbleton in Worcestershire and also have horses with Evan Williams and a variety of point-to-point trainers, including Sheila Crow, who trained their Cappa Bleu to win the Christie’s Foxhunter Chase at the 2009 Cheltenham Festival.

Followed his brothers by working at Andrew McNamara’s yard at weekends and during school holidays, before spending two months at the age of 14 in England with Doug Francis, where Brian worked. After finishing his schooling in Ireland, he went to Newmarket’s British Racing School for a nine-week course in 1989 and shortly afterwards was sent to Tim Forster’s Oxfordshire yard, where he worked for three years. Joined private trainer Colin Cowley to pursue a career as a jockey, but, after two rides, realised it was not for him and switched to the Nigel Twiston-Davies team in Gloucestershire in July, 1992. Spent 19 years at Grange Hill Farm, including 17 as head lad. Successfully started training point-topointers in 2005, while working for Nigel and was champion point-to-point trainer in West Midlands area for four seasons.

He is based at jockey Timmy Murphy’s Cilldara Stud near Fossebridge in Gloucestershire. Married to Jelly, with two daughters Fern and Daisy. No previous runners in Crabbie’s Grand National\n\nPaul Moloney\n\nBorn: October 17, 1978, hailing from New Inn, close to Ballydoyle in Co Tipperary Background: Paul Moloney formerly shared a house in Newmarket with former champion Flat jockey Jamie Spencer and was heavily involved in both hunting and show jumping and rode his first point-to-point winner at Quin in 1996 for trainer Danny O’Connell. He spent school holidays with Jim Bolger, working alongside Tony McCoy and leading Flat rider Ted Durcan, and later joined Michael Hourigan, for whom he rode his first three winners. His initial success under Rules came on Vain Princess at Clonmel in June, 1995. Moloney was one of Ireland’s leading amateurs and shared the 1998/99 title with Philip Fenton. Moloney also spent time with Christy Roche while in Ireland. He came to Britain for tuition from Yogi Breisner before turning professional and relocated to Newmarket during the 2002/2003 season when he rode mainly for Ian Williams. He enjoyed big race success at Aintree in 2006 when he rode State Of Play to victory in a handicap chase and teamed up with the same horse to secure the biggest win of his career so far in the Hennessy Cognac Gold Cup Handicap Chase at Newbury in November, 2006. He has finished fourth (2009 and 2011) and third (2010) on the same horse in the Grand National. For the past two years, he rode Cappa Bleu in the Crabbie’s Grand National, finishing fourth in 2012 and runner-up in 2013. He rides mainly for Evan Williams and his biggest wins include Deep Purple’s victory in the 2009 Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby and Tiger O’Toole’s victory in the Grade Two Holloways Hurdle at Ascot in January, 2011.

Started his campaign with victory in a Listed cross-country chase at Craon, France, in September before a comfortable success in a handicap chase at Cheltenham in October. Followed up with two wins over Cheltenham’s cross-country course, including a\n\ngame short-head verdict in the Glenfarclas Handicap Chase at the Cheltenham Festival on March 12.\n\n*Officially 9lb “well-in” at the weights, with his Cheltenham Festival success having come after the weights for the Crabbie’s Grand National were revealed on February 11.\n\n*With its unique obstacles, including Grand National-style fences, Cheltenham’s cross-country course has proved a pointer to Crabbie’s Grand National success in the past. Silver Birch was runner-up in the Glenfarclas Handicap Chase at the 2007 Cheltenham Festival before scoring at Aintree the following month.\n\nRace Record: Starts; 41; 1st: 14; 2nd: 7; 3rd: 1; Win & Place prize money: £233,072\n\nThe Brushmakers\n\nThe Brushmakers is a Hampshire-based trio involving farmers David Rees, born in 1972, his wife Maggie, Chris Butler and Geoffrey Stevenson, who runs the Imperial Bathroom Company, and who Rees describes as ‘an old rugby-playing friend of mine’. They take their name from the Brushmakers pub at Upham near Winchester, in which Rees once owned a stake. When he subsequently moved to the other side of Winchester, to the village of Hursley, he discovered his new local was the Kings Head, but being unimpressed with it he bought that too. He describes himself as an “arable farmer who also milks cows and keeps pigs and poultry – one of the few truly mixed farms in Hampshire”. His interest in racing was derived through being a neighbour of the late trainer Bill Wightman, whose land Rees farmed. Wightman gave Rees a point-to-pointer and he has been involved in that sport ever since – one of his first buys was prolific winner Ball In The Net, and he also raced Upham Lord, who was subsequently sold to Lincolnshire-based Mike and Jill Dawson and in 2002 and again in 2003 became Britain’s champion between the flags based on wins. Rees says: “I have subsequently been involved in five or six horses trained by Philip Hobbs, including Tamango, who fell at The Chair in the Topham Chase [in 2006]. We bought Balthazar King privately from Diana Whateley [also an owner with Hobbs].” Imperial Bathrooms is the only independent British-owned bathroom company still manufacturing in the UK. Imperial was founded in 1987 by Geoffrey Stevenson, who is the chairman, and Imperial remains still a family-owned company and prides itself in supplying the highest-quality products to a worldwide marketplace. Situated in the heart of the ceramic industry in the West Midlands, Walsall-based Imperial produce original designs to the highest standards, each product undergoing rigorous testing.\n\nCrabbie’s Grand National Record: 2013 Balthazar King (15th)\n\nPhilip Hobbs (Bilbrook, Somerset)\n\nBorn July 26, 1955 Background: Philip was brought up surrounded by horses. His father Tony Hobbs farmed, and had a permit to train for many years, breeding several good horses to run in the family colours. After school at King’s College, Taunton, Philip went on to Reading University and achieved a BSc honours degree. He rode at Hickstead, show jumping as a junior, and gained several point-to-point winners and winners under National Hunt rules as an amateur before turning professional at the age of 21. Partnered 160 winners in a 10-year riding career including the Black and White Gold Cup at Ascot, the Killiney Novice Chase and the Midlands Grand National on such good horses as West Tip and Artifice. Hobbs made four appearances in the Grand National as a professional jockey in the 1980s and, although one of the best horses he rode was West Tip, he didn’t get the leg up on him in the National, with those four rides resulting in two falls, one ninth place and an 11th. He started training in August, 1985, with only six horses and was successful with his very first runner, North Yard at Exeter. He is now one of Britain’s top jump trainers. Philip’s wife Sarah, whom he married in 1982, is the daughter of Bertie Hill, who won a gold medal in three-day eventing at the 1956 Olympics at Stockholm. Achievements: has trained over 2,000 winners, including 18 at the Cheltenham Festival with two of them coming this year. Major Wins Include: BetVictor Queen Mother Champion Chase (2002 Flagship Uberalles), Stan James Champion Hurdle (2003 Rooster Booster). Crabbie’s Grand National record: 1990 Gallic\n\nPrince (13th); Joint Sovereignty (Fell 19th); 1995 Gold Cap (13th); 1998 Samlee (3rd); Greenhill Tare Away (UR 27th); 1999 Samlee (10th); Bells Life (PU bef 26th); Mudahim (UR 6th); 2000 Village King (Fell 20th); Stormy Passage (Fell 22nd); 2001 Village King (Fell 8th); 2002 What’s Up Boys (2nd); 2004 What’s Up Boys (BD 6th); 2005 Double Honour (UR 21st); 2007 Zabenz (PU bef 7th), Monkerhostin (Ref 7th); 2009 Zabenz (Fell 16th), Parsons Legacy (Fell 22nd); 2010 Dream Alliance (PU bef 24th); 2011 Quinz (PU\n\n16th); 2012 Planet Of Sound (12th); 2013 Balthazar King (15th)\n\nRichard Johnson\n\nBorn: July 21, 1977 Background: Attended Belmont Abbey School, the alma mater of Peter Scudamore, before leaving at 16 to take a job with then champion trainer David Nicholson. He was born and raised at Madley, Herefordshire, where his parents have a farm. Johnson comes from racing stock as his mother Sue holds a licence to train, while his father Keith, who won the 1982 Midlands Grand National on Bridge Ash, and his grandfather Ivor were both good amateur riders. Johnson is unlucky to be riding in the same era as Tony McCoy as he has finished runner-up to his rival in the jockeys’ championship on 14 occasions. He is one of a few jockeys to make the front page of The Sun (March, 2003) when his then girlfriend Zara Phillips kissed him after his Champion Hurdle victory on Rooster Booster and also appeared in the pages of Hello magazine (December, 2001) alongside Phillips. His first winner came at Hereford aboard Rusty Bridge on April 30,1994, and he has gone on to capture some of racing’s biggest prizes, notably the 2000 Gold Cup at Cheltenham aboard Looks Like Trouble and the 2002 Queen Mother Champion Chase on Flagship Uberalles, as well as Rooster Booster’s famous triumph in the Champion Hurdle. Other top-flight winners he has partnered include Florida Pearl, Anzum, Mighty Man, Detroit City, Planet Of Sound, Menorah, Landing Light, Menorah, Captain Chris and Reve De Sivola. He has a total of 20 winners at the Cheltenham Festival. He has a good record at Aintree and won the Crabbie’s Topham Trophy over the Grand National course in 2001 on Gower Slave. His best finish in the Crabbie’s Grand National came when What’s Up Boys finished second in 2002. The grey looked the winner at the elbow but, like many before him, Johnson’s mount was headed in the last 75 yards by Bindaree. In 2007 he married Fiona Chance, daughter of the dual Cheltenham Gold Cup-winning trainer Noel Chance and they have three children – Willow, Casper and Percy.

Win & place prize money: £169,060\n\nJolly Boys Outing\n\nBackground: Jolly Boys Outing is a syndicate consisting of Mike Fitzgerald, Jon Gwyther, Tony Price and James Langridge, who all work for J & G Fencing in Ashton Vale, Bristol, as well as their friend Peter Randall. J & G Fencing was founded in 2002 by Gwyther and Langridge. The company turns over more than £3 million a year. The group purchased Battle Group for £75,000 in the car park at Cheltenham Racecourse after he failed to make his reserve at an auction held at Home of Jump Racing after racing, January 1 in 2009.\n\nCrabbie’s Grand National Record: No previous runners\n\nJohnny Farrelly (Bridgwater, Somerset)\n\nBorn: October 23, 1984 Background: Farrelly was a conditional jockey attached to the David Pipe yard and he rode over 100 winners for the trainer, including the Emma Lavelle-trained Pause And Clause in the Martin Pipe Conditional Jockeys’ Handicap Hurdle at the 2010 Cheltenham Festival. He also won the Sky Bet Chase on An Accordion in 2008. He had a bad fall at Fontwell in December, 2011, when he was not only knocked unconscious but also lost two teeth and broke a collar-bone. Injury plagued his career. He took up training at the start of this season, following a spell assisting Kevin Bishop. During his time with Bishop, he looked after several horses and was credited for masterminding Battle Group’s unique double at Aintree last year, when he won the Grade Three Silver Cross Handicap Hurdle on the first day of the meeting and the Betfred TV Handicap Chase on Grand National day. Farrelly has 22 horses under his care at his Bridgwater base in Somerset, after completing three training modules as well as a NVQ in racehorse care and management. Battle Group will be Farrelly’s first runner in the Crabbie’s Grand National. Previous Crabbie’s Grand National runners: None\n\nBrendan Powell\n\nBorn: January 26, 1995 Background: The son of Crabbie’s Grand National-winning jockey and successful trainer Brendan Powell (who partnered the 1988 winner Rhyme ‘N’ Reason), Powell cut his teeth on the pony racing circuit in Ireland, making his debut in that sphere at the tender age of 14. He returned to England and turned professional in September, 2011 as a 16-year-old. Attached to the Colin Tizzard yard in Dorset, he quickly made a name for himself and had his first Cheltenham Festival winner in March, 2012 on Golden Chieftain in the Baylis & Harding Affordable Luxury Handicap Chase. He notched a unique double at the Crabbie’s Grand National meeting the following month, when he guided the Kevin Bishoptrained Battle Group to victory in both the Grade Three Silver Cross Handicap Hurdle on the first day and the Betfred TV Handicap Chase on Grand National day. He also won on Oiseau De Nuit in the Grade Three Silver Cross Red Rum Handicap Chase on the opening day of the same meeting. Powell recorded his second Cheltenham Festival winner this year when piloting Present View in the Rewards4Racing Novices’ Handicap Chase for trainer Jamie Snowden. Powell will be riding in the Crabbie’s Grand National for the first time this year on Battle Group. Major Wins include: Baylis & Harding Affordable Luxury Handicap Chase (2012 Golden Chieftain); Silver Cross Handicap Hurdle (2013 Battle Group); Silver Cross Red Rum Handicap Chase (2013 Oiseau De Nuit); Rewards4Racing Novices’ Handicap Chase (2014 Present View).

He was second back over the banks course at Punchestown in February and then produced his highest-rated performance when third to Balthazar King and Any Currency when defending his Cheltenham title.\n\nRace record: Starts 16; wins 3; 2nd 3; 3rd 1. Win & place prize money: £60,829\n\nHugh Duffy & Richard Robinson & Caroline Woods\n\nBig Shu runs for a three-way partnership who, like the horse’s jockey Peter Buchanan, all hail from Northern Ireland. Caroline Woods, from Donemana in County Tyrone, is the partner of trainer Peter Maher and is a physiotherapist who has looked after the Irish army and Northern Ireland’s soccer team. She was a useful amateur rider and finished 11th, albeit beaten 147 lengths, on Younowhat in the 2008 Fox Hunters’ Chase over the large fences at Aintree. Her father Lindsay trains in County Tyrone and he handled Big Shu’s ill-fated half-brother Big Boots. Derry-based Hugh Duffy, from a well-known bookmaking family, and Richard Robinson from Newcastle in County Down, who both coowned Big Boots, complete the partnership. No previous Crabbie’s Grand National runners\n\nPeter Maher (County Kildare, Ireland)\n\nBorn: February 5, 1971 Background: Maher was born in Clondalkin, a small town just outside Dublin, and is from an influential racing family. His grandfather, Frank Latham, was responsible for Blackrath Stud which, in the 1960s and 70s, stood some of the best stallions in Ireland, including Le Bavard, Vulgan and Escart III, the sire of the 1975 Grand National winner L’Escargot. Maher is now the master of that particular stud, as well as Ashfield Stud near Donore in County Kildare, where he trains a team of 10 racehorses. He used to visit Blackrath Stud as a child during the summer holidays and first started in the local pony club before progressing to riding in point-to-points. He broke his back as an 18-year-old following a fall from his motorbike and was in a bodycast for nine months. After recovering from this, he went to work for trainer P P Hogan (where he developed his love of banks races), as well as Francis Flood, before heading back to Blackrath and Ashfield to start a training career alongside running the studs. Maher’s biggest success to date came at the Cheltenham Festival in 2013 when Big Shu won the Glenfarclas Cross-Country Handicap Chase and he also finished third in this year’s race. The horse has proven himself to be one of the best cross-country chasers of his generation, having also won the La Touche Cup at Punchestown in April, 2013. Maher was also responsible for Gerry Feilden winner Ifandbutwhynot (now with David O’Meara) earlier on in his career. Big Shu will be Peter Maher’s first runner in the Crabbie’s Grand National. Major wins include: Glenfarclas Cross Country Chase (2013 Big Shu).\n\nPrevious Crabbie’s Grand National runners: None\n\nPeter Buchanan\n\nBorn: August 6, 1978 Background: Hailing from Northern Ireland, he earned a degree in finance and accountancy at Trinity College Dublin before establishing his credentials as a professional horseman. He represented Ireland in the European eventing championships and when turning his attentions to point-to-pointing, a sphere in which his father and uncle enjoyed much success, he rode around 50 winners. The first of his nine winners under Rules in Ireland came on the Denise Foster-trained Polaris Flame in a hunter chase at the 2000 Punchestown Festival. He turned professional when a change in the Rules allowed jump jockeys to claim an allowance after they had reached the age of 26, which had previously been the cut-off point. He joined County Durham-based Howard Johnson in 2003, and that year recorded his first success in Britain on the now-disbarred trainer’s Teme Valley at Sedgefield on Boxing Day. He joined Lucinda Russell as first jockey in the summer of 2004, with Catch The Perk providing his first winner for his new boss at Hexham in March, 2004. Buchanan’s biggest successes have come in the Grand National Trial at Haydock, which he has won three times, in 2005 on the Richard Ford-trained Forest Gunner, on whom he had three months earlier won the Betfred Grand Sefton Chase over the National fences at Aintree, and in 2010 and 2011 on Russell’s charge Silver By Nature.\n\nCrabbie’s Grand National Record: 2005 Strong Resolve (17th), 2006 Tyneandthyneagain (Fell 1st); 2011 Silver By Nature (12th); 2013 Mr Moonshine (PU 27th)\n\nBuckers Bridge (IRE) 8-10-10\n\nBreeding: b g Pelder – La Fiere Dame (Lafontaine)\n\nBreeder: M A Molloy\n\nBorn: Feb 27, 2006\n\nOwner: Ann & Alan Potts Partnership\n\nTrainer: Henry de Bromhead IRE Jockey: Andrew Lynch\n\nForm: 111/15165-05103\n\n*One of the least experienced in the field. The Crabbie’s Grand National will be his 13th start in a career that began in November, 2011.\n\n*Qualified for the race at the most recent time of asking, when he finished third to subsequent Cheltenham Gold Cup runner-up On His Own in the three-mile, one furlong Grade Two Bobbyjo Chase at Fairyhouse in February.\n\n*Before that, his best performance was to beat Oscars Well over two and a half miles at Gowran in November. He had also accounted for Twinlight at Navan earlier in the year.\n\nRace record: Starts 12; wins 5; 2nd 0; 3rd 1 Win & place prize money: £52,211\n\nAnn & Alan Potts Partnership\n\nAlan Potts (born 1937) established the Derbyshire-based MMD Group in 1978 after the National Coal Board asked him for a way to prevent large lumps of coal blocking conveyor belts. Potts came up with a sizing machine that became the standard for all UK pits. Since then, MMD has branched out into increasingly sophisticated mining and quarrying equipment worldwide. The company is owned and run by Potts and his wife Ann. Potts was born in Great Houghton, South Yorkshire and started working at the age of 15 as a sweeper-up in the pit fitting shop at Houghton Main Colliery. He quickly progressed on the NCB’s apprenticeship and management schemes, meaning that by age of 40 he was area mechanical engineer with 14 mines under his supervision, and inventing machinery as he went along. Having been interested in racing since he was teenager, Potts teamed up with Irish trainer Henry de Bromhead in 2005 after reading an article in the Racing Post Weekender about the trainer. The best horse he has owned to date is seven-time Grade One Sizing Europe, winner of the Arkle Chase in 2010 and the Queen Mother Champion Chase in 2011. He also won the Cross-Country Chase at the Cheltenham Festival with Sizing Australia in 2011. No previous Crabbie’s Grand National runners\n\nHenry de Bromhead (County Waterford, Ireland)\n\nBorn: October 28, 1972 Background: De Bromhead is the son of former farmer and trainer Harry de Bromhead. He initially trained to be an accountant but left college after realising that this career was not for him. He took a job at Coolmore Stud and worked with Robert Alner in Dorset, as well as with his father, before joining Sir Mark Prescott’s Newmarket yard. He also worked at Tattersalls for three months before returning to Coolmore Stud in 1998. After his father had been incapacitated by a stroke in 1999, he took over the reins at the County Waterford yard and sent out his first winner with his very first runner when Fidalus won at Tramore on New Year’s Day in 2000. De Bromhead trained a stream of winners in his first few years – including Feeling Grand, River Clodagh and Whatareyouhaving – but his career was to take a different direction when he took a phone call from Alan Potts in 2004, who wanted to buy his smart pointer Oscar India. Although de Bromhead was reluctant to sell Oscar India, he did persuade Potts to buy two horses from him and, more importantly, keep them in his yard. The two that Potts bought had wretched luck (one died of colic and the other suffered a career-ending injury on the gallops) but Potts was undeterred and bought 14 horses in the summer of 2005 to send to de Bromhead. One of those horses, Sizing Europe, went on to propel de Bromhead into the big time. The son of Pistolet Bleu won the Grade One Irish Champion Hurdle in January, 2008, before embarking on a chase campaign which saw him progress into one of the best two-milers of his generation. He won the Queen Mother Champion Chase in March, 2011, as well as the Grade One Tingle Creek in December, 2011. De Bromhead also trained Special Tiara to win the Doom Bar Maghull Novices’ Chase at Aintree in April of last year. Buckers Bridge will be De Bromhead’s first runner in the Crabbie’s Grand National. Major wins include: Irish Champion Hurdle (2008 Sizing Europe); Irish Arkle Chase (2010 An Cathaoir Mor); Arkle Challenge Trophy (2010 Sizing Europe); Queen Mother Champion Chase (2011 Sizing Europe); Tingle Creek Chase (2011 Sizing Europe); Doom Bar Maghull Novices’ Chase (2013 Special Tiara).\n\nPrevious Crabbie’s Grand National runners: None\n\nAndrew Lynch\n\nBorn: October 5, 1984, and raised in Ashbourne, Co Meath Background: Lynch made his debut as an amateur in a Fairyhouse bumper in April, 2001, and enjoyed a first success 13 months later when Tristernagh landed a novice hurdle at Downpatrick on May 18, 2002. But he struggled for winners over the next two years before a more productive 2004/05 campaign persuaded Lynch to turn professional at the end of July, 2005. He recorded a first Grade One success when scoring on the Jim Dreaper-trained Notre Pere in the Knight Frank Ganly Walters Novice Chase at Leopardstown in December, 2007. He posted a first big-race success in Britain in March, 2006, when he partnered the Ado McGuinness-trained Victram to success in the Imperial Cup at Sandown and he was also on board Notre Pere when he triumphed in the 2008 Welsh National at Chepstow. Lynch has enjoyed a pair of wins at the Cheltenham Festival in both 2010 and 2011, including the superb victories of Sizing Europe in the Arkle Trophy Chase and the Queen Mother Champion Chase. He also enjoyed three Grade One victories on Flemenstar for trainer Peter Casey. Lynch is also bidding to complete a notable Derby-Grand National double, having won the Amateur Derby on Tender Falcon at Epsom Downs in August, 2004.\n\nCrabbie’s Grand National record: 2011 Vic Venturi (BD 2nd); 2012 Treacle (Fell 10th)\n\nBurton Port (IRE) 10-10-08\n\nBreeding: b g Bob Back (USA) – Despute (IRE) (Be My Native (USA))\n\nBreeder: Thomas Meagher\n\nBorn: March 27, 2004\n\nOwner: Trevor Hemmings\n\nTrainer: Jonjo O’Neill\n\nJockey: Brian Harding\n\nForm: 113342/1211121/2/242/509P82\n\nBurton Port\n\n*High-class chaser, having finished second in the RSA Chase at The Cheltenham Festival in 2010 and chased home Diamond Harry in the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury later the same year.\n\n*Boasts an excellent record at Aintree, winning the Betfred Mobile Mildmay Novices’ Chase in April, 2010, and filling the runner-up spot in the Betfred Bowl at the same meeting in 2012, both on the Mildmay Course.\n\n*Missed the whole of the 2012/2013 campaign with a tendon injury and moved from Nicky Henderson to Jonjo O’Neill ahead of the current season. *Runner-up on most recent start in extended three and a quarter-mile veterans’ handicap chase at Newbury on March 1, by far his best form of the season with first-time cheek-pieces.\n\nRace Record (under Rules): Starts: 23; Wins: 7; 2nd: 7; 3rd: 2; Win & Place prize money: £266,760\n\nTrevor Hemmings CVO\n\nBorn: June 11, 1935 Background: Brought up in Woolwich Arsenal, South-East London, where his father worked at the Royal Ordnance factory. Was sent to Lancashire as a five-year-old during World War II and began life as a bricklayer’s apprentice after leaving school aged 15, before becoming involved in the Pontins holiday business. Eventually became the owner and sold it to Scottish & Newcastle in exchange for a significant shareholding in S & N (in 1989). Bought Pontins back in 2000 but retained a stake in S & N, which netted him £218 million when the company was sold in January, 2008. Sold Blackpool Tower and the Winter Gardens to the North West resort’s town council for £40 million in March, 2010. In 2012, agreed to sell his major shareholding in Arena Leisure Plc, which owned Folkestone, Lingfield, Southwell, Wolverhampton and Windsor racecourses and managed Doncaster and Worcester, to the Reuben brothers. Arena also has a major part of specialist broadcaster At The Races which owns some of British racing’s media rights. Owns a share of Preston North End FC and is chairman of the TJH Foundation, a charity which makes grants to organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Relief, St John Ambulance, Crimestoppers Trust, Royal National Lifeboat Association, the Injured Jockeys’ Fund and Racing Welfare. In 2011, he was appointed a Commander of the Victorian Order (CVO) for his work as vice-president of the Princess Royal Trust Carers. In 2013, the Sunday Times estimated Hemmings’ wealth at £610 million. Also has eventers who are ridden by Zara Phillips – she rode the Hemmingsowned High Kingdom (whose stable nickname is “Trev”) when winning team silver in three-day eventing at London 2012. Racing Interests: Fulfilled one of his greatest ambitions when Hedgehunter carried his colours to victory in the 2005 Crabbie’s Grand National. After years of trying, Hemmings had finally emulated his mentor Fred Pontin, owner of the 1971 National hero Specify, with his 13th Grand National runner. Ballabriggs added a memorable second Crabbie’s Grand National success in 2011. First winner came on the Flat in 1985 but Hemmings now brings on young jumping stock at Gleadhill House Stud, near Chorley, Lancashire, managed by former trainer Mick Meagher, and at his Monymusk Stud in Co Cork. First tried to win the Crabbie’s Grand National with the Stan Mellor-trained Rubika, who finished 14th in 1992. Hemmings, who was made an honorary Jockey Club member in December, 2006, is based on the Isle of Man and is said to have paid £12 million for the Ballavoddan estate on the island where his retired horses live. Has enjoyed 11 winners at the Cheltenham Festival, headed by dual Ryanair Chase hero Albertas Run.\n\nCrabbie’s Grand National Record: 1992 Rubika (14th); 2000 The Last Fling (7th); Esprit De Cotte (Fell 22nd); 2001 The Last Fling (UR 5th), Esprit De Cotte (UR 11th); 2002 Goguenard (Fell 1st), Beau (UR 14th); 2003 Southern Star (14th), Chives (PU bef 12th); 2004 Arctic Jack (Fell 1st), Southern Star (PU bef 9th), Hedgehunter (Fell 30th); 2005 HEDGEHUNTER (WON), Europa (20th); 2006 Hedgehunter (2nd), Juveigneur (Fell 1st), 2007 Hedgehunter (9th), Billyvoddan (PU bef 19th); 2008 Cloudy Lane (6th), Hedgehunter (13th), Idle Talk (14th); 2009 Idle Talk (12th), Battlecry (16th), Cloudy Lane (UR 15th); 2010 Cloudy Lane (8th); 2011 BALLABRIGGS\n\n(WON), King Fontaine (11th); 2012 Ballabriggs (6th); 2013 Ballabriggs (PU bef 24th)\n\nJonjo O’Neill (Jackdaws Castle, Gloucestershire)\n\nBorn: April 13, 1952. Background: Champion jump jockey twice (1977/78 and 1979/80) and set a then record for a season of 149 winners in his first championship year. The most sensational moment of his riding career came when he won the Cheltenham Gold Cup on Dawn Run in 1986 as the mare became the only horse to win that trophy after having previously taken the Champion Hurdle (1984), again with O’Neill in the saddle. This was one of nine victories at the Cheltenham Festival but, despite this successful riding career, he had a dreadful record in the Grand National and never completed the race in eight rides. He retired at the end of the 1985/86 season and, having survived lymphatic cancer not long after that, started training near Penrith, Cumbria, in 1987. Moved to his present base at Jackdaws Castle near Cheltenham when the yard was bought by owner J P McManus in 2001. In 2010, O’Neill finally broke his Grand National duck when saddling Don’t Push It to victory for McManus, who had been trying to win the race since 1982. Achievements: Has trained 25 Cheltenham Festival winners. Major wins include: Betfred Cheltenham Gold Cup (2012 Synchronised), Doom Bar Aintree Hurdle (2004 Rhinestone Cowboy), Ladbrokes World Hurdle (2004 Iris’ Gift, 2014 More Of That), Lexus Chase (2008 Exotic Dancer, 2012 Synchronised), Ryanair Chase (2010 & 2011 Albertas Run), williamhill.com Christmas Hurdle (2002 & 2003 Intersky Falcon).\n\nCrabbie’s Grand National Record: 2003 Carbury Cross (7th); 2004 Clan Royal (2nd), Joss Naylor (PU bef 19th); 2005 Simply Gifted (3rd), Shamawan (21st), Native Emperor (UR 9th), Clan Royal (CO bef 22nd); 2006 Clan Royal (3rd), Risk Accessor (5th); 2007 Clan Royal (11th); 2008 Bob Hall (PU bef 19th), Butler’s Cabin (Fell 22nd); 2009 Butler’s Cabin (7th), Reveillez (BD 3rd), Can’t Buy Time (Fell 18th); 2010 DON’T PUSH IT (WON), Can’t Buy Time (Fell 8t h); 2011 Don’t Push It (3rd), Quolibet (UR 11th), Can’t Buy Time (Fell 18th); 2012 Sunnyhillboy (2nd), Synchronised (Fell 6th) Arbor Supreme (UR 10th); 2013 Lost Glory (PU before 17th), Sunnyhillboy (UR 30th)\n\nBrian Harding\n\nBorn: September 26, 1972, the son of a dairy farmer and point-to-point trainer in Co Cork. He is the oldest jockey riding in this year’s Crabbie’s Grand National. Background: rode in pony races from a young age but originally set out to be a Flat jockey, attached to Kevin Prendergast’s stable in Ireland. His brother Richard is a leading amateur in Ireland and landed a double at the 2006 Cheltenham Festival. After becoming too heavy to pursue a career on the level, Brian joined the late Gordon Richards’ stable at Greystoke in Cumbria in 1992. He still rides primarily for the Greystoke team, which has been under the care of Nicky Richards (Gordon’s son) since 1998 Big-Race Wins: He won three times on McGregor The Third over the cross-country course at Cheltenham, where his greatest win came when standing in for Tony Dobbin in the 1998 Queen Mother Champion Chase on One Man at the Cheltenham Festival. He won the Mildmay Novices’ Chase at Aintree in 1996 on Addington Boy and had a dream ride when third in the 2005 Crabbie’s Grand National on Simply Gifted. He is enjoying his best season since 1999/2000 at the age of 41, with 32 winners up to Tuesday, April\n\n1.

Previously he had finished ninth in the Crabbie’s Topham Chase at last year’s National meeting, fell in the Betfred Grand Sefton Chase in December, 2012 and beat all bar Always Waining in the 2012 Topham.\n\n*Has raced only twice since his Becher Chase success, pulled up on heavy ground at Haydock in January and fourth to Restless Harry at Ascot in February.\n\n*He cost €47,000 as an unbroken three-year-old.\n\n*He is French-bred, as were two of the past five winners. In 2009 Mon Mome became the fourth French-bred horse to win a National (100 years after the third, Lutteur), swiftly followed by Neptune Collonges in 2012. Race record: Starts 33; wins 8; 2nd 2; 3rd 3. Win & place prize money: £182,991\n\nDaphne Du Pre\n\nDaphne Du Pre is a retired teacher who hails from Cam in Gloucestershire. She has been involved in racehorse ownership since the late 1980s and started owning horses in her own right at the turn of this century. Her horses have always been trained by the Philip Hobbs yard and her best runner to date has been Kalca Mome, who won 13 times in a 49-race career, including when beating former Champion Chaser Voy Por Ustedes in a handicap chase at Cheltenham. Her Crabbie’s Grand National runner, Chance Du Roy, is no stranger to the big Aintree fences having run over them four times before, including when winning the Betfred Becher Chase in December. Du Pre is not from a racing background but has had a lifelong interest in the sport and will be present at Aintree on Saturday with family and friends to watch Chance Du Roy in action.\n\nPrevious Crabbie’s Grand National runners: None\n\nPhilip Hobbs (Bilbrook, Somerset)\n\nBorn July 26, 1955 Background: Philip was brought up surrounded by horses. His father Tony Hobbs farmed, and had a permit to train for many years, breeding several good horses to run in the family colours. After school at King’s College, Taunton, Philip went on to Reading University and achieved a BSc honours degree. He rode at Hickstead, show jumping as a junior, and gained several point-to-point winners and winners under National Hunt rules as an amateur before turning professional at the age of 21. Partnered 160 winners in a 10-year riding career including the Black and White Gold Cup at Ascot, the Killiney Novice Chase and the Midlands Grand National on such good horses as West Tip and Artifice. Hobbs made four appearances in the Grand National as a professional jockey in the 1980s and, although one of the best horses he rode was West Tip, he didn’t get the leg up on him in the National, with those four rides resulting in two falls, one ninth place and an 11th. He started training in August, 1985, with only six horses and was successful with his very first runner, North Yard at Exeter. He is now one of Britain’s top jump trainers. Philip’s wife Sarah, whom he married in 1982, is the daughter of Bertie Hill, who won a gold medal in three-day eventing at the 1956 Olympics at Stockholm.

His father Jim is a brother of the brilliant trainer Aidan O’Brien and plays a key role at the Irish champion’s Ballydoyle stable in Co Tipperary. From the age of 13, Tom rode out at weekends and in school holidays at Ballydoyle, aboard champions such as High Chaparral, Rock Of Gibraltar and Mozart. He joined Philip Hobbs’s stable as a 17-year-old, initially riding as an amateur and in point-to-points and had his first success aboard The Names Bond at Warwick on December 18, 2004. O’Brien also has an association with trainer Peter Bowen, for whom he finished second aboard McKelvey when having his first Grand National ride in 2007. He landed the Coral Welsh National in 2009 on Dream Alliance and has enjoyed one success at the Cheltenham Festival – Silk Affair in the 2009 Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle. Aidan O’Brien still takes a keen interest in his nephew’s progress – “when he sits down to watch me ride, he often gets on the phone to give me a rollicking,” said Tom. He partnered the Peter Bowen-trained Always Waining to two of his record-breaking three successes over the Grand National fences at Aintree and also won the 2013 Betfred Becher Chase on the Hobbs-trained Chance Du Roy. Crabbie’s Grand National Record: 2007 McKelvey (2nd); 2008 McKelvey (UR 20th); 2009 Zabenz (Fell16th); 2010 Dream Alliance (PU Bef 24th); 2013 Always Waining (10th)\n\nColbert Station (IRE) 10-11-00\n\nBreeding: b g Witness Box (USA) — Laurenca´s Girl (IRE) (Commanche Run)\n\nBreeder: Mary Murphy\n\nBorn: April 25, 2004\n\nOwner: J P McManus\n\nTrainer: Ted Walsh\n\nJockey: Mark Walsh\n\nForm: 364/46951177/413/5211U-03U0F\n\n*Strongly fancied for last year’s Crabbie’s Grand National on the back of a decisive success in the three-mile Paddy Power Handicap Chase at Leopardstown in December, 2012, but unseated A P McCoy at the 15th (The Chair).\n\n*Has been mixing chasing and hurdling in five starts this season, with the best effort coming when third to Cootamundra in the valuable Troytown Handicap Chase over three miles at Navan in November.\n\n*Fell on latest outing in the two mile and five furlong Carrickmines Handicap Chase at Leopardstown on March 2.

Background: John Patrick ‘J P’ McManus attended the Christian Brothers school on Sexton Street, Limerick. He left his father’s plant hire business at the age of 20 to become a racecourse bookmaker, but then took the less well-trodden route of gamekeeper-turned-poacher when becoming a professional punter. McManus recalls one of his first bets as being on Merryman II in the 1960 Grand National when he was just nine, but the bet that changed his life was £4 on Linden Tree in a Newmarket maiden in 1970, the horse winning at 100/8. He had another £4 on when Linden Tree won the Observer Gold Cup at 25/1, and £5 each-way at 33/1 for the Derby, when the horse beat all bar Mill Reef. He was dubbed “the Sundance Kid” by journalist Hugh McIlvanney after landing a number of major gambles during the 1970s. McManus has a host of business interests including dealing on the financial markets from his Geneva, Switzerland, base and part-ownership of the Sandy Lane Hotel in Barbados, where he also has a house. With John Magnier, he bought a 28.7% stake in Manchester United through the Cubic Expression company before subsequently selling out to US tycoon Malcolm Glazer in 2005. He was in the news shortly after that because of his stake in the pub and restaurant operator Mitchells and Butler. In 2013, the Sunday Times estimated McManus’ wealth at £530 million, making him the 12th richest person in Ireland. Racing interests: McManus purchased his first racehorse, Cill Dara, at the age of 26 and is the biggest jump owner in terms of numbers in Britain, Ireland and France (some 300 horses spread over 50 trainers ran for him last season). He owns Jackdaws Castle, the Gloucestershire yard that Jonjo O’Neill trains from, and has invested heavily in improving facilities since purchasing the property in 2001. Mister Donovan provided him with his first Cheltenham Festival success in the 1982 Supreme Novices’ Hurdle and since then McManus has enjoyed 40 other winners at the meeting. The mighty Istabraq is the most revered horse he has owned following three consecutive victories in the Champion Hurdle (1998,1999,2000), while he has also won a Betfred Cheltenham Gold Cup with Synchronised (2012) and three Ladbrokes World Hurdles with Baracouda (2002 & 2003) and More Of That (2014). A full 28 years after his runner in the race, McManus finally achieved a long-held ambition when Don’t Push It won the 2010 Crabbie’s Grand National. He has also been British champion owner for the 2005/6, 2006/7, 2008/9, 2009/10, 2011/12 and 2012/13 seasons. Other interests: McManus does a lot of work for charity and his Pro-Am golf tournament, which takes place every five years, has raised over 95 million euros. McManus is also a keen backgammon player and a big hurling fan.

His father, Ruby, had a public house and kept a livery stable in Fermoy. In 1954 the Walsh family relocated to the United States, but came back to Ireland less than two years later and Ruby rented a yard at Chapelizod, Co Dublin. The family later moved to a farm in Kill, Co Kildare, which Ted has now extended to 60 acres. Walsh was Irish champion amateur jockey on 11 occasions, and rode four Cheltenham Festival winners, including the 1979 Queen Mother Champion Chase on Hilly Way. Walsh’s eldest son Ruby is the eight-time champion Jump jockey of Ireland, while another of his children Katie is also a successful jockey with two Cheltenham Festival wins to her name and a third on Seabass in the 2012 Crabbie’s Grand National (the highest finish to date by a female rider). Walsh’s other daughter Jennifer is agent to Ruby, while his other son Ted Jnr married leading jockey Nina Carberry on February 7, 2012. Achievements: Sent out Commanche Court to land the Triumph Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival in 1997. Ted and Ruby combined to win the Crabbie’s Grand National with Papillon in 2000. They also teamed up to take the Irish equivalent 16 days later with Commanche Court. Crabbie’s Grand National Record: 1992 Roc De Prince (17th); 2000 PAPILLON (WON), 2001 Papillon (4th), 2006 Jack High (UR 15th), Rince Ri\n\n(Ref 27th); 2007 Jack High (Fell 6th); 2009 Southern Vic (8th); 2012 Seabass (3rd); 2013 Seabass (13th), Colbert Station (UR 15th)\n\nMark Walsh\n\nBorn March 23, 1986 Background: Mark Walsh grew up surrounded by horses in Clane, County Kildare. Although not related to Ted and Ruby, Mark’s cousin David was also a successful jockey who rode Barton Bank to finish second to Mr Mulligan in the 1997 Cheltenham Gold Cup. Walsh began riding ponies and going hunting from an early age and soon progressed to race-riding on the pony circuit. He started to work for Christy Roche when he was 15 but enjoyed his first winner for permit holder Marcus Callaghan (who was also celebrating his maiden victory) when Shrug landed a handicap hurdle at Punchestown on September 29, 2002. His only other success that season was on the Roche-trained Allofasudden, who took a handicap hurdle at the 2003 Punchestown Festival, but he soon started firing in the winners, with 12 successes in 2003/04 and 19 victories the following season. But the winners were harder to come by in the following three seasons as he failed to reach double figures. That changed in the 2008/09 campaign when he hit 19 winners once again and enjoyed big-race success on the Tom Taaffe-trained Glenfinn Captain in the Grade Two Red Mills Chase at Gowran Park, and the Francis Flood-trained P’tit Fute, who won valuable handicap hurdles at Galway and Leopardstown. On his Aintree debut in 2004, Walsh partnered Puck Out to triumph in a handicap hurdle. Walsh has failed to get around the course in four attempts at the Crabbie’s Grand National. He has struck up a good relationship with several of J P McManus’s horses, such as Aranleigh and Captain Cee Bee and in 2012 won the Galway Plate and Dan Moore Handicap Chase at Fairyhouse on Bob Lingo. He enjoyed Grade One success earlier this season when the Paul Nolan-trained Defy Logic landed the Grade One Racing Post Novice Chase at Leopardstown over Christmas. Crabbie’s Grand National Record: 2009 Reveillez (BD 3rd); 2011 Quolibet (UR 11th); 2012 Arbor Supreme (UR 10th); 2013 Lost Glory (PU 17th).\n\nDouble Seven (IRE) 8-10-11\n\nBreeding: b g Milan — Bargante (IRE) (Phardante (FR))\n\nBreeder: M Doran\n\nBorn: March 5, 2006\n\nOwner: J P McManus\n\nTrainer: Martin Brassil\n\nJockey: A P McCoy\n\nForm: 4177/311100/62P8P47P0P-F111116\n\n*Sold for 26,000 euros at the 2009 Tattersalls Ireland Derby Sale.\n\n*Off the mark at the second time of asking in a two mile, two furlong Sligo maiden hurdle in September, 2010.\n\n*Winless in three subsequent starts, but completed a three-timer in a Tipperary handicap hurdle in October, 2011.\n\n*Made debut over fences at the same course in June, 2012, but failed to win in first 11 starts over the larger obstacles.\n\n*Finally got off the mark in a two and a half mile handicap chase at Kilbeggan on June 24, 2013, and followed up in the competitive Gigginstown House Midlands National over three miles and a furlong at the same course on July 19.

He had started working with ponies at the age of 19 and then spent a long time (1977-1986) with Mick O’Toole where he looked after the 1979 Irish 2,000 Guineas winner Dickens Hill before becoming head man at Neil McGrath’s Brownstown Stud before starting up on his own. He took out a trainer’s licence in 1994 and his first winner came with Nordic Thorn in a maiden hurdle at Killarney in May that year. Achievements: Sent out Numbersixvalverde to win the 2006 Crabbie’s Grand National. Major wins include: Pat Taaffe Handicap Chase (2009 Ambobo), An Uaimh Chase (2007 Nickname), Tied Cottage Chase (2007 Nickname), Normans Grove Chase (2007 & 2008 Nickname), Paddy Power Dial-A-Bet Chase (2006 Nickname), Fortria Chase (2006 Nickname), Paddy Fitzpatrick Memorial Novice Chase (2006 Nickname), Irish Grand National (2005 Numbersixvalverde), Thyestes Chase (2005 Numbersixvalverde), Ballybrit Novice Chase (1996 Nordic Thorn) Crabbie’s Grand National Record:\n\n2006 NUMBERSIXVALVERDE (WON); 2007 Numbersixvalverde (6th)\n\nA P McCoy\n\nBorn Moneyglass, Co Antrim, Northern Ireland on May 4, 1974 Background: 18-time champion A P (Tony) McCoy is the greatest jump jockey of his era and many would argue of all time. He is the son of Peadar McCoy, who bred the 1993 County Hurdle victor Thumbs Up. McCoy started out with Billy Rock, riding out from the age of 12, before trying his luck as a Flat jockey with Jim Bolger and rode his first winner on Legal Steps at Thurles on March 26, 1992. Since growing too heavy and turning to jump racing, he has not looked back. He partnered his first British winner, Chickabiddy, at Exeter on September 7, 1994 and was champion conditional rider in Britain in 1994/5 with a then record 74 winners when attached to Toby Balding’s Hampshire yard. He took his first senior title the following season with 174 wins. His domination has brought 18 consecutive jump jockeys’ titles and he is currently well on course for number 19 this season. McCoy broke Peter Scudamore’s record of 221 wins in the 1997/8 season with 253 successes and broke his own record for the fastest 200 winners in the 1999/2000 season, ending up with 245 successes. In 2001/02 he beat by 20 the record of 269 winners in any season set by Flat jockey Sir Gordon Richards. He recently reached 200 winners for this season, his sixth double century, and in November achieved an amazing 4,000th career success. He has had a total of 30 Cheltenham Festival successes, including the Gold Cup on Mr Mulligan (1997) and Synchronised (2012) and the 2006 and 2010 Champion Hurdles with Brave Inca and Binocular. In April, 2004, he left Martin Pipe’s stable after accepting a reportedly huge retainer from J P McManus and rides for the owner’s principal trainer in Britain, Jonjo O’Neill. He scored a longawaited victory in the Grand National aboard Don’t Push It in 2010, his 15th ride in the race. That landmark win helped towards him being crowned BBC Sports Personality of the Year that December. McCoy also rides regularly for Nicky Henderson. His wife Chanelle gave birth to their daughter Eve late in 2007 and their son Archie last year. McCoy was made an MBE in the 2003 Queen’s Birthday Honours List and his achievements were recognised with a reception at Stormont, the seat of government in Northern Ireland, in August, 2009. In the 2010 Birthday Honours List he was made an OBE.\n\nCrabbie’s Grand National Record: 1995 Chatam (Fell 12th), 1996 Deep Bramble (PU bef 2 out); 1998 Challenger Du Luc (Fell 1st); 1999 Eudipe (Fell 22nd); 2000 Dark Stranger (UR 3rd); 2001 Blowing Wind (3rd), 2002 Blowing Wind (3rd), 2003 Iris Bleu (PU bef 16th); 2004 Jurancon II (Fell 4th); 2005 Clan Royal (CO 22nd); 2006 Clan Royal (3rd); 2007 L’Ami (10th); 2008 Butler’s Cabin (Fell 22nd); 2009 Butler’s Cabin (7th): 2010 DON’T PUSH IT (WON); 2011 Don’t Push It (3rd); 2012 Synchronised (Fell 6th); 2013 Colbert Station (UR 15th).\n\nGolan Way (IRE) 10-10-05\n\nBreeding: b g Golan – Silk Daisy (Barathea)\n\nBreeder: Lewis Caterers\n\nBorn: February 6, 2004\n\nOwner: W R B Racing 58\n\nTrainer: Tim Vaughan\n\nJockey: Michael Byrne\n\nForm: 111140/2U1P4/1413/R81R/3-U1\n\n*Sold for 15,000gns as a yearling to race on the Flat, then £13,000 as a four-year-old as a potential jumper.\n\n*Failed to shine on the Flat – his sole success in 15 runs was a short-head victory in a Class 5 race at Wolverhampton – but took to jumping immediately, with four novice hurdle wins in a row, including at Grade Two level at Cheltenham.

They have had around 90 horses since their inception and their current trainers are David Nicholls, Tim Vaughan, David O’Meara, Sheena West, Harry Dunlop and Noel Wilson. Their first runner was in November, 1988 and their first winner, Rothko, trained by George Moore, was in April, 1989. Their best horses include Kylkenny (winner of 24 races), Gulf Shaadi (winner of £140,000 in prize money) and Golan Way (winner of a Grade Two hurdle at Cheltenham). The syndicate manager, Andy Bates, has been with WRB from their inception and has been organising racing partnerships for the past 25 years. Each syndicate is separate and this particular partnership has owned three horses in total with WRB. Their first horse, Kalmini, was a decent juvenile hurdler and won two races over jumps before suffering a career ending injury in the Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival in 2006. The horse they bought to replace her suffered a heart attack on the gallops but the syndicate persevered and was rewarded when Golan Way made an immediate impact over hurdles, winning a Grade Two novice hurdle at Cheltenham in November, 2008. The 10strong syndicate includes members from all walks of life, including a businessman who lives on the Swiss border and works in France. The majority of the syndicate will be present at Aintree on Saturday to cheer on Golan Way and this will be their first runner in the Crabbie’s Grand National. They will also be hoping that the horse continues a unique record as he has won on his third start each season since he went jumping.\n\nPrevious Crabbie’s Grand National runners: None\n\nTim Vaughan (Cowbridge, Glamorgan)\n\nBorn: August 25, 1979 Background: Tim Vaughan is one the brightest young training talents in Jump racing. The son of a car repair specialist and hobby farmer, Vaughan has ridden since the age of two, riding for his local pony club which included being a proud member of the Prince Phillip Cup Team, where he competed for Wales at the Royal Windsor Horse Show and the Horse of the Year Show at Wembley. He later showjumped and finished fourth in the Junior Foxhunters Final at the Horse of the Year Show and he also represented Wales’s Under 21 team at Muirmill, Scotland. At 16, he began his race riding career in point-to-points. Some of the highlights were being crowned Welsh men’s point-to-point champion rider in 2004 and 2007, as well as riding in the Fox Hunters’ at Aintree over the Grand National fences partnering 100 winners in point-to-points. Vaughan studied for a property management & valuation degree at Glamorgan University prior to becoming a qualified chartered surveyor. He then spent the next four years working for Knight Frank, prior to setting up a commercial department at regional estate agents, chartered surveyors and property auctioneers, Cowbridge-based Herbert R Thomas. His first runner as a permit trainer was Lonesome Man in a handicap chase at Aintree in June, 2005, who won by 22 lengths. He took out a full licence in 2006. Tim’s wife Abbi is his assistant and a successful point-to-point trainer in her own right. He has enjoyed feature race success at Aintree with Saint Are (Grade One novices’ hurdle 2011) and Stewarts House (Betfred Grand Sefton Handicap Chase 2011), at Ayr with Beshabar (Grade Three Coral Scottish Grand National 2011) and at Punchestown with Spirit Of Adjisa (Grade One Cathal Ryan Memorial Champion Novices Hurdle 2011).\n\nCrabbie’s Grand National Record: 2012 Postmaster (PU 22nd), 2013 Saint Are (9th)\n\nMichael Byrne\n\nBorn: April 16, 1988 Background: Byrne is a promising conditional jockey based with trainer Tim Vaughan in Aberthin, South Wales. He was initially attached to Peter Bowen’s yard and had his first ride in the 2009/10 season. He rode his first winner aboard Big Time Billy for the trainer in a National Hunt Flat race at Ludlow in March, 2010. He developed a good rapport with Bowen’s Cheltenham Gold Cup runner-up Take The Stand the following season, winning two hunter chases on board the gelding at Cheltenham and Aintree. He joined the Vaughan yard at the beginning of the 2011/12 season and has also ridden a number of horses for Neil Mulholland. The biggest winner of his career came in March of this year when he guided Carole’s Destrier to success for Mulholland in the Kempton Park Silver Plate. He will be having his first ride in the Crabbie’s Grand National on board the Tim Vaughan-trained Golan Way.\n\nPrevious Crabbie’s Grand National rides: None\n\nGoonyella (IRE) 7-10-01\n\nBreeding: Presenting – Miss Fresher (Pampabird)\n\nBreeder: Mrs C T and Miss S Berry Born: May 20, 2007\n\nOwner: Ann and Alan Potts Partnership\n\nTrainer: Jim Dreaper IRE Jockey: Paddy Brennan\n\nForm: 8/12/F211133P1-3582\n\n*Has graduated from the point-to-point and hunterchase field, in which sphere he won three in a row in November and December 2012.\n\n*Scored his sole success in handicap company in a three mile, six furlong contest in heavy ground at the Punchestown Festival in April last year, staying on dourly to beat Vesper Bell a head in receipt of 18lb.\n\n*Well backed for the Welsh National at Chepstow in December – he started 8/1 second favourite – but could finish only eighth. *Bounced back with second place over hurdles at Clonmel to Don Poli, subsequent easy winner of the Martin Pipe Conditional Jockeys’ Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival.\n\n*Has been through an Irish auction ring twice, sold for €34,000 as a yearling and €55,000 as an unbroken three-year-old to his current connections.\n\nRace record: Starts 16; wins 5; 2nd 4; 3rd 2. Win & place prize money: £29,651.\n\nAnn & Alan Potts Partnership\n\nAlan Potts (born 1937) established the Derbyshire-based MMD Group in 1978 after the National Coal Board asked him for a way to prevent large lumps of coal blocking conveyor belts. Potts came up with a sizing machine that became the standard for all UK pits. Since then, MMD has branched out into increasingly sophisticated mining and quarrying equipment worldwide. The company is owned and run by Potts and his wife Ann. Potts was born in Great Houghton, South Yorkshire and started working at the age of 15 as a sweeper-up in the pit fitting shop at Houghton Main Colliery. He quickly progressed on the NCB’s apprenticeship and management schemes a, meaning that by age of 40 he was area mechanical engineer with 14 mines under his supervision, and inventing machinery as he went along. Having been interested in racing since he was teenager, Potts teamed up with Irish trainer Henry de Bromhead in 2005 after reading an article in the Racing Post Weekender about the trainer. The best horse he has owned to date is seven-time Grade One Sizing Europe, winner of the Arkle Chase in 2010 and the Queen Mother Champion Chase in 2011. He also won the Cross Country Chase at the Cheltenham Festival with Sizing Australia in 2011. No previous Crabbie’s Grand National runners\n\nJim Dreaper (Greenogue, Kilsallaghan, Co Dublin)\n\nBorn: January 30, 1951 Background: Dreaper comes from one of the most famous families in Irish racing. His father, Tom, trained the greatest steeplechaser of them all, Arkle, as well as Flyingbolt, who is seen as by many as the second-best. As a jockey, Dreaper rode Black Secret to second place in the Grand National, losing by a neck by Specify in 1971. Black Secret also finished third behind Well To Do when trained by Dreaper in 1972. He took out his training licence at the age of 20 and got straight to work, clocking up his first win just two months into his career in the Schweppes Gold Trophy with Good Review in 1972. He was champion jumps trainer in Ireland in each of his first five seasons and, in 1974, he trained Colebridge to win the Irish Grand National, winning with Brown Lad the following two years and again in 1978. He also trained the winners of the Cheltenham Gold Cup, Queen Mother Champion Chase and World Hurdle in 1975 with Ten Up, Lough Inagh and Brown Lad respectively. Dreaper has an enviable list of wins to his name, having also won the Welsh Grand National, the Sun Alliance Chase, the Hennessy Cognac Gold Cup, the Martell Cup Chase, the Dr P. J. Moriarty Novice Chase and the Power Gold Cup. Ten Up landed the 1974 Sun Alliance Novices’ Chase and the Cheltenham Gold Cup. Brown Lad won the 1974 Sun Alliance Hurdle at Cheltenham, the Reynoldstown Chase at Ascot and the Lloyds Bank Hurdle in Cheltenham in 1975. He became the only horse to win three Irish Grand Nationals in 1975, 1976 and again in 1978. The 1980s saw the arrival of the hugely talented Carvill’s Hill. While he was a troubled horse, he won the 1989 Hennessy Cognac Gold Cup, the John Durkan Memorial Chase under Ken Morgan and the 1989 Vincent O´Brien Irish Gold Cup Chase among others before being sold to owner Paul Green, who transferred the horse to Martin Pipe. In recent years, the stable flag bearer has been Notre Pere, who won the Welsh National at Chepstow in December, 2008 and the Punchestown Gold Cup in April, 2009. Goonyella will be Dreaper’s first Crabbie’s Grand National runner since Hard Case fell in the race in 1988. He has had four runners in the race in total. Major wins include: Cheltenham Gold Cup (1975 Ten Up); Irish Grand National (1974 Colebridge; 1975, 1976, 1978 Brown Lad); Hennessy Gold Cup (1989 Carvill’s Hill); Durkan Punchestown Chase (1994, 1995 Merry Gale); Nas Na Riogh Novice Chase (2004 Jim); Welsh National (2008 Notre Pere); Punchestown Gold Cup (2009 Notre Pere).\n\nPrevious Crabbie’s Grand National record: 1972 Black Secret (3rd); 1981 Barney Maclyvie (Fell 1st); 1986 Kilkilowen\n\n(13th); 1988 Hard Case (Fell 19th)\n\nPaddy Brennan\n\nBorn: April 13, 1981, Ardrahan in Co Galway, Ireland Background: spent the summer of 1995 working for County Kildare handler Gerry Stack before embarking on a five-season apprenticeship with the leading Irish Flat trainer Jim Bolger, for whom he rode eight winners. The first of those came on Ivory Isle at Gowran Park in August, 1998. He became too heavy and tall for the Flat and moved to Paul Nicholls’ stable in England as a conditional jockey in 2001. He stayed there for two and a half years, riding winners for Nicholls and Jeff King, before joining Philip Hobbs in the 2003/04 season as one of that yard’s conditionals. Brennan also struck up a good rapport with Ashley Brook, on whom he won the Grade One Maghull Novices’ Chase at Aintree in 2005, and enjoyed a first Cheltenham Festival success that year aboard Shamayoun in the Fred Winter Juvenile Handicap Hurdle. Brennan was appointed as retained rider to owners Andrea and Graham Wylie for the 2006/07 season after dropping into trainer Howard Johnson’s County Durham yard for a cup of tea and toast. He rewarded those connections when guiding Inglis Drever to victory in the 2007 Grade One Ladbrokes World Hurdle at Cheltenham – the gelding’s second success in the race. Brennan left Johnson and joined Gloucestershirebased handler Nigel Twiston-Davies in the 2007/08 season. The 2010 victory aboard Imperial Commander in the Cheltenham Gold Cup provided Paddy Brennan with what he described as the best day of his life and he has ridden a total of six winners at the Cheltenham Festival. He has a good record at Aintree, including Ashley Brook’s win in the 2005 Maghull Novices’ Chase and Hakim’s victory in that year’s Betfred Grand Sefton Handicap Chase over the big fences. He was on Pettifour when taking the 2008 Sefton Novices’ Hurdle, rode Irish Raptor in 2009 when scoring over the National fences in the Crabbie’s Topham Chase, took the 2009 Manifesto Novices’ Chase on Tartak, captured the 2010 Aintree Hurdle on Khyber Kim and was successful on Nacarat in the 2011 Betfred Bowl. He left Twiston-Davies after four years to become a freelance in March, 2011. His best British tally of winners was 104 in 2007/8 and he was on 74 winners this season (up to Tuesday, April 1), when mainly riding for Tom George and Fergal O’Brien.\n\nCrabbie’s Grand National Record: 2005 Double Honour (UR 21st); 2007 Bewleys Berry (Fell 22nd); 2008 Fundamentalist (Fell 3rd); 2009 Knowhere (PU 25th); 2010 Irish Raptor (Fell 14th); 2012 Giles Cross (PU 11th)\n\nHawkes Point (GB) 9-10-06\n\nBreeding: b g Kayf Tara – Mandys Native (Be My Native)\n\nBreeder: Miss J L Egan Born: April 15, 2005\n\nOwner: Graham Roach\n\nTrainer: Paul Nicholls\n\nJockey: Ryan Mahon\n\nForm: 35/125/212P-426\n\n*One of the least experienced in the field.

Win & place prize money: £42,415\n\nGraham Roach\n\nGraham Roach is one of the best-known owners in Jump racing and will always be associated with his dual Queen Mother Champion Chase winner, Viking Flagship, who died in retirement at the age of 13 in 2000. Roach, born on August 26, 1947, graduated from the hunting and point-to-point world to be a permit-holder from 1983 before taking a full training licence at the 200-acre Prideaux House overlooking St Austell Bay in Cornwall in 1989. He ceased training in 1991 when deciding his business must come first. He joined the family’s Cornwall-based meat processing company Roach Foods aged 15 and in 1999 the company merged with Dalehead to form Flagship Foods, a supplier of meats to supermarkets and caterers. Danish company Tulip merged with Flagship Foods in 2004, with Roach Foods a subsidiary company, which made Roach a reported £70 million. The best horse he trained was Prideaux Boy, while he has still to own a better horse than the 24-time winner Viking Flagship, hero of the Queen Mother Champion Chase at the Cheltenham Festival in 1994 and 1995, and also successful in the Melling Chase at Aintree in 1995, after a tremendous battle with Martha’s Son and Deep Sensation which will long be remembered by racegoers. Roach is a major spender at the sales, buying foals and yearlings who are raised at Prideaux House before being sent to trainer Paul Nicholls when three quarters fit, with notable graduates including Best Mate’s brother Cornish Rebel, who cost Ir£110,000 as a four-year-old, and Thisthatandtother, who both went on to Grade One glory. Crabbie’s Grand National record: 2003 Shotgun Willy (PU 22nd); 2006 Cornish Rebel (PU 19th); 2007 Thisthatandtother (PU 30th); 2011 The Tother One (Fell 6th)\n\nPaul Nicholls (Manor Farm Stables, Ditcheat, Shepton Mallet, Somerset)\n\nBorn: April 17, 1962. Background: Started out in racing as a jump jockey and partnered 119 winners between 1980 and 1989, with his biggest British successes coming in the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury on Broadheath (1986) and Playschool (1987). He struggled to keep his weight down and gave up race riding. Between 1989 and 1991, he was assistant trainer to David Barons, who trained Broadheath and Playschool and sent out Seagram to win the 1991 Grand National. Has been training at Manor Farm Stables in Ditcheat, Somerset, since taking out a licence on November 1, 1991. Achievements: Seven-time champion Jump trainer (2005/06, 2006/07, 2007/08, 2008/09, 2009/10, 2010/11, 2011/12) and became the first handler to accrue more than £4 million in a season in 2007/08. He gained his 2,000th winner at Down Royal on November 5, 2011, less than 20 years after taking his licence, making him the fastest Jump trainer to reach the landmark figure. Has sent out 34 winners at the Cheltenham Festival, including four victories in three of the meeting’s showpiece contests – the BetVictor Queen Mother Champion Chase (1999 Call Equiname, 2004 Azertyuiop, 2008 & 2009 Master Minded), the Betfred Cheltenham Gold Cup (1999 See More Business, 2007 & 2009 Kauto Star, 2008 Denman) and the Ladbrokes World Hurdle (Big Buck’s 2009, 2010, 2011 & 2012). Also won the Stan James Champion Hurdle with Rock On Ruby and Crabbie’s Grand National with Neptune Collonges in 2012.

His grandfather Jim Mahon was a hugely influential figure between the flags as he not only founded the Point-to-Point Owners’ & Riders’ Association but was also instrumental in introducing the first fixture to be run under Jockey Club Rules on a Sunday in Britain – at Ashorne, Warwickshire – on April 25, 1993. Jim also trained Blue Cheek to win the 1997 Crabbie’s Fox Hunters’ Chase at Aintree. Ryan’s father Gabe holds a permit. Ryan’s two sisters, Ella and Lara plus his younger brother Leo have all ridden in point-to-points. Unsurprisingly, Ryan started off in the point-to-point world before joining the stable of Paul Nicholls in 2007. He registered his first success under Rules when partnering Foolish Myth to victory in a hunters’ chase at Newton Abbot on May 8, 2008, for Ditcheat handler David Staddon. After a promising start to his career, Ryan was banned for six months by the BHA in December, 2008, after he attempted to pass off a substitute urine sample at the British Racing School, Newmarket, in August of the same year. He continued to be supported by Nicholls and enjoyed a breakthrough campaign in the 2010/11 campaign, riding the likes of Silviniaco Conti and Woolcombe Folly to victory. He was champion amateur in 2010/11 before turning professional at the end of that season. His biggest successes have come on Pacha Du Polder in the Grade Three Greatwood Gold Cup at Newbury in 2013 and on Rebel Rebellion in the Betfred Grand Sefton Chase over the Grand National fences, also in 2013.

Win & place prize money: £161,648\n\nAtlantic Equine Syndicate\n\nAtlantic Equine is a transatlantic bloodstock agency, currently specialising in jumpers but branching out into Flat racing. One of its ownership syndicates has already had a Grand National victory, in the American version at Far Hills, Pennsylvania, with Black Jack Blues, trained by Rebecca Curtis before his transfer to the States. On this side of the Atlantic another syndicate came close to Cheltenham Festival success with Meister Eckhart, second in the Coral Cup last year before a third place in another prestige handicap at the Grand National meeting. Atlantic Equine is operated by US-based Nick Carter, formerly a conditional rider with Paul Nicholls, and Steve Price, who used to work for Nicky Henderson and now runs his own engineering company. The Hunt Ball syndicate comprises Charles Noell, Frank Bonsal, brothers Ben and Jay Griswold, Perry Bolton, George Tydings, Mary Parr and Guy Dove, all the members being wealthy and enthusiastic American horsemen and women. Baltimore-based Noell, who sold the San Diego Padres baseball team for a billion dollars two years ago, has Flat racing interests as Merriebelle Stables with another partner and was a major shareholder in the world-class Flat stallion Kingmambo. He also has property in Ireland and last year bought the stock of Kilfrush Stud, including Immortal Verse, later sold on for a record European broodmare price of 4.7 million guineas.

He founded Rooney & Co. Estate Agents in 1981 which is now part of the Arun Estates network (worth an estimated £80 million). Rooney decided to start his own estate agency based on his own frustrations when trying to buy a family home in Horsham. He also has a house building business. Rooney, along with his wife Clare, has owned horses for five years and their horses are trained by Donald McCain in Cheshire. Kruzhlinin will be their first runner in the Crabbie’s Grand National, which will be exciting for the family as they have relatives who live in the Liverpool area. Their interest in horseracing was first sparked after they agreed to take a third share in a horse with their friends. Rooney and his wife have a number of charitable foundations (the Rooney Foundation being the biggest) which focus mainly on children’s disabilities and medical research.
