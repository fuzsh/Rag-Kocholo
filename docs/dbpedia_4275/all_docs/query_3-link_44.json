        "text": "Leanne\n\nI’ve been training with Golan for 5 years and I can honestly say he’s the most motivating, real, no bull-shit and knowledgeable coach out there. His longterm loyal client base speaks volumes. Prior to Golan, I trained with other PTs and I quit due to boredom - this would never happen with Golan. I’ve trained consistently 3x per week with him (sometimes more) and often I ask for more sessions because they’re fun, make me feel great & I always feel worked. Not only has Golan improved my physical form significantly with fat loss and muscle gain, but his training and his friendly, loveable persona has helped hugely with my mental well-being too. I feel much better equipped to tackle any difficult day after a workout with him. Golan is also massively knowledgeable with nutrition - he has taught me invaluable amounts and helps me with my diet. He’s the absolute number 1!\n\nLaura\n\nI’ve been training with Golan for nearly 4 years. Before that I did exercise but had never lifted proper weights and like many women always thought that was a “mans“ thing and I’d end up bulkier and bigger. How wrong I was! Not only has my body shape totally changed - I’m now leaner, more toned and fitter than I’ve ever been at the age of 37. But I’m also stronger both physically and mentally from my three sessions a week I do with him. For me it’s so much more than just how I look but it’s my time to focus on me and forget the rest of the world - everyone needs some self love. The sessions are never dull he mixes them up so much u never know what you will get! Aside from the gym he will give you a nutrition programme to follow to help obtain ur goals. Mine have varied over the years from weight loss to muscle gain but it’s never really a diet as he adopts a flexible dieting programme.\n\nMax\n\nI’ve been training with Golan for around 7 years and he’s changed my life for the better. Not only are his training methods unique and rewarding but he’s always on the other end of the phone when you need him in terms of nutrition and motivation. Golan is my personal trainer but also now a very good friend which speaks volumes about his work and care for his clients.\n\nLee\n\nI didn’t like to lift weights until I met Golan. Golan gives you 100% confidence in your own ability. Through Golan’s expertise and experience my ability to lift has increased significantly. I no longer fear weights instead understand the importance they have in body conditioning and cardiovascular work. Outside of the gym, Golan will support you tirelessly, he’s always in communication offering support and help with nutrition and motivation. Golan is a specialist in his field, I would highly recommend him to anyone!\n\nMatt\n\nI was in the worse shape of my life, had shoulder, back problems, and my diet was really bad. I made a commitment to myself that I didn’t want to look back and have regrets so... introduce “Golan the barbarian”I’m an all or nothing person, that’s why I knew from the outset I’ll do whatever it takes to ensure by end of the year, I’ll look back and think it was all worth it. We changed up my diet so it was controlled, and put in place a training plan for results. Some of the sessions I was put through were simply inhumane but it took me to a place I needed to be in order to keep progressing. I couldn’t of done it without the big man and can’t thank him enough for getting me back on track!\n\nShaun\n\nI started training with Golan when I was 31 (5 years ago) at a point in my life where I had just got married and was starting a family. I was incredibly conscious that it’s common for people at this stage of their lives to let themselves go a bit but I was really focused on going in the other direction. Golan has helped me transform my body, increase my fitness and manage my nutrition amongst all of my busy life commitments such as family and work. Golan is not just an outstanding and incredibly knowledgeable trainer but is a wonderful human being and top professional. Golan is a specialist in his field, I would highly recommend him to anyone!\n\nEliott\n\nI’ve had the pleasure of training with Golan for roughly 2.5 years. He’s knowledge of both training and nutrition is simply unrivalled and the results speak for themselves. He pushes you out of your comfort zone to achieve goals that you don’t think are possible and joins you every step of the way on the journey.\n\nAdam\n\nGolan manages to combine a bespoke one on one training routine with the sense that you are part of a community, both within the gym and as one of his clients. His advice extends beyond just the hour you are with him, guiding you on your lifetime fitness journey and ensuring that he’s there to pick you up in all circumstances. It’s a testament to his ability that people, including me and my wife, travel from far and wide to train with him.\n\nI am a Personal Trainer based in Hertfordshire and have been working in the fitness industry for the past 12 years. In that time I’ve helped my clients not only get into better shape but have helped them see how investing in their health carries many benefits into other aspects of life including improving happiness, family & relationships, performance at work and a general feeling of well being.\n\nI started online coaching when I could no longer keep up with demand for 1-2-1 Personal Training. My diary was either full or the location became an issue. I wanted to continue to provide those I couldn’t train in person, with my knowledge and expertise, to transform their lives and reach their health, fitness & physique goals."
