        "text": "Craig Arnold gets an unusual treble by the way of riding the last two winners at the Abu Dhabi meeting last Sunday, and the first winner at Nad Al Sheba tonight.\n\nThe Yancy Carter Jr trained Sabear who won twice last season got off the mark with a strong finish from Zai Al Qamar, both were at the bottom of the handicap and drawn low. Druba Selvaratnam`s Zai Al Qamar ran very well as did the third placed Nedjam Lotois who was just a short head back in third.\n\nCarter Jr has a strong team of Pure Bred Arabians and he is looking forward to a successful season as his horse Sarrabe showeed at Abu Dhabi last Sunday when a good second in the National Day Cup Prep, Sarrabe will try to reverse places with the winner that night Khoutoubia and he has a decent chance.\n\nThe fancied runners in this race failed, Eldjani who won last week ran the best of them in fourth.\n\nThe rest of the evening promised much and the results can be seen off the \"Live Results\" on the front page\n\nBy Mark Monkhouse (www.comeracinguae.com)\n\nJAPAN CUP INFORMATION\n\nThis year, the Japan Cup will be held at Nakayama Racecourse because of the reconstruction of Tokyo Racecourse.\n\nThe race will be telecast live from Nakayama Racecourse to racegoers at Sha Tin and Happy Valley on Sunday, 24 November. The event has been scheduled as the fourth race on the day`s programme at Sha Tin and will start at 2:25 p.m.\n\nThe 2,200-metre Japan Cup is a Group One invitation race open to horses aged three years and over worth approximately US$3.96 million in total prize money.\n\nTo help improve the quality of Japanese racing and foster international goodwill within the racing community, the Japan Racing Association introduced the Japan Cup in 1981. The Cup has since grown in international stature and has produced some of the most memorable races ever held in Japan.\n\nJapanese contenders have won the last four Japan Cups with El Condor Pasa (1998), Special Week (1999), T.M. Opera O (2000) and Jungle Pocket (2001). Last year, with Olivier Peslier on board, Jungle Pocket won by a neck from the defending champion T.M. Opera O.\n\nThere are 16 runners in this year`s line up with seven overseas challengers (one from North America, one from Hong Kong and five from Europe) taking on the home contingent.\n\nJAPAN CUP - LATEST NEWS\n\nLooking back at the past winners of the Cup, Japan and USA have produced nine and four winners respectively followed by three from England, and one each from Ireland, France, New Zealand, Australia and Germany.\n\nThough the advantage of running on home ground are obvious, the number of times when the favorite won the race was just twice out of 21 starts (0.111%).\n\nIt is one of the most difficult races to predict the winners.\n\nYear Name of horse representative Favorite `81 Mairzy Doates USA 5 `82 Half Iced USA 6 `83 Stanerra IRE 3 `84 Katsuragi Ace JPN 10 `85 Symboli Rudolf JPN 1 `86 Jupiter Island GB 8 `87 Le Glorieux FRA 3 `88 Pay the Butler USA 9 `89 Horlicks NZ 9 `90 Better Loosen Up AUS 2 `91 Golden Pheasant USA 7 `92 Tokai Teio JPN 5 `93 Legacy World JPN 6 `94 Marvelous Crown JPN 6 `95 Lando GER 5 `96 Singspiel GB 4 `97 Pilsudski GB 3 `98 El Condor Pasa JPN 3 `99 Special Week JPN 2 `00 T.M.

Pilsudski is another past winner also saddled by Sir Stoute to make his last performance in the Japan Cup before retirement.\n\nHorse Rep., FP / 1st time FP / 2nd time Frost King CAN 2nd / `81 10th / `82 Half Iced USA 1st / `82 4th / `83 Stanerra IRE 4th / `82 1st / `83 Esprit du Nord FRA 3rd / `83 11th / `84 Waverley Star NZL 5th / `86 9th / `87 Triptych FRA 11th / `86 4th `87 Moon Madness ENG 5th / `87 6th / `88 Pay the Butler ISA 1st / `88 3rd / `89 Ibn Bey ENG 6th / `89 8th / `90 Rough Habit NZL 5th / `91 7th / `94 Naturalism AUS 2nd / `92 9th / `93 Hernando FRA 4th / `94 3rd / `95 Sandpit USA 5th / `94 8th / `95 Awad USA 5th / `95 5th / `96 Caitano GER 4th / `97 11th / `98 Fruits of Love ENG 9th / `99 12th / `00 Indigenous HNK 2nd / `99 7th / `01 Timboroa USA 11th / `00 15th / `01\n\nJungle Pocket aiming to Make History with two-consecutive Japan Cup titles\n\nLast year`s Japan Cup winner will run again this year to defend his title. There has been three winners who ran a second time to defend their titles but none have succeeded and the best score was by T.M. Opera O who won his first and finished second in his second Japan Cup start. Jungle Pocket, who defeated T.M. Opera O from capturing his second JC victory, will make the challenge himself this year. His partner will however, change from Olivier Peslier to Yutaka Take who has already experienced winning the title with Special Week in `99.\n\nHorse Rep., FP (2nd time) Favorite Half Iced USA 4th 7th Pay the Butler USA 3rd 6th T.M. Opera O JPN 2nd 1st\n\nSon of runner-up Magic Night Hoping to make new record\n\nMagnaten is out of Magic Night who ran for France and was the runner-up to Golden Pheasant in the `91. It is the first time for a two-generation participation of a mother-son combination and Magnaten is currently on the upward trend towards this race with three consecutive wins (among which two are grade race victories) behind him.\n\nSuccessful second-generation winners include last year`s Jungle Pocket (by Tony Bin, 5th in 88`) and Tokai Teio (by Symboli Rudolf, 1st `85) who won in `92.\n\nAccording to statistics, three geldings have won the past Japan Cup titles while another three have finished second.\n\nPartnered with veteran jockey, Yukio Okabe who is the only jockey to have experienced two Japan Cup titles as well as a Japan Cup Dirt victory and have already scored four grade-race titles between September through November 10th, the six-year-old gelding has high hopes to mark another record in Japan Cup history.\n\nFull brother to Sunline born in Australia\n\nA full brother to retired Australian icon Sunline was born earlier this week at Inverness Stud in Bowral, New South Wales, Australia. \"Everything pretty good with him,\" Inverness Stud manager Ross Bone told the Sydney Morning-Herald. \"He`s nice and straight.\"\n\nThe colt by Desert Sun (GB) has already been valued at $558,301 ($1-million Australian dollars) when he will be sold as a yearling in 2004. Bone said the colt would be sold at either the Magic Millions or William Inglis & Son Ltd. Easter yearling sales in 2004.\n\nLast year, a yearling colt that Songline produced by champion Octagonal sold at the Easter sale for $307,065 to trainer John Hawkes.\n\nSongline will be bred back to Coolmore Stud`s Galileo (Ire) (Sadler`s Wells)."
