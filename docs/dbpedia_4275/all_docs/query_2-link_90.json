He loves it round here. He's definitely a real Arc horse.\n\n\"He will need a low draw but I think a good gallop will suit him. I am just looking forward to the race.\"\n\nGolan had been off the course since finishing third to Galileo in the Budweiser Irish Derby in June. He had earlier been second to the same horse in the Vodafone Derby at Epsom.\n\nBut while it was an impressive performance, I didn't see anything that would put me off backing St Leger winner Milan in Paris.\n\nHightori consolidated his position as a leading fancy for the Arc when winning the Prix Foy Gray d'Albion Barriere under Gerald Mosse.\n\nBut it was no walkover for the horse who was forced to dig deep for his victory over Idaho Quest.\n\nThe win will, however, have put Hightori right for the big race in just under three weeks.\n\nUnbeaten Aquarelliste scored a fourth straight win of the season when landing the Prix Vermeille Hermitage Barriere.\n\nThe filly scored impressively under Dominique Boeuf for trainer Elie Lellouche.\n\nThe three-year-old, racing in the Daniel Wildenstein colours, beat Diamilina, who was bidding for a five-timer for trainer Andre Fabre.\n\nMot Juste, under Richard Hughes, tried to make much of the running for trainer Ed Dunlop but could not withstand the challenge of the first three and finished fourth.\n\nThe filly, winner of the Listed Pretty Polly Stakes at Newmarket in May, had been disappointing when eighth in the Yorkshire Oaks at the Ebor meeting last month.\n\nLadbrokes go: 5-2 Sakhee (with a run), 7-2 Aquarelliste, 4 Hightori, 6 Milan, 10 Maille Pistol, Golan 12 bar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mediterranean is back home at Ballydoyle and awaiting X-rays on a tendon injury suffered in Saturday's St Leger.\n\n\"His off fore leg was cast after the race and he came home with the rest of the horses last night,\" said trainer Aidan O'Brien.\n\n\"They'll probably take off the cast for the X-rays and discover whether the tendon is ruptured or not,\" he added of the Tote Ebor winner."
