        "text": "A rocket strike on Saturday at a soccer field killed 12 children and teens, and wounded 20 others, the Israeli military said.\n\nIsrael blamed the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah for the strike in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, an accusation Hezbollah denied.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned that Hezbollah \"will pay a heavy price for this attack, one that it has not paid so far.\"\n\nThe Israeli military's chief spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari, called it the deadliest attack on Israeli civilians since the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 that sparked the war in Gaza. He said 20 others were wounded.\n\n\"There is no doubt that Hezbollah has crossed all the red lines here, and the response will reflect that,\" Israeli Foreign Affairs Minister Israel Katz told Israeli Channel 12. \"We are nearing the moment in which we face an all-out war.\"\n\nMohammed Afif, Hezbollah's chief spokesperson, told The Associated Press that the group \"categorically denies carrying out an attack on [the town of] Majdal Shams.\"\n\nOn Sunday, the Israel Defence Forces released names and photos for 11 of the 12 victims. Ten of the victims ranged in age from 10 to 16. The age of the 11th victim was unknown. Details of the 12th victim were not released.\n\nThe strike at the soccer field, just before sunset, followed earlier cross-border violence on Saturday, in which Hezbollah said three of its fighters were killed, without specifying where. Israel's military said its air force targeted a Hezbollah arms depot on the border village of Kfar Kila, adding that militants were inside at the time.\n\nHezbollah said its fighters carried out nine different attacks using rockets and explosive drones against Israeli military posts, the last of which targeted the army command of the Haramoun Brigade in Maaleh Golani with Katyusha rockets. It said they were in response to Israeli airstrikes on villages in southern Lebanon.\n\nThe office of Netanyahu, who was on a visit to the United States, said he would cut short his trip by several hours, without specifying when he would return. It said he will convene the security cabinet after arriving.\n\nFar-right members of Netanyahu's government called for a harsh response against Hezbollah. But an all-out war with a militant group that has far superior firepower than Hamas would be trying for Israel's military after nearly 10 months of fighting in Gaza.\n\nFootage aired on Israeli Channel 12 showed a large blast in one of the valleys in the Druze town of Majdal Shams, in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed in 1981. Some Druze have Israeli citizenship. Many still have sympathies for Syria and rejected Israeli annexation, but their ties with Israeli society have grown over the years.\n\nVideo showed paramedics rushing stretchers off the soccer field toward waiting ambulances.\n\nIsrael's military said its analysis showed that the rocket was launched from an area north of the town of Chebaa, in southern Lebanon.\n\nThe U.S. National Security Council in a statement condemned the attack without directly blaming Hezbollah, adding that the U.S. \"will continue to support efforts to end these terrible attacks along the Blue Line,\" referring to the line delineating Israel's frontier with Lebanon.\n\n\"Our support for Israel's security is iron-clad and unwavering against all Iranian-backed terrorist groups, including Lebanese Hezbollah.\"\n\nCanada's minister of foreign affairs, MÃ©lanie Joly, also did not specifically mention Hezbollah, but said, \"We reiterate our demand that Iran and its affiliated terrorist groups refrain from destabilizing actions in the Middle East.\"\n\nLebanon's government, in a statement that didn't mention Majdal Sham, urged an \"immediate cessation of hostilities on all fronts\" and condemned all attacks on civilians.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah have been trading fire since Oct. 8, a day after Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel. In recent weeks, the exchange of fire along the Lebanon-Israel border has intensified, with Israeli airstrikes and rocket and drone attacks by Hezbollah striking deeper and farther away from the border.\n\nMajdal Shams had not been among border communities ordered to evacuate as tensions rose, Israel's military said, without saying why. The town doesn't sit directly on the border with Lebanon.\n\nOfficials from other countries, including the United States and France, have visited Lebanon to try to ease the tensions but failed to make progress. Hezbollah has refused to cease firing as long as Israel's offensive in Gaza continues. Israel and Hezbollah fought an inconclusive war in 2006.\n\nSaturday's violence comes as Israel and Hamas are weighing a ceasefire proposal that would wind down the nearly 10-month war in Gaza and free the roughly 110 hostages who remain captive there. Hamas's attack on Oct. 7 killed some 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's offensive has killed more than 39,000 people, according to local health authorities.\n\nSince early October, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed more than 450 people, mostly Hezbollah members, but also about 90 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 21 soldiers and 13 civilians have been killed."
