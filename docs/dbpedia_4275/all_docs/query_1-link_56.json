Ladbrokes, Paddy Power and Sportingbet are all evens from 11/10.\n\nHowever it's a different stort as far as Kasbah Bliss is concerned, with no fewer than six of our featured bookies easing the price on the French raider, Ladbrokes among them at 5/4 from 6/5.\n\nPost by Kimmy on\n\nTHE ABSENCE of three of the declared runners for Saturday's John Smith's Midlands Grand National would have been welcomed by the Scoop6 bonus hunters looking to pick up the biggest prize ever in British horse racing history, but the decision of one of the 17 to go it alone means they will not be able to guarantee a payout.\n\nHarry Findlay\n\nHarry Findlay, who holds four of the tickets, put out an appeal immediately after last week's final race asking for the other ticket holders to get in contact with him, and with the punters responsible for 14 of the tickets pooling their resources, the massive bonus fund of £3,184,369, which has eluded punters for more than six months looks set to finally be won.\n\nFindlay was still waiting for two of the ticketholders to get in contact on Friday although one of the 17 had already ruled out colluding with Findlay, Scoop 6 Squirrel Richard Brocklebank and the others.\n\nAmong those punters to have decided to join forces with Denman's part-owner in an attempt to boost their £58,608 winnings from seven days ago are Richard Rood, an auctioneer and valuer from Portsmouth who staked just £2 on his 55th birthday last week and wheelchair bound John Johnson, 75, from Dunfermline, who liked Rood staked just £2 in a Ladbrokes betting shop.\n\nPost by Kimmy on\n\nALL 17 jockeys in the last race at Fontwell on Sunday were handed a one-day ban for coming out on to the course before they were called by starter Warren Marshall.\n\nThe handicap hurdle for conditional jockeys went the way of Pepito Collonges under Harry Skelton, but Skelton and all of his weighing room colleagues who took part in the race were given a one-day ban - March 29 - after they were adjudged to have been in breach of the rules at the start of the race.\n\nAlthough unusual, Sunday's incident was not a precedent according to stipendiary steward Richard Westropp.\n\n\"It is not the first time this has happened,\" he said. \"The jockeys had not been called out on to the track by the starter but emerged from the collection area on to the course regardless.\n\n\"The starter then told them to take another turn and then after letting them go reported them for their actions.\"\n\nPost by Kimmy on\n\nEXETER\n\nGOING: GOOD (Good to firm in places; GoingStick 7.2) (Hurdle course out as far as possible adding about 60yds)\n\nWEATHER (A cold start with patchy ground frost; a dry and fine day with plenty of bright sunshine; gentle south-easterly winds)\n\nKEMPTON\n\nGOING: GOOD (Watered; GoingStick: Chase 7.7, Hurdle 7.2) (All rails moved out 2m from last fixture)\n\nWEATHER (A cold start; dry with sunny periods and variable amounts of cloud; gentle easterly winds)\n\nDOWN ROYAL\n\nGOING: YIELDING TO SOFT\n\nWEATHER (Cloudy for a time but generally dry; sunny spells developing later; moderate south-easterly winds)\n\nWEXFORD\n\nGOING: YIELDING (Soft in places)\n\nWEATHER (A cold start; sunny with just a little patchy cloud during the morning; gentle south-easterly winds)\n\nSOUTHWELL\n\nGOING: STANDARD\n\nWEATHER (Cold at first; cloudy with limited brightness; it will remain dry though; gentle easterly winds)\n\nSTALLS Inside"
