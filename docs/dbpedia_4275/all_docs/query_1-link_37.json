        "text": "ROYAL ASCOT PRESS CONFERENCE – THURSDAY – JUNE 12, 2014\n\nChris Stickels, Clerk of the Course at Ascot Racecourse, reported today that the weather is set fair until at least Thursday of next week, mid-way through Royal Ascot 2014 which starts on Tuesday, June 17.\n\nHe said at the Royal Ascot press conference, held at the Jockey Club Rooms in Newmarket: “For the first time in a number of years, the weather does looked like it is going to be settled from now until at least Thursday of next week – dry and warm.\n\n“The going is currently Good, Good to Firm in places and we started watering yesterday when we put 10 millimetres on the straight. We also put four millimetres on the round course last night.\n\n“This is the first time we have watered the course since August of last year. The aim would be to start Royal Ascot on Tuesday on similar ground that we have got now – Good, Good to Firm in places – and it is highly likely we will put some more water on, maybe tomorrow but certainly over the weekend at some point.\n\n“Every year I have been here, we have had to water for Royal Ascot before now. We have had a good spring for the course, which drains very well. The rain then has helped the grass growth and it has been very mild too – the course is in excellent shape.”\n\nTrainers Sir Michael Stoute and Mike de Kock spoke about their Royal Ascot hopes, while Harry Herbert and Hannah Wall talked about the prospects of horses representing Al Shaqab Racing and Qatar Racing respectively (see below).\n\nEight American challengers for Royal Ascot are due to land at 5pm and arrive in Newmarket by 8pm. The charter flight set off from Indianapolis. The horses will be stabled at Clive Brittain’s yard.\n\nSir Michael Stoute has trained Her Majesty The Queen’s Estimate to win at two successive Royal Ascots, taking the Queen’s Vase in 2012 and the Gold Cup last year.\n\nThe Newmarket trainer said today: “The Gold Cup victory was so welcomed by the entire racing fraternity and by all those who follow racing.\n\n“Estimate is not straightforward – it is a big team effort with her, from the girl who does her to the girl that rides her, etc. The win last year was so good for racing so it ranks very highly with me.”\n\nThe five-year-old mare, successful on four of her eight starts, goes back to Royal Ascot next week for the Gold Cup on Thursday (June 19) without a prep run.\n\nThe trainer explained: “The preparation has not been easy because we have had problems. There has been a muscle problem with her right hind (leg), which is why she has not had a preparatory run.\n\n“So we are under pressure but there has been some good progress in the last month. I think it is a very tough Gold Cup this year so it is a tough assignment but I think we will run very well.\n\n“The Queen has had so many losers during her life that she does not get carried away.”\n\nBreeders’ Cup Filly & Mare winner Dank could run against the colts in the Group One Prince of Wales’s Stakes on Wednesday (June 18) or wait until Ireland’s Pretty Polly Stakes.\n\nSir Michael commented: “Dank is in very good shape. We have confirmed her in the Prince of Wales’s Stakes this morning but she also has an alternative in the Pretty Polly at the Curragh the following weekend. We haven’t decided yet.\n\n“I know that James Wigan (owner) prefers the Pretty Polly, but it would be nice to have a crack at the Prince of Wales’s Stakes. We will look at the opposition. I think she would get her ground at Royal Ascot.”\n\nAbseil has been backed down to favourite for the £175,000 Royal Hunt Cup on Wednesday (June 18) but Sir Michael warned that the lightly-raced colt might not get in the field.\n\nHe said: “Abseil is not certain to make the cut. He has a 5lb penalty for winning last weekend but he will be at the bottom of the 97s. I just hope he gets in because I think he has a great chance and the track would suit him ideally.\n\n“Telescope goes for the Hardwicke (Group Two, Saturday, June 21). He has been coming up against Noble Mission who has been a big improver this year and obviously handles heavy ground well.\n\n“Telescope will be better on a faster surface and he will have a good chance in the Hardwicke.\n\n“There is Integral as well in the Duke of Cambridge (Group Two, Wednesday, June 18) and Russian Realm in the seven-furlong handicap (Buckingham Palace) on the Friday (June 20). We also have Radiator in the Sandringham (Handicap, Wednesday, June 18).\n\n“Snow Sky will hopefully go for the King Edward VII Stakes (Group Two) on the Friday (June 20). He is back cantering – he just sprained his near-fore joint before the Derby.”\n\nSir Michael Stoute (Newmarket, Suffolk)\n\nBackground: born on October 22, 1945, in Barbados, where his father was chief of police, Michael Stoute came to Britain in 1965 to nurture his love of racing. Joined trainer Pat Rohan at Malton before moving to Newmarket three years later to work for Doug Smith and then Tom Jones. Took out a public licence to train in 1972, recording his first success that year when Sandal won at Newmarket on April 28. Trains at Freemason Lodge in Newmarket.\n\nAccolades: British champion trainer 10 times – 1981, 1986, 1989, 1994, 1997, 2000, 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2009; knighted in 1998 for his services to sport and tourism in Barbados.\n\nBritish Classic Wins (15):\n\nInvestec Oaks (1978 Fair Salinia, 1987 Unite).\n\nInvestec Derby (1981 Shergar, 1986 Shahrastani, 2003 Kris Kin, 2004 North Light, 2010 Workforce), QIPCO 1000 Guineas (1989 Musical Bliss, 2003 Russian Rhythm).\n\nQIPCO 2000 Guineas (1985 Shadeed, 1988 Doyoun, 1997 Entrepreneur, 2000 King’s Best, 2001 Golan),\n\nLadbrokes St Leger (2008 Conduit).\n\nRoyal Ascot – 68 Royal Ascot wins and is the most successful current trainer at the five-day meeting.

She is working again this morning and Olly (Stevens) is a 100 per cent happy with her.”\n\nAnother filly in the Coronation Stakes is Kiyoshi. Wall said: “Kiyoshi had a very untimely infection of the hock just on the eve of travelling up to Newmarket for the 1000 Guineas and she missed the Irish Guineas as well.\n\n“She is fine and back working. She worked on Tuesday and will do so again on Saturday. She is still in the Coronation Stakes and will probably have an entry in the Jersey Stakes (Group Three, Wednesday, June 18) as well. Her participation in the races has not been decided yet. It depends on how she works on Saturday.\n\n“She is happy and sound and did a nice piece of work on Tuesday. She is a filly we think a huge amount of and we feel she has improved. We won’t be rushing her.\n\n“Both Hot Streak and Pearl Secret will run in the King’s Stand Stakes (Group One, Tuesday, June 17), with Jamie (Spencer) on Hot Streak and Richard Hughes on Pearl Secret. Both are absolutely fine after Haydock. Hot Streak is amazing for a three-year-old in that division (sprinting). He is infinitely tough and seems to have incredible maturity, both mentally and physically. He won at Haydock from Pearl Secret that day on ground neither would want.\n\n“Kevin (Ryan) says Hot Streak is one of the best horses he has ever trained. Kevin is happy with Hot Streak and so is David Barron with Pearl Secret. Things did not go right for Pearl Secret at Newmarket and he raced closer to the pace at Haydock. There is not much between the two sprinters and both are in good form ahead of Royal Ascot.”\n\nTurning to two-year-olds Likely and Mind of Madness, Wall remarked: “Likely will have a couple of Royal Ascot entries and we were very pleased with how she won her maiden. She was a breeze-up filly and she has an incredible temperament for racing. She did not need the experience on her debut as she knew what to do perfectly well. She has plenty of speed.\n\n“Mind Of Madness won a Newmarket and was beaten the other day. He is by Azamour and out of a very speedy Oasis Dream mare, who is a great speed influence on Mind Of Madness. He has natural cruising speed and is likely to run in the Windsor Castle (Listed, June 17).”\n\nQatar Racing/Pearl Bloodstock\n\nBackground: Headed by Sheikh Fahad Al Thani, who was born in June, 1989, and his brothers. They are sons of Sheikh Abdullah bin Khalifa Al Thani, a former prime minister of Qatar and brother of the country’s former Emir.\n\nSheikh Fahad did his A-Levels in London and a three-year BBA in business administration at the London Campus of the Geneva-based Europa University. He approached bloodstock agent David Redvers in February, 2010, about dipping his toe into racehorse ownership.\n\nRacing as Pearl Bloodstock, he enjoyed great early success capped by a victory for Dunaden in the 2011 Emirates Melbourne Cup at Flemington, Australia. Other flagbearers include that year’s Windsor Castle Stakes winner Frederick Engels and Cheveley Park Stakes heroine Lightening Pearl.\n\nThey won last season’s Irish 1,000 Guineas with Just The Judge, owned the 2013 Investec Oaks runner-up Secret Gesture and Pearl Bloodstock’s Side Glance won the 2013 Mackinnon Stakes.\n\nThrough their family company QIPCO, the brothers back Britain’s Champion Series and plenty of top-level races including both the British and Irish Champion Stakes and for the first time this year the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot.\n\nTheir stallions standing at Redvers’ Tweenhills Stud in Gloucestershire are Makfi, Harbour Watch and Havana Gold. They recently bought a farm in Co Limerick in Ireland. They have an international brand of broodmares and over 200 horses in training in Britain, France, Ireland, Germany, America, Australia and Japan. Last year they bought Robins Farm Stables in Surrey, where trainer Olly Stevens is based.\n\nSheikh Fahad completed the 2014 London Marathon as part of a team raising money for Racing Welfare.\n\nSide Glance – Queen Anne Stakes\n\nBreeding: 7 br g Passing Glance – Averami (Averti (IRE))\n\nBreeder: Kingsclere Stud\n\nBorn: March 15, 2007\n\nOwner: Pearl Bloodstock Ltd\n\nTrainer: Andrew Balding\n\nForm: 12/4651312/3113147/53133226/4473615-745\n\n*Globetrotter who secured a deserved Group One victory in the 10-furlong Longines Mackinnon Stakes at Flemington, Australia, in November.\n\n*Finished fourth in the last two renewals of the Group One Dubai World Cup and took third in the Grade One Arlington Million in August, 2013.\n\n*Beaten 11 ½ lengths into third by the mighty Frankel in the 2012 Queen Anne Stakes.\n\n*Dual Group Three winner in Britain.\n\nRace record: Starts: 34; Wins: 8; 2nd: 4; 3rd: 7; Win & Place Prize Money: £1,543,358\n\nHot Streak (IRE) – King’s Stand Stakes or Diamond Jubilee Stakes\n\nBreeding: 3 ch c Iffraaj – Ashirah (USA) (Housebuster (USA))\n\nBreeder: Barry Noonan\n\nBorn: February 22, 2011\n\nOwner: Qatar Racing Limited\n\nTrainer: Kevin Ryan\n\nForm: 115312-31\n\n*Made all the running under Oisin Murphy to land the five-furlong Group Two Temple Stakes at Haydock Park on May 24.\n\n*Third to Sole Power on his seasonal return in the Group Three Pearl Bloodstock Palace House Stakes at Newmarket on May 3.\n\n*Won three of his six starts last season, including Ascot’s Group Three BMW Cornwallis Stakes by five lengths.

Treve, the five length winner of the 2013 Qatar Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe, lost her unbeaten record when going down by a short-neck to Cirrus Des Aigles on her seasonal debut in the Prix Ganay at Longchamp on April 27.\n\n“She came out of her last race very well,” said Al Shaqab’s racing advisor Harry Herbert. “Criquette (Head-Maarek) called me the next day and said Treve hadn’t left an oat which was encouraging after a tough race on sticky ground against a great racehorse.\n\n“It has all been really encouraging news since, the way she’s been training. I spoke to Criquette yesterday and touch wood she’s more than happy with the filly. Ascot has been the plan from the beginning and we’re nearly there. You’d have to think she’d go on good to firm ground although extremes are always an issue. The trainer is confident Treve will go well on faster ground.\n\n“Of course, it’s disappointing that she got beat (in the Prix Ganay). I think Treve had got Cirrus Des Aigles beat that day then Christophe Soumillon got to the rail on that sticky ground and that was worth a length or so. She still ran a great race and the winner had had a couple of runs beforehand and has done brilliantly since.”\n\nAssessing Treve’s attributes, Herbert added: “She’s a fantastic mover, Frankie describes her as having the most extraordinary action of any horse he’s ridden. He says it’s the way she keeps her body very still and the movement below gives him an unbelievable feel.\n\n“I first saw her in December and the Motivators can be a little light-framed but when I saw her she was an absolute monster, she was so not what I was expecting. The most notable thing about her is her depth of girth and shoulder – it is a remarkable physique. She’s very intelligent but can be tough to be around – she lets you know who is boss in the box. But that’s part of her brilliance.”\n\nAfter next week, Treve could head to the £1-million King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes sponsored by QIPCO at Ascot towards the end of July.\n\n“We’ll see how we go,” added Herbert. “Criquette put it wonderfully, she said if Treve likes Ascot then we’ll go back. The King George is the natural race for her and we’ve seen some great fillies and mares take this route.\n\n“She’s taking her training well but it is one step at a time. But personally I’d love to see her come to the King George. It would be a perfect race for her in many ways. Criquette believes Treve can do that, the Vermeille and the Arc. It is one step at a time.”\n\nOther Al Shaqab hopes include Toronado in Tuesday’s Queen Anne Stakes and The Wow Signal in the same day’s Coventry Stakes.\n\n“Toronado is absolutely fine and been given plenty of time,” said Herbert. “He looks amazing. Both he and Treve are physically monsters, they are beautiful horses with great physiques.\n\n“I saw Toronado the day before yesterday and physically he looks absolutely spot on. He’s hard and well, moving beautifully and his work has been extremely good. Team Hannon reckon they have him spot on for the Queen Anne and this has been his target for many months.\n\n“The Wow Signal goes to the Coventry. We bought him privately through the bloodstock agent Richard Knight. You never quite know what you’re buying when a horse wins that well on debut. But the form since purchase has been sensational, which is great to see.\n\n“John (Quinn) is mad about the horse and thinks he’s very good. I just wouldn’t want the ground to get overly quick, that’s the only slight question mark.”\n\nSaturday’s Investec Woodcote Stakes winner Baitha Alga could be out in Thursday’s Norfolk Stakes.\n\n“He didn’t lose any weight or condition in the Woodcote and is a very smart tough two-year-old,” added Herbert. “He goes for the Norfolk (Thursday, June 19), which also gives a bit more time. Duncan Moir, Al Shaqab’s vet looked at him, and said to run him.”\n\nHerbert is also managing director of Highclere Thoroughbred Racing, who will be represented next week.\n\n“Telescope (in the Hardwicke Stakes on Saturday, June 21) is our big hope,” said Herbert. “He’s in great form – he’s back over a mile and a half on better ground and we’d be hopeful of a shout and maybe a dance.\n\n“Wrangler would go for the King George V Handicap (Thursday, June 19) but the ground could be an issue – we don’t want to go if it’s too fast. He’s a very exciting horse and we want to look after him.\n\n“We’ve also bought into Bazzana who won impressively at Windsor and the form of his previous Newmarket run was good. She’s a really tough filly.”\n\nAl Shaqab Racing\n\nAl Shaqab Racing represents the racing interests of Sheikh Joaan Bin Hamad Al Thani, a brother of the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. Al Shaqab takes its name from an historic battle between the Qataris and the Ottoman Empire in 1893.\n\nThe racing operation was officially launched in November, 2013 although Sheikh Joaan raced horses, both thoroughbred and Arabian, in his own name previously, both in Qatar and in Europe. His first thoroughbred winner was Fatih Al Keir at Dax on August 22, 2012.\n\nSheikh Joaan owns Haras de Bouquetot in Normandy, France, where the stallions Planteur and Style Vendome currently stand. Al Shaqab paid a record 5 million guineas at Tattersalls in 2013 for a sister to the 2012 Oaks winner Was, named Al Naamah and in training with Andre Fabre.\n\nThe Hon Harry Herbert is Al Shaqab’s racing advisor in Europe with Bradley Weisbord representing Al Shaqab’s affairs in the USA. Frankie Dettori is the organisation’s retained rider.\n\nTreve, winner of the French Oaks, Prix Vermeille and Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe in 2013 is Sheikh Joaan’s best horse to date. Olympic Glory, winner of the 2013 Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot and 2014 Lockinge Stakes at Newbury and Toronado, winner of the 2013 QIPCO Sussex Stakes, also run under the Al Shaqab banner.\n\nAt the start of 2014, Al Shaqab purchased a share in the 2013 Investec Derby winner Ruler Of The World.\n\nToronado (IRE) – Queen Anne Stakes\n\nBreeding: 4 b c High Chaparral (IRE) – Wana Doo (USA) (Grand Slam (USA))\n\nBreeder: Paul Nataf\n\nBorn: February 20, 2010\n\nTrainer: Richard Hannon\n\nForm: 111/14216-\n\n*Top-class miler last season, finishing fourth in QIPCO 2000 Guineas, second in the St James’s Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot before a decisive half-length success over Dawn Approach in the QIPCO Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood.\n\n*Has not run since trailing home last of six in the Juddmonte International Stakes over an extended 10 furlongs at York on August 21.\n\nRace record: Starts: 8;

It was a race we’d really targeted and a big deal for us. We’re back again for another crack at it. His preparation has been good this year, but he is obviously a year older. We were a lot easier on him in Dubai so hopefully he’s a fresh horse.\n\n“I haven’t studied the race too much. I know there are some up and coming horses and Sole Power, who beat him last year, but a lot of the names are horses he’s run against quite a lot. It’s not an exact science bit we’ve got him fit and well.\n\n“To win at Ascot would be massive for us because of the long road to get here. It’s not every day that you’ve got a horse to run at Royal Ascot, never mind one that could be competitive in the betting. Not only for me and my team, it would mean a lot to our industry back home, showcasing our horses. Any exposure we get is fantastic for us.\n\n“Winning would be a big reward for everybody, not only me. There’s a big team behind me and Mary Slack has made a big investment buying Abingdon Place (in Newmarket) and fixing it up into the lovely property it is now. There would be a sense of achievement for everybody to have a Royal Ascot winner.”\n\nSoft Falling Rain will run in the Queen Anne Stakes (Tuesday, June 17) and de Kock added: “He didn’t travel well back from Dubai and had a temperature – 10 important days were lost. It’s not ideal. No trainer wants to go into any Group One having had a day when you’re not able to do what you wanted to do.\n\n“But he’s a high-class animal and I hope he can get away with it. He likes it firm and fast, which it sounds like he’ll be getting, and I hope he’ll be in the first four. That’s the type of ground he loves.\n\n“Whether he’s good enough to beat the likes of Toronado remains to be seen. He’s got really solid Group Two form in Dubai and Europe and Group One form in South Africa but he’d have to up his game against these smart horses.\n\n“He was supposed to go the Lockinge but didn’t run because he missed some crucial work. It’s never ideal going into races, not having done exactly what you’d like but we’ve got to have a crack. His run at Newmarket last year (when winning the Group Two Nayef Joel Stakes) was quite impressive.”\n\nShea Shea (SAF) Factfile\n\nBreeding: 7 b g National Emblem (SAF) – Yankee Clipper (SAF) (Jallad (USA))\n\nBreeder: Klawervlei Stud\n\nBorn: September 26, 2007\n\nOwner: Brian Joffe & Myron Berzack\n\nTrainer: Mike de KockSAF\n\nForm: 231151/12613136/11/011242-13\n\n*Set to line up in the King’s Stand Stakes for a second time, having gone down by neck to Sole Power in the five-furlong Group One last year.

He was awarded the South African Chapter of the Ernst & Young World Entrepreneur Award 2003. Racing Interests: Joffe’s interest in racing stems from his father, who owned several horses. He describes himself not a major owner but more of “social investor” in horses, although he admits to investing in 100 horses before finding Shea Shea, including spending almost 3-million rand (nearly £200,000) on one horse that never won. Shea Shea is named after Brian’s grandson, who was a toddler when trainer Geoff Woodruff paid 550,000 rand (a little over £35,000) for the son of National Emblem on behalf of Joffe and Myron Berzack at the 2009 Emperor’s Palace National Yearling Sale.

Struder, who grew up in Knoxville, Tennessee, was left wheelchair-bound following an American football injury and transferred to San Deigo State University to take advantage of the better wheelchair access and warmer weather. While studying at San Diego, he saw Landaluce easily win the Del Mar Debutante Stakes and the Anoakia Stakes at Santa Anita before her untimely death. Heartbroken by her death, Struder decided that he would name his stables after Landaduce, although he would have to wait 28 years to become an owner. After setting up a successful engineering firm back in Tennessee, Struder approached Kenny McPeek with a plan of buying and racing fillies, with the aim of not only owning but also breeding a Grade One winner. His first horse – Niji’s Grand Girl – won twice at Churchill Downs and Gulfstream Park while Volcat captured the Grade Three Virginia Oaks at Colonial Downs in 2012. Rosalind became his first Grade One winner when dead-heating in the Ashland Stakes. Although his stables are registered at Struder’s hometown of Knoxville, all of his fillies and broodmares are based in Kentucky.\n\nKenny McPeek USA – Lexington, Kentucky\n\nBorn: August 2, 1962, Fort Chaffee, Arkansas Background: grew up in the heart of American thoroughbred country at Lexington in Kentucky. He played American football and baseball at Tates Creek High School in Lexington and, after graduating in business administration from the University of Kentucky, he was set on a career in the racing industry. After gaining experience as a hotwalker for Shug McGaughey, he took out a training licence in Kentucky in 1985 and shot to prominence with $20,000 purchase Tejano Run, who finished third in the 1994 Breeders’ Cup Juvenile and second in the following year’s Kentucky Derby. McPeek tasted Classic glory via the ex Brian Meehan-trained Sarava in the 2002 Belmont Stakes and among his other flag-bearers have been Repent, Take Charge Lady, She’s A Devil Due, Harlan’s Holiday, Prince Arch, Dream Empress, Noble’s Promise and Rosalind. Hard Buck won three stakes races in the US and was runner-up in both the Dubai Sheema Classic at Nad Al Sheba, Dubai, and the King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot. The trainer has enjoyed over 100 stakes winners with nearly half of those coming in Graded company including 10 Grade One triumphs to date. McPeek is married to Sue and they have a daughter, Jennifer Lynne. McPeek took a break from training between 2005 and 2006 to concentrate on his other job as a bloodstock agent and during this time purchased subsequent Preakness Stakes, Breeders’ Cup Classic and Dubai World Cup winner Curlin for $57,000. On his return to training, he converted the old Pillar Stud in Lexington to a new training establishment, which he re-named Magdalena, having been inspired to break away from the American practice of training on the track following his visit to Ascot with Hard Buck and a subsequent trip to Australia where a 20-minute conversation with trainer Lee Freedman convinced him of the benefits of training from his own place rather than on racetracks. McPeek has launched his own successful horseracing app – “Horse Races NOW”.
