        "text": "Ilay Golan is a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies (FAMES). He formerly studied at Tel Aviv University for BA and MA degrees in East Asian Studies. His dissertation, under the supervision of Dr. Noga Ganany, explores the religious traditions of pre-modern Chinese overseas merchants. Before China’s transition to modern shipping, Chinese seafarers sailed junks across far-reaching sea routes spanning the entire South China Sea and beyond it for hundreds of years. In doing so, they developed unique religious beliefs, such as a distinct pantheon of deities and shipborne rituals, as they charted the seas as a sacred geography. The mariners’ traditions manifest through maritime writings, rutters, and ritual handbooks from the Song to the Qing eras, and their influence is apparent in modern-day ceremonies as well. Examining this broad range of sources shows a consistent and apprehendable tradition that reflects the historical beliefs and perceptions of Chinese maritime society and adds to our understanding of modern religion in China."
