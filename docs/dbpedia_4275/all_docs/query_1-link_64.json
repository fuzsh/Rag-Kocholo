        "text": "Good Evening!\n\nFirst things first, it has been a long while since I posted, so I do apologise for that. If you follow me on Twitter you will have seen I had a lot of things going on in my personal life with my family, so I took some time away to focus on that. However I am now back. I have today’s post, then from October 2nd I will be back every Saturday at 11am up until the New Year and hopefully beyond. So with that all being said, on to today’s post.\n\nToday marks the final day of the #NationalRacehorseWeek so I am bringing you a brand new post all about my visit to Charlie Longsdon’s Hull Farm last weekend. I had a thoroughly enjoyable day so I am bringing you a little insight into what I seen that day as well as a breakdown of some of the horses Charlie paraded and their future plans. Everything I put into this post was authorised by Charlie to be posted for my audience – With that being said… Enjoy!\n\nWhen we first arrived, we got the chance to walk around and meet some of the stable stars with Charlie and his team around to ask questions and to speak to everyone about the horses in question. I met some lovely horses including an old favourite of mine Glen Forsa. There were quite a few people at the visit including a lot of families and children, who were all meeting the horses and enjoying their afternoon.\n\nCharlie then paraded 32 of his horses out the front for everyone to see. Here we got to see the horses on parade as well as having Charlie explain what each horse had already done and what the plans were for them. The one thing I have always found so incredible is when a trainer can name every horse, their history, their plans, their bloodline and everything in between. I can barely remember what I did last week, let alone 32 horses and everything you need to know about them, but Charlie knew everything and it was really interesting to hear him talk about future plans for his horses. He did explain 2 horses would run on Tuesday at Fontwell and he thought they both had a decent shot of winning, Glimpse Of Gala and Midnight Jewel and in the end, as predicted by Charlie, they both ended up winning. Now onto the horses he paraded…\n\nAlmazhar Garde\n\nKapgarde x Loin De Moi\n\nOwner: Kate & Andrew Brooks\n\nPotentially he will go through the novice hurdle route and then potentially return to chasing.\n\nBeyond The Clouds\n\nPeintre Celebre x Evening\n\nOwner: Robert Aplin\n\nPotentially a run at Kelso in December and maybe go to America.\n\nByzantium Lad\n\nYeats x Socialite Girl\n\nOwner: Stormy Milan Syndicate\n\nOnce the rain turns up he will go chasing.\n\nCarlow Farmer\n\nStowaway x Supreme Fivestar\n\nOwner: Cracker Syndicate\n\nGoing chasing over 3 miles.\n\nCastle Robin\n\nRobin Des Champs x Coco Opera\n\nOwner: Bradley Partnership\n\nNovice chasing when the ground softens up.\n\nDue Reward\n\nWesterner x Long Acre\n\nOwner: Charlie Longsdon\n\nWas brought on Wednesday 8th September from Gigginstown at Doncaster. Charlie said rated around 133 in Ireland. Still very new to the yard so plans will be set out once an owner is found, right now Charlie still owns him.\n\nEclair On Line\n\nDream Well x Odeline\n\nOwner: Eclair On Line Syndicate\n\nGot injured last October so hasn’t ran in over a year. Will go chasing when the ground goes soft.\n\nFreethinker\n\nLibertarian x Supreme Magical\n\nOwner: The Free Thinkers\n\nReady to run in around 3 weeks.\n\nGeorge Bancroft\n\nAustralia x Extensive\n\nOwner: JP McManus\n\nBrought by Charlie recently, JP McManus brought from Charlie around the time of visit. Plan is to go juvenile hurdling.\n\nUnnamed 3 Year Old\n\nGetaway x Missusan\n\nBrought from Ireland in the summer. Will run in a bumper in the spring.\n\nGlen Forsa\n\nMahler x Outback Ivy\n\nOwner: TP Radford\n\nChasing over 3 miles – Possibly a Grand National horse.\n\nGlencassley\n\nYeats x Reseda\n\nOwner: Grant Leon\n\nInteresting fact – He was the last winner before the country went into lockdown in March 2020 when winning at Wetherby. Novice hurdling this season.\n\nGlimpse Of Gala\n\nPassing Glance x Apple Days\n\nOwner: The Tweed Clad Fossils\n\nWon on Tuesday (after the visit) in a Novice Hurdle.\n\nHaas Boy\n\nDiamond Boy x Naker Mome\n\nOwner: Malcolm Olden\n\nUnraced – Potentially a bumper in October.\n\nIf I Say\n\nFree Eagle x Wandering Star\n\nOwner: Charlie Longsdon\n\nShe was brought around 6 weeks ago at Doncaster from David Redvers, he recommended her to Charlie. Has won a point to point bumper, Charlie thinks she will go for a mares only bumper in October and then onto a listed race.\n\nJust Your Type\n\nMorozov x Enistar\n\nOwner: Tyrone Hanlon\n\nHe will be aimed towards some big staying chases over the next season. Charlie said after his back operation he was the first horse he rode again as he trusts him the most in his yard.\n\nThinque Tank\n\nSo You Think x Azharia\n\nOwner: The Charlie Longsdon Racing Club\n\nRan at Newton Abbott on Friday (after visit) and finished 9th. Plan is to run every 3 weeks or so.\n\nLyrical Genius\n\nMilan x Rheinland\n\nOwner: Thackray, Ogilvy, Longsdon\n\nNovice hurdling once it rains, if not enough rain he will run in a bumper. 3 mile chaser in the making.\n\nManinsane\n\nSalutino x Don’t Fall\n\nOwner: Barrels Of Courage\n\nHe fell back in February where he broke a couple of ribs and punctured his lung. He was placed in intensive care and it was touch and go for a little while. Thankfully he is okay now. He has done some pre-training with Claire Hart and will now go on to a Maiden Hurdle around October.\n\nMidnight Jewel\n\nMidnight Legend x Follow The Dream\n\nOwner: Ms GE Morgan\n\nWon on Tuesday at Fontwell (after visit) – Will eventually be a chaser.\n\nMoon King\n\nSea The Moon x Maraba\n\nOwner: Merriebelle Irish Farm Limited\n\nGiven a rating of 115, Charlie thinks he is well handicapped and will be ready to run by mid October and he will be visiting the winning enclosure this season.\n\nOscar Montel\n\nOscar x Montel Girl\n\nOwner: Robert Aplin & Stratford Racecourse\n\nWas brought over from Ireland in May, has ran 5 times and not finished outside of the top 3. He will go to Market Rasen for a Chase or to Warwick for a Hurdles race.\n\nPresent Storm\n\nPresenting x Sunami Storm\n\nOwner: Robert Aplin\n\nCharlie said the jockey Brian Hughes admitted he got it wrong in the last race as he lost a stirrup. She will have 1 or 2 more runs before having a winter break. (She is declared on Tuesday 21st for the 3:20 at Warwick with Brian Hughes riding.)\n\nRivarros\n\nAgent Secret x Rive Sarthe\n\nOwner: 100 Not Out\n\nArrived from Ireland late last year. Needs 1 more run for a handicap mark. Chasing on slow ground will be his future.\n\nSaint Dalina\n\nSaint Des Saints x Dalina\n\nOwner: Alan Halsall\n\nStarted the season rated 108, finished it rated 130. Will go chasing over 3 miles as well as some black type races.\n\nStroll On By\n\nWalk In The Park x Liss Croga\n\nOwner: Old Gold Racing\n\nUnraced horse. He was brought over from Ireland in the Spring and will be aimed for a bumper in the Autumn.\n\nSupremely Lucky\n\nMilan x Lucky Supreme\n\nOwner: Malcolm Olden\n\nNeeds to build up his confidence, Charlie would like to take him chasing as his current hurdle mark may make it tough to win some big hurdle races.\n\nTea For Free\n\nCourt Cave x Golan Gale\n\nOwner: Mrs Susan Monkland\n\nArrived from Ireland in the Spring after winning an Irish Point to Point. He will go hurdling on good ground before eventually going chasing over 2.6-3 miles.\n\nTeenage Dirtbag\n\nFame And Glory x Tavadden\n\nOwner: The Saddleworth Players\n\nCharlie said he thinks the penny had only just dropped with this horse and he now understands what he is doing. He thinks he travelled too well last time as he did not know what to do when he hit the front. He wll be back on a racecourse very soon.\n\nThe Mighty Arc\n\nArcadio x Funcheon Lady\n\nOwner: Leon & Thorton Families\n\nHe will go chasing when the ground is a little softer, around late October. He has shown plenty of speed so Charlie thinks he may suit 2 miles 4 furlongs.\n\nThe Wise Traveller\n\nGetaway x Butterfly Betty\n\nOwner: The Endeavour Racing Syndicate\n\nWon English Point to Point end of last year, has had a wind op since his last run and will need another tidy up of his wind before his first run. He will run in a maiden hurdle, then possibly go down the handicap route, however long term goals are to send him over fences.\n\nUnnamed 4 Year Old\n\nWesterner x Beneficial Breeze\n\nTaken a long time to get ready, plans to go for a bumper before going hurdling later this Autumn. Western Zethra may be his name.\n\nWe then headed over to the schooling ground where Kielan Woods and Paul O’Brien schooled 3 horses each. When you get to be so close to the fences they jump, it’s an incredible experience and it’s brilliant to hear Charlie talking to the jockey’s about various things as they go too.\n\nLittle Bruce\n\nYeats x Lady Rolfe\n\nOwner: The GPS Partnership\n\nIn his career he has won the North Yorkshire National as well as coming second at 66/1 in the Listed Summer Cup at Uttoxeter. Charlie says he will continue to run in staying chases and go to the Cross Country races at Cheltenham in the Autumn.\n\nIllegal Model\n\nStowaway x She’s So Beautiful\n\nOwner: Alan Halsall\n\nThe plan is for him to go chasing on soft ground and he will be aimed at some staying chases later in the season. Charlie thinks he is a Midlands National or Welsh National horse.\n\nVivas\n\nDavidoff x Lavircas\n\nOwner: Nigel M. Davies\n\nHe finished 5th in the Cross Country at Cheltenham in November 2020, however he’s not seen out the trip since. He has had a recent wind operation. Charlie said he would run at Warwick on the 21st of September or Market Rasen on the 25th of September. (He is declared for Tuesday 21st at Warwick in the 3:55 with Jonathan Burke riding.)\n\nNightfly\n\nMidnight Legend x Whichway Girl\n\nOwner: Mrs DPH Flory\n\nShe won last time out at Stratford in March. She will run a couple more times over fences, but long-term she will become a broodmare for her owners.\n\nTrain Hill\n\nSubtle Power x Aljapip\n\nOwner: Old Gold Syndicate\n\nHe was recently brought by the Old Gold Syndicate from Swanee River Partnership and will be advertised to buy shares soon. He has finished 2nd in his last two runs and Charlie thinks it won’t be long until he goes one better.\n\nGuetapan Collonges\n\nSaddler Maker x Saturne Collonges\n\nOwner: JP McManus\n\nHe is rated 108 after winning twice earlier this year. Charlie has said he will now go chasing and he believes he is a staying chaser in the making and he will possibly develop into a regional National type horse.\n\nOverall, I had a brilliant afternoon and so did everybody there. I hope you all got the opportunity to visit a yard this past week for #NationalRacehorseWeek and if you haven’t then hopefully the chance will arise for you. I highly recommend anyone to visit a stable and see the behind the scenes and how loved these animals are. I am so grateful I get given the chance to spend so much time around these loving and talented horses.\n\nQuick side note before I finish: I will be back with the Racing TV’s Raceday team on September 29th from Nottingham taking you behind the scenes. It’s been a little while since I last worked with them so I’m very excited to get back to it. If you don’t already follow the page then head over and do so. @raceday.rtv on Instagram and @raceday_rtv on Twitter.\n\nI hope you all enjoyed this post and I will see you Saturday the 2nd of October at 11am for a brand new one!\n\nGood Evening!\n\nWelcome to Part 2 of my interview with Tom Green and Will Kinsey – let’s just jump straight into it.\n\nI think it is only right we mention the BBC Panorama episode, firstly did you watch it and secondly what can racing do as a sport to change the perception of racing that people now have due to that episode?\n\nWill: I didn’t watch it live but I did watch it a few days later when it had all calmed down and there was some shocking images. But at the same time I felt like from a racing point of view a lot had to be taken with a pinch of salt because a lot of them didn’t look like race horses. The main problem was the slaughter house, if that’s how people think slaughter houses treat the horses then one thing is for sure, people in this industry will not be sending horses to places like that. You’re going to get some cases where with all due respect some horses are not safe to rehome or they have been injured and unfortunately need to be sent to be humanely put to sleep but those cases are very few and far between.\n\nI think in this country racing does an awful lot for after care and does more and more for traceability and the transfer of responsibility and E-passports. They’re doing everything possible to make sure horses have the best life before, during and after racing. I felt like not a true picture was portrayed in that Panorama for sure, it was very one sided, they picked out a couple of examples and some pretty old footage on there as well, but that is not the norm. There is always going to be the odd case, there is always going to be human’s doing bad things in any walk of life but it is our responsibility to make sure we minimise this and give the horses the best care because ultimately we are breeding these horses for people to own them and train them for their pleasure so it’s only right and respectful we make sure they have good aftercare.\n\nFrom my experience I don’t know anybody in this industry who thinks otherwise or treats horses badly because if they do they’re not in this industry, they’re soon out. I think in this country we do everything well and we’re striving to do it even better with that side of things.\n\nTom: Yeah, I think the industry as a whole needs to look at is and see that certain things need to be done straight away. They’re not fixes but they’ll make it harder. Bute is a common treatment, it’s like paracetamol for humans and if you went around and how many humans had taken paracetamol, the large majority would say they had. I think one of the things these people were trying to do was get contaminated meat into the food chain so what I would do is make every thoroughbred passport as not fit for consumption because most have been treated with bute anyway. It’s not going to fix the issues but it will make it a lot harder.\n\nThere are certainly question marks about how certain horses microchips have got from one horse to another that need to be looked into by the IHRB. However I do think it was very one sided, if you look at the transfer of responsibility that the BHA have brought in they are doing quite a lot and as I said we have rehomed one that now does dressage. I know a lot of people who have rehome horses that still keep in touch and still know what they’ve gone on to do. Every owner I know has made sure that their horse goes on to have a happy life after and that’s very important.\n\nCertainly there’s question marks about the ‘reputable dealer’ because if I went to my trainer who said it’s not going to make a race horse but it’s a really nice horse and I know this man who looks after the horses and can find it a nice home then I’d be thinking yeah this is great because the horse will go on to have a really nice life. You trust the trainer to go that way, but he wasn’t named in the programme. There are definitely questions to be answered but I also agree that it was a quite one sided programme.\n\nWill: The main character was a guy from Animal Aid that won’t stop until horse racing is stopped.\n\nTom: Well Animal Aid don’t want people to have animals as pets full stop.\n\nWill: Exactly. There are far greater problems in this world. These horses get the best care, you’ve been here today and see how they’re treated. They are wild animals and we do breed them to do a job, but they will do terrible things. But with the lame horse on that programme, if he was transported like that then that is shocking but he could have done that, for all we know, whilst being transported. I do feel it was very one sided but we need to keep striving to do more and make these cases less. There was no side to that programme showing all the horses doing ROR (Retraining of Racehorses) and have a great after life. It was sensationalism in the large part and the majority of horses get really well looked after but unfortunately there are some sick people in this world who do sick things.\n\nTom: And anything we can do to minimise that is needed. Horse racing has always struggled with its image and I think syndicates are a great way to change that image and the sport should embrace that because people can be shown the realities so having TopSpeed we can bring people to see how the horses are treated. Like, how many people know that at Jonjo O’Neill’s there is a spa and a solarium and a swimming pool and a dedicated spa manager to make sure the animals are looked after. Racing needs to educate people because it’s got so much it can offer that other sports can’t.\n\nWill: It’s come a long way, it’s made a lot of good changes like the whip and the fences at Aintree and stuff like that, horse welfare has come a long way. But there also has to come a point where there is so much we can do before it becomes something different.\n\nAnd mentioning the whip there, where do you stand with the jockey bans, do they work or should the horse be disqualified if the jockey uses it too many times?\n\nWill: I don’t think the horse should be thrown out of the race, it’s not the horses fault or the owners fault who pays the bills.\n\nTom: But I don’t think the jockey ban works, it’s not a big enough deterrent at the minute for those top races and that’s where they need to look at making changes. For example, The Hundred, they were fining teams for not bowling their overs quick enough and it didn’t work so now they’ve changed it, that’s what racing has been doing, they’re fining the jockey’s with bans and it hasn’t changed. Racing needs to have a look at how it can punish jockey’s who haven’t done it properly. But throwing the horse out as an owner, I can see both sides to the argument.\n\nPerfect example is Native River in the Gold Cup, everyone knows I love Native River, but Richard Johnson used his whip too many times and ended up with a ban, in that race if he hadn’t Might Bite could have got up and beat him, so what can racing do?\n\nWill: It’s a tough one, in terms of yes that was a gruelling race and to an outsider seeing a horse being hit it looks like it’s being beaten, but sometimes you need to keep the horse awake and keeping it decisive for the safety of the horse and the safety of the jockey. But ultimately Native River keeps coming back and winning races. If he didn’t like it he would just stop. In some respects the whip isn’t as bad as some people think it is. Richard was an old school jockey, who’s now obviously retired, so he’s seen all the rules come and go. I actually got banned in a close finish, but I only hit it twice after the last but it was the day after the new rules came in and I remember thinking I didn’t have a clue why the stewards wanted to see me. I think I hit it 10 times instead f 8 or something like that, but there was never more than 2 hits after 1 fence and I wasn’t a big man for using the whip at all but there is a time and a place when you need to use it when a horse is stopping underneath you. On a big occasion like the Gold Cup there is always the argument they’re only doing it because it’s the Gold Cup but sometimes you can lose count.\n\nThat was another question I had, in your head are you counting how many times you have used the whip or in that moment when you’re full of adrenaline do you lose count or forget to count?\n\nWill: From the second last to the last to the line you have a fair old idea, but what if you gave them one earlier in the race? You may have forgotten about that one. So yes and no, you have a fair idea, but the argument to that is if in doubt don’t use it again. David Egan, he got fined on Mishriff this year and it was 10% of his winnings which was £100,000 because he won a million, which is an awful lot of money. If you said to a jockey would you win the Gold Cup or Grand National for no money, then I bet they would all say yes of course I would.\n\nTom: I think the issue is, take Might Bite and Native River, if he hadn’t gone over would Might Bite have won? I would probably say no, I think Native River still would have won because he’s a tough horse. But the bit I get annoyed with is interference, that needs to be looked at because the French have went too far one way but we’re too far the other. You can almost take a horse out of the race because as long as you’re a head clear you’re still fine. That can have a serious impact on the flat.\n\nWill: Maybe a rule where for each hit over the ruled amount they lose a length or something like that, just putting ideas out there. It’s a pretty black and white rule then. So if they finish half a length ahead and hit 1 over then they lose a length and get demoted to second. But you are penalising the owner but that’s the jockey’s responsibility.\n\nTom: And as an owner, you get a say in what jockey rides your horses so if you have a jockey who has been found as a culprit multiple times who’s lost plenty of lengths you won’t put them on your horse so jockey’s will need to adapt. Having that rule, yes some jockey’s will make a mistake but over time jockeys will modify their behaviour and that’s what you need to do.\n\nWill: It is difficult because riding a horse in a 7 furlong sprint is different to riding a horse in a 3 mile chase around Chepstow on heavy ground, if you’re coming to the last do you want to take that decision away from the jockey that you can’t use the whip if the horse needs it to get him to concentrate. In Richard’s defence, we’re a similar age, that’s how we were educated so you need to educate the jockeys coming through. I find it a grey area that there is the same rule for the flat as well as the jumps, it’s a real difficult one, without killing the sport as well. I was never one to use the whip so when I got my one and only ban it came as a shock but you know occasionally, the horse I rode was in head gear and lively. I’m not for a ban, I think the rules are pretty good at the moment but I don’t like seeing a jockey go over and I don’t like them doing it just because it’s a big event.\n\nLooking from the other side, Richard Johnson as the example, if he hadn’t went over and he had been beaten by Might Bite, he would then potentially get penalised by the stewards for essentially throwing the race.\n\nTom: Then he’s able to say I gave him the best ride possible, I got to the limit. They keep reducing the number of times the whip can be used, has that resulted in jockeys getting better at riding and controlling a horse and motivating a horse? That’s an interesting side point.\n\nWill: I have a bigger problem when a horse is being hit with no time to respond opposed to how many times it was hit over 3 miles.\n\nTom: Yeah, if it’s hit every so many miles but then it’s hit 3 times in a row with no time to react in between then that’s a bigger injustice. I think horse racing makes a lot of these issues for themselves by not being transparent and educating those outside of the sport.\n\nWill: Ultimately Richard is not hitting Native River to hurt him, when they crossed the line he was hugging him and kissing him. That horse is then getting cuddled by owners, trainers, everybody. Nobody loves Native River as much as Richard Johnson.\n\nTom: Zoe would give him a run for his money!\n\nWill: They’re both in it together, I felt like they were very much a match made in heaven. We need to do what we can without ruining the sport. Going off topic slightly, VAR has ruined football, you can keep trying to iron out these things, but I think the rules are pretty good.\n\nYou’re both very knowledgeable within breeding and pedigrees, so with the passing of Galileo earlier this year how much of an impact will that have on the breeding side of things within horse racing?\n\nTom: I’d argue not that big now actually because there are so many of his off-spring that are top class that Coolmore were using him less and less because they were needing crosses for his daughters. I think the legacy he leaves will be massive and it already is. You just need to look at Frankel who is another superstar who may go on to eclipse him.\n\nWill: I think that that’s huge that he doesn’t belong to Coolmore.\n\nThat was another question, with Frankel not being at Coolmore, what horse from Coolmore do you now see being their flagship stallion?\n\nTom: They’ve just brought Wootton Bassett who I think they’ll use to cross with Galileo’s daughters. I think it’s a really interesting time for Coolmore actually, I think they thought they’d solved all their problems with Deep Impact and part of the issue, because Galileo has been so dominant most of their top mares are by him so they can’t use a son of him so they’re going to have those out crosses. It’s interesting he had Gleneagles who lots of people knocked and there was a bit of a resurgence. Australia has done really really well. I just can’t get over the fact that when I visited Coolmore, Gleneagles is the spitting image of his dad, he is literally his twin. I could see him taking on from Coolmore, but I actually think that because they have so many of his daughters, they will focus on the out crossings and it’ll be a case of Camelot and Wootton Bassett.\n\nWill: Obviously the Galileo impact is huge. But ultimately he is the sire of middle distance runners, but the commercial flat market doesn’t really want it anyway. He’s still going to have a legacy for many years to come, as Tom said, he has all of his mares and more foals to be born by him so a special horse may come through. Frankel is just doing amazingly well.\n\nTom: If you compare Frankel and Galileo like for like, Frankel is ahead of Galileo at the same stage. I think the biggest impact will be over the next few years seeing the relationship between Coolmore and Godolphin or Darley has got a lot better. So you’ve seen them send a lot of their top class Galileo mares get sent to them which has came at a really good time for Coolmore. I think they will also try to promote Wootton Bassett massively but in terms of a son it will be Frankel who will be a clear favourite. And Camelot has already proven he can produce good horses.\n\nWill: It’ll be good because we’ll get to see top class mares go to other stallions too. It is a huge impact that he isn’t there and his legacy will last for years to come and other stallions will naturally take over, which will be a good thing for the breeding industry really.\n\nOn from that, Aidan O’Brien has always been given a large crop of Galileo’s off-spring, he also has his two sons who are very young and only just getting started, do you think either of them could beat their dad’s records or now without Galileo here to produce Aidan always had the one up on them?\n\nTom: I don’t think either of them will go on to beat his record. I think the main issue is that there is two of them. Even if they get supported by Coolmore, unless one of them takes the major role, Aidan get’s all of Coolmore’s power behind him, ultimately if you split that then they won’t have the same fire power he has got. I also thinkk with the way the cycle is going, Godolphin are coming back to when they were in their heyday and I think they will put up a fight with Coolmore for those top races.\n\nYou both know racing very well, so are there any young horses or stallions you’d tell people to keep an eye out over the next few years?\n\nWill: In terms of national hunt stallions, it’s a very interesting time with a lot of top leading stallions gone. Walk In The Park has been doing very well in the sales so naturally he’ll have been seen by a lot of good broodmares, so you’d think him. He’s an obvious one to follow. This side of the water is very interesting, Kayf Tara has gone who was the leading light here. We’ve got a lot of younger, unproven stallions. It’s quite an exciting time, you could send a mare to one of these stallions cheaply, then in a couple of years time they become very popular. We have a few foals by Masterstroke who is very well bred and they have a great temperament. We support a lot of British stallions here this year, we’ve sent a few to Nathaniel. I think it’s an exciting time. People are all doom and gloom saying we have no nice stallions but we could be sat here in 5 years time saying how many brilliant stallions we have.\n\nOn the flat Bated Breath who is proven and as I said earlier, Gleneagles after being out in the cold a little bit last year.\n\nOn Thursday we seen the Racing League start, what did you both think, do you think it will work and do you think it will get a younger audience involved or do you think there is still more that needs to be done?\n\nTom: We have spoken about this a lot because Will was there as his new business venture Thoroughbid sponsors one of the teams.\n\nWill: I’ve got to say it was a lot of fun, there was a great atmosphere. It was really refreshing. We had some owners in our team who had came all the way from Cornwall or Devon and they were in the last race but because all the horses were in the same colours and were trained by Richard Hannon or Andrew Balding they actually felt like the owner of every horse we had and when the horse ran well and still gained points for the team they felt like they were really a part of it. We had trainers cheering on other trainers horses and because on a day to day basis it’s an individuals game so the vibe was great and everybody there really brought into it and had more fun than they ever anticipated. I just think from a racing point of view, I seen people I knew from Liverpool there who shouted over and wanted a cap and then they were cheering on every horse in blue from there.\n\nMost people who go racing don’t know anything about racing, they go for a day or night out and if you hand them a programme they have no idea what any of it means, they pick a horse on its colour or name or something like that and now they pick a team and know what horse they’re supporting and they have friends supporting other teams. The racing was supremely competitive and loads of prize money.\n\nBeing there I thought it was a great success and I’m sure there is loads of things they can change, they’ve had a lot of negative press but all of that is from people who are not involved because they feel like they can’t compete for the great prize money and I understand that but Rome wasn’t built in a day. We need change to appeal to a different audience, we can’t keep saying no to everything and I thought it was brilliant.\n\nTom: From a neutral point of view, I think there’s lots of good stuff and anything that can bring racing forward is needed. They could have done a few things definitely better, one thing I would do is look at The Hundred because it was highly controversial before it started but now everyone on social media is really enjoying it, including lots of kids, so they should look at The Hundred and learn from them, like the music and stuff. Racing has been panned by traditionalists for having concerts afterwards, whereas if I was the Racing League I would go and find a big name to be on stage and rather than have a concert at the end I’d have them sing a few songs before racing and a song or two in-between each race. You can then have the commentators speak to the band and ask them who they’re all supporting and the fans there for the band will hear them say for example ‘team Thoroughbid’ and suddenly they will be paying attention to the racing to support that team. With The Hundred they have used BBC DJ’s and Chris Hughes, who would have been brilliant for the Racing League – they have built it for the younger audience and racing should therefore bring those aspects into it because some people would go just for the music but then actually quite enjoy the racing because racing is a brilliant sport and has lots to offer.\n\nWill: What I thought was key was every race was competitive and competitive racing, no matter what the standard generates an atmosphere. What generates the atmosphere is the team event because they’re supporting everything Hayley rides or they’re supporting team Thoroughbid and going with their team. If you have an atmosphere, people have fun and come back again. There are things that they can do, but they’ve had a great start and I’m looking forward to next week.\n\nComparing it to The Hundred which is shown on BBC, do you think it’s going to be a big hit that you can only watch the Racing League on Sky?\n\nWill: To start with, of course, but lots of sport has been lost off terrestrial TV and if you’re doing evening racing a lot of people will want to watch Love Island or whatever, I record that, but the more channels the better.\n\nTom: I think it’s massive, BBC doesn’t have ads which on other channels annoy people because they’ll switch channels in the ad breaks. I was watching the Racing League but then an advert would come on and I’d turn over to The Hundred and get engrossed in that then all of a sudden switch back and miss a race. A lot of people would say and I am one of them that since BBC lost horse racing how many times have you seen horse racing on BBC for a good reason? Never is the answer to that. All I’ve seen and heard from BBC is all about The Hundred, they’ve got the full weight of their advertising behind it because it’s a big thing because they don’t have as much sport, whereas with Sky they have so many good sports now that it’s fighting with that.\n\nWill: At the moment we’re in a weird time with the Olympics being pushed back and the Lions and a lot of people said why put it on the same day as Goodwood, where actually I think it was a good thing, because people were watching Goodwood and enjoying it and thought Racing League starts tonight lets put that on. I can understand why people think it’s a negative but I think it’s a positive too.\n\nTom: But if they were watching Goodwood on ITV which most people do, how much were ITV talking about the Racing League? I didn’t watch it so I don’t know the answer to that but I would guess not much.\n\nWill: I think cricket already has an audience, in summer at school what sport do you play? Cricket, not horse racing. So we need to get the message out there because if your parents don’t watch it, you probably won’t either. I think it’s great and like with The Hundred, minds will get turned. If you don’t force change, change will never happen. It’s exciting because it’s racing hopefully moving forward\n\nWill, you sponsor one of the teams with your new venture Thoroughbid, so can you tell people what Thoroughbid is?\n\nWill: Thoroughbid is an auction house, predominantly online that we have just launched. It’s very much trying to bring the bloodstock world, firstly into the 21st century and make it more accessible to people. If a man on the street walked into Doncaster sales and went to buy a horse, they wouldn’t have a clue. Whereas what we’re trying to do is modernise things – physical auctions are great and they will always have their place but ultimately with racing a lot of things haven’t changed. The days of trainers having time off are gone, when you go to Doncaster sales in May there are jumps meetings in the day and on the evening, so if a trainer is going for their traditional end of season sale to buy and sell horses, they now have to send staff to the sales, staff to the meeting in the afternoon, staff on the evening meeting and where does the trainer actually go?\n\nDuring the pandemic online auctions were huge because to continue working they had no choice, but in Australia online sales are huge partly because the size of the country and they can’t move their horses around as much. But we could tell an awful lot from the videos and pictures, they were very good. There is a huge market for it. This way if you want to see the horses once you see the videos then there is plenty of time to arrange a visit to see them. From an owners point of view you can apply for a horse without going through the trainer, where traditionally the trainer buys the horses then sells them to the owners.\n\nWe’re starting with a Sunday evening to start with where people may have a dinner and enjoy the process. It also takes that credit risk away from the trainer, it can be passed straight onto the owner. The biggest USP is that we are limiting credit. If you go to the sales you can buy it then don’t have to pay for 30 days and as the vendor you don’t receive the money for 30 days, whereas this way we are saying we’re going to receive the money and pay the vendor within 7 days. It also saves a lot of money and risks for the owners, trainers and vendors, they have to pay people to go there, look after the horses, the travel there and back and the risk of taking the horses away from their stable to a strange environment for 3 days, the hotels, meals, staff, all of that.\n\nBut mostly it’s to bring people in and see the process and the transparency. There’s a huge hunger for it from the owners and trainers so it’s exciting.\n\nOn Thursday evening you had a team Thoroughbid winner, from that, you still have Oisin Murphy and Sean Levey to come back, do you see your team doing well or even winning?\n\nWill: I didn’t back it by the way, I thought I did but I backed something else instead. We’re going to win it! It was really really competitive and when I was in the paddock in between race 1 or 2 there was that vibe that everyone had targeted these races and they’re going to for £50,000 a race and £150,000 for the winner of the competition so the trainers are taking it very seriously. I thought the format was really great, 5 furlongs, 6 furlongs, 7 furlongs, it made it really easy to understand and it worked really well. I think our strengths lie possibly in the longer races, but hopefully we will do okay. It’s all good sport.\n\nAnd finally, for anyone who hasn’t joined TopSpeed yet, in a few short sentences can you tell us why they should join and how they can do so?\n\nTom: It’s the fun of ownership and having that shared experience with other like minded people and hopefully being able to experience top class horses in big races – that’s our aim for everyone. They can buy as many shares as they’d like on our website.\n\nWill: The fun, the content they get is second to none, the all round experience and you’ll be very much made to feel a part of the team and become more knowledgeable about racing in general.\n\nI want to say a massive thank you to Will and Tom for their hospitality, their time and their knowledge. I had a brilliant day meeting the horses and speaking about all things racing.\n\nIf you want to get involved with TopSpeed Thoroughbreds then visit their website to sign up and buy your shares: https://www.topspeedracing.co.uk/ – If you have any questions then please do message me or the guys and those will all be answered for you!\n\nI hope you all enjoyed this interview as much as I have and I will see you all in my next post!\n\nGood Evening!\n\nWelcome to a new post here at zoelouisesmithx.com! Today’s post is a very exciting one! Yesterday I was lucky enough to be invited up North to Peel Hall Stud to meet some of the TopSpeed Thoroughbreds horses, plus some other incredible prospects and also to interview Tom and Will about the syndicate but also all things racing. This post would be ridiculously long if I put it all into one so I have decided to split it into two, the second post will go up at 7pm this evening so you don’t have too long to wait to read it! So without further ado, I’m just going to jump right in!\n\nWhen we arrived at Peel Hall Stud, Will had arranged for some of the horses to be paraded on the front lawn...\n\nAll The Glory\n\nFame And Glory x Glorybe\n\n4 Year Old Filly\n\nJonjo O’Neill\n\nAll The Glory came 3rd when she made her debut at Ludlow back in May in a bumper and looks to be a pretty exciting prospect for those involved with her! She looked gorgeous and has enjoyed her summer holidays, she was brought in this week with the other TopSpeed horses so she could meet everyone when they have the owners open day next Saturday! She will be off back to Jonjo’s shortly to get ready for the new season.\n\nUrban Grit\n\nCityscape x Lady Azamour\n\n4 Year Old Gelding\n\nOlly Murphy\n\nUrban Grit came second in his debut at Huntingdon in May in a bumper. The winner was a JP McManus owned horse called Call Of The Wind and interestingly the 3rd placed horse Starlyte for Ian Williams has since won a race, so very good form potentially to follow Urban Grit.\n\nAnother interesting point is this race was split into two and if Urban Grit was in the other side of the draw, based on time he would have won the other race. So again, another very interesting horse to be involved with. Olly seems to be impressed with him and is looking forward to having him back to start his training for his next campaign.\n\nUnnamed\n\nArctic Cosmos x South Queen Lady\n\n4 Year Old Gelding\n\nDonald McCain\n\nHe is currently unraced, however Donald McCain is looking forward to having him in training and ready to start his racing career. Will and Tom explained he has taken a little longer than some of the other horses to really settle and mature – This is not a concern and is pretty common with male horses. But he is almost ready to be sent to Donald and he should be well away once he’s there and in full training.\n\nGalaxy Dancer\n\nTelescope x La Doelenaise\n\n4 Year Old Filly\n\nPhil Kirby\n\nGalaxy Dancer made her debut in March at Newcastle where she finished 10th out of 12 runners with a pretty disappointing run. Phil is going to have her back and see if they can get an improvement from her, so we will see how her journey goes!\n\nWalk In The Storm\n\nWalk In The Park x Mucho Macabi\n\n4 Year Old Filly\n\nIan Williams\n\nWalk In The Storm came 2nd in her debut run at Worcester in April, beaten by Kim Bailey’s I Spy A Diva. Interestingly the 3rd placed horse Malaita for Mel Rowley has since won so again nice form coming out of this race. Ian Williams loves Walk In The Storm and thinks she could be very special.\n\nWe then seen 2 horses from the pin hooking syndicate.\n\nFirst was a 2 year old filly by Westerner. She is the sister to a black type horse.\n\nThe second is a 2 year old gelding by Blue Bresil.\n\nWe then seen a couple of yearlings.\n\nThe first one we seen was a yearling by Telescope. He was born in late April and I must admit, I fell in love with him!\n\nNext out was a lovely Mahler yearling. Again, she was lovely but she definitely had a mind of her own.\n\nNext out was a Nathanial filly. Something I love about TopSpeed is they have options. If a horse is not performing for their owners then TopSpeed have it wrote into their terms and conditions that they will replace the horse in that syndicate. This gorgeous girl is an option for TopSpeed if they wish to replace a horse.\n\nThe final horse we seen is a very exciting one! She has been given the nickname Polly because she is the half sister to the Queen Mother Chase and Arkle Chase Put The Kettle On. She is by Valirann out of Name for Fame.\n\nIn the very near future she will be entered into a syndicate for TopSpeed – so make sure you all keep an eye out for this one because I think it will be a very quick selling syndicate. I am super excited for this one, if she can go on to be half as good as Put The Kettle On then she is going to be such an exciting horse for all of her owners.\n\nWe were then lucky enough to visit all of the horses in their boxes and as everybody knows by now I just adore animals in general so being able to meet all the horses and give them cuddles was a dream!\n\nWe were also given the opportunity to have a walk round and see some of the lovely babies that have been born this year! Surprisingly, I have never actually met horses this young before, although I get to visit stables regularly, I always meet the fully grown horses ready to run so it was so exciting to meet all the babies.\n\nWe also got the chance to meet the lovely Cara’s Way who Will now owns. He brought her from Gigginstown who had her in training with Gordon Elliott, however she never won for them. Will purchased her and sent her into training with Phil Kirby and interestingly she won her first race at Doncaster in January 2019. However next time out she finished 6th out of 8 horses so Will retired her and she now stays at Peel Hall ready to produce some gorgeous offspring. She is such a gorgeous looking horse!\n\nIt was then time to sit down and have a chat about all things racing with two very knowledgeable people within the sport.\n\nFirstly, how did you both get into racing?\n\nTom: I got into racing from gambling to start off with. I enjoyed a gamble every now and then and I started to look at the horses and I actually decided to take the plunge and join a syndicate which was really good and from there it snowballed into having some of my own horses. The first time I went to the sales, I went with a current trainer who I was using at that time and said let’s go and buy one half decent horse, so I went with about £50,000 to the sales at Doncaster to buy one and we came back with four. And it’s been that way since. Then I started to buy youngsters so we knew how they’d been brought up and they didn’t have any issues and move them down to Will’s and that’s how I met Will and it’s gone on from there.\n\nWill: We were farmers but we always had point to pointers and hunters. My Grandad had point to pointers, my dad’s mom’s dad trained so there was training on that side of the family. I was probably a typical boy really, my sister did the ponies and the only condition for me riding the ponies was that my sister mucked them out whilst I was kicking a ball around. But yeah, we always had horses here and from 16 onwards I went to point to points and went in the beer tent and had a few bets and mixing more in those circles made racing more interesting. Then when I left school I’d been playing rugby and I wasn’t getting any bigger so I said to my parents I fancy a go at race riding and they were like “you what” but my love of racing grew really. I then got into following the pedigrees and it grew and grew from there really.\n\nFor those who haven’t heard of Top Speed before, can you explain what it is you do?\n\nTom In simple terms, it’s a microshare syndicate. We’re trying to bring as many people into the joy of owning a horse as possible alongside both mine and Will’s ethos of we want to have quality horses. We’ve always said if you want to have a horse who runs in a class 6 around Wolverhampton then you can go and get those really easily, but what we’re trying to provide is something a bit different. We won’t go and buy horses in training, we will go and buy foals and yearlings and 3 year old unbroken horses that we think have a chance of taking members to the very top. We do 2 year syndicates so they definitely have enough time and that’s where Will’s experience with the pin hooking and my side of things with the younger horses we think we’ve got something different for people that they can see the progression right from the 3 year old national hunt horse, they can see them brought back to Peel Hall, see them get broken in, see it learn how to loose school and that whole process that most people never see and then they go to the trainer and they get to see all of that as well. They get to have the full picture. That’s why we have a pin hooking syndicate as well so people can see the other side of racing and the breeding and get involved in that too.\n\nAnd what race on the flat and over jumps would you like to win with TopSpeed? If you could pick just one.\n\nTom: On the flat it would have to be the Derby because then you’ve got a stallion. Over jumps I’ve got two… One’s a bit weird. I’ve always wanted to win the Supreme at the Cheltenham Festival just because it’s the first race and that massive roar and I guess I’d quite like – and maybe we have one in Polly – a Champion Chase horse. That would be brilliant.\n\nWill: On the flat it would definitely be the Derby without a doubt and then over jumps – we may have to have a horse in the syndicate for quite a few years to do it but it would have to be the Grand National. Maybe it’s not applicable to TopSpeed because to win it we’d need an 8 or 9 year old really and that’s pretty long term, but that’s not saying it won’t happen but it won’t be for a few years because the oldest one we have is 4. So if you’re talking about a young horse it would probably be the Champion Bumper or the Supreme or one of he big novice hurdles at Cheltenham or Aintree or Punchestown.\n\nWhen I tweeted saying I was interviewing you both I had so many questions from owners asking how the horses are, what the plans are and when they’ll be returning to their trainers so how are they all at the moment?\n\nWill: So yeah the ones that are here have only been back in a week, Urban Grit has been in 3 weeks – he’s been cantering away slowly. He’s doing 2 and 2 which means cantering 4 furlongs one way and 4 the other. And then in-between days he’s doing some loose jumps so nothing too strenuous. Galaxy Dancer, All The Glory, Walk In The Storm and the Arctic Cosmos came back in Monday, so they’ve been on the walker and we’ll start riding them this week.\n\nIn terms of prospects for them all, Tom can fill in here too – the Arctic Cosmos we need to get him to Donald’s, hopefully we’ve ironed out his little niggles.\n\nTom: Urban Grit – Olly thinks he is more than capable of winning a bumper so we will be targeting a bumper and depending on how he performs in that we will either step up or he will look at going over obstacles. He’ll start his hurdling career.\n\nWill: I think that applies for all the others as well really.\n\nTom: Yeah they will all start off in bumpers and then the vast majority of them will start their novice hurdling. Walk In The Storm may be a bit different, she’s already pencilled in for a listed bumper so she will probably have one bumper to get into the swing of things but then go on to a listed bumper, possibly at Huntingdon and if that goes really well then maybe we look at another top bumper or she might then go and jump some hurdles.\n\nWill: Realistically, unless one of them is going to go for a black type bumper or one of the festivals then what is the point of keeping them in bumpers. I’d sooner get them jumping.\n\nTom: Yeah, second year of the syndicate they’re all 4 year olds and raced at least one other than Cosmo. Say Urban Grit wins his bumper and wins it well then we may look at a black type bumper for him but otherwise we will get them going over hurdles and have a novice campaign and hopefully they keep showing the ability they’ve got. That’ll be the fingers crossed bit hopefully.\n\nYou have both been to the sales plenty of times, so personally what do you both look for when purchasing a horse?\n\nWill: Traditionally the first thing is the pedigree. You’ll get a catalogue come through the post, so that’s what you go with initially. Then you go around and look at them physically. I would look for an athlete then the rest of it. If I don’t think it looks like an athlete then the rest is immaterial. So always an athlete with a good temperament.\n\nTom: When you’ve got the sales coming up and we’re hoping to have a sales syndicate where we can hopefully include people in the buying syndicate where we can show them the process. First thing we have to do is narrow down the list. If we look at the flat sales coming up there’s book 1, 2, 3 and 4 which is what 2000 horses so it’s impossible really to go and look at all of them. So you have to go through the pedigrees, shortlist them and then look at the physical. For me, when the horse first comes out of the box in the first 5 seconds you get that gut feeling where it’s ‘oh wow’ and you seriously have a look at it. In the first 5 seconds you’ll know if you’re interested or not because they will catch your eye. Then after that it’s if it’s correct but I agree with Will that the most important thing is if it moves well, if it moves nicely you’re more willing to forgive if it’s slightly incorrect. The physical dictates if you buy it, then the pedigree dictates how much it’s worth. That’s how we look at it. Some people just look at pedigrees, others just look at the physical. But with all the horses in the syndicate they have a mixture of both.\n\nNot every horse is a good race horse, so what makes a good race horse?\n\nWill: Mentality. They can move fast but ultimately if they don’t want to do it or don’t have the guts or heart to do it. The mentality and temperament are crucial.\n\nTom: All you have to do is watch any of Aidan O’Brien’s past interviews and when he’s asked about Galileo, the first thing he always says is they’re born with the will to win. That’s why he’s been such a good stallion because his offspring are born with that temperament, they’re tough, they’re gritty and they knuckle down and give it their all. If you have a supremely talented horse that only give it now and then, in lots of ways it’s disappointing because they should win more races. And also training isn’t easy, these horses have to go through a lot in their lives to be a race horse. But so many horses will never see a race track because their mentality doesn’t allow.\n\nWill: Yes, it’s mentality to withstand training as well.\n\nWhen you sell a horse on – do you keep in touch with the new owners and keep track of the horse?\n\nWill: We track everything really. As a breeder, when you register the foal you can register for foal tracking so when it’s named you’ll know. But I also keep in contact with the people I sell to. If you own a broodmare you want to know what’s going on so you know what to keep or sell. But also it’s just good customer relations, I want them to come back again.\n\nTom: Also the BHA now, whenever our horse goes to a trainer there’s a transfer of responsibility so whilst they’re here they’re on TopSpeed’s and Will’s books as we are responsible, when they go to the trainer it transfers to theirs. If we were to ever retire a horse, we have to input that information into the BHA so they are aware of where that horse is going as well as we do. A lot of horses when they retire can go onto a second career if it isn’t as a stallion or broodmare. I retired a horse who is now in a field over the back learning how to do dressage and the girl who is looking after it sent me a video of her training it where it did a little bit then put it’s head down and started eating the grass because it thought it had done enough. Equally, if one of the TopSpeed horses goes to a home and the owner falls on hard times then it will come back here and that will be one of the agreements when we’re doing the vetting so we can find them a new home.\n\nFor people who don’t know what the pin hooking syndicate is, can you explain it a little bit?\n\nWill: Pin hooking is basically buying something and selling it on for a profit. So in our case, we buy foals to sell as 3 year old stores or some 2 year old stores. Or buy a mare out of training and sell her on in foal to something, that’s another form of pin hooking. Then on the flat we will buy foals and sell them as yearlings or 2 year olds. That is fundamentally what pin hooking is. But nothing in life when making money is that easy but we love doing it and we love trying to find these, we are looking for horses we can make a profit on but who can go on to win races.\n\nTom: It’s also the challenge at the sales when you need to find something that other people haven’t seen. You’re trying to find the edge where you can buy a horse for £30,000 instead of £50,000 when you think it’s a £50,000 horse.\n\nWill: You’re trying to imagine how much of a margin is in it to see if it’s worth doing. Ultimately it can be a great pin hook if you can buy a horse for £2,000 and sell it on for £30,000 there’s good profit in that, but buying one for the £20,000 and selling it for £35,000 isn’t such a good pin hook because the cost is the same but you haven’t made as much.\n\nTom: It costs the same to keep a good horse as it does a bad horse. They both need the same.\n\nWill: What I do find interesting is when you do sell a horse, it’s the following the horse and you get enjoyment whether you make money or not because you get joy as you’ve followed the horse from being a foal or a yearling to being 2 or 3 and seeing them be on a racecourse and turning out to run at Cheltenham or wherever. That’s where I get my satisfaction.\n\nTom: From TopSpeed’s point of view, we wanted to do it because it’s a side of racing people never get to see or think about or realise.\n\nSo I am going to leave it right there for part 1, part 2 will be up at 7pm this evening and there we discuss BBC Panorama, should jockeys face a harsher punishment for using the whip too many times, do jockeys lose count when they’re in a race, how Galileo’s death will impact the breeding side of racing, who will become Coolmore’s flagship horse now, Frankel, the O’Brien’s, the Racing League, Thoroughbid and so much more.\n\nSee you in 1 hour, set your alarms so you don’t miss it!\n\nGood Morning!\n\nWelcome to a new post here at zoelouisesmithx.com! On Friday I posted my first post outside of horse racing where I focused on cricket as I wanted to start venturing out to new sports in which I love and when I took a look at the figures I was pleasantly surprised by the number of views that post had. I also received a lot of messages saying they enjoyed my input and I should continue to do more. So that being said I will be posting more about cricket, a little about football and of course plenty of horse racing content too – that will still be my main focus but I do also want to focus on other sports now too because I enjoy sport in general and I love researching, reading, watching and writing all about the sports I love so why not venture out a little more?\n\nWith all of that being said, we are now well into the tournament with every team to have played their first game, so today’s post is a little recap of what we have seen so far up until yesterday’s games, who has stood out to me as well as a look at the current female and male tables before today’s matches. Please note each write up is done as the game ends so they can be as accurate as possible at the time of writing – therefore I may refer to a players form in this tournament during a write up before I have seen their next game – Please bare this in mind when reading. So without further ado, let’s get right into it!\n\nDay 1 – Wednesday 21st July\n\nSo the first game of the tournament, was the ladies teams from Oval Invincibles vs Manchester Originals and I thought it was a very good opening game. Of course we all had no idea what to expect, it was a new concept and we were all learning, but the first game did not disappoint, what a way to start a new tournament. When watching on Sky Cricket, Nasser Hussain said he believed a score of between 150 and 175 would be a good score in this tournament so it would be interesting to see how close to that area the teams would get.\n\nManchester Originals scored 135 off their 100 balls with notable performances from Lizelle Lee opening the batting with 42 off 39 balls including 6 fours, Georgie Boyce coming in 3rd and hitting 21 from 19 balls including 3 fours and Harmanpreet Kaur with 29 from 16 balls including 6 fours. Overall a pretty good score. A notable bowling performance coming from Marizanne Kapp who bowled her full 20 balls with 20 dot balls (no score), 2 wickets and only going for 20 runs as well as Tash Farrant who also bowled her full 20 balls with 10 dot balls taking 3 wickets and only going for 25 runs.\n\nInto the second innings it very much looked like it was Manchester Originals’ game to throw away. With some very early wickets Oval Invincibles found themselves to be 36 for 4 wickets and no chance of coming back. However captain Dané van Niekerk and fellow South African international Marizanne Kapp managed to set up a brilliant partnership taking the team to 109 before Kapp got stumped, finishing her innings with 38 runs from 27 balls including 3 fours and 2 sixes. With only 18 balls left, it was time for Mady Villiers to come into bat and wow did she impress! In the end Oval Invincibles finished with 139 runs from 98 balls beating Manchester Originals. Captain van Niekerk finished on 56 not out from 42 balls including 8 fours and 1 six and Villiers finishing with 16 not out from 8 balls including 1 four and 1 six.\n\nI think it is also important to note some bowlers from the second innings including captain Kate Cross who bowled 18 balls including 7 dot balls for 28 runs with 3 wickets, Laura Jackson who bowled 15 balls, 8 dots, 1 wicket for 16 runs and finally Sophie Ecclestone who bowled 20 balls, 11 dots and 1 wicket only going for 23 runs.\n\nOverall I was very impressed by van Niekerk, I think she captained brilliantly and when her team needed her the most she came out and performed with the bat, I was also impressed by Ecclestone, she kept her cool and bowled extremely well throughout and really put the pressure on, however I was most impressed by Villiers. She bowled well only going for 29 runs from her 20 balls, taking 1 wicket, but then when it looked like her team could be down and out she came out and supported her captain, hitting a couple of boundaries and winning the game for her team and she is only 22, she has a huge, long career ahead of her and I would say she is one to watch in this tournament and beyond.\n\nDay 2 – Thursday 22nd July\n\nSecond day of the tournament and our first men’s game. First into bat were the Oval Invincibles and some performances to note were Jason Roy with 20 from 12 balls, Sam Billings with 49 from 30 balls and Tom Curran with 29 from 18 balls taking their total to 145 runs from 100 balls, slightly more than yesterdays game, again unsure if this would be a chase-able target in this tournament but we would soon find out. Notable bowling performances in the first innings were Tom Hartley who bowled 20 balls, 10 dot balls, 24 runs and taking 2 wickets, Fred Klaassen who bowled 15 balls including 5 dots for 23 runs taking 3 wickets and Steven Finn who bowled 15 balls including 6 dots for 22 runs and 2 wickets.\n\nInto the second innings, some notable performances here are Colin Munro who scored 26 from 22 balls including 3 fours and 2 six, Carlos Brathwaite who scored 37 from 29 including 2 fours and 1 six and Calvin Harrison who scored 23 from 16 balls including 3 fours – but even with those key performances Manchester Originals could only manage to score 136 runs from their 100 balls, laving them 10 short of their target of 146.\n\nSome notable performances – other than his awful no ball in the final 5 balls – Sam Curran who bowled 20 balls with 7 dots for 27 runs taking 2 wickets, Sunil Narine who bowled 20 balls including 8 dots, for 22 runs taking 1 wicket and finally Nathan Sowter who bowled 15 balls including 4 dots for 18 runs and taking 2 wickets.\n\nIn this game I was impressed by Brathwaite – very well known for being to hit a ball very hard, very far and he didn’t disappoint here in the first game, also impressed by Billings, a lovely performance in the middle order to really set his team up to finish with a decent score but my person to watch from this game would be Sam Curran. He opened the batting for the Oval Invincibles and we didn’t really get to see him at his best – He faced 3 balls including 1 six and being bowled so hopefully next game out we see more from him, however he is my one to watch due to his bowling, other than his awful no ball in the final 5 balls I think he bowled very well and he seems to have the perfect yorker that many batsmen can’t get away so he could be a real danger moving forward.\n\nDay 3 – Friday 23rd July\n\nGame 1:\n\nWe then head into day 3 and the first double header of the tournament and my home team – Birmingham Phoenix vs London Spirit in both the women’s competition and the men’s competition.\n\nFirst into bat were Birmingham Phoenix and we seen some brilliant performances from Eve Jones who scored 47 from 41 balls including 9 fours and from captain Amy Jones who scored 33 from 17 balls including 5 fours and 1 six. – Side note: When I played cricket for Warwickshire in my teenage years I played alongside Amy and I absolutely love seeing her doing so well because she was always one of the nicest people you could play with. With some star performances from the two Jones’ Birmingham Phoenix finished up with 128 from 100 balls. One notable bowling performance was from Freya Davies who bowled 20 balls, 8 dots only going for 19 runs for 1 wicket – I believe this was the first bowler in the tournament to go for less runs than balls bowled with 0.95 runs per ball – Very impressive in this sort of game.\n\nInto the second innings some very impressive performances from Naomi Dattani who scored 34 from 19 balls including 4 fours and 1 six, followed by Heather Knight who scored 21 from 17 balls including 3 fours and Deepti Sharma who scored 28 from 24 balls including 3 fours. London Spirit managed to get over the line scoring 132 from 96 balls. Another notable performance with the ball is Erin Burns who bowled 20 balls including 11 dots and only going for 15 runs with 2 wickets, meaning only 0.75 runs per ball – Again very impressive to go for less than a run a ball in this type of game.\n\nHere I was impressed with Eve Jones and Amy Jones – both went out to bat and did extremely well and built a huge partnership of 64 runs and if Amy had not been bowled when she was I think the partnership could have maybe doubles and really built up their score – Amy was a very important wicket for London Spirit. I was also impressed by Davies, again for someone to bowl and be hit for less than a run a ball in this form of cricket is very impressive and not something many bowlers can achieve however my one to watch from this game has to be Burns. She went for 0.75 runs a ball which essentially pro-longed Birmingham’s chances of winning. She took 2 important wickets in Dattani and Sharma and she put pressure on the away team because they just could not score runs from her. I was really impressed by her and I look forward to seeing her throughout this competition.\n\nGame 2:\n\nOnto game 2 of the day and the men’s tournament. I was lucky enough to be invited by the team at Edgbaston to watch today’s games however due to work commitments I could only make the second game and it was an amazing night! The atmosphere was incredible, the game was brilliant and overall I just really enjoyed it with my family.\n\nThe first innings seen London Spirit put into bat and opening batsman Zak Crawley did not disappoint with a huge 64 from 40 balls including 6 fours and 3 sixes with a notable performance from Joe Denly who hit 25 from 14 balls including 1 four and 2 sixes. London Spirit ended up with 144 runs from their 100 balls. A notable bowling performance from Adam Milne who bowled 20 balls, 10 dots, 18 runs and 2 wickets – Another player who went for less runs than balls bowled with 0.90 runs per ball, incredible bowling from him.\n\nInto the second innings Birmingham Phoenix had a couple of notable performances with England T20 superstar Liam Livingstone hitting 19 from 15 balls including 1 four and a massive 6 once again, captain Moeen Ali hitting 40 from 30 balls including 3 fours and 1 six and Chris Benjamin arguable winning the game for us with 24 from 15 balls including 1 four and 2 sixes. Birmingham Phoenix ended up with 148 from 97 balls a pretty impressive win – maybe I’m being biased here. Notable bowling performance from Mohammad Nabi who bowled 20 balls with 7 dots, 20 runs and 1 wicket – a run a ball when you’re on the losing team makes the game a lot closer – the pressure was on Birmingham when they couldn’t score runs against him.\n\nI was impressed by Crawley, he carried his team very early on to a brilliant start and at one point I didn’t think we would ever get him out. Milne was also very impressive, opening the bowling and applying pressure straight away, another one was Liam Livingstone – If you follow my Twitter you would have seen me say I love watching him and he’s slowly becoming my favourite person to watch in limited over games and it’s true – We didn’t see him for very long but in person you really see how hard he can hit a cricket ball and his 6 was very impressive. If he gets in and goes from ball 1 I think any team will be scared of him – also very hard to set a field for because he just goes over them even when you have your fielders on the boundary. I also liked Benjamin, he knew the assignment when he came out to bat and boy did he perform when his team needed him to. However my one to watch is Ali – a brilliant captain – I think he captained extremely well and he carried the team when we needed him to with the bat and he was just very impressive overall.\n\nDay 4 – Saturday 24th July\n\nGame 1:\n\nDay four sees 2 sets of double headers the first being Trent Rockets vs Southern Brave. The first innings seen Southern Brave go into bat. Notable performances include Stefanie Taylor who hit 45 runs from 31 balls including 4 fours and 1 six and Anya Shrubsole who scored 40 runs from 30 balls including 5 fours and 1 six. They ended their innings with 133 from their 100 balls. Notable bowling performances were Sammy-Jo Johnson who bowled 15 balls including 7 dot balls taking 1 wicket and only 13 runs and also Katherine Brunt who bowled 20 balls including 9 dot balls and only 18 runs – No wickets but nonetheless very impressive figures.\n\nInto the second innings, some very impressive batting in the middle order for Trent Rockets including Natalie Sciver who scored 44 from 29 balls including 8 fours and also Heather Graham who scored 24 runs from 17 balls including 4 fours. However even with a couple brilliant performances in the middle order it was not enough to win, with Trent Rockets finishing their 100 balls on 110 runs, 24 short of their target. Notable bowling performances here from Amanda-Jade Wellington who bowled 20 balls including 11 dots and only 10 runs and Anya Shrubsole who bowled 20 balls, including 13 dot balls taking 4 wickets and only 13 runs.\n\nIn this game I was impressed by Stafanie Taylor, with the bat she steadied the middle order after a bit of a dreadful start from her team. I was also impressed by Wellington who went for 0.5 runs a ball which is incredible in this type of game and for her to put so much pressure onto the Trent Rockets it was impressive to see. However my one to watch from this game is definitely Anya Shrubsole. Very impressive with the bat and then to come on to bowl and take 4 wickets for next to no runs she really led the team incredibly and I think she is just so talented honestly.\n\nGame 2:\n\nInto the second game now and for me I think this was the least impressive game so far for me to be honest. The first innings we seen Southern Brave bat and there was only one real notable performance in Ross Whiteley who scored 39 in 29 balls including 3 fours and 2 sixes – I wasn’t too impressed by anyone else here. In 100 balls Southern Brave scored 126 runs. On the other hand one very notable bowling performance is of course Marchant De Lange who took the first five wicket haul in the tournament and what a spell he had. 20 balls, 10 dot balls, 20 runs and 5 wickets – Incredible figures and an incredible performance by him.\n\nInto the Trent Rockets’ innings and D’Arcy Short scored 51 from 41 balls including 5 fours and 1 six and Dawid Malan who scored 62 runs from 43 balls including 7 fours and 2 sixes with them steering their team to victory with 127 runs in 82 balls. Again I wasn’t very impressed by Southern Brave, the target they set wasn’t huge but then they gave away 14 runs in extras. Not really any notable bowling performances either as only 1 wicket was taken and not much else to note.\n\nIf I’m 100 honest I wasn’t impressed by the Southern Brave at all, not really any stand out performances from them from the bat or ball other than Whiteley’s 39 runs to set some sort of target for Trent Rockets. I was impressed by Short and Malan, they both carried their team to victory quite comfortably in the end, very enjoyable to watch them both bat. But my one to watch here is De Lange. His bowling figures were immense and how could you not be impressed by him? If he can bowl like that throughout this whole tournament then he could be a danger to any team.\n\nGame 3:\n\nNext up was the Northern Superchargers vs Welsh Fire in the women’s competition. First innings seen Welsh Fire batting with a notable performance from Hayley Matthews who scored 30 from 20 balls, not many notable performances here. From their 100 balls they hit 130 runs. Interesting that this was the first game of the whole tournament where a team only used 5 bowlers to bowl their 100 balls – completely allowed with each being allowed to bowl 20 but surprisingly the only team to have done so. Notable bowling performances from Linsey Smith who bowled 20 balls, 11 dots, 14 runs taking 3 wickets and also Katie Levick who bowled 20 balls including 11 dots for 16 runs taking 2 wickets. I do also want to mention Liz Russell who I used to play with at Warwickshire when I was younger. She was my captain when I was 12 years old playing up an age group in the under 15’s and I’m so happy to see her doing so well as she really helped me feel comfortable when I was playing up an age group with people I didn’t really know – she bowled 20 balls, with 6 dots, taking 1 wicket for 24 balls.\n\nInto the second Innings and a very impressive 92 from 43 balls including 17 fours and 1 six – not out – from Jemimah Rodrigues for the Northern Superchargers – A slightly bigger run chase and we quite possible would have seen the first century of the tournament – very impressive! Singlehandedly she essentially carried her team to win with 131 runs scored in 85 balls – pretty comfortable win for them. Only real notable mention for the bowling side would be Piepa Cleary who bowled 15 balls, including 10 dot balls, going for 14 runs and taking 1 wicket.\n\nI was impressed by Matthews who essentially carried her team to a respectable score with not many of those around her adding to the total. I was also impressed by Linsey Smith, she took 3 wickets and went for next to no runs in her spell which is a continuous pressure on the batting team if they can’t score from her. However my one to watch has to be Rodrigues with her 92 not out. The highest score in the tournament so far across both the women’s competition and men’s competition which is very impressive. Even when wickets were falling around her she didn’t lose her cool and she continued to play her normal game and she singlehandedly carried home the Northern Superchargers here – very very impressive. You have to feel like after watching her today any team she faces either need to get her out early of try and starve her of the strike and focus on those around her.\n\nGame 4:\n\nGame four of the day I was very much looking forward to with Jonny Bairstow of the Welsh Fire taking on Ben Stokes of the Northern Superchargers in what looked to be a very good game on paper and it did not disappoint!\n\nFirst innings we seen Welsh Fire go into bat with captain Jonny Bairstow getting his team off to a brilliant start with 56 runs from 36 balls including 5 fours and 3 sixes, further down the order seen Ben Duckett score 41 from 27 balls including 6 fours, also Glenn Phillips scoring 23 from 14 balls including 1 four and 2 sixes and then Jimmy Neesham with 30 from 11 balls including 3 fours and 2 sixes. Overall a very impressive team finishing with 173 runs in their 100 balls. Bowling wise Ben Stokes was the most impressive with 10 balls bowled including 5 dot balls, 8 runs and 1 wicket – the wicket being, arguably, the most important one of Bairstow.\n\nWith the biggest run chase of the tournament so far ahead, Northern Superchargers started off okay with Adam Lyth scoring 25 from 14 balls including 4 fours and 1 six, we then see the most impressive innings for the team when 22 year old Harry Brook scored 62 runs in 31 balls including 3 fours and 5 sixes. Unfortunately they finished short with 168 runs from their 100 balls. The biggest notable bowling performance was Qais Ahmad who bowled 20 balls including 8 dots with only 13 runs but a huge 4 wickets.\n\nI was very impressed by Bairstow, he looked pretty solid opening the batting and captaining his team. Also impressed by Neesham who came in and really did just go for it to try and set a huge target and very much succeeded. And of course Ahmad who took 4 wickets and really did put a halt to proceedings when Northern Superchargers looked like they could come close. However my one to watch from this game is Harry Brook. I was very very impressed by his 62 from 31, he looked pretty solid and if he had stayed in I do think he would have carried his team over the line. I really do think he could go on to push his team over the line in future games in this tournament.\n\nSo there we have it, every teams first game of the tournament. So what do the tables look like at this point? (As per the official #TheHundred app)\n\nWomen:\n\nMen:\n\nOnly one game in for each team so of course everything is still to play for and hopefully it’ll be a close competition with no runaway leaders.\n\nAs I said in my previous post about #TheHundred I think it’s a pretty good tournament and I have been really impressed with the majority of the games I have seen so far. The only thing I really do not like or agree with is the fact that the ECB (England and Wales Cricket Board) have thrown in a test match series England vs India in the middle of it so if players are selected in the squad for that then you can only play in the first two games of the tournament. For me if the ECB want this new tournament to work then surely the best players i.e. England players should be available to play the whole time? Really not something I like about this whole thing. That being said, I am still looking forward to it, I just believe the ECB should have supported the initiative by not putting England commitments right in the middle of it.\n\nHave you been watching? If so who are you supporting? Who’s impressed you so far? Tweet me your opinions!\n\nI will see you all Wednesday evening for a brand new horse racing history story and it is a super interesting one!\n\nGood Morning!\n\nWelcome to a new post here at zoelouisesmithx.com! Ahead of today’s renewal of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes let’s take a look at the history of the race, some records in the race and a little look at today’s runners. Let’s get right into it!\n\nThe King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes is a Group 1 flat race which was inaugurated in 1951. The race is open to horses aged three and older. It is ran at Ascot racecourse in England over a distance of 1 mile, 3 furlongs and 211 yards and takes place in July each year. In 2020 the race was worth £400,000 with the winner receiving £226,840.\n\nThe race was formed as a result of an amalgamation of two separate races at Ascot, the first being the King George VI which was a 2 mile contest for three year olds held in October and the second being the Queen Elizabeth in honour of his wife which was a one and a half mile contest over one and a half miles held in July. The idea was raised by Major John Crocker Bulteel who was the Clerk of the Course at Ascot, who wanted to create an international race over one and a half miles for horses aged 3 or older. So the first ever run took place on July 21st in 1951.\n\nIn 2009, Betfair started to sponsor the race and its prize fund was increased from £750,000 to £1,000,000 and is now Britain’s second richest horse race, with a purse exceeded only by The Derby.\n\nIn 2011, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes became part of the Breeders’ Cup Challenge Series, so the winner now earns an automatic invitation to compete in the same year’s Breeders’ Cup Turf.\n\nSo let’s take a look at some of the previous winners!\n\nThe first winner in 1951 was 3 year old Supreme Court who won for jockey Charlie Elliott, trainer Evan Williams and owner Vera Lilley.\n\nSkipping forward 5 years, in 1956 Ribot – who I wrote about in this post: https://zoelouisesmithx.com/2021/05/19/ten-undefeated-racehorses/ won the race at 4 years old for jockey Enrico Camici, trainer Ugo Penco and owner Mario della Rocchetta.\n\nSkipping forward again, in 1970 Nijinsky won at 3 years old for Lester Piggott, Vincent O’Brien and Charles Engelhard, with 3 year old Mill Reef winning in 1971 for Geoff Lewis, Ian Balding and Paul Mellon. In 1973 and 1974 Dahlia won the race at 3 and 4 years old respectively for trainer Maurice Zilber and owner Nelson Bunker Hunt with Bill Pyers riding in 1973 and Lester Piggott in 1974.\n\nSkipping forward again, in 1981 the brilliant Shergar won the race at 3 years old for Walter Swinburn, (Sir) Michael Stoute and HH Aga Khan IV. Skipping to 1997 and 1998 now where Swain won the race for trainer Saeed bin Suroor and owners Godolphin, in 1997 at 5 years old for jockey John Reid and in 1998 at 6 years old (one of two horses to win this at 6 years old) for Frankie Dettori.\n\nIn 2001, the late, great Galileo won the race at 3 years old under Michael Kinane for Aidan O’Brien and Magnier / Tabor. In 2011 Nathaniel won at 3 years old for William Buick, John Gosden and Lady Rothschild. In 2015 Postponed won at 4 years old for Andrea Atzeni, Luca Cumani and Mohammed Obaid Al Maktoum.\n\nIn 2016 Highland Reel won at 4 years old for Ryan Moore, Aidan O’Brien and Magnier / Tabor / Smith. In 2017, 2019 and 2020 Enable won the race at 3, 5 and 6 years old (second of two to win this race at 6 years old) for Frankie Dettori, John Gosden and Khalid Abdullah. In the middle in 2018 Poet’s Word won at 5 years old for James Doyle, (Sir) Michael Stoute and Saeed Suhail.\n\nSo now onto some records in the race.\n\nFirstly the oldest horse to win this race is joint between Swain and Enable who were both 6 years old when winning the race.\n\nThe most successful horse with 3 victories is Enable who won in 2017, 2019 and 2020.\n\nThe are two leading jockeys in the race both with 7 victories. Firstly Lester Piggott who won with Meadow Court (1965), Aunt Edith (1966), Park Top (1969), Nijinsky (1970), Dahlia (1974), The Minstrel (1977) and Teenoso (1984). And secondly Frankie Dettori who has won with Lammtarra (1995), Swain (1998), Daylami (1999), Doyen (2004) and Enable (2017, 2019, 2020).\n\nThe leading trainer with 6 victories is Sir Michael Stoute with Shergar (1981), Opera House (1993), Golan (2002), Conduit (2009), Harbinger (2010) and Poet’s Word (2018).\n\nThe leading owner, including part ownership, with 6 wins is Michael Tabor with Montjeu (2000), Galileo (2001), Hurricane Run (2006), Dylan Thomas (2007), Duke of Marmalade (2008) and Highland Reel (2016).\n\nNow onto this years runners… Please not all odds are via Ladbrokes and are correct at the time of writing this post. (11pm on Thursday 22nd July 2021)\n\nOf course we have the 5/4 favourite Love for Aidan O’Brien and Ryan Moore and I think she will be my pick this weekend. I think she’s a very impressive horse and has won over course and distance. I know Ryan can get into some questionable positions sometimes but I think Love is good enough to get him out of a tricky situation. She hasn’t lost a race since October 2019, winning the 1,000 Guineas, Oaks, Yorkshire Oaks and Prince of Wales’s since then. I really like the look of her and I, personally, will find it hard to bet against her.\n\nAlthough, saying that this is a really competitive race. There are only 6 horses declared but between them they have won 11 Group 1’s and 4 Classics, so a very impressive line up and it should be a brilliant, competitive race, so let’s take a look at the other 5 runners.\n\nLining up alongside Love we have 9/4 shot Adayar for Charlie Appleby and William Buick. He’s ran the distance before and won The Derby just last month, so again another classy horse. Possibly more to offer after his Derby win and William Buick seems to be in good form also so I wouldn’t be surprised if he came close here.\n\nNext up we have Lone Eagle for Martyn Meade and Frankie Dettori – currently a 5/1 shot. He came second by just a neck in the Irish Derby just a month or so ago clear of the 3rd placed horse. Again another horse you can’t rule out and Frankie Dettori has a habit of coming to the forefront in the big races so with him taking the ride anything is possible here.\n\nWe then have Mishriff for John & Thady Gosden and David Egan – currently around the 8/1 mark. Mishriff was very impressive the beginning of the year when winning the Saudi Cup and a Group 1 in Meydan and when returning to the UK he finished 3rd just a neck from Addeybb in the Coral Eclipse. Again not a horse we can rule out here, maybe 8/1 is a big price for a horse that could go very well here. He has won over this distance before, the big occasion won’t affect him at all and he and David seem to have a pretty good relationship so maybe one to watch.\n\nWe then have the 11/1 shot Wonderful Tonight for David Menuisier and Oisin Murphy. She has won course and distance before, winning 5 out of 9 races she has had in her career. Interestingly William Buick has rode her the last two times out, in which she won both, but here Champion Jockey Oisin Murphy takes the ride. Now Oisin is in top form lately and he cannot be ruled out whichever horse he rides. Is she as good as some of the others in this race? Maybe not. Could she still win here though if everything goes in her favour? Absolutely.\n\nThe final horse in the race is of course another Aidan O’Brien horse. Would this even be a Group 1 without multiple Aidan O’Brien horses? We have Broome at 28/1 under Wayne Lordan. For me 28/1 seems a big price, the second string horse for Aidan O’Brien but by no means a bad horse at all. Broome seems to have been around forever hasn’t he? Pretty impressive career so far and I don’t feel like he’s quite finished winning just yet. There are definitely better horses in the race here, but I definitely couldn’t rule him out. He won last time out in France over a very slightly longer distance of 1 mile 4 furlongs and he could very well win again here.\n\nFor me any of the 6 could win this race, they are all extremely talented horses and not one of them can be ruled out, however I am personally going with Love. I really do love her as a horse and I think she will show, once again, just how good she is. I couldn’t back against her, however any of the other 5 could win. It looks to be an absolutely brilliant renewal this year and one thing is for sure… If the running is as competitive as it looks on paper then we’re in for a very exciting race.\n\nThis years renewal looks to be an absolute cracker and I can’t wait to see who comes out on top. I will see you all Wednesday evening at 6pm for my last scheduled midweek post. If you did not see my previous post last weekend, from August I will only be doing 1 scheduled definite post on a Saturday and some extras throughout but not a guaranteed post every Wednesday as my current schedule just does not allow me the time to get two posts I am happy with up each week without burning myself out.\n\nGood Evening!\n\nWelcome to a new post here at zoelouisesmithx.com! Today’s post is very different to my regular horse racing posts, but we all love a little bit of variety right?\n\nSo as we are all aware by now, the new cricket tournament #TheHundred has kicked off and it is being heavily spoken about all over the country by cricket lovers and cricket haters. Now if you seen my Twitter this week you’ll have seen I used to play cricket myself for Warwickshire, I was the first 12 year old to hit a century as well as in my final season playing I finished the top bowler in the whole country and watching the England vs Pakistan T20 series really made me miss playing and then now with #TheHundred I am definitely missing it. So I thought as a cricket lover and ex player why not have a little look at the new tournament.\n\nPersonally I think it’s brilliant when a sport comes out with new and exciting concepts to attract a wider audience. Many people have a negative concept of cricket, with many saying it’s a boring sport, however in more recent times we have a lot of people slowly changing their mind thanks to the likes of Ben Stokes and his antics and in the recent T20’s Liam Livingstone. So a new, exciting concept may just help to change more opinions.\n\nSo what is #TheHundred? Essentially it is normal cricket… but different. 100 balls, 5 or 10 per turn from a bowler – this decision is down to the captain, however each player can only bowl 20 balls per game and no matter what after 10 balls the teams swap ends. If someone is caught out, even if the batsmen cross the new batsman faces the next ball. Each team has 1 review and the power play is the first 25 balls of each inning. Essentially a power play means the fielding team can only have 2 players outside of the inner circle – once the power play ends they can have an additional 3 for the men meaning 5 are allowed outside of the inner circle and 2 for the women meaning 4 are allowed outside of the inner circle. However the fielding team is only given 1 hour and 5 minutes to bowl their 100 balls, if they are not into their last 5 balls when that 1 hour and 5 minutes hits then the team have to bring a player into the inner circle. Another new change is that the fielding team can call a 2 minute time out, this is to be called by the captain and here the coach can come onto the pitch and discuss tactics with the team. Only 1 can be called and it can be called at any point in the 100 balls.\n\nEssentially 2 points are awarded for a win, 1 point for a tie or no result and 0 points for a loss. The team who finishes at the top of the group will go straight into the final with the second and third placed teams playing an eliminator match to reach the final.\n\nSo who are the teams? We have Birmingham Phoenix playing out of Edgbaston in Birmingham, London Spirit playing out of Lords in London, Manchester Originals playing at Old Trafford in Manchester, Northern Superchargers playing out of Headingly in Leeds, Oval Invincibles playing out of the Oval in London, Southern Brave playing out of the Ageas Bowl in Southampton, Trent Rockets playing out of Trent Bridge in Nottingham and finally Welsh Fire playing out of Sophia Gardens in Cardiff.\n\nThere is a male tournament and a female tournament with most being double headers when you attend, so if you buy tickets you get to see both games, which I think is great!\n\nSo what do I think? As a female who used to play cricket I think it’s brilliant for the women’s game. On Wednesday evening, they allowed the women to open the tournament in a stand alone game – no male game after. And I thought that was brilliant to see because the female game has never been taken as serious as the men. And across BBC 2, Sky Sports Cricket, Main Event and Mix there was a peak audience of 1.95 million with a huge 3.8 million in total. Now for me those figures are ridiculous. It is the most watched female game of cricket in the UK for domestic and international. Never in my life time did I think I’d see the day where a women’s game has that sort of audience.\n\nI love cricket and I think #TheHundred is a brilliant concept. There’s been a one male and one female game so far and I’ve found myself really enjoying them. Tonight I have actually been invited by Warwickshire to Edgbaston to watch Birmingham Phoenix take on London Spirit. Unfortunately I was working today so I couldn’t make the ladies game this afternoon but I’m grateful I get to witness the men’s game tonight and I have also been invited to Edgbaston again by Warwickshire – thank you so much to their behind the scenes team for the invite for myself and my family – on August 4th for the male and female game. So if you see me there come and say hi!\n\nI’m actually really happy that a regular channel like BBC have got behind this concept, it means a lot more people have access to the game now opposed to it only being shown on paid TV channels. I have heard – do not quote me on this as no official sources have announced it – but BBC have apparently got a contract with #TheHundred until 2024. Which, if true, is brilliant for the game!\n\nI like the concept so far, I think it’s brilliant, it’s fresh and it has done what it was supposed to do by attracting a wider, newer audience so you can’t complain with that at all. After a rough 18 months for absolutely everybody it is brilliant seeing a full crowd able to watch live sport at an affordable price, world class players and games all up and down the country so everybody can get to a local-ish stadium to watch. I also love shorter cricket games, for me personally I have always loved the shorter game over a test match for example – please don’t judge me if you are more traditional. The T20 series are brilliant and #TheHundred is very much similar to that, it’s a little shorter, a few different rules but still very much entertaining and they have managed to get some of the biggest players in the world involved so we are definitely going to have an entertaining few weeks of cricket!\n\nWhat I will say is if you are reading this and you’ve never watched cricket then do give this new tournament a watch and you might find yourself enjoying it!\n\nOf course not everybody is going to like this new format, I completely understand that, but I believe people should be giving it a chance before judging it so harshly. We’ve had 2 games, mega crowds, plenty of people watching at home and both games we’ve seen so far have been brilliant games going right to the wire and that’s what cricket is all about in my opinion.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I was sceptical before it started, I didn’t really understand how it would work or if it would work, but now they have took the time on both BBC, Sky etc to explain the rules and differences to regular cricket I have really got into it.\n\nThe only negative thing I do want to mention the fact that not every game is available on BBC Two which is disappointing. If their aim is to gain a new audience surely they should broadcast every game so people can really follow their team and follow the group stages and see who is where. Not a huge deal but just something I thought I’d mention.\n\nIf you have watched it let me know what you think, if you haven’t then do consider watching a game and seeing what you think. Also please do not only watch the men’s games; the women are super talented and the opening game was such an entertaining one. There are some amazing women in the tournament so give it and them a chance.\n\nThat being said that is it for today’s extra midweek post. I know it’s different to my regular posts but I do want to get more into sharing other sports and other interests I have. I started my website so I could write about things I love and cricket is something I love so I thought I would share. This may become a more regular thing as I have recently re-found my love for other sports and want to share my knowledge and opinions! Let me know what else you’d all like to see – if anything in particular whether it be racing, cricket, football – anything sport related!\n\nI will see you all tomorrow morning at 11am for my regular horse racing update!"
