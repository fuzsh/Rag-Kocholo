        "text": "Lockinge hero Audience got back on the winning trail with a dominant display in the HKJC World Pool Lennox Stakes at Goodwood.\n\nJohn and Thady Gosden’s charge was a shock winner of the first Group One of the season at Newbury, where he made every yard of the running to upstage his fellow Cheveley Park-owned stablemate Inspiral.\n\nHaving since finished fifth in the Queen Anne at Royal Ascot, the five-year-old was eased in grade and distance for this seven-furlong Group Two and was visually impressive in the hands of Robert Havlin.\n\nIn a race in which only two horses were ever really in contention, 4-1 shot Audience sat in the slipstream of the pacesetting Art Power before being unleashed entering the final furlong and the race was soon over as a contest as Havlin’s mount sprinted four lengths clear.\n\nArt Power boxed on to fill the runner-up spot, with 7-2 favourite Kinross – bidding for his third victory in the race following previous triumphs in 2021 and 2023 – making late headway to finish third.\n\nOf the winner, Havlin said: “After he won the Lockinge, I told everyone it was no fluke and they laughed.\n\n“He’s always had a lot of ability. We used to ride him without the hood on but I sat on him on Saturday and he absolutely flew so we thought this was the right time to try him without it.\n\n“He wasn’t very competitive in the Lennox round here last year (finished sixth) but, with the hood off, it really sharpened him up. He’s so controllable now, as well.\n\n“I didn’t think we were going overly quick up the hill but I let him go at the three (furlong marker) and by God, he was fast.”\n\nAudience now looks set to stick at the seven-furlong distance for the City of York Stakes on the Knavesmire next month. Paddy Power cut his odds for that lucrative prize to 7-2 from 12-1.\n\n“Plainly he didn’t quite stay the stiff mile at Ascot,” said Cheveley Park’s managing director Chris Richardson.\n\n“We’ve stuck with Rab (Havlin) the whole way through and the horse continues to thrive and they have a great relationship.\n\n“I was thrilled that Pat Thompson was there at Newbury when he won and I’m sorry that they are not here today, but defying a penalty has certainly given everyone plenty to think about.\n\n“We’ll probably go to York for the City Of York Stakes, where he doesn’t carry a penalty, then it’s all to play for. We’ll look at all those races over his favoured seven furlongs.”\n\nJohn Gosden added: “He’s matured and the mile’s too stiff at Ascot. He’ll go to the City Of York, he was second in it last year to Kinross. He’ll go there, no penalty. That’s the plan.\n\n“We’ve put him in the Prix de la Foret, last year’s ground would be perfect as it was good to firm. He wouldn’t want traditional Parisian turf.\n\n“He has the speed for a race like the Breeders’ Cup Mile at Del Mar. He could be a horse for it. Travelling would be no problem.\n\n“Rab knows him really well. He rides him most mornings and every time he nearly takes him home!”\n\nTim Easterby was proud of the performance of the admirable Art Power, saying: “He’s wonderful. He’s a pony, but he’s wonderful and tries like hell.\n\n“He’s got an unbelievable temperament. We thought he’d run well. We wanted to run him over a fast seven somewhere; he ran well at York over seven.\n\n“If it had been softer, it would have been better, but he goes on any ground.\n\n“We want to go for the big race at Ascot in October (Qipco British Champions Sprint), but where we go before then, I don’t know. We’ll get him back home first. But he’s a wonderful horse.”\n\nStaged at Ascot racecourse, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes is run over a distance of 1m4f and is generally regarded as Britain’s most prestigious all-aged flat horse race.\n\nWith over £600,000 up for grabs for the winner the it goes without saying the race always attracts horses from the best yards around the country with Sir Michael Stoute and Saeed Bin Suroor, who have won the King George six and five times, are the trainers with the best recent record in the contest, while the powerful Aidan O’Brien yard have won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes four times. Don’t forget the John Gosden yard either – they’ve won the race 3 times in the last 8 years.\n\n12 months ago, in 2023, we saw the Owen Burrows-trained Hukum win the race in a tight battle with Westover. Hukum became only the third 6 year-old win win the King George since 1951.\n\nHere at GeeGeez, we take a look back at the recent winners of the race and gives you the key trends to look out for ahead of the 2024 renewal – this year run on Saturday 27th July.\n\nRecent King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes Winners\n\n2023 - Hukum (13/2)\n\n2022 – Pyledriver (18/1)\n\n2021 - Adayar (9/4)\n\n2020 – Enable (4/9 fav)\n\n2019 – Enable (8/15 fav)\n\n2018 – Poet’s Word (7/4)\n\n2017 – Enable (5/4 fav)\n\n2016 – Highland Reel (13/8 fav)\n\n2015 – Postponed (6/1)\n\n2014 – Taghrooda (7/2)\n\n2013 – Novellist (13/2)\n\n2012 – Danedream (9/1)\n\n2011 – Nathaniel (11/2)\n\n2010 – Harbinger (4/1)\n\n2009 – Conduit (13/8 fav)\n\n2008 – Duke of Marmalade (4/6 fav)\n\n2007 – Dylan Thomas (5/4 fav)\n\n2006 – Hurricane Run (5/6 fav)\n\n2005 – Azamour (5/2 fav)\n\n2004 – Doyen (11/10 fav)\n\n2003 – Alamshar (13/2)\n\n2002 – Golan (11/2)\n\nKing George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes Trends\n\n22/22 – Previous Group 1 or 2 winners\n\n20/22 – Had won over 1m4f before\n\n19/22 – Placed last time out\n\n18/22 – Had 2 or more runs already that season\n\n18/22 – Returned 13/2 or shorter in the betting\n\n18/22 – Previous Group 1 winner\n\n17/22 – Aged 3 or 4 years-old\n\n14/22 – Had run Ascot before\n\n13/22 – Won their previous race\n\n12/22 – Aged 4 years-old\n\n10/22 – Favourites that won\n\n10/22 – Won at Ascot before\n\n8/22 – Ran at Royal Ascot last time out\n\n5/22 – Trained by John Gosden\n\n4/22 – Trained by Sir Michael Stoute\n\n3/22 – Trained by Aidan O’Brien\n\nJust three 6+ year-old winners since 1951\n\nFrankie Dettori has ridden the winner in 1995, 1998, 1999, 2004, 2017, 2019 and 2020\n\n2 of the last 9 winners were that season’s Epsom Oaks winner\n\nAdayar (2021) and Galileo (2001) were the last horses to do the Derby/King George double in the same season\n\nTrainer John Gosden won the race in 2011, 2014, 2017, 2019 & 2020\n\nTrainer Sir Michael Stoute won the race in 1981, 1983, 2002, 2009, 2010 & 2018\n\nTrainer Saeed Bin Suroor won the race in 1995, 1997, 1998, 1999 & 2004\n\nTrainer Aidan O’Brien won the race in 2001, 2007, 2008 & 2016\n\nThe average winning SP in the last 22 runnings is 4/1\n\n================================================\n\nTRAINERS-QUOTES.COM\n\nGET THE BEST DAILY TRAINER INFO FROM 13 TOP STABLES - Sent direct to your in-box!\n\n**SPECIAL OFFER** TRY US FOR JUST £1.99!!\n\nFIND OUT MORE HERE\n\n==================================================\n\nAll options are open for Inspiral as connections look to get their star mare back on track following two below-par efforts so far this season.\n\nThe daughter of Frankel has carried the Cheveley Park Stud colours to six Group One victories over the course of the past three years, perhaps most notably claiming a thrilling victory at last year’s Breeders’ Cup under an inspired Frankie Dettori ride when stepped up to a mile and a quarter.\n\nAfter being upstaged by her lesser-fancied Cheveley Park-owned stablemate Audience on her reappearance over a mile in the Lockinge at Newbury, the five-year-old was stepped back up in trip for the Prince of Wales’s Stakes at Royal Ascot, but not for the first time Inspiral missed the break and she ultimately finished well beaten in sixth behind Auguste Rodin.\n\nCheveley Park’s managing director Chris Richardson is not ruling out the possibility of the five-year-old running over a mile and a quarter again under different circumstances, but races back at a mile will also be considered.\n\nReflecting on her Ascot run, he said: “She was slowly away again unfortunately and then of course she was long way back and they turned it into a real test of stamina.\n\n“It was plainly obvious when she came into the straight and made her short-lived burst that we weren’t going to be troubling the winner.\n\n“Hindsight is a wonderful thing. Everyone has been pushing to try her over a mile and a quarter, but maybe, with hindsight, we should have run in the Queen Anne.\n\n“I haven’t caught up with John (Gosden) yet, but she’s come out of the race fine and all options are open. She’s in the Nassau, she’s in the Jacques le Marois and the Sussex and all the right races.\n\n“We don’t really want to rush her back so we didn’t put her in the Falmouth as we didn’t see any point in trying to rush her back for the July meeting.\n\n“We’ll consider all the options and ground conditions and see where we end up.”\n\nThe decision to run Inspiral in the Prince of Wales’s allowed Audience to line up as Cheveley Park’s chief hope in the Queen Anne, but the front-running tactics that worked so well in the Lockinge were not so effective in Berkshire as he weakened into fifth behind Charyn.\n\nRichardson added: “They were never going to give him an easy lead and he probably just didn’t quite get home over the mile there.\n\n“He’s in the Lennox and the Sussex at Goodwood. He’s come out of it fine so we’ll make a decision where we go nearer the time.”\n\nIt takes two horses to make a great horse race and while the roles were reversed from Champions Day, John Gosden felt Trawlerman lost little in defeat behind Kyprios in the Gold Cup.\n\nWith Frankie Dettori, the man credited with a great ride that momentous day in October, when he was supposedly riding for the last time, up in the stands watching on during his hiatus from his current base in America, it was William Buick in the saddle.\n\nIn the absence of Trueshan due to the fast ground for the fourth successive year, Buick decided to set his own fractions and he so nearly got it spot on.\n\nHe was allowed to do his own thing until Caius Chorister took off with Benoit de la Sayette and shot up on his outside – but that may have worked in his favour, as it forced Ryan Moore to go wider on the eventual winner.\n\nIt was a ding-dong battle up the Ascot straight again between the pair, but on much quicker ground than in the autumn, this time it was Aidan O’Brien’s Kyprios who prevailed, becoming just the third horse in the race’s long history to regain the Gold Cup.\n\n“Once Trueshan came out of the race, it was pretty obvious we were going to have to make our own pace, so William decided to set our own rhythm, he doesn’t like a sprint,” said Gosden, who trains Trawlerman in partnership with his son, Thady.\n\n“It was a wonderful race, he cruised round, then Kyprios came, they fought and then Kyprios gets in front and then he did what he did to Kyprios in the autumn when he won by a neck, he came back.\n\n“This time, on the faster ground, Ryan had time to go again and he went and won fair and square, but it was a proper duel between the two of them, they are lovely stayers.\n\n“We’ll probably all meet in the Goodwood Cup, that will be a likely scenario.”\n\nSweet William, also trained by the Gosdens, came from the clouds to claim third under Robert Havlin, five lengths behind his stablemate.\n\nGosden added: “The third horse, Sweet William, has run a blinder, he’d won the Henry II at Sandown and has come on again to grab third. He’s got the stamina. If they could extend the trip to two-and-three-quarters like the Queen Alexandra, that will suit him even better!\n\n“Second and third is great, they are great horses.”\n\nPhilippa Cooper, owner of Sweet William, said: “I’m just so pleased. He had five screws in as a two-year-old, it has been well documented and it’s been a long journey.\n\n“For him to do this on ground that is very, very fast is unbelievable, I’m just so proud of him – so, so proud of him.\n\n“You would think I had won the race and not come third. But I’ve just come third in a Gold Cup.\n\n“Rab (Havlin) said he is improving and who knows, if he stays sound, he could be back. It was very, very special.”\n\nBack in fourth was the Willie Mullins-trained 2022 Triumph Hurdle winner Vauban under Colin Keane, who briefly looked a huge threat.\n\nOwner Rich Ricci is now eyeing another crack at Melbourne Cup glory and said: “It’s a wonderful experience to have a runner here in the big race.\n\n“It’s clear to everybody now he didn’t stay. He came to win the race and I was getting jiggy when I was listening to the race and I heard them turn for home. He was right in the mix and I turned round to watch and his run just petered out.\n\n“That’s fine and Melbourne is still the plan. It’s great to have a runner here and it is such a great occasion and great day and if you had told me I would have a better chance of winning the Ascot Gold Cup over the Cheltenham Gold Cup, which I did this year, I would tell you you were mad.\n\n“But with that being said, Australia is still the plan and I would love to win the Melbourne Cup – and our friends from Victoria Racing are here.\n\n“We’ll probably run somewhere again in the summer, then we’ll be ready to rock and roll I think.”\n\nJohn Gosden felt that tackling a stiff 10 furlongs off a fast pace proved too much for Inspiral to cope with after she could only manage sixth place behind Auguste Rodin in the Prince of Wales’s Stakes.\n\nThe five-year-old mare was making her third trip to Royal Ascot, having won the 2022 Coronation Stakes before going down by just a neck when second in last season’s Queen Anne, both over a mile.\n\nWith Inspiral subsequently claiming victory in the Breeders’ Cup Filly & Mare Turf over an extra two furlongs at Santa Anita in November, connections opted to try their luck at that trip again, but what was a brave move to be applauded ultimately backfired.\n\nGosden told Sky Sports Racing: “She was pretty slowly away, sitting at the back of the field. They’ve gone very, very hard and I think, quite frankly, over the (stiff) mile and a quarter here, she’s just been caught out for stamina.\n\n“She’s won Group Ones over a mile and over a very easy mile and a quarter at Santa Anita and I think stamina-wise, she just got caught today. She came with a run and the last furlong was too far for her.\n\n“A Derby winner has won it, he’s got the trip well and shown a lot of grit at the end.”\n\nWith Inspiral faltering, it was left to French raiders Zarakem and Horizon Dore to ensure Auguste Rodin had to pull out all the stops.\n\nZarakem kept on well to finish second at 33-1, losing out by three-quarters of a length, and his handler Jerome Reynier was more than pleased with that performance.\n\nHe said: “I am very happy with him. On his reappearance this year, he won a Group Two on heavy ground, and today he’s been second in a very hot race at Royal Ascot in a Group One on firm ground, so he can do everything.\n\n“He’s a very complete athlete; he’s improving with age, mentally and physically. He’s entered in the Arc at the end of the year, because he does Longchamp so well and he seems to have plenty of stamina, because he ran on today and he’s been chasing up Auguste Rodin to the post.\n\n“For Zarakem, this was his first time abroad and a very interesting first time out of France, so it opens many, many doors, and we’ll see if we’ll be back for the King George in a few weeks’ time. We will see – we don’t want to rush him and we can keep the Arc as a final target for the year.\n\n“You see the improvement in him month after month – he’s really improving mentally and I think that was the right time to test him outside of France in a very hot race like that.”\n\nHorizon Dore followed up his third-place finish in last year’s Champion Stakes at Ascot by picking up another bronze medal.\n\nPatrice Cottier said: “We are very pleased with the performance. He showed again he is a Group One horse and we are very happy.\n\n“We will see the plan for the second half of the season, but maybe it will be the Champion Stakes. He’s an easy horse, more and more macho with age – he’s a super horse.”\n\nRunning Lion saw off the late surge of stablemate Laurel to secure top honours in the Duke Of Cambridge Stakes at Royal Ascot.\n\nSo impressive when winning Newmarket’s Pretty Polly Stakes in the early part of last season, Running Lion had failed to get her head in front since and finished a disappointing last of eight on her most recent outing in the Princess Elizabeth Stakes on Derby day at Epsom.\n\nOisin Murphy’s mount was a 6-1 shot to get her campaign back on track over Ascot’s round mile and did so in some style, controlling affairs from the front under a well-judged ride and finding plenty for pressure in the straight to score readily by two lengths.\n\nLaurel came from further back to make it a one-two for the father-son training partnership of John and Thady Gosden. Connections will rightly take plenty of heart from her performance, given she had been off the track since failing to fire in the Lockinge at Newbury over a year ago.\n\nJohn Gosden said: “This filly has been unlucky. She moved a bit soon in the Dahlia Stakes at Newmarket, gets boxed in at Epsom. We did decide ‘third time, Oisin, do what you want’. He’s drawn 11, go to the front, control it. It was perfect, because we got in a muddle in the last two races.\n\n“She got heatstroke in the Diane, kicked the gates out at Epsom, was third in the Guineas. She hasn’t always been lucky.”\n\nMurphy added: “Obviously at Epsom she broke well, I didn’t want to lead because she did too much in front at Newmarket and wasted too much energy and we had a hard luck story.\n\n“Today, I had to have a bit of confidence to go out and do my own thing. When she broke well and she pricked her ears, I was happy to lead, and when she saved energy like that, she was always going to be hard to pass.\n\n“I got a breather into her all the way through the turn, today I had the horse to do that. The freshness is out of her and she took the prelims.\n\n“It’s great because David Howden bred her. He’s an official sponsor here, along with Qipco, he’s important, vital to British racing and he’s been rewarded this afternoon.”\n\nOwner Howden said: “She gets her head down, she changes her legs and she digs in. Her sire, Roaring Lion, won his races exactly the same way.\n\n“We’re partners with Royal Ascot, I bred her, she’s out of Roaring Lion, who tragically died, it couldn’t be more special.\n\n“For Oisin to do it on Roaring Lion’s filly, Running Lion, is as good as it gets.\n\n“We always knew she had it in her, ever since she won the Pretty Polly and left them standing. We knew it was there. This is why we do it, it’s just fantastic.”\n\nAs regards game runner-up Laurel, Barry Mahon, European racing manager for owners Juddmonte, commented: “It’s absolutely marvellous and we’re over the moon.\n\n“Ryan said the winner just shifted a bit in front and cost us a bit of momentum but I think we were booked for second at that stage.\n\n“If she comes out of it well, we will have a look at the Falmouth. This was only her sixth run, for a five-year-old. She does have her issues, but she’s training great and is loving life. She’s having a good blow, so is going to tighten up, so we will aim for the Falmouth and see how we go.\n\n“She’s been knocking on the door and has been placed in a Group One. Ryan knows her and won on her at Kempton and loves her and hopefully she will get it done on the Group One stage someday.”\n\nTrainer William Haggas said of third-placed Doom: “It was an excellent run and she got a bit of a knock on the turn, which knocked her off her stride, but she stayed on well.\n\n“She certainly gets the trip well and handles the ground well and that gives us many more options.”\n\nWhen asked about a possible step up to Group One level for the Falmouth Stakes, Haggas added: “I’m not sure yet, we will see, but she is in it. I’m delighted with today’s performance.”\n\nThere was a time when Stradivarius would be the headline attraction in the week of Royal Ascot. But the three-time Gold Cup hero in the hands of Frankie Dettori is now centre of attention in his new home at the National Stud, as he thrives in his second career as a stallion.\n\nThe son of Sea The Stars won at the Royal meeting for four straight years between 2017 and 2020, as he amassed almost £3.5million in prize-money and a European record 18 Group-level wins during a stellar stint on the racecourse.\n\nBjorn Nielsen’s exceptional stayer was expertly handled by firstly John Gosden and then in conjunction with his son Thady during his decorated on-track career, but now it is the team at the National Stud who are central to the next phase of the 10-year-old’s life, overseeing the transition from champion racehorse to star stallion.\n\nThe National Stud also stands well-known names such as ex-Ballydoyle performer Lope Y Fernandez, Coventry Stakes hero Rajasinghe, Time Test and its newest recruit Mutasaabeq.\n\nHowever, just like in his racing career, there is one horse who rules the roost in this tranquil part of Newmarket, with Stradivarius making himself right at home from the moment he left Clarehaven.\n\n“He’s doing brilliantly and it takes any stallion some time to get used to their new surroundings, new routine, new job, but he’s very much into his routine now and is a very happy horse, which is very important,” said Joe Bradley, Head of Bloodstock at the National Stud.\n\n“He loves his job and loves living here and enjoys the attention. I couldn’t have been happier with how the transition went.\n\n“He is down in the same area as the four other stallions and he definitely likes to think he’s the boss. He definitely has an aura and presence around him and I think you can only tell that when you are around him.\n\n“He has a massive personality and is first out onto the walker, first out into the paddock, first into the shed – and we do that to make sure he is happy, which he is.”\n\nBradley is the man trusted in ensuring Stradivarius receives the support his racing CV deserves and having covered 120 mares in his first season – including the likes of Park Hill Stakes winner Gretchen – there are encouraging signs that he will find his place in a competitive market.\n\n“He’s now into his second season and there are two strands to Strad,” explained Bradley.\n\n“There’s the public side, where he is loved by more people than I ever believed would be that passionate about a horse like this, so he has been great in that regard and the interest in him from a public perspective has been as strong as it ever was.\n\n“Then you have the very serious business of making a stallion and giving him a chance of being a champion stallion, which is ultimately what everyone is trying to do.\n\n“He covered 120 mares in his first season and he’s covered 105 this season, so we are very happy with how things are going from that side of things as well.\n\n“We are heading to the foal sales in December with some very nice foals and some really good owner-breeders will have their own stock to race as well.”\n\nThere are always challenges that face new stallions, but with champion credentials, Stradivarius has had little trouble attracting well-known breeders to send mares to his door.\n\nBradley went on: “There is a very strong bank of breeding rights owners who support the horse every year and the breeders involved in the horse and the breeders who are sending mares are renowned breeders who are very happy to use a horse like Stradivarius, given the quality, the longevity and how he looks physically.\n\n“It’s a diverse group, but primarily owner-breeders who want to race their stock.”\n\nThe National Stud’s determination to make Stradivarius a success in the breeding sheds is supported by a generous bonus structure – and with the chestnut himself a winner at two, it could make for some fireworks when his first crop hit the track.\n\n“We’ve got the breeders’ bonuses attached to his first and second crop and that is to encourage the breeders to use this profile of horse,” continued Bradley.\n\n“There is £25,000 for the first 10 two-year-old winners, £100,000 if you win a Group Two or Group Three and £250,000 to the breeder if you win a Group One. It’s a huge incentive for people to use the horse in the last couple of years and it will be exciting when they hit the track.\n\n“Not everyone will be interested in the bonuses, but there are lots who are and sometimes you just need those sort of things to bolster the want to breed to these horses, and I think it has worked and adds an excitement when it comes to racing – hopefully people will be gunning to win these races.”\n\nStradivarius’ longevity, combined with his charismatic nature and string of victories, made him one of the most popular Flat performers of modern times and he became one of the few racehorses whose name transcended into the wider public conscience.\n\nHis popularity is helping put plenty of eyeballs on the National Stud, where Stradivarius laps up the attention of the many who pay him a visit – may they be bloodstock industry insiders or paying visitors enjoying a behind-the-scenes tour.\n\n“There’s some horses that are well known and then there is probably a level above that where they become superstars and that can span across many countries,” continued Bradley.\n\n“He definitely fits into that category, everybody knows him and we get tours and we have people visit who aren’t overly involved in the industry and knowledgeable about horses – and a lot of them still know the name Stradivarius.”\n\nNot your typical stayer, Stradivarius had the speed to not only nullify his rivals in the marathon division but also hold his own at group level over a mile and a half during his career.\n\nHowever, it is his maiden win at Newcastle that exemplifies the characteristic Bradley feels is his finest asset – and that is the sheer tenacity and dedication to his job that saw him triumph magnificently on a regular basis during his racing career.\n\n“People forget about his two-year-old race at Newcastle because of the Gold Cups and everything else he won,” added Bradley.\n\n“It was his first victory and he looked beat, he was half a length behind over a mile as a two-year-old.\n\n“That’s my favourite race of his ever and will always be what I think of, because he showed this unbelievable will to win and tenacity. Rab Havlin said it when he was interviewed and it really stuck with me.\n\n“Can you see that tenacity and will to win in the shed? Probably not, but he is very professional and he knows exactly what needs to be done and he knows exactly how to behave, whether that be in the shed, in his box or out in the paddocks.\n\n“I suppose what I’m trying to say is, he is a very intelligent horse and he is always aware of his surroundings and what is required. He does exactly what is required of him in a very efficient way.”\n\nWith a proven liking for Epsom and a solid return under her belt already this season, Emily Upjohn is fully expected to put up a staunch defence of her Holland Cooper Coronation Cup crown on Friday.\n\nThe John and Thady Gosden-trained mare was favourite for the Oaks on this card in 2022, but suffered an agonising defeat, failing by just a short head against Tuesday after stumbling and losing plenty of ground at the start.\n\nThe daughter of Sea The Stars corrected her Epsom record in this race 12 months ago, beating the classy colt Westover by a cosy length and three-quarters under Frankie Dettori.\n\nMixed fortunes followed at Sandown and Ascot, and she had a 245-day absence to overcome when running in the Sheema Classic in March. Not surprisingly she needed the outing in finishing fifth, but all appears to have gone smoothly since.\n\nJohn Gosden said: “She worked very nicely last week and I’m pleased with her. It was a very good run I thought earlier in the year in the Sheema Classic, where they played with the pace. I liked the way she finished her race off and she wasn’t beaten far.\n\n“It’s not easy with fillies in March, training them in the winter, and she’d been off since the previous July, so she needed to get back on track. She ran a lovely race and she’s done well physically since then.\n\n“This was always the next step for her. We are trying to follow the same sort of path as last year when she went on to Sandown for the Eclipse and was beaten only half a length by Paddington. I don’t know what happened when she ran in the King George after that, but about four of them ran appallingly that day. Take nothing from the winner there, but it was a very strange race.”\n\nOf her liking for Epsom and that narrow Oaks reverse, Gosden, who was speaking to the British Champions Series, added: “She handles Epsom well and was a touch unlucky in the Oaks, but that’s life.”\n\nEmily Upjohn is set to be a warm order, with the Aidan O’Brien-trained Luxembourg next best followed by last year’s French Derby fourth Feed The Flame for Pascal Bary.\n\nRyan Moore rides Luxembourg and has a healthy respect for the opposition.\n\n“It is obvious that Emily Upjohn is very much the one to beat here,” he said in his Betfair blog.\n\n“She was probably at her best when beating Westover in this race last season, she shaped well enough in the Sheema Classic on her return and any drying conditions would just add to her chances.\n\n“But Luxemburg doesn’t have much to find with her if he is on his A-game, although he has to bounce back from a modest run in Meydan last time, admittedly. He is a three-time Group One winner and, while his best form has come over 10 furlongs, he showed he stayed this trip when seventh in the Arc on deep ground a couple of years ago.\n\n“If the favourite can be beaten, I’d hope my horse is the one to do it, but I do also respect Feed The Flame, as he was very good when he beat Adelaide River in the Grand Prix de Paris last year. He is dangerous.”\n\nThe Westover colours of Juddmonte will be carried by the useful Harry Charlton-trained mare Time Lock, who was supplemented for the race.\n\n“She’s a mile-and-a-half older mare and options are few and far between,” said Barry Mahon, Juddmonte’s European racing manager.\n\n“We just felt it suited her programme well, it didn’t look like there’d be a huge amount of runners, so we just thought it was a nice fit and not too far from home.\n\n“The track is an unknown, but she handles the undulations at Newmarket well so hopefully she’ll be able to handle Epsom.”\n\nCompleting the six declared runners is the William Haggas-trained Hamish, unbeaten in his last five starts but who has a definite preference for suitable cut in the ground.\n\nJohn Gosden may have found a contender for the St James’s Palace Stakes after Lead Artist bolted home by four and three-quarter lengths at York.\n\nLead Artist was beaten a nose by First Conquest when the pair made their debuts in the Wood Ditton at Newmarket in April, but in receipt of 6lb this time, he reversed that form with ease on the Knavesmire.\n\nThe three-year-old was battling with First Conquest for the lead with two furlongs remaining before he hit the front.\n\nLead Artist was closely followed by Dark Tornado and Under Siege, but he continued to stretch his advantage as he powered to the line and shed his maiden tag comfortably in the Darley EBF Novices Stakes, with Under Siege a distant second for Andrew Balding.\n\nThe Dubawi colt has an entry for the Group One contest at Royal Ascot and Gosden, who trains in partnership with his son Thady, did not rule out the option, with Lead Artist now a 12-1 shot from 33s with Coral.\n\n“We couldn’t run him last year but he’s come on from the Wood Ditton,” he said. “Obviously the Wood Ditton winner was giving him weight today, but he’s pulled nicely clear in the last furlong, that was his most impressive.\n\n“He’s a grand horse. I think a stiff mile is his game right now. He’s out of Obligate, a good Juddmonte family, but when you look at him he looks like a powerful Dubawi, so I wouldn’t want to stretch him out.\n\n“I wouldn’t be keen on bringing him back to seven, but a stiff mile would be good. Something has to take on the Guineas winner (Notable Speech at Ascot) and my, he was impressive.\n\n“I’d watched him win at Kempton and he’s the most beautiful moulded horse, by the same sire. Someone has to finish second and third!”\n\nBotanical ran out an impressive three-length winner of the Knights Solicitors Handicap.\n\nThe Roger Varian-trained market leader justified his 5-2 price tag when he got his nose in front for the first time inside the closing stages before blitzing the other 15 runners in the mile-and-two-furlong race.\n\nBotanical, Loyal Touch, King’s Code and Qitaal were to the fore with just over a furlong to run and it looked as though it could have been a blanket finish.\n\nBut it was four-year-old, in the hands of James Doyle, who kicked on when it mattered most to secure victory on his first appearance of the season, ahead of David Evans’ King’s Code with Reach, trained by Mick and David Easterby, a length and a quarter further adrift in third.\n\nIt provided another success for Varian and owner Sheikh Mohammed Obaid Al Maktoum in this race, having won with UAE Prince in 2019.\n\nDoyle said: “He was in super nick today. The worry was the drying ground.\n\n“He was so dominant on soft to heavy ground in Hamilton, maybe it was a weak race, but he showed there that he can cope with these conditions no problem.”\n\nRiot (16-1) ended a nine-race winless run when claiming the Yorkshire Equine Practice Stakes by two and a half lengths.\n\nThe David O’Meara-trained seven-year-old hit the front inside the final furlong before bursting further clear, with Richard Fahey’s Gincident only a neck clear of Hectic in second.\n\nJockey Danny Tudhope said: “I got a lovely track through, sometimes you can get boxed in. Your horse needs to be ridden with a lot of luck, he travelled super and got a nice gap.”\n\nJubilee Walk then claimed the concluding Irish Thoroughbred Marketing Handicap for Oisin Murphy and James Ferguson, streaking to a length-and-a-quarter victory as the 4-1 favourite.\n\nThe three-year-old was dropping back to five furlongs for the first time and seemed to relish the sprint distance when giving his jockey, who took the Boodles Yorkshire Cup on Giavellotto earlier in the day, a double on the card.\n\nKieran Shoemark helped cement his position with the Gosdens as he steered Friendly Soul to a stylish victory in the William Hill Pretty Polly Stakes at Newmarket.\n\nJohn and Thady Gosden’s daughter of Kingman is a half-sister to a plethora of high-ranking winners and created a decent impression on debut at Kempton in December.\n\nShe confirmed the promise of that Sunbury effort on the Rowley Mile on Sunday where she was both tough and professional when sent forward from the start in the hands of Shoemark.\n\nHaving made most of the running, Friendly Soul (10-1) had enough in reserve to beat off the sustained challenge of 4-6 favourite Kaldana, with the duo pulling well clear of the rest of the field in the closing stages.\n\nThere was a length and a quarter between Friendly Soul and the heavily-backed Kaldana at the line, with a further 12 back to the third Kitteridge in a performance that sparks hopes of an exciting future.\n\nFriendly Soul would have to be supplemented into the Betfred Oaks at Epsom, but joint-trainer John Gosden is instead eyeing a tilt at the French equivalent at Chantilly.\n\n“I think it was a good race, I was impressed with the second when she won here at the Craven meeting so I think it was solid (form),” he said.\n\n“I think she (Friendly Soul) is a lovely filly and I think she’s a mile and a quarter filly. She might be a filly for a visit to Chantilly (Prix de Diane).\n\n“We’ve had a slow spring, it’s been very wet and cold so I haven’t been in a hurry with the horses. We hope that May is really the time they’ll start to come to themselves.”\n\nGosden also paid tribute to Shoemark, who he confirmed is now effectively first jockey at Clarehaven after Frankie Dettori’s decision to move to America.\n\nThe trainer added: “I was feeling for Frankie last night, he had a rather tough night at Churchill Downs. He’s a great pal Frankie, we had years together and he casts a long shadow.\n\n“Kieran has waited quietly and we gave him some rides last year. He rode for me as a schoolkid, he used to come in the holidays to ride out, and has always been very natural.\n\n“His uncle (Peter Shoemark) who is our racing office manager took him home and managed to break his collarbone on a pony messing around somewhere. I’ve known him for many years, he’s a very talented rider with superb hands and a good judge. He’s bright and intelligent and a good horseman.”\n\nEmily Upjohn is being readied for a return to Epsom and a defence of her Coronation Cup crown.\n\nA narrowly beaten runner-up in the 2022 Oaks, John and Thady Gosden’s top-class mare went one better over the same course and distance last term when comfortably accounting for Westover in the hands of Frankie Dettori.\n\nThe daughter of Sea The Stars went on to push Paddington close in the Coral-Eclipse at Sandown before failing to fire in the King George at Ascot three weeks later and did not run again until finishing fifth behind Rebel’s Romance in the Dubai Sheema Classic at Meydan in late March.\n\nWith that run under her belt, the five-year-old can be expected to be at concert pitch when she lines up at Epsom once more on May 31.\n\n“Emily Upjohn is in top form and we’re aiming at the Coronation Cup at Epsom,” said John Gosden. “The Coronation is the plan and that is where she will run next.”\n\nThe Clarehaven handler is less certain regarding the next assignment for stable stalwart Lord North, who having finished well beaten in his bid for a fourth win in the Dubai Turf, proved he is not done with just yet when third in Friday’s bet365 Mile at Sandown.\n\n“We’ll see where we go with him, but he’s in good form and enjoying his racing,” Gosden added.\n\n“He had to run in the Winter Derby over a furlong too far at a mile and three at Southwell and the ground was very fast in Dubai, which isn’t entirely his cup of tea now, but he ran great on Friday.\n\n“He loves his training at home and William (Buick) said he loved his racing at Sandown, so we will keep ticking along.”\n\nBeeley could be set for a sharp rise in class after filling the runner-up spot in a novice event at Sandown on Friday, with Gosden prepared to test her mettle in the Weatherbys Digital Solutions Cheshire Oaks.\n\nThe Duke Of Devonshire-owned daughter of Camelot was beaten a nose on debut at Nottingham last autumn, with the form of that performance boosted by both the winner and 1000 Guineas-bound third Rolica.\n\nBeeley was withdrawn after unseating her rider and galloping loose both when returned to Nottingham for her intended second start and at Newbury for a slated reappearance earlier this month, but consented to jump off at Sandown and confirmed she has plenty of ability by finishing best of the rest behind her well-regarded stablemate Siyola.\n\nRegarding plans for Beeley, Gosden said: “I’m going to go straight to the Cheshire Oaks with her now if she’s in good form. She needs a trip and she needs racing.\n\n“We had her met at the start straight away (at Sandown) and we had a little coupling that we clipped on before the antics started and she was very good.\n\n“She was mounted in the stalls and she had an opinion on that. She’s a very opinionated, charming filly to be around, but she keeps you on your toes and she’s certainly had us on our toes this year.”\n\nThe Middleton Stakes at York and the Lockinge at Newbury are among the races likely to come under consideration for Nashwa following her creditable comeback run in Dubai last weekend.\n\nJohn and Thady Gosden’s filly has struck gold three times in Group One company, landing the French Oaks and the Nassau Stakes in 2022 before adding the Falmouth Stakes to her CV last summer.\n\nShe was also placed against the colts in both the Juddmonte International and the Irish Champion Stakes last season and headed for the Middle East to make her five-year-old debut on Dubai World Cup night.\n\nDrawn widest of all at Meydan in stall 16, Nashwa managed to get into a prominent early position in the Dubai Turf and was not beaten far in the end – and connections are taking the positives out of her performance.\n\nTeddy Grimthorpe, racing manager for owner-breeder Imad Alsagar, said: “Her chance was certainly compromised by the draw, but it is what it is. She’s run a super race and got a great ride and everything pretty much went to plan.\n\n“She just had to use herself up a little too much, but she was beaten just over four lengths, so overall we were very encouraged really.\n\n“We’d hope she’ll improve, as she did last season. She’s due back tomorrow and we’ll see how she is, but I think we’ll probably look at the mile, mile and a quarter races.”\n\nNashwa is entered in the Al Basti Equiworld Dubai Middleton Fillies’ Stakes at York on May 16 and the Al Shaqab Lockinge at Newbury two days later. The daughter of Frankel appears likely to contest one or the other on her next appearance.\n\n“Of course, it depends how she comes out of the race. She recovered fine, but we’ll see how she takes the trip home etc, and then we’ll make a plan,” Grimthorpe added\n\n“She’s in the Middleton and the Lockinge and I think those would be the most likely potential targets.”"
