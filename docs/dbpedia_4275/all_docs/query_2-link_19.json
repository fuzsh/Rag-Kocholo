        "text": "\"It is a difficult draw for Golan in the Guineas and Tempest (Michael's other runner) has got a good draw so we will just have to look through the whole race and see who is doing what.\"\n\nHe went on: \"Golan is on the outside and it is going to be difficult, all the fancied horses are from one to something like 10 or 12, and that would be the ideal position to be.\n\n\"Nineteen is not a good draw, you will be stuck on the outside and trying to ride a race and trying to follow the right ones, it is going to be very difficult I think.\"\n\nHowever, Golan held his position as second favourite with all the leading layers and is generally a 7-1 chance, but Tobougg strengthened at the head of the market despite all the fancied contenders standing their ground.\n\nCoral Eurobet have trimmed him from 9-4 to 2-1 (same price as William Hill) while the Tote make him a 5-2 chance from 11-4 to see off his 18 rivals and he has been a popular fancy with punters even though he has not been seen in public this season."
