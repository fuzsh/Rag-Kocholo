        "text": "Eden Golan, who will represent Israel at the upcoming Eurovision Song Contest in Sweden in May, has received death threats amid the ongoing war between Israel and the Iranian-backed terrorist organization Hamas.\n\nThe threats were reportedly delivered to the Golan's Instagram account and included menacing messages warning her that she would get hurt ahead of the large-scale music competition.\n\nGolan and her Israeli delegation will receive unprecedented security during Eurovision, which will take place in the Swedish coastal city of Malmö next month. Contributing to the current tensions against Israel is the demographic makeup of the city, with approximately one-third of its current population hailing from Middle Eastern countries.\n\n“I took into account that I would also receive such comments on Instagram,” Golan said about the threats against her.\n\n“I feel confident and determined to represent Israel in the best possible way. Our delegation travels with a trained security team, and I am sure they will do their best job to protect us.”\n\nOne of Golan’s friends told the Walla news outlet:: “She is one of the most professional and goal-oriented singers you will know,” while adding, “but it is impossible not to say that the threats she receives directly on her Instagram, and these are threats, are throwing her off balance.”\n\nAnother friend feared that the threats could affect her performance at Eurovision.\n\n“This will stop her from giving her best performance and representing Israel with respect, especially in this time. Her parents will also hire additional personal security guards at their own expense to protect themselves.”\n\nThere has been vocal opposition to Israel’s participation in the Eurovision Song Contest due to the ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nIn January, more than 1,000 Swedish musicians signed an open letter calling for Israel’s exclusion due to its “brutal warfare in Gaza.”\n\nThe original song that Golan entered for the competition – “October Rain” – was disqualified, as the European organizers claimed that it contained “political lyrics.”\n\nHowever, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) has rejected calls for boycotting Israel.\n\n“We are a member-led organization,” the EBU responded in December. “The governing bodies of the EBU – headed by the Executive Board – represent the membership. These bodies have reviewed the participants list and agreed that the Israeli public broadcaster KAN meets all the competition rules and can participate in the Contest next year in Malmö, Sweden, alongside 36 other broadcasters.”\n\nIn March, Golan unveiled her new Eurovision song, “Hurricane,” inspired by an Israeli perspective of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel and the emotional aftermath on Israelis.\n\n“I ended up [competing] in a not simple year,” Golan admitted. However, she explained that the trauma from the Ocober terror attack makes it even more important for her to represent Israel at international competitions.\n\n“…I even more so want to represent the country this year, because of its meaning — it has a totally different significance. And we can bring everything we’re feeling, and everything the country is going through, in those three minutes. To speak through the song to the world.”"
