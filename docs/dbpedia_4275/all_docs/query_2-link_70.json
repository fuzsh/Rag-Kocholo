        "text": "Sir Michael Stoute claimed the outright record for the most King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes wins when Poet’s Word, the 7-4 second favourite, beat his stable companion, Crystal Ocean, by a hard-fought neck to give him a sixth victory in high summer’s middle-distance Championship at Ascot on Saturday.\n\nThis year’s King George, sponsored by Qipco, might have lacked a few headliners such as Derby winner Masar, defending Champion Enable, or even Cracksman, a last-minute absentee because of the quick ground, but who is to say any of those would have spoiled the Stoute party as his two runners fought out a thriller between themselves a country mile ahead of their rivals?\n\nIt was a classic case of two jockeys trying to make the most of their horse’s strong suits: James Doyle on Poet’s Word was riding for speed from the back, while his great friend and fellow jockey at Godolphin, William Buick, was riding his mount Crystal Ocean nearer the front end for stamina.\n\nIn a fast-run race set up by Rostropovich and Salouen, who led to the final turn, Buick, who had sat just behind them, kicked as they straightened up for home.\n\nAt that stage Doyle had four lengths to make up, but eventually – and only just – in the final 100 yards it was the speed of Poet’s Word which, on this occasion, trumped Crystal Ocean’s endurance.\n\nLocked in combat, the pair had drawn nine lengths clear of the filly Coronet in third, with the heroic Salouen in fourth. He picked up £57,000 for his efforts, a considerably bigger cheque than he would have received for winning a Group Three elsewhere.\n\n“The only better result would have been a dead-heat,” said Stoute, 72, afterwards. “They are two such admirable horses. They are both delightful to train. I didn’t think he’d get there until the last 100 yards. I couldn’t separate them before and I don’t think the handicapper could either.”\n\nThe 10-time champion trainer, who endured a few seasons in the doldrums a couple of years ago, added: “It’s a great team effort. You’ve no idea how much each [lad] puts into these horses. Even when we weren’t winning big races here we were winning Group Ones abroad and Breeders’ Cups. I won’t be champion trainer again because I don’t have the numbers these days and the quality is down a bit with the Weinstocks going out of racing, but we carry on.”\n\nStoute’s first win in the race was with Shergar in 1981. Staying at the top is harder than getting there, but the trainer has followed it up with Opera House, Golan, Conduit, Harbinger and now Poet’s Word.\n\nLike Opera House, yesterday’s winner, who was bred in Epsom at the Woodcote Stud, is five and is testament to the trainer’s legendary patience – he started off his four-year-old campaign winning a handicap on the all-weather at Chelmsford – and his skill at producing the slow burners at the top level however long it takes. Last week Doyle had employed similar tactics to win the Irish Oaks on Sea Of Class and afterwards he admitted that winning the Irish Classic had given him the confidence to produce Poet’s Word at the precise moment.\n\nAnd while Stoute had wondered a furlong out if the winner would pass the runner-up, Doyle said he was more concerned that he had got there too soon, as Crystal Ocean refused to lie down and came back at him in the last strides.\n\nwarrior. He’s so professional whether you’re asking him to relax in the early part of the race or get going later on.\n\n“He’s similar to Al Kazeem, who I rode at an early stage in my career – push button. And Al Kazeem gave me a lot of confidence in riding these big races. A furlong out I was always going to get there.\n\n“William’s a great friend and there were a few bits and bobs in the media about us going head-to-head here, but for us it was no different to normal –\n\nalthough it’s always nice to get one up on him! Riding a big winner a week ago just gives you that extra confidence to wait those extra 10 strides.”\n\nBuick was delighted with the runner-up. “He ran a great race,” he said. “It was a true test. He’s an honest, lovely horse and got run down very late. It’s been a great day but the best horse won.”"
