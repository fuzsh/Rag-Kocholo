        "text": "The middle-distance showpiece has attracted 10 confirmations at the five-day stage, with four of those representing the all-conquering O’Brien stable.\n\nIn addition to Tattersalls Gold Cup and Prince Of Wales’s Stakes winner Duke Of Marmalade, Ballydoyle can also call upon Coral-Eclipse victor Mount Nelson, Hardwicke hero Macarthur and Red Rock Canyon, who will almost certainly be used in a pace-making capacity.\n\nO’Brien saddled Dylan Thomas to victory 12 months ago, and the runner-up on that occasion, Youmzain, has stood his ground following his success in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud.\n\nSir Michael Stoute, whose last win in the race came with Golan in 2002, has both the enigmatic Papal Bull and Ask engaged this time, with last year’s St Leger winner Lucarno representing John Gosden.\n\nLucarno, who made all to win at Newmarket’s July meeting when returning to something like his best form, was one of the King George runners punters were latching on to yesterday.\n\nWilliam Hill, who have also seen good money for Youmzain (currently an 11-4 shot) reported he was backed from 14s to 8-1.\n\nGosden’s office manager Peter Shoemark said of Lucarno: “He is in great form and we are looking forward to seeing how he performs. He has come out of the Newmarket race in good shape.\n\n“Obviously Duke Of Marmalade is going to be very hard to beat if he gets the trip. It is a very tough race as you would expect for a King George, but our horse is in good form so we are hopeful.”\n\nWilliam Hill bet: 8-11 Duke Of Marmalade, 11-4 Youmzain, 8 Lucarno, 10 Ask, 12 Macarthur, 14 Papal Bull, 20 Mount Nelson, 33 Literato, 100 Petara Bay, 200 Red Rock Canyon."
