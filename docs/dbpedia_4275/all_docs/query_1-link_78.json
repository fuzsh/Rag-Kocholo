        "text": "VINTAGE SEASON TO END ON A HIGH\n\nToday’s quiz question is, who said “rumours of my death have been greatly exaggerated?”\n\nOnce again, the resilience of Zimbos has seen off all the prophets of doom who regularly forecast the demise of Borrowdale Park. In fact, the year is turning out to be something of a vintage season and it is due to conclude with a cracking race meeting on Saturday 27th of July when we celebrate the life of Kamal Khalfan with a Memorial renewal of the Republic Cup over 1900m. And what a race that is going to be – it could not get much more exciting. Everybody with a pulse should attend as history might be made.\n\nThe race will probably bring together the very best middle-distance horses in the country, notably the Tankard winner Raffles and the OK and Triple Crown victor, Buster Barnes. Also in the field will be last year’s Tankard winner, Ideal View plus other stalwarts such as Wantage, Holy Land, Majestic Warrior, Citrusdal, and Jaeger Moon – it will probably be a ten or twelve-horse field, but Final Acceptances are not out yet.\n\nRaffles will not have to lug 62kg around the track this time – but 61kg – and Buster Barnes will be carrying 55.5kg – a good bit more than the modest 52kg that he did in the OK – so the result is going to be a lot tighter in their renewed challenge. It’s anybody’s call this time – making for a really exciting finale to a season where so many positive outcomes have been in evidence.\n\nThe three big, sponsored races were renewed with very generous purses.\n\nBuster Barnes won the Triple Crown – a very rare and difficult accolade to achieve.\n\nDown to Business, who was the 2023/24 Zimbabwe champion, went south to campaign and pulled off the Lonsdale Stirrup Cup – with more to follow.\n\nThe MTC continued its great progress to operating beyond breakeven – without a cent of betting revenue.\n\nThe club’s Rules and Bye Laws were successfully redrafted – for the first time in more than fifty years.\n\nThe club’s retail estate continued its progressive development – with much more to come.\n\nThe club’s farming venture has begun making material contributions to the financial fortunes of Borrowdale Park.\n\nThe people’s racing club, ZimFun completed its fourth season with a total of six winners to lead in.\n\nDespite the modesty of Borrowdale purses, a number of new and potentially new owners emerged in the year – boding well for the future.\n\nThe home of Owners and Trainers, the Ipi Tombe bar, re-opened and broadened its scope of activities excitingly.\n\nFor the first time in many years, the MTC was able to boast a full complement of Stewards – and in so doing greatly enhanced its functionality.\n\nSeveral local jockeys returned from sojourns overseas to augment the club’s broader riding resources.\n\nSome new initiatives are currently in an advanced stage of planning by the MTC – all of which will further underpin the future of Borrowdale Park – watch this space.\n\nAnd Duncan Cocksedge – the elder statesman of Zimbabwe Racing – turned 90!\n\nAugust and September will see the refurbishment of the track in readiness for the start of the 2024 – 25 racing season. Let us hope it will be an even more of a vintage year than the one now closing – a million miles away from the graveyard of sporting clubs.\n\nC J Smith 21st July 2024.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\nIT IS A BIG DEAL\n\nWhilst racing returns to Borrowdale Park on Saturday the 29th of June, the much bigger news is that this meeting will be attended by Arnold Hyde, the Racing Control Executive of the National Horse Racing Authority of South Africa – he is a key player in the NHRA and his visit is very much welcomed by the MTC.\n\nThe purpose of his visit is to undertake Stipendiary Steward duties at the race meeting and to meet with all the stakeholders of the Mashonaland Turf Club. And who are they? Well the MTC stakeholders are all the owners, trainers and officials of the club and that meeting will take place after the last race in the Ipi Tombe bar.\n\nThough the NHRA is based in South Africa, it controls the operations of all the racing operators of Southern Africa and, amongst many roles, it is responsible for ensuring the integrity of the horse racing; licencing operators, owners, trainers and jockeys; handicapping and Merit Rating determination, and dope testing. It is hard to say which is the more important function – but without the NHRA and the effective implementation of the Rules of Racing there would be no racing – end of!\n\nAs owners and punters, the NHRA safeguards our interests without fear or favour – and suffers much abuse from many quarters as thanks for its efforts. However, it can be said without equivocation the NHRA has 100% backing of the Mashonaland Turf Club.\n\nGiven the scale of investment in bloodstock and bets, there is much temptation to bend the rules by the unscrupulous, and the fact that the NHRA and its staff come in for much flak suggests to me that they are doing a great job of keeping the sport squeaky clean. As a famous bomber pilot said in the Second World War “The closer we get to the target the more flak we fly into!”\n\nMr Hyde will hopefully give us a bit of an update as to what is happening in the NHRA and with the racing scene in South Africa where most operators are facing immense economic challenges. For example we are advised that Gold Circle will run out of cash by early 2025! He will also try and answer any questions stakeholders may wish to pose and provide clarification on any grey areas which are raised.\n\nSo apart from enjoying the racing, please make Mr Hyde very welcome on Saturday – and one last thing, he is a Zimbo – from Gweru – for that make him doubly welcome.\n\n27 June 2024\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nBUSTER BARNES TRIUMPHS IN OK\n\nIt was one of those remarkable days of racing that can only happen at Borrowdale Park – Packed stands, loud local music, 51 cars raffled, and the nation’s best horses lined up for the Group 1 OK Grand Challenge over 1800 metres.\n\nAmongst the fifteen contenders was the favourite, Raffles, recently imported from South Africa by his connections to compete in the nation’s big three, the Castle Tankard, the OK, and the Republic Cup. Raffles won the first leg convincingly with Gavin Lerena on board, but the OK was going to be a bigger challenge. He was worse off at the weights carrying 62kg, he didn’t have Lerena as his pilot, and there was a much younger pretender to his crown in the field. Three-year-old, Buster Barnes had just nailed the Zimbabwe Triple Crown and was now stepping up in class.\n\nBuster is by a very underrated sire in RSA – Erupt (IRE) by Dubawi (a horse that ran well in both the Prix de L’Arc De Triomphe and the Japan Cup) – and he was bought from Millstream Stud for R200,000.\n\nLazarus man, Deryl Daniels, wasted hard to get down to 52 kg so that he could ride without any overweight. Throughout the race, he had Buster positioned well and had him poised to strike as they entered the straight for the finish. When he asked him for his effort, Buster Barnes obliged with enthusiasm, cutting past the field of 14 in the last four hundred metres in effortless fashion, and in doing so blowing away Raffles by an extending two lengths.\n\nA three-year-old can rarely take on the older and best horses in Zimbabwe and come out on top, but Buster Barnes did so with consummate ease – he simply blew them all away – going away. Centaur Chairman, “CJ” Smith, said “In truth I never had any doubt about the outcome of this race. Buster Barnes is head and shoulders above every horse here. The exciting thing for us is that the boy is still totally unfurnished – his best years are ahead of him, as a three, four and five-year-old. But where should he race now? Prospects in Zim are a bit thin – so it will have to be elsewhere – RSA or even further afield.\n\n“Well done to the sponsors, the OK, and to the MTC for keeping racing going. The future for Borrowdale Park is now very much assured – and for his sake, I hope Deryl’s future is assured too – he is certainly a jockey of immense skill and talent – his time has come”\n\n9th June 2024\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nA CRACKING COMPETITIVE CORNUCOPIA\n\nA big thanks to Delta for sponsoring the Tankard again – I know we say this every year but it is heartfelt and much appreciated – and it is a major punctuation mark in the Annual Racing Calendar at Borrowdale Park.\n\nThis year’s renewal might well be one of the most open races in Tankard history. Lots of runners in with chances.\n\nTop of the Board is Raffles – formerly of the Roy Magner yard – and ridden by Gavin Lerena. It’s a hotpot favourite because SA horses coming North carry lower merit ratings than they would have if they had raced in the rarefied horse population atmosphere of Zim – where picking up MR points seems to be much easier (and there is another story here too!)\n\nFor me it looked a nailed-on outcome until I studied the times of his runs and what his true distances might be. Given that all tracks, conditions and jockeys are different, the maths say Raffles might not be the fastest horse in the race, nor might he see out a fast run 2000 meter race – and it will be fast run.\n\nSo who else? Ideal View won the Tankard last year but carries 7kg more this year – that will slow him down quite a bit – almost by 2 seconds. Having said that, he did win the race in a very fast time of 120.08 in 2023 – and did so despite running up the backside of Raining Again in the finishing straight, checking, and having to take off again. I would also say that 2000 meters is right up his street.\n\nHoly Land is a good contender and wasn’t far off last year either – maybe 2000 meters is not his best distance. The same can be said for Dindingwe. She will set off like the clappers and will keep going. She may not be quite what she was and that wide draw of 11 isn’t going to help her.\n\nWantage has a big chance – a huge turnaround in the weights with Ideal View from last year – and Kaidan Brewer is a very competent pilot – he will be in with a good shout.\n\nMajestic Warrior – owned by racing doyens, the Cocksedges, could be anything. It won easily in April, is ridden by Deryl Daniels, and carries just 52kg – nout as they say in Yorkshire. Drawn 4, I expect him to make it a true run race as well. He is well out of the handicap – by some 6kg – but I think he is a good bit better than his MR rating – a good place bet at worst.\n\nFinally there is Raining Again. He ran a cracker in 2023 and carries just 52kg from draw 7. This is another front-runner and I believe Gavin MacLeod has never had him in better condition. Big chance.\n\nSo not an easy race to pick – but my take on it is Raining Again, Ideal View, Wantage, and Raffles, in a tight finish.\n\nAND THERE’S MORE!\n\nThe penultimate race of the day – for me is the most important race in the calendar. The Zimbabwe Derby – run over 2400m – open to just three-year-old colts, geldings and fillies – at level weights (58kg) with a sex allowance for fillies (54.5kg). The third leg of the Triple Crown reveals which horse is actually the best three-year-old in the country for each year. Handicaps, like the Tankard and the OK Grand Challenge don’t do that – such races serve a very different, and for me, a subordinate purpose.\n\nThis year there is added tension because one horse, Buster Barnes, from the Centaur Syndicate string, has already won the first two legs of the Triple Crown and is 1 to 4 on to pull off the big one. On the face of it, he should lead the field home – but that’s what we said about City Of Troy last week in the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket UK. Instead, he trailed in second last.\n\nBuster Barnes may not be in the same league as Centaur Syndicate’s other great star, Grand Warrior, but is above average. By Erupt (stayer) out of the Caesour mare, Servilia (sprinter) Buster has the credentials – we wish Centaur Syndicate a much-deserved Triple Crown success.\n\nAND EVEN MORE!\n\nGrand Warrior had been given every opportunity to recover from his pulled near for tendon – found on the eve of last year’s Tankard when evens favourite – but the patience has not been rewarded with success. His racing days are over – a very sad story.\n\nAND EVEN EVEN MORE!\n\nCan there be more? – well sure there can. The Zambezi Lager MR 85 Handicap over 1200 meters and run at 12.35 pm features ZimFun at the centre of attention with their very smart gelding VAR AGLOW attempting to win his fifth race in a row. Can that be possible?\n\nAnd yet further excitement – guess who is back and riding for Debbie Swanson – yup former champion jockey Norbert Takawira. He is going to get his sushi and Saba Thai from now on!\n\nBig thanks to Centaur for keeping this race open by accepting Bugatti Blue to run his 64th race – not only is he a stayer – but he will carry the lumpy pudding of 62 kg. Now that is proper sportsmanship and an example to all owners.\n\nIt is going to be tough ask for VAR AGLOW as he too is going to carry a lot of weight – 61kg. The leading adversaries are Forgotten Time (for Messrs Littleford, Murray and Rugg) carrying 53.5kg, and Kallipos (for one of our favourite owners, Edith Tapfuma) also carrying 53.5kg.\n\nVar Aglow is going to have to be at the very top of his game to beat these two – and I fancy the latter, Kallipos to prevail. If I am wrong, I suspect ZimFunners will express their pleasure in their now famous noisy, and extravagant way. Go the Smiley Faces!\n\nAll in all 2024 Castle Tankard Day is going to be one of the most memorable. Be there\n\n10 May 2024\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nIS IT WORTH IT ?\n\nI have written about this before – and I remain of the belief that to expect a chance of success in South Africa or elsewhere any Zim champion has to do three things – win in the top division, (that is a Group 1 race), carry top weight in such a race, and win in record time.\n\nToday there is another parameter to consider – if we don’t go south or further afield, what do we do with an outstanding horse in Zimbabwe? There just aren’t enough races for such a horse, not enough contenders, and while the Big Three race purses are good, there are only three of those and they are run in just nine weeks from May to mid-July. So it is travel or stand in a stable for long periods.\n\nAnd so it was with so many of our stars, Lily Blue, Dindingwe, Diesel and Dust, and more latterly, Down To Business. They were all sent south to progress their careers. Whilst the first three did “all right” in their respective campaigns – they struggled to compete at the highest levels.\n\nDown To Business has only had some four runs, but his effort on Sunday 14th April in the Highland Night Cup was very good indeed. The race was run over 2400m – his correct distance – and he lost by just a third of a length to Cape Eagle and One Way Traffic in the pretty decent time of 153.02 seconds. Big congratulations to the Tubbies, stalwart supporters of Borrowdale Park for many decades. Down To Business has much more to come – we wish him well in his future campaign.\n\nWhilst the course is not the same as Borrowdale, I wonder if that time might give us a pointer to what the Zim Derby should be run in – and thus a pointer to potential.\n\nHad Grand Warrior not injured a tendon a year ago, I suspect he too would have taken his chances in SA – but that’s the tough life of racing – great exhilaration but also huge disappointments (a bit like marriage!)\n\nCentaur’s emerging nice horse is Buster Barnes. By the Dubawi sire, Erupt out of Servilia (a Caesour mare), this three-year-old gelding has now won five of his seven starts, he has been placed second on two occasions and – and without wishing to tempt providence – he looks a promising prospect for the Derby to be run over 2400 m and in winning it he would lift the 2024 Triple Crown. But is he really a star? Who knows? Who can tell? What has he beaten? Whilst he seems to close down his races rather convincingly, he certainly has not ticked any of the export boxes, well not yet. Let’s see what his time is in the Derby then we can gauge whether he might be competitive down south. Then we should see how he performs in the OK on 8th June – against more seasoned campaigners – including the new émigré from Roy Magner’s yard, Raffles.\n\nIf Buster Barnes can’t win the OK, you have to ask – with regard to sending him to RSA – is it worth it? If he can’t, then for me it’s not – but what other plan can there be? Tough choices for Centaur Syndicate – but the right sort to have.\n\nPhotograph by Zimbabwe Equine News.\n\n22nd April 2024\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nAnd So It All Begins\n\nThis is a fabulous time of the year for all racing fans and aficionados of our great sport. The National Yearling Sales run from the 18th to 19th April in Johannesburg. The Craven Stakes is run at Newmarket in the UK on the 18th, the Qipco 2,000 Guineas takes place at Newmarket on the 4th May, the Zim Derby goes on the 11th May, and the Castle Tankard is run on the same day – and that is just the hors d’oeuvres! More of the main courses and desserts later.\n\nThe National Yearling Sales will be tough for Zimbos this year, yearling numbers are down and demand is up – that only means one thing, higher prices.\n\nTrying to find a good horse to race in Zimbabwe for a sensible price and for modest stake money is a tough ask – but not without hope – and all because I think the South Africans seem to miss a trick or two on an annual basis.\n\nSA breeders and buyers seem to have a general bias towards their own sires and those that raced in America. Why? For me, it must be loyalty to their own favourite big race stars and to canny US marketing. These are two soppy sentiments that should have no place in buying a horse.\n\nI am not saying there aren’t any great SA sires or successful American stallions – witness Vercingetorix and Trippi. They and their like command very high sale prices, and rightly so – but how many of the others have really performed on the world stage? Not so many.\n\nFor me there is also the tendency to overlook the pointers from the great centres of excellence. Top of that list for me is Coolmore in Ireland. John Magnier could well be God – omniscient, perspicacious and wise. These guys have distilled the art of breeding horses to perfection. I don’t need to list their successes – there is not enough space in this column. However, I would just mention Galileo, Auguste Rodin, Frankel and Nathaniel – tracing back to the foundation sire, Northern Dancer who won two legs of the US Triple Crown in 1964 – and long before doping became so clever and insidious. ( more on Bob Baffert and Justify in a later column)\n\nThen there is Godolphin. Maybe the Sheiks are not quite as clever as John Magnier – but they can afford to employ the very best. That route has produced the rare gem, Dubawi, son of Dubai Millenium who died at the age of five from grass sickness. This is the Mr Prospector line, another US sire from the 70s who was a sprinter which won seven of his fourteen starts. Dubawi is a prolific and successful sire – remember Too Darn Hot, Ghaiyyath, New Bay, Mafki and Lord North to mention just a few.\n\nNow why am I mentioning foreign blood? Well, favourite for the Craven Stakes is Cambridge from the Aiden O’Brian yard. By Dubawi out of the Galileo mare Amerique. This is the nick – Mr Prospector sire lines out of Northern Dancer dam lines (remember Ipi Tombe – that was the same nick) and it works just as well the other way round. I am impressed that Coolmore were prepared to go to Godolphin to implement this mating but it wasn’t the first and it won’t be the last time.\n\nThe point I am trying to make is that the centres of breeding excellence pursue these breeding formulae to tremendous effect – they provide a template for others to emulate. I am not sure why anyone might think they could be cleverer than Coolmore? Not possible.\n\nIn SA there are one or two visionaries – notably Robin Bruss, but there are others. What does surprise me is that Global View, Flying the Flag and United States (all by Galileo) have so few foals nowadays and even fewer from Mr Prospector dam lines. Similarly, Erupt by Dubawi only has four yearlings on the sale. On top of that, historically these foals will not command high prices as these sire lines appear to be “out of fashion”. All good news for Zimbos with short pockets.\n\nFlying the Flag has NO foals on the sale! Staggering, when you remember that his full sister, Rhododendron is the dam of Auguste Rodin – possibly one of the best colts in the world having won both Derbys in the UK and Ireland and who then went on to win the Breeders’ Cup Turf in the USA.\n\nGlobal View has only four foals on the sale. Madness. Here is a Galileo sire who had no right to win races in America – but did so in style, and whose dam was Egyptian Queen was sold as a yearling for US$3.8 million! His stock are well respected and successful in Zimbabwe\n\nUnited States has 13 yearlings for sale – compared to 43 by Vercingetorix. His stock might be a bit more pricey. But where are the right crosses? Please refer to Coolmore for guidance.\n\nThe thing about Galileo stock is…… you have to be patient … in general, they are not two year old types. Maybe that is the problem in SA where precocious types may be preferred.\n\nThen there is Erupt. Here is an international traveller of note having raced a Woodbine, Tokyo, Paris, Longchamp and Ascot et al – and having done so with great credit. How many SA sires would have been good enough to run 5th in the Arc to Golden Horn, 5th to Highland Reel in the King George VI at Ascot or just 2 lengths 6th to Shonon Pandora (by Deep Impact) in the Japan Cup? Answer – probably very few indeed.\n\nSo whilst Zimbabwean buyers might have to be prudent in their purchases, South African proclivities may play into their hands… let’s see how we get on.\n\nPhotograph by Romi Bettison\n\n17 April 2024\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\n\nGREEN SHOOTS APLENTY – BLIGHT UNDER CONTROL\n\nWe are now past halfway through the current racing season at Borrowdale Park and despite the best efforts of El Nino, the prophets of doom (who are these people anyway?), and a serious shortage of horses to race at our magnificent track, the MTC is a blaze of green shoots and positivity.\n\nPerhaps the most positive sign of this is the new Board of Stewards. Historically being a Steward was something of a poison chalice – a focal point for moaners, groaners, and troublemakers – and something to be avoided at all costs. Well, 2024 is different. For the first time in several years we have a full complement of 12 Stewards – with others standing ready to man the fort if required.\n\nFor the record and with a clue to their responsibilities, here is the list:\n\nScott Buchan – remains as Chairman and effectively the General Manager\n\nRichard Beattie – Deputy Chair and Scott’s right hand man\n\nAsh Dixon – specific interest in land issues and financial matters\n\nGary de Jong – the retail estate\n\nChris Shepherd – trainer liaison\n\nDuncan Cocksedge – the racing programme\n\nBev Jack – new Steward – marketing and promotion of BP\n\nKevin Fallon – new Steward – matters financial\n\nC J – re-elected – spreadsheets, narratives and PR\n\nCraig Dankwerts – new Steward – farming and racing matters\n\nMarc Pozzo – new Steward – learning the ropes\n\nSteve Schutt – new steward – learning the rope\n\nThe Club’s finances have not progressed quite as positively as had been hoped – but they have progressed very well indeed. To give substance to that claim, let me say that in the past four years, our retail estate has seen rental revenue rise from a modest $300 per month to over $40,000 per month today with much more to follow in the months to come.\n\nTo put that into some sort of context, let me say that it costs approaching $40,000 per month to run the MTC – without purses for the 15 unsponsored meetings – which amount to a further $100,000.\n\nEarly signals from the big sponsors, such as Delta and OK, suggest they are on board for another year.\n\nOur farming venture has been doing well enough but the current crop of spuds – soon to be lifted – is likely to provide the club with a cash injection of approaching $80,000.\n\nFinally, we have been able to balance the books with a bit of prudent asset management. There are also encouraging signs for even more positive news in this regard in the not-too-distant future – watch this space.\n\nWhilst there might be accusations that we are always preaching “jam tomorrow” the financial evidence is rock solid – which means that there is plenty of scope for optimism.\n\nTo give further concrete evidence of the Club’s direction of travel let me point to the refurbishment of the sand training track which has seen some nine or ten bulker loads of sand added to the surface in recent days.\n\nThen there are the new facilities under the “bridge” for race day personnel and admin. These include ablutions, weighing room, jockey room, trainers’ room, Stipes office, and admin offices. Provision has also been made for several other retail outlets in this area too – for more rental revenue. (It is quite possible that by the start of 2025, rental income from the entire MTC retail estate will exceed $50,000 per month – or $600,000 per year – that is some result!)\n\nThe old MOTA Bar has become the Ipi Tombe 100 Club – a home for owners and trainers and a venue for many other social functions – profits from which will all benefit the MTC. This venue will also see the return of the Airscreen Project – yet another donation from a Borrowdale stalwart.\n\nSpeaking of donations, not only was there a new tractor donated to the Club but in recent days two other benefactors have donated two laptops to the MTC admin department – which is now no longer steam-driven!\n\nIn the background there is much other work going on – and with considerable enthusiasm. In this regard, it can be reported that the Club’s Rules and Bye-Laws (1970?) have been re-drafted to bring them up to date and into the 21st Century. It was quite a task but long overdue. All MTC members should have received draft copies by now and their comments and advice are sought before ratification at a Special General Meeting in April.\n\nAt this Special General Meeting, consideration will also be given to the nominations for Honorary Life Membership – if you would like to nominate someone who you think has given exemplary service to the MTC for an extended period – please submit your nomination/s to oliviagadzah@gmail.com – before 30th March – which is just the end of next week!\n\nAlso going on behind the scenes is work on a new Management Information System which, on completion will give the Board and its accountants (Chapmans) a much stronger handle on the day-to-day financial affairs of the club.\n\nHaving made all these positive “green shoot” observations, it is recognised by the MTC that the biggest remaining challenge is that of stake money – or should I say, the paucity of it. Without improvements in this regard, owner and horse numbers will remain under pressure. Accordingly the focus is very much centred on addressing this fundamental issue. Once all operating costs of the MTC are covered, every last cent of the surplus will be directed at lifting purses.\n\nIt should be noted that, unlike any other racing club around the world, the MTC receives not a cent in revenue from betting. Not one cent. Accordingly, the Board’s efforts in re-purposing all the club’s assets are both highly laudable and perspicacious.\n\nHaving said that, the Board is not ignoring the opportunities that betting might present for the club – not only on horses but on other sports too. Watch this space for further news in this regard. The new Board of Stewards has the energy, imagination, time, skill sets, and commitment to the MTC which should see us over the long-term viability threshold and hopefully on to that upland plain where almost any dream can be achieved. And as indicated, to achieve this without a betting revenue stream makes the MTC a bit special – but there again, nothing you wouldn’t expect from a Zimbo\n\n21st March 2024\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\nNOMINATIONS & ACCEPTANCES\n\nThe Rules of the Mashonaland Turf Club were written many years ago and in many respects they are out of date, and in some respects, unworkable. Nevertheless, they are all we have to work with and as such we must do our best.\n\nOne of the Rules is that we should have an Annual General Meeting – by the end of December each year. In recent times this deadline has been missed. This year is no different – the AGM will be held on Thursday 29th February – make a note in your diary and all MTC Members are invited to attend.\n\nThe agenda for the meeting has yet to be known but two of the key elements will be the Chairman’s Report and the presentation of the Annual Accounts. Both will be very interesting to Voting Members as much has happened in recent years.\n\nMake no mistake, the last four or five years have been tough going. By the end of 2018, for all intents and purposes, the Club was about to collapse. The then Board resigned in mass and a new Board took over the reins of the operation. Key new players were Gary Carter, Ash Dixon, and Scott Buchan.\n\nThe trio brought a new dynamism to the MTC – beginning with the raising of a war chest to keep the show on the road. Success in this regard gave the Board time to review and consider all the options available to them to return the club to economic viability. A variety of inevitable cost-cutting measures were introduced – notably staff and stakes.\n\nThe Board then embarked – rightly – on a programme of repurposing the club’s many assets. From modest beginnings, the Turf Club has now become a mini retail park, with some 50 outlets generating an increasingly substantial revenue stream which goes a long way to meeting racing’s operating costs.\n\nThe Board then gave a green light to a project for the infield – farming! Some 25 hectares under centre pivot irrigation have been developed for potatoes and rotational crops such as soya beans and wheat.\n\nFinally, the MTC was able to retain and enhance the sponsorship base of the Club which peaked last year with the running of the Republic Cup for $75,000 – real US dollars. This was organised by a doyen of the MTC, Mr Kamal Khalfan.\n\nThis is Zimbabwe at its very best. Making a plan and driving it through.\n\nHaving said that, the Board, of which I am a member, has come in for plenty of hefty criticism on many fronts, notably in respect of financials and transparency – and with some justification. At a personal level, I would readily accept that I could have done better.\n\nIn reporting all this, it should be noted – even underscored – that unlike most if not all other racing clubs around the world, the MTC receives next to no revenue from any gambling platforms.\n\nTo run a club without such robust revenue streams is an outstanding result – and the trio of architects who executed this transformation deserve high praise indeed. They are the said Messrs Carter, Dixon, and Buchan.\n\nHowever, times move on and batons must be passed too. Within this process is the need for continuity and transition. There must be no repeats of the cathartic events of 2018 when key players in an entire Board stepped down.\n\nThe club is now moving into a new era – in a much stronger position than it has been for some time. It is accepted that the economics of horse racing are poor – horse numbers are down, trainers, jockeys and owners are thin on the ground, and stakes are very modest. The club is not out of the woods yet, but I do believe we have moved far from the precipice of operational oblivion.\n\nIn the transition process noses can be put out of joint, but change, development, and new energy must come to any Board of Directors.\n\nBeing a Steward is pretty much a poison chalice – where abuse and finger-pointing is largely the norm! Who would want to be one?\n\nThis year we have some 10/11 brave Nominees for Stewardship – coming from all areas of racing. The Rules of the Club require that a third of all Stewards retire each year – providing that adequate replacement numbers are willing to stand for election. The four Stewards standing down this year are myself, Paul Gorringe, Kirsty Stidolph, and former Chairman, Gary Carter. Whilst the latter may have been a tad miffed about his need to step down – largely my fault – it must be restated that Mr Carter navigated the club through some very stormy and rock-strewn waters from 2018, and he should be complimented sincerely for all those efforts and positive outcomes. I do so here and now – unreservedly.\n\nMy own decision to step down and offer myself for re-election was based on my “helicopter view” that we need to ensure that some of the long-standing, current Stewards remain securely in place to ensure proper continuity on future Boards – in the best interests in racing. If Members think I still have something to offer, then they can vote accordingly.\n\nThe six Stewards not required to step down and who remain in place are Messrs Buchan, Beattie, Dixon, Shepherd, De Jong, and Cocksedge.\n\nVoting papers will be distributed shortly by the MTC – via e-mail or WhatsApp. They will list all the nominees whose papers were accepted, and Members will be required to select six (6) candidates for the six vacancies. Proxy votes will also be accepted. All votes will have to be sent or delivered to the MTC accountants, Chapmans, by noon on the 29th of February 2024 – whereupon they will complete the count and deliver the outcome to the outgoing Board of Stewards on the evening of the AGM.\n\nIf you are a Voting Member and do not receive your documents, don’t be shy. Shout up and demand the same from Olivia at the MTC – or me, via Sheldene Chant.\n\nThe Centaurian - 8th February 2024\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nLET’S GET REAL – THE NHRA IS NOT THE TAXMAN\n\nLots of smart accountants make fortunes for themselves and their affluent clients by finding ways to help those clients avoid paying taxes – by legal means. This is substantively different from evading taxes – which is strictly and justifiably illegal and punishable by heavy fines and other harsh sanctions.\n\nOf course, the collection of taxes is made for the benefit of all – well in theory! Roads, hospitals, education, police, etc, etc. – all totally creditable destinations for our taxes – provided they are not diverted through corrupt practices. When tax avoidance is successful, all other taxpayers end up paying a tad more. It all happens at a very impersonal level – nobody knows who is paying less tax than they might or who is paying more than they need.\n\nThe work of the NHRA should not be considered in this same context – though there are those who don’t get the difference.\n\nThe NHRA has been established by the racing industry itself – to police itself. How cool is that? The concept is very simple, the racing industry wants to ensure that horse welfare is paramount, followed very closely by the integrity of the sport where the interests of owners and punters are protected. Fundamentally these key players have only two dangers – trainers and jockeys – these are the only people who can compromise those interests.\n\nIn order to safeguard the integrity of the sport, key players are required to sign up to the rules as developed and published over the decades by the NHRA – they don’t have to but if they want to train or ride there is no choice. In signing up to the rules, they are committing to abiding by them and it presupposes they have actually read those rules.\n\nPenalties for non-adherence are clear. In such instances, the events are intensely personal, everybody knows everybody in racing, so every instance has known collateral damage.\n\nThe foundation of the rules is to ensure that all horses compete on terms that are understood and well-published. We all know about weights, merit ratings, draws, whip rules, medications, etc. etc. It should be straightforward – and I am pleased to say that the very large majority of trainers and jockeys comply with those rules to the letter.\n\nOccasionally mistakes are made – offenders are caught and duly punished. A jockey pitches up overweight, a jockey may use his whip seven times instead of six, or a trainer may not have disposed of a drug residue after a course of treatment in his stable.\n\nAnd why is this so important? Well, it’s simple. As indicated, we all compete on understood and agreed terms. For example, many races are won and lost on small fractions – a short head, a head, a neck, even a length, is just a fraction of a second. So as owners, it is vitally important that the rules are observed. Remember, one or two extra cracks of the whip can get a horse past another – illegally. The temptation to ignore the whip rule is greatest when the purse is highest.\n\nJohn Gosden is a man of great perspicacity and common sense – he says if a jockey is found to have breached the whip rule, he and his mount should lose the race. As a losing owner or punter in such circumstances, I would agree. I would want the winning horse to be disqualified – a fine is not enough for me, nor is a period of a ban for the miscreant jockey. It is the owner and the punter who have been prejudiced and need restitution. It’s all about discipline – I would take no prisoners when it comes to rule-breaking.\n\nNow we come to the more invidious area of doping. In discussions with top UK trainer Mark Johnston, he advised me that not only is Lasix a great mask for other administered drugs, but such is the pace of development of dodgy potions that authorities around the world are struggling to keep up with detection technologies. That situation is seriously worrying. Performance-enhancing drugs and those that stop horses cannot be tolerated at any level – even less so those that kill pain. It is for this reason that I believe folk like Bob Baffert should have been warned off for life and sent to prison. His colt, Medina Spirit, tested positive for the banned substance after winning the 2021 Kentucky Derby – just one of dozens of historical positive dope tests.\n\nTrainer, Jason Servis, was found guilty of a similar drug offence when Maximum Security won the 2020 Saudi Cup – which had a purse of $20 million. He, Jorge Navarro, and 25 others were sent to prison for several years for their involvement in widespread doping activities.\n\nAll these skates adopted doping practices which compromised the chances of all their competitors fulfilling their true potential – records were besmirched, owners lost purses and punters lost fortunes. To add to that, is the validity of the stud book – what do the records of performance really represent now? Jeffrey Archer fiction in all probability.\n\nTo me, the answer needs to be brutal – to deal with what may be happening now and to deter those thinking about pursuing such low-life cheating practices before they do so.\n\nFailure cannot be contemplated as to do so would be to rock the very foundations of a proud and respected industry. If the sentiment begins to develop that racing is rotting to the core then who will buy race horses, who will bet with confidence, and who will want to breed this fine species?\n\nIn the field of doping, we need to be acting and we need to be seen to be acting – right on the ball.\n\nIt remains to be seen what the outcome of the current Trainer Tony Peter affair will be, but for me the NHRA are on point. The investigation process will be complex and thorough – and whilst minor errors will be made – I am confident that the direction of travel is clear and the outcome will be sound.\n\nDespite the rubbish pumped out in the media, it must be said that the NHRA staff, ably led by Mr Integrity, Arnold Hyde, are highly experienced and professional people who do a thankless task with great fortitude and forbearance. We should be grateful that we have such folk in place. Their mission is the same as the vast majority in the southern African racing industry – to protect the integrity of the sport. I believe the industry, particularly owners and punters, fully supports the NHRA and its efforts to succeed in its mission. Find out what has been going on, if anything, then act – acquittal, or maximum sanction, for any rule breached.\n\n27 November 2023\n\n___________________________________\n\nZIMFUN STILL GOING STRONG\n\nWho would have thought? Three years after being conceptualised and initiated, ZimFun Racing Club is still going strong and beginning its fourth season of fun and frivolity.\n\nIts third season proved to be its most successful so far – with Qunetra carrying the Smiley Face colours to considerable success. This Querari gelding, recommended to ZimFun by former Zimbabwean champion trainer, Roy Magner, and the glamorous character of note, Joan Callaghan, ran eleven times in the season to yield three wins, three seconds, and three fourth places – and on one occasion in May pulled off a Class Record for 1800 metres at 108.18 seconds. So a big thanks to trainer Bridget Stidolph and all our jockeys – notably Wes Marwing.\n\nTransparency – the ZimFun watchword. There are no admin or accounting costs in ZimFun – all monies go to securing, keeping and racing its horses. Having said that, a big thanks to ZimFunners, Bev Jack, Jim McDermott and Colin Beattie, for all the effort they put in for free.\n\nWith stake levels where they are it was not possible to show a profit in the year – but the value of leading a winner in or shouting a horse home is immeasurable. Having said that Qunetra did in fact earn $2,375 in stake money, after trainer and jockey % deductions.\n\nThe year began with no horses but a kitty of $4,222.\n\nDuring the year some 83 subscriptions were recorded – giving a capital income of $8,300 – and thus a total operational war chest over the year of $14,897.\n\nThe total procurement cost of Qunetra – including his purchase price, transport to Zim and the paperwork cost $4,101. Training, vet bills, jockey flights and riding fees for the year amounted to $7,906 – giving a total expenditure for the year of $12,007 with a residual carryover sum to start the 2023/24 season of $2,890 (and not forgetting Qunetra!)\n\nWhilst this is a useful and healthy pot, it is not sufficient to sustain another twelve-month campaign.\n\nAccordingly, subscription renewal is vital if ZimFun is to avoid running out of cash and having to dispose of Qunetra.\n\nThere are 153 current subscribers to ZimFun – their past support at just $100 per scrip is very much appreciated. Now is the time to renew that support – and still at just $100 per share – or one glass of wine or beer per week.\n\nPlease contact Bev our much loved and energetic subs Director with your $100 – or multiples thereof. And don’t forget, with Christmas just around the corner, why not buy a share in ZimFun for a family member or friend?\n\nBev Jack – 071 220 8588 or email bevjack100@yahoo.com\n\n29th October 2023\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nLEGENDS ARE MADE OF THIS\n\nHow often do we take things for granted? Too often I would suggest. And here in Zimbabwe next Saturday afternoon, three or more legends and one potential legend come together.\n\nIt’s that time of the year when Delta sponsor one of the most prestigious horse races in Southern Africa – the Castle Tankard – in fact, something which began sixty-three years ago.\n\nThe race is open to all comers, colts, geldings, fillies and mares over the age of three. This year there are fifteen acceptors for the race at one of the finest courses in the world – Borrowdale Park. Racing moved from Belvedere to Borrowdale in 1959 and prospered for many years. More recently the sport has struggled a bit and for a variety of reasons, but supported by a fanatical bunch of stalwarts, the future of racing looks increasingly assured.\n\nForty-seven years ago in 1976, Centaur Syndicate was conceived by legends Peter Lovemore and Robin Bruss and was registered with the Jockey Club. It has raced every year since then but only once has it won the Tankard – 1981 – with the Quintipor colt, The Toff – who became a bit of a legend himself – and was bred by another legend, Geoff Armitage of Sandown Stud, now run by his young son James! Yet to become a legend!\n\nOf the fifteen acceptors for Saturday’s big race there is a hot pot favourite – at even money, Grand Warrior is fancied to win the legendary Tankard in the legendary orange colours of the Centaur Syndicate over 2,000 metres at the legendary Borrowdale Park. To date, the Warrior, who is only a three-year-old, has won all of his five starts and has done so rather convincingly – even the Independence Trophy on April 21st this year when he took on serious open company including some of those he will meet again in this race.\n\nIf my memory serves me correctly, should the Warrior prevail in the Tankard he will be only the second three-year-old to have done so. The only other one I can recall is Matchwinner for PJ Moor in 1986.\n\nGrand Warrior is a very well-bred gelding which cost R160,000 from Ascot Stud in South Africa. He is by Global View who was by the greatest international sire of modern times, the late legend Galileo. His dam is Grand Mary, by Kyllachy who was by Pivotal. The Galileo/Pivotal nick has proved to be very successful – remember St Mark’s Basillica? – multiple Group 1 race winner in Europe as a 3 year old, by Siyouni (by Pivotal) out of the dam Cabaret (by Galileo).\n\nSo the Warrior has the blood and the credentials to date to warrant favouritism – but it’s a tough ask in open company and amongst experienced challengers.\n\nIf he does win, then he will begin to skirt the title of legend – almost – and join a very select group of real legends which, in the Borrowdale years, include Strike it Rich, Circle the Sun, Earl of Surrey and the greatest Zimbabwe bred legend of all time, Ipi Tombe.\n\nSaturday 6th May is the day to witness the creation of history, the convergence of legendary racing elements and the opportunity to see the possible emergence of a new legend – be there, early!\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nTRANSPARENCY & DISCRETION\n\nGreat though Zimbabwe is – I can identify one fault in its character. It is its rumour mill.\n\nIn fact, there is an old and apt adage for Zimbabwe… “If you haven’t heard a rumour by nine o’clock in the morning…. make one up!”\n\nThen when such a rumour hits the press, it becomes “fact”\n\nAnd so it was with the news that the Mashonaland Turf Club was co-funding the review of the Local Development Plan 44.\n\nFake news and utter rubbish.\n\nCertainly, the MTC is interested in the outcome of the review but it has neither the priority nor the funds to be involved at any level other than that of a concerned body or contributor when asked for input.\n\nGENERAL MEETING\n\nThe MTC held a General Meeting last Tuesday afternoon at which matters of great interest to Members were explored and clarified.\n\nWhile some subjects warrant transparency, others demand greater discretion and confidentiality.\n\nUnder the discretion heading is the resolution of some land issues. Suffice to say that all parties are working constructively to arrive at a position where this matter no longer absorbs any management time. Members were fully briefed on this subject.\n\nFully paid-up members were also briefed on relevant issues relating to the club’s liabilities.\n\nOn a more transparent note, Members were well briefed on the progress being made to re-purpose the club’s assets, and in so doing generate a robust revenue stream with which to fund horse racing in perpetuity. Zimbabweans always “make a plan” and in the case of Borrowdale Park there has been excellent progress over the last four years – with rental incomes rising from a paltry $350 per month then to well in excess of $30,000 per month today. The prospects for further growth in this area are very promising. The other positive news is that even the most difficult of tenants are now honouring their financial commitments to the club.\n\nWithin the re purposing bracket is the work which has been undertaken in the largely unused infield area. With the generous assistance of an important club benefactor, the MTC is now growing 21 hectares of potatoes, twice a year. The club is now fourteen months into this project with a positive and material revenue stream forecast for the end of 2023. Apart from benefitting the MTC – this project also provides a popular food product and creates employment opportunities – especially at spud picking time.\n\nNHRA\n\nThe role of the National Horse Racing Authority was discussed in considerable detail. The NHRA is the regulator of all horse racing and provides a variety of services – stipes, handicapping, dope testing, stud book, disciplinary procedures – all aimed at underwriting the integrity of our great sport. However this service comes at a cost – some $46,000 per year. Without this regulator in place no “proper” racing can take place at Borrowdale Park. For example, this means SA jockeys can’t ride at Borrowdale Park, trainers cannot be adequately managed and dope testing cannot take place. In short, I would stop racing at Borrowdale Park – many others would stop too, trainers would shut up shop and horse racing as we know it would stop.\n\nFor me, it’s a no brainer, we pay up or shut down.\n\nFinding the funds to pay up is another story!\n\nBROADCASTS\n\nConsiderable discussion took place over the issue of broadcasting racing – or should I say lack of it. In short, we don’t yet have the funds to upgrade our video equipment and 4Racing in RSA are not prepared to screen the quality of images we can supply. They have pulled the plug on both Zimbabwe and Kenya. Whilst revenues from betting remain a tiny contribution to overheads the financial impact is not great, but for owners – especially those based outside Zimbabwe – it is a big deal. In recognition of this reality, the Board of Stewards will be exploring other avenues to correct this important omission in its product offer.\n\nThe club presented its Annual Report and Financial Statements for Member consideration but deferred such consideration to a meeting scheduled for Tuesday 7th June.\n\nBeing a Steward is considered a bit of a poison chalice, however, despite this label, four new Stewards were elected to the Board vis: Duncan Cocksedge, Gary De Jong, Richard Beattie and Chris Shepherd.\n\nIn conclusion, Members were reminded that whilst stakes may appear rather dire, greater scrutiny would suggest things are not quite as bad as may first appear. If we say it costs $6,000 a year to keep a horse in training and we have say 100 such horses to pay for, total variable costs amount to $600,000 per annum. Excluding big sponsors races, current MTC purses amount to circa $150,000 – giving a 25% chance of breaking even as an owner. If we add in circa $150,000 from sponsors the equation generates a 50% chance of breaking even – albeit a tad concentrated to a couple of owners. No other racing centre gets anywhere near either of these values.\n\nFor me this was an important meeting – the balancing of confidentiality and transparency was achieved – and in so doing a much-merited criticism of the MTC Board of Stewards was addressed – at least for the time being!\n\nAnd the rumour mill was starved of mischievous gossip.\n\n10th April 2023\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nMAGNIER MAGIC\n\nI don’t know the man, I have never met him. He transformed the world of horse breeding and his work is not yet complete … huh? His success could have been self-defeating but no, it just took him to an even more superior level of performance and craftsmanship. I would not be surprised if it was shown that he could walk on water.\n\nFor some time now, I have that John Magnier (74) is an equine Michelangelo.\n\nIt was he and the Coolmore team that launched Galileo into the breeding world with such dramatic success – and I hardly need to list the progeny (e.g. Frankel) that fill stables and Group rated winning enclosures across the world. And it is both fillies and colts. Awesome from every perspective.\n\nBut I don’t want to dwell on the past success, save to say that it is now the progeny of Magnier’s perspicacity that fill the breeding barns globally and cause stud managers to ponder “where next – which stallions?”\n\nFor many independent breeders, eyes look towards Dubawi from Godolphin or his well performed progeny – of which there are many – but not so the Maestro. John Magnier’s insights, skills and empathy with all things equine has taken him to other options such as No Nay Never, Scat Daddy and Deep Impact (sadly deceased)\n\nThis is not a definitive work on breeding but how shrewd and full of insight was John Magnier to choose to put Rhododendron to Deep Impact (a totally outbreeding cross), the late stallion who was Champion Sire in Japan from 2012 to 2021 – to produce a colt, Auguste Rodin?\n\nTrained, as ever, by another genius, Aidan O’Brien, Auguste Rodin has had a very impressive start to his career, winning three of his four starts. His final success was the Vertem Futurity Trophy Stakes at Doncaster in October 2022 – and run in heavy, really testing going over a mile.\n\nSo what? Well, this was the race which would signal a great future for Motivator, Authorised, St Nicholas Abbey, Camelot, Kingsbarn, Saxon Warrior, Kameko and MacSwiney – amongst many other stars which also won this race.\n\nIt is hardly surprising then that, as we speak, Auguste Rodin is 11/4 favourite for the 2023 Epsom Derby. But what is surprising, the next best price is Al Riffa at 12/1. The punting world believe they have spotted something special and I suspect they are right.\n\nSo what has all this got to do with Southern Africa? Answer, Rhododendron has a full brother, at Bush Hill Stud in South Africa. Flying the Flag and full sisters Rhododendron and Magical are bred in the purple. By Galileo out of the Pivotal mare Halfway to Heaven. Whilst his racing career may not have been spectacular with only three wins and two places from fourteen starts, he did run just six lengths off Ruler of the World in the 2013 Epsom Derby.\n\nFlying the Flag has not had the greatest support at stud – even though his stud fee is a modest R5,000. I wonder if that will change if and when Auguste Rodin wins the best race in the world, the 2023 Epsom Derby confined to three year old colts and run over a mile and a half at the beginning of June. Exciting times, again.\n\n11 January 2023\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\nTHE BIGGER PICTURE AND BROADER PERSPECTIVE\n\nSome time ago I wrote about the relative economics of horse racing around the world so I thought I might revisit the numbers to see if much had changed – have a look at the facts I have uncovered below – based on the most recent data available\n\nUK – 2019\n\n14,000 horses in training\n\ncosting circa £25,000 per year each – or more\n\ntotal variable costs circa £350, 000,000 – or more\n\ntotal purses £161,000 000 – but of which is owner’s entry fees are 15%\n\nso net purses of £136,000,000\n\nCost recovery percentage 38%\n\n(source: Racecourse Association: 15th August 2022)\n\nSouth Africa – 2020/21\n\n5,400 horses in training\n\ncosting circa R130,000 per year each – training and vet bills\n\ntotal variable costs R702,000,000\n\ntotal purses R 248,000,000\n\nCost recovery percentage 35%\n\n(source: me and NHRA of South Africa: August 2022)\n\nZimbabwe – 2021/22\n\n140 horses in training\n\ncosting circa $5,400 per year each – say $450 per month\n\ntotal variable costs circa $756,000\n\ntotal MTC purses circa $190,000\n\ntotal sponsorship circa $120,000\n\ntotal purses $310,000\n\nCost recovery percentage 41%\n\n(source: me and provisional MTC data: August 2022)\n\nThe cold facts are a bit of a revelation don’t you think? In the year just closed, the data shown above indicates that Zimbabwe offers the best cost recovery percentage of the three nations listed. In fact it performs a 6% better recovery rate than South Africa – or it did then.\n\nAlso not included is the horse appearance fee of $50 for up to sixth place – adding further to our racing recovery rate.\n\nSo if you want to go racing, Zimbabwe is the place.\n\nHaving said that, I have to admit that due to cash flow considerations, the timely payment of purses has not been too good – this detracts from the picture I have painted and begs the question about the future, will cash flow continue to be an issue?\n\nIf you read my last column you will gather that we face a difficult six months ahead but by the time we get to March 2023, with potato crops and other initiatives permitting, a trading breakeven or surplus position will have emerged – with enhanced stakes too.\n\nWith a bit of erosion in horse numbers following the departure of Gokhan Terzi and the closure of his yard plus the improvement in purse levels which are predicted – the cost recovery percentage is set to get even better – despite some rising costs.\n\nWith this in mind, I can commend the idea of replacing older horses of your string or to augment it with youngsters from all the South African sources available to us.\n\nZim trainers were in Joburg last week and bought seven nice-looking two-year-olds – they will be on their way up shortly.\n\nThe next sale will be a Ready to Run consignment in November – please make a plan to be there. For example, Bugatti Blue was bought on just such a sale six years ago. He has now won ten races with 26 places – but only cost R30,000 – that’s how to do it!\n\n1st September2022\n\nPhotograph by Zimbabwe Equine News: Cutback. This filly was bought online in June 2020 for R6000, and has won several races, including the Zimbabwe2000 (GR3), at Borrowdale Park.\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\nTHE CURATE’S EGG\n\nAs I sat down to write a review of the 2021 to 2022 racing season just closed, I realised it had been a bit like the Curate’s Egg – parts of it were excellent. Of course, this means that other parts were less so.\n\nWith support from Sheldene Chant and Jackie Cocksedge, we have tried to communicate and inform all stakeholders about events and issues at Borrowdale Park – but in truth I have to say that, generally speaking, ‘coms’ from and about the MTC have not been very good. As a consequence, the rumour mill has been rife all year and since rumours tend to be negative, the impact on racing has been negative too.\n\nEfforts are now in hand to correct communications from the Board of Stewards – so watch this space.\n\nWithin the orbit of ‘coms’ is the issue of accounts – MTC members know we are running a long way behind. Again the Board of Stewards are making good progress in this regard and November should see matters brought back into order or very close to it.\n\nIt is also the case that the economics of racing have, on the face of it, deteriorated with stake monies a fraction of what they used to be. Disappointing as this clearly is for all of us, the harsh realities of persistent revenue stream compression were always going to hit us one day. That it has taken 40 years of trading losses at Borrowdale Park to get to this point is a great credit to those who have gone before. It may be argued that previous administrations might have done more long term strategic planning to put the sport on a better financial platform, but what is the point? We are where we are.\n\nWith rumours and economic stress has come erosion in the numbers of owners, trainers and horses. The new season will see some notable absences – I regret this more than I can say.\n\nThen we have had the continuing impact of Covid 19 – months of operational constriction to confound, frustrate and irritate the hell out of all racing stakeholders.\n\nBut I am optimistic – and I refuse to believe that my optimism is misplaced or misguided\n\nFirstly, it is a fact that we have one of the finest race courses in the world – I miss the 1400m straight, and we need new tractors and some other operational kit and maybe new starting stalls – but if we were to try to replace what we have, not only would it cost millions but it would be an economic non-starter.\n\nThen we have the guys who manage the course, master farmer Gyles Dorward, Andy and the rest of the team. These are dedicated and highly effective superstars for the turf. We are blessed to have such resources.\n\nLet us not understate the quality and dedication of our bespoke training community. Debra Swanson, Vanessa Birketoft, Bridget Stidolph, Thomas Mason and Amy Bronkhorst – are a huge credit to their profession – we are lucky to have them too.\n\nLocal jockey Nobert Takawira has repeatedly shown visiting South African jockeys a clean pair of heals and is to be greatly commended (just needs to eat less sadza!) And the visiting riders are both welcome and a credit to their professions.–That they like coming to Borrowdale also says something important about our sport here.\n\nWe must not forget the huge contribution that the NHRA makes to the integrity of racing in Zimbabwe – again we are blessed to have this important resource in place, plus the support of Mr Integrity, Arnold Hyde, at the helm.\n\nNot much is said about our other physical resources but it is plain to see just what progress has been made and is being planned for retail potential at Borrowdale Park. Three or four years ago rental incomes stood at around $300 per month – today that revenue stream exceeds $20,000+ per month with further growth in the pipeline – probably taking us past $30,000 per month by next year at this time – if not before..\n\nIn addition to this there are other more modest revenue streams such as Subscriptions, ADMA, and Burn-outs.\n\nThen there are spuds – the repurposing of our in-field resources. It looks like we are on course to producing two cycles of 17 hectares each year. The financial projections, based on reasonable yields and attainable market prices, suggest an annual income for the MTC of circa $180,000 per annum (after capex repayments) from about March next year – call it $15,000 per month.\n\nThere are other cunning plans afoot – but more about those in a future column.\n\nIn summary, the MTC is heading for a monthly income of circa $50,000 per month – maybe not tomorrow – but in the very foreseeable future – it is all within touching distance.\n\nTo put this into some sort of context, it costs us about $30,000 per month to run the club, which means that – if we exclude stake monies (OK I hear you!) – the MTC is on course to be breaking even at the operational level, for the first time in those 40 years I mentioned earlier.\n\nMoreover, we are on course for an operating surplus of about $20,000 per month which equates to the equivalent of $1,700 in stake money per race for two race meeting per month for 10 months. Put another way, that is around $900 for a win or two months training fees.\n\nOf course I have yet to mention the big Sponsors – Delta and OK – and some smaller ones too. We have done really, really well to re-engage with these important contributors to our industry. Collectively these sponsors add over $100,000 to our revenue streams – most of which goes to owners.\n\nAnd all this has been achieved without the benefit of the Lotto or much by way of gambling revenue.\n\nFor my part, I feel I could have done more to help the MTC and the sport I am passionate about. In that context I would like to thank both historic and current financial benefactors of Borrowdale Park. Without your contributions the club would now be some sort of upmarket housing estate and Zimbabwe would be much the poorer for it – racing at Borrowdale is an irreplaceable National Treasure to be protected at all costs. Quite how we will get to meet our obligations to current benefactors remains unclear – but I feel their investment is safe – a bit buried maybe, but safe.\n\nThis is why I and Centaur Syndicate will be at the Jo’burg sale of 2-year-olds next week. Come too.\n\n19 August 2022\n\n___________________________________________________________________\n\nWAS IT BROKEN?\n\nAs a dyed-in-the-wool philogynist – I was surprised to learn that, out of the blue, lady jockeys in Southern Africa are going to be afforded 1.5kg weight allowances – because they are ladies.\n\nThen I went on to read about the reasons for this change which implies ladies are lesser beings than men.\n\nIn making such decisions we must ask ourselves “What outcomes are we seeking to achieve by making such a sex allowance?”\n\nAre ladies less able jockeys than men – do we need to level up the playing field a bit? Well no – as Hollie Doyle and many other jockettes around the world amply testify.\n\nAre we short of jockeys – do we need to find a way to encourage more candidates to join the sport? Well no – as a good number of existing jockeys will testify – many just can’t secure enough rides and thus struggle to make a reasonable living.\n\nAre there some conditions associated with becoming a jockey which are prejudicial to women? Well no – and if there are, they should be removed – giving a sex allowance is not the answer.\n\nFor me the system was never broken so why are we trying to fix it? – and in a way which makes lady jockeys into second-class citizens when, in fact, equine sports around the world allow ladies to compete on level terms with men, something which should be applauded – not messed around with. Apart from snooker and darts, equine sports allow us to recognise the real potential of our ladies.\n\nAnd if the real reason for providing a sex allowance for ladies is to see a lot more female jockeys riding, then another option is far more equitable. As we all know, ladies are typically smaller and lighter than men – what we should be doing is to address the issue of minimum riding weights. I have always favoured keeping minimum riding weight at 46 kg. If we went back to that, and did a bit of constructive promotional work, I think we could achieve the results sought by the intervention and, in addition, we would create many more opportunities for horses to race competitively – with a handicap weight spread from 46kg to 60kg – or even higher – thus reducing the occasions where horses compete under MR sufferance.\n\nCome on lady jockeys – do the right thing, and do not support this nonsense\n\nBy way of a postscript – I asked a well-known local lady trainer, the one with the Bart Simpson laugh, what she thought about sex allowances for lady jockeys? “Ahh – three times a week should be enough!” she replied.\n\n25 July 2022\n\nZimFun Interest in Sunday’s Irish 1000 Guineas\n\nZimFunners were sorely disappointed that Mise En Scene was not able to run in the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket earlier in the month. She had a temperature on the morning of the race and was scratched.\n\nFate can be a cruel thing. The race was won by Cachet which had just touched off Mise En Scene in the Fillies Classic last year. On that occasion I thought Cieron Fallon the jockey had got going a bit late – it wasn’t going to happen again. Although it is academic now, I think she could have won that race.\n\nHopefully, the ZimFun interest has fully recovered and is ready to do her best in Sunday’s Irish 1000 Guineas to be run at The Curragh in Ireland. As fourth favourite, and at 8 to 1 now, it’s not a bad price.\n\nFavourite for the race is Tuesday – by Galileo out of Lilly Langtry. She ran a couple of lengths off Cachet at Newmarket – so if I am right about Mise En Scene, Tuesday will be beaten again. My own assessment is that Tuesday needs a bit more ground but who am I to argue with trainer Aiden O’Brien!\n\nAs ever, Aiden is mob-handed in the race with four acceptances. Third favourite is History – also by the late Galileo out of the Showcasing mare, Prize Exhibit and so comes with a bit more speed in its bloodline than co-runner Tuesday. My concern about History is that all her form is in Ireland – so we can’t be sure if her two wins and two places to date were in comparable company to that she will encounter on Sunday. From a betting point of view I would err on the side of caution for all the Ballydoyle string.\n\nMy big concern hails from the yard of Dermot Weld. Homeless Song (rubbish name) is perfectly bred. By Frankel and out of a Dubawi mare (Joalliere) – a mile to 10 furlongs should be perfect for her. To date, she has only run over 7 furlongs (1400 metres) and has won two of her four starts – and again only in Ireland – and on both occasions she beat current 12 to 1 shot Agartha from the Joseph O’Brien yard. So the form is a bit thin – mmmm – but that is awesome breeding.\n\nMise En Scene is the only horse in this group to have gotten close to Inspiral – perhaps the best three-year-old filly around at the moment – even though we have yet to see this four-time winner on the track this season. Inspiral is by Frankel and creamed the Fillies Mile at Newmarket last year – beating all the good ‘uns easily. Had she been running on Sunday she would have been odds on favourite. On that basis – and assuming Mise En Scene is fully recovered from her earlier setback – I give the ZimFun filly a wonderful chance\n\nFinally I will mention Purplepay which was bred in France (home of star photographer Laurent Viguie!) and has only raced in that country – eight times for 3 wins and 4 places over a mile to nine furlongs. Clearly she is a seasoned campaigner. The fact that she is now trained by star Yorkshireman, William Haggas, and he has opted to send her to Ireland should tell us a lot. The filly is by Zarak – that might not mean a great deal to you – until I tell you that this stallion is out of the star super mare and racehorse, Zarkava. Remember her? You should do. She ran 7 times and won the lot – including the Group 1s, Prix Vermeille, Prix Diane, Poule d’Essai, Marcel Boussac and the Arc.\n\nTen other fillies go to post in the Irish 1000 Guineas but I am confident that the winner will come from the five I have mentioned – with Mis En Scene running a tight race to the winning post with Purplepay in second place.\n\nLet’s hope nothing untoward occurs between now and race day – no late scratching please!\n\nHOOFNOTE 1\n\nThe Irish 2000 Guineas will be run on Saturday. Take out a big mortgage, sell the children, pawn the family silver and max out the overdraft and pile into Native Trail – OK its 4/11 ON – but I would have to eat hay with a donkey if he doesn’t cream it.\n\nHOOFNOTE 2\n\nDon’t forget to tell all your racing pals that the NHRA meeting scheduled for Saturday 21st May at 12.30 pm has been POSTPONED – if you forget, go have some lunch at Hops & Horses, I can recommend the prawns.\n\nHOOFNOTE 3\n\nFinally, if you want to have a share in a horse running in the Irish Classic on Sunday – buy a share in ZimFun – what’s $100? – with no further charges – equal to a beer or class of white per week – it’s a no brainer. Contact Bev Jack on bevjack100@yahoo.com\n\n19th May 2022\n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nNHRA VISIT POSTPONED -The NHRA team will not be at Borrowdale Park this weekend (May 21st and 22nd, 2022). The visit has been postponed until a that has date yet to be advised.\n\nNHRA Visiting Zimbabwe Soon\n\nFour key personnel from the NHRA are scheduled to visit Borrowdale Park over the weekend of the re-scheduled Zimbabwe Derby – from the 20th to 23rd May.\n\nThe party consists of Chief Executive, Vee Moodley; Racing Control Executive, Arnold Hyde; Ms Hazel Kayiya from the Stud Book Department, and Lennon Maharaj the Chief Handicapper.\n\nIn addition to briefing the Board of Stewards on matters of concern to them, the NHRA party are eager to meet all other stakeholders to brief them on matters of mutual interest and take questions from the floor.\n\nThe final detail of the meetings are yet to be agreed upon and agendas received but all stakeholders, that is owner and trainers, should make a note in their diaries to attend Park View on Saturday 21st at 12.30 pm. If there is a variation on this provisional plan, efforts will be made to notify all concerned – so watch this space next week when I will know more.\n\nThis is a very important visitation – please make an effort to be there – how often do we get the heavies coming to visit us en masse? Rarely, if ever.\n\nApart from being briefed first-hand, it will give us all an opportunity to thank the NHRA for all the excellent work they do and for the substantial economic benefits the Mashonaland Turf Club receives from being within the NHRA scope of activity. Believe me, it is vitally important to us.\n\nHOOFNOTE 1\n\nWith regard to the NHRA – its efforts successfully prevents the sort of rubbish that has been going on in the USA for years!\n\nFor example, according to a treasure trove of wiretaps, the US government has produced evidence and implicating testimony from plea-bargaining defendants (who are already imprisoned) against the disgraced trainer Jason Servis which alleges that he doped almost all the horses under his control in early 2019 – including Maximum Security – who crossed the finishing line first in the Group 1 Kentucky Derby (but was later disqualified for in race interference)\n\nUnbelievable.\n\nIf found guilty he should be locked up with the other dodgy character Bob Baffert – after consideration of gelding!\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nTAKING IT ON THE NOSE\n\nThe highs of being involved with horse racing are incredibly intense – probably on a par with a wedding night! And I have had several of such!\n\nBut the lows can be very deep and dark.\n\nTo be a serious player in this sport you have to be able to cope with the latter well – and the truth is that there are far more downs than ups – though the latter more than make up for the former.\n\nLast week was a week of downs.\n\nAfter a month of careful studying and wide consultation, the stage was set for bidding on the National Yearling Sales in Johannesburg. I thought it was a tough catalogue for Zim bidders – finding decent prospects for Zim at prices which were realistic for our circumstances – where the minimum bid was R50,000. In short, I was blown away on all those on my short list and came away with zilch – apart from sore eyes and backside from watching sixteen hours of online trading. The next opportunity will be in August at the sale of two-year-olds.\n\nHaving said all that, well done to the SA breeding industry – it was a strong sale with a top price of R3.3 million for a good looking Silvano colt (Forest God) out of a high-quality dam line. Vercingetorix featured robustly too with four progeny in the top ten priced yearlings – each making over a million Rand. Gimmethegreenlight stock averaged the highest price of R703,243.\n\nThe next disappointment came in the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket. ZimFun has an interest in a wonderful filly Mise En Scene – which ran a length fourth in the Fillies Classic over a mile at Newmarket last year – just behind Cachet! I fancied her very strongly but on the morning of the race, trainer James Ferguson scratched her as she was running a high temperature.\n\nI also fancied Kommetdieding in the Champions Challenge over 2,000m at Turfontein – this is a superstar colt and was ridden by one of the finest and most talented jockeys on the planet, Gavin Lerena. What could possibly go wrong? Well it did and the pair ran fifth, some four lengths of the winner, Astrix (by Vercingetorix – that name again) from the Paul Peter yard.\n\nFinally, as a staunch Zimbabwean I was hoping beyond hope that Borrowdale Champion filly, Dindingwe might shine in the Gerald Rosenburg, also at Turffontein on Saturday. Effectively giving 8- time winner and Triple Tiara champion, Rain in Holland (by Duke of Marmalade), some 12 kg advantage, the task was always going to be daunting – and so it proved. Dindingwe finished down the field in this weight-for-age event. If we try to find some solace in the result, let me just observe that, in my book, 12kgs represents over 20 lengths in a handicap. Dindingwe finished 15 lengths off the winner. It would be good to see her have a go at a handicap race next – and over 2000m +. A serious high might ensue.\n\nBut well tried the connections.\n\nSo a weekend of disappointments. However, we carry on and now focus on the Castle Tankard to be run at Borrowdale Park on Saturday 7th May. Well done to Delta for renewing its sponsorship of this important race for the continent of Africa. And the excitement is building – punctuated by a Card Call on Thursday evening at 6.00 p.m. – a bit like a wedding night, the anticipation is pretty special too!\n\nPark View, 5th May – 6.00 p.m. – BE THERE – and if you don’t know the rules of a Card Call, explanations will be given!\n\n3 May 2022\n\n___________________________________________________________________\n\nZimFun – 1000 Guineas at Newmarket On Sunday\n\nHorse racing is an amazing sport of great highs and deep lows. For me, it is the greatest of all sports, combining, as it does, the respective skills and talents of breeders, trainers and jockeys with the most majestic of animals on the planet, the thoroughbred racehorse. Which other sport can claim such a challenge – I can’t think of one – certainly not bull fighting.\n\nThis morning ZimFun heard that its valiant race mare, Centre Stage, had ruptured a tendon and in so doing, ended her racing career. She had run second in her last two outings and was on target for a win, soon. This is a huge disappointment for the 100+ shareholders in the ZimFun Racing Club but one we all know can happen from time to time.\n\nWhilst we shall all reflect on what might have been, our minds can thankfully turn to more positive thoughts.\n\nZimFun has a leg in a UK horse that is going to feature in the second Classic race of the British racing season – the One Thousand Guineas, over a mile, at Newmarket on Sunday, 1st May. Yes that one! How exciting is that?\n\nZimFun was established to focus on racing at Borrowdale Park, augment racehorse numbers here, bring folk back into the sport and to enable newbies the opportunity to get involved with racing for the modest investment of just US$100 (ideally per year). It’s been running for almost two years, and I feel it has been a great success and has fully lived up to its name – Zimbabwean bred FUN. We have had half a dozen runners in Zim and picked up several wins and multiple places.\n\nIt’s stature expanded when a share in two Australian horses were donated to the club and as generous benefactors bought shares in two British horses for us, Create Belief – now in foal to Zoustar, and our Sunday runner,\n\nMise En Scene is by Siyouni (Pivotal) out of the Galileo mare, Gadfly – which gives her the parallel breeding to last season’s superstar colt, St Mark’s Basilica. He won six of his nine starts – including the Group 1 Coral Eclipse at Sandown and the Group 1 Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown. And then there was the great Sottsass that creamed the 2020 Arc at Longchamp, Paris. This is about a Pivotal line sire with Galileo line mares – a super nick. Mise En Scene is bred on exactly the same principle.\n\nLast year, as a two-year-old she had four runs. She won her maiden at Haydock over 7 furlongs (1400m) then went on to pick up a Group 3 win at Goodwood in the Prestige Stakes – again over 7 furlongs.\n\nNext she took on Inspiral (former Guineas favourite) in the Group 1 Fillies Mile at Newmarket where she ran a good fourth, but finishing fast under Cieron Fallon (who rides her again on Sunday)\n\nShe was invited to the Breeders Cup meeting at Del Mar in November of last year – but being drawn 13 of 14 on these rubbish American toy tracks meant she didn’t have a prayer – she finished down the field.\n\nMise En Scene is a seriously good filly and I expect to her to acquit herself well on Sunday – but it will be no walk in the park. This is a top race with top-class competition. Notably she has to take on two Aiden O’Brien fillies – and we all know how good a trainer he is!\n\nRace favourite is Tenebrism (Caravaggio) out of the Pivotal mare Immortal Verse. She won both her sprint races last year, including the Group 1 Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket. She has yet to challenge a tough mile – and Newmarket is very tough – the last furlong or so is rising ground.\n\nO’Brien’s other runner, Tuesday, is very interesting indeed. She is a full-sister to the super horse Minding (Galileo) out of Lilly Langtry – which won nine of her thirteen starts in 2015 to 2017 including the Guineas, Oaks, the Nassau and the QEII stakes at Ascot. If Tuesday is as good then it will be all over bar the shouting – but the word is she is a) probably not quite ready and b) is more likely to be an Oaks horse.\n\nAnother serious challenger is Homeless Songs (dreadful name) by Frankel out of a Dubawi mare, Joailliere. This is perfect breeding for me. But we really don’t know how good she is as she has only raced in Ireland. Having said that, Dermott Weld is a fine trainer and he wouldn’t be sending out a time waster!\n\nOthers in with a shout are Discoveries (by Mastercraftsmen), Malavath (by Mehmas) and Zellie (by Wootton Bassett)\n\nTrainer James Ferguson reports that Mise En Scene is primed to perfection for the challenge and Cieron Fallon is a talented young jockey who has ridden her once – in the Fillies Classic where he left it a bit late – it won’t happen again.\n\nSo it going to be very exciting on Sunday – 4.40 pm Zimbabwe time.\n\nOne hundred plus ZimFun shareholders will be watching and shouting her home.\n\nNow is the time to be part of the action – with four days to go every reader can get part of the action and have a runner in one of the world’s greatest Classics races – first run in 1814. How amazing is that?\n\nHow do you do that? Well, it is easy – shares are just $100 each – and no further charges. Email ZimFun Shareholders’ Director – the famous Bev Jack on bevjack100@yahoo.com and give her your details, then either make a plan to hand over your dollars or make a pledge to pay her.\n\nHistory could very well be in the making for Zimbabwe and all fun lovers of racing – be part of it.\n\nHOOFNOTE\n\nAlso, look out for Zim Star Dindingwe (MR97) (60kg) on Saturday coming – the Gerald Rosenberg Stakes over 2000m.\n\nI again wish her “bon chance” but it’s a tough task, there are some smart cookies in this field, and she is way out at the weights – especially with hot favourite, Rain in Holland (MR 118) (58.5kg). Basically, Dindingwe is giving the 3-year-old Duke of Marmalade filly a 12 kg advantage!\n\nBut go Dindingwe, go!\n\n28 April 2022\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\nSIZE MATTERS WITH THE DERBY IN MIND\n\nWhen Pheidippides ran from the site Marathon to Athens in 490 BC with news of an important Greek victory over an invading Persian army – a distance of circa 40 kilometres – and promptly dropped down dead, he would have had no idea that 2400 years later there would be a race introduced at the 1896 Olympics in Athens to commemorate his dramatic efforts.\n\nThe Marathon distance has been formalised at 26.2 miles for over a century. Any other distance is not a Marathon. The only variation is a Half Marathon – 13.1 miles.\n\nThe Epsom Derby Stakes is a Group 1 flat race for three-year-old colts and fillies and is run over a mile and half (2400 metres). It was first run in 1780 – 242 years ago. It is correctly called a Classic – think of the legendary winners in our life time – vis: Nijinsky, Mill Reef, Roberto, The Minstrel, Shirley Heights, Shergar, Nashwan, Generous, Galileo, Sea the Stars, Camelot, Australia, Golden Horn ….and last year Adyar.\n\nIt really is the Blue Riband of the turf and the winner requires and reflects an exceptional horse, a talented trainer and a skilful jockey, and because of this it is Britain’s most prestigious horse race and carries the richest purse.\n\nThe winning horse requires a bloodline that carries just the right balance of speed, stamina and physique – and thus is a major challenge to the breeding industry. Getting a horse to peak for this test – in the first week of June – requires enormous perception and understanding from a trainer. To get a mount to cross the finishing line in first place requires a jockey with a talent for judging pace and fractions to perfection and the experience to know precisely when to press the “go” button and drive his horse into that anaerobic sphere of galloping where lactic acid build up in the equine muscles can stop a horse in its tracks if he gets it wrong.\n\nFor me, this is indeed the ultimate test of a horse and the ultimate challenge for an owner. All other races and distances are but sideshows for the main event.\n\nFor me, the name Derby carries the same or more prestige as the name Marathon. Sadly many racing authorities around the world don’t get this. Many have races called “Derby” which are anything but – they are simply not 2400m and not always confined to three-year-olds. It’s a bit like calling a 15 mile run a Marathon – it might be a long way but it’s not a Marathon!\n\nThank goodness the Americans can’t speak English properly and call their non-Derbys – Durbys! As for the rest of the world, they might as well give their short distance, non-Derby races such names as Scunthorpe, Penistone, Clitheroe or even Grimethorpe – ‘cos they certainly aren’t Derbys.\n\nIt pleases me no end that, despite all the challenges which have faced the Zimbabwean racing industry over the last forty years, we still have a proper Derby here at Borrowdale Park – and it is to be run this coming weekend – Sunday 24th April. Whilst we still don’t have a sponsor for this Classic race and whilst the field sizes are relatively small – 7 runners nominated this year, believe me, this is the best race of the year and invariably produces an exciting finish. Be there.\n\n19 April 2022\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nA TRICKY DECISION\n\n“…don’t get carried away with Zim form…”\n\nAlthough I had been steeped in horse racing from my early days, it wasn’t until I got involved with Centaur Syndicate in 1976 that I really got to grips with the reality of the sport and all its intricacies.\n\nMy mentor in those formative years was another Centaur member, the late Raymond Schur. He knew plenty and he taught me plenty. He became a really good pal and was taken far too early in his life.\n\nOne of our first good horses was called The Toff – bred by the legendary Geoff Armitage of Sandown Stud at Trelawny. The Toff won many races including the most important race at Borrowdale – The Derby – and then other decent races such as the Tankard, Pat Fallon and the Zimbabwe 2000. Then there came a point in time when we had to decide if he had any future in Zimbabwe or if we should try a campaign in South Africa.\n\nRaymond Schur proffered a sage opinion. “If you feel you want to race in South Africa, then your horse must win in the A Division in Zimbabwe, he must win carrying top weight and he must do so in record time.”\n\nWhat Raymond was saying was, don’t get carried away with Zimbabwean form – the standard in South Africa is at least a level higher than here. Centaur sold The Toff to South Africa, and he did OK – perhaps his best race was his first or second run there – when he beat Cape Derby winner, Secret Service (trained by Syd Laird?), over a mile. He ran in the Holiday Inns, the Durban July and a few Gold Cups – with little success – before coming back to Zim to return to form with a win in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes over 2400 metres.\n\nThe overall standard of horses in Zimbabwe back then was a whole heap higher than it is now.\n\nMy next serious opportunity to send a horse to South Africa came in 2009 – almost 30 years later! Earl of Surrey had won 6 of his first 7 races at Borrowdale, including the Triple Crown – and was second in the Republic Cup. Lisa Harris felt he was good enough to take on South Africa. So I agreed to send him – the rest is history – I think he was the only Zim horse to win a Group 1 since Ipi Tombe – the Golden Horse Casino over 1200m on 30th May 2009. The Earl won 7 races and was placed 3 times in serious SA races to take his career tally to 21 wins.\n\nIn recent years a number of other horses have made huge reputations in Zimbabwe – three of four come to mind, Solinski, Lily Blue, Dindingwe and Call the Wind. But if they were mine, would I send them to South Africa?\n\nI commend and admire ambition – every good horse should have every chance to fulfil its potential – and by definition, that means racing in South Africa. I did own a fetlock of Solinski but it was decided not to send her south – until she went to stud. Lily Blue is another Armitage horse – this time owned by the ladies associated with the Gin’ll Fix It Syndicate.\n\nShe won 7 of her first 13 starts including the Zimbabwe Guineas and seemed to be on an impressive upward form curve. She was sent to Maestro Matchett in SA who campaigned her correctly in handicaps and Pinnacle Plates – where she picked up just two wins. Lily Blue came back to Zimbabwe last year and now seems set to cream some or all of the big races at Borrowdale Park this year. It really is excellent to see this star back amongst us – even though she was far from a star in SA.\n\nThe latest horse to go south is Dindingwe – I don’t need to remind readers what a revelation this horse was last year. The owners have considered all the parameters to arrive at this decision – and I wish Dindingwe every success in South Africa – but I wouldn’t have sent her!\n\nWith two big, sponsored races on the horizon at Borrowdale Park, the Tankard and the OK Grand Challenge, I think I would have waited to win one or both of these races, then made a decision. But then that is just me!\n\nThe other points I would make are – Borrowdale always needs stars and legends – I don’t like to see them go – also Borrowdale needs to do everything it can to maintain and enhance horse numbers – these moves don’t help the big picture.\n\nBut to reiterate, please let Dindingwe prove me totally wrong – bon chance!\n\n14 April 2022\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nZIMFUN STEPS UP THE PACE\n\nThrough the generosity of a ZimFun shareholder, the club now has an interest in another horse which is racing in the UK – AND WHAT A HORSE!\n\nZimFun is now a part-owner of MISE EN SCENE – a three-year-old, Group 3 winning filly by Siyouni (by Pivotal) out of the Galileo mare, Gadfly (half-sister of Speciosa) – and she is entered for the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket in early May. She is bred on very similar lines to two of the great champions of recent years vis: the 2020 Arc winner, Scottsass and the 2021 unbeaten dual Classic winner, St Mark’s Basilica.\n\nIn 2021, Mise En Scene (above) won her Maiden at Haydock before going on to the cream, the Group 3 Prestige Stakes at Goodwood in August. Her next challenge was the Group 1 Fillies Mile at Newmarket in October, where she came up against the unbeaten daughter of Frankel – Inspiral, from the John Gosden yard. She ran on well into fourth and I think she will do better than that in the Guineas in May.\n\nHer fourth run was at Delmar, in the Breeders Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf over a mile – yes – she is thought to be that good! Being drawn 10 she basically had no chance on this course – so best put a line across that form – even though she was just four lengths off the winner when 10th.\n\nThe addition of MISE EN SCENE to the ZimFun string brings much excitement to the Club’s 100+ shareholders as she joins Create Belief now at stud in the UK – and in foal to Australian super stallion Zoustar. Then we have interests in Greatness Awaits and Night Shift, actually racing in Australia. Here in Zim we have 3-year-old gelding Cosmic Rush (Wylie Hall) – a live Zim Derby hope; the speedy Jardin – who has already won for us – then the gutsy Deposition – who has won twice for us, and finally Centre Stage.\n\nNow is a really good time to join ZimFun – US$100 per share – with no additional costs – except we hope you will buy more shares each year to keep the Club properly capitalised.\n\nContact Bev Jack – our Shareholder’s Director – on bevjack100@yahoo.com or come racing and hand over your subscription to me personally – at the ZimFun HQ table in Park View on the third floor.\n\nThink – do it now – how many times are you going to be able to say you had an interest in one of the world’s great Classic Races – the 1,000 Guineas? – Or better still maybe! You had an interest in the winner!\n\nThe Centaurian\n\n28th March 2022\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nSpare A Thought For Ukraine\n\nWhilst we enjoy the thrill of racing at one of the finest racecourses in the world – namely Borrowdale Park – and think there is scope for much improvement – there are others whose lot is best described as dire. Seriously dire.\n\nThis week I would like us all to spare a thought for the horse racing industry in Ukraine.\n\nThere are two race tracks in Kyiv and neither has operated since crazy man Putin launched an invasion into that sorry country two weeks ago. It is hardly surprising. What is worthy of our awe is the fact that trainers and owners are still risking life and limb to go out of Kyiv each day to the racecourse stables to feed and care for some 350 horses – just 20km from where the front line is on fire.\n\nThey have enough feed to keep their charges alive for about a month but thereafter all will depend on them having access to those villages from where hay may be purchased and transported back to the stables without being blown to kingdom come.\n\nThe situation at Odessa seems even more fraught with the Russians set for the coast, ready to bombard and then invade. The course was built by the Tsars in 1890. Here, they and the other wealthy hoipoloy gathered to see, be seen, drink champagne, eat caviar and bet on the best horseflesh in the Russian Empire. Much has changed since then.\n\nThe racing industry was on its knees before Putin’s intervention with purses reported to be as little as US15 per race – yet the horses were and are being cared for properly – so far.\n\nClearly, there is absolutely nothing we in Zimbabwe can do – apart from praying for an early cessation of hostilities and a return to some sort of sanity in that part of Europe.\n\nIt seems clear to me that the Ukrainians are not going to give up and become vassals of Putin and his cronies. They are brave and determined not to lose. If I am right, this means Putin must fail. Let’s hope this all happens sooner rather than later – bringing respite to all Ukrainians and their horses.\n\n10 March 2022\n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nA QUESTION OF BALANCE – PRIZE MONEY – AND PRESTIGE\n\nIpi Tombe was the greatest racehorse ever bred in Zimbabwe and last Sunday we rightly had a feature race dedicated to her name – and what a race it was. Finchatton squeaked home, a pixel -ahead of Holy Land with seven-year-old What a Dandy filling the third place. There were no South African raiders in the field as the prize money was far too modest to attract any.\n\nHowever, with the Tankard and OK Grand Challenge to feature in the coming months the vexed question of raiders will emerge once again. The purses for these historic races have yet to be announced but could be as much as US$70,000 – or Rand one million plus each.\n\nThat is serious money.\n\nHistorically, South African raiders added considerably to the prestige and excitement of these feature races – plus betting turnover, from which the MTC garnered a share. These are very important elements for sponsors and the MTC alike – and we certainly need sponsors aplenty in these tough economic times for the Zimbabwe horse racing industry.\n\nUnfortunately, we don’t live in this chapter of history. The harsh reality is that whilst racing at Borrowdale Park is very exciting and compulsive viewing, we have to accept that the average quality of our horses is well below those of our South African cousins, irrespective of their Merit Ratings. If I was to be pressed, I would say we might be 20 Merit Points lower – or more – on average. In other words, a MR 90 in Zim might be hard pressed to warrant a 70 MR in SA – yet would have to compete on level terms in Zim with an MR 90 raider from SA.\n\nThis reality has implications – big implications.\n\nFor the sort of purses mentioned above, a good many South African raiders may be attracted to nominate, accept and raid North to lift most, if not all, the stake money – all four places!\n\nGiven that local owners and trainers have battled long and hard to survive and keep the local industry alive, it seems inappropriate to effectively exclude such stalwarts from access to the handsome purse monies on offer for these classic feature races.\n\nThe conundrum is “What can be done to reconcile the extremes?”\n\nWhat can we do to maintain the interest of raiders for the benefit of sponsors and the sport but at the same time allow our local owners and trainers to compete on better or even level terms?\n\nIn the past, we have required raiders to have raced at least once in Zim before they can qualify for the big races – irrespective of how they perform. I don’t feel this is enough to level the playing field.\n\nMy own feelings are that raiders must race twice in Zim, and win at least one handicap, in order to qualify for the feature races in question. Such a condition would provide for a MR adjustment (and time) for such winners, and a consequential better balance of overall Merit Ratings against Zim horses. At the same time, such raiders would also benefit financially, local trainers being retained to prepare them for their respective Zimbabwe campaigns.\n\nI am not giving this as a prescriptive option but to trigger the debate and to provide food for thought. I am certain that if such facilitation is not entertained then serious harm will be done to the fabric of Zimbabwe horse racing.\n\nWe can’t be having that.\n\nPhotograph by Gavin Macleod: Ipi Tombe Stakes 2022\n\n22 February 2022\n\n_____________________________________________________________________\n\nUp to the eyeballs in it – Baffert and his horses\n\nDr Pierre-Louis Toutain is a France based veterinarian considered to be an expert in pharmacology and toxicology. His renowned opinion was sought by the Courts in America where Bob Baffert is trying to get a ban lifted on his competing at the tracks of the New York Racing Association. (NYRA)\n\nIt’s a long and complicated story and I don’t propose to bore you with the detail but basically the NYRA has banned Baffert from racing on its courses because some of his horses have tested positive to betamethasone (a banned drug in racing) notably Medina Spirit who won the 2021 G1 Kentucky Derby.\n\nIn Court, Toutain was asked by NYRA lawyer, Hank Greenberg, if the presence of 21 picograms of betamethasone in Medina Sprit’s blood would have the capacity to affect the horse’s performance on that day?\n\n“Yes, definitively” Toutain responded.\n\nThen for me, it all got very silly.\n\nToutain had been talking about an injected dose of the drug so when Baffert’s attorney came to cross-examine, he made sure to ask if the same effect would occur from the application of a topical salve or ointment used for a skin rash – which is how Baffert has alleged that the betamethasone found its way into Medina Spirit.\n\n“Topical! – I’m not sure they use it that way” Toutain replied.\n\nAgain, for those who may not be familiar with the rules of racing, simply put, it is the trainer who is wholly responsible for ensuring no prohibited substances find their way into their charges – this includes t"
