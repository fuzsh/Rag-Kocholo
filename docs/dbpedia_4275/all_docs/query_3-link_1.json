        "text": "Some are confused about what's next in their careers because their skills are spread across countless of topics and they are not sure which direction is right for them.\n\nOthers know they have to land a leadership role but they've been getting countless rejections and they are not sure how to make it work.\n\nThe rest know they want to create a legacy and start their own business but want to ensure this leap is successful.\n\nThey've hired fancy resume writers, professional LinkedIn editors, and sent hundreds of resumes. They've watched endless YouTube videos and free webinars, worked with executive coaches, and read leadership books. Some even got an MBA with the hopes of moving faster up the ladder or starting a successful business. None of these worked.\n\nThe reason why none of these have worked is because they never got complete clarity on what they wanted to be known for.\n\nTheir career direction, their new story, and their reputation were not aligned.\n\nWhen these three things are not aligned, you can't articulate your expertise with confidence. Your network can't become your ambassadors and won't bring opportunities your way. You also won't be paid a premium for the amazing value bring.\n\nWe teach our clients to find their zone of genius, experiment with their career direction, craft their story, boost their reputation, and strategically broaden their network. This builds the foundation that will enable them to leap again and again, gaining the pay, recognition, and fulfillment they want for themselves.\n\nWe give you the tools and strategies you need, plus the community and support necessary to build yourself as a thought leader and take your career to an entirely new level.\n\nOur proven system works and there’s nothing else like it out there.\n\nWhen you’re ready, watch our complimentary training about the steps our clients use to reinvent themselves and leap their careers.\n\n\"I've done workshops or other similar things in the past but in this case, the results are phenomenal and fast! I started writing articles and it opened up a whole new world for me. I get people to ping me for my expertise all the time! The Weekly meetings motivate and energize me through this process. I am thrilled with this program,it is priceless.\"\n\nGoing through the LEAP program helped me get to crystal clear goals, which made it possible for me to understand what I'm looking for...The network I got access to through the LEAP program made it possible for me to connect to a [Venture Capitalin the U.S.\n\nIlana is a great professional and an inspiring person, and her program is a real catalyzer, will keep you on your toes and make you significantly advance – in your understanding of where you want to go, what you need to do to get there– and give you real tools to do so. Highly recommend from personal experience.\n\n\"LEAP really pushed me to get organized and focus on what I wanted next and assisted me in fine tuning my elevator pitch...\n\nIt also pushed me to build my personal brand and secure as many speaking opportunities as possible to help improve my online profile... This brought in two amazing opportunities one for VP and one for Sr. Director in a fast growing startup which I decided to take.... Ilana, you are awesome!\"\n\nI've leaped in my career repeatedly: Engineer, tech executive, turned entrepreneur (exit), tech investor (in over 80 companies), Forbes Contributor & Public Speaker.\n\nSelected top 40 women to watch in 2016 and Business Insider Silicon Valley Women of influence in 2017. I've taken all this experience to create the absolute most practical and result-driven program for professionals who want to achieve more in their careers.\n\nAs the founder of Leap Academy, career development for executives, I've seen this program and network transform thousands of lives and careers and featured on Yahoo Finance, Market Watch, Fox, NBC, CBS, ABC, and more.\n\nSo join us and take your career and life to the next level. Fast!"
