        "text": "Five weeks ago he became the winning-most trainer in Royal Ascot history when Poet’s Word took his total of victories to 76.\n\nAnd last Saturday, again thanks to Poet’s Word, the 72-year-old Newmarket handler won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes for a record sixth time.\n\nTo make it an even more memorable occasion, Stoute also saddled the runner-up in Crystal Ocean.\n\nThe Newmarket stablemates produced an epic finish with 7/4 shot Poet’s Word, ridden by James Doyle, just getting the better of the 6/4 favourite, in the hands of William Buick, by a neck with John Gosden’s Coronet nine lengths behind in third place in a seven-runner field.\n\nStoute described them as “two wonderful brave athletes”, adding: “It was a pity there was a loser.”\n\nHowever, the stewards did not appear too impressed by the thrilling finish, handing out bans for using the whip above the permitted level, Doyle getting four days and Buick two.\n\nPoet’s Word joins Shergar (1981), Opera House (1993), Golan (2002), Conduit (2009) and Harbinger (2010) as a Stoute-trained winner of the King George.\n\nSaturday’s meeting had got underway with a win for Angel’s Hideaway (11/4), ridden by Rob Havlin for John Gosden, coming through the seven-runner field from the back in this six-furlong contest.\n\nIn the next race, the one-mile Porsche Handicap, Crack On Crack On also came out of the stalls slowly, but the 9/2 favourite made swift progress in the hands of Adam Kirby and finished strongly to beat Ulshaw Bridge (14/1) by three-quarters-of-a-length.\n\nThe 27-runner seven-furlong Gigaset International Stakes went the way of 20/1 shot Burnt Sugar, ridden by Shane Kelly for North Yorkshire trainer Roger Fell, who decided to attend his local meeting at York rather than come south to Berkshire.\n\nThe six-year-old was completing a valuable summer handicap double, having won the Bunbury Cup at Newmarket two weeks ago.\n\nFell’s in-form six-year-old burst through the pack to lead in the final furlong and grab the spoils.\n\nKelly said: “Roger was keen on his chances. I was told to ride him with plenty of confidence and not to get to the front too soon as he dosses a bit when he gets to the front. He was by the far the best horse.”\n\nThe seven-furlong Wooldridge Group Pat Eddery Stakes was also won by a Yorkshire trainer, with Mark Johnston saddling Victory Command (9/2), ridden by Silvestre de Sousa.\n\nBut the final two races on the card were won by local trainers.\n\nUpper Lambourn’s Jamie Osborne sent out Cliffs of Capri (12/1) to win the Longines Handicap for lady amateur riders with Gina Andrews doing the steering.\n\nAnd then West Ilsley trainer Mick Channon saddled Koeman (10/1), who held on well in the run to the line in the hands of John Egan.\n\nAscot’s next meeting is Shergar Cup day a week on Saturday, August 11 with the world’s premier international jockey’s competition involving four teams – Great Britain and Ireland, Europe, the Rest of The World and The Girls. Racing will be followed by a concert featuring Rita Ora."
