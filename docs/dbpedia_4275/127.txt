Kieren Fallon's working relationship with Sir Michael Stoute has been severed sooner than expected with the Irishman losing the ride on Golan in Sunday week's Japan Cup to his fellow countryman Johnny Murtagh. Fallon, who is wintering in Japan, has not had his retainer with Stoute renewed, while Murtagh was widely tipped to replace him at Freemason Lodge before it was announced that there would be no retained jockey. He did, however, enjoy several big-race successes on the Stoute-trained Kalanisi, Daliapour and Petrushka last year.

Golan, who won the 2,000 Guineas under Fallon in May and has since made the frame in the Derby and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, arrived safely in Japan on Monday and is based at the Shiroi quarantine centre.

The other European challenger in the 21st running of the Â£2.75m race is Germany's Paolini, trained by Andreas Wohler.

Aidan O'Brien landed a 23rd Group One winner of the year yesterday when Ballingarry headed a clean sweep of the places for the Ballydoyle trainer in the Grand Criterium de Saint-Cloud. Partnered by Jamie Spencer, Ballingarry, previously the winner of a Leopardstown maiden, defeated the Michael Kinane-ridden Castle Gandolfo, who had also been runner-up in the Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster, with Murtagh on Galileo's full-brother Black Sam Bellamy in third.

* Julian Smyth-Osbourne will have his final runner as a trainer today, Roky Star at Folkestone. After five years with a licence, Smyth-Osbourne is leaving the profession because he has been unable to make a sufficient living from his business.

* Paul Nicholls, has removed Fadalko, See More Business and Shotgun Willy at yesterday's acceptance stage for the Hennessy Gold Cup on 1 December. His favourite, Montifault, is still out of the handicap on 9st 4lb.
