        "text": "O.G. rings me in the a.m. to say he’s just touched down in Phoenix. It’s the day before he said he’d arrive, and while there was a time when I’d treat the seeming opacity of his plans as par, the call’s a minor surprise. He asks for my address and tells me he can drop by as soon as he grabs his rental car. “Cool,” I say, as if the call ain’t ramped my pulse, as if my crib is presentable for guests. It isn’t. So I shoot out of bed and get to cleaning and straightening the first floor, going so far as to light a candle. It’s been umpteen years since I’ve seen O.G. — Lonnie’s his name — and God forbid he judge me anything less than hella fastidious.\n\nWhen Lonnie rings the doorbell about an hour later, the sound jolts me. He stands a foot back from the threshold, looking into an iPhone, his used-to-be-clean-shaven face is stubbled white. He’s dressed casual in an Adidas hoodie, sweatpants and sneakers, all black, and wears tinted wood-stemmed glasses. There’s a letter-size envelope tucked under an arm and a white mask in his hand.\n\nWe shake hands, tug each other into a quick embrace, and I lead him into my living room. He sits on a stool pushed against the patio door, and there’s six feet of distance between us — for Covid, but also for the space that a man nurtured a certain way should grant a man of his ilk."
