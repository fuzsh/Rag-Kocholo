        "text": "Thanks to Susan for being a guest on my blog. I love her Just One Day series of books and she’s one of my favourite people I’ve met online.\n\nWhich childhood books and authors were your favourites? Do you think they influenced you in wanting to become an author?\n\nEnid Blyton – anything she wrote; the Nancy Drew books; Topsy and Tim if we’re going really far back! C.S. Lewis and Michael Ende’s The Neverending Story. I was more of a reader than a writer as a kid, but probably subliminally they did. But it was Maeve Binchy, when I was in my early twenties, who made me realise I wanted to write and characters as warm as hers – people you could see yourself being friends with.\n\nHow did you get your first book published?\n\nI self-published my first eight books. My now husband suggested I try publishing on ‘that new Kindle thing’ and I was pretty dismissive of it to start with. I’d submitted to six agents, by post! I had the book edited and then he made me a cover. I love him, he did a far better job than I would have, but Lord it was awful!\n\nIf you had to write a non-fiction book, what subject or person would it be about?\n\nHmm, toughie. I do think about writing non-fiction at some point, probably around editing, which is my day job, but about a person… Maybe a biography of another author I’ve admired, perhaps someone who was taken too soon, like Carlos Ruiz Zafón, who wrote The Shadow of the Wind.\n\nHow do you come up with titles for your books?\n\nHa! Sometimes it’s just a working title of the concept of the book (The Dating Game), sometimes it’s clear from the theme of the book (Sign of the Times being about 12 people based on the 12 star signs of the zodiac); would you believe The Christmas Spirit title and book idea came to me in a dream? Not in a Bobby from Dallas way, but yeah, I woke up and had to start writing straight away, and I kept the title that I woke up with! And the Just One Day series – easy, ‘for just one day, Louisa would like to get to the end of her to-do list.’\n\nWhen you’re being interviewed about the books you’ve written, do you ever forget the names of your characters?\n\nI’ve not done too many live interviews yet, but I could so see that happening. I do sometimes forget in the Just One Day series in which book certain events happen. I also sometimes forget the names of the characters as I’m writing them!\n\nWhat’s the strangest thing you have researched (or Googled!) for a book you were writing?\n\nThis could probably be a long list, but my memory is shocking. Possibly something to do with sloth care!\n\nWhat’s the best book you’ve read recently?\n\nThe Ex-Mas Holidays by Zoe Allison. It’s a fun romcom and I loved every strand of the storyline and the setting. Plus it had quite a few more serious topics running through it, which I always love it, but it didn’t detract at all from the rom or the com!\n\nWhat’s your least favourite household chore?\n\nEasy. Changing duvet covers. I can never get the duvet in the cover properly or get it as flat as I want. I’d actually pay my children to do it if they weren’t too small to get lost inside!\n\nDo you have any rituals when you start writing a new book?\n\nI think this evolves with every book, but usually I need a new notebook. When I’m feeling flush that comes from Papier. If not, it may even come from Lidl! I throw bits of dialogue into it, try to sketch out character details, plot details, and about twenty pages in I try to make sense of all that. I also use a new character journal now for every book, and I also put all of this (ahem, not entirely true, but I’m trying) into a software tool called Plottr, to help me avoid continuity errors and so I stay on track with what the book’s meant to be about. We often talk about plotters and pantsers in writing. I thought I was plotter, but it’s becoming clear, I’m a plantser – somewhere in between!\n\nTell us about your latest book/upcoming book. Also please add your links for your blog/website, social media links, etc\n\nThings for my new book are actually a little under wraps at the minute. However, since it’s not long until Christmas – sorry, I bought my first present when it was still September – and because I do love a Christmas book and see they are being promoted earlier every year, I thought I’d mention The Christmas Spirit series.\n\nAnd here’s the blurb:\n\nNatalie Hope takes over the reins of the Sugar and Spice bakery and café with the intention of injecting some Christmas spirit. Something her regulars badly need.\n\nNewly dumped Rebecca is stuck in a job with no prospects, has lost her home and is struggling to see a way forward.\n\nPensioner Stanley is dreading his first Christmas alone without his beloved wife, who passed away earlier this year. How will he ever feel whole again?\n\nGraduate Jacob is still out of work despite making hundreds of applications. Will he be forced to go against his instincts and ask his unsympathetic parents for help?\n\nSpiky workaholic Meredith hates the jollity of family gatherings and would rather stay home with a box set and a posh ready meal. Will she finally realise what’s important in life?\n\nNatalie sprinkles a little magic to try to spread some festive cheer and restore Christmas spirit, but will she succeed?\n\nThe Christmas Spirit buy link: ebook https://books2read.com/u/bQV596\n\nBox set – https://books2read.com/u/bwrQdP\n\nSocial media links –\n\nWebsite: www.susanbuchananauthor.com\n\nwww.facebook.com/susancbuchananauthor\n\nTwitter – @susan_buchanan\n\nInstagram – @authorSusanBuchanan\n\nThreads – @authorSusanBuchanan\n\nBlueSky – @susanbuchanan.bsky.social"
