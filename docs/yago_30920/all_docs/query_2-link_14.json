I hope it brings audiences as much joy as writing it has brought me!”\n\nTituss Burgess, Composer & Lyricist\n\n“I am blown away by the wealth of talent, diversity of style and breadth of experience overflowing in this cast! From our talented Atlanta actors to Broadway vets and Hollywood royalty, they each bring a unique sense of purpose and connection to the material that is magnetic and powerful! The stars aligned in our favor bringing Amber Riley and Akron Watson together as our dynamic leads, with the legendary talent of Loretta Devine and the fantastically debonair Donald Webber, Jr as our Angel. But what I believe will make this story unforgettable is the joy that radiates from each one of these inspired artists which will undoubtedly give us all a little more faith in the world!”\n\nTinashe Kajese-Bolden, Director"
