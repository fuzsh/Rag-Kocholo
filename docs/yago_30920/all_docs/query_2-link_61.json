        "text": "Laurence Albert 'Al' Mitchell was born June 15, 1938, in Paducah, Ken., and passed into God's arms November 24, 2009, at Carson Tahoe Hospital with his wife at his bedside.\n\nIn 1943, Al moved with his family to Los Angeles, Calif. In 1993, Al retired, and he and his wife moved to Carson City. He loved living in Carson City, and made many friends - and was loved by everyone who knew him.\n\nAl is survived by his wife and best friend, Lois, who knew him for more than 60 years, and married to her for 36 years. He also is survived by his brother Chett, as well as many nieces and nephews.\n\nThere will be a funeral Mass at St. Teresa of Avila Catholic Community at 1 p.m. Saturday, Nov. 28, with Father Chuck Durante officiating. In lieu of flowers, the family would appreciate donations be sent to the Carson City Animal Services, 3770 Butti Way, Carson City, NV 89701.\n\nArrangements are in care of Waltons Chapel of the Valley."
