        "text": "Farrell Gene “Buk” Buchanan, 84, of Pearland, Tx., passed away peacefully at home on February 11, 2021, surrounded by his loving family. He was born on Dec. 24, 1936, in Ranger, Tx., to Farrell Glenn Buchanan and Gertrude Squyres Buchanan. He married Clara Tollett in 1958 and moved to Pearland in 1965 where they raised their four children.\n\nAs a young man, he worked various jobs in the Texas oil fields until he moved to the Houston area to begin a 40 year career as a draftsman, quickly becoming a senior piping designer. He could build and fix almost anything and he had an extremely strong work ethic. His physical strength and endurance were impressive.\n\nBecause of his love for the Gulf Coast and his boyhood experiences in the Kemah and Seabrook areas, he was inspired to design and build a forty foot shrimp boat in his backyard. The “Seaweed” was an eight year endeavor that soon became a family project that he was very proud of. In his later years, he was rarely seen without his “Seaweed” cap on.\n\nBuk loved to play a good poker game, enjoy good food, listen to country music and spend time with his family. He was a simple and quiet man with a clever and dry sense of humor. Although dementia had taken his memory, he could still surprise you with an unexpected endearing quip. His physical stature was only average, but his presence in our lives was enormous. We yearn to embrace his hugs and be laughing with him once again. You never took a vacation, Dad. Now, it is time for you to rest in eternal peace.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his parents, his older brother, Breland Wallace and son-in-law, Robert Westmoreland.\n\nSurvivors are his wife of 62 years, Clara, four children; Glenda Westmoreland of North Little Rock, Ar., Randall Buchanan (Sharon) of League City, Tx., Ronald Buchanan(Carolyn) of Pearland, Tx., and Karen Hood (Rich) of Conway, Ar.; 4 grandchildren: William Westmoreland, Philip Buchanan, and Natalie and Mason Hood; one great-grandchild; several step-grandchildren and many step-great-grandchildren.\n\nThe family would like to thank Dr. Diana Alves for her years of loving care and concern, Apostle In Home Health Care for their weekly visits and special care, and Hospice Plus for their care during his final journey.\n\nA private memorial will be held for immediate family in the near future."
