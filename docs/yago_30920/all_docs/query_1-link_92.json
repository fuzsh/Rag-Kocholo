        "text": "Awards:\n\nIn April 2003 Mrs. Archer was awarded with Soap Opera Digest Award for Outstanding Newcomer.\n\nAwarded Soap Opera Digest Award for Favorite Triangle in 2005.\n\nOverview and Biography of Melissa Archer:\n\nIn July 2001, Melissa Archer was cast as Natalie Buchanan on One Life to Live. Although, before becoming the warm-hearted loving heiress fans learned to like, she was Natalie Balsom, who was the bad girl of Llanview and supposed daughter of Roxanne Balsom, (Ilene Kristen). Natalie ended up being Jessica Buchanan’s (Erin Torpey/ Bree Williamson) worse nightmare. Fans eventually realized that Natalie was Victoria Lord’s (Erica Slezak) long lost daughter she had with Clint (Clint Richie/ Jerry Ver Dorn) and not Jessica.\n\nMelissa Archer was born in Dallas, Texas and by age 17 she landed her first role guest starring on Wishbone as Sarah Johnson. After high school she followed her dream to act and began auditioning in LA. She studied psychology at Union Institute in California, which she says “it helps her get inside her character’s head and understand how she relates to others.”\n\nShe appeared in many commercials before eventually landing her first major role on One Life to Live . Melissa is also very active in charity work, including support for Daytimes Unites for Africa, the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation , Red Cross and the Love Hallie Organization. Alongside her co-stars, Ms. Archer also worked on the One Life to Live CD which helped to raise money for the hurricane victim relief fund"
