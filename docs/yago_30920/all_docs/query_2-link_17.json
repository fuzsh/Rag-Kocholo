        "text": "Todd Grimshaw (Gareth Pierce) and Eileen (Sue Cleaver) have shocking news for Sean Tully (Antony Cotton) about beau Laurence Reeves (Robert Shaw Cameron) in a Coronation Street spoiler video.\n\nTodd and Eileen solemnly reveal that Laurence has lied to Sean about knowing taxi driver Mitch.\n\nAfter Laurence denied the connection, Eileen donned her detective hat and found photos of Laurence and his wife alongside Mitch, making Laurence a certified liar.\n\nIt turns out that, while Laurence was married, he and Mitch were having an affair, and things only get worse from there.\n\nAccording to Mitch, Laurence was so scared that his wife would find out the truth, he ended up pushing her off a mountain!\n\nEileen and Todd are obviously concerned, but will Sean believe what they’re saying?\n\n‘From a drama point of view this is a classic boy who cried wolf story that Todd has said everything out loud about Laurence that he could possibly say but there is always going to be that one time when something might be true’, actor Antony Cotton revealed.\n\n‘But of course Todd being the way he is regardless of whether things are true or not it is always about what is the motive. Todd seems to always have a motive for anything he does.\n\n‘So when Todd is presented with this fact that he finds out about Laurence it is the same as the photograph of the wife on the phone etc even when it seems to be coming from a good place Sean can’t help by feel Todd is just a bit of a nasty piece of work and he is doing it on purpose.\n\n‘Even when it comes for a protective place over Sean and it is something that Sean should be told about it very quickly also turns into Todd being excited that he has this news to tell.’\n\nWith Sean and Laurence set to head off to the mountains for their very own mini break, will Sean reveal what he knows?\n\nCould he be in grave danger as Laurence’s secret gets out?\n\nMORE : Coronation Street spoilers: Exit for Damon as he is arrested for a shooting on the Street?\n\nMORE : Coronation Street spoilers: Huge wedding revealed as stars film major scenes in new pictures"
