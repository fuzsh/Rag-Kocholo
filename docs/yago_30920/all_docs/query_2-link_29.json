        "text": "Mitch Browning\n\nCapital '79\n\n1st Season\n\nVeteran FBS coach Mitch Browning joins the Davidson football program as the assistant head coach, offensive line and tight ends coach.\n\nBrowning brings 33 years of coaching experience, including stops at six BCS schools and appearances in 11 bowl games.\n\nTwenty of the players he has recruited during his career went on to play in the NFL, including two first-round draft picks (Dana Stubblefield and Laurence Maroney). Browning was a finalist for the Frank Broyles Award in 2003, which is presented annually to the nation's top assistant coach. That season Browning was the co-offensive coordinator at Minnesota, where he oversaw a Golden Gophers attack that produced a school and Big Ten record 6,430 yards of total offense. UM rushed for 3,789 yards for the fourth best mark in league history and also scored 503 points, which ranked sixth in Big Ten history.\n\nBrowning began his 10-season tenure at Minnesota in 1997 as the tight ends coach, and he added the offensive tackles in 1999, before becoming co-offensive coordinator in 2000, offensive coordinator in 2005 and assistant head coach in 2006. The offensive line allowed just three sacks in 2005 to lead the nation, and the Golden Gophers reached five consecutive bowl games from 2002-06, allowing the fewest sacks in the Big Ten (64) during that time frame.\n\n\"Mitch Browning brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to Davidson College,” said Nichols. “He has a track record that speaks for itself. I am excited about his ability to mentor our offensive line and tight ends. He will also be able to assist in our program development and planning as our assistant head coach.\"\n\nBrowning was most recently the running backs and tight ends coach for one season at Ashland University, helping to guide the Eagles to their first-ever GLIAC Championship and to the second round of the NCAA Division II playoffs. AU also achieved its highest-ever national ranking as a Division II institution at No. 4, and three of his running backs received all-conference honors.\n\nHe spent the 2010 and 2011 seasons at Akron as the offensive line coach, and served as the co-offensive line coach at Tennessee in 2009. The Vols’ line led the SEC with just 12 sacks allowed that season. After his tenure in Minnesota, Browning served as Syracuse’s offensive coordinator, tackles and tight ends coach in 2008.\n\nBefore joining the Golden Gophers in 1997, he spent nine seasons at Kanas where he was the defensive backs coach (1988-90), linebackers coach (1991-94) and recruiting coordinator/tight ends coach (1995-96).\n\nFollowing his graduation from Capital University in 1979, Browning began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at Miami (Ohio) University, working with the defensive backs. He then spent two seasons as a wide receivers coach at NC State, where he worked with first-round draft pick and five-time Pro Bowler Mike Quick. He joined Ohio State as a graduate assistant in 1982, again working with the wide receivers, before joining Kent State for five seasons, working as a quarterbacks and receivers coach (1983-84) and the offensive coordinator (1985-87).\n\nBrowning is originally from Perrysville, Ohio, and is married to the former Jane Grey Baldwin."
