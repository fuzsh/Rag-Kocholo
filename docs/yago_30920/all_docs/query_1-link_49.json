        "text": "A MISSOURI marriage license can be purchased at any Missouri courthouse in the state and can be used anywhere in Missouri. Couple must appear together - it does not take long to get and application can even be started online. Apply online for your Missouri marriage license HERE\n\nIt is required to have 2 witnesses in Missouri. Marriage Licenses in Missouri cost $50. Some offices require cash (exact amount as they do not make change - Platte County is one) while other counties may also accept credit or debit cards. (We suggest you call the county ahead of time to determine their hours and method of payment required.)\n\nMissouri State Statutes Recorder of Deeds office issues, records and maintains MARRIAGE LICENSE records - NOT marriage CERTIFICATES.\n\nThe certificate is just a souvenir for the couple and not a legal document. The courthouse does not have records or copies of the marriage certificate - only the license and the certified copy needed for name change is a certified copy of the LICENSE - not the Certificate.\n\nIndividuals must be at least 18 years old to obtain a marriage license; however, with parental consent one can be granted at age 16. No blood test is required and there is no waiting period in Missouri. When you apply for your license, you wait while the information is filled out and you leave with your license in hand.\n\nBoth parties must appear together to apply for license;\n\nboth must provide social security numbers (no social security card is required) and one piece of identification (Drivers License, Missouri ID, US Passport, Foreign Passport, Military ID, Certified Copy of US Birth Certificate plus US government issued Photo ID or Government ID Card with government ID number.\n\nNO BACKGROUND CHECK IS REQUIRED.\n\n​\n\nWhat about the Additional $10 Fee to get a CERTIFIED COPY of the Marriage License? Do you Need it?\n\nYes, if you are in the MILITARY (generally they give this certified copy for FREE to Military) and YES if you intend to use your Marriage License to get a Passport to show your new marital status and are taking your spouse's last name.\n\nYou do NOT need to pay this $10 fee for a Certified Copy just to get your last name changed with Social Security. They will accept your ORIGINAL marriage license (the one you bring to us to sign). Social Security Information on name change after marriage HERE.\n\nIf either party is divorced or widowed, applicant must provide the month/year\n\nthe last marriage ended. A 30 day waiting period is required once a divorce is finalized for an applicant to re-marry. (Jackson County Recorder of Deeds does not enforce this rule and will permit you to purchase a marriage license immediately.)\n\nOnce marriage license is issued it is only good for 30 DAYS. Marriage MUST take place within that 30 day time period or license must be returned!\n\nSo HURRY UP! Get your license and either walk in or make your appointment with us! Being married is AWESOME!\n\nPRISON, MILITARY, HOSPITAL & ABSENTEE MARRIAGES:\n\nIf you can't appear together at the courthouse to purchase your marriage license you will need to fill out the form HERE. It will need to be notarized and also there is a section for the hospital, prison, military, etc. to fill out approving the marriage. Once the absentee party has completed their part, their intended spouse needs to take that form and finish filling it out AT the Recorder of Deeds (offices listed below). The marriage license will then be issued while they are there.\n\nBOTH parties MUST appear together at time of marriage. Proxy marriages are NOT legal in Missouri.\n\nGREEN CARD AFTER MARRIAGE:\n\nCouple will appear together at the Recorder of Deeds to purchase their marriage license providing proof of ID. Once we perform your marriage the marriage license will be filed with the courthouse. They will issue a CERTIFIED copy of it. Take that Certified marriage license to the immigration office. Social security security number and the name change information can be found HERE.\n\nA WORD ABOUT WITNESSES\n\nMissouri State Law Dictates that 2 witnesses must sign the marriage license in order for it to be valid. There is no stipulation of age requirement - CHILDREN may be witnesses. We provide free witnesses if you need them.\n\nRETURNING THE LICENSE\n\nClay County, and most other counties, mandate that only the wedding officiant may return the marriage license. We will file your license promptly and the counties are very prudent about returning Marriage License to the couple quickly. The ONLY exception they will make for a couple to bring their license in for immediate recording is for MILITARY couples. Please understand when we file for you that we are abiding by State law. JACKSON COUNTY, on the other hand, DOES allow couples to file their own marriage licenses. The advantage in doing so is to get the license back immediately so name changes can be applied for immediately.\n\n​​​If you prefer not to visit a courthouse, the Kansas license process is done completely online and marriage license is emailed. There is a 3 day waiting period.\n\nAPPLY ONLINE FOR KANSAS MARRIAGE LICENSE:HERE\n\n​\n\nThe Kansas marriage license fee is $85.50 and is applied for ONLINE.\n\nIf you go in person, you can pay with cash, money order, cashiers check (made payable to the \"Clerk of the District Court\") Visa, Mastercard & Discover. They charge a $4.95 convenience fee for credit card payments. NO PERSONAL CHECKS!\n\nBring photo ID, drivers license, state ID, passport, or birth certificate.\n\nYou will also need your social security card.\n\nUnder 18 you will need parental permission to get married.\n\nWhen applying for your marriage license in person, (we recommend applying ONLINE) you will be given an application (worksheet) which you can fill out while you are at the courthouse or you can take it home to fill out later. (obtain at the Clerk of District Court office). Example of the Application Worksheet is HERE.\n\nAfter 3 business days you may pick it up - again the courthouse and we both suggest applying ONLINE. You will give this to your wedding officiant to sign and file. You will also sign a sworn affidavit which looks like this:\n\nUNIFORM APPLICATION AND AFFIDAVIT FOR MARRIAGE LICENSE\n\nIN THE ____________JUDICIAL DISTRICT DISTRICT COURT\n\nOF ________________COUNTY, KANSAS\n\nSTATE OF KANSAS, _________________COUNTY SS:\n\nAPPLICATION MADE BY PARTY A PARTY B\n\nParty A Name (Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial) City and County of Residence Age (Please do not list date of birth.)\n\nParty B Name (Last Name, First Name, Middle Initial) City and County of Residence Age (Please do not list date of birth.)\n\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING:\n\nThe above-named parties hereby make application to marry and further apply for a marriage license addressed to any person authorized by law to unite said parties in marriage.
