        "text": "Mitch Daniels jokingly tells old business colleagues about the “racket” they should have gotten into:\n\n“You’re selling a product deemed a necessity,” the former Indiana governor explained Monday at Riverside Theatre's Distinguished Lecturer Series in Vero Beach. “No one has devised a method of determining quality, so accountability for results is near zero.\n\n“Your market is lavishly subsidized by government, desensitizing your customers to price increases. You can raise prices at will and never lose customers.”\n\nWhat’s more, customers associate higher sticker price with quality.\n\n“Who gets to do business that way?” he asked, explaining his wife offered an answer: \"Tiffany’s.\"\n\nThe “racket” is higher education.\n\nMore: Columnist opines, seeks your thoughts on the future of Florida schools\n\nDaniels, 69, isn’t out to take advantage of people. He is concerned about U.S. student debt, which has almost tripled over past decade — hitting $1.5 trillion, twice as much as Americans' credit card debt, he said.\n\nMassive student debt causes graduates to move home, put off marriage and kids and delay plans to start new businesses.\n\nAs president of Purdue University since 2012, Daniels has been a reformer. He wants to ensure the university isn't crippled financially like many legacy businesses and colleges at the hands of lower-cost, lower-quality competitors.\n\nThis is why since 2012, despite the same state funding, Purdue hasn’t increased its tuition, Daniels said. It's also added a more affordable three-year degree option. That’s helped increase applications from 31,216 to 53,442.\n\nWhat's more, in 2017 Purdue acquired Kaplan University, a leader in online adult education. Rebranded Purdue Global University targets the 35 million to 40 million Americans who began college, but never finished, he said.\n\nComparatively inexpensive online learning makes college more affordable because students can take classes at home in their pajamas. Universities charging tens of thousands of dollars for tuition, room and board had better start proving they’re worth it, Daniels said, noting tuition inflation is topped only by health care.\n\nWhile four-year colleges serve a role, only about 20 percent of high school graduates attend such residential colleges. It’s why he thinks community colleges, vocational training and adult remediation programs are essential.\n\nDaniels, mentioned as a potential Republican presidential candidate in 2012 and 2016, has become an expert on higher education. He served on a diverse committee of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences that in 2017 looked at higher education’s future.\n\nSome questions Daniels said Americans must answer related to higher-education:\n\n“Are too many young people going to college?\n\n“Are they learning anything useful or meaningful while there?\n\n“How can one tell who the best talents are when it seems everyone gets straight A’s?\n\n“Are students being taught how to think for themselves or told what to think?”\n\nThe final question, especially as it relates to leadership in a free society, is essential in determining whether graduates have the critical thinking skills to collaborate and compete in a global 21st century economy.\n\n“Young people &mldr; cannot answer the simplest questions about our system of government,” Daniels lamented.\n\nHe cited a basic civics test, with “stumpers\" like \"Who has the power to declare war?\" and \"Name a right guaranteed by the First Amendment?” College graduates got 54 percent of the questions right, with Ivy League graduates only slightly better at 64 percent.\n\nMore: Read the report on the future of American higher education\n\nMore: Read the free-speech principles espoused in the 'Chicago statement'\n\nMore: This Presidents Day, support the First Amendment and local journalism\n\nThe First Amendment is critical in higher education. Daniels is concerned how some campuses have limited what can be said and who can say it by inviting or disinviting certain speakers.\n\n“On most campuses so-called diversity reigns as the cardinal virtue, except for the form that should matter most — diversity of thought,” Daniels said, citing a study the University of North Carolina had only 49 Republicans among a faculty of about 1,300. (Republicans plus independents outnumber Democrats.) “In the places where the free exchange and collision of ideas should be most prized and prevalent too often an enforced dreary conformity has descended.”\n\nHe encouraged alumni to petition their universities to sign onto the so-called \"Chicago principles\" or \"Chicago statement.\"\n\n“The university has a solemn responsibility not only to promote a lively and fearless freedom of debate and deliberation, but also to protect that freedom when others attempt to restrict it,” a University of Chicago Committee on Freedom of Expression wrote in 2015.\n\nThe committee cited how its former president, Robert M. Hutchins, over objections in 1932, supported students who asked William Z. Foster, the Communist Party presidential candidate, to speak on campus.\n\n“Without a vibrant commitment to free and open inquiry, a university ceases to be a university,” the committee wrote.\n\nDespite challenges, Daniels is optimistic higher-education leaders — who preside over lots of outstanding teaching and research — will continue to serve the public well.\n\nIt’s critical.\n\n“The national importancy of primacy in this realm mandates urgency,” he said. “As a society we must resolve higher-ed won’t cut it; only the highest-ed, will do.”\n\nThis column reflects the opinion of Laurence Reisman.
