        "text": "Laurence “Larry” Mitchell passed away March 1, 2022, at the age of 79 years, after a brief battle with cancer. He passed away peacefully at Comox Valley Hospice, with his wife by his side. Larry was born in Comox and raised in Cumberland, where he was known as “Mitch.”\n\nHe is survived by his wife Nancy, of 47 years, his children Sherri (Jeff), Wayne (Nadine), Dan, Sean (Brian) and Andrea (Steve), along with 13 grandchildren and four great grandchildren.\n\nLarry enjoyed the outdoors and spent much of his life hunting, fishing, camping, traveling, and playing ball. He was quick witted and always had a joke to tell. Larry took pride in his community involvement with the Kinsmen, Duck Unlimited and Wheels for Wellness.\n\nHe will be missed by his family and the many friends he made over the years.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held Saturday, May 7, 2022, at Courtenay Fish and Game from 1:00 – 5:00pm. In lieu of flowers, the family is requesting a donation be made to the Canadian Cancer Society or a charity of your choice."
