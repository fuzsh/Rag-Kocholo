        "text": "Lucie Arnaz and her husband, writer-actor Laurence Luckinbill, have moved into Palm Springs with the fanfare of a reality TV show.\n\nIt's like Arnaz, the daughter of actors Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, has returned to \"Here's Lucy\" in a leading role.\n\nOn Wednesday, she and Luckinbill will be featured at a Luminary Luncheon presented by the Coachella Valley Repertory at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage. On March 2, they'll present their 1993 Emmy Award-winning documentary on Arnaz's parents, \"Lucy & Desi: A Home Movie,\" at the Annenberg Theater in the Palm Springs Art Museum. On March 19, Luckinbill will perform his one-man show about Theodore Roosevelt, titled \"Teddy,\" at the McCallum Theatre.\n\nIt's been like this since they rented a house in Palm Springs on New Year's Eve 2012. In fact, it started before they moved to the desert.\n\nArnaz, who became a Broadway star in the 1979 production of Neil Simon's \"They're Playing Our Song,\" was booked to perform her \"Latin Roots\" show at the McCallum Theatre 18 months before moving here. She also performed in Michael Childer's annual \"One Night Only\" variety show at the McCallum.\n\nDuring that time, Luckinbill, who earned his Broadway spurs in a 1961 production of \"A Man For All Seasons,\" decided he didn't want to spend another winter in Connecticut. So they sought a house in Rancho Mirage, where Arnaz spent much of her youth. Her parents were among the first residents of Thunderbird Country Club, built in 1952, and Desi lived in a nearby home now owned by actress Kaye Ballard after they divorced in 1960. Desi also built the Indian Wells Resort Hotel in 1957.\n\nTheir friend Phil Murphy, who had been a Paramount vice-president before reinventing himself as a lighting designer for local theater productions, arranged for them to stay in a Rancho Mirage guest home and they discovered they had a lot of friends in the desert.\n\nThere were theater colleagues such as writer-actor Chuck Yates, songwriter David Zippel and pianist Chris Marlowe, and two close friends from Arnaz's childhood: landscaper Cindy Shoemaker, who had been married to jockey Willie Shoemaker, and Alice Cassesse, whose husband, Rick, had been Arnaz's contractor in Los Angeles.\n\nThey also met philanthropists such as Helene Galen and Jamie Kabler, and peers such as Suzanne Somers, Barry Manilow and Lorna Luft â€” who also is second-generation Hollywood royalty as the daughter of Judy Garland.\n\n\"We came down here and almost immediately met like two people who introduced us to nine people who introduced us to 10 people,\" Arnaz said. \"It multiplied like rabbits. Suddenly, there are 72 people a month you want to meet and see and go and do something with. We never had that in all the years we lived on the East Coast.\"\n\nThey decided to rent a house before buying and they settled on a gated community in South Palm Springs off Bogert Trail, named after Lucille Ball's longtime friend, former Palm Springs Mayor Frank Bogert. Lucie Arnaz used to go horseback riding with one of his daughters.\n\nSuddenly, returning to Palm Springs felt like coming home.\n\n\"I used to think, like a lot of people, that Palm Springs was for old people and there's not a whole lot to do,\" Arnaz said. \"Years ago, that might have been true. Of course, now I'm older and I am one of those people. But also, it's become a very hip place.\"\n\nIt wasn't long before their new friends were giving them opportunities to ply their craft.\n\nMarvin Hamlisch, who wrote the music for \"They're Playing Our Song,\" had been scheduled to perform at the McCallum in January 2013, but he died the previous July. So McCallum President and CEO Mitch Gershenfeld asked Zippel to plan a tribute to Hamlisch for that January slot and Zippel asked Arnaz to do a star turn. She made her desert debut three weeks after moving to Palm Springs.\n\nThen Kabler called Arnaz about a looming benefit for the Betty Ford Center. His entertainer, Charo, had been mauled while trying to intervene in a dog fight, so Arnaz agreed to step in.\n\nYates also had offered Arnaz and Luckinbill a chance to work with his Coyote Stageworks company any time they wanted. So Luckinbill decided to give a free performance of his one-man show about Clarence Darrow. Murphy did the lighting and Coyote Stageworks had to turn away 200 people from their then-home at the Annenberg Theater.\n\n\"It was a huge success and that was quite shocking,\" said Luckinbill, 80. \"I've been doing this for 30 years and I didn't have any idea of how it would go down. I just walked into the Annenberg and Chuck was wonderful. The Annenberg crew was fantastic. It was just like, 'Wow. This is a possibility. There's an audience here.'\"\n\nBy then, the Luckinbills were anchored to Palm Springs. Shortly after moving into their rental, they bought a house five doors away. They still owned their Connecticut home, but, when they wandered into an open house across from the place they had just purchased, they dropped to their knees upon seeing acres and acres of vacant Indian land through a back bay window. When the Realtor said they could have the house for just $100,000 more than what they'd have to pay after fixing up the house they had just purchased, they made a life-changing decision.\n\nThey decided to make it much more than a seasonal home.\n\n\"We came here to live, not to hide or retire or vacation,\" Arnaz said. \"With the work that we do, we travel a lot. I'm always on a plane to do a concert or a play. So, where do you want to come home to? We work everywhere, but this is where we live. It's icing on the cake that we can come to Palm Springs and still do what we do for a living.\"\n\nSense of family\n\nLucille Ball was pregnant with Lucie when \"I Love Lucy\" debuted in 1951. The home movies in her documentary reveal a mostly idyllic home life for her and her younger brother, Desi Jr. But Lucie said most of her memories of childhood play time come from watching those home movies.\n\nIn actuality, her parents not only had to star in \"I Love Lucy,\" but they owned the show and produced it on a soundstage Desi helped design to film it in front of a live audience. After \"I Love Lucy\" ended in 1957, Desi went on to produce TV programs like \"The Andy Griffith Show,\" \"Star Trek\" and \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" while running Desilu Studios. Lucille went on to star in \"The Lucy Show\" before selling her share of Desilu Studios to Paramount Television. Then she produced and starred in \"Here's Lucy\" with her son and daughter playing her kids.\n\nLuckinbill calls both Lucy and Desi \"geniuses\" for accomplishing all they did. But Arnaz says her parents most enjoyed making other people happy.\n\n\"I saw how much they loved the business,\" she said. \"They did something they really loved. That's the thing. The work was the best part.\"\n\nLucie started putting on little shows for her parents when she was 5. Her outdoor life was restricted because her mother was afraid to let her ride her bicycle on the busy streets of Beverly Hills. But she had weekends in the desert.\n\n\"I remember thinking it was Disneyland for kids,\" she said. \"In Palm Springs, we would get on our bikes and ride bicycles all day! She never knew where we were. We just started riding and we took water with us and sandwiches. We would ride around what is now Morningside. There was nothing else out there. It was just sand dunes.\"\n\nWhen Lucie was 9, Lucille Ball noticed her daughter so loved putting on shows that she had a stage built for her in their Beverly Hills garage. Lucie formed her own Proscenium Players theater company, with a board of directors, and they staged little plays. In high school, she acted in musicals such as \"Oklahoma!\" \"Alice in Wonderland\" and \"The Boyfriend.\"\n\nWhen her mother's friend and co-star, Vivian Vance, recommended a theater career to avoid getting typecast in a TV role, Arnaz pursued the stage with her parents' blessings.\n\n\"I got summer stock jobs and the first national company of 'Seesaw,'\" she said. \"That led to 'Annie Get Your Gun' and 'They're Playing Our Song' and I never looked back. I pretty much stayed in the theater and then eventually created a concert world.\"\n\nFamily time\n\nShe met Luckinbill through mutual friends in New York while doing \"They're Playing Our Song.\" Luckinbill was starring in another Simon play, \"Chapter Two,\" and going through a divorce. Arnaz didn't want to get involved with a man on the rebound, but she had assembled an actors group, called The Matinee Idles, that met between Saturday afternoon and evening shows. She kept inviting Luckinbill and, after three months, they began dating.\n\nLuckinbill's parents had a long marriage, but they fought for years. Both he and Lucie viewed their theater troupes as surrogate families. They married in 1980 and had three children, plus Luckinbill's two kids from his previous marriage, but their colleagues were always more than co-workers.\n\n\"When you're working New York regularly, every new show is a family and it takes the place of family,\" Luckinbill said. \"I know that now. I didn't see that at the time. That family feel was really, really important.\"\n\n\"I just realized recently how important it is,\" Arnaz said. \"I didn't realize I felt that way about the theater family people.\"\n\nHer recent touring nouveau cirque production of \"Pippin\" may have been more helpful than 40 years of therapy to help her emerge from her mother's shadow.\n\n\"I have to say it got to be my one big, giant nemesis,\" Arnaz said. \"The story is that it took me all these years â€” 49 years in show business â€” to find something to do so that when I came out the stage door, the first thing people said to me was not, 'God, I love your mother.'\"\n\nShe had to learn acrobatics for \"Pippin\" and her stunts were so spectacular, \"I would go out the stage door and people would say, 'Oh, my God! How did you do that! That's the most amazing thing I've ever seen.' To me, it was like heroin. Give me more of this. I need more of this!\"\n\nPartly because of acrobatics, where cast members literally had to watch each others' backs for safety, the \"Pippin\" family unit was particularly close.\n\n\"One of our guys was diagnosed with testicular cancer and suddenly had to leave the show for three months,\" Arnaz said. \"It struck me so hard, I was having a hard time not continuously crying. And I thought, 'I don't even know these people!' I'd only been with them a few months. But, it's that unconditional love and caring for each other. I thought, 'It's more of a family than I often thought I had growing up because we were so separated so much.\"\n\nReuniting with showbiz people in Palm Springs, and philanthropists who care passionately for their community, have given her and Luckinbill a similar sense of family. The small geography, she said, also made Palm Springs \"doable.\"\n\n\"I just went to see Billy Stritch at the Annenberg and it's a 10-minute drive,\" she said. \"I can go to the market in five minutes. There are friends to see all the time. The social life here is like being in a Cuisinart on whisk.\"\n\nArnaz still lives in the shadow of her mother, who has a statue in her likeness on a bench in downtown Palm Springs. But now, like many second-generation natives, she is considered a neighbor who made it out of town and returned to give back to her community.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Arnaz said. \"And I love that. Yeah, I'm not just moving here because of (the weather). I have some history. And that's nice.\"\n\nBruce Fessier is The Desert Sun's film, music and creative arts reporter.
