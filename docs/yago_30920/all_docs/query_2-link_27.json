        "meta_description": "Welcome to Lawrence County\r\n\r\nLocated in South Central Indiana, Lawrence County is, quite literally, part of the bedrock of our nation. Over the past 200 years, limestone from our local quarries has been used to construct some of America's most enduring structures, including the Empire State Building, the Pentagon, the National Cathedral and our own beautiful county courthouse.\r\n\r\nWhile we continue to mine and process some of the worldâ€™s finest architectural stone, new industries have also taken root here, including defense research and development, as well as automotive manufacturing. More and more people are discovering that Lawrence County is a great place to work and to live.\r\n\r\nNew opportunities for economic growth and community learning are emerging here daily. Our friendly citizenry, gorgeous natural landscapes and vibrant dignity of our history make it easy to see why Lawrence County is becoming one of Indiana's most desirable places to locate. Justice Lawrence Circuit Court",
