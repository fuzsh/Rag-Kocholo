One of the most interesting of these is the casting for extras happening in Boston on July 26th for Ted 2.\n\nWhat is the interesting part and the most “Not at SDCC” part for me is “Additionally, the agency is looking for comic book movie fans with awesome costumes who are willing to dress up for an audition.”\n\nAccording to Boston.com those in superhero costumes are not going to be extras in Ted 2 but something else, but this is not said on the flyer for the event.\n\nGiven that we know Seth MacFarlane is a very big fan of pop culture, I am very curious what he would want to do with a lot of people in superhero costumes. But even if the call for superheroes casting call is not Seth-related, I am curious to see what will come out of the Boston area for this, especially with conventions like Boston Comic Con coming up.\n\nSee publication\n\nAcademics are a relatively new kind of guest and programming track at conventions.

The companies that are a part of this new site are: Toei, Sunrise, TMS, Aniplex, Nihon Ad Systems and Dentsu, also known as some of the biggest players and content owners. There is a lot of content there that would be very beneficial for an international audience, especially if they streamed the dubs (and made dubs) for each country (What would be even better is if they offered all the subtitles and dubs to everyone so anime can also be used as a learning tool).\n\nWhat they need is more than just a site though. They need apps for Android, iOS, and consoles to go with them. Because as we know, we do more on or phones, tablets, and consoles than generally our laptops and desktops, except for work such as creating and editing graphics, photos, videos, and even doing writing. And once they do, the streaming wars will really heat up between Crunchyroll, Funimation, Neon Alley, and the others.\n\nOne of the most exciting things about Daisuki is that they are looking to be a place were fans can connect to creators.\n\nThese exclusives, plus all large content library, and the access to all these amazing creators will be a true game changer. Imagine a Google+ like Hangout with the legends of anime classic and new, and the creators can see how globally loved firsthand their works are.\n\nSee publication\n\nMarvel Anime‘s Iron Man and Wolverine will be premiering in G4TV in the United States on July 29th, this means on July 29th at 11:00 p.m. ET/PT (4 a.m. London Time) will be the Marvel Anime hour (with Iron Man at 11pm, followed by Wolverine at 11:30pm).

Travelling to Japan to build a new arc reactor that will deliver unlimited free energy to the Japanese people, Stark is challenged by the Japanese government and the media when he attempts to import the necessary nuclear priming device. When the nuclear reactor is repeatedly attacked by the mysterious Zodiac consortium, Stark must gather his allies to take on Zodiac and its mastermind.\n\nWolverine Anime\n\nNext up is Wolverine, which features Milo Ventimiglia (Heroes, Gilmore Girls, Rocky Balboa) as the voice of Wolverine. Based on the popular graphic novel by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller, the series begins when Mariko, the love of Logan’s life, is forced back to Japan by her crime-lord father, Shingen. Logan vows to get her back at any cost. He is plunged into a chaotic world of corruption and violence, forcing him to team up with young assassin, Yukio, to battle their way through the Japanese criminal underworld.\n\nWhat do you think of the idea of Marvel allowing Anime creators to give their interpretations of Marvels heroes?

However while most people think that there was just the one show that took place in the Jacob Javits center, there was in fact two. The second show, a much more important one in my opinion, was also a somewhat exclusive show by Hasbro in the New York Times Building, located a mere 18 minutes away on foot as seen by this map, but more on this later.\n\nToyfair as a whole was pretty interesting, and had a lot of great things to see, some of which you can see some on my flickr (along with larger sizes). Unlike other show Toyfair was very quiet due to the fact that this was a business and press show. Examples of some the great things on hand for the business and press alike ranged from LEGO Lightning McQueen from Cars or Captain Jack Sparrow merchandise.\n\nAs Toyfair is an industry/buyer/press show you get to see all these beautiful things and whilst there were a lot of cool and interesting toys, there were a few that I am not sure will work as toys. On the comics side for example, DC Comics had some unique collectibles. These included the terrific Ame-comi girls ( Of whom I got some nice reference shots for my cosplay friends), that included Big Barda . They also had plenty of super hero related collectibles based on characters such as Starfire, and perhaps some of the most exciting the Green Lantern collectibles/toys ( Including the new movie’s Lantern) and toys based on their Blackest Night story arc, all of which were very exciting.\n\nSee publication\n\nDear Customers and Partnerships, We write with an update about our company’s retail dispensary in Orange, MA. Orange Cannabis Company closed its adult-use dispensary location at 5 S. Main Street in Orange, MA effective Monday, July 15. It will remain closed until further notice as we undertake a review of our current and future retail operations across Massachusetts. Orange Cannabis Company’s large cultivation facility in the Town of Orange, which is now fully operational, is not impacted by the retail location’s closure. We made the difficult decision to suspend operations at the retail dispensary at this time for several reasons— and as a valued customer we want to share those with you now. First, while this small dispensary has been marginally successful under our management since April 2022, it has become an increasing financial burden, especially on an \"after-tax\" basis. Revenues have declined in recent months and our rent has increased. Importantly, labor costs and other significant expenses at the dispensary cannot be deducted under federal law, which makes the already thin profit margin less manageable. We have made this decision in concert with the appropriate state and local authorities to ensure the orderly suspension of operations at the store, the secure transfer of goods and property within the space, and the fair and lawful notification and compensation of our dispensary staff, who have been extended full benefits in accordance with our existing agreements. The indoor cultivation facility that we operate in Orange, MA— which produces cannabis products for the wholesale market in Massachusetts— has been fully operational since February and is the central focus of our business moving forward. Orange Cannabis Co. is producing the finest cannabis flower in the Commonwealth. Our flower is now on sale in more than 100 dispensaries across the state— with more coming online every month. We are confident that the decision to close the store, while difficult and disappointing in the short-term, is in the best long-term interest of our company's position in the Massachusetts market and for our continued success as a significant investor and employer here in Orange and Central Massachusetts. We expect to spend the balance of 2024 reviewing trends in the marketplace and our own growth in the wholesale market to make a well-informed decision on a potential retail re-opening in 2025. We are reviewing a range of possibilities for the retail location on S. Main Street, including a potential re-branding and re-opening in the future. Finally, we are very grateful to you— our customers— for your support and goodwill over the last few years. Orange is a wonderful community that we are proud and excited to be a part of as we continue our mission. If you have any questions, please reach out to info@orangecannabisco.com. Thank you.\n\n19\n\n#theresnosuchthingassocialequity Unless the industry is organically creating a platform for INDUSTRY equity, state-flavored 'social equity' is just an opportunity to grift and take advantage of the resources provided for it, and further, just a lipstick-on-a-pig method of limiting licensing and funding opportunities for black, brown, and indigenous benefactors; these programs always establish a number of licenses or a certain amount of money that is earmarked for it; 'Social equity' has the same stench as the Rooney Rule in the National Football League: if a head coach or GM position is vacant, the Rule mandates that the team's interviewing process and search includes at least one minority candidate, and many teams since the inception of the Rule have made a mockery of it: simply picking a random minority coach or GM to interview, with absolutely no intention of truly considering them for the position. These types of ethnically/racially focused programs create a limiting pool of resources for those who are to benefit from it, while the larger portion of the resource plate is doled out to everyone else, usually, without most of the hoops 'social equity' applicant have to jump through to obtain them. That made me come up with the phrase: \"Because there is such a thing as 'social equity,' there's no such thing as Social Equity.\" In the case below, the grifting and foolishness was so egregious they shut down the whole fund; to the detriment of all the applicants trying to start a business.\n\nNew Hampshire could be the FIRST state to legalize adult-use cannabis via a Republican-controlled legislature with the Senate's passage of H.B. 1633 🔥 While it’s far from a done deal--with the bill now heading back to the House for possible concurrence--New Hampshire’s reform effort resembles a potential inflection point for the nation: Among 24 states to legalize adult-use cannabis, nine have done so through the legislative process. In those nine states, Democrats controlled majorities in both the statehouses and senates at the time of reform. Only one state, Vermont, had a Republican governor in office. With a political trifecta in New Hampshire, where Republicans control both chambers of the legislature and the governorship, the “Live Free or Die” state could become a GOP guinea pig for adult-use cannabis legalization. Republicans have a 14-10 majority in the Senate and a 201-193 majority in the House. But would other conservative state dominoes fall with New Hampshire’s lead? Among the 26 states without adult-use cannabis legalization, 24 have Republican-controlled legislatures, with the exception of Hawaii and Pennsylvania. And of those 24 states, 14 do not provide for citizen-initiated ballot measures, meaning it’s mainly up to GOP lawmakers to initiate reform. These 14 states include Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia and Wisconsin.\n\n53\n\n1 Comment\n\nStores that look like dispensaries are setting up shop in towns across New Jersey, putting CBD lotion, delta-8 gummies and hemp products on their shelves without facing the same regulations and oversight as legal cannabis dispensaries. Now lawmakers are weighing whether those retailers should be required to get certain licensing and if the state’s Cannabis Regulatory Commission should oversee hemp products. A new bill would regulate the production and sale of “intoxicating hemp products” that include less than 0.5 milligrams of THC—the chemical that gets someone high—per serving. Under the bill, hemp products would only be sold in licensed dispensaries alongside cannabis products. It would also amend the New Jersey Hemp Farming Act to set limits on how much THC can be sold in hemp products, a cap that some critics say is far too low. #hempproducts #delta8 #cannabisregulatorycommission #hemp #thclimits #hempbill #hempregulations #newjerseyhempfarmingact https://lnkd.in/gTEt6CdK\n\n22\n\nToday, we attended a very informative event, 'Cannabis at a Crossroads,' hosted by MASSter List. The event title 'Cannabis at a Crossroads' perfectly encapsulated the industry's current state, specifically in Massachusetts. Cannabis prices have decreased, and operating costs have stayed the same, making for very small profit margins; operators seem to be surviving, not thriving. Solutions discussed included funding the Social Equity Trust Fund, raising the cap on the number of licenses an entity or individual can hold, regulating the sale of intoxicating hemp, increasing purchase limits, and ending the vertical integration requirement for medical marijuana businesses. These legislative proposals exist; they need your buy-in, speak to your local representative. We would like to extend our gratitude to MASSter List for hosting this enlightening event. Lloyd Banks, CEO and Principal of Banks & Company LLC, provided an exceptional overview of the current state of the cannabis industry. Tito Jackson, former Boston City Councilor and Founder & CEO of Apex Noire, was a dynamic moderator, injecting energy into the discussions and asking all the right questions. We would also like to express our appreciation to the diverse panel of industry professionals who shared their unique perspectives and experiences: Kay Doyle, Director of Government Affairs at Green Thumb Industries (GTI), Payton Shubrick, Owner of 6Brick's LLC, Danielle Drummond, VP of Social Equity at Ascend Wellness Holdings (CSE: AAWH.U / OTCQX:AAWH), Gyasi Sellers , Owner of Treevit LLC, and Jeff Rawson, Institute of Cannabis Science President. Your input was extremely valuable. Thank you to Sen. Adam Gomez Sr., Chair of the Joint Committee on Cannabis Policy, and Rep. Dan Donahue, Chair of the Joint Committee on Cannabis Policy. We greatly appreciate your active involvement in the cannabis space and your willingness to listen to those operating in it. Your support is instrumental in shaping the future of the industry.\n\n11\n\n2 Comments"
