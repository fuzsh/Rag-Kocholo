Use the search options below to search for State registered; State licensed; or State unregulated child care providers in South Dakota communities. After making your selections, a provider list will generate. If you would like to view a list of programs that hold a National or other accreditation, view Accredited Programs.\n\nIf your child care provider is an informal provider (cares only for your children), you can view their inspection and compliance information by typing in their provider id number below. If you no longer have their provider id number, please contact your caseworker.\n\nIn order to view inspection and compliance information for a program closed within the past three years, please use the Closed Provider Search.\n\nIf you need additional information about a child care provider, please refer to the appropriate Licensing District.\n\nIf you would like information about choosing childcare, contact your local Early Childhood Enrichment Site or view the Helpline Center website."
