Retired) 1925 - 2013 After a long, courageous battle with cancer, Lorne passed away peacefully at home on January 26, 2013 in Winnipeg, Manitoba at the age of 87. Lorne was predeceased by his father and mother, Gilbert and Ruth Buchanan, and brother, Bob of Francis, SK. He is survived by his loving wife, Pat; children, Cal (Maria) of Calgary, Ron (Katie) of Thompson, Yvonne Buchanan Sedun (Glenn) of Red Deer, and Paul of Winnipeg; grandchildren, James Buchanan, Laura Buchanan, Mark Buchanan, Natalie Buchanan, Brian Buchanan and Trinity Sedun; and sister JeanAnn (Glenn McEwen) of Regina. Lorne was born on February 13, 1925 in Regina and grew up on the family farm at Francis. Following graduation at Francis, he attended the University of Saskatchewan and graduated with a B.Sc. in Agriculture in 1947. He then worked for the Massey-Harris Company at Brantford and Toronto for one year, prior to returning to Saskatchewan and taking over the family farm. This entailed farming during the summer and being an instructor at the University of Saskatchewan during the winter. In 1952 he married Patricia DuRussel. In 1957, they moved to the United States, where Lorne studied engineering at Iowa State University. He received a B.Sc. in Agricultural Engineering in 1960 following which he accepted a position as an Extension Agricultural Engineer with the Manitoba Department of Agriculture in Dauphin. He transferred to Winnipeg a year later. In 1965 Lorne accepted a Professorial position in the Department of Agricultural Engineering at the University of Manitoba and taught until he retired in 1990. Lorne really enjoyed cottage life on the Lake of the Woods and spent many hours building and fixing. He was keenly involved in restoring antique tractors, especially Ford-Fergusons and Massey Harris. The family would like to extend their sincere thanks to all their friends and the staff at the Winnipeg Palliative Care Program. A memorial service will be held at Trinity United Church, 933 Summerside Ave. in Winnipeg on Friday, February 1 at 2:30 p.m. In lieu of flowers, if you so desire, donations may be made to the Victoria General Hospital or Trinity United Church.\n\nAs published in Winnipeg Free Press on Jan 30, 2013"
