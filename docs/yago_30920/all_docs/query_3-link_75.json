        "text": "Unless you can tell me any different, there is really only a handful of children who started on soaps and stayed until adulthood.I mean children not teenagers like the man who played Nick Newmen who started out as a teenager or Hope brady who also started as a young teenager. I'm talking abuot the actresses who actually started out as children and stayed on for long periods of time to watch them grow up. Doesn't happen much because they want to bring the kids into adult storylines so they recast them to be adults.\n\nGoing back, my first thought is GH Kimberly Mccullough. She started as Robin Scorpio back in 1985 as a little girl at age seven. She stayed on for over 10 years. People watched her grow from a little girl who had two parents who were spy's and then having them die..to a teenager with her first love Stone and finding out he had AIDS...to a young woman with her love for Jason and dealing with having AIDS herself. I wasn't a big fan of hers when she left because i thought they made the character too \"I know best\" type character. I was glad when she left. But I did like her when she was younger. Even when she left, she came back occasionally like for the nurses ball and whatever so it's not like she really left for long and now she's been back for a few years. It's one of the few characters on GH when we can say \"I knew you when...\" since she's been back she hasn't gotten on my nerves as much.\n\nThe second one that comes to mind is Erin Tourpey who played Jessica Buchanan on OLTL from 1990 to 2003, a long 13 year span. She started as a nine year old when they aged the three Buchanan kids five years. Over the 13 years we saw Erin and Jessica grow up from the cute little kid who had to deal with her mother's stroke, her sisters death and then her parents divorce to a rebelling teenager with Christian and having to deal with a teen pregnancy followed by a miscarriage. As the 2000's hit, we watched her as a young woman dealing with thinking Viki wasn't real her mother and then finding out that she and Natalie were twins and finally finding out that Mitch Laurence was her real father. That's when Erin left in 2003, (i don't blame her.) but it was a gift that she stayed on for 13 years. She did come back in 2008 during Viki's heaven dream when she played the daughter Jessica had who died.\n\nLast I think of Kristin Alderson who's been playing Starr Manning on OLTL since 1998. She started as a very young girl at age six. In her early years she played Starr as almost a devil child spitfire. but her parents were a crqazy ex-rapist Todd and a long suffering fighter Blair. Starr could be so nasty and tell people off when she wanted to. The only person who could keep her in line was her aunt Viki. She was always trying to get her parents back together. Then before our eyes, we saw her grow up and become nice. She made her own friends and then fell in love with Cole. She even had to turn on her father when he disapproved of the relationship so much it also became violent. She really turned into a nice young woman when she found out she was pregnant. I hope she stay's on much longer but it's been really great to watch her grow up and become a nice woman who can love and be loved without being the hell-raiser she was as a kid. For a while i thought she was going to turn into a Tracy Quartermaine as she got older but they happily changed the character around.\n\nwho do you like and can you think of any others who started as little kids and stayed on for a long period of time to grow up on the show?"
