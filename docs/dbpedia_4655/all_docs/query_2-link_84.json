        "text": "Are you ready to enter The Fog? If the answer is no, too bad. The Entity is calling. A Dead by Daylight movie is on the way, and it’s sure to prevent some people from seeing the sun rise another day. Honestly, a DBD movie makes perfect sense when the game itself takes a lot of influence from horror movies, going so far as to feature icons such as Samara, Freddy Krueger, Micheal Myers, Leatherface, and more. So let’s dive in and find out the DBD movie release date, look at the trailer, and more.\n\nIn the meantime, if you want to brush up on your DBD knowledge, be sure to check out our Dead by Daylight characters guide, and snap up some freebies with our Dead by Daylight codes.\n\nLet’s slice and dice through what you need to know about the Dead by Daylight movie.\n\nDead by Daylight movie release date speculation\n\nBlumhouse is yet to confirm a Dead By Daylight movie release date. The company first announced that it was making a Dead By Daylight movie back in March of 2023, but beyond that, we don’t have any time frame to suggest when it will be out.\n\nHowever, on January 1, 2024, Collider published an interview with Blumhouse Vice President Ryan Turek, in which he briefly discussed the Dead By Daylight movie. Interestingly, he also highlights how the FNAF movie release date has impacted it:\n\n“I will say that one of the projects that I’m active on is Dead by Daylight, which is the video game adaptation of a game that’s been around for, like, seven years. I look at that as the celebration of horror that the video game itself is. What we’ve learned from Five Nights at Freddy’s is, obviously, steer towards the fans and make a video game adaptation for the fans. I’m a huge Dead by Daylight fan. […] That one I’m super excited about, and we’re creatively mulling around what the way into it is.”\n\nFrom this, we can presume that the film has quite a long way to go before its release, especially as Blumhouse is still “creatively mulling around what the way into it is”. However, the fact that Turek is “active” on the project and is a big fan of the game gives us high hopes for this new horror flick.\n\nWho’s working on the Dead by Daylight movie?\n\nHorror giant Blumhouse and James Wan’s television company Atomic Monster are teaming up with game developer Behaviour Interactive to bring the Dead By Daylight movie to life.\n\nWith modern horror legends James Wan and Jason Blum handling such an iconic horror game adaptation, we’re super excited to see what fun frights are afoot – and, apparently, we’re not alone. In a 2023 article from Variety, Stephen Mulrooney, executive vice president of Behaviour Interactive, had this to say:\n\n“We couldn’t be more thrilled to work with Jason Blum and James Wan, two giants of the horror film industry, to further expand the ‘Dead by Daylight’ universe. […] At Behaviour, our motto is to create unique moments, together, forever. Atomic Monster and Blumhouse are the ideal partners to craft ‘Dead by Daylight’s’ killer entrance onto the big screen.”\n\nIn the same article, James Wan speaks on the topic, stating:\n\n“In ‘Dead by Daylight’ the Behaviour team has created a love letter to the world of horror, building an incredible environment teeming with atmosphere and terrifying villains — perfect for a scary cinematic adaptation. We’re big fans of the game at Atomic Monster, and are thrilled to be teaming up with Blumhouse to bring this frighteningly visceral world to the big screen.”\n\nJason Blum, Blumhouse founder and CEO, expands upon this:\n\n“We know there are so many fans of ‘Dead by Daylight’ out there and think it’s imperative we find someone who appreciates and loves the world as much as we do, to help us bring the game to the big screen. […] We know our partners at Behaviour and Atomic Monster will help us bring the best version of this game to life.”\n\nFor now, we know that Wan, Blum, and Stephen Mulrooney are producers on the film, with Behaviour Interactive’s Remi Racine, Atomic Monster’s Michael Clear and Judson Scott, Blumhouse’s Ryan Turek, and Striker Entertainment’s Russel Binder acting as executive producers.\n\nWho is the Dead by Daylight movie cast?\n\nIt’s very early days for the movie, so there’s no DBD movie cast yet, but we’ll update this guide as soon as we find out more.\n\nWho are the Dead by Daylight movie characters?\n\nCurrently, we don’t know what characters will appear in the Dead by Daylight movie. Over time, the game has moved from featuring original characters inspired by popular IPs, to actively collaborating with and featuring a massive range of recognizable characters, from Scream’s Ghost Face to Nightmare on Elm Street’s Freddy. We presume that the movie will only feature original characters to avoid licensing issues, but you never know – especially with such large names behind it.\n\nOf course, we’ll update this guide as soon as we have some more confirmed details. But, in the meantime, here are a few of the original Dead by Daylight characters that may make an appearance on the big screen.\n\nSurvivors:\n\nDwight Fairfield\n\nMeg Thomas\n\nJake Park\n\nNea Karlsson\n\nClaudette Morel\n\nFend Min\n\nKate Denson\n\nJane Romero\n\nYui Kimura\n\nYun-Jin Lee\n\nKillers:\n\nTrapper\n\nHuntress\n\nPlague\n\nClown\n\nDoctor\n\nHag\n\nWraith\n\nHillbilly\n\nNurse\n\nSpirit\n\nLegion\n\nDeathslinger\n\nOni\n\nTrickster\n\nIs there a Dead by Daylight movie trailer?\n\nNo, there isn’t a Dead by Daylight movie trailer just yet, but we’ll be sure to add it here as soon as it drops."
