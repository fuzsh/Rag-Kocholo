        "text": "Editor’s note: This article was originally written for the celebration of WBAY’s 70th anniversary in 2023. It has been updated to mark the CP Telethon’s own 70th anniversary nearly one year later.\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (WBAY) - The CP Telethon is almost as old as WBAY-TV itself. As WBAY nears its 71st anniversary this month, the CP Telethon on Sunday, March 4, will mark its 70th anniversary.\n\nIt’s the country’s longest-running local telethon that’s still airing on the same TV channel.\n\nThe annual tradition started with the United Cerebral Palsy Telethon, which did things differently than other telethons. United Cerebral Palsy Foundation started a grassroots effort that traveled from city to city -- cities that had TV stations, that is -- with a “Stage of Stars” from TV shows, radio and theater. Different cities might see different stars, depending on performers’ schedules.\n\nGreen Bay’s telethon premiered at 10 p.m. on Saturday, May 22, 1954 -- exactly 1 year, 2 months, 5 days, and 3 hours after WBAY went on the air. The show, broadcast from the WBAY auditorium, continued until 3 o’clock Sunday afternoon. Viewers could come to the WBAY studios Sunday morning to meet celebrities in person and children were promised a plastic model spaceship for coming down.\n\nIn 1978, it became a truly local telethon after Green Bay’s Cerebral Palsy Center separated from the national organization, allowing the local CP center to control its programs -- and it would receive all of the funds from the annual telethon (there were “Winnebagoland” offices in Outagamie and Winnebago counties still associated with the national foundation, but ultimately the funds raised in those counties during the local telethon in 1978 went to the local CP center).\n\nThe CP Telethon still brought in the stars. That tradition didn’t change until 2006, when CP Center refocused its efforts on promoting local talent -- which allowed it to keep more money for its programs benefiting the center’s clients instead of covering national performers’ fees.\n\nFollowing is a list of some (not all) of the stars who’ve appeared on the CP telethon on WBAY-TV from its beginning. This is not the exhaustive list.\n\n1954: Tommy Bartlett (of Wisconsin Dells fame) and Helen O’Connell, Capitol Records recording star, are co-masters of ceremonies. Bobby Wayne, Mercury Records singing star, performs.\n\n1955: The telethon airs from the Orpheum Theater (now the Meyer Theatre). Congressman John W. Byrnes introduces a special address from Vice President Richard Nixon. The master of ceremonies is actor Ben Alexander, Officer Frank Smith to Jack Webb’s Sergeant Joe Friday on “Dragnet” in the 1950s (before the better-known ‘60s series with partner Harry Morgan).\n\nPerformers include George Liberace, violinist and orchestra leader on “The Liberace Show” (the George in Liberace’s famous line, “I wish my brother, George, were here”); Johnny Desmond, an Oscar-winning musician; Margaret Firth, TV phys. ed. instructor (”It’s Fun to Reduce”) and comedian; Charlie Applewhite and Edie Adams, young stars of the CBS-TV Morning Show; and symphony orchestra guest Stephen Kovaks performs classical music.\n\n1956: Western star Hoot Gibson appeared because he happened to be in Green Bay visiting friends. The official “Stage of Stars” included actor Victor Jory (”Gone With the Wind” and numerous TV playhouses); actors Felix Knight, Ken Carson, Judy Lynn and Roger Coleman; and Julann Wright, the future wife of Merv Griffin and the woman who came up with the idea of the game show “Jeopardy!”\n\nThe list of stars continued with Ted Devlet, the featured circus clown star of CBS’s Saturday morning children’s show, “Big Top,” with his sidekick “Sweetie,” who was his wife, Jan Crockett (Miss Florida, 1950).\n\n1957: Early WBAY-TV star Charlie Hanson returned to Green Bay from Milwaukee to host the telethon.\n\nThe telethon was opened by Wisconsin Governor Vernon Thomson and Wisconsin’s first lady, followed by Green Bay Mayor Otto Rachals, representing the United Cerebral Palsy Foundation’s Green Bay affiliate, and Oshkosh City Council President Charles Fiss, representing the Winnebagoland offices. The Wrightstown High School Band performed the national anthem and “On Wisconsin.”\n\nDevlet and another star of the 1956 show, entertainer Betty Ancona, returned in 1957. That year, Ancona had the distinction as an entertainer of appearing in the most telethons since their creation in 1950.\n\n1959: Kitty and Doc from “Gunsmoke,” Amanda Blake and Milburn Stone, are the mistress of ceremonies and master of ceremonies. Other stars include James Brown (Rip Masters on “Rin Tin Tin”) and Virginia Graham (hostess of “The Big Payoff” and “Strike It Rich”).\n\n1960: Ilene Woods, the voice of Disney’s “Cinderella,” then a featured vocalist on Ed Sullivan, Perry Como and Arthur Godfrey shows, makes the first of at least four appearances. Another star is Vivian Dorsett, a TV, radio and theater performer and hostess of the “Hallmark Hall of Fame” TV series. Broadway singer Judy Canova performs with her sister, Anne, as accompanist. The emcee is Mark Stevens from TV’s “Big Town.”\n\n1961: Kirby Grant, star of “Sky King.”\n\n1962: Mike Connors (“Tight Rope”) and Doug McClure (Trampas on “The Virginian”) are co-emcees. Marvin Miller (Mr. Anthony on “The Millionaire”) appears and Vivian Dorsett returns. The telethon also features Green Bay native Pepper Curtis, born Betty Jo Goracke, who had roles in “Gunsmoke,” “Alfred Hitchcock,” and “The Jack Benny Show.”\n\n1963: Master of ceremonies is comedian Pat Harrington Jr., who would gain more fame in the 1970s as Schneider, the building super on “One Day at a Time.” The show also starred Jon Provost (Timmy from “Lassie”) and Shirl Conway and Zina Bethune from ”The Nurses,” the “Grey’s Anatomy” of its day. Green Bay Packers legend Paul Hornung notably made his first appearance after his NFL suspension.\n\n1964: James Drury is “The Virginian.” Robert Reed is one of “The Defenders” and future father of “The Brady Bunch.” Donna Douglas is Ellie Mae Clampett from “The Beverly Hillbillies.” Jay North is “Dennis the Menace.”\n\n1965: “Smilin’” Jack Smith, host of “Queen for a Day” and “You Asked for It,” makes his first of at least 3 appearances. Milburn Stone returns with “Gunsmoke” co-star Ken Curtis, who played Festus Haggen (Curtis would return in 1967). Singer Skip Cunningham also makes his first of several appearances. Ten Green Bay Packers players and 5 coaches manned collection sites (called ”fish bowls”) in various cities, including: Bart Starr in Green Bay, Max McGee in Manitowoc, Fred Thurston at the Neenah-Menasha fish bowl, and Ray Nitschke in Fond du Lac.\n\n1966: 40s heartthrob Van Johnson (”The Caine Mutiny,” “Brigadoon”) stars with Don Grady (early Mousketeer and Robbie on “My Three Sons”); soap opera actress Gloria De Haven of “As the World Turns”; and Ilene Smith, Miss Indiana 1965.\n\n1967: Frank Sutton (Sergeant Carter on “Gomer Pyle: U.S.M.C.”) and Meredith MacRae (”Petticoat Junction,” “My Three Sons” and numerous 1970s and 80s TV roles). Ken Curtis returns.\n\n1968: The hostess is Eileen Smith, but arguably the stars are Leonard Nimoy (Spock from “Star Trek”) and Bob Crane (Col. Hogan on “Hogan’s Heroes”), along with “Petticoat Junction” stars Linda Kaye and Mike Minor. One viewer shared with WBAY that Crane was an accomplished drummer and got behind the drum kit for a musical interlude.\n\n1969: Ventriloquist Shari Lewis is joined by Lamb Chop and Hush Puppy. Lewis would return in 1971 and host in 1973. Another future host, Johnny Tillotson, winner of 3 gold records, makes his first appearance; he would host the telethon in 1977, 1978 and 1979). But the star of the show may have been child actor Johnny Whitaker from TV’s “Family Affair.”\n\n1971: Ray and Jackie Nitschke are honorary co-chairs, and would be for 22 years. Stars included Mike Farrell (”The Interns,” later a star of “M*A*S*H”), John Banner (Sgt. Schultz on “Hogan’s Heroes”), Dennis James (”Let’s Make a Deal”), Buck Taylor (“Gunsmoke,” and an expert gymnast), and R&B singer Ruth McFadden. James returned in 1972. Taylor and McFadden both returned in 1973.\n\n1972: “Laugh-In” comedian Artie Johnson, Tina Cole from “My Three Sons,” and singer Demetrius Trapp.\n\n1973: Adrienne Barbeau (Carol on ”Maude”), Danny Bonaduce (Danny on “The Partridge Family”), and singer Bob Newkirk (who also had roles on “The Millionaire” and “Father Knows Best”).\n\n1974: Barry Williams (Greg from “The Brady Bunch”) is on the CP Telethon on WBAY 10 years after his TV dad. Also actors Conrad Bain (Arthur Harmon on “Maude” and future dad on “Diff’rent Strokes”) and Don Stewart (Michael Bauer on “Guiding Light”). Conny Van Dyke, Motown’s first white recording artist and prolific actor to boot, makes her first of 3 straight appearances in the Green Bay telethon during her 25 years with the United Cerebral Palsy Foundation. Also featured is Miss America Terry Meeuwsen, a De Pere native, who would make regular appearances on the telethon.\n\n1975: Gavin MacLeod (Murray on “Mary Tyler Moore” and future Captain Stubing on “The Love Boat”). Jon Walmsley (Jason on “The Waltons”).\n\n1976: Jamie Farr (Corporal Klinger on “M*A*S*H”), Liz Torres (from the “Mary Tyler Moore” spinoff “Phyllis,” later of “Gilmore Girls” and numerous TV credits), and Ralph Carter (Michael, the youngest Evans child on “Good Times”).\n\n1977: Comedian Kaye Stevens; and “The Lawrence Welk Show” husband and wife singing team, Guy and Ralna Hovas.

Ken Delo and Gail Farrell (”The Lawrence Welk Show”). The Southern Door 5th graders made their first appearance on the CP telethon in 1978 or 1979 (that’s as far as we and the school could narrow it down) and have performed on the show ever since.\n\n1979: Howard Hesseman (Johnny Fever from “WKRP in Cincinnati”). Maren Jensen (Athena on “Battlestar Galactica”). Victoria Mallory (Leslie Prentiss on “The Young and the Restless”). Jim Roberts from “The Lawrence Welk Show,” with Welk dancers Bobby Burgess and Barbara Boylan.

This year also marks the debut of local talent and long-running telethon stars: vocalist and musician Dan Riley and singer, entertainer and future “Shopko Lady” Karen McDiarmid. This is at least McDiarmid’s second telethon; as Miss Green Bay at the age of 19 she sang “You’ll Never Walk Alone.”\n\n1981: Game show host Bert Convy (”Password Plus,” “Tattletales,” with roles in numerous 1970s and 80s TV shows and movies) is telethon show host. He returned in 1984. Singer Jeannie C. Riley performs her hit, “Harper Valley P.T.A.” (you can watch it on our official YouTube channel).
