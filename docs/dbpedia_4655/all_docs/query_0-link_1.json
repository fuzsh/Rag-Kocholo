        "text": "American actor (1892–1962)\n\nFor other people named Hoot Gibson, see Hoot Gibson (disambiguation).\n\nEdmund Richard \"Hoot\" Gibson (August 6, 1892 – August 23, 1962) was an American rodeo champion, film actor, film director, and producer. While acting and stunt work began as a sideline to Gibson's focus on rodeo, he successfully transitioned from silent films to become a leading performer in Hollywood's growing cowboy film industry.\n\nDuring the period between World War I and World War II, he was second only to cowboy film legend Tom Mix as a box office draw. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn Edmund Richard Gibson[1] in Tekamah, Nebraska,on August 6 1892 [2] he learned to ride a horse as a young boy. His family moved to California when he was seven years old. As a teenager, he worked with horses on a ranch, which led to competition on bucking broncos at area rodeos.[citation needed]\n\nGiven the nickname \"Hoot Owl\" by co-workers, the name evolved to just \"Hoot\". (Michael Wallis' book, The Real Wild West: The 101 Ranch and the Creation of the American West, says that Gibson \"picked up the nickname 'Hoot' while working as a bicycle messenger for Owl Drug Company.\"[3] Dan L. Thrapp's Encyclopedia of Frontier Biography says that Gibson \"is said to have been nicknamed because he once hunted owls in a cave.\")[4] Hoot, himself, stated in an episode of \"You Bet Your Life\" (January 19. 1956), that he acquired the nickname \"Hoot\", when he used to look for hoot owls in caves as a child in Nebraska.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile acting for Gibson was a minor sideline, he continued competing in rodeos to make a living. In 1912, he won the all-around championship at the famous Pendleton Round-Up[3] in Pendleton, Oregon and the steer roping world championship at the Calgary Stampede.[citation needed]\n\nGibson's career was temporarily interrupted with service in the United States Army during World War I as a sergeant in the Tank Corps.[5] When the war ended, he returned to the rodeo business and became good friends with Art Acord, a fellow cowboy and movie actor. The two participated in summer rodeo, then went back to Hollywood for the winter to do stunt work. For several years, Gibson had secondary film roles (primarily in Westerns) with stars such as Harry Carey. By 1921, the demand for cowboy pictures was so great, Gibson began receiving offers for leading roles. Some of these offers came from up-and-coming film director John Ford, with whom Gibson developed a lasting friendship and working relationship.[citation needed]\n\nFinancial difficulties and later life\n\n[edit]\n\nGibson's years of substantial earnings did not see him through his retirement. He had squandered much of his income on high living and poor investments. By the 1950s, Gibson faced financial ruin, in part due to costly medical bills from serious health problems. To get by and pay his bills, he earned money as a greeter at a Las Vegas casino. For a time, he worked in a carnival and took virtually any job his dwindling name value could obtain. At one point he hosted a booth at rodeos that encouraged ranchers to raise nutria. He also appeared in an episode of Groucho's You Bet Your Life, filmed in December 1955. He made the final game with his contestant, but did not win the big money, though he earned himself a share of the $440 prize money for the show.[6]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nOn September 6, 1913, Gibson married Rose August Wenger, a rodeo performer.[7] They had met at the Pendleton Round-Up in Oregon sometime between 1911 and 1913. Under the name Helen Gibson, she became a major film star in her own right for a time, notably in the lead role of The Hazards of Helen. Census records for 1920 indicate they were living separately; Hoot Gibson listed himself as married; Helen listed herself as widowed.[8]\n\nGibson married vaudeville actress Helen Johnson on April 20, 1922, in Riverside, California.[9] They had one child, Lois Charlotte Gibson. They were divorced on February 2, 1929, in Hollywood, California.[10]\n\nGibson married film actress Sally Eilers on June 28, 1930.[11] The marriage ended in 1933.[citation needed]\n\nGibson married a final time to Dorothy Dunstan, a 22-year-old yodeler, on July 3, 1942.[12]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nHoot Gibson died of cancer in 1962 in Woodland Hills, California at age 70, and was interred in the Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.[13][14]\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1960, for his contribution to film, Gibson was inducted to the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was honored with a star at 1765 Vine Street in the Motion Pictures section.[15] In 1979, he was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.[16]\n\nIn popular culture\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences to Gibson in American media include:\n\nFrom Here to Eternity (1951): \"'I wonder,' he said,' what ever happened to old Hoot Gibson? I can just barely remember him. My God, he had grey hair when I was just a kid.\"[1]\n\nThe Carpetbaggers (1961): \"'The Bijou's got a new Hoot Gibson picture,' Tommy said.\"[1]\n\nThe Bullwinkle Show: Hoot Gibson is mentioned in \"The Lion and the Aardvark\" episode of Aesop and Son.\n\nThe Beverly Hillbillies (1963): A phony relative, Jake Clampett, manipulates the Clampett family into pursuing Hollywood dreams in an attempt to further his own filmmaking ambitions. Granny is on to him when he isn't familiar with Hoot Gibson, but Jake wins her over by promising her a role in a Hoot Gibson picture.[17]\n\nPetticoat Junction (1966): In Season 3 Episode 27, \"Second Honeymoon\", Charlie and Floyd (The Cannonball engineers) are discussing the poetic quote, \"As each returning spring renews the promise of youth, so a second honeymoon renews the dream of love in two blissful hearts.\"[18] Charlie attributes the quote to Hoot Gibson. Charlie adds, \"He said it to his horse.\"[18]\n\nMyra Breckinridge (1968 novel): \"More than ever was Buck, revoltingly, the Singin' Shootin' Cowboy, so inferior in every way to Hoot Gibson.\"[1]\n\nLaverne & Shirley (1977): Hoot Gibson is mentioned in \"Guilty Until Proven Not Innocent\" Season 2 Episode 11. Shirley exclaims, \"Good God! It’s the devil and Hoot Gibson!\"\n\nFried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe (1987 novel): \"Most of those guards are pretty simpleminded old boys ... they'll go to a picture show and see Tom Mix or Hoot Gibson and then they come back and ride around the farm, pulling their guns, trying to be cowboys.\"[1]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Hoot Gibson filmography\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
