        "text": "Nicolas Cage has become very comfortable in playing a version of himself on screen. He did it last year for the movie The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, and now he’s doing something similar for a video game. Nicolas Cage will play himself once again in Behaviour’s popular multiplayer horror game Dead by Daylight, officially joining the game on July 25. Behaviour Interactive recently gave fans preview of what the Dead by Daylight Nicolas Cage game model looks and sounds. In addition, Cage is also available to play early in the game’s public test build. You can check out all the Nicolas Cage Dead by Daylight fun below.\n\nWelcome Nicolas Cage to Dead by Daylight\n\nFor those out there unfamiliar with this game, here’s the basic premise. Dead by Daylight is about four survivors who attempt to escape from a sadistic killer. They are forced to repeat the cycle again and again, regardless of whether they lived or get murdered. It all unfolds in a hidden, dark reality where a power simply called the Entity rules.\n\nNicolas Cage’s Dead by Daylight Lines, Powers, and Backstory\n\nNow that Nicolas Cage is actually available to play in the test build, more details of his character have emerged. This includes the different lines he says throughout the game, his acting-related powers, and his incredible character backstory. “It takes the cake and eats it toooo.” (sung)\n\nIn Dead by Daylight, Nic Cage is an actor who is sent a script that has to do with the game’s lore. But, of course, it’s all a trap. When Cage arrives to film the movie, he summons Dead by Daylight’s entity while performing a scene and it’s all over for him. He gets taken into the world of the game. As a Dead by Daylight survivor, Nicolas Cage has the powers of Dramaturgy (a speed effect), Scene Partner (see Killer’s aura), and Plot Twist (recover from death). We love the theme.\n\nCage on the Role\n\nRecently, Cage took to the stage at 2023’s Summer Game Fest to talk about joining the game. He mentions, in his indelible Nicolas Cagey way, that the reason he wanted to be in Dead by Daylight was because Sadako from Ringu is in it. I mean, whatever works, Mr. Cage.\n\nOther famous horror icons one can find in the game are Freddy Krueger, Cenobites from the Hellraiser series, Michael Myers, and characters from Resident Evil and Silent Hill. But Nicolas Cage is the first celebrity to play himself in Dead by Daylight. Somehow, it seems fitting the guy that has played a vampire twice would get the honor.\n\nAs mentioned, Nicolas Cage is now available to play in Dead by Daylight‘s public test build. The character will arrive as a fully playable character/survivor on July 25.\n\nOriginally published on May 17, 2023."
