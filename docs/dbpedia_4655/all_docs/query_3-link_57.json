        "text": "Description\n\nEdmund “Hoot” Gibson learned to ride as a young boy and as a teenager worked with horses and competed in bronc riding. He worked as a stunt man and actor starting in the 1910 silent film Pride of the Ranch. In 1912, he won the all-round championship at the Pendleton Round-Up and the steer roping world championship at the Calgary Stampede. He put his career on hold at the start of WWI where he rose to the rank of sergeant in the Tank Corps. After the war, he returned to rodeo in the summer and went back to Hollywood in the winter to do stunt work. He went on to make over 200 Hollywood cowboy movies. Acting was a sideline as he continued to compete in rodeos to make a living. By the 1930s, Hoot purchased a ranch and stadium where he put on shows that included stars such as John Wayne and Clark Gable.\n\nThis Edmund “Hoot” Gibson History Mug is part of our Rodeo series which includes many unique rodeo stars. Activities involved in the practice of herding cattle were the basis of what became modern day rodeos. Nowadays cowboys and cowgirls compete in steer wrestling, saddle bronc riding, bareback bronc riding, team roping, tie-down roping, bull riding and barrel racing.\n\nThe biographical History Mugs were created to teach and inspire individuals to learn about our diverse and interesting history. The biographies were researched and written by history enthusiast, Robert Compton. He colorized most of the historic photos and images used on the mugs, which were originally black and white or sepia tone. The images and biographies are imprinted on mugs at his studio in rural Vermont."
