        "text": "As editor of my high school yearbook, I met regularly with the representative from the yearbook company. His name was Hoot Gibson. He was a nice guy, your classic salesman. He had a big meaty face, always smiling, couldn’t remember my name so he called me “T”. My co-editor was named Todd, so he was “T” as well. Together, we were “T n T.” Guess why? “Cuz you guys are dynamite!”\n\nIf you met the guy, you wouldn’t mistake him for a Western Movie Star. But, then again, you wouldn’t mistake the actor in the leading role of 1936’s “Riding Avenger” for one either. Paunchy, goofy-looking with big flabby cheeks and jowls, Hoot Gibson at 44 could fit no one’s idea of a cowboy hero.\n\nNow, I understand he was a rodeo star in his youth, and made a ton of silent films. I will have to see one of them. Maybe he was great back then.\n\nBut to answer the question I regularly pose here, what was this cowboy star doing in 1936, when Charles Starrett was becoming a B-Western star? Hoot Gibson was embarrassing himself."
