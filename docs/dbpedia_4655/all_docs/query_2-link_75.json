        "text": "The Evil Dead franchise has always been ripe to make the jump to video games. Thankfully, it has done just that on numerous occasions (with varying results).\n\nWith the brand new Evil Dead: The Game on the way, it seems only fair to look back at some of the various games that have used “the ultimate experience in grueling terror” as an excuse to wield a digital chainsaw and boomstick.\n\nWe begin our tour of Evil Dead video games way back in 1981…\n\nThe Evil Dead – Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum (1981)\n\nColor me surprised when I found out this existed (and I’m not the only one). Produced by UK-based Palace Software, the game adheres to a basic idea of Ash trying to prevent demons from entering the cabin and killing him, as well as killing any demons that are already in the cabin (including the ones that possess Linda, Cheryl, Shelly or Scotty).\n\nAs the player defeats demons with shovels, shotguns, axes and Kandarian daggers, Ash’s energy level decreases. In order to increase Ash’s energy, the player must continually pick up new weapons. Once you’ve beaten all of the demons, you grab The Book of the Dead when it appears and toss it in the fireplace in order to win.\n\nThere’s not much more to say about this one. The graphics and gameplay are what you’d expect for the time, although it’s more of a curiosity for modern gamers. I just wish that I had this in school instead of Reader Rabbit.\n\nEvil Dead: Hail to the King – Sony PlayStation, Sega Dreamcast (2000), Windows PC (2001)\n\nDeveloped by Heavy Iron Studios and published by THQ, Hail to the King looked to cash in on the Survival Horror genre by aping Resident Evil. A lot. While you’d think that’d be a good idea, the execution wasn’t the greatest.\n\nThe story for this one takes place eight years after Army of Darkness. Ash (voiced by Bruce Campbell) is haunted by the memories of what happened, so Jenny takes Ash back to the cabin to help him face his proverbial demons. Unfortunately, his severed hand shows up, hits ‘Play’ on that tape recorder, and summons the demons again. The demons kidnap Jenny and unleash Evil Ash from the mirror, leaving Good Ash to have to clean up the mess.\n\nYeah, despite the marriage of Evil Dead and Resident Evil, the game was mediocre, at best. Those RE tank controls, compounded by the relentless spawning of enemies and the cinematic-style of camera, made combat a chore. Sometimes enemies respawn so quickly that you barely have time to recover from defeating one Deadite when another appears right behind you. You’ll end up running away more often than not to regroup.\n\nWhile the graphics for the PlayStation version were adequate, the PC and Dreamcast ports suffered from using the same low-res textures and models. Overall, the derivativeness of the game makes you long to play the games that Hail to the King obviously tries to copy. Seek this one out only if you’re an absolute sucker for punishment.\n\nEvil Dead: A Fistful of Boomstick – Sony PlayStation 2, Microsoft Xbox (2003)\n\nTHQ handed development this time to VIS Entertainment Limited (who used the same engine from their earlier game, State of Emergency). The story has Ash (once again voiced by Bruce) being down on his luck at a Dearborn bar during a broadcast of “Mysteries of the Occult” television show. The show, hosted by journalist and sceptic Trisha Pettywood, is attempting to expose the truth about the Necronomicon with her guest, parapsychologist and best-selling author Professor Alex Eldridge (a former colleague of Professor Raymond Knowby). While discussing the book, Trisha plays that same recording of Knowby reciting the summoning of the Deadites. You know what happens next. Ash suits up again to stop the Deadites.\n\nDitching Resident Evil in favour of open world combat and exploration, Boomstick is an improvement over the previous game. Ash this time can collect pages from the Necronomicon to cast spells that will either power him up or, if you mess up the combination, smack you to the ground. You also have a variety of weapons to use besides your boomstick and chainsaw.\n\nUnfortunately, the game does start to grind a bit as you get farther along. Enemies will still endlessly respawn and follow you until you kill them, the combat is pretty simplistic (though you do get a lock-on feature), and the game relies on annoying staple of fetch quests. Even if you look past the grinding, it also doesn’t help that the game can probably be completed within a day. The graphics, simple even for the time, look worse now. But at least Bruce spouts off more than he ever did last time, which helps in the fun.\n\nThe game is still a guilty pleasure for me to this day, even with having to go back to the “at least it’s better than Hail to the King” line. It’s a budget title, but still good for the short time you take to complete it.\n\nEvil Dead: Regeneration – Windows PC, Sony PlayStation 2 & Microsoft Xbox (2005)\n\nAgain, Bruce is back to spit more one-liners in this game, developed by Cranky Pants Games and published by THQ. Regeneration is this time unconnected to the previous games and instead has Ash stuck in a mental hospital after being driven insane after the events of Evil Dead 2 (and also if he didn’t get sent back in time). Ash’s doctor, Dr. Vladamir Reinhard, somehow acquires Professor Raymond Knowby’s diary and the Necronomicon. Reinhard plans to unlock the secrets of the Necronomicon, but as the way things go, he unleashes the Deadites once again, leaving Ash to do his thing.\n\nAn improvement in some areas over A Fistful of Boomstick, Regeneration‘s draw this time is Sam, a half-Deadite sidekick (voiced by Ted Raimi). You gain Sam early on and can use him to solve puzzles and battle enemies. He’s also the game’s comic relief, which despite what you might think, doesn’t always play as well as you’d hope.\n\nIt also doesn’t help that Sam falls into the annoying sidekick trope with his voice, leaving you longing for solo play (or hitting mute). And the less said about the times you take control of Sam to complete objectives, the better. Plus, like Boomstick, this can probably be completed within six or seven hours.\n\nFortunately, it’s not all bad. The combat is an improvement over Boomstick, which is more gratifying and fluid this time. Plus, you now have infinite ammo, so you can go crazy with your shooting. And the graphics and animation have received more attention this time, with environments looking less like a grade-school project. Plus, Bruce makes up for Sam’s shortcomings in the humor department with his one-liners.\n\nLike A Fistful of Boomstick before it, Regeneration is a flawed but fun experience that can be enjoyed in a day. These Evil Dead games have never have been masterpieces, but for fans of the series, it’s another chance to have Bruce swing that chainsaw one more time.\n\nArmy of Darkness: Defense – Apple iOS, Android (2011)\n\nMobile games are a dime a dozen, and that goes double for the Evil Dead series. This game in particular was developed by Backflip Studios and has the player (as Ash) fighting off Deadites in your typical tower defense game. The Deadites come from a tunnel on the right side of the screen, while you defend your castle (which houses the Necronomicon) on the left. Surprisingly, this makes sense when you think of that moment in the film.\n\nAsh attacks with his boomstick automatically (you annoyingly have to upgrade to get his chainsaw), but you can also perform special attacks that recharge after a time, such as a stronger blast from your boomstick, or using the Necronomicon to devour Deadites. To build up your defenses, you’ll be snagging bars of iron produced by Smithy, the blacksmith. Enemies also drop bars, along with money. The bars are used to hire units, which range from pitchfork-wielding peons to armor-clad knights. The money will be used to unlock new units and abilities.\n\nThe biggest problem with the game is the lack of a real sense of progression, as you’ll just be mowing down wave after wave of Deadites with no real end goal, meaning the game falls into a repetitive chore. Ash and company also spout the same lines repeatedly, which doesn’t help, either. If you’ve played other tower defense games, this one is really no different.\n\nPhantom Halls – Windows PC (2017)\n\nWhile not directly related to the Evil Dead series, Ash does make an appearance in the game in a crossover. In Phantom Halls, the player enters a haunted mansion to eliminate the undead terrors that lurk inside. Along the way, you recruit two teammates to help you out, pick up weapons and complete an assigned objective.\n\nAsh was eventually added to the game along with his own mode, where he hunts Evil Ash through a series of unique Evil Dead 2-inspired quests.\n\nTerrordrome: Rise of the Boogeymen – Windows PC (2015)\n\nProbably the only way to have Ash face off against Leatherface, Freddy, Pinhead, or any of the other iconic modern horror figures. This one-on-one freeware fighting game was unfortunately destined to be slapped with a Cease & Desist right off the bat. Fortunately, it got pretty far in its development before that happened. You can still find the “final” version of this floating around the net if you look hard enough.\n\nThe game plays like a combination of Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat, while trying to tie in a storyline that, let’s be honest, is pure fan fiction gold.\n\nUnlike the films (and television show) that inspired them, the Evil Dead games run the gamut of being mediocre to firmly being guilty pleasure territory. They were never going to win awards. But somehow, like the films themselves, they have their own unique charm to them that keeps fans (and developers) coming back for another round. And frankly, we wouldn’t want it any other way. Here’s hoping the next game will bring more of that charm.\n\nAddendum: Some readers have pointed out that I missed a couple of iOS games, along with Ash’s appearance in Poker Night 2. I was bound to miss a couple of them, but it just goes to show the pull of Ash and Evil Dead as a marketable franchise. Or, I just need to be doing better research. Anyway, thanks guys!\n\n‘Alien: Romulus’ is right around the corner, so it’s the perfect time to check out ‘Lily C.A.T.,’ an anime body horror classic that’s a gory tribute to ‘Alien’ and ‘The Thing’.\n\n“Confine them? We’re on a ship. We’re practically confined ourselves.”\n\nRidley Scott’s Alien is an iconic horror/science fiction hybrid that’s had its ups and downs as a film franchise, but remains an essential genre film 45 years later. Alien is such a tried and true property with limitless potential that it’s kind of remarkable that there hasn’t been an Alien animated series or in-universe anime that’s in the vein of The Animatrix that translates this iconic sci-fi horror property into animated madness where it can really let loose and not be confined by live-action’s limitations. An unreleased Alien vs. Predator anime is the closest thing that audiences have gotten to this, which is actually fully mixed and completed as of 2016.\n\nDisney is currently just sitting on the finished product as of its acquisition of 20th Century Fox and it’s unclear if they’re ever going to do anything with it at this point. There are so many horror films that try to make waves by being “Alien, but on a ….,” or “It’s like The Thing, only it’s set in a …” These copycat horror films understandably have mixed results. For every Life, Event Horizon, Contamination, and Galaxy of Terror, there’s an Inseminoid, Xtro II: The Second Encounter, and Critters 4. Somehow, one of the smartest Alien rip-offs is an ‘80s anime that mashes the Ridley Scott film together with another revered science fiction creature feature classic.\n\nLily C.A.T. an anime OVA – original video animation that’s akin to a direct-to-video movie – from 1987 that’s basically Alien meets The Thing. A bunch of astronauts awake from cryo-sleep and learn that a shapeshifting monster is taking them out, one-by-one, with little means of recourse. Over time, the crew learns that The Syncam Corporation, the company who is behind their mission, has betrayed them and set them up for failure, just like Ripley and her team in Alien. Lily C.A.T. is a rewarding sci-fi/horror anime that’s heavily inspired by Alien, but proves to be so much more. Fede Álvarez’s Alien: Romulus is set to revolutionize the flailing film franchise, along with Noah Hawley’s upcoming Alien: Earth FX series.\n\nThat being said, Lily C.A.T. is the Alien reimagining that you didn’t know you needed.\n\nLily C.A.T. is a unique property who was directed by Hisayuki Toriumi, who previously did extensive directing on Gatchaman, 1979’s Ultraman, and Battle of the Planets. Lily C.A.T.’s writer, Hiroyuki Hoshiyama, also cut his teeth writing for many mecha and giant robot series, such as Blue Comet SPT Layzner, Transformers: Super-God Masterforce, Patlabor, Future GPX Cyber Formula, and Turn A Gundam, not to mention all ten episodes of the Dirty Pair OVA. Toriumi and Hoshiyama’s mecha experience feels evident in Lily C.A.T., even if there are no giant robots present in the OVA. Their past experience is expressed through Lily C.A.T.’s grungy cyberpunk aesthetic and 23rd century setting. There are several shots and examples of technology on the central ship, Saldes, that feel like direct homages to Carpenter and Scott’s early film oeuvre. Additionally, the OVA’s monster designs come from Yoshitaka Amano, who may be no H.R. Giger, Stan Winston, or Rob Bottin, but he’s someone who’s established an impressive reputation and is best known for his artwork in Vampire Hunter D and the Final Fantasy games.\n\nLily C.A.T. has become more obscure in recent years, but it did have an English dub that was produced by Carl Macek and distributed by Streamline Pictures, who were a major player in the dubbing industry during the late ’80s and ’90s, handling Robotech, Macross, and some of the decade’s biggest dub releases like My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki’s Delivery Service, Akira, and Fist of the North Star. Lily C.A.T. was a notorious VHS release during the ’90s and became a bigger cult classic through its prominent airing on the Sci-Fi Channel Saturday Anime block. It was finally released on DVD in 2014, where an official Japanese with English subtitles version was available for the first time. Unfortunately, the DVD is now out of print and it’s since become a rare, expensive collector’s item (the VHS alone sells for anywhere between $40 and $90 on eBay), which is a testament to the ’80s OVA’s reputation and staying power.\n\nLily C.A.T. quickly stands out through its inspired editing that keeps its central mystery alive, the tension taught, and the audience on the edge of their seats. There’s such a tight story that immediately gets moving and essentially has zero filler because of the OVA’s relatively short runtime. This tight, well-paced narrative is complemented by graphic kills and ridiculous transformation sequences. The first transformation scene is a gory, bloody spectacle that genuinely catches the audience by surprise. Biological viscera mingles with extraterrestrial acids so that the whole display feels truly otherworldly in nature. A cat’s ribs separate and explode as it’s turned into some surreal, monstrous hand puppet that’s immediately evocative of the dog’s transformation sequence in The Thing. Lily C.A.T. only gets more outrageous as it moves forward. Organs splatter and paint the ship’s interior like biological fireworks. The subsequent transformation sequences are even more disturbing and gruesome. There’s a truly gonzo moment when one of the crew members flamethrowers a cat until it’s willed into submission, only for the feline’s face to peel off and reveal its robotic insides. It’s such a gloriously anime visual that in many ways is even more extreme and over the top than anything that’s in the original Alien.\n\nThe threat of a biological virus that spreads through the Saldes ship intensifies its terror through evocative shots of tight, sterile corridors that are dense in steam, shadow, and danger. Lily C.A.T. is careful to not overextend itself and it understands the value in how less can be more. This makes it all the more unfortunate that this effective title has slipped through the cracks and remains relatively obscure and unknown, despite it absolutely nailing what it’s going for. It’s one of the most genuinely unnerving anime movies and OVAs to come out of the ‘80s, which was a decade that was absolutely rampant with ultra-violent body horror content, like Wicked City and Demon City Shinjuku.\n\nLily C.A.T. is so much better for saying what it has to in a concise 67 minutes, instead of being drawn out into a longer movie with an unnecessary extra act. It’s easy to picture a modern adaptation of Lily C.A.T. that’s told as a limited series. A longer, serialized venture of this nature could potentially work, especially if it were to put an even greater focus on its characters, but a Lily C.A.T. series runs the risk of ruining the OVA’s magic and wrecking the tension that’s effectively created in this tight production. It’s for the best that Lily C.A.T. is what it is – and that it’s not even adapted from manga source material – rather than being one piece of a greater whole.\n\nIn fact, director Toriumi, had been vocal about his desire to create an anime version of the popular “bakeneko” subgenre of horror films that focus on yokai/demon cats – who often have shapeshifting abilities – and the terrors that surround them. A cat, Jonesy, is of course central to Alien and another way in which Alien and Lily C.A.T. are alike (and The Thing builds a major centerpiece out of its shapeshifting dog). It’s curious to note that Lily C.A.T.’s whole concept came out of a desire to riff on the bakeneko subgenre, rather than an attempt to reverse-engineer Alien elements.\n\nProductions like Lily C.A.T., Alien, and The Thing often live or die based on their cast of characters and how successfully they connect with viewers. Lily C.A.T. introduces a varied group of archetypal figures on the Saldes who almost feel like they’re ripped out of Street Fighter. They’re appropriate types of cannon fodder for a story of this nature. One of Lily C.A.T.’s greatest joys is how this cast quickly grows on the viewer and how easy it is to actively root for them by the film’s final act. Lily C.A.T. makes you genuinely care for these characters, even if they may initially come across as one-dimensional, and this helps the film really stick the landing with its ending. It’s all-too easy for Alien and Thing copycats to have disposable characters who are of little consequence when they finally bite the dust. Every death in Lily C.A.T. hits hard and the film’s ending is reminiscent of Ripley and Newt’s triumphant escape during Aliens’ finale.\n\nIn addition to the shapeshifting terror that threatens Saldes’ crew, Lily C.A.T. also explores the idea that two people on the ship may be imposters, specifically “time escapees.” These are individuals who commit crimes, sneak on a ship, use its cryosleep to get away for 40-60 years, only to return to Earth where they’re now able to operate freely because no one remembers what they did half-a-century ago. It’s actually a really creative concept and the type of idea that you’d find in the best works of Philip K. Dick or Isaac Asimov. This beautifully illustrates how criminals can take advantage of technological advancements for their own selfish gains.\n\nLily C.A.T. could simply coast on ghoulish visuals and grisly murders alone, but there’s some deeper material in play as Saldes’ crew ruminate on the inherent loneliness of their work. Their mission rips them from their lives and turns them into missing pieces of a puzzle that they no longer fit into anymore. It’s appreciated that Lily C.A.T. explores these heavier questions and the mental toll that all this puts on its characters, even before they’re exposed to this shapeshifting, murderous bacteria. Lily C.A.T. isn’t nearly as deep as Alien and is limited by its length, but it does attempt to get in its cast’s head in a slightly more invasive manner than Ridley Scott’s film.\n\nLily C.A.T. concludes with an epic finale that’s on par with Alien, yet it’s even more daring and graceful in some respects. The characters are prepared to sacrifice themselves for the greater good so that the Saldes doesn’t return to Earth with this deadly bacteria in tow and liable to contaminate the entire planet. There are some brutal moments where the crew contemplate their ends and taking the easy way out instead of confronting the horrors of this monster. Ultimately, they rise to the occasion and consider a more noble end. During the film’s final moments of success, a melancholy Jiro prompts a question to Nancy: “Do you think the beautiful butterfly finds it repulsive that it was once a caterpillar?” It’s a poetic query that encapsulates the philosophical tug of war that’s in play in Lily C.A.T. and it casts the heroes’ victory in a darker, uncomfortable light. It’s a powerful, thought-provoking conclusion that beats out many modern science fiction and horror stories – anime or otherwise.\n\nMore than 35 years later, Lily C.A.T. is still an extremely satisfying companion piece to Alien: Romulus that should be added to everyone’s Alien binge list before they check out the new film.\n\n‘Lily C.A.T.’ is currently available to stream for free on The Roku Channel."
