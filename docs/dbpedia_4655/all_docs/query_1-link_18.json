        "text": "(Ad cut from Old Corral collection)\n\nThe 8 (or 11) Trail Blazers films were:\n\n3 starring Ken Maynard and Hoot Gibson:\n\nWILD HORSE STAMPEDE (Monogram, 1943; directed by Alan James)\n\nTHE LAW RIDES AGAIN (Monogram, 1943; directed by Alan James)\n\nBLAZING GUNS (Monogram, 1943; directed by Robert Emmett Tansey)\n\n3 starring Maynard, Gibson and Bob Steele:\n\nDEATH VALLEY RANGERS (Monogram, 1943; directed by Robert Emmett Tansey)\n\nWESTWARD BOUND (Monogram, 1944; directed by Robert Emmett Tansey)\n\nARIZONA WHIRLWIND (Monogram, 1944; directed by Robert Emmett Tansey)\n\n2 starring Gibson, Steele and Chief Thunder Cloud:\n\nOUTLAW TRAIL (Monogram, 1944; directed by Robert Emmett Tansey)\n\nSONORA STAGECOACH (Monogram, 1944; directed by Robert Emmett Tansey)\n\nThe following 3 films with Hoot Gibson and Bob Steele are often mentioned as entries in the series, but these were not produced or marketed as the Trail Blazers:\n\nMARKED TRAILS (Monogram, 1944; directed by J. P. McCarthy)\n\nTRIGGER LAW (Monogram, 1944; directed by Vernon Keays)\n\nUTAH KID (Monogram, 1944; directed by Vernon Keays)\n\n(Courtesy of Les Adams)\n\n(Courtesy of Les Adams)\n\nAbove, from L-to-R are Betty Miles, Bob Steele, John Bridges, and Hoot Gibson in SONORA STAGECOACH (Monogram, 1944), one of the later Trail Blazers without Ken Maynard.\n\n(From Old Corral collection)\n\nTakin' a break at Monogram during the filming of OUTLAW TRAIL (Monogram, 1944), one of the Trail Blazers trio westerns. Above from L-to-R are Hoot Gibson, Victor Daniels/Chief Thunder Cloud, Gene Alsace (Rocky Camron), Jennifer Holt and Bob Steele. Jennifer Holt was the sister of RKO cowboy Tim Holt, and a frequent leading lady to Johnny Mack Brown, Eddie Dean and Lash LaRue in the 1940s.\n\n(From Old Corral collection)\n\nKen and Hoot were the duo that were Monogram's initial Trail Blazers. Bob Steele was available to join the team due to the demise of the Three Mesquiteers series at Republic ... the series needed younger blood to add some vitality and pep to the films. Above from L-to-R are Ken Maynard (now riding the white Tarzan II), Bob Steele, and Hoot Gibson. The original Tarzan died about 1940. Gibson is riding Rusty, the Wonder Horse which had been earlier used by Jack Randall and Tom Keene in their series at Monogram. When Maynard exited the Trail Blazers, Chief Thunder Cloud came in as the replacement - Thunder Cloud rode Rusty and Gibson rode a different mount."
