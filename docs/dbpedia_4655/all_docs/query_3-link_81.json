        "text": "NASA Johnson Space Center Oral History Project\n\nEdited Oral History Transcript\n\nRobert L. \"Hoot\" Gibson\n\nInterviewed by Jennifer Ross-Nazzal\n\nHouston, TX – 22 January 2016\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Today is January 22nd, 2016. This interview with Hoot Gibson is being conducted for the JSC Oral History Project in Houston, Texas. The interviewer is Jennifer Ross-Nazzal. You were telling me about Steve [Steven R.] Nagel.\n\nGibson: Yes, I was going to talk about Steve Nagel. He and I were just dear dear friends. We were the two youngest pilots—used to be young—out of our astronaut class. He was three days older than me. I was the youngest pilot selected in 1978, and he was the second youngest. Like you mentioned, he’s just such a nice guy. In fact when he left the Astronaut Corps and he was working for Safety, he was allowed to ride in the T-38s if somebody was going somewhere. I made sure he’d come with me when I went out to California to Ames [Research Center, Moffett Field] to fly the VMS [Vertical Motion] Simulator out there. I always grabbed Steve and said, “Hey, come on, why don’t you come out to Ames with me?” We would do that.\n\nAbout the last six [months] of his life, I saw him every single month because he was coming to Nashville for treatment. Actually the only reason I found out about it was he called me and he said, “Hoot, I need a favor.” I said, “Anything.” He said, “I need to have somebody drop me off and pick me up for having this surgical procedure done. They won’t let me have it done unless I have somebody with me.” He was living up in Columbia, Missouri. That’s how I found out that he was going to be coming to Centennial Medical Center [Nashville, Tennessee] a couple times a month actually.\n\nWhen I found out about that I said, “Oh my gosh. Steve, you got to come stay with us.” He had already booked a hotel the first night, so he stayed in a hotel the first night. Then I said, “Okay, check out of that place, and you’re going to come stay with us.” It was just wonderful. Things were going really well with his treatment for a long long time, maybe four, five months. He had said what they told him was this is going to be effective for a while, then it’s going to stop being effective, and then you’re going to have to look for something else. Of course something else didn’t materialize after that.\n\nAs a result, he was coming to Murfreesboro and staying with us and then he’d drive into Centennial Medical Center. One time he brought Linda and Lauren, his daughter, down there. They all stayed with us. He and I would go fly radio-controlled models, and we were just having more fun together. It was as sad as it could be, but I was so privileged that I got to spend all that time with him in about his final six months. That was just wonderful.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: That’s a nice memory, nice way to remember him.\n\nGibson: Yes, he and I had always been just really good friends. We flew chase on STS-1 together. He had been chase six or something like that. He was one of our guys. Just really enjoyed his company the whole 18 years we were here and then his company when he’d come stay with us. So [STS]-41B you wanted.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I had a couple questions before then. Of course Rhea [Seddon] has published her book. But I want to get your perspective on things. You guys had a press release announcing that Rhea was pregnant, and it was just one line: Astronauts Hoot Gibson and Rhea Seddon are expecting a baby later on in the summer. I actually spoke with the public affairs official who wrote the press release, and he couldn’t remember too much about it. But I was curious. Was that an idea that you guys came up with because you were anticipating there was going to be so much media interest in that change?\n\nGibson: The answer is I don’t know. What happened was that when she got pregnant we kept it secret for quite a while, because she didn’t want to get grounded. Probably not a good attitude, coming out of a doctor and a woman, to be riding in an ejection seat-equipped airplane like a T-38. But she didn’t want to get grounded when she first got pregnant. She was hiding it. She hid it until she got puffy enough to where she was having trouble hiding it, and then she said, “Okay, we’re going to have to come clean.”\n\nI remember she and I went to talk to Chris [Christopher C.] Kraft, who then was the Center Director. We had requested an audience with him and the two of us went in there and sat down at his table. I think what he said was, “Okay, I’m figuring you’re either here to tell me the two of you are getting divorced or that you’re going to have a baby.” We said, “Fortunately we’re here to tell you that yes, we’re having a baby.”\n\nI don’t remember how the press release came about. Maybe Dr. Kraft tipped off PAO [Public Affairs Office] or somebody, unless Rhea has some other recollection of it. I’m not even sure I remember. Wait a minute. Now that I think about it, there was something in People magazine in that little section that they had called Milestones, I think. It just said, “Expecting, Dr. Rhea Seddon.” I do remember seeing that in People magazine. I don’t know if she has a copy of that or not, or if I have a copy of it. That’s about all I remember about that.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Do you remember talking with John [W.] Young or George [W.S.] Abbey about that?\n\nGibson: We must have, but I don’t remember it now. It was really memorable talking to Dr. Kraft. I don’t know whether we would have told John first and then told Dr. Kraft. The right way chain of command-wise would be to have gone to John Young first and then George Abbey and then Dr. Kraft. I don’t remember if that’s what we did. If we didn’t, we should have.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Did you tell the whole Astronaut Office at the Monday morning meeting?\n\nGibson: Yes. She wanted me to announce it. We went to the Monday morning meeting when we were going to reveal it, and when John Young was asking, “Any comments from the floor?” or something like that, I raised my hand and I stood up. The way I announced it was I said, “I’m here to announce that our total number of astronauts has increased to 80 and a half because Rhea is pregnant,” was how we announced it to everybody. There was a big round of applause. That was the clever way that I told everybody. It was at one of our Monday morning meetings.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Were you surprised by the media interest that Rhea received? You didn’t seem to get much but she received quite a bit.\n\nGibson: Yes, she was the first American mom astronaut. I guess Shannon [W.] Lucid had kids, so she was already a mom before she became an astronaut. Then Rhea was the first American woman astronaut to become pregnant. Yes, that wouldn’t surprise me at all. I don’t remember that much about it. But just because she is who she is, yes, I’m not surprised that it generated a bunch of interest.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Was there any challenge that you saw from your perspective of her being pregnant and being an astronaut? You mentioned she couldn’t fly anymore. But are there other things?\n\nGibson: As soon as they found out they grounded her and said, “Okay, no more T-38 flying.” Then what that forced us to do, us NASA, us the Astronaut Corps, was to institute a policy. Rhea remembers it differently, I think, than I do. I thought what our policy was, they could continue to fly in their first trimester. I’m pretty sure the last time Rhea and I argued—or discussed it, it wasn’t an argument, I just threw that in there—the last time that I remember us talking about it, she said, “No, it was the first two trimesters.” I’d be a little surprised if it was really two trimesters, because you’re getting a pretty big baby at that point in the second trimester.\n\nWhat happens if you have to eject? Is that going to kill the baby? Certainly you’re not going to do any testing on something like that. I should think conservatism would have ruled and that you’d say, “In the first trimester a baby is going to be this big, and we think it can remain implanted and not have a problem with it.” But they came up with a policy on flying.\n\nI’ll take just a second to talk a funny story. I was flying. This was for Rhea’s last flight, and I was the Chief Astronaut then, but I was flying a T-38 out to Edwards Air Force Base [California] because that’s where they were going to land. In my backset I had Dr. Denise [L.] Baisden, who was pregnant, flight of three. I don’t remember who the other guys were, but all of us were supporting the landing. We took off from Houston and flew to Albuquerque to refuel. Then taking off out of Albuquerque we were climbing to let’s just say 20,000 feet. My airplane started shaking, started vibrating. I couldn’t see anything on the instruments.\n\nDenise said on the intercom, “Hoot, what’s that vibration?” I said, “I don’t know what it is.” Then within about 30 seconds the vibration suddenly stopped and a whole bunch of my warning lights came on. It had sheared the gearbox on the right engine? One of the engines. It sheared the gearbox, which takes away your generator for that side, your hydraulic pump for that side. You’ve lost one of your flight control hydraulic systems.\n\nOf course I declared an emergency. I turned around. I told the other guys, “You guys go ahead and press on.” Declared an emergency. As we’re pointing back towards Albuquerque I thought you know what, I better talk to Denise about this. I said, “Denise, I’m not wanting to upset you or scare you, but if something happens to our other engine,” because I had to shut that one down, you can’t run it without the oil pump, so I had to shut down one engine, so now we’re just on one engine, “if something happens to our hydraulic pump or to our one remaining engine we will have to eject. It would happen fast if that happens. Now that’s not going to happen. But if it were to happen, you have to punch yourself out. I can’t punch you out.”\n\nShe knew that because she had trained. I said, “I’m going to start saying eject eject eject eject eject. After I get through about six or eight of them, I’m going to go. You would have to punch yourself out.”\n\nI can’t tell you how nervous I was. Normally I wouldn’t be nervous, but I’ve got this little pregnant doctor in the backseat. Everything was fine. We landed on the runway, had to roll out and stop on the runway because I couldn’t taxi without one of those hydraulics to hold the gear down. Everything went fine. I got to meet that baby at the time of the last Space Shuttle launch, and he’s now 16 years old or something like that. Denise had told him that story. I got to meet him when Rhea and I and the family were down there for the last launch, 16 years old now. Cute little story.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Time flies.\n\nGibson: So then I diverted us already from where we were supposed to go.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: No, no, any time you want to tell anecdotes I think that’s great, but it’s a good segue into what I wanted to ask you about. You were then working as the Deputy Division Chief out of Ellington [Field, Houston, Texas]. You got that assignment at that point around that time.\n\nGibson: When I was assigned to [STS]-41B?\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I think it was a little bit before then. I was trying to look through the paperwork that we had but unfortunately I couldn’t find it. I understand that’s a pretty prime job in the corps, to work out of Ellington, especially for you, being a pilot.\n\nGibson: No, it wasn’t held to be such back then.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: It wasn’t?\n\nGibson: No, it wasn’t. Let me tell you some of the philosophy of it. The title was Deputy Chief of AOD (Aircraft Operations Directorate). The Chief, Joe [Joseph S.] Algranti, was extremely talented and extremely sharp, so wise and knowledgeable in how to maintain a fleet of aircraft and do everything safely, but he could be tough on his people.\n\nThe reason George put an astronaut out there as the Deputy Chief is because an astronaut was immune to him. He couldn’t kill him. Joe Algranti couldn’t kill an astronaut who was his deputy but he would be able to kill any average pilot who was his deputy. It was always an astronaut, to be somewhat immune to Joe Algranti. Also, Joe really liked to fly, and he flew a lot. He flew the KC-135. So he’d be gone on trips and he’d be out and away, and for continuity you had to have somebody there.\n\nYou were out there five, seven days a week. You weren’t visible back in the Astronaut Corps. You weren’t being a CapCom [Capsule Communicator]. You weren’t standing up in the Monday morning meetings and briefing people on, “Here’s the latest thing we found in abort testing.” You were invisible.\n\nI remember I had talked to one of the more senior astronauts and I asked him. Ironically, it was Vance [D.] Brand. I said, “Doesn’t it have some bearing on you getting assigned to a mission to be visible and to be a CapCom and to be where John can see you and where George [can see you]?” The thing I didn’t know was that George felt that this was really important. It wasn’t one of the desired assignments. But there’s a lot to be said for taking an assignment that was considered undesirable and doing it to the best of your ability. I’m pretty sure that’s one of the big reasons why I got one of the early flights. There were some real difficulties out there. Frequently what I had to be was a referee.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Can you give a couple of examples?\n\nGibson: Oh golly, yes. I won’t name any names. One example was that the Chief of Maintenance was looking at the boarding ladders for the T-38s, and he noticed that some of them were missing some of the antiskid. He was talking to some of his maintenance guys and he was saying, “Hey, look, we got to do something about this. We’re going to need to put in place a program where we’re going to replace the antiskid on a bunch.”\n\nThe head of QA [Quality Assurance] out there overheard him and he said, “Oh yes, we got to get in on this too.” Didn’t say anything to the Chief of Maintenance. He told his QA guys to go out there and to red-tag every single boarding ladder that had some missing antiskid on it. These guys are both branch chiefs. Next thing I know I’ve got the Chief of Maintenance in there almost yelling, banging on the table, saying, “You need to do something about QA because they come in and here’s what happened,” and explained the whole thing to me. So I wind up being the referee and going to QA and saying, “Hey, come on. You’ve red-tagged virtually every single ladder out there. We’ve got to back off of some of those, because we need to be using them to man up airplanes. So how about backing off the ones that aren’t quite as bad?” It was that way all the time.\n\nThe Chief of Maintenance had a running battle with engineering. They both hated each other. The engineers hated the Chief of Maintenance. The Chief of Maintenance hated the engineers. I was constantly refereeing battles between those guys.\n\nThen there was an employee that George had got stuck with out of some kind of a trade deal that he wanted to get rid of. This guy could, I think, sense that they wanted to get rid of him. He was really uncooperative with everything. They finally did manage to get rid of him. It was just a constant battle and a constant annoyance. You were on the other side of the tracks from JSC. They had a chili team at one point out there from AOD and I don’t remember what they called themselves, but they had this T-shirt made up. Here they were at AOD, then you had the railroad tracks, and then you had JSC shining in the background compared to AOD out there on the other side of the tracks.\n\nThat was how they felt themselves to be. It was really a fascinating place to get to work, because I learned a whole lot about maintenance and about quality assurance and about the rigor that we have to put into those airplanes. Joe Algranti, to his credit, he was absolutely rabid over astronaut airplanes, because we had airplanes that astronauts were going to be flying. Of course those were the T-38s. There had to be two levels of quality assurance. We had a NASA QA guy, quality assurance. The contractor had a quality control guy, a QC guy. Any of the airplanes that the astronauts were going to be in had to be signed off by two quality guys.\n\nI just learned so very much from working out there and from getting to see how Joe Algranti worked and how he operated. Most of the time he was just wonderful. He was just such a great leader. Every once in a while he could be so hard-edged and so accusatory with his people. I was out there another time. One of the QA guys came to me because in a Monday morning meeting Joe had been harsh on him, and I had to pat him on the back and tell him, “There, there,” and try to calm him down. I was out there to be a peacemaker.\n\nIt was fascinating, and I learned a whole heck of a lot out of it. As I say, it wasn’t a plum assignment like being a CapCom where you were visible and everybody saw you, and that was a real rapid way into a flight, being a CapCom. But I wound up being the fourth pilot to fly out of our 15, so taking a less than desirable assignment and doing a good job with it is always a good thing to do.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I’ve heard that from a lot of people at JSC. You must all share that knowledge. Did you get a chance to fly other planes since you were out there? Like the SCA [Shuttle Carrier Aircraft] or some of the other planes?\n\nGibson: Not the SCA. Joe Algranti was putting me in the pilot-in-command seat on the STAs [Shuttle Training Aircraft]. What I would do is I’d go out and fly, for example, with Charlie [Charles F.] Hayes. He would be in the right seat, and that’s where the pilot-in-command sits. He’d be in the right seat, and we’d go out there. I don’t even remember if that was the way we did it. It might be that they put me in the right seat for takeoff, and I’d take it off and fly the airplane around for a while and then come back in and shoot touch-and-gos in it. So he was actually letting me operate the [Gulfstream] G-II. That’s right. I got to add that to my list. I forgot about listing that one.\n\nHe was letting me fly that. Then George Abbey got wind of it and George I think told him, “Stop doing that.” The words were, “I don’t want to make an STA IP [Instructor Pilot] out of him, I want to get him in the Shuttle. Don’t have him flying the STA anymore”. I guess really whoever’s going to fly that airplane—because the pilot in the other seat can’t do anything about it. The only controls are on the right side in the STA. All of those guys had been through thorough rigorous training, exams, and I had not. I just hopped in the seat and flew it. Really safetywise we shouldn’t have been doing that. I did get to fly that, and I got to fly test ops when we’d have a T-38 come out of maintenance. The astronauts didn’t get to do that. We did not let them fly test ops, but I got to fly test ops.\n\nOh yes, I got to be part of a flameout program. We were having trouble with our engines way back then, and Joe Algranti, once again, here’s the kind of leadership. The Chief of Maintenance said, “Well, I don’t think there’s anything we can do about this. These engines are getting old. The tolerances, maybe they just won’t survive up at high altitude.” The Air Force had just said, “Okay, you can’t go above whatever altitude, 37,000 feet.” Joe said, “No. The way we fly these things, we are doing a lot of cross-country [travel]. There’s a lot of times you need to go to 45,000 feet to get over thunderstorms, and we have to be able to operate these airplanes up at altitude, so we are going to do a program to take [on] these problem engines.” A problem engine was an engine that had a flameout up at altitude for no apparent reason. He had designated a number of these engines. “We’re going to go fix those things.”\n\nSo I got to fly some of the test flights on that. Actually I got to fly the very first one with one of those problem engines, and we went up to 45,000 feet. I had Frank [J.] Marlow in the backseat. I was in the front seat. We were up at 45,000 feet, and we had to be able to pull the engine all the way to idle and then bring it back up to 100% rpm [rates per minute] and then light the afterburner at 45,000 feet. The Air Force had given up on that years ago. They had said, “You can’t take it above some altitude, 37,000 feet, something like that. No operations above that.” We couldn’t live with that.\n\nI remember on this problem engine, sure enough it flamed out. We got one engine out. There was a problem in the electrical system. The generator on the good engine didn’t pick up the power on the other side, so the indication in the backseat to Frank was that the remaining engine was way overtemped. I could just barely hear him. He said, “It’s overtemping, it’s overtemping. Shut it down, shut it down.” So I shut down the other engine. So now we got no engines.\n\nWe are totally flamed out. No big deal, we glided back down, got into the airstart envelope. We’re up over 40,000 feet. You can’t relight till you get down to 26,000. So we’re a glider for quite a while here. Anyway, we got back down and got both engines restarted. Naturally we terminated the rest of the test op [operation] and came back and landed. I got to fly a number of other engine checkout flights, and by golly, Joe had figured out—first thing we’re going to change is something called the T2 sensor because that caused problems in the past. The next thing is going to be the T5 sensor. If that doesn’t work we’re going to rebuild the fuel control. If that doesn’t work then we’re going to tear the engine down to zero and rebuild the whole compressor. By golly, he eliminated all of those problem engines. We fixed every one of them. The Air Force had given up on it. We did not, and Joe’s persistence got us through it to where we had a bunch of good engines that weren’t flaming out anymore.\n\nOne thing that really lit him off was we had had two astronauts in formation coming back from El Paso [Forward Operating Location and T-38 Depot], and they both had dual flameouts. All four engines flamed out on these two airplanes at night, I think, in the weather. They both got restarted okay. I think that was the straw that Joe Algranti said, “Okay, we are not going to live with this anymore. We are going to fix these things.” There was some reluctance on the part of the Chief of Maintenance, who saw it as a waste of time. He was wrong about that. We fixed every one of those things.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: How many T-38s did you guys have at that point? Do you recall?\n\nGibson: We had about 30, somewhere around there, 31, 32, 30, something like that. I think they’re down to 20 now. They didn’t need quite as many of them.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: There’s not as many people in the Office anymore.\n\nGibson: That’s true. When I was Chief Astronaut I remember my number was 113. There were 113 astronauts then.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Did you get your choice of flying time at least, being out there at Ellington?\n\nGibson: Not really, because everything went by a priority system. You had priority one through eight. Eight was everything else. Pri one was the next crew. Pri two was mission support for the next mission, so the chase pilots if there were chase pilots. I guess all the guys working down at the Cape [Canaveral, Florida] on the vehicle processing would be priority two. When I was a chase plane pilot, we were priority two. Everything in support of the next mission would be pri two.\n\nIf I just wanted to do a cross-country I was in the same boat. Although I bet they took care of me a little bit, because I was the Deputy Chief out there. They probably had a tendency to try to slip you an airplane when they could.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I’m curious if you were at this meeting or not. Were you in attendance when George Abbey announced he was going to be flying STS-7, 8, and 9? If so, what do you remember about that?\n\nGibson: Oh golly, yes. I remember that vividly. We knew that it was coming because it was about time for those crews to be named. Yes, I remember George started off. I remember what he said. He said, “Well, we hoped when we first picked you guys that by three years into it,” or however it was he said it, “we’d be about ready to start assigning some of you guys to the first missions.” I had predicted Rick [Frederick H.] Hauck.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: You did?\n\nGibson: I had predicted. I said, “Rick Hauck is going to be the PLT [Pilot] on the very first flight. He’s going to be the first one out of our class to fly.”\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Why’d you think that? I’m just curious.\n\nGibson: He’s just that sharp. He’s just that sharp and that good. Oh, and he had been in a very visible job as well, a very challenging job. He’d been in a very visible position as well. I had predicted that one. George then went into the rest of it. He announced here’s who the 7 crew is going to be, here’s who the 8 crew is going to be, and here’s the 9 crew. I remember that vividly. You felt so jealous. You felt sad that you weren’t on there. But then when I looked at everybody that got assigned I said, “Well, okay. There’s not anybody there that I should have been assigned in place of,” to myself.\n\nI remember when the meeting ended and everybody stood up, the first person I bumped into was Brewster [H.] Shaw. I held my hand out and shook his hand and said, “Way to go, Brewster.” Then that night there was a celebration. The celebration was at a bar that used to be over there in one of the high-rises called the Atrium. A whole bunch of us showed up there to celebrate.\n\nThere was a funny story. Of course George Abbey was there, and the crews were all there. They were buying beer, the guys who had been assigned. Steve [Steven A.] Hawley and I had always been friends from way way back, and we were talking. I said, “Hey, Stevie, let’s go talk to George.” He said, “Okay.”\n\nSo he and I walked over to George. Poor Stevie had no idea what I was about to do. We walked over to George and we said, “Hey, George.” “Hi, boys.” Something like “Oh, this is a big day for us.” I said, “Well, George, Stevie and I wanted you to know that you really screwed up today.” He said, “Oh? How’s that?” Stevie about that time is wishing he was anywhere else. I said, “Well, you didn’t assign us.”\n\nYou’ve got to have a little bit of a sense of humor about the whole thing. Yes, all of us that didn’t get assigned were disappointed. I remember the next day Rhea and I bumped into somebody in the corps and said, “Hey, we didn’t see you last night at the celebration.” He said, “I didn’t feel much like celebrating.” Well, that’s not a good attitude. I think yes, sure, we were disappointed, you’re always disappointed when you didn’t get picked, but doggone it, let’s go celebrate on behalf of those that did.\n\nI’ll never forget saying, “George, Stevie and I wanted to tell you you really screwed up today.”\n\nRoss-Nazzal: What was Steve’s reaction? Did he just move into the background?\n\nGibson: I think he gulped his beer or something when I said that. He went, “Lup.” When was that? Actually that’s about the time I got assigned to go out to Ellington. Because I had been working in SAIL [Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory] and I [when] went out to AOD it would have been in ’82.\n\nSo we would have been assigning those crews. Sally [K. Ride] flew in June of ’83, so we would have been assigning them June of ’82. I had been working in SAIL up to that point. George smiled real big when I told him, “Hey, you screwed up, you didn’t assign me and Stevie.” He smiled really big, and we chatted a little bit. He said, “Hey, why don’t you come and see me tomorrow?” So I remember I thought, “Oh, okay, great. He’s going to give me STS-10.” No. I got over to his office and he told me he wanted me to go out to Ellington and be the Deputy Chief. That happened all right there at the same time.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: It’s interesting because I always thought that that was just a primo position. Plus, being a pilot, I just presumed that it would be a great thing for you.\n\nGibson: Actually it was looked at quite the opposite. People didn’t really want to go out there. Now the other thing that George said—these are his words, I’m not the one saying it, it’s a little bit self-serving because I was Navy—he said, “I have got to have a Navy officer out there as the Deputy. The Air Force guys don’t actually have the right kind of background and training from the way the Air Force runs things operationally and maintenancewise.” He said, “It’s got to be a Navy or Marine Corps guy out there.” That was the way George looked at it. So if you look back at it, Bob [Robert F.] Overmyer had been there. Dave [David M.] Walker had been there. Then Mike [Michael J.] Smith had been out there. I replaced Mike Smith in fact. Dick [Richard N.] Richards. It was always—I think maybe Bob [Robert D.] Cabana might have been out there for a tour as well.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Bob Cabana was out there, yes.\n\nGibson: So it was always Navy or Marine that George was going to send out there.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: What did Mike Smith tell you before you went out there? Did he give you a heads up about the job?\n\nGibson: Oh golly, yes. We had quite a big turnover. He was just such a dear friend as well. I think last time we might have—no, I don’t think we did talk about it. I had known him since 1976. He was one of my instructors at test pilot school. He didn’t apply for the ’78 selection because I’m sure he would have booted me out of that class. They would have picked him instead of me. He did apply for the ’80 class and that’s what put him in with the ’80 group. That’s what put him on Challenger [STS-51L]. If he had applied in ’78, who knows?\n\nI had known him since test pilot school in ’76. He was just a water walker. He was just a wonderful guy, nice human being, excellent pilot, excellent aircrew. Really good at handling political things and just really a great guy. He did a lot of training. We’ll talk about [STS]-61C I know. Prior to 61C George assigned him to take [US Congressman] Bill Nelson under his wing and coach him and help him and train him to help Bill Nelson adapt to being a Space Shuttle crew member. Bill Nelson got to know Mike Smith quite well in addition.\n\nMike spent quite a bit of time showing me all the stuff he had organized. Whoever was Chief before him wasn’t quite as organized as Mike Smith was. Mike had really organized Joe Algranti’s filing system and had really been a real attribute out there at AOD. I remember one of the secretaries after I’d been there for a little while. It was a positive comment about Mike. It’s going to be a little self-serving because it was a positive comment about me as well, but she said, “Oh, we’ve been so lucky lately with you guys coming out here to be the Deputy Chief. It’s just been a really big help for us.” Mike Smith started that. Whoever was ahead of him wasn’t quite as good to work with and maybe stirred things up a little bit out there. Starting with Mike Smith, they had a real string of people that they really enjoyed.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Let’s talk about 41B and learning that you had an actual mission. You were going to be fourth in line, like you said.\n\nGibson: There’s a funny story there too. That was when I got told. I don’t remember if I was over there anyway. This was while I was out at AOD. Either that or George said, “Hey, why don’t you come over and talk to me?” It was one of the farthest things away from my mind, because I didn’t even realize it was time to be assigning another crew. We had assigned 7, 8, and 9. Then at some point after that we assigned 10, which was a DoD [Department of Defense] mission. TK [Thomas K.] Mattingly with Loren [J.] Shriver as pilot, Ellison [S.] Onizuka, I think.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Yes, I think Ellison flew with Loren.\n\nGibson: Was it Jim [James F.] Buchli? Shouldn’t have been Jim Buchli. STS-10 got assigned. I showed up over at George’s and came in and sat down at his little conference table. It was George, and Vance Brand was sitting in there. Didn’t even occur to me. Nothing even occurred to me at all.\n\nGeorge said, “Well, okay.” I think at that point I’d been out at AOD for a year and a half. George said, “Okay, you’ve been out at AOD for a year and a half now. Have you given any thought to what you might like to do next?” I said, “Oh gee, well, no, sir. No, I hadn’t really thought about it. I think everybody would like to be a CapCom, because that’s just really a neat job and really a good job. So I’d like to be a CapCom.”\n\nThen he said, “Well, have you got any interest in any of the upcoming missions?” Can you imagine what I said next?\n\nRoss-Nazzal: What’d you say?\n\nGibson: “Huh?”\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I thought you were going to say, “No.”\n\nGibson: I mumbled something like, “Well, yes.” He said, “Okay, well, if you’re not against it, if you’re not averse to it, we’re thinking that maybe you might like to go with Mr. Brand here on STS-11.”\n\nAt that point I’m just speechless. I’m going, “Huh, huh.” He said, “Okay. Well, the press release probably isn’t going to go out until tomorrow. So keep this to yourself. Don’t go call a press conference and announce it. The press release is probably going to go out tomorrow.” Jennifer, I don’t remember if he told me who the rest of the crew members were at that time or not. Probably my brain was a blur from there on anyway. I remember walking out of there. At that point Mike Smith was the Bubba up there, George’s horse holder up there, and he walked up to me in the hallway. He said, “Is it a mission?” I said, “Yes, it is.” He said, “Wow, congratulations!” Another one of those little moments that somebody you think so highly of was happy for you.\n\nThen I remember the very next day I had a PR [Public Relations event] in Camarillo, California. I was speaking to 3M. It hadn’t been released yet, so I was out there. I think right before I was due to go up on stage and talk I got a phone call from Sylvia [A.] Salinas, if I remember right. “Okay, the press release is going out, so you can tell everybody.” So I got to tell them at this [event]. That was my first public announcement of it. “I just found out yesterday I’m going to be flying STS-11,” which of course got changed into 41B. That’s the way I found out about it.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Of course you went and told Rhea, I presume.\n\nGibson: Of course. Yes, I don’t remember if I asked George or if he just said, “Yes, of course you can tell Rhea.” I probably called Mom and Dad that night. I suspect I called Mom and Dad that night to tell them.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Because why not? That’s not a public announcement.\n\nGibson: Oh yes, but would have told them, “Hey, don’t blab it.”\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Don’t go telling the LA Times.\n\nGibson: Yes.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: If you would talk about that crew and the crew relationship, that was a diverse crew. Had you worked with any of those folks before?\n\nGibson: No. I had not worked—except when Vance Brand was commanding STS-5, of course we did the SAIL testing for his software load. One of the things that we would always do as the SAIL guys—at that point I was the lead astronaut over there at SAIL—we would have a briefing for the crew, but that was about the extent of having worked with Vance. We got together and we gave him a brief on his software load for STS-5 and how all the testing had gone and what sorts of things we had been through and that everything was fine.\n\nThe other guys, no, I had not worked with them. Vance was the only one of us who had flown. He got four rookies to go with him. He got Bob [Robert L.] Stewart, Ron [Ronald E.] McNair, and Bruce McCandless. Of course for us, the ’78 guys, it had been five and a half years. For Bruce, it had been 16 years. It had been 16 years since he came in to when he finally got to fly. Those of us that were getting to go for a ride that early, five and a half years after we came in the door, shoot, we were the lucky ones.\n\nThey were an interesting crew. Ron McNair had worked the robot arm, the RMS (Remote Manipulator System), so naturally he got assigned to RMS. I got assigned to be his backup, so he and I trained together a whole lot, both here in Houston at the SMS and over in Building 9 with the simulator that’s over there for the RMS. He and I flew up to Canada, Toronto, in the wintertime. Talk about dumb—in a T-38. We flew to Scott Air Force Base [Illinois] and went through customs there and then into Canada. It was freezing up there. I don’t remember what month it was we went. It must have been December, but oh golly, was it cold up there. Ron and I spent a whole lot of time together. We got to be really good friends.\n\nVance was really good about getting us all together. So he threw a party for all of us over at his house. Then picking up the lead from him, I invited everybody to Rhea’s and my house for a dinner party. We got to be really good buddies. In fact we did a 25-year reunion out in Colorado. Vance, and let’s see. Vance and Bruce both live out there. We went to Vail, got to go skiing for our 25-year reunion. Ron McNair’s widow Cheryl came out for it as well. We wound up being a very close crew.\n\nBruce was set in his ways, so he could be a little difficult sometimes. I shouldn’t say difficult. With Bruce there was one way to do it and that was the right way. Very good, very devoted, very hardworking, very studious.\n\nBot Stewart had done a whole lot of work on Orbiter reentry and landing as part of the lab out there in California. Last time we couldn’t agree if it was FCL [Flight Control Laboratory or FSL [Flight Systems Laboratory], FSL or FCL, but it was one of those two. Bob had worked out there quite a bit refining the flight control gains and had flown a whole bunch of simulations. Of course Bob was the very first Army officer ever to go to space.\n\nOf course this was Vance’s third flight, so he had flown of course Apollo-Soyuz [Test Project] and then STS-5 and now STS-11 that was supposed to be the eleventh flight. We wound up being the tenth flight because STS-10 got delayed. I don’t know. Was it ever unclassified about why they got delayed? I’m not even sure.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I’m not sure. Every time I talk to somebody who has a DoD mission they tell me they can’t tell me much at all.\n\nGibson: I’m going to take a chance that it was unclassified. There was a problem on STS—which one took up the first TDRS [Tracking and Data Relay Satellite]?\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I think it was [STS]-6.\n\nGibson: Six, okay. There was a problem with the IUS [Inertial Upper Stage]. That’s what delayed STS-10 because they were using the IUS. They wound up slipping, so 41B, STS-11 wound up being the tenth launch. That’s why we slipped into the tenth place.\n\nNow I’ll probably go to jail because that was probably still secret. No, actually I don’t think it is. I don’t think it is, because in the case of [STS]-27, for example, I am allowed to say that we went to 57 degrees. We carried a major new DoD intelligence satellite, deployed it with the robot arm.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: You didn’t test duct tape as Rhea says in her book? I think that’s what she said. You went to space to test duct tape.\n\nGibson: To test duct tape. Yes, because the only photos that we could really show are us in the cabin, and there’s a photo of me sitting in the commander’s seat. Behind my seat stuck to the wall is a whole roll of duct tape. So frequently I would show that slide when I was talking and say, “Well, I really can’t tell you anything about the mission except that we were there to test duct tape.”\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I thought that was amusing.\n\nGibson: Yes, 41B, well, I was disappointed. Vance felt that I was going to be overloaded, and I wasn’t. I was never overloaded. I had worked in SAIL, so I had a whole lot of experience flying missions. I had had another project that George had assigned me to called display verification. I was one of the few guys out of the ’78 class getting simulator time because Steve Nagel and myself and a gal from MOD [Mission Operations Directorate], George assigned us a task of going through and checking all the displays and make sure they’re working the way they’re supposed to in the SMS [Shuttle Mission Simulator]. So we were getting sim time. We’d get a four-hour block of simulator time. We didn’t just go in there and say, “Okay, hey, let’s do an ascent; okay, hey, let’s do an entry.” We built a test plan, and we had all the things we were going to test. I’ll bet we put in probably three hours’ for every hour of sim time that we got. If we had a four-hour block of simulator time we would have worked on this plan for several days, putting together what we were going to do.\n\nAs a result, we got to fly ascents and RTLSs [Return to Launch Sites] and reentries and orbit and check everything out. We found a bunch of problems on the displays. We found something. I don’t even remember what it was, Jennifer. But there was an item entry on a keyboard. Pretty sure it was on SPEC 50. If you entered this item it shut down the Orbiter’s engines. It shut down the engines. We found that in the simulator. That would have killed the crew.\n\nWe found a bunch of things that weren’t working right, some of the software for the flight control positions, the elevon positions, was backwards. So they weren’t indicating correctly.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I have to ask. Was this before STS-1?\n\nGibson: This is before STS-1.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Double-checking.\n\nGibson: Yes, this is before. Yes, really.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: We’ve been flying five flights. “Hey, by the way.”\n\nGibson: A lot of it was we’d spend hours in there and not come up with anything. But then other things that we did find, all it took was there was a plus sign that was flipped or should have been a minus sign. We enabled them to fix a bunch of the software.\n\nI really was not overloaded. I had had a bunch of sim time already, but Vance was worried about me because I was doing RMS. This was my first flight. I was PLT, so I’m second in command. If something happens to him I’m going to be the commander. He didn’t let me do rendezvous training. Rendezvous is so cool. I really was disappointed when he told me I didn’t get to do rendezvous training. He and Bruce got to be the ones who trained on how to do the rendezvous.\n\nBecause we were going to do the first test of the rendezvous software, we called it the lead balloon. We had a 200-pound balloon that was an inflatable two-meter balloon, Mylar-covered, so it would be reflective for the radar. In order for it to have some mass—it had to have some mass because there’s just enough atmosphere even at 160 miles that something real lightweight would get deorbited, so it had 200 pounds of lead in it; it was a lead balloon. It really was a lead balloon.\n\nWe were going to deploy this thing, separate away from it, and then fly a rendezvous on it and actually come up close and rendezvous with it. It didn’t work out, because instead of inflating, it exploded. There was that funny story. It deployed, and it was supposed to inflate two minutes after we launched it. We’re sitting there watching it and watching it and watching it, and it didn’t inflate. We’re calling the ground and saying, “No, it hasn’t inflated yet.” Then it exploded.\n\nBob Stewart keyed the mike and he said, “Houston, it just blew up.” Half of Mission Control stood up and cheered and the other half went, “Oh no, it blew up!” The two of them looked at each other, and they said, “Well, why are you cheering?” “Well, why are you unhappy? It just blew up. We better ask him what he means.” Because we didn’t have live TV on it, they called up and said, “When you said it just blew up, what did you mean by that?” He said, “It just exploded.” They said, “Oh.”\n\nRoss-Nazzal: That would be a great picture to get.\n\nGibson: The wording is important. It just blew up. That can mean two different things.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Exactly.\n\nGibson: Which it did. I did not get to train on rendezvous. I was disappointed with that. I didn’t get to do that until STS-27. Oh, now I have to shoot you.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: With a roll of duct tape, right? That’s what you were rendezvousing with?\n\nGibson: [STS]-41B was just a really fascinating mission to be training on because it was set to possibly be the first Cape Canaveral landing, which in fact we were, because 7 was going to try to go there, 8 was not. I guess the only one that really missed out was STS-7. [Robert L.] Crippen and Rick Hauck and Sally, that crew, they were possibly going to go back to the Cape. I guess the weather just didn’t work out, so they couldn’t go there.\n\nSTS-8 was planned to be the first night landing, so they weren’t going to go to the Cape. STS-9, I don’t even remember if that was a possibility for them. They were the first Spacelab, John Young and Brewster Shaw. I don’t remember now whether they were possibly going to go there. I guess it was apparent that there was a chance we were going to be the first Florida landing.\n\nWe were going to be the first test of the MMU [Manned Maneuvering Unit]. That was a really nice reward for Bruce McCandless who had worked on EVA [Extravehicular Activity] and worked with the MMU and all the development and all the training and the engineering for years and years and years. It’s one of those just rewards that he got to be the first one to fly the MMU. He and Bob Stewart, of course, trained extensively on that to get to do that.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I wanted to ask you about training for this mission, because of course you train a lot more on the ground than you do spending time in space. I was wondering if there are any humorous anecdotes or anything you remember about say contingency EVA training.\n\nGibson: Not that really comes to mind too much about anything funny. Ron and I both trained very extensively to put Bob or Bruce on the foot platform. We did the first test of that as well to where you put this foot platform on the end of the RMS and then an astronaut could slip their boots into it and then we could maneuver him all around the different places in the cargo bay.\n\nWe also had a satellite, the Shuttle Pallet Satellite (SPAS). It was in the cargo bay. One of the things we were going to do was grapple it with the arm, take it out of the cargo bay, and hold it up on top of the arm and rotate it at one degree per second. Bruce and/or Bob were going to practice flying up and attaching to it with the TPAD, (Trunnion Pin Alignment Device), that they were going to use on STS-13 [STS-41C] to go fix the Solar Max satellite.\n\nWe spent a lot of time training over in Building 9 with actually lifting out a big cardboard SPAS and doing all that. Let me think. I don’t think we had anything funny. Vance wanted to be IVA [Intravehicular Activity] on that one, so he’s the one that went to all the training with Bob and Bruce when they were doing their EVA training. He’s the one that helped them into their suits and out of their suits, because he particularly wanted to do that.\n\nHe had had the experience on STS-5 of one of the crew members who got so very ill that they couldn’t do anything. So Vance realized, you know what, everything that we do has got to have a backup for it; there’s got to be two people assigned to every single thing that we do. Shoot, that was a great idea. I utilized that every time I was mission commander as well. We’re going to have a prime and a backup for everything. I guess the one crew member on STS-5 was so disabled he couldn’t do anything. It was a big hiccup to that mission because there were some things that he was the one that knew how to do them and nobody else did. We all trained very extensively. There were always two people for every single system or every single evolution that we were doing.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I understand you did most of the photography for the mission. Did you do a lot of training on the ground before you went up there?\n\nGibson: Oh golly, yes. That’s one of those areas that everybody loved to train on, photography. I had been a photography nut virtually all my life. I remember when I got in the Navy a bunch of my buddies when I was going through pilot training—you wanted to have a camera so you could take pictures along the way. Most of them went out and bought some little cheapie camera, not me. I went out and bought a pretty fancy camera. When I went to Japan the first time, which was on my first cruise, holy smokes, I’m right here where Nikon cameras are built. I bought myself one of the really fancy nice Nikon cameras.\n\nI had been an enthusiast of photography for most of my life. Then we get to NASA and you get to train even more on it. The reason that I got to shoot that famous picture of Bruce McCandless up in orbit, and I always got to laugh when I tell this story when I’m speaking, the reason that I was there parked by the window with camera in hand, was that on the spacewalk as the pilot, the copilot, I was the only person on the crew that had absolutely nothing to do. Vance was fretting about our free-flying astronauts. Ron McNair was operating the TV cameras to keep them in sight and keep a laser tracker pointed at them. I’m sitting there with nothing to do.\n\nSo I had the camera in hand and I will just never forget looking through the viewfinder when Bruce got just barely outside the bay. The reason he’s at an angle something like 28 degrees or 32 degrees to the horizon is because we were at an angle of 28, 32 degrees to the horizon. It was to give us the best Ku-band communication coverage to the ground. I think it was so they could have live television. Ron McNair’s job was to keep them right in the center of the TV picture so that that could be going to the ground.\n\nThen we also had a laser range finder, and we were keeping an eye on them. They were to go out to 300 feet and stop there and then come back. I’m sitting there with just nothing to do. I’m the only one left inside because there were five of us and we got two guys outside. But I looked through that viewfinder the very first time and I didn’t even take a picture. I put it down and I said, “Oh my gosh, I can’t believe what an image this is.”\n\nI got real serious about taking photos. This was with a Hasselblad camera. The Hasselblad is manual everything. The focus is manual, the f-stop, and the shutter speed are all manual. For every photo that I shot, I probably did three light meter readings, and I probably checked the focus four times before I actually squeezed the trigger and shot a picture. The one thing that they had taught us in photography training was we humans don’t like to see the horizon tilted. If I had just looked square out the window and taken a picture of Bruce, it would have looked like this [demonstrates], and the horizon would have been at a screwy angle in the photo.\n\nOne of the things that I did that I have to admit was really the ideal technique was I’m looking out the window at him. I tilted the camera to put the horizon level in the pictures, because we were at an angle to the horizon. Every once in a while Ron McNair would pick up a camera and shoot a couple photos. He wasn’t tilting the camera. So that’s how I could tell which pictures I shot and which ones Ron shot.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I was curious about that, yes.\n\nGibson: Ron shot the ones where you see the horizon on an angle. They made interesting pictures as well, but I didn’t shoot any that way. Every photo that I shot I tilted the camera to put the horizon level in the picture.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Was that something that you had—not the horizon—but had you prepared before the flight in your head—these are the kind of shots that I want to make sure that we get to capture the history of this mission?\n\nGibson: We knew the MMU flight was going to be interesting, but I don’t think I had really appreciated how spectacular that was going to look and how fascinating it was going to be. I remember as I was doing this I said to myself, “Wow, if I don’t mess these pictures up, I’m going to get the cover of Aviation Week.” I actually got three covers of Aviation Week.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: What were the other two?\n\nGibson: One was that pretty famous picture of Bruce. The thing to realize about that picture was, Jennifer, there wasn’t just one of them. I must have shot 20 pictures of him as he was separating away. There was a whole sequence. Our old motto was hey, film is cheap, so shoot up a whole roll. Hasselblad, it was real quick to change magazines. We kept spares right there. It was just a whole bunch of photos, one right after the other.\n\nThen what Bruce did was once he got far enough away he aligned himself with the horizon. Then he was straight up and down. So when he was way out there he was straight up and down. As he got back in and got close, he aligned himself with the Orbiter once again, as he came back into the cargo bay. So we’ve got a whole slug of shots.\n\nWhen Bruce did the translation, the lighting was just perfect. He was just being totally lit up. When Bob did it, it wasn’t quite as perfect. We got some good pictures of Bob as well, but the ones that really stood out were the ones of Bruce. When it was Bob’s turn he didn’t have the same Sun angle that we had for Bruce. That’s how all that got done.\n\nThe other pictures that I referred to, there was a photo I shot of Bruce on the end of the RMS looking at us, and he was out there in the cargo bay. That was an artistic photo as well, I have to admit, because I’m looking out the aft window. The RMS was pointing such that Bruce would have been facedown towards the cargo bay of the Orbiter. At one point Vance said, “Hey, Bruce, look here at the camera.” Bruce bent at his waist and so made a bend and was looking at us. What I did was I shifted the camera so that he wasn’t right in the center of the picture. I put him on the edge and the Orbiter’s rudder on the other edge of the picture. That made a really cool photo. That photo got used in an ad for Hasselblad cameras. I think maybe that one was on the cover of Aviation Week. Then the other one was the picture of Bruce way out there at 300 feet. I think those were the three that made it onto Aviation Week on the cover.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: This just occurred to me because I remember this being an issue a few years ago. It’s not necessarily to do with the flight. There was an artist, Dido, who had used I think that image of him way out there. Were you involved at all in that hubbub?\n\nGibson: Oh golly, yes. No, not involved at all, but I read about it. Apparently Bruce was suing her. I saw that CD in a store, and I bought a copy of it. It wouldn’t have occurred to me to say, “Hey, you’re using this without my permission.” I think it was a little silly to sue her for it, just my opinion. He was suing her because she was using his likeness. You can’t even tell it’s Bruce. He had his gold visor down the whole time. Bob kept his up so you could see his face in the photos, but Bruce had his gold visor down. It was a picture of a spacesuit is what it was. Even though I’m the one that took that photo—because the horizon was level, so I know I took the photo, more power to her. I think it’s great.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I thought it was interesting. I always just assumed those images were part of the public domain.\n\nGibson: They are in the public domain. That’s the other thing. You don’t need permission to use them. But I suppose—well, lawyers will do anything. If you tell them, “I want to sue this nice gal,” they’ll do it.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: What we’ll do at the end when we get your final copy, we’ll put on the Web, we’ll put those photos, and we’ll differentiate. We’ll show a picture of Ron’s and show a picture of yours. I think that would be a good idea. I think it would be interesting.\n\nGibson: I’ve seen some of Ron’s pictures in other magazines where they’re talking about photography. The description on this one says, “The horizon being at an angle makes for a really interesting photograph.” I’m thinking, “This is totally opposite of what we got trained.” But it did. I think it made an interesting picture as well.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: That’s fascinating. I had heard that he had shot that photo, but then I had read in other sources that you shot the photo. So it reminded me of the Apollo 8 earthrise image. I thought well, who really shot that photo, you know how everyone takes credit for it. That’s great, so we can differentiate.\n\nGibson: Yes, we can, because the camera that I was using had the 80-millimeter lens and the one Ron used had the 250. The ones Ron shot were at a farther distance away, but then the telephoto brings it up closer. The big way was that every single one that I shot I made the horizon level, so that’s how I could tell.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I always like to ask people, especially their first mission, to walk us through your memories of that day: getting up at crew quarters, getting ready, the breakfast, all the way through launch and getting up into space that first time. What are your recollections of it?\n\nGibson: We launched right on time.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Very unusual.\n\nGibson: We were projected to launch on February 3rd. Maybe January 31st, early in the training. But for the longest time it was to be February 3rd. We headed down to Cape Canaveral and gee, we had it made, because we had three pilots. At the time our military pilot mission specialists could still fly the T-38s. Later on that got to be no, they can’t. We had Vance, myself, and Bruce, so we could fit our whole crew into three T-38s. We had all our own pilots, we didn’t have to round up an extra pilot, which frequently crews had to do that. It was no problem because everybody was happy to go along on the trip down to the Cape.\n\nWe were aiming at February 3rd, and of course that worked out. Rhea had a big party, I guess threw a big party down at the Cape. You always did that because otherwise you don’t get to see your launch guests. Rhea and the kids would be on the LCC [Launch Control Center] roof and all your launch guests would be at I guess the Banana River site was what it was. They’d all be there.\n\nOh golly, everybody showed up for it. I had a whole gang. All of my brothers and sisters were there for it. That was just so great because we counted down and lifted off right on time at 7:00 a.m. on February 3rd. The schedule was such that we didn’t have to be in bed when night viewing happened, so Vance said we would go to the night viewing. That just creates pandemonium, because all your launch guests are out there for the night viewing, but they’ve got to stay 15 feet away from you.\n\nI remember my daughter Julie, I guess, was eight years old then. Oh, she was crying because she didn’t get to come hold Daddy. Of course that was always challenging to be there at night viewing or at arrival at the Cape. The kids could see you, but they couldn’t come near you. That was always tough on them. So we went to night viewing, and it was pandemonium. The NASA security guys were just having a fit because people were pushing the edge on how close they could come to you. I’m not sure that was a good idea to show up at night viewing. Each person would have 50 guests, and they all wanted to get to say hi and take pictures of you.\n\nThat was fun. I got to see some people I had not seen in years. Then of course next morning bright and early we would have been up at I guess, yes, about two o’clock in the morning, because we get started about five hours before your liftoff time. Then got out there on the launch pad. That’s the first time that you ever saw a living breathing Orbiter, because it had been fueled. You had the liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen in the tank. The thing was hissing and clanking. It sounds like it’s breathing and it’s alive, just really fascinating to see. I’m sure you hear that all the time. It’s just really fascinating to see it on launch morning, because every time you’ve seen it prior to that it wasn’t alive. Electrically it was powered up, but it wasn’t hissing and breathing and clanking and creaking. It was really fascinating to see.\n\nWe climbed in, and the countdown progressed on down. We didn’t have any anomalies and whoosh, off we went. I remember training in the simulator. We’d lift off and we’d get through engine cutoff. Right immediately after that we would do a maneuver to the OMS-2, OMS being Orbital Maneuvering System, to the OMS-2 burn attitude. As we’d come into that attitude, the west coast of Africa would just be coming into view on the visual in the simulator. You’d look at it and you’d say, “Okay, there goes the west coast of Africa.”\n\nI remember on the actual flight we went into that maneuver, we pitched down, and here comes the west coast of Africa. I went, “Vance, look at that.” I grabbed his right shoulder and I said, “Look at that, there’s the west coast of Africa.” He probably looked at me like, “You haven’t seen that before?” Actually I had not, but I’d seen it in the simulator all those times.\n\nWhen you launch, the pilots are pretty preoccupied because you could have all kinds of malfunctions. You could have things going wrong. During launch you’ve got to fix things fast. You’ve got to be really quick about it. For example a navigation error, if you have a problem with your inertial measuring units to where you’ve got a navigation error going, you’ve got to either fix it or engage the backup computer within 10 seconds. An error under that kind of acceleration is going to propagate so big, the vehicle is going to go out of control. They would do that to us in the simulator. They’d give us [malfunctions], and you’ve got to iron it out. So you’re really spring-loaded, you’re on the edge of your seat all the way to orbit.\n\nThen all of a sudden the engines shut down. I remember I got this great big giant smile on my face. I said to myself, “Wow, what a ride. I want to go back and do that again.” We had just arrived. I said, “Let’s turn around and go back and do that again. That was fun.”\n\nYou’re ready technically for all the things you’re going to see. You’ve trained on them; you’ve practiced them all so much in the simulator. You’re not prepared emotionally for the excitement that you’re going to see. That was even true on subsequent missions. It was so exciting that you found yourself getting excited all over again just as much as you did the first time.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Like that E ticket I think Sally talked about.\n\nGibson: Oh golly, yes. That was before direct insertion. We got to cutoff, and we’re going to have to do an OMS-1 burn. The OMS-1 burn was usually, oh shucks, within two minutes. I want to say it was within two minutes of when you got to MECO, which you’ve heard many times of course is Main Engine Cutoff. If I remember right, apogee was only going to be in another two minutes, and you had to get that burn off or you’re going to go back down.\n\nThat was something that we had to do. Right after cutoff we separated from the tank. We load up the OMS-1 burn, and we did our OMS-1 burn, and that all went fine. That put us up to 160 nautical miles for apogee at that point. Then we’re going to have to do another burn at 45 minutes after launch when we reach apogee to bring up perigee and put us in a 160-by-160 orbit. All that stuff just went perfectly. I don’t remember us having any anomalies whatsoever throughout the launch and throughout the orbit insertion phase of the flight at all.\n\nThe boys opened the doors. Bruce and Ron, maybe Bob and Ron were the ones to open the payload bay doors. Got those open. Everything just went fine. Then we launched WESTAR-VI that afternoon. I’m trying to remember that one. Bob Stewart and Ron McNair switched places for the two satellites. One of them was the prime operator sitting in the commander’s seat going through the sequence of item entries that we had to do. I was always in the right seat for those watching attitude. I don’t remember everything else that I was supposed to watch but verify that we’re in the right attitude for deploy and counting down to deploy. Everything looked just perfectly fine, and we launched WESTAR-VI on the first day, later in the day.\n\nI remember one of the things that really wasn’t good that first day was lunch. That was back in the days where NASA had put together a standard meal package for every mission. The first day lunch, what was on the standard menu was ham slices. If you’re even thinking about getting sick, which we found out over the years got to be a big problem, but if you’re even thinking about getting sick and you open up that package of ham, and all that juice that was around it, and it was a chunk of ham, and we ate it, I ate it. I was one of the lucky 60% that do not get sick, so I didn’t get sick. Boy, I tell you, if you were even thinking about it, lunch on the first day was not what you wanted to have if you had any thoughts at all about getting sick.\n\nThe deploy, everything went fine. The PKM [Perigee Kick Motor] burn—back in those days what we did is we maneuvered to point the belly of the Orbiter at the burn to protect the windows because even though it was far enough away from us, the rocket plume apparently would send some particles towards you. So we weren’t watching it, we were just pointing in this other direction. Then it was later on in the day that Mission Control called us and said, “Hey. When you guys launched the satellite did WESTAR look like it was okay to you guys?” We said, “Yes.” They said, “Was it spinning nice and steady the way it should be?” We said, “Yes.” They said something like “You didn’t see any pieces coming off of it, did you?” I think either Vance or maybe it was me that keyed the mike and said, “Does this mean you can’t find it?”\n\nThey said, “Yes, we don’t know where it is. We can’t find it. It’s not where it’s supposed to be.” They searched and they searched and they searched, and they finally found it in the wrong orbit. It was down in a 400-mile-high orbit when it should have been in a 22,000-mile-high orbit. It was just a little bit off.\n\nThey figured out that something had to have happened to the motor. We held off. We were going to deploy the PALAPA-B2 I think it was the second day. We held off, and they said, “Okay.” They either told us at the end of the first day or early on the second day, “Hey, we’re not going to do PALAPA deploy today. So just find some stuff to do up there.”\n\nWe made videos. Ron had brought along his saxophone, he had a tenor sax, a small saxophone, so he played that. We videotaped him and videotaped the Earth going by and put together this videotape of him playing music and watching the Earth go by. I guess we filmed Bob Stewart on the treadmill. Just making the time go by that day. Find something to do to fill up the whole day, so we did that.\n\nThen I don’t remember which day, maybe it was day three. They finally looked it over, and they came to the conclusion that WESTAR VI had been a random failure, so we’re going to go ahead and launch PALAPA. Only this time they said we’re going to point the RMS camera at the PKM burn, so they gave us a bunch of angles to put the RMS at so that we could point it pretty much right where the burn was going to be and watch the burn. From that point on they did that every time they did a deploy. They would point the RMS and watch the burn on the RMS camera.\n\nWe saw it light, we saw it stabilize, and then we saw this big plume, and nothing. So it had a random failure too. In subsequent digging into it, I guess they went back and asked the contractor, “Well, what did you guys change?” What they figured out was that the motor had blown the nozzle out. It had severed the nozzle and when you do that you choke the flow, and so that was the end, no more thrust.\n\nSo both satellites of ours wound up in 400-mile-high orbits. I remember after we landed and came back to Houston there was a cartoon in the Houston Chronicle that showed two men walking down the street. Just above their heads there’s a satellite going by. They were saying, “Well, it’s a complete success. It just wasn’t quite as high as we wanted it to be.” They were making fun of us. Both satellites wound up stranded in a useless orbit, and I guess it was later on in ’84 Rick Hauck on [STS-51A] went up there and they retrieved those two satellites. Brought them back to Earth, they refurbished them, and they eventually made it to orbit on expendable rockets. So they eventually got there but took a while.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: What was the crew morale like given the fact that these two didn’t deploy successfully?\n\nGibson: We were pretty disappointed. We were quite disappointed. We had not done the lead balloon yet. That followed after the satellites. We deployed our lead balloon, and it exploded. So we didn’t get to do the rendezvous testing because Mission Control was nervous about the 200 pounds of lead. Since the balloon had exploded, where’s all that lead? Is it with the shreds of the balloon or is it on its own? So they had us just do a separation burn away from it, and we never did anything with the rendezvous test. We had messed up both of our satellites, we had exploded our lead balloon, nothing is going well on this. The toilet hadn’t failed yet. That happened I think the next day. One of the guys went to use the potty and flipped the switch on and it tripped the circuit breaker.\n\nWe don’t just reset circuit breakers because you don’t want to reset a circuit breaker and have it cause a fire in the wiring. So since I was one of the ones that trained in in-flight maintenance I got to be the one to fix it, which I did. I fixed it. It had jammed. I had to remove power from it, open it up, and reach in there and unjam it, because it had the slinger in there. Those were the days when we still had the slinger. The slinger had become jammed. I unjammed it, so I fixed it. It just seems like everything was going wrong. We were snakebit. Then we came to the EVAs, and from there on we positively sailed, with one more hiccup that happened, but the first tests of the MMU were so spectacular. Of course that’s probably the one big thing that that flight is going to be remembered for was the MMU, the Manned Maneuvering Unit, and the world’s first untethered spacewalks. That part of it just soared.\n\nBruce was first. While he was doing that Bob was doing some things. We had some experiments that he was working in the cargo bay. Then, of course, it got to be his turn to go and Bob got to go as well. We did all that, I want to say that was flight day five by the time all that came to pass. That just went spectacularly.\n\nThen we had another EVA day. We had another hiccup. This was going to be my turn to really operate the RMS because Vance wound up dividing it pretty much evenly between Ron and me. So this was going to be my turn, and I was going to be the one who was going to get to bring the arm over, grab ahold of the SPAS satellite, lift it out of the cargo bay, spin it around, and then put it back in when we were done with it.\n\nThe RMS failed on my way to the grapple position. It turned out that the wrist pitch was frozen. That was one of the joints in the RMS. They called it the Canada arm. We called it the robot arm. It really was an arm. It had a shoulder joint, it had an elbow joint, it had a wrist joint. The pitch joint on the wrist had frozen for some reason. It didn’t work. We troubleshot it and troubleshot it. I had maneuvered it over and got it into position, but as I’m bringing it over there, it’s just not behaving the way I’m expecting. I’m sitting there saying to myself, “I have got to be the crummiest arm operator there’s ever been, because I’m having to tweak it all over the place to get it to where it’s supposed to be.” I hadn’t had that trouble in Building 9 or in the simulator. I’m going, “What is the matter with me?”\n\nI got it there and then we looked at the message on the computer and it’s telling us WPA, Wrist Pitch Amplifier. We troubleshot it. We put it out, turned it off, turned it back on, did everything we could think of to try to get it working again, and Mission Control finally said, “Okay, it’s broken. Cradle it and shut it off.” That was the end of it. So I didn’t get to have my big moment of glory working the RMS and doing all that fun stuff. I was a bit disappointed, but in conjunction with that we had another spacewalk. Bruce and Bob both went outside and did a second spacewalk, and everything they did on that one just worked perfectly.\n\nThey tested out the TPAD, the Trunnion Pin Attachment Device, did a bunch of practice dockings with flying the MMU and doing the dockings to prepare the way for Pinky [George D.] Nelson to do that on STS-13. So really everything went fine. There were some glitches. Then it came down to day eight, the final day of the mission, and we got to make the first landing at Cape Canaveral.\n\nThat went well. My funny story about that was the two pilots on the Shuttle as you know are called the commander and the pilot. I tell this story all the time. I said, “I’m sure the reason they don’t call the pilot the copilot is that we astronauts are such prima donnas nobody’s willing to be called copilot. So it’s the commander and the pilot.” It just confuses everybody because the commander is really the pilot, the pilot is really the copilot.\n\nVance Brand, the commander, made the first landing at Cape Canaveral, and I was the pilot. So later in that day somebody was saying to me, “Hoot, you were the pilot this morning for that landing, right?” I said, “Yes.” They said, “God, that was a beautiful landing you made.” I said, “Thank you.” It was beautiful. It was beautiful.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Did you get to fly the stick at all? Did he let you have a little time?\n\nGibson: No, that was at the time period where we were not letting the pilot get any time on the stick at all, which I think was always a big mistake. The very first time I got ahold of the stick was 61C, when I had to make the landing at night. That’s the first time I’d ever had my hand on the control stick to fly the Orbiter in atmospheric flight. I had had some stuff up in orbit where I operated the stick if I remember right, so I had done some of that. The first time I got my hands on the stick I had to make the landing. I don’t think that’s a good way to train. I think it’s just a big confidence builder to let your copilot get his or her hand on the stick and just feel it out, even for just 20 seconds I think makes all the difference in the world. But we were going through a phase where no, we’re not going to do that.\n\nFor STS-27 and 47 I was able to let my pilots fly the thing for a bit and get the feel of it, because they’re both going to be commanders at some point and this is going to be a good thing to do. For 41B and 61C we were in the mode of no, you don’t get to do that. That’s the way that went. Vance just did a beautiful job landing it. We almost got fogged out of it. When you looked at the pictures of us landing, there was all kinds of fog coming off our wingtips. There was all kinds of mist down in the swamps all around the landing site. We just about fogged over, but we lucked out.\n\nWe did have a close call during reentry that none of us knew about until after the mission. One of the things that we had attempted to do during the mission was to do a simultaneous wastewater and supply water dump. I don’t know why the Shuttle Program had decided that would be important for us to do. As it turned out, doing them both at the same time—the dump nozzles are in very close proximity to each other, and obviously the heater or heaters weren’t enough to handle that. Unbeknownst to us, we had formed an ice ball on the left side of the Orbiter. I suppose it just didn’t occur to anybody on the ground that we had an ice ball out there. It didn’t occur to us, although maybe this happened after we had broken the RMS so we couldn’t have looked at it anyway.\n\nWe knew that we couldn’t dump water. So the way that we got rid of supply water was we ran the flash evaporator. We were running the flash evaporator up on orbit so that we wouldn’t overfill our supply water tanks, but we had built ourselves a nice chunk of ice on the left side of the Orbiter.\n\nDuring reentry that’s going to melt off of there, and it left the left side of the Orbiter and came back and hit our left OMS pod and just about broke its way into it. I don’t know what would have happened to us, but you look at the video of us coming in to land from the chase plane, and you can see this big black mark on the left OMS pod. It nearly broke the surface and ruptured into the OMS pod. Then we would have got the heat of reentry in there at all those fuel tanks that are in there.\n\nIt could have been the end. We didn’t realize it. Mission Control didn’t realize it. Nobody realized it. Then of course later on on [STS]-41D, they built themselves an ice ball on the left side but they used the arm to go over there and knock it off and push it off of there. So we had a little bit of a close call during reentry that none of us realized, and nobody appreciated it until afterwards, and we got to look at it and see where we had almost broken through the left OMS pod.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Yikes! I wanted to ask you a couple of other things about the mission, especially because we’re not going to be able to talk with Ron McNair. I understand that he brought some levity to the flight, besides the saxophone, because he dressed up like Cecil B. McNair when he was doing his video.\n\nGibson: Yes, he was the lead on the Cinema 360 camera. We had a camera that never really quite caught on because the IMAX camera just overshadowed it. Cinema 360 was a camera that gave you a big fish-eye view, and you needed to project it onto a planetarium. It shot some pretty spectacular stuff. But as I say, it just never caught on. Jackson, Mississippi, is where the Cinema 360 Company was. After the mission we actually went back there. There were a whole lot of sequences we shot. The one I remember real vividly was Bruce in the MMU took off from near the back of the cargo bay and flew across the middle of the scene and then out the scene I think to the right side of the picture. That made a really spectacular image.\n\nWe also had some really dramatic images crossing the Skeleton Coast of Africa. In fact that might have been the same view with Bruce flying across the Skeleton Coast, Namibia, in the background on that picture. So Ron was the lead guy on that. I’m trying to think if he had a backup. He must have had a backup because Vance had—maybe it was Bruce because I don’t think it was me. So he was the lead guy on that. He had a little beret and sunglasses so that he could be Cecil B. McNair. When we went to Jackson after the mission they all gave us a director’s chair with the Cinema 360 patch. Then we all had a title. I still have that chair. It’s a folding chair, cloth seat and cloth back and wood frame. It folds up. It’s a director’s chair. Yes, Ron had his Cecil B. Oh, and he had a clapboard too. We got pictures, movies of him with his little clapboard too as well. Yes, there was a little bit of levity associated with it too.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Did he have a good sense of humor?\n\nGibson: Oh, excellent. Yes, you wanted to be real nice to him because he was a black belt in karate as well. He could kill you with his bare hands. You always wanted to be very nice to him, which was easy, he was very nice as well.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Nowadays I’m thinking how the crews on orbit for ISS—they can do Skype, they can e-mail with people, stay in touch with family. How’d you stay in touch with Rhea and Paul and Julie? Did you have a chance when you were on orbit?\n\nGibson: We didn’t. No, we didn’t. On 41B, Jennifer, my recollection is there was no contact at all. At some point down the line we had the laptops on board, and we could send a message down to the ground and we could get messages back. I remember on Rhea’s flights Trudy Davis was our coordinator for that stuff, and she’d get ahold of us and say, “Hey, do you have something you’d like to send up to Rhea? Do you or the kids have something you’d like to?” So you’d write up something. Then she’d get it input. It would all go up in a packet, and same deal, we could send a packet of messages down as well.\n\nOn 41B we didn’t have that in place. It might have been that they could put one or two things on the teleprinter like, “We watched the launch, and you look great.” Maybe something would come up on the teleprinter. Later on we did have that thing where you could get on the laptop and type up a message to your family and they could send stuff back up to you.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: That’s interesting.\n\nGibson: Yes. As you know I’m sure, that’s one of the things that they found on these long duration flights that boy, people need to be able to be in contact with their families.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: What are your memories of getting to Florida and seeing Rhea and Julie? From the book I understand Paul was at home in Houston when you landed.\n\nGibson: When we landed, yes. I really impressed my crew because we landed and got out. We walked around the Orbiter a little bit. It’s funny to watch our crew movie of us coming out, and watch us staggering around. I will just never forget a couple things. When it was time for me to get out of my seat—and that doesn’t happen right away. You land. We roll to a stop, we got to safe all the computers, we got to safe all the rocket thrusters. We’ve got to take the computers and put them into the ground mode. So it’s about 45 minutes to an hour after landing before we can get out. So you’ve had that much time to readapt to gravity again, only you’ve just been weightless for eight days. This is your first time coming back to gravity.\n\nI remember when it was time to get out of my seat I went to get my left foot up and I couldn’t move my left foot, it was stuck on something. My boot was caught on something. I’m going, “Why can’t I raise my boot?” I get to looking at it, and I look down there and I go, “Wait a minute. There’s nothing holding my boot.” So I grabbed my knee with my hands and I lifted it up, and it came up. I said, “Oh my gosh, that’s how heavy my leg is?” You forget how heavy you are in gravity.\n\nThen I watch myself and the rest of the guys walking right after we came down the steps and start walking around. We are wobbling all over the place. When I did stand up inside the Orbiter, I don’t remember why, but I leaned my head to the side and I fell over. I caught myself, and I got back straight up again. I said, “Whoa, what’s with that? Well, let’s try it the other way.” So I leaned to the left, and I fell over to the left. I had to focus on keeping my head perfectly straight up and down for several hours after we got back on the ground.\n\nRon McNair had a similar issue, only his was fore and aft. If he leaned his head forward he fell over forward. Mine was left and right to the sides. Readapting to gravity that first time was really harsh.\n\nOne of the things that I had [to do], every single time when I came back, was after I had been on the ground for—it was later on in the day. So let’s say I’d been back in gravity for 8 or 12 hours, I would get shin splints so bad, I had to lie down for a while. I had to get off my feet and just lie down. It really is an adaptation. Everything else about it on the subsequent missions was a whole lot easier, but the shin splints were with me every single time.\n\nWhen we got back to the crew quarters, of course that’s where your family was waiting for you. Julie as I mentioned was eight years old then. She came running up to me and jumped up into my arms, and I caught her. I remember Bob Stewart said, “I was so impressed you didn’t just fall down.” I remember it was a challenge, but she was so excited to see me. She just jumped up into my arms. I was so excited to see her as well.\n\nOf course that was back before we had the no-rinse body wash and the no-rinse shampoo. So you hadn’t had a shower for eight days. You hadn’t washed your hair for eight days. So your hair was a total greaseball. You hated your hair. I did run on the treadmill several times during that mission, so after that you would go take a sponge bath, but we really didn’t have any kind of acceptable soap that you could use. You’d take a drink container and put a bunch of hot water in it and then you’d squeeze that onto a washcloth and you could wash yourself off, but no soap.\n\nLater on we had that no-rinse body shampoo and the no-rinse hair shampoo that were two separate things. That was a whole lot better, but you just couldn’t wait to get into a shower. You were just so looking forward to a cheeseburger and a shower.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Hopefully you got those soon after you got to crew quarters.\n\nGibson: Oh yes. Immediately what they wanted to do was they wanted to get your blood pressure and your heart rate and take a blood sample and all these other horrible animal torture directed against humans that they would do to you. They’d finally say, “Okay, great, now you can go get a shower and change clothes.” That just felt so good.\n\nAlthough I think they would tell us, “Don’t close your eyes in the shower because you might fall down. There’s a good chance you’re going to fall down.” I think I did close—either that or I put my hand on the wall when I was washing my hair and rinsing it. Yes, there was a real adaptation back to gravity.\n\nOh, and then this was spectacular, because we were the first landing at Cape Canaveral they had a huge reception. Golly, where was it? There was a stage and there were 500 chairs and 500 people out there for it. I remember being so thrilled because Mom and Dad were there for that. My dad, as we talked about last time, was my flight instructor, and he taught me how to fly. In our little speech, each of us got to get up there on the microphone and say a few words. I got to say, “And I am so thrilled that Mom and Dad are here today and my brother Jon and my daughter Julie. You guys all stand up.” Julie, after the fact, said, “I was so embarrassed.” That scene of us walking up onto the stage is in the IMAX movie The Dream Is Alive.\n\nThe Dream Is Alive starts off with our landing on 41B. Walter Cronkite is the narrator. It starts off, and you see the alligators swimming, and then you hear the sonic boom, and then Walter Cronkite says, “A Space Shuttle is coming back to land.” That whole IMAX sequence is our landing.\n\nYou hear my voice calling off, “A hundred feet, 50 feet, 70 feet,” to Vance. Then all of us walking up on the stage. I can pick my mom and dad out in the audience because I know where to look for them. My dad had on a gray and white striped sweater so I can pick them out in the audience on that scene. I always get a thrill out of watching that. There was a big reception, and I got to introduce Mom and Dad to the whole audience and make them stand up. That was a thrill.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: It’s nice they get that recognition.\n\nGibson: Yes.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I had one other question but it’s just a little bit after noon. I don’t know if you have lunch plans with anybody. So I don’t want to hold you.\n\nGibson: Didn’t really.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Okay, I wasn’t sure, I always hate to keep people here and somebody says, “Oh, I really needed to go about a half an hour ago.”\n\nGibson: Oh no, heavens, no. No, in fact we can keep going if you want to keep going.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: We can keep going for a little bit. Wanted to ask you about any interesting PRs. You mentioned going to Jackson, Mississippi. Any other place? Hometowns, things like that?\n\nGibson: Oh golly. There was a really fascinating PR—I don’t know if Rhea talked about it—that happened before the mission. Oh, Vance Brand was so mad at me. This was early in our training cycle. We were launching in February. I think we probably got assigned maybe the end of February of ’83, and we were tracking down to February of ’84. Rhea had a PR that she was doing in Australia. That was going to be in April of ’83. She was over there. Now we’ve started training on 41B.\n\nRhea got a call I think maybe before she went over there. It was the White House. Did she tell you about this at all?\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I think I remember seeing it in her blog, of all places.\n\nGibson: Oh, okay. She got a phone call from the White House. They said, “Hey. You’re going to be over in Australia during the Battle of the Coral Sea week. We need somebody to represent President [Ronald] Reagan at that. Would you be willing to stay an extra week over there and represent the President?” She said, “Yes, sure, if my husband can come along too.” They said, “Yes, sure, what does he do?” She told them, “Well, he’s a naval officer and he’s an astronaut training for his first [mission].” They went right through the ceiling, because the Battle of the Coral Sea celebration happens every year and the Battle of the Coral Sea was a huge victory for—well, it was almost a standoff between us and the Japanese. The Battle of the Coral Sea is what kept Australia from being invaded by the Japanese in World War II. They have never gotten over it, and they have never forgotten us for it. It was a huge naval battle.\n\nWhen they heard that I was a naval officer they said, “Okay, well, then he’s going to represent President Reagan.” Next thing I know the Deputy Center Director at JSC, [Clifford E. Charlesworth] calls me and tells me that I’ve got to go to Australia because the White House says. Vance had a fit. The Deputy Center Director called me, and I got to be the one to tell Vance. He felt like I was overworked and overloaded on my training, which I really wasn’t, but here all of a sudden I was going to have to be gone for 10 days. He had a fit.\n\nI called the Deputy Center Director back, and I said, “I can’t go. Vance can’t let me go.” He said, “I’m going to cut my wrists,” is what he said. We chatted on the phone a little bit and he said, “Hoot, you have to go. We don’t have a choice in this anymore. You have to go.”\n\nSo I flew over to Australia, and I joined Rhea. The whole thing was a funny thing. I go over there, and I’m going to diddy bop in here. “Okay, I’m here to represent President Reagan.” I land in Sydney, and I hop off the airplane. I’m hungry, so I head into the little restaurant. I’m sitting in there having breakfast, and there’s all these guys in suits that are scurrying by the restaurant going this way and then going that way and then going that way. They’re running all over the place. I’m thinking, “What is the matter with these guys?” Then they finally come into the restaurant. They look at me, and they go, “Are you Commander Gibson?” I said, “Yes.” They said, “Oh good. We get to keep our jobs now.” They were supposed to meet up with me in the Sydney airport. They were supposed to meet up with me and hand me some documents and some paperwork and tell me welcome to Australia. They were from the American embassy. They’re supposed to find me. I’m going to fly to Brisbane to meet up with Rhea and just spend a couple days with her. Then we’re coming back to Sydney, and that’s where we start representing the President.\n\nThat was the start of it. Got to go spend a couple days up in Brisbane, and then flew back down. When we got back down to Sydney, you would think we were royalty, because we showed up and we’re met by my escort from the prime minister’s office, who was with me every bit of the way from there on. We get there and they say, “Okay, where’s your baggage claim tickets.” We said, “Oh, well, we’ve got them. We can go.” They said, “No, you don’t pick up your own luggage.” We hand them our baggage claim tickets. They picked up our luggage. They got it all loaded into the white limousine.\n\nWe walk out to the white limousine and Rhea and I climb into the backseat and our driver was Rex. My escort from the prime minister was Peter. We hop into this limousine, and the driver Rex walks up to the front and he unfurls an American flag; the Seal of the President of the United States is the other flag that he unfurls. We go driving through there to go to whatever hotel it was we were staying at. Everywhere I was the President of the United States, because I was representing him.\n\nRhea left after a couple days. I still had about another five days or so of being there. They had me lay a wreath on the tomb of the Unknown Soldier on Remembrance Day over there at the Cenotaph in Sydney. Prior to that they had me inspect the troops. They had me inspect the troop. Who were the troops? It was the admiral of the Navy, it was the general of the Air Force. They’re all standing at attention calling me sir as I’m this poor measly commander in the Navy. They’re all calling me sir—the General of the Army. It was the Joint Chiefs of the Australian military. I inspected them, and then I laid the wreath on the tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\n\nThe Coral Sea Ball in Sydney—of course we’re sitting at the head table. The head table was in this little room, and they’re going to introduce all the people that are at the head table. I’m going to speak, but it’s a dinner. There’s probably 1,000 people in there. They’re introducing everybody one by one, and the room is getting more and more empty. Finally just Rhea and I are left and then they introduced Rhea. She goes in to sit at the table. Then they announce, “And representing the President of the United States is this bozo, Commander Robert Gibson.” I start diddy bopping in there to head for the head table, and they start playing “Hail to the Chief.” I’m going, “Oh no.” As I’m walking in, I walk by Admiral [Sylvester R.] Foley, four-star admiral, who is the Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet. He’s standing at attention as I walk in.\n\nI am saying to myself, “What am I doing here?” That whole thing was just a real experience. Oh golly, what a PR that was.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Yes, wow. That’s got to stick out in your memory as probably one of your most memorable.\n\nGibson: Oh golly, yes. One of those things where I’m saying, “Oh shoot, I don’t belong here. I am just a measly commander. What am I doing here?” They took it very seriously, extremely.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: What a great trip and good excuse to visit Australia.\n\nGibson: Oh, it sure was. Yes, it sure was. Of course then I got back and Vance got over it. He didn’t hold it against me. He actually became convinced that I had done my darnedest to try to get out of it, so all’s well.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Probably your hometown PR paled in comparison to that.\n\nGibson: Yes, that’s true. After the mission there were some hometown things. My folks were living in Lakewood, California, when I went into the Navy. Went back to Lakewood, and of course they had a big thing there, the mayor and the city council. That was a lot of fun.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I imagine.\n\nGibson: Yes.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Would you like to stop and have some lunch? Or do you want to keep going for a little bit? What’s your preference?\n\nGibson: Do you need to go break for lunch right now? We could go till maybe 12:30.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: That’s fine.\n\nGibson: Then break. Because we’re going to go what, 2:00 to 4:00 again?\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Two to 4:00, yes. I’m hoping they turn up the heat. I don’t know. Are you cold?\n\nGibson: It’s a little bit cool, yes.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: It’s a little nippy in here. I’m hoping I can adjust the heat.\n\nGibson: You know what we had when I worked in SAIL? Oh, let’s see. What was his name? The astronauts, we had a couple desks in one of the offices with Dave. One of the guys that worked in SAIL. You couldn’t adjust your thermostats.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: No?\n\nGibson: No, you couldn’t adjust them, you couldn’t change them. He invented something that we called the Dave whatever his last name was, the Dave something or other thermostat fooler. It was basically a washcloth that you dipped in water. You’d wrap it around the thermostat, and the evaporation would cause the temperature to be a little bit lower at that thermostat where the thermostat was sensing it, so it would turn up the heat in the rest of the room.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Oh, that’s a good idea.\n\nGibson: So you could have a Hoot Gibson thermostat fooler.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: I like that. Because in some offices they do that, they actually lock the thermostat, so you don’t adjust them. This one I think, Rebecca’s, you can adjust. I know in my office I’ve adjusted it. We’re not technically supposed to. Sometimes it gets a little chilly.\n\nGibson: The ones over in SAIL, they weren’t adjustable; you couldn’t change them. We had the Dave thermostat fooler.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Around here they keep the air conditioner, I don’t know, 65 at all times of the year.\n\nGibson: Well, it gets hot here in the summer.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: It does in the summer, but in the winter I don’t know why we need to run an air conditioner.\n\nGibson: Yes, let’s be warmer in the winter.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: Absolutely. I wanted to ask you—I had asked Rhea when we sat down for some interviews. I asked her about her spouse duties, because of course as a spouse to an astronaut you had responsibilities like the parties and things of that nature.\n\nGibson: Oh golly, yes.\n\nRoss-Nazzal: So one of the things that I wanted to ask about though was you had a toddler at home. You had a very busy hectic job. You were out at AOD, and Rhea was preparing for her first flight. How did you manage all of that with a toddler in tow and two very active careers?\n\nGibson: It was always a challenge until 1989 when we got Joann [Powell]. Rhea, I’m sure, must have mentioned Joann. Joann was with us for 25 years. Prior to that time what we had was—let’s see. By the time Rhea was in training for her flight, which was ’85, she would have started training in ’84 for that or maybe late ’83 even. We had Paul in preschool so really what we had to do was get him there in the morning and then pick him up in the afternoon.\n\nWe would have a crisis every so often where I had to be out of town, and she had to be out of town. Generally the way we worked getting Paul there was I would take him in the morning, and she would pick him up in the afternoon. That was our standard routine for doing it.\n\nWhen we both had to be out of town at the same time it was always a crisis, because now we had to figure out what are we going to do with him overnight. Fortunately, several of the secretaries that were single would come stay with him overnight for us. It was generally no more than just one night that we’d overlap and we were both going to be out of town that night.\n\nIt was always a struggle. It was always a crisis because frequently these trips would pop up with three days’ advance notice. What are we going to do? We got to figure it out. We made it work, because it was one of those cases where okay, I’m not going to say to her, “You need to quit your career and be a stay-home mom.” Certainly she would never say to me, “Well, you need to quit the career and be a stay-home dad.” We had to work it out. It was always a crisis until Dann was born, which was 1989. Prior to that we had even had a couple of babysitters that came I guess before Paul got big enough to where he could go to daycare. We had a couple of babysitters. One was Shirley and the other one was Martha that when Paul was real little they’d show up at 7:45 in the morning and stay with him all day and then Rhea would show up back home at 4:30 or 5:00. So we had a couple of babysitters that would show up and sit Monday through Friday.\n\nThen for a while there when Rhea—oh, that’s right. We had Claire Dehaye came from France to be an au pair while Rhea was training. She came to us, I think, when Rhea got within about three or four months of launch. She came and lived with us, so she was full-time care for Paul. We took her down to the Cape with us. She got to come down and watch the launch of [STS]-51D, which was in April. Then Claire was with us another couple of months till July, because she wanted to go back home to France to be there for Bastille Day, July 14th. So she was with us like from January of ’85 thr"
