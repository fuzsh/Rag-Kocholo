        "text": "The original voice of Frank West in Dead Rising has said he wasn’t asked to reprise the role in the game’s upcoming remaster.\n\nCapcom announced last week that it was working on Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, a current-gen makeover of its Xbox 360 game from 2006.\n\nHowever, fans noted that Frank appeared to have a different voice in the trailer’s remaster, something his original voice artist has confirmed.\n\nAs reported by X user FrankByDaylight, voice actor Terence J Rotolo was asked by another user on Instagram why he wasn’t cast for the role in the remaster.\n\nRotolo replied by confirming that Capcom didn’t ask him to reprise the role, but said he didn’t know why it was the case.\n\n“The answer to your question is I have no answer,” Rotolo said. “All I can say is that I’ve been grateful for every opportunity to help bring Frank to life.\n\n“An actor’s job when called upon is to show up prepared, deliver your best, and when done move onto the next mission. I simply wasn’t called for this mission. The reasons are the producers’ own.”\n\nAlthough it isn’t clear why Rotolo hasn’t been recast, one X user pointed out that the situation resembles that of Alyson Court, who played Claire Redfield in Resident Evil 2 and reprised the role in a further five games, but then wasn’t cast in the Resident Evil 2 remake.\n\nIn a YouTube video at the time, Court claimed that she was asked if she wanted to reprise the role and said she “would absolutely love to”, but was then allegedly told that Capcom had decided to go with a non-union actor instead.\n\nDead Rising Deluxe Remaster will be released on September 19. The remaster will use the RE Engine and will include quality-of-life improvements such as auto-saving, revamped controls and improved UI."
