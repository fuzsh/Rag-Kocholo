        "text": "“Game of Thrones” actor Darren Kent, 36, died Friday after long battles with osteoporosis, arthritis and an extremely rare skin disorder.\n\nThe London-based performer with a signature Cockney accent was surrounded by friends and family at the time of his passing, according to his reps at Carey Dodd Associates.\n\n“It is with deep sadness we have to tell you that our dear friend and client Darren Kent passed away peacefully on Friday,” the agency posted on Facebook. “His parents and best friend by his side. Our thoughts and love are with his family in this difficult time.”\n\nKent, who guest starred on popular UK TV series such as “EastEnders” and “Shameless,” rose to international prominence after appearing in a 2014 episode of “Game of Thrones as a goat herder from Slavers Bay.\n\n“Darren was not only a talented actor, director and writer, he was truly one of the kindest people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting,” continued the post. “It has been a privilege and pleasure to have been a part of his journey. RIP my friend.”\n\nKent’s official cause of death has yet to be determined.\n\nThe Essex, UK-born actor got his start in 2008 when he appeared in the film “Mirrors” and alongside Kristen Stewart, Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron in the 2012 action film “Snow White and the Huntsman.”\n\nIn addition to his time on “Thrones,” the actor worked with “24” star Kiefer Sutherland and “The Crown’s” Dominic West.\n\nAccording to the actor’s IMBD page, Kent appeared in the star-studded “Dungeons and Dragons” film as a corpse.\n\nSince news of the actor’s death was announced, several colleagues and friends have come forward with their condolences.\n\n“Darren was an amazing human being and so special,” wrote Lee Mead, who starred in one of Kent’s films. “Always giving of his time to people and always so positive. A fine actor too and he achieved so much as well. Such heartbreaking news.”\n\nThe Mushroom Theatre Company, where Kent got his big acting break, also posted a tribute.\n\n“So very very sad to hear about the passing of our patron @darrenpaulkent,” wrote the theatre company. “Our thoughts are with his family & friends at this difficult time.”\n\n“What a privilege it was to be your friend and to work together on so many projects over the years,” said director Jane Gull. “Life won’t be the same without you. I will miss you so much. RIP darling Darren Kent.”\n\nKent’s friend and screenwriter, Ben Trebilcook, posted his own tribute to his pal.\n\n“Love and thoughts to the friends and family of our talented, caring soul of a friend, Darren Kent, who sadly passed away on Friday,” wrote Trebilcook.\n\n“Darren, an Essex writer, actor and director, directed our award-winning short ‘You Know Me.’ A true character who was Always creating and forever upbeat and encouraging, Darren will be sorely missed.”"
