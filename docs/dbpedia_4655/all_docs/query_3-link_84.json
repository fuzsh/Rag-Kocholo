        "text": "The county singer Lloyd “Hoot” Gibson has now joined the heavenly choir.\n\nHe would have been 95 in November.\n\nMost people remember Gibson as a performer at Nicholson’s Farmhouse near Havana or the talkative vendor who sold fresh produce at the corner of Glenview Drive. He was a fixture in this area and had recently moved into a senior living facility.\n\nThe World War II U.S. Navy veteran, musician and produce man told the Tallahassee Democrat in July he was grateful he still had all his faculties, his deep set of vocal cords and a good ear for melody. At his new digs at Tapestry Senior Living, he plucked on his guitar as long as he was able.\n\nThe singer, who was not kin to the cowboy actor who carried the same name, was scheduled to make an appearance in September at a local club but was too ill to make the gig.\n\nGibson died early Thursday morning, according to family members. No funeral arrangements have yet been announced.\n\nHoot Gibson: Tallahassee icon out of the fruit business but still strumming at 94"
