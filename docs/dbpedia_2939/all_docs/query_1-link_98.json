        "text": "Vitaphone short has J. Francis Dooley trying to explain the name to Corinne Sales.\n\nApparently Dooley and Sales were a popular act on the vaudeville circuit but whatever their act had it certainly didn't flow over to this short. At just eight-minutes there's certainly nothing awful about the film but at the same time I just didn't find the act to be funny. The two of them crack up a bit during their act so they were obviously having fun doing it."
