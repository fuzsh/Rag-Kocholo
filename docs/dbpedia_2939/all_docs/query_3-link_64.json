        "text": "Levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG IUD)—The LNG IUD is a small T-shaped device like the Copper T IUD. It is placed inside the uterus by a doctor. It releases a small amount of progestin each day to keep you from getting pregnant. The LNG IUD stays in your uterus for up to 3 to 8 years, depending on the device. Typical use failure rate: 0.1-0.4%.1\n\nCopper T intrauterine device (IUD)—This IUD is a small device that is shaped in the form of a “T.” Your doctor places it inside the uterus to prevent pregnancy. It can stay in your uterus for up to 10 years. Typical use failure rate: 0.8%.1\n\nCombined oral contraceptives—Also called “the pill,” combined oral contraceptives contain the hormones estrogen and progestin. It is prescribed by a doctor. A pill is taken at the same time each day. If you are older than 35 years and smoke, have a history of blood clots or breast cancer, your doctor may advise you not to take the pill. Typical use failure rate: 7%.1\n\nProgestin-only pill—Unlike the combined pill, the progestin-only pill (sometimes called the mini-pill) only has one hormone, progestin, instead of both estrogen and progestin. It is prescribed by a doctor. It is taken at the same time each day. It may be a good option for women who can’t take estrogen. Typical use failure rate: 7%.1\n\nDiaphragm or cervical cap—Before sexual intercourse, the diaphragm or cap is inserted in the vagina with spermicide to block or kill sperm. These methods are prescribed by a health care provider. Typical use failure rate for the diaphragm: 17%.1 Typical use failure rate for the cervical cap: 22%.1\n\nSponge—The contraceptive sponge contains spermicide and is placed in the vagina where it fits over the cervix. The sponge works for up to 24 hours and must be left in the vagina for at least 6 hours after the last act of intercourse, at which time it is removed and discarded. Typical use failure rate: 17%.1\n\nCopper IUD—The copper IUD can be inserted within 5 days of unprotected sex.\n\nEmergency contraceptive pills—Emergency contraceptive pills can be taken up to 5 days after unprotected sex, but the sooner the pills are taken, the better they will work. There are three different types of pills that can be used for emergency contraception. Some emergency contraceptive pills are available over the counter, and some are available only by prescription within the United States.\n\nTubal surgery or “tying tubes”—The fallopian tubes are tied (or closed) or cut so that sperm and eggs cannot meet for fertilization. The procedure can be done in a hospital or in an outpatient surgical center. The patient can go home the same day of the surgery and resume normal activities within a few days. This method is effective immediately. Typical use failure rate: 0.5%.1\n\nVasectomy—This procedure is done to keep sperm from going to the penis, so the ejaculate never has any sperm in it that can fertilize an egg. The procedure is typically done at an outpatient surgical center. The patient can go home the same day. Recovery time is less than 1 week. After the operation, it is important to visit a health care provider to make sure the sperm count has dropped to zero; this takes about 12 weeks. Another form of birth control should be used until the sperm count has dropped to zero. Typical use failure rate: 0.15%.1"
