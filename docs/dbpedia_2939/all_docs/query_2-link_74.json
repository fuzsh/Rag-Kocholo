        "text": "In the film, the fam­i­ly is not named. My grand­moth­er was long gone by the time I start­ed writ­ing my nov­el Kan­ti­ka, which uses her migra­tion sto­ry as a spring­board. I emailed the link to the film to my uncle David, who was nine­ty-two and sharp as a tack, and called to ask him to check his email. Ten min­utes lat­er, he called me back: ​“Holy cow! Where the hell did you find that? That’s me, walk­ing across the screen! That’s — ” his voice broke for a moment; he’d left Spain for New York at age eight, nev­er to see his grand­par­ents again “ — me at Provença, the cra­zi­est thing.”\n\nI’d been work­ing on my nov­el for sev­er­al years by then. Or decades, real­ly, if you go back to 1985, when I was twen­ty-one and record­ed my grand­moth­er rem­i­nisc­ing about her life. Lat­er on, when I recount­ed the sto­ry to oth­ers, peo­ple were skep­ti­cal: Are you sure — they went to Spain? Cen­turies pri­or, dur­ing the Inqui­si­tion, Spain had slaugh­tered, expelled, and forced Jews to con­vert. However,there was a short-lived law in the 1920s that promised Span­ish cit­i­zen­ship to Sephardic Jews. My fam­i­ly had long flour­ished in Turkey, but after the col­lapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1922, they lost their for­tune and had few options.\n\n“Jews of the Span­ish Home­land” runs for a lit­tle over thir­teen min­utes and is a deeply strange affair – from the open­ing shot of the film­mak­er in thick, tri­an­gu­lar glass­es on a rooftop with a cam­era, to the plump rab­bi laugh­ing on a brass bed in the Balka­ns, to a man slit­ting the throat of a hen, and anoth­er man mov­ing along a row of seat­ed women, exam­in­ing teeth. The cam­era trav­els the tum­bled streets of the old Jud­erías of Tole­do, Cór­do­ba, and Sevil­la. And at 5.34–¡mirar!–a lit­tle fam­i­ly, actu­al Jews liv­ing in Barcelona! I did some research on the film­mak­er, Ernesto Giménez Caballero, and found out that he start­ed as an avant-garde intel­lec­tu­al and even­tu­al­ly became a Fas­cist who tried to set Hitler up with the sis­ter of Pri­mo de Rivero, the dic­ta­tor of Spain. Some­where in between, Ernesto Giménez Caballero had the bright idea that Sephardic Jews, sup­pos­ed­ly nos­tal­gic for their ​“lost home­land,” could be enlist­ed to help a weak­ened Spain regain pow­er in trade abroad, but his admi­ra­tion was short-lived. When the tide turned against the Jews, so did he.\n\nIn my nov­el, Ernesto Giménez Caballero knocks on the door of the unmarked lit­tle tem­ple. Rebec­ca pos­es for him. Her father, Alber­to, sens­es that some­thing is off and tells the film­mak­er to put his cam­era down. Giménez Caballero per­sists. Deals are made, bar­gains struck. Alber­to plays his ney, a Turk­ish flute made of reed, for the film­mak­er. They dis­cuss poet­ry. Rebec­ca flirts. Under­neath, some­thing else is hap­pen­ing. The scene is my inven­tion. In real life, I just know that my fam­i­ly was there, and so was he."
