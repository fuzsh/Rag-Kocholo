        "text": "The Letter\n\nLong overshadowed by William Wyler’s 1940 remake starring Bette Davis, the first filming, from 1929, of W. Somerset Maugham’s stage play “The Letter” has re-emerged, thanks to a new DVD edition from Warner Archive.\n\nAs the only surviving sound film of the radically innovative Broadway star Jeanne Eagels, the film is an important piece of theater history, preserving the performance style of a brilliant, eccentric and spectacularly self-destructive actress (who would die of a drug overdose seven months after the film’s release).\n\nBut, stiff as it may be in cinematic terms, “The Letter” is also a crucial piece of film history. One of the first talking films — or “audible photoplays,” as The New York Times then called them — to impress critics with the artistic possibilities of a technology still widely regarded as a gimmick, “The Letter” represented an important step on the way to the normalization of sound. (We’re still awaiting, with diminishing assurance, the similar steps that might make digital 3-D a permanent fixture of the movies.)\n\nEagels turned out to be a perfect match for Maugham’s Leslie Crosbie, the unhappy wife of a dull British planter (Reginald Owen) stranded in the jungles of Singapore. At a time when stage acting was more often concerned with elocution than emotion (as the canned theatrical performances of many other early talkies testify), Eagels seemed like a raw nerve, a conduit of convulsive feeling.\n\nHer ability to seize and stay “in the moment” — as generations of Method actors would later characterize it — is formidably illustrated in the scene in which she shoots her unfaithful lover (Herbert Marshall, who would play the betrayed husband in the remake). Completely unconcerned with her appearance (as if the camera, and its implied audience, weren’t even there), a wild-eyed Eagels fires again and again, thrusting the gun forward with each shot as if it were a knife.\n\nBette Davis is said to have greatly admired Eagels, and her breakthrough performance in another Maugham piece, “Of Human Bondage” (1934), already reflects Eagel’s influence: the sudden twitches, slashing vocal rhythms, the startling frankness of her big, bright eyes, switched on and off like the beam of a searchlight.\n\nBut as good as Davis is in the 1940 “Letter,” even she couldn’t let herself go to the degree that Eagels does in the climax of the 1929 film. Shot by the director Jean de Limur in what appears to be a continuous take photographed from three angles, the scene builds to an annihilating force as Eagels, slowly realizing that her husband has a dreadful punishment planned for her, strikes back as violently as she knows how.\n\nFixing her husband, and the audience, with a glare of pure hatred, Eagels spits out the famous curtain line — “With all my heart, and all my soul, I still love the man I killed!” — and then, clearly carried away by the passion she has summoned, repeats it to even greater effect. It’s a moment so sharp and vivid that it doesn’t seem like acting at all, but rather an intensified form of being. (wbshop.com/Warner-Archive, $19.99, not rated)\n\nZAZIE DANS LE MéTRO\n\nBased on a witty and profane experimental novel by Raymond Queneau, “Zazie Dans le Métro” (1960) was the French filmmaker Louis Malle’s nod toward the New Wave, a movement from which he was excluded by temperament and training. But Malle found in the free-form stylistics of the New Wave filmmakers — the improvised, location shooting; the jump cuts and dizzy camera; the open acknowledgment of genre conventions and cinematic artifice — a functional parallel to Queneau’s slangy, allusive prose and seemingly random narrative.\n\nToday “Zazie” seems a little too studiously zany to work as well as it once did. Too many subsequent years of abuse have turned the film’s devices (like using sped-up motion to suggest silent-film comedy) into clichés, and there are times when the viewer feels trapped in a Gallic version of “The Benny Hill Show.” Yet the premise — a foulmouthed 12-year-old girl from the provinces (Catherine Demongeot) arrives in Paris to spend two days with her uncle (Philippe Noiret), a female impersonator — allows plenty of opportunities for Malle and his cinematographer, Henri Raichi, to depict a Paris, now lost, of neon signs, family-run cafes and artisanal shops in the muted but flavorful Eastmancolor of the period.\n\nThat Eastmancolor seems more glorious than ever in the new Blu-ray edition of “Zazie” from the Criterion Collection, which for the first time in my experience makes it possible to appreciate fully the contribution of William Klein, the American-born photographer who worked as an artistic consultant on the film. The bold use of graphics, primary colors and distorting, wide-angle lenses give “Zazie” a zippy, Pop Art look that has no parallel in Malle’s career. Keep the remote handy, because this is one film that is much enhanced by a liberal use of the pause button.

Gore Verbinski directed this first animated feature from Industrial Light & Magic; with the voices of Isla Fisher, Ned Beatty, Abigail Breslin, Alfred Molina and Bill Nighy. “This rambling, anarchic tale is gratifyingly fresh and eccentric,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times in March. (Paramount, Blu-ray/DVD combo edition $40.99, DVD $30.99, PG)\n\nTHE LINCOLN LAWYER Matthew McConaughey stars as a Los Angeles defense lawyer whose career gets a boost when he’s hired by a Beverly Hills real estate heir (Ryan Phillippe) accused of roughing up a female escort. But there’s more to the case than meets the eye, in this thriller directed by Brad Furman. With Marisa Tomei, William H. Macy, Frances Fisher, John Leguizamo and Josh Lucas. “There are modest pleasures in a familiar story told differently enough that you’re happy to keep guessing and watching, despite this one’s five-ending pileup of a finish,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times in March. (Lionsgate, Blu-ray/DVD combo edition $39.99, DVD $29.95, R)\n\nUNCLE BOONMEE WHO CAN RECALL HIS PAST LIVES The Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul took home the Palme d’Or of the 2010 Cannes Film Festival for this multilayered tale of an elderly aristocrat who returns to the family estate to die. “Mr. Weerasethakul is less concerned with exhibiting the exotic glories of his native country — which, after all, is not exotic to him — than with drawing out the latent mysteries of ordinary existence,” Mr. Scott wrote in The Times in March. (Strand Releasing, Blu-ray $34.99, DVD $27.99, not rated)\n\nINSIDIOUS Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne move into a new home with their three young children but find that someone — or something! — is already living there. From the director James Wan and the writer Leigh Whannell, the team behind the original 2004 “Saw.” Mike Hale wrote in The Times in March that “Insidious” is “a run-of-the-mill 21st-century horror movie.” (Sony, Blu-ray $35.99, DVD $30.99, PG-13)\n\nAGATHA CHRISTIE’S POIROT MOVIE COLLECTION SET 6 David Suchet returns as the Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot in three television films: “Three Act Tragedy,” “The Clocks” and “Hallowe’en Party.” Guest stars include Jane Asher, Anna Massey and Zoe Wanamaker.
