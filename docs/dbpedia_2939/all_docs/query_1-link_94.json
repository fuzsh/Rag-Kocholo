        "text": "April 20, 2021\n\nJudith Weisenfeld’s book \"Hollywood Be Thy Name: African American Religion in American Film, 1929-1949\" examines the representations of Black communities and religion in early American sound film. Weisenfeld keenly critiques and historicizes the films, demonstrating that “representations of religion remain important to American film’s constructions of racialized identities and projections of African Americans in particular, even as the approaches to presenting African American religion have been considerably transformed in both Hollywood and black film” (238).\n\nWeisenfeld emphasizes the centrality of religion in films that depict Black communities. She argues that “film, as a significant contributor to the discursive production of race, gender, and sexuality in America, deserves an important place in any discussion of the technology of race” (4). Her book title is misleading however, although she qualifies her bold claim of studying “African American religion” by stating that she will only examine Christianity. She insists on the centrality of Christian practices as an integral part of Black identity, and examines them in order to chart the filmic relation race, religion and American identity. Non-Christian African religions appear only in passing; she makes minimal mention of “voodoo” practices just once when a “scene [in Dirty Gertie from Harlem U.S.A.] investigates the impact of the African-derived religious traditions of many immigrants from the Caribbean on black churches and black communities” (149). Weisenfeld directs her criticism, however, towards the commercialization of these practices and their filmic representations. Overall, while her analysis is acute and focused throughout the book, the title is too wide in scope; it holds forth a tantalizing promise it does not fulfill.\n\nWeisenfeld presents several themes in Hollywood Be Thy Name. A prominent one is Black on-screen representation. Who has the right to represent Blacks? Who has the knowledge to write and produce such works (of course the White “expert” King Vidor)? How is Black Christianity represented? Early sound films like Hallelujah and The Green Pastures employed all-Black casts, which seemed to lend them an air of authentic “childlikeness” that belied their constructedness. The films were marketed for authenticity and spontaneity by downplaying their actors’ professional skills. Contrary opinions about agency and representativeness circulated within and beyond the Black community. Some of the Black actors themselves later acknowledged that they had participated only to bolster their own careers, and that they had had deep concerns about the films’ content. Other films like Spencer Williams’s were produced from minor studios by Blacks for all-Black audiences, and presented a more intimate and vibrant Christianity that portrayed a specific moral vision for Black communities. They also grappled with a more realistic and complex Christianity than the childish absurdities presented by early Hollywood movies that distanced themselves from the religion they portrayed on screen.\n\nAn interesting aspect of that complex Black religion – which often escapes notice – is the pervasiveness of Roman Catholic religiosity. Williams’s films portray a wide variety of Catholic objects, practices and sensibilities in Black homes, like the Ave Maria, crucifixes throughout the house, the image of the Sacred Heart, Caroline talking or praying to her dead husband who aids her, and Brother Martin. Weisenfeld argues that the Protestant/Catholic visual culture divide in America has never been clear-cut, and that such scenes would not have surprised Black evangelical viewers.\n\nNaturally, representation and capital are closely linked, and Weisenfeld examines this critically in chapter 6, when she discusses Hollywood’s remarkable and crusade-like entry into the civil right foray. Whereas numerous actors, producers and directors expressed their hopes that they were shaping a more just America, others blatantly acknowledged the need to keep up with the times. And of course, the money. As one producer put it, “we found we made more money if we didn’t offend so many people” (208). This issue appears again in her article, where entertainment was an essential part of documentary making, and aimed to attract audiences with interwoven claims of authenticity and amusement.\n\nOverall, the book is detailed, well-argued and skillfully written. Weisenfeld adeptly weaves storytelling and analysis in a single narrative, creating a thoughtful and well-wrought argument. Ultimately, she convincingly portrays the impact of film in representing national debates and concerns about Christianity, Americanness and racial identity. This is especially prominent in films on Black soldiers in the segregated U.S. army during WWII and on racial passing. Sometimes sparking debates, films often challenged fixed social and racial boundaries and moved one step ahead of their times."
