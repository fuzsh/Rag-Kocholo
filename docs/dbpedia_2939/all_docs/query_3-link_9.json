        "text": "Funny Girl, American musical film, released in 1968, that was based on the stage show of the same name about the life and loves of early 20th-century film star and comedienne Fanny Brice. It marked the screen debut of Barbra Streisand, who reprised her theatrical role as Brice and earned an Academy Award for her spirited performance.\n\nThe story, told mostly in flashback, presents Fanny Brice as a young woman from the slums of New York City who is determined to succeed in show business despite her gawky manner and unglamorous looks. After early appearances in vaudeville, she is hired by Florenz Ziegfeld (played by Walter Pidgeon) to sing in his celebrated Ziegfeld Follies revue. On opening night she turns a dramatic wedding-themed number into a raucous comedy bit by unexpectedly coming onstage as a pregnant bride, and her comic sensibility quickly catapults her to fame. Meanwhile, Brice becomes romantically entwined with charismatic gambler Nick Arnstein (Omar Sharif). The two eventually marry, though the relationship becomes strained as he begins to resent her success. Faced with mounting debts, Nick gets involved in a fraudulent bond deal and is imprisoned for embezzlement. Upon his release, he visits Brice in her dressing room, and the two agree to part.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nMatch the Quote to the Movie Quiz"
