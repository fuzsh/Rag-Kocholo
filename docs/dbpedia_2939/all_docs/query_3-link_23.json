        "text": "Okay, so lemme get this straight: Mean Girls the movie was turned into a musical, which is now also being turned into a movie? It‚Äôs like The Matrix, but...fetch. That being said, this isn‚Äôt a reboot of the beloved 2000s LiLo flick, but a screen adaptation of Tina Fey, Jeff Richmond, and Nell Benjamin‚Äôs 2017 Broadway musical.\n\nThe Mean Girls musical movie just hit streaming services (!!!), and you may be scrolling through the web like Regina flips through her Burn Book to find any and all details surrounding the flick.\n\nSo get in, loser‚Äîwe‚Äôre diving deep into the deets of the Mean Girls musical movie, from its cast and trailer to its release date and plot.\n\nWhere to stream the Mean Girls musical movie\n\nThe Mean Girls musical movie adaptation hit theaters on January 12, 2024, and it hit Paramount+ on March 5, 2024. Standard subscriptions with ads start at $6 per month while subscriptions with limited ads and Showtime are available for $12 per month.\n\nThe movie is also available to buy and rent on a few streaming platforms, right this way:\n\nBuy or Rent 'Mean Girls' on Google Play\n\nIs there a trailer for the Mean Girls musical movie?\n\nYep! On November 8, 2023, Paramount dropped the official trailer across pretty much all Mean Girls social media platforms. Bonus: Olivia Rodrigo‚Äôs ‚ÄúGet Him Back!‚Äù served as the soundtrack to the iconic vid.\n\nThen, on November 15, the Mean Girls social accounts also gave a sneak preview of Rene√© Rapp‚Äôs fan-favorite rendition of ‚ÄúWorld Burn‚Äù with a cheeky teaser trailer captioned ‚ÄúMean Girls (Regina‚Äôs Version).‚Äù\n\nA few days before the film dropped, we got this final gem of the iconic Winter Talent Show in the new movie:\n\nWhat is Mean Girls about?\n\nSo, this is where things get a ü§è biiiit confusing. You see, the Mean Girls musical debuted on Broadway in 2017 and is based on the 2004 movie of the same name, which is based on the book . This new Mean Girls isn‚Äôt a reboot, per se, but a screen adaptation of the 2017 Broadway musical.\n\nThat! Being! Said! The story is similar to the OG movie but bring a fresh flair with some musical numbers. The original Mean Girls synopsis is as follows:\n\nTeenage Cady Heron was educated in Africa by her scientist parents. When her family moves to the suburbs of Illinois, Cady finally gets to experience public school and gets a quick primer on the cruel, tacit laws of popularity that divide her fellow students into tightly knit cliques. She unwittingly finds herself in the good graces of an elite group of cool students dubbed ‚Äúthe Plastics,‚Äù but Cady soon realizes how her shallow group of new friends earned this nickname.\n\nThe more you know!\n\nWho‚Äôs in the new Mean Girls cast?\n\nOn December 10, 2022, Rene√© Rapp posted an *adorable* throwback photo to let fans know that she‚Äôll be back as Regina George in the musical‚Äôs screen adaptation (ICYMI, she played the iconic character on Broadway in 2019). ‚ÄúMean Girls is one of the biggest reasons why I am where I am. It‚Äôs an honor. Tina, Jeff, Lorne, Eric and 2019 Mean Girls fans, I love you,‚Äù she wrote in her caption.\n\nVariety also reported that Angourie Rice, Auli‚ÄôI Cravalho, and Jaquel Spivey will play Cady Heron, Janis 'Imi'ike, and Damian Hubbard, respectively. Additional cast members include The Summer I Turned Pretty star Christopher Briney as Aaron Samuels, Bebe Wood as Gretchen Weiners, and Avantika Vandanapu as Karen Shetty.\n\nTina Fey and Tim Meadows will also reprise their roles from the original Mean Girls movie while Busy Phillipps and Jenna Fischer join the cast as Regina and Cady‚Äôs moms. Emily in Paris star Ashley Park also appears as Northshore‚Äôs French teacher‚Äîand it‚Äôs a pretty fun nod to the Broadway musical because she played Gretchen onstage way back when.\n\nWhere to stream the Mean Girls musical movie soundtrack\n\nThe official Mean Girls musical movie soundtrack hits streaming platforms the same day the flick hits theaters. It includes some fan favorites from the Broadway musical, like \"World Burn\" and \"I'd Rather Be Me\"‚Äîand a bonus fun pop track by Rene√© Rapp and Megan Thee Stallion, \"Not My Fault.\""
