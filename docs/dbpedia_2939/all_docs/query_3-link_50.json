        "text": "Attention amateur sleuths, the new Emma Myers-led teen mystery series is coming to Netflix soon. The first season dropped in the U.K. and Ireland on July 1, but can you watch the show in the U.S.? Read on to learn when A Good Girl’s Guide To Murder will be streaming on Netflix.\n\nThe BBC series is set in a sleepy English town and follows 17-year-old Pip Fitz-Amobi (Myers), a high school student determined to uncover a murder mystery that shook the community five years prior. A Good Girl’s Guide To Murder is based on the first book in Holly Jackson’s bestselling mystery trilogy.\n\n“Five years ago, schoolgirl Andie Bell was murdered by her boyfriend, Sal Singh. Case closed. The police know he did it. Everyone in town knows he did it,” the official Netflix synopsis reads. “But smart and single minded Pip Fitz-Amobi isn’t so sure and she’s determined to prove it. And if Sal Singh isn’t a murderer and the real killer is still out there, how far will they go to keep Pip from the truth?”\n\nMyers said that taking on the role of the relentless protagonist was daunting. “There are so many book fans,” she told BBC.com. She added that she’s “not as intelligent” as Pip. “I have a harder time putting things together and I don’t think I’d have the guts to confront as many people as she does.”\n\nThe Wednesday star is joined by Zain Iqbal, who plays Sal’s brother Ravi Singh. Anna Maxwell Martin, Gary Beadle, Mathew Baynton, India Lillie Davies, Rahul Pattni, Henry Ashton, Mitu Panicucci, Orla Hill, Ephraim O.P. Sampson, Carla Woodcock, Yasmin Al-Khudhairi, and more also star.\n\nWhen Is A Good Girl’s Guide To Murder Coming To Netflix?\n\nThe first season of A Good Girl’s Guide To Murder will premiere on Netflix on August 1, 2024, at 3 a.m. ET / 12 a.m. PT.\n\nTo watch A Good Girl’s Guide To Murder when it arrives on streaming, you’ll need a Netflix subscription. Standard with ads starts at $6.99 per month, standard (no ads) is $15.49 per month, and premium (no ads) is $22.99 per month. You can learn more on Netflix’s plans and pricing site. The streaming platform does not offer free trials.\n\nHow Many Episodes Are In A Good Girl’s Guide To Murder Season 1?\n\nA Good Girl’s Guide To Murder will have six episodes in total. Screenwriter Poppy Cogan opened up about the challenge of condensing the beloved novel into six episodes.\n\n“We’ve only got six 45-minute episodes, and there’s a lot of material in the book so it was about honing that, figuring out what was okay to leave out and what we needed to keep,” she told BBC.com. “It was a challenge, but Holly was really helpful with this.”\n\nWhat Is The A Good Girl’s Guide To Murder Release Schedule?\n\nSeason 1 of A Good Girl’s Guide To Murder will likely be released all at once when the series drops on Netflix on August 1, 2024.\n\nWatch the official Netflix trailer below."
