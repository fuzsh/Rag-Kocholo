        "text": "Can you name all five historic names for this former Thurman Street movie theater?\n\nTest your skill…\n\n1912: Ideal Theater was Designed by Emil Schacht and Son (silent movie theater)\n\nowner: Conrad LeBlanc\n\n1927: The Senate (facade remodel)\n\n1929: The Bluebird\n\n1944(45): Elmo (Fire c. 1949)\n\n1951: The Crown\n\nClosed December 1953 was used as a warehouse for years.\n\nEmil Schacht practiced architecture in Oregon for decades and is attributed for introducing the residential English Arts & Crafts style to Portland (Ritz p. 347). His fifteen residential buildings in Willamette Heights neighborhood (1905-1909) are worthy of a Multiple Properties National Register Nomination. The advocates fort the Irvington Historic District have documented and preserved many of his notable residences. He designed Astoria City Hall in 1904 which is still standing and had been adaptively reused as a hotel. The Lewis and Clark Exposition Building (1905) was one of his more famous designs. My person favorite building for its cultural significance to Portland’s Black History and pleasing design is the Golden West Hotel.\n\nThe architectural firm Emil Schacht and Son lasted from 1910-1916.\n\nAll historic sources state the theater seated between 300-330 patrons looking at the letter below I’m inclined to think that the theater in the WWII years seated 400 plus. Glad that James Lommasson and Stewart Harvey remodeled this building in 2004. I am often distracted by articles around Portland, OR and censorship in the late teens. Oddly enough in 1920 C.E. Yeager proprietor of the Ideal Theater was fined for having a girl under the age of 18 working in his theater-it must have been a sting because six theater owners were charged."
