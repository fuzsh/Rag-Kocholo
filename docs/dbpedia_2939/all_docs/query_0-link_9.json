        "text": "Starring: Louise Brooks\n\nDirected by G. W. Pabst\n\nSunday, October 23, 2022, 4:00 PM\n\nWith live musical accompaniment by pianist Andrew Earle Simpson\n\nThe second and final collaboration of actress Louise Brooks and director G.W. Pabst (Pandora’s Box), Diary of a Lost Girl is a provocative adaptation of Margarethe Böhme’s notorious novel, in which the naive daughter of a middle-class pharmacist is seduced by her father’s assistant, only to be disowned and sent to a repressive home for wayward girls. She escapes, searches for her child, and ends up in a high-class brothel, only to turn the tables on the society which had abused her. It’s another tour-de-force performance by Brooks, whom silent film historian Kevin Brownlow calls an “actress of brilliance, a luminescent personality and a beauty unparalleled in screen history.” – Thomas Gladysz\n\nAtlas Silent Film Series\n\nFeaturing HOLLYWOOD FLAPPER ICONS of the 1920s\n\nLouise Brooks, Marion Davies, and Joan Crawford\n\nWith live musical accompaniment by pianist Andrew Earle Simpson\n\nFlappers of the 1920s were young women known for their energetic freedom, embracing a lifestyle viewed by many at the time as outrageous, immoral or downright dangerous. Now considered the first generation of independent American women, flappers pushed barriers in economic, political and sexual freedom for women. Our film series this season features the works of three of the most influential and powerful women in the Hollywood of their time: Louise Brooks, Marion Davies, and Joan Crawford.\n\nEach screening will include a pre-show intro and a post-show discussion with Andrew Earle Simpson."
