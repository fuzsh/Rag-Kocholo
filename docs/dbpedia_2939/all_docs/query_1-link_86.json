        "text": "“The art of motion pictures grew into full maturity in the silent era. The height of the silent era was a particularly fruitful period, full of artistic innovation. The film movements of Classical Hollywood as well as French Impressionism, German Expressionism, and Soviet Montage began in this period. Silent filmmakers pioneered the art form to the extent that virtually every style and genre of film-making of the 20th and 21st centuries has its artistic roots in the silent era. The silent era was also a pioneering one from a technical point of view.”\n\nThe Golden Age of Silent Cinema was the time when stars rose and fell, studios perfected the mass production of films, and American movies dominated the global film market. Studio marketed films on the power of their stars. Genres like gangster movies and romantic comedies took hold and flourished and audiences craved gossip about the private lives of celebrities (so not that different from today then). Within film studios, the entire film production process took place (from conceiving the film to distributing them), the studios chose California (for the sunny weather, its proximity to all kinds of terrain, and its distance from Thomas Edison much of the 1910s fighting for control of the American film industry from his base in New Jersey).\n\nThree stuiods were in charge of the film industry during the Silent Era: the Famous Players-Lasky Corporation (later becoming Paramount Pictures), Loew’s Inc. (beginning as a theatre chain), ad First National Pictures. Not only did these three dominate the marketplace, but they also exercised near complete control over the creative and personal lives of their star, writers, and directors (filmmakers often had to choose between following orders or abandoning their career). Then four of the most figures in early silent cinema came together to create their own film studio. In 1919, two directors, Charlie Chaplin and D.W. Griffith, and two stars, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, founded United Artists. Their goal was to give the filmmakers greater control over their films and a higher of the profits.\n\nIn 1924, the most powerful studio emerged when Loew’s purchased Goldwyn Pictures and Louis B. Mayer Productions to create Metro-Goldwyn-Mayen (better known as MGM). This is a process that would get repeated throughout the 1920s and 1930s, as studios merged, sold, or split apart. Probably because of prohibitions and they didn’t have anything else to do. By the end of the era, most American films were being made at studios whose names you might recognise, not only United Artists and MGM, but also Warner Brothers, Fox, Columba Pictures, and Universal. While the corporate structure of these companies kept changing, the process by which they were making films became remarkably stable and efficient. The major studios became very good at churning out large-scale, commercial movies with mass appeal.\n\nOne of the leading innovators in setting up the studios and their production methods was Thomas H. Ince. Ince came to film a failed actor, he directed his first film in 1910, and by 1913 he was making as many as 150 two-reelers a year. His biggest impact on film came by applying the lessons of mass production to the actual making of movies. Prior to this, most films were overseen by a director, a single person who conceived the story, worked with the actors, and operated the camera. Ince broke those roles into separate jobs: a screenwriter (to develop the story and then write the script), a director (to work on set with the actors and to make decisions on set), an editor (to edit the footage), a producer (to supervise everything), and a studio head (to oversee the whole studio).\n\nWhile other filmmakers had played around with these roles, it was Ince who standardised them into a system (a system we use today – the reason I might have a job in the future). By 1912, he’d earned a large sum of money which he used to buy property in California just west of Hollywood, where he built Inceville, his own studio. It was here that Ince built the first permanent exterior sets (made to look like far away locations, such as Italy and Japan). Due to Ince’s work to streamline the roles of production, he was able to triple his studio’s output.\n\nMack Sennet (an early filmmaker and one-time partner of Ince) was responsible for discovering a large collection of film legends (such as Gloria Swanson and Charlie Chaplin).\n\nCharlie Chaplin was born into poverty in England in 1889, later in life, he went into acting after signing the Vaudeville company and left for American at age nineteen. After he was scouted by a talent mogul, who got him hired by Sennet, Charlie Chaplin became the famous icon he is today. It didn’t long for Chaplin to develop his iconic Tramp Persona and begin directing his own films. After finishing his first film contract, Chaplin struck an amazing deal with Essanay Studios to make fourteen short films. Whilst there, he managed to combine his sense of empathy and his recognisable tramp character with the growing ability to make audiences laugh. Chaplin was so popular that when his contract ran out in 1915, he negotiated a salary of $10,000 (which is roughly $242,000 in today’s climate) per week (which is $125,840,0 a year) with the Mutual Film Corporation, They have paid him a signing bonus of $150,000 (roughly $3.5 million today).\n\nThe films Chaplin made with his new studio brought him international fame, they marked the first time his focus on the poor verged into social criticism, a place silent comedies rarely went. Chaplin’s films often focus on the gentle, accidental heroism of the downtrodden (he made the powerful the butt of his jokes and displayed tremendous empathy for the poor and the humble). Then in 1919, at age 30, he co-founded United Artists in an effort to exercise greater control. Whilst at United Artist he made some of his most famous films (and some of the best comedies of all time), such as The Kid, The Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern Times, The Great Dictator. His career was later hampered by legal issues and socialist sympathies which landed him on the post-war blacklist and kept him from making films.\n\nA few real-life Hollywood scandals at the time brought on the first censorship of American cinema (the public didn’t like the morals the films showed the audience). The most famous of these scandals centred around Fatty Arbuckle, who was accused of the rape and accidental death of an actress named Virginia Rappe, although he was acquitted the scandal itself all but ended his career and allowed the government to crack down on the lack of morality in the film business. Rather than wait for Congress to get involved, the major film players in the film industry banded together with the M.P.P.D.A (the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America). They hired a retired Postmaster General name will Hays, a conservative Evangelical, to prove they were serious about cleaning up their act.\n\nHays put together the Motion Picture Production Code, also known as the Hays Code, a catalogue of things filmmakers could and couldn’t show on screen. The code also suggested Compensating Values, the idea was that films could show characters engaging in vice for most of the film as long as virtue triumphed in the end. No one employed this trick better than the director Cecile B. Demille, he was a master at giving the audience everything they wanted and could handle for the first three-quarters of the movie, before virtue came out on top. German director Ernst Lubitsch came to Hollywood in 1922 and made a successful series of witty sex comedies that relied on innuendo rather than skin. For many filmmakers, the Hays Code became the least of their worries as synchronous sound was developed.\n\n(credit for the information goes to Crash Course and Wikipedia and credit for the featured image goes to Haiku Deck)"
