They are promoting the 1929 MGM musical film The Broadway Melody, winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\n________________________\n\nThe Broadway Melody is a 1929 film musical, the first sound film to win an Academy Award for Best Picture. It was one of the first musicals to feature a Technicolor sequence, which sparked the trend of color being used in a flurry of musicals that would hit the screens in 1929-1930. Today the Technicolor sequence is presumed lost and only a black and white copy survives in the complete film. The film was the first musical released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and was Hollywood’s first all-talking musical.\n\nWriters Norman Houston and James Gleason adapted the screenplay from a story by Edmund Goulding. The film was directed by Harry Beaumont. The score, with music by Nacio Herb Brown and words by Arthur Freed, included the popular hit “You Were Meant For Me”. Bessie Love was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance.\n\nCharles King plays the song-and-dance man whose affection for one sister (Harriet alias Hank) is supplanted by his growing love for the younger, more beautiful sister (Queenie). Queenie tries to protect her sister and derail the love triangle by dating a wealthy but unscrupulous “stage door Johnny.”- excerpts from Wikipedia, adapted\n\nLove Boat – sung by James Burrows\n\n______________\n\nBroadway Melody – The song was used again during the opening credits of the unrelated films Broadway Melody of 1938 and Broadway Melody of 1940.\n\nFrom the The Broadway Melody (1929):\n\nCharles King, with Nacio Herb Brown on the piano\n\n.\n\n(above images) Bessie Love in costume as “Hank” Mahoney for the staged “Broadway Melody” number of The Broadway Melody (1929), with see-through top hat\n\n(below) Charles King with Bessie Love and Anita Page during a scene featuring a dress rehearsal of the “Broadway Melody” number of the latest revue being produced by Francis Zanfield\n\nThe “Broadway Melody” number in the new Zanfield show originally features dancing by the vaudeville sister act known as the Mahoney Sisters. Hank and Queenie Mahoney (played by Love and Page, respectively) are attempting to break through into the big time on Broadway. However, in the scene featuring a dress rehearsal of “Broadway Melody,” Zanfield interrupts the performance to cut the sisters from the number, saying, “That number is too slow. Cut out the Mahoney Sisters.”\n\n______________________\n\nConrad Nagel and Anita Page\n\nYou Were Meant for Me\n\nThe song has been recorded numerous times including a recent version by Sting (98). It was included in the films Penny Serenade (1942) and Singin’ in the Rain (1952).\n\nConrad Nagel sings the song to Anita Page in The Hollywood Revue of 1929, voice overdubbed by Charles King. The camera is on King for a second prior to Nagel’s performance. A bit later it cuts back to King for a couple of seconds, showing him looking disturbed.\n\n.\n\nCharles King — 1929 Victor recording, with the speed corrected by the Youtube provider\n\n.\n\nHarold Scrappy Lambert – 1929\n\n.\n\nClaude Thornhill and his Orchestra — c.1940\n\n_____________\n\nThe Wedding of the Painted Doll\n\nSung offscreen by James Burrows, and danced by a chorus, including the “Zanfield Dolly Girls” and a few men: bridegroom, best man, and an acrobatic “preacher”\n\n.\n\n(above) Bessie Love as Hank Mahoney and Charles King as Eddie\n\nBoy Friend — performed by the Mahoney sisters (Bessie Love and Anita Page)\n\n.\n\nTruthful Parson Brown (Willard Robison) *\n\nAt the website for the vintage reissue label Take Two Records, the product description of an album of recordings by Earl Burtnett and His Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel Orchestra, includes the following information regarding the Biltmore Trio:\n\nIn 1927, The Biltmore Trio, consisting of Eddie Bush, Bill Seckler and Paul Gibbons, joined Burtnett and enhanced the group not only with strings, but mainly with their vocals. The Trio’s popularity soon rivaled that of the band, encouraging other bandleaders to add vocal trios to their orchestras.\n\nInternet Movie Database credits the band and its members in the film’s Soundtracks list as follows: “Played and Sung by guitarists Eddie Bush, Paul Gibbons, Bill Seckler and Ches Kirkpatrick.”\n\nIMDb also includes Bush, Seckler, and Gibbons in the Full Cast & Crew list for the film, individually crediting each of the three as “Quartet Guitarist and Singer.” The fourth quartet guitarist and singer listed by IMDB is Ches Kirkpatrick. Eddie Lang is also included in the full cast and crew list, but as a “Guitar Player in Band,” not as a member of the quartet.\n\n(above) The pair of photos above appears to show three members of the group which performs “Truthful Parson Brown” in the following clip from The Broadway Melody. I take these three to be Eddie Bush, Bill Seckler and Paul Gibbons, based upon the aforementioned credits at the IMDb, and the quote from the Take Two Records compilation cited above.\n\nSince he is not among the Biltmore Trio members shown in the above photos, nor among the Biltmore Trio members credited by IMDb for appearances in several 1929-1930 films (see “Note” directly below the video), nor among the members of the trio listed in the Take Two Records quote above, the lead singer and fourth member of the quartet would seem be Ches Kirkpatrick, the only other “Quartet Guitarist and Singer” included in the IMDb cast credits. That one of the “guitarists” in the quartet plays ukulele in this number, while the lead singer holds but does not play a guitar, are details not reflected in the IMDb credits.\n\nVideo clip presently unavailable\n\n__________________\n\nA summary of films in which the Biltmore Trio (Eddie Bush, Bill Seckler, and Paul Gibbons), and the Biltmore Quartet (same three members, plus Ches Kirkpatrick) appear follows. They were uncredited for each of these films, except the self-titled short of 1929, but have been identified by IMDb, and in other filmographies.\n\nBiltmore Trio: Bush, Seckler, Gibbons\n\n1929 Biltmore Trio (short)\n\n1930 Party Girl\n\n1930 Chasing Rainbows\n\n1930 Children of Pleasure\n\n1930 Love In the Rough\n\n1930 Ladies Last\n\n1930 Peacock Alley\n\nBiltmore Quartet: Bush, Seckler, Gibbons, Kirkpatrick\n\n1929 The Hollywood Revue of 1929**\n\n1929 The Broadway Melody\n\n1929 Words and Music\n\nIMDb also identifies Bush, Seckler, and Gibbons as cast members, presumably performing as but not specifically identified as a trio, of the third of four 1928 shorts titled Earl Burtnett and his Biltmore Hotel Orchestra. Bill Seckler later became a member of the vocal group Three Hits and a Miss, which soon expanded to become Six Hits and a Miss.\n\nBessie Love and Anita Page\n\n_________________________\n\n_________________\n\n* My song list for the film is made from combining lists at Wikipedia and IMDb, using the order found at the former, but adding Harmony Babies from the latter. Harmony Babies, according to IMDB, is a Brown-Freed number which is “sung and danced briefly by Anita Page and Bessie Love” and reprised near the end of the film. IMDb also has “The Boy Friend” rather than “Boy Friend.” Truthful Parson Brown is given as Truthful Deacon Brown at Wikipedia. However, ASCAP lists the song as Truthful Parson Brown, with no variant titles."
