        "text": "One recent rainy day, I not only got to stand centre stage at the Moulin Rouge, but I also got to study one of the towering but yet incredibly lightweight feathered headpieces in the palm of my cocktail ring-encrusted hands. Straightaway, my posture grew more erect as my attitude made a snap adjustment. I was in heaven.\n\nIn fact, I even applied some cheeky elbow grease to a shimmy-like can-can across the old boards, still covered in a light dusting of pink plumages, sequins, and glitter from the previous night’s performance. Head-over-heels like a real hoofer, then and there, I decided to choreograph a special Paris-related cinematic riddle.\n\nDear film and musical buffs, beyond a shadow of a doubt, this post is for you.\n\nNow, let’s roll out the 39 clues. Name that film!\n\nThe flick takes place in the City of Light.\n\nThe lead actor’s name was Betty.\n\nBut she wasn’t Mayor Jimmy Walker’s petite amie.\n\nSee, that was another “Betty” with a similar rising star and last name.\n\n“Jolly, effervescent, and practical,” was this jazz baby’s reputation.\n\nAnd her heroine characters possessed street smarts and a heart of gold.\n\nAn early advocate for equal pay, she even created her own production company.\n\nBetty also had a proven drawing power. Plus, she was a press corps favorite.\n\n“That girl has guts!” wrote Liberty Magazine.\n\nGraham Cutts directed. Michael Balcon and Victor Saville were the producers.\n\nWell aware of Betty’s previous box office hit parade, they got her on the horn.\n\n“I am worth it!” the plucky “home girl” from Beaver, Utah told the production team during the telephone tête-à-tête.\n\nThey agreed. Betty was offered a “freak” salary of 1000 pounds per week.\n\nAlong with a two-picture deal and solo star billing.\n\nNobody put Betty in a corner.\n\nThe silent moving picture was launched in August 1923.\n\nCritics adored the starlet’s performance, writing, “Oh, Mother of Pearl! Aglow when she appears! The incomparable Betty has outdone herself!”\n\nNow, the Assistant Director was an unknown. At the time, that is.\n\nOne Alfred J. Hitchcock. Just 23 years old.\n\nAnd this was one of his first real film breaks.\n\nHe also agreed to co-write the screenplay, based on Michael Morton’s stage play.\n\nA love affair between a soldier and a Moulin Rouge dancer.\n\nHitch would design the sets, too.\n\nTo prepare, the future “Master of Suspense” made several scouting trips to Paris.\n\nEach time he went, it was first to mass at L’Église de la Madeleine.\n\nThen off to the Moulin Rouge.\n\nWhich had just re-opened, after its 1914 fire.\n\nBut the dance scenes were shot on a sound stage in Joinville, a distant suburb.\n\nFor the big chorus number, dancers were brought in from the Casino de Paris.\n\n“An exact replica is what I was after!” said the assistant director.\n\nAnd authentic is what he got—to a T.\n\nFollowing suit with the Moulin Rouge’s décor, Hitchcock dressed his stage in windmills and chats noire with the newly built Sacré Coeur in view.\n\nDolly Tree, a Folies Bergère designer, created the costumes.\n\nHer confections were gossamer-fine and shiny, too. It was Paris, after all.\n\nBy the 1920s, prancing in the buff was the norm in most clubs.\n\nBut this film was for English and American audiences.\n\n“No French breast could be exposed on the screen!” said producer Saville.\n\nSeamstresses outfitted the costumes with hidden brassieres on the spot.\n\nWith full support systems in place, the finale was shot in a single night so the dancers could get back to Paris in time for Sunday’s matinee.\n\nEven with muted titillation, the film still swayed. A crowd pleaser so popular, the production team brought the “love saga” back to the screen again as a talkie in 1929. With Betty, of course.\n\nNow, here are the questions:\n\nWhat was the name of the film? And who was Betty?\n\nIn the words of Betty herself, “Sing it like you mean it! The music gives you the heart and the courage to conquer!”"
