        "text": "The Saenger Theater opened on Thanksgiving Day 1929 to much fanfare. The admission charge was six cents for children. One of the outstanding features was the organ, which was played before the beginning of a movie and then between shows. The theater organ sound, with its ability to mimic other instruments and create sound effects, differs from that of other organs, and today it still brings instant memories to those who heard it in the earlier years. The chandelier was something to behold in the small city of Hattiesburg. Some mothers admonished their children not to sit under it, as it might fall!\n\nFor many years, the theater often showed three different feature movies in a week: one on Monday and Tuesday, another on Wednesday and Thursday, another on Friday and Saturday. Although there were a number of other “picture shows” in Hattiesburg (the Rose, Lomo, Buck, and Strand, to name four), the Saenger brought the most popular first-run movies to town and was the elite movie house.\n\nThe movie menu included coming attractions, advertisements, sing-alongs, cartoons, and organ recitals. One of the added attractions was Bank Night, when a door prize was offered, sometimes as much as $50. The winner had to be present to win. The theater did not empty between shows, and many would stay through several showings, especially on Saturdays when a first-run Western (“horse opera”) was shown.\n\nABC Interstate Theatres closed The Saenger in 1974 after showing its final film, The Exorcist. Upon closure, ABC donated the theater to the City of Hattiesburg. The building was dormant for several years until Mayor Bobby Chain, in the early 1980s, led a modest renovation project. A key element by Mayor Chain was locating, purchasing from a private owner, repairing and re-installing the original organ in the theater, all at his own personal expense. The organ remains in use today."
