It is unrelated to the 1929 film The Time, the Place and the Girl.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nSteve and Jeff are about to open a nightclub when a man named Martin Drew who represents conductor Ladislaus Cassel claims that Cassel, who is living next door, objects to the club's music and that it disturbs his granddaughter, Victoria, an aspiring opera singer.\n\nIt turns out that Cassel himself is fine with the club but Vicki's grandmother Lucia is against it. Cassel also urges Vicki not to marry Andrew, her fiancée, without being certain. After she meets Steve, she is attracted to him. Steve has a girlfriend, Elaine Winters, who is trying to persuade John Braden, a rich Texan, to finance the club. Elaine is upset about Vicki's presence and threatens to marry Braden.\n\nJeff and his girlfriend, singer Sue Jackson, hope to get a new show off the ground, but both Vicky's grandmother and Steve's girl Elaine keep interfering. Cassel offers to finance the show provided Vicky can be in it. Lucia is livid until she reluctantly attends the show, at which she is charmed and gives her approval.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nDennis Morgan as Steven Ross\n\nJack Carson as Jeff Howard\n\nJanis Paige as Sue Jackson\n\nMartha Vickers as Victoria Cassel\n\nS.
