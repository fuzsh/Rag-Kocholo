It is the perfect introduction to any communications class on the earliest images of the journalist in film.\n\nIt could be used in any class on history, media, ethics, communication studies or any class discussing the role of the journalist in our society.\n\nThe video is for personal, research and educational use only and is available only to IJPC Associates. It is not available anywhere else.\n\nIn the second installment, Part Two: 1920-1929, a total of 1,514 films with each character and event identified and all of the table information encoded, were annotated and put into ten more appendices -- Appendix 12, 1920 (753 pages); Appendix 13, 1921 (702 pages); Appendix 14, 1922 789 pages); Appendix 15, 1923 (689 pages); Appendix 16, 1924 (538 pages); Appendix 17, 1925 (605 pages); Appendix 18, 1926 (573 pages); Appendix 19, 1927 (573 pages); Appendix 20, 1928 (620 pages); Appendix 21, 1929 (576 pages).

Each appendix includes the original reviews of the film in a variety of silent film periodicals.

Just 2,749 of those are still with us in some complete form,\n\neither as an original American 35mm version, a foreign release, or a lower-quality copy.
