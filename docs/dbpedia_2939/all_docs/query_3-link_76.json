        "text": "That rather provocative premise coupled with the star power behind the project might have been expected to attract a wide audience, but the film was met with largely negative reviews from critics and ultimately bypassed a cinema release in the UK.\n\nInstead, up until now it has only been available to rent and own on digital platforms, however the film may be about to be discovered by a new audience courtesy of a streaming launch overseas.\n\nRead on for everything you need to know.\n\nMore like this\n\nCan I watch Miller's Girl in the UK?\n\nThe film is currently available to rent and buy on a number of streaming services in the UK, including Amazon Prime Video, Google Play and YouTube, having been released on Monday 19th February.\n\nMeanwhile US viewers are now able to stream the movie on Netflix, with it having been added to the platform on Thursday 25th April. As yet, there is no indication whether the film will also be added to the UK Netflix library in due course – but we'll keep this page updated if we hear any more information.\n\nMiller’s Girl plot\n\nThe official synopsis reads: “A talented young writer embarks on a creative odyssey when her teacher assigns a project that entangles them both in an increasingly complex web.\n\n“As lines blur and their lives intertwine, professor and protégé must confront their darkest selves while straining to preserve their individual sense of purpose and the things they hold most dear.”\n\nIs there a trailer for Miller's Girl?\n\nYes, a trailer for the film dropped in December last year, showing Freeman's character discussing his new student Cairo with his colleagues (played by Dagmara Domińczyk and Bashir Salahuddin).\n\nElsewhere in the trailer, we see Gideon Adlon's character Winnie encouraging Cairo to get Jonathon to fall in love with her.\n\n\"It's like he's been living in grayscale and you're the first thing he's seen in colour,\" Winnie tells Cairo.\n\nYou can watch the trailer below:"
