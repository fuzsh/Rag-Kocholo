While THE TIME, THE PLACE AND THE GIRL never rises above being a pleasant little "let's put on a show" musical, it does feature a few sprightly song numbers that are easy on the eyes and ears--and all of the performances are genial and appealing.

Dennis Morgan and Jack Carson are ideal as show biz guys willing to put something over on Martha Vickers in order to get backing for their enterprise. Vickers comes across as even more appealing than she was in THE BIG SLEEP as the nymphomaniacal daughter. And for good measure, there's the always vivacious Janis Paige doing her standard musical comedy thing with finesse. Donald Woods does a standout job as the stuffy tutor of musical pupil Vickers.

Comic relief from Florence Bates and S.Z. Sakall is a big help--especially since the script itself is none too witty. But what really makes the film a special delight are the handsome production values which went into this formula musical and two outstanding songs that are given first-rate treatment: A GIRL FROM CALICO and A RAINY NIGHT IN RIO.

If you like backstage musicals, you'll enjoy this minor delight.
