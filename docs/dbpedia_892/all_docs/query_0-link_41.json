        "text": "The 4th Scientific Meeting on the 19th-century Cuban Theaters, will be held from September 7 to 9, at Sauto theater, located in Western Matanzas.\n\nThis event, which joins every two years researchers and directors from cultural institutions in this Coliseum, National Monument, will foster this time the dialogue about preservation works, programming and contemporary audience studies.\n\nAs a novelty of the upcoming edition, stand out the exchange on theater buildings dating back to the 20th century in small towns of the country, to draw the attention towards the evident deterioration of these facilities, told Daneris Fernández Fonseca, organizer of the event to AIN News Agency.\n\nThe works to return the former splendor to Sauto Theater, being submitted to the more comprehensive restoration along its history, reached the 70% aimed at preserving the authenticity of the neoclassical building, as explained by Leonel Pérez Orozco, Historian of Matanzas province.\n\nInaugurated in 1863, Sauto Theater has a similar acoustic to the Teatro alla Scala and its design was in charge of Italian architect Daniel Dall."
