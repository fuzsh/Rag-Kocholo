        "text": "The U.S. press described maestro Frank Fernández as a virtuoso with complete command of the piano and a great power of communication, after his performance at the famous Ravinia Festival, in Chicago. John Von Rhein, the city’s most important music critic, praised the concert repertory, noting the musicians “grounding in both the standard classical repertory and in Cuban and Latin American vernacular music.”\n\nMiguel Matamoros was born on May 8, 1894 and died on April 15, 1971. 2015 marks the 90th anniversary of the founding of the famous Trío Matamoros, precisely on Miguel’s birthday in 1925. In the late 1960s, I was invited by some friends who studied music to the Santiago de Cuba carnival. These students of the National School of Arts (ENA) in Havana took me to the home where the giant of son, Miguel Matamoros, spent his final years.\n\nRight wing forces, incapable of recognizing the electoral victories of popular governments, consistently resort to violent action, as is currently happening in Ecuador. After the failure of a general strike called for August 13, the opposition here launched another adventure, blocking roads – including the Pan American Highway – burning vehicles and tires, in an attempt to lay the groundwork for a coup d’etat against President Rafael Correa and the Citizens’ Revolution.\n\nWhen one hears about the Judo Hall of Fame, they discover, among other things that only 30 great figures in the history of the sport have achieved such a distinction. This detail demonstrates how difficult it is to be included in the select group, to which Cuba’s Driulis González was inducted last Saturday, August 22.\n\nDuring the 14th International Dengue Course, which concluded on Friday at the Pedro Kourí Institute of Tropical Medicine (IPK) in Havana and saw the participation of professionals from 35 countries, the expert told AIN that the Cuban institution is one of the great bastions in which the PAHO / WHO find support to control the disease in the Americas.\n\nThe 4th Scientific Meeting on the 19th-century Cuban Theaters, will be held from September 7 to 9, at Sauto theater, located in Western Matanzas.\n\nThis event, which joins every two years researchers and directors from cultural institutions in this Coliseum, National Monument, will foster this time the dialogue about preservation works, programming and contemporary audience studies.\n\nPuerto Rican singer Olga Tañon announced recently through social networks that she will perform two free concerts in Cuba in December, to fulfill her dream of returning to sing on that Caribbean island. As she expressed in her official account on Facebook and Twitter, Olga will return to sing to the people of Cuba, after filming last month in Havana a live promo video for the single Amo La Vida.\n\nSpecialists at the Benny More Art Center, located in Cienfuegos Central-Southern province, reported this institution will celebrate the 96th birth anniversary of the renowned worldwide artist Benny More, known as El Bárbaro del Ritmo (August 24, 1919-February 19, 1963). El Benny is considered one of the most important Cuban musicians. His wide reaching voice and innate capacity for musical composition placed him at a very high position on international stages where he sang.\n\nThe United States knows it has lost ground in Our America and wants it back at any cost, sparking a chain reaction to push progressive governments of the region out of power, those it considers “enemies” that should be overthrown by any means or through “soft, low intensity or violent coups,” it’s all the same.\n\nJazz player Wynton Marsalis will launch an album that includes themes of his three live concerts at Mella Theater in October 2010, as reported to the NBC. Live in Cuba deals with the deep connections with American jazz and Afro-Cuban music “from bebop to bolero, and much beyond that”."
