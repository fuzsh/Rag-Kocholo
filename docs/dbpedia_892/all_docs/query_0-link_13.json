        "text": "Check out the Teatro Sauto in Matanzas, Cuba, its cultural importance and majestic architecture\n\nTeatro Sauto, Matanzas\n\n© Paleo Strary\n\nThe Teatro Sauto (Sauto Theater), located in the heart of Matanzas, in the Plaza de la Vigía, is one of the most important and prestigious coliseums on the island, not only because of its beautiful neoclassical architecture but also because it has hosted great artists from Cuba and around the world.\n\nConsidering that the city of Matanzas is also known as the Athens of Cuba due to the fact that it is home to numerous intellectuals and artists, and the scene of a busy cultural life, in addition to being the cradle of rumba, it is not surprising that this magnificent theatre is known for its fantastic acoustics.\n\nThis work by the Italian architect and decorator Daniele Dall'Aglio was first opened in 1863 and declared a National Monument in 1978. The building preserves its imposing original architecture: the Greek marble goddesses who welcome the spectators in the main hall, the muses who decorate the ceiling of the main hall, the wooden curtain that represents the famous Puente de la Concordia (Concordia Bridge) symbol of the city...\n\nIn the magical atmosphere created by this place, the 775 spectators who have a seat in this theatre have had the opportunity to enjoy the performances of great world stars such as the Russian dancer Anna Pavlova or the Spanish Antonio Gades.\n\nMore Information:\n\nLocation:\n\nPlaza de la Vigía, calle 272.\n\nTelephone:\n\n(+53) 7 243420.\n\nInteractive map:"
