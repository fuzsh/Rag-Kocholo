        "text": "Situated on the shore of a large bay, Matanzas is the cradle of the national dance âEl DanzÃ³nâ. Land of some of the most outstanding Cuban poets, intellectuals, philosophers and musicians, it has always been famous for an intense cultural and economic life, hence the name âThe Athens of Cubaâ. The city has also been called the âVenice of Cubaâ because of the many bridges on the San Juan and Yumuri rivers, linking the historic center with other quarters of the city.\n\nCoral Beach, just 15km from Varadero on the road to Matanzas City has a coral and sand beach with sublime reefs just meters offshore (Varadero has none close enough to swim to). Water visibility often exceeds 25m, so be ready for great glimpses of some of the over sixty species of coral and over a hundred species of fish thriving there. Excellent spot for snorkeling and diving. All equipment is available for rent.\n\nSaturno Cave is a cenote or underground natural swimming hole where water is a lurid turquoise and you can swim or snorkel among stalagmites and stalactites.\n\nBellamar Caves were discovered by chance in 1861 by a slave who was digging in the ground searching for water. Visitors can see marine fossils dating from 26 million years ago and outstanding crystal formations in intriguing shapes. The caves became the first tourist attraction in Cuba.\n\nThis temple was named after Monserrat Mountains in CataluÃ±a and built in 1875 by Catalonian JosÃ© Bartolome Borrel at the highest point of the city, dominating a perfect view of the Yumuri Valley and the city. The statue of âVirgen de Monserratâ which decorates the high altar became a Spanish community response after the outbreak of the independence war in 1868 to oppose âVirgen de la Caridad del Cobreâ, Madonna of the rebels, known as mambises.\n\nFormerly called the Main Square where military parade were held in 1800s. There is an impressive statue of JosÃ© MartÃ­ in the middle of the square surrounded by some attractive buildings: the Artistic and Literary Lyceum (1860), the Spanish Casino (1900s), the City Hall, the Casa White and the Pharmaceutical Museum (1882).\n\nBuilt as a drug store and inaugurated in 1882 by of Dr. Ernesto Triolet and Juan FermÃ­n de Figueroa, it was turned into a museum in 1964. The original porcelain vases, an incredible quantity of small bottles with herbs syrups and elixirs stand on the wooden shelves. It also collects millions of old labels, mortars, stills and books of old remedies.\n\nThis is the cityÂ´s foundational site, the core of the first streets layout which is connected to other city quarters by Concordia and Calixto GarcÃ­a bridges. There is a statue of an unknown soldier of the independence wars in the middle and several of the cityÂ´s key sights: the Neoclassical Fire Station, the Palace of Justice (1826), the Sauto Theater (1863), the Provincial Museum (1838), etc. stand around it.\n\nThis theater was designed by the Italian Architect Daniele DellÂ´Aglio and opened on 1863 as Esteban Theater, after the governor. It was later renamed as Sauto Theatre after a local pharmacist Ambrosio de la ConcepciÃ³n Sauto Noda who had been a great financial contributor to its construction. It is a neoclassical structure with several Greek inspired statues made of Carrara marble and frescoes of Renaissance inspiration. It has been chosen venue for all kinds of shows where Cuban and world famous artists have performed as Sarah Bernhardt, ballet dancer Anna Pavlova, etc.\n\nIt is a typical military construction of Renaissance style part of the old defense system to protect the city from pirate and Spanish enemiesâ attacks. Because of the historical and architectural values the castle became a National Monument in 1978. In 2009, a museum that pictures the life and history of the fortress as well as the legacy of slavery in the province of Matanzas, was inaugurated in the premises. It is also the seat of the Museum of the Slave Route, a project supported by UNESCO."
