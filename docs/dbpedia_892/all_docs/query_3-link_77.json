        "text": "Cuba Film & Photography Production Services & Camera Crews\n\nAre you a media company, brand, ad agency or production company looking for film / photography production support or shooting crew in Cuba? Contact us for trusted fixers, producers, directors, DoPs, videographers, photographers, and full shooting crews tailored for the specific needs of your project.\n\nFilming in Cuba\n\nFor an introduction to shooting in Cuba see below notes on film locations, permits, when to shoot, unique local stories, costs, tax incentives, crews, talent, equipment, communications, art department, studios, post facilities, visas and work permits for filming, transport, film-friendly accommodation, and safety advice.\n\nCuba Film Locations\n\nCuba’s rich cultural and architectural heritage, pristine beaches, verdant hills, lush rainforests, and rural locations have seen visiting productions choosing Cuba since the earliest days of filming.\n\nAgricultural film locations include coffee, cocoa, sugarcane, and tobacco plantations. Cuba is also known for its nickel mines.\n\nPre-revolution, Cuba hosted films including Our Man in Havana (1958). Since the revolution, talented international and local directors shot films such as Buena Vista Social Club (1999), and Strawberry and Chocolate (1994). More recent US films shot in Cuba include Nyad (2023), The Fate of the Furious (2017), and Transformers: The Last Knight (2017).\n\nFrom west to east, film locations can be divided into the following provinces:\n\nLa Habana\n\nDilapidation and debauchery… Famed for its run down colonial looks, Cuba’s capital Havana is one of the most vibrant and visually arresting cities in the world.\n\nOne of Havana’s best locations is the Malecon, an esplanade stretching along the Havana coast where you can stop to watch 1950′s American Buicks and old Soviet Ladas racing by, or listen to a local musician practice their art.\n\nHavana offers many unique locations.\n\nColonial locations of note include the Capitolio Nacional, Neo-classical Hotel Inglaterra, Havana Stock Exchange, Great Theatre of Havana, Fine Arts Museum, Revolution Museum, University of Havana, crumbling mansions, and beautiful town squares such as Plaza de la Catedral and Plaza de Armas.\n\n1950’s American gangster era buildings of interest include the Melia Cohiba, Hotel Riviera, Habana Libre, and Fosca building.\n\nPost-Revolution locations of interest include Revolution Square and the National Theater of Cuba.\n\nAs well as unique locations Cuba also attracts many productions that double Cuba for a range of international looks. Havana has an interesting Chinatown and a new Russian Orthodox Cathedral.\n\nJust outside of Havana you can find tropical forests, rivers, rural roads, plantations, and white sand beaches with turquoise water such as can be found at Playa del Este, a 30min drive from Havana.\n\nPinar del Río\n\nThe most western province of Pinar del Rio is home to Viñales which is known for lush green tobacco fields, limestone cliffs and caves.

This less explored film location is home to the abandoned Presidio Modelo prison.\n\nMatanzas\n\nThe city of Matanzas is known for its poets, culture, and Afro-Cuban folklore. Film locations include Parque de la Libertad, Sauto Theater, Pharmaceutical Museum, Necropolis de San Carlos Borromeo, and Hershey Train Station.

The city is best known for its revolutionary landmarks including the Che Guevara Mausoleum.\n\nLooking north, the province is home to Cayo Iguana.\n\nSancti Spíritus\n\nThe southern city of Trinidad is a beautiful old Spanish-colonial city with a large Afro-Caribbean community. Outside of Trinidad, Playa Ancon is a nearby paradise beach, and Topes de Collantes is a nature reserve in the Escambray Mountains.\n\nLooking north, locations of note include Caguanes National Park, Cayos de la Herradura, Cayo Las Brujas, Cayo Ensenachos, and Cayo Martin.\n\nCiego de Ávila\n\nIn the north, Cayo Coco is a tropical island with white-sand beaches, coral reefs, and all-inclusive resorts.\n\nLooking south, you can find Cayo Bretón and Cayo Caballones.\n\nCamagüey\n\nThe city of Camagüey is the nation’s third largest.\n\nIn the north of the province paradise island locations include Jardines del Rey, Cayo Sabinal, Playa la Boca, and Playa Santa Lucia.\n\nLas Tunas\n\nFilm locations of note include La Llanita, Playa Manglito, and Playa la Herradura.\n\nGranma\n\nPlaya las Coloradas is located in this province.\n\nHolguín\n\nHolguín is known for its plazas, churches, colonial architecture, and beautiful beaches such as Playa Esmeralda and Playa Yuraguanal.\n\nSantiago de Cuba\n\nSantiago de Cuba is the second largest city. El Tivoli is the city’s old French quarter.

Firstly, the project needs to be authorised to film. Permission to film projects of a politically sensitive nature is generally not granted. Once the project is approved, general film permits for guerrilla style shoots take about two weeks to process. Depending on your locations, separate permits may be required from different government departments, which will affect permitting times. Larger shoots involving road closures, pyrotechnics or traffic control usually take up to three weeks to permit. Allow extra lead time for permitting locations outside of Havana. Please note, if you try to film without appropriate permits you may be arrested and have your gear seized. Productions with a light footprint can try to film as tourists but you run the risk. Please contact us for location specific information.\n\nAerial Filming. At present there are no commercial helicopters in Cuba. The closest option are in South Florida, The Bahamas or Grand Cayman. Helicopters coming from the US need to have a US Commerce License to fly to Cuba. There are only a few that have this. As such, this approach for aerial filming is quite expensive. The turn-around time for Cuban FAA and Military clearances of flight path is 30-days. Drone filming is a far less expensive approach for aerial shoots. Temporary import of drones is currently illegal to import. That said, there is a Phantom 3 and the Inspire drone currently in Cuba available for filming.\n\nWhen To Shoot?\n\nThe Cuban climate is mild and sub-topical with cool trade winds that temper the heat and humidity. The rainy season is from May to October. May and June are the wettest months whilst August and October is the hurricane season. November to April is the dry season marked by sunshine and puffy white clouds. This is the best time for Northern Hemisphere clients to film summer looks. For monthly weather statistics please see here.\n\nFor filmmakers looking for interesting events the Havana Jazz Festival takes place in February and Havana Carnaval takes place in July.\n\nMany Cubans are non-religious. Christianity is the largest religion so those holidays are observed.\n\nPublic holidays may affect timing, availability and costs. See here for public holiday dates in Cuba.\n\nUnique Local Stories\n\nBrands are looking for local stories that match their brand narrative. Our local teams are a great lead for sourcing those unique stories and characters.\n\nIf you are looking for stories for your next shoot, send us your brief and we will pitch you ideas.\n\nIf you have a unique story you would like to pitch to a brand anywhere in the world, pitch us your idea. We have well-established processes to ensure that your ideas are properly seen and protected.\n\nCosts & Tax Incentives\n\nCosts. Cuba is generally a cost competitive place to shoot. Depending on the shoot some key crew and equipment may need to be brought in, which will add to those costs. Our Cuban fixer / service producer will negotiate local deals and provide the appropriate level of production support to match every budget. As far as payment is concerned, most local service companies will have foreign bank accounts. Many visiting crews bring in cash. Up to US$5000 can be brought in undeclared.\n\nTax Incentives. There are no tax incentives for foreign commercials or films shooting in Cuba.\n\nFilm Crew & Talent\n\nCrews. Cuba has a small pool of local directors, directors of photography and stills photographers suitable for smaller projects such as b-roll work.\n\nMost key crew such as 1st ADs, grips, gaffers, camera department work at European standards, speak good English and do not need to be brought in from abroad. Depending on the project critical key crew may need to be brought in, such as stylists for a fashion photo shoot. It’s estimated the current depth of Cuban crews can handle around 3 large shoots.\n\nContact us if you are looking for a Havana based director, DP, photographer, videographer (cameraman / camera operator), camera assistant (focus puller), sound operator, grip, gaffer, stylist, hair and makeup, PA / runner, production driver, or any other film crew in Cuba.\n\nTalent day rates and buyouts are negotiable. No dedicated casting agencies. A local casting director covers this.\n\nSpanish is the official language.\n\nCuba has some of the most beautiful people in the world with a strong selection of Caucasian, Mulatto, and Afro-Caribbean looks. Some Chinese looks also exist. All other talent such as Nordic or Indian looks are best cast abroad. Unfortunately, most talent does not speak English. Cuba also has shortage of high-end models.\n\nCuba Film Equipment\n\nEquipment. Cuba has all of the standard equipment available locally including Alexas, Red Epic, grip and lighting packages. At present there are 2 local equipment houses. More specialised equipment can be easily brought in from Mexico or Europe.\n\nCuba is not an ATA carnet country. Our local producer deals with all customs clearance including arranging a government customs liaison to meet you at the airport. Temporary import of equipment documentation usually takes about a week to organise.\n\nLight footprint productions bringing in small handheld equipment might be able to get away with coming in as tourists, but there is always the risk of customs seizing your gear.\n\nCommunication. Internet is available in hotels but connection speeds are still very slow. Special fast internet access can be arranged by local producers for the purposes of web posted casting and scouting. Internet and international phone calls in Cuba are very expensive. 4G mobile internet is available as of 2019.\n\nCommunication is key. Our agility and global experience allows us to customise the right communications systems for every shoot.\n\nWeb posted casting, scouting, and videoconferencing.\n\nFor clients that are unable to attend set we offer a virtual video village solution. This dedicated and secure high-resolution video streaming platform allows clients from one or multiple timezones to view setups without compromise and to participate in real-time with the team on set. Separate systems can be set up for the discrete conversations that are required to make a job run right. Working remotely with our local teams reduces your content production costs, turnaround times, carbon footprint, and risks associated with unpredictable global events.\n\nArt Department, Studios, Backlots, & Post Production\n\nArt department is strong for local looks such as 1950’s Buicks. More modern looking props, dressing and wardrobe will need to be brought in from abroad. Set construction crews are hard working and talented.\n\nStudios and backlots. Local TV has some basic studios. No dedicated film backlots at present.\n\nVisas & Work Permits\n\nEntry is subject to regulations from country of origin. Work permits are required for visiting crew.\n\nThe process for permission to film from the Cuban side remains somewhat opaque.\n\nIf the project is not of a political nature, such as a TV commercial or travel show, the process is generally quick and easy. Our local state approved producer will require project information, flight details and a photocopy of your passport information page. They will lodge your application inside Cuba and the work permit approval will be handed to immigration officials awaiting your arrival. The process usually only takes a few days.\n\nIf you are planning to shoot a film or documentary of a politically sensitive nature, work permits can take months to process and are often rejected altogether.\n\nNote, if you try to enter Cuba as a tourist and are bringing apple boxes full of film gear, you will most likely be refused entry.\n\nThe laws from the US side regarding General Licences and Special Licences have changed. Professional media or artistic productions, including the filming or production of non-journalistic projects such as music videos or commercials, are now fully legal under US law.\n\nCrew intending to enter as tourists need to obtain a visa before travel or a tourist card from one of the Cuban diplomatic missions, travel agencies or authorized airlines, unless they come from one of the visa exempt countries. A tourist card grants a maximum stay of 30 days (90 days for Canadian citizens).\n\nTransport & Accommodation\n\nTransportation Infrastructure. Main roads are up to international standards and once on the highways the lack of cars means traffic moves quickly. Several international airlines service flights to Cuba. Direct commercial flights from the US to Cuba are now available.\n\nAccommodation. Top hotels in Cuba are not quite up to the standard the average client or director might expect.\n\nOur favourite place to stay in Havana is La Rosa de Ortega B&B. This grand old home, located in the once affluent neighbourhood of Vibora, offers a calm, friendly environment to base your team after a day of hectic Havana. Tell Julia you’re an Emerge Film Solutions client for a 10% discount or a special package rate if you’re planning to stay many days.\n\nIf you have a larger team and are looking to stay more centrally, some of the better known Havana hotels include:\n\nHotel Inglaterra\n\nHotel Sevilla\n\nHotel Nacional\n\nMelia Cohiba\n\nHotel Riviera Havana\n\nFinal Notes\n\nSafety. Cuba is a very safe place for foreign productions to visit. See here for up to date travel advice.\n\nDown Time. The unique culture and vibrant nightlife makes Cuba a country that clients love to return to.\n\nProjects. For an example of TV commercials, stills campaigns, online content, corporate videos, virtual reality 360 content, feature films, TV series and documentaries shot in Cuba, please see below:\n\nHire Cuba Production Support & Shooting Crew\n\nWhen choosing a service company there are several additional factors you will need to consider: What service company’s overseas bank account will it be easier to send payment to? Would my project be better off with a governmental service company or a non-governmental service company? What company is going to accept liability?\n\nIf you are looking for a film or photographic production service company, line producer or fixer for your shoot in Cuba, please contact us.\n\nIf you are looking for a shooting crew for your shoot in Cuba, such as a director, DoP, photographer, videographer (cameraman / camera operator), camera assistant (focus puller), sound operator, grip, gaffer, stylist, hair and makeup, PA / runner, production driver, please contact us.\n\nWe are able to provide you with answers, references and bids quickly."
