        "text": "THE majestic St. Peter the Apostle Church, looking down from high on a hill, is considered one of the architectural wonders of the city of Matanzas, in the western Cuban province of the same name.\n\nWith its recent designation as a National Monument, the Iglesia de San Pedro Ap�stol joins 17 other buildings in this category. The Xanadu mansion in the resort town of Varadero was also recently added, just last May.\n\nThe church can be seen from many points in the city, located 100 kilometers east of Havana on a large natural bay.\n\nIt was built in the Versalles neighborhood on the left bank of the Yumuri River, which, along with the San Juan and the Can�mar, criss-cross the city, known as the �Athens of Cuba� since the 19th century.\n\nAccording to figures from the era, by the mid 1800�s, the neighborhood had 380 houses and 2,800 residents, and was growing, which historians say motivated Bishop F�lix Solans to mandate the construction of a parish.\n\nThe plan was approved and authorities registered the property legally August 22, 1860, using the name San Pedro Ap�stol.\n\nDocumentary evidence indicates that thanks to a 100,000 peso donation made by Do�a Mar�a Josefa Santa Cruz de Oviedo y Hern�ndez, adequate funds were available to begin work. The church was to be constructed on land provided by Rosa Espinosa de Abreu, from the Sacred Heart of Jesus order. Adjoining land where four apartment buildings existed was also purchased to complete the site.\n\nItalian architect and project manager Daniel Dall Aglio was chosen to design the church. In 1863, he had completed another jewel in Matanzas, the Sauto Theater, conceived as very similar to Milan�s La Scala.\n\nA blessing was pronounced when the first stone was laid May 29, 1867 and the church opened three years later.\n\nPrensa Latina consulted several architects who agreed that the design of the baptistery is fluid, in perfect harmony with the large spaces recreated in a Greco-Latin style.\n\nDall Aglio�s design included triangular and semi-circular pediments, pilasters, Doric columns, arches, barrel vaults and cupola domes.\n\nAnother of its unique features is its great interior luminosity, given the carefully placed light openings on both sides of the central dome.\n\nTo the right of the main altar is a representation of Calvary Hill carved in wood, considered one of the most beautiful in Cuba. The central figure, Jesus on the cross, dates from the 18th century. After it was brought to Matanzas, the other figures were added: Mary, Mary Magdalene and the disciple John.\n\nSpecialists at the Monuments and Historical Sites Office announced that, following the distinction awarded the church, on the occasion of the 320th anniversary of Matanzas� founding this coming October, the city�s central historic district, including 950 buildings, will be declared a National Monument."
