        "text": "At most, the salon was a one minute walk from my casa. But about halfway there I could hear the faint sound of live drums beating out a rhythm completely unfamiliar to me. I was so intrigued that I decided to ditch my plan and follow my ears instead, down a side street to the weatherworn door of a nearby casa. As I stood there trying to peek through the cracks, I heard a voice call to me from across the street “Te gustaria entrar?” (Would you like to enter?). Pilar, as it turns out, was the owner of the casa and she was neither surprised nor offended at my nosiness. I hesitated for about three seconds while I recalled my son’s pre-trip advice to not follow strangers into their homes, but that sentiment was quickly overridden by my curiosity and I followed my new friend through her front door.\n\nIt was as though I was walking onto the set of an old war movie – crumbling stone walls, no roof, spare auto and appliance parts and miscellaneous rubble laying everywhere on the dirt floor. In the middle of all the decay were seven Cubanos sitting in a circle with congas, cajones (box drums) and other peculiar percussion instruments, playing and singing a genre of music unknown to me. This was my introduction to real street rumba in its raw and primal form. Rumba is a traditional form of Afro-Cuban music involving dancing, drumming and singing, the roots of which are believed to have originated in the streets of Matanzas and Havana. Without skipping a beat, the rumberos (rumba players) pulled up a chair for me, un-phased by the fact that I was a complete stranger, and I sat, listening and learning and appreciating being immersed in one of the most distinct elements of Cuban culture.\n\n30 minutes into the impromptu performance, it started to pour – not just outside but inside the house (did I mention it was May and the start of rainy season?). All instruments and people were moved in unison to the only room which had a roof, the single bedroom. But the rumba continued, and Pilar’s young son Kenny bounced around the bed hamming it up for my camera while the adults passed around a bottle of Havana Club Rum taking turns with a single shot glass. I did make an earlier attempt to leave when one of my hosts urged me to stay and wait out the deluge. At first I declined … after all, I am Canadian and we are a hearty bunch. With a shake of his head and a deep sigh, he gestured “OK, suit yourself” and opened the door. It was immediately apparent that I wasn’t going anywhere without a flotation device. The streets and sidewalks had completely disappeared and everything had been transformed into a fast-flowing river. Perfect for a white-water rafting expedition, but a walk home in flip-flops against the current? Not so much. Old leather shoes, cardboard boxes, bags of garbage, and other unidentifiable objects went rushing by as I stood there stranded and helpless. So I did the only thing possible under the circumstances – I re-joined the fiesta.\n\nI eventually returned to my casa looking like a drowned rat, absolutely soaking wet to my core. But I had a bit of a Havana Club buzz, a rumba CD in my pocket, and a shear sense of delight at being welcomed into the fold by the resident Rumba band.\n\nIn this place, you need to embrace the opportunity to create your own detour because sometimes, the best experiences are those which happen while we’re on our way to doing something else.\n\nYes – you heard me right.\n\nMe, the person who promotes getting as local as possible when traveling, who prefers non-touristy things, and who is likely one of very few Cuba junkies on the planet who couldn´t care less about chilling on the beach -- I´m showing some love to Varadero.\n\nNo, I’m not losing my marbles, and I’m not promoting all-inclusive resort-style travel (I grapple with sustainability issues on that front). But I am a little fired up, because I’ve had my fill of the snickers and jeers and sometimes downright mockery directed at Varadero fans, by those who claim that it’s somehow less-Cuban than other destinations. How can that be? It’s in Cuba!\n\nOne of the most important lessons I’ve learned after many trips off-the-beaten-path on this island is:\n\nAuthentic Cuba is NOT about location – it’s about ENGAGEMENT.\n\nTo be clear, I’m not saying Varadero isn’t full of tourists because that would be just…well…loony. But guess what? It’s also full of Cubans.\n\nThe truth is, Varadero is one of the best places to stay if you want to enjoy pretty much any aspect of Cuban culture, including those related to local everyday life. It can serve visitors well as a home base for their trip.\n\nFor starters, it’s a mere 25 minutes by car from Juan G. Gomez Airport, and even less if you’re staying at a casa in the town itself. If you like the countryside, travel 15 minutes south of the entrance to the peninsula and POOF! You’re in el campo. Rural Cuba is that close when you’re in Varadero. There’s nothing but acres of rustic farmland, horse-drawn carts, the odd baby goat bouncing about and a plethora of tiny villages to explore, like Cantel and Camarioca (not to be confused with Boca de Camarioca). The best part? You’ll be the only gringo there.\n\nWe don’t need to talk about how stunning the beach is – it’s Varadero; enough said. But what is worth mentioning is the fact that during the winter months when the resort beaches are crowded, the section in town near the end of Calle 43 is practically deserted. In other words, if you’re staying at a casa particular, you’ll be close (or even on) a far-less populated slice of paradise. Even if you’re staying at a resort, you don’t need to go far to get away from the crowds and still be on one of the best beaches in the world. And if you go during June, July or August, it will be packed with local families enjoying their summer vacations. How is that not ‘real Cuba’?\n\nIf you love nature, you can snorkel just a little bit further west at Playa Coral, or check out the caves at Bellamar (sometimes touristy, but always totally worth it). For die-hard hikers, the incredible Yumuri Valley is just up the Via Blanca on the north edge of Matanzas, where you can try your luck at reaching the summit of Loma del Pan. It’s not for the faint of heart, but the tranquility and the views of the valley on the way up are un-be-lievable. Skip the jeep tour and arrange for your own transportation, or take a private tour so that you can enjoy the drive and explore the quaint little villages that dot the valley on your own terms.\n\nIs it nightlife you’re after? Varadero is chock-full of great restaurants and bars with live music and dancing, like Calle 62 or Casa de la Musica for example. And guess what? There’s no shortage of both tourists and locals patronizing those places. In fact, when my Cuban friends want a crazy night out, the strip in Varadero is often the destination of choice. Dancing, socializing and la fiesta has been an integral part of their culture forever — it doesn’t get more authentic than that.\n\nAre you an arts and culture buff? No hay problema. You can attend performances by Ballet Nacional de Cuba as well as Lizt Alfonso Dance Cuba on a day trip to Havana (or in nearby Matanzas, once renovations at Sauto Theatre are complete). And there’s no denying that the talent performing at some of the resorts is spectacular in their own right. Rumba and Santeria can be experienced all over the island but they’re prevalent in Matanzas and the surrounding area (i.e. all around Varadero) because, as some people believe, that part of Cuban culture originated there. If museums are your thing, take a short side-trip to the city of Cárdenas where you can visit Museo Oscar María de Rojas, one of the most interesting I’ve ever been to.\n\nIf I keep going, this list will be three miles long. My point is, ALL of the things I’ve mentioned are no less real or authentically Cuban than those you can experience in a non-resort area. And they’re all accessible if you’re staying in Varadero – that’s what makes it a super cool place to use as a home base. Travelers can enjoy one of Cuba’s most stunning beaches, with so many of the other goodies practically within arm’s reach.\n\nVaradero isn’t just a stretch of land filled with all-inclusive hotels…it’s also a town full of Cuban people living, working, shopping and spending time with friends and family. At the very least, tapping into a local vibe here can be as simple as having an engaging conversation with the bartender serving your mojitos, or the person cleaning your room. It’s possible you could end up with a glimpse of everyday Cuban life without ever stepping off the property, although I highly recommend doing so. When it comes down to it, meaningful interaction is what counts — not your address.\n\nThose who swear by the mantra “Varadero isn’t real Cuba” should think again, because authentic Cuba is anywhere the locals are. And there are plenty of them in Varadero, which makes it a perfectly acceptable choice as a home base for visitors to Cuba.\n\nHey — now there’s an idea for a nickname…Base Camp Varadero.\n\nYep, I like it.\n\nMatanzas is a gritty city, steeped in culture but just far enough off the beaten path that it can seem completely devoid of tourists much of the time, especially outside of the downtown.\n\nI spend a lot of time there when I’m in Cuba and I know the area reasonably well. It was the first place I landed for my initial solo trip, and Matanceros were the first group of locals that I interacted with -- I suppose that makes it the most memorable by default. But with a few years and loads of experiences now under my belt, I know there’s much more to it than that.\n\nWhich begs the question – why do I scratch my head whenever someone asks me to recommend a list of things to do and see there? The truth is, the most interesting and moving experiences happen when and where we least expect them to.\n\nAccording to Trip Advisor and Airbnb Experiences, there are a lot of boxes to check on the list of interesting tourist sites in Matanzas. Some of those include Las Cuevas de Bellamar, one of the best examples of Cuba’s massive cave system complete with some very impressive stalactites and stalagmites, and Museo Farmacéutico, the beautifully preserved 19th century French Pharmacy in the centre of the city. Another interesting site is Castillo de San Severino, a fort built in 1735 on the Bay of Matanzas which also serves as a museum for both the history of slavery and Santeria (a personal favorite of mine which is usually deserted).\n\nThose are certainly some of the worthwhile highlights of the city, especially for people with limited time and an agenda to keep. But if you’re fortunate enough to be able to linger for a while – a few days or maybe longer – and you want my honest opinion on the best way to experience Matanzas, I would simply tell you this:\n\nKeep it simple. Meander through the streets and talk to people. Look, listen and engage.\n\nBecause what’s really special about Matanzas isn’t something you’ll find on a menu of points of interest promoted by a tour company, or written about in a review on a booking website.\n\nThere’s a special vibe there. It’s everywhere – in the streets, in people’s homes, in the markets and cantinas – and if you’re moving too fast because you’re focused on completing all of the items in your itinerary, you’ll miss it.\n\nYou’ll miss the inherent AfroCuban elements -- not those on display at the museum, but those happening all around you in the neighborhoods you’ll pass through on your way there. For example, at Rumba Park in La Marina, a little triangle-shaped, tree-covered patch of concrete at the junction of Calles Manzano, Matanzas and 278, it’s common to see street performances by local rumba groups such as Los Muñequitos de Matanzas or Grupo AfroCuba de Matanzas. And travelers can also miss the fact that if they listen carefully, they can often hear conga or batá drums beating somewhere in the distance, signifying either a toque (a Cuban version of a jam session) or perhaps even a Santeria ceremony taking place in the vicinity. If you happen to encounter one of these while you’re exploring the city, don’t be afraid to stop and observe.\n\nThere’s also a vibrant street market scene -- almost every neighborhood has one early on Saturday and Sunday mornings, with extra-large markets located next to Estadio Victoria de Giron baseball stadium (meat, cheese and fresh produce vendors) and Playa Tenis (same items, but on a smaller scale). These are all great places to people-watch and engage with everyday life in Cuba.\n\nFor me, the most indelible memories have been forged during very casual and unplanned events, such as the rumba practice session at a private casa which I discovered while taking street photos (they saw me standing at the doorway with camera-in-hand and invited me to sit in). On another occasion, while exploring the area around the Hershey Station, my friend and I were invited to step into a unique little stone fabricating shop owned by a local named Armando, a business which has been in his family for generations. There have also been numerous times when I’ve been invited to indulge in whatever a local family might be cooking for dinner over an open fire in the street, such as a bowl of steamy caldoza (stew), or my favorite – chicharrones (delicious little chunks of deep-fried pork belly).\n\nThose are the types of experiences that sear themselves into your psyche — the ones that connect you with local people living their everyday lives, and ultimately connecting you to the real soul of a place. You won’t find locations, dates and times for those adventures in any guidebook.\n\nSo, to anyone inquiring about the best way to spend time in Matanzas, my answer is this:\n\nIf you have an agenda, use it loosely as a guideline and be flexible, allowing yourself to get side-tracked by the sounds and aromas and conversations happening around you.\n\nIf you don’t have an agenda and you prefer to let things unfold organically, you and I are on the same page, and you probably don’t need any advice.\n\nEither way, as long as you take your time and have an open mind, following your instincts and your senses, you should have no trouble tapping into the special heart and soul of the city of Matanzas.\n\nYou can view the valley from above from several different points including El Mirador, the snack bar on the west side of the Bacunayagua Bridge, and Iglesia de Monserrate, the church on top of the cliff overlooking the city of Matanzas. But to really discover the true beauty of what lies within, you’ll want to get right down into it and meander through the countryside and the tiny villages. The Hershey train runs through the Valley from Matanzas to Havana and you may have time to take a few photos as it makes its scheduled stops (especially if the train breaks down, which is a distinct possibility) but you’ll be at the mercy of the train schedule. Your best bet is to hire a taxi to take you through at your own pace and if you split the cost with a friend, you can probably do this for under 50CUC each, for a few hours of exploring. I was lucky enough to have my amigo Jorge Felix, a local photographer who's passionate about showing Cuban life through his lens, accompany me. Not only was he a wonderful guide but he offered tips on how to take better photos as well.\n\nThe highlight of our drive was stopping at Casa Ophelia – a sprawling ranch on a lovely large property which included a small lake complete with grazing cows, and piglets and chickens running amuck. Her yard was littered with old appliance and car parts, miscellaneous construction material and an old rusty jeep, which I’m certain will be put back into commission someday. Ophelia is the matriarch of the family and the original owner of the home where she lives with her son and grandson. After some gentle coaxing and a dose of Jorge’s charm, she felt comfortable enough to allow us to take photos and to share a few stories about her rural life. Even though Cubans are known for their openness and willingness to share, it's still such a privilege to be allowed into their personal space and to record what we find there.\n\nNearing the end of our drive, we made a stop at a little souvenir stand and “typical Cuban ranch”, as described by the State-run tour companies promoting Yumuri Valley jeep excursions. We had the place to ourselves (the bonus of doing your own thing off the tourist trail), so we had time to chat with the locals working there about life and business in the valley. I had my first taste of Piña de Raton, a delicious type of mini-pineapple, and had just enough time to chase it down with a glass of guarapa con ron (sugar cane juice with rum) when we heard engines in the distance. It was the sound of the jeep caravan ten or twelve vehicles long, carrying a throng of sunburnt tourists to their last stop after a marathon day of boating, snorkelling and horseback riding. That was our queue to make our exit.\n\nThe Yumuri Valley may not have any of the mogotes (unique, steep-sided hill formations) which draw so many travelers to Viñales, arguably the most famous valley on the island. But Yumuri possesses its own indelible charm -- winding roads (some no more than a dirt path), quaint villages, sprawling pineapple fields, guajiros riding their horses and carts, and tons of shades of green in every direction. A much slower pace than that of the city, it’s peaceful and serene, and definitely worth taking a private tour to observe life in the Valley and experience real tranquility.\n\nWhile there are many lessons from daily Cuban life which may serve us well (ie their coffee-brewing expertise or the ingenuity with which they re-use and recycle items we would normally throw in the trash), their ability to exercise the patience required to stand in very long lineups has been perfected into an art form. I’m not talking about waiting ten minutes behind five people for a fresh omelet at the buffet. I’m talking about really long lineups waiting for ordinary things that we take for granted, like buying a block of cheese or hopping on a bus or buying a SIM card for a cell phone. These are often epic endeavors for the average Cuban, requiring a mountain of both time and fortitude. For example, on a recent trip to the bank in downtown Matanzas, I was told by the crowd of locals gathered on the sidewalk that the power had gone out (a regular occurance) and they had closed the doors until it could be restored. I waited there for over 30 minutes under the blistering sun -- sweat literally coursing like a river from my neck to my belly button -- until the doors opened again. It was another 30 minutes before I was allowed to take care of my business with the teller. But this is normal everyday stuff for a Cuban.\n\nSo I was ready to pounce on the guy standing behind me as I waited to pass through Customs in Toronto after a recent return flight from Cuba. Stressing about the 200 people in line, he could not stop complaining. “Ya know, the airport and the damn government just don’t care about people anymore. Don’t they realize everyone is just tired and we want to go home? Why do we have to wait in such a long lineup to deal with a crappy machine instead of a live person? This is just f***ing ridiculous!” The interesting thing is, it only took about 15 minutes to get from the end of that line all the way to the baggage claim. 15 MINUTES!! The kiosks they’ve installed to scan passports and print customs cards have sped up the process significantly, making it all remarkably efficient. One is hard-pressed to use that adjective – efficient -- to describe anything in Cuba.\n\nFor a quick second I felt compelled to turn around and say “Hey buddy, you just came from a place where people wait in line for an hour behind six people at the bank, and there's a guard at the door telling them when to enter, where to sit, and when they are allowed to approach the counter. And because almost nobody can afford their own wheels, they wait at the bus stop with 200 other locals prepared to pack themselves like sardines into an already jammed, stinky, stuffy, dirty bus in order to get to their unairconditioned office or school. I didn’t hear any of those people complain. Please sir, recognize how fortunate you are to have the freedom to travel at will in the first place, and then do everyone a favor and shut your pie-hole.”\n\nBut no. Instead, I remained tranquila like a Cubana who knows there are things in life that we simply can’t change, such as the lineup at airport customs or the bad attitude other people have as a result of their ignorance. We can, however, improve upon some of our own personal deficits by observing other cultures and people who happen to be better at certain things than we are. Cubans are better at patience, hands down."
