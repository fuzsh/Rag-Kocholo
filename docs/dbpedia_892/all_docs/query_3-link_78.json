        "text": "Renowned American a Capella music group Take 6 will perform in Havana in late September as part of a music festival called Les voix humaines (Human Voices), organized and sponsored by Cuban maestro, Leo Brouwer. The concert will be held in Havana’s Karl Marx Theater on September 26th as part of a festival that will gather in the Cuban capital important figures of the world’s music scene, including Portuguese singer Dulce Pontes, Spainish Mayte Martín, and other singers and performers who have cultivated the classical and popular music repertoire.\n\nFamous Cuban actor and filmmaker Jorge Perugorría confessed AIN news service that to perform Mario Conde, the most famous detective of Cuban literature is quite a challenge. The actor advanced that the cinematographic adaptation of Vientos de Cuaresma, detective novel form Cuban writer Leonardo Padura—directed by Spanish Félix Viscarret—is almost concluding the shooting cycle.\n\nThe U.S. press described maestro Frank Fernández as a virtuoso with complete command of the piano and a great power of communication, after his performance at the famous Ravinia Festival, in Chicago. John Von Rhein, the city’s most important music critic, praised the concert repertory, noting the musicians “grounding in both the standard classical repertory and in Cuban and Latin American vernacular music.”\n\nMiguel Matamoros was born on May 8, 1894 and died on April 15, 1971. 2015 marks the 90th anniversary of the founding of the famous Trío Matamoros, precisely on Miguel’s birthday in 1925. In the late 1960s, I was invited by some friends who studied music to the Santiago de Cuba carnival. These students of the National School of Arts (ENA) in Havana took me to the home where the giant of son, Miguel Matamoros, spent his final years.\n\nWhen one hears about the Judo Hall of Fame, they discover, among other things that only 30 great figures in the history of the sport have achieved such a distinction. This detail demonstrates how difficult it is to be included in the select group, to which Cuba’s Driulis González was inducted last Saturday, August 22.\n\nThe 4th Scientific Meeting on the 19th-century Cuban Theaters, will be held from September 7 to 9, at Sauto theater, located in Western Matanzas.\n\nThis event, which joins every two years researchers and directors from cultural institutions in this Coliseum, National Monument, will foster this time the dialogue about preservation works, programming and contemporary audience studies.\n\nJazz player Wynton Marsalis will launch an album that includes themes of his three live concerts at Mella Theater in October 2010, as reported to the NBC. Live in Cuba deals with the deep connections with American jazz and Afro-Cuban music “from bebop to bolero, and much beyond that”.\n\nFamous pianists Lang Lang, of China, and Cuban Chucho Valdés, will share an outdoor concert in this capital on October 9, confirmed recently one of the organizers of the event. The New York Times describes Lang as the best classic artist in the planet, while Time magazine included him among the most influential 100 people in the world.\n\nEVERY year the Art on the Rampa formula is gradually perfected, combining families’ needs for homewears and personal items with a broad cultural program over the summer months. The Fair, held in the Pabellón Cuba, located on La Rampa, a busy zone in Havana’s Vedado neighborhood, has become one of the city’s most popular attractions.\n\nOnly on the Malecón, where the sea breeze which lords over Havana is best enjoyed, is it possible to withstand the scorching heat of the tantalizing conga music, queen of carnival, the largest mass celebration of the year. Over these hot August weekends (7-9 and 14-16), Havana residents are enjoying the city’s traditional carnival celebrations; some simply reclining on the Malecón, while others sit in the bleachers, expectantly awaiting the dance troupes as they parade past the judges, while the most eager seek out the designated dance areas."
