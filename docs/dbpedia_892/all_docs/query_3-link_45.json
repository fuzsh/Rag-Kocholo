        "text": "The Canímar River is, in terms of flow and length, the main river of the province of Matanzas, Cuba. It is located 8 km from the capital and it is possible to sail 12 of its 19 km by a boat ride.\n\nThe Canímar River Tourist Park, one of the many options of the ecotourism modality that Cuba offers for foreign and national vacationers, is the most efficient and most comfortable installation of Popular Campismo in the province of Matanzas. It is an attractive place located only 27 kilometers from Varadero, the main tourist pole of the beach and sun of the Caribbean island.\n\nThe Canimar is considered among the most important archaeological sites of Matanzas, a province populated millennia ago by aboriginal communities at different levels of development. In Canímar, 31 aboriginal settlements have been reported."
