The colonial charm of the architecture of the city of Matanzas will not leave indifferent even the most experienced traveler! \"Murder\" or \"slaughterhouse\" - this is how it is translated from the Spanish Matanzas.

However, despite its name, the province of Matanzas (the Spanish word Matanzas), famous for its beautiful nature and the charm of the African past, has an impeccable reputation among the most demanding tourists. Since the XIX century, the province has become an important enclave of the national economy, thanks to the enormous tourism potential and achievements of the agricultural sector. The city of Matanzas is also called the \"city of bridges\", there are 17. The rivers flow through the whole city. In the province with the same name is the highest bridge on the Island - the Bakunayaga Bridge. Its height is 110 meters. From the bridge, you can see the landscapes of the Yumuri valley.
