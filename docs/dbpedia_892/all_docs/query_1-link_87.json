Thus, from the sound of drums, the rumba was born in Matanzas, the first national dance of Cuba. Nowadays it is still a very popular dance there. The Rumbero Festival takes place annually in the Sauto Theater, in the capital city of the province, and is one of the most important shows in Matanzas.\n\nThe jewel of Matanzas is the sparkling city of Varadero, with its endless beaches, grandiose resorts and luxurious lifestyle.

It has decadent but charming Neoclassical-style Colonial buildings. Catholic churches, a theater and several museums are some examples of these types of constructions.\n\nThe Ciénaga de Zapata Swamp is the perfect place for adventurers, as it is an almost unexplored wetland covered by lush vegetation, and an array of birds and other interesting animals.\n\nFrom a cultural point of view, Matanzas is one of the richest areas of Cuba. It houses many museums that will teach you all about various topics, so you shouldn’t miss out on your chance to visit them. An example of this is the Pharmaceutical Museum Pharmaceutical Museum, unique on its type in all America, the Provincial Historic Museum, and the heart-rending Slave Route Museum.\n\nHistorically, Matanzas was a main point in the defense of the island during the Cuban Revolution, as in Playa Girón Beach, in the south coast of the province, took place the first of many defeats suffered by North American army at the hands of the Cuban people. The region had been attacked several times before, so it was well equipped to face what was coming, and very quickly organized its counter-attack. If you visit the province of Matanzas, take advantage of your chance to visit one of the museums related to war and the Revolution."
