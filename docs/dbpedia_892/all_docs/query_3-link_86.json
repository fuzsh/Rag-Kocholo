        "text": "For other uses, see Matanzas (disambiguation).\n\nMatanzas is the capital of the Cuban province of Matanzas. It is famed for its poets, culture, and Afro-Cuban folklore.\n\nIt is located on the northern shore of the island of Cuba, on the Bay of Matanzas (Spanish Bahia de Matanzas), 90 kilometres (56 mi) east of the capital Havana and 32 kilometres (20 mi) west of the resort town of Varadero.\n\nMatanzas is called the \"City of Bridges,\" of which there are seventeen crossing the three rivers that traverse the city (Rio Yumuri, San Juan, and Canimar). For this reason it was referred to as the \"Venice of Cuba.\" It was also called \"La Atenas de Cuba\" (\"The Athens of Cuba\") for its poets.\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n\n1.1 Name origin\n\n2 Geography\n\n2.1 Wajay\n\n3 Infrastructure\n\n4 Attractions\n\n5 Demographics\n\n5.1 Notable residents\n\n6 Further reading\n\n7 References\n\n8 External links\n\nHistory\n\nMatanzas was founded in 1693 as San Carlos y San Severino de Matanzas.[1] This followed a royal decree (\"real cédula\") issued on September 25, 1690 which decreed that the bay and port of Matanzas be settled by 30 families from the Canary Islands.[4]\n\nMatanzas was one of the regions that saw intensive development of sugar plantations during the colonial era. Consequently, many African slaves were imported to support the sugar industry, particularly during the first half of the nineteenth century. For example, in 1792 there were 1900 slaves in Matanzas, roughly 30% of its population. In 1817, the slave population of Matanzas had grown to 10,773, comprising nearly 50% of the overall population. By 1841, 53,331 slaves made up 62.7% of the population of Matanzas.[5] Census figures for 1859 put the Matanzas slave population at 104,519.[5] Matanzas was the site of several slave insurrections and plots, including the infamous Escalera conspiracy (discovered in late 1843). Due to the high number of both slaves and, importantly, free Afro-Cubans in Matanzas, the retention of African traditions is especially strong there. In 1898, Matanzas became the location of the first action in the Spanish/American War. The city was bombarded by American Navy vessels on April 25, 1898, just after the beginning of the war.\n\nName origin\n\nThe name Matanzas means \"massacre\" and refers to a putative slaughter at the port of the same name in which 30 Spanish soldiers were crossing one of the rivers to attack an aboriginal camp on the far shore. The Spanish soldiers didn't have any boats, so they enlisted the help of some native fishermen. However, once they reached the middle of the river, the fishermen flipped the boats, and due to the Spanish soldiers' heavy metal armor, most of them drowned.[6] Only two women—one said to be the beautiful María de Estrada—survived, the result of being \"taken\" by a Cacique. De Estrada is said to have later escaped the \"power of the Cacique\" and married Pedro Sánchez Farfán in the city of Trinidad. From 1900 to the 1950s Portuguese descendents moved to Cuba because of the hard times and they planted themselves in Matanzas to live build their families. Because of this change to Cuba's atmosphere, the town changed and people spoke Portuguese and Spanish, some not all, but that was the way of the town and to this day it is still strong.\n\nGeography\n\nThe city is located on the north shore of the island of Cuba, on all three sides of the Bay of Matanzas. The bay cuts deep in the island, and three rivers flow in the bay inside city limits (Rio Yumuri, San Juan, and Canimar). To the south-east, the landscape rises into a hill called Pan de Matanzas, divided from the Atlantic coast by the Yumuri Valley and a coastal ridge.\n\nThe city of Matanzas is divided into three neighborhoods: Versalles, Matanzas, and Pueblo Nuevo. The municipality is divided into the barrios of Bachicha, Bailén, Barracones, Bellamar, Camarioca, Cárcel, Ceiba Mocha, Colón, Corral Nuevo, Guanábana, Ojo de Agua, Refugio, San Luis, San Severino, Simpson y Monserrate, Versalles and Yumurí.[1]\n\nWajay\n\nWajay is a municipality in Matanzas. In 1954, the Asociación de Scouts de Cuba held its third national Jamboree in Wajay, celebrating the 40th anniversary of Scouting in Cuba.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nTransportation\n\nMatanzas is served by Juan Gualberto Gómez Airport, 15 km east of the city.\n\nThe city has two railway stations. The main station is on the main line from Havana to Santiago de Cuba. The electrified Hershey train operates by a different route to Havana from a separate station in the barrio of Versalles.\n\nMatanzas is also served by Viazul and Astro buses.\n\nThe Via Blanca highway connects the city with both Havana in the west and Varadero in the east.\n\nEducation\n\nThe University of Matanzas is the province's secondary education institution.\n\nAttractions\n\nPharmaceutical Museum - established in 1882\n\nMuseo Historico Provincial de Matanzas - Provincial History Museum\n\nSauto Theater - Teatro Sauto - Opened in 1863, the theatre hosts plays, opera, ballet, and symphonic concerts.
