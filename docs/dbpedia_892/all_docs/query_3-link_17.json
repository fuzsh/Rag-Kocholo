        "text": "Matanzas is known as the City of Bridges, located between Varadero and Havana. Whilst many people visit the bay and the harbour, the main city is less famous, which is a shame because there is so much more to this city to be explored. And in this article, we are going to tell you exactly why Matanzas should be added to your travel itinerary in Cuba.\n\nThe history of Matanzas\n\nLike much of Cuba, Matanzas is no different when it comes to its rich history and culture. It was officially founded all the way back in 1693 but was actually used for much longer than that by the Spanish in 1508 and even used as a base for pirates during that time too. In 1860, Matanzas was officially named the second city of Cuba, but it was a slow growth due to the sugarcane industry expanding into the eastern part of the island.\n\nIt was often referred to as ‘the Athens of Cuba’ thanks to its active cultural institutions and because so many artists and scholars working there. With so much history, you can expect scenic drives, beautiful plazas, monuments, historic buildings and more. Highlights, such as the 17th-century San Severino Castle and the 1730’s San Carlos Cathedral, make it worth the trip.\n\nFor hundreds of years, Matanzas has been one of the leading ports for sugar and henequen fibres, trading everything from rayon, rope, fertilisers, matches and even shoes.\n\nSo, history lesson is over; now, let’s discover what there is to see and do in Matanzas today.\n\nThings to do and see\n\nThere is so much to do from beaches, bays, rivers, parks and bridges; here are some of the most popular things to do in Matanzas.\n\nLibertad Square\n\nSoak up the Cuban atmosphere from this stunning square filled with charming buildings such as the Velasco Theatre, the Spanish Casino and the Pharmaceutical Museum. There is a large statue in the centre of the square of a woman raising her arms with broken chains shouting ‘freedom.’ Standing tall behind her is the founder of the Cuban Revolutionary Party, Jose Marti. So not only is it a peaceful and stunning spot to relax, but it’s full of cultural relevance too.\n\nSan Severino Castle\n\nIf you love castles, you must add this one to your list immediately. It’s absolutely brimming with history since being built in 1735. Wander through the 16th, and 17th Italian and French Renaissance patterned rooms. It has been said to be Cuba’s most important building, as it was designed to be the city’s primary defence point. It has been many things over the years, from a prison for Cuban Rebels until the 70’s to a museum which is still is today.\n\nPlaza de la Vigia\n\nFull of beautiful colours and designs, spend an afternoon here soaking up the sights and sipping Cuban coffee. Translating as ‘look-out’ place,’ due to the threat of pirates and smugglers. This is a great historical square to explore during your visit. Built in the late 17th century, you can explore the incredible historical buildings that are still standing tall today.\n\nSauto Theater\n\nExplore the mystery that surrounds the impressive Sauto Theater. It has been there since 1863 and was restored in 2011. Explore the magnificent ballroom and neoclassical style as well as the Greek marble statues, frescos and muses throughout the building. Some of the most fantastic performers of all time have performed here, such as Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova.\n\nConcordia Bridge\n\nThe Puente de la Concordia is an elegant bridge built all the way back in 1878 to connect downtown Matanzas and the neighbouring Versailles. The impressive architecture has stood the test of time thanks to its remarkable metal structure.\n\nCanimar River\n\nYou can sit and enjoy the views or take to the waters for a swim or snorkel in the stunning caves. You can even enjoy a horse riding session to explore the 77 species of birds and vibrant Caribbean vegetation. The most popular thing to do is explore this 19-kilometre kale by boat as you enjoy the foggy mystery surrounding you.\n\nThe Bellamar Caves\n\nThis is Cuba’s oldest tourist attraction and is approximately 300,000 years old. There are 25000 metres of caves to explore with stalagmites, an underground stream and the walls all glittering with crystals.\n\nSaturno Cave\n\nHailed as one of the most beautiful caves in Cuba. You can spend the day swimming or snorkelling in one of the most spectacular natural wonders. You can explore the fascinating rock formations; in fact, it got its name from the ring formations that resemble the planet. Spend the day exploring the freshwater lakes, but make sure you bring a head torch to see the most fascinating formations.\n\nBeaches to explore in Matanzas\n\nThere are so many stunning beaches near Matanzas, so if it’s sun, sea and sand you’re after, you’re heading to the perfect place.\n\nPlaya Coral Varadero Beach\n\nHere you can take to the stunning waters and go beneath the surface to explore the vivid corals and magnificent marine life. The best part of this beach location is that it’s a lot quieter than other beaches in Cuba. So you get the best of the beaches with less of crowds.\n\nBuey Vaca Beach\n\nWhilst this beach is on the outskirts; it’s still incredibly accessible from the centre of Matanzas. A lot quieter than some of the other beaches in Cuba, you can enjoy some of the most stunning stretches of sand imaginable.\n\nWhere to eat and drink\n\nIf dining is at the forefront of your mind when it comes to travel, you won’t be disappointed with a stay in Matanzas. Here are some of the city’s best eateries to tuck into Cuban delights.\n\nEl Chiquirrin\n\nEnjoy pizzas, pasta and chateaubriand from this charming bay-facing restaurant. You can enjoy the sounds of the pianist on the grand piano as you watch chefs fire up the dishes from behind their glass partition.\n\nAmelia del Mar\n\nCreativity is on the menu, with the most elegant presentation. The restaurant is also a lively bar venue.\n\nRestaurant-Galeria Esa Talla\n\nLocated amongst trendy bars and galleries, you can enjoy meat skewers, quesadillas and pizzas. The unique setting makes it a favourite for locals and tourists alike.\n\nLa Fettuccine\n\nSmall and cosy this restaurant only has three tables. That’s right, just three. This means you are in for exceptional hospitality while dining on Italian treats.\n\nNightlife in Matanzas\n\nWhilst Matanzas may not have the liveliest of nightlife; you can enjoy a more chilled-out party scene. Tropical Matanzas is a Tropicana cabaret experience on the outskirts of the city. You can enjoy nightly performances with dancers and live music.\n\nThe Hersey Train\n\nIf you’re visiting Matanzas, you must visit the Hersey Railway, the only surviving electric railway in the whole of Cuba. Connecting Matanzas and Havana, this railway was the brainchild of the famous US chocolatiers. Take a ride and explore the colourful village homes, the lush greenery, and the most specular farmland views. It’s not to be missed.\n\nLove Cuba is the UK’s #1 Cuba holiday specialist."
