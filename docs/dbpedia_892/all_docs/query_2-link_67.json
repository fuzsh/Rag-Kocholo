        "text": "Matanzas, the so-called Venice of America, located about 100 kilometers east of Havana, is an attractive destination where you can see the restorative and constructive actions that enhance its attributes.\n\nAlso called City of Bridges or Athens of Cuba, it has multiple epithets that add up to 20, due to its singular beauty, accentuated by the natural landscapes and the sea of its bay with a turquoise blue touch, together with its architecture of neoclassical predominance, its lodgings and extra-hotel offers.\n\nThe main places of interest are the Plaza de La Vigía, the Calle de Medio and the Sauto Theater, the Parque de La Libertad, as well as the centennial Lacret Morlot bridge over the Yumurí River.\n\nIn Matanzas there is a strategy to take advantage of the geographical advantages of the city, located between the tourist poles of Varadero and Havana, hence the increase in hotel accommodation capacity.\n\nFacing the main square, the Velasco Hotel is only 50 meters from the famous Sauto Theater and a few steps away from Matanzas Bay and numerous bars and restaurants.\n\nLikewise, the Tropicana de Matanzas cabaret is another attraction, without forgetting the Narváez river promenade, the Bellamar Caves and the Montserrate Hermitage, whose bell tower invites you to watch the scenery.
