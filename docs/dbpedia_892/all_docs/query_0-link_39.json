        "meta_description": "Designated as a national monument, Teatro Sauto has become synonymous with Matanzas' art scene. This stunning Neo-classical edifice is adorned with beautiful statues of Greek Goddesses made in Carrara marble. Other notable features of this majestic theater are its wood-paneled interiors, paintings of muses throughout the main hall and its original curtain which bears a painting of Puente de la Concordia. Since it opened its doors in 1863, this splendid theater has been regarded as one of the finest 19th century buildings in the country. Teatro Sauto has been testimony to performances by international stalwarts like Sarah Bernhardt, Anna Pavlova, Jose White Lafitte, Enrico Caruso and Andres Segovia. It has served the local and international arts scene by being a thriving center for theatrical performances, concerts, operas, ballets, and continues to do so. This 775-seater theater also doubles up as a ballroom at times. If you are a connoisseur of art, then a visit to this monument dedicated to art is a must.",
