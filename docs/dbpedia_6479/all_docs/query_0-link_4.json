        "text": "For transportation, we recommend renting a car from Haneda Airport and taking the Kan-Etsu Expressway to the Jōshin-etsu Expressway, exiting at Usui Karuizawa IC. This route takes approximately 2 hours to reach Karuizawa.\n\nYou can book your car rental online in advance here. Upon arrival at Haneda Airport's international arrivals area on the first floor, go to the counter in the middle to complete the paperwork. Make sure to have your international driver's permit and your passport.\n\nAlternatively, you can take the Hokuriku Shinkansen from Tokyo Station to Karuizawa, which only takes 70 minutes.\n\nOur first stop upon arriving in Karuizawa was Shiraito Falls, located to the north of Old Karuizawa. A leisurely 5-minute walk from the parking area along a trail reveals the gentle flow of the Chikuma River. As you follow its source, you'll be greeted by Shiraito Falls. It descends from a 70-meter-wide rock wall, resembling delicate strands of silk, surrounded by trees that display different seasonal charms. What sets it apart from typical river waterfalls is its soft and delicate appearance, exuding a sense of gentle tranquility. The staff from the Karuizawa Tourism Association explained that even in the harsh winter, Shiraito Falls doesn't freeze because it is fed by underground water from Mount Asama, maintaining a constant temperature of 11.8 degrees Celsius throughout the year, flowing ceaselessly into the Chikuma River. The most enchanting moment occurs in winter when a layer of mist hovers above the water surface, creating a captivating scene for fortunate winter travelers to admire.\n\nJust a few minutes' drive south from Shiraito Falls, we arrived at the Historic Mikasa Hotel, a Western-style wooden hotel designed and supervised by a Japanese architect in the late Meiji period. At the time, this hotel served as a prestigious and iconic destination for political and business elites visiting Karuizawa. It continued operations until 1970 and was designated as a National Important Cultural Property in May 1980. Today, it stands as one of the primary historic landmarks for sightseeing in Karuizawa. Visitors can not only take photographs outside for remembrance but also enter and explore the hotel's interior, reliving the glamorous history and nostalgic ambiance.\n\nContinuing south on the Sanso Avenue, you'll reach St. Paul's Church. In 1935, due to the growing number of foreign villas in Karuizawa, with over 300 households and a population of more than 1,300, British missionary Father L. Ward established St. Paul's Catholic Church to provide a center for faith and gatherings for the local foreign community. Today, St. Paul's Church remains one of Karuizawa's well-known representative churches. You can often see people coming here for worship and weddings on weekends. The steeply pitched triangular roof is a memorable feature.\n\nContinuing north along the Old Karuizawa Shopping Street by car, you'll quickly reach the Usui Pass Observation Platform. From here, you can admire the scenic landscapes of Gunma Prefecture's mountain ranges on one side and Nagano Prefecture's mountains on the other. We gazed upon the majestic peaks of the Southern Alps, Mt. Yatsugatake, and Mt. Asama. The staff from the Karuizawa Tourism Association explained that after Mt. Asama receives its third snowfall, it's a sign that snowfall will begin in the Karuizawa region. Before our visit, Mt. Asama had already seen its fourth snowfall, marking the first snowfall of the year in the Karuizawa area. As we ventured closer to the mountainous areas, we could see some snow accumulation, signaling the beginning of Karuizawa's winter story.\n\nAdjacent to Usui Pass and situated at the summit of Usui Pass, the Kumanokotai Shrine is a highly unique shrine. Due to its location at the boundary between Nagano and Gunma Prefectures, the shrine has two names. On the left, in Nagano Prefecture, it is known as the Kumanokotai Shrine, while on the right, in Gunma Prefecture, it is called the Kumano Shrine. The main hall of worship is equipped with two places for worshippers to offer coins, and each side has its own facilities for accepting prayers, amulets, and shrine stamps, as well as administrative offices. Within the shrine grounds, the \"Kono Tree,\" a sacred tree, is approximately 1,000 years old. Walking clockwise around the tree as part of the visit is believed to bring good luck and form connections, making it a popular destination for unmarried individuals seeking to improve their prospects in finding a partner.\n\nLocated just across from Kumanokotai Shrine, at the border of Nagano and Gunma Prefectures, you'll find Shigenoya, a tea house with a 300-year history known for serving beloved local Japanese sweets and soba noodles in Karuizawa. The tea house is renowned for its \"Mochi\" Master, a delicacy that has been a specialty of Usui Pass on the Nakasendo Trail since ancient times. After visiting several famous spots in Karuizawa, it's the perfect place to take a break, enjoy traditional Japanese desserts, and have some tea. We ordered three of the most representative flavors of \"Mochi\" Master: red bean paste, walnut, and soy sauce radish paste, each priced at 540 Japanese yen.\n\nReturning along the same route by car, not far from the entrance to the Old Karuizawa Shopping Street, you'll come across the Karuizawa Shaw Memorial Church. It was established in 1895 by Canadian missionary Alexander Croft Shaw, often referred to as the \"Father of Karuizawa Development.\" This church is the original and oldest in Karuizawa. Nearby, you can find the villa where Reverend Shaw resided, built in 1888. It is considered the first villa in Karuizawa. Today, it has been restored and features interior displays of photographs from that era, offering a glimpse into the lives of the early foreign residents who sought summer relief in Karuizawa. Thanks to Reverend Shaw's promotion of Karuizawa as a summer retreat, it has become known as the \"Birthplace of the Karuizawa Summer Resort.\" In the surrounding area, you'll find many other villa buildings, and strolling through them imparts a sense of elegance and comfort.\n\nThe bustling and classical \"Old Karuizawa Ginza Street\" connects from Karuizawa Shaw Memorial Church as you head south. Initially catering to the needs of the foreign residents in Karuizawa, this street was lined with shops selling Western sausages, bread, and jams. Today, this street exudes a foreign atmosphere and is home to cafes, dessert shops, bakeries, as well as various craft and grocery stores. Strolling along this charming street is an absolute delight. One highlight is the renowned local Sawayaka fruit jams, which make for perfect souvenirs. You can also capture unforgettable memories by dressing up in vintage attire and taking photos at the Karuizawa Portrait Studio. Even the Karuizawa Tourist Association building boasts a European-style façade. For more information on the various shops, you can visit the official website of the Karuizawa Ginza Shopping Street Association.\n\nIf you're visiting Karuizawa, one of the must-buy souvenirs is Sawaya's fruit jams. There is a direct store located on the Old Karuizawa Ginza Street where you can purchase these jams. Their jams have been a traditional product passed down since the time of foreign missionaries who brought them to this area. Made from fresh seasonal ingredients without any chemical additives, these jams should be refrigerated and consumed within two weeks after opening. The most popular item is the Berry Jam, crafted from a whole fresh strawberry, priced at 681 Japanese yen for a small-sized jar (as shown in the photo). Additionally, you can find a limited-edition product exclusive to the direct store, the Matcha Milk Jam, known for its rich and creamy matcha flavor. While you're at the store, don't miss the chance to try Piroshki, a nostalgic snack introduced by Russian immigrants in 1950.\n\nAfter exploring the many shops along the Old Karuizawa Ginza Street, the night has fallen, and your appetite has awakened. It's time to enjoy a hearty meal, and what could be more perfect than a top-quality Wagyu beef feast? A highly reputed restaurant, Rogutei, is just a four-minute walk from Karuizawa Station, and they even offer free parking for added convenience.\n\nWhat's particularly delightful about Rogutei is that you can savor both Japanese-style barbecue and shabu-shabu hot pot at the same table. We ordered the premium Wagyu beef shabu-shabu set, which includes the finest sirloin, a vegetable platter, sashimi, your choice of rice or udon noodles, and all-you-can-eat access to the salad bar. Additionally, we couldn't resist trying the superb Wagyu beef assorted platter for two, featuring filet, sirloin, spare ribs, seafood, various vegetables, and access to the salad bar.\n\nJust one look at the marbling on that Wagyu beef tells you about its marvelous flavor and melt-in-your-mouth tenderness. Tonight, let this Wagyu beef feast satisfy not only your taste buds but also your tired body and mind.\n\nAfter dinner and before bedtime, there are still plenty of activities to enjoy in Karuizawa. In addition to taking a leisurely drive to admire the illuminated winter festival decorations throughout Karuizawa, I recommend a visit to the DELICIA supermarket. DELICIA stays open until 11:00 PM, making it a perfect late-night shopping destination. Once inside, you'll discover a wide range of products that you won't typically find in regular Tokyo supermarkets. Surprisingly, they offer a variety of classic French teas, including Mariage Frères teas, which are usually only available in department stores or specialty shops. Moreover, you can find Karuizawa's local brands of freshly baked coffee and artisanal jams, which are unique and not commonly found in Tokyo supermarkets.\n\nEmphasizing the use of local ingredients, DELICIA's shelves are stocked with a diverse selection of items such as Shinshu fruit juices, honey, and vegetables and fruits nurtured by the fertile soil of Azumino. They also offer local sake and other regional specialties. After a stroll through the supermarket, I'm sure you'll have all your souvenirs and snacks sorted for your return home.\n\nOur accommodation for tonight is the East Wing of Prince Hotel Karuizawa. Prince Hotel Karuizawa is a large resort center located very close to Karuizawa Station. It offers a wide range of amenities, including a golf course, shopping center, restaurants, spa, and even a ski resort. The East Wing, where we are staying, is conveniently located near the ski slopes.\n\nThe East Wing follows the concept of NEO FOREST and is designed to resemble an artistic forest space. Whether you're in the lobby lounge or the welcoming areas on each floor, you'll feel like you're surrounded by a forest.

The cabins are nestled amidst the trees, and from some, you can even see the ski slopes, which would surely excite the kids.\n\nThe cabins are a short stroll away from the main hotel building, or you can simply call the front desk for a shuttle service that takes only a few minutes. For room rates, please check the official website or various booking platforms. Enjoy your stay!\n\nBreakfast at the hotel is served in the bright and clean first-floor restaurant. You can choose from Western or Japanese-style breakfast sets. The salad is made from fresh local vegetables and paired with the hotel's special dressing, which is refreshing and appetizing. After breakfast, it's the perfect time to hit the slopes!\n\nThe Prince Hotel Karuizawa Ski Resort offers a great skiing environment with snowmaking machines and snow groomers. There are various skiing routes of different difficulty levels suitable for both kids and adults. Check here for details and lift tickets.\n\nAfter a morning of skiing in the snow, it's essential to recharge with a delicious lunch. Located a 12-minute walk from Karuizawa Station's north exit, Chouette is a French provincial cuisine restaurant for over 16 years, including six years of the chef's experience in France. When asking locals for recommendations on authentic Western restaurants, Chouette often appears on their list. Their lunch set includes a starter of Matsuba crab pie, burdock root soup, a choice of three main courses (pan-seared lamb, Tsukiji fresh fish, red wine-braised beef), dessert, coffee, and homemade grilled bread.\n\n(Photo courtesy of Hiroshi Senju Museum Karuizawa)\n\nThe Hiroshi Senju Museum Karuizawa showcases the works of the globally acclaimed Japanese artist, Master Hiroshi Senju. Each of his paintings possesses a unique artistic quality and worldview that deeply captivates and moves people's hearts. Additionally, the museum's architecture itself is a masterpiece, designed by the renowned architect Tadao Ando, featuring a modern and avant-garde design with its gentle, curved glass lines that play with the changing light. The entire space is an artistic creation where you can simultaneously appreciate the artworks, the ever-changing plant life with the seasons, and the mingling of people's activities. It feels like taking a stroll through a forest while admiring the art. The museum's unique flooring design takes advantage of the terrain's elevation changes, creating a gradual slope.\n\nInside, you'll find the Nightfall exhibition room, bathed in blue fluorescent light, as well as a colorful foliage garden, a museum shop, a café, and a bakery, making it a beautifully distinctive museum.\n\nThe final must-visit on your itinerary is the Karuizawa Prince Shopping Plaza. It's conveniently located just outside Karuizawa Station's south exit and is one of Japan's expansive shopping centers. You'll find a wide range of options here, from international brands to local Karuizawa specialties. The plaza is so vast that you might worry about not having enough time to explore it all.\n\nAdjacent to the shopping plaza, there's a building that houses a variety of restaurants in a food court-style setup. So, when you're done with your shopping and your stomach starts to growl, you can enjoy a diverse selection of cuisines right here.
