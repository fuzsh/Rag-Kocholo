Though this is the least legitimate in the sense of what is commonly thought as a ring road, merely consisting of ways to route traffic, it differs from the other ring roads in that it would consist of a fully circular network of routes around a focal point, rather than I, II and III, which are properly only semicircular, being as they are, limited by the sea on one side.\n\nHakamäentie, by-passes inner city.

To the western side, Aigaleo Avenue, encircling Mount Aigaleo and to the eastern side, the Hymettus Ring. As supplementary avenues there are also NATO Avenue, running across the Elefsina Basin next to Mount Aigaleo, Katehaki Avenue, connecting NE (Papagou) and SE (Ilioupoli) suburbs of Athens aligned with Mount Hymettus and finally Varis-Koropiou Avenue, connecting the vicinity of Athens International Airport and the SE coast of Athens, near the suburb of Voula, in the back side of Mount Hymettus. To the south side (coast), Poseidonos Avenue (Or \"Paraliaki (Παραλιακή): Greek for \"Coastal (Road)\") runs from Piraeus (Faliro Interchange) to Voula, aligned with the coast, until it meets Varis-Koropiou and then it continues to the countryside Sounio Avenue, towards Sounio and Lavrio.\n\nThe quality of the encircling system varies from motorway of high standards and fully computerised control and service (northern section of Attiki Odos) to more simple two-lanes avenue, like Aigaleo Avenue. Most of the system, maybe except the mountainous parts (Aigaleo, Katehaki and Hymettus Ring), is a high-speed traffic system of roads.

Due to its location on the sea, there is no complete ring road as yet. with the combined South Circular Road and North Circular Road forming the oldest, and inner pair dating from the 19th century.\n\nThe M50 motorway forms the middle, most complete and most heavily trafficked (85k-90k cars/day) ring road with an eventual plan to form a complete ring via an undersea tunnel or bridge.\n\nThe Outer Ring Road forms the newest partial ring, running along the west of the cities outer suburbs. Eventual plans are to link it to sections of the R121 road which provides a similar service in the north west of the city, with land being reserved for this.\n\nIn addition, Dublin City Council has signed two \"orbital routes\" consisting of existing roads, but following these requires turning at many junctions.\n\nThe Hague is circled by four ring roads:\n\nThe \"Ring\" is the main ring road, roughly 34 km long; It is also called the \"International ring\".\n\nAround the city centre, there is the \"CentrumRING\", roughly 11 km long.\n\nOslo Ringveg, Oslo (three ring roads going around the city centre, with a mutual road (E18) in southernmost part of the city)\n\nRingveg Vest, Bergen (Connecting RV 580 and RV 555)\n\nRingveg Øst, Bergen (Not built E39 Bypassing Bergen city centre E16 bypassing Arna)\n\nGliwice ring: A1 autostrada, A4 autostrada\n\nKatowice agglomeration ring: A1 autostrada, A4 autostrada, Expressway S1\n\nKraków ring: A4 autostrada, Expressway S7, Expressway S52\n\nLublin ring: Expressway S17, Expressway S19\n\nŁódź ring: A1 autostrada, A2 autostrada, Expressway S8, Expressway S14\n\nPiotrków Trybunalski ring: A1 autostrada, Expressway S8, Expressway S12\n\nPoznań ring: A2 autostrada, Expressway S5, Expressway S11\n\nRzeszów ring: A4 autostrada, Expressway S19\n\nWarsaw ring: Expressway S2, Expressway S7, Expressway S8, Expressway S17\n\nWrocław ring: A4 autostrada, A8 autostrada\n\nSzczecin ring: A6 autostrada, Expressway S3, Expressway S6\n\nToruń ring: A1 autostrada, Expressway S10\n\nTricity (Gdańsk, Sopot, Gdynia) ring: Obwodnica Trójmiejska\n\nCentura București (CB, Bucharest Inner Ringroad) , national road class around Bucharest, currently upgrading to expressway standard;\n\nAutostrada Centura București (ACB, Bucharest Outer Ringroad), a motorway-class road circling Bucharest, currently in planning stages\n\nSibiu bypass: The 17.5 km of motorway as a part of A1 motorway forming a partial beltway around Sibiu was fully completed on August 30, 2011.\n\nAutostrada Centura Constanţa (Constanţa West Bypass motorway), part of A4 , currently under construction, estimated completion – end of 2011\n\nSaint Petersburg Ring Road, Saint Petersburg\n\nMoscow, Russia has three beltways:\n\nMKAD — Moscow Ring Road, which follows city borders, is approximately 109 kilometres (68 mi)\n\nMoscow Small Ring Road — road A107, about 25 kilometres (16 mi) off MKAD, length is about 320 kilometres (200 mi)\n\nMoscow Big Ring Road — road A108, about 80 kilometres (50 mi) off MKAD, length is about 550 kilometres (340 mi)\n\nMoscow Central Ring Road is a planned road which will consist of parts of Moscow Small Ring and Moscow Big Ring.

This proliferation of orbital motorways is partially due to the traditional high radiality of the Spanish highway network, which routed most cross-country traffic through Madrid.\n\nOther Spanish beltways include:\n\nB10 motorway, also known as Ronda Litoral coastal lower (south part) ring road in Barcelona (Catalonia)\n\nB20 motorway, also known as Ronda de Dalt, upper (north parth) ring road in Barcelona (Catalonia)\n\nB30 motorway, outer half-ring road in Barcelona (Catalonia)\n\nB40 motorway, the outermost ring road in Barcelona (Catalonia).(In project, known as \"Quart Cinturó\" (Fourth beltway))\n\nSee also List of autopistas and autovías in Spain\n\nStockholm Ring Road (half-completed, eastern section under feasibility study)\n\nMalmö Inner Ring Road\n\nMalmö Outer Ring Road\n\nLinköping Inner Ring (C-ring) and Outer Ring (Y-ring)\n\nVästerås\n\nKyiv has 3 beltways:\n\nSmall Beltway – completed\n\nGreat Beltway – only west half-belt is complete, through further extension is frozen.\n\nSecond Great Beltway – currently under construction.\n\nKharkiv has one of oldest ring roads in Ukraine.
