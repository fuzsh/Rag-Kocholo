If traveling by car, there are two routes coming up from Tokyo. One leads to the northern region of the Shin-etsu Trail, and the other leads to the southern region. Choose your route based on which section you plan on going to.

Note:

Access to the trail from any station requires the use of a vehicle- whether a private car, taxi, or a shuttle from one of the lodgings (note that some lodgings do not provide this service). Also be aware that road conditions and transportation availability will differ given the time and place, so make sure to gather this information beforehand. Additionally, since there is only limited parking available near trail entrances, it is best to use taxis or other public transportation as much as possible. For transportation availability, please check available maps.
