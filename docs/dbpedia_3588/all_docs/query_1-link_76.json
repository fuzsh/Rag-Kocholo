        "text": "BAGHDAD, Iraq, Feb. 24 - With the streets of the capital and other major cities largely emptied by an extraordinary daytime curfew, imams across Iraq called Friday for an end to the sectarian rioting that has left more than 170 people dead over the past three days, as political leaders held emergency meetings to contain the crisis.\n\nBut in their sermons and public statements, both Sunni and Shiite political and clerical leaders also betrayed an ominous polarization of attitudes about who was at fault for the outbreak of violence, along with an increased hostility to the American role in Iraq.\n\nIraqi leaders and American officials seemed acutely aware that the conflict, which began Wednesday in Samarra after a bomb shattered the dome at one of Iraq's most sacred Shiite shrines, could still push Iraq into a catastrophic civil war, with implications for the entire region.\n\nIn an address to the nation on Friday, Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari extended the daytime curfew for a second day, and prohibited all traffic in and out of Baghdad except for ambulances and police and government vehicles. The leaders of Iraq's major political groups also met Friday to discuss responses, including the formation of a new advisory committee with American military commanders to manage the violence, and a possible ban on carrying weapons without authorization.\n\n\"Everything that needs to be done must be done to avoid a civil war, and I think they are keenly aware of the danger,\" said Zalmay Khalilzad, the American ambassador.\n\nOn Friday Mr. Khalilzad said the American military had increased its patrols in mixed Sunni-Shiite areas, in a sign that commanders might be concerned about the ability of the Iraqi Army and police to prevent violence after the curfew lifts. The Iraqi police, whose ranks include many followers of Shiite militias, largely stood by during the attacks on Sunni mosques on Wednesday and Thursday, as did many Iraqi soldiers.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
