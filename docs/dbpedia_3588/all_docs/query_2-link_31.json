        "text": "Special report: Iraq\n\nKey figures in IraqGrand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani\n\nArguably the most powerful man in Iraq. The 73-year-old is the most powerful religious leader in the country as the most senior cleric of Iraq's Shia majority. Since the fall of Saddam he has played a low-profile role, but pressed for the January 2005 elections and had backed Ibrahim al-Jaafari to become prime minister. He is one of only five grand ayatollahs in the world.\n\nPhotograph: AP\n\nIbrahim al-Jaafari\n\nThe 58-year-old former London GP is Iraq's first democratic prime minister since before the Saddam era. He is a conservative Shia with strong religious beliefs and leads the Islamic Dawa party, which is a major player in the dominant United Iraqi Alliance. The UIA holds more than half of the new parliament's 275 seats. Some analysts see him as a conciliatory figure.\n\nPhotograph: Hadi Mizban/AP\n\nThe man to heal Iraq\n\n'A wily politician'\n\nJalal Talabani\n\nA leader of Iraq's minority Kurds, he was elected Iraq's new president on April 6 2005. He is the first Kurd to be Iraq's president. Mr Talabani had opposed governments in Baghdad for much of the last 40 years. He leads the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), which controls the eastern part of the Kurds' self-rule area. The PUK controls around 25,000 fighters.\n\nMr Talabani wants a federal Iraq with Kurds running their own region.\n\nPhotograph: Vahid Salemi/AP\n\nTalabani elected as Iraqi president\n\nGhazi al-Yawar\n\nA Sunni tribal leader from Mosul who is one of Iraq's two vice-presidents. Mr Yawar had formally been the interim president before the January 2005 elections. He leads the Iraqis party, an alliance of moderate Sunnis and Shia. His appointment is a conciliatory move to appease the Sunni minority, which largely stayed away from the polls and has been blamed for the insurgency. The other vice-president is Adel Abdul Mahdi, a Shia who was finance minister in the interim administration.\n\nPhotograph: Getty Images\n\nHajim al-Hassani\n\nA Sunni Arab, he is the speaker of the Iraqi parliament. He was appointed after Ghazi al-Yawar turned the post down, insisting he wanted to be vice president. Having a Sunni as speaker is one of the ways the parliament is trying to reach out to Sunnis to try and further involve them in the new Iraq. However, some critics have questioned Mr Hassani's clout in the Sunni community.\n\nPhotograph: AP\n\nIraq crisis ends as speaker elected\n\nAyad Allawi\n\nA former member of Saddam's ruling Ba'ath party, he became Iraq's interim prime minister in June 2004. Mr Allawi leads the Iraqi List alliance, a secular party which won 40 seats in the January 2005 poll. He failed to keep the prime minister's job and his party is not in Mr Jaafari's cabinet but it has said it will work with the government .\n\nIn 1976 Mr Allawi formed the opposition Iraq National Accord (INA), which had US backing.\n\nPhotograph: Sean Smith\n\nAbdul Aziz al-Hakim\n\nHad been considered by some as a contender for prime minister, Mr Hakim leads the powerful Shia party the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (Sciri). Mr Hakim spent 20 years as an exile in Iran and has support from Ayatollah Sistani. Mr Hakim's brother, the revered Ayatollah Muhammad Baqr al-Hakim, was killed in a car bombing in August 2003 outside the shrine of Imam Ali in Najaf.\n\nPhotograph: Ali Haider/AP\n\nAhmad Chalabi\n\nOne of four deputy prime ministers in the new administration. The former banker once touted in the US as a successor to Saddam Hussein founded the Iraqi National Congress (INC) opposition party while in exile for 30 years. The INC is now part of the United Iraqi Alliance. The British educated 57-year-old was convicted of fraud in absentia in Jordan in 1992 and sentenced to 22 years in jail. He denied the charges.\n\nPhotograph: AP/Free Iraqi Forces\n\nMoqtada al-Sadr\n\nA Shia cleric from Najaf whose militia army twice revolted against the US-led coalition. He took a deliberately ambiguous line before the January 2005 elections saying he would not vote but gave his blessing to supporters who joined various electoral lists so he would have a voice in the political bargaining.\n\nPhotograph: AP\n\nAdnan Pachachi\n\nAn 80-year-old Sunni statesman and former Iraqi foreign minister who is popular in Washington. A list of parties headed by Mr Pachachi at the January 2005 elections took only 12,000 votes, just 0.1% of the total.\n\nBut he has predicted that Sunnis will eventually participate more widely in the fledgling Iraqi democracy. He had been a contender to become president.\n\nPhotograph: Kamran Jebreili/AP\n\nMasoud Barzani\n\nLeader of the Kurdistan Democratic party (KDP), which rules the western part of the Kurdish self-rule area from the regional capital, Irbil. Represents the more traditional, tribal elements in Kurdish society, and controls a fighting force of up to 35,000.He is likely to get a significant role in the new Iraqi parliament.\n\nPhotograph: Sion Touhig\n\nCoalition and UN figures in IraqZalmay Khalilzad\n\nA former US ambassador to Afghanistan, he is the Bush administration's nomination to be the next US envoy to Iraq. Born in northern Afghanistan, he had great influence in that country and was sometimes described as a viceroy or its real president. He may have less influence in Iraq but is not a stranger to the country. If confirmed, he would succeed John Negroponte who has left Iraq to become the director of national intelligence.\n\nPhotograph: Charles Dharapak / AP\n\nEdward Chaplin\n\nAppointed the UK's ambassador to Iraq in April 2004. He is the first British envoy in Iraq since the Gulf war of 1991, and headed the Middle East and North Africa department at the Foreign Office before that. Mr Chaplin was briefly kidnapped by Revolutionary Guards in Iran in 1987.\n\nPhotograph Foreign Office\n\nLt Gen Ricardo Sanchez\n\nThe top US commander in Iraq. By March 2005, some 1,500 US soldiers had been killed in Iraq since the 2003 US-led invasiion.\n\nPhotograph: AP"
