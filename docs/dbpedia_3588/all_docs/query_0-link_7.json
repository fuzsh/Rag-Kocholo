        "text": "Jawad al-Maliki is not a household name in Iraq, but that may work in his favour as he embarks on the task of forming a government of national unity that will satisfy the main Shia, Sunni and Kurdish communities, analysts said yesterday.\n\nHis predecessor and party boss, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, had made many political enemies by the time he assumed Iraq's most powerful executive position, but Mr Maliki is a low-key political insider who has been steadily working his way through the ranks of Dawa, Iraq's oldest and most respected Shia party.\n\nHis story mirrors that of many devout Iraqi Shia Mulsims who opposed the secular Ba'athist dictatorship. Born Nouri Kamel al-Maliki in about 1950 in Hindiya, south of Kerbala, he joined the Dawa party as a young man. He fled Iraq in 1980 after a Ba'athist judge sentenced him to death for membership of the party. Now using the name Jawad, he went first to Iran, where he made contact with Mr Jaafari, who was already exiled there. During the Iran-Iraq war, Dawa split into several factions and Mr Maliki and Mr Jaafari left for Syria after refusing to fight against Iraq. He continued his work from Damascus, directing Dawa's underground network in Iraq.\n\nHe returned home in 2003 after the US invasion and was elected to parliament as part of the Shia alliance in January 2005. He served as the head of the security and defence committee. More controversially, he sat on the De-Ba'athification Commission, the group charged with purging former Ba'athists from the military and government. Many Sunni Arabs, who dominated under the Ba'athists, saw this as a means of securing their political marginalisation.\n\n\"If he can forget trying to pin us all with the Ba'athist tag, and work with the Sunni parties, then we have no problem with him,\" said a spokesman for the Sunni Accordance Front.\n\nMr Maliki has won a reputation as a skilled negotiator. Government sources said he was closely involved in the drawn-out talks to write Iraq's new constitution, and had been involved in every stage of talks on the new 33-point policy programme that will form the basis of his national unity government.\n\nHe backs Iraq's new federal status, telling the Guardian recently that \"the days of centralised rule are over\".\n\nThe policy document \"bears his imprint, and we believe he will do all he can to implement it\", said Fouad Hussein, chief of staff of Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan region. The Kurds are looking to the new government to make good on constitutional guarantees of their self-rule.\n\nIn contrast to his predecessor, who would engage in long rambling speeches that often baffled both colleagues and journalists, Mr Maliki talks clearly, sometimes stridently, and is more of a pragmatist than Mr Jaafari. \"He is untested. But I think people will know where they are with him,\" said a western diplomat in Iraq. \"When he agrees to do something, he generally tries to do it.\""
