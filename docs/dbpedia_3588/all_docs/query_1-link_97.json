        "text": "Iraq / War on Terrorism\n\nBAGHDAD, Iraq (AP -- A French-educated\n\nfinance minister and a former London physician emerged Monday as the top candidates\n\nto be Iraq's next prime minister, as leaders of the clergy-backed Shiite Muslim\n\nalliance launched consultations after failing to get a two-thirds majority in\n\nthe vote for Iraq's new Parliament.\n\nThe prominence of urbane, moderate,\n\nWestern-oriented figures appears designed to counter concern in Washington that\n\nIran's influence will grow in Iraq after a Shiite-dominated government takes\n\npower -- even though the ultimate decision may rest with a reclusive elderly\n\ncleric.\n\nAdel Abdul-Mahdi, the interim finance\n\nminister, and Ibrahim al-Jaafari, the interim vice president, were said to be\n\nthe leading candidates for prime minister.\n\nThe Kurds, who are poised to become\n\nkingmakers in the new Iraq, already have said they want Jalal Talabani, a secular\n\nSunni Kurd and leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, to be Iraq's next\n\npresident. The Shiites may seek a deal with the Kurds to back Talabani for president\n\nin return for Kurdish support for their prime ministerial choice.\n\nThe Kurds, who compose about 15\n\npercent of Iraq's population, have demanded the new constitution legalize Kurdish\n\nself-rule in the north. They also want an end to what they call \"Arabization\"\n\nof Kirkuk and other northern areas where most of the Arabs are Sunni Muslims.\n\nBut the Shiites also know they must\n\nmove carefully, particularly if they want to extend a hand to the minority Sunni\n\nArabs to form an inclusive government and tame a virulent insurgency. Many Sunni\n\nArabs, who make up about 20 percent of the population, stayed home on election\n\nday, either out of fear of violence or to support a boycott call by radical\n\nclerics opposed to the U.S. military.\n\nRoadside bombs killed a U.S. soldier\n\nand three Iraqi National Guard troops Monday, and officials said insurgents\n\nblew up an oil pipeline near Kirkuk and killed two senior police officers in\n\nBaghdad.\n\nThree other U.S. soldiers were wounded\n\nwhen the bomb detonated near their patrol outside the town of Baqouba, 35 miles\n\nnortheast of Baghdad, the military said.\n\nThe Jan. 30 election results for\n\nthe National Assembly, announced Sunday, gave the clergy-backed United Iraqi\n\nAlliance 48 percent of the vote, the Kurdish alliance 26 percent, and the ticket\n\nled by interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, a secular Shiite who supported strong\n\nties to Washington, only 14 percent.\n\nBackroom trading for the top posts\n\nin the new government began in earnest Monday after the United Iraqi Alliance\n\nfailed to secure the two-thirds majority in the newly elected assembly that\n\nwould have allowed it to control the legislature and install whomever it wanted\n\nas president.\n\nThe National Assembly's first task\n\nis to elect a president and two vice presidents by a two-thirds majority. The\n\nthree then choose a new prime minister subject to assembly approval.\n\nThe parties that make up the alliance\n\n-- the Islamic Dawa Party, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in\n\nIraq and former Pentagon protégé Ahmad Chalabi's Iraqi National\n\nCongress -- huddled for talks to decide on a prime ministerial candidate.\n\nAl-Jaafari was the Dawa Party's\n\nchoice, while SCIRI nominated Abdul-Mahdi, said Humam Hamoudi, a spokesman for\n\nthe United Iraqi Alliance. He said the alliance would decide today.\n\nBut it may ultimately be Grand Ayatollah\n\nAli al-Sistani who decides. Al-Sistani's tacit endorsement is believed to have\n\nled to the Alliance's electoral victory. An official in al-Sistani's office\n\nsaid representatives from the alliance would visit the elderly cleric today\n\nbut that he has not endorsed anyone.\n\nAmong other leading Shiites, Chalabi\n\nhas also thrown his name into the contest for prime minister. Abdul-Aziz al-Hakim,\n\na turbaned cleric who led the ticket and has close links with Iran, has said\n\nhe's not interested in the job.\n\nThe French-educated Abdul-Mahdi,\n\nwho was born in 1942 and is the son of a respected Shiite cleric, was a leading\n\nSCIRI politician before becoming the interim finance minister.\n\nAl-Jaafari, a physician, was born\n\nin 1947 and lived in London before serving on the now-disbanded Iraqi Governing\n\nCouncil.\n\nAllawi, the secular Shiite who ran\n\nthe government for the past eight months, had been discussed as a compromise\n\ncandidate, but his chances dimmed after his ticket finished a distant third\n\nwith only 13 percent of the vote. U.S. officials have suggested he might get\n\na vice presidential position.\n\nAlliance spokesman Hamoudi said\n\nthe prime ministerial candidate would be chosen on his ability to unite the\n\nsplintering population.\n\n\"We want the new government to be\n\na joint government, which will include the other parties and political entities\n\nthat did not participate in the elections,\" he said, a reference to the Shiites'\n\ndetermination to draw in Sunnis already alienated in postwar Iraq.\n\nAl-Hakim also made that point when\n\nresults were released on Sunday.\n\n\"We believe in the need for participation\n\nand will seek harmony among all segments of the Iraqi people,\" he told Iraqi\n\ntelevision.\n\nElection commission officials did\n\nnot know when the new National Assembly would meet. Competitors have two more\n\ndays to lodge complaints or dispute the results. So far, there has been no challenge\n\nto the vote.\n\nAfter any disputes are resolved,\n\nelection official Adel al Lami said, the commission will hand the results to\n\nthe current interim government, which will then decide when to transfer authority\n\nformally to the incoming National Assembly.\n\nINFOBOX:\n\nWhat's next\n\nWhat's next for the incoming members\n\nof Iraq's 275-member National Assembly:\n\n* ASSEMBLY COMPOSITION: Seats in\n\nthe assembly will be awarded to candidate slates according to their percentage\n\nof the national vote. For example, if a list won 40 percent of the votes, it\n\nwould get roughly 40 percent of the seats in the assembly.\n\n* NATIONAL ASSEMBLY: The assembly\n\nwill serve as a lawmaking body, and it will also help select and approve the\n\npresident and prime minister. But its most important task is to create a committee\n\nto draft a permanent constitution.\n\n* CONSTITUTION REFERENDUM AND THE\n\nNEXT ELECTIONS: Iraqis will vote on the proposed constitution by Oct. 15. If\n\nthey approve, elections for a permanent government to replace the assembly will\n\nbe held in December. If voters reject the charter, the National Assembly will\n\nbe dissolved and a new transitional assembly will be elected in December to\n\ntake another stab at constitution writing.\n\n* NEW GOVERNMENT: The newly elected\n\nNational Assembly will elect a largely ceremonial president and two deputy presidents.\n\nThe president and two deputies will name a prime minister and cabinet, subject\n\nto the assembly's approval.\n\n* HOW LONG: The new government will\n\nremain in office for 11 months, until elections in mid-December.\n\nGRAPHICS: Shiites to dominate the\n\nassembly. Iraq's majority Shiite Muslims won nearly half the votes in the nation's\n\nJan. 30 election, giving the group significant power but not enough to form\n\na government on its own. Votes breakdown.
