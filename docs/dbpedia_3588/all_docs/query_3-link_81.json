        "text": "DEARBORN, Mich., Sept. 13 - This city's Iraqi-American population, who form one of the world's largest Iraqi expatriate communities, loathed Saddam Hussein. Tuesday evening, they embraced Ibrahim al-Jaafari, Iraq's first democratically elected prime minister, at times shouting poetry and prayer in his praise.\n\nBut they also had plenty of questions in a town hall meeting that was at times contentious. Attendees asked Mr. Jaafari about the future of Kirkuk, whether the rights of Chaldeans would be respected, whether there were still Iraqi prisoners of war in Iran and whether Iraqi embassies throughout the world and government agencies in the country were still stocked with former Baathists. And they wanted to know when justice and the rule of law would return to their native land.\n\n\"What moves me is my desire to work for my country and for you,\" Mr. Jaafari told the crowd of several hundred at a Ritz-Carlton hotel. \"Just as we were once upon a time imposed on by this tyrant, we are now imposed upon by this group of terrorists,\" he said, adding that it was his top priority to combat terrorism. He said the country was making progress in lowering the number of daily car bombings, but added that there were very likely still hostile elements even inside the different institutions within the government.\n\n\"Don't think the time between May 3 and now is enough to diminish 35 years of Saddam's rule,\" he said, referring to the day he took office. \"Don't think that anything is going to happen overnight. We need time.\"\n\nMr. Jaafari is a medical doctor who fled Iraq in 1980 when Mr. Hussein began rounding up members of the Dawa Party, which Mr. Jaafari now leads. He returned to Iraq shortly after the war began. On Monday, an insurgent group put a $100,000 bounty on him, coinciding with his visit to Tal Afar in northern Iraq, the site of a major coalition operation against insurgents.\n\nMr. Jaafari seemed somewhat wearied from his trip; he arrived in town shortly before his speech. He addressed a small group of local community leaders and then the crowd of several hundred for about an hour before sitting to listen to a stream of questioners.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
