        "text": "The blast from the bomb that blew up the Mount Lebanon Hotel in Baghdad in mid-March knocked me out of my chair and sent my coffee flying out of its cup. A few seconds later, there was a burst from what sounded like a Kalashnikov. Gunfire has become routine in Baghdad, and there are explosions almost every day, but this was the biggest blast I had heard since Saddam’s palaces and municipal buildings were being attacked by the United States, exactly a year ago. I am staying in the same hotel, the Palestine, I stayed in then, with its views of the Tigris and, on the other side of the river, the big Presidential complex, which is now occupied by the Coalition Provisional Authority, in what is called the Green Zone. (Everything outside its reinforced walls—in other words, the rest of Iraq—is referred to as the Red Zone.) A great gray plume of smoke was billowing into the night sky, and I went up to the roof to get a better view. Several other hotel guests were already there: Iraqis, Koreans, Italians, Spaniards, a number of Americans, a couple of South Africans. During the past year, hundreds of foreigners—journalists, entrepreneurs, the paramilitary representatives of private security firms—have made their way to Iraq. One entire floor of the Palestine is occupied by employees of Kellogg Brown & Root, the Halliburton subsidiary. When the elevator stops on their floor and the doors open, Nepalese Gurkha guards with snub-nosed submachine guns are standing in the hallway to check out who’s getting off.\n\nBaghdad is a much more dangerous place than it was a year ago. A few days before the Mount Lebanon explosion, someone set off a bomb in front of a perfume shop in the same neighborhood—Al-Karrada, a predominantly Shiite section of the city. The target of the attack, who died, was the brotherin-law of Ibrahim al-Jaafari, a member of the Iraqi Governing Council. Jaafari’s brother-in-law was not involved in politics, but he was presumably easier to get to than Jaafari, and killing him may have been worth it just to get a message across.\n\nThe fall of Saddam has improved the lives of many Iraqis, especially professionals such as doctors, engineers, and teachers, whose salaries have significantly increased. And the streets are clogged with traffic, which wasn’t true before the war. A great many Iraqis took advantage of the temporary suspension of import duties at the border with Jordan and bought cheap secondhand cars. The Internet, which was strictly controlled under Saddam, is available everywhere, as are a wide variety of computers, domestic appliances, and cell phones. These life-style improvements notwithstanding, very few people venture out on the streets after dark, and almost no one I know dares drive after ten-thirty. This is because of the staggering increase in the number of rapes, murders, armed robberies, carjackings, and kidnappings. Saddam emptied the country’s prisons a few months before the war, and perhaps a hundred thousand criminals returned to the streets. Young girls are now walked to and from school by their fathers or brothers, for fear they might be snatched. Women generally dress much more modestly than they did before, wearing either baggy black abayas or helmet-like hijab head scarves.\n\nIt is not only the wealthy who are targeted for robbery and extortion. As in countries like Colombia and Mexico, wives and children of schoolteachers and mechanics are kidnapped along with politicians and rich businessmen. A couple of months ago, the twelve-year-old son of an Iraqi friend of mine, a driver who lives in a working-class neighborhood, was kidnapped one morning while walking to school. My friend had recently bought a nice secondhand car, which he was very proud of and loved to show off. That was probably his big mistake. The kidnappers demanded fifty thousand dollars in ransom. He bargained them down to six thousand dollars, sold his new car, and paid up. Several hours later, the boy was released a few blocks from his home. Since then, my friend has not let his son out of the house, even to go to school.\n\nEveryone is on edge here, but foreigners are the main targets of assassination. A few days ago, a German and a Dutch engineer were murdered on the road between Baghdad and Karbala at about the time a journalist friend of mine was driving along the same route. He was travelling with a security detail that was supposed to keep suspicious cars away, but suddenly he realized that a black BMW—the car of choice for assassins in Iraq—had pulled up alongside him. The BMW raced past and then doubled back. As it went by a second time, my friend saw several men inside, staring at him intently. Assassins usually rake the driver’s side of a car with bullets on their second or third pass, causing a crash. My friend’s driver took evasive measures and escaped down a side road.\n\nJust being around foreigners has become hazardous. In most of the recent killings of Americans and Europeans, Iraqis died with them—their drivers, guards, and interpreters. A couple of weeks ago, assassins in Baghdad ambushed the car of an Iraqi translator who worked for the Voice of America, killing him, his mother, and his young daughter. Many foreigners are starting to move out of the little family hotels that seemed so charming, and others are giving up the comfortable and civilized neighborhood houses they were renting. The Palestine, with its reinforced-concrete perimeter walls, razor wire, armed guards, and bomb-sniffing dogs, is getting crowded."
