        "text": "Description\n\nThe Eckert III is a compromise pseudocylindrical map projection for world maps. The lateral meridians are semicircles, which give the projection a rounded shape and smooth corners where the lateral meridians meet the pole lines.\n\nThis projection was introduced by Max Eckert in 1906. It is available in ArcGIS Pro 1.0 and later and in ArcGIS Desktop 8.0 and later.\n\nProjection properties\n\nThe subsections below describe the Eckert III projection properties.\n\nGraticule\n\nEckert III is a pseudocylindric projection. The meridians are regularly distributed semiellipses concave toward the central meridian. The lateral meridians are semicircles, which give the graticule a rounded shape. The central meridian is a straight line, half the length of the projected equator. The parallels are equally distributed straight lines perpendicular to the central meridian. The poles are straight lines half the length of the equator. The corners where lateral meridians meet the pole lines are smooth. The graticule is symmetric across the equator and the central meridian.\n\nDistortion\n\nThe Eckert III projection is neither conformal nor equal-area. It generally distorts shapes, areas, distances, directions, and angles. The scale is constant along any given parallel. The distortion patterns are similar to other compromise pseudocylindrical projections. Area distortion grows with latitude and does not change with longitude. High latitude areas are exaggerated. Angular distortion is zero at the equator and increases toward the poles. Distortion values are symmetric across the equator and the central meridian.\n\nSources\n\nSnyder, J. P. (1993).
