        "text": "Classifications\n\ncylindric\n\nGraticule\n\nMeridians: Equally spaced straight parallel lines 0.73 as long as the equator.\n\nParallels: Unequally spaced straight parallel lines, closest near the equator, but spacing does not increase poleward as fast as it does on the Mercator. Perpendicular to meridians.\n\nPoles: Straight lines equal in length to the equator.\n\nSymmetry: About any meridian or the equator.\n\nAspects\n\nNormal aspect is commonly used.\n\nOblique aspect has been used by the National Geographic Society.\n\nScale\n\nTrue along the equator in all directions.\n\nConstant in any given direction along any other given latitude; same scale at the latitude of opposite sign.\n\nChanges with latitude and direction.\n\nDistortion\n\nNone at the equator. Shape, area, and scale distortion increases moderately away from the equator but becomes severe at the poles.\n\nOther features\n\nParallels are spaced from the equator by calculating the distance for 0.8 of the same latitude on the Mercator and dividing the result by 0.8. Therefore, the two projections are almost identical near the equator.\n\nUsage\n\nWorld maps in numerous American atlases and some other atlases, as a projection resembling the Mercator but having less distortion of area and scale, especially near the poles.\n\nSimilar projections\n\nGall projection has different spacing of parallels. The lines of no distortion are at latitudes 45°N and S. Rather than at the equator. Miller proposed other alternates in 1942, including one identical with his preferred cylindric but using two-thirds instead of 0.8.\n\nOrigin\n\nPresented by Osborn Maitland Miller (1897–1979) of the American Geographical Society in 1942."
