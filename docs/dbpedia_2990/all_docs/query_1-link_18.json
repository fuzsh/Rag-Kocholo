        "text": "I decided to look into some of the mathematics that makes it possible to calculate distances considering 3D space, for example, calculating distance on a sphere. You can find our more on geodesic distances from the previous blog (https://community.esri.com/groups/coordinate-reference-systems/blog/2014/09/01/geodetic-distances-ho... ).\n\nThe Earth is round but big, so we can consider it flat for short distances. But, even though the circumference of the Earth is about 40,000 kilometers, flat-Earth formulas for calculating the distance between two points start showing noticeable errors when the distance is more than about 20 kilometers. Therefore, calculating distances on a sphere needs to consider spherical geometry, the study of shapes on the surface of a sphere.\n\nSpherical geometry considers spherical trigonometry which deals with relationships between trigonometric functions to calculate the sides and angles of spherical polygons. These spherical polygons are defined by a number of intersecting great circles on a sphere. Some rules found in spherical geometry include:\n\nThere are no parallel lines.\n\nStraight lines are great circles, so any two lines meet in two points.\n\nThe angle between two lines is the angle between the planes of the corresponding great circles.\n\nThe Haversine\n\nDid you know that there are more than the 3 trigonometric functions we are all familiar with sine, cosine and, tangent? These additional trigonometric functions are now obsolete, however, in the past, they were worth naming.\n\nThe additional trigonometric functions are versine, haversine, coversine, hacoversine, exsecant, and excosecant. All of these can be expressed simply in terms of the more familiar trigonometric functions. For example, haversine(θ) = sin²(θ/2).\n\nThe haversine formula is a very accurate way of computing distances between two points on the surface of a sphere using the latitude and longitude of the two points. The haversine formula is a re-formulation of the spherical law of cosines, but the formulation in terms of haversines is more useful for small angles and distances.\n\nOne of the primary applications of trigonometry was navigation, and certain commonly used navigational formulas are stated most simply in terms of these archaic function names. But you might ask, why not just simplify everything down to sines and cosines? The functions listed above were from a time without calculators, or efficient computer processors, when the user calculated angles and direction by hand using log tables, every named function took appreciable effort to evaluate. The point of these functions is if a table simply combines two common operations into one function, it probably made navigational calculations on a rocking ship more efficient.\n\nThese function names have a simple naming pattern and in this example, the \"Ha\" in \"Haversine\" stands for \"half versed sine\" where haversin(θ) = versin(θ)/2.\n\nHaversine Formula\n\nThe Haversine formula is perhaps the first equation to consider when understanding how to calculate distances on a sphere. The word \"Haversine\" comes from the function:\n\nhaversine(θ) = sin²(θ/2)\n\nThe following equation where φ is latitude, λ is longitude, R is earth’s radius (mean radius = 6,371km) is how we translate the above formula to include latitude and longitude coordinates. Note that angles need to be in radians to pass to trig functions:\n\na = sin²(φB - φA/2) + cos φA * cos φB * sin²(λB - λA/2)\n\nc = 2 * atan2( √a, √(1−a) )\n\nd = R ⋅ c\n\nWe can write this formula into a Python script where the input parameters are a pair of coordinates as two lists:\n\n''' Calculate distance using the Haversine Formula ''' def haversine(coord1: object, coord2: object): import math lon1, lat1 = coord1 lon2, lat2 = coord2 R = 6371000 phi_1 = math.radians(lat1) phi_2 = math.radians(lat2) delta_phi = math.radians(lat2 - lat1) delta_lambda = math.radians(lon2 - lon1) a = math.sin(delta_phi / 2.0) ** 2 + math.cos(phi_1) * math.cos(phi_2) * math.sin(delta_lambda / 2.0) ** 2 c = 2 * math.atan2(math.sqrt(a), math.sqrt(1 - a)) meters = R * c km = meters / 1000.0 meters = round(meters, 3) km = round(km, 3) print(f\"Distance: {meters} m\") print(f\"Distance: {km} km\")‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍\n\nThe result will print as below:\n\nhaversine([-0.116773, 51.510357], [-77.009003, 38.889931]) Distance: 5897658.289 m Distance: 5897.658 km‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍‍\n\nThe Central European Net (CEN )\n\nThe European datum began its life as the Central European First-Order Triangulation Adjustment (Hough, 1947) this project began in April 1945 after the U.S Third Army with the HOUGHTEAM captured the trigonometrical section of the Reichsamt für Landesaufnahme in the town of Friedrichsroda, Thuringia (after the raid in Saalfeld - part 2). This group were taken to Bamberg, in the United States Occupation Zone, for interrogation.\n\nIt was discovered that the captured Germans, led by Professor Erwin Gigas, had been completing an adjustment of the first-order triangulation of the Greater Reich with the intent to expand this adjustment across the German occupied territories...\n\nThe assigned Land Survey Office (operating under the Army Map Service and U.S Coast and Geodetic Survey) based in Bamberg commenced the adjustment of the first-order triangulation in June 1945 (Whitton, 1952). It was here, overlooked by the US Army and led by Erwin Gigas, that the German trigonometrical section started a review of all points previously calculated highlighting those of sufficient reliability to be used in the first-order triangulation…\n\nThis review of German triangulation points created a list of data points that were originally used as area controls rather than individual arcs. Selecting from the list of first-order points arcs were chosen and thus the framework for the triangulation adjustment was constructed. The captured Germans at Bamberg performed a least-squares adjustment of Western Europe utilising the HOUGHTEAM’s captured data (see list at the end of this blog). The work plan for the adjustment is laid out as 10 points in Hough, 1947.\n\nThe adjustment was conducted using methods like the Bowie Junction method (Adams and Oscar, 1930) which was previously incorporated into the successful adjustment of the North American Datum 1927 (EPSG: 6267). Work was designed to follow a network of arcs following as much as possible meridians and parallels from the existing triangulation.\n\nBowie method is an arc method of adjusting a triangulation network, where length and azimuth of one side of a triangle at every junction between arcs (chains) are assumed correct and carried into a suitable figure of the junction. Directions or angles in arcs between these figures are then calculated, the corrections in the individual chains calculated, and the misclosures passed into the longitudes and latitudes of the initially fixed sides in the junctions by an adjustment of the entire network, using the method of least squares.\n\nLocational calculations were incorporated from over 140 years of German records choosing the most logical values for astronomic and angle observations, bases and Laplace azimuths. This incorporation ultimately resulted in the Deutsches Hauptdreiecksnetz (EPSG: 6314).\n\nThe HOUGHTEAM was disbanded in September 1945 after completing a hugely successful operation for the war effort. During its 11-month mission the collection can be summarised as:\n\nObtained complete geodetic data coverage of four provinces of Germany, discovered in the combat area, delivered direct to the artillery and put into an immediate operational use at the front.\n\nSelected captured enemy material shipped to Army Map Service:\n\n202 boxes of geodetic data on 900,000 stations in Europe, giving nearly complete coverage of first, second, third, and fourth control in all German and Allied operational World War II areas of the continent\n\n627 boxes of captured maps, covering approximately the same areas noted above (a)\n\nLarge quantities of photograph prints and dispositives for portions of above areas\n\n371 boxes of various surveying and photogrammetric instruments, including seven Zeiss stereoplanigraphs\n\nGeodetic and cartographic library reference books on all countries in Europe.\n\nAcquisition of a nucleus of German geodesists and mathematicians and their removal to the United States Area of Occupation for use on scientific projects by U.S. forces.\n\nTechnical supervision of the adjustment of European first-order triangulation to a common geodetic datum, ED50.\n\nThe compilation of the magnetic atlas of Europe, epoch 1944-45, published in 1950 by the Army Map Service.\n\nList taken from http://disturbedgeographer.com/?p=199\n\nWhilst German triangulation and locational work was carrying on, the First International Geodetic Conference on the Adjustment of European Triangulation was held on August 7th 1946 in Paris (Hough, 1948). Here it was discussed and the decision made to examine the triangulation adjustment problem of Europe, as a whole, based on joining work currently being carried out on the Central European Adjustment with the ultimate aim of creating a common European Datum.\n\nDue to the suffering under occupation of most European nations by the Germans contempt lay at the decision to have them involved in the project. As an alternative the United States chose the engineering task to be carried out by the Army Map Service for the first phase of the European-wide adjustment. Each nation taking part reported their…\n\n…in total some 1500 first-order stations were contained in the triangulation adjustment.\n\nThe Central European First-Order Triangulation Adjustment was completed in June 1947.\n\nThe triangulation arcs can be visualized in Hough, F. W. (1947), The readjustment of European triangulation, Eos Trans. AGU, 28(1), 62–66, doi:10.1029/TR028i001p00062.\n\nExpanding the net to create a European Datum\n\nOther blocks were intended for connection to the Central European Net, these included a North-European Net, South-West European Net (Whitten, 1952), South East European Net and East European Net (Weber, 2000). The incorporation of these new blocks into the CEN required large amounts of calculations and processing, a primary place to introduce the use of computers. Charles Whitten, the Chief Geodesist at NOAA, and advocate of using computers to process geodetic computations passed on his methods to incorporate the blocks into a single triangulation network created the European Datum.\n\nInternational cooperation\n\nThe readjustment of the Western European Bloc was completed on June 30th, 1950 along with the combination of additional “blocks” of retriangulation which resulted in the European Datum 1950 (Hough, 1951). This is one of the first examples of true international cooperation, a project that was born out of the combination of national jealousies and war but resulted in a continent-wide standard in cartography, positional science and the study of the shape of the Earth.\n\nFittingly Floyd Hough wrote appropriate words on the creation of the European datum placing it as one of the major projects of cooperation in European and world history born out of the contrasting chaos of war.\n\nThe triangulation was tied to the International Ellipsoid 1924 (Hough, 1948) built upon some 173 astronomic latitudes, 126 astronomic longitudes and 152 azimuths (Barsky, 1971), no one station can be designated as the datum origin rather a fundamental point is designated at the Helmert Tower in Potsdam, Germany (52°22’51.45”n Latitude 13°03’58.74”e longitude). The design of the first-order triangulation network was designed so that any further triangulation and positional calculations were made using this rigid base, as Hough (1948) described:\n\n“Interior triangulation of the area can be adjusted at will to this rigid framework much as the inner portion of a modern steel building is fitted to its network of beams and columns.…” Hough 1948\n\nThis was the story about how the European Datum of 1950 was created and has formed the basis of a standard positional framework for the European Continent.\n\nThe European Datum 1950\n\nOrigin: Potsdam (Helmert Tower). 52°22’51.45”n Latitude 13°03’58.74”e longitude\n\nEllipsoid: International 1924\n\nPrime Meridian: Greenwich\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn Part 1 of this series we saw the setting for the development of a proto European-wide datum by the Germans. This super-National Datum was originally driven from the need of political and military powers in central Europe to comprehensively understand the world around them. Part 2 of the story will concentrate on the Second World War and the Allied military operations that ultimately led to the creation of the European Datum of 1950.\n\n“During the war the German Army also connected triangulations of other European nations to [the German national datum]\" Hough 1948\n\nBefore 1939 the responsibility with Military Survey at the British War Office was vested in the Geographical Section of the General Staff known as MI4. This Section operated under the Director of Operations and Intelligence, was headed by a Royal Engineer Colonel. Typically the Royal Engineer Colonel would be assisted by Royal Artillery and Infantry Officers. This speaks to the principal application of Military Survey, artillery bombardment and infantry navigation. During the inter-war period a Geodetic sub-section was setup to acquire foreign survey and triangulation data. With increasing evidence in the 1930's that Germany was intending and preparing to launch another war a programme to comprehensively map (and update) the whole of north-eastern France and Belgium (at 1:50,000) began. This effort was led by Colonel P. K. Boulnois under War Office control. To see some of these maps have a look at the plates included in the HMSO book. After the Munich Agreement in 1938 and war with Germany becoming inevitable survey officers were assigned to units for mobilisation. To see more detail concerning MI4 and its organisation see HMSO \"Maps and Survey\" Books from the War Office e.g. Chapter 01.\n\nWar was declared on Germany on the 1st September 1939 after the German invasion of Poland.\n\nBy June 1940 the German’s had triumphed in the Battle of France which Adolf Hitler coined \"the most famous victory in history”. During the Battle of France the defending British Expeditionary Force was trapped along the northern coast of France, forced to scramble an evacuation of over 338,000 troops to England in the Dunkirk evacuation. After Dunkirk, Germany dominated Western Europe. The British Military reported to Prime Minister Winston Churchill on 4th October that even with the help of other Commonwealth countries and the United States, it would not be possible to regain a foothold in continental Europe in the near future.\n\nThrough this interlude where Allied forces fought Axis forces outside of Europe a plan for the invasion of Europe was developed.\n\nBorn out of war\n\nThe decision to undertake a cross-channel invasion within the next year was taken at the Trident Conference in Washington in May 1943.\n\nOperation Overlord (D-Day)\n\nThe Allied operation that launched the successful invasion of German-occupied western Europe during World War II.\n\nThe U.S Office of the Chief of Engineers was deployed in WW2 and one of its commitments was to produce, with cooperation of the other allied groups, through revisions and new position readings (see here), battle field situation maps such as the Normandy Landings on 6th June 1944.\n\nMillions of maps were produced throughout the war. The Normandy invasion alone required 3,000 different maps with a total of 70 million copies for keeping the military command fully aware of the operational situation on the ground, in the air and at sea. As the war progressed mapping became more small scale covering larger areas for strategic purposes and it quickly became apparent the lack of geodetic control the allies held over Europe. Probably through national jealously as well as security purposes very little geodetic data was publically available.\n\nArmy Group, 12th Engineer Section.

Library of Congress Geography and Map Division Washington. http://www.loc.gov/item/2004629096/\n\nHOUGHTEAM (October 1944 to September 1945)\n\nThis lack of geodetic data was particularly noticeable when pushing through France and into Germany making artillery bombardment inaccurate particularly so where shelling took place over the horizon and without seeing the target through gun sights. In this situation of shells going awry the Office of the Chief of Engineers formed a secret intelligence unit in 1944 (Hough, 1947), from the Army Mapping Service (AMS), that was allowed to operate throughout the European Theatre without restrictions. This unit was known as the HOUGHTEAM, named after U.S. Army Major Floyd W. Hough (Chief of the Geodesy Division of AMS) the unit consisted of a team of 3 commissioned officers, 10 enlisted men and 4 engineer consultants.\n\nTheir task was to move in behind infantry advancements with the aim of gathering as much cartographic and geodetic information as possible from the enemy, calculating the geodetic transformations into the military mapping system and passing the information onto the army and artillerymen in particular (Hough, 1947).\n\nThe HOUGHTEAM moved into Europe in September 1944 and set up in Paris to research and identify targets. The team spent time between in Paris as well as on the front typically arriving on the day it was cleared of enemy personnel. By the spring of 1945 the unit was in Germany and working with the 3rd and 7th armies, providing materials to survey and artillerymen greatly assisting in battle performance. During this time the team captured vital geodetic material for the occupation of Baden-Baden, Württemberg and Bavaria.\n\n“…the war in Europe offered a unique opportunity to exploit known targets and thus to procure from enemy sources captured material of this type both for immediate use of artillery units and for preparation of operational maps.” Hough 1948\n\nSaalfeld, Thuringia\n\nThe most famous raid of this unit was made in spring of 1945, when rumour had it that a cache of geodetic data and instrumentation was held in secret including data on parts of the USSR invaded by Germany. On chance when visiting a hospital for wounded Germany soldiers this rumour was confirmed which led to the discovery on April 17th of a huge cache (Bottoms, 1992) in the village of Saalfeld in Thuringia. Interestingly Saalfeld is close (only ~50Km south west) to the town of Jena in the Jena Valley home of Zeiss Optik, the legendary photogrammetry-equipment company that manufactures just the equipment that HOUGHTEAM were hunting, perhaps the team were exploring this area with this knowledge.\n\nThe cache, found in a remote warehouse on the outskirts of Saalfeld turned out to include the entire geodetic archives of the German Army! (Mindling and Bolton, 2008)\n\nIn true world war two stories of adventure, the discovery of these documents didn’t finish this story, instead the reader noting the location of Saalfeld and the time of discovery little time was left for grabbing the materials (the advancing Red Army was within days of occupying the town), of which there were 90 tons (Mindling and Bolton, 2008), this equated to around 75 truckloads of geodetic data, maps and instruments that needed transport to Bamburg in the American Occupation Zone.\n\nIn realising the difficult logistical task ahead for the HOUGHTEAM the Soviets had already began moving in to their zone of occupation.\n\nAccording to the story in Life Magazine (12th May 1958)...\n\n“Hough hurriedly borrowed trucks from a U.S artillery unit and the last of them loaded with data was just clearing one side of the village, rushing for the U.S zone, when the Soviets moved in with their tanks on the other side”.\n\nThe materials were lifted completely by May 28th destined for Bamberg and onto Washington for evaluation and archiving.\n\nRussian troops arrived in the city the next day.\n\nThe horde of information was huge including...\n\nThe importance of this cache, the realisation that the Soviets were also looking for this cache and its closeness to being compromised by the occupying Soviet forces is suggested by a short quote at a meeting of geodesists in Toronto a few years later where leading Russian delegates mentioned that ...“We have heard a lot about you, Mr. Hough\".\n\nThe data gathered by the HOUGHTEAM throughout the Second World War, data from Spain into Russia formed the beginning of a framework for European wide geodetic datum and framework for ballistic missile target localisation.\n\nBottoms, D., 1992.

Lulu.com\n\nIntroduction\n\nConsidering the de facto use of the European datum of 1950 (ED50) throughout the oil industry operating in Northern Europe and the North Sea, I thought it would be interesting to explore this datum’s history and how it came to be the first European continent-wide datum. During the research for this project I uncovered a fasinating story of military intelligence during the Second World War. But first we must set the scene and go back to...\n\nEuropean Geodesy at the Turn of the 20th Century\n\nPrior to World War Two (WW2), Europe was divided into a jumble of independent national and sub-national geodetic datums with their own centre point, triangulation networks and ellipsoids only sometimes connecting to their neighbour’s triangulation effort along the borders.\n\nCentral Europe during the late 19th to early 20th Century is a prime example of this situation. Within the German Confederation and other German States their existed nearly as many datum’s as there were political entities (e.g. Hannover (Gauss, 1821); Bavaria (Soldner, 1808-1828), Prussia (Schreiber, 1975), Württemberg etc). Each of these states contained a survey office directing surveying activities. One of the attempts to connect various datums was during the First German Reich. The Reiehsdreieeksnetz began in Prussia through the Preußische Landesaufnahme (Prussian State Survey) along the Baltic coast as far as Berlin and Lübesk. This triangulation was continued under orders for the survey of Hannover by King George IV (the Hannover triangulation is known as Hannoversche triangle chain).\n\nThese networks had their origin normally at a major observatory such as Greenwich in London, Pulkovo near St. Petersburg and the Pantheon in Paris. Additionally these datums referenced a variety of ellipsoids making transformation calculations difficult. However a common more fundamental problem summarised by Hough (1948), on the original triangulation of Germany, was that...\n\n“…no attempt [was made] to minimize the effect of the deflection of the vertical at the initial station” Hough (1948)\n\n...and therefore errors in position were found at the place of joining to other triangulation networks before any transformation had even been started.\n\nOther technical issues existed for trying to connect existing triangulations. The connection between the New Triangulation of France (NTF) Datum and the Belgian Datum of 1927 is an example where the connecting of triangulation networks was insufficiently calculated. A calculation was conducted to find the difference in longitudinal values between Brussels and Greenwich. However this was result was not incorporated in the joining of the triangulation networks and hence left large errors for the connection of the networks.\n\nGermany - An example of “first order triangulation”\n\nSince the formation of the First German Reich after unification in 1871, efforts had been made to standardise triangulation across the country beginning to solve some of the issues mentioned above. However, state military survey organisations within the German army produced uncoordinated products throughout the period up to the end of WW1, perhaps indicating disloyalty within the newly unified country. This lack of coordinatation and communication between survey organisations led to some poor quality mapping products being produced during the First World War (see Cruickshank, 2006 for more details).\n\nAfter the First World War and the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 a reduction in military staff led to the demilitarisation of survey groups and the establishment of Reichsamt für Landesaufnahme (Reich Office for State Survey) who led an overhaul of Germany's mulitiple triangulations. A “Neutriangulation” of Bavaria, Baden, Württenberg, Silesia, Pomerania, Mecklenburg and Schleswig-Holstein took place in 1925. This “Neutriangulation” can been noted as a geodetic manifestation in the balance of power from the German Provinces.\n\nAs political tensions rose during the 1920 – 1930’s, driven in part by the dire economic situation throughout Germany and global depression, extremes in the political arena took hold eventually leading to the events that resulted in the rise of Nazism. Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party took hold of the country via emergency decree on 27th February 1933 after the Reichstag fire.\n\nDevelopment of a Military Survey\n\nAfter the seizing of power by the Nazi’s Germany no longer cooperated according to the Treaty of Versailles, restoring pre-war military institutions and a 9th Division to the General Staff of the Army, known as the Military Survey (Reichsamt Kriegskarten und Vermessungswesen, see details about the organisation in Cruickshank, 2005). In 1936 Lt. Colonel Hemmerich was appointed Department Chief. Under Hemmerich’s leadership the division dealt with the collection, evaluation, cataloguing and co-ordination of foreign maps and geodetic data, which were collated and reported in the ‘Planhefte’. These became major publications of the German Military Survey.\n\nFigure 1 Lt. Colonel Hemmerich (image from http://disturbedgeographer.com)\n\nThe development of the military survey coincided with early attempts by the Minister of the Interior to create a A Neuordnung des Vermessungswesens (New Order of Survey and Mapping) and by 1936 Survey Commissars were established throughout the regions of the now Third Reich. These commissars were also the local political leaders of individual states.\n\nAn attempt by the German's to create an early equivalent of the European Datum was started in preparation for, and developed throughout, the Second World War. This was due to the failings of the pre-First World War military survey activity that resulted in poor location plots and the use of old data (see Cruickshank, 2006 for a detailed discussion). During the inter-war period lessons were drawn from the experience of the First World War, in particular about the importance of collecting up-to-date foreign maps and geodetic data.\n\nWith war imminent in August 1939, the Military Survey was mobilized and made ready to be attached to the individual commanding authorities within the Germany Army. These geodetic units followed the German army into field of operations that by 1942 occupied the vast majority of Europe and Northern Africa.\n\nFigure 2 Maximum Extent of Nazi Germany during World War 2 (image taken from wikipedia)\n\nFrom this military position work began on the establishment of a single unified geodetic framework for the whole of continental Europe (including Northern Africa). Hemmerich’s division uniquely had control of nearly every geodetic department in Europe and thus controlled the expansion of a wealth of knowledge and equipment that would allow the Germans to accurately survey Europe. It is this work, carried out by Hemmerich’s division during the Second World War, that sowed the seeds for the creation of the European Datum.\n\nHemmerich lost his commanding post on 05th April 1945 where he was resigned to the Führerreserve and later arrested and imprisoned by Allied forces until 04 June 1947.\n\nNext time we shall have a look at the development of the European Datum from the side of the allies and explore the story of the military intelligence division code named the HOUGHTEAM.\n\n[1]This discrepancy was one of the major factors that prompted the recomputation of all geodetic control in Western Europe after the First World War. The Bonne Grid “New Convention” is also referred to as the “Orange Report Net Grid” and was used through WWII until 1950.\n\nReferences\n\nCruickshank, J.
