This document is an introduction to a book titled \"An Album of Map Projections\" by John P. Snyder and Philip M. Voxland. It provides an overview of the book, which presents over 130 map projection systems through computer-generated outline maps and accompanying distortion diagrams. The introduction discusses how map projections have fascinated cartographers for millennia and the challenges of transforming the spherical Earth onto a flat surface. It notes that this collection presents more map projection systems and accompanying distortion diagrams than any other resource to aid in both teaching and understanding this topic.",
