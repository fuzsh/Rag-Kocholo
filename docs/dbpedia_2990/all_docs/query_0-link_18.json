'Karl Marx City') is the third-largest city in the German state of Saxony after Leipzig and Dresden. Chemnitz is the third-largest city in the Thuringian-Upper Saxon dialect area after Leipzig and Dresden. It is the fifth largest city in the area of former East Germany after (East) Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden and Halle. The city is part of the Central German Metropolitan Region, and lies in the middle of a string of cities sitting in the densely populated northern foreland of the Elster and Ore Mountains, stretching from Plauen in the southwest via Zwickau, Chemnitz and Freiberg to Dresden in the northeast.\n\nLocated in the Ore Mountain Basin, the city is surrounded by the Ore Mountains to the south and the Central Saxon Hill Country to the north. The city stands on the Chemnitz River, which is formed through the confluence of the rivers Zwönitz and Würschnitz in the borough of Altchemnitz.\n\nThe name of the city as well as the names of the rivers are of Slavic origin. The city's economy is based on the service sector and manufacturing industry. Chemnitz University of Technology has around 10,000 students.\n\nChemnitz was the richest city in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century, is known for its many industrial age buildings and monuments,[3] and will be the European Capital of Culture of 2025.[4]\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nChemnitz is named after the river Chemnitz, a small tributary of the Zwickau Mulde. The word \"Chemnitz\" is from the Sorbian language (Upper Sorbian: Kamjenica), and means \"stony [brook]\". The word is composed of the Slavic word kamen meaning \"stone\" and the feminine suffix -ica.\n\nIt is known in Czech as Saská Kamenice and in Polish as Kamienica Saska. There are many other towns named Kamienica or Kamenice in areas with past or present Slavic settlement.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Chemnitz.\n\nFree imperial city\n\n[edit]\n\nAn early Slavic tribe's settlement was located at Kamienica, and the first documented use of this name was in 1143, as the location of a Benedictine monastery around which a settlement grew. Around 1170, Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor granted this the rights of a free imperial city. Kamienica was later Germanised as Chemnitz.\n\nMeissen and Saxony\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1307, the town became subordinate to the Margraviate of Meissen, the predecessor of the Saxon state. In medieval times, Chemnitz became a centre of textile production and trade. More than one third of the population worked in textile production. In 1356 the Margraviate was succeeded by the Electorate of Saxony.\n\nGeologist Georgius Agricola (1494-1555), author of several significant works on mining and metallurgy including the landmark treatise De Re Metallica, became city physician of Chemnitz in 1533 and lived here until his death in 1555. In 1546 he was elected a Burgher of Chemnitz and in the same year also was appointed Burgomaster (lord mayor), serving again in 1547, 1551, and 1553. In spite of having been a leading citizen of the city, when Agricola died in 1555 the Protestant Duke denied him burial in the city's cathedral due to Agricola's allegiance to his Roman Catholic faith. Agricola's friends arranged for his remains to be buried in more sympathetic Zeitz, approximately 50 km away.[5] Chemnitz became a famous trading and textile manufacturing town.\n\nIn 1806, with the end of the Holy Roman Empire, the Electorate was renamed as the Kingdom of Saxony, and this survived until the revolutions of 1918 which followed the Armistice ending the First World War.\n\nBy the early 19th century, Chemnitz had become an industrial centre (sometimes called \"the Saxon Manchester\", German: Sächsisches Manchester, pronounced [ˈzɛksɪʃəs ˈmɛntʃɛstɐ] ⓘ). Important industrial companies were founded by Richard Hartmann, Louis Schönherr and Johann von Zimmermann. Chemnitz became a centre of innovation in the kingdom of Saxony and later in Germany. In 1913, Chemnitz had a population of 320,000 and, like Leipzig and Dresden, was larger at that time than today. After losing inhabitants due to the First World War Chemnitz grew rapidly again and reached its all-time peak of 360,250 inhabitants in 1930. Thereafter, growth was stalled by the world economic crisis.\n\nWeimar Republic\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a working-class industrial city, Chemnitz was a powerful center of socialist political organization after the First World War. At the foundation of the German Communist Party the local Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany voted by 1,000 votes to three to break from the party and join the Communist Party behind their local leaders, Fritz Heckert and Heinrich Brandler.[6] In March 1919 the German Communist Party had over 10,000 members in the city of Chemnitz.[7] Chemnitz was one of the big German industrial centers. Due to the export traffic a modern marshalling yard was erected 1929 in Chemnitz-Hilbersdorf. At that time it was a leading city in the European textile market. Auto Union (today Audi) was founded 1932 in Chemnitz.\n\nWorld War II\n\n[edit]\n\nAllied bombing destroyed 41 per cent of the built-up area of Chemnitz during the Second World War.[8] Chemnitz contained factories that produced military hardware and a Flossenbürg forced labor subcamp (500 female inmates) for Astra-Werke AG.[9] The oil refinery was a target for bombers during the Oil Campaign of World War II, and Operation Thunderclap attacks included the following raids:\n\n14/15 February 1945: The first major raid on Chemnitz used 717 RAF bombers, but due to cloud cover most bombs fell over open countryside.\n\n2/3–5 March: USAAF bombers attacked the marshalling yards.[10]\n\n5 March: 760 RAF bombers attacked.\n\nThe city was occupied by Soviet troops on 8 May 1945.\n\nThe headquarters of the auto manufacturer Auto Union was based in Chemnitz from 1932 and its buildings were badly damaged. At the end of the war, the company's executives fled and relocated the company in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, where it evolved into Audi, now a brand within the Volkswagen group.\n\nThe World War II bombings left most of the city centre in ruins and post-war, the East German reconstruction included large low-rise (and later high-rise Plattenbau) housing. Some tourist sites were reconstructed during the East German era and after German reunification. Today over 50 % of the city´s buildings date back to before 1950.[11]\n\nGDR\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Länder (states) in the GDR in 1952, Chemnitz became seat of a district (Bezirk). On 10 May 1953, the city was renamed by decision of the East German government to Karl-Marx-Stadt (German: Karl Marx City) after Karl Marx, in recognition of its industrial heritage and the Karl Marx Year marking the 135th anniversary of his birth and the 70th anniversary of his death.[12] GDR Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl said:\n\nThe people who live here do not look back, but look forward to a new and better future. They look at socialism. They look with love and devotion to the founder of the socialist doctrine, the greatest son of the German people, to Karl Marx. I hereby fulfill the government's decision. I carry out the solemn act of renaming the city and declare: From now on, this city bears the proud and mandatory name Karl-Marx-Stadt.[13]\n\nAfter the city centre was destroyed in World War II, the East German authorities attempted to rebuild it to symbolise the conceptions of urban development of a socialist city. The layout of the city centre at that time was rejected in favour of a new road network. However, the original plans were not completed. In addition, the rapid development of housing took priority over the preservation of old buildings. So in the 1960s and 1970s, both in the centre as well as the periphery, large areas were built in Plattenbau apartment-block style, for example Yorckstraße. The old buildings of the period, which still existed especially in the Kassberg, Chemnitz-Sonnenberg [de] and Chemnitz-Schloßchemnitz [de] quarters, were neglected and fell increasingly into dereliction.[citation needed]\n\nAfter reunification\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 23 April 1990, a referendum on the future name of the city was held: 76% of the voters voted for the old name \"Chemnitz\". On 1 June 1990, the city was officially renamed.[14]\n\nAfter the reunification of Germany on 3 October 1990, the city of Chemnitz faced several difficult tasks. Many inhabitants migrated to the former West Germany and unemployment in the region increased sharply; in addition Chemnitz did not have adequate shopping facilities, but this was increasingly demanded.[15] Large shopping centers were constructed on the city periphery to the early 1990s.\n\nChemnitz is the only major German city whose centre was re-planned after 1990, similar to the reconstruction of several other German cities in the immediate post-war years. Plans for the recovery of a compressed city centre around the historic town hall in 1991 led to an urban design competition. This was announced internationally by the city and carried out with the help of the partner city of Düsseldorf. The mooted project on an essentially unused area of the former city would be comparable in circumference with the Potsdamer Platz in Berlin.[15]\n\nNumerous internationally renowned architects such as Hans Kollhoff, Helmut Jahn and Christoph Ingenhoven provided designs for a new city centre. The mid-1990s began the development of the inner city brownfield around the town hall to a new town. In Chemnitz city more than 66,000 square meters of retail space have emerged. With the construction of office and commercial building on the construction site \"B3\" at the Düsseldorf court, the last gap in 2010 was closed in city centre image. The intensive development included demolition of partially historically valuable buildings from the period and was controversial.[16][17] Between 1990 and 2007 more than 250 buildings were leveled.[citation needed]\n\nIn late August 2018 the city was the site of a series of protests that attracted at least 8,000 people. The protests were attended by far-right and Neo-Nazi groups. News outlets reported about mob violence and riots. The protests started after two immigrants from the Middle East were arrested in connection with the murder of Daniel H., a 35 year old German man, the son of a German mother and a Cuban father, which had happened on 26 August. Violent clashes occurred between far-right protesters and far-left counter protesters, leading to injuries. The mobs outnumbered the local police presence. There were reports that rightist protesters chased down dark skinned bystanders and those that appeared to be foreigners on the streets before more police arrived and intervened. The riots were widely condemned by media outlets and politicians throughout Germany, and were \"described as reminiscent of civil war and Nazi pogroms.\"[18][19][20][21]\n\nThe reports of mob violence and riots were criticized as incorrect later on. The German language Swiss newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung corrected its earlier reports, stating that there had evidently been no mob violence but there have been sporadic encroachments.[22] Minister President of Saxony Michael Kretschmer came to the same conclusion: \"there were no mobs and man hunts\".[23]\n\nOne week after the protests, a free \"Concert against the Right\" under the motto \"We are more\" (#wirsindmehr) attracted an audience of some 65,000 people.[24] A one-minute silence commemorated the murdered Daniel H., the son of a German mother and a Cuban father.[25] The concert itself has been criticized for far-left activities and violent song texts of some of the participating bands.[26][27]\n\nCulture and sights\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city won the bid to be one of the two European Capitals of Culture (in 2025) on 28 October 2020, beating Hanover, Hildesheim, Magdeburg and Nuremberg.[28]\n\nTheater Chemnitz offers a variety of theatre: opera (opera house from 1909), plays, ballet and Figuren (puppets), and runs concerts by the orchestra Robert-Schumann-Philharmonie (founded 1832).\n\nTourist sights include the Kassberg neighborhood with 18th and 19th century buildings and the Karl Marx Monument by Lev Kerbel, nicknamed Nischel (a Saxon dialect word for head) by the locals. Landmarks include the Old Town Hall with its Renaissance portal (15th century), the castle on the site of the former monastery, and the area around the opera house and the old university. The most conspicuous landmark is the red tower built in the late 12th or early 13th century as part of the city wall.\n\nThe Chemnitz petrified forest is located in the courtyard of Kulturkaufhaus Tietz. It is one of the very few in existence, and dates back several million years (details shown in the Museum of Natural Sciences \"Museum für Naturkunde Chemnitz\", founded 1859). Also within the city limits, in the district of Rabenstein, is the smallest castle in Saxony, Rabenstein Castle.\n\nThe city has changed considerably since German reunification. Most of its industry is now gone and the core of the city has been rebuilt with many shops as well as huge shopping centres. Many of these shops are international brands, including Zara, H&M, Esprit, Galeria Kaufhof, Leiser Shoes, and Peek & Cloppenburg. The large Galerie Roter Turm (Red Tower) shopping centre is very popular with young people.\n\nThe Chemnitz Industrial Museum is an Anchor Point of ERIH, the European Route of Industrial Heritage. Additional unique industrial monuments are located at the \"Schauplatz Eisenbahn\" (Saxon Railway Museum and Museum of Technology Cable Running System) in Chemnitz-Hilbersdorf. The State Museum of Archaeology Chemnitz[29] opened in 2014 and is located in the former Schocken Department Stores (architect: Erich Mendelsohn; opening of the department store: 1930).\n\nThe Museum Gunzenhauser, formerly a bank, opened on 1 December 2007. Alfred Gunzenhauser, who lived in Munich, had a collection of some 2,500 pieces of modern art, including many paintings and drawings by Otto Dix, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff and others. The other great art museum in Chemnitz is located near central railway station, it is called \"Museum am Theaterplatz\" (erected 1909 as \"König-Albert-Museum\"). The Botanischer Garten Chemnitz is a municipal botanical garden, and the Arktisch-Alpiner Garten der Walter-Meusel-Stiftung is a non-profit garden specializing in arctic and alpine plants. Near the city center is the \"Villa Esche\" located (Henry-van-de-Velde-museum). This historical house was built in 1902 in art-nouveau-style by van de Velde.\n\nThe City is home of the SCHLINGEL International Film Festival, a yearly festival created in 1996 and that focuses on cinema for young audiences.[30]\n\nImage gallery\n\n[edit]\n\nOld and new city hall\n\nRed tower\n\nChemnitz Opera at Opernplatz\n\nSt. Petri church\n\nLutheran church\n\nCastle church over the Castle Lake\n\nThe Mercure Hotel, tallest building in Chemnitz\n\nThe Transparent department store\n\nView over Falkeplatz at night\n\nBust of Karl Marx, the city's former namesake\n\nGründerzeit quarter Kaßberg\n\nView over the city halls and the inner city\n\nChemnitz-Kulturhaus\n\nWatercastle Klaffenbach\n\nChemnitz Stadtbad\n\nGuest houses at Castle park\n\nState Museum of Archaeology Chemnitz\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city of Chemnitz consists of 39 neighborhoods. The neighborhoods of Einsiedel, Euba, Grüna, Klaffenbach, Kleinolbersdorf-Altenhain, Mittelbach, Röhrsdorf and Wittgensdorf are at the same time localities within the meaning of Sections 65 to 68 of the Saxon Municipal Code. These neighborhoods came in the wake of the last incorporation wave after 1990 as formerly independent municipalities to the city of Chemnitz and therefore enjoy this special position compared to the other parts of the city. These localities each have a local council, which, depending on the number of inhabitants of the locality concerned, comprises between ten and sixteen members as well as a chairman of the same. The local councils are to hear important matters concerning the locality. A final decision is, however, incumbent on the city council of the city of Chemnitz.[32] The official identification of the districts by numbers is based on the following principle: Starting from the city center (neighborhoods Zentrum and Schloßchemnitz), all other parts of the city are assigned clockwise in ascending order the tenth place of their index, the one-digit is awarded in the direction of city periphery in ascending order.\n\nThe city area does not include a unified, closed settlement area after numerous incorporations. The rural settlements of mainly eastern districts are separated from the settlement area of the Chemnitz city center, whereas this partly continues over the western city limits to Limbach-Oberfrohna and Hohenstein-Ernstthal.\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nMayor\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first freely elected mayor after German reunification was Dieter Noll of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), who served from 1990 to 1991, followed by Joachim Pilz (CDU) until 1993. The mayor was originally chosen by the city council, but since 1994 has been directly elected. Peter Seifert of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) served from 1993 until 2006. Between 2006 and 2020 Barbara Ludwig (SPD) has served as mayor. Sven Schulze (SPD) was elected mayor in 2020.[1]\n\nThe most recent mayoral election was held on 20 September 2020, with a runoff held on 11 October, and the results were as follows:\n\nCandidate Party First round Second round Votes % Votes % Sven Schulze Social Democratic Party 22,241 23.1 31,749 34.9 Almut Patt Christian Democratic Union 20,630 21.4 20,047 22.0 Susanne Schaper The Left 14,584 15.1 14,668 16.1 Ulrich Oehme Alternative for Germany 11,731 12.2 12,034 13.2 Lars Faßmann Independent 11,470 11.9 12,515 13.8 Volkmar Zschocke Alliance 90/The Greens 6,811 7.1 Withdrew Matthias Eberlein Free Voters 3,394 3.5 Withdrew Paul Vogel Die PARTEI 1,527 1.6 Withdrew Valid votes 96,428 99.5 91,017 99.7 Invalid votes 489 0.5 285 0.3 Total 96,917 100.0 91,302 100.0 Electorate/voter turnout 194,952 49.7 194,850 46.9 Source: Wahlen in Sachsen\n\nCity council\n\n[edit]\n\nThe most recent city council election was held on 26 May 2019, and the results were as follows:\n\nParty Votes % +/- Seats +/- Christian Democratic Union (CDU) 69,195 20.0 4.5 13 2 Alternative for Germany (AfD) 62,053 17.9 12.3 11 8 The Left (Die Linke) 58,009 16.7 6.9 10 5 Social Democratic Party (SPD) 40,357 11.6 7.9 7 5 Alliance 90/The Greens (Grüne) 39,908 11.5 3.6 7 2 Pro Chemnitz/German Social Union (PRO.DSU) 26,606 7.7 2.0 5 2 Free Democratic Party (FDP) 25,623 7.4 1.9 4 1 Die PARTEI (PARTEI) 10,260 3.0 2.4 1 1 People's Solidarity (Vosi) 7,862 2.3 0.8 1 1 Pirate Party Germany (Piraten) 6,817 2.0 0.1 1 ±0 Valid votes 118,548 98.5 Invalid votes 1,837 1.5 Total 120,385 100.0 60 ±0 Electorate/voter turnout 196,515 61.3 17.2 Source: Wahlen in Sachsen\n\nUrban renewal\n\n[edit]\n\nHeavy destruction in World War II as well as post-war demolition to erect a truly socialist city centre left the city with a vast open space around its town hall where once a vibrant city heart had been. Because of massive investment in out-of-town shopping right after reunification, it was not until 1999 that major building activity was started in the centre. Comparable to Potsdamer Platz in Berlin, a whole new quarter of the city was constructed in recent years. New buildings include the Kaufhof department store by Helmut Jahn, Galerie Roter Turm with a façade by Hans Kollhoff and Peek & Cloppenburg clothing store by Ingenhofen and Partner.\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nChemnitz is the largest city of the Chemnitz-Zwickau urban area and is one of the most important economic areas of Germany's new federal states. Chemnitz had a GDP of €8.456 billion in 2016, with GDP per capita at €34,166.[33] Since about 2000, the city's economy has recorded high annual GDP growth rates; Chemnitz is among the top ten German cities in terms of growth rate. The local and regional economic structure is characterized by medium-sized companies, with the heavy industrial sectors of mechanical engineering, metal processing, and vehicle manufacturing as the most significant industries.\n\nAbout 100,000 people are employed, of whom about 46,000 commute from other municipalities.[34] 16.3% of employees in Chemnitz have a university or college degree, twice the average rate in Germany.\n\nImage gallery\n\n[edit]\n\nVolkswagen is the largest employer in the Chemnitz-Zwickau Agglomeration.\n\nThe Klinikum Chemnitz GmbH is the largest hospital in the former East German states and the second biggest employer in Chemnitz.\n\nChemnitz is a shopping destination.

The population of Chemnitz grow rapidly since the early 1900s due to its industrialization. Chemnitz reached its highest peak of population in 1930 with population of about 362,000. Chemnitz in the East Germany era when the city was called \"Karl-Marx-Stadt\", it became a significant industrial city known for it textile and leather industries. Chemnitz was also the 4th largest city in then East Germany after East Berlin, Leipzig and Dresden. After the German Reunification Chemnitz faced a significant population decrease. Since 1988 Chemnitz has lost about 20 percent of its inhabitants. Chemnitz's population decreased from 300,000 in 1989 to under 250,000 in 2003, which made Chemnitz one of the cities with most population loss in Germany. Chemnitz's population started to grow again in the 2010s due to its immigration from mostly war active countries like Syria but it faced a problem due to many right-wing extremists and active Neo-Nazi groups where many foreigners experience racism and moved away from Chemnitz. The city had a fertility rate of 1.64 in 2015.[36]\n\nForeign population in Chemnitz by nationality as of 31 December 2022:[citation needed]\n\nRank Nationality Population (31.12.2022) 1 Ukraine 3,465 2 Syria 2,915 3 Poland 2,340 4 Afghanistan 1,460 5 Czech Republic 1,384 6 Romania 1,287 7 Hungary 1,246 8 India 1,235 9 Russia 1,145 10 Serbia 1,077\n\nA large contributor to the city's foreign population is Chemnitz University of Technology. In 2017, out of its 10,482 students, 2712 were foreign students, which equals to about 25%, making Chemnitz the most internationalised of the three major universities of Saxony.[37]\n\nLanguages\n\n[edit]\n\nStandard German\n\nChemnitz dialect, which is a variety of Upper Saxon German[38]\n\nTransport\n\n[edit]\n\nRoads\n\n[edit]\n\nChemnitz is linked to two motorways (Autobahns), A4 Erfurt – Dresden and A72 Hof – Leipzig. The motorway junction Kreuz Chemnitz is situated in the northwestern area of the city. The motorway A72 between Borna and Leipzig is still under construction. Within the administrative area of Chemnitz there are eight motorway exits (Ausfahrt). The A4 motorway is part of the European route E40, one of the longest European E roads, connecting Chemnitz with the Asian Highway system to the east and France to the west.\n\nPublic transport\n\n[edit]\n\nPublic transport within Chemnitz is provided with tram and bus, as well as by the Stadtbahn. Nowadays, the city and its surroundings are served by one Stadtbahn line, five lines of the Chemnitz tramway network, 27 city bus lines, as well as several regional bus lines. At night, the city is served by two bus lines, two tram lines, and the Stadtbahn line.\n\nChemnitz Hauptbahnhof is the main station for the city. In June 2022, an intercity connection from Chemnitz via Dresden and Berlin to Rostock-Warnemünde was established again for the first time since 2006. Prior to this, Chemnitz was for a long time the largest German city without a connection of long-distance intercity services. 2 RegionalExpress routes connected Chemnitz to the larger cities of Saxony (RE3 from Dresden Hbf via Chemnitz to Hof & RE6 to Leipzig Hbf). In addition, 4 RegionalBahn and 4 CityBahn routes also operate from the Hauptbahnhof.\n\nThe length of the tram, Stadtbahn and bus networks is 28.73 km (17.85 mi), 16.3 km (10.13 mi) and 326.08 km (202.62 mi) respectively. In August 2012, electro-diesel trams were ordered from Vossloh, to support an expansion of the light rail network to 226 km (140 mi), with new routes serving Burgstädt, Mittweida and Hainichen.[39]\n\nAirports\n\n[edit]\n\nThree airports are near Chemnitz, including the two international airports of Saxony in Dresden and Leipzig. Both Leipzig/Halle Airport and Dresden Airport are about 70 km (43 mi) from Chemnitz and offer numerous continental as well as intercontinental flights.\n\nChemnitz also has a small commercial airport (Flugplatz Chemnitz-Jahnsdorf [de] about 13.5 km (8.4 mi) south of the city.
