        "text": "The late Professor Emeritus Waldo Tobler recently published a short paper, A Companion for Mercator (TOBLER, 2017). He was inspired by the often inappropriate use of the Mercator projection and suggested an alternative equal-area projection. The equations of the Tobler Mercator map projection maintain the Mercator projection ranges between the parallels, with adjusted forms of the meridians. All territories, though drastically deformed by shape, cover their exact surface areas. Inspired by Tobler&#39;s approach, this paper proposes an alternative equidistant projection. The equations of this projection also preserve the Mercator projection ranges between the parallels, with the customized forms of meridians. Thus, a new companion of the Mercator projection has been created - a pseudocylindrical projection equidistant along the parallels. Formulas that describe the distortions of the Mercator projection and its companions have also been derived.\n\nIn modern cartography, Mercator&#39;s conformal cylindrical map pro- jection is mathematically described by equations which involve logarithmic and trigonometric functions. It is evident that calculus and difierential geometry are necessary for the derivation of these equations. The very fact that Mercator&#39;s map was published in 1569, long before logarithms and calculus were invented, conflrms that Mercator created his famous map projection somehow directly | by some simple and plain geometrical constructions. This paper exposes one possible constructive graphical method by which the direct geometrical synthesis of Merca- tor&#39;s conformal cylindrical map projection can be accomplished. We believe that the original inventive process used by Gerhard Kremer Mercator in creation of his famous world map was at least similar or compatible to the method exposed in this paper.\n\nThe analyzed projections from this paper are cartographical projections of great importance in practice, solving cartographical problems regarding map drawing based on practical needs. These are the ones referring to terrain surfaces that will be represented, to the accuracy that must be obtained, as well as the ways to accomplish favorable and precise links with other kinds of cartographical projections. Cylindrical Projection (Mercator): is based on a cylinder tangent to the equator. Good for equatorial regions but greatly distorted at high latitudes. This one of the oldest and most common projectionsThe maps in Mercator projection have a great importance in maritime and air navigation, due to the fact that it is a conform projection and the cartographic network formed in perpendicular lines, the loxodrome will be a straight line. The same line makes with each projection of the meridians the same azimuth. The UTM system that uses the Mercator projection can be used all over the wo...\n\nThere is no standard or generally accepted terminology of aspect in the theory of map projections. The term is probably derived from the concept that a graticule is produced by perspective projection of the meridians and parallels on a sphere onto a developable surface. Developable surfaces are widely accepted, and it is almost impossible to find a publication that deals with map projections in general and without developable surfaces story. If found, it usually classifies projections as cylindrical, conical and azimuthal, and applies developable surfaces to define the projection aspect. This paper explains why applying developable surfaces in the interpretation of map projections is not recommended, nor defining the aspect of all projections by the position of a midpoint as polar, equatorial, or oblique. In fact, defining a projection aspect this way is invalid in general, and obscures the fact that the aspect depends on the class to which a particular map projection belongs.\n\nMany important persons gave their contribution to development of theory and practice of map projections through the history. In scripts of professor Fran√®ula on map projections, more than 100 individuals were mentioned by whose credit today we have a great number of map projections and possibility of their usage. Basic information about around twenty persons important for the development of map projections over two and a half millennia were gathered and arranged in this paper. In addition, a historical review of map projections is given, and procedure of world map creation which served as illustration is explained."
