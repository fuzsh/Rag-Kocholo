        "text": "1. Type of projection Cylindrical In standard presentation, these map regularly-spaced meridians to equally spaced vertical lines, and parallelsto horizontallines. Pseudocylindrical In standard presentation, these map the central meridian and parallels as straight lines. Other meridians are curves (or possibly straight from poleto equator), regularly spaced along parallels. Conic In standard presentation, conic (or conical)projections map meridians as straight lines, and parallelsas arcs of circles. Pseudoconical In standard presentation, pseudoconicalprojectionsrepresent the central meridian as a straight line, othermeridians as complex curves, and parallels as circular arcs.\n\n2. Azimuthal In standard presentation, azimuthal projectionsmap meridians as straight lines and parallelsas complete, concentriccircles. They are radially symmetrical. In any presentation (or aspect), they preserve directionsfrom the center point. This means great circles through the central point are represented by straight lines on the map. Pseudoazimuthal In standard presentation, pseudoazimuthalprojectionsmap the equatorand central meridian to perpendicular,intersecting straight lines. They map parallelsto complex curves bowing away from the equator,and meridians to complex curves bowing in toward the central meridian. Listed here after pseudocylindrical as generally similar to them in shape and purpose. Other Typically calculatedfrom formula, and not based on a particularprojection Polyhedral maps\n\n3. Polyhedral maps can be folded up into a polyhedral approximation to the sphere, using particularprojection to map each face with low distortion. Properties Conformal Preserves angles locally, implying that local shapes are not distorted and that local scale is constant in all directions from any chosen point. Equal-area Area measure is conserved everywhere. Compromise\n\n4. Neither conformal nor equal-area, but a balanceintended to reduceoverall distortion. Equidistant All distances from one (or two) points are correct. Other equidistant propertiesare mentioned in the notes. Gnomonic All great circles are straight lines. Retroazimuthal Direction to a fixed location B (by the shortest route)correspondsto the direction on the map from A to B. The UTM systemdividesthe Earthinto60 zones,each6° of longitude inwidth. Zone 1coverslongitude 180° to 174° W; zone numbering increaseseastwardto zone 60, whichcoverslongitude174°E to 180°. The polarregionssouthof 80°S and northof 84°N are excluded\n\n5. UTM zone The UTM system divides the Earth into 60 zones, each 6° of longitude in width. Zone 1 covers longitude 180° to 174° W; zone numbering increases eastward to zone 60, which covers longitude 174°E to 180°. The polar regions south of 80°S and north of 84°N are excluded. Each of the 60 zones uses a transverse Mercator projection that can map a region of large north-south extent with low distortion. By using narrow zones of 6° of longitude (up to 668 km) in width, and reducing the scale factor along the central meridian to 0.9996 (a reduction of 1:2500), the amount of distortion is held below 1 part in 1,000 inside each zone. Distortion of scale increases to 1.0010 at the zone boundaries along the equator. In each zone the scale factor of the central meridian reduces the diameter of the transverse cylinder to produce a secant projection with two standard lines, or lines of true scale, about 180 km on each side of, and about parallel to, the central meridian (Arc cos 0.9996 = 1.62° at the Equator). The scale is less than 1 inside the standard lines and greater than 1 outside them, but the overall distortion is minimized. Overlapping grids Distortionof scale increasesineachUTM zone as the boundariesbetweenthe UTMzonesare approached.However,itisoften convenientornecessarytomeasure aseriesof locationsonasingle gridwhensome are locatedintwoadjacentzones.Aroundthe boundariesof large scale maps(1:100,000 or larger) coordinatesforbothadjoiningUTMzonesare usuallyprintedwithinaminimum distance of 40 km oneitherside of a zone boundary.Ideally,the coordinatesof eachpositionshouldbe measuredon the gridforthe zone inwhichtheyare located,butbecause the scale factorisstill relativelysmallnearzone boundaries,itispossibletooverlap measurementsintoanadjoiningzone forsome distance whennecessary.\n\n6. Locating a position using UTM coordinates A position on the Earth is given by the UTM zone number and the easting and northing planar coordinate pair in that zone. The point of origin of each UTM zone is the intersection of the equator and the zone's central meridian. To avoid dealing with negative numbers, the central meridian of each zone is defined to coincide with 500000 meters East. In any zone a point that has an easting of 400000 meters is about 100 km west of the central meridian. For most such points, the true distance would be slightly more than 100 km as\n\n7. measured on the surface of the Earth because of the distortion of the projection. UTM eastings range from about 167000 meters to 833000 meters at the equator. In the northern hemisphere positions are measured northward from zero at the equator. The maximum \"northing\" value is about 9300000 meters at latitude 84 degrees North, the north end of the UTM zones. In the southern hemisphere northings decrease southward from the equator, set at 10000000 meters, to about 1100000 meters at 80 degrees South, the south end of the UTM zones. For the southern hemisphere, its northing at the equator is set at 10000000 meters so no point has a negative northing value. The CN Tower is at 43°38′33.24″N 79°23′13.7″W, which is in UTM zone 17, and the grid position is 630084 m east, 4833438 m north. Two points in Zone 17 have these coordinates, one in the northern hemisphere and one in the south; one of two conventions is used to say which: 1. Append a hemisphere designator to the zone number, \"N\" or \"S\", thus \"17N 630084 4833438\". This supplies the minimum information to define the position uniquely. 2. Supply the grid zone, i.e., the latitude band designator appended to the zone number, thus \"17T 630084 4833438\". The provision of the latitude band along with northing supplies redundant information (which may, as a consequence, be contradictory if misused). Because latitude band \"S\" is in the northern hemisphere, a designation such as \"38S\" is unclear. The \"S\" might refer to the latitude band (32°N–40°N) or it might mean \"South\". It is therefore important to specify which convention is being used, e.g., by spelling out the hemisphere, \"North\" or \"South\", or using different symbols, such as − for south and + for north.
