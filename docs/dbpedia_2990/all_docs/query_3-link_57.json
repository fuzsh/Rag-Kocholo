Cartographer Murdoch McKenzie was born in a place known as Orkney. Besides being a renowned mapmaker of the modern era, he was a popular hydrographer (a man who has expertise in oceanography) too.\n\nHis Career and Achievements\n\nMurdoch McKenzie, the hydrographer had served the Royal Navy. While working there he gained more insight into the studies and works involving cartography and hydrogaphy. It is a well known fact that Murdoch McKenzie, the mapmaker contributed enormously in the arena of cartography or map- making. He was considered as a savior of all the water crafts or vessels, which was put to good use in the coastline around North Ronaldsay. It was Murdoch McKenzie, who used his intellectual prowess to identify the coastline, which was located in the vicinity of North Ronaldsay. After he discovered the coastline, near to North Ronaldsay, a lighthouse at Dennis Head was immediately constructed. Thus, this was a relief to many ships in the future."
