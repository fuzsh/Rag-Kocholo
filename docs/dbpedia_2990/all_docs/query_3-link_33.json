        "text": "About.cdr\n\nAbout.cdr\n\nThe 'Map Projection Catalog' (see link below) is presenting a collection of 324 Map Projection Graphics !\n\nA few of them are implemented in my Java applet.\n\nThe algorithms to compute bearings, distance, midpoint, and destination are from Movable Type Ltd (see link below).\n\nSelect a map projection frpm the menu:\n\nCompute distance and bearings between to points given by latitude and longitude:\n\nSelect Latitude 1, Longitude 1 of point 1 ( ), and Latitude 2, Longitude 2 of point 2 ( ).\n\nThe distance (kilometers) is computed along a great-circle between the two points.\n\nThe Midpoint is the center of the two points on the great-circle.\n\nMax. Lat. is the latitude of the closest point of the complete great circle to the north pole.\n\nThe loxodromic path is drawn by 9 intermediate point.\n\nCompute destination point given distance and bearing from start point:\n\nBearings are in the range 0° to 360°, clockwise from North (90°=E, 180°=S, 270°=W).\n\nThe Earth's radius is assumed to be 6371 km.\n\nThe value of \"Scale\" is the ratio of the great circe distance of the two points (km) and the length of the black line connecting the points on the plane of projection (pixels).\n\nCompute loxodrome given bearing from start point:\n\nSelect Latitude 1, Longitude 1, and the bearing of the loxodrome. The path is computed and marked every 100 km (larger mark every 500 km), for a total length of 40,000 km.\n\nFor some maps a standard parallel can be chosen, where the projection shows no distortion:\n\nNumerical output:\n\nMap Angle is the azimuth (bearing) from North of the line connecting start and destination point on the map. The orthodromic distance or great-circle distance is the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere. On a great circle, the bearing to the destination point does not remain constant. A loxodrome or rhumb line is an arc crossing all meridians of longitude at the same angle, i.e. a path with constant bearing as measured relative to true or magnetic north.\n\nRhumb lines which cut meridians at oblique angles are loxodromic curves which spiral towards the poles. Scale P1 --> P2 is the ratio of the orthodromic distance and the distance D on the map.\n\nThe ratios N-S and E-W are referring to ±5° from the intersection point of the central meridian and the equator. AM0 is the area on the map (in pix^2) of a 10°-square around the intersection point of the central meridian and the equator.\n\nAE0 is the area on the Earth (in km^2) of a 10°-square around the intersection point of the central meridian and the equator.\n\nAM0/AE0 is the ratio in units of pix2/km2. The green area (e.g. 10° by 10°) is selected by the latitude and longitude menues.\n\nThe area AE on the Earth is computed by the length of the corresponding meridian (1111.9 km per 10° of latitude), and the mean length of the limiting parallels.\n\nThe area AM on the map is approximated by the quadrilateral, and computed by the coordinates:\n\nA=0.5*|[(x3-x1)(y4-y2) +(x4-x2)(y1-y3)]|.\n\nYou can check the equal-area property of a map projection by comparing the AM/AE quantity of 10°x10° quadrilaterals.\n\n1. Stabius-Werner\n\nThe originators were Johannes Werner (14661528), a parish priest in Nuremberg, refined and promoted this projection that had been developed earlier by Johannes Stabius (Stab) of Vienna around 1500.\n\nProperties:\n\nDistances are correct from one pole, as well as along all parallels.\n\nArea preserving (Equal-Area).\n\nParallels are concentric circles about the North Pole.\n\nNo distortion along the central meridian.\n\nrho= 90° - latitude\n\nE = longitude*cos(latitude)/rho\n\nx = r*sin(E)\n\ny = 90 - r*rho*cos(E)\n\n2. Mercator\n\nThe Mercator projection is a cylindrical map projection presented by the Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator (Geert de Kremer) in 1569.\n\nProperties:\n\nLines of constant course, known as rhumb lines or loxodromes, are represented as straight segments that conserve the angles with the meridians.\n\nConformal: preserving the angles and the shapes of small objects.\n\nDistorts the size of objects as the latitude increases from the Equator.\n\nK = π/180\n\nx = K*longitude\n\ny = 0.5*r*log[(1+sin(K*latitude))/(1-sin(K*latitude))]\n\n3. Schmid Net\n\nThe projection can only represent one hemisphere of the earth.\n\nProperties:\n\nArea preserving (Equal-Area)\n\nangle distorting: most of the grid lines do not intersect at right angles.\n\npx = cos(latitude)*sin(longitude/2)\n\npz = cos(latitude)*cos(longitude/2)\n\nx = 2*r*px/sqrt(1+pz)\n\npy = sin(latitude)\n\npz = cos(latitude)*cos(longitude/2)\n\ny = r*py/sqrt(1+pz)\n\n4. Hammer-Aitow\n\nThis projection was described by Ernst von Hammer in 1892. It displays the world within a 2:1 elliptical outer shape, and is used even today for world maps.\n\nProperties:\n\nEqual-Area\n\n2:1 elliptical outer shape\n\nThe vertical coordinates (longitude) are divided by two, and the values of the meridians from the center are doubled:\n\npx = cos(latitude)*sin(longitude/2)\n\npz = cos(latitude)*cos(longitude/2)\n\nx = 2*r*px/sqrt(1+pz)\n\npy = sin(latitude)\n\npz = cos(latitude)*cos(longitude/2)\n\ny = r*py/sqrt(1+pz)\n\n5. Stereographic\n\nx = r*cos(latitude)*cos(longitude)\n\ny = r*sin(latitude)\n\n6. Winkel's Tripel\n\nWinkel's Tripel projection is one of three projections proposed by Oswald Winkel in 1921. The projection is It is the arithmetic mean of the equirectangular projection and the Aitoff projection:\n\nWinkel's Tripel alhorithm averages x and y-coordinates of the equidistant cylindrical projection, this time with the Aitoff projection's.\n\nProperties:\n\nNot equal-area, not conformal.\n\nParallels are straight at Equator and poles, curved elsewhere;\n\nscales are constant, but not equal, only at the Equator and central meridian.\n\nK = π/180\n\nalpha = arccos(cos(latitude)*cos(0.5*longitude))\n\nsi = sin(alpha)/(alpha/K)\n\nWith the conventional standard parallel: phi1=±2/π\n\nWith the equator as the standard parallel: phi1=0;\n\nx = R*0.5*[longitude*cos(phi1) + 2*cos(latitude)*sin(0.5*latitude)/si]\n\ny = R*0.5*[latitude + sin(latitude)]/si)\n\n7. Mollweide\n\nThe projection was first published by mathematician and astronomer Karl Brandan Mollweide (1774  1825) of Leipzig in 1805.\n\nProperties:\n\n2:1 elliptical outer shape\n\nEqual-Area\n\naccuracy of proportions in area\n\nRx = 2*sqrt(2)/π\n\nRy = sqrt(2)\n\nK = π/180\n\nx =Rx*lambda*K*cos(t)\n\ny =Ry*sin(t)\n\nt is given by the equation: 2*t + sin(2*t) = π*sin(latitude),\n\nwhich has to be solved by an iteration:\n\ntn+1 = tn - [2*tn + sin(2*tn) - π*sin(latitude)] / [2 + 2*cos(2*tn*k))]\n\n8. Littrow\n\nThis projection was developed by Joseph Johann von Littrow in 1833.\n\nIt is the only conformal retroazimuthal map projection. As a retroazimuthal projection, the Littrow shows directions, or azimuths, correctly from any point to the center of the map.\n\nx = R*sin(longitude)/cos(latitude)\n\ny = R*cos(longitude)*tan(latitude)\n\n9. Van der Grinten\n\nThe Van-der-Grinten projection was published in 1904 by Alphons J. van der Grinten (18521921).\n\nIt projects the entire Earth into a circle\n\nProperties:\n\nnot equal-area\n\nnot conformal\n\npolar regions are subject to extreme distortion\n\nk = π/180\n\nphi=K*phi;\n\nlambda=K*longitude;\n\nA = 0.5*abs(π/longitude - longitude/π)\n\ntheta = arcsin(2*latitude/π);\n\nG = cos(theta)/(sin(theta)+cos(theta)-1)\n\nP = G*(2/sin(theta)-1)\n\nN = P*P+A*A\n\nQ = A*A+G\n\nx = R*π*(A*(G-P*P) + sqrt(A*A*(G-P*P)*(G-P*P)-N*(G*G-P*P)))/N\n\ny = R*π*(P*Q - A*sqrt((A*A+1.0)*N-Q*Q))/N\n\n10. Lambert Equatorial Azimuthal Equal-Area\n\nroot = R*sqrt[2/(1 + cos(latitude)*cos(longitude))]\n\nx = root*sin(longitude)*cos(latitude)\n\ny = root*sin(latitude)\n\n11. Lambert Equatorial Azimuthal Equidistant\n\nalpha = arccos[cos(latitude)*cos(longitude)]\n\nx = alpha*R*cos(latitude)*sin(longitude)/sin(alpha)\n\ny = alpha*R*sin(latitude)/sin(alpha)\n\n12. Braun\n\nThis stereographic cylindrical projection was designed by Carl Braun (1867).\n\nProperties:\n\nasymmetric scaling horizontally and vertically\n\nK = π/180\n\nx = R*K*longitude\n\ny = 2*R*tan(latitude/2)\n\n13. Sinusoidal\n\nThe sinusoidal projection is a pseudocylindrical equal-area map projection, sometimes called the SansonFlamsteed or the Mercator equal-area projection.\n\nProperties:\n\nequal-area\n\nx = R*longitude*cos(latitude)\n\ny = R*latitude\n\n14. Eckert III\n\nMax Eckert-Greifendorff presented six map projections in 1906. The latitudes are parallel lines in all six projections. In Eckert III meridians are elliptical, the outermost are semicircles, and the length of the central meridian is half the length of the equator.\n\nProperties:\n\nnot equal-area\n\nnot conformal\n\nx = 0.5*R*longitude*[1 + sqrt(1-latitude2/902)]\n\ny = R*latitude\n\n15. Gnomonic\n\nA points on the surface of the Earth's sphere is projected from the sphere's center to a point in a plane that is tangent.\n\nAntipodal points appear at the same point in the plane. Thefore it can only be used to project one hemisphere.\n\nx = R*tan(longitude)\n\ny = R*tan(latitude)/cos(longitude)\n\n16. Polyconic\n\nK = π/180\n\nE = longitude*sin(latitude)\n\nx = R*sin(E)/tan(latitude)\n\ny = R*[K*latitude + (1 - cos(E))/tan(latitude)]\n\n17. Albers\n\nThis projection was published in 1805 by Heinrich C. Albers (17731833). The cone is intersecting the globe in two standard parallels (or is tangent in one standard parallel).\n\nProperties:\n\nequal-area\n\nscale and shape are not preserved\n\ndistortion is minimal between the standard parallels.\n\nStandard Parallels: 0°, 60°\n\nn = 0.5*sin(60)\n\ntheta = n*longitude\n\nrho = sqrt(1-2*n*sin(latitude))/n\n\nrho0 = 1.0/n\n\nx = R*rho*Math.sin(K*theta)\n\ny = R*[rho0 - rho*cos(theta)]\n\n18. Bonne\n\nThe projection is named after Rigobert Bonne (17271795), although it was in use prior to his birth.\n\nProperties:\n\nParallels of latitude are concentric circular arcs, and the scale is true along these arcs. On the central meridian and the standard latitude shapes are not distorted.\n\nMeridians: Central meridian is a straight line. Other meridians are complex curves connecting points equally spaced along each parallel of latitude and concave toward the central meridian.\n\nrho = 1/tan(paral) + K*paral - K*latitude\n\nE = K*longitude*cos(latitude)/rho\n\nx = R*rho*sin(E)\n\ny = R*[1/tan(paral) - rho*Math.cos(E)]\n\n18. Lambert Conic\n\nThis projection is one of seven projections introduced by Johann Heinrich Lambert in his 1772 publication.\n\nProperties:\n\nConformal\n\nStraight line drawn on a Lambert conformal conic projection approximates a great-circle route between endpoints for typical flight distances.\n\nTwo parallels can be assigned unit scale, with scale decreasing between the two parallels and increasing outside them. This gives the map two standard parallels.\n\nK = π/180\n\nn = sin(paral)\n\nF = cos(paral)*tann(π/4+0.5*K*paral)\n\nrho0 = F/tann(π/4)\n\nrho = F/tan(π/4+0.5*K*latitude)\n\nx = R*rho*sin(n*longitude);\n\ny = R*[rho0-rho*cos(n*longitude)]\n\n19. Craster\n\nThis projection was developed by John Evelyn Edmund Craster in 1929; it was further developed by Charles H. Deetz and O.S. Adams in 1934. It was presented independently in 1934 by Putnins as his P4 projection.\n\nProperties:\n\nequal-area\n\nmeridians are equally spaced parabolas\n\nparallels are unequally spaced straight parallel lines\n\nfree of distortion only at the two points where the central meridian intersects the 36º46' parallels\n\nK = π/180\n\nx = R*sqrt(3/π)*K*longitude*[2*cos(2*latitude/3)-1]\n\ny = R*sqrt(3*π)*sin(latitude/3)"
