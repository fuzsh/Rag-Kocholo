        "text": "Railways in\n\nIreland\n\nThis page relates to the Irish Republic. See separate page for Northern Ireland.\n\nThere are separate pages dealing with station names in the whole of Ireland.\n\nEarly railway development in Ireland took place when the entire island, north and south, was part of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe first railway in Ireland was opened in 1834 between Dublin Westland Row (now Pearse) and Dunleary (Dun Laoghaire). It was built to the so-called âStephensonâ gauge of 4ft 8Â½in (1435mm) which was rapidly becoming accepted as the standard gauge for all new railways in England, and was soon to be adopted in continental Europe.\n\nUnfortunately for standardization, the second and third railways to be built adopted quite different gauges. The first section of the Ulster Railway between Belfast and Lisburn opened in 1839 with a gauge of no less that 6ft 2in (1880mm), while in 1844 the Dublin and Drogheda Railway opened with a gauge of 5ft 2in (1575mm). Clearly this state of affairs was untenable from the point of view of a viable interlinked railway system, and after much debate and government legislation, a compromise gauge of 5ft 3in (1600mm) was adopted for all new main line railways. The existing railways were eventually converted to this gauge.\n\nSome remote rural areas were served by light railways of 3ft (914mm) gauge, a few of which survive today as tourist operations. 2ft (610mm) and 3ft (914mm) gauge were used for the extensive networks of lines constructed to serve the peat extraction industry.\n\nIn 1876 a number of existing railways were combined to form the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) or GNR(I). In 1921 the Irish Free State was established, creating a new land border with Northern Ireland. In 1925, all railways whose lines were wholly within the Irish Free State were combined into the Great Southern Railways. This did not include the main Belfast to Dublin line of GNR(I), nor several small local railways some of which crossed and recrossed the border several times. These continued a somewhat schizophrenic existence for many years, but all cross-border lines had been closed by 1960, with the exception of the important Belfast to Dublin line.\n\nNorthern Ireland Railways were nationalised in 1948 at the same time as British Railways, while railways in the Irish Republic were nationalised in 1950. This left the GNR(I) main line as an anomaly, still in private hands. Finally, in 1953, this line, too, was taken into State control, responsibility for it being divided between the respective railway administrations of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.\n\nThe major cities, like cities in the United Kingdom, lost their original tram systems many years ago. However, Dublin now has an extensive modern tram system, the first line of which opened in 2004. The system uses the international standard gauge of 1435mm.\n\nNational Network\n\nIrish Rail - IarnrÃ³d Ãireann the 1600mm gauge network, with international connections to Northern Ireland.\n\nIndustrial Railways\n\nBoliden Tara Mines has a 1600mm gauge internal railway network connecting with Irish Rail. Mine ceased production in 2023 but is being kept on care and maintenance pending possible reopening (Website contains no details relating to railway)\n\nWaterways Ireland has a four weirs on the River Shannon whose sluices are opened and closed by diesel powered, rail mounted winch vehicles running along a track above of the sluices (Website contains no details relating to railways)\n\nMetro and Trams\n\nDublin\n\nLuas tram system.\n\nMetroLink proposed Metro.\n\nCork proposed trams.\n\nTourist and Museum Railways\n\nCavan and Leitrim Railway 3ft (914mm) gauge railway curently a little under Â½ mile (0.6km) in length from Dromod, near the Irish Rail staion. Extensions proposed. Steam or diesel hauled.\n\nClonakilty Golf Club the golf course of club in West Cork has two 1600mm gauge funiculars of 200 yards (180m) and 300 yards (270m) respectively, each with a gradient of 1 in 4 (25%), connecting different parts of the course. Passengers are normally carried in the uphill direction only. Although primarily intended for the use of golfers, it may be possible to visit the funiculars by prior arrangement with the club (Website contains few details relating to funiculars)\n\nConnemara Railway Project Maam Cross. Project to establish passenger carrying lines at the restored station. Gauges of 5ft 3in (1600mm) and 3ft (914mm) are proposed, with a length of line up to about 550 yards (500m).\n\nFintown Railway 3ft (914mm) gauge railway running for about 2Â¼ miles (3.6km) alongside Lough Finn from Fintown in County Donegal. Historic diesel railcar. Proposed extension to Glenties, a total distance of 8 miles (13km).\n\nLartigue Monorail a faithful replica of the unique early steam hauled passenger carrying monorail at Listowel in County Kerry. The track runs for about 500m on the line of the former Limerick and Kerry railway towards Tralee, not on the line of the original monorail to Ballybunion.\n\nLough Boora Discovery Park has a number of railway artefacts relating to former peat extraction, and plans to construct a passenger carrying railway (Website contains no details relating to railway or rail related exhibits)\n\nPeatlands Heritage Railway 3ft (914mm) gauge railway in the Lullymore Heritage & Discovery Park, County Kildare, using a former Bord na MÃ³na diesel locomotive and passenger carriage. About 1 mile (1.6km) in length. Operates for special events and for prebooked parties. Not to be confused with the road train that also operates in the park.\n\nStradbally Woodland Railway 3ft (914mm) gauge railway about Â½ mile (0.8km) in length at the Stradbally Steam Museum, County Laois. Usually steam hauled.\n\nWaterford & Suir Valley Railway Kilmeaden to Bilberry, near Waterford (about 7Â½ miles, 12 km). 3ft (914mm) gauge, diesel hauled. Planned extension further into Waterford. Possible future extension towards Dungarvan. Possible future regauging to Irish standard gauge (1600mm).\n\nWest Clare Railway 3ft (914mm) gauge steam railway running for 1Â½ miles (2.4km) from Moyasta Junction, on the main road between Kilrush and Kilkee in County Clare. Extensions proposed to Kilkee and eventually also to Kilrush, a total of about 7Â½ miles (12 km) (Website not maintained up to date since 2013)\n\nThe Railway Preservation Society of Ireland operates occasional steam trains on the main lines of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\nVelorail\n\nVelorail Pedal powered rail trolleys on a stretch of 5ft 3in (1600mm) running north and south from Kiltimagh for a total of about 5Â½ miles (9 km)\n\nMiniature Railways"
