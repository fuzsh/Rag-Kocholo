        "text": "Driving in Ireland\n\nThe best way to experience all the wonders that Ireland has to offer is by car. With a car, you can decide on the spur of the moment to take a detour that leads to a magnificent deserted beach. You may well discover a small, insignificant sign that points you to some awe-inspiring standing stones that were not on your tourist map. (This is exactly what happened to us when we discovered the Uragh Stone Circle.)\n\nYou could also decide to stop in at an out-of-the-way pub, order a delicious bowl of fish chowder accompanied by thick slices of Irish soda bread, and listen in awe as an impromptu traditional music session suddenly starts happening.\n\nIf you decide to take this highly recommended option, however, you need to be prepared for some of the driving challenges you will experience!\n\nYou shift manual cars with the left hand\n\nFirst of all, people in Ireland drive on the left side of the road. This means that the steering wheel is located on the right side of the car. The vast majority of cars in Ireland use a manual transmission, so you shift gears with your left hand. If you prefer to drive a car with an automatic transmission, plan to reserve it as far in advance as possible.\n\nAlways look to the right first in an intersection\n\nEvery time I get in my car, I say this mantra: drive left, look right. This is the opposite of what we do in countries that drive on the right, so it is important to keep it in mind. Furthermore, you always yield to traffic coming from the right in an intersection.\n\nTraffic roundabouts are much more common than traffic signals\n\nMaybe roundabouts are common where you come from, but in Portland, Oregon (where I come from), they are not.\n\nIt has therefore taken me a while to get used to them–especially since there are often two lanes of traffic going the same direction in the roundabout, and you need to be in the correct lane to choose the correct exit. (There are often three roads exiting from a single traffic circle, sometime even four.) You also have to remember to signal correctly and to always yield to cars coming from the right side.\n\nOnce you get used to them, roundabouts are actually a great solution because they keep the traffic flowing.\n\nMost roads in Ireland are narrow!\n\nAlthough Ireland does have some freeways connecting major cities, most roads in Ireland consist of two-lane highways that are quite a bit narrower than those in the United States or continental Europe.\n\nIn addition, MANY roads in Ireland consist of just one narrow lane. As a result, one car needs to ease into a turn-out in order to let the oncoming car pass. If no turn-out is handy, one car will need to back up until a turn-out can be located!\n\nNote: When it comes to steep mountain roads, it is generally the responsibility of the car driving up the hill to pull over to allow the driver coming down the hill to pass.\n\nOne-lane roads frequently wind and curve over mountain passes, through small villages, and along hedge rows separating farmers’ fields. They consequently have numerous blind spots, so you need to be particularly conscientious when navigating them.\n\nRent a small car when traveling in Ireland\n\nFor all of these reasons, it is a great idea to rent as small a car as possible. At least until you become accustomed to the varied driving conditions and have a good sense of how far the boundaries of your car extend on both sides!"
