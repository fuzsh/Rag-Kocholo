        "text": "A great way to get around Ireland\n\nTrains are a pleasant and relaxing way to get around Ireland. Modern air-conditioned intercity trains were introduced a few years ago as part of a massive investment programme, allowing frequencies to be increased. This page will get you started...\n\nWhere do the trains go?\n\nHow to check train times & buy tickets\n\nWhich station in Dublin?\n\nDublin to Cork InterCity trains\n\nDublin to Limerick, Galway, Kilkenny, Waterford, Tralee, Westport & Ballina by InterCity railcar\n\nDublin to Belfast by Enterprise express\n\nBelfast to Londonderry by train\n\nBelfast to the Giant's Causeway by train\n\nRecommended hotels in Dublin & Belfast\n\nSailRail tickets Dublin to/from London or any station in Britain\n\nSailRail tickets Belfast to/from London or any station in Britain\n\nWhere do the trains go? Route map\n\nAs you'd expect, most rail lines radiate out of Dublin, see Irish Rail's map of the Irish rail network.\n\nHow to check times & buy tickets\n\nTo check train times & fares in the Republic of Ireland and from the Republic to Belfast, use the Irish Railways website www.irishrail.ie.\n\nTo check train & bus times in Northern Ireland and from Belfast south to Dublin, use the journey planner at www.translink.co.uk. Translink is the Northern Ireland transport organisation which includes Northern Ireland Railways (NIR) and Ulsterbus.\n\nYou can call Irish Rail enquiries on 01 836 6222 when in Ireland or on 00 353 1 836 6222 from outside Ireland.\n\nIf you are prepared to pay for a full-price ticket you can just buy at the station on the day, there's no need to book in advance. Full-price tickets cannot sell out, they have a fixed price and unlimited availability. Reservation is optional on Irish intercity trains and not possible at all on local & suburban trains (including all Northern Irish domestic trains), if you choose not to reserve a seat you just board the train and sit where you like, in any empty unreserved seat. just as on trains in Great Britain.\n\nHowever, for longer journeys if you are prepared to book in advance and commit to a specific train with limited or no refunds or changes to travel plans allowed, you can save money by buying a cheap advance-purchase ticket at www.irishrail.ie. You collect tickets at the self-service ticket machines at any main station.\n\nTip: How to travel 1st class, cheaply. Irish Rail has no 1st class semi-flex or advance fares, only 1st class full-flex. But you can buy an upgrade to 1st class for the difference in price between full-flex standard and full-flex 1st, which can be used with any standard class ticket, even an advance-purchase one. Simply buy a cheap standard class ticket, then use www.irishrail.ie again, this time clicking the Free travel pass or valid ticket link beneath the journey planner. Read the advice here (external website, please let me know if that link stops working). This works from Dublin to Belfast, too.\n\nWhich station in Dublin?\n\nDublin Heuston\n\nHeuston station is the terminus for trains heading west & southwest from Dublin to Cork, Limerick, Galway, Kilkenny, Waterford, Tralee, Westport & Ballina. Opened in 1846 as Dublin Kingsbridge station, it was renamed Heuston in 1966 after Seán Heuston, a young railway worker who commanded a nearby post in the 1916 Easter Rising. It's located 3km (2 miles) west of Dublin city centre so it's best to take the frequent Luas tram (www.luas.ie) which links Heuston station with the city centre and Connolly station every few minutes from early morning to late at night. It has 9 platforms. As it's a terminus, there is easy level access between tram stop/taxi rank/street, concourse and all platforms. For more about the station's history see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuston_railway_station.\n\nDublin Connolly\n\nIreland's busiest station, Dublin Connolly is the station for Belfast, Sligo, Wicklow, Wexford, Dun Laoghaire & Rosslare, sitting on the north-south tracks which pass through Dublin on a viaduct. Concourse & platforms are one floor up from street level. Platforms are numbered from east to west, platforms 1-4 are north-facing terminus platforms (trains to Belfast use these), platforms 5-7 are through platforms (DART suburban trains & southbound trains to Wicklow, Wexford & Rosslare use these). The station opened in 1844 as plain Dublin Station, later renamed Dublin Amiens Street. It was renamed Dublin Connolly in 1966 after Irish revolutionary James Connolly.\n\nDublin to Cork by InterCity train\n\nThese smart modern trains link Dublin & Cork virtually every hour in 2h50, via Limerick Junction (for Tipperary) and Mallow (for the line to Tralee). Change in Cork for the local train to Cobh. These trains have 1st & standard class with a catering car and free WiFi. The full Irish breakfast on morning trains from Dublin is as good a breakfast as you'll have on any train anywhere! They were introduced in 2005-2006. Catering is suspended in 2022, may return in 2023.\n\nDublin to Galway, Limerick, Waterford, Sligo, Wexford, Rosslare by InterCity railcar\n\nThese smart modern air-conditioned railcars are the new face of Irish Railways, built by Hyundai and introduced in 2008 onto all intercity routes from Dublin, other than the Dublin-Belfast and Dublin-Cork routes. Trains run roughly every 2 hours from Dublin to Galway, Limerick, Sligo, Kilkenny, Waterford, Wicklow, Wexford & Rosslare. Dublin to Galway takes 2h45, Dublin to Limerick 2h45.\n\nDublin to Belfast by Enterprise\n\nComfortable Enterprise trains link Belfast Lanyon Place (formerly known as Belfast Central) and Dublin Connolly in about 2 hours, with departures every 2 hours. The service is jointly run by NIR and Irish Railways. It has standard class, first class (also known as Enterprise Plus class) and a cafe-bar.\n\nYou can buy cheap tickets from as low as 13.99 each way if you book online in advance.\n\nBuy one-way or round-trip tickets starting in Dublin at www.irishrail.ie, you must collect hard-copy tickets from Irish Rail ticket machines in Dublin.\n\nBuy one-way or round-trip tickets starting in Belfast at www.translink.co.uk, you must exchange the confirmation email for a hard-copy ticket at Belfast Central station or another staffed NIR station.\n\nTip: On the Enterprise, find a seat on the left hand side going south to Dublin, right hand side going north to Belfast, for the sea views north of Dublin.\n\nUpdate 2024: You used to be able to catch a connecting train between Belfast Lanyon Place and the more centrally-located Belfast Great Victoria Street station. However, GVS has now closed to allow construction of the new (and larger) Belfast Grand Central Station. You may also find Enterprise trains to/from Lanyon Place affected by this work in the 2nd half of 2024, check online. When opened, the Enterprise trains will run directly to/from Grand Central.\n\nBelfast Central was named after the Belfast Central Railway, not because of its location! It was renamed Belfast Lanyon Place in September 2018.\n\nVideo guide: Dublin to Belfast by Enterprise\n\nBelfast to Londonderry (Derry) & Giant's Causeway by train\n\nSmart modern air-conditioned trains link Belfast Great Victoria Street and Belfast Lanyon Place (formerly Belfast Central) stations with the historic walled city of Londonderry, or Derry if you prefer, every hour, journey time around 2 hours 12 minutes.\n\nTo check train times, use the journey planner at www.translink.co.uk/Services/NI-Railways. These new trains have revolutionised rail travel in Northern Ireland, increasing in passengers by over 60% in the last few years. With comfortable seats, carpet, toilets, air-conditioning and a scenic route through the countryside and alongside the sea approaching Londonderry, it's definitely the way to go.\n\nI recommend a seat on the right hand side of the train going north to Londonderry, as that's where the best scenery will be, alongside Belfast Lough and along the Foyle estuary.\n\nBelfast Central was named after the Belfast Central Railway, not for its location! It was renamed Belfast Lanyon Place in September 2018.\n\nFor Belfast to the Giant's Causeway, see the Giant's Causeway page\n\nBack to top\n\nRailtours Ireland, Railtoursireland.com\n\nIf you want to kiss the Blarney Stone, drive the Ring of Kerry or walk on the Giant's Causeway as a stress-free day trip from Dublin, Railtours Ireland deserves a special mention. They run daily tours from Dublin using a unique train-based concept that makes the famous sights & scenery of remote western & northern Ireland accessible as a day trip. They work closely with Iarnrod Eireann (Irish Railways).\n\nYou are whisked from central Dublin to Limerick, Galway, Cork or Belfast by comfortable air-conditioned intercity train, leaving around 7:00-7:30 am.\n\nA coach meets the train and takes you on a guided tour into the countryside.\n\nThe range of tours includes kissing the Blarney Stone at Blarney Castle, driving around the Ring of Kerry, or to see the Giant's Causeway, or to Bunratty Castle and the Cliffs of Moher, and more... There's stops for lunch & photographs;\n\nIn the early evening the coach takes you back to the station and puts you on a fast intercity train back to Dublin, arriving (depending on the tour) 8:00-10:15 pm.\n\nAs well as 1 day tours they now also offer longer tours of Ireland, up to 11 days.\n\nRailtours Ireland have now been established for over 20 years and get great reports. I've known them for over a decade and have used them myself on a couple of occasions, both memorable.\n\nBook online at railtoursireland.com, or by phone. Please mention seat61.com when booking.\n\nTip: There's a full cooked breakfast available in the restaurant car of some of the Irish Rail intercity trains they use out of Dublin, costing around 17 (£14). It's as good a cooked breakfast as you'll have on any regular scheduled train, so treat yourself!\n\nBack to top\n\nYou get more from a trip with a good guidebook, even in the age of the internet. For the independent traveller, go for either the Lonely Planet or the Rough Guide. Both series are excellent. Lonely Planet Dublin - Lonely Planet Ireland - Rough Guide Ireland. Also consider Ecoescapes Ireland, which lists eco-friendly places to stay.\n\nClick the images to buy at Amazon.co.uk\n\nBack to top\n\nHotels in Dublin, Belfast & Ireland\n\nThe Gresham, Dublin Check prices & book\n\nPerfectly located on Upper O'Connell Street in the heart of central Dublin, 10 minutes walk from Connolly Station, the Gresham has been a Dublin landmark since 1817. The impressive facade is matched by a marble-floored foyer and bar, and comfortable carpeted lounges. Yet it's not particularly expensive as Dublin hotels go.\n\nEuropa Hotel, Belfast Check prices & book\n\nOpened in 1971, Belfast's famous Europa Hotel has more history than many hotels several times its age. The hotel was used by journalists such as Trevor MacDonald, Kate Adie, John Simpson during the Troubles in the 1970s and 80s, when it earned the title of Most Bombed Hotel in Europe. It suffered so many bomb attacks and had so many windows boarded up, it was also known as the Hardboard Hotel. Yet it stayed open in spite of everything, a true survivor. Today it's a fabulous place to stay, ideally located next to Great Victoria Street Station and across the road from the famous Crown Bar. You'll find a book about the history of the hotel in your room and a display case on the first floor near the piano with some hotel memorabilia. There's also a railway connection, as it was built on the site of the Great Northern Railway terminus, the ancestor of Great Victoria Street station.\n\nBackpacker hostels: www.hostelworld.com\n\nIf you're on a tight budget, don't forget the hostels. For a dorm bed or an ultra-cheap private room in backpacker hostels in most European cities use www.hostelworld.com.\n\nBack to top"
