        "text": "MetroLink will be a fully segregated and mostly underground new railway line between Swords and Dublin City Centre, the first of its kind in Ireland. MetroLink will serve multiple residential communities such as Swords, Ballymun and Glasnevin, as well as the City Centre, Dublin Airport, major employment zones, education, transport and other facilities. It is a key project under the National Development Plan 2021-30.\n\nThe stations on the route will connect directly to Irish Rail, DART and DART+ services (at Tara Street and Glasnevin train stations), Luas services (at the Charlemont stop), bus and BusConnects services, as well as to Dublin Airport which is the country’s and island’s busiest international gateway. Passengers will be able to transfer from MetroLink to train services at Dublin Connolly station, which serves Belfast, via the Luas in the city or Tara Street station rail station or at the future Glasnevin rail station.\n\nMetroLink is thus a transformative railway project, widening bus and rail access and connectivity for over a million people in the Greater Dublin Area, as well as an even greater number across Ireland.\n\nNoting the NTA's responsibility in this matter and the specific issues raised by the Deputy, I have referred the Deputies' questions to the NTA for a more detailed reply. Please contact my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 days."
