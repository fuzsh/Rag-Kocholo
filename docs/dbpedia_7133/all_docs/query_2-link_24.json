        "text": "The ambitious All-Island Rail Review was put together by Arup on behalf of Northern Ireland’s Department for Infrastructure and the Republic of Ireland’s Department of Transport. The report is a draft that has been published and is open for public consultation until 29 September.\n\nInitially commissioned in 2021, the report aims to examine the role rail could play in delivering a prosperous economy for the island of Ireland as the stronger backbone of a high-quality and sustainable transport system. It identifies opportunities that would transform transport connectivity and access, as well as accelerate Ireland’s transition to a net-zero economy, according to the report.\n\nThere are 30 recommendations on how to modernise the island’s rail network, responding to constraints it currently suffers from. These constraints include significant gaps in the network’s coverage, service frequencies and speeds being relatively low compared to similar railways in the European Union, Ireland having the lowest level of electrified railway in the EU and no major airport on the island being served by passenger rail services.\n\nIf all the recommendations from the report are delivered, it estimates the total cost will sit between €35bn (£29.2bn) and €36.8bn (£30.7bn). Of that, around 75% is due to be paid by the Irish Government while the Northern Irish executive would be expected to cover the remaining 25%.\n\nTo better connect both nations, the report recommends upgrading the cross-country rail network to a dual-track railway, with four-tracks in places and increase intercity service frequencies. This would involve dual-tracking:\n\nPortarlington – Athlone\n\nKildare – Kilkenny\n\nMaynooth – Mullingar\n\nFour-tracking Connolly/Spencer Dock – Clongriffin\n\nIt further suggests developing short sections of new railways on congested corridors. These are:\n\nBelfast – Lisburn – Newry\n\nDublin – Drogheda\n\nPortarlington/Kildare – Hazelhatch\n\nIn Northern Ireland, the review states a restoration of the line between Derry and Londonderry and Portadown is needed to link the large towns of Strabane, Omagh and Dungannon to the rail network and greatly improve intercity connectivity between both Dublin and Belfast. The current route is restrained, according to the report.\n\nIt further recommends reinstating the railway from Portadown to Armagh, Cavan, and Mullingar in Northern Ireland and building a new direct line between Lisburn and Newry, together with a short tunnel from Adelaide to the Lisburn area.\n\nOn the west coast of the Republic, the review suggests improving services from Galway to Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Waterford, together with double tracking between Athenry and Galway. Further, restoring the rail line between Athenry and Claremorris and developing a new rail link from Letterkenny to Derry-Londonderry is also suggested.\n\nOn the south coast, reinstating the railway between Waterford and Rosslare (including a chord/curve to the south of Wexford) and extending some Dublin – Waterford intercity services to a new station to the south of Wexford O Hanrahan station are in the plans.\n\nIn the north midlands, the report recommends upgrading the Limerick Junction and the Limerick Junction – Waterford line, reinstating the Western Rail Corridor railway between Claremorris and Athenry, extending the railway into Tyrone, Derry-Londonderry, and Donegal and reinstating the South Wexford Railway.\n\nA large part of the report covers the lack of rail connectivity with the major airports across the island. To combat this, it recommends connecting Dublin, Belfast and Shannon airports to the railway by building a spur from Clongriffin to Dublin Airport, reinstating the railway between Lisburn and Antrim and building a spur from Sixmilebridge or Cratloe to Shannon Airport.\n\nThe report states the full investment would take “the best part of 25 years to deliver”. Its formation was also supported by technical experts from the European Investment Bank (JASPERS), who assisted the Department of Transport in the scoping, oversight, and preparation of the review.\n\nIt states that up to 2050 much of the existing rail network and any new additions across both nations should be electrified to help support both governments’ 2050 net zero ambitions.\n\nThe only electrified sections of the railway in both countries are those used by the Dublin Area Rapid Transit service (DART). This is a suburban service operating along the coast of the Dublin area from Greystones to Malahide and Howth. All other services are currently powered by diesel traction."
