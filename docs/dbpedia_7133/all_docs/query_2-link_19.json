        "text": "This sum is for the Enterprise fleet replacement programme, which will involve replacing the existing four-train fleet of Enterprise locomotives with eight new, modern and sustainable train sets.\n\nHourly trains between Belfast and Dublin will benefit passengers by 2030 thanks to a doubling of the train capacity on the line, following investment from governments in the UK and Republic of Ireland into the Enterprise fleet replacement programme.\n\nThe Enterprise fleet replacement programme is part of the €1.14bn (£980M) PeacePlus initiative, which is a cross-border funding programme between the European Union, the UK government, the Government of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Executive. It is designed to support peace and prosperity across Northern Ireland and the border counties of Ireland.\n\nPeacePlus said in a statement that the new trains would support the electrification of the railway on both sides of the border and would offer “improved accessibility and passenger experience, with an hourly service and journey times reduced to at least 1 hour 55 minutes between Dublin and Belfast”.\n\nIt said that the procurement process for the new trains is expected to finish within “the coming year” and it hoped that the new trains would be operating from 2029.\n\n“The new trains will be designed to run initially on electric and battery power on part of the Dublin to Belfast route and can be converted into fully electric operation in the future,” Peaceplus said in a statement, which is “consistent with the recommendations of the draft All-Island Strategic Rail Review which was undertaken by” both UK and Republic of Ireland governments.\n\nThe Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) runs the PeacePlus programme.\n\nSEUPB chief executive Gina McIntyre said: “This €165M investment in cross-border rail services aligns closely to a key ambition of the Peaceplus programme, to support a sustainable and better-connected future.\n\n“We know that transport is a crucial economic driver, as it connects businesses with markets and facilitates employee mobility, as well as providing access to education, health and leisure services.”\n\nMcIntyre said the “major” investment would “serve as a catalyst for regeneration and economic growth for all areas along the Dublin to Belfast economic corridor.\n\n“Peace and prosperity are two sides of the same coin, and this ambitious and forward-looking project will deliver on both of those aspirations by enhancing the economic viability of the region, while improving the social connectivity between people and place.”\n\nEuropean Commissioner for Cohesion and Reforms Elisa Ferreira said she was “happy” that the “EU plays an important role” in the investment and the Peaceplus programme.\n\n“The thrust of the programme has always been about transformation, regeneration and creating thriving communities.\n\n“The €165M investment in improving the cross-border rail service between Belfast and Dublin by the Enterprise Fleet Replacement Programme transforms these ambitions into reality.\n\n“The investment will bring concrete benefits for the local communities. Citizens and businesses will have easier and quicker access to Dublin and Belfast and be more connected.”\n\nFerreira said the programme would “help the local communities grow and create opportunities while delivering on the net zero carbon emissions goal.\n\n“I would also like to underline the constructive, creative and collaborative approach between the Irish and UK Governments, the Northern Ireland Executive, SEUPB and the European Union, which are all vital components in ensuring the success of the Peace Plus Programme.”\n\nNorthern Ireland Executive Minister for Infrastructure John O’Dowd said: “This is an exciting time for rail travel. The new fleet will pave the way for the Enterprise service to become the first electrified inter-city service on the island which will support our decarbonisation commitments.\n\n“The investment will improve the experience of people travelling by train and encourage others to use these services.\n\n“By doing so you will be playing your part in our shared journey to net zero as well as enjoying the many benefits to be gained by rail travel.”\n\nGovernment of Ireland Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said: “The flagship Enterprise service is a very visible and well-known symbol of North-South cooperation and this replacement programme is a key priority of both Governments.\n\n“The programme will significantly improve accessibility between the two largest cities on the island through increased service frequency and a faster journey time.\n\n“This is another indication of the ambition we have to put the island of Ireland on track for a new age of rail, connecting more cities and towns and opening up quality rail service to more people.\n\n“The funding for this programme under the PeacePlus programme and from both Government Departments demonstrates the positive impact cooperation has on meeting our shared goals of a cleaner, greener, interconnected all-island future.”\n\nUK Government Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Chris Heaton-Harris said: “I am so pleased by the news of the fantastic investment that is going into the Enterprise Fleet Replacement Programme through the PeacePlus programme.\n\n“The transformation of cross-border rail services between Belfast and Dublin is going to create unique and exciting opportunities for both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland alike.\n\n“We should not underestimate the impact that this infrastructure will have on the economic growth of the region, by ensuring there are the right conditions in place to thrive, prosper and be the best place in the world to invest.\n\n“A key theme of PeacePlus is collaboration and partnership - through this programme I look forward to working with the Irish Government, Northern Ireland Executive and SEUPB to ensure that our shared ambitions for peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties of Ireland are realised.\n\n“The UK’s £730M investment into PEACEPLUS was only the first step to building on these ambitions.”"
