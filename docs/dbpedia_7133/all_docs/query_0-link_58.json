        "text": "Experience three of the British Isles' most scenic countries on a vacation showcasing the best of these Celtic destinations. Beginning in Scotland, we explore the majestic Highlands before travelling to Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, nations with fascinating culture and history.\n\nTravelling on the scenic West Highland and Kyle railway lines, we discover Scotland's historic castles, glistening lochs, and vibrant cities. Then, we drive from Belfast in Northern Island along the Causeway Coastal Route to admire the dramatic Cliffs of Moher and explore Dublin in Ireland.\n\nMy friend and I both enjoyed this tour but if we tell others about it we would tell them that the tour is fairly wearing. There needs to be more time for rest and free-time. I didn't always like the meals served at the hotels. They were all too much alike. Sometimes plain food is good rather than gourmet all the time. Also because we had such a large group it took a long time for us to be served. I'm not used to eating a 9:00 at night. The tour director was great. She was very empathetic. Another woman and I were motion sick on the coach and she made sure that we were seated at the front which really helped. It would have been useful to know that we were going to spend a lot of travel time on a coach through windy country roads.\n\nCollected by Trustpilot"
