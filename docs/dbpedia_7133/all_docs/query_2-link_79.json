        "text": "Came across this today, thought it might be of interest to somebody...\n\nhttp://www.independent.ie/breaking-news/irish-news/revamp-of-belfastdublin-line-30742599.html\n\n. Revamp of Belfast-Dublin line\n\nPublished 13/11/2014 | 16:46\n\nCarriages will be upgraded on the Belfast to Dublin line under the revamp plans\n\nA multi-million revamp of the Belfast to Dublin rail service has begun.\n\nTranslink, which operates the cross-border Enterprise trains, said it hoped the £12.2 million (15.4 million euro) refurbishment programme would be completed by next autumn.\n\nThe work, which includes a carriage facelift; a new electronic booking system and a mechanical overhaul has been funded through the European Union and the Department for Regional Development.\n\nTransport Minister Danny Kennedy said the investment was essential to sustain tourism and trade.\n\nHe said: \"This is a significant investment and an important step forward in the development of this flagship train service which was first launched in 1997.\"\n\nLast year (2013/14) almost 840,000 journeys were made on the Enterprise service.\n\nA series of timetable and service changes will kick in this weekend. They include the re-timing of the last train to Dublin to 9.35pm and the introduction of a new Sunday timetable.\n\nThere will also be reduced number of 1st Plus seats.\n\nMal McGreevy, Translink general manager, rail services, said: \"Once completed, the service will look and feel like a modern new train.\"\n\nPress Association\n\nIt's to be welcomed, and given that it appears to have been almost entirely funded by EU / DRD grants, then the investment isn't to be sneezed at. But we will still be looking at a train that's slower than the coach.\n\nSurely £12.2m / 15.4m could be spent on the infrastructure somewhere to shave even five minutes off the journey time?\n\nSurely £12.2m / 15.4m could be spent on the infrastructure somewhere to shave even five minutes off the journey time?\n\nThe funding is coming from the Irish government and NI Executive with EU match funding.\n\nUnfortunately, £12.2m wouldn't make much dent on the amount of work required to the infrastructure which would have any appreciable effect. That said, I always use the Enterprise over the coach, especially with the ridiculously cheap advance web fares.\n\nAn Iarnród Éireann 5 car Intercity Railcar (ICR) will be used for the next year on the route to allow for the refurbishment of the De Dietrich coaching stock used on the Enterprise.\n\nThe ICR will operate on a fixed roster each day, which requires the existing 20:05 Belfast/Dublin service to be deferred to 21:35. This ensures that the set (which will be operated only by Irish Rail crews) ends back in Dublin each night.\n\nThe services operated by the ICR are:\n\nMonday-Saturday:\n\nFrom Dublin Connolly: 07:35, 13:20, 19:00\n\nFrom Belfast Central: 10:35, 16:05, 21:35\n\nSundays:\n\nFrom Dublin Connolly: 10:00, 16:00\n\nFrom Belfast Central: 13:05, 19:05\n\nMore information on the Enterprise refurbishment is here:\n\nhttp://www.irishrail.ie/news/enterpriseupgrade\n\nGM 201 class number 8209 is already out in service sporting the new yet uncompleted livery for the Enterprise. I cannot wait to see it complete Here is a picture from Kieran Marshall's Flickr page http://www.flickr.com/photos/95093559@N06/15392021784\n\nWelcome to the Forum Neal!\n\nI see it's been out and unfinished since the middle of December, I wonder what livery style is planned for this service now then? Seems to be a new take on the rather attractive Silver based livery as carried on the 071s for some time.\n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/search?text=Irish+Rail+8209\n\nCan't say I'm a fan of the rather Southern-ish livery on the 2900s now either.\n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/hurricanemk1c/15394444613/in/photostream/\n\nThanks for the welcome! The livery for the coaches will be like a maroon purple colour stripe up along the silver body: and from the pictures I have saw it looks pretty good. Just a shell at the minute though; the coaches still need their new fittings installed. the engine will have the same sort of colours once they are finished. 8209 had been on diagrammed runs all last week\n\nSome white or even orange in place of the dark green band along the windows would have been better in my eyes, break up the green somewhat!\n\nHaving looked at the link posted by berneyarms and a few other photos on Flickr, I'm still rather in agreement with you - It needs something to break up the rather dullness of the two tone green - especially on the intermediate cars. And I can't say I like the lines of the Yellow warning panel on the front either, it just doesn't flow with the shape of the front of the unit very well, not as badly as the 185 Matching TPE 170s, but not quite right.\n\nIt still feels very Southern - ish though, and not quite matching any of the other IE DMU fleet. Perhaps it looks better in the flesh, but awkwardly in pictures.\n\nThe green livery on the 29000s looks grand but to be honest, I doubt the people who pay to sit on the inside care what colour it is on the outside as long as it appears well maintained.\n\nIf you haven't seen them already, there're pictures of both the part-finished loco and a couple of De Dietrich carriages (basically empty shells at this stage) at York Road here http://chrisplayfair.smugmug.com/Travel/2014-Photos/Ireland-December-2014/46120607_wj52Vt#!i=3783740550&k=bGMRgTM\n\nCompared to what it replaces, it all looks very drab.\n\nThe green livery on the 29000s looks grand but to be honest, I doubt the people who pay to sit on the inside care what colour it is on the outside as long as it appears well maintained.\n\nIf you haven't seen them already, there're pictures of both the part-finished loco and a couple of De Dietrich carriages (basically empty shells at this stage) at York Road here http://chrisplayfair.smugmug.com/Travel/2014-Photos/Ireland-December-2014/46120607_wj52Vt#!i=3783740550&k=bGMRgTM\n\nCompared to what it replaces, it all looks very drab.\n\nThanks for those, I hadn't seen any progress pictures so far - It's a little East Coast Meets Chiltern Mainline with the black band of Virgin trains!\n\nI just hope though that they actually look after this Enterprise set after refurbishment and that the reliability modifications improve the service - Each time I've been over in Northern Ireland I've not had a good experience with the Enterprise so far!\n\nI was on the hired in set recently, not impressed that Irish Rail knew about a broken outer skin on a window yet still let it run around for three weeks...\n\nStill it's a different way of life there, that said travelling by train in both parts of Northern and Southern Ireland was quite nice.\n\nHired-in set?\n\nIt's a joint operation, so it's hardly \"hired-in\"\n\nI assume you mean one of the ICR sets that is being provided by Irish Rail while the dedicated Enterprise stock is being refurbished."
