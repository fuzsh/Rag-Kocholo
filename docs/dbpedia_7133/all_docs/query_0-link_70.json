        "text": "I know some of you good people on this forum may be sick of requests for a route set in Ireland, as they wouldn’t be exactly as famous as some other countries suggested, but hear me out. I think it would be of a number of people’s interest to include a route set in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nRoute\n\nWhile this may not be the definitive choice, I think a route of good length and traffic would be the Dublin–Portlaoise railway with a branch to Athlone and another to Dublin Port. While this may sound like a lot, do not be intimidated as it is 95.5 miles in total, which isn’t too much compared to other routes. This line includes 15 stations, and 4 rail yards (2 Portlaoise depots, Inchicore Works & North Wall). For a bit of context on its history: the section between Dublin (Heuston) and Portlaoise opened in 1847 as part of a connection to the city of Cork, while the Athlone branch was opened in 1859, and the link to Dublin Port in 1877; these were all built by the Great Southern and Western Railway.\n\nRolling Stock\n\nThe line is perhaps where the most unique stock on the Irish network is found, and includes:\n\nThe well-known Irish Rail 22000 Class railcars, which are built by Hyundai Rotem of South Korea in 2007, and can be seen on Intercity and Commuter services.\n\nThe speedy Irish Rail 201 Class locomotives, which were built by General Motors Diesel of Canada in 1994, and are closely related to the British Rail Class 66. These can be seen working on express services pulling Mark 4 coaches, but also on Freight.\n\nThe classic Irish Rail 071 Class locomotives were also built by General Motors Diesel of Canada — in 1976. They are mostly found on Freight, but occasionally haul rail tours.\n\nAlthough we have a different track gauge in Ireland (1600mm), it wouldn’t be the first non-standard gauge route in Train Simulator, and if a route of Victoria, Australia was ever released, you would be able to interchange the trains due to both having the same gauge. Hopefully this gets you to consider this or another Irish route, or gets any other readers to support the cause.\n\nAttached Files:\n\nupload_2023-2-22_18-35-26.jpeg\n\nFile size:\n\n632.3 KB\n\nViews:\n\n7\n\nIt's a nice suggestion, but has some barriers to overcome.\n\nTo start you'd have to make a new gauge of track. That's been done before for Cape gauge, metre gauge etc, but limits what stock you can realistically run on it. You'd also have to create quite a lot of all new rolling stock for it.\n\nOn the plus side, you could reuse quite a lot of general scenery assets from the UK.\n\nWould it have enough interest? I don't know. I'd prefer a trans-Siberian route if you're going to go broad gauge, though things Russian might be bit controversial at present."
