We are not particularly comfortable renting a car and driving and had planned to utilize train and buses for intercity (and taxis within cities) but I'm quite stressed now that I've discovered the Enterprise train will not run from Dublin to Belfast due to the new Belfast station change transition happening. Any suggestions/help on combined train and coach to get us there(with our luggage) and back or do we need to just tough it out and be anxious and drive? The Translink site and the Irish rail site are a bit vague for travelers coming from the states for the first time."
