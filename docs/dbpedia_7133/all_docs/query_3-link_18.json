        "text": "This page explains how to travel by train & ferry from Dublin & Ireland to Paris, Brussels and other European cities. Click here to for journeys starting in another city. Information current for 2024. Suggested hotels in Dublin.\n\nI want to go from Dublin to...\n\nBelfast London Paris Brussels Amsterdam\n\nDublin to all other European destinations\n\nBefore you buy your tickets\n\nTake a moment to read these tips for buying European train tickets. It answers all the usual questions, \"Do I need to book in advance or can I just buy at the station?\", \"Can I stop off?\", \"Are there Senior fares?\" and that old favourite, \"Should I buy an $800 railpass or just buy a 35 point-to-point ticket online?\". Click here to understand how far ahead you can buy train tickets.\n\nEuropean train travel FAQ\n\nTrain travel in Ireland\n\nSee the Train travel in Ireland page.\n\nThe Irish Railways website is www.irishrail.ie.\n\nDublin to Belfast from 13.99\n\nThe Enterprise links Dublin Connolly with Belfast every couple of hours, taking around 2 hours. It's jointly run by Irish Railways & Northern Ireland Railways (part of Translink). It has standard class, first class (also known as Enterprise Plus class) and a cafe-bar.\n\nReservation isn't essential, you can always just turn up, buy a ticket and hop on the next train from Dublin Connolly station to Belfast. But you may find some cheap advance-purchase fares from as low as 13.99 if you book in advance.\n\nIncidentally, Belfast Central was named after the Belfast Central Railway, not because of its location! It was renamed Belfast Lanyon Place in September 2018.\n\nBuy one-way or round-trip tickets starting in Dublin at www.irishrail.ie, you must collect your ticket from Irish Rail ticket machines in Dublin.\n\nBuy one-way or round-trip tickets starting in Belfast at www.translink.co.uk, you must exchange the confirmation email for a hard-copy ticket at Belfast Central station or another staffed NIR station.\n\nTip 1: Belfast's Great Victoria Street station is in the city centre and more convenient than Belfast Lanyon Place as it's next to the main bus station and the excellent Europa Hotel, across the road from the equally excellent National Trust-owned Crown Bar. If you hold a ticket for the Enterprise train between Belfast Lanyon Place & Dublin, you are entitled to a free transfer by regular local train between Belfast Lanyon Place and Belfast Great Victoria Street at no extra charge. Check trains online, in 2024 trains to Great Victoria Street station may be affected by construction of Belfast's new Grand Central station.\n\nTip 2: On the Enterprise, find a seat on the right hand side going north to Belfast, for the sea views.\n\nBack to top\n\nDublin to London or anywhere in Britain for 60\n\nSee the London to Ireland page for how to travel by Sail & Rail from Dublin to London or anywhere in Britain.\n\nYou can buy cheap SailRail tickets for train & ferry travel from any rail station in Ireland to any rail station in Britain at www.irishferries.com. Dublin to London costs 60. Cork, Limerick, Galway or Sligo to London costs 80. Any day, any time. Full details on the London to Ireland page or www.irishferries.com.\n\nBack to top\n\nDublin to Paris\n\nOption 1, Dublin to Paris using a direct ferry from Dublin or Rosslare to Cherbourg - several times a week\n\nStep 1, sail from Dublin or Rosslare to Cherbourg by ferry.\n\nIrish Ferries (www.irishferries.com) sail from Dublin to Cherbourg every 2-3 days all year. The ferry typically sails at 16:00 and arrives 11:30 next morning. Fares from around 51 + mandatory private cabin. Cabins start from around 74 for a 4-berth with shower & toilet.\n\nThis is the easiest route to use, their luxurious new superferry WB Yeats carries foot passengers on this route, a wonderful cruise with bars, restaurants & cosy private cabins. Their smaller ferry Epsilon doesn't carry foot passengers. Check schedules at www.irishferries.com.\n\nStena Line (www.stenaline.co.uk) sail every few days from Rosslare to Cherbourg, foot passengers carried. Sailings are overnight, times vary. A range of comfy private cabins is available. Trains link Dublin Connolly, Wicklow, Wexford & Rosslare Harbour, see www.irishrail.ie.\n\nIn Cherbourg, it's a 3.2 km 10-minute taxi ride or a 2.9 km 37-minute walk from the ferry terminal to the station, see walking map.\n\nStep 2, take a train from Cherbourg to Paris.\n\nIf you arrive in Cherbourg at 11:30 with Irish Ferries you should book a train after 13:00, there's usually one leaving Cherbourg around 14:40, arriving Paris St Lazare around 18:00.\n\nFares start from 20 if you book ahead and commit to a specific train, or costs around 55 if you turn up and buy on the day.\n\nCheck train times & prices from Cherbourg to Paris at www.thetrainline.com (easy to use, in , £ or $, overseas credit cards no problem, small booking fee) or the French Railways website www.sncf-connect.com (in , no booking fee).\n\nBooking usually opens 4 months ahead. You print your own ticket or can select a mobile ticket to show on your phone.\n\nOption 2, Dublin to Paris by Sail & Rail to London then Eurostar - across the UK, with daily departures\n\nFirst, buy a SailRail ticket from Dublin or anywhere in Ireland to London at www.irishferries.com from 60.\n\nSee the complete Dublin to London Sail & Rail timetable here. See full details of how to buy tickets here.\n\nI recommend using the all-weather-reliable ships when connecting for destinations beyond the UK, not the Swift fast ferry as this is cancelled when wave height exceeds 1 metre.\n\nThen buy a Eurostar ticket from London to Paris from £52 one-way, £78 return at www.eurostar.com, allowing plenty of time to change trains and stations in London in case of any delay, or stay overnight if necessary.\n\nFor example, take the 08:05 ferry from Dublin Ferryport to Holyhead, connecting with a train to London arriving 17:37 Monday-Friday, 16:37 Saturdays, 17:40 Sundays. You arrive at London Euston station, you can walk (9 minutes) along to St Pancras station where Eurostar departs, see walking map.

Go up the big escalators opposite platforms 1-4, exit the station and turn left along the station facade.\n\nStep 2, now travel overnight from London to Amsterdam by Stena Line Rail & Sail using train & overnight ferry from £55 with private cabin from £35, see the Stena Line Rail & Sail page.\n\nOption 3, Dublin to Amsterdam via Paris - by-passing the UK, several departures a week\n\nDay 1, travel from Dublin to Paris as shown above, sailing from Dublin late afternoon, sleeping in a cosy private cabin to Cherbourg and arriving Paris St Lazare by train at around 18:00 on Day 2.\n\nTransfer from Paris St Lazare to Paris Gare du Nord by taxi or metro. Always make sure you have at least 60 minutes between trains in Paris.\n\nDay 2, travel from Paris to Amsterdam by Eurostar (formerly Thalys) high-speed train), one usually leaves Paris Gare du Nord at 19:25 arriving Amsterdam Centraal 22:44.\n\nBack to top\n\nDublin to all other European destinations\n\nThere are three approaches: Sail & Rail to London, then Eurostar to Paris or Brussels, then onward trains; Sail & Rail to London, then Sail & Rail to Amsterdam then onward trains; Or by-pass the UK, taking a direct ferry from Dublin or Rosslare to Cherbourg and train to Paris, then onward trains from Paris.\n\nVia London & Eurostar to Paris or Brussels\n\nStep 1, take the 08:05 SailRail service to London Euston as shown on the Britain-Ireland page, booked at www.irishferries.com for 60.\n\nStay overnight in London (unless your chosen onward journey involves an evening Eurostar to Paris and overnight there).\n\nStep 2, travel from London St Pancras to any European destination using Eurostar to Paris or Brussels, as shown when you select your destination country here.\n\nFor example, you can travel from Dublin to London on Day 1, stay overnight, then travel from London to Barcelona, Milan, Geneva, Zurich or Munich on Day 2.\n\nOr you can travel from Dublin to London on Day 1 and take an evening Eurostar to Paris. Stay overnight, then travel from Paris to Barcelona, Madrid, Vienna, Copenhagen, Warsaw (Mon-Fri only), Madrid on Day 2. I'd allow at least 2 hours between trains in London, to include the 10-minute walk from Euston station to St Pancras station and the Eurostar check-in.\n\nVia London & ferry to Hoek van Holland\n\nStep 1, take the 08:05 SailRail service to London Euston as shown on the Ireland page, booked at www.irishferries.com for 60.\n\nStep 2, take the overnight train & ferry service from London Liverpool Street to Amsterdam, sleeping in a private cabin on the Stena Line superferry with shower, toilet, satellite TV & WiFi, booked as shown on the Stena Line Rail & Sail page from £55 plus private cabin from around £35. Spend a day exploring Amsterdam.\n\nStep 3, take an onwards train from Amsterdam as shown on the international trains from Amsterdam page.\n\nThere are direct daytime trains from Amsterdam to Cologne, Frankfurt, Berlin. There are sleeper trains from Amsterdam to Basel, Zurich, Munich, Innsbruck & Vienna.\n\nBy direct ferry from Ireland to France\n\nStep 1, travel by ferry direct from Ireland to France & on to Paris as shown above. Allow plenty of time between trains in Paris.\n\nStep 2, travel from Paris to your mainland European destination as shown on the Trains from Paris page.\n\nFor example, you could sail from Dublin at 16:00 on Day 1, reaching Paris around 16:00 on Day 2.\n\nYou could catch an onward train to Lyon, Marseille, Cologne, Frankfurt or Geneva the same day, arriving late evening on Day 2.\n\nIf you took a sleeper, you could be in Munich, Salzburg or Vienna in the morning of Day 3.\n\nIf you stayed in Paris overnight, you could travel on to Nice, Cannes, Barcelona, Milan & Italy or Prague on Day 3.\n\nBy direct ferry from Ireland to Spain\n\nStep 1, travel from Dublin to Rosslare by train, www.irishrail.ie.\n\nThe train arrives at a platform a few minutes walk from the ferry terminal, but allow plenty of time between train and ferry. When the ferry sails 08:00, you'll need to travel to Rosslare the evening before.\n\nStep 3, take a train from Bilbao to Madrid, Barcelona, San Sebastian or anywhere elsewhere in Spain.\n\nThere are two daily high-speed trains from Bilbao Abando station to Madrid Chamartin, journey time around 4h50, and two direct daily trains to Barcelona, journey time 6h40, see www.thetrainline.com (easiest to use, in , £ or $) or www.renfe.com (in , much more fiddly) for times, fares & online booking. I'd recommend allowing several hours between the ship's arrival and any onward train booking, to allow for transfer time and any delay to the ship.\n\nBilbao's Matiko station has hourly narrow gauge trains to San Sebastian (Donostia-Amara) every hour or half-hour, taking 2h35, www.euskotren.eus.\n\nBack to top\n\nHotels in Dublin & Ireland\n\nFor advice on hotels in Dublin, see the hotels section here.\n\nBackpacker hostels\n\nwww.hostelworld.com: If you're on a tight budget, don't forget about backpacker hostels. Hostelworld offers online booking of cheap private rooms or dorm beds in backpacker hostels in most cities at rock-bottom prices.\n\nBack to top\n\nTravel insurance & VPN\n\nAlways take out travel insurance\n\nNever travel overseas without travel insurance from a reliable insurer, with at least £1m or preferably £5m medical cover. It should also cover cancellation and loss of cash and belongings, up to a sensible limit. An annual multi-trip policy is usually cheaper than several single-trip policies even for just 2 or 3 trips a year, I have an annual policy with Staysure.co.uk myself. Here are some suggested insurers. Seat61 gets a small commission if you buy through these links.\n\nwww.staysure.co.uk offers enhanced Covid-19 protection & gets 4.7 out of 5 on Trustpilot.\n\nwww.columbusdirect.com is also a well-know brand.\n\nIf you live in the USA try Travel Guard USA.\n\nGet an eSIM with mobile data package\n\nDon't rely on WiFi, download an eSIM with a mobile data package for the country you're visiting and stay connected. Most newer mobile phones can download a virtual SIM card so you don't need to buy a physical SIM, including iPhone 11 & later, see device compatibility list. Maya.net is a reliable eSIM data retailer with a 4.5 out of 5 Trustpilot rating and a range of packages including unlimited data.\n\nGet a Curve card for foreign travel\n\nMost banks give you a poor exchange rate, then add a foreign transaction fee on top. A Curve MasterCard means no foreign transaction fees and gives you the mid-market exchange rate, at least up to a certain limit, £500 per month at time of writing. The money you spend on your Curve card goes straight onto one of your existing debit or credit cards.\n\nHow it works: 1. Download the Curve app for iPhone or Android. 2. Enter your details & they'll send you a Curve MasterCard - they send to the UK and most European addresses. 3. Link your existing credit & debit cards to the app, you can link up to two cards with the free version of Curve, I link my normal debit card and my normal credit card. 4. Now use the Curve MasterCard to buy things online or in person or take cash from ATMs, exactly like a normal MasterCard. Curve does the currency conversion and puts the balance in your own currency onto whichever debit or credit card is currently selected in the Curve app. You can even change your mind about which card it goes onto, within 14 days of the transaction.\n\nI have a Curve Blue card myself, it means I can buy a coffee on a foreign station on a card without being stung by fees and lousy exchange rates, just by tapping the Curve card on their card reader. The money goes through Curve to my normal debit card and is taken directly from my account (in fact I have the Curve card set up as payment card on Apple Pay on my iPhone, so can double-click my phone, let it do Face ID then tap the reader with the phone - even easier than digging a card out). I get a little commission if you sign up to Curve, but I recommend it here because I think it's great. See details, download the app and get a Curve card, they'll give you £5 cashback through that link.\n\nGet a VPN for safe browsing. Why you need a VPN\n\nWhen you're travelling you often use free WiFi in public places which may not be secure. A VPN encrypts your connection so it's always secure, even on unsecured WiFi. It also means you can select the geographic location of the IP address you browse with, to get around geoblocking which a surprising number of websites apply. See VPNs & why you need one explained. ExpressVPN is a best buy with a 4.7 out of 5 Trustpilot ranking which I use myself - I've signed up as an ExpressVPN affiliate, and if you go with expressvpn.com using the links on this page, you should see a special deal, 3 months free with an annual subscription. I get a small commission to help support this site.\n\nCarry an Anker powerbank\n\nTickets, reservations, vaccination records and Interrail or Eurail passes are often held digitally on your mobile phone, so it's vital to keep it charged. I always carry an Anker powerbank which can recharge my phone several times over if I can't get to a power outlet. Buy from Amazon.co.uk or from buy from Amazon.com.\n\nBack to top"
