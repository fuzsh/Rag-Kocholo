        "text": "Unfortunately family illness has meant I have not blogged for a while, and posts will remain sporadic. Nevertheless, it is worth courting a bit of controversy over the fascinating proposal for a Belfast Circle Line. What can air routes, about which I have written in the past, teach us about the viability of the proposal?\n\nProposal\n\nThe proposal itself with regard to the Belfast Circle Line (which I first saw from “NI Planner” on Twitter; I am leaving aside the new line from Derry to Lurgan in this piece as this post does not concern new infrastructure as such, but rather amended use of existing lines) has two very significant merits from the start. Firstly, it is superbly presented – it is very clear what it is. Secondly, it is far enough but not too far into the future – maintaining both a degree of viability and a degree of relevance.\n\nHowever, that does not mean it is beyond challenge. Fundamentally, the question is does it solve a problem and, if so, what is the problem that it is trying to solve?\n\nFor reasons explained in the past, it is not quite good enough to say that the problem is there is a piece of line not being used and an airport without a rail link. Lots of railways lines are not used (although in fact the Antrim-Knockmore one is, just not for public travel), and lots of airports are not linked to city centres by train (in fact the vast majority in the UK and Ireland).\n\nHowever, it could be argued that by mid-century a growing population in western population and a growing relevance of the airport will change that a bit. How likely is that, and how likely then is it that the solution is a lot more heavy rail passenger halts north, west and south of Belfast? What other options should be looked at?\n\nWell, let us do a thought experiment involving our old favourite, aviation.\n\nConcorde\n\nConcorde was a revelation when it first came into existence, with the obviously attractive proposition of London or Paris to New York or Washington in just three hours.\n\nYet it no longer exists.\n\nWhy?\n\nPlainly, it is not because the technology does not exist – it did over half a century ago, and it does now.\n\nUltimately, it is because it is not viable.\n\nWhy?\n\nThe “three hour” proposition in fact only works if you charge passengers a premium, as the plane itself did (would) not carry that many of them (although it filled up the cabin area as best it could to carry as many as possible); fuel costs too have to be taken into account. Therefore, there is only really a “business class” charged at “first class” prices.\n\nYet the “three hours” are in fact specifically from an airport in London or Paris to an airport in New York or Washington. If you want to go from Dublin to Boston, or Frankfurt to Atlanta, or even actually Manchester to New York or London to Chicago, the added trip required before or after makes it entirely pointless. The “three hours” only works for a specific population area (and segment – those who can afford it, most likely through business) either side.\n\nLondon-Sydney\n\nShortly before Covid, as noted on these pages, a passenger plane took off at Heathrow in west London and landed, just under twenty hours later, in Sydney.\n\nYet there is no real proposition of a directly London-Sydney link – indeed, even London-Perth is in peril.\n\nWhy?\n\nAs noted back then, this is because to run a London-Sydney link viably you cannot have an economy class – everyone has to be at least business. That cuts out a lot of passengers before you start.\n\nAlso, London to Sydney again cuts out a lot of people. If you are actually going to Melbourne, why go London-Sydney-Melbourne when you can go London-Dubai-Melbourne or London-Singapore-Melbourne or maybe even London-Perth-Melbourne? If you are actually starting in Dublin, why go Dublin-London-Sydney when you can cut it more evenly and go Dublin-Frankfurt-Sydney or Dublin-Dubai-Sydney? Even if you have the means, unless you specifically want to go from the London area to the Sydney area you will lack the motivation. Even then, you may simply want to stretch your legs at a stopover.\n\nStopovers to Cape Town\n\nYet the reverse also applies. It used to be, for example, that stopovers were required even on flights from Europe to much nearer Southern Africa. Now, direct flights are expected.\n\nThis is partly because 12 hours is simply seen as more palatable than 20; but it is also because few people wish to break up the flight roughly midway.\n\nWhereas a Dublin-Dubai-Sydney route will cover not just people who want to go from Dublin to Sydney but also those wanting to go from Dublin to Dubai (and possibly on to Bangkok or Singapore or Auckland or Hong Kong) and those want to go from Dubai (possibly originating in Frankfurt or Paris or Amsterdam or Madrid) to Sydney, no equivalent centre point currently exists en route to Southern Africa. Many flights to other Southern African cities do initially touch down at Johannesburg (and then go on to Lusaka or Durban or wherever), but fundamentally they get to Southern Africa direct.\n\nBalance\n\nIn other words, there is a balance between requiring a particular number of people to want to go on a particular route and adding enough stopovers which collect as many as possible to make it viable, without adding so many that the journey just becomes unacceptably long.\n\nAnd that brings us to our Belfast Circle Line…\n\nEnterprise\n\nLet us look first of all at the Enterprise train, from Belfast to Dublin.\n\nOver half a century ago, in fact, this train briefly went on to Cork – which, by the above theory, could work because that would catch people wanting to go Belfast-Dublin, Dublin-Cork as well as Belfast-Cork. In practice, it proved unviable – it turns out people want to go Belfast-Dublin or Dublin-Cork, but the relatively few going Belfast-Cork are happy to change in Dublin.\n\nInterestingly, however, the train does stop at Portadown, Newry, Dundalk and Drogheda (usually). To be viable, therefore, it cannot just be a Belfast-Dublin express – it does need those extra stops (to cover people wanting to go from Belfast to Dundalk or Portadown to Dublin, for example).\n\nIn other words, you need enough stops to keep it interesting, but not so many as to make it unacceptably slow at covering the overall route.\n\nCircle Line\n\nThis is the first problem the Circle Line – at least, if it is to be envisaged as heavy rail – runs into. It in fact adds stops in an attempt to attract people on to the trains – but in all likelihood this would succeed only in making them unviable; if there is one key takeaway from this piece, it is probably this.\n\nThe key point here is that every extra stop adds, typically, four minutes to the overall travel time (this may be slightly reduced if the train does not get up to speed between halts anyway). Already Belfast all stops to Lisburn is 25 minutes, but the express is just 10.\n\nFor a more concrete example, Jordanstown to Belfast Lanyon Place takes 14 minutes, and to “Grand Central” (Great Victoria Street) 24 minutes – add walking time from an average nearby residence and this may be more like 25 minutes and 35, so probably around five to fifteen minutes slower than the car but the train has various advantages to make it more than viable. However, if you add four further halts (at Abbey Centre, Loughside Park, York Street and Cathedral Quarter as proposed), this suddenly becomes more like 40 and 50 minutes merely to get from Jordanstown to the city centre! It is unlikely that would be tolerated.\n\nWho cares about Jordanstown and why is this relevant? Well, let us then look at a train from Belfast Airport – it would have to stop at Antrim, at a new stop at Templepatrick (and given the Park & Ride there, there is no doubt this is a good idea), at Mossley West, and then in as from Jordanstown. Before even considering the wait time for the train, that journey would already take around 40 minutes just to Lanyon Place – add four stops and it’s over an hour to “Grand Central”! As against car or even bus (not least with added bus lanes even on the motorway), this is completely uncompetitive, obviously.\n\nLikewise, the other way around is not really viable – it is already 25 minutes from Lisburn into “Grand Central” stopping at all stops; add Knockmore/Lisburn West, Ballinderry, Crumlin and Glenavy and, well…\n\nSolution\n\nThere are some solutions to this, however.\n\nFirstly, barring the reinstatement of Templepatrick and Knockmore/Lisburn West (the latter of which is already clearly proposed and the former under consideration), you could leave the stops as they are (including skipping Whiteabbey on all but the Larne line); this would begin to make an airport link viable at perhaps just under 40 minutes to Lanyon Place – this would combine a reasonable number of stops to attract extra passengers but not so many as to make the route pointless as against other options.\n\nSecondly, you could have the circle line express from Lisburn into Belfast; this would knock 15 minutes off the time (or perhaps, even with a stop at Balmoral to serve a growing population there, 11 minutes) and make that way around from the airport at least a proposition for people living south west of the city centre or wishing to connect onward further out in that direction.\n\n(There remain considerable issues, of course, not least that the whole Antrim-Knockmore line is single track with passing loops all now removed. No one said this would be cheap!)\n\nThirdly, you could at least consider laying new track straight from the airport to Templepatrick or even towards Mossley West; this, however, would be hugely expensive and in practice would only begin to be viable if it were the only airport (with considerably higher passenger numbers on its own) or if a major business or science park were placed next to it to be served by the same station.\n\nHowever, the real solution may in fact be light rail or rapid transit. Many of the proposed extra stops – including the link to Belfast Port – could be covered by a rapid transit system based (at least in part) around Yorkgate. In practice, for example, a train in from the airport could reach Yorkgate in half an hour and thus connect to an inner-city rapid transit network taking passengers to their final destination even away from the city centre – at Titanic or out towards Newtownbreda, Dunmurry or Dundonald, for example. If Airport-Yorkgate becomes your spine route and there are adequate connections either side, then there is at least some prospect of it becoming genuinely viable as it would mean the train from the airport to close to the city centre would make good time while at the same time enabling connecting passengers to use it and then go elsewhere.\n\nMid century\n\nFor all that, it should be noted that even this only begins to work in the event of much greater activity close to the airport and perhaps elsewhere west of the city; currently, it is not viable because you would have to run trains (and thus turn on the entire railway network at least from the Belfast control centre) much earlier than is currently the case and much more regularly along the Antrim line, and there simply is not likely to be the demand right now. In any case, plenty of railway lines are unused and plenty of airports the size of Belfast’s manage with bus connections. In other words, the Circle Line does not currently solve a problem that really exists.\n\nA lot could change by mid-century, however, and that is exactly why it is a good proposal and a very good example of the type of forward thinking we should be engaging in – even if it is likely to need considerable amendment in practice."
