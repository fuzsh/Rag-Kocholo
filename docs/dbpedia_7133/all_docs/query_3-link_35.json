        "text": "Rail services between Dublin and Belfast have been replaced by bus transfer since July 3 until the early autumn at the northern end, reports Hassard Stacpoole. This closure is to allow engineering works related to the delivery of the new Belfast Grand Central Station.\n\nWork includes the realignment of the track to serve the new station, the installation and upgrading of the signalling system, alongside a period of testing, commissioning, and training.\n\nBelfast Grand Central Station will be the new terminus for Dublin-Belfast and local rail services when it opens later this year, and will enable the introduction of hourly services between the two capitals. It will have eight platforms and will be part of an integrated transport hub.\n\nAt present there are no rail services between Belfast Lanyon Place and Lisburn, with intermediate stations closed and tickets accepted on scheduled buses. Northern Ireland transport operator Translink is also running an express bus substitution over the eight-mile route to mitigate the disruption.\n\nA Translink spokesperson said “During this line closure, we are also extending platforms at Adelaide station. Other general platform maintenance works and platform resurfacing are being carried out at a number of stations and Ticket Vending Machines are being installed.”\n\nAs a result, Enterprise services between Dublin and Belfast are operating between Dublin and Portadown only. A revised rail service is operating between Lisburn and Portadown, with a bus transfer between Newry and Belfast.\n\nTranslink is unable to give a definite date when services are to resume, but the closure is due to last at least six weeks until early September."
