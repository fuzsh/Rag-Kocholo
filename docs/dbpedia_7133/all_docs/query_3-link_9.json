        "text": "The train service between Belfast and Dublin is set to be improved thanks to a €165million investment from the PEACEPLUS programme that will fund a major transformation of the cross-border “Enterprise” service.\n\nAn hourly timetable and shorter journey times of at least 1 hour 55 minutes between Dublin and Belfast will come after new trains are introduced as part of the Enterprise Fleet Replacement Programme.\n\nThe programme is scheduled to be completed by 2030 with funding by the PEACEPLUS programme, and contributions from the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland and the Department of Transport in Ireland.\n\nAs part of the programme, eight new, modern, and sustainable trains will replace the current Enterprise fleet of four-carriage trains.\n\nBoth jurisdictions aim to have a fully electrified cross-border rail corridor over the coming decades, and the new trains will support net zero carbon emission aims.\n\nThe PEACEPLUS Programme aims to promote peace and prosperity across Northern Ireland and the border counties of Ireland. It has a total value of €1.14 billion for the next five years, is managed by the Special EU Programmes Body, and is funded by the European Union, the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Government of Ireland and the Northern Ireland Executive.\n\nElsewhere in Ireland, south of the border, Alstom is installing the European Train Control System (ETCS), and Northern Ireland's public transport operator Translink has signed an agreement with SISCOG to revolutionise its daily operations; SISCOG provides optimisation of resources and company solutions for London Underground.\n\nI am satisfied and happy that the EU plays an important role in this new major investment by the Peace Plus Programme. The thrust of the programme has always been about transformation, regeneration and creating thriving communities. The EUR 165 million investment in improving the cross-border rail service between Belfast and Dublin by the Enterprise Fleet Replacement Programme transforms these ambitions into reality.\n\nThe investment will bring concrete benefits for the local communities. Citizens and businesses will have easier and quicker access to Dublin and Belfast and be more connected. This will help the local communities grow and create opportunities, while delivering on the net zero carbon emissions goal.\n\nI would also like to underline the constructive, creative and collaborative approach between the Irish and UK Governments, the Northern Ireland Executive, SEUPB and the European Union, which are all vital components in ensuring the success of the Peace Plus Programme.\n\nElisa Ferreira, European Commissioner for Cohesion and Reforms\n\nThis is an exciting time for rail travel. The new fleet will pave the way for the Enterprise service to become the first electrified inter-city service on the island which will support our decarbonisation commitments.\n\nThe investment will improve the experience of people travelling by train and encourage others to use these services. By doing so you will be playing your part in our shared journey to net zero as well as enjoying the many benefits to be gained by rail travel.\n\nJohn O'Dowd, Department for Infrastructure Minister\n\nI welcome this significant investment in the Enterprise Fleet Replacement Programme. The flagship Enterprise service is a very visible and well-known symbol of North-South cooperation and this replacement programme is a key priority of both Governments.\n\nThe programme will significantly improve accessibility between the two largest cities on the island through increased service frequency and a faster journey time.\n\nThis is another indication of the ambition we have to put the island of Ireland on track for a new age of rail, connecting more cities and towns and opening up quality rail service to more people.\n\nThe funding for this programme under the PEACEPLUS programme and from both Government Departments demonstrates the positive impact cooperation has on meeting our shared goals of a cleaner, greener, interconnected all-island future.\n\nEamon Ryan TD, Department for Transport Minister\n\n“I am so pleased by the news of the fantastic investment that is going into the Enterprise Fleet Replacement Programme through the PEACEPLUS programme.\n\nThe transformation of cross-border rail services between Belfast and Dublin is going to create unique and exciting opportunities for both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland alike. We should not underestimate the impact that this infrastructure will have on the economic growth of the region, by ensuring there are the right conditions in place to thrive, prosper and be the best place in the world to invest.\n\nA key theme of PEACEPLUS is collaboration and partnership – through this programme I look forward to working with the Irish Government, Northern Ireland Executive and SEUPB to ensure that our shared ambitions for peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland and the Border Counties of Ireland are realised. The UK's £730 million investment into PEACEPLUS was only the first step to building on these ambitions.\n\nRt Hon Chris Heaton-Harris MP, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland\n\nThis €165m investment in cross-border rail services aligns closely to a key ambition of the PEACEPLUS Programme, to support a sustainable and better-connected future.\n\nWe know that transport is a crucial economic driver, as it connects businesses with markets and facilitates employee mobility, as well as providing access to education, health and leisure services. This major investment in the transformation of the Enterprise service will serve as a catalyst for regeneration and economic growth for all areas along the Dublin to Belfast economic corridor.\n\nPeace and prosperity are two sides of the same coin, and this ambitious and forward-looking project will deliver on both of those aspirations by enhancing the economic viability of the region, while improving the social connectivity between people and place.\n\nGina McIntyre, SEUPB Chief Executive"
