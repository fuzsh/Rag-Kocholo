        "text": "George Best Belfast City Airport\n\nBelfast City Airport is just three miles from Belfast City Centre. Aer Lingus Regional, British Airways, KLM, EasyJet and Eastern Airways all fly to and from Belfast City Airport.\n\nThe Translink Airport Express 600 bus service runs between the airport and Belfast City Centre.\n\nBelfast International Airport\n\nBelfast International Airport is a 30 minute drive from Belfast City Centre. EasyJet, Ryanair, Jet2, Virgin Atlantic, TUI and Wizz all fly to and from Belfast International Airport.\n\nThe Translink Airport Express 300 bus service runs between the airport and Belfast City Centre.\n\nCruise Ship Passengers\n\nIf you are travelling to Belfast on a cruise ship, there is generally a shuttle bus service from the port to the Visit Belfast Welcome Centre in Belfast City Centre and vice versa. The precise timings of these shuttle buses will be available on the day you arrive. There may be a charge for the shuttle bus service, which is set by the cruise ship company. The shuttle bus from the cruise terminal drops off and picks up from outside the Visit Belfast Welcome Centre, 9 Donegall Square North (opposite Belfast City Hall).\n\nA taxi from the cruise terminal to Belfast City Centre costs approximately £10 – £13 depending on which dock your ship uses. Value Cabs is one of Belfast’s largest taxi providers. You can book a taxi by phoning +(0)28 9080 9080 or download the Value Cabs app from the App Store or Google Play Store.\n\nFrom Dublin and Republic of Ireland\n\nIrish Rail operates services from towns and cities across the Republic of Ireland to Dublin’s Connolly Station, where you can then catch a connecting train to Belfast.\n\nThe Enterprise Train service (provided jointly by Translink and Irish Rail), from Dublin’s Connolly Station to Lanyon Station (previously known as Belfast Central Station), runs eight times daily (five times on Sundays) and takes 2 hours 15 minutes. Book in advance at www.irishrail.ie for the best value fares.\n\nYour Enterprise ticket includes free onward rail travel from Lanyon Station (previously known as Belfast Central Station) to Titanic Quarter Station (train stop for the Titanic Belfast visitor attraction) as well as a free Metro Bus Service from Lanyon Station (previously known as Belfast Central Station) to the city centre (Belfast City Hall area).\n\nFrom Dublin and Republic of Ireland\n\nFrom Dublin, the X1 bus service (provided jointly by Translink and Bus Eireann) operates from Dublin Busáras in the city centre and Dublin Airport to Belfast, with 21 departures every day.\n\nThe journey time from Dublin to Belfast is approximately 2 hours.\n\nFor more information on routes and fares, visit www.translink.co.uk. Please note tickets are only available to purchase 3 weeks prior to travel date.\n\nFrom Dublin\n\nStarting out at Dublin Airport, the M1 Motorway is well signposted for Belfast; this is a toll road and there is one toll plaza approximately 31 km from Dublin Airport. Continue on this motorway signposted for Belfast.\n\nJust after passing the city of Newry, the road becomes a dual carriageway (A1) and motorway regulations fall away. At the Sprucefield roundabout (approximately 137 km from Dublin Airport) the A1 joins the M1 motorway (signposted The North, Belfast).\n\nOnce within the Greater Belfast area, the signs will display as City Centre. At Grosvenor Road Junction (approximately 152 km from Dublin) leave the motorway and follow signs for City Centre onto the B38."
