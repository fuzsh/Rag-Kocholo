        "text": "Heavy Rail\n\nInfrastructure Manager\n\nIarnród Éireann Infrastructure Manager provides and maintains the infrastructure network in the Republic of Ireland. The network extends to approximately 2,400 km of operational track, c.4,440 bridges, c.1,100 point ends, c.970 level crossings, 144 stations, 3,300+ cuttings and embankments, 372 platforms and 13 tunnels. The network includes mainline, Dublin suburban and commuter passenger routes together with freight-only routes.\n\nRailway Undertaking\n\nIarnród Éireann Railway Undertaking operates all Intercity, Commuter, DART and freight railway services in the State and jointly with Translink Northern Ireland Railways the service between Dublin and Belfast.\n\nInformation on Iarnród Éireann Railway Undertaking rolling stock can be found here.\n\nTranslink Northern Ireland Railways provide an Intercity rail passenger service jointly with Iarnród Éireann Railway Undertaking between Dublin and Belfast.\n\nMore information on Translink can be found here.\n\nRhomberg Sersa Ireland provide technical and engineering services to Iarnród Éireann focused on the on operation of on track machines for the maintenance of the track and supporting infrastructure.\n\nMore information on Rhomberg Sersa can be found here.\n\nRailway Preservation Society of Ireland was formed in 1964 to preserve Irish steam locomotives, carriages and rolling stock and to operate them on the Irish railway network. The society depends on volunteers to keep its stock of steam trains operational.\n\nMore information on the RPSI can be found here.\n\nLight Rail\n\nDublin’s Light Rail system (LUAS) is operated and maintained by Transdev on behalf of Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII). The LUAS has the Red and Green lines which between them have 46km of track.\n\nMore information on Transdev can be found here.\n\nIn relation to both heavy and light rail the CRR is required to ensure that operator understands and effectively manages the risk to safety associated with its activities. This is achieved in three ways.\n\nFirstly, they are required to have a safety management system (SMS) approved by the CRR. This document shows how they will identify, control and manage risk associated with their business. It should also document how it will manage its staff’s competence, its internal auditing, its emergency preparedness etc.\n\nSecondly, they are required to submit applications to the CRR if it wishes to bring into operation any new or significantly altered rolling stock or infrastructure. CRR Inspectors will review such applications and must issue a ‘Letter of Acceptance’ before any new or significantly altered rolling stock or infrastructure may be brought into operation.\n\nThirdly, they are subject to ongoing CRR Supervision, that is auditing compliance with the procedures and standards prescribed in its approved SMS, and inspection of railway assets to assess compliance with fitness for purpose criteria.\n\nHeritage Railways\n\nA “heritage railway” is where train services or railway infrastructure of historical or touristic interest operate. In the republic of Ireland there are currently 7 operational heritage railways. These are;\n\nDifflin Lake Railway, Oakfield, Raphoe, Co Donegal;\n\nFinntown & Glenties Railway, Co Donegal;\n\nListowel Lartigue Monorail, Co Kerry;\n\nWaterford & Suir Valley Railway (W&SVR);\n\nIrish Steam Preservation Society, Stradbally, Co Laois;\n\nLullymore Heritage & Discovery Park Limited, Rathangan, Co Kildare.\n\nCavan & Leitrim Railway, Dromod, Co Leitrim\n\nThese heritage railways are required to have a safety management system (SMS) approved by the CRR and having been granted a safety management certificate they are inspected by the CRR. The purpose of which is to check that they are following their SMS and are managing their operational and asset risks.\n\nCableways\n\nThere is presently only one cableway operating in the state, this is located at Lambs Head Co Cork and connects Dursey Island to the mainland across the Dursey Sound. The cableway which was opened in 1969 is owned and operated by Cork County Council.\n\nThe CRR are the designated competent authority in relation to Cableway Installations designed to carry persons in Ireland and our function is to ensure compliance with the relevant legislation.\n\nMetro\n\nThere is currently no Metro in Ireland, however there is a proposal for MetroLink which is to be developed by Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII). The proposal is for a high-capacity, high-frequency rail line running from Swords to Charlemont. TII will be required to obtain Authorisation to Place in Service for Metrolink is from the CRR as part of the project development."
