        "text": "Tickets\n\n[edit]\n\nComing by ferry always look for \"rail & sail\" through tickets. These are considerably cheaper than buying separate train and ferry tickets, and take care of the connection. You should be able to buy a through-ticket from any mainline station in Great Britain to Belfast or Dublin. All the GB ferry ports have railway services except Cairnryan (north of Stranraer, for Belfast and Larne): rail passengers change at Ayr for the connecting bus.\n\nRail tickets are inexpensive, thanks to competition from the buses, so there's not much scope for discount fares. Indeed some supposed \"discounts\" cost more than standard fares, see below. Season tickets are better value but only benefit regular travellers, see the Irish Rail and Translink websites. There are no cross-border season tickets, but a \"carnet\" or bundle of tickets is available for mainline stations on the Belfast-Dublin route.\n\nIn the Republic it's the same price for a return ticket as there-and-back singles. Suppose you want to travel from Dublin to Kilkenny, as of July 2021 you'd pay:\n\n- \"Low\" fare booked more than 48 hours in advance, and changeable within that period: €12.99 single\n\n- \" Semi-flexible\" fare booked and changeable more than 24 hours in advance: €13.99 single\n\n- \"Flexible\" fare for immediate travel, though changeable up to an hour in advance: €14.49 single\n\nFares quoted here are from Dublin Heuston. From city centre you need to take the tram out to Heuston, which costs €2.10. Or you can have your ticket made out from Dublin Connolly in city centre, which will include the tram fare, but you only save about 60c by doing so.\n\nSo there's not much in the price, and it doesn't matter whether you travel on- or off-peak, or whether you day-trip or have an extended stay. You need to weigh up flexibility (what time will your flight really land?) versus ensuring you get aboard a train that may book out. The fares for buses are pretty similar.\n\nBooking is only available for inter-city trains, up to 90 days in advance. Commuter and DART trains may also run the same route: fares are identical but there's no booking.\n\nIn Northern Ireland it's even simpler. In July 2021 a trip from Belfast to Derry is £13 single by train or bus, with no difference between immediate, peak-period or advanced tickets. No standard rail returns are sold, but see below for the Day Return and other discounts. Yes yes, in the interests of community cohesion, it's the exact same fare to Londonderry.\n\nFrom Dublin Heuston\n\n[edit]\n\nTo Cork hourly, 2 hr 40 min from Heuston via Kildare, Portarlington, Portlaoise, Ballybrophy, Templemore, Thurles, Limerick Junction, Charleville and Mallow to Cork Kent.\n\nTo Limerick hourly, 2 hours, from Heuston via Newbridge, Kildare, Monasterevin, Portarlington, Portlaoise, Ballybrophy, Templemore, Thurles and Limerick Junction (where you may have to change) to Limerick Colbert.\n\nTo Galway hourly, 2 hr 30 min from Heuston via Newbridge, Kildare, Monasterevin, Portarlington, Tullamore, Clara, Athlone, Ballinasloe, Woodlawn, Attymon and Athenry to Galway Ceannt.\n\nTo Tralee there's one direct service per day, but with connections every couple of hours. The journey is four hours from Heuston via Portlaoise, Thurles, Limerick Junction, Charleville, Mallow (where you usually change), Banteer, Millstreet, Rathmore, Killarney and Farranfore to Tralee Casement.\n\nTo Waterford every hour or two, 2 hr 15 min from Heuston via Newbridge, Kildare, Athy, Carlow, Bagenalstown / Muine Bheag, Kilkenny and Thomastown to Waterford Plunkett.\n\nTo Westport and Ballina four a day, 3 hr 30 min from Heuston via Newbridge, Kildare, Tullamore, Clara, Athlone (where you may have to change), Roscommon, Castlerea, Ballyhaunis, Claremorris, Manulla Junction, Castlebar and Westport. A connecting train at Manulla Junction runs via Foxford to Ballina."
