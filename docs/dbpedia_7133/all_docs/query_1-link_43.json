        "text": "“This is an important day for the island of Ireland. This is not just the first All-Island Strategic Rail Review, it is the most ambitious vision for rail in a century, bringing us forward to a new age of rail. This vision has been made possible by close cooperation between the Departments and agencies north and south.\n\n“Rail not only allows us to carry more people and freight in a more sustainable way, it is the great connector, enabling greater regional accessibility and balanced regional development. The Report provides a long-term vision and a series of recommendations for the sustainable development of the rail network on the island. I would like to see the recommendations actioned as soon as possible, and I am pleased that work is now well underway, with European Investment Bank assistance, on how we can move forward.”\n\n“The publication of the Final Report of the All-Island Strategic Rail Review, the first of its kind across this island, is historic and I am pleased that we have reached this point. The Report provides an evidence-based framework to help guide future investment in our rail network, and will help us meet our climate commitments. The Review has been an excellent example of joint collaboration on cross-border priorities, and this continued partnership will be key to realising its ambitions.\n\n“This publication brings us to a new chapter where we can shape a better future for everyone by decarbonising key services and investing in climate adaptation measures, while at the same time supporting economic productivity through projects, policy and legislation. Getting infrastructure right, and investing in it accordingly, can create the foundations for better rural and urban communities.”"
