        "text": "If you’re travelling from Scotland then it may be quicker to travel to Ireland via Northern Ireland using the Cairnryan Belfast ferry operated by Stena Line. There is no train station at the port of Cairnryan so your train will stop at Ayr where they’ll be a coach provided by Stena Line to transfer you to Cairnryan port for the ferry trip to Belfast (see timetable within booking system). On arrival in Belfast port you’ll need to transfer to the centre and then to Belfast central train station in order to travel onwards to Ireland. The Translink Metro service 96 connects you to the city (though may not be aligned with ferry arrivals – check timetable before you travel) or alternatively there are taxis just outside the terminal building. Transfers are not included in the price of the Rail Sail ticket.\n\nCairnryan Belfast Ferry - 5 Sailings Daily / 2 hrs 15 mins\n\nIf you’re travelling from Wales or England then the best option to rail and sail to Northern Ireland will be via Dublin using the Holyhead Dublin ferry crossing which is operated by Irish Ferries and Stena Line. On arrival in Dublin port in Ireland, for onward travel to Northern Ireland you’ll need to get a transfer to Dublin Connolly train station. Transfers are not included in the price of the Rail Sail ticket and range between €2.50 and €5 per adult depending on your destination.\n\nHolyhead Dublin Ferry - 4 Sailings Daily / 3 hrs 15 mins\n\nHolyhead Dublin Ferry - 6 Sailings Daily / 2 hrs 15 mins\n\nA train and ferry to Ireland combined ticket via Rosslare Europort in Southern Ireland uses the Fishguard Rosslare service operated by Stena Line. For onward travel from the port of Rosslare Europort you'll need to buy a separate onward train or bus ticket when you get there (as onward travel is not included if you travel via Rosslare). There is a train station around 600 metres from the foot passenger terminal with connections to Dublin (see www.irishrail.ie) or alternatively Bus Eireann (see www.buseireann.ie) services depart Rosslare Harbour on an hourly basis and offer access to all corners of Ireland. You can also hire a car at the Rosslare ferry terminal.\n\nFishguard Rosslare Ferry - 14 Sailings Weekly / 3 hrs 30 mins"
