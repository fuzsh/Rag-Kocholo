        "text": "Railways in\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\nNote regarding flag image: the Ulster Banner shown here was the official flag of Northern Ireland until 1973, since when it has had no official status. As Northern Ireland has no other recognised flag of its own, it is still used to represent Northern Ireland in various sporting competitions. However, caution should be exercised regarding its use in other contexts, as it is strongly associated with Unionist politics to the exclusion of others.\n\nTrain of the Giantâs Causeway & Bushmills Railway at Giantâs Causeway station\n\nBecause the whole of the island of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom until the early 20th century, the history of railways in Northern Ireland is closely tied up with that of the Republic.\n\nThe first railway in what is now Northern Ireland was the Ulster Railway opened in 1839 between Belfast and Lisburn, a distance of about 7Â½ miles (12 km). It was built to the possibly unique gauge of 6ft 2in (1880mm), and was extended at this gauge over the next few years to Portadown. However, at about this time a new railway was being promoted between the major Irish cities of Belfast and Dublin, which would link up with various existing railways of disparate gauges. A compromise gauge of 5ft 3in (1600mm) was agreed for all new main line construction in the whole of Ireland. The Ulster Railway was converted to this gauge around 1847 and eventually joined up with the Dublin & Belfast Junction Railway in 1852, completing the important through route between the two cities which would later become an international route.\n\nBesides the 1600mm gauge network, a number of narrow gauge railways sprang up in rural areas, typically of 3ft (914mm) gauge. These had largely disappeared by the 1950s owing to road competition, but portions of a few of them survive as tourist railways. The peat extraction industry also once had extensive networks of narrow gauge railways, but these have fallen out of use as the industry has declined.\n\nMain line railways in Northern Ireland today fall under the umbrella of Translink, a state owned authority owning and operating buses and trains within the province, operating international trains jointly with Irish Rail, and maintaining the rail infrastructure.\n\nTranslink the main line network\n\nDownpatrick & County Down Railway Downpatrick to Inch Abbey, about 1Â½ mile (2.5 km), Irish standard gauge (1600mm). Extension proposed from Downpatrick to Ballydugan. Steam and diesel hauled. Not currently operating, no date given for reopening.\n\nGiantâs Causeway & Bushmills Railway 3ft (914mm) gauge railway some 2 miles (3.2km) in length, in the lovely scenery between two famous tourist attractions\n\nCarnfunnock Family Fun Zone 7Â¼in (184mm) gauge miniature railway about 500 yards (450m) in length, located in Carnfunnock Park, Ballygally, near Larne.\n\nDamhead Miniature Railway 7Â¼in (184mm) gauge miniature railway about â  mile (0.5km) in length, located in Coleraine. Steam and diesel hauled.\n\nDelamont Miniature Railway 10Â¼in (260mm) gauge miniature railway over Â½ mile (1km) in length, located in Delamont Country Park, Killyleagh.\n\nDrumwahey Junction Railway 7Â¼in (184mm) gauge line a little over 1 mile (1.6km) in length, near Donaghadee. Steam, diesel, petrol or battery electric hauled.\n\nPeatlands Park at Derryhubbert (near Dungannon) is a country park in a former peat extraction area. Almost 1 mile (1.5km) of the original diesel hauled narrow gauge railway has been restored for passenger use.\n\nPickie Puffer 7Â¼in (184mm) gauge miniature railway in the Pickie Fun Park, Bangor\n\nThe Railway Preservation Society of Ireland operates occasional steam trains on the main lines of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland."
