        "text": "Belfast Live readers are cautiously happy in our comments section, to hear that the final All-Island Rail Review has unveiled 32 recommendations aimed at reviving rail services in neglected areas. Transport Minister Eamon Ryan hailed it as \"the most ambitious vision for rail in a century\" before its release alongside NI's Infrastructure Minister John O'Dowd.\n\nThe comprehensive plan is set to bring rail access to an additional 700,000 people, meaning a quarter more will live within 5km of a station, and will ensure that 90% of air travellers can reach the airport by rail.\n\nKey proposals include linking Dublin, Belfast International, and Shannon airports directly to the rail network, and introducing a new line from Lisburn to Newry with stops at Banbridge and Hillsborough, potentially cutting travel times between the north and south.\n\nRead more: All Island Rail Review plan to add new stations in 3 NI counties & airports\n\nRead more: Belfast-Dublin hourly trains expected start date announced\n\nThe strategy also features a proposed rail connection from Derry to Letterkenny, although plans have dismissed the idea of restoring rail service to Enniskillen, leaving Co Fermanagh as the sole county on the island without a railway. Meanwhile, hourly Dublin-Belfast services are anticipated to commence by autumn with the opening of the new Belfast Grand Central train station, and procurement is already underway for a greener Enterprise fleet.\n\nCommenter Pastorofmuppets says: “The plan to add new stations in Tyrone, Armagh, and Down, along with better connections to airports like Belfast International, is a brilliant idea. Northern Ireland's infrastructure, especially from international airports, is far behind the rest of the UK and Ireland. However, I can never recall a time when anyone said, 'I wish there was a train to Shannon Airport.' Have you ever been there? It’s in the back end of beyond, even further than the International to Belfast.”\n\nSparky61 thinks: “Sounds great, I’ll not see it but should be good for the island of Ireland and getting a train service to the international airports.”\n\nHunslet agrees: “Great news, about time! Railways should be going into Fermanagh as well, but still great to hear.” OurJimmy adds: “Get to work on this right now. This series of recommendations is not new but welcome.”\n\nJohnmce suggests: “An immediate action would be a station close to the Belfast City Airport with an elevated walkway over the Sydenham bypass directly into the airport. The current airport at Sydenham is no use for the airport as it is too far to walk, especially with luggage.”\n\nWee Annie thinks: “It’s great to see that connectivity across the island and also to airports is being invested in. Altho it would be nice if Enniskillen had been included in the review. As there’s a lot of beautiful areas there and across the island for day trips and picnics. A lot of families miss out on these beauty spots because they don’t have transport and the public transport is very much lacking.”\n\nSupportOurNHS agrees: “I don't get why Enniskillen, and Fermanagh as a whole, get very little support in general. No trains, poor bus service, potholes everywhere and little to nothing in the way of tourism advertising. A great attraction like Marble Arch Caves should be widely advertised and have a bus to it from Belfast like the Giants Causeway does.”\n\nCatchyerselfon asks: “Whilst any improvement to the existing rail network is to be welcome, especially for those in rural communities, has anyone said how NI will fund its 25%? That works out at £290m per year for the next 26 years. That's assuming the project is delivered within budget.”\n\nItiswhatitisaye replies: “It’s almost impossible to calculate the inflation and possible interest rates and wages for the next 26 years. Then if there's ever another pandemic prices of materials will soar again. Casement has soared in a few years as it is, dear only knows what this will soar to in 26 years.”\n\nOver on Facebook Chantelle White thinks: “The fact Belfast International doesn’t have a train connection is shocking!” Bri Collins agrees: “This is great news. If ever there was a part of the U.K. underserved by rail it’s NI.”\n\nCatherine Molloy replies: “Need to open more train lines in the north. Belfast to Newcastle and I'm sure there are loads of others.”\n\nMandy Scott adds: “About time, but 26 years????? Are they knitting the trains/tracks or what??” Carole Farnan agrees: “Just 26 years to move Ireland into the 20th century?!”\n\nRobert Pauley writes: “Won't happen quickly. Each new line will be fought tooth and nail by landowners and householders on the route. There will be concerned residents groups who will use every legal means to delay construction. This has already happened to the A5 dualling proposal. Planning and environmental concerns will take forever. Our existing rail network was built in different times when companies just took the land, won't happen now.”\n\nSteven McNeill agrees: “Most of this will never materialise.This week the UK government announced it is cutting funding to reopen railway links in England so there's no chance they'll provide the necessary funding to many of these NI projects.”"
