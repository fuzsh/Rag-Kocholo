        "text": "It is 75 years since the start of the express rail link between Belfast and Dublin known as the Enterprise service.\n\nIt began in August 1947 to try to compete with the improving road network and the prospect of an air link between the two cities.\n\nThere have been many changes to the inter-city train link in the past 75 years.\n\nThe service survived frequent disruption in the 1970s and 1980s after violence erupted in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe current journey time on the 110-mile (177km) route is just over two hours, not much faster than when the non-stop Enterprise began in 1947.\n\nHowever, there are now more stops.\n\n'Ambitious plans'\n\nThe service is jointly run by Translink NI Railways in Northern Ireland and Iarnród Éireann (Irish Rail) in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nTranslink chief executive Chris Conway said: \"Enterprise has been there to connect us to family, friends and opportunity, evolving with the times and better connecting Belfast and Dublin.\"\n\nHe said there were \"ambitious plans\" to develop the service in the next decade.\n\nThe first Enterprise was a seven-carriage steam train which left Belfast at 10:30am on 11 August 1947.\n\nA return train left Dublin at 5:30pm.\n\nThe trains had customs checks at either end, rather than stopping at points on either side of the border, which quickened the journey.\n\nThere was a dining car and a first-class carriage.\n\nIn 1947 there was only one daily return service - now there are eight on weekdays.\n\nA display of photographs from the past 75 years is going on display in Belfast at the Lanyon Place station and in Dublin's Connolly station.\n\nIarnród Éireann chief executive Jim Meade, said: \"The Enterprise train is a key economic and social connector for the people of Dublin, Belfast and the stations in between and we look forward to another 75 years of its successful operation.\"\n\nFrom campaigns to Covid\n\nThe most testing period for the service was during the years of violence in Northern Ireland when security alerts were common and the IRA attacked the cross-border rail line.\n\nAt the same time the rail link between Belfast and Dublin was used as part of efforts to end the violence by campaigners who organised Dublin-to-Belfast \"Peace Trains\".\n\nIn the early 1970s the rail link was used by campaigners who wanted the legalisation of contraception in the Republic.\n\nRepresentatives from the Irish Women's Liberation Movement travelled north to try to buy contraceptives in Belfast.\n\nOver the years the train fleet has been upgraded as have the services on board, including the introduction of wifi and charging points.\n\nIn August 2009 a 20-metre (66ft) section of the track in north Dublin gave way at the Broadmeadow estuary viaduct."
