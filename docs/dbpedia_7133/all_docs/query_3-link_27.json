        "text": "Belfast Grand Central Station, Northern Ireland’s flagship infrastructure project, continues to progress at pace and is set to open to the public this autumn. The internal fit out is well underway, alongside work to the bus stands, rail platforms, track and signalling infrastructure.\n\nActivity is intensifying with the commencement of major public realm work around the station with road enhancements to maintain pedestrian safety, and enhance routes for walking, accessibility and cycling. In addition, there will be a programme of roadworks to facilitate necessary utilities for the modern world-class facility. These works will disrupt the road network around the new station.\n\nDuring this period of significant transition during the construction of Belfast Grand Central Station, public transport and road users are advised to plan their journeys in advance to incorporate guidance around the ongoing engineering works. Some delays should be expected, and road users are being encouraged to switch to alternative modes of travel or choose different routes where possible.\n\nThe work involved in this stage of the project will require road and lane closures, impacting traffic within the city centre and alterations to some bus and rail services. Where there is disruption to rail passengers, bus substitution services will be operational. Station construction is due to be completed and open to the public in Autumn 2024.\n\nThe latest information on Belfast Grand Central Station can be found on the Translink website.\n\nUse Translink's Journey Planner or Traffic Watch NI for information specific to your intended route.\n\n----\n\nTrain lines\n\nGreat Victoria Street Station Closure\n\nGreat Victoria Street Train Station has now closed permanently. A revised train timetable is in place until the Autumn and passengers are urged to plan ahead, using the Translink website www.translink.com and allow extra time for their journey as most passengers will see a change to their normal timetables.\n\nThe rail line will remain open throughout Belfast but no longer serving Great Victoria Street Station. Passengers will still be able to access the city from York Street, Lanyon Place, Botanic or City Hospital Stations and walk or cycle to their destination. Passengers can use valid rail tickets on scheduled Metro and Glider services to interchange between these stations. A bus substitution service will also be in place between Lanyon Place and Great Victoria Street Stations or passengers can use scheduled Metro services.\n\nJuly/August 2024\n\nThere are plans for the rail line to close between Belfast Lanyon Place and Lisburn from Wednesday 3rd July until early Autumn. Botanic, City Hospital and Lisburn line train stations are closed. Passengers that normally use these stations should use Metro and Ulsterbus scheduled bus services. More details can be found here.\n\nValid rail tickets can be used on Metro/Glider Services to interchange between these stations.\n\nAll other rail lines will remain open from Belfast Lanyon Place / York Street Station to Derry~Londonderry, Larne and Bangor and the southern corridor will operate from Lisburn southwards to Portadown and Newry. Cross Border Services will operate from Portadown with coach transfers from Belfast to Newry to connect with the Enterprise Train.\n\nThe Europa Buscentre will remain open as normal until Belfast Grand Central Station is operational.\n\nEnhanced Bus Services\n\nNew Timetables New Ulsterbus / Goldliner and Metro timetables will be live from Monday 1st July until early Autumn 2024. These enhanced passenger services over the summer months will include additional capacity and frequency on popular routes. Check here for more info on Metro timetable and departure changes and Ulsterbus timetable and departure changes.\n\nPassengers can also get information at their local train station, online or call the contact centre 028 90 666630.\n\nNew Bus Lanes (June / July 2024)\n\n- There will be 12-hour outbound bus lanes on Howard Street, Great Victoria Street, Bruce Street and Dublin Road.\n\n- Subject to final feasibility designs, there will be an extension of the inbound bus lane on Lisburn Road (operating 7.30am to 9.30am Monday - Friday).\n\n- There will be the introduction of a 12-hour bus lane on North Street, an extended bus stop with new passenger waiting facilities and the displacement of on-street parking.\n\n- Additional bus stops on Donegall Place, Linenhall Street and Bedford Street.\n\nPark and Ride Services\n\nTranslink is encouraging people to consider using the sixty conveniently located Park and Ride sites across Northern Ireland, with approx. 10k spaces offering convenience and flexibility with no parking hassles. In addition, dedicated high frequency services operate from major park and ride sites including Sprucefield, Cairnshill, Black’s Road and Ballymartin.\n\n----\n\nRefer to Grand Central Station FAQs for answers to the most common questions about the project.\n\nTranslink will also be regularly updating their Information on Line Improvements.\n\nPassengers are encouraged to plan their journeys using the Journey Planner on Translink's website, follow Translink on social media and leave extra time for their journeys."
