        "text": "Proposal to Immediately Expand the HCMC-Long Thanh Expressway to 10 Lanes Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha said the decision to invest in expanding the HCMC-Long Thanh Expressway should be based on the progress and economic efficiency, so that the next steps can be implemented ‚Äì Photo: VGP/MK On the morning of May 3, Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha chaired a meeting to listen to a report and give opinions on the investment plan to expand the HCMC-Long Thanh section of the HCMC-Long Thanh-Dau Giay expressway project. The report of the State Capital Management Committee at the Enterprise said that the HCMC-Long Thanh-Dau Giay Expressway in phase 1 came into operation on June 30, 2016 with a total length of 55 km, of which the HCMC-Long Thanh section was 25.92 km. Since its opening, the traffic volume on the HCMC-Long Thanh expressway (from Km 00 to Km 25+920) has continuously increased, and is expected to exceed 25% of the current four-lane capacity in 2025, resulting in frequent congestion. The expansion of the HCMC-Long Thanh expressway is also aimed at meeting the transportation needs after some key transportation projects are put into operation, such as: Phase 1 of Long Thanh International Airport with a capacity of 26 million passengers/year, Bien Hoa-Vung Tau Expressway, and the development of the Cai Mep-Thi Vai seaport area. Mr. Nguyen Ngoc Canh, Vice Chairman of the State Capital Management Committee at Enterprises said the Vietnam Expressway Corporation (VEC) has studied and proposed to expand the section from the intersection of Ho Chi Minh City Ring Road 2 to the Bien Hoa-Vung Tau Expressway junction (Km4 to Km25+920) with a scale of 8 lanes, ensuring the possibility of expanding to 10 lanes. At the meeting, leaders of the Ministry of Planning and Investment, Ho Chi Minh City, and Dong Nai province said they should consider the investment plan to expand the HCMC-Long Thanh expressway immediately to 10 lanes instead of 8 lanes as proposed. From the investment plans presented at the meeting, the comments analyzed the consistency with the investment law regulations; investment form; scope, scale of the investment project; authority to approve investment policy, investment project decision; capacity to balance, mobilize capital sources/debt repayment obligations; relationship between the existing project (invested in the form of public investment) and the new investment project, etc. Deputy Prime Minister Tran Hong Ha emphasized that expanding the HCMC-Long Thanh section is an urgent issue, ensuring consistency with the infrastructure planning and meeting the requirements of socio-economic development. The decision of the investment plan is based on the progress and economic efficiency, so that the next steps can be implemented. About the plan to assign VEC as the investor, the Deputy Prime Minister directed the State Capital Management Committee at the Enterprises, the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Fina...\n\n‚ÄúAfter repeated delays, Indonesia‚Äôs high-speed rail service is set to begin commercial operations as early as October, the first of its kind in Southeast Asia. The Indonesian-Chinese consortium Kereta Cepat Indonesia China (KCIC) set October as the new opening date after pushing back the previous timeline of August. KCIC will use the extra time to conduct further test runs to ensure safety. The new launch date comes at a crucial time on the country‚Äôs political calendar. With the campaign season for next year‚Äôs presidential elections just three months away, Widodo seeks to leave behind a legacy achievement that his party can promote. The high-speed rail is an approximately 140-kilometer connection that ties Jakarta to West Java provincial capital Bandung. The service will have a top operating speed of roughly 350 kilometers per hour, and the entire line can be traversed in as little as 36 minutes. Indonesia was originally planning to adopt Japan‚Äôs shinkansen bullet train technology.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut in 2015, Widodo‚Äôs government at the last minute switched to the proposal put forward by China. The high-speed rail project is one of the most high-profile components of Chinese President Xi Jinping‚Äôs Belt and Road cross-border infrastructure initiative. The project proceeded with China‚Äôs support, and Chinese state-owned enterprises essentially led construction. The original plan was to open the Jakarta-Bandung line by 2018 after breaking ground in 2016. The project‚Äôs total cost far exceeded the initial $5.5 billion estimate, and Indonesia ended up having to spend money from state coffers. The original 2018 deadline was set ahead of the presidential election in 2019. Widodo apparently wanted to tout the high-speed rail a signature achievement on the campaign trail. Even now, some say the opening of the Jakarta-Bandung line should be pushed back to conduct more test runs. But Widodo‚Äôs government wants to avoid additional delays.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe next presidential race will take place in February, and the campaign takes off after the November filing deadline for candidates. Although Widodo must step down due to term limits, he wants to leave behind a concrete legacy for a successor to campaign on. The Transportation Ministry and multiple consulting firms said in an internal document that the launch of the service should be pushed back to January next year, according to a Reuters report. Elsewhere in Southeast Asia, Vietnam is looking to build a high-speed rail line that connects Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. A similar project linking Singapore and Kuala Lumpur had been considered before falling through. There is a project in the works in Thailand, but huge costs have prevented progress. India is building a 508-km line connecting Mumbai and Ahmedabad using Japanese bullet train technology. Although construction started in 2017, the project has been delayed in part to eminent domain issues similar to what Indonesia had faced.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúMalaysia is reviving a plan to build the country‚Äôs first high-speed railway connecting its capital of Kuala Lumpur to neighboring Singapore after the two governments failed to reach an agreement on an earlier version of the project. The first seven proposals submitted recently by the private sector include bids from consortiums led by state-owned China Railway Construction; South Korea‚Äôs Hyundai Rotem, a Hyundai Motor unit focused on railways and defense; and local conglomerates such as MMC, Gamuda, YTL, WCT Holdings and Berjaya, according to people familiar with the matter. The Malaysian government is expected to The expression-of-interest phase of the bidding follows Malaysia‚Äôs call in July last year for the private sector to submit proposals to develop and operate the project through a public-private partnership model. In August, Singapore said it was willing to discuss any new proposal from Malaysia ‚Äòstarting from a clean state,‚Äô then-Acting Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat told parliament.‚Äù ‚ÄúSultan Ibrahim of Johor, who became Malaysia‚Äôs new King in January, said he wants to revive the project. ‚ÄòI will make it [come back] on,‚Äô he told Singapore‚Äôs Straits Times in an interview published in December. But Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has said the government will not fund the project, and is instead seeking privately backed proposals. During the initial review of the private-sector proposals, the Chinese consortium consisting of China Railway Construction, China Communications Construction and the Export-Import Bank of China, was seen as a strong candidate for the shortlist, given its financing scheme. The high-speed railway project with Singapore was first floated in 2013 during former Prime Minister Najib Razak‚Äôs administration. The 350-kilometer link, which was agreed in 2016 and due to open in 2026, would have cut travel time between the two cities to about 90 minutes, versus more than four hours by car.‚Äù ‚ÄúAt the time, the project was estimated to cost around $17 billion, and companies from China, Japan, South Korea and Europe had expressed interest in contracts to build, operate and finance the trains and rail assets. But the project was hit by multiple delays due to escalating costs and changes in plans. The project was eventually scrapped in 2021, after Malaysia and Singapore failed to reach an agreement. The latest iteration of the project comes against a backdrop of new high speed rail lines in Southeast Asia. In October, Indonesia officially opened the region‚Äôs first high-speed railway, connecting 140 km between Jakarta and Bandung in less than an hour. The $7 billion line was built by a consortium of Indonesian and Chinese state-owned companies. But analysts say significant hurdles will need to be overcome if Malaysia is to complete the project. At an estimated cost of up to 120 billion ringgit ($25 billion), funding is another obstacle for the government.‚Äù\n\nHSR's cannot be commercial successes. Outside of Japan there are not many cases of commercial viability - because the setup costs are high and there is declining utility once the main nodes are linked. In short, if the revenue does not cover the costs, it does not mean that it is unviable; but the utility must cover the costs. Now if the revenue does not cover the costs, BUT the utility does - then the govt should make up for the shortfall, and fund the shortfall with taxes, duties etc from the positive economic spinoffs. Again tax too little, run a deficit - tax too much, kill the golden goose. So we are looking for a bunch of Goldilocks zones. \"Johor ruler Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar, who will assume his duties as Malaysia‚Äôs king in January, said in an interview with Singapore‚Äôs The Straits Times earlier this month that reviving the HSR would be a priority of his five-year term. The ruler reportedly said the project remained viable if financed privately and should be realigned to run through the troubled Forest City mega-project, in which he is a key investor, and that the cost would not have ballooned so much if the government had not been ‚Äúon-off-on-off‚Äù in its decision on the HSR.\" Okay, the HSR should run the straightest possible direct line between nodes, Going to Forest City is probably really dumb. \"Malaysia‚Äôs decision to cancel the estimated US$17 billion project has left it lagging behind some of its regional peers in rail connectivity and speed.\" Well, that is maybe not a bad thing. No need to FOMO. I mean the BKK to Kunming rail line is going to be a white elephant. HSR lines do not move large cargo, and it is an expensive way to move mail - so unless there is a lot of demand to go to BKK from Kunming and/or vice versa.... Anyway, Malaysia is already committed to one white elephant. \"Rosli, however, warned that the ongoing East Coast Rail Line (ECRL) project being built along the peninsula‚Äôs east coast under the Belt and Road Initiative was an ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù lesson that the government should consider before going ahead with its HSR plans.\" \"Passenger movement, however, is likely to only pick up during festive seasons when people working in Kuala Lumpur head back to their hometowns for the holidays, while freight will suffer from the lack of economic activity in the east coast, according to Rosli. ‚ÄúVery likely the train will be running half empty on many normal weekdays,‚Äù he said.\" Not a very good track record for the HSR to follow, or for how decisions on strategic megaprojects are made. Singapore? We are not too keen, after all the last leg of the rail to SG is pretty small and we are satisfied with the connectivity currently by air. Land? It is a problem that the Malaysian side seem to be having in keeping lanes open and manned. Maybe just hire more people for USD1billion, and the road links will be cleared faster.\n\nDuring the throes and challenges of railway project delivery, it's easy to forget to study the benefits of railway projects once they're completed, we've left and the operator has taken over. In the case of the Elizabeth line (Crossrail), we have seen the fantastic impact of this infrastructure on London and UK PLC. In particular, we'd like to highlight the below: 1) Passenger numbers are already above what was expected by 2030 2) 60 per cent of employment growth in greater London within 1km of an Elizabeth line station 3) Latest economic impacts calculate that the scheme will add ¬£42bn to our economy (the total final cost of the Elizabeth line across all parties is ¬£18.6bn) 4) The line has directly impacted the construction of 55,000 new homes The case is clear for any future government: it's not about which rail schemes to invest in, but maximising the benefit of all schemes to ensure that all parts of the UK benefit from the full opportunities that are driven by rail investment."
