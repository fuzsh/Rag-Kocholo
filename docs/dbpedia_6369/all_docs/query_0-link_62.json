Richter\n\nAcademic Advising\n\nBallantine Hall 502, (812) 855-2608\n\nReturn to Top\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures (SLAV) offers courses designed to meet a wide range of needs and interests in Russian, Polish, Czech, Serbian and Croatian, and Romanian.\n\nAdvanced language courses are designed not only for the department's majors, but also for students specializing in other disciplines, particularly in the social sciences, natural sciences, and other languages and literatures. The department offers literature and culture courses that require no knowledge of a Slavic or East European language and that can be taken by any student interested in the Russian, Slavic, and East European area.\n\nThere is an intensive program during the summer that allows coverage of a full year of Russian and other Slavic and East European languages in eight weeks. By attending two such summer sessions in conjunction with a regular course of study, students can cover four years of Russian in two, or two years of another Slavic or East European language in one. Admission to the Summer Workshop in Slavic and East European Languages is required for summer language study.\n\nTo ensure proper placement in language courses at all levels, transfer students and those who return to Russian after a lapse of time are required to take a placement examination administered by the department prior to enrolling in a Russian language course.\n\nMajors and prospective majors are urged to consult early with departmental academic advisors concerning the desirability of double majors and the scheduling of strong minors.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nCertificate in Russian Language\n\nA special Russian language certificate program is also available for highly motivated students who have already completed the equivalent of at least three years of college Russian. The program is part of the summer workshop. It extends over four summers and is highly intensive.\n\nA certificate of high competence in the Russian language is granted to those who successfully complete the advanced level. Admission is competitive and requires a written and oral language examination. Participants must reside in the language house, where they speak Russian only. For course details, see R447, R448, and R449, listed below. Credit received for these courses, as well as for the St. Petersburg program (see \"Overseas Study\" below), may be substituted for language course requirements listed under the three major programs below. The two upper-level courses carry language study two years beyond fourth-year Russian. For conversion of credit, consult the academic advisors.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nDepartmental Honors Program\n\nStudents planning to undertake graduate work in Slavic languages and literatures are especially encouraged to take the departmental honors course S499 (the topic of which changes from year to year). Additional course work in the honors program should be arranged with the departmental advisor, including honors sections of departmental courses and graduate sections of departmental graduate/undergraduate joint offerings. Outstanding students will also sometimes be invited to enroll in S497 Internship in Slavic.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nOverseas Study\n\nThe university co-sponsors the Russian programs administered by the Council on International Educational Exchange (CIEE) in St. Petersburg during the academic year and the second summer session. In addition, the department sponsors its own overseas study program in St. Petersburg.\n\nSuccessful participation in these programs can earn students up to 15 hours of Indiana University credit. For information on these and other overseas study opportunities in Russia and Eastern Europe, contact the Office of Overseas Study, Franklin Hall 303, (812) 855-9304.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nSummer Workshop in Slavic and East European Languages\n\nThe department's summer workshop offers students an opportunity to accelerate their learning of Russian by covering the equivalent of a year of college Russian in eight weeks of intensive study and practice. Two summers of study in the workshop combined with two years of regular Russian language courses are equal to four years of non-intensive Russian language courses. In addition, the workshop regularly offers intensive courses in other Slavic, East European, Caucasian, and Central Asian languages.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nRussian Language House\n\nIn cooperation with the Halls of Residence, when enrollments allow, the department maintains a housing unit for students who have a common interest in Russian language and culture. There is a weekly \"Russian tea\" as well as films, lectures, and other special events. For further information, contact the departmental office.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nSecondary Teacher Certification\n\nCandidates for teaching certification should see \"Additional Programs, Education\" in this bulletin and consult the departmental academic advisors.\n\nReturn to Top\n\nMajor in Slavic Languages and Literatures\n\nThe Russian Track\n\nPurpose\n\nThis track is designed for students seeking advanced study of the Russian language and/or Russian literature in the original (option 1), or basic Russian-language knowledge and familiarization with Russian literature and culture in translation (option 2).

In addition, students either do work in another Slavic literature or culture in English translation (including Russian), or study another Slavic language (including Russian). Students must also complete the degree requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences.
