Max soon finds, though, that ruling his kingdom is not so easy and his relationships there prove to be more complicated than he originally thought.\n\nAbout the filmmaker:\n\nSpike Jonze is an Academy Award-winning director and producer known for his visually arresting and innovative music videos and films.
