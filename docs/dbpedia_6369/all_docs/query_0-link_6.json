Suffering a headache, he goes into the pharmacy for aspirin and there meets Manesquier, a cultured bachelor who lives in a large house on his own. As the only hotel has closed, Manesquier offers to put the stranger up for the night. While he is delighted to talk about his life and interests, the taciturn Milan does not say who he is or why he is there. The reason, it is revealed, is because he will link up with three other criminals and rob the town bank.\n\nOver the next few days the two very different men start bonding, with Milan introduced to music and poetry and the aesthete Manesquier learning to be tough with women and other men. On the Saturday each is to meet his fate: Manesquier will undergo triple bypass surgery while Milan will join his fellow-criminals in holding up the bank. The robbery is a failure, as the police have been tipped off and Milan is shot down. The operation is also a failure; as Manesquier dies on the table.\n\nIn a brief surrealistic coda, each dead man returns to life and their improbable friendship resumes.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nJohnny Hallyday as Milan, a thief\n\nJean Rochefort as Manesquier, a retired teacher\n\nJean-François Stévenin as Luigi, a thief\n\nCharlie Nelson as Max\n\nPascal Parmentier as Sadko\n\nIsabelle Petit-Jacques as Viviane, Manesquier's mistress\n\nÉdith Scob as Manesquier's sister\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film was shot in Annonay (Ardèche), at the Gare de Tain-l'Hermitage - Tournon in Tain-l'Hermitage (Drôme) and at the Musée des Beaux-Arts and Fourvière in Lyon.[2]\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nParamount Classics acquired the United States distribution rights of this film and gave it a limited US theatrical release on May 9, 2003 to a total of 85 theaters; this film went on to gross $2,542,020 in United States theaters,[1] which is a solid result for a non-English language film.[3] Paramount Classics was ecstatic with this film's performance in the United States market.[4]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 92% of 116 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.5/10.
