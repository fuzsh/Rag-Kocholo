        "text": "Vue is dedicated to giving each and every one of our guests an exceptional big screen experience.\n\nBelow, you'll find cinema specific links for accessibility information, including details on cinema specific accessible and autism-friendly screenings.\n\nAutism Friendly screenings\n\nWe host autism friendly screenings on the last Sunday of every month at all sites except West End. These autism friendly film screenings are sensory friendly with the sound reduced, lighting dimmed and no adverts or trailers. It is okay for guests to move around and make noise in autism friendly cinema.\n\nCEA carer cards\n\nVue are delighted to be part of the national CEA card scheme, which is accepted at all of our UK venues. The CEA card will allow you to book tickets online, in person at the venue or by calling the booking line to get your carer a ticket for free. For further information regarding the CEA card scheme, please visit the CEA website.\n\nOpen Captioned Screenings\n\nWe schedule Open Captioned cinema screenings for people who are hard of hearing. In most cases, foreign films not in English will also have subtitles. Open Captioned sessions will be marked as Open Captioned or OC.\n\nAudio Description\n\nWe offer Audio Description (AD) on a select number of films each week. The normal film soundtrack is broadcast to speakers in the usual way, while a recorded narrator explains what's happening on screen through personal headphones. Audio described showings will be marked as AD.\n\nWe welcome assistance dogs into all our venues. If you'd like any more information, give our customer services team a call on 0345 308 4620*. You can also ask a member of our staff during your visit.\n\nSelect your Vue to see the specific accessibility information:"
