        "text": "Company Executing on \"iRobot Elevate\" Strategy to Focus on Branding, Innovation and Operating Performance\n\nDelivers on Plan to Lower Cost Structure and Refresh Product Line\n\nIntroduces Q3 2024 Outlook and Revises Fiscal Year 2024 Expectations\n\nBEDFORD, Mass., Aug. 6, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- iRobot Corp. (NASDAQ: IRBT), a leader in consumer robots, today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 29, 2024.\n\n\"We are executing iRobot Elevate, a strategy focused on five pillars of financial performance, customer-centricity, bringing innovative products to market in an entirely new and more profitable way, continuing our operational and organization improvements, and developing and retaining our best talent,\" said Gary Cohen, iRobot CEO. \"We are elevating everything we do at iRobot to improve our performance and generate long-term shareholder value.\n\n\"In the second quarter, we made significant progress, specifically in lowering the Company's cost structure through aggressive restructuring efforts. As part of our iRobot Elevate strategy, we strengthened our balance sheet, narrowed our operating loss, decreased headcount, and substantially reduced inventory. Without a non-recurring charge related to the write-off of excess component inventory and the losses on non-cancelable purchase commitments as part of the transition to our new product development paradigm with our contract manufacturers, we would have met our Q2 improvement targets for gross margin, operating loss, and net loss per share.\n\n\"On the top line, second-quarter revenue came in at the low end of our outlook and was affected by a more challenging consumer spending environment, heightened competition in our market segment and greater-than-expected foreign currency impact. The impact of these headwinds is reflected in our updated revenue outlook for the full year.\n\n\"In July, we announced our most advanced product, the Roomba Combo 10 Max robot + AutoWash Dock. It represents an important milestone in our product innovation roadmap. Our talented team is focused on bringing innovative products to market to refresh our entire product line and enable iRobot to be significantly more competitive. In 2025, we plan to launch significant technological enhancements and new products across the price points we serve.\n\n\"Looking ahead, I am confident we can capitalize on our iconic brand with a renewed consumer-centric emphasis and a sharply focused innovation and product roadmap to advance our growth initiatives and deliver long-term shareholder value.\"\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financial Results (in millions, except per share amounts and percentages)\n\nBalance Sheet and Operational Highlights\n\nAs of June 29, 2024, the Company's cash and cash equivalents totaled $108.5 million, compared with $118.4 million as of first quarter 2024. The Company also had an additional $40.5 million restricted cash set aside for future repayment of its term loan, subject to limited rights for the purchase of inventory in the third quarters of fiscal 2024 and 2025.\n\nAs of June 29, 2024, the Company's inventory totaled $101.4 million, representing a 41% reduction from the second quarter of 2023.\n\nDuring the second quarter, the Company sold 1.1 million shares under its at-the-market (ATM) offering program for total net proceeds of $12.3 million. At quarter end, the Company had $81.1 million remaining under its $100 million ATM offering program.\n\nAs of June 29, 2024, iRobot has reduced its total headcount by 35% since year-end 2023.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, revenue declined 35.6% in the U.S., 34.7% in Japan and 21.6% in EMEA over the prior-year period. Excluding the unfavorable foreign currency impact, Japan revenue decreased 28% over the prior-year period.\n\nRevenue from mid-tier robots (with an MSRP between $300 and $499) and premium robots (with an MSRP of $500 or more) represented 76% of total robot sales in the second quarter of 2024 versus 84% from the same period last year, reflecting the introduction of the Roomba Combo Essential, which provides the iRobot 2-in-1 cleaning experience at a lower price point.\n\nMarketing Highlights\n\nThe recently introduced Roomba Essential successfully reached full distribution coverage, launching in 14,000 stores across all three regions. In Japan, Roomba Essential was number one in units sold in May and June in the robot vacuum cleaner market, according to GfK.\n\niRobot introduced its most advanced robot vacuum and mop, the Roomba Combo 10 Max Robot + AutoWash Dock. The newly designed 2-in-1 Roomba Combo 10 Max brings independent cleaning to a new level with iRobot's first multifunction AutoWash Dock and added intelligence.\n\nThe Roomba Combo 10 Max received favorable launch coverage in the US and EMEA, including in The Verge, Mashable, Reviewed, PCMag, ZDNet, Frandroid, El Espanol and T3.\n\nFor the 10th consecutive year, Roomba was a featured product in Amazon's Prime Day event, which was held on July 16-17. The Company's products received Prime Day related media coverage in outlets including CNET, CNN Underscored, Engadget, Real Simple, USA Today and Forbes Vetted.\n\nThe Roomba j9 series and Roomba Essential series continued to receive favorable media coverage, reviews and awards, including in GQ, Men's Health, Reviewed and Insider.\n\nThird Quarter and Full Year 2024 Outlook\n\niRobot is providing GAAP and non-GAAP financial expectations for the third quarter ending September 28, 2024. Due to the aforementioned Manufacturing Transition Charge, persistent foreign currency headwinds, and consumer market softness, the Company also is updating the full-year 2024 outlook it provided on May 7, 2024. A detailed reconciliation between the Company's GAAP and non-GAAP expectations is included in the financial tables that appear at the end of this press release.\n\nThird Quarter 2024:\n\nFiscal Year 2024:\n\nAs previously noted, the Company expects to generate modest positive cash flow from operations during the second half of the year.\n\nSecond-Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call\n\nOn August 7, the Company will host a live conference call and webcast to review its financial results and discuss its outlook. The conference call details are as follows:\n\nDate: Wednesday, August 7, 2024\n\nTime: 8:30 a.m. ET\n\nCall-In Number: 800-343-5172 (Alternate: 203-518-9856)\n\nConference ID: IRBTQ224\n\nA live webcast of the conference call will be accessible on the event section of the Company's website at https://investor.irobot.com/financial-information/quarterly-results. An archived version of the broadcast will be available on the same website shortly after the conclusion of the live event.\n\nAbout iRobot Corp.\n\niRobot is a global consumer robot company that designs and builds thoughtful robots and intelligent home innovations that make life better. iRobot introduced the first Roomba robot vacuum in 2002.

These forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations, estimates and projections about its business and industry, all of which are subject to change. In this context, forward-looking statements often address expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"could,\" \"seek,\" \"see,\" \"will,\" \"may,\" \"would,\" \"might,\" \"potentially,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue,\" \"expect,\" \"target,\" similar expressions or the negatives of these words or other comparable terminology that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes. All forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and are not guarantees of future results, such as statements about the consummation of the proposed transaction and the anticipated benefits thereof. These and other forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any such statements and caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (i) the Company's ability to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all; (ii) the Company's ability to realize the benefits of its operational restructuring; (iii) the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and various global conflicts on the Company's business and general economic conditions; (iv) the Company's ability to implement its business strategy; (v) the risk that disruptions from the operational restructuring will harm the Company's business, including current plans and operations; (vi) the ability of the Company to retain and hire key personnel, including successfully navigating its leadership transition; (vii) legislative, regulatory and economic developments affecting the Company's business; (viii) general economic and market developments and conditions; (ix) the evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes under which the Company operates; (x) potential business uncertainty, including changes to existing business relationships that could affect the Company's financial performance; (xi) unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities; (xii) current supply chain challenges including the Red Sea conflict; (xiii) the financial strength of our customers and retailers; (xiv) the impact of tariffs on goods imported into the United States; and (xv) competition, as well as the Company's response to any of the aforementioned factors. Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements are included under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in the Company's most recent annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC and any subsequent reports on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q or Form 8-K filed from time to time and available at www.sec.gov. While the list of factors presented here is considered representative, no such list should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. Consequences of material differences in results as compared with those anticipated in the forward-looking statements could include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. The forward-looking statements included herein are made only as of the date hereof. The Company does not assume any obligation to publicly provide revisions or updates to any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws.\n\niRobot Corporation\n\nExplanation of Non-GAAP Measures\n\nIn addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, this earnings release contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures described below. We use non-GAAP measures to internally evaluate and analyze financial results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and enable comparison of our financial results with other public companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nOur non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.\n\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets: Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets including completed technology, customer relationships, and reacquired distribution rights acquired in connection with business combinations as well as any non-cash impairment charges associated with intangible assets in connection with our past acquisitions. Amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. We exclude these charges from our non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.\n\nNet Merger, Acquisition and Divestiture (Income) Expense: Net merger, acquisition and divestiture (income) expense primarily consists of transaction fees, professional fees, and transition and integration costs directly associated with mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, including with respect to the iRobot-Amazon Merger. It also includes business combination adjustments including adjustments after the measurement period has ended. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the adjustment included the one-time net termination fee received as a result of the termination of the iRobot-Amazon Merger. The occurrence and amount of these costs will vary depending on the timing and size of these transactions. We exclude these charges from our non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.\n\nStock-Based Compensation: Stock-based compensation is a non-cash charge relating to stock-based awards. We exclude this expense as it is a non-cash expense, and we assess our internal operations excluding this expense and believe it facilitates comparisons to the performance of other companies.\n\nRestructuring and Other: Restructuring charges are related to one-time actions associated with realigning resources, enhancing operational productivity and efficiency, or improving our cost structure in support of our strategy. Such actions are not reflective of ongoing operations and include costs primarily associated with severance and related costs, charges related to paused work unrelated to our core business, costs associated with the Chief Executive Officer transition and other non-recurring costs directly associated with resource realignments tied to strategic initiatives or changes in business conditions. We exclude these items from our non-GAAP measures when evaluating our recent and prospective business performance as such items vary significantly based on the magnitude of the action and do not reflect anticipated future operating costs. In addition, these charges do not necessarily provide meaningful insight into the fundamentals of current or past operations of our business.\n\nGain/Loss on Strategic Investments: Gain/loss on strategic investments includes fair value adjustments, realized gains and losses on the sales of these investments and losses on the impairment of these investments. We exclude these items from our non-GAAP measures because we do not believe they correlate to the performance of our core business and may vary in size based on market conditions and events. We believe that the exclusion of these gains or losses provides investors with a supplemental view of our operational performance.\n\nDebt issuance costs: Debt issuance costs include various incremental fees and commissions paid to third parties in connection with the issuance of debt.\n\nIncome tax adjustments: Income tax adjustments include the tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments, calculated using the appropriate statutory tax rate for each adjustment. We regularly assess the need to record valuation allowance based on the non-GAAP profitability and other factors. We also exclude certain tax items, including the impact from stock-based compensation windfalls/shortfalls, which are not reflective of income tax expense incurred as a result of current period earnings. We believe disclosure of the income tax provision before the effect of such tax items is important to permit investors' consistent earnings comparison between periods.\n\nSOURCE iRobot Corporation"
