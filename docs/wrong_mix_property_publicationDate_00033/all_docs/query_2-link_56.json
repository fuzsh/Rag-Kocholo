        "text": "Hello.\n\nIf parts of the docment are being cut off rather than condensed in to the printout, the issue may be related to the program that is being used.\n\nTry using a different program. If you are printing from the web, be sure to use the \"print\" option in or around the article to properly format the page for printing.\n\nIf you continue to have difficulties with this issue, find more help at http://canon.us/SupportCF\n\nDid this answer your question? Please click the Accept as Solution button so that others may find the answer as well.\n\nWell, No matter what program I am trying to print from, this happens. I noticed it as soon as I began using this printer. It seems that the page is \"pushed up\" so the full page never prints. I have experience dealing with printer settings, as well as formatting documents in MS programs as well as Adobe products, including Photoshop.\n\nThis is the printer. It needs a setting to adjust were the printer thinks the margins are. I have never had a printer that didn't allow this. Very annoying.\n\nI'm having this same issue with my brand new MG2900 series. I'm trying to use Microsoft Publisher and I cannot for the life of me, get it to stop cutting off the bottom of the page. Both Publisher and the Printer properties are showing 8.5 x 11. It's even cut off in the Print Preview.\n\nHas anyone found a solution to this yet?\n\nHello.\n\nTroubleshooting with our support group will be needed to narrow down the cause of your issue.
