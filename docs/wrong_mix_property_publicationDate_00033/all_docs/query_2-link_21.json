Paul Hedman, a priest of the Archdiocese of St. Paul & Minneapolis.\n\nIs CanonLaw.Ninja up-to-date?\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, as of March 15, 2022, all of the documents on CanonLaw.Ninja are up to date. CanonLaw.Ninja includes the changes promulgated in Ad tuendam fidem, Omnium in Mentem, Mitis Iudex Dominus Iesus, De Concordia inter Codices, Magnum principium, Communis vita, Pascite gregem Dei, Competentias quasdam decernere, and Pope Francis' update to the Catechism.\n\nI have a suggestion or question!\n\nSend an email to [email protected] and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. If I can do something that would make the site more useful to you, I'd love to help!\n\nCredits\n\nThe Code of Canon Law is provided courtertesy of, and with permission from, the Canon Law Society of Great Britain and Ireland\n\nCatechism paragraphs were scraped from vatican.va.
