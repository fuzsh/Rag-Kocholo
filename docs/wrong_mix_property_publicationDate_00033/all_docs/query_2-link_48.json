The publication history indicates that several which originally appeared in the Gazettes were revised for publication in this volume.\n\nIt is divided into two sections, \"Music\" and \"Murder\". The \"Murder\" section contains Carrico's stories about Byron Chieske and Gotthilf Hoch of the Magdeburg Polizei. The \"Music\" section contains stories about the interaction between the music, instruments, and musical ideas brought back by Grantville and the music and musicians of the early 1630s. It primarily consists of the Franz and Marla stories, but also contains \"The Sound of Sweet Strings\", about the relationship between Giouan Battista Veraldi and Atwood Cochran, and \"Motifs\", which is written as a series of letters from the historical composer Heinrich Sch√ºtz."
