Pack your bags, Andiamo!\n\nCheck out wine tastings & tours in the Sicily wine region!\n\nLegend & Truth: According to legend, Dionysus (ancient Greek god of wine, winemaking, grape cultivation, fertility, ritual madness, theatre, and religious ecstasy.) brought joy and wine to Sicily. But the legend aside, it is a fact that wine has been produced for thousands of years in Sicily. There is evidence that Mycenaean traders were already around 1,500 BC. cultivated grapes in the Aeolian Islands. When the Greeks settled in Sicily in the 8th century, they could not be without \"oinos\", their favourite libation and so they introduced different varieties of grapevines.\n\nRenaissance of Sicilian Viticulture\n\nOver the last 20 years, Sicily's wine culture has seen tremendous changes, as confirmed by many of the international awards won by Sicilian producers - some of Italy's best wines come from Sicily. A new generation of producers is exploiting the full potential of the enviable island climate, local grape varieties, and fertile soil. With now 112,700 hectares of vineyards is the island of Sicily, which also includes the volcanic island of Pantelleria in the southwest and the northeastern Aeolian Islands, the largest wine region in Italy. Sicily wine region has been investing in sustainable production methods for more than 20 years. The island is now in the lead in Italy: 83% of the vineyards processed by Assovini producers are organic.\n\nInterested in customizing your Sicilian wine vacation?

Started with Greeks and Arabs, finished with Normans. That's why It is so difficult to underline the best places to visit there. However here, we tried to take you out of big and mainstream cities. But it doesn't mean that you shouldn't visit Palermo, Catania, Syracuse and many more big or small villages with a long history.\n\nCefalù - A City Layered with Different Cultures\n\nVariation of the city name talks a lot about cultural influences and layers of history sedimented on Sicilian land. in the Sicilian language, it is CIfalù. However, the name has Greek origins and comes from the word Kephaloídion (Κεφαλοίδιον) or Kephaloidís (Κεφαλοιδίς), which later was Latinized. But this is not the end of the story, the name of the city also changed under Arab and Carthaginian rule.\n\nWorthwhile, however, is the 2-hour hike to the castle hill of Cefalù. Also ideal for a trip with children, since the ascent to Diana Temple is quite easy. From there you have a beautiful view of the sea, the old town of Cefalu and the Madoni.\n\nErice - A Medieval Jewel\n\nIn order to reach the mountain town, you have to drive up from Trapani a steep serpentine road. On the way, there is a unique panorama and breathtaking views of the green, southern mountain landscape to the Mediterranean Sea. Another nice possibility to get there is the cable car from Trapani to Erice.\n\nStrolling through the narrow streets of the small town, there are numerous small shops selling souvenirs. Very popular souvenirs from Erice are the famous Sicilian sea salt, good Marsala wines, ceramics, and sweets. Especially the delicious biscuits made from almonds, nougat, pistachios, and ricotta. The most famous pastry shop in the town is the Pasticceria Maria Grammatico, which is praised for its delicious home-made cakes.\n\nThe most visited attractions include the two castles Pepoli and Venus. The first was built by the Arabs, whereas the latter is a Norman structure with impressive towers, which derives its name from the fact that it stands on the site of the ancient temple of Venus, allegedly founded by Aeneas.\n\nSicilian Cuisine - Where Italy meets the Orient\n\nThe long history of relationships with Mediterranean neighbours gave a birth one of the most balanced, colourful and flavoured diets, the Mediterranean diet, which is in the UNESCO intangible heritage list and Sicilian diet is one of the distinctive parts.\n\nIn Italy, every region tends to stand out, but apart from regional pride, Sicilian gastronomy is unanimously considered the highest expression of Italian cuisine. Accompany your dishes with Sicilian wines you will be delighted! In the dishes from Syracuse to Palermo, there are (also) ingredients that we do not quite correspond to the Italian standard. This independence of Sicilian culinary art stems from the varied history of the island. Above all, the flavours of the Orient are the culinary heritage of ongoing campaigns and conquests of Arab peoples. Spices and fruits are found, such as cinnamon and saffron, raisins and pomegranates. Here are some of the outstanding local dishes, which is of course just a little part of Sicilian cuisine:\n\nArancini - Sicilian Rice Balls\n\nSicily is divided into two for the love of this mouth-watering dish. One part calls it Arancini and another Arancine. However, in one way or another, this is an absolute must to taste while you are in Sicily!\n\nThis dish, which is presumed of Arab origin, is deep-fried rice balls filled with various fillings. The name derives from the colour and the shape, which is reminiscent of small oranges. Arancino is the Italian word for \"little orange\". In the east of Sicily, other forms than balls are common.\n\nIn Palermo, the use of saffron is very common to give the rice the fine taste and the golden color, while in the region of Messina and Catania tomato sauce is used. Countless are the ways to fill the arancini. The most common filling consists of ragù, peas, and carrots, mozzarella, ham and bechamel, or mozzarella and spinach. In the area of Catania, there is arancini \"alla norma\" with eggplant and pistachio filling, for which the famous pistachios from Bronte are used. There are even sweet variations, such as those powdered with cocoa and sugar which are often prepared for the Feast of Saint Lucia.\n\nCaponata - Byzantine Heritage\n\nThe marvellous Parmigiana is made all over Italy, but its origins lie in Sicily, where this sweet and sour aubergine dish is prepared called Caponata. Normally it is served as a side dish or appetizer.\n\nEveryone makes the Caponata different. Those who are looking for the unmistakable original recipe and its origin will probably perish. Only their sweet and sour character (which some achieve by adding sugar, others by pickled raisins) and the fact that several vegetables (mostly eggplant and tomato) are fried to an almost creamy spicy mass, they are characterized. Find out your favourite Caponata and combine it best with a nice strong red wine from Sicily.\n\nCannoli - the Sweet Side of Sicily\n\nCannoli are the Sicilian desserts par excellence. It consists of a deep-fried dough roll with a sweet creamy ricotta filling, which may contain vanilla, cocoa, pieces of chocolate or candied fruit.\n\nCannoli was originally one of several lard pastries that were eaten during Carnival but are now produced year-round. They are now available throughout Italy from larger bakeries and restaurants.\n\nThe Italian word cannolo literally means \"small tube\" and does not refer to the dough piece, but to the tube around which the dough pieces are traditionally wrapped for frying.\n\nInsider Tips about Sicily Wine Region\n\nWhere to eat in Sicily wine region?\n\nWhere to stay in Sicily wine region?\n\nThe best wine bars in Sicily wine region\n\nWhat to do in Sicily wine region?\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about Sicily Wine Region"
