        "text": "Dear Gou Gous, another journey of the heart begins in a place that smells like orange blossom, like fuchsia-coloured as the bougainvillaeas that inhabit it and as blue as its crystal-clear waters: Taormina.\n\nThe postcard on the matter was sent to us by Laura Mendolia, a citizen of the hill town famous for its panoramic view from the Teatro Antico of the Ionian coast and Mount Etna in the background.\n\nBorn and raised in a medieval village with an ancient Greek soul, Laura is a young entrepreneur and founder of the high-fashion coffe brand made entirely by hand, Pescepazzo Taormina. What tasty tips does she have in store for a sweet holiday in a place known as the seductive diva?\n\nLet’s discover the places of the heart, à la mode, gourmet, together with our local who will delight us! Let us know which ones will be your favourites!\n\nLocations of the heart to absolutely be seen\n\nISOLA BELLA DI TAORMINA\n\nA real little island nestled in one of the most beautiful and picturesque bays in Taormina.\n\nIt is my favourite place because, even as a child, I used to swim with my grandmother in its crystal-clear waters, surrounded by fish, seahorses and many other colourful sea creatures. It is the place where, even out of season, I go to seek inspiration for Pescepazzo creations.\n\nTip for the sea:\n\nMendolia Beach Club on the beach of Isola Bella. A historic establishment where you can eat overlooking Isola Bella, sunbathe and snorkel in one of the most beautiful backdrops in all of Sicily.\n\nTo try: Chef Paolino’s swordfish rolls.\n\nA few interesting facts about Taormina’s Isola Bella: it is connected to the mainland by a tongue of sand and was so named by Baron Wilhelm von Gloeden, a German aristocrat who lived in Taormina between the 19th and 20th centuries. The baron is credited with spreading the beauty of this town thanks to his photographic masterpieces, although he went down in history as the photographer of the scandal, in fact, he is remembered as the artist who gave Taormina an erotic-bucolic face.\n\nIsola Bella was donated to the Municipality of Taormina by Ferdinand I of Bourbon around 1806. It was then purchased around 1890 by a wealthy English noblewoman, Florence Trevelyan, who was exiled to Sicily by Queen Victoria of England because she was the lover of her cousin and future king Edward VII. In Taormina, Florence Trevelyan married the Taormina surgeon Prof. Salvatore Cacciola. When Lady Treveylan and her husband died, the islet was inherited by her nephew and lawyer Cesare Acrosso, who sold it to the Lo Turco family. In 1954, Isola Bella was bought by the Bosurgi family of Messina, owners of Sanderson, an important citrus processing company. In 1982, the bankruptcy of Sanderson caused the Bosurgi family’s assets to be sold at auction, so Isola Bella was also sold. In 1990 it was then bought by the Assessorato dei Beni Culturali and in 1998 the island was declared a nature reserve, passing under the management first of the WWF and then of Cutgana, which, to this day, contributes to keeping this place a corner of paradise.\n\nSmall gourmode treat: the mixture of typical Mediterranean vegetation and exotic plants is due to the former owner, Lady Trevelyan, who, taking advantage of her passion for her green thumb, planted on the islet some very valuable tropical species that, when mixed with the Mediterranean vegetation, now create a unique scenario.\n\nDid you know? The Bosurgi family built an enormous ‘diffuse’ villa on the island to receive friends and acquaintances. Twelve residential units are scattered and hidden among the island’s greenery, and a tiny swimming pool is also set among the rocks, blending perfectly with the landscape. The island has hosted many celebrities, including Marylin Monroe and Truman Capote.\n\nGREEK THEATRE\n\nTaormina’s Greek Theatre is the second largest in Sicily. Seeing it at night, even for a concert or opera, is a spectacular open-air venue.\n\nTHE ALLEYS OF TAORMINA\n\nLose yourself in the alleys and narrow streets while indulging in the local sights and scents.\n\nTHE SANCTUARY OF THE MADONNA DELLA ROCCA\n\nA small but enchanting little church carved completely into the rock from which to admire Taormina from above.\n\nCUSENI HOUSE\n\nBuilt at the beginning of the 20th century, Casa Cuseni has been an international art centre that has hosted celebrities from the world of literature and painting, from Ernest Hemingway, who wrote his first short story as a young man here, to Anatole France, Tennessee Williams, Roald Dahl, Ezra Pound, Denis Mack Smith, Sir Frank Brangwyn, Sir Alfred East, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Sir George Clausen, Henry Faulkner and many others, even in recent times. The Villa has one of the most important theosophical parks in Europe.\n\nIn 1950, Casa Cuseni became Sicily’s first House Museum and in 2016 the Museum of Fine Arts and the Grand Tour of the City of Taormina.\n\nVIA PIRANDELLO\n\nTake a ride on a Vespa or in a Fiat 500 on Via Pirandello, the city’s most scenic street connecting the centre of Taormina with the sea.\n\nLocations à la mode\n\nPESCEPAZZO HOUSE\n\nThe Pescepazzo dedicated space/showroom where new ideas come to life. An explosion of colours, multicoloured feathers, velvet ribbons and fabrics of all kinds in which, by appointment, you can immerse yourself to get to know our world and see Coffe and caftans live Pescepazzo.\n\nThe space is inside a 1920s villa, overlooking Isola Bella and surrounded by a marvellous garden that is itself a great inspiration for Pescepazzo creations (the fuchsia of bougainvillaea, the yellow of broom, the orange of hibiscus…)\n\nDANEU 1885\n\nThe historical workshop where traditional objects (terracotta nativity scenes, embroidery, antique prints and hand-painted tablecloths), thanks to the owner’s impeccable and never banal taste, transport you for a moment to a distant, authentic Sicily full of magic.\n\nDaneu 1885 – Corso Umberto 126, Taormina\n\nLO TURCO ANTICHITÀ\n\nThe Cabinet de curiosité, in which antiques mingle with maxi necklaces inspired by the animal world and beautiful coral jewellery (the red coral rosaries and crosses are not to be missed!).\n\nLo Turco Antichità – Corso Umberto 106, Taormina\n\nVINCENZO DASCANIO BOUTIQUE TAORMINA\n\nFresh and dried flowers (the place where I like to buy flowers for my home), but also ceramics and candles inspired by Sicilian sweets (cassate, cannoli etc.) for a fun and colourful table.\n\nVincenzo Dascanio Boutique Taormina – Piazza S. Domenico de Guzman 5, Taormina\n\nLocations gourmet\n\nTERRACE OF THE BELMOND GRAND HOTEL TIMEO\n\nThe most enchanting view in the whole city, where you can sip an Etna Spritz inspired by the eruptions of Etna (ingredients: Amaro Amara, Sicilian sparkling wine, Soda and Bitter Campari), enjoy live music and, if you’re lucky, see the fiery red lava flowing down the slopes of the volcano in the distance.\n\nThe Belmond Grand Hotel Timeo is located opposite the Greek Theatre, overlooking the incredible view of Mount Etna and the Bay of Naxos and surrounded by a magnificent terraced garden. Taormina’s first hotel, since 1800 has been a destination for travellers from all over Europe on the so-called Grand Tour, describing it as “a piece of paradise on earth”.\n\nSneak peek: in 1863, Count Otto Geleng, from faraway Prussia, arrived in Taormina and began to paint what lay before his enraptured eyes: snow-capped Etna beyond a suggestive barrier of flowering almond trees. With those paintings, he participated in a prestigious exhibition in Paris. On that occasion, many artists will deny that there can be any place in the world where almond trees are in blossom, while snow abounds in the mountains.\n\nBelmond Grand Hotel Timeo – Via Teatro Greco 59, Taormina\n\nVINERIA MODÌ\n\nA gourmet winery is recommended for dinner right in the heart of Taormina, among the Naumachie and the most beautiful and characteristic alleys of the old town. Every dish is made with the finest ingredients and innovative techniques without forgetting tradition. Even the mise en place is elegant and meticulous in its smallest details.\n\nTo try: red prawn from Mazzara, citrus fruits, ricotta and cocoa grue.\n\nVineria Modì – Via Calapitrulli 13, Taormina\n\nANCIOVI\n\nA perfect restaurant for a summer lunch, by the pool, in the setting of a unique place: the Four Seasons Taormina San Domenico Palace (a former Franciscan friars’ convent converted into a luxury hotel).\n\nTo try: Bronte pistachio pizza with black truffle\n\nAnciovi – Via S. Domenico 5, Taormina\n\nMÉDOUSA BISTROT & SUITES\n\nA bistro where traditional Sicilian flavours are revisited in a modern and surprising way in the setting of a beautiful Sicilian garden. Excellent for aperitifs.\n\nTo try: the tapas, in particular the aubergine millefeuille with buffalo mousse.\n\nMédousa Bistrot & Suites – Via Sesto Pompeo 1, Taormina\n\nMORGANA LOUNGE BAR\n\nIconic cocktail bar, magical place par excellence of Taormina’s nightlife. Peculiarities? Its design changes every year to surprise and leave those who enter it open-mouthed, remaining enchanted!\n\nTo try: the champagne with peach granita.\n\nMorgana Lounge Bar – Scesa Morgana 4, Taormina\n\nBAM BAR\n\nThe best granita in Taormina.\n\nBam Bar – Via di Giovanni 45, Taormina\n\nWe satisfied both eyes and palate by discovering the hidden gems of the pearl of the Mediterranean. We sincerely thank Laura for bringing us these delightful treasures that we are looking forward to adding to our summer itineraries!\n\nPs: From which magical place will we receive the next Postcard addressed to us?
