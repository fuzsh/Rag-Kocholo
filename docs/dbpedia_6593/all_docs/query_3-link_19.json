        "text": "Summary\n\nKaterina Wilczynski (1894-1978) was born in Poland and worked in Germany. She worked as a painter, illustrator and etcher. While she produced portraits and cityscapes she mainly worked as a landscape artist.\n\nThis drawing in pen and ink is titled \"Taormina\" in the bottom right corner. Taormina is a small town situated on the east coast of Sicily. The town of Taormina pre-dates 832 BC when the Greeks arrived on the island to found the town of Naxos. In this drawing Wilczynski has combined pieces of sculpture and pottery to create a composition. On the right a cupboard full of antique pottery refers to the ancient foundations of the town whil e a sculpture of Christ presides in the centre looking down an antique sculpture of a soldier. This combination of antique and early modern sculptures conveys the traces of Taormina's ancient and religious past which the artist encountered in the town."
