        "text": "Traveling through this region is like having a journey between different cultures: Arabians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Normans and Spanish. All these populations had contributed to create this whimsical, colorful and crazy Italian region.\n\nToday it’s possible to see them in the architectures and in the landscapes, but also to enjoy the local food and wine culture.\n\nHere are some highlights of what to see, what to do and what you shouldn’t definitely miss.\n\nCATANIA\n\nWe can start our journey in this ancient city, situated at the foot of the largest active volcano of Europe, majestic Mount Etna. Catania was founded by the ancient Greeks with the name of Katáne, but the current city doesn’t show much about that time. In the XVII century, the largest eruption of the Etna in history to date occurred. All the nearby cities were destroyed, after this, Catania was totally rebuilt in the characteristic Sicilian baroque style, the same that you can admire today.\n\nA day in Catania a walk around the city center, in the direction of Piazza Duomo, UNESCO World Heritage Site. Here you can admire the great architecture of the Church of St. Agata, protector of the city, built with a black and white color contrast obtained via lava and calcareous stones. Crossing the square will lead us to the Fish Market, La Pescheria, one of the most picturesque experiences that can be enjoyed here! It’s chaotic and colorful and you can take a taste of the freshest fish in one of the many little restaurants around the area.\n\nTalking about food, you cannot experience the real Catania without trying Pasta alla Norma, that was invented here. It’s an eggplant based dish and very delicious! Don’t miss the opportunity to taste a minna di Sant’Agata, the traditional pastry of the city, that was created in dedication of the city protector.\n\nOne place I recommend checking out:\n\nGelateria Bar Ernesto : Viale Ruggero di Lauria 91/93 - Catania (closed on Tuesday)\n\nETNA\n\nAccording to the ancient Roman myth, the Etna was home of Vulcan, the fire and forge God. He fled here after being banished from Olympus by Jupiter and continued to forge the gods’ arms using the lava.\n\nWe can choose between different opportunities here: a tasting of the typical Etna wine and of the delicious local honey are a must!\n\nA winery to visit (a reservation is a must):\n\nPalmento Costanzo : C.da - Passopisciaro\n\nA trekking tour to one of the craters with an expert guide, to hear the myths of the volcano as well as enjoy some amazing views.\n\nAlternatively, during the winter, it’s possible go skiing on the slopes, when will you have again an opportunity like this?\n\nPALERMO\n\nPalermo is aristocratic, decadent, energetic and chaotic. In one word, Palermo is unique.\n\nHere it is recommended a walking tour. Every corner has a different style: Arabic and Norman buildings, Byzantine mosaic decorations and Baroque streets. Palermo is famous for its street food, and enjoying as many different types of street food such as arancine, fried rice balls with various stuffings, or panelle, chickpea croquettes is highly recommended. The most adventurous ones should try some bread with grilled spleen, as true locals! Don’t miss the “sweet part”. Ricotta stuffed cannoli, almond or mulberry granita and pistachio ice-cream usually served with the brioche col tuppo, called like this because the top has the shape of the characteristic women chignon, tuppo in Sicilian dialect.\n\nPalermo is also famous for the markets, in particular we’ll go for the Ballarò one. Here you’ll have a true Italian experience. The narrow Arabic style streets are the stage for many sellers of fruit, vegetables, household products, clothes and different type of food. You’ll hear the locals negotiating with the sellers and you’ll smell in the air the street food aromas.\n\nWhere to grab a bite:\n\nOsteria Ballirò : Via Calascibetta 25 - Palermo (open everyday lunch and dinner)\n\nERICE and TRAPANI\n\nNext stop is Trapani, the city from which the Spanish Aragona family started the Sicilian conquer. We’ll cross the city center, built in the Spanish baroque style, to catch the cableway to Erice.\n\nErice is a beautiful medieval village, but we recommend looking out for the best pastry shop of Sicily. Erice has one sweet specialty that will have you craving for more. A cookie filled with a lemon zest pastry cream called Genovesi. If you arrive at the right moment you can get one warm from the oven.\n\nTo conclude the day a visit to the Trapani salt mines. Where you can see the salt harvesting work and while having a sunset walk, you’ll be stunned by the wonderful panorama. The salt pans touched by the sunlight are colored in pink and sometimes you can spot flamingos in the background resting.\n\nWhere to grab that Genovesi:\n\nPasticceria Maria Grammatica - Via Vittorio Emanuele 14 - Erice\n\nMARSALA\n\nEveryone must make a stop in Marsala to understand the history of Marsala and taste a Marsala you won’t want to cook with!\n\nMarsala was the first Italian wine to gain worldwide recognition. It was an English man, John Woodhouse, who created it in the XVIII century. After tasting a Sicilian sweet wine here, he decided to ship some to England, but added some spirits to ensure the wine wouldn't change during the journey. This gave birth to Marsala wine.\n\nIn the XIX century, Vincenzo Florio founded the Florio wineries. He also acquired the English wineries in the city and quickly became the undisputed magnate of Marsala.\n\nWhere to visit:\n\nCantine Florio : Via Vincenzo Florio 1 - Marsala (a reservation is required)\n\nMAZARA DEL VALLO\n\nMazara was one of the most important Saracen centres in the region, and the city vividly reflects its historical significance. A walk in the Kasbah, a maze of narrow streets where you will find buildings that are decorated with colorful tiles and still today there’s an hammam. A delicacy to try are the red shrimps from the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nWhere to grab a bite:\n\nAl Pesciolino d’Oro : Via Lungomare S. Vito 109 - Mazara del Vallo"
