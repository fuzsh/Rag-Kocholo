        "text": "Books about Sicily\n\nIn alphabetical order by: Author Title\n\nA Cypress in Sicily\n\nHoward Agg\n\nSet in the town of Taormina, this book tells the story of the Villa Fontana Vecchia, the one-time home of D.H. Lawrence, and the day-to-day life of the Taorminese surrounding it. It is said that the inspiration for \"Lady Chatterley’s Lover\" came from his experience in Taormina.\n\nPalermo\n\nRoberto Alajmo\n\nThis is a small, entertaining volume of observations - Palermo and the Palermitani; their lifestyle, politics and secrets.\n\nMargaret, Queen of Sicily\n\nJacqueline Alio\n\nMargaret of Navarre, Sicily’s queen to William I, and consort to her son, William II, was the most powerful woman in the Mediterranean in the mid-12th century. She was influential in her husband’s court and had a long lasting and interesting relationship with Thomas Becket. Jacqueline has written the only biography about this complex medieval woman who lived in a complex time that included a multicultural society. As with all of Jacqueline’s books, it is authoritative and yet easy to read and engaging, taking the reader along a journey. The book will appeal to historians, both casual and academic alike.\n\nQueens of Sicily 1061-1266: The queens consort, regent and regnant of the Norman-Swabian era of the Kingdom of Sicily (Sicilian Medieval Studies)\n\nJacqueline Alio\n\nJackie Alio is a prolific and wonderful writer. This new book, out in June, 2019, contains eighteen stories about one-time important women in Europe’s medieval history. Each one unique. Some never told before and all based on Jackie’s original research, often from primary sources. It is the first book of its kind.\n\nSicilian Queenship: Power and Identity in the Kingdom of Sicily 1061-1266\n\nJacqueline Alio\n\nShe’s known as the biographer of Sicily’s medieval queens. Jacqueline Alio is one of Sicily’s leading medievalists, a thoughtful author bringing an enormous amount to the field of women’s studies, and doing so in English! This is the supplemental book to \"Queens of Sicily 1061-1266.\" It brings us deeper into the lives and times of the earliest countesses and queens of Sicily. These fascinating studies shed new light and round out the historical account of that time period.\n\nWomen of Sicily: Saints, Queens, and Rebels\n\nJacqueline Alio\n\nJaqueline is a wealth of knowledge about Sicilian history. Here, she uses that knowledge to introduce us to 17 courageous women, who despite their gender, had an impact on events over the course of Sicily’s complex history. A rare examination of women in a place traditionally dominated by males. Included is also a brief overview of history and chronology.\n\nThe Ferraris Chronicle: Popes, Emperors, and Deeds in Apulia 1096-1228 (Sicilian Medieval Studies)\n\nJacqueline Alio (translation) and Louis Mendola\n\nThis is an important scholarly work, originally written in Latin, by a Monk who had firsthand knowledge of Frederick II. It is possibly the first history of the Kingdom of Sicily, which was founded in 1130. For lovers of history, this work will take you into the early workings of the time, and give you a first hand look like few, if any, other books could.\n\nSicilian Studies: A Guide and Syllabus for Educators\n\nJaqueline Alio\n\nThese two friends, among Sicily’s leading historians and lecturers, have given us some helpful ways and resources to introduce students and those interested to the world’s most conquered island. Jackie and Lou write in an approachable manner, making the subject matter always fascinating and readable.\n\nKingdom of Sicily 1130-1266: The Norman-Swabian Age and the Identity of a People\n\nJaqueline Alio and Louis Mendola\n\nA tome that is both readable and scholarly, with fascinating details about a period of time rarely explored in depth. The primary source material is eye opening and everything in this book is so well documented.\n\nExciting Food For Southern Types\n\nPellegrino Artusi\n\nThis slim volume is an excerpt from the definitive Italian cookbook, Science in the Kitchen and the Art of Eating Well. Self-published in 1891, post-Unification, he was the first to include recipes from all over Italy. Artusi writes with chatty banter. His commentary is often funny and as relevant today as it was then. He starts off by saying “Cooking is a troublesome sprite”… and goes on to say “Cheer up, if you eat these cookies you will never die, or you will live as long as Methuselah…”\n\nThe Day of the Battle: The War in Sicily & Italy 1943-1944\n\nRick Atkinson\n\nConsidered one of the best books on the subject of the Italian campaigns written by Atkinson, Pulitzer Prize winning and brilliant military authority. His descriptions jump off the page and tell the story in brutal honesty with details about the military and personal aspects of war. The campaigns in the Mediterranean Theater often go overlooked because of Normandy, but these were important battles, with important Generals and decisions that did change and could have further changed history. Visit the Museo Storico dello Sbarco in Catania.\n\nThe Land Where Lemons Grow; The Story of Italy and Its Citrus Fruit\n\nHelena Attlee\n\nA fascinating read, this chronicle of the lemon and other citrus fruits begins in the Himalayas and follows its migration to Sicily’s shores, where it has become almost a symbol of the island itself. The book is a mix of travel writing, history, and horticulture, and for anyone interested in the culinary history of Italy, it is a must. A delightful book, it also contains occasional recipes and poems.\n\nThe Florios of Sicily: A Novel\n\nStefania Auci\n\nThe title in Italian is “The Lions of Sicily” which gives the reader an idea, right from the cover, about this family. The Florios have a long, important, aristocratic and influential history in Sicily, that includes wine and race cars, business and lovers. This book, an historical fiction account, describes the family’s origins and how they evolved, stopping at almost nothing to be at the top of society. An epic novel.\n\nThe Bear’s Famous Invasion of Sicily\n\nDino Buzzati\n\nThis classic Sicilian tale chronicles the terrible winter that sent the starving bears down into the valley of Sicily in search of food. This beautiful and noble book is at once a tragic history as well as a philosophical inquiry into Sicilian ideals.\n\nInspector Montalbano Series\n\nAndrea Camilleri (1925 - 2019)\n\nThe Detective Montalbano Series is hugely popular in Italy and has been adapted for both TV and film. The many, many stories take place in Sicily. Camilleri is Sicilian, from Porto Empedocle, the fictitious Vigata. They are smart, fun, creative mysteries, revolving around a modern day Sicily. Think Sherlock Holmes meets Colombo meets Bond. The books and the films are addictive.\n\nThe Revolution of the Moon\n\nAndrea Camilleri (1925 - 2019)\n\nFrom the author of the Inspector Montalbano series comes this gripping historical novel about a blip in time in 1677, when the wife of a deceased Viceroy, Eleonora di Mora, takes the reins of power in Palermo. She is highly intelligent and capable, but favors laws that care for the people and the scarred city in which she lives. Considered seditious by the clergy and the conservatives in government of the time, her tenure was short lived, just one cycle of the moon. Camilleri is a great story teller.\n\nPalmento: A Sicilian Wine Odyssey\n\nRoberto Camuto\n\nA thoroughly enjoyable read by a travel writer who investigates the history of wine, wine production today and the many colorful characters it includes. Camuto’s descriptions are utterly delightful. It is a trip around the island not to be taken without a glass of red at your side.\n\nSicilian Tales\n\nLuigi Capuana (translated by Santi V. Buscemi)\n\nCapuana was born in the Catania area of Sicily in 1839. Together with his friend Giovanni Verga the Verismo school, the Italian realist or naturalist school of literature was founded. He later influenced younger writers like Pirandello, from Agrigento. Although he wrote many novels, he is also known for his tales filled with rich characters.\n\nThe Marquis of Roccaverdina\n\nLuigi Capuana (translated by Santi V. Buscemi)\n\nAn engrossing story which analyzes the life of a Sicilian aristocrat forced to choose between his love for a peasant woman and the demands of a social structure that forbids his marrying a commoner.\n\nThe Hunger Saint\n\nOlivia Kate Cerrone\n\nThe subject of the toil and hardship once suffered in the Sicilian sulphur mines is a very tough one, and reviews for this new novella say she describes the grit stunningly. She has researched the subject very thoroughly and spoke about it with great eloquence in an interview in which I participated. The life of a Sicilian miner’s family and the plight of the children in the mines are stories that need to be recorded and told. A passionate and serious writer, I am happy to share Olivia’s important addition to the canon of works about Sicily. Available from Bordighera Press.\n\nA History of Muslim Sicily, 2nd Edition\n\nLeonard C. Chiarelli and Alessandro Vanoli\n\nThis revised edition is an in-depth study of the Arab presence on Sicily from 827 to 1070. It is a very detailed account of the many facets of the society from political to cultural, from economic to social. The book includes demographics, maps, and photos of sites. The author, a Sicilian-American authority on the subject, also discusses the relations the Arabs had with other Muslim factions, the Byzantine Empire North Africa. The 243 Arab years in Sicily were a very interesting time. The Arabs brought so much to the island.\n\nArabs and Normans in Sicily and the South of Italy\n\nAdele Cilento\n\nThis beautiful book is rich in color as well as academic authorship. It looks into the period of history that is perhaps Sicily’s richest, a ‘golden age’ of multiculturalism. tolerance, and innovation that occurred on the island and the south of Italy. So much of what we know as ‘Sicilian’ stems from this time period, and its importance led UNESCO to award its presence in Palermo protection. Flipping through the hundreds of photos in these pages is transporting.\n\nThe Lady of the Wheel\n\nAngelo F. Coniglio\n\nThis short work of fiction rooted in history tells of the poverty in and around Racalmuto in the late 1800’s, at a time when men and children worked in the mines. It is affecting and very interesting. Angelo is fascinated with genealogy and his studies are evident in his writing.\n\nThe Chivalric Folk Tradition in Sicily: A History of Storytelling, Puppetry, Painted Carts and Other Arts\n\nMarcella Croce and Moira F. Harris\n\nI’ve enjoyed reading these books by Marcella Croce and learning how traditions develop over time and their roots. This volume deals with Sicilian storytelling, puppetry, festivals, cart painting and other folk art.\n\nHistory on the Road: The Painted Carts of Sicily\n\nMarcella Croce\n\nPublished in 2005, this book approaches the subject of traditional Sicilian carts in depth, from every angle.\n\nThe Golden Honeycomb\n\nVincent Cronin\n\nThe story centers around the search for a, perhaps, legendary golden honeycomb offered by Daedalus to Aphrodite in gratitude for his escape from King Minos of Crete. A poetic, romantic and sometimes scholarly, history of Sicily, written as he travels from place to place in search of the truth. An extremely useful read to help pick apart the layered history visible in churches and cathedrals as well as at the sites of the very well preserved ruins. Very enjoyable.\n\nBitter Victory, The Battle for Sicily 1943\n\nCarlo D’Este\n\nA thorough, almost epic, investigation about “Operation Husky,” examining both British and American points of view under Generals Montgomery and Patton. The title references the lost opportunity to stop the Axis as they retreated from Sicily which would have changed history\n\nSicily\n\nGuy De Maupassant\n\nA 19th century travel perspective from one of the many great writers who spent time in Sicily and were inspired to write about it. A great writer in a great land; what more needs to be said? It is not a hefty book and well worth the time for the skillful and romantic articulation.\n\nThe Dangerously Truthful Diary of a Sicilian Housewife\n\nVeronica Di Grigoli\n\nVeronica is gifted with keen observational skills, insight, and the dry wit of her English background. In this hilarious story of what it is like to be married to a Sicilian and live in a small town in Sicily, she manages to capture the particularities of the characters that surround her, the mannerisms, the things that are part of accepted daily life, and see the humorous, even sometimes ridiculous, side of them. She does this with obvious love and affection, all of which endears the reader to her. Veronica writes a blog under the same name and both are really fun reads.\n\nTrinacria: A Tale of Bourbon Sicily\n\nAnthony Di Renzo\n\nThis is a new novel based on a composite of early 19th century historical truths. Di Renzo, a professor, writes with wit and an easy manner, keeping the reader interested in the next page, learning more and more about Sicily and the sometimes unpleasant hidden truths.\n\nA House by the Sea\n\nLouise Douglas\n\nThis mystery novel is set in the area south of Ragusa, by the sea, in Sicily’s southeast. The protagonists suffered a tragedy, divorced and then inherited the house that had been in the husbands family for generations. The authors descriptions of the landscape and the people are very vivid and transporting. The couple’s story is told with great sensitivity and brings the readers heart into the story that ends with an interesting twist.\n\nPalermo, City of Kings: The Heart of Sicily\n\nJeremy Dummett\n\nThis is Dummett’s second book after Syracuse: City of Legends. I like Dummett’s writing style, both easy and erudite. This is an historical overview and guide book of Palermo, unique and full of interesting information relating to particular sites. The maps are helpful, too.\n\nSyracuse, City of Legends: A Glory of Sicily\n\nJeremy Dummett\n\nThis is a colorful investigation of the enormously rich history of Siracusa and its historical inhabitants, the city Cicero called “the greatest Greek city and the most beautiful of them all.” Included is some information for tourists.\n\nSicily: Island of Beauty and Conflict\n\nJeremy Dummett\n\nThis is a sweeping history of the island that finishes Dummett’s trilogy. His previous two books focused on the cities of Palermo and Siracusa. Jeremy is a historian with deep knowledge of the island. In this book, he covers not just the chronology of Sicily’s history, but its culture, oppression, prosperity and power.\n\nGhosts of the Belle Epoque; The History of the Grand Hotel et Des Palmes\n\nAndrew Edwards and Suzanne Edwards\n\nOne of my favorite hotels in Sicily is this old Grande Dame. More than 100 years old, it is an ambient place replete with history, mystery and beauty. This fascinating read includes all of it from Wagner to Winston Churchill.\n\nSicily: A Literary Guide for Travellers\n\nAndrew Edwards and Suzanne Edwards\n\nMy love of quotes made me excited for this book, a compilation and exploration of thought and writing by literati from the Greek age to the 20th Century, all of whom were so affected by visions of Sicily, that they committed their impressions to paper.\n\nSicily, A Cultural History\n\nJoseph Farrell\n\nAn English professor of Italian, Farrell explores Sicily from many angles. He talks about festivals and religion, history and literature, the Baroque, Classical, and Greek. An interesting organization of such a complex history.\n\nVolcanoes and Wine: From Pompeii to Napa\n\nCharles Frankel\n\nThis book covers a lot of ground but like Palmento is like traveling with a glass in hand. There is no question that making wine on a volcano is a unique experience and the result is also unique. There are similarities in the terrain and great differences depending on location and climate. Not too academic, this book will allow you to appreciate more about these delicious wines.\n\nLa Dolce Vita University: An Insider’s Guide to Italian Culture from A to Z\n\nCarla Gambescia\n\nThis book is an alphabet of interesting things Italian you thought you knew, but did not. From origins of phrases and meanings of gestures, to historical descriptions and curiosities, Carla turns her love of Italy into an enjoyable, illuminating journey, with knowledge, humor, and very charming illustrations by Lannie Hart.\n\nThe Last Leopard; A Life of Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa\n\nDavid Gilmore\n\nThis definitive biography tells the fascinating story of Lampedusa, who died in 1957, never having seen his now classic book, The Leopard, published. His adopted son, Gioacchino Tomasi di Lampedusa gave Gilmore access to papers and writings to tell us more about this great talent and revered man.\n\nThe Mythology of Plants: Botanical Lore from Ancient Greece and Rome\n\nAnnette Giesecke\n\nEasily accessible and beautifully illustrated, this book covers the fascinating topic of plants within Greek and Roman mythology which often play an important role in Sicily.\n\nBeautiful Angiola, The Great Treasury of Sicilian Folk and Fairy Tales\n\nLaura Gonzenbach (translated by Jack Zipes)\n\nLike the Grimm brothers before her, Laura Gonzenbach, a talented Swiss-German born in Sicily, set out to gather up the tales told and retold among the peasants. Gonzenbach collected wonderful stories - some on subjects that readers will know from the Grimms or Perrault, some entirely new - and published them in German.\n\nMythology\n\nEdith Hamilton\n\nSo much of touring in Sicily references mythology. This volume, published in the ‘40s, covers a lot of territory with an index of stories.\n\nThe Odyssey\n\nHomer\n\nWritten in 800 B.C. this classic Greek tale explores the cunning abilities of Odysseus to overcome the limits of his human strength in the many tests that befall him on his epic journey. Many of the stories are set in Sicily, including the famous story of Polyphemus in which Odysseus and his men escaped the grips of Polyphemus by attaching themselves to the underbelly of his sheep. Polyphemus threw rocks at them which now jut out of the sea on the east coast’s Riviera dei Ciclopi. The story of Scylla and Charybdis associated with the Straights of Messina, is another example of how Odysseus used his wits to overcome his mortal weakness.\n\nSicily ‘43; The First Assault on Fortress Europe\n\nJames Holland\n\nAccording to this noted historian, Operation Husky was more important to the overall Allied effort than WWII histories would lead us to believe. It does not get the recognition it deserves. Holland’s book has received excellent reviews for examining and correcting the history in an unsentimental and focused manner.\n\nThe Family Tree Italian Genealogy Guide: How to Trace Your Family Tree in Italy\n\nMelanie Holtz\n\nThis is the most up-to-date reference book on the market today that will walk you through the exciting journey of researching your Italian family both here and in Italy.

It is a good resource.\n\nThe Almond Picker\n\nSimonetta Agnello Hornby\n\nSet in the turbulent and complicated times of 1960’s Sicily, this book tells the story of La Mennulara, the child of poor Sicilian farmers. She becomes a maid for a well-to-do family and through hard work and a clever mind, becomes the administrator for the family’s affairs until her dying day. The story, which begins at the time of her death, details the interesting life of this mysterious Sicilian woman.\n\nSeeking Sicily: A Cultural Journey Through Myth and Reality\n\nJohn Keahey\n\nLike many before him, this travel writer fell in love with Sicily. Despite his non-Sicilian heritage, he repeatedly hits the nail on the head in this recent contribution to the library about Sicily. His observations and insights are terrific.\n\nSicilian Splendors: Discovering the Secret Places of the Heart\n\nJohn Keahey\n\nThis is John’s second book about Sicily, written on the heels of the success of Seeking Sicily. In this new and utterly engaging travelogue, John delves into Sicily’s core with descriptions of off the beaten path places and encounters with the warmth and generosity of the Sicilians who live there. John is a wonderful writer, with a keen sense of observation for people, places, and things. In this virtual trip to the place that he loves, we can happily devour the stories he tells, and be grateful that the simple truths about Sicily are finally being shared.\n\nLanguage and Travel Guide to Sicily\n\nGiovanna Bellia La Marca\n\nA culinary writer and instructor from Ragusa gives us this good introductory guide to the major sights in Sicily and the Sicilian language.

Language CDs also included.\n\nWords Are Like Stones\n\nCarlo Levi (1902-1975)\n\nBy the author of “Christ Stopped at Eboli” and with equally fine-tuned observations of the land of Sicily, often with a sense of humor. Traditions, nature, struggles and ambitions are themes illuminated by Levi.\n\nIn Sicily\n\nNorman Lewis\n\nThis travel narrative and social commentary is about many aspects of life in Sicily. Lewis compares his memories of Sicily from WWII to the present day, noting changes in both the cities and culture. He describes landscapes and small towns, and encourages visits to experience the island with his vibrant and evocative writing style. Lewis balances his enthusiasm for the positive with a constant eye to the negative and how much mafia presence has affected the island.\n\nBorges in Sicily, Journey with a Blind Guide\n\nAlejandro Luque\n\nWhen Alejandro Luque receives a book of photographs taken in Sicily by the Argentinian writer, essayist, and poet Luis Borges, he decides to trace the writer’s journey, setting off with a group of friends on his own Sicilian odyssey. Meticulously identifying the location of each photograph, Luque uses Borges’s pictures to imagine the range of emotions that the renowned writer felt as he experienced the same views. The book features vintage photos by Ferdinando Scianna. Edwards is no stranger to writing literary histories.\n\nThe Invention of Sicily\n\nJamie Mackay\n\nIn what seems like a whirlwind recounting of Sicily’s dense history, in the end, the reader is offered a broad take on the evolution of the Island, a roller coaster of success and failure, of power, stability and insecurity as well. Where other books delve deep into time periods and certain histories, this one paves a geopolitical path, the extends from Sicily’s earliest colonists and settlers, through WWII and beyond. All of it informs present day Sicily and Sicily’s ever elastic borders. This is not just another history of Sicily, it is a perspective that is a good addition to the cannon of Sicily histories.\n\nMattanza: The Ancient Sicilian Ritual of Bluefin Tuna Fishing\n\nTheresa Maggio\n\nA mattanza, in Italian, is a slaughter. Theresa Maggio relates the fascinating story of the ancient springtime slaughter of the highly prized Bluefin tuna. Maggio weaves her own tale of discovery and even love into this elegant description of the hard lives of Sicilian fishermen who chase the Bluefin and re-enact a hunt that extends far back in history and whose rituals, including that ceremonial massacre, have gone essentially unchanged for thousands of years. Although the subject, at first glance, seemed unappealing, I thoroughly enjoyed this read.\n\nThe Stone Boudoir: In search of the hidden villages of Sicily\n\nTheresa Maggio\n\nA captivating personal journey through towns and settlements. Maggio’s portrait of Sicilians is insightful and full of intimacy and warmth. Her descriptions of festivities and traditions, scenery and beauty are evocative and compelling.\n\nThe Kingdom of Sicily 1100-1250: A Literary History\n\nKarla Mallette\n\nThis is the first literary history of the Kingdom of Sicily during the 12th and 13th centuries. The author explains how the Normans, who seized control of the island after Muslim invaders conquered it in the 9th century, utilized and adopted the Muslim traditions in order to create the Greco-Arabic culture that still exists in Sicily today.\n\nThe Silent Duchess\n\nDacia Maraini\n\nAlthough the plot of this story takes place in the 18th Century, its theme is timeless. Marianna is born into an aristocratic family, experiences a traumatic event that renders her deaf and mute. For many years afterward, she lives a silent life of subservient struggle, unable to control her own fate and even find her own voice. Maraini writes with great descriptive language and gives Marianna a vibrant interior dialogue, all the while referencing a Sicily of the time. Highly regarded, women often recognize the plight of the protagonist as one that has been fought many times over at different times and under different circumstances.\n\nThe Heart and the Island: A Critical Study of Sicilian American Literature\n\nChiara Mazzucchelli\n\nThis is an important and very interesting book, a first for this subject. It investigates the Sicilian essence, communicated brilliantly through Sicilian literature, and how it changed, when it migrated to this country. Chiara studies a host of Sicilian-American authors, some of whom are on this list, who have incorporated their immigrant status, and experiences on this side of the ocean, into the wealth of their writing. She discusses the similarities and differences of the voices themselves and how they reflect back to Sicily. She helps the reader to understand the Sicilian essence both here and there, and for Sicilian-Americans, perhaps, a way to understand themselves.\n\nSicilian Genealogy and Heraldry\n\nLouis Mendola\n\nA comprehensive and sometimes technical look at family research and post 1500 history in Sicily. Based on years of research and experience, this book can help anyone initiating a search while it educates about life in the period that picks up where his and Jaqueline Alio’s earlier book, “The Peoples of Sicily” left off.\n\nThe Kingdom of Sicily 1130-1860\n\nLouis Mendola\n\nThis interesting read takes off into detail where Lou’s earlier book, The Peoples of Sicily leaves off. Although some of the material in The Kingdom of Sicily had been earlier included in The Peoples of Sicily and also incorporated from The Women of Sicily, Jaqueline Alio’s book also published by Trinacria Press, the details are so complex that one book alone could never spell it all out. In spite of the level of detail and the meticulous research, Lou lays it out in a straightforward, easy to read manner. If you want the next level of understanding of Sicilian history, you will enjoy this.\n\nSicily’s Rebellion against King Charles: John of Procida. The Story if the Sicilian Vespers\n\nLouis Mendola (translation) and Jaqueline Alio\n\nThe first English translation of the manuscript that tells the story of the War of the Vespers, begun in Palermo in 1282.

From emirs to kings, muqarnas to mosaics, this book includes details rarely published elsewhere, some drawn from the authors’ original research. The book is due out in October 2017. When it comes to Sicily, Jaqueline and Lou are among the most knowledgeable people I know. All of their books are well written, and read more like novels than histories.\n\nThe Kingdom of the Two Sicilies 1734-1861\n\nLouis Mendola\n\nThe Two Sicilies has left its mark on what the world perceives as Italian culture and Lou tells you why in this thorough and fascinating history. Spaghetti, pizza and one of Europe’s first chocolate recipes were born in this region, along with the first vernacular Italian literary language. Most Italian Americans come from this region so this history speaks to all of us.\n\nBehind Closed Doors: Her Father’s House and Other Stories of Sicily by Maria Messina\n\nElise Magistro\n\nThese recently discovered stories saved Messina from obscurity. She documents the struggle of early 20th century women in Sicily, both from tradition and especially from mass emigration. She talks about the conflict between holding onto beloved tradition and a desire to be independent.\n\nWomen’s Cooking: Tales & Recipes from Filicudi\n\nGiusi Murabito\n\nA book chock full of heart and written with admiration for women who live and cook on this remote island. Giusi captured daily life and wonderful recipes.\n\nI Beati Paoli\n\nLuigi Natoli\n\nA historian, journalist and novelist, Natoli chronicled the history of Sicilian people, their conditions and circumstances. He has been compared to Victor Hugo in style. The Beati Paoli was a secret sect that defended the poor and revolted against the church in medieval Sicily. These were originally penned under his pseudonym, William Galt in 1909.\n\nThe World of Sicilian Wine\n\nBill Nesto and Frances Di Savino\n\nA very comprehensive look at the roller coaster history of wine in Sicily and how it has evolved to play an important role on the worldwide wine stage. A very interesting read for historians in general.\n\nSicily: An Island at the Crossroads of History\n\nJohn Julius Norwich\n\nErudite and a lover of Sicily, Norwich is a British diplomat, historian, and bestselling author. In this book, he revisits the often told fascinating history of Sicily. Norwich is so familiar with the many facets of the island to have real opinions and biases of his own. He tells the story with intimacy of facts and biographical intrigue, and that he exalts Roger II is fine with me.\n\nGrowing Up Sicilian and Female\n\nSadie Penzato\n\nThis is an honest and enchanting authobiography written by a first generation Sicilian-American woman.

His 300 tales are mostly situated in the west, since Gonzenbach had covered the east, and are all written in dialect.

In Palermo, under French rule, there is unrest and a revolt takes place. This novel is set in a vibrant Sicily with the chaotic markets, Norman architecture and medieval mindsets. It is a gripping tale that fleshes out an important time period in Sicilian history.\n\nItalian Journey\n\nJohann Wolfgang Von Goethe (1749-1832)\n\nPossibly the person most quoted when Sicily is referenced, and yet Sicily occupied only 6 weeks of Goethe’s Italian exploration in 1787, or, the equivalent of one long chapter in the book. The journals he kept and letters he wrote were the basis for this book. Right from the beginning, when he talks about being seasick and only able to take bread and red wine, one is captivated by his descriptive, immediate, and humorous writing.\n\nIdylls\n\nTheocritus (300 BC-260 BC)\n\nFrom the Oxford World of Classics. The father of pastoral poetry, often called “Sicilian” or “Siracusan” poetry, was a native of Siracusa, born in the 3rd century BC. He greatly influenced followers such as Virgil with his bucolic descriptions of life set in Sicily and Southern Italy. Reading the short poems gives real insight to life in a different time, the importance of Gods and Goddesses and nature. Even today they conjure up visions of a profusion of flowers and shepherds walking under the strong sun and azure blue sky.\n\nCavalleria Rusticana and Other Stories\n\nGiovanni Verga (1840-1922)\n\nA member of the Realism school, Verga wrote novels, short stories and plays. He wasn’t appreciated much until after his death and is now considered one of the greats of Italian writing. Wonderful stories.\n\nIl Malavoglia\n\nGiovanni Verga (1840-1922)\n\nWhat Verga called in his preface a 'sincere and dispassionate study of society' is a struggle against poverty and the elements by the fishermen of Aci Trezza, told in their own dialect.\n\nLittle Novels of Sicily (translated by DH Lawrence)\n\nGiovanni Verga (1840-1922)\n\nConversations in Sicily\n\nElio Vittorini and Alane Salierno Mason (1908-1966)\n\nNeo-realist in style, noted as a great novel of Italian anti-fascism, and said to be like Picasso’s Guernica, the books turns amusing when the protagonist returns to Sicily to rediscover his roots and life’s values.\n\nGuidebooks\n\nThere are many guidebooks and it seems everyone has their favorite. I prefer:\n\nThe Rough Guide to Sicily with its balance of good information and recommendations\n\nThe Blue Guide is good if you want a little more detailed information and fewer recommendations\n\nCadogan Guides are similar in information and recommendation but guide you to some sights and activities lesser known or off the beaten path.\n\nCicerone - Walking in Sicily – If you want to see Sicily on foot, here are step-by-step instructions.\n\nTouring Club Italiano, Sicilia, is the best map for driving. All the maps name the larger roads but not the regional or provincial ones. For all road names, check Google Maps."
