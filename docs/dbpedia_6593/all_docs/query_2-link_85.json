        "text": "Sicily: See it in 10 days\n\nHow to spend the perfect 10 days in Sicily\n\nTip 1: This is a counter-clockwise circuit of Sicily that takes in the island's greatest hits. (Why counter-clockwise? I honestly couldn't tell you. It just seems to work out best that way. On my last visit I tried, just for an experiment, to do it the other way around and my timing was off the entire trip.)\n\nSchedule at a glance\n\nDay 1 - Palermo\n\nDay 2 - Palermo\n\nDay 3 - Monreale, Segesta, Erice\n\nDay 4- Marsala, Mozia, Selinute, Agrigento\n\nDay 5 - Agrigento, [Piazza Armerina or Caltagirone or Ragusa], Siracusa\n\nDay 6 - Siracusa\n\nDay 7 - [Noto or Etna], Taormina\n\nDay 8 - Taormina, CefalÃ¹\n\nDay 9 - CefalÃ¹, Palermo\n\nDay 10 - HomeNow that so many low-cost airlines can fly you direct from many Italian and European cities into Palermo (in the case of Eurofly, you can even fly direct from New York), this trip starts in Palermo.\n\nHowever, if you're arriving the old-fashioned wayâvia train and the Straits of Messinaâyou could just as easily start this tour in CefalÃ¹, proceed to Palermo from there, and just keep going around.\n\nOr you could fly into Catania, grab a rental car there, and head up the coast to start in Taormina, continuing around and ending in Siracusa.\n\nIt really works any way you slice it. (Just don't try it clockwise.)\n\nTip 2: Sicily is best explored by carâtrains are often slow and frequently require connections, and many towns are serviced only by infrequent buses. That said, Palermo is one of my least favorite Italian cities in which to drive.\n\nDon't forget to pay attention to the \"Before you Leave Home \" box at the end of the itinerary covering all the details you need to take care of before leaving homeâand be sure to read the \"Foolish Assumptions\" page about how these itineraries work along with more time-planning tips.Best advice: If you're arriving by air, head into Palermo using public transportation, see the city, and then pick up a rental car on your way out of town.\n\nIf you arrive by train from the Italian mainland, and starting in CefalÃ¹, there is excellent train service from there on to Palermo, so I would do that and wait to pick up the car until you're ready to leave Palermo.\n\nTrivia\n\nThis is the actual itinerary I drew up for Arthur Frommer when he took his first trip to Sicily. So, yeah: I put a lot of thought into this one!Bonus: not only will this save you the aggravation of driving, it will also save you a lot of money (fewer rental days, no pricey gas to buy, no cost to garage it in Palermo, etc.).\n\nDAY 1 - PALERMO\n\nMorning: In transit\n\nLunch: Antica Focacceria San Francesco\n\nAfternoon: The sights of La Kalsa (Central Palermo)\n\nChiesa di San Francesco d'Assisi\n\nSerpotta's Stuccoed Chapels\n\nQuattro Canti/Piazza Pretoria\n\nLa Martorana/San Cataldo\n\nGalleria Regionale di Palazzo Abatellis\n\nDinner: La Cambusa\n\nHotel: Top picks:\n\nCHARMING: B&B Ai Cartari, Letizia\n\nPOSH: Centrale Palace Hotel\n\nPENNY-PINCHER: Posta, Cortese\n\nDAY 2 - PALERMO\n\nMorning: Churches and Catacombs in Western Palermo\n\nPalazzo dei Normanni/Cappella Palatina\n\nSan Giovanni degli Eremiti\n\nCatacombe del Convento dei Cappuccini\n\nLunch: Shanghai\n\nAfternoon: Markets & A Mountaintop Shrine\n\nStreet Markets (Vucciria, BallarÃ², Capo, Piazza Peranni)\n\nSanctuario di Santa Rosalia/Monte Pellegrino\n\nDinner: Santandrea\n\nDAY 3 - PALERMO TO ERICE\n\nMorning: The Mosaics of Monreale\n\nLunch: La Fattoria\n\nAfternoon: Greek Ruins and a Medieval Hilltown\n\nSegesta\n\nErice\n\nDinner: Monte San Giuliano, Erice\n\nHotel: Top picks:\n\nHotel La Pineta\n\nHotel Moderno\n\nDAY 4 - ERICE TO AGRIGENTO\n\nMorning: Fine Wines of Marsala\n\nLunch: Mothia (www.mothia.com)\n\nAfternoon: The Best Greek Ruins in the World\n\nSelinute [can cut if running short on time]\n\nAgrigento\n\nDinner: [A Choice]\n\nLa Forchetta\n\nCorte degli Sfizi\n\nHotel: Villa Athena [amazing place, well worth the splurge]\n\nDAY 5 - AGRIGENTO TO SIRACUSA\n\nMorning: Agrigentoâs Valley of the Temples\n\nAgrigento temples\n\nDrive to Siracusa\n\nTime for one stop en route, maybe two if you don't linger:\n\nMaybe: Caltagirone [ceramics town; if there's time/interest]\n\nMaybe: Piazza Armerina [ancient Roman villa; if there's time/interest]\n\nMaybe: Ragusa [medieval town; if there's time/interest]\n\nLunch: Depends on how the day goes\n\nAfternoon: SiracusaâExploring Ortigia\n\nTemple of Apollo\n\nDuomo (Cathedral)\n\nFonte Aretusa/Aquarium\n\nMuseo Regionale di Arte Medioevale e Moderna/Palazzo Bellomo\n\nDinner: Jonico-'A Rutta 'E CiÃ uli\n\nHotel: Top picks\n\nHotel Gutowski\n\nHotel Gran Bretagne\n\nDAY 6 - SIRACUSA\n\nMorning: Exploring The Archaeological Zone on the Mainland\n\nArchaeological Park of Neapolis (Latomia del Paradiso, Greek theater, Roman amphitheater)\n\nMuseo Archeologico Paolo Orsi\n\nCatacombs of San Giovanni\n\nLunch: Depends on how the day goes [Siracusa restaurants]\n\nAfternoon: Time just to wander and enjoy Siracusa, my favorite town in Sicily.\n\nDinner: La Foglia\n\nDAY 7 - SIRACUSA TO TAORMINA\n\nMorning: It all depends; pick one or two.\n\nMaybe: More Siracusa\n\nMaybe: Mt.
