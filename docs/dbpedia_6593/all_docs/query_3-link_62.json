His extensive career and ‘bean to cup’ knowledge has led to Giovanni’s industry title: coffee specialist.\n\nIt was inevitable that Giovanni would choose to craft his own unique coffee blends. His creative journey was inspired by his Italian heritage and traditional artistry, superior coffee skills and his resolute passion for exceptional coffee.\n\nGiovanni sources green coffee beans from several Estate growers in six of the principal coffee-producing regions of the tropics. Their 100% premium Arabica beans are selected for being speciality grade, hand-picked and fairly traded."
