        "text": "Without a doubt, get ready for an Italian adventure as there are countless things to do and see in Taormina. This is an old town that is perfect for history, culture, delicious food and awe-inspiring sights. Let me give you an edge on some of the best things to do in Taormina Sicily. Here they are – in no particular order:\n\nTaormina Boat Tour\n\nA great way to explore the Ionian Coast. Discover the Grotto Azzurra as well as the beautiful nature preserve of Isola Bella. Be on the beautiful sea surrounded by the breathless landscape of Etna and Taormina. We did not reserve, as the boats are by the beach of Isola Bella. It was wonderful!\n\nAncient Greek Theatre Taormina\n\nIf you are visiting Taormina, try to see a show at the world famous Teatro Greco, possibly the most spectacular venue on earth. The Ancient Greek Theatre is amazing. During the day take beautiful pictures of the ancient ruins. In the evening, take in a show at the Greek Theatre with Mount Etna as a backdrop. There are concerts and operas as varied as Sting and The Barber of Seville. For upcoming shows, click here: events and tickets. Visit the Taormina Opera Festival for their calendar of events.\n\nMount Etna\n\nA visit to Europe’s largest volcano, Mt. Etna offers an incredible chance to see lava flows up close. You can join a tour of Mt Etna’s lunar-like landscapes for an incredible experience. Mount Etna is one of the highest volcanos in Europe and one of the most active in the world. The volcano shaped Sicilian history and landscape and still affects the island today. It has been an UNESCO World Heritage site since 2013 and the smoking volcano, craters and lava flows are always an impressive experience for visitors.\n\nMT. ETNA WINERY TOUR\n\nVisit the vineyards and taste the wines of Mount Etna. There are wonderful local wineries where you can sample delicious varieties of wine. Visit a splendid winery nestled 900 Meters above sea level, on the northeastern slope of Mount Etna, and sample some of their delicious wines.\n\nCASTELMOLA\n\nCastlemola is a charming little medieval town up the mountain from Taormina. If you have a few hours, it is worth a visit. We took a bus up and walked back down to Taormina on an ancient path between the two. Included in the list of the most beautiful villages in Italy, in Castelmola time seems to have stopped. With its elevated position, Castelmola offers a view of a splendid Mediterranean from its central square.\n\nGODFATHER TOUR\n\nVisit some of the iconic film locations of the blockbuster hit The Godfather. Step back in time in Savoca and Forza D’Agrò and become a part of the filming of The Godfather! Click here for more information.\n\nAEOLIAN ISLANDS\n\nAs shown above, these are some of the best things to do in Taormina Sicily! Of course you can simply roam around the gorgeous city for days or relax at one of the beautiful beach clubs on Isola Bella too! You have so numerous options to do whatever makes you happy!\n\nA wonderful destination for a beach vacation is Taormina Beaches. Perched high upon a cliff is the old town city of Taormina. However, the beautiful beaches of Taormina are located down below, facing the Ioian sea. This area is know as Taormina Mare. The main road is sprinkled a handful of hotels and restaurants. Cross the street and you will find beautiful bays with several beach clubs, all within walking distance. Taormina beaches are gorgeous. They sparkle with crystal clear, beautiful blue water. Also, they are smooth pebble and rock beaches, which is so pretty.\n\nOf course thebeach clubs (lidos) in Taormina are fully equipped with rentals of beds, umbrellas and towels. Furthermore, they have delicious restaurants on their property. It is Italian custom to take a break from sunning and have lunch at the beach. Additionally, there is also a free public beach connecting to the small pretty island of Isola Bella.\n\nAt all the beaches you can find excursion boats to take you on a tour of the coast and bring you to the Grotto Azzura. I highly suggest taking the excursion. It is a delightful way to see some lovely areas, including going into caves. The boat also stops for swim in some of the most beautiful waters. There is music, fun and just a fabulous time! This is an experience that you will always remember! I recommend the excursion with Sebastian and Carmello.\n\nPrice – Summer 2022: Depends on how many people, it can be from EUR 24 – 29pp.\n\nTaormina Beaches – How to get there\n\nIf you are without a car, you may take a bus. But, a great option is the cable car or in Italian, the funivia. Indeed, It is located a short five minute walk from the east end of the Corso Umberto. In my opinion, it is an exhilarating and fun ride down the mountain that only takes a few minutes! It cost 3 euros one way or 6 roundtrip. Once you arrive at the bottom there are several beach clubs directly across the street, including the free public beach of Isola Bella.\n\nNote: The funivia line gets crowded in the late afternoon.
