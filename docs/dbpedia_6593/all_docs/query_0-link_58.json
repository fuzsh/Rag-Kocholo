        "text": "Essential Info\n\nIs this trip for you?\n\nThis trip has been rated Activity Level 2 (Easy & Moderate). For more information on our trip gradings please visit our Activity Level Guidelines page. If you have any queries about the difficulty of the trip please do not hesitate to contact us.\n\nThis is a comprehensive itinerary, with a few relatively long days due to the distances we cover. It has been designed to give more time to visit the key sights compared to our nine-day Treasures of Sicily tour. There is a lot to see in Sicily and some of the days will feel busy; however, the overall pace will be relaxed and on most days there is free time to explore.\n\nAll transfers are by private air-conditioned minibus, allowing us to enjoy comfortable and flexible journeys. You will walk mostly in cities and towns; although not strenuous, the amount of walking on some days can be considerable.\n\nDue to traffic restrictions in a lot of the historic centres visited, you may have to carry your suitcase over cobbled pavements, although the bus will leave you as close as possible to your hotel.\n\nPlease also be aware that some hotels don’t have a lift, but local staff can help to take your luggage up and down the stairs. The Mount Etna excursion is on foot and we walk for up to two hours on hilly-to-steep terrain of dried lava, rocky ash and sand. A second walk will take place in Zingaro Nature Reserve, where we will walk for up to three hours (including stops) along idyllic Mediterranean coastline. Should you prefer not to join these walks, there is a café (Mount Etna) or seating area (Zingaro Nature Reserve) close to the trail where you can wait for the rest of the group.\n\nFollowing a review of all our trips we have categorised this trip as generally not suitable for persons of reduced mobility. However if you are a regular traveller on such trips, please contact customer services to discuss the trip and your personal condition.\n\nJoining Instructions\n\nKey information\n\nStart hotel: Dimora de Mauro, Via Gesualdo Clementi, 5, 95124 Catania CT\n\nPhone: +39 095 715 9270\n\nRecommended arrival time: You can arrive at any time today. There will be a welcome briefing in the evening, but if you miss it the leader will update you separately\n\nAirport: Catania Airport (CTA)\n\nGetting to the start hotel\n\nThe start hotel is approximately 20 minutes’ drive from the airport. Your options for this journey are:\n\nTake an Exodus transfer\n\nExodus provides one group arrival transfer from the airport, which is timed to coincide with the arrival of a chosen flight from London, UK. You may join this transfer at no extra cost, provided you can be at the airport before the transfer leaves. Speak to your sales representative for the group arrival transfer times or to arrange a private transfer.\n\nMake your own way\n\nYou can reach the start hotel relatively easily using taxis or public transport. A cab from the airport costs approximately €55-€60 and should take 20 minutes. Alternatively, you can catch the AMT Alibus to Piazza Stesicoro, which will cost €4 and takes 20 minutes, then it’s a about a 10-minute walk to the hotel. Tickets are sold at the bus ticket office in the arrivals hall, on board the bus from the driver, online and on AMT’s vending machines. On arrival at the hotel, please make the reception staff aware that you are part of an Exodus group and they will have more details on meeting with your leader and group.\n\nIf you would like further information on joining this trip, please speak to your sales representative.\n\nCatching your return flight\n\nThere’s a group departure transfer to the airport for customers who Exodus booked onto a chosen flight to London, UK. Please speak to your sales representative if you wish to join. If the group departure transfer does not suit your flight time, speak to your sales representative to arrange an alternative transfer.\n\nFull joining instructions including local emergency numbers will be sent to you as part of our Final Joining Instructions. If you do not receive these at least a week before departure, or require them earlier please contact our office or your travel agent.\n\nLocation start: Catania\n\nLocation end: Taormina\n\nVaccinations and Health\n\nItaly\n\nThere are no required vaccinations. However, you may want to consider vaccinations for tetanus, rabies and tick-borne encephalitis. Please confirm with your doctor or travel clinic.\n\nPassport\n\nRemember to check the expiration date of your passport if travelling internationally. Many countries require your passport to be valid for at least six months after the date of your scheduled return.\n\nVisa\n\nItaly\n\nTravellers from the UK, US and EU normally do not need a visa to enter Italy. Please note, visa requirements often change and it is your responsibility to obtain any required visas for this trip. Therefore, we recommend that you check with the nearest embassy or consulate of your chosen destination(s), including any countries you may be transiting or transferring through.\n\nSome local governments provide guidance on what visas their citizens need. To help, we’ve gathered a selection of useful links below.\n\n• Australia: www.smartraveller.gov.au/destinations/europe/italy\n\n• Canada: www.travel.gc.ca/destinations/italy\n\n• United Kingdom: www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/italy/entry-requirements\n\n• USA: www.travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Italy.html\n\nPlease note: it is compulsory to carry ID with you at all times in Italy.\n\nFood & Drink\n\nAll breakfasts and a wine tasting on Mount Etna included.\n\nSicilian cuisine is a mix of the different cultures that have existed on the island, from the Arabs to the Normans. The island itself is incredibly fertile, with a climate ideal for the cultivation of fresh produce, such as olives, oranges, lemons, aubergines (eggplants), tomatoes, pistachios, almonds, grapes and more – not to mention all the seafood, tuna and swordfish fished off the coast. The result? A fresh, varied and delicious cuisine.\n\nSicilian wines, including marsala and moscato, are superb and known to be strong and syrupy. During the trip, the leader can recommend the best restaurants and cafes. In the evening, they will often organise group dinners but participation is entirely optional.\n\nWeather\n\nSicily has a good year-round climate, with plenty of sunshine and warm/hot temperatures. Summer temperatures can reach 33C-38C (91F-100F). The earlier and later departures are likely to be cooler with a slightly higher chance of rain. In late summer, there is the possibility of heavy thunderstorms, but these are usually short-lived. Spring and autumn are cooler. Temperatures on Etna will be much lower than at sea level. With windy conditions, it can feel chilly or even cold at the top, so bring warm and windproof clothing.\n\nThree- and four-star hotels\n\nWe use three- and four-star hotels and occasionally B&Bs. Some were selected for their warm hospitality and typical Sicilian character and others for their location close to the historic centres we visit. Don’t forget your swimwear – some of the hotels have swimming pools.\n\nThe accommodations used on this trip are found on the day-to-day itinerary; however, below are a couple of the standout hotels.\n\nPiazza Armerina: Suite d’Autore (nights 6-7)\n\nFor something completely different, there’s Suite d’Autore. This art hotel in Piazza Armerina traces the history of design from the 20th century to today through its decor and displays. The rooms are, unsurprisingly, individual, while outside the front door is a honey-coloured cathedral.\n\nTaormina: Villa Esperia (night 14)\n\nOur final night is spent at Villa Esperia. Get the group together by the outdoor pool to toast the adventure and admire the sea views. Alternatively, a cable car to Taormina town centre is just 330ft (100m) from the front door. The hotel also has one restaurant: Bacio di Dama, which serves Sicilian dishes."
