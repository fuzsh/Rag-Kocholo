        "text": "An enchanting vacation package, visiting some destinations in Italy! Experience Sicily, the old-world, idyllic island with a rich and unique culture. Sicily has plenty to see and do and this flexible vacation package highlights Palermo (notorious for its mafia glamour, but that aside, uncover forgotten treasures in its museums and wander through its packed outdoor markets), Agrigento (home to Valley of the Temples with the best preserved Greek ruins outside Greece itself), Siracusa (a former stronghold of the Greek empire; full of medieval and Baroque buildings) and Taormina (perched on the edge of a cliff overlooking the Ionian Sea; a draw for writers and intellectuals for decades). This is a flexible vacation package. Select your number of nights in each city, desired hotel, rental car and activities.\n\nItaly\n\nFor centuries Italy has drawn foreign visitors - mostly for its architectural, artistic, and scenic splendors. Italy can truly be all things to all people. From the passion and excitement of noisy urban crowds to the quiet, rural idyll where the traditional life can be experienced. Italy's great cities are replete with rich attractions and culture alongside some of the most pristine beaches and spectacular mountains in the world."
