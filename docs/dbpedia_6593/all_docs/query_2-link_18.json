        "text": "During our first Sicily road trip, we drove the perimeter of the island and some of its interior over the span of a month; it's little surprise we fell head over heels with it.\n\nYet, even with the luxury of that amount time, we still had to jettison several highlights of eastern Sicily, including Syracuse and Ortigia. Although it would have been possible to include them on our route then, simply spending all our time moving and driving and zipping through some stunning destinations is not our travel style.\n\nTherefore, at the tailend of our seven-week Italian trip last year, we were at a backstreet bar determining where to go after Naples; the late summer sun on this particular adventure was fading and falling south, and we weren't keen to let it go with the prospect of a long British winter ahead of us.\n\nAn earlier than expected return to Sicily was the clear winner, and this allowed us to focus solely on the areas of the island's east coast which we chose to miss out on the previous year.\n\nMore importantly, it finally allowed us to curate this east Sicily itinerary for you lovely people!\n\nThis route will bring you to several of our favourite things to do in Sicily: the crazy fish market in Catania; sunbathing on the rocks in Ortigia; exploration of several honey-hued baroque towns; Roman amphitheatres and Greek temples; wild and not-so-wild beaches on the south-east coast; Montalbano locations and several UNESCO World Heritage sights; a bunch of amazing foodie stops; time on Europe's most active volcano.\n\n(oh, and there's ample time baked in for spontaneous fun, sun, rest, dolce vita, and serendipity).\n\nWe have structured it as a manageable and realistic 14-day east Sicily itinerary, but it's fully adaptable if you only have a week to 10 days and we've clearly highlighted where and how to adapt it. Rather than just list a number of places in eastern Sicily, we've curated a defined route which you can realistically follow and, most importantly, enjoy.\n\nThis is the itinerary we'd do if flying into Catania, based on our own experiences and travel style, and we've designed it to enable you can make the most of the places we loved the most, but also go at the slower, immersive pace at which we like to travel (after all, there really is no fun to be had in just moving on each day and being in the car more often than anywhere else on your holiday!).\n\nThis is our east coast Sicily itinerary for independent travellers.\n\nA FEW THINGS TO KNOW FIRST...\n\nAs we mention in our Sicily road trip post, where the focus is on western Sicily, it's really important not to feel you can complete all of Sicily in the space of 7 to 14 days. Trying to drive or travel the east and west sections of the island in that window will not be enjoyable, and isn't terribly practically either.\n\nThat's why it's best to focus on travelling deeper in just the east or west, and to not regret that you won't be able to visit each and every place that looks amazing on the island - instead, simply savour that you're able to travel in Sicily for any time at all.\n\nWe're not going to go into too much depth in this post, as we've linked to our specific destinations guides for everywhere we're sending you. However, we'd strongly encourage you to also read three other posts whilst you're in the planning stage for Sicily or choosing whether to focus on the western and eastern side:\n\n1. This Is Our Perfect Sicily Road Trip Itinerary\n\n2. 15 Things To Know Before Driving in Sicily\n\n3. 23 Things To Know Before You Visit Sicily (published soon)\n\nThey contain all the tips, advice, and information that we didn't want to duplicate here.\n\nThis Sicily itinerary starts and ends in Catania, which is the principal entrypoint for trips on the east coast (if you're flying into Palermo, it makes more sense to follow this route).\n\nThe two main decisions you have to make from there are:\n\n1. Whether to spend any time in the city of Catania.\n\n2. Whether to go north or south first.\n\nThere's no right answer to the above, and it does depend on your travel style and the sorts of experiences you wish to focus on. Have no desire to be in a city? Then don't go to Catania (though it's got quite a bit going for it). However, if you're flying in late in the day, then it makes sense to probably have a night and day there to settle in, and possibly take the opportunity to use it as a base from which to visit Mount Etna or do other day trips.\n\nThe north / south question is completely down to you, and won't make a huge difference. In the eastern Sicily itinerary below, we've put you south first as it's got more destinations clustered together, and makes logistical sense - it's what we'd do.\n\nIf you're only in Sicily for a week, we'd suggest focussing simply on that south east corner of the island - if visiting for 10 or 14 days, you can then choose to go further west to the Valley of the Temples or shoot up north to cover a few other places, like Taormina. Again we've explained this a little more in the relevant section.\n\nWe never want to be too prescriptive so that every person on an eastern Sicily trip ends up following the exact same route!\n\nRENTAL CAR, TRAIN, OR BUS?\n\nWe firmly believe that Sicily is best explored with a rental car.\n\nIt gives you flexibility, the ability to go more off-the-beaten-track, and a great level of independence.\n\nHowever, we appreciate that driving in Sicily will no be everyone's cup of tea due to its reputation, or that renting a car may not be possible for everyone.\n\n(before making your mind up though, make sure to read this post: 15 Things To Know Before Driving in Sicily)\n\nDue to this, this itinerary is suitable for those using public transport, which is actually relatively good in the south east corner of the island, as well as those on a road trip\n\nIf you are choosing to travel Sicily principally by public transport, that's great from a sustainability and slow travel perspective. There are a few things to be aware of in advance though:\n\n1. The trains in Sicily aren't as efficient or regular as mainland Italy. They're still the best option for certain journeys, but don't be surprised if the journey you want to make isn't necessarily covered or direct.\n\nView schedules and book tickets via Trenitalia, and take a read of our train travel in Italy tips at some point too.\n\n2. The bus is actually the most reliable, quicker, and convenient option for getting between most places on this itinerary - local company Interbus are the best, and you can easily view their schedules and book tickets on their website. Alternatively, Omio is worth a look.\n\n3. You will be able to easily follow this itinerary, especially for the first six or seven days, but may have to sacrifice a few experiences and less accessible spots due to dependence upon transport schedules and routes.\n\n4. Taking a day tour for one or two experiences will be essential and much more convenient for you if trying to cover more in a short space of time or to go from one side of eastern Sicily to an attraction 2+ hours away by public transport.\n\nRoad trippers face a different set of issues, but we've outlined those in 15 Things To Know Before Driving in Sicily.\n\nIf youâ€™d like to get an idea on rental prices and availability for your dates, we recommend looking + booking via AutoEurope or Rentalcars.com.\n\nOUR EAST coast SICILY ITINERARY | DAY BY DAY\n\nDAY ONE | FLY INTO CATANIA\n\nThe second largest city on the island, and the main gateway for the east coast, Catania is an underrated destination.\n\nIt isn't as pretty as Palermo in the north, with a little more grit amongst the black lava walls. However, Catania's chaotic morning fish market is legendary, it's the home of pasta alla norma, a little bit hipster, and showcases an enjoyable contrast to the daintier, more elegant coastal destinations you'll visit on the rest of this itinerary.\n\nCatania is also the best place from which to find tours to several popular spots in eastern Sicily so, if you're short on time, consider a longer stay in order to see more of Sicily from there, before moving south to Syracuse.\n\n//DRIVE & TRANSPORT\n\nFrom Catania Fontanarossa Airport, also known as Aeroporto Internazionale Vincenzo Bellini, take the regular AMT â€˜ALIBUSâ€™ shuttle bus (â‚¬4 per person, 20 minutes).\n\nSince March 2021, thereâ€™s also a train connection between the airport and the city. Alternatively, this private transfer has good reviews and is actually really well priced if thereâ€™s a couple of you.\n\nIf this east Sicily adventure is going to be a road trip, weâ€™d actually recommend not picking up your rental car straight away. Parking will be really challenging and driving in and out of the city isn't the best introduction to Sicily's drivers...plus you won't really need it for the city itself.\n\nInstead, take the bus in, enjoy a car-free day or two, then go and pick it up once you're ready to move on. It is also possible to rent cars in Syrcause, but prices are a little higher.\n\nWe recommend searching viaRentalCars to get really cheap deals and reading this post '9 Essential Car Rental Tips for Travellers' to save a lot of money and stress.\n\n//STAY\n\nWe had several nights at this Airbnb - nothing remarkable but well-located, affordable, and functional.\n\nOther great options include the stunning and quirky Asmundo di Gisira or Zahara (still stunning but more budget friendly) or TRIPonTOP, one of our favourite Airbnbs.\n\nWe've shared more recommendations for you in our guide to Catania.\n\n//PLAN\n\nFind out the best things to do in Catania in our guide: 13 Wonderful Things To Do In Catania.\n\nDAY THREE | TRAVEL TO SYRACUSE\n\nSetting off after breakfast, youâ€™ll head south to the ancient - and impeccably beautiful - city of Syracuse, your base for the next two nights. Founded more than 2,500 years ago by the Corintihans, it is home to Ancient Greek ruins, honey-coloured medieval streets and the bluest blues of the Ionian Sea.\n\nPerhaps somewhat confusingly, the city of Syracuse is actually made up of two popular tourist destinations: Syracuse (the newer city which is also home to the Greek Parco Archeologico della Neapolis) and the island of Ortigia (the stunningly atmospheric old town), and youâ€™ll have time on this itinerary to visit both.\n\nIt is also well-situated for a variety of day trips to several lovely spots elsewhere on the coast too.\n\nWhether youâ€™re arriving in Syracuse by car or public transport, you should have time after lunch for a little bit of sightseeing. The island of Ortigia is relatively small, the perfect size in fact to explore in an afternoon; simply follow your nose, stop in at beautiful churches, grab a drink overlooking a the sea and get lost in its ancient streets.\n\n//DRIVE & TRANSPORT\n\nFor those of you driving, this is the morning when youâ€™ll need to pick up your rental car, either from the airport, or alternatively there are a number of well known rental agencies just north of the city, in the Borgo-Sanzio neighbourhood. There are also options to hire your rental in Syracuse.\n\nWant to get an idea on prices? We recommend searching for a rental car on AutoEurope or Rentalcars.com.\n\nOnce you have collected your vehicle, Syracuse is a straightforward drive south, and will take about an hour.\n\nInterbus has hourly departures to Syracuse from Catania. Journey time is 80 minutes and tickets cost â‚¬6.40. You can find timetables and book in advance here.\n\nAlternatively, there is a regular train service from Catania Centrale which takes between 80 minutes and two hours depending upon the service.\n\nNote that the final bus stop and Siracusa train station is a good 20-minute walk away from the centre of Ortigia, but the Siracusa Dâ€™Amare electric bus (â‚¬1 for 90 minutes) does a regular shuttle loop from there over the bridges and around the island.\n\n//STAY\n\nWhilst there are bountiful accommodation options in both the old and new town, for this trip, weâ€™d highly recommend you base yourself in the heart of Ortigia. Although Syracuse has a number of tourist attractions, the historical centre is by far the prettiest part and the area that youâ€™ll want to spend the majority of your time.\n\nHowever, because of limitations on non-local traffic, those with a vehicle may struggle with parking in Ortigia and Syracuse may prove more convenient (especially if you want to do day trips).\n\nWe stayed in this stylish Airbnb in Syracuse, which included free bicycles, but there are much more romantic and atmospheric options available and they're included in our destination guide.\n\n//PLAN\n\nWe've shared all our favourite things to do, plus more accommodation and restaurant recommendations in our guide to Syracuse & Ortigia.\n\nDAY FOUR | Relax in Ortigia\n\nGiven the layout of this twin-city, it makes sense to separate out each dayâ€™s activities geographically. And, having spent the last couple of days in a relatively large city, today is the perfect time to relax and go slow.\n\nHave a breakfast of cappuccino and cornetto, pop your head into the fabulously authentic local market, then make your way to one of the temporary lidos that pop up along the shore during the summer months. On a bit of a budget? Donâ€™t worry, there are free sunbathing spots at the small free beach or - as we much preferred - on the rocks with the locals!\n\nYou can find our top swimming and sun spots in our guide to Syracuse and Ortigia.\n\nIn the evening, grab a sunset drink and dinner at one of the cityâ€™s excellent restaurants.\n\n//DRIVE & Transport\n\nYouâ€™re vehicle free today - enjoy it!\n\n//STAy\n\nAlthough we were very happy to base ourselves in Syracuse, the vast majority of the tourist accommodation is located on the island of Ortigia. Weâ€™ve given a full breakdown in our guide, but a few of our favourites include:\n\nFind luxury, elegance a little bit of quirk at Hotel Henry's House, beautiful contemporary design at a mid-range price point at CalamÃ¹rn Ortigia, or excellent value charm at Hotel Gutkowski.\n\nIf youâ€™d prefer your own space, there are literally hundreds of listings to choose from, but start with our favourite Airbnb or this lovely apartemnt.\n\n//PLAN\n\nOur travel guide to Syracuse, Sicily & The Island of Ortigia\n\nDAY FIVE | SYRACUSE\n\nThis morning will be spent exploring the Greek ruins of Parco Archeologico della Neapolis. An open-air museum of sorts, it hosts a jumble of complexes and constructions including the 5th century BC Teatro Greco. Given the summer temperatures, weâ€™d recommend beginning your explorations nice and early to avoid the worst of the heat.\n\nTickets for the Neapolis can be purchased in-person at the siteâ€™s ticket office or alternatively buy a skip-the-line entry ticket here.\n\nItâ€™s also possible to join a guided group tour of the site - this one is well priced and has good reviews.\n\nAfter you can either wander a little deeper into Syracuse (we recommend the San Giovanni Catacombs and Basilica Santuario Madonna delle Lacrime) or make your way back to Ortigia.\n\nConsider taking a short boat trip out in the afternoon/early evening to enjoy a dip and a different vantage point. You can arrange this in person at the harbour, or alternatively book this super popular two-hour option in advance.\n\nAlternatively, if the thought of trudging around ancient ruins and old crypts doesnâ€™t really excite you, you could use this day to take the car and head out to a few places for beachtime, swimming, and lunch with a sea breeze. A few to put in your map are: Spiaggia di Fontane Bianche, Lido Arenella (not free), and Plemmirio Nature Reserve.\n\n//DRIVE & transport\n\nItâ€™s around a half hour walk from Ortigia to the ruins, or alternatively you can jump on the Siracusa Dâ€™Amare (a tourist shuttle bus, â‚¬1). Bicycle rental is also a popular thing to do here and is a viable alternative.\n\nShould you want to head out to the beaches, having a car will make things much, much easier. There are however bus connections to a few spots along the coast, but your best bet will be to just pick one place for the day rather than trying to spread yourself too thinly.\n\n//STAY\n\nWhere you stayed last night.\n\n//PLAN\n\nWe've shared more advice on the coastal area and beaches in the guide to Syracuse and the Island of Ortigia.\n\nDAY SIX | DRIVE TO NOTO & ENJOY\n\nAnother day, another stunning Sicilian town. This time itâ€™s Noto, a place that epitomises the look of 'Sicilian Baroque', the highly regarded architectural style which flourished as entire cities and towns in the south east were reborn following the devastating earthquake of 1693.\n\nIndeed, the beauty resulting from that tragedy is the reason that eight places in the Val di Noto region - including Catania - are protected UNESCO World Heritage sites.\n\nNone, however, are more beautiful than Noto.\n\nSo perfect and so elegant is its historical centre, itâ€™s somewhat easy to forget that this is a place where people live, and not a museum or some eerily accurate film set.\n\nThe late Baroque town of Noto is only a 45-minute drive from Syracuse, but you'd be missing out if you chose to just drop in and out; not only is it stunning with a lovely atmosphere in the evening, Noto is also an ideal place from which to explore lesser-visited spots on the south east coastline.\n\nTherefore, it's your next stop for three nights.\n\n//DRIVE & TRANSPORT\n\nAn easy travel day, with Noto just 45 minutes or so from Syracuse by car and 30 minutes by the regular train.\n\n//STAY\n\nThere's a lovely selection of small B&Bs, boutique hotels and Airbnbs in Noto. We stayed in this apartment, run by the most wonderful family.\n\nIf youâ€™re looking to splurge on a little luxury, we can highly recommend Gagliardi Boutique Hotel whilst two personal favourites of ours are Welcome Garden and Filinona B&B. Alternatively, B&B Novecento Siciliano is a great value option.\n\nOur Noto guide has more picks for all budgets and travel style, or alternatively take a look at our post on the â€˜Best Airbnbs in Notoâ€™.\n\n//PLAN\n\nFind out more about Noto, plus our picks for accommodation and the best things to do there, in our 'Essential Guide to Noto'\n\nDAY SEVEN | EXPLORE NOTO & THE COAST\n\nToday we recommend setting off early with the car to explore some highlights of the east coast of Sicily.\n\nChoose to base yourself at one spot for the day, or make it a mini-road trip to find your own favourite spot: a few of ours to put in your map are Spiaggia di Calamosche and Marianelli, lunch in Marzamemi, Avola, or a decadent day at one of the manylido / beach clubs.\n\nLinger long until the sunset, or head back for golden hour drinking and dining back in Noto.\n\n//DRIVE & TRANSPORT\n\nThe rental car will pay for itself today as you go from little cove to sandy beach, pretty fishing port to wild beaches down dusty roads. It is actually possible to hire a car from Noto, so if youâ€™re travelling with public transport but don't want t be limited, you may well wish to consider doing this.\n\nIf not, then you're defnitely going to be more restricted today (and for most other days when based in Noto). There are buses to various points along the coast though, so our advice is to pick one and spend the day there.\n\n//STAY\n\nWherever you stayed last night.\n\n//PLAN\n\nTravel guide to Noto\n\nWhere To Find The Very Best Beaches in Sicily\n\nThe Art of The Italian Lido\n\n//KNOW\n\nIf you're in eastern Sicily for 7 days, then you may wish to sacrifice this day in order to drive to Ragusa and Modica (see next section). Movements should be based around your flight time and the 2-3 hour drive back to Catania Airport from Ragusa, or the 1-hour drive to it from Noto.\n\nEnding your week with a day at the beach rather than in another baroque town may be exactly what you want to do though!\n\nDAY EIGHT | Take a Day Trip to Ragusa &/or Modica\n\nIf Noto is the jewel in the Val di Noto crown, then Ragusa and Modica are the glittering diamonds either side of it, with Modica famous for its chocolates, and Ragusa for its regular feature in the Sicilian TV drama, Inspector Montalbano.\n\nThey're only 25 minutes from eachother, with a similar story to tell in terms of stunning post-earthquake architecture and layout.\n\nGiven their proximity, if you have your own vehicle, we recommend setting off early and visiting both towns. If you are relying on public transport however, you will need to pick which one youâ€™d prefer to explore.\n\n//DRIVE & TRANSPORT\n\nIt's about an hour's drive from Noto to Ragusa, and 45 minutes to Modica.\n\nThere are good train connections between Ragusa and Noto (90 minutes). The train station is located in Ragusaâ€™s new town, from which you can jump on one of the local AST buses to the historic centre. Alternatively, there are regular buses from Noto with AST.\n\nThe route between Noto and Modica is a little quicker (train takes an hour, bus around 80 minutes) which may be the deciding factor for those who want to limit their time stuck on public transport.\n\nFor train timetables, as well as the option to book tickets in advance, see Trenitalia, and be sure to read 12 Tips for Train Travel in Italy.\n\n//STAY\n\nWherever you stayed last night in Noto\n\n//PLAN\n\nA Short Guide To Ragusa | The City of Two Halves\n\nA Short Guide to Modica | Home of Sicily's Best Chocolate\n\n//KNOW\n\nIf you're only in Sicily for 10 days, then you may only wish to visit Ragusa & Modica for a few hours each before driving up to Taormina today (2 hours / 146 km).\n\nDAY nine | Drive West towards Agrigento\n\nOkay, first things first.\n\nIf youâ€™re travelling around eastern Sicily with public transport, this is where youâ€™ll have to deviate from this itinerary. Although trains and buses connect many places along the north, east and west coasts, getting south is not straight forward and very time consuming.\n\nTherefore, weâ€™d recommend skipping forward to â€˜Day Elevenâ€™ and heading from Noto to Taormina / Aci Trezza / Aci Castello instead. This itinerary can then either become a 10-day itinerary, or you can chuck on a couple of extra days elsewhere to round it up to the full two weeks.\n\nRight, now weâ€™ve got that sorted, time to head to the south coast - in search of spectacular beaches, and Sicilyâ€™s most impressive Greek ruins - the Valley of the Temples.\n\nItâ€™s a three-hour drive to Agrigento, so be sure to set off early from Noto to make the most of your day.\n\nYou could theoretically visit the Temples in the afternoon, but given that it requires a lot of walking in the sun, weâ€™d advise saving them until tomorrow and instead either explore Agrigento, check out some of the nearby beaches or - if you donâ€™t mind jumping back in the car again - drive over to the wild and windswept Torre Salsa. Many of the beaches and swimming spots weâ€™ve mentioned in this itinerary are, understandably, very busy in the summer months, so the beaches of Torre Salsa (a protected and undeveloped nature reserve) will offer a pleasant respite.\n\n//DRIVE & TRANSPORT\n\nWith the car, it's about a three-hour drive toward Agrigento, the town next to the Valley of the Temples.\n\nDo note that upon placing â€˜Agrigentoâ€™ as your destination into Google Maps, it will automatically place you on a route that goes via Catania, then down and across. Due to the highway, this is absolutely the fastest route, but it sort of defeats the point of a circular road trip! That, and the slower coastal and countryside road from Noto is really quite lovely.\n\n//STAY\n\nStay in Agrigento, or use this as an opportunity to stay for two nights in a random small Sicilian town, a countryside retreat, or beautiful property by the sea. That's the sort of experience travelling slowly with a rental car offers up, so take advantage of it!\n\nAccommodation in Agrigento | If youâ€™d like a guesthouse, we recommend La Terrazza di Empedocle or Camere a Sud, whereas for those that prefer staying in an Airbnb, our two top picks are Casuzza di Girgenti and La terrazza di Zia Maria.\n\nOutside of Agrigento | Take a look at Masseria Torre Saracena, B&B A Robba de Pupi and Antico Borgo dei Templi.\n\n//PLAN\n\n7 Things To Know Before You Visit The Valley of The Temples\n\nA Short Guide to Torre Salsa\n\nDAY eleven | Heading back towards Taormina\n\nYou have a decent drive ahead of you today (2.5 - 3.5 hours depending upon the route you take), so weâ€™d recommend setting off nice and early.\n\nThe popular hilltop town of Taormina wasn't our favourite place in east Sicily, but it is undoubtedly adored by many. It's certainly very pretty, in a gorgeous setting overlooking the sea, and has much history and culture to explore - it's just that, for us, we found the cruise ship groups a little overwhelming.\n\nHowever, it isn't a bad place to end your trip, and it's a perfect location from which to visit Mount Etna independently or with a tour, as well as do a number of other fun day trips.\n\nAn alternative base to consider for independent travellers with a car is Aci Castello and Aci Trezza, from which you can drive to Taormina and Etna on day trips.\n\nIf you took our advice, youâ€™ll have the entire afternoon to explore today, so take this time to familiarise yourself with the town: head up to Chiesa Madonna della Rocca for incredible views, discover Taormina from the sea on this coastline boat tour, step back in time at the Greek Amphitheatre (you can book your skip-the-line ticket to here), get lost in the old town or join a food and wine walking tour.\n\n//DRIVE\n\nIt's a 3-hour / 214 km drive from Agrigento to Taormina.\n\n//STAY\n\nTaorminaâ€™s popularity as a tourist destination means there is an abundance of accommodation options including San Domenico Palace, of White Loutus fame!.\n\nFor those of us that donâ€™t have movie star budgets however, we can recommend Hotel Villa Belvedere for true luxury, Casa Andrea for a charming, historical centre experience - or if youâ€™d prefer your own space, our favourite Airbnb.\n\nNote that you don't have to stay in Taormina.\n\nThere are a bunch of fancy hotels and hideaways in the vicinity, as well as plenty options by the sea down in Giardini Naxos, so consider finding somewhere more memorable or relaxing for your final nights.\n\n//PLAN\n\nHow To Spend A Day (Or More) In Taormina\n\nDAY Twelve | Visit Mount ETNA\n\nIf you chose to explore more of Catania during the first few days of your trip, today is the day that youâ€™ll get to visit Mount Etna, one of the worldâ€™s most active volcanos! We promise you, itâ€™s something you donâ€™t want to miss.\n\nIf youâ€™ve got your own vehicle, youâ€™ll have a few more options for excursions (or even the option to visit completely independently) but if youâ€™re relying on public transport donâ€™t worry - thereâ€™s plenty of tours that will take you straight from Taormina.\n\nwe recommend this tour (itâ€™s the one we did) if youâ€™re able to drive to the foot of the volcano\n\nor this super popular option if you require hotel pick-up from Taormina\n\nYou can find out more about visiting and hiking Mount Etna in our complete guide.\n\nAlternatively, you could opt to explore the Etna wine region, head out on a Godfather tour.\n\n//Drive & Transport\n\nItâ€™s just over an hourâ€™s drive from Taormina to Etna but, given the quality of the roads, if you have to be there for a certain time, weâ€™d recommend heading off with plenty to spare.\n\nThere is public transport to Etna, but itâ€™s not ideal. See our guide for further details.\n\n//STAY\n\nWherever you stayed last night.\n\n//Plan\n\nVisting Mount Etna | Everything You Need To Know\n\nHow To Spend A Day (Or More) In Taormina\n\nDay thirteen | Chill Out at the Beach\n\nThis is your final full day in Sicily, so obviously we think you should spend it at a beach, relaxing, topping up your tan, and taking long languid dips in the crystal blue Ionian sea.\n\nIf youâ€™ve based yourself in Taormina, this means heading down to Giardini Naxos/Isola Bella, and possibly taking a wee boat trip for a spot of snorkelling (or even a sailing trip to the Aeolian islands)\n\nAlternatively, if you chose to stay in Aci Trezza/Aci Castello, weâ€™d opt for one of the fancier lidos (all the details are in our guide) for an indulgent few hours in the sun.\n\nOh and absolutely donâ€™t forget to eat as much parmigiana di melanzane as you can manage, gorge on lemon granita, indulge in a final brioche stuffed with gelato, sip several espressi whilst people watching and savour all you've come to love about eastern Sicily.\n\n//Drive & Transport\n\nToday really sinâ€™t about jumping on a bus or in the car, instead pick a nearby beach and if possible, just walk there.\n\n//Stay\n\nWherever you stayed last night.\n\n// PLAN\n\nOur Guide To Aci Castello & Aci Trezza\n\nDAY FOURTEEN | FLY HOME FROM CATANIA\n\nAnd that, fellow travellers, is a wrap!\n\nWe know it's a lot to take in at once, but hope weâ€™ve given you plenty of clear inspiration and information to help you plan you eastern Sicily adventure!\n\nIf you've found it useful, then we'd love if you could follow us over on Instagram (@alongdustyroads), and feel free to spread the word to any travellers you know.\n\nFor more tips and advice to help you prepare, scroll down to the bottom of the page to find a bunch of our Sicily guides - or go straight to our Sicily page.\n\nOr if you just want to go straight to the inspo, then go to 13 Wonderful Things To Do in Sicily!"
