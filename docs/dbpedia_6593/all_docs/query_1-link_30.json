        "text": "Salemi is ranked as one of Italy’s most beautiful villages. But residents seem prouder of one Risorgimento episode in which their town’s role often gets glossed over.\n\nAlicudi, a tiny island in the Aeolian archipelago, has been in the headlines recently for its goat giveaway scheme, but the demand for cuddly “capre” has now outpaced the supply. We’ve flagged five welfare-minded farms worth visiting if you aren’t quite ready to raise a “kid.”\n\nLooming over the gateway to the island of Ortigia and its Porto Piccolo, the Ortea Palace pays homage to Syracuse’s layer-cake past with its glossy, Neoclassical-meets-Art Nouveau sensibility.\n\nSaffron, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg and cloves — combined with dried fruit and tomatoes — make this Sicilian dish incredibly flavorful. But what you really want to get right is the chicken crust.\n\nThis wintry pork ragù from the Sicilian province of Enna gets its richness from chocolate, but a touch of cinnamon and a dash of dessert wine make it extra aromatic.\n\nAlmondy shortbread domes filled with custard and topped with icing, these classic Sicilian sweets were first created in the 1800s at the Monastero di Santa Maria dell Vergini in Palermo.\n\nGood morning\n\nI am looking for someone to help me with tracing my Sicilian ancestors (Messina, circa 1815!) and I was wondering if anyone has had any experience with professional genealogists in the area and could possibly recommend anyone please?\n\nMany thanks\n\nWe have bought a house in Sicily and i have been told we need to replace our roof tiles because of a law coming in. i have searched the internet and cant find a law, so wondered if anyone could help me. Could it be that we have asbestos roof tiles?"
