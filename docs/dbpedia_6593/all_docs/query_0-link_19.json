The last three concerts before the August break.\n\n31 July: Palmanova\n\nThe beautiful star-shaped city, with a polygonal plan with nine points, a fortified military citadel, in ancient times surrounded by walls, or rather bastions, and turrets or “armors” at the corners, truly remarkable.\n\nNELLE TUE MANI\n\nNESSUN DORMA\n\nSUCCEDE\n\nAMOR VIDA DE MI VIDA (Piero)\n\nALMENO TU NELL’UNIVERSO (Ignaazio)\n\nLA CURA (Gianluca)\n\nYou all heard the unrest that occurred in Venezuela after the elections and before the song Hallelujah Ignazio made this beautiful and sweet dedication:\n\n“If you allow me this evening I would like to personally dedicate this next song to everything that is happening in Venezuela, now you know that for me it is family (applause) and not all information reaches the world and this next song is for them, for those who have suffered , for those who are suffering, and for those who have unfortunately already left us, we would like to invite you to turn on your cell phone flashes because who knows, maybe they are seeing us from up there.”\n\nIn response, Michelle published this photo with this dedication:\n\n“Thank you my love @ignazioboschetto for dedicating this song and raising your voice for our Venezuela!!!”\n\nAnd now a delightful moment in the company of Olivia who brings us a sweet smile. 😍\n\nGRANDE AMORE final piece\n\nThe regional news TG Friuli Venezia Giulia also talked about the concert (activate subtitles)\n\nsome photos\n\nAugust 3: MONTE CARLO\n\nThe concert will be held in the beautiful Salle Des Etoiles.\n\nThe concert will be opened by Lara Ferrari, an Italian singer who posted the photo with this dedication:\n\n“It was a great emotion to open the beautiful Il Volo concert in the splendid Salle Des Ètoiles of the prestigious Sporting Club Monte Carlo with my big brothers Sugarpie & The Candymen.\n\nThanks guys for the photo and the chat!”\n\nDinner is also provided for the public present and we all know that the Monte Carlo public is perhaps a little more demanding than the public that crowds out the various concerts, but I can say, after seeing the various videos that the public certainly appreciated the great skill singing and entertaining by Piero, Ignazio and Gianluca!\n\nMY WAY\n\nCAN’T HELP FALLING IN LOVE (Gianluca)\n\nFUNICULÌ FUNICULÀ\n\nsome moments\n\nCLICK HERE to view the video\n\nAugust 5: TORRE DEL LAGO PUCCINI\n\nAnd here we are back on Italian soil and precisely in Tuscany, in Torre del Lago, where Puccini was born.\n\nHere too, as throughout the tour, great success with the public.\n\nWHO WANTS TO LIVE FOREVER\n\nSUCCEDE\n\nCLICK HERE to watch SUCCEDE\n\nHALLELUJAH\n\nCAPOLAVORO\n\nSE TELEFONANDO\n\nAD ASTRA\n\nCLICK HERE to view AD ASTRA\n\nHERE’S TO YOU\n\nA nice collage of photos on FRAMMENTI DI UNIVERSO, thanks Margherita!\n\nCLICK HERE to see the collage\n\nAnd this is it for the last three concerts before the two-week summer break, it resumes on August 24th with the concert in MONOPOLI (Bari).\n\nBut the news doesn’t end here, because Il Volo has announced new dates that it will hold in January in the sports halls in Italy, here they are:\n\nSo the concert program in Italy intensifies long before leaving to come to you in the US. 😉\n\nBut this is not the only news. 😉\n\nA Sicilian city: Agrigento (which is also the province where Piero lives), is a candidate to be the Capital of Culture next year and therefore to promote the event they thought of filming a nice concert by Il Volo in the beautiful Valle dei Temples and exactly in front of the Temple of Concordia. This project has taken shape and the concert is scheduled for August 31st. Since the square contains few people, around 500, and the video is sponsored by the Municipality of Agrigento and therefore free, entry by invitation was considered and Il Volo therefore sent an email to those registered in the fan club to invite them to sign up. this opportunity. It’s truly a beautiful gift for anyone who can be present at this concert!!\n\nTemple of Concordia\n\nAnd this is the email that went to all the fan club members.\n\nBut, do you remember that Il Volo said they were going to film a PBS special filmed in Egypt with the pyramids? Unfortunately, the very tense situation in the Middle East caused this beautiful event to be cancelled.\n\nIt is also thought that this event in Agrigento could also be used for the PBS special, but this is not yet confirmed.\n\nThe Agrigento Notizie newspaper talks about two concerts, one on August 31st and the other on September 1st. It is also thought that this event in Agrigento could also be used for the PBS special, but also for the Canale 5 Christmas special, but these two latest news has not yet been confirmed, so we will follow developments.\n\nHere is the article from Agrigento Notizie:\n\nCLICK HERE to view the Agrigento Notizie article\n\nConcert of Il Volo in the Valley of the Temples, 2 dates: it remains to be clarified who will be able to attend.\n\nWith the regional decree of recent days, the bureaucratic procedures are unblocked for an event that will be more advertising than musical.\n\nThe first details of one of the “highlight” events of the city’s preparation for the year of capital of culture 2025 are starting to leak out, albeit informally: the Il Volo concert in the Valley of the Temples.\n\nAn initiative that will in all respects be more advertising than musical in itself, so much so that in the decree signed in recent days by the Sicilian Region, with which 500 thousand euros are allocated to support the event, it is linked to the promotion on TV between Italy and the United States. This is because the concert by Piero Barone, Ignazio Boschetto and Gianluca Ginoble will take place on two dates, August 31st and September 1st, in favor of cameras: a show will be filmed to then be broadcast on Mediaset channels during the Christmas period, The other one will be used for US TV.\n\nWhat still needs to be understood is whether and how it will be possible for the public to attend the concerts. The location, probably the esplanade in front of the Temple of Concordia, will not be able to accommodate more than 400 people and it is not yet known how they will be selected: the hypothesis of an invitation-only event is the most accredited, while it seems very unlikely that an initiative of this type could be open access.\n\nThe economic aspect also needs to be defined: if it is true that the decree approved in recent days allocates 500 thousand euros with funds from the cultural heritage department, the overall cost of the operation should exceed one million euros, with other resources coming from national and regional governments as well as the archaeological park.\n\nAnd this is all for the moment, I would say that our boys don’t have a moment of peace, I hope that at least in these very hot days of August they will be able to rest a little and regain their energy.\n\nMy Sicilian holiday went very well, I only went to Palermo and Cefalù. In Palermo I was staying right next to the Cathedral from where Il Volo sang on July 15th. From my bedroom window I could have seen them very well without even moving. It’s a shame that when I booked the days of my stay, nothing was known about this further commitment of Il Volo in Palermo.\n\nBut that’s okay, the important thing is to always have good and positive news from our beloved boys.\n\nSee you soon: Daniela 🤗\n\nCredit to owners of all photos and videos.\n\nA BUSY JULY by Daniela\n\n……..where were we? Even if it’s summer and it’s very hot, our boys can’t stand still for a minute.\n\nIn fact, the day after the Pooh concert, Saretto di Bambar publishes a video and a photo with Piero and Ignazio who are in Taormina.\n\nSaretto video – Click Here\n\nSARETTO = My friends, he was abstinent from slushes, now he has come for a few hours and ate…..\n\nPIERO= For a few minutes…. how many are 8?\n\nSARETTO= I think it’s 7 or 8 granitas.\n\nPIERO= 8 and a brioche.\n\nSARETTO= Bye guys!\n\nI was wondering why, maybe there was something we didn’t know anything about or was it just a quick trip back to Sicily?\n\nIn fact there was also a specific reason, a prize awarded to Piero.\n\nOn July 10, Piero collected the Ignazio Buttitta special prize, which is a prize for a literary competition, but as a special prize, it is also recognized for those who spread Sicilian art and culture.\n\nIt is an award established by the province of Agrigento, of which Piero belongs.\n\nAnd here is the video of the award delivery and the motivation.\n\nMOTIVATION = Pure singing talent, he gained international fame and popularity together with his travel companions : Il Volo.\n\nIn his short but intense career he has performed on the most prestigious stages in the world and has undertaken collaborations with the people of the musical firmament.\n\nHis singing ductility allows him to face any repertoire, from the more properly bel canto one, to pop.\n\nStrong musicality, desire to improve, mild and strong-willed character, in a perfect mix, make Piero Barone an extraordinary artist witness of the best Italian musical culture in the world, congratulations!!\n\nAnd here is Piero’s short answer:\n\nPiero’s short answer – Click Here\n\nSpecial Presidency Prize, Piero, you made truly extraordinary flights to be here tonight (evidently Piero managed to be present between one engagement and another).\n\nPIERO= I did it willingly, good evening everyone.\n\nIn recent years I have never taken any recognition for granted, I believe that every recognition, individual or collective, human, artistic, is always important. I’ve always thought that recognition ennobles success.\n\nBack to Sicily, I’m going home.\n\nPiero with a journalist.\n\nNow I’ll update you on the free event in Ascoli Piceno with the translation of this beautiful article.\n\nALL IN A LINE FOR IL VOLO\n\nPicene Chronicles article – Click Here\n\nASCOLI – The ticket office opened at 8 this morning. After 30 minutes the tickets were finished, and only the very long queue of those in possession of the precious “number” remained. Fans from out of town and even foreigners too. Some have spent the night in Piazza del Popolo in the loggias under the Palazzo dei Capitani. The countdown officially kicks off to attend the gift to the city of Battista Faraotti who celebrates the thirtieth anniversary of his Fainplast.\n\nAll lined up for “Il Volo”. This morning, Monday 10 July, at 8:00AM the distribution of tickets for the concert of the most famous trio in the world, scheduled for 21 July in Piazza del Popolo, began in Ascoli.\n\nA free concert, a “gift” to the city of Battista Faraotti who is celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of his company, Fainplast.\n\nAs was widely expected, the ticket office in Piazza del Popolo was stormed. There are those who even lay in wait during the night to earn a front row seat, even sleeping in their sleeping bags close to the Palazzo dei Capitani. Many people, even not very young, queued shortly after dawn.\n\nMany for hours under the scorching sun, including those who have come from outside the region and also several tourists. Two of them, Americans, managed to grab the ticket.\n\nAn man from Ascoli arrived very early in the square. There were already a few dozen people, and he then took the initiative to organize numbered slips of paper which he distributed to those present while waiting for the various procedures to begin: the arrival of the City workers with the barriers, the security, the Municipal Police and the State Police. All aimed at finally getting hold of the ticket.\n\nThe comings and goings of enthusiasts who don’t want to miss out on the most eagerly awaited event of the year are continuous, like a river in flood. Tickets sold out within half an hour. 600 tickets were distributed, considering that each person could take a maximum of two.\n\nThere are two women from Ascoli who managed to pocket the precious coupon. “For the love of Il Volo I’m here in the Piazza from 5:40AM, finally says Pacifico Mariotti, who arrives from Fabriano (province of Ancona).\n\n“I’ve been here since 6:00AM, I come from Montalto Marche and I’m in the company of two friends from Offida,” says Rosanna di Silvestre.\n\nAmong the hundreds of people in line, also the city councilor for commerce and sport Nico Stallone. “I arrived in Piazza del Popolo at 6:30AM and I already had 200 people in front of me. A first group of 280 people was made, then another. I had the pleasure of meeting the first person who arrived tonight”.\n\nOn July 12, Ignazio posted a nice photo of Budapest, will he be there for a short vacation?\n\nBut before evening, Gianluca also publishes a photo of leaving for Budapest.\n\nInstead Piero is with his family and publishes a photo with his brother and sister Mariagrazia who graduated.\n\nBut not even a day goes by and Piero has also flown to Budapest, what will there be? There is no event or concert at the moment.\n\nHere is the mystery revealed, a press conference in Budapest for the new concert on October 9 at the Budapest Arena.\n\nThe Hungarian singer with whom they will collaborate is also present at the conference: Gabi Toth.\n\nThese are her words:\n\nGreat honor for me that the world famous Italian opera singers pop trio formed a joint song.\n\nIl Volo October 9 – I will perform in the Arena and the concert will be previewed. 🙏🏻\n\nI look forward to working together as this is a new challenge and an exciting musical journey. 🙌\n\nAfter the press conference a nice and long interview was published of which I translated the most interesting questions and omitted the part where he describes Il Volo from its beginnings to today.\n\nIndex article – Click Here\n\nQUESTION= Let’s go back to the beginning. How do you remember your childhood, was your talent already manifested then?\n\nGIANLUCA: On behalf of all three of us I can say that we owe a lot of gratitude to our parents, who have believed in us from the beginning. I’m very happy because they always gave me the chance to show my talent and believed in me. I was never told what to do. This is the most important thing to support the emergence of the talent of a young man who is just trying to express himself. The main direction in my life was that I wanted to be a singer. It’s the one thing I’m good at that my parents recognized and helped me figure out who I really am.\n\nQUESTION= Your career started in a talent show where you competed individually. What do you think of the current talent scouts?\n\nGIANLUCA: Sometimes I have the feeling that the singers in the TV show are just part of a big machine. It’s not easy to find new talent every year or even every month, and only a very small percentage of them manage to unleash their talent. It’s like they sacrifice everything on the altar of quality. That’s why it’s very important that singers who want to be famous try to express themselves as much as possible. A strong personality is essential, which is not easy to find, but social networks and TV shows are also based on it. I think there are a lot of talented people in the world, they just do something different. It’s also important to be able to plan ahead, and talent is useless if you don’t know how to use it. Just getting bad advice from someone and you can already be lost. This is why many still do not know how to express themselves.\n\nQUESTION= It has become obvious in the search for talent that opera is closest to you. Why did you choose this genre?\n\nPIERO= Actually our genre isn’t even opera. The pieces we perform are all part of Italian culture, interpreted in recent years by singers such as Luciano Pavarotti and many others who have brought these compositions from the theater and brought them to the public. They are traditional songs known all over the world, and perhaps people confuse them with opera due to the powerful sounds, even if it is bel canto. To hear an opera you have to go to the theatre. However, our program does include some opera pieces, including La Traviata and Nessun Dorma. Whoever comes to the Budapest show will feel as if they were in Italy for one night, it will be a trip through the last 14 years. In addition to Italian sheet music, we have previously covered American compositions as well, including My Way. Our most characteristic song is Grande Amore, with which we had the opportunity to represent Italy at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2015.\n\nQUESTION= You mentioned the Eurovision Song Contest. You took part in the competition in 2015, where you finished in third place. What memories do you have of this period?\n\nPIERO= In Italy the only way to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest and represent the country is to win the most famous festival, the Sanremo Festival. Thanks to this, we also managed to enter the competition in 2015 with the song Grande Amore , as we won the festival with it. At that time, the Eurovision Song Contest in Italy was not as well known as it is now, but we have good memories of it. The passion with which every interpreter displays the flag of his nation. We had the best time of our lives then, because overall our only goal was to represent Italy, as we felt the love and support of our nation.\n\nQUESTION = In 2021, another Italian band, Maneskin, won the competition. In the history of Eurovision, they managed to do it for the third time among Italians. Did it mean a lot to you that an Italian band finally won?\n\nPIERO = We were happy that Italy could finally win and host the next Eurovision. In fact, we were invited as guests to Turin to perform that evening. We performed another English version of Grande Amore and believe me, seeing the Eurovision Song Contest in Italy gave a completely different feeling of freedom.\n\nQUESTION= It’s already official that you will duet with the singer Gabi Tóth at the concert in Budapest, why was she chosen?\n\nPIERO= It was introduced to us via Spotify, because when we travel to certain countries, we like to collaborate with artists there. We got to her with the help of an agency and we liked her. If only because a great experience connects us. She has also performed in front of Pope Francis which is quite amazing. When we first met, we had a chance to talk a bit and it became obvious what feelings drive all of us.\n\nQUESTION = In 2021 you sang in honor of Ennio Morricone in a concert, and then you released an album in his memory. What did that composer mean to you?\n\nPIERO= He has done a lot for our culture, he is an icon and we all grew up listening to his songs. While many people may not know at first when they hear a song that he composed, we’re also talking about an Oscar-winning artist. As Italians, we are very proud that he was also Italian, and we want to thank his family for believing in us for this project, as well as we are grateful for his melodies, which fill us with emotion when we hear them on stage.\n\nQUESTION= Most singers and musicians have some sort of mission through music. What is your main motivation?\n\nGIANLUCA= Next year we will celebrate our 15th anniversary and we have created a very strong show. In addition to songs belonging to our culture, we have already sung Smile by Charlie Chaplin with Barbra Streisand, among others, but currently our goal is to have our own repertoire and be able to sing for our generation as well. This is a very difficult challenge, but we strive to achieve it with our new songs. We are already thinking about the distant future and let’s imagine the next 15-20-30 years together.\n\nQUESTION= Among the younger generation, music genres like r’n’b or pop are considered mainstream these days. How can you make them fall in love with bel canto?\n\nGIANLUCA= We are young too and we love this music. We have different audiences in different parts of the world, for example in South America 80% of people belong to our generation. It all depends on the country we are talking about. In Japan and Europe, for example, we are mostly listened to by adults. The goal is to make good songs, because if we do that, people will listen to our music.\n\nQUESTION = You have already proved yourself to Hungarian fans in 2018 and 2019. What is your experience with this audience?\n\nGIANLUCA= Hungary was one of the first places we went after the Eurovision Song Contest. We were constantly on the road and playing concerts. It was very touching to see the arenas full even outside of Italy and to experience the love we received from the Hungarian audience.\n\nQUESTION= As mentioned above, during your career you have performed duets with, among others, Barbara Streisand. Who else is left out of the line-up you would like to work with?\n\nGIANLUCA= We never know who life will bring us together with, and we can also mix different musical genres. We have achieved so much in our career so far and now a new chapter begins as we want to bring our music to an even bigger audience. This is one of our goals.\n\nQUESTION= Do you have other role models?\n\nPIERO= Hans Zimmer, is one of the most brilliant composers.\n\nQUESTION= Is there an artist whose career you would like to have?\n\nIGNAZIO= Ourselves.\n\nPIERO= There was a singer in Italy who was asked who he wanted to be, and he replied: myself, the best form of myself.\n\nGIANLUCA= You have to reach your goals and dream big, but at the same time you have to recognize your limits. It wouldn’t be true if I said I wanted to be like Michael Jackson. You have to realize that you have to give yourself in life, you have to believe in yourself and, as Piero said: you have to be the best. If I only express 60 percent of my being with my music, I have to think about how to reach 100 percent. This is what we stand for.\n\nAnd the second concert with POOH has also arrived, this time at the stadium in Rome.\n\nOnce again a good experience, they sang the same one song: Uomini Soli (lonely men).\n\nAt the beginning Ignazio says that he has studied the song well these days, otherwise Red gets angry.\n\nRed replies laughing that Ignazio is a scoundrel, because in the afternoon during rehearsals he pretended to get the song wrong and Red really thought he was wrong. And Ignazio says he does it on purpose to make Red angry!! 😁😁\n\nThis beautiful photo was posted by Red (he has a red jacket), with these words:\n\n“THOSE GOOD GUYS FROM IL VOLO –\n\nThey are like us, three different worlds, but which complement each other… they are kind and they are certainly very good. Singing with them was a real joy… and we also laughed and joked a lot… they are three little pests and Ignazio managed to deceive me, during rehearsals, by pretending to get the verse of Uomini Soli (lonely men) wrong and I fell for it like a pear tree… but there’s time… and I’ll do it again 🤣”\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\nBut there is yet another news, which Susan has already informed you about, it has been published that Il Volo will participate in the “match of the heart” a football match with a charity background, where the teams will be: Singers versus Artists.\n\nAnd here is the promo video, to advertise the match.\n\nIt’s always a wonderful initiative, and with a very honorable goal, but I wonder how the guys will do, given that they have to be in Ascoli Piceno for the free concert the next day?\n\nLet’s hope they let them play in the first half.\n\nLately they have been spinning like tops, they don’t have a moment of time for themselves and their families, in fact in this period there were also the birthdays of Ignazio’s mother and also of Gianluca’s father and Ignazio and Gianluca were in the company of their parents, just one day and that’s it, just like Piero just one day for his sister Mariagrazia’s feast.\n\nThe things they said in the interview in Hungary are really interesting, they are preparing big surprises for their 15-year career and different music that can also involve the youngest, but as Gianluca reiterated: “The goal is to make good songs, because if we do that, people will listen to our music.”\n\nSo don’t be afraid, Il Volo will not distort its nature, it will promote new beautiful music and of course it will always have its baggage of bel canto and opera that we all know well, I’m sure of it and I really hope they will succeed in their intent.❤\n\nBut July is not over yet and there are still many events, see you soon!!\n\nDaniela 🤗\n\nCredit to owners of all photos and videos.\n\nVOLO TOUR 2022: OSTUNI and AGRIGENTO by Daniela\n\nSlowly we arrived at the last two concerts in July:\n\nJuly 26: OSTUNI\n\nThe beautiful square of the Apulian town was waiting for Il Volo and welcomed them with great warmth.\n\nSE\n\nALL BY MYSELF\n\nAt the beginning of the video, Piero sees a woman holding a sign and tells Gianluca.\n\nPIERO = Read, read what is written.\n\nGIAN = (he reads) I have a (loving) relationship with Piero Barone but nobody knows, not even him.\n\nPIERO = Me neither! (laughs)\n\nGIAN = A platonic love.\n\nPIERO = (He reads another sign) I am from Finland and I love you. We love you too, how do you say I love you in Finnish?\n\nGIAN = (Reads another sign) I have a dream in my heart, singing with Gianluca, Ignazio and Piero Barone.\n\nWhy did you write the surname to Piero and not us (him and Ignazio)? Ah, to rhyme, I didn’t get there !!\n\nThen Piero talks about how they met and introduces Ignazio.\n\nIL MONDO and SE TELEFONANDO\n\n29 July, AGRIGENTO, the beautiful Valley of the Temples.\n\nIt goes without saying that Agrigento is the province where Piero lives and therefore there was a lot of emotion and participation.\n\nHere is Piero’s message before the concert.\n\nI am excited for the concert in the Valley of the Temples.\n\nI have been spending my holidays in San Leone for years and I love jogging here.\n\nIt’s great to see people stop me and tell me: “We got tickets. Piè (Piero, abbreviated), for the concert.” It fills me with pride.\n\nThis video was made by AGRIGENTO TODAY is a nice summary and I will translate the beautiful words of Piero.\n\nGIAN = (He says to Piero) You are at home tonight.\n\nPIERO = We are home. Sorry, but tell me something, but in Roseto, where you live, do you receive such a welcome? Let me understand! (applause).\n\nGIAN = (On the nearby promontory you can see the ruins of a Greek temple. Gian points to the temple and says):\n\nWhat house, is that your house?\n\nPIERO = From here you can see my bedroom, up there, see the one there.\n\n(Then Piero turns to the audience).\n\nBefore I took the stage, I looked at you, and I thought:\n\nI have never taken for granted such great affection, such great love, from my fellow countrymen. Thank you! ❤ (applause).\n\nI am, we are three extremely privileged guys, all thanks to you, for these 13 years of journey we have done together (applause).\n\nTonight we will sing the songs they have ….. (he sees Ignazio) but what happened? What are you doing back there? You speak, you do not speak, good evening …\n\nIGNAZIO = No, I was looking at what seems to be in the Po Valley, you can’t see anything (Pianura Padana is the Italian plain in the north, Ignazio means that the expanse of people is as big as the Po Valley, moreover there is it is often fog and nothing is seen and the effect of the stage lights does not show anything to the singers).\n\nPIERO = But in fact, turn off this talcum powder (type of diffused light), there are the ancient temples behind.\n\nIgnazio, why don’t you speak? Let me understand!\n\nIGNAZIO = I was thinking about something, if that’s your room (part of the temple), did you save on the fixtures? (Laughter)😁\n\nGIAN = Think in the winter that the air is blowing!\n\nIGNAZIO = In summer everything is fine, but in winter, you die of cold!\n\nGIAN = Then you don’t sing if you get a sore throat.\n\nPIERO = (he turns to Ignazio) Do you want to introduce? Are not you happy? I understand that we are not in Marsala, (Ignazio’s city), today we sing in Agrigento ….. (someone from the audience throws a small red pillow at Piero) thank goodness they are cushions but they are red like tomatoes …. ( then Piero reads on the pillow) … ah I LOVE YOU !! , thank you honey, thank you my love, hello joy.\n\n……….. we said that tonight we will sing the songs ………..\n\nIGNAZIO = And then I’m sorry, I think this is also the concept that we two (him and Piero) give, that it doesn’t matter Agrigento, Marsala, Catania, it’s all Sicily. (applause) These are things that an Abruzzese does not understand !!😁\n\nGIAN = I understand everything, I can speak in Sicilian with you (Gianluca pronounces all this in Sicilian) (applause)\n\nIGNAZIO = But I was saying an Abruzzese, not you Gianluca.\n\nGIAN = Shut up, don’t speak (Gianluca pronounces this again in Sicilian and then turns to the audience) Do you understand? huh !! (and gestures with his hand towards his ear which means that he is saying the Sicilian pronunciation well)\n\nIGNAZIO = May I?\n\nGIAN = You can, of course. I don’t mean to be rude.\n\nIGNAZIO = A Sicilian would never have said YOU CAN, ever! If you don’t talk, you don’t have to talk.\n\nGIAN = Go, I won’t interrupt you anymore, Mr. Boschetto.\n\nIGNAZIO = But I have nothing to say …\n\nPIERO = Tonight we will sing the songs that are part of our artistic path. We will also sing some songs that are part of our latest recording project, where we decided to dedicate an entire album to a great teacher, a great composer, maestro Ennio Morricone. (applause)\n\nSicilian friends also made pizza in honor of IL VOLO 😁\n\nHERE’S TO YOU – L’AMORE SI MUOVE – MUSICA CHE RESTA\n\nECSTASY OF GOLD\n\nNESSUN DORMA\n\nMany beautiful articles in Sicilian newspapers, but among all I chose this one and I translate it for you:\n\nTo view the article, CLICK HERE.\n\nIN VOLO WITH MY FRIENDS by Flavia Verde\n\nI am referring to the concert last night in the Valley of the Temples in Agrigento by the trio “Il Volo”. Why with my friends? Because they were there, among that public in delirium for these guys who embody, at least for those of our generation, the best you can have: beauty, professionalism, Sicilianity.\n\nFor personal reasons I could not participate, but it seems interesting to tell you their impressions, which I fully share, since more than once I have also had the pleasure of being there. The most celebrated was Piero Barone, and the community of Naro, massively present to support that boy who grew up “on hard bread and milk” and today at the top of international fame. Yes, because even if our children wrinkle their noses, we, these kids, we love them viscerally. Because after having done so much apprenticeship, they have touched the sky. And last night, the illuminated Temples served as a worthy backdrop to their exhibition.\n\n“Magic and familiarity.” – says Maria Luisa. Two components that accompany any of their performances, but above all the concerts in Sicily, in which we hear them tell episodes of their childhood, we listen to their dialectal expressions, we feel them deeply rooted in our island reality, so colorful and colorful, so proud of their success.\n\n“The word Agrigento unleashed a riot of festive screams,” Luisa tells me while now, Paola and Giuseppina tell me that it seemed to be in the family, for the confidential and empathic relationship they have created with the public. “It was a hymn to the beauty and harmony of Sicily – continues Luisa – happy people, families celebrating.”\n\nWell, after having seen the recent film “Elvis” and previously “Bohemian Rhapsody”, with the inevitable pitfalls that the entertainment world inevitably manifests, I must say that these three guys, who are also in the hands of a great manager like Michele Torpedine , they do not show anything artificial in their interpersonal relationship.“ They are authentically friends and brothers“- says Dina and, after years of international tours and sensational successes, they remain the three Sicilian guys we have always known. Their solid family roots, always remarked by them with pride, I hope they keep them away from the bad sirens that almost always dominate the entertainment world.\n\nAnd finally, thanks to my friends for their cooperation!\n\nIt was undoubtedly a concert full of emotion, but there is still an appointment for Il Volo and it is not part of the tour, Il Volo will open the MAGNA GRECIA Film Festival in Catanzaro, on July 30th.\n\nHere they are on the red carpet!!\n\nThey sang only three songs, Ecstasy of Gold, Grande Amore and Nessun Dorma, greeted by warm applause, and even if the songs were only three, the people of Catanzaro enjoyed the articles in the newspapers the next day very much and full of beautiful words.\n\nBut look at the professionalism of our treasures, during Grande Amore, Piero’s microphone no longer works and, without any problem, Ignazio approaches Piero and offers him his microphone, Gianluca understands the situation and is close to the other two to make it seem that the song should be sung by all three neighbors. A second microphone arrives for Piero, but this too does not work, and the three of them go on without any problem and finish their performance. Really great !!!\n\nDuring the Magna Grecia Film Festival, Michele Torpedine was awarded the Golden Column.\n\nBut also Il Volo was awarded with the Golden Column and it is the same goldsmith who made the prize to go up to deliver it. On his Facebook page Michele Affidato (goldsmith) writes this comment:\n\n“On our journey we meet many people … with some a true friendship is born. Thanks to Michele Torpedine and the Trio il Volo for their presence at the Magna Graecia Film Festival.”\n\nAs they receive the award, the speaker says these words:\n\n“To Il Volo, which makes us proud in the world with bel canto.”\n\nIl Volo is also rewarded with the Vela del Successo.\n\nSome moments of the beautiful evening.\n\nBeautiful events awaited our three golden boys at the end of July, but there is no time to rest, just one day at home to pack your bags, and then, off you go, Japan is waiting for you.\n\nHave a good trip, come back soon !!\n\nDaniela\n\nCredit to owners of all photos and videos.\n\nPiero Barone: Sicily for Peace by Daniela Perani\n\nOn March 19, at the Pirandello Theater in Agrigento, an event in favor of peace in Ukraine was held. It was called, SICILY FOR PEACE.\n\nPiero Barone took part in this event.\n\nThe event was organized by Silvio Schembri, (journalist) and Lello Analfino (singer and producer), both friends of Piero.\n\nWhen Piero was proposed to participate, he wasn’t sure if he would be in Sicily on those days, but then when he was sure he could be there, he surprised everyone by attending the event.\n\nThe video begins with Silvio Schembri coming down from the stage and arriving where Piero Barone is seated.\n\nSilvio makes Piero get up and the people, recognizing him, applaud, then Silvio, imitating the voice of a woman who says:\n\n“Did you see, I told you it was him,”😁😁\n\nand then presents: “PIERO BARONE, there is no need for an introduction.”(applause)\n\nCome with me. (Piero takes off his jacket) Make yourself comfortable.\n\nPIERO: Tonight, I am really happy, honored, to be attending this event. I was fascinated by the Pirandello Theater, because I had never been inside the Pirandello Theater.\n\nSILVIO: This is news that I discovered today, Piero Barone who sang on the most important stages in the world ……\n\nMAN: You went directly to the Ariston (Sanremo stage) without going through the Pirandello Theater, we can say.\n\nPIERO: I realized that it is something that I should have done for some time, because today I arrived 100 meters from the theater and I asked a woman for information:\n\n“Madam, where is the Pirandello Theater?” and she replied:\n\n“You are not Sicilian.” (laughter)😁\n\n“Yes, but unfortunately I don’t know where it is.”\n\nSILVIO: There was never an opportunity, but who knows, maybe this is the first of a long series of occasions.\n\n(on the stairs of the stage)\n\nAnd here we are, moreover you tour New York, Las Vegas, all parts of the world, but always in Naro, then you come back.\n\nVOICE: (from the audience) Bravo, Naro in the heart !!❤\n\nPIERO: A little while ago I was saying, while I was doing the interview with Silvio…. (There is the overview of the theater, but the interview returns in the backstage)\n\nMAN: The truth is that you like Agrigento so much, when you can live it, we have seen you around, on the seafront, at the tennis club, in short, when you want, Agrigento is your life.\n\nPIERO: Agrigento makes you feel protected, it is a fantastic city. I was born in this magnificent province, I was born in Naro, but I often frequent Agrigento in the summer, I bring all my friends and collaborators to Sicily, I make them all arrive.\n\n(continues on the stairs)\n\nIn the city of Agrigento, I don’t know many people, because I frequented it (Agrigento) for the choir of S. Cecilia (as a child, before participating in Ti Lascio una Canzone), when I was a beginner, with Professor Bonfiglio, I spent my childhood there.\n\nSILVIO: Then at 14 you decided to become famous … right? (laughter)😁\n\nPIERO: But I spend my holidays in San Leone (a seaside resort near Agrigento), it’s great, I take all my friends, my colleagues, I don’t go anywhere, they arrive here in Sicily …\n\nSILVIO: Every now and then you also come to Siculiana Marina … (another seaside resort of Agrigento) 😁\n\nPIERO: Because the best thing is to feel yourself. Today I called Silvio, but not only for this event, but also to ask him where we are going tomorrow, because the first phone call I make when I come to Sicily is to call Silvio Schembri (Silvio gives him a kiss …. applause and laughter)\n\nSILVIO: Because he knows that I always take him to eat well, that you understand!! 😁\n\nPIERO: Two weeks ago, Lello (organizer of the event) sent me a message, and I was far away (he was in the US), and I didn’t know what to answer, I would have said yes right away, but I don’t want to give a word, and then invent an excuse if I have a sudden commitment, because unfortunately I am here physically almost never, and now I am overjoyed to give my contribution. I don’t sing, without my colleagues (Gian and Ignazio), for various reasons, so today I called Ignazio and Gianluca and I told them:\n\n“Any video you will see from tomorrow on the internet, don’t worry, I’ll sing in a theater, don’t worry”, and I’ll sing, we call it a song…. I want to sing a prayer, because everyone can come here and sing any song, but for an evening like this, I want to sing something special, an Ave Maria (Hail Mary) and it’s the only one way, for my part, to express my closeness, in such a complex and particular moment. (applause)❤\n\n(The Ave Maria begins.)\n\nMAN: Thanks to both of you, thanks to Silvio Schembri, thanks to Piero Barone, for what you are giving this evening to the Pirandello Theater, for the solidarity operation you are carrying out and which is not the first time, I also remember when the pandemic broke out, you took an important step.\n\nSILVIO: With the help of many people who are also here, like Lello Analfino and Piero, in the midst of the pandemic, in the first wave, we immediately activated, with many other friends, to find funds.\n\nPIERO: The idea was born during our phone calls: “Oh Silvio, what do we do?”\n\nSILVIO: At the beginning of the pandemic our talks were about how to cook bread and pizzas, then we said: “But what can we do? Are we doing something concrete?”\n\nThanks to all of you.\n\n(video resumes on stage)\n\nLELLO: Piero Barone (hug) You are my nephews. ❤❤\n\nAnd here is the full video of Piero’s entire performance, published by the Pirandello Theater.\n\nSILVIO: I’ve dreamed of it for a lifetime (to introduce Piero) and tonight I have to do it myself: On the piano Maestro Salvatore Galante (applause), sings Piero Barone. (Applause – the Ave Maria begins, at the end, long applause, Lello Analfino enters, very excited, long hugs)\n\nLELLO: You are like my nephews.\n\nSILVIO: Yes, uncle, leave us some money later. (laughter)😁(To Piero) We talked about it before, now the concerts start again, the travels, the theaters full …..\n\nPIERO: Yes, we start again on June 2nd after two years, in Italy, we start from the Verona Arena, we will also sing in Taormina, June 11th and 12th and maybe …..\n\nSILVIO: .…. also, in other parts of Sicily, so to speak. Taormina is a fixed stop for Il Volo, as if it were a tradition …\n\nPIERO: He is happy, because when he comes to Taormina, then we go to the disco.\n\nLELLO: I know, he (Silvio) tells me crazy things.\n\nPIERO: The last photo of the concert in Taormina ….\n\nSILVIO: Be careful what you say there are so many secrets …\n\nPIERO: …… it is not a photo of Il Volo on the stage singing, with Etna behind and the sea, but it is a photo of Silvio Schembri in the disco, without a shirt ….😁😁\n\nLELLO: But did you have a bow tie?\n\nSILVIO: I’ll explain why. We were in this disco, after the Il Volo concert, and all the girls were saying: “a photo”, Piero lifts his shirt and shows his abs and I thought, I can do this too …. and then I said: “Come here a second and I too will take off my shirt and take the picture, and the (the girls) came”😁\n\nBut one of the most beautiful things in Taormina, we tell this and then we let you go, it is a fixed stop, when I can, I always go there, and one of the fixed stops when Il Volo sings in Taormina, is Saretto al Bambar where we eat granite there in Taormina.\n\nAnd when Il Volo arrives in Taormina, you can’t imagine what’s there, it’s all full, with their fans who come from all over the world, you hear them speak in all languages, and go inside the Bambar to get the slushes, with all these people, it’s packed, and so I pull away for a moment and put myself behind to let the fans get closer.\n\nI put myself in a trajectory between Il Volo and two elderly people who were there eating the granita…. (while he talks he sees a woman in the audience laughing) “You already know this story madam? Already laughing?”😁\n\nAt one point the man stops eating and calls the waiter and asks: “Excuse me, this whole brothel (crowd of people)”\n\n“You know, there are those from Il Volo.”\n\nThis man turns around and the first person he sees is me, he turns around and says to his wife: “How much has this become of Il Volo?”(he means: how much fat has this of Il Volo become)😁\n\nI swear to you! 😁😁😁 It’s a true story !!\n\nLELLO: And don’t you know that since Silvio goes to Bambar, they have made seafood granita😁\n\nSILVIO: Piero, I don’t know what to say, thank you, thank you in my name and in everyone’s name.\n\nfinal greetings\n\nIt was a really good event and for a good cause.\n\nIn these days, Il Volo was live on a pop program of a Korean radio show. I saw them live and it was very strange, because that radio transmits very different music from the one Il Volo sings, but it was beautiful and also appreciated by the young presenter.\n\nHere is the video of Il Volo’s participation.\n\nConcert dates continue to be added here in Europe and also in Italy and it is with great joy that the date of BRESCIA has also been added. I couldn’t believe it, and the news came from OHIO (thanks Rose Marie). The concert will take place on September 2nd outdoors in the beautiful Piazza Loggia, the place where in 2015 I saw my first Il Volo concert.\n\nI struggled a lot to get the tickets, something didn’t work in the presale, but in the end I made it, third row. I hope I can make some great videos for you, ideally I will take all of you with me!! It will be a great night.❤\n\nDaniela"
