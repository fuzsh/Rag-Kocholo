The staff are very kind and make you feel at home, while the view of Isola Bella is stunning. The food here is as authentic as it gets for a very reasonable price, and the portions are huge. Try the mussels cooked in garlic or the spaghetti with clams.",

But this time I changed my principles and ate only in this restaurant because it did not disappoint and the dishes made me enjoy the whole menu. the food and atmosphere were fantastic! Thanks to the Giovanni family and the waiters! Also, the pistachio cake was delicious!"
