        "text": "I want to talk you about the just passed summer holiday spent in Sicily, the heart where I was born.\n\nAs usual I have spent some time with my family to relax first, and after I organized a “Sicilian tour”, as I like to call it....and I promise you that I have been really satisfied about it. As I had just few days, I only went in the south-oriental side of the island.\n\nFirst of all in Agrigento. I had already visited this city with my family when I was just a child, and discovering it again with my boyfriend after many years has been to me such a pleasurable experience. In fact I really care to describe all my trip there: I stayed in a really nice b&b, from which you could see all the Agrigento city and especially the road Sacra Valle dei Templi, such an amazing view.\n\nI had the pleasure to visit La Valle dei Templi during the night, the night situation gave to the valley such a suggestive and also a bit romantic atmosphere.\n\nFrom the pictures below you can see some of my shots: The Giunone temple and The Concordia temple or The Jupiter temple just to say some of them; an amazing archeological pathway which I would never get enough of looking at it! The so called “Gods Valley” is an example of ancient greatness. A masterpiece which gives amazing emotions through the years, since the V century b.c. During the day instead I sunbathed along the Realmonte coast, also known as “Scala dei Turchi” where you feel surrounded by the amazing white color of the stones.\n\nThis Agrigento coast piece in fact , is a rock wall right on the sea, today a really famous touristic attraction. This cliff is situated exactly between two beaches, also really beautiful, and which make this part of the coast really particular and the only one in the world. I must say that I really had some difficulties to get there, because to reach the place there is only one way by foot and it is few meters from the shoreline and so quite hard to walk,but once you get to the top you can enjoy an amazing view inside the blue of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nAfter having been at the beach I did a small tour in Girgenti, the historical city center of Agrigento : starting from the Main Street, via Atenea, you can walk through the most important churches of the city as San Lorenzo, Il Monastero di Santo Spirito, la Biblioteca Lucchesiana (definitely so important to see), the famous Pirandello theater, dedicated to the famous Sicilian playwright and also San Gerlando cathedral, who is the patron of the city. Agrigento has got such a charm : really small streets, small houses, monuments, it looks almost like a labyrinth. An historical walk inside the Bizantine and Baroque periods, which, I think, makes of Agrigento a small cultural coffer all to discover.\n\nThe day after I have been in Noto, which I heard about many times, as a beautiful place. Well, I think that “beautiful” is actually not enough for this city. It is not just beautiful, it’s also really delicate and elegant : it’s a gem. Well known as “Baroque capital” this Sicilian municipality, in the province of Siracusa, became UNESCO heritage. As soon as you get there, the first thing you notice is this light pink color of the local stone, which makes all the buildings of the city really typical.\n\nBetween squares and really small streets, amazing are the monuments you can across together with wonderful and imposing steps like the Don Nicolò cathedral one, the municipal symbol for excellence. Just in front of the cathedral you can see the City Hall well known as “Palazzo Ducezio”, which the architecture is inspired by the French buildings of the XVII century.\n\nMany are the churches and the buildings that you can visit there but I’ll talk you about my personal experience. As soon as I got there, in fact, I went, like a my friend had suggested me previously, to the famous Caffè di Sicilia just where the principal road of the city is, where I enjoyed an amazing almond granita with a brioche, and of course a little ricotta cannolo too.\n\nWalking on the principal road I got till Corrado Nicolaci street, betters known as the floral street: in fact this street is famous because there you can always find floral artists either from Genzano of from the place. At the end of this street there’s the amazing church of Montevergini; to the other side , instead, the well known Villa Dorata ( prince Nicolaci palace), particular for its balconies: in fact, I was actually really impressed by their amazing architecture and their baroque ornaments. Along this road you can also find many little restaurants where you can taste the local gastronomic specialities.\n\nThen, when sunset comes Noto becomes memorable... the dusk colors always become one thing with the light pink stone color, and so you enjoy such an amazing view.\n\nSo, what else could I say ? If you haven’t still visited it, this is obviously an opportunity you cannot lost!\n\nDeparting from Noto, I was going to reach Taormina but, before I did a fast visit in Marzamemi. This little village, fisherman’s port, is really enchanting.\n\nIn fact here you can find the famous Marzamemi Tonnara, dating back to the 1600 under the Spanish domination, when the principal activity was fishing, and still today practiced by many people here. For example, here is really well known the red tuna roe, which is handcrafted by some antiques methods of the Phoenician - Arab culture. It seems like entering in a small kingdom where, the colors, the light, the characteristic quietness of this place invade .... small houses, little windows, walls, you can breathe the sicily in every single corner; also the restaurants have such a sea charm and even through their simplicity they have so many details, which can assure you, you could be amazed!\n\nMarzamemi hasn’t got just a beautiful beach but also an historical city center, where many movies have been played, like , for example, SUD by Gabriele Salvadores.\n\nRegina Margherita square, situated in the historical city center, is amazing : here you can find the two churches dedicated to the patrons of the city, San Francesco di Paola, Villa Dorata palace and around the fisher-mans small houses; and also many restaurants which offer the topical local cuisine.\n\nThen in the square you can admire the famous Tonnara, which we talked about above, and which in the XIX century has been defined “ The best Tonnara of the kingdom” ( the two Sicily kingdom), from here we can reach the two natural ports, Fossa and Balata, really particular.\n\nThe entire village is pedestrian.\n\nMarzamemi is such a beautiful place, especially if you wanna find and enjoy some peace.\n\nAnd in the end the last stage of my short Sicilian tour has been Taormina. I had already visited it previously, but it always so beautiful to go back there.\n\nFrom the historical city center to the cableway to reach the Bella Island this city is one of the most important international touristic attractions. Known for its natural position on a hill 200 meters by the sea, Taormina has got beautiful landscapes and breathtaking monuments.\n\nThe principal road, really full of shops, is the street from where the entire center starts: from Porta Messina to Porta Catania is possible to reach the most important places of the city. For example San Pancrazio church or Santa Caterina baroque church in pink marble and Taormina stone; the Corvaja palace, from the Arab period instead. Here you cannot miss the Naumachie, really particular Roman buildings which are in a lateral street. Walking along the principal street you can reach the famous IX Aprile square: this square overlooks the sea, you can enjoy an amazing view from here. Here there are some of the most important churches; like San Giuseppe one, Sant' Agostino( today become a library) and the clock tower.\n\nGoing on you will find the Duomo with the baroque fountain on the square and also many other important palaces, like Santo Stefano palace and Ciampoli.\n\nOnly walking you can go trough corners of such a beauty. After long walks I regenerated myself with a granita to the famous Taormina Bambar: a chèque of people outside the bar who can’t wait to seat and enjoy all the different granita flavors. A really typical place to try some regional foods.\n\nReally interesting is also this city landscape; a “balcony on the sea” which shows a beauty masterpiece.\n\nIn fact looking down the promontory you see many beaches; like the small Mazaro bay and Capo S' Andrea , known for their caves.\n\nBut the most typical Taormina symbol is the Isola Bella where I spent most of my time, enjoying the August sunshine. Known also as Mediterranean Pearl, the island is a natural reserve all to discover. The name was created by the Germaine W. Van Gloeden , who brought the artistic value of the island all over the world. The island history is actually really interesting and starts exactly in the 1806 and today it is part of the humanity heritage and it is called Riserva Naturale Orientata.\n\nHere you can admire not just an amazing sea but also such a breathtaking nature landscape. In fact after diving a bit and waking a bit along the sea I reached the little island , which you can visit buying a ticket from the Museo. Surrounded by a prosperous vegetation, it looks almost like exploring a sea garden , where between many different types of plants, flowers, and threes you can see a little house between the rocks, characterized by really picturesque walls and details. Such a human masterpiece in perfect harmony with the surrounding atmosphere giving a view of an amazing naturalistic museum."
