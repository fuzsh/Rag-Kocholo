        "text": "For Condé Nast Traveler's Iconic Itineraries, we partner with our travel specialists to create classic trips through our favorite destinations that showcase the difference it makes to travel with the help of an expert.\n\nTwo hours after arriving in Palermo, I am standing inside the Galleria degli Specchi at the Palazzo Gangi, beneath centuries-old chandeliers, surrounded by gilded everything. The mirrored walls and ceilings, the velvet curtains, the opulence of it all reminds me of Versailles's Hall of Mirrors. Like so much in Palermo, the 300-year-old palace appears suddenly and magnificently, rising up around the corner of a nondescript alleyway. Its low profile is fitting for a city where every wall holds millennia of conquests and scandal.\n\nPalermo's buildings carry the scars of World War II. But its doors reveal palaces still owned by princesses descended from the House of Bourbon, which ruled here from 1735 to the mid-19th century. Below ground, a network of tunnels has served as both a playground of sin for nuns and monks on trysts and as an escape route for the Beati Paoli, a precursor to the Mafia. It's a cunning, clever city that requires know-how to crack. Fortunately, I'm with Marcella Amato, a whip-smart, quick-tongued Palermitana guide with knowing eyes full of urban tales and wisdom. It is her long and trusted relationship with the princess who lives at Gangi that got me through the door. Being inside the palace is the first of many moments that brings me closer to Sicily than I have gotten on any previous trip.\n\nI'm traveling with Authentic Explorations, a specialist travel company run by Gary Portuesi in New York City. The son of Sicilian immigrants, Gary has spent the last two decades bringing Americans to Sicily and the boot on tailored itineraries that he designs after careful talks with would-be clients. Marcella is one in his army of specialized guides all over the island. When he and I started planning, I told him this would be my sixth trip to the island. That Palermo was important, but so were artisans and history and the southeast corner of the island, home to Noto and Ragusa, which I had never explored. He ended our call with the words “Be prepared for improv.”\n\nFor Thousands of years, Palermo was conquered and passed among the Phoenicians, Greeks, Arabs, Vandals, and Spanish before becoming the capital of Sicily under Norman rule, which joined Italy in the 19th century when it was united by the legendary general Giuseppe Garibaldi. Because of that history, cultures from the Middle East, Europe, and Africa have influenced everything from its food to its architecture to its dialect.\n\nAs the gateway to western Sicily, Palermo is where I spend my first two nights and where I meet for the first time with Peppe Mendola, Gary's business partner, who would serve as my driver, Sicilian encyclopedia, and dinner companion for the week. On our first full day, we hit the road early, driving along the coastal highway toward the seaside town of Trapani. It's a clear, mild late-September morning. As we get farther west, Palermo's industrialized suburbs, which sprawl along the hills and coastlines, begin to thin out. Our destination is the Trapani salt pans, which trace their origins to the arrival of the Phoenicians 2,700 years ago. Squint, and the silhouettes of Favignana and Levanzo, two of the three Egadi islands off western Sicily, are faint shadows against the blinding Mediterranean sunlight. I came here 10 years ago while road-tripping around Sicily with friends, so I'd told Gary I could pass this time around. But he kept it in the program, and I'm glad he did. On my last visit, I only glimpsed the pink and blue salt pools on the shoreline from the car window. But this time I learn that the salt pans are a window into artisan cultivation. That means a choreography of bare-chested men, in shorts and rubber boots, shoveling tidy piles of sea salt into wobbly wheelbarrows they roll across a shallow slick of water so dense with saline it looks like a sheet of ice until they reach a large mound at the edge of the pools. Peppe tells me kids don't come here looking to follow in their fathers' bootsteps. Due to economic and technological changes, these leather-skinned laborers, with their thick beards and faces hardened by a life's work in the sun, will probably be the last to follow this centuries-old practice.\n\n“I love improvisation!” says Peppe. It's roughly 10 a.m. on day three, and he and I have left our base in Palermo for eastern Sicily, driving through lush meadows with tall, windblown grasses stretching in every direction toward the horizon. In April and May, Peppe tells me, these fields are a profusion of wildflowers. Today we don't pass a single vehicle, which makes these seemingly endless expanses feel all the more elysian.\n\nPeppe tells me about a large extended family he brought here recently. After getting out of the car, the patriarch, who had left these valleys nearly 80 years earlier, fell to his knees to kiss the earth. Of the estimated 5.4 million Italians who emigrated to the United States in the three big immigration waves of the 20th century, roughly a quarter were Sicilian. That's translated into a decent chunk of hereditary travel business for Gary and Peppe, who are masters at reconstructing a Sicilian American's origin story with very little information. (“Give me a name and a date of birth and I'll find the house they were born in,” Peppe says.)\n\nOur destination is Agrigento, off Sicily's southern coast, Peppe's hometown and the site of an ancient architectural wonder known as the Valley of the Temples. But Peppe scratches his improv itch and makes a few detours—to the spellbinding Cretto di Burri di Gibellina, an art project to preserve a town in these valleys destroyed by an earthquake; the chic seaside village of Sciacca; and the famed Scala dei Turchi, a natural marvel of white stone cliffs seemingly sliding into the sea.\n\nExploring Sicily means a lot of time in the car. There is no way around it. A regional high-speed rail service has been long discussed for the island, but never realized. On our drives, Peppe and I chat about everything from the gusty sirocco winds that blow in from the south to the humanitarian aid the Sicilian government has offered migrants who arrive on these shores from northern Africa. Peppe tells me an apocryphal legend that has been circulating in the area since the end of World War II: that ties between the Sicilian Mob and the United States were once so strong, the infamous gangster Lucky Luciano helped coordinate the Allies' arrival on the island. Outside Palermo, Peppe points out the spot where, in 1992, an assassin triggered the bomb that killed anti-Mafia judge Giovanni Falcone, whose death marked a turning point in Sicily's war against organized crime. When I ask if Sicilians prefer to avoid discussing such topics, Peppe replies, “To not talk about how life was under the Mafia wouldn't be fair to those who died trying to change it.”\n\nThe Valley of the Temples sits atop a hill, unobstructed and glorious, like the world's most magnificent welcome sign. For the past 2,500 years, visitors to Agrigento, from conquerors on horseback to journalists in Audis, have looked up at the seven Doric temples, built by the Greeks, and known they have arrived. As a boy, Peppe would play hide-and-seek behind the towering pillars. Today, entry is controlled and the monuments are roped off. In the late afternoon, I meet Lorenzo, a 42-year-old Agrigentino who has been guiding since the age of seven, when he insisted on giving his parents a tour of the Valley after learning about it in elementary school. We are at the base of the Temple of Juno, at the Valley's western end. As we walk its path, passing the Temple of Zeus and Hercules, Lorenzo explains that this area was selected by the Greeks for its strong bedrock, which could support these colossal houses for their gods. He tells me of the Arab influence on Agrigento and talks about Sicily as the original melting pot. We arrive at the towering Temple of the Concordia, the Valley's best-preserved and most awesome monument, just as the setting sun turns the sky into a swirl of neon pink, backlighting the temple with an otherworldly glow. I realize then that Lorenzo timed everything so that I would hit this spot at this very moment. It's the kind of experience that exposes your insignificance in this powerful old world.\n\nIn the days that follow, we cover equally great distances and historical depths as we drive the southern coast before curving up east. In the Old Town of Siracusa, located on Ortigia, on an island connected by two bridges to the main town, I observe a wedding in a synagogue in the town's Jewish ghetto. I also speak with one of the last remaining makers of I Pupi Siciliani, a type of puppet popular in theaters throughout the island during the 1800s, whose venues and art form are protected by UNESCO as an intangible cultural inheritance. In the beautiful village of Noto, I stroll past its 18th-century cathedral after the sun goes down, the streetlamps coating the Baroque town in a dreamy amber hue. In nearby Modica, I taste the reach of the Spanish Empire in the local chocolate, made by techniques plucked from the Aztecs and brought here 400 years ago. Twenty-five minutes away, in Ragusa, the petite Maria Guastella, one of the last remaining makers of traditional sfilato siciliano, or Sicilian lace, talks me through her intricate craft. Her studio is on a hairpin turn on the road into the town, with a sign so discreet you would already have to know to come here to notice it at all. Inside, she demonstrates with crooked fingers that navigate the needle and thread with the nimbleness of someone 50 years younger. I stay longer than planned, purchasing her bookmarks and place mats to take home with me.\n\nIn the main piazza, Peppe ushers me across the broad flagstones of the sloping Old Town, passing regal cathedrals until we reach a door under a swinging wooden sign that says “Rosso Cinabro.” It is the last remaining workshop of the Sicilian carrettieri, or cart makers. While I was with Maria, Peppe arranged for the studio, which is normally closed in the afternoons, to remain open for me. To step inside is to step back two centuries in time. The wood is whittled by hand, and the wagons, which were ubiquitous up until the 1950s, are painted in shades of brilliant red, yellow, and blue, in patterns as distinct as fingerprints.\n\nOn my last full day, I wake up in Taormina, on Sicily's east coast, and tiptoe into the sea as the sun rises and the town sleeps. A few fishermen have rowed out just beyond the rock line, and the water is calm and as clear as glass. On a good day, you can see mighty Etna, the smoking volcano that could destroy much of the area's centuries-old antiquities in minutes. By the grace of all the gods who have been worshipped on this island, Etna's destruction has so far been largely contained to the mountainside. A bonus from the centuries of lava flows is the alluvial, mineral-­dense soil, which over the last few decades has captured the attention of some of Italy's top winemakers. Later that afternoon, I'm on the flank of the volcano, in a modern glass-and-timber tasting room at Cottanera Winery. Sipping Nerello Mascalese on leather sofas with views of the vineyards tumbling down the mountain slope, I see a different side of Sicily, the beginning of something new.\n\nYet change doesn't always mean an end to what was here before. In the crumbling hilltop village of Motta Camastra, which clings stubbornly like a mountain goat to the cliffs north of Etna, a group of local women is taking preservation into its own hands. Urban migration and economic downturn have hit the village hard. To create jobs and bring people back, Mariangela Curro and other local women launched Le Mamme del Borgo, which is creating a super-local farmed-food movement to help sustain the town agriculturally, and offering good old-fashioned cooking to bring in travelers. Mariangela is a cheery and proud ambassador, guiding me to the local museum where antique olive presses are displayed and to the town square, which looks over the valley and across to Etna. We climb a footpath and duck through a door that leads to a kitchen. Inside, the Mammas, in aprons and house dresses, are frying arancini, molding eggplant parmigiana, and stuffing crescent-shaped pastry with ricotta. Typical Sicilian food is their currency; every tour with the Mammas ends at the table outside this kitchen, under the shade of a canopy in an ivy-draped courtyard.\n\nThe meal is the kind of experience a traveler could book an entire trip around, bridging sustainability, local interactions, and extremely good food. At the lunch table, between platters of pasta alla Norma, sausage, and stewed greens, Mariangela explains the mission of the Mammas. Sicily is nothing if not a study in endurance and evolution, having inherited, fostered, grown, and preserved influences from so many forces throughout history to create a place unlike anywhere else. But Sicily's magic is knowing when to let change in. For the Mammas, change is intertwined with conservation. If done properly, their work will help to keep Motta Ca­mastra ticking.\n\nMariangela clears the lunch dishes and offers coffee. Peppe and I should get going. But under that canopy, surrounded by these women, on top of a valley that's been inhabited in one way or another for thousands of years, time seems to move at its own pace. We don't need to rush. So we stay at the table a little longer.\n\nHow this trip was made\n\nWhen Gary Portuesi of Authentic Explorations and I first talked, I made it clear that I wanted to be wowed by Sicily as though I were experiencing the island for the first time. He asked careful questions about my travels in Italy (extensive) and general preferences (cities over nature; culture and food; honest local connections). We then workshopped an itinerary, including places to stay, that aligned with my passions. His itinerary left plenty of room for flexibility, which, as a traveler who does not like to hyperschedule my days, I greatly appreciated. (I recommend you do the same if traveling to Sicily; there are so many directions the island can pull you in once you're there.) Gary's connections secured me hard-to-come-by rooms at sophisticated new retreats, like the grand Villa Igiea, A Rocco Forte Hotel, and San Domenico Palace, Taormina, A Four Seasons Hotel. He also brought me to boutique and family-run places, such as Fontes Episcopi, a dream of an agriturismo outside Agrigento that I never could have found on my own.\n\nThe highlights\n\nDay 1: A lunchtime stroll through Capo Market, a lesser-visited food market in Palermo, which ended in my first and one of my favorite meals of the trip—a mound of local anelletti al forno from a small vendor and a bottle of Menabrea beer.\n\nDay 3: After visiting the Trapani salt pans we drove up to the hilltop town of Erice. When I told Peppe that I had always wanted to taste the pastries of the legendary Maria Grammatica, who popularized certain types of sweets from this part of Sicily, he walked into a pastry shop and invited me into its kitchen where I got to chat with her in person—she even gave me a book about her life to take home.\n\nDay 4: A supremely delicious dinner of tri colore eggplant involtini on the outdoor terrace at the luxury restaurant at Villa Athena with views of an illuminated Valley of the Temples—though I would have eaten anything that my hosts at eco-retreat Fontes Episcopi might have served me from the farm kitchen.\n\nDay 5: A tour through the Catania fish market. The place was rollicking and wild and there were some lovely modern wine bars and bistros for lunch right next to the stalls. Just don't wear clean white shoes—you'll probably step in tuna guts.\n\nDay 6: Climbing over a hardened lava field on Etna before switching gears for a wine tasting later that day.\n\nWhere I stayed\n\nGary’s connections to exactly the types of the places you want to stay secured me the top rooms all over the island. In Palermo, I stayed at the Villa Igiea in Palermo, Rocco Forte’s new and stunning takeover of a storied turn-of-the-century resort right on the water. Over in Agrigento, the sweet eco-retreat Fontes Episcopi may have left the biggest impression on me, with its orchards and pinch-yourself-perfect farm kitchen where all the meals are made. Across in Noto, Seven Rooms is discreet and perfect, located in an old palace right off one of the main drags. Taormina has been popular for years and has the strongest hotel scene on the island.
