On Saturdays, the current hours that run from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. will thus be extended until midnight. The Castle is a symbol of the beauty of Taormina with four panoramas and breathtaking views. The first fortified construction probably dates back to the Byzantine age, representing for a long time one of the defense outposts in the war against the Arabs. From August 908 to 969 Taormina was subjected to three Saracen invasions, the last one, from 964 to 969, ended with a capitulation, and the territory of the island was divided into five administrative units: Taormina, Palermo, Messina , Syracuse and Trapani. The Normans liberated Taormina and besieged the castle in 1079. In 1134 the town was subjected to the monastery of San Salvatore della Placa near Francavilla di Sicilia. During the rule of Frederick II of Swabia the fortress was entrusted to a noble castellan.\n\nMore info and tickets: castelloditaormina.it\n\nEvents\n\nevery Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (21:15h)\n\nTeatro Nazarena – Via Fontana Vecchia, 3, Taormina\n\nItalian Opera Taormina.
