        "text": "Strictly Come Dancing is a British dance contest and TV show on UK BBC1 in which celebrities partner with professional dancers to compete in mainly ballroom and Latin dance. Each couple is scored by a panel of four judges. The format has been exported to sixty other countries. The Guinness World Records named Strictly Come Dancing to be the world's most successful reality shows in 2010. The show has a huge following and everyone has their own favourite dancer and judge.\n\nAnton Du Beke is a British ballroom and Latin dancer and television presenter, best known for being a judge on Strictly Come Dancing since the show began in 2004. I had the pleasure of meeting Anton a few years ago whilst working at the Brides Magazine Wedding Show in London and he was absolutely charming.\n\nGiovanni Pernice is a Sicilian professional dancer now based in the United Kingdom who is best known for appearances as a dance partner on the show. He was also an Italian Open Latin Dance Champion in 2012. Giovanni was born in Palermo. In 2021 he lifted the famous \"Glitter Ball Trophy\" in the nineteenth series of Strictly Come Dancing with UK actress Rose Ayling-Ellis best known for her character in the popular soap opera Eastenders. Rose was the first deaf contestant to appear on Strictly. The pair formed a special friendship on set and kept the British audiences entertained with their dancing and on screen chemistry with many avid Strictly fans hoping for romance but the pair have remained just good friends.\n\nWhen Giovanni first appeared on Strictly Come Dancing judge Anton Du Beke took him under his wing forming a wonderful \"Bromance\". Last summer the friends headed to Giovanni's homeland Sicily embarking on a road trip around the island. Over three episodes Giovanni shows Anton where he grew up and where he learned to dance in the TV show aptly named \"Anton and Giovanni's Adventures in Sicily\" which ends up in Giovanni's hometown of Palermo where they celebrate his birthday with his family who he cannot wait to introduce to his best friend Anton.\n\nAfter the first two episodes aired on BBC One the series had received a staggering 2.3 million viewers in the United Kingdom.\n\nSo where on the island was the series filmed?\n\nEpisode One\n\nSciacca\n\nThe duo start their Sicilian Adventure in the town of Sciacca on the south coast of the island. Giovanni tells Anton that he used to visit the town when he was young with his family. After Anton's attempts to order a coffee in Italian the duo set off in a race through the narrow roads of the town in three wheeled vehicles. The small port town of Sciacca has a nice harbour with blue and white fishing boats bobbing in the sea where fishermen arrive Monday to Friday to sell their catch on the wharf. The town also has a thriving ceramics tradition. The historic streets of the town become packed once a year with revellers for its renowned carnival parade with papier-mâché floats that depict current events or figures of popular culture.\n\nValley of the Temples Agrigento\n\nNext the duo head to the Valley of the Temples in Agrigento where Giovanni tells Anton that he went on a school trip and didn't pay any attention. The famed \"Valle dei Templi\" is home to ruined Greek temples that stand, or partially stand, against a backdrop of the distant sea. The temples are as awe-inspiring today as they must have been to the people who constructed them 2,500 years ago. Two of the most notable temples are the Temple of Hera and the Temple of Concord. The valley is one of the top tourist destinations on the island and due to the summer heat on the plateau and to avoid walking the duo explore the archaeological site on electric scooters. After an overnight stay they indulge in a Sicilian breakfast the next morning where Giovanni introduces Anton to the Sicilian sweet treats, cannoli and cassata.\n\nPunta Bianca Agrigento\n\nAfter breakfast the duo set off for Syracuse but Giovanni decides that Anton first needs to stop off at a beach and so they head for Punta Bianca. As they drive Anton tries to explain the English term \"budgie smuggler\" on the way to Giovanni. Punta Bianca is one of the most enchanting little known coastal areas on the island where the beach looks like it is covered in snow. The beauty of this beach is given by the white colour of the marl rock with a wavy shape that gleams against the sparkling blue sea. When the duo reach the destination they join a group of locals for a sound healing session where they are told that rather than soaking in a bath of water they can soak in a bath of sounds.\n\nArchaeological Park of Syracuse\n\nAfter their sound healing session Anton and Giovanni arrive in Syracuse and head for the archaeological park. Here Anton explains that he loves history and usually likes a qualified guide to show him around but ends up with Giovanni as his guide who tells him that he does not know anything because although he studied Sicilian history at school he did not pay attention. First they head to the Ear of Dionysus, a cavern which is said to have got its name from the large opening resembling a human ear. The name is also linked to the acoustic effects in the cave and it is said that people's voices echo up to sixteen times. According to legend the Greek tyrant Dionysus used the cavern as a prison and by means of the perfect acoustics he was able to eavesdrop on the plans and secrets of his prisoners. Of course Anton and Giovanni could not resist trying the acoustics by singing operatic songs. Next they head to the Ancient Greek Theatre, built in the 6th century BC which became the largest theatre of its kind in Sicily. The theatre sets the scene for performances and Greek tragedies on balmy summer evenings and here the duo cannot resist a cheeky dance together whilst singing \"Nice and Easy does it\" by Frank Sinatra.\n\nMarzamemi\n\nNext stop is Ortigia but first Giovanni has arranged a surprise for Anton in Marzamemi known as the prettiest seaside village in Sicily. This charming little fishing village grew up around the tonnara (tuna fishery). The old village remains but with the addition of modern resort features. Marzamemi is the perfect stop for a lazy seafood lunch in one of the characteristic restaurants and in the evening it takes on an Ibizan boho vibe. Giovanni's surprise is a fishing trip but not just any fishing, octopus fishing. The duo go snorkelling for their eight legged new friends with a expert octopus fisherman and they find one in a seacave but you will be glad to hear that they let the little fellow free and he goes back happily to his cave.\n\nIsola Ortigia\n\nAfter their fishy encounter they head to Ortigia. The tiny island of Ortigia is a bustling mix of temples, churches, museums, open piazzas, seaside bars and boutiques. I have to admit that Ortigia has a special place in my heart as it is one of the most pleasant towns in Sicily. In the evening they are asked to take part in the annual Feast of the Assumption. They carry the statue of the towns Madonna around the narrow uneven streets as lead bearers and then join the worshippers on a lifeboat where the Madonna is taken out to sea to mark those souls that have been lost at sea. Giovanni tells Anton that his mum would be very proud of him for the great honour of carrying the Madonna.\n\nCatania\n\nCatania is, as Anton says, \"a two step tango\" from Ortigia and this is where they drive to next. As they walk through the street markets, under the colourful umbrella art installation, Giovanni tells Anton that Catania is very close to his heart and a place he calls home. As a teenager at age fourteen he left Palermo and his family behind because the city was where his dance partner lived. The duo head for one of his favourite patisseries near Piazza Duomo where they buy the pastries \"Minne Sant'Agata\" (Saint Agatha's Breasts) then sit on the steps of the city's emblem, a lava elephant with an Egyptian obelisk on top, to enjoy their sweet treats. Giovanni explains the significance of the pastry and the cities patron saint, Sant' Agata. In the evening they meet up with one of his old dance friends, Angelo, at Catania's Tango Festival now in its 20th year which is held all over the city. That evening the event is being held in the cities old sulphur refinery where the pair take to the stage to tango with a guest from the crowd.\n\nEpisode Two\n\nTaormina\n\nThe following morning they head north to Taormina which Giovanni tells his friend is known as the \"San Tropez of Sicily\" and that it will really be Anton's kind of place \"Bougie bougie bougie\" ie; high class. As Sicily's first resort and obligatory stop on the Grand Tour, Taormina has welcomed visitors for centuries. The town, draped with bougainvillea, offers breath taking volcanic seaviews, an ancient Greek theatre and cafes and terraces overlooking the sparkling Ionian Sea. Due to the heat of day they decide that they need a drink and Giovanni knows exactly what they need \"Granita\", an ice cold Sicilian refreshment made from water, sugar and traditionally lemon juice. Granita is like a crunchy frozen slush, half ice, half drink with a granular texture that is ravishingly refreshing on the most sultriest of Sicilian summer days. It is not anything like \"Slush puppy\" as Anton describes it. They enjoy their granita in the towns main square, Piazza Aprile IX, where they listen and dance to traditional Sicilian folk music played by a folk trio. Giovanni declares to Anton \"When in Sicily you need to look the part\" and takes him to Melo's barber shop in the town where Anton enjoys a traditional wet shave and Giovanni attempts to make him look more Italian by shaving off his chest hair. Declaring that Anton is now \"Beach ready\" they head down to the sea via Taormina's cable car.\n\nGiardini Naxos\n\nGiardini Naxos is the seaside town down below Taormina in the Bay of Naxos and it is also the town where my Sicilian house is located. It is a low key beach resort and a fully fledged town with a port and long stretches of sand, lined with hotels, bars and restaurants. One of its attractions is water sports which are very popular in the summer season. It is also our town where our Sicilian house is located. Here the duo embark on Anton's worst nightmare, Paddle Boarding and Giovanni tries to do his best impression of James Bond emerging from the sea.\n\nMount Etna\n\nDominating the eastern side of the island Mount Etna is Europe’s largest volcano with several vast craters and a height of approximately 3,330 metres and remains one of the worlds most active volcanos. Etna is a must see on any trip to Sicily. As the duo ascend the volcanic slopes Giovanni tells Anton that he has booked a guide called “Mr Al Paca, his name is Al you know like Al Pachino”. Walking through Etna’s pine forests they discover that Mr Al Paca is actually a group of furry alpacas who they are now going alpaca trekking with. Trying to build a friendship with his new four legged friend Giovanni renames his alpaca Shirley after Shirley Ballas the head judge of Stictly Come Dancing. After their alpaca trekking Giovanni tells Anton that he has booked another surprise, glamping (posh camping) on Etna but first they stop off in one of Etna’s small volcanic towns to buy Sicilian sausage, my favourite, from a local butcher to BBQ. After a good nights sleep and breakfast Anton tells Giovanni that he now has a surprise for him and they head for one of Etna’s vineyards where a helicopter lands with a big surprise, it’s Rose!!!! Rose and Giovanni are reunited, yayyyyy!!!! The duo ask Rose how she is enjoying Sicily and she exclaims that she loves it and after seeing his big smile she knows now why Giovanni is always so miserable in the UK (a joke between them) a bit like me really when I am in the UK and I’m sure that this is what my friends in the UK think when they see photos of me in Sicily. After the happy reunion the trio and Rose’s sign language translator jump on board the helicopter for a volcanic trip of a lifetime flying over Etna’s smoking craters. Then Anton has another surprise for the happy pair …\n\nMadonie Mountains\n\nThe Madonie Mountain range features Sicily's highest peaks after Etna and is protected by the Parco Naturale Regionale dell Madonie. The park encompasses spectacular countryside, forests of beech, chestnuts, cork, oaks, poplars and fir trees. It is a good place for mountain hikes, horse riding, cycling, skiing in the winter season and zip lining and that is exactly what Anton has arranged for the three of them, zip lining. Zipline San Mauro Castelverde is the southern most zipline in Europe located at the Madonie UNESCO Global Geopark and is a 1.6 km flight at 130 km/h across the Gorges of Tiberius towards the sea. Anton and Rose loved it, Giovanni not so much. After their adrenaline fuelled experience the trio head to spend the night at a private villa where Anton has arranged for massages using volcanic infused oils.\n\nEpisode Three\n\nEnna\n\nThe next day the duo with Rose head inland to a Bed and Breakfast to Enna, a province in the Sicilian countryside. Here they have a cooking class and learn how to make cavatelli style pasta the type Giovanni’s grandmother used to make. which they have for dinner that night. Because of its easily defendable position on the top of a very tall hill, Enna was the only town in the interior for centuries. This hilltop town was a key position for any invaders that wanted to take control of the island. Enna was so well defended that the Arabs, having tried to capture it for 20 years, resorted to crawling in through the sewer system. The next morning the trio have a synchronised swimming contest in the swimming pool then Anton and Giovanni set off for Palermo leaving Rose behind at the B&B to sunbathe and relax.\n\nPalermo\n\nPalermo is the intriguing Capital City of Sicily. Its history is ancient and interesting. It was the Arabs, describing it as \"paradise on earth\", who contributed greatly to its glory. Subsequently, with thanks to Norman domination, the city became a rare example of majestic architecture. The Arab-Norman tourist route is not to be missed which includes the Cathedral, the Norman Palace and the Palatine Chapel. Today what remains of earlier ages coexists with modern life creating a multicultural city. The city boasts fabulous street food markets which make it a perfect destination for foodies. It is also the place where Giovanni was born and where he grew up and learned to dance. On arrival in the city and knowing that Anton loves golf, Giovanni takes Anton for a morning round at the Villa Airoldi Golf Club in Palermo. They then head just outside of Palermo to Monreale where they visit the Benedictine Monastery San Martino delle Scale where they spend the day with an overnight stay living the simple life of the Benedictine monks who live there. During the night they sneak out of their monks cell and search for beer that is brewed by the monks and they sneak a bottle back to their cell. The next day Anton surprises Giovanni with a birthday present, a sleek black Maserati that he has rented for him. Whilst driving around the city (not for the faint hearted, believe me) they get pulled over by the local police. They then head to meet Giovanni's family at the apartment that he grew up in. He then takes Anton to the Ballaró market where he entices him to try traditional Palermo street food including delicacies such stigghiola (lamb and veal intestines), frittola (leftover scraps from calf carcass which is boiled then fried until crisp) and pani ca meusa (bread with spleen). After Anton's gastronomic street food tour the duo get ready for Giovanni's birthday party which is held on Palermo's seafront marina where they are re-joined by Rose along with Anton's wife and children.\n\nFor me Anton and Giovanni have summed up in the series exactly what is important in Sicily ….\n\nFun, adventure, love, food, friendship and family.\n\nA BIG thank you to you both for showing the beauty of our beloved island to British viewers and for those outside the UK I hope that this post makes you feel that you have joined in the fun too ……\n\n\"Lovely jubbly !!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nAnton and Giovanni's Adventures in Sicily\n\nis available on UK BBCone iPlayer 🇬🇧\n\nGiovanni Pernice \"Made in Italy\"\n\nUK Tour Dates 2023\n\nfor Alpaca Trekking on Mount Etna\n\ncontact Luciano Domanti\n\nand follow him and his alpacas\n\non Facebook and Instagram\n\nZipline Sicilia - San Mauro Castelverde\n\nAsk me for my favourite Street Food Tour\n\nrecommendations in Palermo\n\nand Cooking Classes across the island\n\n🎶\n\nPhoto credits:\n\nCover photo - BBCone\n\nScaccia, Punta Bianca, Enna and Madonie -\n\nGoogle Images\n\nall other photos - @whitealmondsicily\n\n🕺🕺\n\nIf you enjoyed this Blog post then you might enjoy these ones from my archive\n\nWhere to go in Sicily? https://whitealmond-privatesicily.blogspot.com/2020/05/where-to-go-in-sicily.html\n\nMy Top Palermo Travel Tips https://whitealmond-privatesicily.blogspot.com/2018/08/my-top-35-palermo-tips.html\n\n20 Sicilian Sweets & Desserts You Must Try https://whitealmond-privatesicily.blogspot.com/2020/09/20-sicilian-sweets-desserts-you-must-try.html\n\nThe White Lotus Season Two Filming Locations https://whitealmond-privatesicily.blogspot.com/2022/12/blog-post.html\n\nLocked down in London ...
