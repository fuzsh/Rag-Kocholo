        "text": "We are just back from an AMAZING, perfectly planned and executed trip to Sicily. Marcello Baglioni is the gold standard of travel planners. He created a perfectly curated, balanced itinerary and checked in daily to make sure all was going smoothly. We could not have covered as much as we did (in 9 days) without having private drivers, who were excellent—especially Josie who started with us in Palermo. We covered a lot of ground in Sicily with a full schedule each day, but somehow it never felt rushed.\n\nWhile January might not be the ideal time to visit Sicily (with the weather less than cooperative!), we saw, learned, engaged, and met wonderful people all along the way—from Palermo and surrounding towns Monreale, Castebuono, Cefalu to Villa Romana del Casale, Agrigento, Testa del Aqua, Noto, Siracusa/Ortiega to Mt Etna. More than anything, getting to know Sicilians—over good conversations, culinary experiences, archaeology hikes, tours, food and wine—was the highlight of the entire trip. Marcello’s selection of guides and hosts was superb. Perhaps the highlight of many highlights was the final day at Mt. Etna guided by Salvo (a vulcanologist) followed by our visit to the Santa Maria La Nava Winery for a tour, wine-tasting and lunch hosted by Vera and Carmello. They epitomized the warmth, welcome and pride of purpose we found everyday during this first visit to Sicily. We look forward to returning soon to this stunning, fascinating, history-filled island.\n\nIn 2022, we spent 2 weeks in Sicily, perfectly planned by Marcello Baglioni. It was so much fun (see previous review) that we decided to go back for five nights to explore the Mt Etna wine region this past October. We wanted a home base providing easy excursions within the region without changing our accommodations or staying in locations with “tourists.” Our location was central, and we could explore local wineries and learn about the rich growing environment of the region.\n\nTwo highlights were the Mt Etna hiking tour and a fabulous cooking and wine-pairing luncheon. A visit to Mt Etna volcano is amazing, but if you are guided by a volcanologist named Salvatore, it is spectacular. Salvo’s enthusiasm and love of science is infectious. To see the top of a hotel that was destroyed during an eruption is an amazing experience. You look around and can follow the lava flow of previous eruptions and see the regrowth of trees in the igneous rock formed from the lava. When there is a news report of an eruption on Mt Etna, I know Salvo will be in the mix.\n\nA visit to Santa Maria La Nave Winery is a must. This area is known for its fertile soils, orchards, and particular grape varietals located on the northernmost flanks of Mt Etna. Vera, our wine expert, explained the recovery project of previously abandoned varietals on the property and the Casa Decima vineyard. The Grecanico Dorato and Albanello grape varietals were new to us and not something that can be found easily in the US. After a tour of the vineyards, we joined Lucia, an amazing cook, and Vera in the Zen building (our name for the structure). You walk in and immediately feel at home. A wall of glass overlooks the vineyards and mountains. Now, we got down to business with a glass of sparkling wine and a pasta-making lesson. Suffice it to say that Lucia did most of the cooking, and Vera paired the wine for a delightful afternoon in a beautiful location.\n\nThe trip was rounded out with a home-cooked meal and wine tasting at Filippo Grasso Winery and visits to nearby towns and villages that offered spectacular views of the coastline.\n\nAll of this was made possible by the wonderful relationships that Marcello has with local tour guides, wine experts, and chefs across Sicily. I don’t expect this will be our last trip to Sicily; without a doubt, Marcello will be our first call.\n\nWith plans to see eastern Sicily already booked, I turned to Marcello and Matteo to create a weeklong itinerary to visit Palermo and western Sicily. They were so thoughtful in their approach, asking me about my interests and goals for the trip, my preferences for hotels, transportation (me drive in Sicily — no way!) and dining. I took the advice found in many reviews by previous clients and gave Marcello and Matteo free rein to design the itinerary and I am so glad I did.\n\nI spent my first day in Palermo — such a bustling and exquisite city — seeing all the key historic sites, the waterfront, and the Capo Mercato with Giorgio, a thoroughly charming and expert guide. The following day I ventured out of Palermo with a driver and fantastic guide to visit Monreale Cathedral, a World Heritage Site and truly one of the most spectacular cathedrals I have ever visited. The guide made the visit so memorable — her knowledge of history, architecture and design was magnificent, and I really appreciated the chance to linger while other visitors were clearly being hustled in and out. Without the guide’s encouragement I might not have climbed to the top of the cathedral and taken the outside walkway along the roof — the views were beautiful and more than worth the climb. We traveled next into the hills near Camporeale for a private tour, lunch and tasting at Porto del Vento winery. Marco, the owner, was a generous and engaging host and I appreciated learning about his wines and his journey to becoming a vintner. It was a treat to see the harvest, learn about the winemaking process and then taste his award-winning wines. And then, when I thought the day couldn’t get any better, I was surprised with a WOW Moment — a private dinner at the home of chef Gabriella Garajo. The meal was remarkable — contemporary versions of Sicilian classics made with local ingredients served at Gabriella’s dining table set with her family china and silver. It was a perfect finish to a most memorable day. My final day in and around Palermo was spent in Castelbuno and Cefalu, touring the cathedrals and historic sites. Not to be missed — the manna (yes, from heaven!) and panettone in Castelbuno and strolling the charming streets of both towns.\n\nI spent the remainder of my week in Trapani, a gorgeous seaside city in western Sicily. From my base in Trapani, I spent several hours touring the archeological park at Segesta, including the temple and theater. Valentina, my guide, was so knowledgeable and personable — she really made the history and importance of the site come alive. I thoroughly enjoyed visiting Erice — on everyone’s must-see list in western Sicily as it is situated 2,000 feet above Trapani with panoramic views in all directions. The cathedral, many churches, and castle are not to be missed. Marcello and Matteo arranged a tasting at Maria Grammatico’s famous pastry shop — a dream come true for this lover of sweets! My guide and I spent the remainder of the afternoon touring Trapani, even encountering a wedding at the cathedral. I adored my last day in western Sicily, heading out to the Marsala Salt Pans first, including a museum visit to learn more about the salt harvesting process and history, then a short boat ride to Mozia, an important archeological site, and finally a tour of the city of Marsala. Again, my guide made the day fun and interesting.\n\nI am so impressed with how well Marcello and Matteo devised an itinerary to match my interests in history, architecture, design, and culture, while also finding time for memorable meals and wine tastings. They have a group of devoted guides who are smart, warm, and informative and it was a pleasure to spend time with each of them. Their drivers are peerless — I felt safe, well cared for and oh so glad I opted not to drive myself! They helped me choose just the right accommodations and when I said I’d love a room with a view, boy did they deliver. In Palermo, my terrace faced Teatro Massimo and in Trapani, my expansive terrace looked out onto the Tyrrhenian Sea — no matter whether it was night or daytime, the views were spectacular. Marcello and Matteo are attentive while you are in country — checking in daily to make sure all is going well, a very personal touch I truly appreciate.\n\nSicily is a unique and special place. I couldn’t be more delighted that I trusted Marcello and Matteo to design my trip.\n\nMy niece and I returned from Sicily just 17 days ago, but I’m only just coming down from the high induced by this remarkable trip! I’ve wanted to travel to Sicily for years but didn’t want to go on my own, so I asked my adult niece to accompany me since she is fascinated with Italy and its food, being a former chef. We wanted a trip that balanced cultural highlights with food experiences, and Marcello and Matteo really delivered! They arranged wonderful drivers and local guides in each of our locations—many of whom were specialists in their field. For example, our guide in Palermo, Andrea, is an archaeologist. He provided unique local insight and expertise on the city and its astonishingly beautiful mosaic-decorated churches. By having private drivers and guides, we not only maximized what we were able to see, but the guides helped us fully understand our experiences. One of the highlights of our time in Palermo was a day when we went to Monreale to see the exquisite Norman church and then stopped at a vineyard on the way back to Palermo for a private wine tasting and amazing lunch with the owners and their big friendly adorable dog!\n\nMany of our days were a lovely balance of cultural touring/visits and the rest of the day making cheese or tasting olive oil or learning how to make cookies! We also appreciated the boutique hotels recommended by Marcello and Matteo. Even when we were in cities, these hotels felt like a private, restful oasis each day when we returned from our activities. Their restaurant recommendations were also excellent and easy to find, thanks to the maps they provided!\n\nOur favorite part of the trip was our final few days, based in Ortigia, visiting the Greek ruins of Siracusa and the beautiful Baroque towns of Ragusa, Noto, and Modica. We both agreed that the private 4-course lunch served after an olive oil tasting in Ragusa was among the best meals we’d ever eaten in our lives! As we were leaving the Greek temples one late afternoon (wonderful light for photos) our guide told us about a Leonardo da Vinci painting that was being displayed in a small gallery near the exit of the temple area. We never would have known it was there if he hadn’t been with us.\n\nI’ve already recommended Marcello and Matteo to friends of mine who are interested in traveling to Sicily. We loved every minute of it and never had to worry about a thing. A perfect holiday!\n\nI wanted to give an enthusiastic review of Matteo for his services in planning the trip we just took in May of 2023. We used Matteo for a trip to Sicily in May of 22 and loved it but also realized that there was so much more to do in Sicily, so we arranged trip #2 to Sicily for this year in May.\n\nWe spent two full weeks in Sicily, the first near Noto (east) and the second in the southwest (near Menfi). We stayed at houses we rented through an agency (given that we wanted to rent places instead of staying in hotels, Matteo worked with us on picking out the property we chose near Noto, and that was very helpful).\n\nThe first week, we had a wide variety of historic, cultural and food-centered activities in the east near Noto. Matteo kept the geographic range of each day’s activities pretty tight so we were not in the car all day. We enjoyed everything, and sometimes the unexpected delighted. For instance, I had to persuade my husband to do the experience with a chef in Siracusa, where the chef took us through the food market, then we went back to his restaurant and helped him prepare a meal for us. My husband (and I) really enjoyed that activity. Some of the best activities were out in the countryside, like a visit to a sustainable family farm and lunch of home cooking, and the discussions we had with the farmer about his way of life (through our guide translating). On another day, we visited an ancient chapel site and site of ancient olive trees and nearby small villages. Memories of that day I’ll carry with me are the beautiful black horse being walked down the main street of one of the villages, and the friendly reception from the residents…and of course, the wonderful food we had every day.\n\nThe second week, we saw various historic and cultural sites in the west, including Agrigento/Valley of the Temples, Trapani, and Salemi, a beautiful small village on a hilltop. We had several relaxation days built into that week. The only place that was crowded was Valley of the Temples, but the ancient temples and ruins were about the best I’ve seen anywhere, including Athens.\n\nOverall comments:\n\nWe opted to have Matteo arrange drivers, and are so glad we did. Driving in Sicily is challenging and there are very few 4-lanes like in the States. The drivers were all excellent.\n\nWe’re glad we built in some rest days to the trip with no scheduled activities.\n\nMatteo wisely did not try to cram too much into one day or have us go too far away from where we were staying (aka “slow travel”).\n\nThe guides Matteo found for us were all top-notch—very professional and knew their topics and areas. Plus, they were all good sports putting up with all our questions.\n\nBetween the trip last year and the trip this year, we’ve spent 4 weeks in Sicily, and still haven’t seen all the major locations. It was so much fun and so relaxing to take it slow in Sicily—I felt like we gained a better appreciation for the culture, history and people. Sicily has gotten into our blood—it’s our happy place, and it’s likely we will return!!\n\nMy husband and I worked with Marcello to plan a 3-week vacation in Sicily which we took in September, 2022. Marcello was fabulous to work with! He listened carefully to how we liked to travel and what we were interested in doing. He gave us a wide range of experiences to choose from and helped us create a fantastic itinerary. He clearly loves his work and his passion and excitement for Sicily is contagious!\n\nWe decided not to drive ourselves and opted for drivers to get us around the island. The drivers he lined up for us were excellent. We always felt safe and in good hands. The drivers spoke English well and were happy to talk with us about their lives in Sicily.\n\nMarcello has an extensive network of guides, and we used guides in almost every place we went. They were without exception excellent. They spoke English well, were knowledgeable and passionate about their area of expertise and were able to show and teach us a great deal about the art, architecture, culture and life of Sicily!\n\nHe also arranged for us to have some unique experiences. Some of the highlights include —\n\nA morning spent with a local chef. First we went to the open-air food market, learning how he chose fruits, vegetables, fish and meat. Then we went to his restaurant (which is closed at lunch) and had a cooking lesson, followed by the delicious lunch we had watched him make for us.\n\nAnother experience was spending an afternoon and evening sailing on the Mediterranean in a 52-foot sailboat. The couple who own the boat were lovely and welcoming. They served us delicious antipasti and wine while we were sailing and watching the sunset.\n\nWe also visited an organic farm/ranch. We loved spending time with the owner, who spoke so passionately about his way of farming and raising cattle and horses. He was a fascinating man and it was an unforgettable experience.\n\nThanks to Marcello, we had a fantastic trip in Sicily. He not only planned it well but was in touch with our guides and drivers almost daily. When we needed to change a plan due to weather, he was able to accommodate us with no problem. It was reassuring to know he was so available should any need arise.\n\nI highly recommend working with Marcello if you are thinking of going to Sicily. You won’t regret it!\n\nWe had a wonderful week in the beautiful Noto area in southeastern Sicily planned by Matteo. This followed a 10-day group tour of the island, which covered Sicily highlights. We asked Matteo for advice and planning for an additional week of independent travel to less traveled areas. After several phone consultations narrowing down our interests (primarily food, culture, and history), he planned an excellent itinerary for us which included private guides for each location we visited and many interesting lunches and tastings (of granita, almonds, chocolate, olive oils and wine). Highlights of the experiences arranged by Matteo were the “geo-cultural adventure” on a less-visited part of Mt. Etna with a volcanologist, the visit to the Catania fish market with tastings of unusual and surprising local foods, and the wonderful granita-making experience with a delightful cooking instructor. All the guides were outstanding, very knowledgeable and provided us with information and experiences we couldn’t have had otherwise. Because we were self-driving a rental car, Matteo arranged for the guides to be with us most of the time. Matteo was in touch with us daily, telling us of the next day’s plans and where we would meet our guides. In several cases, he arranged for the guides to be “our personal GPS,” driving with us to various locations. This was very helpful and much appreciated. There was one glitch which was not Matteo’s fault but was a disappointment. As a highlight of our trip, I had arranged a special winery experience and dinner for my husband’s birthday. Unfortunately, for weather reasons it had to be cancelled at the last minute. Matteo informed us of the issue and arranged for another winery to host us. For an unknown reason, when we arrived at that winery, they were unable to welcome us. Matteo quickly arranged for us to have dinner at an excellent restaurant near our hotel in Noto. The dinner and service were outstanding, and we enjoyed everything about it. My husband is a serious wine enthusiast who had really been looking forward to the evening and we both were saddened not to have the planned experience.\n\nMy only somewhat negative comment is that I thought the cost was significantly higher than expected, well over $1000/day not including hotels or rental car. We had extraordinary and unique experiences and Matteo’s service and attention were exemplary and, other than the birthday wine dinner disappointment, it was an outstanding trip in every way. We will have great memories of this trip and they, and not the cost, will be what we take away from this experience.\n\nOne more very positive comment is that the hotels recommended by Matteo were superb and I would not have learned of them other than through his recommendations. Q92 in Noto was particularly wonderful and one of the most pleasant and interesting hotels we have ever stayed at.\n\nWe just returned from a fantastic trip to Sicily planned by Matteo Rota and Marcello Baglioni. Trip dates were October 12-October 22. We spent 3 nights in Palermo, 2 nights in Agrigento, and 4 nights in Siracusa. We were very happy with this trip! October is a great time to visit Sicily, the weather was perfect and the crowds were present but certainly less than high season.\n\nMatteo did an excellent job of listening to us—how we wanted our trip set up and what kind of experiences we wanted. We wanted time to self-explore and thus modified the original plan to a few less guided days, which worked great for us, but Matteo also knew where the value of a guide was indispensable and he made that clear (and he was right!).\n\nWe wanted several experiences on this trip and Matteo delivered on all of them. We wanted a food tour of the Sicily markets—Matteo got us a fantastic guide for a great Street Food tour. We wanted to shop and cook with a chef—Matteo arranged this with a charismatic great chef. We wanted a day on the water to sail and enjoy the sea—Matteo arranged a phenomenal afternoon and sunset sail with Salvo, a very special person who set up an amazing afternoon for us. We wanted an e-bike tour and this too was arranged for us. The vulcanologist on Mt Etna, the archeologist who led us through the Villa Romana del Casale, and the guide at the Agrigento temples were all also fantastic.\n\nWe usually like to rent a car and drive ourselves. After a lot of research we decided against this in Sicily, where the driving can be crazy, and the countless cars full of dents, the confusing traffic patterns and restricted access as well as the lack of parking proved our choice was the right one for us. In its place Matteo set up drivers for us who were always on time, professional and with very nice and spacious vehicles.\n\nWe liked the fact that Matteo and Marcello make suggestions for hotels and restaurants but had us do our own research into these and make our own reservations. Not only does this provide transparency, but it’s something we enjoy. The suggested hotels and restaurants were fantastic.\n\nA few suggestions for other travelers considering Sicily. Listen to Matteo and Marcello about Palermo. It was very interesting to visit and the market tour is a must. When in Agrigento, spend an evening in the town of Agrigento and have dinner there. It’s a very quaint town with very nice shops and restaurants. We are glad we stayed at the (very expensive) Villa Athena with an amazing view of the temples (15 min from town); this is a unique and great property with a great restaurant that is a bit formal, so another dinner experience in the city of Agrigento is worth it. We listened to Marcello and Matteo and did not see Taormina, as they felt strongly it was not worth the visit. We have no regrets—but just wonder a teeny tiny bit what all the hype there is about. Another observation—we had two wine tastings with lunch—one of which was in the Mt Etna area. They do this differently in Sicily. These were not winery visits like we have experienced in the U.S., Tuscany, France or Istria. No tour of the vineyards or facilities, no meeting the winemaker; just tasting the wines and a brief description with your meal. The meals and wine were good and we are glad we booked these, but just be aware of this kind of experience.\n\nMatteo was always available by WhatsApp or call, but we did not need to communicate much. The trip went perfectly smoothly, with all drivers and guides on time and exactly where we were supposed to meet them—all according to the itinerary. We definitely felt we were very well “taken care of” at all times.\n\nIf you are thinking about going to Sicily, you will be in great hands with Matteo and Marcello!\n\nWe booked a month-long trip to Portugal, Sicily, and Malta and unfortunately, had to cancel because of the pandemic. However, we were lucky enough to re-book again with Marcello and Matteo and travel to Sicily this past September 16-22, 2022.\n\nThe trip-planning process with Marcello was very well done with terrific responsiveness, lots of choice provided, and attention to detail. Marcello was a good listener and understood what my wife and I wanted in our 6-night trip to Sicily. He recommended we stay 3 nights in Siracusa and 3 in Taormina, which was a perfect blend. The hotel he chose in Siracusa, the Musciara Beach Hotel, was a boutique hotel located right on a unique sandy beach with beautiful views from our hotel patio, and we enjoyed our stay there.\n\nWe arrived late the 1st night after a full day of travel from Lisbon, and Matteo was very on top of things, making sure the hotel was expecting us and would be able to accommodate our later arrival after 10 pm, and to have a light meal prepared for us in their beautiful restaurant along the water, given he knew we would be hungry. We had 2 lovely days of tours in Ortigia as well as Noto, Modica, and Scicli, and we really enjoyed the sightseeing. Matteo made the effort to come to meet us for a lovely coffee while we were in his hometown of Moto—it was great to meet him and we enjoyed an hour chatting with him.\n\nWhile en route to our next stop of Taormina we had a walking tour of Mt. Etna with a Volcanologist, which was both interesting as well as a nice hike to see the volcano and learn the history of the region. We stayed in Taormina at the new San Domenico Palace, now the Four Seasons Hotel. It was an amazing property with incredible Four Seasons service and attention to detail. The hotel used to be a convent in the 14th century and has been beautifully restored and converted. We enjoyed a guided tour of Castiglione Di Sicilia and Randazzo while in the area, which was a relaxing day. Our last day in Taormina we spent walking around and enjoying the lovely streets and views of the town on our own. Taormina reminded us of the Amalfi Coast and its awe-inspiring views from the hills of the ocean below, cliffs, and the quaint town of shops and restaurants to enjoy.\n\nPANDEMIC TRAVEL Marcello was amazing. He was constantly available throughout the trip. He matched us with amazing guides who fit the personality of me and my mother. I’m pretty sure my mother wanted to exchange me for Alessandra, who she loved and was so happy to be around. Marcello was also incredibly flexible—one night we showed up to a dinner place and decided it wasn’t our vibe, and five minutes later he had us in a different restaurant that was perfect. My main advice would be to give Marcello the flexibility to design your trip—we constrained him a lot with what we wanted to do and ignored some of his suggestions—to our detriment! For instance, we told him we didn’t want to take a cooking class and only wanted to see historical sites (because we’re not cooking class people!) and that’s what he arranged (to be clear—all our historical sites trips were great). We then had dinner at the chef’s restaurant who he had suggested we take a cooking class with. The restaurant was so amazing and the chef was so kind that when my mother realized that we could have taken a class with him she audibly shrieked. When we go back to Sicily again we will absolutely use Marcello and we will be taking a cooking class with that chef.\n\nPANDEMIC TRAVEL The hotels were very good to excellent.\n\nMost of the guides were very good. The volcanologist was top draw.\n\nOur drivers were terrific. Our itinerary missed the mark and should have been a lot better. The one suggested restaurant we tried was awful.\n\nResponse from Trusted Travel Expert Marcello Baglioni\n\nDuring the trip-planning process, Warren seemed pleased with the Sicily itinerary that we planned for him, telling us that “it looked great!” During the trip, we checked in regularly, and he never indicated that anything was wrong or requested any itinerary changes. Of course, finding out afterward that he was disappointed is too late, since we can’t do anything after a tour ends. Each of our trips is highly personalized, but there will always be at least some adjustments to a tour program, even if it looks perfect at the start. The most successful trips are those with space for serendipity and open exchange between the traveler and the trip planner, both pre-trip and en route. Such collaborative interaction by Warren would have made all the difference. As for restaurant choices, collaboration between traveler and trip planner is again key. Not actually knowing where Warren’s meal took place— whether it was suggested by a concierge, a friend, or by us—underscores once again the lack of communication from the traveler during the trip that could have made all the difference.\n\nPANDEMIC TRAVEL Marcello and team are superb, A++, creating a trip of a lifetime\n\nWe have utilized the WOW List travel experts for our last 3 trips with great satisfaction. Marcello raised the bar even higher, creating a truly exceptional itinerary for our 26-day sojourn in Sicily, one that exceeded our high expectations! Marcello is an avid listener who understood our desire to learn and deepen our understanding of the culture of Sicily….achieved through a good balance of visits to archaeological and historic sites coupled with engagement with expert guides and local people, visiting out of the way places that most travelers would miss. Marcello checked in every day during our trip, both with us and with the guides, as he genuinely cares about your enjoyment and satisfaction with the experiences he has so artfully and carefully created. In conversations with Marcello, his love of Sicily….the people, the food, its vast and complex history…is palpable, and reflected in the itinerary.\n\nWe would not have had the in-depth experience of life and history of this island without our drivers and guides.\n\nAll the drivers were wonderful. They were knowledgeable about each region, eager to engage in conversation, and share with us their insights. They were always prompt, professional, and went out of their way to make sure our needs were being met.\n\nThe guides were outstanding, each being expert in their field and relaying their knowledge in a digestible way. Importantly, they were fun to be with, candidly sharing their experiences and perspectives of Sicily. Love of family and love of this island’s complex and storied history has drawn them back with an eagerness to share with others the beauty of this land. We bid farewell to each guide with a bit of sadness, as over the course of a few days we had become friends. While every day presented unique and wonderful experiences, some highlights:\n\n-hiking Mt. Etna with a volcanologist, deepening our understanding of this mysterious, mystical place and the mountain they refer to as mother;\n\n-wine tasting/pairing with a sommelier expert on Mt. Etna wines, who introduced us not only to the special quality of wines grown in volcanic soil, but granita, a most delectable treat during a warm summer day\n\n-visits to the Greek/Romans temples of Segesta, Selinunte and the Valley of the Temples with archaeologists who vastly increased our knowledge of Sicily’s complex and complicated history\n\n-visit to the tuna factory on Favignana and the “impossible Garden,” a dream realized by a determined and courageous woman who envisioned a garden in the midst of the rock quarries\n\n-shopping the local market with Maurizio, the entertaining and charismatic chef of Macalle in Ortigia, followed by a cooking class and meal, and many ideas to take home\n\n-hiking and sailing on the island of Salina, enjoying lunch where Il Postino was filmed, visit to a local caper farm, and enjoying the outstanding wines of the local vineyards\n\n-visit to a water mill which has been grinding wheat into flour since the 1690s, a process that results in flour naturally low in gluten\n\n-visits to many small, beautiful villages: Castellammare del Golfo, Castelbuono, Novara Da Sicilia, Montalbano Elicona, Favara, Santa Anastasia, SantAngelo Muxaro, Cefalu – walking and chatting with the men who congregate in the piazzas, enjoying a meal prepared by Annalisa in her home, gaining insight into their traditional way of life over centuries\n\n-a special shout out to Italo, who guided us through Ortigia, Buccheri where we enjoyed a delightful lunch prepared by Sebastiano and his brother, joined in the celebration of St. Paul in the town of Palazzolo, a performance by a puppet master. Italo’s joy and zest for life were truly contagious.\n\nI could go on. This was a trip of a lifetime. We returned home with a deeper understanding of the Sicilian culture, their love and loyalty to family, a well-deserved pride in their diverse and complex history, and their vision, hopes and dreams for the future of Sicily. While 26 days seemed more than adequate, we have continued to talk about our next trip to this beautiful island. With deepest gratitude to you, Marcello, for creating a truly outstanding itinerary, and your amazing team of guides and drivers and all those who made this an unforgettable experience.\n\nPANDEMIC TRAVEL My trip to Sicily was a long time coming—-originally planned for April 2020, postponed by the pandemic, and finally came to fruition in April 2022—and the wait was worth it!!\n\nThroughout it all, Marcello provided a steady hand in the initial planning, the COVID cancellation, and finally the execution of what is one of the most wonderful trips ever.\n\nWhen rebooking, adjustments to the itinerary were inevitable. But with Marcello’s expertise and contacts, he succeeded in providing an ever more stellar experience.\n\nThe itinerary gave us the perfect mix of the cities as well as hilltop villages and landscape in the hinterlands. Among the highlights—a market visit and cooking class in Ortigia, a day foraging for wild herbs with a food historian and chef near Buccheri, visiting Mt Etna with a volcanologist, touring Palermo and Monreale with an architect and Siracusa with an archeologist, experiencing an Easter procession in Scicli, birding with a naturalist near the temple of Segesta.\n\nDrivers, guides, accommodations were just perfect at each and every location.\n\nMost importantly, Marcello was with us via phone and WhatsApp throughout. He was totally engaged in checking and rechecking to ensure all went as planned and on schedule.\n\nHis personal attention had us feeling “like family” as he understood our interests and tastes so well!\n\nI’ve been home less than a week and have already recommended Wendy Perrin and Marcello to friends. Thank you once again for another WOW trip!\n\nPANDEMIC TRAVEL We took a two-week trip to Sicily with the help of Marcello Baglioni and Matteo Rota, with Matteo being our primary contact and planner. Although I had a rough idea of the places I wanted to go, Matteo put it all together superbly, including visits to two wineries which I would not have thought of. Those visits were a highlight of the trip as was a sailboat excursion in the Bay of Syracuse with a delightful owner/skipper who provided a delicious meal, including olive oil he makes himself. Matteo gave us an excellent driver, Salvatore, in western SIcily who was with us for a week. He was fluent in English and a great companion. Our other drivers were also excellent but Salvatore was something special. Our guide in Palermo, Enrica, was exactly what we wanted. I had told Matteo I am interested in architecture and art and he gave us a real expert. Without her, we would not have truly understood a lot of what we saw. And finally, Matteo suggested the most wonderful accommodations where we were comfortable and happy. I never would have found them on my own. I would have liked to stay longer in any one of them. We had to cancel this trip twice and are so glad we finally made it and that Matteo made it so special.\n\nPANDEMIC TRAVEL This is the second trip I’ve taken where I’ve used a trip planner – and I doubt I’ll take another without taking advantage of their expertise if they’re anything like Marcello. He planned out our days (after giving us many options of what type of trip we’d like) – we had direction and saw things we’d never have been able to arrange easily on our own. Tours of ancient cities, quant villages, vineyards, almond farms and Mt Etna. And not just with guides, but with experts – archaeologists & vulcanologists, wonderfully well-versed and entertaining people, we liked being with them and found ourselves learning (in a good way!). We shopped in a farmers market with a guide who brought us back to her beautiful home and we prepared a delicious, traditional meal together. Marcello offered dining and hotel recommendations, supplied directions and suggestions for car rentals and ferry passage – he even found a jeweler who had an unusual pendant I had been searching for (a trinacria).\n\nWe had concerns about Covid and the wildfires in Sicily – Marcello researched and addressed them quickly and thoroughly. He also suggested trip insurance to afford us peace of mind (which was worth every penny). We were always able to quickly get in touch if we had questions before, during and even after our trip, and he checked in frequently to make sure we were ok – and because he was in Sicily while we were, he surprised us with a quick meeting while we were out with our guide.\n\nAs we write this, we were scheduled to start an exciting 15-day tour of Sicily tomorrow. Instead, like countless other disappointed would-be travelers, we’re home bound and thinking about what might have been.\n\nGiven the uncertainties of the virus-impacted future and our senior-citizen status, it’s likely we will not have another opportunity to take the tour that Marcello and Matteo so carefully designed for us. But we want to thank you for recommending them.\n\nMarcello Baglioni and Matteo Rota were a joy to work with. We’re very grateful for the time and effort they spent. Sadly, we won’t get to enjoy the four splendid hotels that Matteo helped us select, or the archeological sites, food markets, museums, private tours, a guided visit to Mt. Etna, and much more that awaited us.\n\nThere is also the monetary loss — a cancellation fee under our contract with Marcello and Matteo, and a full nonrefundable payment to Algila Hotel in Siracusa. We had foolishly booked a room at a no-refund rate, which was recommended as the only way to ensure that we would get the room we wanted. We won’t make that mistake again.\n\nThankfully, Marcello was able to cancel the other hotels and all of the prearranged activities without costing us anything. Marcello provided invaluable help to us during the cancellation process. We thank him for that.\n\nTo our surprise and enormous relief, United Airlines refunded everything we had spent with them.\n\nWhen the coronavirus struck, we discovered that our travel insurance—like most travel policies—didn’t cover epidemics. We are permitted to transfer that coverage to another trip within the next year. Otherwise, that will be a loss of almost $5,000.\n\nIf we were able to postpone the Sicily trip to next year, we might recoup some of the other financial losses. But, as we noted, it’s unlikely that will happen.\n\nLike the old travelogues say, so ends our almost spectacular tour of beautiful Sicily. We would like to thank Marcello for planning what we’re certain would have been an extraordinarily memorable vacation.\n\nWe worked with Matteo to plan a mini honeymoon in Eastern Sicily following our wedding in Canada the week prior. I really appreciated his honest recommendations and approach to travel while in the planning stages. Exactly our approach to touring – he made sure we avoided the most “touristy” areas and were able to experience some really special and unique places. We stayed in Siracusa for 4 nights and on Mt. Etna for 2, with activities planned with guides each day. It was a good pace – we felt busy the whole time, but never exhausted. The guides were all excellent with good English and different personalities. We were never rushed and everybody worked around our timeline; they were flexible too as we were running late, or wanted to extend certain portions. We particularly liked the market tour and cooking class with Maurizio, our cycling day to the nature reserve, and our sunset boat cruise. We met Matteo in Syracusa and he showed us some of his favourite shops; he checked in throughout the trip and we heard from our guides that he was in constant communication with them making sure everything went smoothly. Food recommendations were excellent throughout. Communication was prompt and easy. The hotels were amazing; in Siracusa we stayed at the Musciara – the photos really don’t do it justice at all. I’m used to planning and organizing all of our trips, so it was a really special treat here where Matteo was on top of everything and we didn’t have to worry at all, and were pampered throughout.\n\nMarcello was a fantastic trip specialist for Sicily. My husband and I could not have been happier with both his trip design and his support while we were there. Marcello suggested an itinerary that focused on food, wine, and culture, and every part of the itinerary was great. The guides he arranged were top-notch. These included a vulcanologist to help us understand the history and geology of Mount Etna, an archeologist who showed us really interesting ancient sites and took us on some beautiful hikes, and a chef who took us on a market tour and then cooked a Sicilian lunch with us. Marcello also assisted us with hotels and restaurants, and every place he recommended was terrific.\n\nI also appreciated that Marcello kept us from making some errors in our trip planning. Originally, we wanted to tour both the eastern side of Sicily and Palermo, but Marcello gently steered us away from that idea since we were going to be there for only 4.5 days. He was completely right that there was more than enough to see on the eastern side of Sicily, and we otherwise would have spent a lot of unhappy hours sitting in traffic.\n\nWhen we were in Sicily, Marcello checked in regularly with our guides, drivers, and us to make sure that every aspect of the trip was going smoothly. We really appreciated his attentiveness and detail-orientation in making sure we didn’t have to waste any time worrying about our logistics.\n\nI would also recommend Marcello because he was very nice and easy to work with. We can’t wait to go back to Sicily and have him develop yet another itinerary for us!\n\nMarcello kept us from making some errors in our trip planning.\n\nOur trip to Sicily was amazing and so is Marcello Baglioni. Marcello, while based in the US, spends a lot of time in Sicily searching high and low for the best experiences and the best guides all to the benefit of his clients. He listened carefully at the planning stage and incorporated our requests into the itinerary. (For example, I mentioned that my husband was interested in learning how to cook octopus and Marcello worked it into our itinerary and we had a great experience shopping for octopus in the local market with a chef and cooking it back at the chef’s restaurant.) But what really makes a trip with Marcello so special is his selection of guides as each is so passionate about their field of expertise. From the volcanologist (a professional—not a hobbyist) who became enchanted with Mt. Etna as a young boy, to the archaeologists, the chefs, the wine expert—the list goes on. For example, we were very fortunate that there was an eruption on Mt. Etna the morning of our Etna visit and the volcanologist was able to explain not only what was going on at the eruption site but showed us live video feeds from his colleagues that weren’t available publicly. He also had us quietly listen to the eruption, smell the air, and notice the tiny bit of ash that was landing on our jackets. No one else did. Other guides would stop and ask him questions because they had no understanding of what was going on at the eruption site. One guide even turned to her own clients and told them how lucky my husband and I were to have the volcanologist as our guide! This is just one example of the quality of our guides and how lucky and special we felt on this trip.\n\nThis trip exceeded our expectations and I could not recommend him more highly.\n\nMarcello and his team of specialists in Sicily were simply fantastic! We have never had a better planner in that he specifically called every driver/guide etc every step of our journey!\n\nWe definitely loved our experience from start to finish. Specifically we would recommend to other travelers to visit the Cammarata Dairy Farm which was very special with Marco being a wonderful host! Also, our driver Claudio was amazing! He spoke English with no accent and really should be encouraged to study to be a guide…there is nothing wrong with being the driver but Claudio is very smart and at only 25 years old has a lot of knowledge about the history of his country. Do not miss the visit to Favara with Annalisa as your guide and hostess for lunch and possibly a cooking class. We did not have time to take her class but spending the morning with her was a sheer delight! We loved stuffing our own cannoli (my husband’s favorite dessert on the planet), seeing her interact with townspeople as everyone knows her, and having a delicious lunch at her home was the icing on the cake. We loved Villa Romana del Casale with our amazing guide Serena. She is an archaeologist and professor at the local university and completely brought the ruins to life. We felt that we were being brought around by the person that lived there 2,000 years ago. As for our boating adventure on the Aeolian Islands the only recommendation I would give is to perhaps not have lunch at the restaurant at the Hotel Signum which takes a while to get to and with little time to explore Salina. We would recommend exploring Salina and then having lunch in the middle of Lipari at their best restaurant, Ristorante Filippino, which is probably a fraction of the cost and easier to get to. It is also beautiful and charming. The boat was so comfortable and the guide Kristina was delightful! Those are a few highlights and overall the trip was perfect! Loved loved Sicily!!!!\n\nMarcello Baglioni is the person you want if you are planning a trip to Sicily. From the moment I talked to him by phone, I knew that he immediately understand what we wanted to see and do.\n\nHe provided outstanding guides for visits to archaeological and historical sites, our main interest. With only a week to see Sicily, we narrowed it down to sites in Catania, Siracusa, and Palermo. All of his guides were professional and personable. They well-versed in their subject matter and spoke English very well. In addition, there was no clock-watching with these guides; in fact all of them continued their tours longer than was planned.\n\nOur drivers were outstanding too, always on time, very professional, and eager to help. Carmello (who has an incredible sense of humor too) even drove back to a restaurant to retrieve my jacket while we visited a Roman villa. On our return to Catania from Siracusa, our driver stopped at the airport to drop off our daughter who was flying to Italy that evening.\n\nMarcello surprised us in Ortigia, the old city of Siracusa, by showing up to meet us personally. It was a pleasure to meet him and to work with him on this trip. Everything went extremely well. Our only regret is that we had so little time in Sicily. We shall have to contact Marcello again for the next trip! Grazie, grazie, gracie.\n\nSince this was our first-ever trip to Sicily and we were a little overwhelmed by trying to plan a trip that would cover all the important bases without leaving us feeling frazzled, we felt the need for a travel specialist and went straight to the WOW list. And finding Marcello was absolutely key to the ultimate success of our trip. First of all, he was very flexible in designing a trip that fit our desired pace of travel as well as our budget. And then, once we got to Sicily and realized how fascinating the tours were that he had set up for us, we couldn’t imagine doing this trip without his guidance. Very importantly, he monitored our trip daily from his office in Texas, to make sure everything was going smoothly. He most notably helped us avoid a very difficult day of driving by seeing that a snowstorm was predicted for the area where we were to do a cheese-tasting the next day, so he canceled it and scheduled a marsala-tasting in another area where the weather was clear. In addition, every one of the guides he set us up with was outstanding. He obviously uses the same care to vet his guides as Wendy does when choosing the travel specialists who merit inclusion on the WOW list.\n\nOur two week trip to Sicily exceeded our expectations, both in terms of what Sicily has to offer and the adventure that Marcello orchestrated for us.\n\nSicily is far more than an island in the sun…it’s a land at the crossroads of history and culture. The guides that Marcello provided for us were second to none that we’ve experienced in years of travel and made this amazing land with its deep, complex and fascinating history come alive.\n\nOur itinerary had a wide variety of experiences from historical/cultural sites to fantastic culinary experiences to meeting with local cheese and pasta artisans to sailing Ionian waters. Hotels recommended to us by Marcello were not only first-rate, but each one was unique and different in its own right.\n\nFor our trip (which included stays in Palermo, Trapani, Agrigento, Ragusa, Siracusa, and Taormina) we opted for the self-drive option, meeting guides along the way. Everything worked seamlessly. Unlike experiences we’ve had with large travel agencies, Marcello was personally on top on our travels everywhere along the way, checking in with our guides or us directly to ensure that all of our expectations were being met.\n\nOne of the reasons for Marcello Baglioni’s success is that he specializes in Sicily and does not try to be all things to all people. My hope for our future travels is that we can find similar, highly focused boutique operations in other countries we visit. In the meantime, Marcello is most deserving of being on the WOW List…make no mistake about it…..Five Stars from us.\n\nMarcello gave us ten unbelievable days in Sicily, the country he loves so much, and he was there checking in on us each day making certain we were experiencing what we wanted to find in Sicily. We knew that we wanted to see antiquities and beautiful countryside, but we didn’t know hidden treasures like Morgantina, the archeological site where Marcello sent us with a charming archeologist whose published articles on Greek artifacts and enthusiasm for the site excited us on a flower-filled spring morning. Nor did we know of a tiny village tucked into the hills where his fabulous guide introduced us to cheese makers and bread bakers (with whom we baked pizza for an outdoor luncheon.) Nor would we have ever found the young olive grower whose mother prepared a sumptuous luncheon served on their veranda, surrounded by olive groves. The list of delightful Sicilians Marcello sent us to stretches from a volcanologist on Mt. Etna to a family whose Mt. Etna winery was recently noted in the New York Times. This was not a “cookie-cutter” vacation!\n\nMarcello listened carefully and gave us an itinerary that matched our dream experience in Sicily. We couldn’t do all that he suggested–sailing the coastline, for example) due to our limited days, but he knew how to keep us enthralled with the things we hoped to see and to help us unwind in luxury in beautiful Taormina on our last two days. I’ve encouraged all my friends to visit the sites of Sicily with the extraordinary guides Marcello knows whether they drive themselves or use a private driver. We ate well, saw and learned so much about Greek and Roman sites, interacted with talented people–bakers, chefs, history experts, and loved the rolling hills of Sicily which we saw with the skill of Marcello’s planning and judgment. We couldn’t have found anyone who knew and loved the famous as well as the seldom-discovered places on this itinerary, customized to the things we love.\n\nI have just returned from one of the more memorable trips I’ve ever experienced. As I’ve told friends, I didn’t just see Sicily, I experienced Sicily. It was an outstanding trip in every way.\n\nI was a woman, traveling alone and driving myself. I soon learned I needn’t have apprehensions, for Marcello checked on me regularly and was a phone call away Day 1 when I found myself lost in a small village. Marcello patiently guided me out of the dilemma; and had me once again on my way.\n\nEvery day was a new, wonderful adventure. I would never have had the wide range of experiences without Marcello. Attention to detail was ever present. The guides were outstanding and obviously carefully selected by Marcello for their expertise, passion for their field, and perfectly delightful personalities. I felt a connection with each of them. Each of them seemed to fill part of a special team and, indeed, they are.\n\nI visited Palermo, a dairy farm in Cammarata, Valley of the Temple in Agrigento, the wonderful little village of Sant Angelo Muxaro, Morgantina and the museum in Aidone, Villa Romana del Casale, Ortigia (a favorite) with the tour of the market and cooking class that followed, an olive farm where I had lunch with a charming family, Mt. Etna (toured with a volcanologist), and ending my travels in beautiful Taormina. Every step of the way, the cultural guides made the experience come alive with the depth of their knowledge and passion for their subject.\n\nI would strongly urge anyone planning a trip to Sicily to not miss the opportunities and expert planning Marcello can provide. With his guidance, you will truly come to know and feel the spirit and dimensions of Sicily.\n\nI cannot say enough wonderful things about Marcello and our fabulous girls trip to Sicily. Right from the beginning Marcello was responsive and put together a great itinerary. We went through several rounds of revisions and I have to say we pretty much ended up very close to what Marcello had originally proposed. We traveled in November – no crowds and luckily still nice weather.\n\nOne of the best decisions (though pricey) was to hire a private driver. Not only was Gianni so sweet and easy to be with, it took out the stress of driving and parking and allowed us to drink fabulous Sicilian wines at lunch and dinner!\n\nWe had one disappointing hotel but I think that was more a function of the available options in that locale than anything else. The other 2 were fabulous! Villa Athena was a dream and Ortigia Charme was a delight with the most warm staff. Restaurant recommendations were spot on. If I could make one suggestion it would be to put all the documentation (perhaps with a little more description) in a printable .pdf format in addition to the google map.\n\nWhile we were there we were lucky to get a Wendy Perrin “wow” moment – a reception in a private villa overlooking the Duomo in Ortigia. It was a lovely surprise. I will say, however, that every day of this trip had a wow moment – touring Agrigento at dusk with virtually no crowds, discovering the beauty of the mosaics at Monreale and Villa Romana de Casale, a lunch in Modena, a chefs tour and private cooking class in Ortigia, the list goes on. What made these places so special were the guides that Marcello has cultivated. They were all specialists in their field and were wonderful to be with.\n\nMarcello kept tabs on us at all times and made sure our itinerary went off like clockwork. By the end of the trip, we’d start to giggle every time our driver or guide took a call from Marcello. They all clearly enjoy working with him.\n\nThank you, Marcello, for showing us such a perfect week. Can’t wait to go back!\n\nI cannot say enough about what an incredible trip Marcello Baglioni planned for my husband and me this month in Sicily. Everything was flawless. Marcello was a master at getting a feel for what we were like as people and planning the perfect trip. And he even did this for us at the very last minute! After a few phone calls, he knew our personal travel style and off he went. We soon came to know that Marcello knows pretty much everyone in Sicily. Marcello is not a travel agent. He is an archaeologist (truly), food and wine connoisseur, historian, lover of nature, and most importantly just a wonderful human being. Every single place that Marcello directed us to was better than the next. The guides that he had at his disposal were amazing. They were highly educated about each place we visited and made each site come alive in a way that we have not experienced before by a long shot. (We generally eschew guides as not very good–but not this time). We stayed in olive groves with views of the sea, on the sea at the site of an ancient Greek city, in the countryside with Etna within easy reach. Marcello, arranged for us to have a volcanologist, whose amazing knowledge of Etnas eruptions made our tours of Etna amazingly interesting. We toured Siracusa, the ancient Greek city by sea, as the Greeks would have themselves by way a a beautiful restored wooden boat with a wonderful captain. We made Modica chocolate and had a delicious traditional Sicilian lunch on the veranda of a house overlooking the beautiful hillside of Modica. We learned everything about the beautiful Baroque city of Noto and its architecture and the earthquake that shattered existence in that part of the world in 1693. We did this while sampling the amazing wines and food of Eastern Siciliy. We avoided crowds. What more could one want. Except there was more and that was because Marcello much more like your cousin or friend, always checking in and making sure that things were going well, always making sure that what he had planned was to your liking. As I said he is an genuinely nice human being– wonderfully intelligent –compassionate, warm, and from our perspective a friend for life.\n\nWe just returned from an 8 day trip to Sicily and are still marveling at the great time we had under Marcello’s expert care. Our itinerary was so well crafted – a wonderful balance of old and new, sea and land, fun and education. We loved the fresh night air of our Aetna vineyard and Agrigento olive farm and the smell of the sea from our Ortigia lodging.\n\nAnd the experiences – exploring a lava cave, drinking wine in the Ortigia marketplace while tasting a “life-changing” piece of smoked mozzarella, Captain Enrico allowing Steve to take the helm for a portion of our Mediterranean cruise, tasting newly pressed olive oil, and sensing what it was like to live in the era of the Greek temples and Roman amphitheaters.\n\nMarcello has assembled an incredible team of resources. Not only was everyone an expert in their field, but what came through loud and clear was their passion for what they were doing – certainly not your everyday guides. And it was clear that everyone felt they were part of a team.\n\nThe handoff between the various drivers, guides and proprietors were seamless. Each person knew what we had done the day before and what was next on our itinerary. The attendant at Cavanera expressed concern when we did not arrive “on time”. Salvatore escorted us to our wine tasting lunch (which we likely could not have found on our own.) The young lady at BB22 coordinated with our Palermo driver and walked us out to the designated meeting spot. Every person went out of their way to make our trip effortless.\n\nAnd of course, Marcello was always there in the background – checking with each of our guides to make sure we were on schedule and in one case, asking for our GPS coordinates (and offering to send out a rescue team) when we were momentarily lost in the mountains!\n\nChef Maurizio, who gave us our cooking lesson, summed it up the best when he said there is a difference between tourists and voyagers. Thanks to Marcello for making us feel like voyagers.\n\nThe very diverse activities, destinations, and guides arranged for us in Sicily were without exception superb, from Palermo to Agrigento, Siracusa, Mt. Etna and Taormina. The guides we had were all extremely knowledgeable about their respective subject matters (archeology, history, volcanology, climate, current social issues in Sicily etc.) as well as charming. The activities we enjoyed were even more interesting and delightful than we could have hoped for. They met fully and indeed exceeded our expectations as embodied in the wishes and the criteria we had expressed to Marcello. He obviously listens attentively and is creative in figuring out how to meet the wishes of his clients. Notably, we also appreciated that either Marcello or one of his assistants contacted us several times during our trip to make sure that everything was going well. The guides we encountered all know Marcello well, respect him enormously and are looking forward to his next regular visit to Sicily in September. In addition to the mind expanding architectural and historical aspects of our tour we also greatly enjoyed our visit to the Camporeale winery and our day boat trip from Siracusa, which included a lunch in which we were served the most delicious mussels we have ever tasted. We had the opportunity to spend time in a small village where we could experience artisanal cheese making and even participate in pizza making with the owner of a bakery who (to our surprise) spoke English with a definite Southern English accent having lived there for 20 years.This was our first trip to Sicily and at the end of it in addition to a marvelous vacation experience we feel we have a much deeper appreciation of the history, culture, and role of this island that has absorbed/ endured successive waves of Greek, Roman, Muslim, Norman, Spanish, French and Austrian influences ranging from the admirable to the brutal. We have developed a more nuanced perspective on the events of the last century and a half and the position of Sicily since the Risorgimento and reunification of Italy.\n\nMarcelo spent a lot of time with us designing a trip to Sicily that turned out to be outstanding. Here is some of the feedback & thanks we gave him:\n\n– Thank you for a fantastic and memorable trip! We had a great time and appreciated the excellent taste of beautiful Sicily that you helped us experience.\n\n– We loved both hotels. Delicious food, warm personal service, small size. Excellent recommendations. Thank you very much!\n\n– The guide was wonderful. Easy to be with, organized, friendly, knowledgeable, fun. The whole family liked her and learned with interest from her.\n\n– The driver was excellent. Always on time, brought cold water, even took his own lunch out of a small cooler to let us bring it to the beach. Always cheerful, friendly, polite, professional. Car in great shape, spacious & comfortable.\n\n– Every activity was interesting & worthwhile, and every day well planned & fun, with enough sights & visits, and enough free time at the beach & pool.\n\n– The founder of the herb farm was enchanting. The visit & lunch were both great, a real highlight. So creative and beautiful and fun.\n\n– The afternoon boat was also a real highlight. We loved the crew, boat, ride, swim, commentary, everything.\n\n– The head of the olive farm & his parents couldn’t have been nicer at the olive oil maker. We had an interesting visit and such a warm, friendly lunch.\n\n– The beach was great for kids and fun, but we wondered if there is a more beautiful beach we could have gone to instead.\n\n– The lunch and free afternoon at the country hotel were great. The people there were lovely.\n\n– The free time in the little village was great. Gorgeous seaside restaurant & fun shopping.\n\n– We loved the volcano expert & the visit to Mt. Etna. His enthusiasm was infectious, and he told us such interesting things. It was less of a hike than I expected but perfect given the heat.\n\n– We are sorry we did not do a cooking class as you had suggested, but were not sure what we would have sacrificed to fit one in.\n\n– Many thanks again for introducing us so wonderfully to Sicily!\n\nAs you can see, we thought Marcelo fully earned his place on Wendys WOW list. We recommend him wholeheartedly for arranging a trip to Sicily. He met us for dessert on our trip, and were so happy we got to meet and thank him in person. We loved the Greco-Roman ruins we visited with Marcelo’s wonderful guide, as well as all the other parts of our trip mentioned above. Sicily is amazing, and Marcelo will open its treasures for you.\n\nI used Marcello for a special private journey that I planned for a group of lifelong friends ranging in ages from 34 to 87. Marcello helped me plan a once in a lifetime experience in Sicily for my group of 8 in October, an ideal time to visit Sicily. I had been to Sicily many times over 30 years as a student, and later on cruise ship day trips and pre and post cruise short stays. I knew what to see but I needed help in crafting truly memorable experiences for my group, with someone who had up to the minute connections and furthermore, ideas. Marcello is the man to pull off your dream trip to amazing Sicily!!! Marcello succeeded in getting us through sites with no crowds, into lovely restaurants and the best rooms at the best hotels.\n\nHis guides were absolutely top notch in every respect, and some of our highlights were the outdoor food market in Ortigia followed by a cooking class with chef Lele Torrisi. Our olive farm experience luncheon was a highlight, too, as well as the mount Etna Winery. Marcello’s personal contacts add so much to the experiences he crafts for his travelers.\n\nWhen we had a service issue one night Marcello was right there to fix the issue specially arranging a dinner out in Trapani where tourists rarely go. While in Siracusa he personally checked in on us so our travelers could meet him and thank him for all he had done!!\n\nMarcello is a Sicilian gem, use his expertise to craft your amazing journey to one of my favorite islands. I can’t say enough good things about Marcello!\n\nOur trip to Sicily in June 2016 has left us with wonderful memories thanks to Marcello. We told him that food and wine are passions for us and he arranged a great itinerary including visits to a flour mill, an herb farm, chocolate maker, dairy farm and an almond and ricotta producer. In addition we visited several wineries and had a personal tour of the market in Ortigia followed by a cooking class. Archaeology and culture were not left out of the trip. Among the things weve raved to friends about were having a REAL vulcanologist show us Mt. Etna and highly educated archaeologists make ancient sites come alive. The caliber of the experiences plus that of the guides and drivers was one of the hallmarks of our trip. It was what we hoped for and more than we expected. Everywhere we went Marcello was given high praise and we would second that . He has made many valuable connections in Sicily and we were the lucky beneficiaries. We appreciated how Marcello checked in with us each day and loved having the opportunity to meet him in Siracusa. We cant thank him enough for making our Sicilian adventure so memorable. We would recommend a trip to Sicily, planned by Marcello to anyone who travels. This trip will be the benchmark for any future European travel for us.\n\nMarcello knows Sicily. Inside and out.\n\nMarcello has planned several things for me over the years. He can customize anything and will advise you to give you the best experience possible. Marcello knows the best places to go, which ones to avoid and how to spend the day to get an authentic Sicilian experience. This past summer, September 2015, Marcello arranged for us to spend a day going to the market and cooking with a local chef, which was amazing! I traveled with a group of students to Sicily several years ago and Marcello arranged cooking classes for a group of 20 year olds making Sicilian food aficionados out of the most resistant boys, planned visits to wineries on Mt. Etna, lunch at a farm near Siracusa, language lessons, accommodations…everything to make a disparate group of young adults interested and engaged. That was a true test…and he passed with flying colors!\n\nMarcello’s intimate knowledge of the culture of Sicily is the reason to have him plan a trip. Anyone can book a hotel for you or tell you the sights to see in any given city…that’s easy. But to know what to do, eat and see in order to feel like a local yourself is what Marcello does best. Marcello’s knowledge of the history of the island together with his long-term relationships with people ensure that you get the most expert attention in whatever you want to do.\n\nMille grazie, Marcello!\n\nMarcello Baglioni made our 2015 trip to Sicily a wonder-filled journey and an indelible memory. We’d considered booking a small group tour and looked into several companies. Then we found Marcello. From the minute we arrived to the minute we waved farewell, we were in the capable hands of his exceptional guides and followed a plan that let us see more, do more, learn more, and eat much better than we would have on our own. And we did so without spending our budget on the very posh or the very touristy. We stayed in bed-and-breakfasts where we were treated royally and whose staff made sure we always had the best of all possible breakfasts before venturing beyond their doors.\n\nWe only stayed in Sicily for 12 days—and could have stayed another 12. Our friends are astonished: “What’s there to do in Sicily for that long a time?” Our answer: If you have a few hours, we’ll tell you and you’ll put it on your must-visit list.\n\nWe toured Palermo; went both east and west of the city. We saw the influence of the many “invaders” whose cultures mixed to create a unique people and place. We visited a remote goat farm and tasted the fresh milk and cheese. We ate lunches along with local wines that left us wanting a nap, but choosing instead to see splendid architecture, churches, cathedrals, historic sites, and tiny villages. From Palermo we headed south and then east to take in archeological sites we’d never heard of and now wonder why we hadn’t. Beautiful towns and landscapes rivalled those we’ve seen in dozens of other countries.\n\nPalermo, Cefalu, Sant ‘Ambrogio, charming Catelbuono (where we ate manna from heaven, really!), Monreale’s glorious Cathedral begun in the 12th Century, Erice high above the sea, Segesta and its Greek Temple, Argrigento’s Valley of the Temples, Villa Romana del Casale, and Syracuse. All with wineries along the way for tasting and refreshing our zeal to see more. And great food.\n\nIn Syracuse we stayed in magical Ortygia. From there we journeyed to the vast Pantalica Valley and its ancient tombs, Baroque Noto, an olive farm, a fishing village, plus a day on Mt Etna with a perfect finale at Benati’s vineyards and winery. Plus an herb farm, an olive farm, Caltagirone and its stunning pottery and mosaics, two cooking lessons, and (did we say?) good food.\n\nOur last two days in Syracuse were made for memories. First, we saw a modern production of Seneca’s version of the Euripides’ Greek tragedy Medea in an open, ancient Greek theater overlooking the city and the sea—with a clear sky and full moon above. The next day, we sailed the bay off Ortygia aboard a private sailboard and enjoyed a swim and, of course, a seaworthy lunch.\n\nSo how did we do all this in 12 days without a single flaw, bad moment, aching feet, or indigestion? It would have been impossible without the meticulous planning, entrée to rarely seen sites, Tommaso’s driving us beyond where the buses go, and brilliant guides such as Dr. Claudio Italo (archaeologist extraordinaire), Enrico (a caption worth more than his salt) and Marcello who joined us one afternoon.\n\nIf we had stayed in Sicily for three weeks on our own, we would have had a wonderful time, but nothing as grand and glorious as what we now call The Marcello Experience.\n\nHaving been to Italy several times my husband and I had never had the pleasure of exploring Sicily. Not sure where to start in planning our trip we decided to go with Wendy Perrin’s trusted travel expert for Sicily, Marcello Baglioni. I can only say that without him we would never have had the wonderful experience that we did. We started the process by telling him some of the things we wanted to see and do during our time there. He worked his magic and put together an amazing self-drive trip for us. We visited a working dairy farm–(and enjoyed a delicious meal there!), had a private guided tour of the Valley of the Temples in Agrigento, took a private cooking class with a well known local chef in Siracusa, and enjoyed an informative, as well as beautiful, hike on Mt Etna with a volcanologist. In addition Marcello took our trip to the 21st century by creating a personalized google map that we could access anywhere with our mobile phones. With this tool we were able to easily navigate between cultural attractions, as well as recommended restaurants, cafes, and museums he personally highlighted for us, using the GPS on our phone. We were so pleased with our trip I recommended his services to a colleague who just came back from his own special journey to Sicily. Bravo Marcello!\n\nMarcello organized our Sicily trip in April 2011 and was one of the first of Wendy’s Trusted Travel Experts we used. We decided on the trip only a couple of months ahead of time and felt overwhelmed by choices. So we contacted Marcello. He introduced us to the concept of Slow Travel (see his note on Biggest Rookie Mistake) — travel less, see more in depth. The trip he organized for us was packed with absolutely wonderful experiences we never could have had on our own. We focused principally on southeastern Sicily and had terrific guides, wonderful cooking classes, a great hike on Mount Etna, magnificent cheese, chocolate and wine tastings, great horseback riding and one of the most charming hotel stays we’ve ever had — a room in an Ortigia (Siracusa) hotel that had an enormous private terrace with sofas, tables and chairs and a huge, very private hot tub overlooking the ocean that took all our aches away after long days hiking, sightseeing, cooking, eating and horseback riding. (We also got to Agrigento and Palermo and were in Palermo for Good Friday confraternity processions.) Marcello is a charming man (he met us for coffee one day) and we are very grateful to him for introducing us to Slow Travel. We have incorporated it into virtually all our subsequent trips — many organized by more of Wendy’s excellent Trusted Travel Experts. Thank you, Marcello. This is an overdue thank you note to you."
