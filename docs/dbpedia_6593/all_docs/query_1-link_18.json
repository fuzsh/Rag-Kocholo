        "text": "This daily excursion to Agrigento and Piazza Armerina from Taormina gives the opportunity to visit two different and amazing cities of art as well as UNESCO World Heritage sites since 1997\n\nAcross Sicily by bus with tour leader and local guide service. The city of Agrigento, situated on the south coast, is famous for its archaeological park called Valley of the Temples consists of well-preserved temples built by the Greeks between 510 and 430 BC. Upon arrival in Agrigento, visit the Valley of the Temples: Temple of Castor and Pollux, Temple of Concord (exemplary Classical monument), Temple of June, Temple of Jove, Temple of Hercules.\n\nTake a break for lunch (not included) and then hop back on the coach for the drive to Piazza Amerina to see the incredible Villa Romana del Casale, an old hunting lodge that is home to the planet's biggest collection of Roman mosaics. Go inside the hunting lodge (at own expense) and wander around the rooms. Linger in the thermal baths for a while trying to imagine what daily life was like here over 2,000 years ago. Walk through the dining hall and courtyard. Gawk at the awesome mosaics, especially the bikini girls.\n\nHop back on the coach for the journey back to Taormina.\n\nNB: Confirmed departure with minimum 12 people. There is a possibility of cancellation after confirmation if there are not enough passengers."
