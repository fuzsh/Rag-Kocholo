        "text": "Agrigento\n\nThe beautiful bronze statue depicting the fallen Icarus.\n\nAgrigento - Italian Capital of Culture in 2025\n\nAgrigento is an ancient city on the south coast of Sicily, 2 km. from the sea. It was founded (perhaps on the site of an early Sicanian settlement) by colonists from Gela about 580 B.C. The buildings for which it is famous all belong to the first two centuries of its existence.\n\nPhalaris, who is said to have roasted his enemies to death in a brazen bull (Pindar, Pyth. i. 184), ruled as tyrant from 570 to 554. What form of government was established after his fall is uncertain; we know only that, after a long interval, Theron ruled as tyrant between 488 and 473.\n\nIn 472 a democracy was established. In the struggle between Syracuse and Athens (415-413) the city remained absolutely neutral. Its prosperity continued to increase (its population is given at over 200,000) until in 406 B.C., despite the help of the Siceliot cities, it was captured and plundered by the Carthaginians, a blow from which it never entirely recovered.\n\nAgrigento was colonized by Timoleon in 340 B.C. with settlers from Velia in Lucania, and in the time of the tyrant Phintias (289-279) it had regained some of its power. In the First Punic War, however, it was sacked by the Romans (261), then by the Carthaginians (255), and finally in the Second Punic War by the Romans (210).\n\nThe Arabs took the city in 828, improving the economy by cultivating cotton, sugar-canes and mulberries for the silk industry, but in 1087 the Normans took the city after a siege of 116 days, depriving the inhabitants of food.\n\nThe Valley of the Temples.\n\nDepiction of the Madonna nursing Jesus. 14th century frescoe in the church Santa Maria dei Greci, which is built with antique materials on the site of a Doric temple (Agrigento city). A similar painting can be seen in Chiesa Santa Maria della Catena (Church of Saint Mary of the Chain) in Palermo\n\nThrough the floor in the church Santa Maria dei Greci, Agrigento, you can see a 15th century Capuchin crypt used for mummification (the bodies were placed upright in the seats, and the fluids drained into the hole in the centre of the room).\n\nPhoto: Per-Erik Skramstad / Wonders of Sicily\n\nThe church of S. Pietro (18th century). Part of the portal.\n\nThe world famous cliff in Realmonte (near Agrigento) called \"Scala dei turchi\" (Stair of the Turks). The cliff was used in Giuseppe Tornatore's film MalÃ¨na, in the scene where the boys are measuring the size of their penises. More film locations in Sicily here...\n\nSee more photos of Scala dei turchi here!\n\nScala dei turchi (Stair of the Turks) is a popular place to visit, both for tourists and Sicilians. This photo was taken early in the morning, before all the visitors had arrived.\n\nPhoto: Per-Erik Skramstad / Wonders of Sicily\n\nTemple of Concord in the Valley of Temples, Agrigento. Photo must have been taken before 1907.\n\nPhoto: Per-Erik Skramstad / Wonders of Sicily\n\nCrucifix with relics in Basilica dell'Immacolata (Chiesa di San Francesco), Agrigento.\n\nCrucifix in Basilica dell'Immacolata from another angle.\n\nThe Mystic Lamb (agnello mistico). Marble, 12th century.\n\nMUseo DIocesano Agrigento\n\nAgrigento Cathedral (Cattedrale di San Gerlando, C11-C13).\n\nC14 wooden sculpture from Chiesa di Santa Croce of Saint Gerland of Agrigento (Italian: San Gerlando di Agrigento), also known as Gerland of BesanÃ§on (d. 25 February 1100), bishop of Agrigento.\n\nDiploma (c. 1093) by Roger I dedicating the cathedral in Agrigento to the Norman Saint Gerland, the first bishop of Agrigento \"Ego Rogerius calabrie come set Sicilie â¦\"\n\nParts of the wooden ceiling (1511-1514) in Agrigento cathedral. Now in MUseo DIocesano Agrigento.\n\nChild Jesus sleeping on the cross. Very interesting nose! (18th century)\n\nMUseo DIocesano Agrigento\n\nMadonna del latte. 18th century\n\nMUseo DIocesano Agrigento\n\nSick man in bed. Note how the face has been \"censored\". I wonder who did this...\n\nMUseo DIocesano Agrigento\n\nThe lion to the left of the church of the Purgatorio sleeps above the locked entrance to a huge labyrinth of underground water-channels and reservoirs, built by the Greek architect Phaiax in the 5th century BC.\n\nCrucifix in the church of the Purgatorio (San Lorenzo), Agrigento. Relics behind the glass.\n\nThe distance between Agrigento and some other cities in Sicily\n\nAgrigento-Palermo 131 km\n\nAgrigento-CefalÃ¹ 134 km\n\nAgrigento-Siracusa 217 km\n\nAgrigento-Noto 242 km\n\nAgrigento-Taormina 219 km\n\nAgrigento-Catania 167 km\n\nAgrigento-Trapani 130 km\n\nAgrigento Festival (1957)\n\nAgrigento Timeline\n\n580 BC: Agrigento is founded as a colony of Gela and came to prominence under the tyrants Phalaris and Theron\n\n480 BC: The artificial lake Kolymbetra was dug by Theron's Carthaginian prisoners taken at Himera\n\n406 BC: The Carthaginians capture the city after an eight-month siege and burn the city\n\n340 BC: Agrigento was rebuilt by Timoleon, who defeated the Carthaginians\n\n261 BC: The Romans take the city\n\n255 BC: Carthaginians recapture the city\n\n218-201 BC Agrigento suffered badly during the Second Punic War when both Rome and Carthage fought to control it.\n\n210 BC: The Romans take the city again, this time Agrigentum remained in their possession until the fall of the empire. Agrigentum remained a largely Greek-speaking community for centuries after the Roman conquest.\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the city successively passed into the hands of the Vandalic Kingdom, the Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy and then the Byzantine Empire. During this period the inhabitants of Agrigentum largely abandoned the lower parts of the city and moved to the former acropolis, at the top of the hill (this was probably related to the destructive coastal raids of the Saracens).\n\nLate 6th century: The Temple of Concord is converted into a church by the bishop of Agrigento, San Gregorio delle Rape (St Gregory of the Turnips)\n\n828 AD: The Arabs take the city and make the trade flourish by cultivating cotton, sugar-cane and mulberries for the silk industry (they even had to make a new harbour, at Porto Empedocles)\n\n1087: The Normans take Agrigento after a 116 days siege\n\n1867: Luigi Pirandello was born\n\n1885: The author Guy de Maupassant travels in Italy, Sicily included. After returning to Paris, Maupassant began publishing his Sicilian travel memoirs in installments in Le Figaro and Gil Blas\n\n1927: Mussolini orders that the city should be called Agrigento, not Girgenti\n\n1936: Luigi Pirandello dies\n\nSources: Wikipedia, The Blue Guide Sicily\n\nSicilian Sites on UNESCO's World Heritage List\n\nAgrigento: Archaeological Area of Agrigento (UNESCO)\n\nAeolian Islands: Isole Eolie.
