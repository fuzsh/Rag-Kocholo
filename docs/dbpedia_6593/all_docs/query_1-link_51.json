        "text": "During my visit to Italy, I spent 4 days in beautiful Taormina. From the terrace in the main square there is a fabulous view of the ever-present and, for this year at least, the ever-active Mt Etna… 18 eruptions in 2011 and counting! On the afternoon of October 8th, Etna had a brief but violent eruption.\n\nThe next morning my travelling companion and I decided to “play tourist” and drive out to Etna to take the cable-car to the top. The drive from Taormina is very straightforward – it is well signed – and was approximately half-an-hour. At the base of the mountain is a large car-park with shops/toilets/cafes (no culinary experiences to be had here, just average Italian fast-food).\n\nTo get up to the top of Etna you first need to take the cable-car – the station is at the car-park. From the cable-car station at the top you can then either walk up to the crater or you can join a 4WD mini-bus tour. You then need to hop off the mini-bus and walk a few minutes to the crater.\n\nA word of warning… weather can change in an instant at such altitudes. When we left Taormina it was a very pleasant autumn day (about 24 degrees Celsius), when we arrived at the car-park the car temperature gauge was showing 8 degrees Celsius. It was still a lovely sunny day while we were heading up in the cable-car – you can see the photo.\n\nOnce we got to the cable-car station at the top it started to snow. By the time we got to the crater we were in blizzard-like conditions, and as our mini-bus came back down the mountain we had to stop to pick up walkers who were caught in the snowstorm.\n\nGood to know: you can hire jackets and boots from the cable-car station at the top (we opted for jackets only, make sure you have closed-in shoes – if not, then the boots are probably a good idea). I would recommend that you take some extra layers of clothing no matter the time of year, just in case. And if you are planning to walk up the volcano make sure you consult an expert guide in advance.\n\nUnfortunately we were unable to see anything of the crater at the top as visibility was so poor, nonetheless it was an exciting experience and a lot of fun once we had thawed out!\n\nby Lisa Kurtz.\n\nSicily is one of the most interesting places to visit in Italy. Sicilians being separated from the mainland by boat on an Island are in fact different race of people with a separate language Siciliano, that no other Italians can understand. Sicilians have always been a tough race having been invaded by every country throughout its long 3000 year old history. Sicily has all the great things to experience, ancient history, food to die for, beautiful beaches with white sand and crystal clear waters.\n\nPalermo, the capital of Sicily would have to be one of the most exciting cities in the world from its beautiful opera house to the Vucciria markets filled with all sorts of characters selling their wares. Cefalu is a great beach holiday and Agrigento is the place to see the greek temples. Taormina is the jewel in the crown of Sicily which has to have one of the most incredible settings high on a hill looking out over the strait of Messina to the mainland. It is simply spectacular.\n\nThe Aeolian Islands are spectacular to either stay for a week in a beautiful villa or simply visit on day trip. They are beautiful. Once you visit Sicily, you will never want to leave and if leave you must, you have to try the famous cake, Cassata, homemade of course. It is so good that I once saw a woman eat a whole large cake by herself.\n\nWhat To See In Sicily\n\nIt is best to visit Sicily in the other three seasons but in winter a lot of Sicily accommodation closes.\n\nAsk us about the fabulous concerts in the Greek Theatre of Taormina, the interesting markets in Palermo and the best Greek temples to see. Sicily is a great place for a holiday as it offers the best of all worlds – History, Art, great food and beautiful beaches with white sand.\n\nGetting There And Around\n\nBeing separated by the mainland, Sicily can be reached both by plane or by ferry. The main airports are the Fontanarossa in Catania and Falcone Borsellino Airport Palermo, which are well linked with all the main Italian towns as well as the major European cities.\n\nFor those who wish to get to Sicily by car there are ferry boats that link Palermo, Catania and Termini Imerese with the main Tyrrhenian ports as Genoa, Livorno, Civitavecchia (Rome) and Naples. Besides there is the ferry from Villa San Giovanni to Messina which allows to cross the Strait of Messina both to cars and trains.\n\nThe best way to visit Sicily is probably by car. Public transports as buses and trains are also available but they are not always efficient."
