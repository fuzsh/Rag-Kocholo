Whilst the latter was away defending Palermo from the attacking Angevins, Bertrando di Balzo sacked Aci in his absence.\n\nAci Trezza\n\nAci Trezza is a town in Sicily, southern Italy, a frazione of the comune of Aci Castello, c. 10 km north of Catania, with a population of around 5,000 people.\n\nLocated on the coast of the Ionian Sea, the village has a long history of maritime activity. Aci Trezza is a popular spot for Italian vacationers in the summer. The patron Saint of the town is St. John the Baptist. The Festa of San Giovanni is celebrated each year during the last week of June 24 in his honor.\n\nOf the coast of Aci Trezza are three tall, column-shaped islands. According to local legend, these great stones are the ones thrown at Odysseus in The Odyssey. The islands are referred to as the “isole dei ciclopi” (islands of the Cyclops, or Cyclopean Isles) by locals. This complements the notion that the Cyclops once had a smithy below Mount Etna, which looms over the village to the northwest\n\nTaormina\n\nTaormina is a town on the Ionian coast of Sicily and it is a famous tourist destination.\n\nIt is known also as the Ionian Pearl and it has been hosting the Grand Tour and the G7 recently.\n\nThe town of Taormina is appreciated not only for the stunning scenery and the wonderful archaeological sites of Greek-Hellenistic and Roman times such as the Ancient Theater, but also for its nightlife, discos, restaurants and it is also a shopping spot.\n\nTaormina is far about 54 km from Catania; it takes about 50 minutes from the A18 to reach the town from Catania.\n\nTrapani\n\nTrapani is a city and comune on the west coast of Sicily in Italy. It is the capital of the Province of Trapani. Founded by Elymians, the city is still an important fishing port and the main gateway to the nearby Egadi Islands.\n\nDrepana was founded by the Elymians to serve as the port of the nearby city of Eryx (present-day Erice), which overlooks it from Monte Erice. The city sits on a low-lying promontory jutting out into the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nIt was originally named Drépanon from the Greek word for “sickle“, because of the curving shape of its harbour. Carthage seized control of the city in 260 BC, subsequently making it an important naval base, but ceded it to Rome in 241 BC following the Battle of the Aegates in the First Punic War.\n\nTwo ancient legends relate supposed mythical origins for the city. In the first legend, Trapani stemmed from the sickle which fell from the hands of the goddess Demeter while she was seeking for her daughter Persephone, who had been kidnapped by Hades. The second myth features Kronos, who eviscerated his father Ouranos, god of the sky, with a sickle which, falling into the sea, created the city. In ancient times, Saturn (i.e., the Punic god Baal Hammon) was the patron god of Trapani. Today, Saturn’s statue stands in a piazza in the centre of the city.\n\nTrapani\n\nTrapani is a city and comune on the west coast of Sicily in Italy. It is the capital of the Province of Trapani.
