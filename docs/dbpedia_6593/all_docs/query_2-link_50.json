        "text": "Italy's classic cities of Rome, Venice, Florence, and Milan have long attracted tourists from around the world. All the while, Sicilians quietly produced wine, dined on superb seafood, and grew almonds, pistachios, olives, and citrus. Word has been getting out, though, about the island's picturesque coastline, historic towns, and abundant attractions.\n\nFrom the lively capital of Palermo and the hilltop city of Taormina to Trapani in the west, the large tricornered island off the toe of Italy's boot is bursting with magical — and diverse — destinations. Sicily offers beaches, mountains, active volcanoes, and even snow skiing. Well-preserved archeological sites, cathedrals, and buildings show evidence of its history as a home for Greeks, Romans, Arabs, Normans, Spanish, and other peoples. The indigenous Sicanians, about whom little is known, are thought to have occupied the island as far back as 8000 B.C., giving Sicily its name.\n\nThe yellow and red flag of Sicily depicts a three-legged woman with the head of the mythical Medusa, called the \"Trinacria.\" The three legs symbolize the three corners of Sicily, and, according to legend, the three mythological nymphs who created the island. You'll see this symbol everywhere on the island, from its flag to the souvenirs you'll want to take home as memories of your extraordinary visit to Sicily.\n\nDelicious Food\n\nSicily has its own style of Italian cuisine; its location and history influence its most popular dishes. It's not unusual to see couscous on a menu, reflecting Arabic tastes, as well as pasta served with ingredients that reflect each locale's specialty. Delicious fresh seafood is plentiful — the island has more than 600 miles of coastline — and sardines are served on their own or in the flavorful pasta con le sarde, which includes fennel, pine nuts, and raisins. Pasta alla Norma features tomato, eggplant, and salted ricotta cheese. Fried rice balls called arancini are popular snacks, and a favorite antipasto is caponata, a luscious mixture of tomatoes, capers, and eggplant.\n\nSicilians love desserts and are known to make the best cannoli — fried pastry tubes filled with sweetened ricotta. Granita, crushed ice flavored with fruit, almond, or coffee, and cassata, sponge cake with liqueur, ricotta, and marzipan (almond paste) are also top picks. Frutta Martorana, a Sicilian specialty, are miniature fruits and vegetables embellished by hand. Sicily's almonds, pistachios, and citrus appear in desserts like gelato and biscotti. And where else would you encounter the summertime breakfast treat brioche con gelato — gelato in a brioche bun?\n\nStunning Archaeological Sites\n\nSicily is home to some of the world's best-preserved examples of Greek and Roman temples, structures, and art. In the southwest, Agrigento's Valley of the Temples includes the nearly intact Temple of Concordia and columns remaining from several other Greek temples. On Sicily's southeast coast, Siracusa — once the leading city of Greece — a massive amphitheater built around the fifth century B.C. is still used for theatrical presentations. A third-century Roman amphitheater still stands in the area. On the nearby island of Ortigia are the remains of the Temple of Apollo, built in the seventh century B.C.\n\nFarther north in the coastal hilltop city of Taormina, the Teatro Greco, dating to the third century B.C., was later enlarged by the Romans. Today, the theater is home to film festivals, concerts, and plays, with the audience enjoying views of the Ionian Sea and Mount Etna along with the performances. In Segesta, a striking Doric temple has stood for more than 2,000 years near a massive amphitheater. Selinunte, once a major Greek city on the south coast, is another impressive archaeological site. The Regional Archaeological Museum in Palermo contains historical Sicilian sculpture and artifacts.\n\nLuxurious Beaches\n\nSurrounded by the Tyrrhenian, Ionian, and Mediterranean seas, Sicily boasts miles of varied and beautiful coastline, so visitors will find something they love, whether it's secluded spot or a lively resort. Near Taormina, Isola Bella features a gorgeous beach, and it's common for lidos, or beach clubs, to offer umbrellas, chairs, beverages, and dining. A cable car takes visitors from central Taormina to beaches at Mazzarò. The sea is clear and warm, but the sand is pebbly, so beach shoes are suggested. Nearby Giardini Naxos has both lidos and public areas.\n\nPalermo's beaches on the north shore, including Mondello, Magaggiari, and Cefalù, feature sandy shores. About 40 miles east of Palermo, Cefalù, once a fishing village, offers several beaches, cafés, restaurants, hotels, and nightlife. Near Ragusa, along the southeastern shore, popular beaches include Fontane Bianche, San Lorenzo, and Marina di Ragusa.\n\nDistinctive Wines\n\nSicilian wines are increasingly popular, and winemaking on the island dates back millennia to the Greeks. Marsala, in western Sicily, produces fortified wines by the same name, categorized by their age and residual sugar. In the Mount Etna area of eastern Sicily, volcanic soil and a favorable climate lead to excellent wines like Carricante (white) and Etna Rosso (red) made mostly from Nerello Mascalese grapes. The widely planted native grape, Nero d'Avola, produces dark, robust, complex wines.\n\nWhite wines, sometimes called Etna Bianco, are created primarily from the Carricante grape. Catarratto, the most planted grape, produces dry wines. Grillo, another dry white with medium body, is a lovely accompaniment for seafood. Sample local varieties and choose some favorites to look for when you arrive back home so you can relive your Sicilian experience.\n\nRich Culture and Traditions\n\nThe two-wheeled, horse-drawn cart painted with bright colors depicting religious scenes, flowers, and intricate designs is a recognizable symbol of Sicily. Originally used for transportation, the carts were pulled by horses also decorated with ribbons, bells, or plumes. Skilled craftsmen built and painted the carts, seen today at festivals, museums, and in miniature versions for souvenirs.\n\nSicily's cities and towns host festive events throughout the year, with many honoring patron saints, holidays, or seasons. In Agrigento, the springtime Almond Blossom Festival features 10 days of traditional costumes, music, and parades. The Sagra della Ricotta every April in Vizzini, one of Sicily's oldest cities, celebrates the cheese used in cannoli, cassata, and savory dishes. The Feast of Santa Rosalia in Palermo is a major event in mid-July with music, processions, and fireworks. Easter season brings carnival and Holy Week processions that show the authentic nature of Sicily's culture.\n\nBeautiful Islands\n\nSeveral groups of islands off Sicily's shores offer some of the most spectacular beaches in the area. The Pelagie Islands are southwest of Sicily in the Mediterranean. Lampedusa, the largest of these islands, features white-sand beaches and clear waters perfect for swimming and snorkeling. The Egadi Islands off Sicily's west coast are accessible for day trips from Trapani. Favignana, the largest of the Egadis, is home to luxury hotels, beaches, and popular diving spots.\n\nOff Sicily's northern coast in the Tyrrhenian Sea are the volcanic Aeolian Islands. Lipari is the largest and most popular with tourists who enjoy its hot springs and historic architecture. Small, but also a tourist favorite, is Panarea. Stromboli features an active volcano, and many visitors take guided hikes to its summit. The island of Salina is known for its delicious capers and mountain peak. Off Sicily's west coast, volcanic Pantelleria is a UNESCO World Heritage Site with fumaroles, mud baths, and agricultural products that include olives, grapes, and their well-known capers.\n\nImpressive Cathedrals and Architecture\n\nThe Cathedral of Monreale, near Palermo, is a stunning example of Norman architecture begun around 1171 by King William II of Sicily. Notable for its mosaics — many made of pure gold, — its marble floor, and the inlaid detail of the columns in the cloister, it is considered one of the most beautiful in the world. On Siracusa's historic Ortigia island, the seventh-century Cathedral of Syracuse was built on the site of a Greek Doric temple whose columns are still visible on the cathedral's exterior. An expansive piazza enhances the cathedral's facade, an impressive view from one of the many cafés lining the area.\n\nThe hilltop Cathedral of Cefalù dates to 1131 when King Roger II began construction. The Cathedral of Catania, dedicated to St. Agatha, was originally built in the 11th century on the site of ancient Roman baths. After damage by earthquakes and fires, it was rebuilt in 1711 with a Baroque-style facade. Sicily's cities of Palermo, Noto, Ragusa, and Modica all offer spectacular cathedrals in a variety of architectural styles.\n\nVilla Romana del Casale, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, dates to about the fourth century and contains an extensive collection of Roman artwork and mosaics. Set in the interior of Sicily, the villa is open for tours.\n\nWelcoming Accommodations\n\nSicily is resplendent in top-notch accommodations. From five-star resorts and exclusive villas to casual beach hotels, you'll find the right place to stay in Sicily. Verdura Resort on the south coast offers white-sand beaches, golf, a spa, and luxurious accommodations. Therasia Resort on the island of Vulcano features an expansive spa, pool, and views of the other Aeolians. The Belmond Grand Hotel Timeo in Taormina is a classic, with elegant rooms, gardens, and views of Mount Etna and the sea. Or book a grand villa overlooking the sea for a group or family.\n\nHotels in major cities include the boutique Villa Carlotta and the San Domenico Palace, Taormina, a Four Seasons Hotel in Taormina, the Monaci delle Terre Nere near Mount Etna, Grand Hotel Wagner in Palermo, and the Baglio Sorìa in Trapani. For a different experience, enjoy the environment and comfort of a farmhouse stay. Choose a locale by the sea, mountains, or amid olive trees and grape vines. Farmhouse lodging can range from rustic to ultra-luxurious.\n\nIf You Go\n\nInternational airports in Palermo and Catania receive flights from most cities in Europe. Eurostar trains from Rome and Naples and other cities in Italy arrive in Sicily via a ferry across the Strait of Messina, an enjoyable trip. From the Italian ports of Naples, Genoa, Livorno, Civitavecchia, and Villa San Giovanni, ships sail to Palermo, Catania, and Messina. It's even possible to drive from the mainland and other European countries, taking the ferry to Messina."
