AM take car ferry from Messina to Puglia area. Planned to drive all the way to Lecce (200 mi), but now think Lecce is too far for time that we have as we have to be in San Giovanni Rotundo on 3/18 and Rome 3/19, so maybe Messina to Ostuni 1 night; to Marina Franca to Alberobello 1 night; to Matera, 1 night; to Trani 1 night; to S.G. Rotundo/Monte Sant' Angelo, 1 night; and to Rome, 3 nights. This seems a heavy driving schedule-- will we have enough time to look around the major sites in each place? Patricia"
