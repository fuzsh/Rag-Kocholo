        "text": "The Barresi Family of Partanna, Sicilia\n\nThe Barresi family: Thus far, the earliest document pertaining to our Barresi family is the 1822 birth in Partanna, Sicily, of Vincenzo to Andrea Barresi, 32, born circa 1790, profession of bocciero (butcher), and wife Maria Rosa Catania, 32, daughter of Luigi Catania and Francesca Maltese. (An 1867 death registration of Andrea Barresi, 80 circa, beccajo (butcher), widower of Caterina Catania, may very well refer to our ancestor, and indicates that his father was also named Andreawhich may push the documentation of the Barresi family back one more generationbut this connection has not yet been corroborated.) Andrea Barresi and Maria Rosa Catanias older son Gaspare Barresi, who died in 1882 at about age 60, appears to have been born before 1820 and the start of civil registration of vital statistics in Partanna. Circa 1858, Gaspare, calzolajo (shoemaker), married Rosa Nastasi, daughter of Francesco Paolo Nastasi and Providenza Varvaro, and their son Andrea Barresi was born 15 Settembre 1861. Sadly, an earlier Andrea Barresi had been born to Gaspare and Rosa in 1859 but died 30 Luglio 1860 at the age of six months. Siblings of Andrea included Filippo 1865, Filippo II 1866, Luigi 1873, and Maria Rosa 1878. On 6 Nov 1887, Andrea Barresi, calzolajo, married Anna Palmeri, daughter of Filippo Palmeri, fornajo (baker), and Grazia Cangemi (age 17). Their first child, son Gaspare Barresi, was born in Partanna on 16 Agosto 1888, to Andrea, 27, calzolaio, and Anna, 27 (atto). By 1891 the family had relocated to Marsala, with the birth there of daughter Rosa on 28 Agosto 1891 to Gaspare, 30, calzolajo, and Anna Palmeri, the family residing on via Falconara. Daughter Angela was then born in Marsala on 11 Marzo 1894, to Andrea, 33, calzolajo, and Anna Palmeri. In 1905 Andrea would travel to the United States from Marsala accompanied only by his daughter Rosa, indicating that wife and mother Anna Palmeri (and also daughter Angela) had probably died by then, though a search of Marsala death records from 1894-1910 and those in Partanna from 1890-1910 produced no death records.\n\nGaspare Barresi immigrated to the United States through Ellis Island on October 28, 1901 on the ship Nord America, out of Palermo. Gaspare, age 10, is listed on the ships manifest as single and able to read. His last residence is given as Partanna, although his naturalization records indicate a residence of Marsala, which is corroborated by the births there of sisters Rosa and Angela. The manifest also indicates that this was Gaspares first time in the US, and that he was in good health and intended to join his uncle Giosafatta (sic) Palmerivery likely Anna Palmeris brother Giosafatat 106 St. [possibly #] 311, New York. Accompanying Gaspare was Giuseppe Barresi, age 31, single, baker, unable to read, a last residence of Partanna, never before in the US, also joining Giosafatta (sic) Palmeri, his cousin, and also in good health. (Interestingly, both Giuseppe and Gaspare are also listed on the October 18, 1901 manifest for the SS Sicilia, though this record appears to be lined through, perhaps indicating that they first intended to sail on the Sicilia but, for some reason, did not.) According to the 1910 US Census, Gaspare, age 22 and single, barber, was by then living in a household headed by father Andrea, 49, shoemaker, and also including sister Rosa, 17. According to passenger records, Andrea Barresi seems to have first come to the US at age 44 in 1905 with daughter Rosa, 13, to join Gaspare on 109th street in New York. (Andrea and Rosa again reached the US on September 14, 1907, on the SS Re DItalia, although this entry seems to be lined through. Curiously, Fara Pandolfo and her mother Antonina Scaduto were also aboard this ship. See below.) On November 28, 1912, the SS Taormina arrived at Ellis Island, bringing Andrea Barresi, 51, shoemaker, accompanied by what appears to be his second wife, Rosa Coppola, 56, who was unable to read or write, both of Marsala. Both Andrea and Rosa listed no living relative in Italy, and intended to join son Gaspare Barresi at his residence of 200 W. 43rd St, NY, NY. Andrea is here described as in good health, no deformities, 54, rosy complexion, mixt eyes, and grey hair, while Rosa, a native of Marsala who was never before in the US, paid for her ticket herself, was described as of good health, 410, dark complexion, and with an identifying mark of a patch on the left cheek. Her eye and hair color are obscured by what appears to be a doctors signature. Both entries are stamped non-immigrant, and it appears from later documents that neither naturalized. Gaspare Barresi, however, became a naturalized US citizen on September 23, 1913, after filing his Declaration of Intention to become a citizen on 24 January 1910, and his Petition for Naturalization on 17 April 1913. Naturalization records describe Gaspare as 56, 134 lbs., with blue eyes and brown hair. The documents also list his birthday alternately as August 16 and 17, 1888. In 1920, the US census indicates that Andrea, 58, a shoemaker owning his own business, and wife Rose, 61, were living alone at East 26th St. In 1930, Gaspare Barresi and family were living at 97 McDougal Street in Brooklyn, with Andrea, 69, also in the home. It appears, then, that Andreas second wife Rosa Coppola had passed away by this time.\n\nThe Pandolfo family: The earliest documented members of the Pandolfo family are Ignazio Pandolfo, who died 19 December 1792, and wife Catarina Giancontieri, who died some time before the death of their son Ignazio Pandolfo in 1831. Son Ignazio first appears in the civil records at the birth of his own son Vincenzo in November 1822 to wife Mattia Chiofalo, daughter of Pietro Chiofalo, falegname (carpenter), and Giuseppa Cappadoro. On the registration of Vincenzos birth, Ignazio is listed as 28 years old, also a falegname. Their elder (and likely first born) son Ignazio Pandolfo had been born to Ignazio and Mattia circa 1813, before the start of civil registration. Mother Mattia died 7 April 1826, at the age of only 33, and father Ignazio died 24 January 1831 at the age of 37. On 24 Ottobre 1839, Ignazio Pandolfo, 26, carrying on the family tradition of earning a living as a falegname, married Fara Russo, 27, daughter of Antonino Russo, 56, beccajo, and Caterina Marrone, 54. Their son Giuseppe Pandolfo was born to Ignazio and Fara on 10 Marzo 1851. Giuseppes siblings included Ignazio, 1841, Antonino 1843, Mattia, 1846, Mattia II, 1848; and Caterina, 1854, all of the children being named after their four grandparents. On 10 January 1877, Giuseppe, 25, yet another falegname, married Antonina Scaduto 22, daughter of Giuseppe Scaduto, murario (mason), and Maria Antonia Palmeri. Antoninas date of birth was 21 Ottobre 1854. Fara Pandolfo, the youngest of the couples children, was born to Antonina and Giuseppe on 1 Aprile 1893. On November 20, 1902, Antonina Scaduto, 48, arrived at New York from Partanna with daughter Fara Pandolfo, 9, aboard the SS Sicilia, intending to join Giuseppe Pandolfo at 182 Johnson Ave in Brooklyn. Antonina and Fara arrived again at Ellis Island on September 14, 1907, aboard the SS Re DItalia, again joining shon Giuseppe Pandolfo, now at 104 Harrison Place, Brooklyn. Here Antonina, 52, is listed as in good health, 51 ½, fair complexion, grei hair, brown eyes, while Fara, 14, single, is described as in good health, 54 ½, ruddy complexion, brown hair, brown eyes. Their nearest relative remaining behind in Italy was husband and father Giuseppe in Partanna. Since Gaspare last appears as a single man at age 22 on the 1910 census, and his naturalization certificate in September 1913 indicates he was living with wife Fara (although it appears that they did not provide formal documentation of their marriage), the couple may have married in New York sometime after 1910. In fact, Fara confided in one of her daughters that she and Gaspare had eloped. On July 18, 1914, Fara gave birth to the couples first child, son Andrea [click this link to view a photograph of Gaspare and Andrea, dated 30 Maggio 1916.].\n\nOn June 11, 1939, Andrea Barresi married Marie Saladino. Marie, daughter of Salvatore Saladino and Rosa Mendolia, both immigrants from Sicily, was born at home on September 12 , 13 or 14, 1914. Both Salvatore and Rosa emigrated from the town of Montevago, province of Agrigento, in Sicily. The earliest documented members of the Saladino family were Silvestro Saladino and Rosaria Montalbano, as indicated in the civil registration of the Comune of Montevago for the death of their son, Calogero Saladino at age 50 in 30 November 1831 (and sister Rosarias death at age 44 earlier that same year). A prospective death certificate exists in 1824 for Silvestro Saladino, 60, villico (farmer), son of Antonino e Rosaria Mazzotti. However, no wife (or widowed status) is indicated, and by the ages given Silvestro would have been only seventeen years older than son Calogero, so this relationship must remain speculative. It is worth noting here, though, that the earliest documented ancestors on the Saladino side of the family tree, Rosario Impastato and Brigida Crescimani, must have been born as early as the 1730s. Calogero Saladino, born circa 1781, married Francesca Giganti (born about 1796) at least as early as 1812, and so prior to civil registration. Their son Silvestro Saladino was born about 1812, and on 24 June 1841 Silvestro, villico (farmer), married Antonina Manciarracina, who was born circa 1820 in the town of Menfi. (It should be noted that Silvestros first wife, Calogera Sacco, whom he married in 1836, died in 1838.) Antoninas parents were Leonardo Manciarracina and Castenzia Mule. On 15 November 1849, Antonina gave birth to son Calogero Saladino. Calogero, agricoltore, married Maria Bavetta on 28 January 1877. Maria, age eighteen at her marriage, was born to parents Giovanni Bavetta and Pietra Cacioppo on 28 Aprile 1858. Salvatore Saladino, son of Calogero and Maria, was born 18 January 1889 in Montevago. Salvatore first ventured to the United States in 1907, arriving at Ellis Island aboard the Liguria on March 12 at age 18. The passenger manifest lists Salvatore as 18 and single, a barber, able to read and write, and intending to join brother Silvestro on what appears to be Willoughby street, in Brooklyn. (On this voyage, Salvatore was accompanied by Lucia Saladino, 16, who planned to join her brother Giovanni; the relationship between Salvatore and both Lucia and Giovanni has not yet been established.) Salvatore must have returned to Sicily for some period of time, for on November 11, 1913, he arrived at Ellis Island once more, this time at age 24 and on the ship Moltke. The manifest indicates that Salvatore was in fact before in the US from 1906-1909, suggesting that he spent a handful of years in Sicily before his return. The manifest also offers a description of the young Salvatore, describing him as 55, with dark hair, dark eyes and fair complexion. Accompanying Salvatore on the Moltke was Rosa Mendolia. Salvatore and Rosa are individually listed as married, though the indication of wife on Rosas record appears to be marked through. The manifest also indicates that Salvatore and Rosa intend to again join brother Silvestro in Brooklyn, this time on Central Ave, and notes that brother Leonardo is Salvatores closest relative remaining in Montevago.\n\nRosa Mendolia was the daughter of Giuseppe Mendolia, agricoltore, born 8 August 1844, and Giovanna Molinari, born 28 December 1854, who married 26 Novembre 1875. The Mendolia line has been documented back to Giuseppe Mendolia, Borgese, born circa 1773, and his wife Anna Rametta, who died 25 October 1850 at the age of about 70.Giuseppe and Annas son Filippo, also a Borghese, was born circa 1815, and married Rosa Bruno on 31 July 1843. At least Rosas father Biagio was a native of Positano. On the Mendolia branch of the family tree, the earliest documented ancestors are Antonio Gulotta and Brigida Crescimanni, who were born at least as early as the 1720s.\n\nRosa Mendolia arrived in the United States on November 11, 1913, with her husband Salvatore Saladino. The ships manifest lists Rosa as never before in the US and able to read and write, and offers the description of her as 5 2, with a medium complexion, brown hair and eyes, and a scar on her nose. Joining Salvatore and Rosa on this voyage was Rosas brother Salvatore Mendolia, 17, single, shoemaker, from Montevago, who gives as his closest living relative remaining in Montevago father Giuseppe. Salvatore Mendolia listed his destination as brother Giuseppes in Brooklyn (possibly at the same address as Silvestro Saladino, according to the notation on the manifest). By the time of the 1930 US census, Salvatore Saladino, a trimmer in a shoe factory, and wife Rosa were living with their children Marie, 15; Charles, 13; and Jennie, 11, on 112th Street in Queens, NY. Next door was the family of Salvatore Mendolia and his wife Rosa, with their children Jenny, Mary, Joseph and Charles.\n\nNot long after his marriage to Marie Saladino in 1939, Andrea Barresi enlisted in the Navy, serving from June 1943 to December 1945 as a Lieutenant (jg), including duty as a Port Officer at Naples, where he lost his wedding band in the sea.\n\nOther associated surnames on the family tree in Partanna include Accardo, Corso, Gati, Graffeo, Graziano and Petralia. In Montevago, the related family lines are Addamo, Catalanotto, Ingoglia, Libassi, Parlato, Russo and Zito.\n\n© 2004 Fumagalli-Geherin Project"
