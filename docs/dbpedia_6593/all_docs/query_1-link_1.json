In the background: The Temple of Concord.\n\nThe beautiful bronze statue depicting the fallen Icarus, who flew too close to the sun.\n\nIn between the columns of the Temple of Olympian Zeus (Tempio di Giove Olimpico, the largest Doric temple ever constructed, but never completed), were colossal atlases (aka telamons), stone figures standing some 7.5 m high.

The cavities in this \"wall\" (arcosolia, singular: arcosolium) characterized by an a curved upper surface are tombs made between the 4th and the 7th century AD.\n\nPhoto: Per-Erik Skramstad / Wonders of Sicily\n\nAn arcosolium is an arched recess used as a place of entombment. The word is from Latin arcus, \"arch\", and solium, \"throne\" (literally: \"place of state\") or post-classical \"sarcophagus\". Early arcosolia were carved out of the living rock in catacombs. In the very earliest of these, the arched recess was cut to ground level. Then a low wall would be built in the front, leaving a trough (the cubiculum, \"chamber\") in which to place the body. A flat stone slab would then cover the chamber containing the body, thus sealing it. The stone slab occasionally also served as an altar, especially for Christians. who celebrated Mass on them. In the later arcosolia, the arched recess was carved out to about waist height. Then the masons cut downwards to make the chamber into which the corpse would be placed. In effect, the trough was then a sarcophagus with living rock on five of its six faces. As before, a flat stone slab would then seal the cubiculum. From the 13th century onwards, and continuing into the Renaissance, arcosolia were built above ground, particularly in the walls of churches. In these post-Roman era recesses, which were built of brick and marble, the sarcophagi are usually separate from the arch.

Agrigentum remained a largely Greek-speaking community for centuries after the Roman conquest.\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the city successively passed into the hands of the Vandalic Kingdom, the Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy and then the Byzantine Empire. During this period the inhabitants of Agrigentum largely abandoned the lower parts of the city and moved to the former acropolis, at the top of the hill (this was probably related to the destructive coastal raids of the Saracens).\n\nLate 6th century: The Temple of Concord is converted into a church by the bishop of Agrigento, San Gregorio delle Rape (St Gregory of the Turnips)\n\n828 AD: The Arabs take the city and make the trade flourish by cultivating cotton, sugar-cane and mulberries for the silk industry (they even had to make a new harbour, at Porto Empedocles)\n\n1087: The Normans take Agrigento after a 116 days siege\n\n1867: Luigi Pirandello was born\n\n1885: The author Guy de Maupassant travels in Italy, Sicily included.

The name Concord occurs in a Latin inscription found here, but the temple has not been attributed to any particular divinity. The excellent state of preservation is explained by the fact that it was converted into a church by the bishop of Agrigento, St Gregory of the Turnips (San Gregorio delle Rape) in the 6th century.\n\nTemple of Herakles (Hercules) - built c. 500 BC.\n\nThe Temple of Herakles is probably the oldest temple of Akragas. The attribution of this temple to Herakles is due to a reference in Cicero's Verrine Orations (II.4.43), but it is nevertheless not certain that this is correct. In ancient times it was famed the cult statue.\n\nTemple of Olympean Zeus (Jupiter)\n\nTemple of Dioscuri (Castor and Pollux)\n\nTemple of Hephaistos (Vulcan)\n\nTemple of Asclepios (Aesculapium)\n\nTemple of Demeter\n\nMore of interest in the Valley of Temples\n\nArcheological Museum\n\nKolymbetra\n\nRocky Sanctuary of Demetra\n\nFortifications\n\nAgorÃ and public buildings\n\nEkklesiasterion\n\nBouleuterion\n\nOratory of Phalarys\n\nRoman Hellenistic quarter\n\nThe distance between Agrigento and some other cities in Sicily\n\nAgrigento-Palermo 131 km\n\nAgrigento-CefalÃ¹ 134 km\n\nAgrigento-Siracusa 217 km\n\nAgrigento-Noto 242 km\n\nAgrigento-Taormina 219 km\n\nAgrigento-Catania 167 km\n\nAgrigento-Trapani 130 km\n\nAgrigento Festival (1957)\n\nLuigi Pirandello, (1867â1936), Sicily's greatest playwright, novelist, and short-story writer.
