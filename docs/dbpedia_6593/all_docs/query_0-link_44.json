        "text": "Timaeus (born c. 350 bc, Tauromenium, Sicily [now Taormina, Italy]—died after 264) was a Greek historian whose writings shaped the tradition of western Mediterranean history.\n\nExpelled from Sicily by Agathocles, the tyrant of Syracuse, about 315 bc, Timaeus went to Athens, where he studied rhetoric under Isocrates’ pupil Philiscus of Miletus and passed 50 years of his life. Whether he ever returned home is uncertain. The 38 books of his (Sikelikai) Historiai (Sicilian History), which included the first Greek presentation of Roman history, covered events up to Agathocles’ death in 289, but a separate work on Pyrrhus of Epirus seems to have extended the historical treatment to the Roman crossing into Sicily in 264. (Polybius began his History “where Timaeus left off.”) Books I–V of Timaeus’s work contained the early history of Italy and Sicily; books VI–XXXIII treated the history of Sicily from the foundation of the Greek colonies to Agathocles’ accession, with digressions sometimes touching on Greece; and books XXXIV–XXXVIII formed a separate account of Agathocles. The Olympionikai (“Victors at Olympia”) was a synchronic list of victors in the Olympic Games, the kings and ephors of Sparta, the archons (magistrates) of Athens, and the priestesses of Hera at Argos. Timaeus’s work established the practice of dating by the Olympic Games that became standard in ancient historiography.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nHistory Buff Quiz"
