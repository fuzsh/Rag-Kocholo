        "text": "North Sicily\n\nWith its idyllic coastal towns, surrounding wall of mountains and picturesque beaches, it is unsurprising that tourists flock to northern Sicily throughout the year.\n\nHome to the Sicily’s capital as well as some of the island’s most popular and alluring towns, such as Geraci Siculo, considered to be one of Italy’s most beautiful Italian villages, northern Sicily is bursting with charm, character and history.\n\nPalazzo dei Normanni, Palermo\n\nAlso known as the ‘Royal Palace of Palermo’, the castle was originally constructed under the Arabs but later adapted under the Normans and now houses a number of stunning golden mosaics.\n\nCefalù Cathedral, Cefalù\n\nBuilt in the city of Cefalù between 1131 and 1240 under the Norman King Roger II, the cathedral has a striking interior of Byzantine-style mosaics and some truly stunning works of art.\n\nCathedral of Monreale, Monreale\n\nBuilt in 1174 in the town of Monreale 9km inland from Palermo, this majestic cathedral beautifully blends a variety of cultural styles, namely Byzantine, Arab and Norman.\n\nChurch of San Giovanni degli Eremiti, Palermo\n\nLocated in Palermo, a 12th century Norman church crowned with 5 Arabic red domes.\n\nChiesa di San Cataldo, Palermo\n\nSimilar to the Church of San Giovanni, this church is a perfect example of Arab-Norman architecture with Norman plan and Arabic domes.\n\nDoric Temple, Segesta\n\nSituated approximately 70km south west of Palermo, this is believed to be one of the best-preserved Greek temples in the world.\n\nNorth EAST Sicily\n\nNot only is north east Sicily home to Mount Etna, it also encompasses some of the most beautiful, popular towns on the island as well as a number of the most stunning beaches in the Mediterranean.\n\nTaormina was born as a tourist resort with ancient Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Saracens, Arabs, Normans and Spaniards choosing it as their residence thanks to its mild climate and favourable position 200m above the Ionian Sea with sweeping views from its hillside villas, palazzi, park and Greek Theatre. Now visitors can find fine examples of Taormina’s golden ages including:\n\nThe Greek Theatre\n\nBuilt originally during the Hellenistic period, the theatre was reconstructed by the Romans and used to stage gladiator shows. Today it is one of the most popular historic monuments on the island and is used to host plays, shows and concerts throughout the year and an annual film festival in June.\n\nCorso Umberto\n\nItaly's most elegant passeggiata and Taormina’s main street from Porta Messina at the north end of town to Porta Catania in the south, with an array of cafés, restaurants, pastry shops and boutiques.\n\nPalazzo Corvaja\n\nImposing 11th century palazzo originally built by the Arabs with a square subsequently used as a Roman forum. It now houses the Sicilian Museum for popular arts & traditions.\n\nPiazza del Duomo\n\nWith 13th century cathedral and Baroque fountain.\n\nPalace of the Dukes of Saint Stefano\n\nThis 13th century palace, situated near Porta Catania, resembles a fortress-like tower similar to the Badia Vecchia, both probably built as strongholds along the boundary walls, to protect the northern and southern parts of the town.\n\nPiazza IX Aprile\n\nThis square in the middle of Corso Umberto has a terrace with panoramic views of Naxos Bay and Mount Etna, Gothic church of Sant’Agostino, church of San Giuseppe and 12th century clock tower.\n\nSanta Caterina d’Alessandria\n\n17th century Baroque church of pink marble and sandstone built on the site of an ancient temple.\n\nBadia Vecchia\n\n15th century abbey with battlements and Gothic windows characteristic of Taormina housing the Regional Archaeological Museum, with objects that were discovered in both Greek and Roman sites.\n\nVilla Comunale Park\n\nPublic gardens donated by the Cacciola-Trevelyan family during the 1920's with 3 hectares of typically Mediterranean gardens including precious trees and plants, pagoda-style pavilions with caged birds and wonderful views.\n\nLa Naumachia\n\n122m Roman wall showing water cistern and gymnasium. The name refers to naval battles staged here for the Romans entertainment.\n\nSouth East Sicily\n\nSurviving centuries of civil war, foreign invasion and natural disasters, the south east of Sicily allures visitors from all over the world to visit the UNESCO World Heritage Sites of Syracuse and Val di Noto.\n\nThis area has great examples of Sicilian Baroque architecture and many historic towns situated amongst the rugged Iblei mountains which make up this interesting area of the island, along with a picturesque coastline and nature reserves.\n\nSyracuse & the Rocky Necropolis of Pantalica\n\nA UNESCO World Heritage site, Syracuse is notable for its rich Greek history, culture, amphitheatres and architecture and the large necropolis has over 5,000 tombs dating from the 13th to the 7th centuries BC.\n\nLate Baroque Towns of Val di Noto\n\n\"Represent the culmination and final flowering of Baroque art in Europe\" and include the towns of Caltagirone, Militello in Val di Catania, Catania, Modica, Noto, Palazzolo Acreide, Ragusa and Scicli which form a UNESCO World Heritage Site, drawing art and history enthusiasts from all over the world.\n\nCathedral of San Giovanni Battista, Ragusa\n\nThis grand cathedral is arguably the most striking monument in Ragusa. Built in 1718, this majestic cathedral boasts an expertly carved exterior as well as a beautiful, elaborate interior.\n\nChurch of Santa Maria delle Scale, Ragusa\n\nThe church was partly rebuilt following the 1693 earthquake and, as its name suggests, features a rather formidable staircase which offers its victors a stunning view that stretches across the landscape.\n\nSan Nicoló Cathedral, Noto\n\nThis stunning cathedral was constructed during the early 18th century but collapsed in 1996. It has since been rebuilt and opened its doors once again in 2007.\n\nPalazzo Ducrezio, Noto\n\nThis majestic town hall was constructed in 1746 and boasts a beautifully decorated interior complete with an 18th century fresco.\n\nVilla Romana del Tellaro, Noto\n\nIn Noto, after many years of restoration this 4th century Roman villa has revealed polychrome hunting scene mosaics and a scene from the Iliad.\n\nGreek Theatre, Syracuse\n\nThe hemispheric auditorium and stage were carved out of the hillside rock in the 5th century AD an expanded to its present size 200 years later. Today music festivals and Greek plays are staged here.\n\nRoman Amphitheatre, Syracuse\n\nSituated in the Archaeological Park and built in the imperial era, it was, like the Greek theatre in Taormina, carved directly into the rock. Circuses were held here and leading citizens of the time are inscribed in the parapet.\n\nSouth Sicily\n\nOne of the more untouched, authentic regions of the island with olive and almond groves across the countryside and stunning architectural monuments standing as testament to the island's diverse history.\n\nWith great places of interest to visit such as the Valley of the Temples in Agrigento, Southern Sicily is not to be missed!\n\n4th Century Villa Romana del Casale\n\n6km to the south west of Piazza Armerina, a grandiose 4th century Roman villa renowned for housing some of the most striking examples of decorative Roman mosaics. It is Sicily’s most important Roman monument and a listed UNESCO Heritage site with guided tour available.\n\nTemple of Concordia, Valley of the Temples, Agrigento\n\nConsidered to be one of the most striking, well preserved Greek temples in the world.\n\nThe Temple of the Olympian Zeus, the Valley of the Temples, Agrigento\n\nBelieved to have been one of the largest Doric temples ever constructed, completed during the reign of the Roman emperor Hadrian. Though today it lies in ruins in the Valley of the Temples, it is still an exceptionally striking sight.\n\nThe Temple of Hercules, the Valley of the Temples, Agrigento\n\nAlso situated in the Valley of the Temples and thought to have once contained a number of beautiful paintings of Hercules."
