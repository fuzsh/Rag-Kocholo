Alfredo, you are the man. I knew I had the right guy from the beginning. Thank you 100x for being persistent and assertive on behalf of my family. Others have tried and failed to find this. You made it happen.\n\nDear Alfredo,\n\nThank you so much for this. Reading this made me cry. I have searched for this record for many years and you found it. Now I learn that our beloved grandmother was a tiny infant girl left at an orphanage wheel, which I knew in my heart the whole time but had no proof. There is a gentle story the adoptive parents told her, that her birth parents were a young couple who were university scholars in law school who were in love but unmarried and had a baby out of wedlock and that they donated their baby for adoption directly by hand. This family story did not make sense because it was 1898. There was enormous stigma for women to have illegitimate children in those days. I don't know how many women became lawyers in 1898, but it also sounds unusual to me for a woman to be studying to be a lawyer at that time. Am I right or wrong about the stigma and female lawyers in those days?..........\n\nThomas xx\n\n10030 Scripps Vista Way xx\n\nSan Diego, California 92131 USA\n\nThank you Alfredo for your help.\n\nThis solved a long standing family mystery.\n\nChuck Salerno\n\nAlfredo\n\nI want to say a big thank you for such a quick response in obtaining the required certificates.\n\nKeep up your good work!!\n\nBravissimo\n\nMr E.\n\nLulworth Elm walk\n\nOrpington Kent\n\nBR2 8LX U.K\n\nI am so thankfull!

Great work!\n\nBest, Nick\n\nFaulerstraße xx Freiburg 79098 Deutschland\n\nI has been our pleasure to work with Alfredo. We have been researching dual citizenship for my wife for some time and we had hit many roadblocks with the limited data available from the various genealogical sites.\n\nSo enter Alfredo the magician. The missing links to the family history all seemed to come together effortlessly through Alfredo. Our story is a bit more complicated with the family moving to Egypt around 1900 then fleeing in the 1950's and subsequently settling in Australia.\n\nAlfredo corrected many old family myths with birth certificates, marriage certificates, Army records and death certificates. Alfredo uncovered many things that we did not request as part of his searches and offered these to us without any fear. I could recommend Alfredo and would suggest that he is the best option with his access to source documents, knowledge of the Italian system and ease to work with.\n\nMy only further advice is to translate into Italian any request as this is his mother tongue.\n\nRay Perry Houston Texas, USA\n\nLower Plenty, Victoria, Australia\n\nAlfredo,\n\nI received the documents!
