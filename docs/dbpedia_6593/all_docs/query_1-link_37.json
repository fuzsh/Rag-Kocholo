        "text": "Palermo\n\nPalermo\n\nPalermo is a city and seaport in Italy on the northwestern coast of Sicily, on the Tyrrhenian Sea. It is the largest city and chief port of Sicily. Many of the oldest buildings in the city date from the period when Sicily was a Norman kingdom and show Arab, Byzantine, Norman, and Spanish influences. Outstanding examples are the cathedral (1169-1185), the Palatine Chapel (1140), and the church of San Giovanni degli Eremiti (1132).\n\nDestination Guide Agrigento\n\nAgrigento\n\nAgrigento is a small town on the Southern coast of Sicily. The beach is wonderful and the small streets of the old town are quaint and charming. Just outside the city, you will find magnificent Greek temples located in the Valley of the Seven Temples.\n\nRagusa\n\nRagusa\n\nRagusa is a city located in Sicily that is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This Baroque city dates from 1693 and Ragusa (Superiore & Ibla) is a gem full of architectural delights.\n\nSiracusa\n\nSiracusa\n\nSicilia is the favorite island of Gods in traditional poetry. The most powerful and biggest ancient city in Sicilia is Siracusa. Its name may come from the native word \"Siraco\", which means \"marsh\", due to the bogs which surrounded the city. Or it may derive from a Phenician etymology signifying the presence of seagulls on its rocky shores. Few cities of the ancient world had the importance Syracuse had in Magna Grecia, the ancient Greek settlements in Italy. The most spectacular monuments in the archeological area surrounded by colorful Mediterranean vegetation are the Greek amphitheatre and the Orecchio di Dionisio (Dionysius' Ear). Besides touring the Archeological Museum that contains beautiful objects, Ortigia Island, the heart of the old Greek city, is worth a visit. Outside the city limits is Eurialo Castle, an incredible structure built to protect the city from the Cathaginians, and Pantalica, the great rocky necropolis in Anapo Valley."
