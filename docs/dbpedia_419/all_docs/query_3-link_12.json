        "text": "Nobody’s Saying if Cary Bought 4th TV Station\n\nThis article appeared in the Register-Herald on Nov. 7, 2002.\n\nBy JIM BALOW\n\nIf you believe rumors, Bray Cary has added a fourth television station to his empire at West Virginia Media Holdings.\n\nCary, however, had little to say about those rumors Wednesday.\n\n\"We don't comment on that kind of stuff,\" he said, in effect neither confirming nor denying he’s made a deal to buy WVSX, the CBS affiliate in the greater Bluefield area.\n\n\"We continue to have an interest in that market but have nothing to announce at this point,\" Cary said. \"We think it’s a wonderful market and think it would continue to build our statewide market.”\n\nLikewise, WVSX general manager Gary O'Halloran would not say whether a deal has been struck. \"I'm not at liberty to say,\" he said Wednesday when asked whether the station has been sold. The station is owned by High Mountain Broadcasting Corp. of Ridgefield, Conn., he said.\n\n\"I really can't tell you anything about it,\" High Mountain President John Tupper said in a phone interview Wednesday. \"I really don't have anything to say.”\n\nWVSX went on the air in January 1996, Tupper said. Although licensed in Lewisburg, it has studios in Ghent and serves the greater Bluefield market, he said. That market, the nation’s 149th largest, reaches about 141,000 television homes in Bluefield, Princeton, Beckley, Oak Hill, Lewisburg and surrounding areas, he said.\n\nCary, a state native and former NASCAR executive, has bought three TV stations and a weekly business newspaper since forming West Virginia Media Holdings last year.\n\nWith the help of private financial backers, he paid $20 million for WBOY in Clarksburg, $18.5 million for WTRF in Wheeling and Steubenville, Ohio, and $40.5 million for WOWK in Charleston and Huntington. Terms of the deal to buy The State Journal last year were not disclosed.\n\nCary also has expressed an interest in buying daily newspapers in the state, possibly in Charleston. Current Federal Communications Commission regulations forbid cross ownership of newspapers and TV stations in the same markets, but the FCC is considering changes that would relax those rules."
