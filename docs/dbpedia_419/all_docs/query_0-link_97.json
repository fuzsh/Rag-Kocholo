Huntington Herald-Dispatch which also owned WSAZ 930 AM was the owner of the service. It carried content form all the Big Four however, was primary affiliated with NBC mainly because of its long-maintained linkage with NBC Radio. WCHS took over the CBS affiliation while both WCHS and WSAZ would lose the ABC affiliation when WHTN (later WOWK) signed on air a year later. DuMont was also removed when it terminated its operations in 1955. WSAZ is the only commercial outlet in the market that has never changed its primary affiliation.\n\nHerald-Dispatch released long-held WSAZ-AM-TV to Goodwill Stations which owned WJR Radio and WJRT in Detroit and Flint, Michigan in 1961. Goodwill and Capital Cities Communications got unified in 1964. Capital in turn released the radio sibling to Stoner Broadcasting while Ch 3 was acquired by Lee Enterprises. Emmis Communications acquired the service in 2000 but sold it to Gray Television in 2005; it would then join Parkersburg-based WTAP-TV as sister. The LP translator opened in 1995 in Kanawha Valley is no silent. The first studio branch was inaugurated in 1956 in Charleston. It acquired a construction permit for a new digital signal on Ch 27 on Aug 16, 2018 after the expiration of an unused permit in Aug 2015."
