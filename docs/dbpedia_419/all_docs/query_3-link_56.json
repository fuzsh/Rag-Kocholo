        "text": "CHARLESTON, W.Va. ( ) — Charleston police said a 3-year-old girl with no shoes on walked a half mile by herself and was attempting to cross the street into traffic after her mother put her to bed and then left to visit a friend.\n\nThe girl’s mother, Deanna Newton, 33, of Findlay, Ohio, is charged with child neglect creating risk of injury after an incident that occurred Tuesday at an apartment on Cart Street in the East End, according to a criminal complaint filed in Kanawha County Magistrate Court.\n\nPolice said Newton put her child to bed about 10:30 p.m. and then left the apartment to go to a friend’s house. The residence has a front door that could not be secured. While the mother was gone, the girl got out of bed and walked out of the apartment, and was wearing no shoes.\n\nThe complaint said the girl walked east on Piedmont Road for about a half mile on the sidewalk and then attempted to cross the street in traffic. A passerby stopped and called 911 after not finding a guardian nearby.\n\nNewton is currently being held at South Central Regional Jail on a $25,000 bond or 10 percent cash."
