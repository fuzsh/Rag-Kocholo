        "text": "HURRICANE, W.Va. ( ) -- Hurricane City Hall in Putnam County, West Virginia will witness what could be its first, and last, wedding.\n\nMarsha Bradbury and Jon Gillenwater have arranged to marry in Hurricane because of a powerful hurricane, Florence, .\n\n“For four days, 'Honey, don’t worry, it’s going to go north. We’ll be fine,' ” Gillenwater said.\n\n“That didn’t happen,” his bride to be said laughing.\n\nFlorence was bearing down on their dream wedding location, a massive vacation home on the Outer Banks, ruining months of preparation.\n\n“Sunk a bunch of money into it,” Bradbury said. “Sunk a bunch of money into décor. Pretty much anything you could imagine.”\n\nHeartbroken and a week away from saying her vows, Bradbury contacted Hurricane Mayor Scott Edwards to see if he could help.\n\nEverywhere was booked for the scheduled weekend except one place.\n\n“It hit us today, wait a second, City Hall,” Edwards said.\n\nEdwards said this is a very rare exception to the rules.\n\nThe city hasn’t allowed people to reserve City Hall for events like this, but, in this case, Edwards said it was the right thing to do.\n\n“She’s already planned on going to the coast and having a wonderful wedding on the coast, but the second best thing, have a wedding here in Hurricane during the hurricane,” Edwards said.\n\nGillenwater and Bradbury won’t be able to use their newly acquired North Carolina marriage license, but they said their West Virginia one will work just fine.\n\n“I finally stopped crying,” Bradbury said.\n\nWhile they are making their vows before God in Hurricane, they also know many will be praying to him for safety from Hurricane Florence.\n\n“We just worry about them,” Bradbury said, “and hopefully everything will work out well.”\n\nBradbury and Gillenwater plan to marry on Sunday."
