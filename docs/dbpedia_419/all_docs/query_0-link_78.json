        "text": "HUNTINGTON, W.Va. ( / ) - Residents of a West Virginia neighborhood are pitching in to help rebuild a after it was blown up over the weekend.\n\nMatt Lockhart had the Little Free Library installed in his backyard two years ago. The idea was to share books, smiles and conversations with neighbors.\n\n\"Somebody put some fireworks in here and just blew it up, as you can tell,\" he said. \"We got char marks all over books and the glass flew everywhere.\"\n\nSurveillance video captured people putting a firework or explosive in the library and driving off as it explodes.\n\n\"(We're) really just a little frustrated, but are trying to pick up the pieces and we want to rebuild this,\" Lockhart said.\n\nNeighbors such as Sandy Gibson say she is sad to see it ruined.\n\n\"I think sometimes when people do destructive things they don't realize how many people they affect and it was sad,\" Gibson said.\n\nInstead of dwelling on the negative, Lockhart is putting his energy into turning this to something positive.\n\n\"I think the goal now is let's raise enough money to build several of these,\" Lockhart said. \"Let's take one bad thing and turn it into 10 good things.\"\n\nEach library will cost $300 to $400.\n\n\"You've knocked us down once, but we're going to get up four more times and that's kind of the goal with this,\" Lockhart said.\n\nIf you are interested in donating to help build more Little Free Libraries in Huntington, or message on Facebook."
