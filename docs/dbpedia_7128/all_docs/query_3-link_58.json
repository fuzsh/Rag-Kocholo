        "text": "Ayamonte Parador\n\nGuadiana river and international bridge\n\nThe Ayamonte parador is a modern hotel situated on the banks of the Guadiana river, which forms the border with Portugal, close to the Huelva coast.\n\nThis location is ideal for trips to the Algarve, just over the Guadiana International Bridge, and to the fabulous Atlantic beaches and islands of the western Costa de la Luz.\n\nWhere is it and what’s it like?\n\nThe outstanding feature of this parador, one of only two in Huelva province (the other is in Mazagon, on the beach), is the views of the wildlife-rich wetlands where the Guadiana meets the Atlantic. The Parador sits on a small hill overlooking the town of Ayamonte to the south, while to the west is the river and, on its far side, you can see the border town of Vila Real de Santo Antonio. As you sit on the terrace, enjoying the sunset, you can also take in the spectacular suspension bridge that spans the river between Spain and Portugal, built as part of the region’s infrastructure upgrades in the 1990s.\n\nThe hotel holds a commanding position next to the river, and was built on the site of a Roman castle. It’s a low-rise, modern structure, built to a simple, functional design, with a garden full of palm trees and a swimming pool. Rooms are decorated in contemporary style, with tiled floors and neutral colours, brightened up with pretty striped bedspreads. Most have balconies, some with views to the river and bridge.\n\nThis parador offers a good base for exploring the villages of the Algarve in Portugal and enjoying the unbeatable beaches of Huelva in Spain, such as Isla Canela, at the mouth of the Guadiana, and Isla Cristina.\n\nWhat is there to do in the area?\n\nThe many nearby beach resorts on the Atlantic coast that form the Huelva province section of the Costa de la Luz have family-friendly facilities such as car parks and restaurants. Many types of sports are available, including watersports obviously - windsurfing, kite-surfing, wing-foil, paddle-boarding – as well as golf and cycling.\n\nLocal cuisine\n\nThe parador ‘s restaurant specialises in regional gastronomy, using local raw ingredients where possible. This area is known across Spain for its fresh seafood, including chocos (cuttlefish), gambas blancas (white prawns) and coquinas (small clams). In addition, Huelva’s jamón iberico de bellota, acorn-fed Iberian ham, is world-renowned; dine on fresh cuts of pork as well as other embutidos (charcuterie). There is a large terrace where you can soak up the views of the river.\n\nHow do I get there?\n\nThe Parador de Ayamonte is just off the A49 motorway, before the Guadiana bridge. Leave the motorway at exit 131 and take the road south towards Ayamonte town centre. Turn right at the second roundabout, and the hotel is at the end of the road.\n\nBook Parador Ayamonte\n\nLocation\n\nAvda. de la Constitución, s/n, Ayamonte, Huelva."
