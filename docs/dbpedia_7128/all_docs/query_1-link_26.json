        "text": "Embark on an exhilarating journey across the Guadiana River, soaring through the air on an awe-inspiring cross-border zip line from Spain to Portugal.\n\nWe had known about this zipline for some time and were curious to explore it. Internet booking is easy and so is access.\n\nThe zip line\n\nThe zip line is located on a hill next to Sanlucar, Spain and descends vertiginously over the Guadiana River to Alcoutim, Portugal. These two villages are crossed by the Guadiana River and with no other way to connect them, they can only be crossed by boat and now by zip line.\n\nThe zip line has a height that varies between 15 and 30 meters, depending on the water level in the river. You will be able to reach a speed of up to 80 km/h, for an experience full of adrenaline.\n\nHow to make the reservation\n\nTo book a zip line trip, just go to the limitzero website, check availability and make the reservation. It happened to us that they contacted us to readjust the schedule since the existence of multiple reservation systems was causing some confusion to the small Spanish company that operates this attraction.\n\nBooking does not include boat crossing from Portugal. This can be done on a small boat connecting the shores every 30 minutes daily. The reservation is made in Spanish hours.\n\nOnce you arrive at the Sanlucar small dock, go to a small shop next to the coffee in front of the dock. There, some of the safety instructions were given, the harness and we waited for the van that took us to the starting point.\n\nThe region\n\nThe Guadiana River\n\nFor those who don’t know, this Algarve region has a lot to explore. Starting with the Guadiana River, which is an international river that runs on the border between Spain and Portugal. It is the fifth largest river in the Iberian Peninsula, with a length of 829 km, which is why crossing it is amazing. Nature also abounds in this less populated area than the region next to the beaches. Here the white storks, otters or eagles still make some appearances.\n\nAlcoutim and Sanlucar\n\nAlcoutim in Portugal is a village located on the left bank of the Guadiana River. The first impression of the village is its tranquillity, due in part to the isolation and the few inhabitants. It is a region rich in\n\nnatural landscapes and culture. In Alcoutim you can visit its small castle, the old and new pier and the chapel. In summer, you can’t miss visiting its river beach and, of course, exploring the village’s gastronomy.\n\nSanlucar is located opposite Alcoutim and also has a castle, gardens, a small river beach and typical Spanish cuisine.\n\nCrossing requirements and safety\n\nLike all extreme entertainment, there is always some risk involved and a great deal of excitement. The security requirements are not many, but in order not to book and then not be able to cross, keep in mind the following:\n\nSchedules\n\nThis is in operation mainly in the summer and with a typical Spanish schedule. It works until around lunchtime and then at the end of the day."
