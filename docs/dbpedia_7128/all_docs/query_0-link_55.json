        "text": "JOHN CARLOS I\n\nKING OF SPAIN\n\nTo all who present it and understand it.\n\nSabed: That the General Courts have approved and I come to sanction the following Law.\n\nEXPLANATORY STATEMENT\n\nArticle 45.2 of the Spanish Constitution states that \" the public authorities shall ensure the rational use of all natural resources, in order to protect and improve the quality of life and to defend and restore the the environment, building on the indispensable collective solidarity \".\n\nConstituting water a natural resource, its availability must be the object of an adequate planning that enables its rational use in harmony with the environment.\n\nAlthough planning is a technique that enjoys great roots in our legal system, it achieves a new meaning with Law 29/1985, of 2 August, of Aguas, which gives it legal status and conceives as an instrument of rationalization and guarantee of the availability of water to meet the different demands, but also as an object to achieve a good ecological state of the waters.\n\nIn a country like Spain where water is a scarce resource, marked by severe water imbalances due to its irregular distribution, the proper planning of water policy is imposed as a necessity, not can remain alien to this reality and as an instrument of overcoming it.\n\nThe resolution of these imbalances corresponds to the National Hydrological Plan, which from a global perspective, has to contemplate for this a harmonious and coordinated use of all its water resources capable of satisfying in form balanced the goals of the schedule.\n\nPrecisely because water is a symbol and expression of life and prosperity, it often gives rise to controversial situations and therefore the decision it proposes to solve existing imbalances, never before. it can be harmless as its first-order social and economic transcendence and in need of environmental assessment.\n\nFor this reason, in the elaboration of the National Hydrological Plan approved by this Law, not only the different public administrations, but also the civil society have participated through a broad process of social participation initiated with the development and approval of the watershed water plans, the elaboration and discussion of the White Paper on Water, and in the deliberations of the National Water Council.\n\nThis planning cannot be understood in our days without the environment being the main reference of its content.\n\nIn this sense, the present National Hydrological Plan cannot remain indifferent to the recent adoption of Directive 2000 /60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October establishing a framework for the Community action in the field of water policy, a pattern by which the Member States ' water policies must be outlined in the 21st century.\n\nThus, the National Hydrological Plan endorses the essential principles of the Directive, following the path already initiated by the reform of Article 38 of the Water Law, pursuant to Law 46/1999, of December 13, to the to consider as one of its objectives \"to achieve the good state of the water masses\". The principle of cost recovery, the participation of society in the process of elaboration of the National Hydrological Plan, the guarantee of access to information in the field of water, are clear examples of this influence and the will of the a legislator to incorporate into our waters the inspiring philosophy of the Directive.\n\nIt also culminates the planner process through the coordination of the basin Hydrological Plans already approved.\n\nThis Law, which approves the National Hydrological Plan, is designed by the legislator of the Water Law, regulating the contents that the legislator had provided for it, as well as those other forecasts. The regulations are necessary to ensure that they are complied with, avoiding unjustified modifications of the general framework in which they are integrated and without extracting them from their tasks, which are the same as the instrumental law. In accordance with this, it regulates the criteria for the coordination of the water catchment areas, the resolution of the various alternatives offered by them, the modifications to be made in the planning of the resource and the forecast of the conditions for transfers of water resources between territorial areas of different catchment areas.\n\nCoherent with a model of planning that has been wanted plural and decentralized in its origin, scope and execution, the coordinating role of the National Hydrological Plan with respect to the Hydrological Plans of the basin is limited consciously to those issues which have not been dealt with by them or which have been insufficiently or with incoherent solutions to each other, and which, as they are of general interest, require homogeneous responses at national level.\n\nTherefore, the Law of the National Hydrological Plan establishes the basic elements of coordination of the Logical Water Plans of the basin and refers to a later normative development the establishment of the technical and methodological criteria to be taken into account in the future review of the same.\n\nWithout a doubt, the central axis of this Law is the regulation of transfers of water resources between territorial areas of different basin plans, as a solution for which the legislator has opted for to ensure a rational satisfaction of the demands throughout the national territory. The solution that is reached is the most efficient after considering the different alternatives and proceeding to a rigorous cost-benefit analysis of the transfers, valuing the environmental, socioeconomic and technical variables of the same, and putting all this into broad social debate.\n\nAspect highlighted in this Law is the relevant role that is attributed to both Autonomous Communities and Local Corporations in the management model designed by the same.\n\nIn order to guarantee the right of the citizen to the environmental information in the terms of the Water Law, the foundations on which the decision adopted in this Law has been settled, collected in the documents The technical background and budgets of the Plan will be the subject of publication so that at any time all interested can know the foundations on which the Law is based.\n\nThe role to play for consumers and users of water must also be decisive, which is why the Law particularly encourages sustainable use and savings practices and awareness campaigns and Citizen awareness.\n\nThe regulation that transfers the National Hydrological Plan has been limited to those supposed to be justified in powerful motives of general interest, which respond to situations of structural deficiencies accredited in the time.\n\nEven in these assumptions and in order to ensure the harmonious and balanced fulfillment of the objectives of the planning, the Law submits the realization of the transfers to important environmental and socioeconomic channels to ensure that in no case the future development of the ceding basin can be compromised by the transfer, and the supply of the use of the present and the reserves for uses must be assured in advance future in the ceding basin, as well as the forced circulation of the environmental water flow below the tap-taking and maintenance of the associated ecosystems.\n\nHowever, given that the transfer of resources between territorial areas of different hydrological plans constitutes the ultimate and most committed solution to solving structural water deficits, the Hydrological Plan National without renouncing them, it includes other measures for the rationalization and optimization of water resources.\n\nIn this sense, the Plan encourages the obtaining of alternative resources such as those from the desalination of sea and brackish waters; the reuse and purification of wastewater; of rainwater; of the artificial replenishment of groundwater. R & D programmes in these and other areas are also part of the content of the Plan.\n\nThe restrictive will of this Law must also be emphasized in the regulation of the destinations of the transferred waters, which in no case can be destined to new irrigation or expansion of the existing ones but exclusively to a series of assessed assumptions intended to cover the urban supply needs of the receiving basin, to consolidate the supply of irrigation envelopes in a precarious situation, provided that a rational and efficient management of water, or to rebalance situations of environmental sustainability of the same.\n\nSpecial entity charges in the framework of this Law the regulation of the economic-financial regime of the transfers. It is governed by the principles of cost recovery in line with the provisions of the Water Framework Directive, as well as the principle of solidarity, promoting a joint development of the donor and recipient basins, through the establishment of an ecological tribute which provides for a quota to compensate the donor basin in an environmentally friendly way.\n\nConsequently, the transfer is configured, within the framework of this Law, as an important instrument for the vertebrate of the territory, preventing areas with structural deficits of water resources from being strangled and threatened. economic and social development by the uncertainty of the water supply, and by ensuring that the ceding basins do not have their own mortgaged as a result of the water supply, in addition to receiving compensation for environmental action linked to water uses.\n\nThe transfers provided for in the National Hydrological Plan cannot be viewed in isolation, but as one of the components of the integrative instrument that is the National Hydrological Plan, in which other transfers are included. actions in which environmental protection is undoubtedly of particular importance.\n\nThe Law, taking into consideration the philosophy of the recently developed Water White Paper, places special emphasis on ensuring the rational and sustainable use of water resources, a concern that is transmitted throughout its articulated. Among these for their uniqueness they deserve special mention the effective management of the waters for supply, the requirement of maximum efficiency in the management of the resource in the receiving basins, the regulation of the hydrological reserves for reasons environmental, drought management and regulation of flood zones, protection of groundwater and conservation of wetlands and actions to raise awareness, training and education in the sustainable use of water.\n\nFor the development of the forecasts established in the Basin Hydrological Plans, the Law sets out in Annex II a set of actions aimed at improving the use and conservation of the resource.\n\nFinally today, after a long process of planning that has lasted for fifteen years, we can close as stated by Royal Decree 1664/1998, of July 24, of approval of the basin Hydrological Plans, the horizon provided for in the Water Law and obtain a definitive picture of the direction of the water policy of the coming years.\n\nPRELIMINARY TITLE\n\nArticle 1. Object of the Law.\n\nThe object of this Law is the regulation of the matters referred to in Article 43 of Law 29/1985 of 2 August of Aguas, as the content of the National Hydrological Plan, as well as the establishment of regulatory forecasts needed to ensure compliance.\n\nArticle 2. Objectives of the Law.\n\n1. These are general objectives of this Law:\n\na) Reach the good state of the hydraulic public domain, and in particular of the water masses.\n\nb) Manage water supply and meet the demands of present and future water through a rational, sustainable, balanced and equitable use of water, which allows at the same time to guarantee sufficiency and quality of the resource for each use and the long-term protection of available water resources.\n\nc) Achieve the balance and harmonization of regional and sectoral development, in order to achieve the backbone of the national territory.\n\nd) Rebalance the availabilities of the resource, protecting its quality and economizing its uses, in harmony with the environment and other natural resources.\n\n2. To achieve these objectives, this Law regulates:\n\n(a) The necessary measures for the coordination of the different Water Basin Plans.\n\nb) The solution for the alternatives proposed in the Basin Hydrological Plans.\n\nc) The forecast and the conditions of transfers of water resources between territorial areas of different basin Hydrological Plans.\n\nd) Changes to be made in the planning of the use of the resource and affecting existing uses for the supply of populations and irrigation.\n\ne) Certain subjects linked to effective resource planning.\n\nArticle 3. Definitions.\n\nFor the purposes of this Law:\n\n(a) Shared aquifers: those hydrogeological units located in the territorial areas of two or more Basin Plans.\n\nb) Transfer: the specific rule authorising the passage of water resources from one territorial area of hydrological planning to another. The connections between different operating systems within the same territorial area of planning shall be in accordance with the provisions of their respective Basin Hydrological Plan.\n\nc) Transfer: the specific authorization of volumes to be agreed to be transferred each year or in each specific situation.\n\nd) Transfer infrastructures: the works and installations that are necessary to execute each authorization.\n\ne) Small transfers: transfers between different territorial areas of the hydrological planning whose annual volume does not exceed 5 hm3.\n\nf) Hydrological reserves for environmental reasons:\n\nrivers, stretches of river, aquifers or water bodies on which, given their special characteristics or their hydrological importance, a reserve has been constituted for their conservation in a natural state.\n\ng) High-supply systems:\n\nwater supply for districts, communities or groups of municipalities under public service.\n\nArticle 4. Scope of application.\n\nThis Law shall apply throughout the national territory, without prejudice to measures which, by their nature, must have an exclusive effect on the territorial areas expressly indicated, and by the of the Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands, in accordance with the provisions of the third provision of Law 29/1985 of 2 August, of Water.\n\nTITLE I\n\nContents provided for in the Water Act\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nCoordination Measures of Basin Hydrological Plans\n\nArticle 5. Of the guiding principles of the coordination measures.\n\nThe coordination measures of the basin Hydrological Plans will be governed by the general principles of precaution, rationality, sustainability, protection of the public hydraulic domain, the good ecological state of the waters and the protection of environmental flows.\n\nArticle 6. Of the criteria for coordination of the Water Basin Plans.\n\nThe Council of Ministers, with the report of the National Water Council and the Autonomous Water Administrations of the Intra-Community basins, will regulate, by means of Royal Decree, within the maximum period of two years from the date of entry In force of this Law the coordination criteria relating to technical and methodological aspects, to be taken into account in the review of the basin Hydrological Plans according to the following determinations:\n\n(a) The identification and definition of a single operating system for each Plan, in which, in a simplified manner, all partial systems are included, and with which the overall analysis of behavior is possible. In no case shall this system entail the elimination of the operating systems provided for in the basin Hydrological Plans, nor the cancellation of the determinations that affect them. Uniform procedures for the establishment of consolidated claims and balance sheets of resources shall also be established.\n\nb) Treatment in an integrated and systematic way, for all basins and with a common methodology, of the various processes that constitute the hydrological cycle, and in particular the interrelations between surface water and underground, and the overall quality and quantity approach.\n\n(c) The delimitation of the protection perimeters of both those in which the exercise of activities that could constitute a danger of contamination and degradation of the public hydraulic domain, such as the the protection of aquifers defined in the Regulation of the Public and Hydraulic Public Domain and others of an optional nature. The ratio of such perimeters to other protection figures shall also be determined.\n\nd) Those related to the following matters, in accordance with the regulations established in other articles of this Law: Environmental Caudals, Drought Management, Protection of the Public Domain Hydraulic, Wetlands, Performances in Flood zones and Hydrological Information.\n\nArticle 7. Shared aquifers.\n\n1. Shared aquifers, for the purposes set out in this Law, are considered to be those located in territorial areas of two or more Basin Hydrological Plans listed in Annex I to this Law.\n\nLaw. The procedure for defining and delimiting the polygonal of the new shared aquifers that will be determined at each moment will be determined. The delimitation of shared aquifers, when it affects intra-Community basins, must be previously reported by the Water Administration of the corresponding Autonomous Community.\n\n2. Annex I to this Law provides for the allocation of water resources for each aquifer shared between the affected basins. Each Hydrological Plan shall collect the allocations made in this Law.\n\nArticle 8. Legal regime for shared aquifers.\n\n1. The administration of the shared aquifers corresponds to each of the basin organizations in their respective territorial scope. Without prejudice to this, each Basin Agency shall notify the other Organisms with which it shares the aquifer, all the resolutions it adopts in relation to the aquifer.\n\n2. The management of the aquifer may be entrusted to one of the bodies concerned by the agreement of the Government Boards concerned. In case of discrepancy, the Ministry of the Environment will be resolved.\n\n3. In the shared aquifers, only the transfer of resources between territorial areas of different basin Hydrological Plans shall be considered when there is transport by means of artificial conduction between them. This consideration will result in the application of the legal system of the transfers of resources provided for in this Law.\n\nArticle 9. Rules on good ecological status of waters.\n\n1. In order to achieve the objective of a good ecological state of the waters and to prevent the further deterioration of the waters, they will apply in general, in all rivers, aquifers or water bodies and sensitive areas the objectives of quality and the limits of emission for specific substances fixed in each case in the rules applicable to them. In accordance with that legislation, derogations from this general principle and more restrictive rules for areas designated as special protection may be laid down in the basin hydrological plans.\n\n2. With regard to the good ecological status, and in accordance with the objectives of the hydrological planning, the Ministry of the Environment and the Water Administrations, within the scope of their respective competences, will develop programmes for the definition, characterization and analysis of the ecological status of the public hydraulic domain.\n\n3. The use of water for consumption or for bathing must be observed in the catchment area or in the bathing area, the health conditions defined by the health authority.\n\nArticle 10. Coordination with other sectoral policies.\n\nWater policy is at the service of sectoral strategies and plans that on the various uses establish public administrations, without prejudice to the rational and sustainable management of the resource to be applied by the Ministry of the Environment, or by the competent water authorities, which shall condition any authorisation, concession or future infrastructure requested.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nSolution to possible alternatives that offer Basin Hydrological Plans\n\nArticle 11. Proposed alternatives and their solution.\n\nFor the purposes of article 43.1.b.\n\nof the Water Law, the only alternatives that have been foreseen by the Basin Hydrological Plans, and whose solution is addressed in this Law, are those regarding the transfers of resources that are regulated in the following articles.\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTransfers Forecast and Conditions\n\nSECTION 1 GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND FORECAST FOR TRANSFERS\n\nArticle 12. General principles.\n\n1. In order to comply with the general objectives set out in Article 38.1 of the Water Law and in Article 2 of this Law, transfers of water resources may be carried out between territorial areas of different Plans. Basin hydrologic.\n\nSuch transfers shall in any event be subject to compliance with the conditions laid down in this Law.\n\n2. Any transfer shall be based on the principles of guarantee of the current and future claims of all uses and uses of the donor basin, including environmental restrictions, without the development of such restrictions being limited. the catchment area in the provision of transfers. The principles of solidarity, sustainability, economic rationality and the vertebrate of the territory will also be addressed.\n\n3. The transfers provided for in this Law must also be subject to the principle of cost recovery, in accordance with the principles of the Water Act and Community legislation.\n\nArticle 13. Forecast for new ordinary transfers.\n\n1. The following transfers are authorised subject to compliance with the conditions set out in this Law:\n\n2. The transfer of an annual volume of up to 190 hm3, with origin in the Lower Ebro area of the Water Plan of the Ebro basin and destination in the territorial scope of the Hydrological Plan of the Internal Watersheds of Catalonia.\n\n3. The transfer of an annual volume of up to 315 hm3, with origin in the Lower Ebro zone of the Water Plan of the Ebro basin and destination in the territorial scope of the Hydrological Plan of the Júcar.\n\n4. The transfer of an annual volume of up to 450 hm3, with origin in the Lower Ebro area of the Water Plan of the Ebro basin and destination in the territorial scope of the Segura Hydrological Plan.\n\n5. The transfer of an annual volume of up to 95 hm3, with origin in the Lower Ebro area of the Water Plan of the Ebro basin and destination in the territorial scope of the Southern Hydrological Plan.\n\nArticle 14. Provision for small-scale transfers.\n\n1. Small transfers may be authorised between different territorial areas of hydrological planning, not specifically provided for in the previous article, in accordance with the following rules:\n\n(a) The Ministry of the Environment may authorise the carrying out of transfers whose annual volume does not exceed the amount of 1 cubic hectolitre.\n\n(b) The Council of Ministers may authorise transfers whose annual volume is between 1 and 5 hectolitres.\n\n2. In any event, the Governing Board of the affected basin bodies shall be heard to be heard.\n\n3. In the small-scale transfer agreements to be adopted, as provided for in this Article, the requirements contained in this Law that apply to them must be specified.\n\nSECTION 2. 3RD CONDITIONS OF TRANSFERS AUTHORIZED IN THIS LAW\n\nArticle 15. Environmental conditions.\n\nIn order to be able to determine the environmental impact of the transfers, all projects relating to the transfers will be subject to environmental impact assessment jointly, in accordance with the procedure legally established, even where this is not mandatory under the environmental impact assessment legislation, the preventive, protective, corrective and compensation measures included in the environmental impact assessment must be complied with. environmental impact statements that are dictated to the effect.\n\nArticle 16. Technical conditions.\n\n1. The transfer volumes authorised in this Law shall be understood as maximum annual measured at the point of taking of the donor basin.\n\n2. The water transfers authorized in Article 13 of this Law with origin in the low Ebro, shall be subject to the following conditions:\n\n(a) No derivation shall be carried out as long as it does not circulate through the river, at the points of taking, a flow exceeding the sum of the environmental minimum fixed in the Hydrological Plan in the Ebro basin, plus the corresponding to the concessions in their existing case downstream of the takes.\n\nb) By the set of transfers of the transfers, only a total flow rate equal to the circulating in the river that exceeds the sum mentioned above may be derived.\n\nc) The reservoirs and hydraulic systems of the Ebro basin will not be forced to perform any unpacking to favor the transfers from the low Ebro. The operation of these systems may be carried out in the manner in which it is decided by its management bodies, without any payment due to the transfer. The only exception to this principle is that of the Mequinenza, Ribarroja and Flix reservoirs, whose regulatory capacity will be partially used to facilitate the operation of the transfers.\n\nd) The regulatory capacity of the Mequinenza, Ribarroja and Flix reservoirs will also be used to meet the environmental requirements of ecological flows, including those required by the Ebro Delta.\n\n3. The Ministry of the Environment will approve, by ministerial order, the technical rules for the exploitation of the transfers, contemplating the guarantees for the ceding basins that are included in the article of the Law. The temporary operating arrangements for the same shall be adapted to the hydrological conditions of each moment, and to the environmental requirements of the donor and the receiving basins, with preferential status for the donor basin, as well as the compliance, in the water bodies concerned, with the hygiene and health requirements laid down in the specific legislation for drinking water and bathing water. This operating rule shall fix the flow of flows in the period from October to May, and shall regulate the unique technical conditions which, after the granting of the concessional and ecological flows, make it possible to the derivation of flow rates for the rest of the year. For the purposes of this paragraph, the donor basin bodies shall issue an annual report on the status of their basins, as well as how many reports are required in extraordinary situations.\n\n4. The competent public administrations of all basins, including the recipients and the transfer funds, in accordance with their respective Hydrological Plans, will give priority to increasing the availability of own water resources, including the use of non-conventional resources where relevant, rationalisation and water saving, as well as measures aimed at improving the sustainability of the natural water environment.\n\nArticle 17. Destinations of the transferred waters.\n\n1. Waters transferred pursuant to transfers authorised under Article 13 of this Law may be used only for:\n\na) Feeding or supplementing existing high supply systems, as well as ensuring the current and future uses of urban supply in the receiving basins, as long as there is a management rational and efficient water.\n\nb) Improving the environmental conditions of those ecosystems, river sections, aquifer sectors, or elements of the natural water environment, which are currently subjected to intense degradation.\n\nc) Consolidate the supply of the existing irrigation envelopes in accordance with the corresponding water basin management plan, which are in a precarious situation, both for situations of infradation, For lack of sufficient guarantee and as long as rational and efficient water management is being carried out.\n\nd) Eliminate situations of current unsustainability due to the overexploitation in the aquifers of the receiving basin, and restore the balance of the environment by ensuring the subsistence of the exploitations linked to these aquifers.\n\n2. In no case shall the waters transferred to the creation of new irrigation be allocated, nor to the extension of the existing ones in the areas benefiting from the transfers.\n\n3. In order to access the use of the transferred waters, the users must have the concessions or any other sufficient title to prove the right to the private use of the waters, duly registered in the Register of Water of the receiving basin. In any case, it shall be ensured that the transferred waters do not produce negative environmental changes, which may be considered significant, in natural areas of the receiving basins.\n\n4. The title for the use of water for the supply of water may correspond both to the affected core itself and to the supply system or entity in which this core is included and will be granted by the Hydraulic Administration. competent of the receiving basin.\n\n5. Prior to the use of the transferred waters, the Governing Board of the recipient basin body or the governing body of the hydraulic administration in the intra-Community basins shall adopt the following agreements in accordance with Article 1 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 628/92. the use to which the waters are intended: in the case of irrigation, it shall define the perimeter of each area of application thereof, study its water balance and, as a result, propose the necessary volumes of water. In the case of supplies, it shall determine the territorial area concerned, study its water balance and propose the necessary volumes of water.\n\n6. In the case of paragraph 1 (d), it is necessary for the Basin Agency, prior to the use of the transferred water, to have declared that the underground water resources are overexploited or at risk of being exploited. In this case, the Governing Board of the Agency shall carry out the delimitation of the area of application of the transferred waters and carry out the evaluation of its resources, determining the necessary water contributions to restore the balance. The Communities or groups of users referred to in the following Article shall deal with the reduction or the expiry of the concessions granted in amounts equivalent to the volumes transferred, up to the condition of sustainable natural balance of these aquifers.\n\n7. In accordance with the criteria set out in the previous paragraphs, and having regard to the forecasts of the corresponding basin Hydrological Plan, the Council of Ministers, by means of Royal Decree, after the report of the basin bodies, will establish the different uses, zones and areas of application of the transferred resources, as well as their precise quantification. On the basis of the provisions of this rule, the granting of the corresponding concessions or, where appropriate, the modification of the existing ones, adapting them to the new circumstances.\n\n8. The granting or modification of concessions referred to in the preceding paragraph shall take into account the preference for the use of the donor basins.\n\nArticle 18. User organization conditions.\n\n1. In the receiving basins, it will be necessary to establish a Central Board of Users or equivalent representative entity for each of the authorized transfers, which will show the representation of the users of the water transferred to the Hydraulic administrations, in relation to transfers.\n\n2. These may be exempted from the scheme provided for in the preceding number, where, in the light of their specific circumstances, it is established by the Ministry of the Environment, the catchment bodies concerned.\n\n3. For each area of application of the waters transferred, in the cases referred to in paragraphs (c) and (d) of Article 17.1, a Community or a grouping of users, which shall be the holder of the concessions, shall be constituted, if not previously of the waters transferred and which, in turn, shall be integrated into the Central Board of Users or entity referred to in paragraph 1.\n\nArticle 19. Management conditions.\n\n1. For the set of transfers authorized in Article 13 of this Law, a Commission of Trasvases will be created in which they will be represented, in the form that is regulated, the Ministry of the Environment, the Administrations Water and water supply, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water The Committee of the European Parliament, the Committee of the European Parliament and the Committee of the European Government of the agency of the donor basin, representing the users.\n\n2. It will be up to the Trasvases Commission to exercise, in respect of each transfer, the powers that the Law of Water reserves to the Boards of Exploitation in its Article 30 and, in particular, the request for specific volumes to be transferred in each period. The Director-General of Water and Water Quality, on a proposal from the Commission of the Transports concerned, shall authorize the conditions under which the transfers and the volume of the transfers shall be carried out. The Commission's proposal will be binding if it has been carried out unanimously. In another case, the resolution shall be adopted by the Director-General on the basis of the concurrent hydrological and environmental conditions and in accordance with the operating rules laid down for each transfer.\n\n3. In the event that a transfer requires the use of storage or regulatory infrastructure, they shall preferably be provided in the receiving basin.\n\n4. The programming of the transfers will be carried out according to the largest economy and rationality in the use of the resource, with the possibility to use to this effect both the new and existing infrastructures in the affected basins, including the of transit, unless otherwise provided for in Article 16.2.c), and in any event the uses previously established in each basin shall be preferential. The use of the existing infrastructure shall be subject, if applicable, to the payment of the regulatory fee or use rate provided for in the Water Act.\n\nArticle 20. Conditions of execution and exploitation.\n\nThe construction and operation of the infrastructures of each transfer will be made by the budgetary, administrative or social mechanism that is more appropriate in each case, within those that provide for the legal order in force for the promotion of hydraulic works.\n\nArticle 21. Effects of the transfer authorizations.\n\n1. The necessary infrastructure works for the realization of the transfers authorized in this Law are declared in the general interest.\n\n2. The approval of the projects of works that are necessary for the execution of these transfers, it will take implicit the declaration of public utility and the necessity of occupation of the goods and acquisition of rights, to the purposes of expropriation temporary occupation, in accordance with the provisions of the relevant legislation. The declaration of public utility and the need for occupation shall also cover the goods and rights included in the project's review and in the modifications of the works which may subsequently be approved.\n\nSECTION 3 ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR TRANSFERS AUTHORIZED IN THIS LAW\n\nArticle 22. Financial economic regime of the transfer.\n\n1. An ecological tribute called \"transfer fee\" is established which, by its nature of charge, will cover both the costs of the transfers authorized by this Law, and the derivatives of the environmental compensation to the watersheds by the transfer of water.\n\n2. The charge regulated in this article shall be governed by this Law and by the other normative sources which are established for the fees in accordance with Article 9 of Law 8/1989 of 13 April of Fees and Public Prices.\n\n3. It constitutes the taxable fact of the charge, the provision by the hydraulic administration of the water transferred to the users of the transfer, in origin of the taking, according to the provisions of this Law.\n\n4. The users of the transferred waters shall be liable for the transfer fee. Where the implementation and management of the transfer infrastructure is entrusted to a different entity of the General Administration of the State, it shall be considered as a liability of the fee, as a substitute for the taxpayer, forcing them to pass on the same on the fees that they must receive from the users.\n\n5. The amount of the transfer fee to be met by the taxable persons for the provision of the transfer of water to the transfer shall be the result of adding the \"utilization fee\" of the transfer and the \"environmental quota\", respectively, the amounts fixed for the compensation of the costs of the investment which can be passed on and the management of the infrastructure of the transfer and of the environmental nature that are generated to the ceding basins, as provided for in Article 23 of this Law.\n\n6. For the purposes set out in the preceding paragraph:\n\n(a) The \"utilization fee\" of the transfer fee shall be calculated on the basis of the corresponding economic and financial memory, depending on the amount of the following items:\n\nInfrastructure operating and conservation expenses.\n\nThe administrative costs of the managing bodies, attributable to these works.\n\nThe annual cost of compensation to non-consenting users in the donor or transit basin for the conditions that occur to them.\n\nAn annuity of amortization, including a refund and discount fee, applied to the cost of the investments, both of first establishment and replacement, required for the execution of the works.\n\nThe annual amount of the \"utilization fee\" of the transfer fee for each taxable person shall be determined in accordance with criteria for rationalisation of water use, equity in the allocation of obligations and self-financing of the service, taking into account in particular the actual consumption of the water transferred and the use to which it is intended, and (b) the \"environmental quota\" is a fixed quota per cubic metre of water transferred, the amount of which shall be updated annually in the General Budget Law of the State.

Such bodies may enter into an agreement with the State Tax Administration Agency or other tax administrations, in order to ensure that they are collected and managed by them.\n\n9. The fee shall be independent of the fee to be met for the use of the infrastructure referred to in Article 19 (4) of this Act.\n\n10. Where the implementation and management of the transfer infrastructure is entrusted to a different entity of the General Administration of the State, that entity shall be compensated by the part of the 'use fee' of the transfer fee which corresponds to the coverage of the investment and management costs incurred by the investment and management costs.\n\nArticle 23. Environmental compensation to the ceding basins.\n\nThe environmental fee for the transfer fee shall be allocated in full to the environmentally-friendly compensation of the water catchment areas in accordance with the following principles:\n\n1. The amount raised by the environmental quota shall be entered into a special account of the basin body or, where appropriate, the water administration, of the donor basins in proportion to the volume transferred from each of them, and may be allocated only to the actions provided for in this Article.\n\n2. The environmental compensation will be managed by the Basin Agency and will be used exclusively for environmental actions related to water uses, in particular the environmental recovery of the resource and its environment, the protection of the public hydraulic domain, improvement of water quality and hydrological restoration and environmental management in the ceding basin. The establishment of such actions shall be carried out in a coordinated manner with the Autonomous Communities and the representative organisations of the Local Corporations of the cedant basins in the form that is regulated.\n\n3. The allocation of the environmental compensation between the territories of the different Autonomous Communities of the donor basin shall be made on the basis of proportionality criteria in relation to its area. Account shall also be taken of the territorial area in which the transfer of the transferred water takes place.\n\n4. The actions carried out under the environmental compensation shall be additional to those which, as a general rule, are carried out in the catchment areas of the State's General Budget.\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nChanges to the use of the resource\n\nArticle 24. General rules on uses.\n\n1.
