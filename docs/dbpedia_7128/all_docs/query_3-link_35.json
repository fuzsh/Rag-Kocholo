        "text": "ABSTRACT. This paper preser~ ts a description of an experimental irrvestigatiotr concertring the dynamic interaction between cables arzd the deck/towers system on the physical model of a cable-stayed bridge. The study eviderlces a clear coupling between cable and deckkwer motiotw and includes an experimental arid turmerical evaluation of the importatzce of this aspect in terms of the response to seismic ercitatioils.\n\nShortly after the opening of Dubrovnik (Croatia) cable-stayed bridge in 2002 the violent vibrations of the bridge deck, pylon and cables in a strong wind &quot;Bora&quot; combined with light rain were observed about twelve times a year. This paper analyses effect of violent vibrations of cables and their influence on the overall dynamic behaviour of cable-stayed bridge. Firstly, the vibration of a massive cable which is connected to a vibrating cable-stayed bridge deck and pylon is presented analytically. Equations describing a change of the cable&#39;s force and its eigenvalues due to the cable’s undamped and damped vibrations are also derived. Mathematical lamped models substituting the behaviour of a massive bridge cable and its effect on the dynamic properties of the overall cable-stayed bridge is presented. Finally, the measures for Dubrovnik bridge rehabilitation are presented in a way of suppressing cables vibrations by devices. After installing the Maurer Adaptive Cable Damp...\n\nThis paper presents results of observed and analytical analyses of the dynamic response of the Indiano Cable-Stayed Bridge in Florence, Italy. The observed part is based on ambient and traffic-induced vibration tests, which allowed extracting the dynamic characteristics of the structure in terms of resonance frequencies, modal shapes and damping. These are compared with those obtained from a finite element model for which the geometrical characteristics and the mechanical properties of the materials used in the structural design of the bridge have been adopted. To supplement these analyses, equivalent static analyses were performed to yield amplitudes of response and stresses in structural elements. This version of analysis was performed by response spectrum technique using uniform response spectra expressed in terms of pseudo-velocities as input. The response spectra were obtained from contemporary, seismic hazard studies performed in Florence site.\n\nABSTRACT Ambient vibration measurements of the International Guadiana Bridge are used to validate different methods for so-called multi-run Operational Modal Analysis. The bridge was measured in 28 runs, keeping some reference sensors at fixed locations while others were positioned at a different location in each run. Measuring all runs took more than 2 days and it was observed that in this period, the wind and traffic excitation was changing very significantly.\n\nRain vibration of cables is becoming a matter of great concern recently in Japan and other country for design and construction of cables-stayedbridges. The features of rain vibration are the strong influence of rain on wind-induced oscillation of cable. The cables in cable-stayed bridges, which are stable with respect to wind acting in dry condition, became very unstable with rain, and large amplitude oscillation of cable could be developed under low speed wind. The principal parameters that give a great influence in this phenomenon can be classified in two groups. First the group of the situation of cable were included: the orientation of cable, wind speed, reins intensity. In second group named cables properties were are included natural periods, damping ratio and property of the surface of cables. In this article is presented only a part of the bibliographic study performed at the Laboratoire Central des Ponts at Chausse, Paris. This part is focused on two aspects, the mechanism ...\n\nThe requirement for the seismic analysis of cable-stayed bridges under spatially varying loads is not well defined in the bridge design codes around the world. The Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code briefly stipulates that it is the responsibility of the designer to check the effect of the spatially varying loads while no details are provided. Given this, the objective of this study is to evaluate the seismic performance of cable-stayed bridges using multi-support excitation. For the purpose of the study, Quincy Bayview Bridge located in Illinois, USA is selected for the analysis. Ten ground motion acceleration time-histories obtained from earthquakes in the US, Japan, and Taiwan are used as initial seismic excitation to be applied on the bridge. They are then converted to displacement time-histories and applied at each support by considering the phase delay of the wave traveling from one support to another. The seismic analysis using multi-support excitation shows that significant..."
