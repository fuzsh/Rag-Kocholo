        "text": "#1. Visit the Castle of San Marcos from the 17th century\n\nYou can reach it by car, bike, or even on foot (not recommended during the summer months due to the heat).\n\nThe castle of San Marcos stands on a hill next to the Guadiana River, just opposite its counterpart, the fortress of Alcoutim. This fortification dates back to the 14th century.\n\nIn 2014, a total restoration of the castle was carried out by the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andaluc√≠a.\n\nWhen we went, it was closed (the interior), and according to some neighbors of Sanl√∫car de Guadiana, it has been in this situation for several years due to a breakdown, which they say they are solving.\n\nNevertheless, it is a must-visit to see it up close and especially the views it offers.\n\n#2. Visit the Port of Sanl√∫car de Guadiana\n\nAn essential visit to contemplate the views of the Guadiana River with the Portuguese village of Alcoutim in the background on the other bank.\n\nDuring the last week of March, a pedestrian floating walkway or bridge is installed that connects to the other bank (Alcoutim in Portugal), where the smuggling fair is held, which formerly existed throughout this area, mainly for coffee, tobacco, and food that were scarce in this area after the civil war.\n\nThere is a bar right next to it, and it‚Äôs a good plan to have a drink on the terrace with such views.\n\n#4. Try the transborder zipline\n\nOne of the best experiences we had in Sanl√∫car was trying the world‚Äôs first transborder zipline, which crosses the Guadiana River to Portugal.\n\nThe zipline is 720 meters long, connecting Spain with Portugal, and travels at a speed of between 70 and 80 kilometers per hour. The curious thing is that you start the jump in Spain and in a few minutes, you arrive in Portugal with an hour less, due to the time difference between the two countries üòÖ.\n\n‚Ñπ Note: When you arrive at the Zipline in Portugal, you have to walk about 5 minutes to reach the Alcoutim pier, where you can take a ferry to cross the river and return to Sanl√∫car de Guadiana.\n\nThe ferry cost is not included in the price of the jump. The cost of the jump is 25‚Ç¨.\n\nOther things to consider, the minimum age is 14 years and the maximum weight for a person to be able to jump is 110kg.\n\n#5. Cross the river to visit Alcoutim\n\nThere is a small ferry-taxi that crosses the river approximately every hour, depending on the season, to connect Sanl√∫car de Guadiana with Alcoutim.\n\nAlcoutim is on the other side of the river and belongs to Portugal. It‚Äôs a great opportunity to visit this beautiful Portuguese village.\n\nüü© If you like the idea of the zipline mentioned above, the perfect plan is to do the zipline jump, as the end of the zipline is in Alcoutim, visit the village, and finally go to the pier to take the ferry and cross the river back to Sanl√∫car de Guadiana.\n\n#6. Hiking routes in Sanl√∫car de Guadiana\n\nüìçSanl√∫car de guadiana (huelva) Difficulty: üü¢easy\n\nRoute distance: 7,20 km\n\nPositive slope: 90 m\n\nNegative slope: 90 m\n\nMaximum altitude: 65 m\n\nMinimum altitude: 10 m\n\nRoute type: Circular\n\nWe did the ‚ÄúRibera Grande‚Äù route, which runs alongside the Guadiana River and is not difficult, so almost anyone can do it.\n\nThe path is very well signposted, there is plenty of vegetation and shade along the way, and the path runs parallel to the Guadiana River, except for the sections of ravines.\n\nYou have to go up and down some slopes carefully. We also found wooden bridges and protection railings made of logs."
