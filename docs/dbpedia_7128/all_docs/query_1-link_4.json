        "text": "The Guadiana River rises in Ruidera, between Albacete and Ciudad Real, in Spain, and gently descends through the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula. This river flows into Portugal, forming a natural border between the two countries, before emptying into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nIt is thanks to this river that this zip line between Spain and Portugal has been possible. Besides, you can observe beautiful landscapes and enjoy the view during your trip.\n\nThere is no need to be trained to complete the journey as all instructions are provided on site. There will be people to help you at both the departure and arrival platform, so all you have to do is listen to the instructions and enjoy your adventure.\n\nOne of the several cool things about this activity is that when you finish the zipline, you are one hour behind and that gives you some extra time to visit the beautiful Portuguese town of Alcoutim.\n\nIf you are not scared of heights and the river rushing below, this one clearly deserves a place in your bucket list. Be aware that you need to be at least 14 years of age, or you will be barred from this adventure. Another factor that might stop you from this adventure of a lifetime is the weight limit, as anyone over 140 kg is not allowed to get on the zip line due to safety measures."
