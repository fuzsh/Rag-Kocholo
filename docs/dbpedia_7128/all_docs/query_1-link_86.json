        "text": "1. What is a Cable-Stayed Bridge?\n\nA cable-stayed bridge is a cable supported bridge in which one or multiple pylons are installed in the middle of the bridge and girder segments are connected to the pylons by a cable. In cable-stayed bridges, the shape of pylons, the shape of girders, and the cable arrangement can be freely designed; therefore, various structural systems can be applied. For example, adjusting the tension of the cable forces can reduce the size of the bending moment of the girder. This allows for a more economical design. Furthermore, different cable arrangements and shapes for pylons can be planned for a more aesthetic bridge design suitable for the surrounding environment. However, even with various structural advantages, only a small number of cable-stayed bridges were designed and built in the past due to limitations in materials and construction methods. Today, the emergence of high-strength cables, the advancement of structural analysis software, the establishment of wind-resistant design methods through wind tunnel tests, and the development of construction technology have placed cable-stayed bridges, along side with suspension bridges, responsible for the future of long-span bridges.\n\nA. Pylon/Tower\n\nPylons, or towers, play the role of supporting the cables and transferring the loads transmitted through the cables all the way to the ground. The shape of the pylons/towers can be freely planned according to the shape of the cable stays. If cable stays are arranged on a single plane, different shapes of pylons/towers such as single column types, A-types, reverse Y-types, and diamond types can be used. If cable stays are arranged on a double plane, a variety of pylon/tower shapes can be used except for the single column type. The most representative shapes of pylons/towers can be found in the figures below. Additionally, pylons are designed in various shapes to emphasize aesthetics while providing structural integrity.\n\nB. Girder/Deck\n\nGirders or decks of cable-stayed bridges can be designed using various shapes and materials. Typical examples are steel girders, steel composite girders, and concrete girders. Alternatively, there can be different types of girders for the main span and the approach span. This is often used to increase the length of the main span by taking advantage of concrete being heavier than steel. The shape of the girder should be carefully planned because the cable arrangement method, spacing, anchorage design, analysis technique, and construction method are determined by what kind of girder is planned.\n\nBox Girder\n\nBox girders have the advantages of concrete materials. Furthermore, since the box shape has high torsional stiffness, it has excellent aerodynamic stability, and cables can be arranged in single or double-planes. However, the weight of the girder itself can increase the size of the substructure. To enhance economic feasibility while taking advantage of the box girders, part of the girder sections can be replaced with steel struts or diaphragms. By installing struts on the inside and outside of the girders, the weight of the girders can be reduced, enabling efficient cross-sectional planning. If struts are installed, detailed review of the anchorages and landscapes is additionally required.\n\nD-1. Cable Anchorages at Girders\n\nCable anchorages located on the girders anchors the cables. At the anchorages, the tensile forces on the cables are divided into horizontal and vertical components, which are then transmitted to the girders. The horizontal components of the tensile forces generate axial forces in the girder, and the vertical components of the tensile forces create shear forces in the girder. The structure of the anchorage is determined by various ways such as the cable arrangement (positional relationship between the transverse arrangement and the main girder), the number of strands, the shape of the main girder and the slab system, the structure of the cable cross-section, the magnitude of the tensile forces and the implementation method, and etc.\n\nE-1. Floating System\n\nThe floating system is a structure that supports the load of the superstructure by additionally installing stay cables instead of omitting the vertical supports. Since the torsional load acting on the main girder can be solved by the axial force on the cable, the main girder structure without torsional stiffness is established, and it is a boundary condition for flexible vertical behavior because there is no support for the pylon.\n\nFurthermore, the negative moment of the stiffening girder near the pylon is reduced, and the crossbeam of the pylon can be excluded by not installing the vertical supports on the pylon; thus, improving maintenance. On the other hand, separate countermeasures and large-scale expansion joints are required for displacements caused by horizontal loads such as earthquakes. Additionally, since there are no supports on the pylons, the vertical loads acting on the cables create much larger fatigue loads.\n\nE-2. Shoe System\n\nThe Shoe Support (bearing) System is a structural system in which stiffening girders and pylons are separated and vertical supports and wind shoes are installed. This system supports the vertical and horizontal reaction forces caused by the vertical supports installed on the top of the pylon crossbeams and the horizontal supports installed on the side of the pylons. Supports are placed on pylons, the vertical loads borned by the cables are relatively reduced. Furthermore, permanent bearings can be installed during the construction stage, but additional restraining devices must be installed for deflection. If the span length is long or the self-weight of superstructure increases, the negative moment tends to be excessive because the deck acts as a continuous beam. Since vertical and horizontal supports are installed on the pylons, it is disadvantageous in terms of maintenance, and it can reduce drivability near the pylons.\n\nE-3. Frame System\n\nThe frame system is a structural system in which pylon crossbeams, stiffening girders, and piers are integrated and converged together so that they can behave as one. This structural system is easy to maintain because there is no need for bridge supports, and it has excellent wind stability as it does not need to control the displacement in the bridge longitudinal direction during construction. And this system is stable under the construction and service. However, the effect of creep, shrinkage and thermal load should be examined.\n\nA. Structural Analysis for the Initial Shape\n\nThe structural analysis for the initial shape is performed to optimizing member forces of girders, and pylons, tensile forces of cables, and reaction forces. The analysis is referred to as the introduction of tensile forces to each cable so that the dead loads are balanced with the initial cable tensile forces. The entire model of cable-stayed bridges is a high-order, statically indeterminate structure, so obtaining the initial values required repetitive calculations. Furthermore, since the tension of each cable does not exist as the only solution, different cable tensioning plans can be made for each designer for the same cable-stayed bridge. In particular, in the case of concrete structures, stress is redistributed over time in the final stage due to the effects of creep and shrinkage, leading to deformation of the structure. Therefore, it is also important to determine when the design longitudinal curve is satisfied. These are the three initial value analysis methods:\n\n- Zero Displacement Method\n\n- Force Equilibrium Method\n\n- Force Method\n\nB. Construction Stage Analysis\n\nIn order to determine the cable tension introduced during the cable installation in cable-stayed bridges, it is necessary to first determine the initial equilibrium state for the dead loads in the service stage (completed state). Thereafter, the construction stage analysis according to the construction process must be performed.\n\nIn general, when designing cable-stayed bridges, in the structural analysis of the final stage, the specifications of the structure as well as the cross-section and tension of the cables are calculated. Furthermore, in the construction stage analysis, the installed tension of the cable at each stage as well as the pre-camber of the girder and the construction camber are determined. Through the construction stage analysis, the stress generated in each member is also examined. Moreover, using the review results, the assumed construction sequence and the constructability for the work load are identified in advance, and the optimal construction method is then selected.\n\nThe construction stage analysis can be classified into backward analysis and forward analysis according to the order of the analysis. In contrast to the construction analysis, backward analysis is a method of performing analysis by removing construction members and loads in the backward direction of construction from structures in which the final stage of the initial equilibrium state is determined. Forward analysis in the other hand is a method of performing analysis in the order in which construction proceeds."
