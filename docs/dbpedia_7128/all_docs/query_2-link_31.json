        "text": "I think that I've posted this before. I've been through with my boat and measured air draft as 19.8m. The height of the zip wire is much higher on the Spanish side and did once go under it closer to the Portuguese side. Clearance will certainly not be an issue mid-river, might be dodgy if you really hug the bank on the Portuguese side but can't remember the clearance. I forgot once and did a sharp right turn on hearing shrieks above my head. Plenty of space, just instinctive response on my part.\n\nMy notes say that forecast tide height was 1m on on trip and 0.5m on the other.\n\nI think the height is shown 18m on some charts and I was told 23m by someone. I seem to remember that the clearance there is quoted at mean sea-level and therefore passage at LW gives greater clearance (plus suspicion that it isn't correct in the first place ).\n\nA friend went through in 2013 with older model of my boat and said I'd be OK.\n\nI measured our air draft very carefully before going under the bridge:\n\nAntenna 0.9m​\n\nMast 17m​\n\nMast base-Water 1.9m​\n\nTotal height 19.8m Manufacturer quotes 19.25m (this may be without a VHF antenna).\n\nI didn't know the tide height when he went through but decided it should be OK as it was a pretty low tide when I was going up river. However, I also put about 60- 80kg water on end of the boom and swung it out as we arrived at the bridge. We got through easily and I so just sailed through upright on the return trip (it did look very close that time even though the tide height was less).\n\nSo it must be over 20m, not certain it would be as much as 22-23m but can guarantee 19.8m at low water on dates I made the trip. I think that the tide height was forecast to be 1m for the trip up river and 0.5 m on the return leg (based on Ayamonte). However, I'll need to check the dates to make certain.\n\nIt looked as if there were a couple of huge nuts sticking down under the bridge, so I kept clear of these. I hope this helps.\n\nJust spotted GHA's link and realised that was where I posted the above. I obviously posted it from my own notes."
