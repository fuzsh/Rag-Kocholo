        "text": "Caia (river) River in Portugal and Spain\n\n0 0\n\nrank #1 ·\n\nThe Caia is a river in the Iberian Peninsula, a tributary to the Guadiana. It is one of the main water courses in the Portalegre District, Portugal. Portugal does not recognise the border between the Caia and Ribeira de Cuncos River deltas, since the beginning of the 1801 occupation of Olivenza by Spain. This territory, though under de facto Spanish occupation, remains a de jure part of Portugal, consequently no border is henceforth recognised in this area.\n\nPortugal–Spain border International border\n\n0 0\n\nrank #3 ·\n\nThe Portugal–Spain border is referred to as \"la Raya\" in the Spanish language and \"A Raia\" in the Portuguese language (the stripe). The current demarcation is almost identical to that defined in 1297 by the Treaty of Alcañices. It is one of the oldest borders in the world. The Portugal–Spain border is 1,214 km (754 mi) long, and considered the longest uninterrupted border within the European Union. The border is not defined for 18 km (11 mi) between the Caia river and Ribeira de Cuncos, because of the disputed status of Olivenza, which has been disputed between the two countries for two hundred years.\n\nRibeira de Cuncos Ravine in Portugal\n\n0 0\n\nrank #4 ·\n\nPortugal does not recognise the border between Caia and Ribeira de Cuncos River deltas, since the beginning of the 1801 occupation of Olivenza by Spain. This territory, though under de facto Spanish occupation, remains a de jure part of Portugal, consequently no border is henceforth recognised in this area.\n\nÁgueda (river) River in Portugal and Spain\n\n0 0\n\nrank #6 ·\n\nThe Águeda is a river tributary of the Douro River, that springs from the Serra das Mesas in Spain, in the autonomous community of Castile and León. It flows 130 kilometres (81 mi) until it reaches the Douro River near Barca de Alva, Portugal. The Portugal–Spain border follows the Águeda for much of its course.\n\nTagus Longest river in the Iberian Peninsula\n\n0 0\n\nrank #7 ·\n\nThe Tagus ( TAY-gəs; Spanish: Tajo Portuguese: Tejo ) is the longest river in the Iberian Peninsula. It is 1,007 km (626 mi) long, 716 km (445 mi) in Spain, 47 km (29 mi) along the border between Portugal and Spain and 275 km (171 mi) in Portugal, where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean near Lisbon. It drains an area of 80,100 square kilometers (30,927 sq mi) (the second largest in the Iberian peninsula after the Douro). The Tagus is highly utilized for most of its course. Several dams and diversions supply drinking water to places of central Spain and Portugal, while dozens of hydroelectric stations create power. Between dams it follows a very constricted course, but after Almourol it enters a wide alluvial valley, prone to flooding. Its mouth is a large estuary near the port city of Lisbon.\n\nTagus · 4T\n\nRivers of the Community of Madrid · 11T\n\nRivers of Extremadura · 9T\n\nOlivenza Place in Extremadura, Spain\n\n0 0\n\nrank #8 ·\n\nOlivenza or Olivença is a town situated on a disputed section of the Portugal–Spain border. Its territory is administered by Spain as a municipality belonging to the province of Badajoz, and to the wider autonomous community of Extremadura. Portugal does not recognise the Spanish sovereignty over the territory, based on its interpretation of the rulings of the 1815 Congress of Vienna. Spain finally accepted the Treaty on 7 May 1817; however, Olivença and its surroundings were never returned to Portuguese control and this question remains unresolved and Portugal holds a claim over it.\n\nMunicipalities of Évora District · 14T\n\nPopulated places in the Province of Badajoz · 167T\n\nMunicipalities in the Province of Badajoz · 165T\n\n0 0\n\nrank #9 ·\n\nThe Tagus International Natural Park (Portuguese: Parque Natural do Tejo Internacional, Spanish: Parque natural del Tajo Internacional) is a protected area in Portugal and Spain. It is an important area for the conservation of several species of birds that nest on the rugged banks of rivers and surrounding areas. It is also one of the lowest human density areas in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nTagus basin · 7T\n\nBiosphere reserves of Spain · 40T\n\nNatural parks of Spain · 56T"
