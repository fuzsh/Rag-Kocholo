        "text": "Andalucía is a region of contrast. There are wild mountains and extensive marshes, dry semi-desert and barren karst, but also leafy woodlands laced with murmuring streams. The biodiversity is the highest of any of the Spanish regions. Andalucía is the stronghold of the endangered Iberian Lynx. Herds of wild Ibex roam the mountains and large numbers of vultures and eagles nest on remote, precipitous cliffs. In the wind- beaten dune scrub, the Chameleon shelters, while huge numbers of waterfowl feed in the marshes. Each corner of this, the largest of Spain’s autonomous regions, is different, but all share one characteristic – they all have jewels of natural areas that stand out for one reason or another. Andalucía is too large and diverse to do it justice in a single guidebook. This book covers western Andalucía – Huelva, Seville, Cádiz and Málaga. It describes routes and sites in, amongst others, Coto Doñana, Cádiz and the strait of Gibraltar, Alcornocales, Sierra de Grazalema,"
