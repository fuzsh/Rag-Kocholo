        "text": "Mata Nacional das Terras da Ordem - Odeleite, Castro Marim\n\nIt´s located in the northeast of the municipality ofCastro Marim, in Odeleite. The name of this forest area of ​​about 1,366 ha, suggests a religious past associated with the Order of Christ, when it belonged to the Commandery of Alcaidaria Mór de Castro Marim. Eventually the land acquired by the state in the 60s and suffer the first project of afforestation, to recover the fertility of their soil and their water reserves. With the revolution of April 1974 to interrupt the space of this management work, watching to a new intervention from 1982, aimed at not only the hunting land as tree crown cover. Currently, the stone pine is the predominant species in this forest, being however possible to find new plantations with cork oak, pine-Aleppo, cypress, oak and other hardwoods, especially along the water lines, which contribute to the diversification and development of the total forest area. With regard to shrubby, it is typically Mediterranean, characterized by the existence of lavender (Lavandula viridis), gorse (Genista hirsuta), strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), rockrose (Cistus ladanifer L.).), Seaweed (Cistus monspeliensis) and rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis). The wildlife is characterized by a huge variety of birds, some mammals and reptiles well known. From the point of view of the birds, dominated the warbler of the woods (Sylvia undata), the chickadee-crested (Parus cristatus), the woodpecker-great-spotted (Dendrocops major), the azure-winged magpie (Cyanopica cyana ), the blackbird-black (Monticola solitarius), the bee-eater (Merops apiaster), to -do-lot Lark (Galerida theklae) and the common partridge (Alectoris rufa). In this biotope live mammals such as the wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), hare (Lepus capensis), the fox ((Vulpes vulpes) and wild boar (Sus scrofa). The latter is well noted by the many traces it leaves the mowing trees mud and stoked soils. On the other hand, there is a herpetofauna which make the ladder snake (Elaphe scalaris), the malpolon monspessulanus (Malpolon monspessulanus), the lizard-ocellated (Lacerta lepida), the large psammodromus Iberian (Psammodromus hispanicus ), the sapo-midwife Iberian (Alytes cisternasii), the sapo-runner (Bufo calamita), the salamander-of-protruding ribs (Iberian ribbed newt) and the salamander-of-pints-yellow (Salamandra salamander). Many of these amphibians take advantage of the temporary ponds that form within this ecosystem after heavy rainfall, to mate. Along water bodies we found particular flora and fauna of these wetlands. In terms of fauna have the otter (Lutra Lutra) and a varied water birds such as the gray heron (Ardea cinerea), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), chicken-in-water (Gallinula chloropus), the umbrella rivers (Alcedoatthis), among many others. The flora level there is the common-reed (Arundo dunax), responsible for the presence of dense reeds, willow (Salix sp), the poplar (Populus sp.) And continuous patches of oleander (Nerium oleander) that, unlike other plants, only blooms in late spring, early summer.\n\nMata Nacional das Dunas Litorais de Vila Real de Sto. António\n\nLocated at the mouth of the Guadiana River, stretches along the dune belt between Vila Real de Santo António and Monte Gordo, a distance of about 3 km where you can walk quietly in one of several \"paths in the pine forest,\" noting the environment engaging. It has an area of ​​434 ha and is occupied mostly by maritime pine, planted in the late nineteenth century, with the aim of fixing the dune sands and protect urban areas. Also holds some localized patches of pine-nut. The National Forest of Vila Real de Santo Antonio Coastal Dunes plays an important role in protecting this region, working as a means of fixing the dune system, controlling the sea winds and harboring wildlife. Note the dune vegetation consists primarily of reversal (Ammophila arenaria), lambs-the-beach (otanthus maritimus), sea thistle (Eryngium maritimum) and narcissus-Marram Grass (Pancratium maritimum). Next to Monte Gordo there is a picnic area where you can relax in the shade of stone pines (Pinus pinea). The forest is home to a large population of chameleon, reptile you have here one of the last strongholds of their natural habitat. It is forbidden to catch, according to the Berne Convention. \" Besides Chameleon, other species of animals roam through the forest in search of food, a partner to mate or a place to breed. Among the resident birds, there is the Eurasian Collared Dove (Streptopelia decaocto), the Merlo-Black (merula Turtus) the Goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis) and the Blue Tit (Paruscae ruleus).\n\nCarob\n\nThe evergreen tree (lasting) also known as Ceratonia siliqua and Gingerbread John, of Mediterranean origin reaches about 10-20 cm tall, short and irregular trunk. The fruit is a pod long, almost black, fleshy and compressed, from 10 to 25cm in length, referred to as carob. The carob tree comes in hot and mild climates along the Mediterranean coast, in dry and rocky soils, mostly limestone. It is thought to be native to the eastern Mediterranean, having been introduced in the Iberian Peninsula by the Arabs. Due to its thickness and hardness was used by jewelers and goldsmiths as weight measurement. The sweet pulp of the fruit has food value and is used as a thickener in the confection of food and medicines. Carob avoids the use of sugar in the manufacture of products and is increasingly an alternative to chocolate because it is rich in vitamins and minerals and contains stimulants such as caffeine and theobromine. The seed represents only 10% of the bean and what remains is the pulp, used in some recipes. Carob flour is obtained by grinding and roasting pod pulp contains on average 48-56% of 18% fiber, 0.2-0.6% fat, 4.5% protein and high calcium content (352 mg / 100 g) and phosphorus. Currently widely used in the manufacture of cakes, carob flour does not alter the original recipes.\n\nAlmond Tree\n\nThe Almond (Prunus dulcis), also known as almond, coconut or almond-durázio has deciduous (weak), rough trunk and branched, it reaches eight meters in height. The almond tree, native to Asia Minor and North Africa, grew up, since antiquity, around the Mediterranean Sea, living in rocky places, road edges, limits of cultivated fields and farmland. The tree is characterized by its beautiful flowers, white or pale pink, which appear at the beginning of each year, creating a very beautiful setting. The flowers are pink before opening and more pale or white in their maturation, have a diameter ranging between 40 and 50 millimeters. It is gray-green color, with juicy cover enclosing the core known as almond, considered a nut. Of the two varieties of almond resulting two kinds of fruit: bitter almond, containing the prussic acid to which the nuts must their characteristic smell (which is used in medicine and in the liquor of manufacture) and sweet almond, used in confectionery, in the manufacture of oil and lubricants. It is in the months of January and February, cold months, that the landscape of the Baixo Guadiana turns pink -the almond trees bloom, a phenomenon that anticipates the spring and that is typical from Baixo Guadiana pure and natural.\n\nRockrose\n\nThe rockrose (cistus ladanifer L). belongs to the family Cistaceae contains opposite leaves glued to the base, long and narrow, with a trunk that reaches about two meters. The rock rose is an important element of the existing scrubland ecosystems of the Mediterranean climates, especially in non cancareous soils where they are often the dominant species. The flowers are large, with five white petals, sometimes with dark spots at the base and sticky which gives them a brilliant appearance when young and gray color as they age. The leaves have hairs on the underside and are fast growing. The wood is used for firewood and its branches and leaves are burned to cure sausages. The labdanum is used in perfumery, such as perfume fixative. The fruit is a globosa capsule containing numerous seeds.\n\nFig Tree\n\nFigs are the seed heads of the fig tree that belongs to the family of Moráceas.This species adapts to any soil, but develops better in deep, permeable, requires temperate climate and does not support frost. The fig trees are typically Mediterranean trees. They are fruit highly rich in sugar, fiber, organic acids and minerals like potassium, calcium and phosphorus, which contribute to the formation of bones and teeth, prevent mental fatigue and contribute to the normal transmission of nerve impulses. They can be consumed in several forms, fresh or dried. Fresh figs are widely used in the Algarve regional sweets such as full fig, cheese figs or fig Morgado, and jams. They are also a good addition, when adding to dishes of poultry dishes or hunting. Dried figs are usually consumed as an aperitif, alone or stuffed with almonds and walnuts. The area of ​​culture, in Portugal, is 7,127 hectares, and the domestic production of 2,150 tons (INE data, 2005). The areas most representative market are the Algarve, Tras-os-Montes and Torres Novas. The most commercialized varieties are Lampo White, Black Lampo, Vindimo White and Black Vindimo. The sale is done from the beginning of June until the end of September.

It has male and female flowers together on the same footing (monoecious flowering). The tree begins to bloom in February and ends in March. Its fruits, pine cones ripen in late summer of the second year and then release several seeds, known more commonly as pinion. In Portugal, the pines appeared spontaneously on the coast, sandy soils north of Tejo river, where they found good weather. Currently pine is across the country, due to the action of man. The maritime pine is 70% of the planted area of ​​Madeira and 40% of the forest area nationwide.\n\nStone Pine\n\nThe atone-pine is a species of pine, native to the Mediterranean region.

The Algarve Maçanilha is the main variety in the Algarve region and yet it was not recognized its enormous value as a variety of double aptitude (oil and table olives). It can be used both for obtaining oil by its high yield, as for table olives and size due to the size of the fruit. It has a high tolerance to cold, drought and salinity and an average rooting capacity. Productivity is average and alternating. The fruits are little resistant to the detachment, which allows mechanized harvesting. There are other varieties in the region as Verdeal, the Cordovil, the Galician and Cobrançosa. The olive campaign starts in September and ends in December. The highest concentration of olive occurs in barrocal and saw, with special focus on the municipalities of Tavira, São Brás de Alportel, Loulé, Albufeira, Faro, Olhão, Castro Marim and Alcoutim.
