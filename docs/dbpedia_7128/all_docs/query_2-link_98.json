        "text": "Tagus\n\n1,007 kilometres in length, the Tagus river is the longest in the country. Its first 816 kilometres run through Spain, crossing the autonomous regions of Extremadura, Castile-La Mancha, Madrid and Aragon.The river lends its name to the Alto Tajo Natural Park, which unfolds from the northeast of the province of Cuenca to the southeast of Guadalajara. This park has numerous trails; and what's more, it has 11 official routes. One of them is the path that connects the towns of Taravilla and Lebrancón, known as the route of Tagus viewpoints. During your tour of its three viewpoints you will be able to enjoy the views of the forests and canyons that open up between the course of the Tagus and Cabrillas rivers.Did you know about the geological wealth of this park? Discover it through its nine georoutes!\n\nEbro\n\nThe waters of the Ebro flow entirely through Spain. Specifically, they cover seven autonomous regions: Catalonia, Aragon, Navarre, Basque Country, La Rioja, Cantabria and Castile and Leon. It extends over 930 kilometres, making it the second longest river in Spain. However, it's most famous for being the river with the highest volume in the country. Aside from this, Ebro and its surroundings are a wonder of nature for several reasons. You can find out many of them by visiting the Delta de L'Ebre Natural Park, or touring the routes of Las Hoces del Alto Ebro y Rudrón Natural Park. The water of these two rivers flows between ravines and gorges in the northwest of Burgos, and comes out in springs such as the Fuente de Orbaneja.\n\nDuero\n\nOn the podium of the Spanish rivers with the greatest flow, the Duero is silver. This river is almost 900 kilometres long, of which 572 run through Spain. Its tributaries go through autonomous regions like Madrid, Extremadura, Castile-La Mancha, La Rioja, Cantabria, Galicia and Castile and Leon.The Arribes del Duero Natural Park extends between the northeast of the province of Salamanca and the southwest of Zamora. You can explore the scenery on foot, by bicycle or even on horseback! Most of its trails are low difficulty, since they cross valleys and old paths that lead to charming towns. But if you want to venture out to complete a long-distance path, go for the Sendero del Duero and the Sendero del Águeda.\n\nGuadiana\n\nAlong more than 800 kilometres, the Guadiana river bathes some territories of Andalusia, Castile-La Mancha and Extremadura. As it passes through the city of Merida, you will find a Roman bridge built over this river which, at almost 800 metres long, is considered one of the largest in Spain.The Guadiana Nature Trail is a long-distance path that follows the river along its course through sites like the beautiful landscapes of Ruidera the white village of Ayamonte and spectacular cities like Badajoz."
