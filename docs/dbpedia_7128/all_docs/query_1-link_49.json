        "text": "Vila Real de Santo António\n\nThe Guadiana River separates Spain from Portugal, on one side we find the last village of Andalusia (Ayamonte) and on the other the first of the Portuguese Algarve (Villa Real de Santo António). We can cross the river by ferry or by road via the Guadiana International Bridge.\n\nVila Real de Santo António, founded in 1776, is a must for visitors to the area. Apart from a charming and harmonious old town that was commissioned by the Marquis of Pombal after the Lisbon earthquake of 1755, the town is a paradise for home decor lovers. It is practically impossible to visit this village and not come back with a trunk full of pottery (plates, bowls, trays…), textiles (sheets, towels…) or food products such as the delicious salted butter, artisan breads or cakes or the rich Amarguinha.\n\nFrom the beach of Santo António just in front of the last beach of our Costa de la Luz (Isla Canela) we find 15 kilometers of fine sandy beaches, surrounded by pine trees and dunes until we reach Manta Rota. The beaches of the eastern Algarve, as well as ours, have much warmer waters than the ones in rest of the Algarve.\n\nThere are many good restaurants in the area but we especially recommend Sem Espinhas, Dom Petisco and Grand Beach Club.\n\nCacelha Velha y playa de Fábrica\n\nCacelha Velha is the perfect balcony overlooking the spectacular Ria Formosa. A natural park of 18,000 hectares protected by 5 islands: Barreta or Deserta, Culatra, Armona, Tavira and Cabanas.\n\nThe village itself is tiny but with a charm impossible to improve. Its square with the Matriz Church of medieval origin, its fortress and its simple white houses with touches of blue make the perfect Instagram posts.\n\nThere are several dining options. From tasting some oysters at Casa da Igreja, eating a seafood rice or cataplana at Casa Velha or a seafood at Costa, the restaurant next to Fábrica beach. A beach that is worth visiting and is listed by Conde Nast Traveler magazine as one of the best in the world. To access it you can walk (low tide) or cross in a boat for just 1 euro when the tide rises.\n\nTavira\n\nTavira, one of the most famous, picturesque and authentic villages of the Algarve, is just over half an hour from us. Strolling through its cobbled streets, crossing the Roman bridge over the river Gilao or eating in one of its many restaurants is the perfect weekend plan for those lucky enough to live in this area of the Atlantic.\n\nNature lovers also have the option of traveling along its 18 kilometers of beach by ferry, steam train or on foot. Wild, deserted and silent, the blond sand beaches are distributed in two islands, Tavira and Cabanas.\n\nWe highly recommend Barril Beach (on the island of Tavira), to get there you must take the steam train from Santa Luzia. You can also walk along a path parallel to the railway, so you can discover the fauna and flora of the Parque Natural da Ria Formosa. Along the way, you will find an anchor cemetery of the old fleet of tuna boats.\n\nFor lunch there is plenty to choose from but we love the new gastrobars like Comme Na Gaveta, Ti Maria or Artefact.\n\nOlhao\n\nOlhao is one of the towns in the Algarve that has best preserved its traditional character. Sightseeing in Olhao is visiting the Algarve as it used to be. Olhao is a mixture of beauty and chaos, common in other Portuguese urban centers.\n\nIt is worth taking a stroll through its market and enjoying a nice meal of fresh fish and seafood in the nearby restaurants.\n\nBeing in front of the Ria Formosa, you can visit the Natural Reserve or take a boat to the beaches of Armona and Fuseta.\n\nFaro\n\nThe capital of the Algarve and international airport of the area. Faro is the arrival point for many tourists. A city that embraces Portuguese history and culture. It highlights its Cidade Velha (old city), a magnificent testimony of Faro’s golden age in the 16th century, and the Ilha Deserta, a white sandy beach surrounded by the turquoise and crystalline waters of the Ria Formosa and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThere is life beyond the incredible beaches of southern Portugal. If you land in Faro, you will find several reasons to visit the capital of the Algarve. The historic center is bounded by a medieval wall, which still preserves constructions from other civilizations such as the Byzantine towers or the Arab gate. The narrow cobbled streets lead you through the great cultural heritage of the city: Vila Adentro.\n\nFaro has two large shopping centers and a wide range of restaurants. Restaurants such as Tertulia Algarvia or Vila Adentro highlight the traditional dishes of this area of the Algarve."
