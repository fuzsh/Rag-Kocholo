        "text": "Vila Real de Santo Antonio is a traditional Portuguese fishing town situated on the banks of the mighty Guadiana River.\n\nThe town has a peaceful, unhurried ambience and a truly unique appearance that is reminiscent of Lisbon - setting it apart from its closest neighbours.\n\nVila Real de Santo Antonio was constructed in 1774 to resettle the plague-ravaged fishermen from Aveiro, and also to claim the fishing waters of the eastern Algarve from Spain. The town was built in just two years, using similar architectural and construction styles to those used when rebuilding Lisbon after the 1755 earthquake.\n\nFound within this small town are numerous decorative Pombaline-styled buildings and a grand central plaza, which is also remindful of Lisbon.\n\nThe Centro Cultural AntÃ³nio Aleixo was originally the market of Vila Real.\n\nVila Real de Santo Antonio overlooks the cooling waters of the Rio Guadiana, with a marina, fishing harbour and pretty parks situated along the riverside. Departing from the harbour is a ferry that crosses the Portuguese-Spanish border to the town of Ayamonte, which was the main southern border crossing until the construction of the Puente Internacional bridge in 1991.\n\nTo the south of Vila Real de Santo Antonio are the pristine pine forests of the Mata Nacional das Dunas de Vila Real de Santo AntÃ³nio and the sandy beach of Praia da Ponta da Areia, one of the quietest beaches of the Algarve.\n\nWhile it is only a small town, there is a surprising amount to see during your visit. A day trip will often include crossing the Rio Guadiana to visit the Spanish town of Ayamonte, or a trip to the town of Castro Marim, with its two heavily-fortified castles.\n\nVila Real de Santo Antonio may not be as famous as other towns in the Algarve, but it makes for an enjoyable day trip or destination as part of a touring holiday.\n\nThis guide will show you why you should visit and how to get the most from the region.\n\nHighlights of Vila Real de Santo AntÃ³nio\n\nThe PraÃ§a MarquÃªs de Pombal â The grand plaza at the heart of this small town, named after the 18th-century prime minister who envisaged the town and oversaw its construction.\n\nThe ferry ride from Portugal to Spain - Cross the slow-flowing waters of the Rio Guadiana, the natural border between Spain and Portugal, and visit Ayamonte. Just remember that Spain is in a different time zone and is an hour ahead of Portugal!\n\nMata Nacional das Dunas de Vila Real de Santo AntÃ³nio â The pristine pine forests to the south of Vila Real de Santo AntÃ³nio, planted in the 19th century to stabilise the coastal sand dunes. Today the forest provides tranquil walks, deserted beaches and the perfect habitat for the Mediterranean chameleon (or Chamaeleo chameleon) to hide.\n\nThe scenic riverside walks â Stroll along the Rio Guadiana down to the mouth of the river at the Foz do Guadiana.\n\nVila Real de Santo Antonio holiday rating\n\nA day trip to Vila Real de Santo Antonio\n\nVila Real de Santo Antonio makes for an enjoyable day trip if you're based within the eastern Algarve. The town is certainly not the largest, but the varied sights and activities can easily fill a few hours of enjoyable sightseeing.\n\nA day trip to Vila Real is often extended by crossing the Guadiana River by ferry and visiting Ayamonte (in Spain).\n\nWarning: Your passport is required to cross the Portuguese-Spanish border and you could be asked to show it. Do not go into Spain without it.\n\nAn alternative way to extend a visit is to have a walk through the cooling Mata Nacional da Dunas Litorais pine forests. This leads to the deserted beaches at the mouth of the Rio Guadiana. If you have a car, you could visit Castro Marim, with its two castles, then see the flock of flamingos in the Sapal de Castro Marim nature reserve.\n\nVila Real de Santo Antonio lies at the eastern end of the Algarve regional railway, and it is easy to travel to and from the major towns of the central Algarve.\n\nThe map below shows a suggested day trip to Vila Real de Santo Antonio, along with the main sights of the region. The green line marks the tour of the town, the yellow line is the forest and beach walk to Monte Gordo, and the purple line is a tour of Ayamonte. (Note: Zoom out to see all of the markers)\n\nSights of the tour: 1) Centro Cultural AntÃ³nio Aleixo 2) PraÃ§a MarquÃªs de Pombal 3) Nossa Senhora da EncarnaÃ§Ã£o church 4) Guadiana marina 5) AntÃ³nio Rosa Mendes museum 6) Jardim da Avenida da RepÃºblica 7) Lighthouse 8) Ferry terminal 9) market\n\nSights around Vila Real: 10) Parque Aventura (High rope tree course) 11) Mata Nacional das Dunas forests 12) Praia de Santo AntÃ³nio 13) Praia da Ponta da Areia 14) Foz do Guadiana 15) Monte Gordo (resort town)\n\nNote: The train station is to the north of the town, but the area surrounding it is industrial and shabby in appearance.\n\nWherever you go in Vila Real, you will be able to spot the 40-metre lighthouse. This had to be built inland when constructed in 1923 due to the unstable sandbanks along the shoreline.\n\nA holiday to Vila Real de Santo AntÃ³nio\n\nVila Real de Santo AntÃ³nio is not a common location for a holiday, but for the right type of tourist it can be a fantastic choice.\n\nThe town is ideal if you are seeking a low-key and calm destination with a distinctly Portuguese atmosphere. Being a town, there is a decent selection of restaurants and cafes, and during the summer there is a sociable holiday atmosphere within cafes around the PraÃ§a MarquÃªs de Pombal.\n\nThis peaceful ambience makes Vila Real de Santo AntÃ³nio an ideal location for more mature visitors looking for somewhere in the Algarve to visit during the summer.\n\nThe are beautiful beaches reasonably close by, which lie 2.5km south of the PraÃ§a MarquÃªs de Pombal. However, this fairly long walk (or a taxi ride) means that the town should not really be considered as a beach destination.\n\nDay trips from Vila Real include the fortified town of Castro Marim, the Spanish border town of Ayamonte and the beach towns of Monte Gordo and Altura. Tavira is the best town of the eastern Algarve and can be visited as a day trip, but it is better to spend a couple of nights there.\n\nThe vast Praia de Santo AntÃ³nio beach.\n\nAccommodation and hotels in Vila Real\n\nVila Real Santo Antonio is only a small town, with a limited number of hotels and rental rooms that do quickly sell out in the summer months.\n\nThe standout hotel of Vila Real is the 4-star Pousada Vila Real Santo Antonio, which is housed in the characterful former customs house and sits on the PraÃ§a Marques de Pombal. The other recommended hotel is the 3-star Hotel Apolo.\n\nFor a touch of luxury, the Grand House hotel offers elegant rooms and views across the harbour and Guadiana River.\n\nThe map below shows the best hotels and rental rooms in Vila Real de Santo AntÃ³nio. If you adjust the dates to suit your holiday it will display current prices and availability.\n\nBooking.com\n\nIf the map does not load, please click here for details of Vila Real Santo Antonio's best accommodation options.\n\nInsight: When choosing accommodation for Vila Real Santo Antonio, make sure that it is actually within the town, as the bland beach town of Monte Gordo is often included in hotel searches of the region. Monte Gordo has many more hotel options but is a modern and characterless town that sits on a wonderful beach.\n\nIf you are touring the Algarve in a campervan, there is a basic campervan park overlooking the Rio Guadiana just to the north of the marina (GPS: 37.199, -7.415).\n\nThe beaches of Vila Real de Santo AntÃ³nio\n\nVila Real de Santo AntÃ³nio has a beautiful sandy coastline of pristine beaches. These are some of the quietest beaches of the Algarve and rarely get busy, even at the height of the summer season.\n\nThe beaches are part of the 14km stretch of sandy coastline that extends from the mouth of the Rio Guadiana in the east to the village of Cacela Velha in the west.\n\nThere are two beaches in Vila Real de Santo AntÃ³nio; the Praia da Ponta da Areia beach and the Praia de Santo AntÃ³nio. Areia beach is to the east and sits at the mouth of the Guadiana river. The Praia de Santo AntÃ³nio beach extends along the sand dunes and pine forests of the Mata Nacional das Dunas de Vila Real.\n\nBoth are beautiful beaches surrounded by sand dunes and offer kilometres of soft sands and calm seawaters. As these are remote beaches, there are no beach cafes, shops or facilities. There is a car park for both of them at the end of a dirt track (GPS: 37.174, -7.421)\n\nFor somewhere a bit more exclusive, try the Grand Beach Club, a trendy beach venue at the mouth of the Rio Guadiana that is owned by the Grand House hotel.\n\nWalking through the sand dunes to the Praia de Santo AntÃ³nio.\n\nThe Mata Nacional da Dunas Litorais de Vila Real de Santo Antonio\n\nTo the south of Vila Real de Santo Antonio are the sweet-smelling pine forests of the Mata Nacional da Dunas Litorais de Vila Real de Santo Antonio. This is the largest area of forest in southern Portugal, but it is barely known by foreign tourists. Within the 440 hectares of forest are deserted footpaths that lead down to the Praia de Santo AntÃ³nio.\n\nThe forest was originally planted to stabilise the regionâs sand dunes, and it is now one of the primary habitats of the Mediterranean chameleon (the Chamaeleo chameleon). Donât expect to see them though, as they are masters of camouflage and are naturally shy animals.\n\nWithin the forest is âParque Aventuraâ, an adventure course of high ropes, rope nets and zipwires. This is a great activity, and with three levels of difficulty it is suitable for children and adults alike. www.parqueaventura.net/vrsa/\n\nThe forest walks through the Mata Nacional da Dunas Litorais de Vila Real de Santo Antonio.\n\nOur most popular guides to the Algarve"
