The channel into the river is buoyed from about one mile off. Once the mole is passed, the deeper water is on the port side of the channel. Follow the buoyed channel upriver; the entrance to the marina of Ayamonte is just over 2.5 miles upriver on the east bank. Note: the strong tidal cross-current at the entrance can make entry difficult when a strong ebb is running. In 2010, depths at the marina entrance were reported to be as little as 1.5 - 2.0 metres at low water. In 2014 we crept over the bar at lws plus 2 hours BUT entry into the marina on the Portugese side is only open safely at hw and Ayamonte silts so is best 2 h either side of HW so there is little point in bashing the bar. (update needed).\n\nEntrance\n\nAyamonte is a port of entry for Spain. For details see Entrance: Spain.\n\nBerthing\n\nThe port is operated as a marina.\n\nCall Ayamonte Marina on VHF channel 09 or telephone: +34 959 321 694. [mailto: E-mai]. Alternatively, tie up to the first hammerhead and visit the marina office on the SE side of the basin. .\n\nMarinas & Yacht Clubs\n\nAnchorages\n\nIt is possible to anchor in the river off Ayamonte, although it is very uncomfortable with all the ferry and fishing boat wash. Better anchorages will be found above the suspension bridge or four miles to the east at Isla Cristina.\n\nHowever, to anchor one mile up the river is more comfortable. You can get into the marina by dinghy and get provisions at the closest supermarkets. The marina manager, Miss Vicky, is very friendly and speaks most languages. --ALFASEIS\n\nAmenities\n\nFacilities Water Water at the pontoons Electricity Electricity at the pontoons Toilets In the marina Showers In the marina In the marina Garbage Bins in the marina Supplies Fuel Fuel station in the marina Bottled gas ?

For the cruising yachtsman, the town is simply a staging post on passage to Gibraltar or for a trip up the beautiful Rio Guadiana, which is navigable by all but very deep draft (or tall-masted) yachts as far as the village of Sanlucar de Guadiana 35 miles inland. The river offers a rare opportunity to cruise calm and peaceful waters with rural Portugal to port and rural Spain to starboard.The suspension bridge across the river two miles upstream from Vila Real has a minimum clearance of 23 metres, but it may be better for your nerves if you pass under it near low water (my own crew renamed it the ‘Laxative Bridge’ - -Athene of Lymington). Shallow draft or lifting keel yachts can proceed with caution a further 12 miles as far as the village of Pomarão, although depths in the river are more unreliable in these upper reaches. The small village of Foz de Odeleite roughly halfway upriver to makes a convenient spot to stop overnight if the tide turns. There are mooring buoys in the river here which can be picked up if you do not wish to anchor.\n\nOn arrival at Sanlucar, berth alongside on the pontoon in the river off the town. The pontoon has water and electricity (a charge is made by a brusque Spanish official). Sanlucar is a very quiet and picturesque town and, if you arrive here during the afternoon siesta, you may be forgiven for thinking you have stumbled onto the filmset for a remake of ‘Fistful of Dollars’, with unseen bandidos eyeing you from the rooftops. Euro-flagged yachts (which do not need to clear out of Spain) can alternatively pick up one of the mooring buoys on the Portuguese side of the river off the town of Alcoutim (the tide runs quite strongly here - especially on the ebb - and care is needed). Alcoutim is an equally charming village and, like Sanlucar, has a strong castle showing solid defiance to its former enemy. A run ashore in the dinghy to Alcoutim allows you to explore its old Moorish castle and quiet, untouristy streets where yachtsmen still attract curious stares.\n\nFor further, excellent information on cruising the Rio Guadiana click on the link: A history of the Guadiana river.\n\nFriends\n\nContact details of \"Cruiser's Friends\" that can be contacted for local information or assistance.\n\nForums\n\nList links to discussion threads on partnering forums.
