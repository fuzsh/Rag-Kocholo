        "text": "Sharing is caring!\n\nThere are four places that I consider a must-see in and around MÃ©rtola:\n\nThe town of MÃ©rtola, of course, seat of the municipality on the banks of River Guadiana.\n\nThe surreal Mina de SÃ£o Domingos, with its fabulous Tapada Grande river beach.\n\nPulo do Lobo, one of the most impressive spots along the Guadiana River in Portugal.\n\nAnd the surroundings of ChanÃ§a Dam, near PomarÃ£o.\n\nDo you want to discover each of these places? In this article Iâll tell you all about what to do in MÃ©rtola and surroundings, so that you can make the most of the main landscapes that Guadiana Valley Natural Park has to offer.\n\nThis is still a largely unexplored region, a very different Portugal awaiting your visit!\n\nWhere is MÃ©rtola located, in Portugal?\n\nMÃ©rtola is close to the border with Spain (Andalusia). To the south is the fabulous Algarve, where youâll find some of the best beaches in Portugal. To the north are Serpa and Beja. And finally, it also borders two of the municipalities on the mythical National Road 2: Castro Verde and AlmodÃ´var.\n\nGuadiana Valley Natural Park has MÃ©rtola as its main entry point, so I canât fail to mention it. It covers around 70000 hectares and stretches from Pulo do Lobo area (between Serpa and MÃ©rtola) to the mouth of Ribeira de VascÃ£o on River Guadiana, bordering the Algarve.\n\nMORE ARTICLES FROM ALENTEJO AND ALGARVE: - Best Costa da Caparica beaches - Best beaches in SetÃºbal - Best Beaches in Sesimbra - Visit Ribeiro do Cavalo Beach - Best beaches in TrÃ³ia, Comporta and Melides - Best Beaches in Alentejo and Vicentine Coast - Things to do in Odemira and Vila Nova de Milfontes - Things to do in MarvÃ£o - Things to do in Elvas - Things to do in Estremoz - Things to do in Vila ViÃ§osa - Things to do in Monsaraz & Alqueva Lake - Things to do in Porto Covo and Sines - Things to do in Arraiolos - Best Things to do in Ãvora and surroundings - Things to do in Beja - Algarve Road Trip Itinerary - Best Beaches in Algarve - Things to do in Sagres - Things to do in Lagos - Best Beaches in Lagos - Things to do in PortimÃ£o - Things to do in ArmaÃ§Ã£o de PÃªra and Silves - The Seven Hanging Valleys Trail - Best Beaches in Carvoeiro - Best Beaches in Albufeira - Things to do in Vilamoura and Quarteira - Things to do in Faro - Things to do in Tavira - Things to do in OlhÃ£o - Things to do in Monte Gordo\n\nWhen to visit MÃ©rtola and Guadiana Valley Natural Park?\n\nSummer may not be the right time to visit MÃ©rtola, unless itâs a stopover point before or after a tour of the Algarve. The heat in summer is intense, and if you come at that time youâll only be fine at the Tapada Grande river beach in Mina de SÃ£o Domingos.\n\n1. Producersâ Market\n\nPay also attention to the regionâs main festivities. The Producersâ Market always takes place on the penultimate Saturday of each month, in the morning, in Rossio do Carmo square. It can be an excellent opportunity to get to know local products when you visit MÃ©rtola.\n\n2. MÃ©rtolaâs Gastronomic Events\n\nTÃºbera Festival in March (a kind of fungus that is considered the âTruffle of the Alentejoâ)\n\nRiver Fish Festival in April\n\nHunting Fair in October, after all MÃ©rtola is the capital of hunting in Portugal.\n\nHoney, Cheese and Bread Fair in April.\n\n3. MÃ©rtola Islamic Festival\n\nHereâs a link to MÃ©rtola Islamic Festival website, where you can find all the information you need about it. I think the theme is obvious, and the festival takes place every two years in May. This is perhaps the best time to visit MÃ©rtola!\n\n4. MÃ©rtola Town Festivities\n\nThey take place in June at Cais do Guadiana, and end with a traditional âsardinhadaâ (eating sardines).\n\n5. MÃ©rtola Radical\n\nA sports event that takes place in August with various activities in Serra de Alcaria, MÃ©rtola and Mina de SÃ£o Domingos (river beach).\n\nHow to get to MÃ©rtola and Guadiana Valley Natural Park?\n\nIt is possible to reach MÃ©rtola by bus (Rede Expressos), from the main cities in the country, such as Lisbon.\n\nHowever, MÃ©rtola is a very remote location in Alentejo, ideal for road trips, so my recommendation is that you rent a car, if you donât have your own. Do it with Discover Cars, which allows you to compare several rental companies before finding the best deal! A car will give you a lot of flexibility when traveling in Alentejo.\n\nGastronomy and Restaurants in MÃ©rtola and Guadiana Valley Natural Park\n\nAs this is the national capital of hunting, meat from hunting is the best option.\n\nI didnât try the TÃºberas, but they are also a possibility, as people say they are the truffle of the Alentejo.\n\nAnd then thereâs the typical Gaspacho, lamb stew, and Alentejo Migas.\n\nFor restaurants, I obviously recommend EspaÃ§o Casa Amarela. As Iâll also mention throughout the text that follows, this place has a great view of MÃ©rtola, and the food is even better. Thatâs where I had the pork cheeks in the photo below. Delicious!\n\nAccommodation tips to visit MÃ©rtola and Guadiana Valley Natural Park\n\nThings to do in MÃ©rtola and Guadiana Valley Natural Park\n\nTo visit MÃ©rtola and its surroundings, youâll need to pass through the historic center and then on to Pulo do Lobo, PomarÃ£o and Mina de SÃ£o Domingos. Iâm going to assume that your base of accommodation is MÃ©rtola, so Iâll start by sharing what to visit in the town.\n\nMap with things to do in MÃ©rtola\n\nVisit the Historic Center of MÃ©rtola\n\nThe first tip is not to take the car into the historic center, as itâs not easy to drive in those narrow, sloping streets. My recommendation is that you visit the town of MÃ©rtola on foot, starting, for example, from places near Rossio do Carmo Square. Thatâs exactly what I did. From there I went up to the castle (the most touristy area), down to river Guadiana, and back up again at the end.\n\nMÃ©rtola is in a place where remains of settlements dating back more than 5,000 years have been discovered. Various peoples settled there, long before the Arabs or even the Romans. In the Roman period it was Myrtilis and an important mercantile center, in the Arab period it was Martulah and the capital of an independent Arab emirate.\n\nIt was conquered from the Moors in the 13th century and from then on lost some of its importance in Portuguese territory. It gained new impetus, including population, with the start of mining in the 19th century, but half the population left the territory and never returned when the mines closed.\n\n1. MÃ©rtola Municipal Market\n\nThe Tourist Office is right at the entrance to the walled town, shortly after you pass MÃ©rtola Municipal Market. Find out about the townâs museum and its opening hours there, as there are various sections around the town that you can visit.\n\n2. Museum of MÃ©rtola\n\nThe House of MÃ©rtola and the Weaving Workshop are two parts of MÃ©rtola Museum, and are very close to the tourist office and the Mother Church. The first is a space that recreates a typical MÃ©rtola household in the mid-20th century, and the second shows you the artisanal process of weaving and decorating wool blankets in MÃ©rtola, with a clear Arab influence.\n\nThere are also other places to visit:\n\nThe Islamic Art Museum, with an exhibition of various archaeological remains found near MÃ©rtola that belong to the period of Arab occupation between the 9th and 13th centuries.\n\nThe Museum Center for Sacred Art, housed in the Church of MisericÃ³rdia. It exhibits sacred art objects (paintings and sculptures, for example), which have been removed from the regionâs churches and stored in the museum for preservation.\n\nThe Roman House Museum, which gives access to the remains of a Roman house discovered in MÃ©rtola Town Hall building after a fire at the end of the 20th century.\n\nThe Museum Center of the Paleochristian Basilica. It is located in Rossio do Carmo and gives you access to the results of the archaeological excavation carried out there. They found traces of an ancient basilica that existed before the Moorish occupation, and several graves.\n\nAnd the Blacksmithâs Forge Museum, which arose from the rehabilitation of the space where MÃ©rtolaâs last blacksmith worked: âTi Britoâs Forgeâ. In this museum you can find all the tools he used in his daily life, arranged as they were in the past.\n\n3. Mother Church of MÃ©rtola (Nossa Senhora da AssunÃ§Ã£o)\n\nNext up are the must-sees when visiting MÃ©rtola. Iâll start with the Mother Church, which was an ancient mosque from the Islamic period, transformed into a church after the Christian reconquest. Visiting the museum section of the Mother Church of Nossa Senhora da AssunÃ§Ã£o gives you access to information about the various phases of occupation of this place.\n\n4. MÃ©rtola Castle\n\nDue to its presence next to Guadiana river, MÃ©rtola has always been a point of communication between MÃ©rida and the Atlantic Ocean. Hence the need to defend and fortify it from an early age.\n\nMÃ©rtola Castle arose during the Arab occupation, but its keep was already built after the Christian reconquest, by the Order of the Knights of Santiago.\n\n5. MÃ©rtolaâs Citadel\n\nThe remains of MÃ©rtolaâs Citadel can be seen near the castle, and consist of the site where the Roman forum of MÃ©rtola was located and later an Islamic quarter. After the Christian reconquest, this site was converted into a cemetery, which helped preserve the archaeological remains, since nothing has appeared above the old buildings.\n\n6. Calvary Chapel, Elias Garcia Street and MÃ©rtola Bridge\n\nNext to the Calvary Chapel you have access to Rua Elias Garcia, which is perhaps the steepest street in MÃ©rtola! Believe me, you wonât want to do it the other way around! Itâs an unmissable street, from where you have access to good viewpoints of MÃ©rtola Bridge.\n\nIn the middle of the street youâll find one of the aforementioned sections of MÃ©rtola Museum: the Blacksmithâs Forge. At the end of the street, in the lower part of the historic center, there are two others: the Museums of Sacred Art and Islamic Art.\n\n7. Walls of MÃ©rtola, Guadiana Quay and River Tower\n\nAt the bottom of Rua Elias Garcia you will also find a dirt track that will take you to the Guadiana Quay, passing the ruins of the River Tower, also known as CouraÃ§a Tower. This tower is thought to be part of the structure of an old bridge in MÃ©rtola, but it also had a defensive function and allowed safe access to the river for water supply.\n\n8. MÃ©rtola Clock Tower\n\nOnce you reach the Guadiana pier, youâll find a path and staircase back to the historic center. It ends next to the Clock Tower, one of the most symbolic and photographed monuments in the town of MÃ©rtola.\n\n9. Hotel Museu\n\nOn the outskirts of the historic center of MÃ©rtola there are still a few places to discover. One of them is Hotel Museum, a real hotel built on the banks of River Guadiana, above the ruins of an old Arab quarter. It has a museum center to visit, with all the pieces found when the hotel was built.\n\n10. Cineteatro Marques Duque\n\nCineteatro Marques Duque is another tourist attraction in MÃ©rtola built on archaeological remains. Graves have been found there that are thought to belong to an extension of the cemetery of the Paleochristian basilica already mentioned.\n\n11. EspaÃ§o Casa Amarela and MÃ©rtola Viewpoint\n\nEspaÃ§o Casa Amarela is an excellent place to have lunch when visiting MÃ©rtola. In fact, this was one of the best restaurants I found while touring the Alentejo. Firstly, it has a privileged view of the town of MÃ©rtola from the other side of the river; and secondly, it serves delicious food. The black pork cheeks were so good that I devoured them in no time!\n\n12. Azenhas do Guadiana River Beach\n\nThe name of Azenhas do Guadiana river beach comes from the watermills built by the Order of Santiago along the Guadiana river, with the aim of harnessing the power of the river to turn grain into flour.\n\nIf you wish, you can opt for boat trips from MÃ©rtola, which go as far as Alcoutim, in the Algarve, or PomarÃ£o. You can also choose to rent a canoe and do a stretch of the river with it.\n\n13. Chapel of Nossa Senhora das Neves\n\nFinally, in MÃ©rtola, you must go up to the Chapel of Nossa Senhora das Neves, for another must-see viewpoint of the town.\n\nVisit Pulo do Lobo and its walkways\n\nPulo do Lobo is north of MÃ©rtola and should be your next stop. Itâs a great place for hiking when visiting the Guadiana Valley Natural Park.\n\nI accessed the place from the bank where the Herdade do Pulo do Lobo gate is (which you have to open and close as you pass through). From that side it was easy to get to the rock formations and the waterfall, despite the dirt road. On the other side, however, it seems to me that youâll have access to the best views, which I also got with a drone. ð\n\nMore than the waterfall or the waters of the Guadiana river, what impressed me most was how the river has sculpted that rock into the most varied shapes: a true marvel!\n\nPulo do Lobo is a secluded spot which, despite being the most famous in the Guadiana Valley Natural Park, retains its wild side. Here you can experience nature at its purest and most untamed.\n\nEDIT: Wooden walkways have recently been added to Pulo do Lobo!\n\nVisit PomarÃ£o and ChanÃ§a Dam\n\nNext to the ChanÃ§a dam, climb up to the PomarÃ£o Chapel for the best views of both the dam and Guadiana River in the south of the natural park. Half the dam is Portuguese, half Spanish!\n\nAt the end, walk down to the picturesque PomarÃ£o pier.\n\nVisit Mina de SÃ£o Domingos and Tapada Grande River Beach\n\nTo finish off your visit to MÃ©rtola and Guadiana Valley Natural Park, thereâs nothing better than the mining complex at Mina de SÃ£o Domingos. Itâs like entering a parallel world!\n\nWith my car, I took to the dirt tracks and explored the ruins to the side of Achada do Gamo, for me the most spectacular area of the mines, with its intense colors and old, abandoned sulphur factories. Apocalyptic scenery!\n\nBut the best and safest way is to take a guided tour with the SerrÃ£o Martins Foundation. See their website for contact details.\n\nThereâs also the marked pedestrian route (PR10 â Rota do MinÃ©rio), which takes you through the mining complex from Corta da Mina, through Moitinha Station, Achada do Gamo and finally the village of Santana de Cambas.\n\nDonât forget to visit whatâs left of the ore wharf, the old railway workshops, the Minerâs House, the Church of SÃ£o Domingos, the English Garden, and of course, finish your visit with a dip in Tapada Grande river beach.\n\nMina de SÃ£o Domingos had its ore exploited in various historical periods, namely in the Roman period, the Islamic period and also during the 19th and 20th centuries. It was this last period of exploitation until 1966 that really transformed the landscape and left it looking so surreal. That, and of course, the vandalization and abandonment to which it was subjected from then on.\n\nMillions of tons of ore were extracted from there! An entire village settled there because of the work in the mine. At its peak, more than 1,000 workers were employed there.\n\n1. Corta da Mina de SÃ£o Domingos\n\nIt is a space resulting from open-pit mining in the 20th century, and reaches a depth of 120 meters. The water that accumulates there is highly acidic.\n\n2. Malacate\n\nIt is an old iron structure whose purpose was to drain the water from the mine so that it would be possible to work dry inside.\n\n3. Ore Wharf\n\nThis was the place where the ore was separated to be sent either to Moitinha or to other factories in Mina de SÃ£o Domingos, via one of the first railroad lines in the country. It could even be sent by wagon to the port of PomorÃ£o, from where the ore was transported using River Guadiana.\n\n4. Moitinha da Mina de SÃ£o Domingos\n\nMoitinha was the place where the ore extracted from the mine was crushed.\n\n5. Achada do Gamo\n\nAchada do Gamo was the major intervention center for the ore extracted from the mine. Perhaps thatâs why itâs my favorite place, the one that most marks the landscape. It was, however, the most damaging to the environment, mainly because of the fumes released by the sulphur furnaces.\n\n6. Power Station\n\nIt was the first in the whole of the Alentejo, initially running on coal.\n\n7. Railway Workshops of Mina de SÃ£o Domingos\n\nIt was where all the maintenance of the equipment needed to work in the mine was carried out. Today they are collapsing, and only part of their structure remains.\n\n8. Minerâs House\n\nThe Minerâs House is part of MÃ©rtola Museum, but it is located in Mina de SÃ£o Domingos. In short, it is a replica of the house where a mining family lived in the 20th century. The mining families lived in a working class neighborhood, in small spaces and without much in the way of comfort.\n\n9. Cineteatro da Mina de SÃ£o Domingos\n\nToday it is an exhibition center on the history of the mining complex, but it was once a space dedicated to theater and cinema, available to the mining families who settled around the mine.\n\n10. Church of SÃ£o Domingos\n\nThe villageâs name of Mina de SÃ£o Domingos comes from the mine itself and also from the cult of Santo Domingo in the region. Although the church you see today is not the original one, nor the one that existed when the mine was being worked, it does represent this primitive hermitage.\n\n11. English Garden\n\nToday it is one of the villageâs most beautiful green spaces, but it once represented the separation of social classes within the village. The English, who owned the mine (Mason & Barry), had their own neighborhood, with superior conditions and comfort compared to the mining families.\n\n12. Tapada Grande River Beach\n\nFinally, the river beach at Mina de SÃ£o Domingos. The beach is located on the largest of the reservoirs created in the village during the 19th century (Tapada Grande) to supply water to the mine. Today it is one of the best and most well-prepared river beaches in Alentejo, with good support: bar, toilets, parasols, picnic tables, parking and surveillance. It has a blue flag and a sandy beach or lawn where you can spread out your towel. It is also possible to rent a canoe for trips around the reservoir.\n\nThe Best Trails in Guadiana Valley Natural Park\n\nAs far as MÃ©rtolaâs trails are concerned, Iâve listed below what I consider to be the best routes in the municipality, with links to wikiloc.\n\nPR1 â Guadiana, the Great River of the South\n\nA trail that starts from PoÃ§o dos Dois IrmÃ£os, near the town of MÃ©rtola, and follows one of the banks of Guadiana River to the mouth of Ribeira de Carreiras. Along the way, youâll pass the Old Convent of SÃ£o Francisco.\n\nItâs about 10km round trip. I only recommend this trail as one of the best in Guadiana Valley Natural Park because of its proximity to the river. My real favorites are the next ones.\n\nLink to wikiloc.\n\nPR9 â Between Escalda and Pulo do Lobo\n\nA trail near the fabulous Pulo do Lobo. If you prefer, just do the stage along River Guadiana, from Pulo do Lobo to Escalda Mill. Itâs about 6 km long.
