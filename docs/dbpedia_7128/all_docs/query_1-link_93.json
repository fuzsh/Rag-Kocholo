        "text": "In the context of growing demand, loss of quality, increasing regional scarcity, and global climate uncertainty, sustainable water management, as well as more integrated approaches to water planning, are crucial. This is receiving increasing attention through cross-cutting synergetic cooperation between hydrologists and other disciplines. International agencies such as UNESCO are promoters of this dialogue. UNESCO HELP is a cross-cutting programme aiming to improve the links between hydrology and the water needs for society. Complimentarily, the UNESCO Ecohydrology Programme aims to use knowledge about the integrated relations between hydrologic and biologic processes. The Guadiana River, on Portugal and Spain, is a UNESCO HELP basin, and in July 2009, an international HELP forum brought to the Guadiana experts from all continents to discuss, with the planning team and local community, experiences from river basins around the world. More opportunities for cooperation in the Guadiana basin were created with the additional classification of the basin as a Ecohydrology Reference Basin, in 2010. This paper discusses how this particular synergy can be beneficial to the planning process. Under the European Water Framework Directive, river basin plans must integrate ecological, social and economic dimensions. This challenge has proven to be more difficult than expected for European countries. Programs such as HELP and Ecohydrology can effectively support the planning process by improving dialogue between different disciplines, sectors and perspectives on water, resulting in a much richer consideration of the issues and possible solutions. The paper intends to stress the benefits that can be obtained through synergies between UNESCO programs operating within the same river basin."
