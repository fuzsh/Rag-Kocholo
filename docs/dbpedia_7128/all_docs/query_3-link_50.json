        "text": "The paper provides an overview of ambient vibration tests and numerical analysis performed in the framework of Project NATO SfP 983828. The aim of the research is the definition of the dynamic characteristics of bridges on the examples. The paper considers three case studies: two older existing bridges and one newly constructed bridge. A comparative analysis of natural frequencies and mode shapes, obtained by ambient vibration measurements (AVM) and mathematical models (AMs), was carried with the aim to demonstrate the usefulness of ambient vibration tests for identification of the modal parameters of the tested bridge structure. Agreement between AVM and AMs results is very good. The mode shapes are very similar. Some differences between computed and measured frequencies were obtained, which can be attributed to the real nature of the boundary conditions, the uncertainty in the material properties of structure elements, and the mathematical models assumptions.\n\nModal parameters (e.g., natural frequencies and mode shapes) describe the dynamic characteristics of bridge structures and their experimental identification is an important part of bridge assessment. More traditional experimental methods require artificial excitation by large equipment, which affects the normal operation of the bridge. However, reliable estimates of modal parameters can be extracted from ambient vibration caused by wind, traffic, environmental loads, etc. In this paper, the dynamic behavior of a 12 span, 700m long, curved, segmental, elevated concrete viaduct, recently constructed in Auckland, New Zealand, is investigated using ambient vibration tests and numerical modeling. Twelve vibration modes have been identified in the frequency range 0-10 Hz using two complementary modal parameter identification techniques: the peak picking method and stochastic subspace identification. Modal parameters estimated from ambient response have been compared with those obtained from a three-dimensional finite element model and good agreement demonstrated.\n\nABSTRACT: In order to evaluate the usefulness of approaches based on modal parameters tracking for Structural Health Monitoring of bridges, on September of 2007 a dynamic monitoring system with 12 accelerometers was installed on a concrete arch bridge that spans 280m over the Douro River at the city of Porto, in Portugal. This paper characterizes the bridge and its modal parameters (identified with an ambient vibration test), describes the monitoring hardware and the implemented software, reports the results obtained with the ...\n\nThe Chulitna River Bridge is a 790-ft five girder, five-span steel bridge on the Parks Highway between Fairbanks and Anchorage, Alaska. This bridge was built in 1970 and widened in 1993. Under the no-live load condition, five support bearings are not in contact. Heavily loaded trucks often travel across this bridge to the oil fields in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. A virtual finite element modeling, dynamic field testing of the ''ambient vibrational response,'' and structural health monitoring system are used to analyze, evaluate, and monitor the structural performance. As the first stage of the research, this article presents results from the dynamic testing and evaluation of the structural responses of the bridge. In the dynamic field testing, 15 portable accelerometers were placed on centerline along the bridge length to record the structural response, and an ambient free-decay response was used to evaluate the dynamic properties of the bridge structure. Natural frequencies and modal damping ratios were identified and characterized using Hilbert–Huang transform and fast Fourier transform methods. Compared with conventional approaches, this study demonstrates that (1) the Hilbert–Huang method was found to be effective and suitable for modal parameter identification of a long steel girder bridge using ambient truck loading; (2) the nonlinear damping was, for the first time, identified based on Hilbert–Huang transform's amplitude–time slope; (3) modal frequencies are very sensitive to sensor location so their position should be optimized."
