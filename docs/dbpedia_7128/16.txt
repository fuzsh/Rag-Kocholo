The Guadiana will be navigable upstream as far as Alcoutim from next Tuesday, November 3rd, according to General Directorate of Marine Resources.

The announcement was made during the seminar 'Opportunities and Structuring Projects in Cross-Border Cooperation' organized by the Odiana Association and held in Castro Marim.

"Since the work will finish between the International Bridge and the town of Alcoutim next Tuesday, it finally will be possible to navigate without restrictions," said Alexandre Santos Ferreira of Odiana, who presented the Guadiana project and the river's new role as a tourist attraction.

"It was clear at the seminar that the Portuguese and Spanish want to continue to cooperate to achieve more and better results in the development of the Lower Guadiana," added Ferreira.

The Mayor of Castro Marim Francisco Amaral announced that Odiana has already applied for EC funds for more associated projects.

Jos√© Parlon from the Huelva regional authority said, "We must look to the future and have continuity with more projects of this type that bring development to the territory. This support will serve to increasing cross-border mobility, which is the main objective of the Interreg programme."

The Algarve regional development board closed the event with a presentation about the new Interreg funding programme which the private sector now is allowed to access as long as projects demonstrate a strong cross-border element.
