The main railway station is a central railway junction, and the Frankfurter Kreuz is the most frequented road junction in Germany. Frankfurt am Main Airport is one of the largest international airports in the world and is Europeâ€™s leading airport for cargo. Because of airport-related activity and the presence of a number of large international companies, Frankfurt am Main is an important link in the European supply chain.\n\nThe European Central Bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and numerous other financial institutions are located in Frankfurt. Additionally, there are several German and European centers of foreign automobile groups. The largest economic sector is the provision of financial and insurance services, which employs around 74,700 people.\n\nPrologis operates numerous industrial properties and warehouses in the Frankfurt am Main region."
