        "text": "Cities to visit in Germany\n\nBerlin, a multifaceted metropolis\n\nIf you don't know what to visit in Germany, start with its capital. Berlin is a city that is hard to get around. Bubbling and creative, it seems to be constantly changing. Its architecture is very diverse and contrasts with the homogeneity of other German cities. In the German capital, you can admire famous monuments such as the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag Palace or the Charlottenburg Castle. Experience the atmosphere of East Berlin by strolling through the Friedrichshain district, along the East Side Gallery (a fragment of the Berlin Wall) or past Checkpoint Charlie. Those thirsty for culture and history will not miss visiting the Museum Island, the German History Museum or the Holocaust Memorial.\n\nMunich and the Bavarian conviviality\n\nBavaria's capital city holds many treasures. Start your visit at the historic heart of the city, Marienplatz, famous for its neo-Gothic town hall, carillon and St. Mary's column. Don't miss the Englischer Garten, one of Europe's largest parks, the Olympic Park or the magnificent Bavarian Government House. Fascinating museums such as the Bavarian National Museum, the German Museum and the BMW Museum are worthy of a visit. At the end of September and beginning of October, the Oktoberfest takes place. It is the perfect opportunity to discover Munich in a festive atmosphere. On the program: beer galore, Bavarian specialties, dancing and funfair.\n\nHamburg, meeting place for artists\n\nA major European port, Hamburg is the second largest city in Germany. It will surprise you with its rich architecture and dynamism. Crisscrossed by canals, this city is full of red brick buildings, like those of the famous Speicherstadt, or \"warehouse city\". Soak up the atmosphere of the city by strolling along the piers, the Nikolaifleet canal, the Kontorhausviertel district or the Jungfernstieg, the \"Virgin's Way\". Art lovers will appreciate the creativity of the Gängeviertel, the Bucerius Art Forum, the Kunsthalle and the Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nThe Romantic Road\n\nFor those unsure about what to visit in Germany, there is an ideal route: the Romantic Road, also known as Romantische Straße, which connects Würzburg to Füssen. On this 350 km route, you will have the opportunity to visit beautiful cities: Würzburg, the starting city, Rothenburg ob der Taube and its medieval houses, Nördlingen or Steingaden and the church of Wies. To end on a high note on this route, don't miss the famous Neuschwanstein Castle built in the 19th century, which looks like it came straight out of a fairy tale.\n\nEnjoying nature in Germany\n\nOn the wooded paths of the Black Forest\n\nHiking enthusiasts will have a blast on the trails of the Black Forest. This mountainous region covered with fir trees is dotted with natural gems like the Triberg waterfalls or Lake Mummel. Between two hikes, you can visit a typical village where you can visit cuckoo clock makers and taste the local specialties: ham, Black Forest cake and kirsch. For the best views of the region, follow the Bundesstraße 500, a scenic route of about 60 km. You can also visit Lake Titisee or climb to the Feldberg, the peak of the forest massif.\n\nWater fun at Lake Constance\n\nThe third largest lake in Europe, Lake Constance, or the Bodensee, is one of the places to visit in Germany, on the border between Austria and Switzerland. It has a mild climate, which explains the presence of vineyards and orchards. In the surrounding area, there is no shortage of places of interest, such as the prehistoric stilt houses of Unteruhldingen, the islands of Reichenau, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Lindau and Mainau, and the city of Friedrichshafen. Here you can enjoy sailing, kitesurfing, diving and of course swimming.\n\nAt the top of Germany: the Bavarian Alps and Saxon Switzerland\n\nAmong the places to visit in Germany are, of course, the Bavarian Alps, a hiker's paradise and a particularly touristy region. By train or cable car, climb to the top of the Zugspitze, Germany's highest mountain at 2,962 meters. From the top you can enjoy a breathtaking view of Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Austria. The Bavarian Alps are also home to places like the Partnach Gorge, a popular spot for whitewater sports enthusiasts. In the southeast of Germany, near the Czech border, lies Saxon Switzerland. This mountainous region crossed by the Elbe River contains impressive sandstone cliffs and spires. The must-see site is the famous Bastei, or \"bastion,\" which offers a panoramic view of the Elbe Valley.\n\nThe Baltic shoreline by bike\n\nWith so many highlights it is easy to forget that visitors can also enjoy the sea in Germany! To discover the Baltic Sea coastline, one of the best options is to follow the Eurovelo, or Baltic Bike Route. This bike path takes you from the Danish border to the Polish border, through relaxing coastal landscapes. Take a detour to the island of Rügen, but also to the cities of Rostock, Lübeck and Kiel.\n\nGo to Germany from Noumea\n\nTo easily reach Germany from Noumea, check out our Flight Noumea Berlin\n\nTravel time\n\nThe shortest travel time for a Noumea Berlin trip is 21 hours. This travel time may vary depending on your itinerary. Flights beyond the Aircalin network are operated by our partner airlines.\n\nTime difference\n\nIt is 9 hours later in Noumea, New Caledonia than in Berlin, Germany."
