        "text": "Transcript\n\nNARRATOR: Berlin or Bonn? In 1991 the question of the capital city is subject to passionate debate.\n\nMICHAEL HERBIG: \"Bonn always sounded a bit, well Bonn. Starting in the news, Bonn. It was really provincial, somehow. Please don’t get me wrong, but that’s how it was, Bonn.”\n\nFRIEDHELM OST: \"Bonn was straightforward. The government quarter was built on a grander scale. Everyone met everyone else three or five times a day. You just bumped into people. And of course Bonn did this republic a great service.\"\n\nNARRATOR: In 1949 this Rhineland town was only meant as a provisional solution. It didn’t find support from everyone.\n\nANTONIUS JOHN: \"Tactical reasons played their role and utilitarian considerations - and I want to put this very carefully - utilitarian considerations that had been helped on their way. There was even an enquiry into blackmail.\"\n\nNARRATOR: Konrad Adenauer is a devoted Rhinelander. He backs Bonn over Frankfurt. The Old Man, as the chancellor is known, relishes the home advantage. In the following 40 years, the second republic becomes the first stable democracy on German soil. Bonn isn’t Weimar, they say. Six German chancellors go into office here, even after the former GDR joins West Germany in 1990. But with unification, the question of the capital comes up again. Bonn or Berlin? It’s a passionate debate.\n\nWILLY BRANDT: \"Berlin was an outpost of freedom in hard times. It doesn’t deserve to be palmed off with an honorary title without real content.\"\n\nNORBERT BLÜM: \"Bonn has not done its duty and can go.\"\n\nNARRATOR: Again, the vote is tight. It’s for Berlin. Relief and jubilation at the Spree. Where barbed wire and the wall once cut through the city, the biggest building site in Europe begins to take shape.\n\nOST: \"Of course Bonn did do a great service to the republic. Without the forerunner Bonn, the jump to Berlin wouldn’t have worked so well.\"\n\nNARRATOR: Many signals are set with the vote for Berlin.\n\nMANFRED GÖRTEMAKER: \"Since 1990 we have something new, which can definitely be described as the Berlin Republic. It is a term that underlines that things haven’t just changed in the GDR, but also in the German Federal Republic and in Europe and in the world.\"\n\nNARRATOR: The historical building dates back to the empire. The members of Parliament are aware of its controversial history.\n\nWOLFGANG THIERSE: \"We all agree that Berlin will stand for freedom and democracy, and for European politics.\""
