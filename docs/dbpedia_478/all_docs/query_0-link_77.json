        "text": "People move to Germany for various reasons and by various means. Some secure a job offer, while others aim for a specific city. Let’s talk about some German cities that might interest those working in IT.\n\nAnd by the way, wherever you move, be it Germany or Europe, keep in mind the Profee money transfer service. It allows you to send money across the EU and to Russia easily. And unlike the choice of the city to live in, the service is a fit-for-all solution.\n\nBerlin\n\nLet’s start with the obvious. Berlin is the IT capital of Germany as well as its largest city and the actual capital. Naturally, it hosts the headquarters of many international digital companies, such as GitHub or SAP, that hire qualified staff all the time. In Berlin, there are also many employment opportunities with German companies. Among those are world-renowned SoundCloud or the N26 bank that aims to revolutionise the industry. In addition, Berlin is one of the global startup centres. In 2020 alone, startups here absorbed over $2 billion in investment, and in 2022, the number of promising startups exceeded 100.\n\nBesides many career opportunities, Berlin is a great city to live in. The German capital is famous for its efficient public transport system available anytime, anywhere around the city. Life in Berlin is not cheap, but it’s still less expensive than in many other European capitals. There is a local airport which allows you to easily plan your travels, but the city itself has much to offer too, from famous museums to equally famous night clubs. Last but not least, Berlin is a multicultural city; many locals speak English and there are Russian, Turkish, Arab and other diasporas.\n\nMunich\n\nMunich is another option for IT experts who are considering moving to Germany. It is known for its rapid growth, and a few international companies have offices both in Berlin and here, including Amazon and Microsoft. It is the Munich offices that often offer more vacancies.\n\nIt is not cheap to live in Munich, but the average salary of a software engineer, according to Glassdoor, is even higher than in Berlin. In addition to a major airport, globetrotters may appreciate the city’s proximity to Austria, Italy and Switzerland. Munich boasts many historical buildings as well as a 5km-long park and the most famous German brewery.\n\nHamburg\n\nHamburg is the second-largest city in Germany. Compared to Berlin or Munich, its rhythm may seem a bit slower, but its opportunities are equally plenty. It is Hamburg that hosts the German headquarters of Facebook, Twitter and Twitch. Hamburg is an ideal place for those who aim to have a career in the gaming industry, as many companies here are involved in game development.\n\nOn average, salaries in Hamburg are lower than in Munich or Berlin, but life is cheaper here too. Besides many beautiful cathedrals and museums, it is a port city with its own ambience: Hamburg is situated on the Elbe, close to the North Sea. It’s easy to find new friends here, including among expats.\n\nNo two cities in Germany are alike, each with its own character, its pros and cons. But the questions newcomers ask are all similar: how to find a reliable insurance, how to rent a place, or how to send money back home. Money transfers to your home country help you support the family there, pay your mortgage, or deposit your money. In any of these cases, Profee is there for you because regardless of why you need to send money, you want your transfer always to be…\n\nConvenient\n\nProfee has a website and an app, both with a user-friendly interface. Profee offers multiple ways to transfer money, including by card, by Apple Pay or Google Pay, or from a bank account (via Sofort). The quality and security of transfers are always top-notch, which means you can choose any format that is the most convenient for you.\n\nFast\n\nCard-to-card transfers with Profee are basically instant; bank wires might take a bit longer, but that’s due to the internal procedures of European banks. In any case, the money is deposited within the shortest time possible.\n\nSecure\n\nProfee is an officially licensed European company operating by the standards of and according to the EU regulations. Users in dozens of countries trust Profee, as its rating on the Trustpilot review platform shows (4.7/5). The company’s security certificates are regularly updated. In addition, Profee not only meets all the usual regulatory requirements but also develops its own state-of-the-art solutions, including those for data protection.\n\nBeneficial\n\nProfee always offers the best currency exchange rate, thanks to its own intelligent monitoring system, and always pleasantly surprises its customers. Moreover, there's no commission for your first transfer/\n\nProfee is a modern fintech solution. It’s an ideal service if you plan on moving your IT career to Germany, regardless of the city you eventually choose."
