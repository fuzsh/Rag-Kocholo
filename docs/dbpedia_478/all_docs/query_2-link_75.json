        "text": "Since Germany reunified in 1990, Berliners have often made parks and green spaces from the city’s former ruins. Part of the once-militarized, now-fallow border strip of the former Berlin Wall has been designated as a landscape conservation area and is being transformed into a 9-mile-long chain of parks, meadows and urban woodlands. Meanwhile, the runways and fields of Berlin’s century-old Tempelhof Airport, which closed in 2008, have been reborn as a 740-acre public gathering space—areas of which are also grazed by sheep.\n\nThe instinct to allow nature to reclaim disused spaces in the city stems in part from Berlin’s history as a pioneer in establishing the value of biodiversity in cities. “Berlin is called the cradle of urban ecology,” says Ulrich Heink, the head of the Charlottenburg Wilmersdorf Department of Nature Conservation.\n\nIn the 1970s, an ecologist named Herbert Sukopp began studying the vegetation that had sprung up in the “Brachen,” or fallow spaces, of Berlin’s urban fabric. Over time, Sukopp succeeded in demonstrating that cities, far from being denuded wastelands, are rich in species and often develop novel ecosystems distinct from those outside the city limits. “He introduced the idea of urban ecology worldwide,” Heink says.\n\nIn the coming century, cities like Berlin will only become more important as refuges for vulnerable species. Some species have already carved out ecological niches for themselves. Peregrine falcons, for instance, exhibit higher rates of reproductive success in urban areas than in rural ones. According to an international team of researchers, cities can even foster larger and more diverse bee populations than the surrounding countryside.\n\nAll of this makes reclaimed natural spaces like those being cultivated at Wilmersdorf Stadium important green pockets throughout the city. “Urban sites have huge potential for nature conservation,” Heink says.\n\nThe stadium project is one of several investments being made through TNC’s Urban Greening Program. According to Jamie Chan, who is leading the program, TNC is also working with local officials in Berlin, Stuttgart and a third, yet-to-be-announced municipality in Germany to identify opportunities for green infrastructure and other nature-based solutions that can help mitigate severe effects of climate change.\n\nIn Berlin, that means addressing urban flooding, extreme heat, and access to green space, says Rob McDonald, the lead scientist for nature-based solutions at TNC. Scientists predict that a warmer climate will produce more frequent and severe storms, as Europe saw in 2021, when catastrophic flooding tore through several countries, including Belgium and Germany, killing more than 200 people. Of equal concern, McDonald says, are deadly heat waves—already the most fatal of all weather events.\n\nNorthern European cities ill-adapted to hot climates will be hit especially hard, says McDonald. “Nobody has air-conditioning, you’re in big stone buildings often, and when you get heat events that last multiple days, they become like ovens.”\n\nWarmer temperatures will affect more than the city’s human inhabitants. In the summer, Berlin can be as much as 9 degrees warmer than areas outside the city, creating an environment in which non-native species from hotter climates can thrive. “We can bemoan this situation and call it unnatural,” Heink says. “But it’s also a chance to have a very specific flora and fauna, which is part of what forms the biological identity of Berlin. There’s potential in that.”\n\nHeink and the scientists at TNC planned for just such a future at Wilmersdorf. In the seed mix used to revegetate the stadium’s former grandstand areas were seeds of species native to warmer climates—a hedge against the coming heat. A team from the Technical University of Berlin will monitor the project and measure changes in biodiversity over time.\n\nFor now, Heink is pleased with one of the unexpected benefits of the sheep: public delight. For the three weeks the animals were present, they served as incidental ambassadors of the kind of work his department and TNC are trying to do. Families with small children seemed to spend as much time watching the sheep as they did playing. “When the sheep were there, everybody was fond of them,” Heink says. “I think [the project] has huge potential in terms of environmental education.”"
