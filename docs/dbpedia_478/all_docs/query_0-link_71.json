        "text": "The state capital of Dresden extends across 328 square kilometers and has approximately 541,000 residents. Dresden is perfectly linked with the international transit network, and can be reached from every direction by rail, car or air. In terms of geographical size, Dresden is Germany’s fourth-largest city after Berlin, Hamburg and Cologne.\n\nThe city stretches out on both sides of the Elbe River and is embedded in the foothills of the East Erzgebirge Mountains, the Elbe Sandstone Mountains and the Lausitz granite plate, 113 meters above sea level. The 383-meter Triebenberg Mountain is Dresden’s highest point, and is located in the Schoenfeld highlands. Its lowest point is in the district of Cossebaude, 101 meters above sea level. The Elbe River snakes its way through the city with a length of 30 kilometers. Nine bridges provide crossing points throughout the city. With 62 percent of its area covered by forest and green space, Dresden is one of the greenest cities in Europe. Within the city limits there are 3 nature sanctuaries, 11 landscape conservation areas and 112 natural monuments. Numerous public parks and recreational areas complete Dresden’s green spaces. Dresden is considered a city of art and culture, but it is also an important technology hub. A network of research, science and culture has been established in the city, with a total of nine colleges and universities. The Technische Universitaet, with 33,506 students, is one of the largest universities in Germany. Helma Orosz (CDU) was Mayor of Dresden from August 2008 to July 2015. Her successor Dirk Hilbert (FDP) was recently elected as the city’s new Mayor and will enter office in August 2015."
