        "text": "Germany's mix of history, culture, industry and beautiful natural scenery have led to rapid growth during the years and one of the largest populations in the world. Germany has three cities that each have over one million residents, which contributes to the high population numbers. However, it also has small- and medium-sized cities and towns that contribute to its overall population. Almost 100 of the country's cities boast populations of over 100,000, while over 1,500 cities have populations that exceed 10,000 residents. In total, Germany's cities and towns number 2,059 as of early 2016. The cities are divided among the country's 16 federally-designated states. The state of Bavaria encompasses over 300 cities and towns, while Hamburg and Berlin are made up of just one city each, with both being two of the most populous cities in the country. When it comes to the total size of Germany, it is just the 63rd largest country in the world. which makes its rank as one of the most populous countries even more impressive.\n\nGermany has always had a much higher urban population than those who live in the rural areas. In 1960, just 29 percent of German residents lived in rural areas. In 2015, this number had declined to 25 percent, reflecting an increase in the amount of urbanized space and relocation and immigration to the more developed areas of the county."
