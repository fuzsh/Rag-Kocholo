        "text": "At MMG we provide English-speaking mortgage advice throughout Germany so we’ve put together some useful profiles relating to ten German cities to help expats decide on the best place to purchase their property.\n\nBerlin\n\nThere are many parks in the German capital. If you’re seeking a capital city with plenty of green spaces, Berlin is that city. Post-unification, there is little left of the split between East and West Berlin with the exception of parts of the Berlin Wall. The vibrant graffiti of the wall is a beautiful testament to a darker time in Berlin’s history.\n\nIn an economic zone where major cities are expected to be megalopolises, Germany’s capital is the exception that proves the rule with its three-million-strong population. By which we mean it’s not overcrowded and Germany itself is spread over a more decentralised area, in terms of industry, commerce and politics, than other countries of its size.\n\nThe Brandenburg Gate, completed in 1791, is among the most famous monuments in Germany. It derives its name from the fact that it marks the start of the route out of Berlin to the town of Brandenburg an der Havel, a town of historical significance due to its importance in the Holy Roman Empire. Today, it’s also a very effective party venue every New Year’s Eve and a great location for public celebrations.\n\nBerlin has a well-earned reputation as a centre for start-ups. It’s a major hub for pharmaceuticals, technology, and the creative industries. Babelsberg Studio is the oldest large studio complex of its kind in the world, producing its movie-making magic since 1912.\n\nBerlin Zoo is a big draw, as one of the most popular zoological gardens on the planet.\n\nWith a number of major universities (both STEM and arts-oriented) and convention centres in its environs, and its complex network of public transport, Berlin is certainly open for business if people choose to conduct their work there.\n\nIf you’re thinking of moving to Berlin, check out www.BerlinExpats.com for lots of useful information and networking opportunities.\n\nDusseldorf\n\nThe green space of Dusseldorf is a fine touch in this city rich in culture; a trip across the Rhine river from the city itself sees a whole swathe of open lawn for people to picnic and play on. This is a land bank that continues for miles along the Rhine. Across the bridge too is the old quarter of Kaiserswerth, which contains the best elements of a seaside town, German-style! Not seaside, but rather riverside on the world-famous waterway! Indeed, to suggest that it’s on a par with the seaside towns typically found on the English or eastern US coastlines is to do it a disservice. This modest little town with its main square, Kaiswerwerther Markt, has a village atmosphere and is known for the ruins of a twelfth century castle. The quaint suburb is a kaleidoscope of baroque architecture, with cobblestoned streets full of stores, gift shops and boutiques, all selling artisan products.\n\nDusseldorf is known for its arts scene, its fashion industry and its culture. Konigsallee and Schadowstrasse are just two of its streets famed for their boutique shops. The seventh largest city in Germany was also the “sixth most livable city in the world” according to the Mercer Quality of Living Survey – and it’s remained consistently in that position for some years.\n\nFrankfurt\n\nFrankfurt is a world finance centre. The home of the European Central Bank, it is likely to benefit from Brexit because of London’s status as another centre of world finance. Although smaller than other cities known for their banks and stock exchanges, including New York, Singapore and Hong Kong, Frankfurt could easily develop to take these megalopolises on as the home or headquarters for any number of financial services companies. Frankfurt is also home to the tenth largest stock exchange in the world by some tallies, and the largest of Germany’s seven stock exchanges.\n\nFrankfurt’s something of an ethnically and culturally diverse melting pot, with a largely young population and a lot of migrants – a staggering quarter of the population is non-German.\n\nFrankfurt’s Bankenviertel district is home to a panoramic skyline of high rise buildings. It has the nickname Manhattan as a result!\n\nFrankfurt’s Altstadt is the Old Town. Featuring a line of half-timbered houses and Gothic Frankfurt Cathedral, it is also the location of three houses that have been used as the city hall since the early fifteenth century. With its focus on various styles and eras such as Medieval, Renaissance and Classical, the Städel Museum on the bank of the Main is home to seven centuries of art. Frankfurt is historically famed as a seat of kings. As a financial powerhouse, today the city could be regarded as a different kind of kingmaker.\n\nFor helpful tips and information visit www.FrankfurtExpats.com.\n\nCologne\n\nBoth one of the warmest and one of the cloudiest cities in Germany, caveat emptor: Cologne is also located in one of the most flood-prone regions of Germany. However, don’t let that hold you back from checking it out for property. The fourth largest city in Germany is replete with culture, with a Roman wall, various churches, and a plethora of museums.\n\nCologne Cathedral – also known as the Cathedral Church of St. Peter – is a remarkable landmark in the region due to its epic scale, its double spire and gilded reliquary both major attractions.\n\nCologne is 2,000 years old. Although it still retains that Roman wall, there is little else remaining from the period. However, it is characterised by its architecture in the High Gothic style. Cologne’s Aldstadt or Old Town is a great area in which to go for a beer and soak up the local atmosphere. On the flipside of history, Cologne has a postmodern quarter too, on the Rhine river.\n\nIf Cologne is your city of choice, check out www.CologneExpats.com for lots of useful information.\n\nMunich\n\nFamed for its Oktoberfest, Munich is very much a German city. Bavarian hospitality is first on its calling card. However, its architecture, parks, stadiums and cultural amenities also on the list. The beer halls are always welcoming.\n\nBogenhausen, Maxvorstadt, and Au-Haidhausen are three areas of Munich worth checking out for property ownership. Bogenhausen is the largest borough of Munich. It’s upmarket, with boutiques and jewellery stores. Fans of designer products will find their favourite labels there. Maxvorstadt is the university district, characterised by its galleries and museums. Bookstores and student pubs vie for space alongside trendy restaurants that cater to lovers of all kinds of cuisine. Finally, Au-Haidhausen is another borough – the amalgamation of the Au and Haidhausen districts of the city. Historically an area housing many hostels for tradespeople, today it has transformed into another trendy borough of Munich.\n\nIf you are considering Munich to settle in as your new home, check out www.Munich-Expats.com for more information.\n\nHamburg\n\nCharacterised by its canals and status as a major port, Hamburg in Northern Germany has culture, history and a lake in its centre.\n\nOne sight the German tourists who visit Hamburg recommend is the Miniature World – the largest model railway and miniature world of its kind in the whole world. It claims to have had over ten million visitors – and it seems to draw a million a year – so it’s worth booking ahead. Opening at nine am, it might be worth getting there early too. Set over two storeys, the world in miniature has a number of areas, like the Scandinavian section, for instance – showcasing nations and regions mainly of Europe.\n\nHamburg is a sprawl – its metropolis extends farther than most major cities, and it’s very spread out.\n\nSt. Michael’s Church is known for its statuary. It has a very large and impressive organ. Baroque in architectural style, this church is not too ornate – perhaps because it’s Lutheran (and one of the few purpose-built Lutheran churches in the region – many others were converted from Roman Catholic churches).\n\nAnother famous place of worship in Hamburg is St. Nikolai’s Church. Bombed during the Second World War, its ruined aspect has been retained as a war memorial. The church administrators allow access to its spire for views over the city – but you’ll be charged a small fee.\n\nThe café-lined Inner Alster Lake is among the attractions in Hamburg. For an urban centre that is a few miles inland, a surprising amount of the city is on the water. A river-bound ferry allows travel across Hamburg using the standard travel passes of the Hamburg people, but many of the smaller boats that are available for hire can access the narrower channels and canals. There are thousands of bridges throughout the city too.\n\nWhy not visit www.HamburgExpats.com to find out more.\n\nStuttgart\n\nWith its S-Bahn overground railway system, Stuttgart is well-served in terms of public transport. Throw in its newer U-Bahn – a sometimes underground, sometimes trolley-type system – and you can travel in air-conditioned comfort.\n\nStuttgart is the sixth largest city in Germany. An urban centre that is today famed for its automotive industry was once known for its horses. The derivation of its name means “Mare’s garden / Stud garden”.\n\nMercedes-Benz and Porsche are both headquartered here, and both have museums. The Mercedes-Benz Museum can be found in a 55-hectare complex on the Neckar River. The complex is an events and entertainment venue as well as the home of the Mercedes-Benz Arena, stadium of the football team, VfB Stuttgart. The Mercedes-Benz museum really impresses, but petrol-heads will be equally happy with a visit to Porsche’s smaller, albeit top-class offering.\n\nThis home to the German car industry also features some laudable public park amenities. The city’s centre is surrounded by green space, with numerous parks to visit. A wander through the Schlossgarten, Rosensteinpark or Killesbergpark is a nice way to spend an hour.\n\nRosenstein Castle is an example of classical architecture with its columned portico, originally built as a summer palace for the kings of the region in the 1820s. Meanwhile, just north-east of that is Wilhelma, a zoo of international renown.\n\nIf you are considering Stuttgart to settle in as your new home, check out www.StuttgartExpats.com for more information.\n\nIngolstadt\n\nIngolstadt, on the banks of the River Danube, is home to the headquarters of Audi and is cited in Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel Frankenstein as the birthplace of the eponymous scientist’s monster, so it has numerous impressive cultural “credits” to its name, despite being only the fifth largest city in Bavaria. First granted city status in the mid-thirteenth century, Ingolstadt is also the original home of the Illuminati, a secret society founded in 1776 whose goals included undermining abuses in state power and opposition to superstition and church control. The Illuminati name has since been embraced by various sects and esoteric groups who claim links to the original Bavarian society. It’s also been richly explored in many works of fiction – often thrillers with historical fiction elements – by novelists such as Dan Brown.\n\nIngolstadt is a scenic city beyond its impressive Gothic and Baroque architecture, with plenty of green space to explore on bike or on foot. The Glacis was originally a prominent open space in front of the historical city walls. Today, it surrounds the city centre.\n\nPostwar, Ingolstadt became the home of the Audi car company, after the automobile manufacturers were forced from East Germany to West. The town also calls Audi’s flagship museum its home. This museum, which offers guided tours, is open to the public, with a number of historic exhibits. If you prefer public transport to private, the town of Ingolstadt is served by two train stations, one of which links directly to Nuremberg.\n\nIf you are considering Ingolstadtto settle in as your new home, check out www.IngolstadtExpats.com for more information.\n\nDresden\n\nThe capital of Saxony has a population of more than half a million. Its urban area includes other towns and has a population of three quarters of a million. Once known as the Jewel Box, the city centre was characterised by its baroque and rococo architecture. However, in February 1945, the bombing of Dresden by the Allied Forces in World War II killed 25,000 people and destroyed the city centre. Reconstruction and refurbishment has meant that buildings of the city centre have been restored and rebuilt to their original dimensions. Among the ten largest universities in Germany, Dresden University of Technology has over 30,000 students. Volkswagen has its Transparent Museum in Dresden, where you can see how cars are produced.\n\nDresden’s economy is high tech and known for its dynamism; the area is nicknamed “Silicon Saxony”. If you’re looking for culture, the eighteenth century Frauenkirche dominates the Dresden skyline; although it was left as a ruin and war memorial for decades, it has been rebuilt since its destruction during the Second World War and now delights both tourists and locals once again with its domination over the city.\n\nLeipzig\n\nAt first glance – with its 600,000 strong population – Leipzig appears to be a neat little city. But there is plenty to do and see, both in the city itself and its environs. The residence of Johann Sebastian Bach, Leipzig is a former East German city that’s touted as the New Berlin. Beyond Berlin itself, it’s the biggest urban centre of the former Eastern bloc country – that is, the largest city in the former East Germany with the exception of East Berlin.\n\nThe city centre has as its focus the main square, with twice-weekly markets, street performers and shops. There are pubs too, and street food available to chow down on while you soak up the local atmosphere.\n\nBonn\n\nThe former capital of West Germany has an international flavour. However, it has the quaintness of a much smaller village about it. Founded in the first century BC by the Romans, for more than forty years in the twentieth century it was the West German capital. However, it has some previous history as a capital: From 1597 to 1794, Bonn was also the capital of the Electorate of Cologne. It was also the seat of the Archbishops and Prince-electors of Cologne. Beethoven was born and spent his childhood in Bonn and the city celebrates the fact of his birthplace with Beethoven House, a memorial and museum. The five-spired Bonn Cathedral is worthy of a visit. First a Roman temple stood on the site, then a Christian church before one of Germany’s oldest extant cathedrals was built there, between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries. Other landmarks include Bonn’s botanical gardens and a “Museum Mile” with a number of museums celebrating everything from mathematics to natural history. In keeping with its status as a former capital of West Germany, the city also boasts a United Nations campus."
