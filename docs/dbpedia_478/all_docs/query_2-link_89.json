        "text": "About the map\n\nGermany is a country in Central Europe, known for the mountainous Alps, forested plateau, and lowland terrain in the north. Germany has a population of over 83 million people. The capital city is Berlin, and other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, and Frankfurt. The German landscape is varied, with forests, mountains, rivers, and plains.\n\nGermany borders Denmark to the north, Poland and the Czech Republic to the east, Austria to the southeast, Switzerland to the south, France to the southwest, as well as Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands to the west. It also shares a coast with the North Sea to the northwest and the Baltic Sea to the northeast (also known as the German Riviera).\n\nGermany in Google Maps\n\nSATELLITE IMAGERY\n\nGermany Satellite Map\n\nApproximately 33% of Germany is covered in forests, which includes the Black and Bohemian Forests. The major rivers that cut through Germany are Elbe, Weser, Danube, and Rhine Rivers. Lake Müritz in northwestern Germany occupies an area of over 110 square kilometers (42 square miles).\n\nIf you don’t include Lake Constance (which spans Austria and Switzerland), this makes it the largest lake in Germany. The Ore Mountains (Erzgebirge) span the southeastern region, a UNESCO heritage site with a history of mining through the Middle Ages.\n\nPHYSICAL MAP\n\nGermany Elevation Map\n\nThe terrain in Germany is mostly lowlands in the north. Then, it transitions from the uplands in the center to the Bavarian Alps in southern Germany. At 2,963 meters (9,721 ft) in height, Germany’s highest mountain peak is the Zugspitze.\n\nThis mountain is situated at the border of Liechtenstein in the south of Germany and is part of the Wetterstein Mountains and Bavarian Alps. Three of the five glaciers in Germany are found on the flanks of the massive Zugspitze mountain peak.\n\nPOLITICAL MAP\n\nGermany States Map\n\nStates are the first-level administration unit in Germany. Currently, there are 16 states (Bundesländer in German). Berlin and Hamburg are the two city-states. Similarly, Bremen and Bremerhaven combine as a third city-state.\n\nThe remaining thirteen are area states, which incorporate several cities, towns, and communities. Finally, Bavaria is the largest state in Germany and occupies close to one-fifth of Germany’s land area. Also, it holds Munich, which is one of the most popular tourist cities in Germany."
