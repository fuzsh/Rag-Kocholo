        "text": "These cities in Northern Germany deserve a spot on your bucket list. Visit them one by one, or make a road trip of it!\n\nSince moving to Berlin in 2019, Iâve fallen head over heels in love with Northern Germany. Sure, the weather isnât ideal, but the immense amount of things to do and see in this region more than makes up for it!\n\nIn the past two years, Iâve traveled almost exclusively throughout Northern Germany (since, you know, I couldnât go anywhere else due to *cough* current world events). And you know what? Iâm not mad about it!\n\nWith beautiful coasts along the North and Baltic Seas, plenty of beaches (yes, beaches!), delicious seafood, castles and museums galore, the following Northern Germany cities deserve a spot on your bucket list! But just so weâre on the same page, âNorthern Germanyâ to me includes the states of Bremen, Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony, Mecklenburg-Vorpommen, Berlin, and Brandenburg.\n\nBelow are the cities in Northern Germany that deserve more praise than they get. Obviously, there are plenty more cities up north to see, but if I listed every single one weâd be here all day!\n\n1. Berlin\n\nSuggested length of stay: 5 days\n\nMy home since 2019, Berlin is Germanyâs vibrant capital city. Whether you love clubbing, going to museums, visiting art exhibits, thrift shopping, or just want to eat good food, Berlin truly has something for everyone. If you think Berlin is only worth visiting for its WWII historical sites, think again (although those are definitely worth exploring if that interests you!).\n\nSome of my personal favorite things to do in Berlin include:\n\nVisiting the cathedral (Berliner Dom)\n\nTouring Charlottenburg Palace\n\nHaggling at flea markets\n\nStrolling through Tiergarten Park\n\nWindow shopping in Prenzlauer Berg and Kreuzberg\n\nFor even more recommendations on what to do in Berlin, check out this post on 11+ Unique Things to Do in Berlin and this post on 20+ Free Things to Do in Berlin.\n\n2. Hamburg\n\nSuggested length of stay: 3 to 4 days\n\nGermanyâs second largest city, Hamburg is a beautiful port city with a rich trading history. Iâve visited Hamburg multiple times over the years since one of my best friends lives there. You can easily spend a few days in the city center alone just museum hopping, eating at local cafes, and enjoying the sights.\n\nA few of the top things to do in Hamburg are:\n\nTaking a walking tour (I recommend the free Sandemannâs tour)\n\nExploring Planten un Blomen\n\nWandering around the Speicherstadt\n\nWalking around the AuÃenalster (the large lake near the Old Town)\n\nIf you happen to visit the city when itâs raining (very likely!), make sure to research the best indoor activities in Hamburg beforehand.\n\n3. Hannover\n\nSuggested length of stay: 2 days\n\nHannover (sometimes spelled Hanover) is perhaps the most underrated city in Northern Germany. It was mostly destroyed during WWII and is subsequently one of Germany’s more modern, industrialized cities today. Itâs also home to one of the oldest science and technology universities in the country, so youâll see lots of students downtown if you visit when schoolâs in session.\n\nMy favorite activities in Hannover include:\n\nVisiting Herrenhausen Palace & Gardens\n\nExploring the Old Town\n\nEnjoying the view from the New Town Hall\n\nVisiting the ruins of the Aegidienkirche\n\n4. LÃ¼beck\n\nSuggested length of stay: 2 to 3 days\n\nLÃ¼beck is small but mighty! For many years, it served as the capital of the Hanseatic Trading League, one of the most important trade networks in the Baltic region to date. LÃ¼beck is one of the smaller cities in Northern Germany, but thereâs plenty to see and do here. Marzipan lovers will be especially excited to hear that LÃ¼beck marzipan is world-famous (yes, really!) and there are plenty of spots to satisfy your sweet tooth in the Old Town.\n\nBelow are just a few of my favorite things to do in LÃ¼beck:\n\nVisiting St. Maryâs Church (aka âThe Mother of Gothic Brick Churchesâ)\n\nWindow shopping in the Old Town\n\nVisiting TravemÃ¼nde for a day\n\n5. Wismar\n\nSuggested length of stay: 1 day\n\nWismar is the definition of âpostcard perfect.â This is the smallest city in Northern Germany on this list, but itâs not to be overlooked. It boasts one of the largest preserved ancient town centers in the Baltic region and the city as a whole dates back to 1229. Talk about history! Oh, and did I mention itâs now a UNESCO World Heritage Site?\n\nYou really need just one full day to see the main sights in Wismar. My favorites were:\n\nVisiting the Church of the Holy Spirit\n\nEating a FischbrÃ¶tchen at the Old Harbor\n\nWindow shopping inside the original Karstadt\n\nTaking photos in front of the quaint GewÃ¶lbe building\n\n6. Rostock\n\nSuggested length of stay: 2 days\n\nRostock has a fascinating history; until the fall of the Berlin Wall, it was East Germanyâs largest port and played a vital role in trade between East and West. Today, itâs a bustling university city with easy access to the beach, lots of cute churches worth popping into, and some beautiful public parks perfect for picnicking.\n\nHere are some of the top things to do in Rostock:\n\nWalking along the old city wall\n\nSeeing the astronomical clock inside St. Maryâs Church\n\nExploring the botanical gardens\n\nDining outside at the Neuer Markt\n\nRelaxing at the beach in WarnemÃ¼nde\n\nIf you plan a day trip to the beach, be sure to check out my full guide to WarnemÃ¼nde before you go!\n\n7. Schwerin\n\nSuggested length of stay: 2 days\n\nI know I shouldnât pick favorites but â¦ Schwerin is probably my favorite place on this list. Itâs another small town, but what sets it apart from the other Northern Germany cities on this list is the GIANT CASTLE in the middle of the Old Town. The Schwerin Castle and gardens will undoubtedly be the highlight of your visit.Â There are also some great cafes in the Old Town, so between the good food and the castle youâre all set!\n\nIf youâre planning a weekend in Schwerin, hereâs what I recommend:\n\nTouring the castle (duh)\n\nRelaxing in the castle gardens (also duh)\n\nWindow shopping in the Old Town\n\nVisiting the cathedral\n\n8. Stralsund\n\nSuggested length of stay: 1 to 2 days\n\nStralsund is a gorgeous town near the island of RÃ¼gen, which is a popular beach getaway for Germans. Stralsund is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is known for its Gothic red brick buildings. Although the city center itself is very small and easily explored on foot, thereâs lots to do and see in the area, especially in the summer.\n\nI donât have a full blog post about Stralsund (yet!), but here are some highlights to look forward to:\n\nTaking a day trip to RÃ¼gen\n\nAdmiring the gabled townhouses (there are many!)\n\nVisiting St. Nicholasâ Church\n\nExcited to Visit Northern Germany?\n\nLike I said before, there are many more cities in Northern Germany that are worth visiting âtheyâre on my bucket list! However, Iâve already visited plenty of gems up north and I wanted to pass along the recommendations. If you have any questions about planning a road trip through Northern Germany, donât hesitate to drop me a comment below!\n\nTell me: Which of these cities had you NOT heard of before?\n\nEven More Cities in Germany to Visit:"
