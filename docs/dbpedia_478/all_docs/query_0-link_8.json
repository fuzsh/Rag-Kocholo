        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe capital and largest city of Germany is Berlin, a major center of culture and education. It is also one of Germany’s 16 Länder, or states. Located in the northeastern part of the country, Berlin is surrounded by the state of Brandenburg.\n\nModern Berlin was built on the ruins left by World War II. Not only was the city rebuilt, but its very character changed. While the Berlin that was destroyed in 1943–45 was a single unified capital city, the one that arose to replace it was divided by hostilities engendered by the Cold War. Germany itself was divided into two countries, commonly called West Germany and East Germany. From 1961 until 1989 a wall prohibited the residents of Berlin from passing unrestricted between the city’s eastern and western sections. Though well within East Germany, Berlin was divided between the two countries. West Berlin, which had about two thirds of the people and 54 percent of the land area, functioned in most ways as a detached part of West Germany under British, French, and U.S. occupation. East Berlin, under Soviet occupation, served as East Germany’s capital city. West Berlin had a democratic government, while East Berlin had a communist government.\n\nWhen Germany was reunified in 1990, so too was Berlin, and the united city was once again designated as Germany’s capital. Most government offices remained in Bonn, the former capital of West Germany, until 1999–2000.\n\nCityscape\n\nWith an area of 344 square miles (891 square kilometers), Berlin is by far the largest German city in area, as well as in population. The city lies within the North German Plain, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of the Polish border and 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of the Baltic Sea. The Havel and Spree rivers and a network of canals connect the city with the Baltic Sea and with most European inland ports. A chain of lakes along both rivers, within the city boundaries, provides Berlin with an extensive waterfront. About a third of the Greater Berlin area consists of lakes, beaches, and woods. The Grunewald, a forest of pine and birch trees, covers a large area of southwestern Berlin.\n\nBerlin’s historic city center is known as the Mitte (Middle). At its western edge is the Brandenburg Gate, Berlin’s restored triumphal arch, which dates to the late 18th century. For almost 30 years in the 20th century it led nowhere, because it stood only a few feet from the Berlin Wall. The wall was begun in 1961 by East Germany to prevent its citizens from crossing to the West. The 103-mile (166-kilometer) barrier, which encircled West Berlin, ulitmately was made of concrete, averaged 12 feet (4 meters) high, and was heavily guarded. Those who tried to escape over the wall risked being captured or shot by guards. After the Berlin Wall was opened in 1989, nearly all of it was torn down. A few sections have been preserved as monuments, however, and there are several memorials, including a museum at the notorious former crossing point known as Checkpoint Charlie.\n\nIn front of the Brandenburg Gate stretches the historic Unter den Linden, a tree-lined street that runs eastward for almost a mile (1.6 kilometers). Many of the 18th- and 19th-century buildings that lined it were bombed in World War II, but some have been rebuilt or restored. They include the Staatsoper (State Opera House), the Neue Wache (New Guard House), the Humboldt University of Berlin, and the Berlin Cathedral.\n\nThe Potsdamer Platz, a once-busy square in central Berlin, was destroyed in the war, and later the Berlin Wall was built along its edge. The square was deserted for decades. After the city was reunified, large-scale construction projects revitalized the area with commercial buildings by well-known architects such as Renzo Piano, Helmut Jahn, and Richard Rogers. A Holocaust memorial by architect Peter Eisenman opened nearby in 2005.\n\nTo the north of the Potsdamer Platz lies the Tiergarten, a large park that includes the Berlin Zoo. Near the park’s northern end is the Reichstag (parliament) building. Built between 1884 and 1894 and burned in 1933, it was later restored but was no longer the parliamentary seat. The Reichstag was renovated again in the 1990s, and, capped with a new dome by architect Norman Foster, it once again became the home of the German parliament in 1999. Many other national government buildings are now located in the area.\n\nIn the eastern part of the Mitte is the Alexanderplatz, a shopping and gathering place where East Berlin’s annual May Day festivities were once held. On this square a television tower—the tallest structure in Germany—rises just behind the rebuilt 13th-century Marienkirche (Church of Mary).\n\nModern apartment and office buildings and shopping complexes stand side by side with restored older buildings throughout Berlin. To the west of the Mitte, the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church stands at one end of the Kurfürstendamm, a street known to Berliners as Ku’damm for short. Most of the church was destroyed in World War II; as a monument to the devastation caused by the war, the ruins of the old bell tower were incorporated into a new glass-and-concrete church tower. Nearby is the giant, modern Europa Center, with restaurants, galleries, and sports facilities. Cafés and shops line the Kurfürstendamm, which is part of the Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf district of western Berlin. In the northern part of the district is the 17th-century baroque Charlottenburg Palace, which is a popular tourist attraction. To the west are the renovated Olympic Stadium, first built when the city hosted the 1936 Summer Games, and the International Congress Center, which accommodates large meetings and conventions.\n\nPeople and Culture\n\nAlthough most of Berlin’s people are ethnically German, the city has also long been home to people of other ethnicities. Starting in the 18th century, many French, Jewish, Dutch, Polish, Russian, and Austrian immigrants moved to the city. After World War II workers from Turkey and other eastern Mediterranean countries helped ease the postwar labor shortage. Today, Berlin has the largest Turkish community in Europe. Since reunification, the city has attracted many immigrants from eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, including Jews. Berlin’s once-thriving Jewish community was devastated by the Holocaust but has recently experienced significant growth.\n\nBerlin has long been a center of learning and the arts. Most of old Berlin’s great theaters, museums, and other cultural institutions are still in operation and are very popular. In addition, West Berlin was cut off from the city’s traditional institutions in the Mitte (which was in East Berlin) and so built many new ones.\n\nThe city is famous for its excellent museums. On a small island in the Spree River is Museum Island, a UNESCO World Heritage site that includes the Old and New museums, the Old National Gallery, the Bode Museum, and the Pergamon Museum. Highlights of these institutions include Greek, Roman, Egyptian, and Middle Eastern antiquities, Renaissance sculpture, and 19th-century European painting. The Gemäldegalerie displays masterpieces of European painting from the 13th to the 18th century, while the New National Gallery is dedicated to modern art. Also notable are the Brücke Museum of German expressionist art, the Natural History Museum, the Jewish Museum, the German Historical Museum, and the Dahlem museums, with collections on ethnology and Asian art.\n\nThe city’s many musical ensembles include the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, which is one of the world’s leading symphony orchestras. Berlin boasts three internationally renowned opera houses and more than 100 theaters, including the Berliner Ensemble, which was founded by playwright Bertolt Brecht in 1948. International music and theater festivals are held each year, as is the acclaimed Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nBerlin has many universities and colleges, including the Humboldt University, the Free University, and the Technical University. The Charité is a famous teaching hospital. Since the late 19th century Berlin has been Germany’s main center of science and research. It is the site of the Science Institute for Advanced Studies, several Max Planck institutes, the German Institute for Economic Research, and the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences. The National Library is also located in Berlin.\n\nEconomy\n\nMost of Berlin’s workers are employed in services such as tourism, trade, finance, health care, business services, communications, information technology, and public administration. Berlin is also a center of trade fairs and of film production, book and newspaper publishing, and other media. Although manufacturing has declined in importance, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and the production of automobiles, chemicals, and processed foods are still significant. Siemens electrical products, BMW motorcycles, and Mercedes-Benz engines are made in Berlin.\n\nBerlin is a major rail and air hub, and its expressway system is part of a national superhighway network. For urban transportation the city has an extensive system of subways, surface rail lines, streetcars, and buses. The world’s first electric railway opened in Berlin in 1879.\n\nGovernment\n\nUpon German reunification in 1990, Berlin became one of the country’s 16 Länder (states) as well as the national capital. As a state, Berlin has representatives in the Bundestag and Bundesrat, the two houses of Germany’s parliament. Berlin’s mayor is head of both the city and state governments. The state government consists of the mayor and several ministers, known as senators, whom the mayor appoints. The mayor is elected by Berlin’s state parliament, the House of Representatives. Its members are popularly elected. Berlin cooperates with Brandenburg, the state that surrounds it, in the administration of a number of joint agencies and institutions. For local administration, Berlin is divided into 12 boroughs.\n\nFrom 1949 until 1990, when the city was divided, East Berlin was the capital of East Germany and one of its 15 districts. West Berlin functioned as one of West Germany’s states, though it was not officially a part of that country and did not have full voting rights.\n\nHistory\n\nEarly in the 13th century two villages, Kölln and Berlin, arose opposite each other on the Spree River in the territory of Brandenburg. The villages, which were situated on an east-west trade route, developed as merchant settlements. As they grew and later merged, the name Berlin was eventually applied to both.\n\nIn 1411 the Hohenzollern family gained control of Brandenburg, including Berlin, and in the late 15th century the princes of Brandenburg made Berlin their capital. The city suffered great damage in the Thirty Years’ War from 1618 to 1648. To rebuild the population, the ruler of Brandenburg, Frederick William, invited French and German Protestants and Austrian Jews to settle there. In 1701 Frederick William’s successor was crowned King Frederick I of Prussia. He proclaimed Berlin the capital of the new Kingdom of Prussia. Under Frederick the Great from 1740 to 1786, Prussia became a leading power of Europe, and Berlin took its place among great European cities. In 1806 Napoleon and his army took possession of the city. The French occupation lasted two years.\n\nBerlin became the capital of the German Empire when William I was crowned emperor in 1871. Its population was then about 800,000; by 1900 it had increased to almost 2 million. For decades it was Europe’s third largest city, after London and Paris. The end of World War I in 1918 brought an end to five centuries of Hohenzollern rule. Berlin became the capital of the newly established Weimar Republic. In the 1920s the arts flourished and industry grew.\n\nEarly in 1933 the Reichstag, the parliament building in Berlin, was set on fire. Adolf Hitler used the fire as an excuse to seize dictatorial powers, and Berlin became the capital of the Third Reich (see Germany, “Dictatorship Under Hitler”). British and U.S. bombing during World War II devastated Berlin. The Soviets poured artillery fire into the city before capturing it in 1945.\n\nThe Allies divided Berlin, as well as Germany, into four occupation zones—French, British, U.S., and Soviet—under an Allied Control Council. In 1948 France, Great Britain, and the United States merged their zones in western Berlin into one economic unit. The Soviet Union, which controlled eastern Berlin, withdrew from the council in protest and began a blockade of Berlin’s rail, road, and water communications with the West. The United States and Britain, however, supplied more than 2.3 million tons of coal, food, and industrial goods to the city by air. The airlift involved more than 275,000 flights and lasted more than 11 months, until the Soviets relented and additional supplies were stockpiled. The division of the city into West Berlin and East Berlin was complete.\n\nAn uprising against the communist regime of Soviet-controlled East Berlin, on June 17, 1953, was put down by Soviet tanks. More and more people fled from East Berlin to West Berlin, and thus to West Germany. By the late 1950s West Berlin received as many as 20,000 refugees a day. To halt the flow, East Germany sealed the border in August 1961 and built the wall dividing the city and encircling West Berlin. West Berlin, which was completely surrounded by East Germany, became a symbol of Western freedom.\n\nThe construction of the Berlin Wall separated many Berliners from relatives, and visiting back and forth was difficult through the 1960s. After 1971 it became easier for West Berliners to pay brief visits to the East, but East Berliners were rarely permitted to cross into the West. During the 28 years that the wall divided Berlin, many thousands of East Berliners tried to escape to the West by tunneling under the wall or by climbing over it. Some were successful, and others were caught by the East German authorities. An unknown number (more than a hundred) were killed by border guards or otherwise died in their attempts to reach freedom.\n\nThe years 1989 and 1990 brought revolutionary changes throughout eastern Europe. West Germany’s missions were besieged by refugees who sought permission to immigrate to the West, and the overcrowded mission in East Berlin was forced to close on August 8, 1989. Violent pro-reform demonstrations erupted in East Berlin during East Germany’s 40th anniversary celebrations in October. On November 9, 1989, East Germany ended restrictions on travel and immigration to the West and opened passageways through the wall. In the first week some 3 million Easterners crossed to visit the West. Within a year the wall had been almost totally dismantled, and pieces of it were being sold as souvenirs.\n\nWhen Germany was reunited in 1990, Berlin was designated the capital of the entire country. In a historic vote on June 20, 1991, the Bundestag (Germany’s lower house of parliament) decided by a narrow margin to move to Berlin. In a compromise aimed at dulling the blow to Bonn, the former capital of West Germany, it was decided that six of the 14 government ministries would remain in Bonn permanently. In August 1999 the German chancellor’s office moved to Berlin, and in September of that year the Bundestag held its first session in the restored Reichstag building in the city, marking the official return of the government to Berlin. The transportation networks and power grids of the long-divided city were integrated, and massive building projects transformed the city center. Population (2014 estimate), 3,421,829; urban area, 4,327,502."
