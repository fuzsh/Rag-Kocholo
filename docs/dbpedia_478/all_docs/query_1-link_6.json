        "text": "Answer: The capital of Germany is Berlin which is located in the north-eastern part of the country.\n\nBerlin, the capital of Germany, is a city with a rich history and a central role in shaping Europe’s cultural and political landscape. It is not only the capital of Germany but also the largest city. The city’s history is marked by its division during the Cold War, symbolized by the Berlin Wall, which separated East and West Berlin from 1961 to 1989. Berlin rose from the ashes to become a unified symbol of national resilience Since the reunification of Germany in 1990, Berlin has undergone significant transformation and serves as a symbol of unity. The city is known for its eclectic architecture, combining historic landmarks like the Brandenburg Gate and Charlottenburg Palace with modern structures such as the Berlin Hauptbahnhof (central train station) and the iconic Fernsehturm (TV Tower). As the political capital of Germany, Berlin is home to important government institutions, including the Reichstag (Parliament) and the Chancellery. The city is a cultural powerhouse, boasting world-class museums, galleries, and theaters. Berlin stands as a dynamic and cosmopolitan capital at the heart of Europe with a vibrant arts scene, diverse neighborhoods, and a reputation for innovation."
