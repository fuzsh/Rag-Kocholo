        "text": "District heating already supplies more than a third of houses in Germany’s three largest cities of Berlin, Hamburg, and Munich, according to utility E.ON. In Munich and Hamburg, the share of district heating is slightly above 36 percent, and in Berlin a little over 33 percent, E.ON said in a report on the status of the heating transition in major German cities. Among the four German cities with more than one million inhabitants, Cologne lags behind with a district heating share of around 11 percent. The city has recently unveiled plans to increase the share to about one third by 2030 in order to lower emissions, the report said.\n\nWhile heat pumps supply more than 4 percent of Berlin houses, their share remains at around two percent in Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, E.ON said. The share of gas heating ranges from 36 percent in Hamburg to almost 57 percent in Cologne, and the share of oil heating from 16 percent in Munich to 23 percent in Cologne. In Berlin, Cologne, and Hamburg, between 54 and 59 percent of buildings have already undergone partial or complete renovations to increase energy efficiency. “Munich is a distant fourth with a high proportion of old buildings and 41.3 percent of partially or fully renovated buildings,” E.ON said."
