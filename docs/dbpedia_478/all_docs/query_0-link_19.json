It is bordered by the state of Brandenburg to the east, and its central location within Europe makes it a pivotal point for transportation and commerce. It’s next to a river called the Spree, which flows through the city.\n\nInteresting Facts about Berlin\n\nIn 1961, the Berlin Wall divided Berlin into East and West, separating the capitalist West from the communist East. However, in 1989, people tore down the wall, reuniting the city. This significant event marked the end of the Cold War and reunited East and West Germany.\n\nIt’s home to over 170 museums, including the famous Pergamon Museum and the Berlinische Galerie.\n\nBerlin is surprisingly green, with around one-third of its area covered by parks, forests, and gardens.\n\nBerlin has become a popular place for new tech companies to start and grow. People even call it “Silicon Allee” because of all the tech stuff happening there.\n\nBerlin has a lot of history. There are famous places like the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag building, and Checkpoint Charlie that remind us of the past.\n\nLook out for the little person (Ampelmännchen) on the traffic lights when you’re walking around Berlin. It originally came from East Berlin. Now, lots of people think it’s cool and they like to take it home as a souvenir.\n\nFormer Capitals of Germany\n\nGermany used to have different places as its capital before Berlin became the main one. Below are some of the former capitals of Germany:\n\nAachen\n\nThis city was the capital of the Carolingian Empire in the early Middle Ages.
