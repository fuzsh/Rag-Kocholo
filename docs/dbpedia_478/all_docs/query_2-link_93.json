Dresden\n\nIn east Germany, near the border of the Czech Republic, Dresden is both old and new. During the Second World War, much of the city suffered severe damage. Thankfully, in the years after, many of the historic structures were able to be restored. The city now has an ancient look with a youthful vibe.\n\nThe old facades and edifices now bewitch as they did for centuries, allowing new visitors the chance to admire some of the best architecture in the nation. Highlights of your time here will be the Baroque palace of Dresden Zwinger and the Renaissance Schlösserland Sachsen. The latter of which is home to the biggest porcelain mural on earth, the Furstenzug.\n\nFor modern masterpieces wander the neighborhood of Kunsthofpassage, with quirky designs home to trendy restaurants and dimly lit cocktail bars.\n\n16. Bonn\n\nThe birthplace of Beethoven, Bonn, has been attracting audiophiles for decades. In West Germany, Bonn was once the capital of the nation before rising back to prominence with the help of one iconic composer. Harboring a picturesque location along the Rhine, Bonn is a beacon of German culture. Visitors will have a sweeping range of delightful museums and galleries to experience both history and high art.\n\nThe Romanesque church, Bonner Munster, will draw the eye in with its five towering spires. Alongside the cathedral is Munsterplatz, a large town square and the center of local life. But no time here would be complete without celebrating Ludwig van Beethoven. See his statue in the town square before visiting his childhood home, now an exceptional museum.\n\n17. Fussen\n\nMost travelers have Fussen on their itinerary without even knowing it. Though not one of the largest cities on the list, the town is actually home to one of the most visited castles in all of Europe, Neuschwanstein Castle. But there is much to explore here, at least before and after you visit the iconic castle.\n\nFussen has a strong connection to the monastic order of St. Benedict, including a Benedictine Abbey. Parts of the wall that once bordered the medieval town remain to this day, and the cobblestone boulevards showcase rows of beautiful gothic houses.\n\nThe pedestrianized streets make it a breeze to walk around this charming town. But to rest your legs, head up to funicular for amazing views of Fussen and also Linderhof Palace. Afterward, visit the spectacular Neuschwanstein. The castle that inspired the home of Sleeping Beauty.\n\n18. Mainz\n\nThe Rheinhessen, Germany’s top wine-producing region, shares many similarities with other famed wine-growing regions like Bordeaux and Porto. A fact that should eliminate any doubt of finding a delightful bottle.\n\nAt the center of the region is Mainz, Germany’s wine capital. Split your time between exploring the many gorgeous vineyards that envelope Mainz and the Old Town.

On the River Leine, the city’s plethora of parks and gardens feature endless blooms of flowers creating an alluring landscape.\n\nOne of the best examples is the Herrenhausen Gardens. The tantalizing royal gardens are a mix of manicured grounds that date back to the 17th century.

Potsdam\n\n40 minutes southwest of Berlin, Potsdam can easily be visited on the train. But we think there are plenty of reasons to stick around, from UNESCO World Heritage Sites to Germany’s own version of Versailles.\n\nPotsdam was at one stage, bordered by city walls. Today, only three of the five gates remain and are spread around the city. If you only see one, visit the Brandenburger Tor, a sightly triumphal arch.\n\nFrom there, head to Sanssouci Palace. Built in the 1740s, the palace has drawn comparisons to Versailles as it’s a fellow royal retreat. Soaked in grandeur, the palace is an insightful look into Germany’s royal past. Lastly, Potsdam is home to the elegant Sanssouci Park. The UNESCO site is home to multiple palaces, lush green gardens, ancient Roman baths, and temples.\n\n21.

For this reason alone, it’s one of the top cities in Germany for history buffs.\n\nThe Romans may have come and gone, but the beauty of Trier remains. So too, do the ruins, a poignant reminder from 2000 years ago. Highlights include Porta Nigra, the well-preserved gate from medieval times, and the Imperial Baths.\n\nOver the ensuing centuries, St. Peter’s Cathedral, the oldest in Germany, was added along with the Basilica of Constantine.
