        "text": "The University of Chicago was an entirely new university founded in 1891, using the same name as a defunct school founded in the 1850s which closed in 1886. See Old University of Chicago. Supporters of a new university raised money, selected a new campus in Hyde Park, and opened its doors in 1890. Most of the original financing came from oil magnate John D. Rockefeller, and the American Baptist Education Society The new university had a dynamic young president William Rainey Harper. Classes began in 1892. The goal ever since then has been to build a world-class university covering all fields of study with an emphasis on advanced research and scholarship.\n\nMajor educational reforms were instituted during the tenure of the university's fifth president Robert Maynard Hutchins during the 1930s and 1940s, including the creation of the university's Common Core curriculum for undergraduates.\n\nRecently, the university has begun major campus expansion projects.\n\nFounding\n\n[edit]\n\nJohn Boyer notes that the key promoters Frederick Gates and Thomas Goodspeed:[1]\n\nin 1888 and 1889, were acutely aware of the misery and public humiliation that had accompanied the collapse of the first institution, having had considerable difficulty raising the $400,000 needed to match John D. Rockefeller’s historic offer of $600,000 to re- create a first- rate Baptist college in Chicago.\n\nThe University of Chicago's Hyde Park campus began in 1890 through the efforts of the American Baptist Education Society and oil magnate John D. Rockefeller, who later called it \"the best investment I ever made.\"[2] The University of Chicago held its first classes there on October 1, 1892.[3] The original tract of land, comprising the current main quads, was donated by Marshall Field, owner of the Marshall Field and Company department store. Other rich Chicagoans donated cash to match Rockefeller's offer. Martin A. Ryerson (1856–1932) served as the president of the board of trustees of the University from 1892 to 1922. He donated over $2 million to the university, including $350,000 for the construction of the Ryerson Physical Laboratory and he endowed the Martin A. Ryerson Distinguished Service Professorship in 1925.[4]\n\nThe modern university replaced the defunct institution of the same name; to avoid confusion it was legally renamed Old University of Chicago. Graduates of the Old Chicago University were later assimilated into the ranks of the alumni of the University of Chicago.\n\nThe university's founding was part of a wave of research university foundings that started with Cornell University (1865) and Johns Hopkins University (1876) emulating the research-oriented German universities such as the Humboldt University of Berlin.[5] Incorporated in 1890, the university dates its founding as July 1, 1891, when young William Rainey Harper became its first president. The first classes were held on October 1, 1892, with an enrollment of 594 men and women and a faculty of 120, including eight former college presidents.[6]\n\nWestward migration, population growth, and industrialization had led to an increasing need for elite schools away from the East Coast, especially schools that would focus on issues vital to national development. Rockefeller ultimately chose Chicago. His choice reflected his strong desire to realize Thomas Jefferson's dream of a natural meritocracy's rise to prominence, determined by talent rather than familial heritage. Rockefeller's early fiscal emphasis on the physics department showed his pragmatic, yet deeply intellectual, desires for the school.\n\nWilliam Rainey Harper was an accomplished scholar of religion and a Baptist clergyman. He believed that a great university should maintain the study of faith as a central focus, to prepare students for careers in teaching and research and ministers for service to the church and community.[7] As per this commitment, he brought the Morgan Park Seminary of the Baptist Theological Union to Hyde Park, and the Divinity School was thus founded in 1891 as the first professional school at the new University. Although founded under Baptist auspices, the University of Chicago has never had a sectarian affiliation. The business school was founded thereafter in 1898,[8] and the law school was founded in 1902.[9] Harper died in 1906,[10] and was replaced by a succession of three presidents whose tenures lasted until 1929.[11] During this period, the Oriental Institute was founded to support and interpret archeological work in the Near East.[12]\n\nLike the other research universities at the time, the University of Chicago thus came to revolve around a number of graduate research institutions, following Germanic precedent. The College of the University of Chicago remained quite small compared to its East Coast peers such as Harvard, Yale and Princeton, until around the middle of the 20th century. The undergraduate school paid the graduate students for much of the teaching, and thereby provided tuition money to fund the graduate programs. As a result, the graduate population of the university dwarfs the undergraduate population 2:1 to this day, while the university's undergraduate student body remains the third smallest amongst the top 10 national universities. The student-to-faculty ratio is 4:1, one of the lowest amongst national universities, and nearly all faculty members teach undergraduate courses.[13][14]\n\nThe school's traditions of rigorous scholarship were established primarily by presidents Harper and Robert Maynard Hutchins. Chicago opened its door to women and minorities from the very beginning, a time when they seldom had access to other leading universities. It was the first major university to enroll women on an equal basis with men,[15] as well as the first major, predominantly white university to offer a black professor a tenured position, in 1947.[16]\n\nPresidency of Robert Hutchins\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring his presidency, Robert Maynard Hutchins met with the president of academic rival Northwestern University to discuss the future of the two institutions through the Depression and the looming war. Hutchins concluded that, in order to secure the future of both universities, it was in the best interest of both for the two campuses to merge as the \"Universities of Chicago\", with Northwestern's campus serving as the site for undergraduate education and the Hyde Park campus serving as the graduate studies campus. President Hutchins' vision for what he hoped would become the preeminent university in the world eventually faltered amidst opposition from several groups, most notably Northwestern's medical faculty. Hutchins called the episode \"one of the lost opportunities of American education.\"[17]\n\nStarting in the 1930s, the university conducted a more successful experiment on the college. To make the university a preeminent undergraduate academic institution, administrators decided to implement President Hutchins' philosophy of secular perennialism. This led to the innovation of the common core, an educational strategy in which students read original source materials rather than textbooks, and discuss them in small groups using the Socratic method rather than a lecture approach.[18] The common core is still an important feature of Chicago's undergraduate education. In addition to pioneering this new undergraduate curriculum, the university took steps to eliminate \"distractions\" such as varsity sports, fraternities, and religious organizations. This attracted free-thinkers such as Carl Sagan and Kurt Vonnegut to the university. The university succeeded in eliminating all varsity sports for 20 years and all but five fraternities, although three of the eliminated fraternities were re-chartered in the 1980s.\n\nScience at Chicago\n\n[edit]\n\nThe University of Chicago made contributions to 20th century science. In 1909, Professor Robert Andrews Millikan performed the oil-drop experiment in the Ryerson Physical Laboratory on the university campus.[19] This experiment allowed Millikan to calculate the charge of an electron and paved the way for the theory of quantum mechanics in the 1940s. The American Physical Society now designates Ryerson Laboratory a historic physics site.[20]\n\nAs part of the Manhattan Project, University of Chicago chemists, led by Glenn T. Seaborg, began to study the newly manufactured radioactive element plutonium. The George Herbert Jones Laboratory was the site where, for the first time, a trace quantity of this new element was isolated and measured in September 1942. This procedure enabled chemists to determine the new element's atomic weight. Room 405 of the building was named a National Historic Landmark in May 1967.[21]\n\nOn December 2, 1942, scientists achieved the world's first self-sustained nuclear reaction at a university athletic field known as Stagg Field under the direction of professor Enrico Fermi. A sculpture by Henry Moore marks the spot, now deemed a National Historic Landmark, where the nuclear reaction took place. The original Stagg Field has since been demolished to make way for the Regenstein Library.\n\nOther scientific discoveries that have taken place at the University of Chicago include:\n\nThe technique of radiocarbon dating, developed in 1949 by Willard Libby and his team during his tenure as a professor at the university. Libby was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1960 for this discovery.[22]\n\nThe discovery of the atmosphere's jet stream.[citation needed]\n\nThe discovery of REM sleep.[23]\n\nThe discovery of synchronized menstrual cycles[citation needed]\n\nThe famous Miller–Urey experiment, considered to be the classic experiment on the origin of life.[24]\n\nThe development of Agent Orange, a highly-toxic herbicide that would gain notoriety for its use during the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War.[25]\n\nThe prediction of white dwarfs and black holes by Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1983.[26]\n\nArts at Chicago\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough the University of Chicago is better known for its academic and scientific achievements, its students and faculty have also made significant contributions to the arts. In 1955, the University of Chicago became the birthplace of improvisational comedy with the formation of the undergraduate comedy troupe, the Compass Players.[27] In 1959, alumnus Paul Sills, who many consider the father of improvisational theater, founded The Second City along with Bernard Sahlins, also a graduate of the university. Since its founding, The Second City Theater has inspired other comedy troupes such as Saturday Night Live, as well as serving as an incubator for artists such as Alan Arkin, Mike Nichols, Harold Ramis, Bill Murray, Mike Myers, Stephen Colbert, Tina Fey, Jack McBrayer, and Steve Carell.[28]\n\nIn 1964, Professor Ralph Shapey founded the University of Chicago Contemporary Chamber Players, one of the oldest and most successful professional new music groups in the nation. The Contemporary Chamber Players, also known as \"contempo\", has given over eighty world premieres of established and emerging composers.[29]\n\nWhile teaching on the Committee on Social Thought, Professor Saul Bellow wrote several best-selling novels, including Herzog in 1964 and Humboldt's Gift in 1975, for which he was awarded the 1976 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and Nobel Prize in Literature.[30]\n\nThe University of Chicago also founded the Renaissance Society in 1915, which is devoted to the exhibition of contemporary art. The Society's 1934 exhibition of Alexander Calder's \"mobiles\" and its 1936 survey of paintings and drawings by Fernand Léger were the first solo exhibitions of these artists in the United States.[31]\n\nThe Smart Museum was established in 1974 in association with the University of Chicago's Art History department. It was endowed by David A. Smart and his brother Alfred Smart. In 1983, the museum became a separate unit of the university devoted to serving the entire community, including educational outreach activities in local public schools. In 2000 it completed a $2 million renovation.\n\n1950s–1980s\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the early 1950s, student applications declined as a result of increasing crime and poverty in the Hyde Park neighborhood. In response, the university became a major sponsor of a controversial urban renewal project for Hyde Park, which profoundly affected both the neighborhood's architecture and street plan. For details of this urban renewal effort, see Hyde Park.[32]\n\nThe Spring 1958 edition of the university's literary journal the Chicago Review, edited by Irving Rosenthal and Paul Carroll, published excerpts from William S. Burroughs’ experimental novel Naked Lunch. The university was criticized for publishing fiction deemed obscene by a columnist in the Chicago Daily News and suppressed the Winter 1959 issue, which contained more material from the Naked Lunch manuscript. The university administration fired Rosenthal and Carroll, who regarded the university's attempt at suppressing Naked Lunch as censorship.[33]\n\nThe university experienced its share of student unrest during the 1960s, beginning in 1962, when students occupied President George Beadle's office in a protest over the university's off-campus rental policies. In 1969, more than 400 students, angry about the dismissal of a popular professor, Marlene Dixon, occupied the Administration Building for two weeks. After the sit-in ended, when Dixon turned down a one-year reappointment, 42 students were expelled and 81 were suspended,[34] the most severe response to student occupations of any American university during the student movement.[35]\n\nIn 1978, Hanna Holborn Gray, then the provost of Yale University, became President of the University of Chicago, the first woman ever to serve as the full president of a major research university.[citation needed]\n\n1990s–present\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1990, the Consortium on Chicago School Research (CCSR) was created after the passage of the Chicago School Reform Act that decentralized governance of the city's public schools. Researchers at the University of Chicago joined with researchers from Chicago Public Schools and other organizations to form CCSR with the imperative to study this landmark restructuring and its long-term effects. Since then CCSR has undertaken research on many of Chicago's school reform efforts, some of which have been embraced by other cities as well. Thus, CCSR studies have also informed broader national movements in public education.\n\nOn May 21, 1991, Divinity School professor Ioan P. Culianu was assassinated in a bathroom stall on the third floor of Swift Hall.[36]\n\nIn 1999, then-President Hugo Sonnenschein announced plans to relax the university's famed core curriculum, reducing the number of required courses from 21 to 15. When The New York Times, The Economist, and other major news outlets picked up this story, the university became the focal point of a national debate on education. The changes were ultimately implemented, but the controversy led to President Sonnenschein's resignation in 2000.\n\nIn 2006, the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute became the center of controversy when U.S. federal courts ruled to seize and auction its valuable collection of ancient Persian artifacts, the proceeds of which would go to compensate the victims of a 1997 bombing in Jerusalem that the United States believes was funded by Iran.[citation needed] The ruling threatens the university's invaluable collection of ancient clay tablets held by the Oriental Institute since the 1930s but officially owned by Iran.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2007, the University of Chicago received a $35 million donation from David and Reva Logan to be used toward the construction of the Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts. The new arts center \"will be a venue for the artistic expression and multidisciplinary inquiry, performance and production of our faculty and students\", said President Robert Zimmer in his May 3 note. The building was constructed next to Midway Studios, which was the personal residence and studio for sculptor Lorado Taft. The university selected the firm of Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects to design the center.[37]\n\nLater in 2007, the University of Chicago received a donation of $100 million from anonymous donor known only as \"Homer\". The donation will be used as the cornerstone of a $400 million undergraduate student aid initiative. Beginning in the fall of 2008, students became eligible for enhanced financial aid packages called Odyssey Scholarships, which aim to eliminate student loans entirely among students whose annual family income is less than $75,000 and to eliminate half the student loan packages among students whose annual family income is between $75,000 and $90,000. The College expected nearly a quarter of the entire College population to benefit from the program.[38]\n\nIn 2008, the University of Chicago announced plans to establish the Milton Friedman Institute. Friedman, a Nobel Laureate in economics, received his A.M. in economics from the university in 1933 and was a professor at the University of Chicago for over thirty years. The institute will cost around $200 million and occupy the buildings of the Chicago Theological Seminary. Some faculty members and students signed petition against these plans.[39] During the same year, investor David G. Booth donated $300 million to the university's Graduate School of Business, which is the largest gift in the university's history and the largest gift ever to any business school.[40]\n\nAlso in 2008, the University of Chicago and particularly its surrounding neighborhood of Hyde Park attracted international media attention because of former Law School lecturer Barack Obama's election as President of the United States.[41]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of University of Chicago people\n\nChicago school of economics\n\nBecker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics, since 2011\n\nMilton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics, 2008-2011\n\nChicago school (sociology)\n\nCommittee on Social Thought, interdisciplinary intellectual history, since 1941\n\nCrown Family School of Social Work, Policy, and Practice\n\nThe Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures, West Asia & North Africa (ISAC); before 2023 it was \"the Oriental Institute,\" established in 1919.\n\nPritzker School of Medicine\n\nUniversity of Chicago Medical Center\n\nRegenstein Library, the main library since 1970.\n\nUniversity of Chicago Graduate Library School, 1928-1989, now closed\n\nSmart Museum of Art\n\nRenaissance Society, art museum on campus; since 1915, an independent affiliate\n\nUniversity of Chicago Booth School of Business\n\nUniversity of Chicago Divinity School\n\nUniversity of Chicago Hong Kong, since 2018\n\nUniversity of Chicago Laboratory Schools, for pre-K to grade 12\n\nUniversity of Chicago Law School\n\nHarris School of Public Policy\n\nUniversity of Chicago Press\n\nList of University of Chicago Press journals\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nBoyer, John.
