A two year program affiliated with the St Louis Medical School (formerly the Medical Department of Kemper College) was established in 1845 but was discontinued in 1856. In 1873 some medical courses were taught in affiliation with medical institutions in St. Louis. In 1873 the unit was called the Department of Medicine until 1908 when it was called the School of Medicine. Despite a series of lengthening and shortening of curriculum, the School of Medicine has retained the same name and structure.

In 1960 the Board of Curators established the University Extension Division to be led by a dean -- the first being C. Brice Ratchford who at the time was Director of the Agricultural Extension Service. Since 1963, the date of the creation of the UM System, the Deans of Extension of each campus have reported to the Vice President for Extension (UW). In 1987, the Board of Curators divided the singular office of Extension program leadership into two offices, the Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs-Extension (UW) and the Vice Provost for Extension (MU). Effective 1 January 2004, UM-System Outreach and Extension was transferred under the administrative control of the MU Provost.
