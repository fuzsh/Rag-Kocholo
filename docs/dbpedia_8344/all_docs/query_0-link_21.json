At many sites, this work left behind residual radioactive contamination requiring government cleanups, some of which are still going on. The Department of Energy says it has protected the public health, and studies about radiation harm arenât definitive. But with the government's own records about many of the sites ...",

        "text": "“Performed activities associated with (1) production and purification of plutonium, which involved the handling and processing of uranium compounds; (2) demonstrating the self-sustaining nature of the fission process and the production of Pu-239 from U-238 (nuclear fission and Chicago Pile-1); and (3) health effects (metal toxicology and radiation effects).”\n\n“The University of Chicago Metallurgical Laboratory was involved in early uranium metallurgical work in 1942-1943. The first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was achieved at the university in a \"pile\" called the Chicago Pile 1, built by Enrico Fermi and his Met Lab colleagues. The Met Lab is the direct predecessor of Argonne National Laboratory The University of Chicago continued to perform research and metallurgical work for Atomic Energy Commission until the early 1950s. The University of Chicago site includes seven buildings that were associated with Manhattan Engineer District/Atomic Energy Commission nuclear research and development between 1942 and 1952. These include the new Chemistry Laboratory and Annex, West Stands, Ryerson Physical Laboratory, Eckhart Hall, Kent Chemical Laboratory, Jones Chemical Laboratory, and Ricketts Laboratory. Under the direction of DOE, decontamination activities at the University of Chicago were conducted by Argonne National Laboratory in 1982 and 1983 and by Bechtel National, Inc. (BNI) in 1987. Cleanup of the sites where this work was performed was certified complete in 1989.”"
